I subbed peanut butter for the tahini, as it was what I had on hand.  (Any nut butter would work.)  8 is too many cloves of garlic - cut it in half and you'll still have plenty.  I sauteed my garlic in olive oil before adding it to the food processor with the rest of ingredients.  Took care of that raw garlic unpleasantness.  I also had to add extra oil and lemon juice; it was dry without.  Very good final product!

I thought this hummus was almost perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly but thought the garlic flavor was a little overwhelming and drowned out the other flavors.  I would reduce to 4 cloves of garlic so the flavors balance a little better. Mixing the garbonzo beans can be a bit challenging.

I just made this recipe today and it is wonderful!  A nice garlicky, spicy bite to it.  I used the pepper, cayenne and oregano in amounts to suit my taste. I also made mine in a food processor and needed a little more liquid to blend it properly.   I had saved the liquid from the beans just in case I needed it, although water would have been fine.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Technically, mine was Spicy "Two" Pepper Hummus as I got halfway through making it and realized I was out of jalapenos! (A rarity in my house!) But it still turned out great and was very spicy! Like many of the other reviews, I needed to add more liquid so I switched off water & EVOO until I got the right consistency.  I also felt it needed more cumin so I added (roughly) another 1/2 tsp.  The first time I ever had hummus was in Jerusalem, so I guess I'm kind of a hummus snob.  Store bought just dosen't cut it!  This recipe was a great spicy version!

My search for the Ultimate Hummus Recipe has ended. I will cut down on the spice next time around due solely to the wimpiness of my palate, but give the recipe a wholehearted thumbs-up. Amazing eaten with multigrain Tostitos.

This is a great spicy hummus recipe. Though, I made a few changes.  First, I used two slices of a fresh jalapeno pepper (seeded and ribs removed). Secondly, I added 1 teaspoon of red wine vinegar since I didn't have the juice from the jar of jalapenos. Lastly, I added 2 tablespoons of plain Greek yogurt to the recipe since I like my hummus very creamy.  With these slight changes, I will definitely make this recipe over and over again - thanks!

This was pretty yummy, but WAY too much garlic. I'm a huge garlic fan and add it to everything so I ignored other reviewers comments about it. Next time I'll roast the garlic along with a red pepper, that way it won't have the same raw garlic bite. I halved the recipe but still had to add another Â½ can of beans to make it edible. Also had to add extra liquid. Will definately make again with a few changes. Thanks!

I was surprised at how closely it came to the store-bought I love. SO much cheaper and easier to make at home, but for my use I will need to cut the recipe in half unless I'm having a party. Excellent recipe.

Very good and much more economical than buying the store bought.  I needed to add more liquid to get the consistency I like, but the flavor was GREAT!!!

This is a fun new hummus recipe, and since I make hummus atleast once a week, I have to mention that there is not nearly enough liquid in this, if you are going to use food processor [or magic bullet] like I do.  I always add mix of oil, water & lemon juice in my hummus.  Basically the beans need to be covered in liquid.  Still stays plenty thick!

Amazingly easy to make and it is a great hit.  Now that you can buy Pita Chips at the store, it is an easy party pleaser.

Excellent Hummus recipe! I did add 1/4 cup minced red bell pepper and substitued 1 can of navy beans (I didn't have 2 cans of garbanzo beans). I think I prefer the bean combo, it makes for a creamier hummus. Every bit as good as the spicy Sabra Hummus that I was buying. I serve this with Kangaroo Garden Herb Pita Chips. YUMMY!

I think this recipe could safely be titled "SUPER SPICY HUMMUS".  I found the proportions to be way off, but maybe it's just a recipe that creates a chunkier hummus whereas I prefer the smoother variety.  I used the food processor to ensure a smooth texture, and found I had to add probably a 1/2 cup more olive oil than called for.  I also needed to add plenty of salt.  I was freaked out by the amount of cayenne called for, so I only put in 1/2 tsp.  Good thing, because my lips are still burning from the little bit I just ate.  Overall a decent base recipe, but required many tweaks.

This is the best hummus recipe I've tried yet!  For me, the balance of flavors was spot on (I err on the side of spicy and garlicky).  I found the texture to be just right, too--not overly creamy, not too dense.  This recipe gets two thumbs up from this avid hummus fan.

It wasn't spicy or smooth enough for me so I added more hot peppers and extra lemon juice to give some extra kick.

This was my first time making homemade hummus. It turned out very good! I really like spicy hummus so I added a little more jalapeno than it calls for. I didn't have tahini so I added a little sesame oil instead and I added a little bit of cider vinegar to give it a little bit of tang with the spicy flavor.

WOW!  Couldn't wait until tomorrow to taste; it was awesome.  The one thing I did add was about 1/2 cup of the bean juice to thin and only added 4 cloves of garlic since they were on the large side.  Thanks so much.

This is terrific! I did cut back on the garlic.  I was out of jarred jalapeno's so I used 2 fresh Jalapeno's.  Didn't have juice from the jarred jalapeno's so I used the juice from a jar of pepperoncini's.  Very spicy just the way I like it.  This is a keeper!

Love this recipe!  It is so easy to make and I always get such great compliments.  Everyone is so impressed that a.) I made hummus from scratch and b.) that hummus could taste so great!  Always gone before any other appetizer and definitely gone by dinner.

Tasty hummus the first time I made it. However, adding about a half of a 12oz jar of roasted red peppers made it exceptional!!

This is the best three pepper hummus recipe.  It's fast and easy to make.  It won't last long when used as a dipping spread for crusty breads, crackers etc... But my absolute favoerite way to use it is for a veggie wrap!!

This is very very close to that "popular brand" of hummus.  I didn't have tahini so I did as another user suggested and tried peanut butter.  I would not recommend that and next time I would just substitute with more olive oil or just more water.  The peanut butter was too strong of a flavor.  The overall result was very good... Thanks for a great recipe.

This is okay.  I kind of feel like it's missing something.  I liked the spice.  It's good with salty pita chips... maybe it's missing some salt?

Subbed peanut butter for tahini as someone else suggested, and followed the recipe otherwise. Yuck. We eat store bought hummus all the time, but this is not good. My daughter said it tasted like super hot peanut butter paste. There seems to be way too much cayenne in this - it's completely overpowering. I would also recommend using a food processor - my stand mixer (Kitchenaid) with wire whisk just didn't get it very smooth at all, even after mixing and scraping for a very long time.

I, too, am a fan of the same brand of Spicy Three Pepper Hummus, so it was great to find this recipe.  A couple of observations:  (i) in order to achieve a smooth consistency, considerably more olive oil was needed; and (ii) to achieve a closer taste to the name brand, add some finely diced red pepper and 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar, which brightens the taste.

This was my first attempt at making hummus. I really liked this recipe. I realized I was out of jalapenos after already committing to this, so I used the juice from a jar of pepperoncini's. It still had a nice bite to it. I didn't think the garlic was over-powering, but I think I will roast it next time. Thanks!

I added 1/2 tsp of salt and I used a half of a jar of roasted peppers instead.  Only bc I didn't want it to be super hot.  Delicious!!

Fantastic spicy hummus with lots of garlic (which I love).  I didn't have jarred jalapeno peppers so I used 1 and 1/2 fresh jalapenos.  I added about 2 tbsp. water to the hummus just to get the proper consistency and I'm enjoying every bite right now, yummy!!!

This is a great recpe.  I'm hooked on the store bought brand, but it can be expensive.  I added salt, and some fresh red bell pepper.  I also thought it was missing something, so I added some vinegar, which made the flavor even better and also helped thin it out to a nicer consistency.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I didn't use the cut up jalepenos (just the juice) because I have a toddler that I wanted to enjoy the hummus as well.  I added some pine nuts to the top (raw) and this gave it just the added flavor I was looking for.  I made homemade pita (for the first time!) and cut up cucumber.  The flavors mesh SO well!

WOW!  This was SO easy to make and DELICIOUS!  However, instead of 2 wimpy slices of jalapenos, I used 3 whole serrano peppers from my garden!  YUM!  It went GREAT with the "Pita Chips" recipe on here too!  It really made me feel accomplished! :)

We've made a few hummus recipes and this is our favorite so far.  It's full of flavor and the creamiest hummus we have ever had, with a little kick.  The spiciness is not too strong, but more of a "warming" effect.

This is a wonderful recipe. If you cant find Tahini, you can prepare it in the blender or food processor, make a cream with sesame (ajonjoli) toasted and oil olive. When I dont have jalapeÃ±os, I use green peppers (aji verde)or limo peppers (aji limo).

After reading reviews I made the following changes: Used my food processor instead of mixer. Had to add a little extra juice from beans for consistency.I only used two large cloves of garlic and it was good. When it was first finished it was extremely HOT but after sitting in 'fridge overnight it seemed to mellow out. Still spicy but good. I'll make again and work on the consistency. Maybe a little more EVOO. Definitely worth making. You get 3x as much for about the same price (if you already have tahini).

WOWIE--SPICY!  Not bad though.  I had the same trouble as everyone else though.  Very dry.  I ended up adding approx 2 TBSP water, almost another TBSP oil, and probably about another 2 TBSP of lemon juice.  Nice thing about this recipe is you can just keep adding until you get the consistency you like.  The extra lemon juice MADE this recipe.  I really didn't care for it without the extra juice.  It was VERY garlicy so next time I plan to scale that down by 1 or two cloves.  And I only used 1 tsp Red Pepper (Thank God).  Otherwise its good, its just got a kick!  Will most likely make again!

Good, nice and spicy!  But I agree with another reviewer who said they felt like it was missing something.  Definitely salt, maybe a tad more lemon juice and cumin?

I love this recipe.  I did make some changes.  I used greek peperoncini peppers vs. jalapenos.  I also added an extra Tbsp. Olive oil in blending and 1/4 water.  I cut my cayenne pepper to 3/4 tsp.  and added 1/4 tsp Cavender's Seasoning.

This recipe highlights the versatility of hummus.  I followed the recipe as written, except I added one more slice of jalapeno and ground white and black pepper by 'guesstimate'. I also had to add about 2 tsp more oil as it came out a bit thick the next morning.  Regardless, this recipe is excellent and worth a try.

Very good, but I must have used too much garlic.  Don't get me wrong, we love garlic and eat a lot of it...but I think my cloves were too big or something.  I liked the kick of the peppers but I thought the garlic was a little overpowering. When I make again, which I will, I will go for smaller garlics or just decrease the amount.  Highly recommend.

I thought the basic flavor of this was good, though like others I found it was too dry, so definitely reserve some of the fluid from the beans, or add extra EVOO. 

Also, I'm taking this to a get together so I didn't want it to be too spicy, so I only used a teaspoon of cayenne. And it's plenty spicy! I also added some salt to taste.

The flavor of this is great, but it came out extremely dry.  I needed to add extra tahini as well as liquid from the beans.  After that it was great.

My daughter and I loved this recipe.  I've always made the traditional hummus recipe but I will now use this one instead, love the extra zing from the peppers.  I also used dry organic chickpeas that I soaked and cooked.  Very yummy!

Just as good as the hummus you buy in the store.  I made mine in the food processor and needed to add a little water to help it come together to my desired consistency.

WOW! Yum!  I cut this recipe in half and forgot to cut the jalapeno peppers in half.  Had a bit of a kick to it. If I do it right next time this will be AWSOME.  Thanks so much.  Check out the jalapeno and black ban hummus from this site.  I hate chickpeas in anything else but hummus.

I'm glad I read the reviews before I made this, so I was prepared for it to be quite thick. To offset that, I doubled the lemon, added a tablespoon more olive oil, and added water until I got the consistency I was looking for.  I also halved the cayenne pepper, and found it was just right for heat.

I added 1 tsp (4 cloves) of garlic paste and it was just right. I wasn't sure how much jalapeÃ±o to add, so I put 1 whole pickled jalapeÃ±o, diced. I also used PB2 (low calorie peanut butter powder). I will be making this again!

made it the first time and this hummus was just way to spicy and i had to double the recipe (minus the hot ingredients) to tone down the spice.  second time i made this recipe i used peppercinis instead of jalapenos and cut the cayenne pepper by half....

This was my first introduction to hummus ... now I am hooked.  I make this all the time - I am not a huge fan of the tahini, so I use just a little bit less (or sub peanut butter). It is a huge hit whenever I bring along to a gathering... I enjoy using fresh red bell pepper to dip into it the best.

This was good. Very similiar to the store bought one I love. It was a tad bit too lemony and garlicy. I will add a little less of those ingredients next time I make it.

Perfect recipe! I used a food processor to blend the ingredients and arrived at a perfectly smooth consistency. I increased the amount of tahini based on my personal preference and also saved just a few teaspoons of the bean canned liquid, and it was just to my liking. Drizzle the top with olive oil and sprinkle with hot paprika for an extra kick.

Yummy.  Halved the spices due to personal preference thinking I could add more if needed. Used a blender to mix.

Great base recipe!  I cut the recipe in half and added some dried cilantro flakes as well.  I added 7-8 jalapeno slices (round ones) and yes it had some kick.  Also I used a garlic press for the garlic, and just threw everything into my food processor. Then I sprinkled paprika over the top to make it look pretty.  Awesome recipe - I will definitely make again.  Overall it's much cheaper to make on your own, not to mention it being more fresh.

I thought this was very tasty and very easy.  The spices were great and gave it a great kick.  My husband loved it!  Will definitely keep this!
