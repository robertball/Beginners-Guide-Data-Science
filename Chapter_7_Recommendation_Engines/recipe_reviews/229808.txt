I liked this alot!  Very flavorful!  I used a smaller pan for the green beans, since a 13x9 was too big to get an even layer of green beans on the bottom.  Also, I used a little less onion than the recipe called for, and I used fresh grated parmesan cheese.  Next time I will use more parmesan cheese to completely cover the greenish/brownish color of the onions and green beans, and maybe even mix some in with the green beans in addition to the top for extra flavor.  I will definitely make this again!

Was looking for a recipe to use up some cherry tomatoes and I found this one.  This is moving to the top of my side dishes list.   It's excellent.

I love caramelized onions and green beans so I had great hopes for this dish. I knew the balsamic vinegar would add sweetness and had thoughts of omitting the sugar.  Instead, I used just 1/4 tsp sugar and it was way too sweet for us.  Salt and pepper was added to the onions with the garlic tossed in at the end of caramelizing so it would not burn and be bitter.  A quick broil to melt the cheese and roast the tomatoes would save cook time.

This recipe is such a great alternative to the soupy creamy green bean casserole that most people have at Thanksgiving.  I've made this several times since the summer and it's always a hit.  I use a whole tomato and just thinly slice it and put it over the green beans and it's delicious.  Thanks!!

We loved the caramelized onion portion of this recipe although I did cook mine about twice as long, but we found the beans bland.  It needed something to tie the layers together

First time we have tried green beans like this and we loved them. I did scale the recipe down to about 6 servings for just two of us then the leftovers were warmed on the grill and served with burgers for a lovely lunch outside Used pink himalayan salt  for the  boiling water and had no  problem with  bland green beans.  Also had a very nice aged balsamic from a speciallty store so did not add the sugar.  I prefer red onions  and was  liberal with the cheese.  Great combination of flavors, easy to put together and with fresh tomatoes out of gardens this casserole will be over the top. Made and reviewed for the Alphabet Tag game.

Really good. Cooked the onions in butter, doubled the cheese, and packed on the tomatoes. Yum

Fabulous recipe! I cooked the beans in instant pot, and used red onions (and less sugar). Absolutely delicious and super-easy.

This dish is a good complement to a bland entree like beef stroganoff. It needs an additional invredient; I just don't know what it would be. I probably won't make this again.

Just okay. Nothing binds this dish's ingredients, so I'm not sure why it's called a casserole.  It's more like some green beans and some onions.  Maybe one could add a lot more cheese and stir the ingredients?  Also, this was a lot of work for little or no reward.  One plus: the onions are fabulous, so I'm going to eat those at least. I'm also going to add some smoked ham to try to salvage the dish, but I don't think I'll ever make it again.
Update: It freezes well, and the addition of ham made it very good.  Again, the onions are wonderful, so I might consider making it again with ham or bacon.

My new favorite green bean casserole. I made no changes. Surprisingly good, my husband and I said at the same time "This is really good". Have shared with family and friends they love it too... Try it, you'll like it

I followed all the ingredients except for the vinegar.  I added uncured turkey bacon, grated fresh Parmesan cheese and gluten free seasoned bread absolutely wonderful.
