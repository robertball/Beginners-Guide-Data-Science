This one is a winner!  Browning the meat before putting it in the slowcooker adds a lot of flavor, and it prevents the meat from totally shrivelling up.  Also, I mixed the soups in the pan I browned the meat in to get more flavor (and I didn't want to waste the meat juices).  Even my super-picky husband gobbled it down!

Overall tasty! Here are some mods I made. I used sirloin tip roast b/c it was on sale. After I seared the meat, I couldn't let all the yummy bits on the bottom of the pot go to waste, so I deglazed the pan using some red wine and added that to the mix. I also added mushrooms & celery and a 1/2 cup of red wine. I also used 1 can of Roasted Garlic Mushroom soup and 1 can of lower fat regular Mushroom soup. The meat came out so incredibly fork tender! Like with other reviewers, I ended up with lots of juice. Served it over wide egg noodles. One word=HEARTY!

This had a simple, yet very full and delicious flavor.  This is a great recipie to use with a lean meat becaue the meat truely is a tender as butter when you're done.  The vegetables were delicious too.  I added a little bit of water in the beginning because the soup looked to thick, but it watered down the gravy a little.  This recipie is perfect the way it is, don't change a thing!

this was by far the easiest and most delicious recipie I've ever made.  It took about a half an hour to throw together in the morning, kept it off until I was ready to walk out the door, fliped it to low, and 8 hours later we had a delicious pot roast.  I made egg noodles and mashed potatoes to go with it, but the potatoes weren't necesary.  between the veggies, noodles and meat, we were to stuffed for the potatoes.  I  added a few diced mushrooms to the gravy, added red wine to the gravy like someone had suggested, I didn't put potatoes in because I made mashed potatoes, but I added 2 red onions, parsnips and Carrots.  This was DELICIOUS and I can't recommend this recipe enough!!!!

Easy and satisfying. I used chuck, skipped the browning (the sauce and long cook time seemed like it would make this unnecessary, and it was), and added fresh mushrooms. The gravy was very soupy, and there was a lot of it, so at the end I took the meat and veggies out, stirred in about 3 or 4 Tbs cornstarch mixed with a little cold water, and that thickened it into a perfect, thick gravy. Which we sopped up with crusty french rolls. This was delicious!

This is my first attempt at a pot roast and I am SO impressed! Here's what I did: I rubbed the roast with garlic powder, used 2 cans of Campbell's cream of mushroom with roasted garlic, one packet of Lipton's beefy onion soup mix, used the stated amount of veggies, and cooked in my crock on high for 5 hours. The end result was outstanding. The veggies were tender crisp, and the roast was tender and delicious. What a gravy this one makes! Thank you thank you thank you!

I had never used a round roast until I made this recipe.  It was fantastic.  Even better as leftovers.  I added 1 tsp. fresh garlic; 1 small can of beef broth and 2 tsp. Emeril's spices for flavor. I did not want a thick gravy and it was perfect.  I added 2 onions cut in quarters and 1 bag of mini carrots with about 3 hours left of cooking to avoid the mush factor.  The potatoes I put in 1 hour after meat was cooking.  I recommend the searing. It made it very flavorable.  I cooked it for about 7 hours and it was plenty.  It is a great crockpot recipe and a wonderful Sunday night dinner!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was one of the best roast recipes I have come across. I used a tri-tip because that is all I had it came out so tender it just fell off the fork, I will always use a tri-tip from now one. Because I didn't have enough potatoes or carrots for the stew I put in mushrooms and celery.  I also seasoned the tri-tip with season-all before browning it.  I used one can of cream of Mushroom with roasted garlic because I didn't have two cans of regular cream of mushroom soup. the mixture was terrific.  the gravy this roast recipe made was so good, that we used it the next night over rice and the left over meat.  My girls loved this recipe and told me to make sure I make it again and again!

I gave this only three stars because the meat was a little tough and the veggies were a little under done. I let this cook for 9 hours so I don't know what went wrong. I prefer the recipe on this website titled "Pot Roast in Foil". That was so much better.

This is a classic slow cooker recipe for a tasty pot roast - BUT - LEAVE THE LID ON!  Every time the lid is removed, the moisture and heat needed to cook a tender roast is lost!  That lengthens the cooking time, risks drying the meat and even can be a food toxicity issue if the temperature drops and stays much below 158 degrees.  In other words, "set it and forget it!"

Wow! This was amazing! I don't have a slow cooker, but I made this according to the recipe and put it in a very large covered skillet and then into the oven at 250 degrees for about 7 hours. The meat cut like butter and everyone absolutely gobbled it up! The gravy is wonderful!

This was, by far, one of the best roasts I have ever made!  My great-aunt always made the best roast, and I've never found a recipe that came close until now! Normally, I follow the recipe exactly...but considering my time limit, I had to make a few minor changes.  I started cooking it late afternoon, so there wouldn't be enough time to cook it in the slow cooker.  Instead, I cooked it in the oven.  Rather than one can of CoM soup, I used two since I like a lot of gravy! I also used the beefy onion soup mix, as the regular onion soup mix is too "oniony" for my taste.  I seared the roast per the recipe directions, and put the roast and drippings in the bag.  I then added the carrots and red potatoes.  After I spread the "gravy" generously over the roast, I put the rest on the veggies.  I cooked it on 375 for about two hours, then took it out of the bag to test for doneness.  i then stirred and covered the raost and veggies with tinfoil, and cooked it for another 2 hrs. at 350.  The gravy the soup mixtures made were amazing!! There were no left overs! Other than the cooking method and extra can of soup, no changes need to be made!

What an awesome recipe! It seemed WAY too simple to come out tasting SOOOO good... but don't be fooled by the simplicity... the end result will not disappoint you! Definitely take the extra time to brown the roast first; it seers in such great flavor. I cut up a few stalks of celery and added it along with the carrots and potatoes; also don't skimp on the amount of garlic because it pairs so well with the beef. This is a wonderful dish; it will be my "go to" pot roast recipe from now on. (Even my mother-in-law loved it and went back for seconds!)

This recipe has to be the easiest way to cook a super scrumptious pot roast..  In my humble opinion,all beef needs to be browned before slow cooking. It not only improves the looks of the finished product but also sears in the flavor of the roast.  thanks! kathy ....Kelly

Thanks JAQUE,
Excellent for this type of meat cut.
never tough if left alone and not uncovered. and for full time..I usually start out high til near boil, then low for the 6 hours.  great recipe...gimme more..hehe..  good recipe for Kathys roast and veggies..
add and delete veggies as preference. and spices.  The method is what counts here.. and browning really helps. a good stainless steel skillet works wonders with the browned stickies and some good wine used to loosen it up....and add to cooker..hehe..
GOOD JOB

This is how my grandmother taught me how to make a good roast. She always said that the browning seals in the juices and makes for a very juicy and tender roast. Sooo good! I use golden mushroom soup. Seems to make it a little more richer and gives it a golden color! Love this one!

This was very good! Made a few changes.. Used Red Petite potatoes instead of new. Used Baby carrots, and 2 med. onions cut in quarters.  Before browning the meat I minced 2 cloves or garlic and added that to the pot when browning the meat in oil.  Put on high for 5 hours.  Then sliced the meat and added back to the mixture in the crockpot for 1 hour.. Added extra flavor to the meat.

I had a bottom round roast and was looking for what to do with it.  I hate mushrooms, but this recipe got such good reviews I thought I'd try it anyway.  (Actually the onions kind of overpower the mushroom.)  It's a keeper for sure!

Since trying this recipe I have never gone back to the way I used to make a roast!  It is so yummy!  The only change I made is I add 1 cup of water in the croc while mixing the soups together.  I even use the soup mixture from the croc to make gravy.  Just strain 3 cups of soup mixture from croc pot into a small skillet.  In a small jar with lid combine 1/4 cup cold water and 3 T flour; shake to blend.  Gradually stir flour mixture into soup mixture with whisk.  Cook over medium heat until mixture boils and thickens, stirring constantly.

This was my first time using my Slow Cooker and this recipe was fantastic!  I did not brown the Roast in the Pot as specified in the recipe, I just cooked it longer in the Crock Pot.  (Approx. 8 hours) I also used 4 red potato's instead. The roast came out simply tender and delicious.  I will definitely make this again!!

Mmmm... this recipe is definitely a keeper! Great the first time, and leftovers are delicious!  
DH prefers mashed potatoes, so I only made the roast & gravy.  Removed roast 30 minutes before serving, and added some (2 tbls) cornstarch (mixed w/ cold water) and turned crockpot to high.  Gravy turned out perfect!

Although this was the best roast I've ever made, I am just reluctant to give ANY roast a five star rating... Alright:  Here's what I did differently.  Rubbed the roast with Penzey's Chicago Steak Season / Penzey's Sunny Spain and Cayenne Pepper.  Seared in olive oil.  Soups:  Healthy Choice from Campbells (Low Sodium  & Fat) and Lipton's Golden Onion.  Russet potatoes and baby carrots.  Worcestershire.  Minced Garlic.  And, made sure to flip the roast in the crock a couple of times, to prevent the part that wasn't submerged from drying out, as we're all accustomed to in this house.  Seriously surprised that I didn't mess this one up.  And, that means if The Queen Of Dry, Awful Roasts didn't screw it up - You Won't.

I've made this twice.  The second time I used low sodium soup, and it turned out much better.

This is very good, I use only one can of mushroom soup, pkt of onion soup and a can of beef broth. Seems to come out much more moist then the listed way. Then I make gravy out of the juice....AWESOME

Great recipe!  This was my first try with a slow cooker, so I was a little apprehensive, but wow, what great flavor.  I cooked on high for 4 hours and the roast just fell apart and practically melted in our mouthes!  I had to really squeeze to fit a 3 lb. roast in my crock pot, but it cooked really well!  After the meat was done, I took it out and added more potatoes to the pot and cooked for another couple of hours.  I have no idea how the original recipe is supposed to serve 12 because we devoured it between my fiance and myself for dinner and lunch the next day!

This meat is so delicious. So tender you can cut it with a feather. I made this in the oven in a roasting pan covered tightly with foil at 350 degrees for 3 hours. Stirred a splash of red wine and 2 Tbs of Worcestershire Sauce into the soups. Didn't cook the veggies with the meat.

Delicious!  I've made pot roast many different ways, but this is the best yet.  I made this just as written, with the only change using 1 can of garlic mushroom soup, and adding additional vegetables.  My husband loved this too, repeatedly thanking me for making this dish.  Thanks for the great recipe. It's definitely a keeper - easy and yummy.

I tried this recipe and I agree with most who left reviews.  I added celery and two very small onions for more onion flavor.  I also rubbed a small amount of sea salt, and thyme to the roast prior to searing it.  The flavor was incredible, through the roast, and "gravy" was also great.  Thank you so much for this recipe, I will be making this again.

This is really good!  The soups makes a terrific gravy.  I only had a top round roast, not sirloin, but it didn't matter. The meat was fork tender.  I rubbed the meat with fresh pepper and garlic powder prior to browning.  As others suggested I mixed the soups in the pan used for browning in order to deglaze the pan. I didn't have new potatoes so I quartered russert potatoes.  Make sure you have some bread on hand to pour over the remaining gravy!

Made this last nite for dinner.  Followed the receipe only difference was I bought a 3 lbs. rump roast.  Meat was juicy and done just they way we like it.  The gravy was delicious.  Will have the leftovers tomorrow.  The smell as it was cooking was throughout the house and couldn;t wait to sit down for dinner.  Will definately make this again.

My family enjoyed the flavor of this recipe, although it was a bit salty.  The main problem we had was that the meat was very dry after 8 hours in the crockpot.  I followed the directions perfectly, but just couldn't get the meat to turn out right.  Any suggestions?

I have to admint I was a little skeptical about this recipe.  I have made it twice now and both times it was delicious! The first time I didnt add any veggies.  The second time I added potatoes, carrots and celery and it tasted much better than without.  The only change I made was after I browned the meat, I delgazed the pan with a little bit of beef broth and added that to the sauce mixture.  Great Sunday dinner recipe!

Fantastic!  I made it according to recipe, only left out the potatoes and did mashed potatoes on the stove.  It was wonderful.  The leftovers were also awesome!  Thank you, thank you, this is the best pot roast I ever made.  One hint, place roast in crock pot with fat layer UP.  I read this in a magazine, then the fat melts down into the meat as it cooks, I do believe this helped my roast become sooooooooooooo tender!!!!

I've made a similar roast on the stove top but what's slightly different it that it was seasoned in garlic powder.  I chose to use only one can of soup and added 1/2 can of water.  At the end I transfered the gravy to the stove top and thickened it using 3 T flour and 1/2 C water.  Super tasty!

This was excellent!  I followed the recipe closely, but I found that if the potatoes and carrots were added in the last 2 to 3 hours, it prevented them from being too mushy.  I had to remove the potatoes after the first 3 hours because they were already well cooked.  Then put them back in at the end.  Love pot roast, and I will make this one again!!

Although the roast was INCREDIBLY TENDER, we thought it made far too much gravy!  I used one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of cream of celery soup, which added a nice touch. I cooked it on high for 4 hours and found that the vegetables were a little on the soft side. I'm giving it four stars because although it the meat was extremely tender, the gravy overpowered the flavor of the roast itself.

Wonderful flavor and tender roast.  I cooked mine on the stove for several hours because I forgot to get it in my crockpot in the morning.  Still wonderful.  Loved the gravy. Hubby loved the vegetables.

This was good.  I also added celery.  I added just over half of the onion soup mix, didn't want it too salty.  Because my slowcooker was so full, I cooked it on low for a few hours and turned it on high -- combined total of 8 hours.  My husband and 6-year old enjoyed it.  The meat was tender.

This was an extremely easy and great tasting recipe.  I made it for Valentine's Day and it was a hit.  He thought I slaved over the meal but in reality it was the easiest meal I've ever made.  I think using the bottom round was less fatty than using a regular pot roast.  Thanks for the recipe!  PS - I sliced 2 red onions and added them in with the rest of the ingredients and served over white rice.  The gravy was great.

I love rump roast! They're always so tender and flavorful. This recipe makes an outstanding dinner for five! I rubbed the roast with 1T of garlic powder, then cut the onion soup mix to 2/3 of an envelope and added 1 cup beef broth. Tender, moist and flavorful. Thanks, Kathy you cooking times is right on!

Yum!  We both liked it a lot.  Next time, we will add more and more variety of veggies (but we say that about almost every recipe).  Leftover, the sauce is really thick and adding some warmed broth (vegetable or beef) makes it much more edible.  but the first time around it is is wonderful.

My husband and 2 year old loved this! I was worried about adding the Cream of Mushroom but it made a ton of great-tasting Gravy. I cooked for 3 hours on high and 2 on Low and meat was tender and veggies perfect. Will also make mashed potatoes instead next time.

Made this last night and it was delicious.  Very warm and comforting- perfect for cold weather.  I used 99% fat free cream of mushroom soup and added frozen peas to the slow cooker the last hour of cooking.  Served it over wide egg noodles.  The flavor of the meat was fantastic, not to mention extremely tender.

With interest I learned that browned and cooked meat and vegetables evolved from the colonial-era New England boiled dinner. Termed "pot roast" sometime before 1881, it is a true early american dish. This recipe by Kathy is a great example. Made this yesterday and my wife and daughters loved it! I had seconds. Used a 3# tri-tip roast, browned both sides,  added carrots, potatoes, and I used 1 can of campbells cream-of-mushroom w/ garlic and 1 can Amy's organic C.O.M. soup (first time making this - can say if it made a difference), and the only other addition was i added portabella mushrooms and a little red wine, about 1/3 cup. Slow on low for 8 hours - just set it and forget it - didn't stir or turn at all. Cooked just right & Delicious!! I did expect the liquid aspect of the dish to be thicker, more gravy-like, with the soup being condensed (thicker), but is was liquidy. Next time I will remove the meat & vege's and make a gravy. Served with cranberry sauce and sourdough bread (french, I know but went well with it and sopped up juices great!). I will definitely make this again! Thanks Kathy!

I will up the number of potatoes and carrots next time I make this, because the meat-to-veggie ratio didn't seem ideal.  Otherwise, delicious!

This is so easy and everyone loved it.  The only change I made was to use one teaspoon of the onion soup mix which worked out well for us.

Simple and delicious! The only thing I would've done different is put the veggies in later after the roast. They came out a little too overdone. That's my fault though, because my slow cooker is crazy and likes to cook things too fast. My advice if you're making this for the first time is do it exactly as instructed. You can always personalize it to your taste later. :)

Fantastic flavor.  It turns out somewhat firm (NOT tough) and not "melt in your mouth" which my husband, my 3-year-old and I enjoyed.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY and ended up with mushy potatoes and very tough meat. Browning the meat for 20 full minutes seemed like too much to me, but the ratings for this recipe were so high, I did it anyways. Won't do that again. I can't think of what else could have gone wrong. The flavor was good, but you should have seen all the chewing going on at our dinner table - we had some good laughs, at least.

I used a 2.5 pound pork sirloin roast, baby carrots, and cut-up russet potatoes, but otherwise followed the directions. Browning the roast didn't help the shrinkage, but maybe that's a beef-only tip? The gravy/sauce was delicious, and the carrots were good. The pork was a bit dry after all that (and I turned it off of low to "keep warm" after 6.5 hours because it was just boiling away), and the potatoes were kind of a mess.

I used a 5 pound roast and followed the instructions exactly as written. It came out fantastic! My family raved and raved. You must make white rice with it. It's very simple to make and so yummy.

Very juicy, flavorful and tender way to cook this lean cut of roast! I followed the recipe except I substituted a can of french onion soup as I didn't have dry soup mix on hand. The juice was a bit thin as a result but tasted great when spooned over the meat and veggies! I'll be shopping for another good buy on bottom round soon!

This was one of the best roasts I have ever had.  When I first put the ingredients in, I was afraid it was going to be too dry and wanted to add some additional liquid but decided to go as directed.  It doesn't need anything extra, it comes out perfect!!

This roast was the most flavorful I have ever tasted.  The seasoning was perfect.  I browned the roast on all sides first and then deglazed with red wine.  This really added richness to the recipe.  I cooked on high approx 6 hours and added the veggies after 3 hours.  Absolutely delicious!!

Very very good and easy, easy!!! It was so nice to come home to this meal. The aroma was marvelous. I really browned my roast well and rubbed it with lots of garlic powder and pepper. It was as tender as butter. YUMMY!!

Excellent! !   I made this for Sunday dinner but I did change a few things.  I didn't have 2 cans of mushroom soup so I used a can of reg. and a can of golden mushroom soup along with 3 tbls. of worchestershire sauce.  This was so good, the roast fell apart and the gravy was so flavorful!  I will file this recipe in my Recipe Box and use again.  Thanks so much!

This roast rocks!  I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder; didn't brown before putting in crock pot; added a can of cream of celery and a can of beef broth; used onions instead of carrots; added potatoes half way through cooking and added a package of fresh mushrooms 45 minutes before it finished cooking.  It was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

All I can say is O'My Goodness. This isn't even finished cooking yet & my husband & I have been picking.  This is well worth making again & again.  I didn't have Cream of Mushroom so I used Cream of Potato & Cream of Celery.  No problem with the substituion.  I seared the meat & did add the 2T of red wine.  I will be playing with this one again & again.  Thanks.

This is easy yet delicious! I made some minor changes - I did coat the roast in flour and sear before throwing in the crock pot w/the other ingredients. I also used 1 can cream of mushroom, 1 can cream of potato, and 1 can french onion soup (instead of the onion soup mix) - all low sodium. I also added about 1 tsp minced garlic, about 2 Tbsp. of red cooking wine and a few pinches of thyme. I cooked on low for about 8-1/2 hours - it was wonderful. Perfect for winter evenings!

delicious!  I doubled the recipe and had 8 adults and 3 kids over for dinner and not a drop left!  I used 2 cans of the garlic mushroom soup and 2 cans of cream of celery.  I also used chuck roast on the reccomendation of my butcher. It was awesome! I froze the gravy for later use.  Will def make again!

I was very pleased with this recipe. I used a slightly smaller 2 1/2 pound roast and cooked it on high for 4 1/2 hours. I used the 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup and the gravy it made was out of this world. My hubby hates anything with mushrooms and he couldn't even tell thats what I used. What he doesn't know won't hurt him. : P The only other thing I changed was that I used butter gold potatoes peeled and chopped into large pieces, kept the carrots and added half of a red italian onion. Everything turned out just great and I have a new found love for my crock pot. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Great recipe!! I used cream of celery soup instead, since my husband doesn't like mushrooms.  Also I used one bag of miniature carrots and threw  in the potatoes with skins on so there was nothing to peel. I cooked on high in the crock pot for about 7 hours. Tasted fantastic!!

Very tasty and tender.  Did not brown, since I did this early in AM before work (not enough time), and I don't think it mattered.  Added 1 tbsp red wine and 1 clove chopped fresh garlic to the mix, and a couple small onions.  Might want to make sure the veggies are under roast or near the crockliner sides so they cook tender.  Made a great gravy for a 3# roast.

This made a very tender a flavorful roast with lots of tasty gravy.  Only issue I had was that the vegetables seemed a little salty so next time will only use 1/2 pkg onion soup mix and some fresh onion for the onion flavor.  But there will definitely be a next time!  Roast was delicious!

I concur with those reviewers who gave thius recipe a 5 star. The beef is tender, and superbly flavored. The vegetables aredone without being mushy.  What's not to like.

Excellent and super easy, I used two 3lb roasts and doubled all the ingredients and cooked it in a very large crockpot and the only thing it needed was salt to taste!  The entire family enjoyed it and I will make this again.  There was plenty of gravy and that will freeze nicely for another meal.  I recommend putting in the veggies about 1 hour after the meat has had a chance to cook some on it's own or they may come out too mushy.  Great coming home with dinner already cooked and no oven or stove cooking to heat up the house in the hot summer!  Thanks for this one!

I am not a huge fan of pot roast but found this to be excellent. Even better than my mother's (who's the best cook I know). It makes an excellent gravy and the vegetables were great. Came home from work and dinner was ready. The only modification I made was to use one can cream of mushroom garlic flavour and one regular can and omitted the garlic powder. Definitely will make it again

It actually turned out very well, but I have to say I was skeptical while it was cooking.  The roast itself, very good.
I think I would add the vegetables about halfway into cooking because they were a bit mushy for me.  I would make it again.  It's gonna make delicious sandwiches for tonight's dinner!

The beef came out nice and tender but this was way, way too salty for me.  Maybe try adding some red wine as others suggested, or make one of the soup additions a low sodium one.

This was AWESOME!  I was expecting a "white" gravy, but it was a perfect brown, beefy, gravy.  For you non-mushroom lovers out there, honestly, you wouldn't really taste the mushrooms. I love mushrooms, but my husband doesn't, and he loved it.

I used reduced fat and reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup.  I also deglazed the pan with 2 tbsp. of red cooking wine.  I then put my vegetables in, and added another 3 tbsp. of the wine on top of the vegetables, and put salt, pepper, and garlic powder on the vegetables.

I put baby carrots, whole mushrooms, and fresh green beans in.  I didn't put potatoes in, but instead I made homemade garlic mashed potatoes.  I also cooked this on low for 9 hours, which made the roast VERY tender and almost falling apart.

This does make a lot of gravy.  I think I'll use the left over with cube steak.

Enjoy!

Such a great recipe for those of us just starting out with a crockpot!  I substituted minced garlic, and rubbed that on the meat with fresh ground black pepper, and I found baby carrots on sale so that's what got thrown in the mix.  The meat was so tender, it fell apart as we ate!

Very good roast! I used sirloin tip roast (not sure what cut of meat is a bottom round roast...sorry) and also added some chopped celery in addition to the other veggies. Also, I cooked this at 350 in my oven for 1 1/2hrs and it turned out great. Meat was cooked through but very moist & flavorful.

I don't know who said that this will serve 12, because I bet it would barely serve 6.  There were 4 of us and we at it all.

Anyways, the meat tasted very good.  The gravy was a little tangy, but still good.  The vegetables were all cooked to a good texture.  I will probably use less onion soup mix next time, as I suspect this is what overpowered the gravy and gave it the tangy flavor.

This is the best roast recipe that I have ever tried.  I didn't have time to cook it on Low, so I tried it on High for 5 hours, added a little Montreal Steak Spice to the Roast when I seared it...the kids loved it. The Best!

This was super easy and delicious.  I used a bottom round roast that I had in my freezer.  I also followed the advise of others and browned the meat first and deglazed the pan with just a few tablespoons of beef broth.  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was right on.  Tender moist and delicious.  As my family is a fan of spices, I added my usual:  Lawyrs Season Salt, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder, Black Pepper, Dry Basil, Dry Thyme.  I also added one can full of water to the mushroom/onion soup mixture.  This gave the resulting gravy the right consistency (no need to thicken).  I would make no other change to this recipe.  Jaque, thanks for sharing.

This roast was well-seasoned, but more slightly more salty flavored than I prefer.  This was my second attempt at pot roast and overall a success.  Cooked on high with veggies and all in about 5 hrs! The searing definitely makes a difference in the flavor and moisture. I used beefy onion soup mix and think I will use regular onion mix next time.  That may have been where the extra salt came from. I think I will also add fresh herbs too for more taste. Very tender!

An excellent recipe! This is so easy to make as well...I used a 2.7 oz. sirloin tip roast, and added about eight extra potatoes, so that it would stretch enough to feed my big family. I didn't have any cream of mushroom soup, so I used one can of cream of celery soup and one of creamy roasted garlic mushroom soup. This gave the roast a great flavor, and it was extremely tender! I cooked it high for about 6 hours, because I didn't think it would be done on time when cooked on low. Altogether, this is a great, easy recipe that I'll make again! My family loved it...thanks for sharing!

Very easy to make and the family really liked it. I didn't bother browning the meat beforehand, and it was fine. Also, when I took the meat out to rest for 15 minutes before carving, I removed the vegetables and kept them warm and added a mixture of 2 tbsp flour kneaded with 2 tbsp margaine to the slow cooker. I put the lid back on and turned it up to high and ended up with delicious gravy for the meat. Thanks!

Not as special as I anticipated.  Maybe a bottom round roast was not the best cut to use?  At this point I'll stick with what already works.

This was excellent!  I didn't have 2 cans of mushroom soup so I used one cream of celery and one cream of mushroom. I crushed about 5 cloves of garlic and threw that in too.  I omitted the potatoes but put a handful of baby carrots and whole mushrooms about half way through.  I had a 3 lb chuck roast that I seared with red wine and olive oil.  I cooked it in the crock pot on medium for about 8 hours.  It came out wonderfully and I served it over mashed potatoes.  I also made gravy out of the leftover sauce in the pot.

Super easy! Fool proof. I made it exactly and the meat was very tender. I cooked it for 9 hours on low in the crockpot. I want to add mushrooms next time and there will be a next time! Thanks for the great recipe!

I cooked the roast for about 8 1/2 hours, adding my vegetable a little less than half way through. After it was done, I added a little cornstarch to some of the gravy to thicken it. For some reason my roast was somewhat tough, not at all tender...but the gravy with the potatoes and carrots were awesome!

I used a 1.75lb piece of london broil and as suggested, I browned it first.  Not sure if that matters or not.  I added 1 can cream of mushroom soup and the dry soup mile.  I also poured in some red wine since I had a bottle open.  I cut up onions and celery with the potatoes and carrots.  I think I had this on high for at least 5 hours.  I loved it since it was so easy and tasted yummy!

Delicious!  My 1 year old even ate it all up!  Beef was nice and tender and just fell apart and all I added was chopped onions.  Will definitely make again and I'm not even big on red meat!!

If I could give this 4.5, I would. Good comfort meal but not over the top. Very easy. I left the red potatoes whole, cut the carrots in half and added fresh mushrooms. Will probably make again.

Good, Tender Roast like down-home cooking. This was good. I did add salt, pepper, basil, tbsp of cajun spice to taste. I also added minced onions and parsley. Great Sunday Dinner! The vegetables really come out great and full of flavor and the meat is very tender. Thanks.

Delicious! I used a blade roast instead. Seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and Worcestershire sauce then browned over medium heat. I de-glazed the pan with a splash of red wine to make sure none of the yummy bits were left behind. I also combine the canned soups and the soup mix in the same pan to ensure all the flavour is absorbed. I like to add sliced mushrooms to this too. I don't usually make the carrots and potatoes in the slow cooker with it though since mine isn't that big. I roast them separately in the oven with a few seasonings or make a mash them when the roast is nearly done. For an alternative to the potatoes you can serve this over egg noodles.

This is the first pot roast I have done in my new slow cooker.  I had a 3.5 pound bottom roast and it was done in 6 hours.  I put in carrots, potatoes and a whole white onion at the beginning and they were perfect, not overdone at all.  My only complaint is that I felt the meat was overshadowed by all the other flavors??  I like my roast beef to have a beef flavor and while very tender, the meat flavor didn't come through.  I loved the sauce it created, but my boyfriend was looking for more of an "au jus" sauce.

I think I may have goofed on this recipe.  I added about 2 cups of water to the soup mixture because it seemed to me that it would all evaporate if I didn't.  The veggies were fabulous but the meat came out very tough.  Was adding the water a bad move?  Is there a blog on this site for questions?  I'd love to hear from someone who knows where I goofed.  I will try it again without water and see what results.

This dish was delicious!  The kids thought it was great, including my teenage daughter who doesn't really care for meat!  I did make some substitutions, though, since I had no dry onion soup mix on hand.  Instead of the onion soup mix, I added 1 tspn onion powder, 4 tspn (or 4 cubes) of beef bouillon and 1/4 tspn celery salt.  I also added a whole onion, cut up into 1/8's, with the potatoes and carrots.  Definitely a recipe to use again and again.  Thank you!

This recipe was so easy and tasted great.  My family loved it.  I didn't add any potatoes or carrots because I served it with mashed potatoes. The gravy on the mashed potatoes was fabulous. The meat was so tender.  I only cooked it in the crock pot for a little over 4 hours because of time, but it was great.  Cooking it longer would have made the meat even tenderer.  Highly recommend this recipe.

This is a recipe that I used as a newly wed before crock pots were around and still use it to this day. We used chuck roast when the budget called for restraint and it still was wonderful. The mixture of cream of mushroom soup and dried onion soup can be used over a pork roast as well.

Went to make this again, as I remake everything I gave five stars too, and noticed out of the three grocery stores I went to none of them had onion soup mix. I'm sure it's probably still just as good, but skipping the remake. 9/9/2008 My boyfriend loved this pot roast, he just could not stop talking about how good it was.

My 10 year old daughter and I were choosing a meal to cook together.  I already had a roast and it was hot so I was looking for a slow cooker recipe.  I showed her the pic but didn't tell her the ingredients (afraid the mushroom soup would scare her away).  When it came time to cooking it, I added about a half can of water to the soup mix and told her to just give it a chance.  I was scared, but in the end it was SOOOOO good.  She ate it, gravy and all and so did her also picky 7 year old brother.  For leftovers (which there wasn't much.  My Husband couldn't quit eating it either) we had mashed potatoes and used the gravy on top of those.

Wonderfully tender beef!  Veggies would have been better if I could have added them halfway through cooking, as they were overcooked a bit.  Will try keeping pieces of veggies on the larger side. Delicious gravy, be liberal with the salt!

Delicious! I made the rump roast w/ au jus last time, and I wasn't completely happy with it. This, however, turned out great. I used one can cream of mushroom and the other cream of mushroom and roasted garlic. I also added a little paprika to the roast on top of the s&p and garlic powder. Cooked for 6 hours and it was very tender an flavorful. Didn't add the veggies, but served over mashed potatoes. My husband loved it!

5 stars with the following modifications: I added the veggies half way through the cooking & they were perfect (if you cook the entire time, they will be overcooked).  I added about 12 whole button mushrooms, a small onion quartered, and a couple cloves of minced garlic.  Also only used one can of cream of mush soup, 1/2 cup red wine, and 1/4 cup water.  The flavor was awesome.  Salt to taste when done.

This was almost a five-star recipe, but the gravy tasted canned even after all the add-ins. Other than that, though, this was great! The meat was so delicious and tender, and the veggies absorbed a lot of flavor (I tossed in some pearl onions, baby bella mushrooms, and celery). I also used rosemary and sage from the garden. I'll use this idea again, but will experiment with the gravy more next time.

AMAZING!!!  This is the first time I ever made a roast and it turned out PERFECT!!!  We had friends over and everyone LOVED it.  I couldn't believe it - the most deliscious gravy just magically appeared when it was done!!  
I did use extra potatoes (yukon gold) and carrots and I threw in a couple of onions too.  Other then that I followed the recipe to a T and I will definetely make it again and again!

This was wonderful...the only changes I made were, I used golden mushroom soup instead, and only one can.  I seared the roast after rubbing the seasonings on it, then, as suggested by another reviewer, added the soup to the pan I seared in and then poured it over the roast.  I will use this again and again.  Thanks Kathy for showing me how to make an inexpensive piece of beef tender and juicy.

GREAT recipe!  I only had one can of cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of celery instead.  Next time I will use the two cans of cream of mushroom that the recipe calls for, as I prefer a stronger mushroom flavor.

This came out good, but was too salty for us! Used a chuck roast - added celery and the other veggies with about 3 hours to go - and then frozen peas in the last half hour. Maybe use no salt soup? By the way, I am usually not a fan of recipes using canned soup but the gravy did come out good and my husband liked it. Not sure if I will make again yet.

I've been making pot roast for many years and had never tried this recipe. It was outstanding! I used a chuck roast instead of bottom round. I also coated the roast with flour before browning, and I used Golden Onion Soup mix because that's what I had on had. It was a big hit with the family. Will definitely make this one again!

This was delicious!! This makes such a nice gravy.  I did add more potatoes, and some celery, and used Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic Soup.  A big hit in my house!  I will definitely be making this again.  My husband is already talking about picking on the leftovers tonight, and we just finished eating.  Thanks for sharing!!

Delicious!! I only used 1 can of condensed soup and it came out great! I cooked this on high for 7 hours in the crock pot and the meat was so tender and flaky, that we didn't even need to use our knives! I will definitely be making this again.

I loved everything except the meat. I added my carrots, potatos and onions 2 hours after starting the meat. The meat was VERY hard to chew and very dry. I'm not sure what went wrong. The "gravy" was awesome as well. I used 1 1/2 cans of french onion soup instead of the dry onion soup. Other than the meat the rest was great.

My family loved it and it was so easy. Perfect for a busy family who wants a hot winter meal when they come home. Just boil the potatoes before putting them in the slow cooker or they aren't cooked through when the meat was done.

This is the best roast I have ever made! Cook time was perfect. Very tender and juicy meat. Veggies done to perfection. I did increase amount of carrots and potatoes, worried they might be undercooked but it was fine. Gravy consistency is perfect as well.

This is a perfect recipe for roast beef. It was ultra-easy and the meat and vegetables were tender, flavorful and delicious. Maybe the best part was the yummy gravy--perfect over potatoes or rice. Will be making this one regularly! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This recipe makes great roast and gravy with very little effort!  I am always looking for good slow cooker recipes for my family that I can start in the morning and let cook all day while we go out and do things on the weekends.  This makes a great meal to come home to!  I'm a mushroom lover, so I add some sliced, fresh mushrooms and some sliced onion to the pot when I add the carrots and potatoes.  Then I put some rolls in the oven at the end, and it's an easy, delicious meal!

I thought that this recipe was really bland.  I was kind of dissapointed after all of the good reviews.  Maybe next time I will try adding red wine like some of the other reviewers did.

Very excellent taste.  The vegetables turned out just right.  My roast was a bit overcooked unfortunately and I used the low setting for 5 hours, my slow cooker tends to cook fast though.  Next time I will decrease the cooking time a bit.  Will definately make this again.

This recipe is wonderful, wait till you walk in the door after a long hard day at work and you smell this cooking and all you have to do is get out some plates!  I use Campbells roasted garlic mushroom soup mix and Liptons garlic mushroom dry soup mix to an added zip!

Delicious. I'm not sure why everyone is saying that the vegetables were mushy (my family happens to like mushy vegies), they weren't. I followed the recipe cooking time and the meat came out tender and the vegetables were toward the firm side. The gravy added the final perfect touch.

Very good.  Plenty of gravy (I only used a 2 lb roast.)  Next time, I'll make mashed potatoes instead of putting them in the crock and use the gravy with those.  Or, just put more potatoes in the crock pot.  Very easy and delicious.  Thanks!

I dont make Roast Beef much because my husband doesn't care for beef.  Even he thought this was tasty!  I served it for New Years dinner and everyone thought it was very tender and flavorful.  Carrots a little softer than I would have liked, will add them later in the process next time.  Otherwise it was great.

I have to say I will be making this again!  What a hit!  My husband and I loved it!  The gravey was so flavorful!  I added a little dill since we both like dill.  This is the best roast I have ever made.  I did cook the vegies in a separate pot since I didn't want them to be mushy.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipie!  YUM!

This was great! I tried to save time and cook for 3 to 4 hours on high -- it worked, but the meat was not as tender as I'm sure it would be if cooked on low for twice as long.  Great flavor however, and a quick easy meal.  I will definitely try this one again!

I am an 85 year old man and care for my wife.  My son and his family came for dinner(3 teenagers). The meat was falling apart, and the veggies were perfect.  Everybody complimented me even the teens.  
Thank You Kathy (my wife's name is Kathryn)

This was quite tasty!  I didn't sear it this time, but will try it next time as our roast was a tad dry.  I had it cooking for about 7.5 hours on low in a 3-quart slow cooker.  Because my cooker was so small (I thought I had a larger one!), I only did the roast and the sauce ingredients.  I omitted the carrots and potatoes, then just roasted them in the oven using another recipe.  I'm glad I skipped them because the soups got fairly close to the top.  I was home all day, keeping an eye on it, otherwise I would never have risked it.  For the soups I did one lower sodium mushroom soup, and one garlic mushroom.  I thought the gravy was delicious but probably still could have lowered the salt even more.  After the roast was done, I pulled it out to rest for a bit, then added a slurry of 3 tbsp cornstarch and 3 tbsp of cold water.  That immediately thickened it up.  Overall, yummy and easy recipe I'd make again (hopefully in a larger slow cooker!).

This recipe turned out terrific, my husband thought it was great!  But I did mix the soups and onion soup mix in a bowl, then spread half on the bottom of the pot, then the rest over the meat. Seemed to have worked well.

The recipe says to cook on low 6 to 8 hours. I took it out at 6.5 and should have kept it in longer. The beef was tough and stayed in a big hunk, until I cut it up and shred the parts that were moist enough. The carrots and potatoes were still a little crunchy. As far as the taste, I felt it was a bit bland. I think a different cut of meat and cooking on high, along with maybe adding some onions could improve it.

Good recipe!  It was very easy to make.  I put it in the slow cooker for about 9 hrs but I used more potatoes than the recipe called for.  The only thing I did different was I used onion powder in addition to the garlic powder and pepper to season the roast before browning.  I will definitely be making this again.

Awesome pot roast! One of the best roasts I've ever made. I almost forgot to take a picture I was so excited to dive in lol. when it was done cooking I did have to mix in some water and cornstarch to thicken it up a bit and then let it cook a little longer. I will deffinetly be making this again.

Really good roast beef and veggies.  I skipped the browning and it still turned out really flavorful.  I also used a tri tip roast following the suggesting from another roast beef recipe that I use.  The gravy was a little soupy, so I added some flour to thiken it up, and used french/crusty bread to sop it all up.  Really delish, comfort dish.

Actually, this is the ONLY way I cook a roast anymore. I have simplified this by buyng canned whole potatoes, and frozen stew vegetables. The frozen veggies include potatoes, carrots, celery and small pearl onions.  After pan searing the meat on all sides, I place it in the crock pot, add 1 can cream of mushroom soup, 1 can of EITHER vegetable broth, OR beef broth, pour a generous amount of red wine into the pot, and then add a package of dried onion soup mix, and then the can(s) of potatoes, and the frozen stew vegetables.  Lately I have been adding a can of tomatoes and 1 can of  green beans, both drained.  When the roast and veggies are finished, (you can tell by the meat rising and the liquid is boiling), I then stir in some Kitchen Bouquet and add a little flour and water to thicken the 'gravy' and the roast is all ready.  I purchase a larger roast at either Sam's OR Costco, and its my habit to cut that roast in half and use only ONE half of the roast.  The other is kept in the freezer for a future new meal.  I never try to cook a roast in the oven anymore. In the crock pot, the meat is juicy, tender and has such a terrific flavor. The oven only dried out the meat and the veggies.
The crock pot roast is the best!  I have on hand a lot of those spice bottles now for hamburger, or steaks, etc, and I sprinkle some of each type into my masterpiece.  Hubby and grandson LOVE it when I make a roast now.  After the initial meal, you have a quick and easy stew to be reheated.

great recipe. I used a 4 pound bottom round roast. in slow cooker for 10 hrs. added some quartered sweet potatoes in addition to small red potatoes. also added frozen pearl onions, baby carrots(all I had). I also used a low sodium, low fat cream of mushroom soup (x2) and added more mushrooms, garlic cloves.  house smelled fabulous. searing the meat first is a must.

This was my very first slow cooker meal, and I have to say I'm hooked! I did make a few simple changes: used Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom soup to control the sodium content, put 3 whole garlic cloves in the soup mixture before putting the meat on top of it, and added some celery chunks. I served it with garlic bread and it was a real hit with my family.

This was just average for us.  Nothing really set it apart as a great roast recipe.

The only changes we made was to reduce the Cream of Mushroom soup to one can and added onions and celery. Delicious and tender.. and such a wonderful smell to come home to on a cold night!

Finally, a roast I didn't mess up.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because it was a little on the bland side.  I'll add onions next time, and probably a little more seasonings, but over all, a great roast recipe!

This is a great basic Roast recipe! A lot like mine except I always add a couple dash's of a good Bourbon (I use bourbon when I cook A LOT! Adds a smoky sweetness and all the alcohol cooks out!) and a dash of Hickory Liquid Smoke along with a teaspoon or so of chopped roasted Garlic  to add additional flavor! My husband hates cooked carrots so I just use Potatoes and Onion instead.

It seemed a bit dry when I served it as a traditional roast. The next day I used the leftovers for sandwiches with some bbq sauce and it was AMAZING! The roast I bought was 4 pounds and I cook for 2 so I cut it in half and put the other half in the freezer. Maybe if I decrease the cooking time it will turn out better. I definitely plan on trying this again, especially for the leftover sandwiches!

Excellent! Followed recipe except I cut up an onion and sauteed it with some minced garlic after browning roast. I also put in a bag of frozen stew vegetables instead of carrots when I added potatoes and a Bay Leaf. Cooked 6-1/2 hours and the meat was tender and juicy. I removed roast and tented it with foil and added some cornstarch to thicken sauce in the crockpot.  It made a delicious "vegetable" gravy.  I sliced the roast and returned it to the crockpot and served it from there.  No need for extra pots and pans.

Came out looking just as beautiful as the picture posted but, it was missing something flavor wise?

Maybe I'll stud it with some cloves and add a couple of bay leaves and oh ya,  some VINO next time.

Total cook time= 7 hours in a 7qt. cooker

Meat very tender and vegetables were super soft and yummy, just the way I like them!:)

I followed the recipe exactly and it was ok.  The meat was a little chewy and the canned soup made it VERY salty.  I don't add salt to anything so it was too much for me.  My husband agrees.  I won't use this recipe again.

Very tasty and easy. I put big chunks of carrot into the crockpot and they cook just fine. Used the lo-fat cream of mushroom and still good. Also added some quartered onion, and I deglazed the browning pan with 1/2 cup of leftover coffee and added that too. Makes lots of yummy gravy.

I followed this recipe exactly as it was written.  Although the meat was tender and delicious, the "gravy" that the soups made was much too thick for our liking.  Had I know, I would have put a can of watere in it. I probably won't make this again.

I was disappointed in this roast, especially after reading all the rave reviews.  I used a sirloin tip roast (because that's what BF bought).  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  The meat cooked nicely, but I thought the gravy was dull and tasted like cardboard.

I have two other tried-and-true pot roast recipes, and I think I'll stick with those.

My local supermarket had pork loin on sale for less than $2/lb, so I used a 3 lb. pork roast instead, and it turned out great!  I seasoned with onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper and seared as directed.  I did add fresh mushrooms to the pot, but other than that I followed as directed.  I was nervous at first; I don't have a huge crock pot and it was filled to the top, but as it cooked, it reduced some.  I was a little short on time so I cooked it for 3 hours on high and 1 hour on low, which seemed to work perfect.  Freezes well, and I think the leftovers are better than the first time around!  My boyfriend and I loved this one.

I'm giving this a 4 star, although it probably only rates a 3 because of the canned and dry soups that are used. So, the rating is for the recipe, not my changes. I didn't use garlic powder (can't have), and I added some red wine on the bottom of the crock pot (about a 1/4 of a cup). I poured another 1/2 a cup of wine and about a cup of water over the top of the meat. (For a three pound London Broil.) I ended up having to take this out of the slow cooker after three hours because of time constraints. I knew that even though I cooked it on high, it wasn't going to be fork tender like I like. I placed in a pan and cooked, covered in my oven at 350 degrees. I used the smallest sized baby carrots. They are smaller than a pencil.
Used yukon golds for the potatoes. When done, I shredded the beef and distributed it through the gravy and vegetables.
I took this to a big birthday celebration. I knew there were going to be many pasta dishes, so I wanted to do something different that wasn't going to take me long to prepare. I really thought I would have lots of leftovers. There was only one serving left. My husband will get that for dinner tonight. It was the hit of the party. So many of the pasta dishes had only a couple of servings taken out of them, that I was glad I made the choice of making this. My meat wasn't dry, not greasy, and received raved reviews as people wanted to know who had brought it, and how to make it. While I normally don't use canned soups or dry onion soup, the

I just made this for dinner last night.  I put it together before work in the crockpot and then about an hour before dinner I added the potatoes and carrots.  I didn't 'follow' this recipe meaning this is already one of the ways I make a pot roast.  I do thicken the gravy with a little cornstarch and water (on the stove.)  My husband and sons are big 'meat and potatoes' kind of men and they loved it!

This was an excellent recipe.   Family loved it!  I didn't have the dry onion soup mix so I substituted a package of Dry Beefy Onion Mix instead and added about 1/2 cup of water to the mix.  I also did't add vegetables to mine because I cooked vegetables on the side due to the fact that my meat was mostly frozen in the beginning and I was scared that I'd overcook my veggies.  I still cooked the frozen meat in the oil probably about 30 minutes vice 20.  I cooked my meat on high in the crockpot for about 3 1/2 hours and then on low for about 4 hours.  It turned out nice and tender and the gravy was excellent.  Recommend this to anyone.  Next time I will defrost my meat!  g.b. Goose Creek, SC

I made this for Sunday dinner & had almost no leftovers.  My boyfriend kept saying how good it was & even had 3 helpings.  He wants me to make it again next Sunday.  The only thing I did was add some beef broth to make the gravy less thick.  .. I've made this over a dozen times since my original review & it is great everytime.  My BF is requesting it again this Sunday

This is my no-fail roast recipe! Delicious! My husband, dad, and father-in-law all love it. I actually use 3 or 4 cans of soup for extra gravy - the healthy request version of Campbells cream of mushroom soup to cut extra fat and sodium.

So easy and so good! My roast was 4 lbs. so I cooked on high for 4 hrs. and then on low for 3 hrs. Everything else was exactly as the recipe instructed. I've been hesitant to make a roast for years, but I'm so over that fear. The only thing I think that I will modify next time around is to substitute one can of crm. of mushrm with a low sodium crm. of mushrm. It was a tad too salty, other than that- great!

I browned on all sides but not for 20 minutes due to time constraints. Had no carrots and it cooked for 9 hours (while at work), stirred twice. This was so good, so easy, the roast was so tender. I took the potatoes and mashed them up (used what I had - russet) and served "mashed" potatoes with that yummy gravy. Will make this one again and again!

Very easy and very good.  The only things I changed were to use Yukon gold potatoes and roasted garlic cream of mushroom.  Turned out yummy.  It is nice to come home after work with the house smelling wonderful and dinner ready to eat.  Thank you this is a keeper.

This dish was very flavorful.  The meat just shredded on it's own.  It cooked in less time than recipe says.  I was expecting to eat at 8:00 and it was done before 6:00.  Excellent dish!

I thought this was great. I used chuck roast, cubed it to trim the fat, and that worked just fine. I added more carrots, used sweet potatoes instead, and added frozen peas about 10 minutes before serving. Big hit.

Very good! I was having a hard time getting the meat to be tender beforehand..but with this recipe it turned out great! I threw some garlic cloves in there, and I also seasoned the meat with a rub and I didn't sear it before putting it into the crock pot.

Great recipe. I've been looking for a roast recipe that I can use regularly and I am happy to say I have found it.  I gave 4 stars b/c the top of my roast that wasn't covered with the soup came out a bit dry.  Next time I will roll the roast in the soup to make sure all of it is covered and also maybe add some beef broth.

this gravy was out of this world!  SO EASY to make.  I did not put in potatoes- only carrots (I did not have any).  For some reason my crock pot ALWAYS dries ot my meat- but this one was still tasty- however on the drier side.  I even shortened the cooking time.  Thanks KATHY!

2 cans of soup was not enough to cover everything, i didn't have another can of soup so i added beef broth.  Meat is moist, but it has no flavor, i'm very disappointed, i wont be making this again.

First of all I din't sear the meat and I really don't think it made a difference. Also, I didn't realize I was out of onion soup mix until I was putting it together, so I added 3 medium sliced onions. I added potatoes and carrots also. This was good but not great. By the time it was done my cooker was almost filled to the top w/ the gravy. But I didn't find it that flavorful and it was very watery. I could have thickened it but as I didn't think it was that tasty I didn't even bother.

Great recipe! Meat was moist and tender.  So simple to make and so much flavour.  I rubbed fresh garlic into the meat instead of the powder, but other than that I didn't change a thing.  The potatoes took a bit longer to cook so I recommend not cutting the chunks too big.  I will definitely make this one again.

This is a great recipe - very flavorful and came out wonderful!!  I used the cream of mushroom w/garlic (as did another reviewer) and will probably add some red wine to the next one as well(Christmas Dinner).  My husband and 3yr old son gobbled it up (okay, so did I)!!:)

The overall flavor was good, much like Mom always made. I only added a little red cooking wine, as others had suggested, and thought the gravy was good. Added worcestershire to my plate, and will use some in the slowcooker next time. I searched for reviews of those who had tried cooking this on high, as I needed it to be ready for a lunchtime meal, and read of others' success. Don't make the mistake I did: I put it on high at 7:30, and by noon it still wasn't done. I had to nuke the whole thing, and ended up with tough meat. Also, I think you have to either cut veggies in large chunks, OR add them an hour later, because I tried doing both, and even nuked, they took much longer than the meat. Will try again for an evening meal.

I was really surprised, this turned out really good. I have not been successful making a roast but now found a recipe that works for me.  I added some onions with the potatoes and carrots (used the baby carrots in a bag).  The gravy turned out just as good!  Thanks Jaque:)

This has become a fmaily favorite.  I however, use a chuck roast to make this.  My family prefers the 'chuck' cut...and it works wonderfully in the slow cooker.  ( Ok it does fall apart..but when you are already cutting up the meal for little ones...this is a plus :-)   )

The roast was great, however the vegetables were kind of gross by the time it was done.  Next time I make this recipe, I will add the vegetables and hour or two before its done.

I followed the directions to a T. Meat turned out very dry. Had to soak it again in the gravy to get an edible meal. Cooked on low for 8 hours. Not sure what went wrong.

It is so easy to make!  I used a 7-bone steak which otherwise I don't know what to do with. I seared the steak while cutting the vegetables ( a lot of mushroom, baby carrots, potatoes and onion ), put everything in at once and left for work. By the end of the day, the meat had turned out quite favorable and very tender. I enjoyed it very much.

This was a "ok" recipe - nothing very different from other similar recipes.  I added mushrooms and a frozen veggie blend to the last hour of cooking to make it a more filling meal.

It's so easy and it comes out so tender and the
gravy it makes is killer.  I will never cook a
roast another way again.  You've saved me time
and energy. Thanks so much!!! Salute!!!!!!

This turned out very well!  You could cut the roast with a fork!  Very flavorful, my kids loved it!  (even one who doesn't like carrots, loved the carrots)  Definitely will be making this again.  It was very easy and very good!

Yes, you do need to make mashed potatoes with this because the gravy is so yummy! I stored the left overs in the left over gravy, and it made the meat even more tender the next day. I can't believe something this easy can be soooo good! Everyone is looking forward to our next roast beef dinner!

Everyone in my family loved this, including my 2 children. The 7 year old won't eat cooked carrots at all, even when I've cooked them with a roast in the past. She said these were good and had seconds. Lovely gravy, served it with buttermilk biscuits, yum! Had no problems with mushy veggies.

This is really simple, and quite tasty. I've added a few things here and there, but the foundation is great!

This roast was tender and so tasty! It makes a wonderful gravy that's great with dinner rolls too. The potatoes and carrots were mushier than I like, so next time I'll add them later during the cooking process...or  justleave them out and whip up some mashed potatoes to go with that GOOD gravy!Thanks, Jaque!

This was good, but it needed some tomato sauce or paste, I'll add that next time!

I heard all week from my husband "i dont like roast"  so i made it anyway and told him he could have something different.  My mother happened to stop over so i gave her a bowl full to take home since i would be the only one eating it.  Well to make this story short, my husband LOVED IT, and wanted to know if there were left overs for him to take to work.  He wanted it again already this week.  THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE!!!

This roast was the best I have ever had!!  It has so much flavor and even the 
vegetables are great!  We tried some of the other similar slow cooker recipes
for roasts, but this one has it down perfect!!
