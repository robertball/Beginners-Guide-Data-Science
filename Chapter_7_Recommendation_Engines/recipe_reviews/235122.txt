When it's hot and humid outside, we love to have an antipasto platter for dinner with a glass of wine. I made ours with proscuitto, mortadella, sopressata, olives, marinated artichoke hearts, fresh pearl mozzarella, grilled roma tomatoes, shards of fresh Grana PadanoÂ®, and my "Roasted Peppers in Oil" (recipe also on this site). Served it with grilled ciabatta. Delizioso!

This is a great dish to bring to a get together, or a gathering. My family always loved a good antipasto.

We LOVE these! The beauty of it is that you can put anything you have and make a great platter. Also, you can make this to serve 1 or 101. So simple and a nice light starter. Thanks for sharing. :)
