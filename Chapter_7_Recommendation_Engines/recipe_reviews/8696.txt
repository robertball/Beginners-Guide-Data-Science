This recipe was lovely!!

However, I have a few suggestions that might take it from great, to FANTASTIC!!

1) Boiling chicken often gives it a dry, less succulent, texture and flavor. I would suggest grilling the chicken in a pan, cutting it into cubes, and tossing it into the sauce once it has thickened. If time allows, you might like to marinade it in some lime juice, and maybe even a bit of tequila (along with the soy sauce). 


I found that I needed to add a little extra lime juice to the sauce... so definitely taste test before serving. If you like your food spicy, don't rely on the number of jalapenos given in the recipe to satisfy your craving for kick. Add more. If you're truly courageous... add some habanero... but that's only for the truly brave and daring!!

Otherwise I loved the recipe, I just thought the chicken could be a little more moist and flavorful. Fantastic dish. My italian father is very picky about "creative pasta" dishes... and he loved it!!

I made this for friends who love to cook!  We decided it was far too conservative and needed adjustments.

Use 1 cup of tequila with the 3 cups chicken stock for a glaze reduction, reducing 4 cups down to 1.5 cups.  

Use 3-4  whole limes for the juice, add this to the garlic and jal. peppers and cilantro,  which thickens and carmelizes the paste, and use olive oil instead of butter.  

Forget the soy sauce, not neccessary.

In Step 4-Combine paste and chicken, cook thru, then add cream last so it doesnt break down, and mix.  THEN, pour the reduction mix over the top, so that the flavors do not mix and are distinctive from one another.

Otherwise flavors are okay, just could be so much better!

This recipe was very similar to and just as good as the Sammy's Woodfired Pizza and California Pizza Kitchen versions, which I love.  My guests absolutely loved it and would not stop talking about it.  CAVEAT:  I personally would not have given this recipe 5 stars had I not read and heeded some of the advice of the reviews.  First of all, I doubled the jalapenos and it was still not too hot --- just much more flavorful.  I also put more lime and tequila in the chicken marinade.  Very important:  cooking the chicken in the method called for in this recipe yielded rubbery and overdone chicken.  Next time I will cut my chicken into strips and broil or grill them.  I will then throw them in at the end just to warm them up again.  One aesthetic consideration, too, is that the chicken marinaded in soy sauce gave it a rather unappealing color.  I would probably put the soy sauce in the sauce next time and not directly on the chicken.  Another important consideration:  don't cook onions and peppers until they are mushy or too limp.  I was careful to get mine done enough while maintaining a little body to them, and that was key. This recipe definitely was more time intensive and probably not good for a week night.  It is, however, a very special recipe and one you should try for your guests.

Found the cooking method to produce rubbery chicken, so back to the drawing board I went!  2nd time, I had leftover grilled chicken which I needed to use up and I doubled the cilantro, garlic, jalapeno pepper, stock, tequila, and lime juice which enriched the flavor.  Folded in the grilled chicken as the last step and it has now joined the ranks of "favorites" in our household!  Thank you Behr!

Our favorite pasta recipe!  We do double some of the ingredients: jalapeno, butter, stock, tequila, and lime juice...it makes more sauce and much more flavor.  The extra jalapeno does NOT make it too spicy (and I am a WIMP!!).  We also cook the pasta in chicken broth instead of water.  :)  YUMMMM!!

Very similar to CPK. It took a little longer to prepare than I anticipated but it was worth the wait.  I marinated chicken in balsamic vinegar instead of soy sauce and also went a little crazy with the peppers. I added one each of green, red, orange and yellow.  Delicious.

Well I made a mess with this recipe. After I started preparing it, I realized that my roomate drank the last of the tequila. I used beer instead, and it was still quite good. A wonderfully different meal to add a little kick to your kitchen.

I know I'm in the minority here but this was sooo BLAND!!! I doubled the lime juice, cilantro, jalapeno and tequila and still sooo bland. Considering how much this cost to make, how time consuming it was and how many dirty dishes it made it was totally not worth it.

oh my!  What a delicious dish!  So packed full of flavor, the insides of my mouth tingle just thinking about it! When I read the descriptions I thought it sounded just like the California Pizza Kitchen dish and yup, it is!

All I had was red peppers, and I had some of that fresh Butoni brand spinach fettucine, which really gave it a lot of color..I think if I were to use the regular pasta I would definitely use all three colors of bell peppers though. Step 1 takes a little longer than I expected, it took a while to get the sauce reduced to "paste-like consistency" stage. The chicken was already cooked and had to be set aside way before the reduction of the sauce was ready.  A little more labor intensive for a late weeknight dinner, but when we finally sat down to it, we agreed it was worth the wait.  

Next time, I'll make this wonderful dish on a Saturday!  Thanks Behr!

This is a wonderful dish.  We make this dish at least once every two weeks.  Add a little more jalipino and garlic for a little more kick.

Ohhhhh myyyyyy, great recipe! Tastes just like the one at California Pizza Kitchen!! Lovely as is but I made it a few times so got to play around with it a little. Definitely needed more lime (4 limes in total). Did a black pepper rub for the chicken and then marinated it in 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 2 tablespoons tequila, & 2 tablespoons lime juice. Added sliced mushrooms to the dish (in with the bell peppers and onions), used half and half instead of heavy whipping cream, and I like much more veggies in my dish so used a whole red onion, 2 green bell peppers, 1 red pepper and 1 yellow pepper, and 4 tablespoons minced jalapeno peppers (without seeds). Also upped the garlic (I love me a lotta garlic!) to about 4 tablespoons. Didn't find it salty enough for my taste so added like 1 or 2 teaspoons seasoned salt and 2 tablespoons soy sauce to the final product and heated through. FABULOUS DISH, can't get enough!

EXACTLY what I was hoping for! I bartend for a restaurant in Virginia, and one of the most sought after dishes is what the restaurant calls "Sauteed Filet Mignon Tips in Tequila Lime Sauce". The sauce is called "piquette" in Spanish which means the sauce is made with liquor. This recipe is identical to my restaurants recipe, except for the obvious substitution of chicken for the filet tips. Absolutely delicious. I only used about a half a pound of fettucini with the full amount of sauce, and I felt that it was perfect. Thank you for letting me re-create this dish at home!

I followed this recipe almost to a T, and we found it to be extremely bland.  It also required a bit of work, so I was diappointed.  I did follow one review and made more of the chicken stock/tequila paste.    We found it so dull we even added cayenne to try and pump up the flavor.

This meal was a big hit. I thought the jalapeno would make it too spicy for the kids, but it just added the right spice. My picky kids loved it. I will be making this one again. To cut the prep time I used frozen pepper strips from C&W instead of slicing all those peppers.

I gave this recipe to some friends and they in return gave it to their friends. This is my favorite.

Um... noooo. Although Behr doesn't specifically claim that this is a copycat of the famous chain's version, I had high hopes it would be. To my dismay, this didn't even come close. My experience at the restaurant FAR surpasses what I made tonight. For one, there was WAAAY too much pasta for the amount of sauce this recipe yielded. Even had there been enough sauce, it was very bland and unappetizing. To boot, the amount of prep time involved was no where NEAR worth the end result. After slicing, chopping, mincing, sauteeing, reducing and boilling pasta, I was looking forward to a restaurant-quality dinner and was terribly disappointed that it wasn't. When the craving strikes, I'll just visit my local CPK. Thanks anyways, Behr.

I thought this was very good. As others stated, I seasoned and sauted my chicken first, set it aside and I made everything in one pan. I sauted the garlic, onions, cilantro, jalepeno peppers first. Then added liquids. I didnt add the lime at all. I decided I would just cut a wedge and place it on the side of the plate and squeezed on each bite I took so that I had the fresh lime taste. I added cayenne pepper for more kick.  For those complaining of it being bland, you just have to doctor it up to provide more flavor. It was very good

Tasty dish.  Very different from the norm.  A tiny bit too spicy for my taste but my husband really enjoyed it.  Unless you like your food screaming hot I wouldn't add more hot peppers as some reviewers suggested.  I cooked the chicken separately, shredded it and added it to the sauce at the very end to warm it.  Turned out well.  I'll use a little more garlic next time.  Did take some time to prepare but worth it.

Awesome!  I read all the reviews and cut up the peppers, garlic and onion in the morning.  I marinated 3 half chicken breasts in the soy sauce, some lime juice and tequila and broiled them.  I sliced them thin and put them on top of the finished dish.  I also used campanelle pasta instead of linguini.  The results were specatular!  I felt like a chef cooking this...  the aroma was fantastic.  My husband (who hates cilanro) and two year old ate heartily.  (Some of you moms know what I mean here - there were no unsolicited compliments -- only clean plates - good enough for me!)

WOW! I made this tonight and my husband LOVED it! We are spicy food lovers so I added extra jalapeno pepper for an extra kick! The only change I made was I used half & half instead of heavy cream. I would not recommend dried cilantro - use fresh, as it makes a big difference in taste. Will make again soon and might try adding cheddar cheese!

I Love this recipe!  We recently had it at CAlif. Pizza Kitchen so came home and tried to replicate.  We used a jarred Alfredo Sauce but never thought to use the cream, soy sauce  or chicken broth.  Nice addition.  We did add chopped (chunks) of eggplant.  Not for everyone but we love it and it added that extra layer of texture.  We also added parm cheese because we add it to everything !  Thanks for sharing

This dish was unique and flavorful.  I followed the recipe with the exception of subbing half & half for the cream. One thing I thought it needed was salt; I added it to the sauce and the pasta water.

This was great! I was very surprised at the end result.. it didn't taste like what I expected it to! Very unique and pleasantly surprising taste. =) The only thing I did differently was broil my chicken and then serve it on top of the noodles, because I was afraid that boiling it in the mixture could dry it out. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was just because of the slight problem I had with excess grease because of the butter. At the end it seemed like the cream and the oils from the butter separated and it was a little unappealing. It didn't ruin it for me however, it was still excellent! Also I would just like to add that it only took me about 1 hour from start prep to finish and I was moving pretty slow and not in a hurry. So I disagree with the reviews I read that said it was a lot of work and time consuming. Quite the contrary in my opinion! =)

Yummy! This is delicious. My husband loved it too. There is a lot of prep involved. The actual cooking time isn't much. I marinated the chicken and soy sauce ahead of time-that's the only change I made. I will definately make this again. This recipe's right up there with cajun chicken pasta. LOVE IT!

Excellent recipe, but I would consider it as written just to be a good template - it's result is good, but has a lot of "negative space" that you can fill out. I haven't tampered with the ratios of pre-existing ingredients, but after some effort experimenting with this one, I came around to adding sliced bananas and diced ginger root to the paste saute with garlic, jals, ect., and chopped tarragon into the final mixture at the same time you recombine everything else with the cream. The bananas add a lush sweetness and golden-blonde hue and will dissolve to a great degree if not entirely during the cream boil, and the ginger accentuates the zesty/spicy aspect without being too obvious in the mix. I've tried a few different approaches to rounding out the flavor of this dish, and as a big fan of Thai and Indian cooking, these additions have made up my favorite variation so far. Aging my jalapenos to their orange-red blush developed also helped their spiciness prevail through all the cream in the dish and leave a pleasant radiant tingle in the aftertaste.

Delicious!  I left out the jalapenos and used a low fat cream substitute (low fat cottage cheese and powdered milk, pureed) to cut the fat content.  Very tasty.

Good basic recipe, but needs something to give it a little extra kick.  I made it according to the recipe this time, but will probably add more tequila and more jalapeno next time along with some cumin, coriander and red pepper.

This recipe has great potential! I just thought it was a bit bland. As recommended by other reviewers, I skipped the soy sauce and sauted the chicken vs. boiling it. Once I figure out how to pump up the heat, I'm sure this will become a regular at our dinner table.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  I almost followed it to a T, but made some minor adjustments.  First, I omitted the lime juice.  Second, I used a whole yellow pepper & omitted the green not only b/c it was cheaper to do so but also to keep the peppers more mild.  Third, I used just 3/4 cup of FF half/half instead of the heavy whipping cream.  It didn't need more than that.  Suggestion: Don't add cream until the bitter end for better/thicker consistency!

This was absolutely amazing! I'm so thankful that I tried it! A few changes: 1. I marinated the chicken for about 2 hours in a mix of soy sauce, lime juice, olive oil and tequila, about 1 or 2 tbspoons of each. 2. We love spicy..and  reviews said the heat from the japs cooked out. So I used 4 jalapenos and 1 haberno. It was perfect for our taste and we could even go spicier. 3. I added a little more cilantro, as we love that too. 4. Only used half the pasta called for, the amount of sauce was perfect. I prepped everything about 2 hours in advance and just threw together when I was ready to eat.  The cilantro/japs/tequila mixture takes about 15/20 mins to turn into a paste, be patient with it. Can't wait to make this again, my husband raved!!!!!

Wow! I  must say this was GREAT. I pretty much did everything exactly as said. BUT, I marinated the chicken for about an hour or two in Soy Sauce, lime juice, tequila (about 1 TBSP), and olive oil. Then I grilled it and put it aside. Once I had the sauce simmering (towards the end when I put all things together with the whipping cream) I added the chicken (that I cut into 1 inch pieces) and let it simmer in about 10 minutes. I only used 8oz (1 cup)of heavy whipping cream. And it was perfect!

I will make this again, but with double the garlic/jalapeno/lime/tequila sauce mixture to the original 1 and 1/2 cups cream. This is because I like lots of sauce! Start reducing the "paste" right away, because it does take quite awhile to boil down. I think it was worth the wait, though-- and it's actually a very straight-forward recipe.

Family loved this dish.  Used homemade fettuccini which was wonderful.  Next time, I will use more jalapenos and marinate the chicken in lime juice instead of soy.

Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! PLEASE follow the recipe as is.  Don't assume the first time that you make it that it would be better with this or without that.  Do that the second time if you feel the need.  Thanks Behr for an AMAZING recipe.  Are you a professional chef?  I cannot imagine how you came up with the unusual/amazing combination of ingredients.  I will try any recipe that you submit.  My boyfriend LOVED it.    This recipe made me look dang good.I can't wait to cook this for everyone I know.

Loved this so much that this is the first time I felt complled to write a review.  My suggestions: Chicken- don't overcook the chicken- it does get rubbery fast, and this would also be good with grilled shrimp, The Paste- I would double these ingrdients or maybe do 1 and 1/2 of what the recipe calls need a bit more of a kick (and I don't even like my food really hot!!), Cream- I used Fat Free Half & Half and it was still very good but need to add cornstarch.  My boyfriend loved it so much that he cleared his plate two times!

Be warned: This recipe is time-consuming and complicated - and there will be lots of dirty dishes to clean up afterwards! But for a very special meal, it's well worth the trouble. The flavors are amazing - every bite discovers a new, suprising nuance. And the smell that fills your house while you're toiling away. Mmmmmm. This is really fine-restaurant quality.

This was a very tasty dish, but I thought it needed more spice.  I would add more jalapenos next time.  My chicken dried out, but I wanted the chicken shredded so I baked it first, probably better to follow the recipe.  My boyfriend loved it.

This was an excellent recipe.  I rarely make pasta dishes, and was very pleased with how this one turned out!  I took previous reviewers' suggestions and marinated the chicken for about 5 hours in soy sauce, tequila and lime juice.   

The only suggestion i would make would be to used slightlt more jalapeno, as i did not find it very spicy (however, that could be because the amount of marinade i ended up with was more than the recipe called for, which diluted the jalapeno).

This dish was excellent! Very tasty. I did marinate the chicken first, then pan grilled it. I then shredded it with a fork before it was finished cooking and added it to the thickened sauce to finish cooking (shredded chicken holds on to more of the sauce than cubed chicken). Also, be sure to allow enough time for the sauce to thicken - otherwise, it will be too thin and soupy. I tried it with one jalapeno and agree that it could use another without being too spicey. This recipe is a keeper!!

Thank you for a fantastic recipe! We loved it and will definitely be making it again. Be sure your pan isn't too hot when you add the broth, lime juice, and tequila. Mine was which resulted in  scalding and burning. Easily remedied.

This was great! I was able to use fresh jalapenos, cilantro and peppers from my garden. My husband loved it too. He's a spaghetti lover so I substituted thin spaghetti for the fettucine. The only thing I'd like to do different is figure out how to shred raw chicken and add to recipe. I think the texture would have been better than cubed.

My roommate and I made this recipe for some of our guy friends.  They begged to take the left-overs home.  With two people to do all the work, it goes much quicker!

I have made this recipe SO many times, and let me just say it is FABULOUS! I do however use more cilantro, garlic, jalapeno, and peppers than it calls for. I also add a cornstarch mixture to the sauce before serving to thicken it up.

This was an instant hit at my house.  I like bold flavor so I doubled the jalapeno, tequilla, and lime juice, plus tossed in the lime zest just before serving.  So Yummy!

My husband and I made this recipe as written tonight and thought it was delicious.  I will make it again but the only thing I would do differently is either eliminate or severely cut back on the soy sauce.  It is a very intense flavor and masks all the beautiful flavors of the tequila and lime; by the end it seemed more like teriyaki fettucine than anything to do with tequila. The next time I make it I will let the chicken sit in tequila and lime juice and add some soy sauce in with the cream, but less than a tablespoon for sure.  Otherwise this was a stellar dish!

OMG!  I am in love.  I made this for my best friends Bday dinner cuz we have both been wanting to try it.  It was AMAZING!  Like beyond amazing.   Its not as heavy as you would think, the lime and cilantro kept it feeling really fresh. I marinated the chicken in the soy sauce and some lime juice and diced it up before cooking.  I suggest doing all your prep first and start your water boiling for the pasta right away so its ready to go by the time you add the chicken in.  We didnt have jalepenos to add so i put in poblanos.  tasted the sauce. no heat but tasted amazing but needed something. so i put in about 8-10 dashes of Cholula hot sauce.   That was it!  Over the top!  MAKE THIS TODAY!  You wont be sorry!

I really enjoyed the flavor of the sauce! I had some shrimp to cook so I used shrimp instead of chicken and I added mushrooms and some thinly wedged campari tomatoes towards the end - yummy! I do want to play with the recipe to get a lower fat version out of it, but in general this was pretty fabulous!

This recipe is incredible! The only thing I do differently is double, sometimes triple the amount of jalepeno, and cook the chicken all the way before adding it to the sauce. This is deffinantly one of my favorite recipes and I will be making it over and over again. Yum!!

This wasn't too bad, but it wasn't great either! I chopped & prepped the chicken & veggies the day before so it wouldn't take as much time to make. I made exactly as written but use all my peppers instead of just half of them. The sauce was soo runny & sloppy it needed to be a little thicker. It also needed some spicing up it was a tad bland. Wasn't terrible but not worth making again, in my opinion.

I thought this was VERY bland and the soy sauce was over powering. Anytime you boil cream it will be near impossible to thicken. I had to add corn starch. Will not make again.

Love it! Just made it for a house hold of 8 people Everyone loved it, said it's just like the CPK version. Definitely on the make again list. My fiancée said I have to make it for his family when we visit. I went a little lighter on it though, a half cup less of the heavy cream and about two tablespoons less butter, and there was still more than enough sauce.

I, like others, doubled up on the garlic and jalapenos.  I also added some Cholulla hot sauce.  They even make a cholulla hotsauce with lime that is perfect with this dish.  This is by far one of my favorite dishes to cook and eat!

This dish is delicious! However, I did saute the chicken prior to adding to the cream sauce and next time I will add more jalepenos to make it spicy.

This dish is excellent! I have to admit that I changed it quite a bit, but not because I thought I could improve upon it.  I used vegetable broth instead of chicken stock. Morningstar "chicken" stips instead of actual chicken. Substituting the chicken dramatically changes how the reciepe is prepared. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it turned out fabulous. A great alternative to traditional Italian pasta dishes. Will make again & again. Thank you for such a great idea!

Wonderful!  I made one change.  I marinated the chicken in the soy and tequila.  I cooked the chicken before my guests arrived.  I later cubed the chicken and put in the sauce to reheat.  It was a big hit!

Fantastic!  We increased both the amount of lime and the amount of tequila, which required extra time for the sauce to take on the required consistency, but was well worth it.  We also used a ridiculous amount of garlic, but that's par for the course with us.  Furthermore, for all of those like me who are scared that the jalepenos will make this dish too spicy, we used (just under) the recommended amount and could not taste them AT ALL.  Definitely a winner.

We loved this.  I took the advice of another reviewer, used 1 cup of tequila with the 3 cups chicken stock and reduced down to approx 1.5 cups total. I used 3-4 whole limes for the juice.  I just wish the recipe made more sauce, because it was so yummy.

This recipe was delicious. I would have given it 5 stars except it needed a little more flavor. Possibly a tablespoon more garlic. I added fresh sliced mushrooms. Great choice for my fresh peppers & chicken I bought at the store!

The taste of tequila and cilantro was mild - too mild for us. As a result, everything tasted good, but seriously lacked a WOW factor. It was similar to the other 10 or so recipes we have tried with chicken and peppers. I give it 5 stars because, really, I can't find a fault in this dish, but I would expect this different combination to amaze me - unfortunately it didn't.

Couple of slight changes made-- used 1/2 cream and 1/2 milk to replace the 1 1/2 c cream, did not have yellow peppers and used the jalapenos that are in a jar-- 2 tbsp chopped up. We had this dish a couple of days ago and are still talking about how good it was. Even reheats well for a pasta dish. Will keep on top of the recipe stack! Thank you for sharing.

With all the flavors I was expecting so much more, especially that cilantro lime paste that came out so tasty! Maybe I will take the advice of another reviewer and double up on it. That paste gave me the hope for a 5 star, alas, didn't have the wow factor here so I gave it a good deserving 3.

Fantastic dish.  We followed the advice of others and doubled the amount of jalapeno peppers - that gave it just the right kick.  Also, I sauteed the veggies in olive oil, not butter. My husband loves spicy food, and he declared this to be his new favorite meal.

This was a great recipe!  My wife and I loved it.  I think next time, I will use a few different peppers (maybe some serrano, poblano, and jalapeno) for a more complex flavor.  Not quite spicy enough for my family as listed.  But that is easily remedied.  Thank you for this wonderful addition!

I have had this dish in restaurants, and this recipe is comparable. Very tasty, although leftovers are a little oily. Overall an impressive dish for company or family!

I made this for several family members when on vacation.  Was a bit of time consuming...but worth all of the time.  Allow plenty of time.  I have been told that I'm a bad cook, and I was able to do this...anyone can!  My stepmother also made this, and loved it.  She made it for a dinner party.

This was a pretty good recipe as described, but when I made it a second time, I marinated the chicken in more lime juice and soy sauce overnight. I was astounded at how flavroful the peppers were in the mix. VERY nice touch...

We like spicy food so we added one more jalapeno and it turned out fabulous! This recipe makes a lot of food so there were leftovers for a few days after and they tasted great. Will definitely do this one again.

This is a wonderful dish--a great alternative to the usual italian cusine using pasta and chicken.  Great flavor!  We even saved some of the leftover cream sauce and use it the next morning to top off some omelets!  Thanks for this fantastic dish Behr Kleine!

I really like this recipe.  It has a good, unique flavor and is a nice change from typical fettuccini.  I even followed the recipe almost to a "T" which is rare for me.  I'll definitely make it again, but will probably double the "paste" mixture (actually more like pesto in consistency) because I think the pasta had tasty flavors, but could be stronger.  Was a great way to use up some key lime juice I brought back from Florida with me.  I also didn't find it to be that difficult.  I would say the prep time is comparable to most of the recipes I have made here.  Even better than the restaurant version!
(Note I have since made this again and doubled the paste mixture and got a more flavorful result.)

I think this recipe was great! I was very impressed by the tase. I am surprised by how many people complained about the time it took to prepare! Slice the peppers & cube the chicken while your "paste" is thickening, and boil your noodles while the chicken is cooking. 
 The only suggestion I make is to use a flour/water rue to thicken the sauce, otherwise it will stay thin like cream. Also, I think next time I will use linguini instead of fettuccini.

Very rich and yummy recipe.  I read the previous reviews and opted for spicier so I used 1 orange habenero pepper and it was definately spicey.  Loved that, the only confusement that I have is whether or not anyone found this recipe to NOT get thick.  It was not thick enough for my liking and I did add a bit of cornstarch when I felt it would thicken enough to my liking.  Then, it was perfect.  Very rich and yummy meal, serve the little ones before you toss the pasta into the sauce!

I was so excited to make this recipe after reading the rave reviews, but afterwards I was diappointed.  It was ok, but I don't think I will ever make it again.  It also took a good deal of time to make and required a lot of ingredients.

Really good. Thanks to all for the great ideas for improving this recipe. I don't like the taste of boiled chicken, so similar to others I added grilled chicken and then sauted it with the red/orange peppers. I also added yellow peppers and extra jalapenos, cilantro, and tequila. This was unique but very good. The taste are a bit of tex-mex, but creamy and full of flavor. I added fresh parmesan cheese on one of my servings and that made it even better. This is a keeper. Yum!

I had most of the ingredients so, I decided to give it a whirl. Delicious!
I sauteed onions and garlic then added fajita seasoned raw chicken tenders. I added the cilantro and used 1/2 cup of minced pickled jalapenos with 2 Tbsp of the juice. Then I deglazed with almost 1/2 cup of tequila and a cup of chicken broth. I let it cook down and concentrate a little then added a jar of Alfredo sauce, 1/2 tsp each of smoked paprika and cumin. I did not use any soy sauce.
Oh, yeah it was yum! Hubby loved it. I'm going shopping for the lime and peppers next time.

This was great and my guys loved it. The only thing I did different was add cream cheese to the sauce. We added this to our normal meal list. My oldest son is a Marine and can't wait to come home and try it.m

I agree with most of the other users: this recipe has fantastic ingredients, but the chicken has to be prepared another way. It's the only thing preventing this from being a five star recipe. I decided to try marinating the chicken in soy sauce/lime juice for about an hour before dinner, and sauteed it until well browned on both sides. I didn't, but would follow the recommendations to take the meat tenderizer to the chicken to have it cook more evenly. Maybe next time, I'll be more adventurous and bust out our Cuisnart Griddler (we lack a real grill, but I'm sure that would be fabulous as well). Aside from experimenting with the chicken, the ingredients are spot on: don't change anything else!

YUMMMMMM.  Everyone wanted to know what I was cooking for dinner, for the kitchen smells were enticing.  I left out the cilantro, and substituted the green pepper with orange pepper.  Nice rich flavor, fancy italian restaurant meal feel.  After we all had our serving, my teenage daughter asked with hope, "there are leftovers, right?" DELICOUS......Thanks

I tweaked the recipe just a little.  I made mine without the chicken and used veggie stock to make this a vegetarian recipe and it turned out delicious! I will definitely be making this again! A total hit!

I rated this 3 stars because even though it was good, I didn't think it was anything special.  Alot of prep and I even used a rotisserie chicken for a shortcut.  Don't let my review scare you away though because the recipe isn't bad, just wasn't for me.

This was delicious.  I was nervous about the jalapenos but it actually was more bland than I expected it to be.  I would add more as well.  Also,  I agree with another review and I marinated my chicken in the tequila instead of the soy sauce.  The soy gave it a bad color.  Great recipe and will make many more times!

Absolutely fabulous! Tastes just like my favorite dish at CPK. Have made this several times, and it is perfect every time! Personally, I like a little more lime flavor, so I add it to the chicken marinade, and add more into the butter mixture. I also add a bit more tequila, but that's just my preference...this dish is great as is!

I didn't have cilantro, and replaced it with parsley.  Still very good, Cant wait to make it again with  cilantro!   Next time i think i'll use less whipping cream it didnt thicken up like i thought it would and so it was  still a little to liquidly for my taste

amazing dish!!  we had a hard time getting to reduce to thick sauce..but we changed twq to one cup and lime juice to 1/2c. We also added 1TBL cornstarch at the end to thickin a little. Also added 1/4c asiago cheese to the sauce and topped with fresh tomato and parmesan-romano and asiago.  Great stuff!!

so I made a mess too!! Loved this recipe.  It was very hard for me to add a full cup and a half of heavy cream so I added only a half of a cup to the reduced mixture.  To make the sauce go a little bit further I added a little bit more chicken broth too and it came out perfect!  I also used four limes and a whole jalapeno.  Another way to make it a bit more healthy is to use whole wheat pasta, which is what I did.  It's also good to keep the peppers a little less mushy and slightly crispy.  This dish came out pretty good, and wasn't too difficult for a tuesday night meal.  I will definitely be making it again soon!!

Absolutely delicious!!!  Based on other reviews, I did make a few modifications.  For the sauce, I upped the ingredients by about another 1/2.  After I cubed the chicken, I put it in a bowl with 2T tequila, 1T lime juice and 1/4 cup chicken stock and let it marinate while I cut up the vegetables.  I also used more jalapenos & garlic.  I made this for a friend last night and she couldn't quit raving about it!  It is so good that at 8 a.m. I'm counting the minutes until lunch so I can have the leftovers!!

this was delicious!  the first time i made it, i found it really complicated (though i used pre-cooked, pre-cut grilled chicken and pre-sliced fajita veggies at the grocery store) and i made it too spicy (caveat-- if you use canned jalapenos, only use a tiny bit!! i used 1/2 tsp. the 2nd time).  the 2nd time i made this it was much easier to make and turned out perfectly! i impressed my husband with it :)

My super picky kiddos LOVE this dish! I didn't add as much cilantro as called for as I'm not a big fan. I also used the Smokey Tequila-Lime Marinade (without the liquid smoke)recipe and baked the chicken ahead of time (many reviewers mentioned the chicken being flavorless when cooked according to recipe). Since I did this I ended up using the soy sauce to sautee the peppers. It tasted delicious! Definitely a repeat dish at our house!

I made this on a whim and it was interesting to make.  I did a few things different : I did double the garlic and Japs. I sliced the chicken in long thin pieces.   When I cooked then I sautéed the onion in the tequila/butter and then added chicken and cooked partway adding the lime juice then added the soy.  I find when I put the lid on I don’t get the rubber effect.  Cooking partway way also.  I chopped the bell peppers in processor my family likes the flavor not the pepper.  It was very pretty.  I did chop the onions in long thin pieces to compensate and give definition.   I only used two pans one for noodles.  I made the paste then cooked chicken and veges and added all.  I was surprised how easy after reading reviews.   After eating the flavor was spot on the only thing I will watch for net time with the extra tequila and butter you have to watch for soupy sauce.  I like mine a little thinker.   Will cook down more when cooking the chicken in marinade or drain the peppers (after chopping produce juice)   This was wonderful

Pretty good. However, if I can recommend at good tequila for cooking and ofcourse drinking, it's Sauza Tequila. They have many marques to choose from: Gold, Blanco, Reposado. Whatever your taste buds enjoy.

This recipe is truly fabulous. Particularly handy is that there are four major elements (the lime paste, the pasta, the veg and the chicken) that you can prepare earlier then combine in 5 minutes whenever you are ready to eat, which would make it ideal for a dinner party entree. My other half was in raptures over it and is now convinced that I am a domestic goddess.

Handy tip - to keep flavor, save the oil you cook the chicken in, and use it to cook the veg.

Love this recipe!! A new family favorite for sure. We did take in consideration the suggestions from others to add more peppers for zip, and to grill the chicken and were pleased with the outcome.

Great recipe. Used pre-cooked grilled chicken strips that I added at the end to heat thru.  Only used 2T tequila and serrano chilis.  Will make again and again...

Tasty recipe. I only gave 4 stars because I had to make some changes.  I did double the sauce and made added a couple serranos and a small peice of habenero.. we like it hot. The heat mellowed. I only used 3/4 of a package of fettucini noodles. I marinated chicken breats in a soy sauce, tequila and lime juice for about an then grilled them. Cut into bite size peices then added to the pepper mixture to warm. I didnt overcook the pepper mixture as I dont like mushy veges. It was delicous and will definitely make again and again!!

The first time I made this it was so hot that I couldn't feel my face.  My husband and I love spicy food, but this was way too hot.  I had read other reviews about it not being hot at all, so I had left the seeds and membranes in the jalepenos.  This time I took out the membranes and added the jalepeno and tequila paste to the cream chicken and peppers just before I served it.  This time it wasn't hot at all.  I'm going to have to find some sort of happy medium.

Beautiful colors before you add the cream!  Tasty but very heavy dinner.  I did add more garlic & used a whole large jalepeno, diced (could've used more garlic!), the only thing I would possibly add is a pinch of salt to boost the flavors.  You'll want to take a long walk when it's all over...  Sits like a rock in your stomach.  I think that's the fettuccini - that's why I gave it 4 stars...  Great flavor, just too heavy a meal for me.

This recipe turned out well -- my husband really enjoyed it and will definitely make it again!  Next time I will double the jalepeno peppers.  I will take the suggestion from others by marinating the chicken in the soy sauce, lime juice and tequila then cooking them seperately.  The onions and bell peppers did get too mushy so I will cook them less next time as well.  I gave this a 5 star because it was a great base recipe and will be a 6 star or better with the said improvements.  Thank you for the superb recipe!

This was a very good recipe.  It was really different and fun to make.  I loved the color from the peppers and the fresh cilantro really made the dish.  It took awhile for the sauce to thicken, but we thought it was worth the wait.  I cooked the chicken almost all the way through before adding the other ingredients and it turned out very tender after simmering for so long.  Thanks, I'll make this again!

I have to agree with another reviewer that this recipe did not have the "Wow Factor" I expected.  Next time I will try slightly less pasta and cream and possibly more jalepeno.  There will definitely be a next time though because it may be my own human error and not the recipe itself!

This recipe was very good.  It was like an alfredo type sauce.  I added the chicken with the peppers after they had sauteed then added the cilantro paste and cream.  The cilatro paste did not thicken much, but after I added it along with the cream to the peppers I let it cook for a bit and added a little cornstarch/water mixture and thickened it up.  Tossed the mixture with pasta and it was GREAT!!!

Delicous!  A little time consuming but next time I will have everything ready to go instead of slicing and preparing as I go along.  Followed the recipe directions to a "T" and would not change a thing.  I did use 12 oz of the pasta and that was perfect for my family.  Served with warm Asiago bread.  The sauce is to die for.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

OMG!  Really good.  But my sauce was initially very thin.  I had to pour it off and simmer for awhile so I wouldn't overcook the chicken.  Otherwise, awesome!

A colorful dish, but I didn't care for the taste of the tequila-lime sauce; However, my customers did like it and requested that I make this again.  (that's what really matters)  Thank you.

This was ok, but with all the prep and high fat content, I was hoping for something more spectacular.  Maybe more garlic, more jalapeno, more lime would perk it up.  And there's got to be a way to make a lower-fat sauce!

10+ stars - AWESOME!!!  I made it EXACTLY as the recipe stated.  I could have eaten the whole thing myself.  I've been craving this since I made it and it will be on the menu this week for sure.  I've passed the recipe on to a couple others who have also found it to be wonderful.  THANK YOU!!

This recipe is so yummy, it needs very little tweaking, other than to modify it to your own tastes. I'm partial to liquor and hot foods, so I went heavy with jalapeno and tequila. Otherwise, I omitted the cream, and at the end, stirred in 1 c. of fat-free sour cream to save some calories. I only cooked half a pkg. of fettuccini to serve 2, and will double or triple the sauce in the future if serving more. The amount of sauce was just right for our preference. Thanks! I'll make this regularly!

Super recipe!  I wasn't able to get cilantro, for more intense flavor I double the ingredients of the paste and used an additional dash of soy sauce at the end to round out the taste of the sauce.  Great recipe for crowd pleasing cooking!

I'm not sure what type of "paste" I was supposed to get, I just cooked it until there was virtually no more liquid in the tequila/lime mix.  I was hoping for more sauce so I added some ranch dressing to my noodles at the end (my fiance liked the spice and was satisfied, it was hot for me).  Otherwise a creative flavor and nice looking presentation.  I oven broiled the chicken breasts also, that made them nice n juicy.

I stumbled onto this recipe as I was looking for a main dish that used cilantro (I had a bunch leftover from another recipe I made).  I can't tell you how wonderful it was!  It was so beautiful w/all the colors and the taste was incredible!  I love creamy-based foods and this has to be my favorite yet!  My brother in law even told me it was the best dish he's ever had!

I have fixed this recipe so many times! Every time we have a different guest over I fix this wonderful dish. I don't even measure anything anymore. You don't need to add anything with this dinner since it is so filling and full of plenty of flavor.  I add extra red bell pepper and jalapenos... my family likes spicy though.  This is even better the next day!

Incredible!  This recipe is a keeper!  Scaled the recipe to 6, and used it to serve 8 (I had a nice leftover portion likewise).  Used 16 oz. of pasta (I typically plan 2 oz. of pasta per person)--that was plenty.  That left a nice amount of sauce to spoon extra on if anyone wanted.

Okay, this is NOT one of the easiest meals to make, it's very involved but the outcome is totally worth the hard work. My entire family loved this recipe. With that said I did make one change that was suggested by other cooks and that was I grilled the chicken and added it to the recipe when you add the cream/jalapeno paste to the skillet. I then added the fettuccini and served. I will definitely make this again for dinner, I am looking forward to the leftovers right now.

SO GOOD. Tasted exactly like California Pizza Kitchen's Chicken Tequila Fettuccini.  
Didn't have Chicken broth or milk - substituted with 1 cup of water.  Cooked noodles in the same pot, as well.

I had to eliminate the garlic and onion, as my wife is allergic. Also I used a pasilla  pepper in place of the green bell pepper. I brined my chicken first, so I cut way back on the amount of salt.
It was fabulous!!! I'll make that again!

I have made this dish a few times, I love it but if I could make a suggestion to make it go from good to great, marinade the chicken overnight in the tequila, soy sauce and lime juice, it takes the flavor into another world. also i would use not just a whole jalapeno but add a habanero for an extra kick

This is my husbands all time favorite dinner! I substitute gluten-free noodles so I can eat it too. I usually have to add some potato flour to thicken it.

This is the best thing I've ever made on allrecipes ! My husband asked for leftovers!! That doesn't happen. The only difference is that I used 9 ounces of fresh fettuccine noodles.

UPDATE: the first time I made this recipe I had sautéed the bell pepper onion and chicken separately then added that to the Mix at the end. THIS TIME I followed the recipe and written. IT WAS NIGHT AND DAY BETTER THE FIRST TIME! The chicken has more flavor. The sauce was more complex. As written everything tastes like bell pepper and the chicken is dry.... 

This is still my favorite recipe : )

Loved this recipe but changed it a little.  I did step one as written , but doubled the jalapeno and cilantro.  I sauteed my chicken (seasoned with Mexican seasoning) after the onion and peppers were 1/2 cooked.  I added the cream to the cilantro paste, cooked it for a minute and added it to the chicken cooking in the big sautee pan.  I then cooked the chicken, peppers and paste in the heavy creams till the sauce thickened.   Poured it over the pasta and served it with cilantro and a little mexican blend cheese.

First time making this and turned out great. I used spinach fettuccine noodles. I would of liked a little more heat, perhaps I'll add some crushed red pepper.

My husband and I are long fans of CPK and this recipe is a slam dunk! As many of my predecessors have done before me I added a few things to my liking. First of all I seasoned my chicken. In addition to the soy sauce, I added some adobo (yes I love my adobo) and salt and pepper (what happened to the basics?). I set this aside to marinate a bit. To the "paste" I added some lime zest (zing!), a little extra jalapeño (delicious!!) and more tequila (never too much). I agree that the reduction phase is a little long so be patient.  I know some complained that the chicken tasted "rubbery" when they cooked the chicken as suggested. What I did was sautéed the peppers and onion to al dente then remove from the pan. Then I browned the chicken (don't cook all the way through) then added my veggies back to the pan and continued on with the recipe as written. After all was said and done, I added a little red pepper flakes for a bit of heat and I added a bit more lime juice at my husbands suggestion (good call!). It was spot onto CPK's rendition!

This was pretty great!  When I looked at the ingredients list, I was pretty skeptical, but curious enough to give it a shot.  I'm glad I did!  I used low-fat sour cream instead of heavy whipping cream to bring the fat and calories down a bit.  I highly recommend that.  I think the sour cream gives it just the tang it needs.

I doubled this recipe since I had 6 people eating. I did not double the amount of peppers and onions, however, and it seemed like plenty. Overall, very good recipe! Had a lot of left-overs.

This is a wonderful recipe, and a big hit with my family. but I made just a few modifications. I grilled the chicken prior to making the dish; it kept the chicken from drying out. I also reduced the amount of soy sauce by about 1/3; I felt it would have overpowered the dish otherwise. Lastly, I increased the tequila lime sauce/paste by about 50%. The result was FANTASTIC.

This recipe is exactly as described - wonderfully different!   I didn't use chicken and swapped out the chicken stock for veggie.  I also added a little cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  The sauce is hearty enough that you don't notice that lack of meat and it had just the right amount of picante.  Made and served this at a dinner party and everyone just loved it.  Definitely a new favourite!

I read reviews and decided to go ahead and make adjustments.  
I added a teaspoon of more minced jalapenos.  Instead of soy, I seasoned diced chicken with lime juice, and a home mexican blend of spices.  I braised the chicken using a cast iron in the oven.  I also used beef stock instead of chicken stock and added white wine vinegar.  I added about 1/2 cup of parm cheese to the mix. 
I gave my family some crushed red pepper flakes and Emeril's Southwest seasoning to add to their plates as desired.  While I made a huge meal for my family of 4, there was barely any left!  Even with the extra spices I added, my 7 and 12 year old loved it.

I did not have high expectations for this recipe because cream sauces tend to be too rich, but I was pleasantly surprised. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and marinated the chicken before hand (~2-3 hours) in the soy sauce mixed with 2 tbsp of tequila and 2 tbsp of lime juice and I really think that helped add to the flavor. I sauted all the onions and peppers and jalapenos then added the chicken and marinade and sauted that as suggested by other reviewers. The sauce took a while to reduce (I kept upping the burner temp) to accelerate the process. I removed the chicken and peppers from the burner while I waited on the sauce. I reduced the sauce and then added the heavy cream until boiling and then added that to the chicken and peppers until it boiled. I had to add some corn starch to help thicken it so it would not over cook the chicken too much. I enjoyed the flavor, will problem make again.

I made this exactly to the original recipe, and while it was tasty, it was disappointing. If I hadn't been the one who put them in there, I would not have known there was tequila, or lime, or jalapeno, or cilantro in the sauce. It also kind of lost something with the pasta - in the pan, the sauce was delicious, but all together it was a bit bland. I liked that it came together pretty quickly - I think I had dinner on the table in under an hour - but it generated a lot of dishes. I may make it again, but not on a work night, and not when I'm looking for something with big, bold flavors like I thought this would have. All in all, a tasty pasta dinner, but maybe the name is a little misleading.

Family loved it!!!  Followed some other reviewers suggestions and doubled the jalapenos as we love spicy foods.  Also accidently bought linguini instead of fettuccini and was great.  Sauce is thin like linguini sauce not thick like most fettuccini ones.

Fantastic recipe! Just like California Pizza Kitchen. I used pre-cooked chicken stripes (Kirkland-Costco brand) and chopped into cubes. Could tweek it like the other reviewers have , but excellent "as is".

This was delicious!  We served with a fresh squeeze of lime at the end and it was even better. I was nervous about the amount of jalapeno, but it wasn't too hot at all.  It took a while for the sauce to thicken, so we removed the chicken and set aside and added it back after the sauce was done. Thank you very much for sharing your recipe!  It's a keeper.

Really liked this - the acidity of the lime juice didn't seem to mix well with the cream, so looked a bit funny but nothing that couldn't be covered up with a parmesean cheese.  I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream and thickened when boiling with a little cornstarch.  Leftovers the next day were great.

Yum!  I have been looking for something like this for  a long time.  There is a restaurant that close and used to serve a similar dish...it was my favorite and I'm so glad to have it back.  I made it just as written...beware, it does have a kick.

This is FABULOUS. I add more peppers (all of them) and don't use an entire box of fettucini but only most of it.  We like a lot of sauce. I also carmelize the peppers and onion a little to bring out the flavors rather than just cooking them till wilted. It does take awhile to prepare but is SO worth it and goes great with homemade garlic bread. Also, the sauce never really "thickens" the way you'd expect it to so don't wait for that to happen.

EXCELLENT! I absolutely loved this dish, and I don't even LIKE jalapenos normally. My mega-picky boyfriend said we should serve this when we have company over! I threw the chicken in a pan separately and fried it up with "Kick'n Chicken" seasoning (from the grocery store, it's really good), soy sauce, and tequila; then I threw it in the sauce right before it was finished just to heat it up again. Don't boil your chicken, it will come out rubbery. I used 1 yellow, 1 orange, and 1 red bell pepper because I like the bright colors and sweet flavors better than green bells.  Don't be light with the tequila, I added extra tequila and lime and it turned out incredible. One of my favorite dishes ever, I can't say enough good things. It's a lot of work, but SO worth it.

Sorry, but this was far too limey for me. I tried to doctor it up, but the lime still stood out. I think I'll keep my tequila and lime in my margaritas. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was a disaster! The sauce was too spicy and got lumpy. I couldn't get things to mix well all at the end. The chicken was tough and overdone and I had way too many dishes to wash when I finished.

The flavors in this dish are amazing!  I'm big on using spices so I had my doubts but I followed the recipe and loved the results.  I added some extra jalapeno and used a bag of frozen peppers and onions to speed up the preparation.  Try this recipe...you will not be disappointed!

Very nice tasting.  I made it for my coworkers and myself for Christmas lunch.  It was very tasty and transportable to work but I found it time consuming in prep work.  Luckily enough I was snowed in when I made it.  Everyone enjoy it the flavor and it was quite filling.

My family asks for me to make this every time I come home! However, I always use spinach fettucini, fresh pasta from the refrigerated section at the grocery store. It gives it a much better flavor. Always a huge hit!

I have been meaning to make this recipe for over a year - and I finally did. It was very tasty! I ended up having to use lemon instead of limes because I was out and didn't know it until I was cooking. The only recommedation I have is to use low salt soy sauce, because it was a tad slaty. Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious! My husband loved it. My daughter took leftover sauce to her boyfriend's. They loved it too. I used garlic chicken broth, plus fresh garlic. Also used more jalapeno because my family loves spicy. I'll definitely make this again and maybe add mushrooms. I'm even thinking of trying the meat and veggie mixture in fajitas.

I have never tried the CPK version  so I don't know how this compares but I will say that this dish was fantastic!  I did marinate the chicken in soy sauce and cook it separately just because I don't like the idea of adding raw chicken to the sauce.  Also doubled the jalapenos to 4 TBSP - perfect!  Everyone went back for seconds and thirds until there was absolutely nothing left.

Absolutely delish!!  Followed everything exactly except used only l/2 the amount of pasta as others suggested.  The amount of sauce was perfect for us - I would suggest doubling the sauce if you made the whole pound of pasta. The 8 oz of pasta served 4 of us.  Thanks submitter.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was DELICIOUS!!! My family loved it, including my soon to be 4 year old little girl!! I did add more jalepeno's, not too spicy, just right. I will be making this a part of my favorite recipe collection!! :)

This recipe is AWESOME!  I've made it several times exactly as stated b/c it doesn't need any tweaking.  The last time I made it, I forgot to buy a jalapeno.  I had some jarred ones on hand and they worked just as well.  Otherwise, don't change a thing b/c this recipe is excellent!

This is one my all time favorite meals that I order at the CPK. This recipe is right on the mark. Suggestions: the pasta amount for some reason is way more than the serving size(about ten servings per pound) and you might want to play with the amounts of chicken(I prefer more!!) and the veggies. Enjoy this dish is unique and delicious!!!

This is a great Southwestern twist on the classic Fettuccini Alfredo. The cilantro and jalapenos give it a little kick without being too spicy. I used the jalapeno seeds, membranes, and all...it's really not that spicy! It definitely has a kid-friendly flavor.

Sooo good!  Even though I didn't have yellow pepper and only roasted red peppers. Still it made my DH's top 10. Next time I'll try with all the peppers--I'm sure it can only taste better.  FYI, doesn't do well as leftovers or as a freezer meal--it gets really soggy and greasy.

AWESOME recipe!  i thought it would be extremely spicy (i used 1 full jalapeno), but it was totally tame.  i might even add more next time for extra kick. you need to reduce the cilantro/garlic/jalapeno mixture for 15-20 minutes.  i was also wary about adding raw chicken to the mixture, but it was SO tender once cooked. very tasty recipe!

Unfortunately, this recipe was on the bland side.  All the heat of the jalapenos cooked out in the past.  It's just not worth the all the steps.

I made this because my husband loves the CPK version of this. I have to say that it is just as good! The only difference is I use half n half instead of heavy cream to cut down the fat and it was wonderful. Thanks for sharing!

I did some changes, but I loved this recipe. The best change was using an actual margarita mix. I made margaritas with the south of the border mix and used the leftovers in this recipe. I used more than called and it added a little sweetness to the spice (I used 3 jalapenos). I had tons of people over and they raved about this recipe. I have to say it was one of the best ever!!! Thank you.

The combination of flavors was very good.  Very fresh tasting.  My sauce didn't thicken as much as I would have liked, but the cilantro "paste" thickened nicely.  Maybe because I used half cream and half fat free half and half.  Overall, good filling dish that we will try again.

I thought this was pretty good, but not quite spicy enough for me. I was hoping it would really zing with the tequila and lime flavors. Perhaps next time I will try to add more jalapenos as Li-Li suggests, and more tequila and lime.

Wow.  I used supermarket already cut-up peppers/onions.  (Makes life easier)  Didn't have jalapenos, used frozen cilantro.  Also used shrimp instead of chicken.  Delicious!!!  Such an exotic change from the usual but with great flavor.  Fantastic recipe!

I like spicy food and this was pretty mild.  We used 2 large Jalapenos - that still does not make it too hot. But, we really enjoyed this dinner! Substituted fat free half & half and soy chicken for the real thing making this a vegetarian dinner.  Great!

A local restaurant makes this same dish, however, this version is far superior! I usually add serano chilis to make it a bit more spicy. Gotta try this one!

Although it seemed like a lot of work and a lot of time my family really enjoyed this.  The only thing I would change next time is to just add the whole yellow and green peppers.  The final sauce never really thickened up for me but tasted good all the same once tossed with the fettuccini.  (Could have been I was just tired of waiting and didn't simmer long enough.)  Thanks for the recipe.

This is an AMAZING dish! I was a little concerned that it would be heavy, but it wasn't at all. It tastes just like something you would get at a nice restaurant. I substituted canned jalapenos, only used green peppers, and added a little extra cilantro. Definitely a keeper!

I didnt love this, I probably wont make it again, but I did use 1/2 & 1/2 so maybe that was the problem. I found it bland, even before the pasta was added, then it became really bland, I had to add more of tequila, lime juice, salt, and I found it needed something so I added honey to add another dimension. That helped the sauce, but again, when the pasta was added it really didnt taste like much. Bummer, I had high hopes. Maybe Im just a tough critic, I havent found many recipes worth 5 stars on this site. Im still looking though! Sorry!

This was good.  Personally, I think the flavor was a little to subtle, so next time I plan to double the "paste" mixture but keep the cream and everything else the same.  I added a little extra fresh squeezed lime and some grated Romano cheese on top of mine before eating.

This was good, however I didn't have an tequila so I had to make it without.  I added mushrooms and took out the peppers.  I used half and half and it was fine.  I will make again with the tequila.

I'm giving this 5 stars, because I'm sure w/the whipping cream it would be even better, but I chose to use F/F half and half instead, and I only used a cup. The cilantro mixture never really turned into a paste, and I let it boil for 10min. The sauce wasn't as thick as I had hoped, and I only used a cup of half and half. But maybe w/using whipping cream, it would thicken better. All in all, great flavors, nice change from the usual plain old chicken. It's a keeper!!

amazing! i went to a restaurant and tried their take on tequila fettuccini and it wasn't nearly as good as this recipe. i followed some of the suggestions from reviewers, such as grilling the chicken rather than boiling it.

This was absolutely wonderful! I added some mushrooms to the saute and a little salt and pepper on the chicken.  I also like a little cayenne in my alfredo, so I added about a teaspoon with the cream.  Added a nice subtle bite.  Everyone went back for seconds.  I will definately make this again!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

Yummy!!!  I used FF half-n-half in place of the cream and dried cilantro as opposed to fresh - but thought this dish was fantastic.  I messed up in throwing all of my peppers and onions in with the garlic and jalapeno mixture, but in the end it all worked out just fine.  I also listened to some reviews and added more of the tequila/lime/cream for a saucier sauce.  Ole!

I added almost triple the garlic and I pressed it and there still wasn't enough garlic flavor for me.  I also added the whole yellow, red, and green pepper which gives it more color and flavor.  At first the cilantro was overpowering but then the other flavors came out, especially the jalapenos.  It was very creamy and it only got better the more you ate it.  I don't really think that the time spent on the recipe though is worth the taste.  I would make it again but only when I knew I had time and patience.

My boyfriend really liked this one. I found it lacking a bit. So the 2nd time I made it I added sliced zuchinni and squash with some mushrooms which made it even better. It added alot of color to the dish as well. Will make again soon!

This recipe was just okay.  The soy sauce flavor dominated and it was a bit dry, especially the next day.  I won't make this again.

This is a great recipe.  I made it for dinner guest recently and one actually said she would give it 5 stars because it was so good!  I told her that it really did get 5 stars!!  It has a lot of flavor, but isn’t too spicy.  It’s just right!

WOW!!! This was so incredibly delicious! My husband came home from a very long day to this meal and he was in heaven. We love spice so I used a bit more Jalapeno than called for. Will make this again for sure!

Made this last night and all I have to say is it's delicious. It was a bit time consuming but like others said you can cut down on the prep time. Next time I make it I'll chop the veggies ahead of time and marinade the chicken as well. I didn't add the jalapeno peppers as no one in the house really cares for them. This is a very different and unique dish that tastes marvelous. Definitely a keeper and will be making it again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I forgot the onion, and I used elbow noodles instead of fettuccini, mainly because that is what I had. My boyfriend thought it was bland.  I thought it was pretty good. I would make it again, but not right away.

Yummy yummy. This dish doesn't have to be so time consuming if you organize the preparation. I wish I'd done that myself a little better!! Chopping all the peppers and onion in advance makes a BIG difference. Great for a special occasion meal. I'll be making this again!

By far the best pasta recipe yet!  The first time we made this, it took close to 2 hours since we made homemade pasta and cooked our own chicken.  We made it again last night and bought pre-cooked chicken & fresh pasta and it only took 30-40 mins.  If I didn't know any better, I would think this recipe was a "secret restaurant recipe" it's so good!

This recipe rocks! I'd add some more heat to it next time I make it, so that it's a bit spicier. But it's really wonderful.

I just fixed this recipe tonight for my husand and I and oh how wonderful it was.  I didn't get home from work until late and got a late start making it so it took some time, but it was we'll worth it!!!!  You know how new recipes always take more time the first time you make them.  My husband had 2 1/2 helpings and suggest that I can make this anytime!!!  Thanks for the great recipe, it is a KEEPER!!!!

This recipe has been a HUGE hit with our families.  My husband loves this meal and brags on it to the whole world.  Having grown up working in a restaurant, there are plenty of ways to keep the time to a minimum and whip this up without any trouble.  Absolutely amazing flavors, and an outstanding success.  Thank you for this addition!  No matter how many times we make it, this one never gets old.

I usually stay away from creamy sauce pasta dishes due to heavy calori count, but this dish is hard to resist.  My boyfriend and sister who's fettucinni alfredo junkie dies when i prepare this dish for them. The tequila, lime, and cilantro combo is amazing and if you chop all the vegitables before cooking it's less mess to clean later.

It was "OK". We didn't throw it out and order pizza instead, but I doubt we'll make it again. Unless I did something terribly wrong in following the recipe, it just didn't taste right. Something about the tequila, lime, soy sauce and cream just didn't do it for us. Might've been better with an oil-based sauce, rather than cream.

It is full of flavor and has a kick to it. If you don’t prefer spicy food omit the jalapenos.
