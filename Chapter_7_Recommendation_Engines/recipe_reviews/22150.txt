Whoo Hoo!  VERY delicious!  notes:  watch out for soaked yams:  yams will peel a lot nicer if you don't leave them soaking in the "cold bath"...

over-done sauce:  keep your eye on the sauce or it turns into syrup--also, reduce the sweetness of the sauce as the yams are very, very good by themselves...

crispy apples:  don't over-microwave the apples because the slightly crunchy texture is such a nice surprise in this predictably Orange dish.  

Even people who had never seen apples with yams were very impressed:  I should have made more!!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was a big hit -- even with the kids!  The apples were a great addition.  Per another reviewer's suggestion, I added minced ginger and a little Grand Marnier, and I highly recommend it.  I'll be making this again for Christmas thanks to multiple requests!

I actually decreased the apple juice by 1/2 cup, added 1/4 cup more brown sugar and 1 tsp more of cornstarch and it worked great.  Slice the apples thick, or they'll be done way before the yams!

This was an interesting combination of flavors and so good for you!  I added more brown sugar that what the recipe called for.  I used the crock pot and cooked it for about 8 hours.  It's an excellent recipe for those looking for something different.  I will definately be using this again!

Yummy recipe. I was bent on not having to go to the store for ingredients....I didn't have allspice so I used nutmeg and cloves (which I removed after the sauce was cooked). Also, I didn't have apple juice so I used apple sauce instead. Lastly, adding salt to the recipe made the casserole taste more like a side dish (my family loves dessert so they would've been easily confused!). Great recipe all in all...I received comments like, "better than Marie Calendar's yams!"

I brought this to a Thanksgiving potluck at work and it was a total hit! I was forced to substitute bottled spiced cider for the apple juice, so I omitted the spices and lemon (since those ingredients are already in the cider). It came out great! Very simple-- and I widdled 4 ingredients down to 1.

This was a great change from the usual sticky sweet yam casseroles. The blend of apples and yams was just right. Had many, many compliments on it from all 17 at Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks, Lynn!

This was fabulous!!!  It made a wonderful dessert, and it was so healthy!  The very first time I made it someone asked for the recipe.  Tip: don't over-boil the yams!  Also, I served it with a spoonful of whipped cream on top and everyone liked it.

This was easy to make and good. It's fairly healthy but sweet. I added walnuts to the left overs and that gave it some crunch.

I found and saved this recipe a number of years ago but had thought it not "fancy" enough for my Thanksgiving table, so I never tried it.  Was I wrong! I finally made it yesterday for just my husband and myself and think I may serve it next Thanksgiving instead of the other wonderful preparations I have been using (also from this site).  I would be terrific for "every day", too.  It is simple to prepare, not cloyingly sweet and uses much less butter and sugar than other recipes.  The apples softened a lot in the oven.  The sweet potatoes, though soft, kept their shape.  The blend together was perfect.  (By the way, boiling them whole and then plunging them into cold water so they were not too hot to handle made peeling a breeze.  The skins simply fell off by slightly rubbing.)  I was a bit concerned that the sauce was too thin and runny when I put it in the oven, but it thickened up nicely, especially after taking off the cover for the last half hour.  The only thing I have to work on is presentation, because I wouldn't want to put a 13x9 Pyrex baking pan on the dinner table.  Next time, I am considering layering in circles in a round casserole dish or dividing into two smaller, square Corningware pans that might make a pretty presentation.

Like one of the others who commented, I too baked the yams for 45-min.  Worked fine. Easy to peel and cut.  As for the recipe, I added 2-3 oz of spiced rum!  A good fit for the other spices, and a bit of an added 'mysterious' flavour.

My husband and I really loved the flavor combination in this dish. It's all the flavors of apple sauce but with the added texture of the yams. They add a great consistency. I give it two big thumbs up.

I have made this at least five times and it is probably one of the best veggie recipes I have ever found.  The combination of yams and apples is a marriage made in heaven.  I will make this one again and again.  It's perfect as written.  Thank you so much.

This recipe is great, my whole family loves it! I leave out the butter; I've made it both with and without the butter and think it tastes just fine without it, and of course, its healthier this way. I also leave out the allspice. The apple 'gravy' really makes this dish a hit.

I've been making this recipe for the last few years for Thanksgiving and have tweaked it a little over the years. Here are my changes that have garnered rave reviews from friends and family:
cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup, use orange juice instead of apple, omit lemon juice. Drizzle pure maple syrup on top and sprinkle with candied pecans. Delicious!!!

Delicious! I used about half of the brown sugar and substituted pear juice for the apple juice since I didn't have any apple juice on hand. Very good recipe, and perfect for this fall weather!  Thank you, Vegas!

Ok - a local german restaurant seves this - I LOVE the combination. Now - got a question. I am disabled and always looking for easy ways to cook things. Has anyone tried using like chunky premade applesauce with yams to make this? If so - do you still add the brown sugar/allspice and other items? (this would be easier for me then cutting up apples) I am just curious to see if someone tried altering this and if it worked? thanks...

Used Splenda brown sugar blend and Country Crock instead of the full-fat versions, and it turned out great!  My family loved it, and my daughter NEVER eats yams.  This is worth the effort to make.

I followed the directions to a tee, but this did not help my recipe.  I would suggest reducing the apple juice and increasing the number of sweet potatoes.

I was looking for a healthy sweet potato recipe and this hit the spot!  Everyone loved it and I will definitely be making this again.  The only part I didn't like doing was basting with the juice, that was a pain.  I think I basted it 3 times while it baked.

Like a warm, spicy apple pie with a yammy bonus! I loved it and so did my family. Will be a new Thanksgiving tradition.

I am not sure what happened. Followed instructions. The apples were mushy! It tasted more like apple pie to me than yams and apples, it was okay my husband liked it. It was more of a dessert than a side dish.

Use GALA apples - they are the best.  I used apple cider and nutmeg instead of allspice.  Very easy!  Can make this a day ahead by poaching the apples in the cider mixture first, then refrigerate.

Just made this one today, and WOW! I took a few tips from other reviews: I used 1/2 cup orange juice, 1/4 cup packed brown sugar. Other than that, I followed the recipe and it worked like a charm. My daughter, who only last week told me she despises yams, tried it and finished what she took (no seconds, but I'll take the small victory!).

Amazing and delicious!  Used local hard cider for the apple juice (we call it Apple Jack in PA) and tossed in some Craisins to use up the box, but I'm sure it's great as is written.

This is my go-to sweet potato dish in the fall, so I’ve made it probably five times. My Thanksgiving guests gave me many compliments on this dish— overwhelming upgrade from sweet potatoes with marshmallows, lol.

This was a huge hit on Thanksgiving! We substituted Monkfruit golden sugar for brown sugar and it was still super tasty! My family was blown away and loved this recipe better than the traditional sweet potato casserole with pineapples and brown sugar.

I made this at Christmas. But I  just cubed the yam and apples.  Everyone raved! Adults and kids who don't like yams loved this recipe. I am requested to make it for Easter now. I never like yams at all. But I found this recipe and it was a game changer. Very tasty.

Yummy.  Cooking for 2, so used 1 large sweet potato, one medium/small Granny Smith apple.  The apple/potato ratio was good.  Omitted the lemon juice, since Granny Smiths are tart.  Used one TBSP sugar and this was plenty sweet for us as a side dish.  Per another reviewer, added some minced fresh ginger, and this was good.  Instead of boiling, I microwaved the sweet potato for 3 minutes, and this worked well.  (Fed the potato skins to my dog, so he gives 5 stars to this recipe also.)  Will definitely make again.

I thought this would be the perfect addition to our Thanksgiving dinner and I was right! However, when I got to the family home with my sweet potatoes and apples and spices and apple juice...the was no brown sugar! I went ahead and made the recipe:  2 very large sweet potatoes, 4-5 medium sized Honeycrisp apples, butter, spices, cornstarch and followed the recipe. The whole family love it!  In fact, they liked it that there was no sugar. How about that.

We loved this! I peeled yams before cooking, cubed them big a boiled until just tender. The apples and yams where the same consistency after baking, not soggy. I used 3/4 cup orange juice 3/4 cup apple juice.  I also made a crumble of oats, brown sugar , butter and pecans and sprinkled on top before baking to add a little texture. Delish! And not to sweet.

Made it for Thanksgiving and accidently dumped extra cinnamon in...not sure how much and the family LOVED IT.  Made it again for Christmas with canned yams and unknown amount of cinnamon and the family LOVED IT.  

Very easy to make!

This was a big hit at my Thanksgiving table this year. Good flavor and nice presentation with the apples. Next time I make it, I'll add a bit more spice, and not cook the yams as long to keep them a bit firmer. I used apple cider in place of the apple juice.

Made this with a few changes.  I had a sweet potato and a yam, so used them both.  Boiled as instructed.  DIdn't have ground allspice so added a pinch of nutmeg and a pinch of cloves.  Used apple cider instead of apple juice.  Had a half of a navel orange, which I cut up and added.  (peeled, of course).  Threw it all in the crockpot with the butter sauce and cooked for about 4 hours on low.  It was kind of sticky looking, but oh man...outstanding flavor!  Definitely keeping the recipe so I can make it again (and again and again.)

This recipe was a big hit for Easter. I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out great. This could be served as either a side dish or as a desert. Big hit with the kids because of the sweetness. Next time, I would probably increase the apples and cut them very thick.

This was pretty good - we all enjoyed it at Thanksgiving.  Something different, which I like.
