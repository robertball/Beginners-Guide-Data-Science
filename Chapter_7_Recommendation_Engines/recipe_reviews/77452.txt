This is a great tasting recipe that is just crying out for help with the instructions.  Vichyssoise is a French soup that is smooth and for lack of a better description--the consistency of baby food.  Nowhere in this recipe does it tell you to puree it and it must be pureed in order to be a Vichyssoise.  The next stumper is the pumpkin.  How big is a medium pumpkin?  I used 2c. of pumpkins that were already cooked and pureed.  I started with cooking the dried chiles in the broth and the next step of caramelizing the onions and adding the leeks.    After that, I put EVERYTHING together EXCEPT the buttermilk.   (That included 2 c. of pureed pumpkin.)   I boiled this until the leeks were soft .  Then I removed the bay leaf and in small batches, pureed it in a blender until smooth.   I returned the soup  to the pot, added the buttermilk, and served.   This soup has a wonderful savory cumin flavor with a bit of a spicy kick.  It can be served warm, but is best cold.

This is a good recipe for a relatively low-fat yet flavorful pumpkin soup, especially if you're not a fan of pie-spiced pumpkin.  The soup MUST be pureed thoroughly after cooking, or the chiles will be inedible.  The preparation can, in other ways, be simplified.  I used a slow-cooker on high to soften the pumpkin in the 2c broth with the chiles.  No hassle!  I used a mix of New Mexico and Ancho chiles, which worked well.  I added a pinch of sage with the cumin.  I added the buttermilk immediately prior to serving, to avoid boiling it.  Sour cream makes a good condiment.

I'm really stumped as to why this recipe has 5 stars... these directions are written rather poorly.

This is a good base recipe and actually comes out pretty decently with reworking (the main reason I'm giving it 4 stars).  I combined some of the other reviewers' suggestions for my version.  Roasted 1 acorn squash (400 degrees for 45 minutes).  Didn't have chiles and skipped #2 (original recipe). Also didn't have leeks and used spring onions instead.  

Caramelized 1 red and 2 spring onions for about 10-15 minutes and removed. De-glazed pan with sherry.  Simmered 1.5 cups of chicken broth and added: baked squash, caramelized onion, 1 tsp cumin, 1 bay leaf, fresh ground pepper, and pinches of: sage, paprika and smoked paprika (or garam masala).  Bring to a low boil. Remove bay leaf, puree in blender.  Return to pot, add buttermilk and mix well.  Serve with sprinkle of cinnamon.
