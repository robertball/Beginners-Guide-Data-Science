I just whipped up a bit of this wonderful bernaise sauce.  I followed the recipe with the exception of not having the tarragon mustard so I used crushed dried tarragon leaves and regular dijon mustard.  It was creamy and rich tasting.  Didn't miss the butter at all.  I drenched a few slices of french baguette with it and it was outstanding.  Thanks Chef John.

So sorry, but we just didn't like this very much, and I love bernaise. It tasted harsh from the vinegar and mustard, and didn't have that silky texture that the traditional recipe has, which makes sense since it's butterless. I guess we will just stick to the regular bernaise. Thanks for posting an interesting idea, though.

I liked this, it definitely satisfied the need to have a bearnaise sauce without the buttery guilt. I felt it was a bit too mustardy for me so I added a touch of honey to take away a bit of bitterness. I made my own tarragon dijon mustard and used the white wine vinegar. I would make this again.

It has an over-powering flavor. Add an extra egg yoke and cut back on the vinegar and mustard just a bit. Prep everything while steak is cooking and then finish while steak is resting. I only had plain Dijon and regular vinegar,  but did add a generous amount of crushed dried tarragon. Watch very carefully as this comes together quickly when using this over the open flame  method; add a little extra water if too thick. This really takes steak to the next level.

Not bad for butterless! I'm more partial to the real deal in moderation... bring on the BUTTER & CREAM! I'll just have to run more laps.

I made it just how Chef John said, even found the Tarragon Vinegar.
