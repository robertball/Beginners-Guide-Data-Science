I make a similar version of this soup for my family. The major differences between this one and mine are that, once it has cooked (and cooled off a bit), I: (1) emulsify approximately 1/3rd of my pot with my immersion blender and (2) add 1/2 cup of milk or half-and-half to give it a creamier texture.

I have had the soup in the Senate Dining Room, and this is the very much like it.  The best bean soup I have had.

We had a version of Senate Soup at the Mount Washington Hotel in New Hampshire.  It was delicious...and, this recipe equals it.  Great on a cool evening...and a great use for left over ham bones.  Thank you!

A good hearty soup for cool evenings. Great with hot crusty bread. -I wonder if this soup is where all the senatorial hot air comes from? ;)

The "true" recipe for Senate Bean Soup seems very elusive!  I have 5 different versions and none agree, sometimes even as to the type of bean to be used.  I long ago decided, "Just call it 'Bean Soup', and enjoy!"  They are all good.

I used three leftover fresh ham bones from a recent party to make my stock. I save all of my carrot, onion, celery, potato, etc. peels and freeze them just for making stocks. Made the stock yesterday, so by today, I was able to skim off all of the fat. I used two packages of beans, so I needed to add more liquid which I did using canned chicken stock. Delicious and hearty Yvonne and perfect for an extremely cold NJ night. Thanks!

I scaled this recipe down to roughly 4-5 portions and made the following changes: used 1 QT of vegetable stock, canned beans, ham bone from Christmas ham w/ remaining meat chopped up into the soup, and added 1 can of Italian stewed tomatoes.  Since there was plenty of salt in the stock, the ham, and the tomatoes I did not add more salt, and used 3 roughly crushed cloves of garlic instead of the powder.  The end result was absolutely delicious.

We really loved this soup!  I made broth with the hambone as suggested.  I used to have a Senate Bean Soup recipe (that I loved) that included basil and oregano, so I added a teaspoon of each.  Perfect for a cold night!

I truly enjoyed this but my kids wouldn't try.  Something about the beans, LOL.  Makes A LOT so if your going to eat it you'll need to scale it down...I will next time.  I ate it three days in a row and still had to throw away 1/2 of it.  What a shame too.

I know this is a famous soup, but if this is truly what the Senate Bean soup taste like, I don't get it. With no spices in it, it is really bland. I had to add thyme, rosemary and basil to give this any taste. I also dumped in a can of fire-roasted tomatoes. I put pre-soaked beans and the shank in the slow cooker and let it cook for several hours. Half way through the cooking time I added sauteed onion, carrot, fresh garlic and celery.

I made some substitutions with this which has resulted in an enhanced flavor. Substituted the Ham with cooked, crisp and crumbled turkey bacon. Changed out two cups of the water with two cups of whole cream.Sauteed the onions in butter before adding and made a puree of about 1/4 of the beans to thicken. Also chopped fresh garlic instead of the powder. Added one teaspoon of nutmeg. Very very tasty cooked in the crockpot.

I love this bean soup. Its how my mother made it here in PA but we always added a few diced potatoes. I like my soup thick so I use a hand masher and mash 1/4 of the beans & potatos. It releases the starches and will thicken the pot. Note* if you used an hand held imersion blender  or regular blender for this..be careful. Bring some out of the pot to cool before blending.

I have had the original when I lived outside of DC and this is very similar EXCEPT I believe the original uses Navy beans.  I think the addition of some tomato product is a very tasty and healthy option.

Not so good.  Beans never softened so I used a stick blender  which turned the entire thing into a gloppy mess.  Even when I thinned it out with chicken broth, it just didn't taste as good as it smelled.

Very good  bean soup. I had leftover ham but had thrown the stock away so used just the ham base and it worked out fine.  It is a keeper recipe.

I thought this was a little on the boring side. I ended up adding a couple of bay leaves and some thyme. I did like the idea of using a mashed potato as a thickner as opposed to mashing some of the beans.

For this to taste better, I added several spices: allspice, cinnamon, garlic powder, black and white peppers, cumin, dill weed and curry powder, about 1 tablespoon each. Added more ham, 1/c of chopped ham and a little olive oil to the soup at the end. It tasted better afterwards and even more tastier after sitting overnight in the refrig.

Best ham and bean soup we've ever made -- and we're talking decades in the kitchen together.  Made it exactly as written.  We've never used instant potatoes before ( didn't even know where to find them in the store!) but are sold on this product as a thickener-upper.  The ham bone we had didn't yield too much meat, so we finally just added chunks of leftover ham.  I'm pitching my older recipes!  The soup was perhaps a little too salty, so next time may season with only pepper.

An addition:  we were recently in Washington DC, and ate in the restaurant where this soup is served.  No comparison.   The soup at the Senate was basically carrots and celery boiled in water, with a shred or two of ham bits.   No body to it, and no flavor!  I think the cook who submitted this recipe should rename it!

I made a vegetarian version with molasses, liquid smoke, miso, and Bac-O's.  It was satisfying
