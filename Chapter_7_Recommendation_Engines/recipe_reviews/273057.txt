This was good, a bit on the sweet side so next time I would cut back on the sugar. I was unable to 'roll' the crust as the submitter states. I had to 'press' it in just like you would do so with a regular graham cracker crust. Very similar in taste and in looks to a Oreo cookie crumb crust. Thank you for the recipe.
