Being american and living in the UK, I wanted to celebrate thanksgiving and because there are several chocoholics in my husbands family i wanted to try a chocolate cheesecake. This recipe was great but i did a few minor changes. Instead of semisweet chocolate I replaced it with Cadburys Dairy Milk bar instead and used more than 4 squares. I used the really giant sized bars over here and used most of it. I also used double fudge chocolate chip cookies for the crust since you cant find regular choc. cookies over here. For a good texture I did give it a water bath in the oven and I kept it a little longer than 40 minutes to get the smooth texture I was wanting. It turned out amazing and those who were lucky enough to take some home acted like they were taking home something really special. I'd definately fix this recipe again. It was easy and very irresistible!! A definate keeper!

I liked this recipe because it could be made with ingredients I usually have on hand anyways.  Simple.  Quick.  And very yummy!  Instead of coffee-flavored liqueur, I used 3 tsp. of espresso powder.  Served it to company and everyone loved it.  Would definitely make again.

I also used a 7oz bar of chocolate and a dollop of sour cream.  Turned out great!

This was simple and tasted great!  I melted 4 more ounces of chocolate after the cheesecake cooled completely and poured it on top and let it set in the fridge.  It was hevenly!  Thanks Brenda.

This was good. It is not my favorite recipe but I might be prejudice against chocolate cheesecake. I added 6 oz. of chocolate instead of 4. It was not very cheesy.

Not my favorite cheesecake. It was really heavy if that makes sense.

Very good!  I was looking for a chocolate cheesecake recipe that was made in a ready-made crust as I didn't have a lot of time but wanted to make something chocolate.  This was it!  It was quick and easy and came out creamy and rich.  Perfect for us!  My daughter was quite pleased with it.  I know I'll make this again.

Simple to make, yes. It was good as written but I felt it was too heavy as well. And too cream cheese tasting, not enough chocolate. It baked wonderfully in a premade crust and texture was fine. Just wasnt the WOW i was looking for. Thank you

I made a peanut butter topping using honey roasted Peter Pan and whip topping mixed well together. Was amazing.

I would have given this recipe a 4, but my daughter said it was the best chocolate cheesecake she had ever had.  This cracked like crazy for me, but with a little whipped cream – who’s going to know?
