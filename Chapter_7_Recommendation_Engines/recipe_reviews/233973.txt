Wicked Easy Chili Haiku: "No doubt it's 5 stars! What made it so magical? I have no idea." Instead of the jalapenos and reg. diced tomato can, I used a can of Rotel, and was otherwise entirely faithful to the recipe. Can't say that I can put my finger on what made this chili so outstanding, but for all the chili recipes that I've tried, I can't recall the last one that elicited so many mumbled "mmmmm's!" and resounding agreements on 5-stars from my husband, daughter and myself than this one.

I made as directed, except used diced green chiles (canned) instead of green pepper, and increased the chili powder and red pepper flakes, since I like chili HOT.

My first time making chili for my family using this site and it was SO yummy! My tiny one's tummy can't tolerate super hot things so I omitted the peppers. Also, I didn't have any fresh garlic on hand so I just used a bit of garlic powder.  Definitely quick, easy, and delicious

Exceptional. One of the best chillis Ive ever had. Simple and quick to make, very flavorful and a bit of heat without being too hot to add to the delicious flavor. From now on this will be a staple of our family meals.

Eh. All the reviews say this is good, but I'm a bit disappointed. Something was missing. Maybe next time I'll try increasing the chili powder from 2 tsp to 2 Tbsp and see how that goes.

This is my go to recipe for my hungry guys.  I use ground turkey for a lower fat version.  I do add sliced black olives, mexi-corn and substitute ancho chili powder.  If I run out of black beans, I have used kidney beans or cannelli beans.  For my guy with acid reflux....I add a teaspoon of baking soda after the pot comes off the heat......then I add elbow macaroni.

Sticks to the ribs and my guys love this chili.

This is some seriously good chili considering how easy it is to make! Flavors have depth and this chili isn't too spicy either. All in all I am impressed with this recipe. I did use all organic ingredients, maybe that makes a difference, who knows?

Lives up to its name - easy. I don't like super spicy chili, so I did not use any jalepeno peppers. I did use one can of the Rotelle tomato and  jalepeno  mix.  I like that this recipe calls for the lowest fat ground beef - still yummy, but not so fatty. I added a red pepper and another can of black beans. I also did not include the seasoned salt - I don't like things salty, and this chili is so flavorful, I didn't miss the salt at all. I still found my chili spicy, but the perfect spiciness for me.

Noooooo ...definitely edible ....but definitely not comparable to my favorite Wazoo TailGate Chili or the Boilermaker TailGate recipes.

Not a great chili recipe. I will delete this from my recipe list!

Skip this recipe and ...try another!

Delicious!  I didn't stick 100% to the recipe, but I didn't change any of the spices.  The blend is incredible.  The jalapenos add just the right zip.  Definitely will make this over and over.

This was delicious! I added a can of rotel, some corn, extra garlic, red pepper flakes, chili and some cayenne because I like it extra spicy. I topped off my chili with sour cream, cheese and scallions. I also seasoned my beef and used red onions. This is a nice base that you can really customize.

So easy to make and delicious!  I adjusted and added 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of black beans and used pickled jalepeno peppers as I didn't have any fresh.  Still came out delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.

Didn't change much! Just added another bell pepper, omitted the sugar and jalapeno....my 20 month old daughter was signing for "more"! Husband said it's the best chili he has had. Easy to make. We will definitely be making this a weekly dinner!

So easy with ingredients I usually have on hand! I don't like things too spicy, so I just used 1 tsp of chilli powder, and I didn't have canned diced tomatoes, so I just diced up a fresh tomato.  It looked and tasted as good as when I use the packaged seasoning mixes :) Will use this recipe again!

I was looking for a chili recipe that was different from our regular recipe, but not TOO different. This was delicious, fast and easy when made exactly as the recipe stated.  Next time I will prob sub kidney beans for the black beans, cuz we're a kidney bean loving kind of family :)

This recipe was quick and delicious! I didn't add the jalapeños because I didn't have any and I substituted season salt for regular salt since that's all I had. I also added a medium fresh tomato since it was sitting in my vegetable basket. It was a tiny bit spicy for my pallet, however I think i'll try adding some cinnamon next time to help sweeten it. Great recipe, thanks for sharing it!

Just like it says. Wicked easy. Also wicked yummy!! My family ate it like they hadn't eaten in weeks, and went back for seconds. Two days later, they were begging me to make it again. This is my new favorite chili recipe. I did make a few minor changes. I can't eat peppers of any kind, so I omitted the jalapeños and green peppers, and used original Rotel in place of the diced tomatoes. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Perfect amount of kick and flavor. Topped it off with shredded cheddar and sour cream. Best chili I've had in a long time!

VERY Good!  I omitted the jalapenos because i dont like too spicy chili and it turned out perfect! I also recommend us ing petite diced tomatoes. Without the jalapenos its still got a good kick to it!

This was a good recipe to build on.  Didn't have diced tomatoes so I threw a whole jar of sauce and added water to the right consistency.  Also added carrots and corn and it tasted great!

Loved this recipe!  I took the advice of another and did a can of Rotel instead of the jalapenos and diced tomato can.   I made 2 batches in 2 days because we wanted more!

Loooooooove this recipe!  I subbed more chili powder for the cumin, used additional bell peppers instead of the chili peppers, and added mushrooms because I love them.  This is incredibly tasty... even with ground pork, which is what I tried this time around (I've made it twice).  Outstanding results every time and a very healthful version!

Easy to prepare with ingredients already on hand - I did add an extra can of black beans and a can of both tomato sauce and diced tomatoes.  Nice flavor - will make again.
