We have updated this recipe due to a typo in the amount of water. It has been changed from 1 cup to 1/2 cup.

I used dark corn syrup and raised the temperature to 110 degrees.  The mixture came out perfect and absolutely opaque.  I poured it over a sour cream pound bundt cake and the result was a hit.  This one is definitely a keeper.

I've been using this one for years.  It is easy and it tastes good.  The only short coming is that it is a very translucent icing, even with coloring added.  That's the only reason I keep searching for a recipe that is more opaque (and is still easy!).  Icing tip: dip cake-frosting knife into icing to start (this will keep cake from slipping off), place cake on knife, hold over sauce pan, spoon icing over cake, slide cake off onto wire rack with table knife.  It's easy to coat the sides with this method.  You get crumbs in the icing, but most of these slide off as you ladle.

In my opinion, the key to this recipe is the temperature. I messed up a lot of cake, but I learned to start with all ingredients room temp. Mix everything together, then put it on the stove. Slowly slowly slowly let it warm. If it gets too hot, it will produce transparent icing.

This came out WONDERFUL!  A little time consuming but it is worth it.  I did take the advice of others and use dark corn syrup rather than light, and I heated until 110 degrees.  The color and texture was great.  This made the perfect petit fours.  I will definitely use this again soon. Thanks!

This was my first attempt at making petits fours and unfortunatly it did not work out so well. I followed this recipe almost exact, with the exception of increasing the temp. as one review suggested. The icing was very transparent and did not cover my cakes evenly :o( Still on the search for the perfect pourable icing.

Recipe works great. the procedure needs to be changed.  I had stunning results, but I had to adjust the way I prepared the fondant.  Heat the water, syrup and flavor to 110 or 125.  Put liquid in Mixing bowl and slowly add the sugar, you may need more or less depending on the humidity.  If the fondant starts to get too cool it will thicken.  Have a water bath on the stove or crock pot to warm the cooling fondant.  Any of the spills, drips  can be reheated this way too.  Just scrape it back into a heat safe bowl and place over the water  bath until you have the consistency you want.          *For more flavor and color add a little "kool-aid" powder before adding powdered sugar to heated liquid.

This recipe worked really well for me. I read some of the reviews that said they had a hard time coloring it, and since we needed it BLACK, I subbed out a full ounce of the water for black food coloring. It was probably a touch of overkill, but it was black as night. I made it twice, and learned that the fondant doesn't change consistency very much when it gets to the appropriate temperature. It just takes less drying time the longer and hotter it is cooked. The first batch I heated until it boiled, and had to cool to an appropriate temperature, and it hardened almost on contact. The second batch I cooked about 15 degrees higher than the recipe stated, and it stayed tacky longer. It was much easier to smooth and a lot less stressful.

This is exactly like the Wilton quick pour fondant icing.  I am not happy with the INTENSE sweetness of this icing.  The recipe is successful at 110F, as others have noted.

I did not care for this recipe. Pouring the mix on top of an iced cake did not work for me. It got bumpy and when I tried to fix it with the spatula, the whole surface moved so it turned into a big mess.

Used this on one of the yellow cake recipes from here. The temperature is the key to getting it just right. I liked the smooth shiny tops it made on my cupcakes!

I used this recipe for coating petit fours and was a little disappointed with the end result. It didn't coat evenly and the icing was partly translucent in areas, allowing the cake to show through.

Too sweet and transparent.  I went above the recommended temperature by accident.  That is very easy to do so start on low!  That may be why it was transparent as another reviewer mentioned, but I do not know for certain.

I tried this recipe twice, thinking I'd missed the temperature mark.  It was too thin and was transparent-- not at all what I was looking for for my petit fours! :(

I should have taken the suggetions of others on raising the temperature a little. It was very tanslucent too. I wasn't able to use this on the cake I was making, but this would probably be a nice glaze for a bundt cake.

I rate this the way I did because I wasn’t too crazy about the texture, but it gave me a lot of insight to my recipe for a poured glaze. I used 2/3 cups condensed milk, 1.5 cups sugar, 3 envelopes of plain gelatin(bloomed with 1/2 cup Water) all heated together and your choice(s) of food dye. Pour it on and watch it marbelize.
