This was just OK.  I would suggest using chive onions for a little more flavor...or if not, perhaps the addition of dill would help.  It wasn't very flavorful, but if it were coupled as a side dish or side salad to a main course that was abundant in flavor, it could pair ok.  I would still consider adding a bit of sourcream to the plain yogart...

Great idea, first cut way back on the yogurt: put in just enough to "coat" the ingredients like a salad dressing - then add more herbs like dill, basil and for fun add fresh diced tomatoes.  It will be very refreshing and enjoyable.

I tried this recipe and maybe I did not enjoy it because it really just tasted like the yogurt and never really got any flavor . I like the idea but like the other review maybe using sour cream instead of yogurt would help it out??

Not a big yogurt fan myself, but I decidedto giveit a try.  Still had a very strong yogurt taste.

This was a nice light salad esp. for lunch. I did not add the cheese but fresh tomatoes, basil and parsley. The suggestion of not adding too much yogurt is a must. it gets watery after refrigerating it for a few hours.

I didn't think this was too bad at all. Pretty good in fact. I went easy on the salt because of the potential of the cukes being too watery. Cut way back on the yogurt because I wasn't interested in soup and used green onion instead of a yellow or sweet onion. Also, had to have a sprinkle of dill as a topper because cukes and dill just go together. The parmesan was a nice touch.

6/20/06 I thought the flavor was fine when it was first made. However, I did have a problem with the cucumbers weeping after refrigerating. I will try pouring off the extra water and adding the yogurt just before serving next time.  7/4/07  I made this again and omitted any salt. It stayed better in the refrigerator, but I still didn't get very excited about eating it. Too much sauce and too much garlic.

i'm sorry but I just thought this was flavorless. And it calls for way too much yogurt.

Use a fourth a cup of yogurt, a teaspoon of garlic powder and green onions to make it tolerable, but then it is still not great.

This recipe has some flaws or possibly typos. I rated it a 3 because I was able to save it. Other than the cucumber I did 1/4 of all of the ingredients. The cucumbers were still heavily coated in yogurt. It was missing flavor. I added dry dill to taste, a splash of vinegar, and a spoon of mayo. The yogurt alone did not taste like a dressing. It worked great then. Luckily, I have made enough of these salads to rework the dressing after tasting the flavor as is.
