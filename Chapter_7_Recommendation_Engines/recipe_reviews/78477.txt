This is a delicious tomato salad. I used garlic salt instead of plain old salt, maybe half the oregano and added quite a bit of freshly snipped basil.  I also just added amounts of oil and vinegar to suit my tastes. Let sit for more like 15 min. before eating. I could see myself adding shredded or cubed mozzarella cheese to this, and I will use fresh oregano next time. Yum.

I doubled the recipe for two of us, but it was almost too much.  Used grape tomatoes, a high quality balsamic vinegar, skipped the oregano, added lots of fresh-snipped basil, halved the salt, and added a bit of mild feta.  Nice texture with the grape tomatoes; anymore salt would have been too much; feta combined well with other flavors.

Very, very good and so easy! I usually use a lot more than 10 tomatoes, and I like to sprinkle parmesan cheese over mine right before I serve them. These make a great lunch by themselves or along with any meat. Thanks for sharing.

Good quick snack with a little more zing that plain tomatoes. Fresh oregano or basil (in place of the oregano) makes it taste even more fresh.

I've made this recipe several times.  The key is to use a really good quality balsamic vinegar.  Also, I usually use basil.  The longer you let the tomatoes sit in the vinegar, the better they taste.

A great side dish with some feta and thinly sliced red onions - and still South Beach friendly!

I really liked this recipe it had a wonderful taste - didn't give it the 5 stars because the oregano is way too much.  I should have read the reviews before trying it and it would have been much better.  Still a great recipe though!

This was fantastic!  I added some cut-up cucumbers and radishes, doubled the oil and vinegar, used basil and oregano (less oregano, let it sit for about 1/2 hour, and used it as a salad dressing over mixed greens.  My husband loved it and this will definitely be a favorite!

This was delicious!  I decresed the oregano, as it's a strong flavour, and I used a whoel small carton of tomatoes.  I added feta cheese made with goat milk and herbed with garlic.  Absolutely delicious, I ate the whole thing in one sitting!!!

This was really good.  I took advice from other reviewers and doubled the tomatoes and cut the oregano in half.  I also added sliced fresh mozzarella.  Will be making this again.

Definately reduce the amount of oregano! Upped the grape tomatoes and added a tad of fresh garlic and slivered basil. I didn't measure the balsamic or olive oil, just eyeballed. Basically tasted like an insalata caprese salad but without the fresh mozzarella.

This gets 1 star based on the way the recipe is written.  I almost always read our fellow reviewers comments but was in a rush today and just followed the recipe since it was rated so high and the ingredients were simple.  WRONG - do NOT follow this recipe - follow the reviewers advice.  Use at least 1/2 the amt of oregano.  As soon as I saw the end result of following the recipe I was able to quickly rinse off the tomotoes and start again.  Use this recipe but halve the oregano and use the good tips from other reviewers.

This was pretty good!  I used lots more tomatoes because there was way more dressing than I wanted!  Also used 1 tsp oregano and 1 tsp basil and added some garlic powder.  Let the salad sit in the refrigerator for a couple of hours before eating.  That improved it.  Worked well to use up an abundance of grape tomatoes out of the garden.

Far too much marinade for the tomatoes.  I would recommend doubling the number of tomatoes for the current receipe.  The flavor is awesome though!

This was very good but after having had some of the other cherry tomato recipe's on this site, it was an inferior recipe. I used twice as many tomaotes as the recipe called for too.

This was very easy to make.  You might want to marinade this a bit before serving, but make sure not to over pour in the vinegar, it will be too strong.

I thought there might be too much oregano in the recipe before I tried it, but I made this exactly as written and it was fabulous. I will be making this very often.

Pretty good!  Per some other reveiwers suggestions, I added a green onion, a chopped up mozzarella stick, 1 1/2 tsp basil (decreased the oregano to 1/2 tsp), and used garlic salt instead of regular.  There was a ton of "juice" so I served the whole thing over some salad greens for extra veggies.  Filling, delicious, and easy.  I think it would be better with fresh herbs, but I could make it again this way.

I multiplied this recipe by 4, but reduced the oregano to 1 tsp and added 1 tsp of basil.  I also added spring onions and I let it sit at room temp. for an hour or so.  I had also halved the tomatoes. It was excellent!

This was a good simple recipe, and I used fresh basil (which I love) but I just didn't enjoy this that much.  It was easy though!

I love to make these on a hot summer day.  They hit the spot.  I reduce the oregano by half.

Great recipe.  I more than doubled it, but reduced oregano to about 1/2 tsp.  I added chopped green onions, too!

I loved it. Great for a light lunch. I'll make a larger portion in the future though. Not enough tomatoes.

These were very good! Instead of using the single serving for 1, I added 1 piece of string cheese sliced to the tomatoes. spooned them over a bit of romaine heart lettuce w/some avocado. Then I served it for 3.  Also, used only 
1/2 tsp oregano.  Really tasty!

Delicious!  I made this to use up some grape tomatoes that were starting to go bad, so I think the ratio of oregano to tomatoes was a little off, but still good.

I liked to combine the tomatoes with some button mushrooms in the dressing. It makes a great salad, side dish or appetizer!

This recipe is delicious!  I use garlic salt instead of plain salt for a little extra flavor.
