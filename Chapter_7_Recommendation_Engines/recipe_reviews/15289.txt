My grandparents used to make pizzelles and have them fresh and ready for us when we visited.  When my grandmother passed away, I got the pizzelle iron but no recipe!  This recipe has the head-on exact taste of hers, and everybody LOVED them.  THANKS!!

These came really good! But I only added 3 cups of flour instead of 3 1/2 and put anise extract instead of Lemon Zest.  I also put about a tablespoon of anise seeds.

This recipe is for someone who wants an "Italian Like" cookie. If you want the real thing, omit the lemon zest and add 1 to 2 tsp. anise extract or 1 tsp. anise oil.

"Purists" who swear by anise when making a pizzelle don't know what they're missing when they refuse to accept other flavors.  This recipe is awesome!  I also made it with the zest of clementines (it's what I had on hand) and a little orange extract in the batter ... oh my god what a cookie ... Afterwards, I dusted the finished product with powdered sugar.  Heavenly!

Delicious!  We cooked them about 20 seconds then rolled them while still hot... added a sweetened ricotta filling for a "canolli."  Best snowed-in day ever!

Excellent recipe. My family has been making these for a hundred years. Another good flavor to use is Anise in about the same quantities as the other flavors. My company loves them!

Almost identical to my grandmother's recipe from what I can tell. Delicious.
even made a batch of dough the day before I baked them to save some time.

These were good. I added 2 Tbsp vanilla, and liked the addition of the lemon. I wish I could figure out how to make pizzelle's uniform in size, and look like the picture attached. The flavor of these is very nice. I will try anise next time I make them. UPDATE: I tried these again, but this time I added some milk. The milk thinned the dough out which helped them to spread, plus it made the cookies crisp and thin. Just add enough milk to make the dough soft, but not runny. I didn't measure the amount I added. Also, press the iron down hard for the first 10 seconds to help the dough spread out. My cookies took about 40 seconds in total to cook. I also added 2 tablespoons of vanilla, and the zest of 2 lemons.

This recipe was very good, however, I felt they definitely had an egg taste. I am not italian so I was not sure, so I added more vanilla 1/2 way through and they turned out perfect. I sprinkled poweder sugar on them and they were fantastic. I recommend this recipe

My Italian family has been making these forever as well.  The only difference is we add anise as well as vanilla (no lemon).  My husband's Grandmother made them with Lemon, but the anise is much more flavorfull.  They are my favoite cookie and my kids love them as well.

These pizzelles are the best. I've been looking for the right pizzelle recipe and I've found it in this one.  I followed the directions exactly and they came out crispy and flavorful.

Instead of lemon zest and vanilla, I just used 2 tsp. grated lime rind.  These are super!

The base of this recipe is perfect, and you can add whatever flavors you prefer. I'm not a fan of anise (which is traditionally used), so I used  1/4 cup amaretto and  added an extra 1/2 cup of flour to keep the consistency. I left out the lemon zest because I wasn't sure how those flavors would work together. I also let the batter rest for 30 minutes before using. (As recommended by the instructions that came with my pizzelle maker.)

I had this recipe years ago when my kids were little. I made them thick though, like regular waffles. They are great for snacks. The family loved them. Thanks for posting.

I remember my grandma making these when I was little so when I saw the recipe I dug out the old pizzelle iron and tried making them.  They were as good as I remembered but I do prefer them with anise and vanilla.

These are so good! I think it's the lemon zest that makes it so delicious. Only thing I changed was I put one tablespoon  instead of one teaspoon of vanilla. I've been looking for a good pizzelle recipe for years. Well, now I need not look any further. This is a keeper. Thanks!

Great! My Grandmom used a heavy cast iron pizzelle iron that made 1 pizzelle at a time. She had to hold this heavy iron by the long handle and hold it over the fire on her stove.  My Grandmom was the best Italian cooky baker in the world.

I added more vanilla and used the juice of the lemon to soften. Anise is a strong flavor, so not using that requires more flavoring I think. This recipe is more kid friendly. I make a yogurt dip for dunking.
