This is delicious!!!  I made a couple of changes, I increased honey to 3/4 cup and added 1/8 teaspoon cloves.  Next time I will use 8 layers of dough before adding the first layer of nuts, with only 2 layers of phyllo the bottom is very mushy.  Mine was done in 43 minutes.  thanks for your recipe!

Very good recipe. I've been making baklava for years. I have always purchased a disposable foil pan (1/2 sheet cake size) and it seems to fit the full phyllo sheets perfectly. I only make a Christmastime so I have to make in large quantity and this pan yeilds approximately 60-70 pieces, depending how you cut it.

This is great and much easier than I thought.  It is very important to cover the phyllo with a damp towell while working with it. Also, use a bit more honey, like 3/4 c., and orange zest works just fine, too.  It is better with just pecans than mixed nuts.  Careful not to over-saturate the layers with butter; brush on rather than drizzle.

This is my husband's favorite desert and he said it was better than the gourmet stuff we usually buy.  I thought I could have used a little less of the syrup and more phyllo (it was VERY nutty) but it's still very good.  Great to eat alone or on vanilla ice cream!  I used pecans as the nuts and they definently added to the overall flavor.

This was AMAZING!  My boyfriend and I always get Baklava at a Greek Restaurant in town, and we both thought this was MUCH better!! It was sooooo easy to make, followed the recipe exactly, although I also had a lot of dough left over.  Mine also cooked in about half the time, good thing i was watching it!!  We took what we didnt eat that night on a road trip with his family the next day, and they devoured it!! None of them believed I actually made it, they were all impressed.  Will be making this constantly, all this talking about it makes me want more actually...... another batch here I come!

AWESOME!  Very authentic taste.  Super, super easy to make...time consuming, but easy.  This was THE HIT of the party and the best dessert there.  I followed the recipe to the tee and did not change a thing.  To those who think the syrup needed to be cooled, it does not.  I poured the entire amount of syrup over top while it was still hot and bubbly and it soaked in and hardened up just fine.  What an awesome dessert for a crowd.

I was excited to use this since I had tried baklava at the nearest Greek market in Winston-Salem. I followed this recipe to the letter and all had been fine until I followed the instructions to bake it for 50 minutes on a normal oven at home. Fifty minutes after I had placed the baklava in the oven, I discovered that it was burned and my $14 purchase to make this baklava was all for naught. 50 minutes is absolutely too long in the oven at 350 degrees.

This was awesome, I used walnuts and almonds for the nuts, and used pumpkin pie spice and lots of extra cinnamon for the spices.  I served it at a dinner party and there was only one piece left!  Also since I was pinched for time, I poured the syrup on right after it came out of the oven, and it was just fine. YUMMMM

I've never had baklava before now so I can't compare, but my family loved this recipe.  My husband kept making people try it and he's a very picky eater.  I think next time I make it I'll follow someone else's advice and use a little more honey and maybe a tad more cinnamon.  I used pecans, walnuts, and almonds.  I bought them already chopped in the baking section at the grocery store.  I didn't have lemon so I squeezed a little juice from a fresh orange in the syrup as it was simmering.  Well worth the time it takes to put everything together.

Delicious! At least as good as the baklava made by my mom's Lebonese (sp?) friend, whose baklava was the best I've ever eaten.. until now! The only thing I changed was using more phyllo sheets for base... 6 sheets instead of two. I used 1/2 walnuts and 1/2 pecans. This is a fabulous recipe, and was not difficult, just takes a little time to put it all together. Definitely worth the effort!!!

Too easy to make. Be sure everyone takes some home if there are leftovers. I ate all that was left in short order. I thought about licking the pan.

This recipe has way to little syrup. Baklava is always better the next day for flavour but this one is dry. I found baklava II on this site and it has double the syrup, same great flavour, my family wants no other recipe. A nice touch is to add a cinnamon stick to the syrup which I make before starting to make the cake, cool syrup slowly poured on the hot cake so it soaks in is best and the next day it's not soggy, hard to imagine, but just nice and syrupy. Sorry I can't give this more stars. None of us likes a dry baklava.

This is an easy awesome recipe with lovely results.  I have made this several times, using orange zest, and it's gone quickly every time.  I use more like 5-6 tbsp of the chopped nuts (I use walnut) per layer, start with 6 leaves of the phyllo and put 4 in between, top with 6, according to other reviews.  I use a Pampered Chef chopper for the nuts, goes quickly.

This is a great recipe, and it is VERY forgiving! You can use too much, or too little, of any ingredients and it still turns out fabulous! Don't worry about messing it up ... just make it! It'll turn out great.

GREAT!!!  I recommend this recipe!  My husband and I had never made Baklava before...this was our 1st attempt & it turned out perfect... we served it to 37 people at a party & got SUPER reviews...guests loved it!  We doubled the recipe...we used mixed nuts from a can & chopped them up.  We did increase the honey to 3/4 cup and used real honey.  We also put 4 lsheets of phyllo dough on the bottom and then brush/drizzled butter & nuts after every other addition of 2 sheets of phyllo.  We left the 6 sheets on top & buttered the top  one.  We cooked it for 45 min...poured the hot syrup over it.  It was perfect!

I just tried the baklava I made, which varied only slightly from this recipe, and it's not super sweet but still rather yummy.   I used all pecans for the filling, instead of the mixed nuts the recipe called for, and I used dried grated lemon peel (instead of fresh lemon zest) as well as raw honey in the syrup mixture. I buttered each of the layers using a pastry brush dipped in melted margarine, but using only as much margarine as I needed to lightly coat each layer [each layer really being a set of two sheets of the dough]. I also cut the baklava into the traditional triangles [or how it is typically sold] prior to pouring the syrup mixture into it, so that the syrup could cut through the layers.  Because I had all my ingredients ready and measured out in advance, I found no need to cover the dough with a damp cloth in between adding the layers. Phyllo dough tears so easily, it's wonderful how the boxes it is sold in these days include sheets that fit about perfectly into a 9 x 13" pan (with no need to cut it in half), so layering it all took some patience but came to roughly the half hour the recipe said it would.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Arvillalar! Surely, it's a keeper.

This was very yummy and really easy. It tastes very similar to my Greek Great Aunty Tina's recipe. Hers is thicker, so next time I will use 1.5 lbs. nuts. I used all walnuts, chopped them finely in my food processor and bumped the cinnamon up to 1.5 tsp and added a 1/4 tsp ground cloves. It's imperative to cut the baklava into pieces before baking. If you wait til after, all the phyllo layers will shatter and it won't absorb the honey syrup properly. The temp and time are perfect. Mine did not burn at all. I am bringing this to my Papouli (grandfather) who has recently been moved to a nursing home. This will surely brighten his day! Thanks for sharing this simple version of a wonderful Greek confection!

I did not have enough walnuts so I used 1/3 walnuts, 1/3 sliced almonds, and 1/3 cranberries (chopped in coffee grinder). I used homemade dandelion syrup instead of the water and sugar, I substituted orange extract for the lemon, and I boiled it for 35 minutes to reduce it. I placed buttered parchment paper on bottom and used jelly roll pan, I only needed to bake mine for 35 minutes. One recommendation I have is to try and spread the nut mixture all the way to the edges. I did not do a good job of that and I ended up with a mounded effect. Fantastic and easy, thanks.

Delicious! I don't think I'd call it easy - but baklava isn't an easy dish to prepare, which is why it's so special. I used almonds, which I chopped and toasted. I added a touch of allspice with my cinnamon, and just a bit of sugar, to mix into the nuts. The lemon zest in the syrup really adds a great flavor. Yum!

Delicious! Made half the recipe, as I had left over phyllo from another recipe, turned out great! Used walnuts and pecans.  Removed from oven after about 35 minutes.

I like to dash in extra cinnamon and nutmeg to the nuts and use orange zest instead of lemon.  I also found that using a pizza cutter prior to the buttering of the top layer gives me the least trouble when cutting it before baking.  Freshly picked pecans are wonderful if you've got 'em.  And the type of honey you use can make a big difference in the taste so pick a good one.  Try it warm with a scoop of vanilla icecream.

Good recipe! My grandma was from Athens but passed away before I could get too many of her delicious recipes - I think she would have been proud of this!! One tip though: This recipe doesn't specify that you need to put extra phyllo on the bottom of the pan. Once you pour the honey mixture on top the bottom gets saturated, so if you don't have enough phyllo it kind of falls apart. I WILL try this one again!

I agree with the others that the taste of honey is better so I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup and increased the honey by 1/4 cup.  I didn't have lemon zest so I used orange (like another reviewer) and then I added some lime zest.  Cooking the syrup, I really liked the zest flavor so I ended up using about 2-3 tsp.  You can also add more cinnamon to the syrup if you like.  I also agree with another reviewer that you need at least 8 layers of phyllo on the bottom.  I had a hard time cutting the pastry once I buttered the top layer but if I don't butter it first, they slide all over.  If I butter it first, they stick to my knife and still slide...   Flavor was great.

OMG - so good.  I followed the advice of other reviews, and upped the honey to 3/4 cup.  For my nut mixture, I used 1/3 walnuts, 1/3 pistachios (more Middle Eastern) and 1/3 macadamias (not Middle Eastern at all, but delicious!).  I whizzed the nuts in the food processor for about 30 seconds (with the cinnamon) for that fine chopped texture a la restaurant baklava.  Followed the recipe as-is in all other regards.  Superb.  Wasn't even hard, as I always though baklava would be.  Thanks so much!

Wonderful!  I used pecans and added 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves plus whole cloves on top for garnish.  I also added 1 cup honey vs. 1/2 cup honey.  Make sure you let the syrup cool completely.  I made the syrup first, and then did then pastry.  Dribble butter on the pastry first vs. trying to brush it all on.  I was really happy with the results!

Absolutely delicious. Only changes I made were a little extra cinnamon and a little more lemon zest. Everyone loved it. I checked it at 35 minutes and glad I did. It was very dark and any more time would have burned it. But simple and amazing flavor!

I pureed the mixed nuts (I used pistacios) with 1/4 cup graham crackers. I added a thin layer of fig jam. Increased the amount of honey to 3/4 cup.

Made this recipe just as written and I do not understand why some people felt the need to increase the honey, it really is superb as written. I have made this several times and always comes out fantastic, my friends and family LOVE this Easy Baklava!!!!! :)

This is a great recipe!!! It came out perfect on my first try!!! I'm really happy with it. 

I highly recommend adding extra layers of phyllo on the bottom later (I did 8 as suggested below). I also drained the lingering syrup mixture after letting it sit for about 2 min. They are not soggy at all, but very delicious.

Turned out very yummy.  I would recommend making sure you chop the nuts very fine.  Mine were not chopped small enough so they are pretty sparse in some places.

If you follow the directions exactly this wonderful dessert will come out AWESOME.  When cooking the sugar and honey mixture make sure you cook it long enough to thicken a bit.  If you don't then you may have a puddle of liquid on the bottom of your baklava.

Excellent and Easy. I used about 3/4C Honey and simmered the sauce for about 30 minutes (until it was dark golden brown). I was suprised at how much it tasted like the authenic stuff.

i wish i had never made this! my husband has been asking for it again, almost daily! the entire batch of it was gone in less than 48 hrs...i had two little pieces...the rest just disappeared! obviously a very very very good recipe. i made no changes to it. had some issues with the dough, but working with phillo i always seem too...it fell apart in strips when unrolling it...so i simply just fit it all together like a puzzle in the pan and kept going and the bars turned out perfect. will make again (and hide a few pieces for myself so i can enjoy the fruits of my labor the next time around!)

I made this for a family get-together and it was a big hit!  The only change I made was that I didn't use quite a whole pound of nuts, as previous reviewers had remarked it was quite "nutty."  I used all pecans instead of mixed nuts as well.  I will definitely make this again!

So easy and so delicious.  Usually a daunting item to make, this recipe lets anyone make this.  My father commented that he actually like it more than traditional or store bought, it is a little less sweet.

Can't go wrong with this recipe. I use pistacho... blender chop till breadcrumb like. I only use a small dash of cinnamon to give it some depth... I want to taste PISTACHO! I didnt have lemon on hand so just the honey vanilla syrup. SO gooooood.

I loved it! So easy to make and so right!. It was my first time doing it and it came out perfect. I added extra nuts (like it nutty) and did two exchanges, for less calories: 
1) used fat free margarine, instead of butter;
2)replaced half of the sugar with sweetner.
3) Did a second batch of syrup, but just honey and water, no sugar or lemon (like syrupy also:)

Delicious! Very easy to make and directions were good too. Next time I'm thinking of replacing all the sugar with sweetner (got watch my calories), I'm sure it will be delicious as well. I'll never buy baklavas again.

Thank you for sharing the recipe.:)

I just made this and it's delicious! I made a couple substitutions: raw organic Agave nectar instead of honey, and Bajan brown sugar (nice big granules) instead of white sugar. I also took someone's advice and added cloves and a cinnamon stick to the syrup. 
I cannot wait to serve this at my dinner party tomorrow night!

I've always loved eating baklava, but have been intimidated at the thought of making it myself.  I wish I'd found this recipe sooner!  I followed the directions, and the only change I made was adding a little extra cinnamon (we love it in our house) - it turned out even better than I'd hoped!  Unfortunately, it was gone the next day - my husband's buddies scarfed it up - will definitely make again!

Very good and easy recipe. The only change I made was to use rose water instead of plain water because that is what my god mother used when I was little, and it gives it a special touch.

This was easy and great. I love Baklava and I made if for one of our Christmas dinner desserts.   I reduced the sugar and added more honey, as suggested by others. I think this was good, but my batch could have used more syrup overall. Next time I wil make one and a half times the syrup.  Regardless of the little changes, this recipe was great and the product was very yummy stuff!

I think there should have been more sheets between the layers esp at the bottom... wasnt sure which nuts to use walnuts went fine but I also used hazelnuts and that wasnt too good. Cutting it before cooking resulted in the top sheets curing up and the nuts inside to overcook. It was okay but not like what I expected.

This was my first time making Baklava and I couldn't be happier!!!!  I found out this morning that I needed to have an "ethnic" dessert made by tomorrow morning for "Desserts around the World" day at my daughter's preschool.  I was pretty intimidated, but felt a little more at ease with this recipe.  I think it turned out perfectly!!!  It looks and tastes beautiful!! I could not be more pleased!  I did not change the recipe at all and was very happy with the result.

This was time consuming, but got RAVE reviews from everyone I shared it with (about 6 people or more).  It was very easy too, but the layering took awhile!  I used more phyllo sheets per layer to make it go faster, and it was still delicious and flaky.

Great!! I thought that making baklava for the first time would be complicated, but it was surprisingly easy, as long as you're gentle with the phyllo dough and use enough butter. =) They were delicious and vanished fast. The second time we made them, though, we added some almonds which was a nice touch.

Fantastic!  Learn from my mistakes though... 1. Make sure the phyllo bread is thawed.  Mine crumbled up, and was a headache to lay down in sheets.  2. Buy pre-chopped nuts; it will cut your prep time in half.  3. Watch the sauce so it doesn't over boil.. if you are using a small pan, as I did, it can overflow. Anyway, the baklava was excellent.  I had made it was a party, but once my dad and husband got their hands on it they wouldn't let it out the door.  Thanks for a recipe that makes me look impressive with very little effort!

Sweet Caesar's Ghost! Delicious! I think next time I make it I'll better saturate the sheets of phyllo dough with butter; after baking, the sheets were a little dry for my taste. The sauce poured on top was so tasty with the lemon zest!

So good! I cut my piece bigger than called for because my knife wasn't very sharp- don't do this!  The syrup didn't reach the middle of my pieces as well.  It was still really good, but I will get myself a better knife next time!

This was SUPER yummy, i added more layers of the buttered phyllo dough on the bottom and top of the baklava.  i also tweaked the mixture a little bit because all walnut was just... too nutty

I boiled 3/4 cup of dried apricot and 1/4 cup of dried cranberries in just enough water to cover for 20 minutes.  i then roughly chopped the mixture and added it to the nuts with 3 tablespoons of brown sugar.  I also added a teaspoon of nutmeg for a bit more kick. 

YUM

This recipe is THE EASIEST & THE BEST!!!! I think it might be a bit less "nutty" though if you grind up the walnuts a bit in the blender or food processor. I use pecans and walnuts and it's really great!  I also refrigerate it for a couple of hours just to sort of give it the extra "glue" it needs before serving.  Everyone loves it and it's better than the bakery kind!!!!

Wonderful!!! I made some slight changes, I'm allergic to pistachios and walnuts, and I was using ingredients in the house. I halved the recipe, used a 9"x 5" baking dish (worked great). I used half almonds,half sweetened coconut flakes, sprayed layers with butter cooking spray (way easier than melting & brushing on butter). Used local honey.43 minutes is perfect cooking time. The 2 layers on the bottom worked great for me. We couldn't wait, and ate it warm (fabulous)!

I took a tray to the office and everyone was raving about it!  and just finished a second tray for a Greek themed dinner party.  I used a walnut/pistachio blend with cardamom instead of cinnamon.  for the syrup, instead of lemon I used dried orange peel the first time, and a clementine peel the second, both were delicious.  I found the best way to cut it is to thickly butter before the last layer of dough, let it cool and harden a minute after the dough is on, the score the first layer with a metal spatula before cutting all the way through.  and then butter the top layer after it's been cut.  the dough doesn't stick to my hands and knife and peel away as much that way.  Also, I think I had significantly fewer nuts, than suggested, so I added a few layers of sugar and spice, 1 Tbs of sugar and a light sprinkle of cardamom or cinnamon.  Delish!

I just got done making this and couldn't even wait for it to cool down to try it. WOW! This is the best tasting baklava I have ever had and it makes me feel even better that I was able to make it! Definitely a must try for every aspiring baker!

Delicious!!!! increased sugar & water syrup second time by 1/2 cup each...and added cinnamon stick while simmering.  you can simply use whole sheets, and just fold them over ( was easier to keep track of layers), and after looking at many recipes, and watching a video from "food network', did this: 8 sheets ( 4 full/folded) as base...and on top...with 2 sheet layers inbetween.....and garnished top with crushed pistachio mmmmmh!!. took it to a birthday party, and apparently was a 'favorite of the night' of 25 people! :)

I've made this recipe a handful of times and it turns out excellent every time. A little bit time consuming but so worth the effort. My only change is that I leave out the lemon zest. Very yummy!

First time ever making baklava, and it came out just about perfect with this recipe!  I used pistachios, almonds, and cashews, pretty much in equal parts.  I would never use pecans for this recipe, because it is already very sweet.  But that's only a personal preference from someone who doesn't even like pecan pie.  I also upped the honey to about 3/4 C, and added a little extra lemon zest as well.  I put 6 layers of phyllo on the bottom, but next time I will try 8. Bottom is a little fragile.  But, that doesn't seem to be stopping it from disappearing!  Thanks for sharing this.

I had been looking for an easy and quick baklava that didn't skimp out on flavor and this is it!!! The only thing that varied for me was cooking time. My baklava was done in about 25 to 30 minutes. Other than that, it was wonderful. I will make it again.

I always thought that making baklava was a time-consuming and difficult thing to do, but these were surprisingly easy!  Definitely well worth the cost of the phyllo dough and nuts.  The first batch I made with walnuts and pine nuts, the second batch I will make with pecans and walnuts.  I made the sugar syrup first and let it cool while I was making the rest, and once I took out the baklava from the oven I poured the semi-cool syrup over top of it.  The phyllo stayed nice and crispy that way for me.  The only change that I am making for the next time is to increase the sugar syrup by 1.5X, and maybe substitute some corn syrup for some of the honey.  I know, not authentic...but still delish!  Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe!

This one did not work for me at all.  Because there was no sugar on the nuts the syrup did not cover a lot of the nuts making the baklava dry and not very sweet on the inside.  Also one 16oz package of phillo seems like too much.

Yummy!  I have never attempted to make Baklava - but after reading the reviews, I decided to try this one.  Man am I glad I did.  It was time consuming, but very easy overall.  I used a mixture of walnuts, peacans, and almonds for my nut mixture.  It also took only about 35-40 minutes to completely bake.  So keep an eye on it.  This was a big hit - and it looks so professional at the end!

Delicious and easy.  I slightly messed up with the phyllo dough (I didn't use as much as was stated, as it just filled up the pan more quickly), and was worried how that would impact it.  But everyone LOVED it.  And...they seem to think I slaved over it.

The only slaving is the chopping of nuts.  Leave yourself ample time.  I used pistachios and walnuts (50% each), and I think that it is the perfect mix.

Great recipe!  More layers than any other baklava recipe I've tried, and well worth the effort. The thinner layers make it easier to cut.  I used a mixture of ground almonds and chopped walnuts.  Instead of cutting the pastery, I simply folded the sheets and layered one folded sheet at a time.  Well done!!

Make sure to check the time constantly! It says it's suppose to bake for 50 minutes so I'm not sure why my batch burnt after 30 minutes. I did three layers of nuts but they were lightly sprinkled on so maybe that had something to do with it. I think I used less than a pound so next time I will make sure I have the right amount. This it the first time I've made it so I may try a different recipe for it or try a smaller amount. The syrup came out great!

This was a great recipe. I like how versatile it is with the nuts.  I used a mixture of pecans and walnuts.  I only had one problem and it was totally my fault because I apparently am not taking the "simple" party of simple syrup literally.  I didn't cook the simple syrup long enough and perhaps that is the reason why the baklava turned out a little soggy.  Same great flavor but really soggy on the bottom.

I made it with whole walnuts, forgetting they were supposed to be chopped. Tasted delicious, but looked lumpy. Lol, now I know for next time!

I made this lastnight for a greek theme dinner I'm having tonight. I was afraid that I was going to mess something up but it was pretty easy.  I cut it into diamonds and had a taste lastnight...WOW! I can't wait to serve this to my guests! Great recipe thanks! UPDATE: I've won 2 baking contests with this recipe and my Euro travling friend says it better than anything he's ever had.

It's been many years since I last tasted baklava.  However, I do remember it being flaky; mine didn't turn out flaky.  Maybe I goofed the syrup?  Turned out sticky and damp. Next time I won't drench it w/ the syrup mixture. Everyone still liked the taste though.

I could not find my Baklava recipe so I tried this one.  For our taste it had way too much vanilla and it overwhelmed the lemon zest even though I added two teaspoons of zest.  Good, but way too much of a vanilla cookie flavor.

This was very easy to assemble, but, somewhat time consuming.  It cut very nicely and baked up perfect.  Not nearly as good as what I get from a bakery back home, but, not getting any 'homemade' Baklava in our new area---this was very good.  I only used walnuts & I ground them very fine.

It's a great recipe. Of course it's better than what you would buy in a store! No HFCS, or trans fatty acids; just healthy walnuts & good ol' wholesome ingredients. It's what dessert is all about! And it's easy too--my 11 year old daughter makes it again & again. Each time everyone raves about it. Yum!

This was amazing!  I put a damp towel on the counter, then placed the sheets of dough on top of it, then placed another damp towel on top of the dough to keep it from drying out.  I tried cutting it into triangles, but it got pretty messy.  Next time I will just cut it into squares.

This was awesome!  Everyone at work said it was better than any restaurant baklava they'd every had.  I had never used phyllo dough before, so I had some trouble, but with enough butter and nut mixture, it still worked out great.  And I loved pouring the hot sugar mix over the top.  Awesome!

Rec'd RAVE reviews when making this. It may be "easy", but it's still very time consuming. I had tried to make it special by following another reviewer's suggestion of apricots, while it may have added a nice texture - def. slowed the process down as the mixture became sticky to work with.

I hate to go against the majority, but my family didnt like this at all.  They all said it was too sweet.  I love sweet things, but I felt the same.  Tried it the next day to see if it tasted better and it was even worse.  Sorry - Wont be making this one anytime soon.

I like this recipe but I don't think the use of Honey is a good idea,... no matter how much I simmered it, the combination wouldn't thicken, but rather had a watery feel to it. Instead I mixed 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 1 cup of water and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice,.. simmered them and they turned out fine. I think baklava needs a thicker syrup,... but otherwise, great recipe!

This recipe is super easy and delicious. I had never used phyllo dough before, but my first batch of baklava turned out awesome. I did not used chopped mixed nuts. I used shelled walnuts, and I chopped them up real fine in the coffee grinder. Also, I found that laying a damp cloth over the phyllo dough just caused the top layer of dough to adhere to the cloth in a sticky mess, so I skip that step now! I think you could experiment with different nut combinations, such as walnuts + pistachios, for a unique flavor every time. Print this recipe and save it!

My first phyllo bread dish! My dessert turned out ugly looking but tasty. Well, I used too much butter, and there was plenty of 'sauce' left over ( makes GREAT pancake syrup)It was too sweet - next time I will use 1/2 cup sugar (I'll try brown sugar) . The nut/cinn. mixture made a delicious filling and it tastes better the next day. Definiately needs a second try for 'tweaking'

Easy recipe to follow, I added a little more cinnamon to the nuts (I love the taste of cinnamon!) and I also added additional honey to the water mixture.  The end result was phenomenal, absolutely delicious!  This recipe will remain in my recipe box - I can't wait to make it again!

This was my first time making baklava, so I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  The only small change I made was only cooking it for 45 minutes instead of 50, but every oven is different, so you just have to know your oven.  It came out perfect!

AWESOME!! While I was trepidatious about trying this recipe, I was surprised at how easy it was. As a fan of Baklava, I love this recipe. It's simple, easy, and delicious. Also, I recommend that you try this recipe with Orange extract and orange zest - for an original taste. Highly recommended.

I've enjoyed baklava since introduced to my college roommate's favorite dessert decades ago. However, this is hands down the most tender and moist version I've ever tasted. My coworker made this recipe for a Christmas gift and I asked her for the recipe. I made it for my husband's coworkers and they now ask for it specifically. I followed the recipe exactly. Also, I found the video helped make it not quite as daunting a task!

This was the first time I've made baklava and it was delicious!  I did make a couple of adjustments though.  Instead of grated lemon zest I used 3/4 TBSP freshly squeezed lemon juice.  I also used 3/4 cup honey instead of 1/2 cup and added a few extra phyllo layers to the bottom, brushing butter lightly in the pan first.  I used a disposable pan but noticed that I accidentally cut a couple of small holes in it when I was cutting the baklava.  When I added the juice, it was running out of the holes.  It still turned out delicious though.  My family raved about this baklava and I plan on making this for our toga party in Feb. Great recipe!

I do not cook at all, but my husband LOVES Greek so I thought I would make him a full meal. He LOVED this - and so did I...and my in-laws...people were not only shocked that I cooked it, but how much better it was then anything they had before (including from Europe and local resturants) Very good. I must say, I impressed myself. Everyone is asking when I plan on making it again! :) Definitely added to the favorites!

This was a great recipe.  I added 1/2 cup of sugar to the nut and cinnamon mixture, I wasn't sure if the cinnamon would mix in well with out sugar.  It was great!

Was very excited about making this recipe until i realized didnt have as many walnuts as i thought i did, so it was made but at a much smaller scale. Deeeeeelicious! My husband and i always treat ourselves to a piece when we are out for dinner and it was so good to know we can now save ourselves money and make it on a smaller scale just for the two of us. Thank you!!!

My first attempt at making Baklava, and our guests are still raving about it weeks later! It did take me longer to assemble than the recipe said, but I'm sure it will go faster next time. Actually, the most trouble I had with this recipe was envisioning cutting it as described (Where's the picture? I ended up just cutting squares and placing on the plates at an angle)! ;)

I used all walnuts, minus a couple tablespoons of pecans (they were leftover, so I used 'em). This recipe turned out just as good as any Greek restaurant's does. If I ever decide to torture myself with the monotony of making baklava again, I will definately repeat this recipe!

This recipe was wonderful!  It took some time to make, and you do need to handle the dough carefully to prevent it from tearing. I brought this in to work for a coworker's birthday and it got rave reviews!  I will be making this again!

Delicious! I thought it was good when I followed the proportions, but it got even better when I changed things around a bit. I only had a 9 x 9 pan and used half of the dough (the dough I bought came in two packages of 8 oz each). I used 12 oz nuts (pecans and walnuts), and I doubled the cinnammon, and added a few dashed of nutmeg.

For the syrup, I used 3/4 of the amount in the recipe, except for the lemon zest. I used the zest of an entire large lemon. This made the baklava very lemony, and makes it distinct.

Good!  Made a few changes. . . used orange zest instead of lemon, didn't have lemon!  Made half a recipe and it was just as much work!  Also would advise that you just sprinkle nuts over each layer.  I put a heaping teaspoon on each layer and had a ton of phyllo dough left over.  Very good!

I'm so excited I can make baklava at home! It's too easy. Working with phyllo dough was a bit tough at first but after a couple layers I got into it. YumYumYum. Mine did burn a bit. I followed the recipe exact so it could have been an error I made or my electric oven. ANYONE CAN MAKE THIS! Try it!

I haven't had a Baklava this good in years. I used to pay a dollar for smaller pieces than the ones you get with this recipe and those weren't half as good. I won't be paying for them anymore, these are great and so EASY!! If you like Baklava , you'll LOVE this recipe. Buen provecho!!

This recipe was rediculously easy.  It was also delicious.  It wasn't nearly as sweet as I was expecting.  I used a combination of pistachio nuts and almonds.  I chopped them in the food processor.  I think that I will make about half of the nuts into a finer grind and leave the rest a little chunky.   I doubled the cinnamon.  Next time, I will make sure to cut it into smaller pieces.  That way each piece gets a little more syrup.  This is absolutely a keeper recipe.

I made this for my mother who loves baklava, only she can't have sugar so I made it sugar-free!  I used Splenda instead of the sugar and a honey imatation sold at Wal-Mart.  It was wonderful!  Very rich and sweet.

This is very similar to my recipe.  We use more walnuts , more honey and a pinch of nutmeg but it's the closest one I have found to the recipe  used in our family.

I have made this twice and followed the recipe as written. It is wonderful. I prefer pecans so I used them rather than mixed nuts the second time and it was wonderful. This recipe is so easy I had my kids make it. Super easy and super yummy, highly recommend. On a side note, I didn't set a timer for when it should be done, I just checked on it until it was golden brown. Also, it is better the next day.

Turned out fantastic! Although, we are making it again today and doubling up the laters of Phylo! AWESOME!

Update: Did 8 Layers on bottom, 3 between each layer of nuts (walnuts and pistachios) and 7 layers on top. Baked for ONLY 35 minutes! (50 would have burnt it in our oven). Upped the honey to 3/4 cup... I think I have achieved Nirvana.

I tweaked this to make it the best I've ever had. First, watch your honey. I find clover honey is mild and I like it best.  Different honeys taste different. Second, I add an extra 1/4 cup of water and a bit more honey. I like it a little wetter. Third, I add a 1/4 cup of sugar to the nuts. Finally, make that extra bit of water Rose Water. It's a magical little secret ingredient, and I don't know if it does much, but a dear friend told me about it, and they knew their stuff. I love this.

Disappointing. The timing was WAY off, the syrup cooked down way too quickly and turned tacky and hard, didn't soak into the cookies but just stayed on the top. The cookies cooked a bit too quickly as well.

Traditional (Greek and Turkish) recipes have way more layers (5+) on the top and bottom; I tried this one based on rave reviews, but was disappointed. The whole things wasn't like a cookie, more like loose stacks of papers with nuts between....

Very easy to make; however, be sure to make up the syrup ahead of time in order for it to have a chance to cool down.  I make it the night before and refrigerate it.  If you pour hot syrup on hot baklava, it will get soggy.

I've been making baklava for many years. I usually  use a large cookie sheet. And triple your ingredients. But this time I followed your  recipe to the letter and used a 9x13 pan. Came out really good. Thank you

This is my go to  Baklava Recipe for every Holiday, If i could give it 10 stars I would!! Everyone raves over my baklava and all I change is I add a little more butter at least 1/2 cup more (Butter makes anything taste good I think). I also use a spray bottle to spray the butter on each layer! Happy Cooking Everyone!

I've made it a couple of times now and tweaked it slightly and although time consuming is very easy. 

Thanks for posting.

I made this for a Christmas Pot Luck at work and everybody raved about it. I was even offered to be paid to make a tray for my co-workers family Christmas dinner. So good, so easy!I only had pecans, so that's the only nut I used and I did not use lemon zest. Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this recipe, and have made it several times. Many times I have used just half of the phyllo dough package, as the other half I used for spanakopita. Make sure to take the time to reduce the syrup down, otherwise it will drip when you're eating it. I found that my friend's home produced honey was much more flavorful than the store bought variety.

Followed the recipe as written. Everything was going perfectly until it was time to cut the diamond shapes before putting in oven. With the top layer buttered, and trying to cut as the directions described, the phyllo was sticking to my fingers, and I wasn't quite getting the diamond shape. I ended up cutting squares instead; it was a little easier. Otherwise this was a very easy recipe. A bit time consuming, but it turned out great! Very tasty!

First time I have made these, and they are very nice. I wish I had not read the post about more syrup! They were so sweet that nobody would eat more then a small piece at one time. I will do them again but just use the syrup quantity shown here.

Make work easier by not cutting dough in half.... Instead keep whole place one half in pan let Then fold other half over to create layers.... Less handling of the dough.   Also flavor syrup with cloves and cover dough with damp towel when not using....

I tried this dessert on my boyfriend's Italian family (who really know how to cook) and everyone loved it!  Very simple to make and delicious.  I substituted peanuts for other nuts becuase my boyfriend is allergic to nuts.  Great recipe though!

Maybe a little more buttery than I like, but very good. I used expresso honey ('cause that was all I had) and all pistachios, and put a little rosewater in the syrup. I also probably put in more like 1tbsp of cinnamon, 'cause I really like cinnamon. I made sure my syrup was room temp before adding it to the hot baklava, and I was worried it would still be soggy but has firmed up nicely since it cooled. I didn't make nice diamonds, mostly 'cause my knives are kinda cheap, but it still tastes good :)

Sooo good. If you have the time and like to bake, it's actually a fun dessert to assemble. It takes a little time and patience but the result is well worth the effort. I didn't know to butter the top layer and took it back out of the oven to do that when it started getting brown and crisp on top. Definitely a dessert to make again.

What a great way to impress people!  Baklava sounds so exotic, but was easy to prepare and tastes great!  Recipe is a bit time consuming, so it's for special occasions only.

Like the name says, it is easy. And possibly the best baklava I've ever had! This was the first time I ever used phyllo, let alone made baklava, and I couldn't have found a better recipe to start with. The party I made this baklava for raved about it, saying they could each eat the whole pan. One thing: I had forgotten to butter the pan prior to layering the phyllo and nuts. Although I was using a brand new non-stick pan, it seems buttering the pan wasn't necessary, since the phyllo didn't stick or burn.

Yum! I never made baklava before and have only eaten it maybe twice, but this was so good!  I did end up with about five extra layers left over.  Also I wasn't sure if I was supposed to butter the top layer or not, so I did, and it got all fouled up when it came time to cut the baklava, so I know next time not to.

I have never made baklava, it seemed like it might be too hard as I've never worked with phyllo pastry before but I made this and it turned out fantastic!
I followed the recipe exactly, except for the lemon zest, and I am so impressed.
I will make this many more times.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I had never used phyllo dough before and didn't know that I was supposed to brush every single piece with butter.  If I had done that it would have been perfect!

This really was pretty easy to make.  The biggest surprise was that the phyllo has to THAW... haha... I've never worked with it before, so I had no idea. I made it late in the evening,  so I refrigerated it for the night.  I actually think I prefer it cold. Less mess and stays together better! Oh... one thing... I had read reviews that stated cooking time was very different for them, so I started watching it at about 25 minutes. I had to force myself to leave it in the oven for 35 minutes... it had looked done for ten minutes.

What a wonderful recipe! It took about 35-40 minutes of baking time in my convection oven on 350 F. I made extra syrup, plus zested and squeezed a small orange into it. I also added a cinnamon stick into the syrup while it was simmering. Five stars!

After assembling the baklava I put it in the fridge for half an hour then cut it into the diamond shapes, I found it much easier when the pastry was cold.  I also used honey in the syrup instead of all sugar.  It was so delicious, I took it in for a food day at work and everyone love it.

I have a home-based treat business and this is one of my most popular items! I omit the zest and followed the advice of other reviewers by making sauce first and keeping in fridge while it’s baking.

Simply put, this is a truly remarkable recipe. Probably the best recipe I've made from AllRecipes in recent months (and we try new stuff nearly every Saturday). 

Man-oh-man this is tasty. And easy. I was blown away with how good this stuff is.

I added ONE shake of salt to the syrup.  I thought it was slightly bland.  Next time I will try adding more lemon zest and see if I can skip the salt.  A pizza cutter works great for cutting the dry stack of sheets to size.

Anyone found a way to keep the top sheets from sticking to your fingers when cutting them before the bake?  Maybe buttering each sheet  of the top sheets so they would stick together?

I see no reason to try any other recipe.  This was FAST, easy, and delicious!

This recipe turned out fantastic.  I used mostly walnuts and pecans because this is what we had and mix was about 70/30. I read the reviews so I adjusted the recipe as follows 3/4 c of honey, 2 tsp of cinnamon (we love cinnamon) and 2 tsp vanilla. I also layered it differently and found this method looked amazing.  I layered 8 pieces of phyllo, buttering between every 2 layers. Then spread one 3 rd of the nut mixture, then another 8 layers buttering every 2nd one and then adding another 3rd of the mixture and so on until you have the last 8 sheets for the top and butter all over. I would also like to suggest that this recipe is a lot easier with two people assembling and cutting. One person picks up 2 sheets at a time and butters while the other quickly opens and covers the towel over the dough. With the cutting, one person would hold down the layers of dough and the other very cuts very carefully. Hubby took to work and had lots of requests for the recipe.

Loved it! Next time I will blend the nuts a bit more, I left some a bit to chunky which made the filling 'crumble' when taking a bite. The syrup was great even though I forgot the lemon rind, next time I will make just a bit more (say 20%). My only recommendation is to make it the day before so the syrup has 'set' every layer together. Everyone still loved it! Will definitely make it again.

Friends said it's the best Baklava they've ever tasted.
I used a little extra vanilla. The 2nd time I used about a half teaspoon of orange extract. Pistachios went over very well
I also made a gluten-free version. I bought gluten-free puff pastry, rolled it out as thin as I could (use potato starch to keep things from sticking) and keep the rest the same.
I also went a little heavy on the liquid part, extra water.

This recipe turned me into a baklava fan. It's so easy and tastes so good. The only changes I made to it were based on info I got from the comments. I used less nuts, doubled up on the cinnamon, used less sugar and honey and added a clove to the syrup. Will be making again soon!

I like using pistachios and walnuts.  They break easy with my meat tenderizer.  What is timer didn't bind of nuts and I had to use peanuts to fill in to get to a pound and I do not like the taste of peanuts. L too strong and overpower the pistachios and walnuts.  Also they don't break up too nice. Aside from that, the recipe came out great! Maybe I would have used a little more lemon zest but it was a really good

I added cloves to the honey, sugar mixture, used walnuts and pistachios for the nuts, put 5 sheets phyllo on the bottom and most importantly, allowed 5 minutes for the dish to cool before ladling on the liquid. Excellent!

Excellent recipe! My son said that it was the best he had ever eaten.  My only suggestion would be to chop the nuts very fine so that the layers will stick together.  Mine did tend to fall apart. I will be using this recipe from now on.

Good thing I did a test run of this, because apparently phyllo dough is not the same thing as puff pastry. 

As for my second attempt: I think it turned out pretty well and fairly easily survived a subway ride, frantic cab ride, bus ride, and car ride to get to its destination. Friends and I thought it tasted fantastic. Don't skip out on the lemon zest: It really puts a unique spin on the dessert. 

A made a few minor changes: I took others' suggestions and started with more layers of dough on the bottom, which was, I think, a good move. There was a lot of liquid so the extra layers sopped it all up. I sometimes used an extra layer of phyllo throughout the layering if pieces were sticking together. I used a combination of pecans and walnuts. I also made less than the full cup of melted butter the second time around, because even if you slather on a health amount of butter, you do not need that much.

The only thing that I would say is to make 3/4 the amount of sauce. there was just a tad bit left over that I didn't want to add, but otherwise it was delicious.

I used all pistachio and my husband said it was just as good if not better than the ones we buy at the Greek festival! Going to save up my money (pistachios are crazy expensive!) and make it again.  I was a bit conflicted on whether to go with salted or unsalted nuts....I chose unsalted. I felt like it could have used a bit of salt but worry that salted pistachios would be too much salt.

Very easy, really good... 50 minutes is too long though, took mine out after 40, it was plenty dark, top & bottom. The sauce is thin, don't worry, pour it on, it thickens up when cool. Excellent after 2 hours, but even better the next day and fantastic after 2 days, so make ahead :)  Don't butter the top, it's harder to cut & sticks to your knife and fingers... so I flipped the top layer over to the dry side and it cut much easier and after baking it was no different to the buttered top squares. Lovely recipe, don't think I'd change a thing :)

I've made this several times and my family loves it (so do I!) I use pecans and walnuts and 3/4 cup orange blossom honey. Six sheets on bottom and six on top. Everything else just as the recipe states. I feared the filo for many years, no more! Thanks!

Lovely recipe if you do it just right. I use a lot of lemon zest and a bit extra butter and extra honey. The type and size of nuts makes a huge difference as does the phyllo dough.

Overall, this dish is AMAZING! It is quite easy to make- depending on your patience but the only trouble we had was with the syrup. But, hands to the creator of this recipe! You managed to make a crunchy, moist, and heart warming dish. Since we weren't serving 36 people we cut down by half, and used a smaller pan for the baklava. Next time we do this recipe, we will try to be verrryyyyy careful with the phylo-dough. The phylo-dough breaks very easy! And of course we are going to make it again sometime soon! It's a very nice end to a full-length Greek styled dinner :)

SO delicious Followed the recipe, but be careful how long you put it in the oven. I left it in for 30 minutes and it was crunchy. I have a gas stove though. This will be a great christmas gift.

I made it for a school assignment and it was so good. I have never had baklava before so I didn't know how it was going to taste but I really liked it. The phyllo dough was a bit hard to find at the local market but I found it in the frozen section. All my class mates loved it. I thought it was going to be really hard but it was really easy. I am 15 and barely cook so I loved making this and will defiantly make it again.

My 17 yr old son and I made this together and cut out the word, PROM? for his official promposal to his Junior Senior Prom. She said Yes and the rest of the family enjoyed every last morsel of what was left over. If my son could make this (he does NOT bake!), anyone can do this!

It was a good recipe. It is not to sweet, but it's sweet enough. The zest really changed the taste. We buy baklava from a Greek restaurant and this was way better.

Wonderful! I didn't know baklava was so simple, even if it is rather time consuming. Made it for a preschool bake sale and it went over pretty well. I plan to make this again for christmas time.

BEST EVER! Better than restaurant baklava. I used both Walnuts and Pecans, added a little more cinnamon and made a double batch. Incredibly yummy.
