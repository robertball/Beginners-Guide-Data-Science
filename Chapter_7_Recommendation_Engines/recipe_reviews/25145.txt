This recipe rocks, but that goodness I read all the reviews and got creative a bit. The best thing about this recipe is that you really don't have to measure anything, and that is the way I like to cook! I cooked it at the firehouse and my crew went crazy for it. Here are the things I changed.  First, I grilled a whole onion and about a tablespoon of garlic in oil before putting the chicken in. I at least, if not more, doubled the salsa and also added several tablespoons of chipotle sauce for spiciness and flavour.  I tore up corn tortillas and made one layer on top of the first half of chicken mixture, then piled the rest on top, all in a pyrex bowl (we had no 9x13 baking dishes at the station, but I baked it in the bowl and it turned out perfect).  Also, next time I probably will not drain the beans and only some of the water off the corn. I served it with cornbread, a green salad and mexican rice. Soooo yummy.  My favorite recipe to date!!!!

This was a great starter recipe, but like others, I felt it needed some doctoring. I followed advice and cooked up onions and garlic with the chicken, added more salsa and a can of green chilis, left the liquid in the beans and corn, and a cup of minute rice was mixed in right before I put it in the oven. I didn't have any chips, so I tore up a couple of tortillas, placed them over the casserole and added cheese to the top a few minutes before taking it out of the oven. They worked out great and came out nice and crispy. I also made the whole thing in a medium skillet (with metal handles) and put it right into the oven, making it a one-dish meal. Less cleaning is best in my book :)
A great change from tacos, and was great at work for lunch the next day.

Living (born and bred) in New Mexico, our chili is either red or green and our beans are refried.  Meals or salsa with black beans are considered on the gourmet end of our very basic love for spicy foods served traditionally with pinto beans and spanish rice.  As a matter of fact, my husband won't even consider ordering ANYTHING made with black beans.  Tonight I served him Sue's Mexican Casserole (he even watched as I added the beans) and not only did he have seconds, but he specifically asked me to make sure I make it again.  If it's dry you're either not adding enough water, adding too many chips, or cooking it too long.  Adios! from The Land of Enchantment!

Ah we all loved this! I used some of the suggestions from others and chopped up 1/3 of an onion and sauteed it with the chicken in olive oil, used 3/4 cup of salsa, omitted the water and just didn't drain the beans or corn, used a 15 oz can of corn, added a cup of minute rice right before putting it in the stove, and used about 2 cups of cheese! Was incredibly easy and very fast; I'm sure this will be a family staple.

Very quick all-in-one meal.  Everyone had seconds and commented it was yummy.  I added fresh cilantro & 4oz of cream cheese to the meat mixture and served it with extra salsa & sour cream.  A++ recipe for taste and for how easy it is to prepare.  Because of the rave reviews (unprompted) by my kids (7yrs & 5yrs) I'll be making this recipe often.

I doubled this recipe and put half each into a square baking pan.  I do think the recipe would be too thin in a 9X13 pan.  One of the pans I took to a potluck.  I didn't put the additional cheese on top and it was still very good.  I shredded the chicken rather than keeping the breasts whole.  I'd suggest using a better quality salsa for additional punch.  I used Trader Joe's Taquera Salsa and it sure added a wonderful tasting dimension to this casserole.  Two thumbs up!

SO EASY TO MAKE AND EVERYONE REALLY LIKED IT!!  I DID LEAVE OUT THE SALSA AND ADD PICANTE SAUCE-HOT.  I ALSO USED THE ONIONS AND GARLIC WHEN COOKING THE CHICKEN.  I LEFT OUT THE CHIPS.  SERVED IT WITH SOUR CREAM, CHIPS, CHOPPED TOMATOES AND EXTRA PICANTE SAUCE.  WILL BE MAKING THIS AGAIN.

I used ground beef once and it was terrific.
I also used the liquid from the beans and the corn in place of the water called for. Added extra flavor!

This was so easy and great too! My husband loved it and even my 19 month old cleaned her plate. I didn't follow the recipe to the letter though, I used 1 lb of chicken, a whole envelope of seasoning, a slightly larger can of corn, and enough salsa to coat the other ingredients (I didn't measure it). I probably added about 1/4 c of water for simmering. My husband said I should make this more often. I'm not crazy about Mexican style food, but it wasn't too spicy (use spicy salsa if you like the heat). A hit with my family!

I thought this was really good, and was amazed that my picky pre-schoolers liked it too.  I added a small can of mild green chilies, and also added the remainder of the taco seasoning to the water I used to cook rice as a side dish.  In the future I will use a smaller pan than specified since it dried out a bit and was more like a dip in a 9x13 pan.

Ok my family loved this, however, I did make several changes.  First off, I parboiled 4 large, skinless chicken thighs, deboned and cubed the meat.  I sauted 3/4 cup of diced onions and a tablespoon of minced garlic in a tablespoon of canola oil.  I then tossed the chicken with 1/2 tsp of cumin and added to the pan with a large can of black beans, undrained, 1 can of rotel tomatoes, also undrained.  I then added 1 cup frozen sweet corn, 1/4 cup taco seasoning and 1 cup chicken stock.  I simmered this all together for about 15 minutes.  While this was simmering, I cooked a pack of instant rice (about 2 cups cooked).  I stirred the cooked rice in with the chicken mixture and poured into my baking dish.  I then topped with 2 cups crushed tortilla chips and 2 cups mexican mix cheese (we like cheese).   I served this with a green salad and corn bread.  Thankfully there is enough for all 4 of us to take for lunch tomorrow.

I cooked onion and bell pepper with the chicken, but other than that followed the directions. I would give it five stars, but it was just good, not great. Will make again, possibly with leftover shredded pork.

This was pretty good. It has the potential to be excellent and next time I will make a few changes. I will add sauteed onions and shred the chicken rather than cube it, it seemed too chunky for the beans and corn.  There is not enough salsa or cheese in the recipe, but the flavors are very nice.

Very tasty, but as many other reviewers said 1/4 cup of salsa is just not enough.  I had planned on using 1 cup, but even THAT wasn't enough and I ended up using the whole jar.  I mean really, why add water when you can add more salsa?  It's also important to pick a good salsa as this dish is strongly flavored by it.  Anything from Pace is really disgusting in my opinion, and nothing like a real salsa (I live in Southern California and have had my share!).  I used Vons/Safeway brand roasted tomato with cilantro flavor.  It's pretty good and cheap.  Anyway, I needed to use up some pre cooked chicken breast strips (Foster Farm) so I just diced those and skiped the first step where you fry the chicken in the oil.  I also used the whole packet of taco seasoning, but I found one that said low sodium so I bought that.  I didn't bother to measure the cheese or chips, I just put enough on to layer it.  So the flavor of this was really good, but the cosistancy was just that of beans and salsa.  I think it would be better with some pasta in it, like macaroni pasta, or rice.  Just something to give it structure.  I certainly could have used less salsa, but 1 cup wasn't enough to wet the mixture of chicken, beans, and corn so I'm not sure what the solution is.  It was very easy to make, very tasty, and just needs each person's slight tweaking to make it great.

This is definitely a keeper!  I followed several suggestions from other reviews:  I sauteed one whole medium yellow onion, sauteed the chicken (I used 1 lb instead of 3/4 lb), then added the beans (I drained and rinsed them first), the corn UNDRAINED and a 15 oz can instead, an entire jar of salsa, added a 4 oz can of green chiles and about a handful of cilantro.  I didn't add any extra water as the recipe suggested and it turned out fine...the water from the can of corn and salsa was enough. I also added a cup of instant brown rice and mixed thoroughly just before putting in the oven.  When it was done, I added a dollop of sour cream on the top to mix in.  

The hubby and I both liked this one!  He went for seconds :-)

This dinner was, as Ned Flanders would say, scrumdiddlydoodliumptious!! I used Taco Seasoning I recipe on here instead of a packet, layered flour tortilla on the bottom of round pyrex, and another on top of all the chicken/beany goodness, in between additional layers of Mexi-cheese and baked 325 covered for 15-20 min., then uncovered for another 10 min. Slop on the sour cream, sprinkle on the cilantro and this was a supper win!

This could be a decent base for a main course. I'm never a fan of not seasoning the meat, so I had to cook the chicken with the taco seasoning before adding in the rest. It could also use some additions to give it more character. But the thing that frustrated me the most is that a 9x13 pan is way too big for this. I could barely smear it around and cover the bottom. Ended up transferring to a 7x11 pan. Even there it was only about an inch in depth.

A lot like "Restaurant Style Chicken Dip" but with beans/corn. Add at least 3 small tomatos. It needs the moisture. Leave out the chips and serve with the meal.

The Best STARTER Recipe for a quick weekday night dinner.  I didn't have taco seasoning mix but that's easily remedied with chili powder, cumin, garlic, onion, cilantro and chipotle seasoning. I did have some taco rice mix so I cooked and spread it on the bottom of a large casserole dish, then spread a can of (drained and rinsed) black beans.  This way the black beans don't get crushed and mushy.  I sauteed the chicken with some chopped onions, seeded and thinly sliced pablono pepper, two large chopped tomatoes, can of corn, can of Rotel, can of sliced black olives and added extra cilantro, cumin, chili powder and chipotle seasoning.  After draining some of the juices from the skillet, I then took the chicken mixture and added a can of tomato sauce and placed it all on top of the rice and beans in the casserole.  I then topped this with mexican shredded cheese and let bake in the oven till nice and hot.  Since we only had a 1/4 bag of broken tortilla chips, I put those on the bottom of the plate and then the casserole with a dollop of sour cream on top.  Yummy!  I will definitely do a bunch of variations depending upon what I have on hand.  Thank you Suezqz_64 for the recipe!

I added bell peppers, onions, rotel, stewed tomatoes, and cilantro. I also subbed corn tortillas instead of chips. It was delicious - like a mexican lasagna (I layered the meat/vege mixture with tortillas and cheese 2xs).

This recipe is DELISH!!!!  It doesn't need any alterations.
I don't like cooking my chicken in oil though - so I did cook mine a little differently.  I put it in the crockpot in the morning with a can of chicken broth and let it slow cook all day.  Then when I got home from work I pulled it out and it shredded beautifully.  The shredded chicken really went well in the recipe!!!!  And it made prep time nil for a working mom.  I also used a whole pack of taco seasoning and it wasn't too spicey!
Yummmmmmmmo!

Just delicious!  I will certainly be serving this one again.  I followed many suggestions: added much more salsa, juice from the beans and corn, sauted chopped onions and garlic, green onions, mild green chilis, and sliced black olives. I stirred in sour cream before adding the mixture to the casserole dish.  Next time I want to cook and then shred the chicken instead of cubing it, as I think that will go better in this sort of casserole, and perhaps mix about half of the crushed tortilla chips into the casserole.  A little crunch on top is nice, but I also like the taste of tortilla chips or soft tortillas cooked in sauce.

The taste of this was good.  I added a little garlic to the chicken while cooking, and also a little onion powder.  Used all the liquid from a regular size can of corn and also left the liquid from the beans as well.  I think If I make it again I'd cut at least half of the corn water, as it was a little too runny for my tastes.  I also upped the salsa a little.  Good, easy, last minute meal, but nothing amazing.

Added about 1/2 cup each diced red onion, diced red pepper and a couple of grated cloves of garlic to some hot oil before adding the chicken.  Also added 2 cups of water and a cup of basmati rice to give it a big more volume (and because my husband wanted rice).  Also used cool ranch doritos, which added some additional flavor.  Baked it in the oven-proof skillet that I cooked the chicken in.

So good and easy!  Took other suggestions and did not drain the corn or beans, also doubled the amount of salsa.  I put a layer of chips on the bottom, then chicken mixture, then a small layer of chips on top covered by the cheese.  I think next time I will put in some chopped Jalapeno into the chicken mixture to try and give it a little more kick.  I usually put a whole packet of taco seasoning in.

Very easy to make and kids really liked it.  I bought a rotisserie chicken at the store and pulled the meat from it after cooling.  It was very tender and faster than having to brown and cube the chicken breast.

I thought this would be so much better given the ratings.  Followed the recipe exactly, and can honestly only give it 2 stars.  My 11 yr. old son thought it was good, but me, hubby and teenage daughter weren't thrilled with it.  Not keeping this one, sorry.

This is really good... I would give my doctored version five stars. I diced an onion and sautéed for a few mins in some olive oil, then added some chili powder and a bit of black pepper. Then I threw in the diced chicken and cooked until done. From there, I essentially followed the recipe, but I used a 12 oz can of corn and probably more like a full cup of salsa. I also made some spanish style rice and put that in the bottom of the casserole dish.  Yum!

To make it vegetarian, we made a few changes.  Instead of chicken we added:

- 1 can of vegetarian refried beans

- 1 can Rotel diced tomatoes w/green chilies with the liquid (it says to add water anyway, might as well add some flavor!)

And then instead of normal canned corn we used the Mexican style corn (it just has peppers added).  It was delicious!!  My boyfriend and I will be making this again!

We both enjoyed this. Easy to put together. The only change I made was to almost triple the chicken. One breast in a casserole wasn't going to work for us. Before I put it in the baking dish I saw that a 7x11 dish would work well. It filled the dish about halfway. Glad I didn't use the 9x13. The only other change was to add sour cream. We like that with a lot of our Mexican dishes.

Like others noted, this recipe needs about 3x as much salsa as recipe notes.  Also, to make this tasty dish even quicker, you can use Tyson's already cooked cubed chicken breasts, and just let the chicken marinate in spices/salsa for about an hour before warming through.  I served this with sour cream, cubed fresh tomatoes, and yellow rice.  YUM!

This was terrific!  Even my pickiest eater wants it again -- and for her lunchbox!  I did take some others' suggestions and sauteed the cubed chicken in olive oil with a clove of garlic and half a sliced onion and only drained half of the liquid from the corn, none from the beans.  Also, used 1/2 cup of salsa.  This is a keeper and will be making this plenty in the future.  Thanks!

My 5 year old said, "Mom, this is stinkin' awesome!" which is actually a compliment - ha! The first night he really complained about eating it but he had to if he wanted any dessert and then he realized he loved it!  I used a can of black beans and a can of kidney beans, an entire jar of mild salsa, frozen corn, chopped up some tomato I had on hand, used sharp cheddar (what I had), and we served this with sour cream. Also used dark meat from 3 or 4 boneless skinless chicken thighs I had cooked up (cheaper) and that worked great. Will definitely make again!

HELPFUL TIPS:   taking the lead from others, definitely omit water.  Use the juice from both beans and corn (hey, makes it easier to not have to drain too)! I make the mixture ahead of time and when ready to bake, then add the crushed chips.  I actually added a layer of chips in the middle.  OTHER TIMES, I omit the chips and just add 1 - 1.5 CUP of any cooked rice (i used a seasoned flavored uncle ben's box) ...we felt this really tasted better scooped in a flour tortilla and topped with your favorite toppings (lettuce, tomotoes, sour cream and salsa).  Either way we make it, definitely add 3/4C salsa.  No, ours wasn't hot at all and we had a 1, 3, 5, and 7 yr old who approved.  It just adds a little hint of tomatoes and texture that made it perfect.

I had to improvise just a tad but kept the recipe the same, I doubled the recipe but not the chicken, I didn't have canned corn so I used a bag of frozen, didn't have have pkgd taco mix but used mexican seasoning, and then I didn't have salsa so I used canned tomatoes and onions and chopped some jalapeno's. I used corn tortillas on top with cheese at the end. I threw in some minute brown rice to make it more filling for my crowd. This made alot of food and there was not much left. This is a keeper for sure!

I followed the instructions up until adding the tortilla chips. I decided instead to use the mix as a filler for soft flour tortillas and added a dab of sour cream. I also substituted taco sauce for the salsa, since that was what I had on hand. The flavors were very good.

The flavors of this are great. I did add the taco seasoning to the chicken first as others recommended. I added torn pieces of corn tortilla to the bottom of the pan and then again on top of the chicken mixture before I topped it with cheese and chips. This made a wonderful crunchy crust. I also choose a smaller pan as others mentioned. I will make this again especially since it is so easy and so good.

We LOVE this recipe!!  For a little kick, I used medium salsa and upped the measurement to about a cup, and added about 2 cups of torn fresh spinach about 4 minutes before finished for a little extra nutrition.  When done, I added about one cup of shredded cheese before topping with crushed corn ships and additional cheese.  This is great to make the night before for the hubby to reheat, add the chips and cheese, and bake for when I'm going to work late.

It was good. I made Spanish Rice and put that on the bottom before putting the chicken, corn, bean mixture on top. This helped extend the recipe a little. Otherwise, I would say it would only feed four.

I made this tonight with a few minor tweaks. I cooked the chicken with onions and garlic. Then I used the the taco seasoning as the package says to and when there was alittle left to be absorbed, I added the cor, beans, and salsa. It turned out amazing and my boyfriend really loved it. Will cook again!

Made it as listed with exception of adding a tsp of cayenne to the mix and some diced cilantro with the last layer of cheese. The only thing I DID change was to make it in an 8x8 pan. I can't imagine how thin it would be had I used the 9x13 pan recommended. I'll definitely fix again as it was a hit, easy to make and has stuff I always have on hand

LOVE this meal. My husband is always asking me to make this meal again. I followed the other reviewers advice about cooking the chicken with onions and garlic. I make my own salsa which I generously pour into the mixture, and I also added a package of Uncle Ben's Sante Fe rice before putting it in the oven. I have made this for my family as well and it always gets rave reviews.  This is a staple in our house now! Thanks!

Pretty good as directed. I have made similar recipe many times with the addition of 1/4 chopped green onion and 1 can of cream of chicken soup right before baking and is also much improved using doritos over plain corn chips.

This dish is pretty good and very versatile. I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic in olive oil then added the chicken. Also added a few spices while cooking the chicken.  I used more salsa and some sour cream.  Although it is pretty good alone, I think it would also be good as a burrito filling or as a cold corn chip dip.

This recipe was so easy and delicious!!  I boiled the chicken instead of cooking it in oil.  I also added about 1/2 cup more water than it called for.

This was fantastic! so easy to make! I put twice as much salsa as directed, kept the chicken nice and moist.  Also, i used baked tostitos (for less fat) and low fat cheese.
Great recipe, I will definently make this again and again!

heres my updated version of this recipe. To the beans and corn I added 4 oz of cream cheese. I used a can of fire roasted tomatoes instead of the salsa. I also used shredded rotisserie chicken. That way I had no need for the oil. I also added some chopped cilantro and cumin to the taco seasoning. My family loves cheese so I added a cup of mexican cheese to the chicken mixture before baking. Cool ranch or nacho tortilla chips add a good kick crumbled over the mixture before topping with cheese and baking. I made mexican rice and corn bread as someone else suggested. We layered the chicken mixture over the rice. For condiments I made guacamole, and set out sour cream and salsa.

This dish tasted great and I will definitely make it again!  Instead of the water I just added extra salsa and no complaints here - the ingredients worked well together and was like a healthier version of a taco.  It was a good change in our household from the taco dinners I normally make occasionally using ground beef!  It was also very quick and easy to prepare and so little clean up after the meal!   We served this with sour cream and next time I am going to add some green/red peppers during the cooking to add a few more veggies and maybe top with some shredded lettuce!

This was a great weeknight dinner.  We all liked it.  I did substitute grilled rotisserie chicken for the chicken breast meat, since I had some on hand.  I mixed it up in the casserole dish and baked it covered for 15 minutes, then uncovered it and baked it for 15 more minutes, worked great and I only had to wash one dish!

This is a phenomenal recipe. Like others, I modified it to make it gluten free and to suit our tastes. I used Cumin and Corriander along with a Spicy Chicken spice instead of the Taco Seasoning. 

Like Dele, I sauteed a large sweet Maya onion and three large cloves of garlic (chopped) in my garlic infused olive oil. Then I added half a poblano chile, cut in strips to the onion and garlic mix, cooking until they were soft. I removed the onion and chile mix and sauteed the chicken cubes in more olive oil, adding the spices to the chicken  (I also added half a chipotle chile (canned in adobo sauce) to the chicken. 

When the chicken was browned, I added a large can of black beans, frozen corn and frozen peas, and 1/3 bottle of medium Herdez Salsa Casera. 

I simmered these for 10 minutes while I browned 4 corn tortillas on a griddle. Then I layered the chicken mixture and tortillas, topping with tortillas and Fud brand queso cotija. 

I haven't baked it in the oven yet, but the taste is fabulous!

Lots of easy changes made this great: saute 1 onion, 1 clove of garlic, 1/2 green pepper before adding chicken. Add green chiles and extra salsa. I took some others advice by omitting water but leaving juice of beans and corn in-too much liquid, so next time I'll drain the corn. Top with sour cream and guacamole. Served with green salad, refried beans, and corn bread.

This is a great go to recipe. I added 1 1/2 cups of cooked rice with extra salsa, which makes this a complete meal. Thanks, have made several times.
Scores high with my teenage sons.

My entire picky family (with 2 little kids) loved it!  I doubled up the recipe (which fit perfectly in a 13x7 casserole dish), used half a jar of picante sauce instead of 1/2 cup of salsa.   I also cooked my chicken in butter & garlic... Great recipe... one of our new favorites... Excited to eat the leftovers for lunch!

Made this last night, thought this was a good solid dish (and easy!) to add to the dinner rotation, or use up left overs! I made as called for in the recipe and sprinkled the chicken with the Taco Seasoning II recipe from this site instead of the taco packet called for. We topped with jarred jalapenos and sour cream and served with cilantro rice. It definitely needed the rice for a side or it would not have been enough to serve us 5. Will make again, but will trying adding fresh jalapenos directly to the casserole, as we like our foods spicier. Good overall recipe.

I was looking for a quick and easy dinner recepi, stumbled on this but I'm glad I listened to other reviewers about doctoring it up. I used a 12 oz can of chicken (was in a rush) used a whole packet of taco seasoning, added a can of rotel with habaneros, did not drain the corn and left out the water. I used soft flour tortillas and layered the tortillas, chicken mix, and cheese (like making a lasagna) Husband and I LOVE it! Eat it with sour cream and hubby has already requested I make this again.

My boyfriend ate the entire serving. Here's what I did different:
-Sauteed garlic and onion; set aside
-Pan-roasted corn off the cob (3 ears); set aside
-Cooked the chicken
-Started adding back in all the ingredients
-Used half the amount of black beans
-Used way more salsa (3/4 cup?)
-Cheddar cheese (shredded myself, as I don't use the dry in-store bags) in the mix, ontop of the mix, and ontop of the chips
-Once I have everything in the pan, I let it just sit for about 20 minutes on no heat to let the flavors merge

Thought it needed a little more spice so I added 1/3 tsp cayenne plus a sprinkle of chili powder.  Added 1/2 can diced tomatoes with peppers in addition to the salsa & added rice as others recommended.  Not bad.  Liked the tortilla chip topping browned with cheese.

I love this recipe and make it all the time now.  Things I change slightly, I put about a cup of salsa in there - and I make it homemade. Also, for a bonus, put this mixture in burritos - equally as good! :)

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because it's quick, easy and tasty -- all the things I love in a recipe :)

My grocer has a pre-spiced chicken fajita mix that I stir fried, then added all the ingredients except the taco seasoning (since I didn't want to over-spice, but in retrospect, it probably would have added more flavor) and substituted pinto beans for black beans.  I also added brown rice and upped the amount of cheese to almost a whole package since we love cheese. 

I didn't use the tortilla chips.  Turned out great.  Thanks!

Unbelievably quick and easy with tasty results! I made it exactly as written and I am embarrassed to admit that my teenage son and I ate the whole thing in one night (and that was before I read that it doesn't make good leftovers)! We loved it as is, but might try layering with tortillas next time. Thanks, Suezqz!

Tortilla topping got really hard. Avoid that step next time.

Muy bueno!  I had already thawed some ground beef, so I used what was on hand.  Of course, I diced a large white onion and fried it with the beef.  I used taco sauce rather than the packet and I used much more salsa than was called for.  Just a personal preference.  I didn't measure, I just tasted as I went along.  I used a 19 oz can of black beans and a 14 oz can of corn, mostly drained, and then just added water as I saw fit.  I used KELLYRNH's suggestion and layered whole grain tortillas in half way.  What an amazing texture and flavour.  My family LOVED this recipe. I will be making it again and tweaking it as I go!  Muchas Gracias!

This was great!  I didn't have salsa in the house, so I added a 15 oz. can of Ro-Tel Mexican tomatoes. Also, I served it with taco sauce and some sour cream.  It was delicious!  (I even used plain Greek yogurt as a sub for myself for sour cream. Very good.)

I am only giving 3 stars because this recipe 1) is not really a casserole, it's more like a dip or filling for burritos and 2) because it needed more ingredients to give it flavor.  After adding a small can of chopped green chilis, about 1/4 cup  sauteed onion and a heaping tablespoon of spicy chipotle sauce it became a 5!  I also used the whole packet of taco seasoning, not half. And rather than crushing tortilla chips on the top I served them on the side and used them for dipping. YUM!

This was a fast and easy casserole to toss together for a no hassle weeknight meal. It used a lot of leftovers up and that was great. I got rid of some leftover salsa, the rest of the broken tortilla chips in the bag that no one wanted to eat since they were too small but still fresh and crispy, and some cheese that had been opened and needed to be used up. Kudos for a recipe that used all that and things I normally keep on hand. It was good but didn't quite appeal to our tastes, as we both thought we would have preferred beef instead of chicken in this. My husband didn't care for the corn in it but I thought it went perfectly in this. A good base recipe that can be personalized easily to suit your own tastes. Thanks.

This recipe ended up being really fantastic with a little modification.  In order to eliminate a lot of sodium, I made my own taco seasoning by mixing paprika, cumin, coriander, curry, chili pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and a little cayenne.  The salsa has plenty of salt, so I didn't want to add extra, especially since I put in an entire jar rather than a half cup.  I also mixed in a cup of prepared brown rice and omitted the tortilla chips because I didn't have any on hand.  I served it over warmed flour tortillas as a kind of taco filling and it ended up being taco-y deliciousness!  Thank you for posting!

I wanted a good mexican casserole that was different from the same ole casseroles I've had for years, and this one delivered! I loved it, but my husband wasn't too keen on it. He's picky sometimes though! =) Flavor aside, its much better for you than most mexican casseroles I see!

I made a lot of the recommended changes. I sauteed onion and garlic with the chicken and sprinkled the chicken with Mexican seasoning. I didnt drain the beans or corn and also added a cup of minute rice. I thought it was just OK. Probably won't be making it again.

Tasty! I first saute chicken I have cut into bite size peices adding salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder for flavor. Soon after I see the exterior of chicken is not pink, I add 1/2 cup chopped onion, taco seasoning, 4 oz. can of diced green chiles, corn, salsa and beans. I cover the top and let those flavors blend and the beans cook for 5-7 minutes. Then I transfer to an 9x9 glass dish and cook at 350 for 8-10 minutes to let the cheese on top melt. I always use medium salsa but will do hot for my husband and even add some jalapenos to up the heat.

An average casserole... the first night (when the casserole was fresh), it tasted pretty good.  But, the leftovers were only fair (soggy chips and kinda falling apart).  I doubt the portion I stuck in the freezer will be that good.  Leftovers are really important to me, and I want them to taste good.  I need them to help carry me through the work week!  Probably won't make this again.

AWESOME. I'm a novice cook and this was my first casserole. I eyeballed everything. I used colby-jack cheese and actually messed up on the black beans. i was on the phone and accidentally opened black bean soup! i drained it a bit and used it and it came out fine regardless. probably added more flavor! i sauteed the chicken with 1/2 a yellow onion and 4 cloves of garlic. also took above advice and added ready rice. this was crazy easy and came out great. and really, no measuring cups! check my drying rack, i swear it!

We used this as a base recipe...  =] Changed the salsa to a can of tomato w/chilis. Added 1 cup of uncooked rice, one whole onion, and one whole green pepper. Instead of black beans we smeared refried beans on the bottom of the pan and layered it up from there with whole grain tortilla shells and topped with tortilla shells and a topping of cheese...  We call it "Mexican Lasagna" and it's one of our favorites!!!

This was very good.  I followed the directions listed here, but,  I added a few ingredients that helped make this dish even better.  As the chicken was cooking I added a diced onion, a couple cloves of minced garlic then once the chicken was cook,  I added a can of chopped green chiles, and more salsa than a 1/4 of cup. Along witht he other ingredients.    Will be making this again very soon!!!

Nice easy meal... Especially since I used shredded chicken that I previousely made in the crockpot (freezes well).  I started with a little olive oil and sauteed some chopped onion and minced garlic before adding the shredded chicken.  I also used frozen corn (fiesta style with peppers and onions: great coloring) instead of canned.  I used more salsa and less cheese.  Great meal that can be changed to suit your taste.

Wow is this recipe adaptable.  I also added onions/garlic when I cooked the chicken.  I used black bean soup which really added a lot of flavor as well as 1 cup cooked rice.  My family is very picky but they loved this.  Would even be good without the cornchips and placed in a wrap.   Yum!!

Great idea, I also made some changes...I used 4 boneless chicken breast cooked in olive oil and cubed (small) and taco sauce to avoid drying out. Added undrained (1 can)pinquito beans and (1 can )undrained chili beans a jar of salsa, a full packet of taco seasoning, a tablespoon of my favorite hot sauce.In a 13 x 9 placed a layer of meat mixture then tore up corn tortillas and made a good layer on that, then a couple handfuls of cheese, then a layer of meat mixture and tortillas and cheese to top it off. Fabulous idea.... Cooked as directed and served with sour cream and tortilla chips. Yumma yumma! Thank you

This was pretty good... one kid thought the corn didn't belong, two complained about the black beans, and the husband complained that a good mexican casserole needs ground beef and refried beans.  So there you go.  I thought it was a good quick fix and served it with Mexican rice.

Delicious- and SO FAST!  I followed suggestions of adding lots of onions and garlic while sauteying the chicken.  I added a can of green chilies and did not drain the corn.  I also added extra cheese.  It came out great!

OMG!! I loved it! Cooking can't get any faster and easier than this meal. I made the whole thing in a casserole dish that I also put in the oven..even clean up easy :) 
I started by sauteeing chopped shallot and then added the chicken (that I had marinated in olive oil, taco seasoning and liquid smoke for 3 h or so). I should had drained the black beans but it was still great, just scooped out some of the extra moisture.
I used 1/4 C homemade salsa (D's recipe from this site) and 1/4 green chile sauce (El Pinto, mild), crushed some Mission tortilla chips and used a Mexican cheese blend.
I topped the meal with lowfat plain yogurt and even my 2-year-old loved it!

I gave it 4 stars because of the additions I made.  With the additions it's a 5 star.
I saute'd onion and garlic with the chicken and I added red, green and yellow peppers.  I served it for guests and all had 2nd's.  I doubled all for a 9X13 pan.  Will definately make again.  Served with cornbread.  Yum!

This was a quick easy delicious dish. I used "taco seasoning I" in place of packaged seasoning and also substituted regular tortilla chips with Doritos primarily because it was what I had on hand, but am glad I did. Will make again.

It's great when you find a recipe that the whole family likes. This one satisfied everyone. It was so simple and quick to assemble. I didn't have black beans so i used red beans and it worked out just fine. Thanks for the recipe

This was excellent, served for company with a caesar salad. Changes: add whole packet of taco seasoning and 3/4 cup of salsa.. Great! Fast and easy and delicious!

FANTASTIC...I used chili beans instead (and kept about 1/2 of the juice from beans). I also seasoned the chicken with a little salt,pepper,and cumin then added onions and green chilesbefore rest of ingredients. I bumped up the salsa to 3/4 of a cup and it wasn't dry or soupy...TRUST ME. My husband loved it (he's super picky).I topped it with a little sour cream.
   I used the left overs to make a layer enchilada dish. Just soak flour (or corn) tortillas in enchilada sauce layer  1/2 chicken mixture, 1/2C sour cream and 1/4C cheese. Reapeat. Bake at 350 until cheese is bubbly.BOTH ARE GREAT!!

It came out great and was really easy to make. It took longer than 30 minutes but overall was still a quick recipe. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added a little extra water, plus an entire cup of salsa instead of the 1/4 recommended. I also seasoned the chicken prior to cooking and added cayenne pepper for extra flavor. I served the dish with sour cream on the side.

Excellent! I also made changes as noted. I double the amount of chicken (I boiled, deboned and shredded chicken leg quarters - I also added chopped onion and garlic in with the chicken after shredding). I used the whole bag of taco seasoning, drained the beans, drained half the corn, and used 2 cups cheese instead of one. I also did not add the chips as we used it for filling for tortillas. It was yummy! It comes out as a thick casserole (watch that the salsa you use isn't too watery). The way I served it to a group was in the casserole dish with flour tortillas on the side. Spread sour cream inside the tortilla and then add the mexican chicken casserole, fold and eat. My company, husband and 3-year-old son LOVED it. My 3-year-old ate TWO huge tortillas full. Thought he was going to bust! Thanks for the recipe!

Reminds me of my ex wifes mexican surprise...not going into the surprise part, but anyway I added a can of cream of chicken for moisture, drained the other items added some hot sauce along with red pepper...came out great. Also added some left over mushrooms...surprise used to use a can of cream of mushroom too....but because I had the spare shroons, I didn't add it. Just as well, the consistency came out on the dot.

I really liked this one. So easy to make. I used Shilling Chicken Fajita spice instead of taco seasoning. I browned the chicken breasts whole, sprinkled with the Fajita seasoning. Then shredded the chicken mixed the beans and corn in and generously sprinkled on more fajita spice before adding the salsa. So easy and quick.

This recipe was so simple to prepare, I was actually suprised at how well it tasted.  I used more than the called amount of chicken; almost two pounds(3 boneless breast halves).  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

A very good, very easy recipe!  I made it as directed, but I used more cheese....something I tend to do with alot of recipes.  I think next time I will add onions and maybe some black olives.  It's great left over, too!

I doubled this recipe and recommend more salsa than recipe calls for as it was a bit dry.  One of the best casseroles I've ever made and I make a lot of them.  My kids loved it.  Would be just about as good without the meat for vegetarians.  I served it with flour tortilla skins.

good, very easy to make....but nothing to write home about. i appreciate recipes that call for simple ingredients as well as simple cooking directions, which this recipe certainly has. you end up with a very tasty chicken dish. probably good to have this on hand for last-minute meals, but i woudl not want to "show off" my cooking skills with this one.

A very pleasing dish for my family. The 6 year old and 3 year old each asked for seconds. I offered a dollop of sour cream on the side. I made the night before - sprinkled the chips on just before baking. A working mother's dream and a definite keeper in this house.

I was hesitant about trying this recipe after reading the mixed reviews, but this was so good and really easy!  I sprinkled salt, pepper, and cumin over the chicken breasts before sauteeing for extra flavor.  I also added Tabasco to the chicken/black bean mixture while simmering for a little kick.  Also added a little extra cheese.  We loved it!

This flopped with my family!  Kids & husband just picked out the chicken and pushed the rest to the side with their fork.  I did not like it either.  This didn't have anything to make it "stick" together like the way most casseroles do.  I even added double the cheese from what the recipe called for to try to give it a more solid consistency.  I like all of these ingredients, but it just didn't work for me.  Big disappointment.

I used purchased, pre-cooked chicken which saved alot of time.  This is
easy to put together, and as tasty as the salsa you chose.  My only complaint
is that the casserole was watery- even though I drained the beans and corn
well.  Next time I may mix some tortilla pieces into the main part in the hopes
it will soak up some of the liquid.  All in all great taste in a quick recipie.

I took out the cheese & chips ( I know I took out the best part). I added more salsa, more chicken, and quinoa! I just cooked up 1/2 cup of it and added it with all the other ingredients. Very tasty!!! Also, I made my own taco seasoning because I didn't want to go to the store and I have control of the amount of salt. Made for great left overs and I felt good about what was in it! Also!! If you have any non fat Greek yogurt it makes as an amazing substitute for sour cream. If you don't believe me just try and you will see that you literally can't tell the difference! :) hope this helps :)

I agree that the cubed chicken didn't work in this. I think the chicken would be better shredded. I added more salsa as suggested and a cup of instant brown rice.  I think a can of rotel tomatoes would be a good addition.   I'd like to try this as a dip by leaving out the chicken and using tortilla chips as dippers.

As with everyone else, I added a few different touches.  I had some cubed chicken and some shredded--I think using all shredded would have been better.  I put some saute'd onions and garlic in with the chicken mixture, and used 2 medium sized cans of Mexi-corn instead of regular corn.  Used about 3/4 of a cup of salsa, and also threw in a small can of diced chilis.  As I love a creamy-goopy casserole, I put in a can of Nacho Cheese soup, plus maybe a third of a cup of water to thin it out just a bit.  Followed the directions for the topping, and it turned out great--just the right consistency and very yummy!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I didn't have any chicken on hand so I made it with hamburger meat.  I used a whole jar of salsa(about 1 1/2cups) and added a jalapeno.  It was so yummy, but tasted even better when I added a dollop of sour cream to the top.  Worth making as long as you put your own personal spin on it!

Very good.  I added onion while cooking chicken and a can of chopped green chilies when adding the other stuff.  I doubled the recipe. Enjoyed by all - thanks.

Super easy and tasty! I added more salsa, a whole jar and didn't drain my beans or corn (this makes it easier to eliminate the water later!) Jalepenos or green chiles are great to add it for extra spice as well. Served with a little sour cream and extra chips for dipping!

Fabulous recipe.  I dislike beans and ate everyone from my plate.   

Only changes I made was I added a jar of salsa, didn't drain the corn and didn't need to add any water.   I also added extra cheese.  It was a great dinner.   Hubby and I had seconds despite forgetting to buy sour cream.  

This is a keeper.

I had some canned chicken breasts (I know...not the greatest, but all I had and it was during a snow storm!)  I was looking for a recipe using that and what I had on hand.  Found this recipe and made it in a skillet.  Did brown onion and garlic in some Pam and then added the chicken, corn, black beans, diced tomotatoes, grilled red pepper, and taco seasoning.  OMG... it was delicious!!!  I just put some in a bowl, topped it with a little shredded low fat cheese and then crumbled a few baked Tostito corn chips on top.  It was awesome... definitely will make again.  Great dish on a cold, snowy day!!!

My boyfriend and I enjoyed the idea of this recipe, but once prepared, it didn't wow us as we had hoped. I followed the recipe as stated, but when I served it, we were hoping for more flavor. The black beans and corn were great, but I think if I were to try this again, I would add more salsa, and maybe the entire package of taco seasoning. We also added some red pepper flakes on top. Not bad, but would tinker with it a bit.

Great recipe! Followed some of the suggested modifications (e.g. sauted onions, garlic, and sliced bell pepper).  I also substituted the chicken w/ ground beef.  Added green chilles used a mild salsa simply because I have a two year old.  I Would recommend using a homemade salsa, or a good store bought brand if you have one you prefer.  Finally, I layered the bottom of the casserole with corn tortillas. This recipe was a hit with the whole family. My child gobbled it up as well.  Thanks for sharing!

This was an absolute HIT at my house!!  My son wrapped it in a tortilla like a burrito(the crushed chips wouldn't be neccessary if that had been the plan), my other son liked it as a 'dip' for his tortilla chips...my husband suggested we add olives and keep it on our menu rotation.  I would call it a success!!

We made it as is, except we also cooked up some onion with the chicken. Was super easy, and yummy! Next time I may add some mexican rice in it as well. I also added some sour cream on top.

You can do so much with this basic recipe. I slice my chicken into strips, so it cooks easier. I use brown rice, for the liquid, I make a chicken broth with mexican spices in it, and some extra buliyone cubes for flavor. We love this recipe! I do cook my brown rice before, just 30 minutes instead of the 40 that is called for and I use less water so I figure the extra liquid in the pan will be asbored by the rice. Olives, black beans, kidney beans, peppers, sauteed onions, etc

This is a pretty good casserole.  It was kind of hard to tell how much water to add, I didn't want it soupy.  In the process, I don't think I added enough because the chicken was too dry.  I think I would play around with the seasonings next time, or just use leftover chicken already cooked.  I like the idea of this casserole and I think it would lend very well to many different substitutions for flavor variations.

I made this and my husband and I thought it was just ok.  It may have been better over rice.  I did add onions and more of the taco seasoning mix because I felt it needed more.  This would definitely make a good dip minus the crushed tortillas on top and serve scoops with it.

By far my families favorite weekly meal.  Easy, quick, and delicious.  Rather than salsa I add a can of Rotel and seldom have to add any water.  A little sour cream on top and my 3 little ones eat it up!  Keeper!

This is a very tasty dish! We used cilantro flavored salsa which goes very well with the beans and corn. There are many ingredients that can be changed up, like the cheese, chips, even the taco seasoning.  We are planning to have this again very soon!

Served over yellow rice instead of tortillas and omited the cheese - trying to make it heart healthy. Added fresh garlic, half a sliced onion and half a sliced bell pepper, doubled the amount of salsa. It was tasty but more bland than expected. Will try again and kick up the seasoning.

The whole family loved it. I added refried beans to the bottom of the dish before baking. I used the whole packet of taco mix and added extra salsa. I used 2% cheese which I wouldnt reccommend as it didnt melt very well. Next time I make it, i will mix the crushed chips through the mixture instead of on top. I also made fresh guacamole and added sour cream and salsa after baking. Delicous !!!

Update---I cooked the chicken with onion and green pepper and garlic.  I didnt have any chips so I used a cornbread mix that I added a tad sugar and some extra taco cheese blend.  This was yumm-o.  I don't remember the chips from before, but I am think I prefer the cornbread. Also I didnt have black beans this time so I used red beans. Turned out great.  ---------- Quick and easy.  My skillet was able to go from stove to oven making it even easier.  Dry wasn't an issue, I didnt drain the corn or the beans.  I had a little extra chicken so I used a whole thing of taco seasoning.  I put all the chips on then all the cheese.  You could add all kinds of stuff but I decided to keep it simple and save those ingredients for another day.

This was very, very tasty...how could it not be with all tortilla chips & cheese??  I made the following modifications...I shredded the breasts, legs and thighs of a rotisserie chix in place of the breast; used about 1/4 c of water + 1/4 c of chix broth (probably could have added even more liquid); poured 1/4 c of medium heat taco sauce over the chicken after adding the taco seasoning (whole envelope); Used 15 oz can of corn;  I used a full cup of chipotle flavored salsa and also doubled the cheese.  I had just the right amount for my 9x13 (aluminum foil-lined) pyrex dish.  Can't wait to get home to the leftovers!

I added chopped onions and chopped garlic to chicken saute.  My dish was not dry at all .... wished the sauce was a bit thicker.  I will use more salsa next time.  I also used home-made taco seasoning mix.  Leftovers could be used in a tortilla shell for a quick lunch.

Great recipe! Very easy to make and tastes great. I add red onion and cook it with the chicken. I also use a frozen cubed chicken from GFS to save time. This is a great oops I forgot to pull something out for dinner recipe because it is quick and easy.

Simple, yet excellent meal!!  As many others have done, I modified this receipe a bit, and it was fantastic.  We used more chicken, all of the taco seasoning mix, doubled the salsa and mixed some of the cheese in with the mixture before transferring it into the dish.  Next time, I'll probably double the entire recipe so we have more leftovers!  We ate it by itself with cornbread, but if you wanted it to be more filling, you could probably serve it over rice or inside a tortilla.  Lots of flavor.  My husband and I loved it!!

this was a nice, quick easy throw-together casserole. I made it with homemade mexican rice, which made it even better.

I really liked this dish, even w/ some mistakes on my part. I missread and put tortilla chips and cheese on bottom as well as on top, so next time  I won't use the chips on bottom, and I also didn't have any salsa, which I think those two things lead to my casserole being a little dry.

I never put this in the oven, and it turned out great! I used frozen corn, didn't use any extra water, ommitted the tortilla chips, and used the Taco Seasoning II recipe from this site. It was amazing. We ate this all by itself, although it would be excellent served with rice.

I loved the base idea of this recipe, but I took other reviewers' advice and used my own ideas to make it more filling and flavorful.  I cooked the chicken with diced onion and minced garlic, used spicy chili beans instead of black beans (and didn't drain or rinse them), added a small can of chopped olives, and used more chunky salsa than directed.  The real kicker, I think, is that I cooked a cup of white rice as normal, then mixed a can of condensed cheese soup and the other half of the taco seasoning packet into it.  I put the rice layer on the bottom of the casserole dish, then the chicken/bean/etc, then a layer of crushed Fritos corn chips and medium cheddar.  The rice should help those of you who thought the casserole was too thin or more like a dip than a meal.  It was good and I'll make it again, but I think I'll make my own seasoning next time.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this on a whim because I had pretty much everything...not bad! Very tasty! Like the other reviewers, I added a few things: chili powder, sauteed onions, garlic, and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. I also did not drain the can of black beans...the juice actually blends all the flavors.   Yummo!!!!!!!!

This was pretty good, has room for improvement.  If I make it again, I'll definitely add more corn, add some onion, and skip baking it.  Baking it seemed like an extra step and an extra dish to wash.  I think it would just as good with the cheese sprinkled on top after it has been dished up and the chips served on the side.  I think this would also be really good as part of a taco salad with Doritos instead of tortilla chips.

This was good!  I almost felt like it was more of a side dish but it filled us up well.  I used canned chicken and then make it in an oven safe skillet so a 1 dish meals!!  Awesome :)

My husband LOVED this!  He said he could eat the whole pan that night.  I too sauted half an onion and about a tsp of minced garlic with the chicken.  I also used the whole packet of taco seasoning and half a cup of salsa and a whole pound of chicken.  Basically I followed the recipe but increased everything except left corn and black beans I left the same.  We like things spicy so I used hot taco seasoning and hot salsa.  Husband asked me to add this one to the our favorites recipe book....And it was sooo easy!

This was pretty good and easy. I did make a couple of changes. I sauteed onion and garlic first and then instead of cooking chicken, I bought a whole roasted chicken at the grocery store and shredded it up. This was really tasty!

This is an excellent starter recipe, it's very versatile which I love. I cooked my chicken, added garlic salt and chopped onions. Then added the taco seasoning, creamed corn, red kidney beans, mild salsa, 1 cup of rice, and 1/2 cup of sour cream. It's delicious! I plan to rip up a tortilla as suggested by another reviewer as I don't have taco chips, and then add some shredded cheese. It's huge! It is a tad spicy, so next time I will only add a tbsp of taco seasoning. I would definatly not put in a whole package unless you like it really spicy. Thanks!

Yum! Even my very picky son (verrrrry picky) liked this ok. I followed the suggestion of sauteing onion and garlic with the chicken  and layering it with tortilla chips and cheese twice. Very tastey and high in protein to boot!

Not only is this delicious, but it is quick to make.  The only thing I do different is make my own taco seasoning from this site(Taco Seasoning I), add more salsa, and use creamed style corn.  We have this once a week. Fantastic!

I thought this was a great idea and the directions were perfect.  I added a few other things-2 serrano peppers, 1 T of cumin, 1/8 t salt and pepper, a few cloves of fresh garlic, cilantro all instead of the taco seasoning.  I also added some mozzarella cheese.  It turned out great!  My husband rated it a 9 1/2.

This was delicious!  Everyone in my family loved it!  The only changes I made were using the whole taco seasoning packet, not draining the corn or beans, and adding 2 cups cooked rice to the pan before baking in the oven.  I really like black olives, so I did top it off with them.  When I served it, we mixed sour cream in with it.  Will definitely make this again!

Wow! Excellent dish. Easy to make and as one reviewer said, very forgiving. We loved it and I think I may use the filling for buritos sometime. I didn't have salsa, so I took a chance and chopped tomato, onion, added hot sauce and approx 3 tbsp tomato paste with water.  Mixed together.  It worked. My husband loved it and he is usually fussy - especially with new recipes.  Served with a dollop of sour cream.  Next time will try to have black olives and cilantro to zing it up.  Thanks!!!!!!!!

Excellent taste and easy to prepare!
I've been making this for several years now. It's a delicious one dish meal. I usually just serve it with a salad. Instead of adding water to prevent it from becoming too dry, use some beef bouillon. It adds a lot more flavor than plain water.

I modified this a little bit.  I put tortilla chips on the bottom of the dish.  I shredded the cooked chicken and mixed it with cooked onions and a packet of taco seasoning. I then added a can of chopped tomatoes with onion and garlic and simmered for a little while.  I topped the chips with the chicken and tomato mixture.  Then I put black beans, corn, black olives, and fresh cilantro on top of that.  I put on a little cheese and then put crushed taco chips over the whole thing. Finally I topped it off with shredded cheese and lightly sprinkled taco seasoning over it.  I served with sour cream and taco sauce.  It was to die for and the chips stayed crunchy.

Ab-fab!  I sauteed a small onion and some garlic first before adding the chicken, added a whole packet of taco seasoning, a small can of green chiles, small can of black olives and a small can of corn.  I used pinto beans (not rinsed, just drained a little) and a lot more cheese than the recipe called for- a mix of cheddar and mexican cheese. I eyeballed the amounts and it was a very forgiving recipe.  5 stars from DH- who RARELY says 5 for anything- especially Mexican!  YUM!  Thanks!!

Using many suggestions this meal turns out great.  I use frozen fajita chicken, the whole can of beans and corn, salsa, garlic and onion powder, then I put in a cup of minute rice cooked.  I transfer all into baking dish and crush baked tortillas and use 2% mexican cheese on top.  Delicious- couldn't have done it without the other reviews.

5+ stars.  My kind of recipe- easy tasty and not a lot of dishes.  I did the whole thing in one stove-top to oven pot and it worked out fine.  I did use the entire jar of salsa (i put the rest over the top before the chips), 2 cups of cheese and almost the complete pack of taco seasoning.  WE LOVED IT!

LOVE IT!!  I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 pan.  I added Uncle Ben's 90 second roasted chicken rice to the bottom of the casserole.  I did season the raw chicken with garlic powder, pepper, and Lawry's Seasoning Salt.  WE LOVED THIS Casserole!! It is a keeper!

GREAT RECIPE! I am not a huge chef.  I just started making my own food I used to just eat out.  This was super easy to make and it didn't cost much or take too long.  

I didn't make this with salsa because we don't really like it.  Next time I might top off with sour cream and guacamole!

Thanks

I also got creative with it.  I added instant rice, more cheese, salsa, black olives, and since we don't like beans I left those out.  I like the idea of adding green chilies.  I think I'll do that next time.  The only thing that takes the longest is cooking the chicken.  The rest of this recipe is so quick and easy that I've made it several times.  My teenager doesn't like mexican food really and he'll eat this every time I make it.  This is an excellent starter recipe and is almost as good as leftovers. Only problem is when reheating it, it does tend to dry out so I would add water and salsa.

It's not often my kids ask for seconds (they're always in too much of a hurry to go play!) But everyone asked for another helping!  I did find that the measurements didn't make enough for a 9x13 dish, so I doubled everything but the topping.  This will become a regular in our family - thanks!

I made this for company and was disappointed.  While the flavor was good (though I did have to add some jalapenos and onions) - the texture was all wrong.  It didn't have a "casserole" consistency.  My friends said they liked the taste, but agreed the consistency was the problem.  I made a chicken taco salad with the leftovers.  It was actually very good that way!

Easy to make.  Great taste.  Served it over rice.  I can't think of anything that would make it better.  I did end up using frozen corn because that's all I had, but it was still good.

My son is a picky eater and also has to have a diet that consists of plenty of fiber, this recipe was perfect! The black beans had plenty of fiber for him and he was most excited because he got to eat "chips" for dinner. My roomate and I also enjoyed this dish very much. It was quite tasty. i topped my serving with a bit of sourcream and it was delicious!

Delicious.  The whole family enjoyed it.  The kids (picky eaters) were fighting over the last bit left.  I made a few changes:  used whole package of taco seasoning, added green chilies, added 1 can of stewed tomatoes Mexican style (I diced them)and added the crushed tortillias after it finished baking. For a family of 4 it almost wasn't enough.  I would definitely fix again.

I made this according to the recipe and my family really didn't like it. I used water as suggested, but there just weren't enough moist ingredients to hold everything together. The crushed chips on top became chewy.  It just didn't appeal to me.  Sorry.

I've made this recipe many, many times over and it's turned out great every time. However, tonight I got every MORE creative. I didn't have black beans so I used Mexican Chili Beans. I used ground beef instead of chicken (although we love it both ways)and I brown the beef with onion for a little added flavor. I used about a cup of salsa instead of using water. And served with a dolop of sour cream. It turned out AWESOME. My husband said he likes it better with the chili beans over the black bean.

This was great! And very easy! I used 2 pounds of chicken, and doubled everything else except the beans. I used  mexicorn instead of regular, and the mexican seasoned black beans. I also sauted the chicken with onion and garlic. I will make this again for sure! Great the next day reheated then sprinked with crumbled tortilla chips!

Excellent recipe.  I usually don't take the time to rate these recipes but this one I could not resist.  Cooking the chicken tenderloins in oil, onion and garlic was the bomb plus I double the salsa and omitted the water and used the mexican corn as suggested.  THis is awesome on soft tortillas with sour cream!!!

This is so easy, and very yummy! My husband thought it was great, and even better when I reheated the leftovers (there weren't many) in the oven a day or so later. I did saute the chicken with onion and added extra garlic powder and some cut up chili peppers for added spice. It was excellent - and QUICK!

Thought this was pretty good - has a kind of chili feel to it, only thicker.  I too increased the amount of salsa, actually used an entire packet of taco seasoning and added a can of green chile's.

Definitely added to this recipe, but it was still very easy!  Added onions and garlic, and used pre-cooked chicken to save time.  Instead of salsa, added diced mexican styled tomatoes and a can of diced green chilis.   It was a bit too liquid-y and I drained all the ingredients, except for one can of corn.  Great with side of spanish rice.  Very tasty but it's pretty much glamorized bean dip.

this recipe is delicious. my husband really doesn't like black beans so I changed the recipe to half spicey kidney beans and half black beans. It made a wonderful change . I also used pepper jack cheese for that extra little kick.

We couldn't eat the leftovers.  Substituted black beans for refried beans, which probably made it worse.  It was like Mexican stew with chips.

It was good, but it seemed like it could have used something else.  Maybe adding some rice next time would make it better.  We have some leftover, and I think it may make a good burrito filling.

This recipe is great!  I did a little modifying to use up leftovers.  I had a chicken salad concoction (ground chicken, broccolli, and cauliflower) that I used instead of the chicken breasts.  It worked just great!  Probably had a different consistency, but the kids ate it.  That's a plus with my kids these days!  I liked it too!

I just made this for dinner and the flavor was fabulous!  Not too spicey for our 2 year old, yet spicey enough.  I don't know if I would classify it as a casserole, as it was more like a delicious dip, even after setting out of the oven for 15 minutes after baking.  Next time, maybe I'll just serve it with additional chips for dipping.

This recipe was very simple to make! I used canned chicken which makes it very easy to keep all the ingredients on hand. My husband is a very picky eater but he requests this dish often. We will certainly make this often!

This was so easy to throw together for a quick hot dinner.  My 8 year old even had seconds, and my 2 year old actually ate everything on her plate.

My family loved this recipe. I did make a couple changes though. I used a family size can of corn and did not drain the corn or the beans, and then left out the water. Add about a cup of minute rice just before moving it to the casserole dish. I also crushed Fritos instead of regular tortilla chips. I’m sure we’ll be having this again. :)

I made this exactly as described except I used frozen corn which I cooked on the stovetop before putting it all in the oven. The flavor was good and it made a good reheat. I bet it would be better with more salsa though or add tomatoes, maybe diced with some garlic salt and a bit more taco seasoning. It was a little unbalanced

I'm sure this recipe would be completely awesome if I hadn't opted to use the least amount of salt possible. (I used no added salt canned beans and corn) It was already close to heavenly without the salt. I also could rectify that in a few ways. I decided to try some of my awesome nacho cheese sauce on top, but I wish I had put it all throughout and put in a tad bit more salsa then it would be the best Mexican recipe I've ever had even with the no salt added veggies.

I was very pleased with how this turned out. It was also super easy. I was surprised to see that there were no onions in the recipe so I added some. I also added squeezed some fresh lime juice on the chicken while it was cooking. I think the next time I make this, I'll marinate the chicken overnight in olive oil, lime, garlic and cilantro. Recipe would be nice over rice.

We cooked it without the tortilla chips in it. Instead, we use tortilla chips as scoops to eat it. The recipe is very quick and easy. You can spice it up a bit by using "hot" taco seasoning. We doubled the recipe and cooked it in a large, rectangular casserole dish.

I followed the recipe as written and it was great! This is the perfect dish to make with left over chicken in a pinch. Especially since I usually have all the other ingredients in my pantry.

Yummmmmmy!! We had a brown out recently and I was scrambling how I was going to feed my family and I found this recipe! I already had a roasted chicken from the night before when there was still power, so I picked the meat, chopped it up, and mixed in  all the ingredients without sauté ing it. I placed it on top if the stove in the barn, which had been keeping us warm for the past 20 hrs!! I stirred it a couple of times after it got hot. In 15 min it was done! My husband felt bad thinking, with no light and water, i was able to prepare a scrumptious meal! It was inhaled rather quickly!!!

It was bland.  Both hubby and I though so, and only 1 out of 3 kids ate it. That was even after I added sauteed onion and garlic. It needs something else...maybe a full package of taco mix? Overall, it was ok, but it needs some more spice for flavor.

All my family (4 men & myself) really like this recipe.  It's an easy go to recipe for when you've had a busy day. Nice with a dollop of sour cream on top.  I doubled the salsa.  I've taken this to 2 friends recovering from surgery & they both asked for the recipe.

To make things easier, I always buy club size packages of chicken breast, steam in my rice cooker, cut up & freeze in meal-size ziplock bags in advance.
I save the broken chips from the bottom of the tortilla bag for recipes that call for it.

This dish is very tasty and I don't think you can go wrong with it. I did use a little more chicken than the recipe asked for for a more heavier meal, but even that wasn't overwhelming. I wasn't sure how much water to add to prevent drying out the dish and I thought I had added too much. However, after it finished baking in the oven, some of the moisture evaporated and it was just right. I really liked the crunchy tortilla-cheese topping. The other different thing I did was add a whole 15 oz can of corn instead of half like other reviewers did. The corn was not overwhelming. Just right!

Wow, we loved it.  Easy to make ahead.  Doubled the salsa.  Added small can of green chilis for more spice.  Added a layer of low-carb flour tortillas on top of mixture.  Then put cheese on top of the tortilla.  The tortilla kept the cheese in a compact layer.  Delicious.  Great low- carb, too.

I subbed 1.3 lbs of ground turkey for chicken.  I don't like taco seasoning, so I just eyeballed amounts of cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, salt, pepper.  I followed everything else the same.  Good weeknight meal.

This is a great base recipe. I used pre-cooked dark meat chicken and kidney beans as a substitute and it turned out fine. It does taste good with sour cream and chives topped on, too. I also do not drain the cans of beans and corn-- more flavor. In short, this is a recipe anyone can work with and add to his/her tastes. It is also not time consuming. Try it.

Instead of using rice and salsa, I like to make spanish rice for my casseroles.  Also, good to add avocado and salsa after baking.

My whole family LOVED IT!!!!!  I switched it up a bit as well. I added coconut milk instead of water and tomato sauce instead of salsa because I can't have the green peppers in salsa. My son put hot sauce on it as he does with everything and it was yummy!! We love garlic so I might try that next time. Will definitely make it again!

I don't understand the people who thought this was bland.  We thought it had plenty of flavor, and I used reduced sodium taco seasoning and beans.  It was super easy to make.  I'll definitely be making this again.  It's a great way to use up all those broken chips at the bottom of the bag.

I sauteed some onions, garlic and a little hot peppers and used left over chicken thigh meat. I didn't drain the beans, but did the corn and it was still kinda soupy, but definitely not objectionable. It made a bunch and since there are only 2 of us we halved it, making one pan and freezing the rest for another time. Wonderful meal and we'll definitely have it again - thanks so much for sharing!

This has all the basic ingredients of most Mexican dishes, yet it was really delicious.  I added a layer of yellow rice under the chicken mixture to make it a complete meal.  Very easy - very good.

I too think this is a good base recipe. I used more chicken and a full packet of seasoning. I also upped (at least doubled) the salsa, and didnt drain the corn. I didnt feel like turning on the oven since its summer, so I crushed the chips and topped with cheese and just put a lid on until the cheese was melted. It was quite tasty!

Here again my daughter and husband really ate this up, no left overs. easy enough to throw together and very tasty.  Next time will add a little more water as it did dry out more than I like. Definitely a keeper.

I made this for dinner tonight. I omitted the chicken to make it vegetarion and skipped the taco seasoning (because of no meat in casserole, didn't want it too salty) and it was delicious! I will definitely make this again!

We LOVED it! I added some onion, garlic, and a red and a green pepper before the chicken. We also skipped the "casserole" part, instead just serving it more like a nacho chip appetizer... tossed some chips on the plate, ladled the mixture over it, and sprinkled with the cheese. SO yummy!

As soon as I read the ingredients I knew that I was going to love this recipe! I used a pico de gallo salsa, mild taco seasoning and cooked my chicken with green chile peppers and garlic. Also, if you nix the chicken and cheese, it makes a great corn and bean salsa ;)

VERY GOOD! I marinated my chicken cubes in olive oil and taco seasoning the night before and added fresh cilantro. Also, added more salsa than adding water.

My family (3 including me) is not a huge corn fan.  So the next time I will leave it out and add another can of beans.  

Mine made WAY more than 4 servings but we are not big eaters either.  We have enough leftover for all 3 again and at least enough for 2 more servings after that.

ENJOY!

This was very good.  It had a mild taco taste, and the beans and corn tasted great!  I used picante instead of salsa, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  May try to make it a little spicier next time, but really it was quite good the way it is!

Very good.  I changed a few minor things that I thought may give it more flavor, based on reviews, and loved the results.  Diced 3 chicken breasts pretty small, used one whole packet of taco seasoning, omitted the water and instead did not drain the black beans and corn, and I doubled the salsa.  After simmering on the stove it looked like it was going to be really soupy, but it was actually perfect because the tortilla chips absorbed some of the liquid.  Without all of that liquid it would have been dry. Next time I think I'll also add more tortilla chips because that was one of our favorite parts.  I'll layer it...chicken mixture/tortilla chips/remaining chicken mixture/cheese/tortilla chips.   Topped with plain yogurt to add some creaminess = delish!  I do have to say though, 30 minutes is a bit of a stretch.  Between prep, cooking the chicken, simmering and baking, it probably took more like 45.

This is an awesome and easy way to get a Mexican food fix. Living in London but being from Southern California I'm constantly trying new ways to make yummy Mexican food at home. My husband and I loved this. I didn't tweak the recipe this first time but might experiment in future. Delicious!

This is really good and very simple to make. I followed the recipe, except I used frozen corn instead of canned corn. I think next time I make it, I'll saute onions and peppers with the chicken. Thanks for the recipe.

We loved this dish, I didn't drain and rinse the black beans and I left some of the juice from the corn and added a little more salsa.  My husband loved it but asked me if I could make it with cornbread on top.  I stirred together a Marie Callendar's corn bread mix and poured it over the top (instead of the chips) before baking.  I increased the oven temperature to 375 and baked it for 20 minutes, added the remaining grated cheese on top and put it back in until the cheese got bubbly.  I would recommend using a little more fluid (water, tomato juice) in the meat mixture when topping it with the cornbread as it tends to soak up some and some is cooked off at the higher temperature.  I serve it with sour cream and salsa.  It was really good with the sweetness of the cornbread.

This is very good and easy to adapt to your personal preferences.  I was trying to use up some leftovers before going on vacation, so I made some changes.  I some already cooked, shredded chicken, so I just aded that to a skillet with the corn, black beans, salsa and taco seasoning (used Taco Seasoning I from this site) to heat through.  I then mixed in 3 oz. reduced fat shredded cheddar cheese and transferred everything to the casserole dish, leaving off the tortilla chips (didn't have any).  I think this mixture would work well wrapped in a tortilla.

This is SO good!! I used brown beans because I didn't have black, and just put in normal cheese (I don't know what Mexican-style cheese is). I omitted the tortilla chips. I will be making this again for sure! Thanks for sharing :)

This recipe is so great!  It's super easy too! I even save a step and keep it in the original skillet, top it with the chips and cheese and let the cheese melt and you have a one pot/dish meal!  I finshy by topping with sour cream and avocado!  It's a winner in our home!

I was skeptical that our casual guests would like this dish but it was a very big hit.  Even with the five year old.  I did add an onion and because I changed the Servings to 8, when the recipe called for 4/5 or something silly like that, of Taco Seasoning I just used the entire package.  I did likewise with the beans and corn.  This will definitely be a recipe I will make again and again!

This recipe worked perfectly well for me and this is saying something because I don't exactly know how to cook, when I sat down for my meal and tasted it was sooo suprised that I could actually put something together...I live in Turkey so I couldn't find black beans I replaced them with red beans and for the same reason I used taco flavoured tortilla chip and still the recipe worked perfectly..

I thought this was a pretty good basic recipe that you can customize according to taste.  I added a can of green chilis and more chicken,  salsa and cheese.  Very easy dinner especially if you already have cooked chicken.  Wasn't too spicy for the kids.

My husband and son LOVED this recipe.  I used beff instead of chicken just because I had it.  I also added an onion and garlic when I browned the meat.  I also added a can of green chilies.  I thought that gave it a nice little flare of flavor.  I topped each serving with sour cream.  Excellent and not too bad on calories!

Very good and very easy. The kids loved it. The only thing I changed was to add more cheese. I'll keep this one on my list of quick dinners.

If this was made with ground beef or shredded chicken, I'd give it 5 stars.  I was very careful to not overcook the chicken and it still happened.  I didn't like the chunks of chicken.  I will definitely make this again but I'll use ground beef.

I make this several different ways adding ingredients like peppers and onions as I have them or conversely dropping them if I don't and I sometimes use Soyrizo or ground turkey instead of the chicken. This is a great simple go to dinner that can be made in a flash with ingredients most have on hand. :)

Really great base.  I used Rotel Mexican Tomatoes with cilantro and lime instead of salsa.  Also,  I coated the chicken with one tbsp. of the oil then seasoned with salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder, and a hint of red pepper.  I also added 1/2 onion and garlic.  Served it with sour cream and guac.  Everyone loved it.

Really good base recipe.  I didn't put the chips in it (personal preference).  It needs some rice, which others have suggested.  Very good flavor and easy to make!  My whole family loved it, even my 1 and 3 year olds.  Will definitely make again!

This is a GREAT family recipe.  It is spicy, but mild at the same time.  It is SO good.  Every time my  family makes this, we always have leftover.  It tastes just as good the next day.  I love making this; it is SO easy!

I made this for dinner and it's a keeper with a few changes. I sauteed an onion and added garlic salt before adding deboned rotisserie chicken. I used pkg of taco seasoning, jarred salsa, and didn't drain the beans when mixing in the canned foods.  I used the juice of a lime and 1/2 cup beer for the extra liquid to keep the meat mixture from drying out.  Family loved it! Will make again.

This was a huge hit with my family.  I sauteed onions and garlic with the chicken.  I didn't drain the beans, and added creamed corn since I had it on hand.  Next time I'm going to throw it all but the cheese and chips in the crock pot, and add those at the end.

I cooked the chicken with added chili powder, cumin, and celery salt. Those spices, combined with a bit of the taco seasoning was GREAT! I also cooked brown rice (1 C rice, into 1 C water & 1 C chicken broth). I left off the 2nd layer of cheese to cut back on some of the cholesterol-turned out delicious without it. My 14 month old daughter is chowing down on it right now, and loving it! She's also chugging milk, so maybe it's a tad spicy. Oh well, isn't bothering her, that's for sure!

It was good, fast and easy. Next time I will add more salsa, I don’t think ¼-cup was enough. Also, I think I might make some rice for the bottom layer to add a little more substance, plus I think it may help it stick together better, i.e. more casserole-like.

yum - tastes like chicken nachos!  I also added onion and garlic to the chicken while browning.  I didn't drain the black beans, only used half of a can of corn and used half of a cup of salsa.

I fixed this for the first time, read the reviews and took some advice.  I added garlic, & onions to the chicken.  I also added 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chili's to it and used the whole package of taco seasoning.  I also added some instant riice before putting in the oven.  My husband loved it, we will definately make this again.

This is a pretty good and easy to make casserole.  I took others' recommendations and sauted onion and garlic in the olive oil and then added the chicken.  I also left in some of the liquid from the corn and added a cup of cooked, instant rice to the chicken mixture just before putting the casserole in the oven.  There's a lot of versatility to this recipe...you could add olives, green chilies, anything you'd put in a burrito or taco.  I topped individual servings with a dollop of sour cream.

Very delicious! The crunch from the chips really make this dish! *I added white rice to the bottom of the dish along with chicken stock/water. The rice was still alittle hard after baking the recommended time. Will increase time 5-10 minutes next time.

THIS IS SOOOOO GOOD!!!   I took some suggestions mentioned and sliced an onion, broiled it until caramelized and somewhat charred.  I grilled chicken with minced 3 cloves of garlic and sprinkling of taco seasoning. I then cooled and diced it up, along with dicing up onion and set aside.  I then fried some already cooked brown rice (Schwann's!)with sprinkling more taco seasoning, olive oil, a little juice from jalepenos and water until rice started to brown. Then added 1 cup of salsa and 1/4 cup of lite sour cream along with chicken and onions. Added can of Black Beans w/Jalepeno along with Mexi-Corn. Mixed all together, put in casserole dish. Covered with 2 cup package of shredded cheddar and 1/2 cup crunched corn chips.  HEALTHY dish and easy too!!  Will make this MANY times again and will no doubt taste better the next day. THANKS Sue for a great recipe!!

Made this according to recipe, did add peppers & onions, but it is really easy and tastes great.  Husband loves it and asked for me to make it again the next week, he called it "upside down nachos."

I love this one and so does my boyfriend and he is one picky eater.  The only changes I made was because I like spice I added a whole package of taco seasoning and a little frank's hot sauce.  As for the baking I found it too dry to bake for 10 minutes and then put it in longer to melt the cheese on top.  So the second time I cut the bake time down less then half the time just so the cheese was melted! Yum

I used over a pound of chicken and was glad I did.  I followed the recipe exactly otherwise and added about 1/2 cup water.(1/4 would have been fine) We liked it but I think rice would have been a good addition.  My picky kids did not like it but at least ate the chicken.  Good flavor.

This recipe was very easy, and one that is easily builded onto.  I sauteed an onion along with the chicken, along with a couple fresh banana peppers from my garden.  I added a few dashes of Franks RedHot Sauce to the mixture, and used a full 15oz can of corn.  I had a packet of mexican rice on hand - so I prepared that, and spread it in the bottom of the casserole dish - and I also doubled the cheese called for.  It turned out very yummy, and I will definatly be making this again.

Yummy!  A great dish to take to a potluck, as it's easy and quick to make, and relatively inexpensive.  It's also easy to adjust to your preferences with different add-ins.  As most other people did, I also added quite a bit more salsa.  I'm not sure how well it would have worked the other way, but it came out very nicely this way!

My husband couldn't stop himself. I used a Ranchero sauce that he made before and it turned out really good. We both talked about it and next time we might layer the middle with chips, as well as, the top. Great idea, very easy.

Wow! This turned out good! I live in Korea so Tortilla Chips can be hard to find, so I used regular tortillas instead. I used 1 cup of salsa and sprinkled a little bit of dried cilantro in it as well. I stir fried an onion prior to adding the chicken with some garlic powder. I also made some corn bread to be served with it. Wow, this was so easy to make. I think the only thing I would have served with it as well would be some sour cream.

Made this for my boys as my daughter and I went out to dinner. Hands down they all loved this including my picky husband, he took the remaining left overs for lunch the next day. I did change the recipe as previous postings suggested to ground turkey instead of chicken, chopped a small onion and sauteed in olive oil first before cooking meat, used the taco seasoning 1 recipe for taco mix, 1 1/2 cup salsa, 2 cups cheese & crushed tortillas, dollop of sour cream on top when serving.   Definitely will make again - Thanks for the recipe.   On weight watchers now and recipe as is, one serving is 7 pts.

This was an easy recipe. I added extra cheese and chips. The nice thing is that you do not have to follow the directions exactly and you will still end up with a good meal.

Ok at first I said 4 stars. But I made it again 2 days later for a dinner with friends (and because my husband and I were craving it). The casserole was gone before I got my fill and I got so many compliments on this EXTREMELY easy and quick recipe. Don't change a thing and you will be happy with the results!

My family gobbled this up.  We all really enjoyed!! I followed others tips and kept most of the juice from the beans and corn instead of the water and increased the salsa to about a half cup. I tore up flour tortillas and made two layers.  Was not dry at all.  I will be making again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I increased chicken to 3 lbs, added 1/2 cup of heavy cream, 1/3 cup sour cream, diced jalapenos, sauteed onions, garlic powered, dash cayenne pepper, diced tomatos and used organic tortilla chips.  Really good.  Will make it again!

Delicious and kid-friendly.  The whole family loved this one and everyone went for seconds!!  The taste reminds me of southwestern eggrolls - also a family favorite (recipe on this site).

I try to be as healthful as possible while cooking, so instead of cooking the chicken in oil I boiled it, as I usually do.  It cooks the chicken quickly and keeps it moist.

I then cut the meat into chunks and proceeded as directed with the remainder of the recipe.  I did use a whole package of taco seasoning, and I may have added a bit more chips to the top...

I used shredded Monterey Jack cheese.

My daughter claims that this is her "No. 2 favorite casserole of all-time."  I guess that means it's a keeper!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I gave this 4 stars cause I loved it but the boyfriend didn't.  I didn't add black beans cause bf doesn't like them, so I put refried beans on bottom and then added the chicken mixture on top.  Added sour cream on top and extra salsa once it was done, and then dipped out with extra tortilla chips.  It was excellent.

I too found this recipe to be super easy to make! I followed some of the suggestions that some of the reviewers made and it came out delicious! I ended up using a whole jar of salsa and hint of lime tortilla chips. The lime chips really added something to this. I then served it with sour cream and refried beans. Best of all works great for people with diabetes, kept my sugar down! And my husband loved it!

Yum, yum, yum. I made this for my husband and I for a quick, throw together dinner. 

My husband who "doesn't like casseroles" had three helpings. Needless to say, we didn't have any leftovers.

This is really, really good. I used a whole onion and lots of garlic, more salsa and cheese than stated and cooked in an 8x8 glass pan. I also used homemade taco seasoning mix which is so much better thsn the packaged. Served with spanish rice and corn bread. Next time I will cook some white or brown rice in chicken broth and mix the rice into the casserole prior to baking and will add even more salsa. Very versitile recipe.

yummy! I followed the advice of others & spiced it up a bit with HOT taco seasoning, medium cilantro salsa, cumin, onion & garlic. I also used the juice off the corn & beans, & left the water out. I'm going to try it with hamburger next time!

Great and very easy. My family likes spice, so I added an 8oz can jalapenos. In the spirit of the dish, I used "southwestern" style salsa which has corn, black beans, peppers, and other delicious things.

This was delicious. The only changes I made were: I added a can of green chiles; used 3/4 cup salsa; used 3/4 cup water. This is a great recipe, but I much preferred to eat it like a dip with tortilla chips and sour cream rather than as a casserole with a fork. I will definitely make this again & again!

Highly recommended. I followed others advice and added sauted onion and garlic. I also added a couple drops of very spicy hot sauce, and about 1 tablespoon of "liquid smoke" mesquite flavoring.

Next time I will shred the chicken as opposed to cubing it. I think this will give the dish a better texture overall.

I found this to be a little dry.  I might try adding more salsa as well as sour cream if I make again.  It was super easy to make and carries Ok to a party (chips get a little soggy).

My family loved this.  I used regular corn rather than the cream corn and added about 1T of water. I miraculously managed to have a crunchy, cheesy top with a moist bottom. I used a lasagna spatula to serve it in nice little squares & topped with fresh tomatoes, avacado & lite sour cream.  

My son said it was fantastic, but to add more chicken next time. I have a feeling this recipe is great to play around with, but the more you add, the less success you will have with the cruncy to mosit ratio. But it will still taste great!

I have three kids, one 2 year old boy who will eat anything and two picky tweens who eat nothing and this recipe was voted a hit by all!  I loved it because it was so easy. We will make this one again.

I can't say anything more about this dish but "WOW!"

Changes I made: 1 lb. chicken, 2 taco seasoning packets , 1 entire jar of salsa, no water (just didn't drain the corn or beans), 2 cups shredded cheese (we like cheese). I used a 9x13 dish and it all fit just fine.

Do yourself a favor and make this tonight!

I really liked this recipe though I did make a few changes. I cooked chicken w/ onion and garlic and added some ricotta cheese to my mixture along with a cup of cooked rice. I put a layer of cheese, crushed tortilla chips and then more cheese on top for a delicious crunchy top. Yummy.

I liked this recipe!  Instead of transferring the chicken mixture into baking dish, I just used the iron skillet that I browned the chicken in. Very good. Thanks!

My husband and I use this dish as one of our go-to dishes.  This is very simple and tastes great.  I've used the Tyson's refrigerated chicken strips to make it even easier.  My mom now makes it also.  She adds rice to her version, but I think the recipe is great as written.

This is a very simple, quick and forgiving recipe.  First time making it - reading other reviews I decided to add my own ingredients. I sauteed the chicken with garlic (2 cloves, pressed) and onions (1/3), drained oil and shredded the chicken, then added spicy taco seasoning, drained corn and beans, I love sauce so I added 1 can of the rotel tomatoes and green chiles and threw in about 1.5 cups of salsa (Vons brand, fiesta salsa). I layered the bottom of the dish with Uncle Ben's 90 second Roasted Chicken rice (cooked).  I used a smaller dish as well, the 9x13 would have made it way too shallow. Instead i used a 8" x 8" x 2" Baking Square Dish.  Topped with cheese and crushed white corn chips - baked and worked out perfectly~!

My family really liked this. I did make changes after reading the reviews. I added some onion and red bell pepper when I browned the chicken. I didn't drain anything. Since I was out of salsa, I added a can of diced tomatoes and a small can of green chilies. I used the whole package of taco seasoning. I served it over rice and used cheddar cheese as that is what I had. My dish did not look like the picture shown but really was good. So nice to find a chicken recipe that doesn't start with cooked chicken. The men in the family added hot sauce as this is just mildly warm. I added black olives but wouldn't do it again or if I did I would use sliced olives. They didn't add anything to the recipe.

My family loved this recipe. I added sauted onion, little more salsa and rice. I layered the cooked white rice, cheese and chicken/black bean mix. Topped with tortilla strips and baked. Delicious!

I'm only giving this three stars because I made so many additions and changes. But my final product was delicious! Changes: Used an undrained can of rotel tomatoes in place of salsa, used the entire package of taco seasoning, did not drain the black beans, used two cups of cheese and used frozen corn, (that's what i had on hand). Additions: sautéed garlic and onion w/the chicken, added jarred jalapenos and added a bit of the jalapeno juice from the jar (we love spicy food). I served this on top rice and turned out GREAT. Tons of juice and flavor, can't wait to eat the leftovers! This was one of the easiest recipes I've ever made and I had all the ingredients on hand which made it even better. Will definitely make this again with my changes.

I have made this several times and it is a very versatile and forgiving dish.  My favorite version thus far is using leftover steak, leftover corn, and leftover wild rice - seems like a weird combo but with the mexican spices it just came to life!  When I don't have taco seasoning on hand, I throw in some garlic, cumin and chili powder and it does the trick.  Great recipe!

I had to make too many changes and additions.  More liquid, more taco seasoning, add tomatoes for more moisture.  I needed a recipe not a good start to a recipe.  By the time it was done it was good but not good enough to make again.  Not at all casserole consistency, we put it over rice like a stew.

This made an excellent change of pace meal.  I added cornbread and a tossed salad.  The only change I made to the recipe was I did not drain the beans and corn.  Therefore I did not add any water.

An excellent fast meal!

I used refried beans as black beans are not as popular in our house... and also topped with scallions (before heating) and chopped tomatoe and black olives (after pulling out of the oven).  

A hit with all ages and made in less than 30 minutes!

This is exactly what I wanted. I made this twice in one week. I did not use chicken breast, but 2 lb ground turkey. It was wonderful.  I did not do #'s 3-5, but did it all on the stove.  Yes, this took less than 30 mins.  I will make this over and over again.

This was excellent!  Instead of transfering it to a casserole dish, I left it in the skillet (mine can go in the oven).  This was a quick one dish meal with little clean up.  I will definitely make it again!

This is a new family favorite for us! That doesn't happen often.  My whole family loved it.  I did make some changes, as we are trying to eat a little healthier.  I am trying to lower fat and sodium while increasing fiber/veggies, etc.  
I added 2 chopped tomatoes.  And I used dry beans that I had made ahead and also frozen corn to lower sodium.  I added more beans.  I also used Doritos instead of tortilla chips to add flavor although that may have not helped me on the fat/sod. content.  
I also thought that this recipe would be great baked without the chips and then just scooped into a tortilla.  This would lower fat/sodium content even more.

This is a good basic recipe.  It's best when doctored up to suit your personal preference.  For example, the second time I made this, I added chopped onion, green pepper, and jalapeno pepper with the chicken.  I also used leftover roasted chicken instead of cooking from scratch.  I only had creamed corn, so I used that, and I think I preferred it to the whole kernel corn as it melded with the rest of the dish.  Quick and easy when you're short on time and inspiration.

FAB!  Made the following changes:  used grocery store prepared/roasted chicken and pulled off the bone enough for recipe.  Made D's Famous Salsa (available on this site) for the salsa, and used more than called for.  Stirred taco seasoning with amount of water called for on package.  Mixed all that in skillet with other skillet ingredients.  Made sure that mixture was nice and moist, given comments from other cooks.  Instead of plain tortilla chips, used crushed Fritos.  Family loved this.  Great the next day, too, because hot dish always taste better the next day!

I simmered the chicken in the taco seasoning (with water) and pulled it as it cooked.  Thought this gave it more flavor than just cubed. I also doubled the salsa like the reviews said. And doubled the corn but needed.  And I also added some chopped jalapeno's for kick.  
Delicious!  I will make this again soon!

Pre-cooked chicken and shredded it.  Also added about 1/2-3/4 cup salsa with a little bit of water because all the reviews saying it was too dry.  Also used way more cheese then listed.  With those changes, it was a big hit!

Pretty good base for a super dish! I doubled the cheese and salsa, and added onions, black olives and garlic.  Next time, I'll use the whole pack of taco seasoning and probably get the mexican/spicy corn and beans.

FANTASTIC with both hamburger & chicken. (I used a can 14.5oz of precooked chicken to save even MORE time.)  Next time I may add refried beans. Rather than putting the chips on top, I serve them on the side. This way, the kids think they're eating an appetizer, or at least something other than dinner!
Thanks for sharing.

Good Recipe.  Doubled the ingredients and added LOTS more chips to the top.  Also, seasoned the chicken while cooking with garlic powder, salt and paprika for more flavor.  Will probably substitute ground beef next time.

This was a delicious meal.  I added extra chicken, a whole packet of taco seasoning, and while preparing could see I needed more liquid, so I added a whole jar of salsa. Very tasty.

Very good! I baked a chicken on the grill, took the meat off the bone added it to a skillet with 1/4 cup olive oil added taco seasoning mix, approx. 1 cup salsa and the rest of the ingredients! Also put hot peppers on top of mine! I also doubled the amount of cheese.

Awesome and easy.  Made some modifications, added can of chopped green chilies, diced tomatoes with green chilies and one can of mexican corn.  I did use the whole package of taco seasoning but also added about 1/4 cup of water.  Topped it with sour cream before serving.  It was delicious, the family loved it, this one is a keeper!!  And I have leftovers for lunch!

This was a great recipe, but only since I changed it slightly.  Like many other reviews suggested, I used garlic when sauteeing the chicken, and also added green onions and a little bit of curry powder.  In addition to the beans, corn, and salsa, I used green chiles, olives, extra salsa, and about 3/4 of the taco mix.  However, I did add water to it, and it came out pretty runny.  Otherwise it was a great recipe, definitely a hit!

This was so easy! I also used the precooked cubed chicken and I added more salsa, water and a can of diced chilis. I made a double batch very easily so I could take it to a friend. I made everything the night before and added the chips right before cooking. Keeper!

This is a great recipe!!  My family loved it and wanted seconds.  I did change a few things, I added onions, used the whole pack of taco seasoning and used quite a lot of Pace Picante and a large can of corn. I'll be making it often! So easy and tasty.

I made this for my family and we loved it.  My mom liked it, and usually doesn't like mexican food like this, and then made it and took it to a church potluck where lots of people begged for the recipe.  This doubles well, and if you do double it, you don't need to double the topping.  Great way to get rid of stale torilla and corn chips.

I altered this a tiny bit by using leftover cooked Turkey, so I skipped the frying stage.  But it was soooo easy and it tasted GREAT.  The family LOVED it!  I highly recommend this recipe.  DELISH!

This is one of my favorite recipes now!  We don't have kids but my husband loved it.  Just enough kick to satisfy the spiciness-lover in me... I substitued torn flour tortilla shells in place of the tortilla chips to reduce the salt and fat and it turned out great.

This recipe is the best!  Everyone who has tried it has loved it!  I have given it out to more people than I can count.  For a fun spin, I layered it with flour tortillas to give it a "lasagne" flair. I did use more salsa than the recipe says, about half a jar instead of a 1/4 cup. Even my picky five year old eats seconds of this one!!

It was super easy! I added chopped onions as I sautéed the chicken, and used standard chunky salsa and green verde salsa. Instead of plain tortilla chips I used Tostito roasted red pepper chips. I put a full layer on the bottom and the rest, crushed on top. Mmm! So good!

Highly recommend doing the chicken in the slow cooker so it’s super tender and not dry.  I did it in the instant pot for 5 hours in chicken broth first and then sautéd everything together in the instant pot too!  Also recommend adding tomatoes

My hubby gave this a strong 7 out of 10, I used mild salsa to (try) and get the kid to eat, so generally it could have used a bit more zip. It is easy peasy to put together, great for weeknight. Will definitely keep around as good, hearty, quick & pretty healthy dinner.

This was an easy and simple recipe that my family loved. There wasn't a bite left. I served it with canned beef tamales.

Loved it! Switched out red pepper flakes for chili powder and used a bit of ground turkey and left it mostly vegetables including I added extra salsa with beans in it and extra cheese.

Made this for a second time and everyone loved it.  I used just over 2 lbs of chicken since I had it. It turned out great and disappeared fast. I made this and the Cornell Chicken,at the same time, giving people a choice.  This won hands down.  . Will continue to make this.

Easy... inexpensive quick and feeds several... so a Good recipe as is but also great as a base for adding extras according to your families favorite tastes!! I served Mexican style canned tomatoes on the side along with sour cream and shredded lettuce. I will add some rice next time and hubby says try crushed fritos!!

This is a good weeknight dinner. I made my own taco seasoning as I wanted to cut down on the salt.  I thought that shredding the chicken would bring this recipe up to another level.  Defiantly needs more hot sauce!

This was tasty and very easy to make. Family's ratings varied from liked it to loved it, but all agreed it goes in the "make again" file.

The recipe calls for 1/2 (1.25 oz) package of taco seasoning - I used an entire 1.0 oz package of Old El Paso seasoning and the flavor was great. Less seasoning may be too little, but depends on the brand and your taste.

I used Colby Jack cheese and the flavor was great. As written, the cheese is sufficient. However, in my house, more cheese is always better, so I added about 3/4 cup more.

Really good recipe, as written, for an 8 x 8 pan.  I used about 1 T of  Echols' Taco I seasoning from this site.  I cooked the chicken and onions with the seasoning.  Otherwise pretty much stayed with the recipe.  Thanks!

This was great.  Listening to the reviews: I cooked onions and garlic with the chicken, I did not drain the beans or corn, and I used 3/4 cups of salsa. Definite thumbs up.

This was very good but just a little bland. I think next time I will add more seasonings and some green chilies. It's best served with taco toppings like sour cream, guacamole, black olives, onions, etc.

My family enjoyed this very much.  I also made the Spanish rice to go along with it. We had Tortilla chips with it. Added extra cheese. Very yummy.

I loved this dish. So easy to prepare. I just had left overs for lunch, the crunchy top is now soft but it's still tasty. I will be adding this into our monthly rotation.

This was very good and I took it to a party and all seemed to really like it. However, for me, I thought it had too much corn and it did not look as appetizing as I would have preferred. I will probably try something different next time

Great take-along dish for church dinners, picnics, etc.  I used the whole packet of taco seasoning for chicken to amp up the flavor a little more and additional mild chunky salsa.  Your dish will come home empty!

I made for a potluck, well the people at the potluck didn't like it, but my son loved it. I didnt make it spicey enough for him, so he added queso and more salsa. It was mild enough for me. I didn't drain the corn but drained and rinsed the black beans. I think I will make without the chips and cheese on top and serve it a dip

We really liked this one with one variation, instead of topping it with chips, I used a prepared box of Jiffy cornbread mix, it ended up being just the right amount of sweet and spicy, for more kick next time I might add taco seasoning to the cornbread mix.

Great recipe. I did change a couple things though. I cooked the chicken with a small onion and 2 cloves of garlic. I added one can of hot green chiles and I didn’t drain any of the cans. When I layered it in the casserole dish I added a layer of salsa as well. It turned out spicy but so good! Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy! I added onions and instead of regular corn, I used Mexican corn.  However, to make it zestier I would definitely add  more corn, black beans and chopped jalapeno peppers.  Also I need to mention that I did not drain the beans or the corn.  This was a terrific dish.  My family loved it!!!

I added about 3/4c rice instead of corn (I was out) and added about 5 oz of tomato sauce instead of extra water. Otherwise I followed the directions and it came out great.

Was looking for a casserole type of dish, and this is really more of a chicken chile type of dish! I followed the advice of some of the positive reviews to include the liquid from the beans and the corn AND, I doubled the meat (which was only about two boneless/skinless breasts) and used the entire packet of taco seasoning. Added some diced onions (because my family LOVES onions!).  While everything was brewing on the stove, I checked some of the negative reviews. One comment that came up multiple times was, "There's nothing to hold it all together!"  Uh oh! Went to some of the similar recipes on this page & got a few ideas and ended up with quite the experiment! Lol  I let the mixture cook down to eliminate some of the soupiness, then added about a cup of sour cream and removed from the stove. Next, used a couple cups of crushed tortilla chips with some grated cheese on the bottom of the 13x9 pan & pre-baked it for approximately 10 minutes. Dumped the mixture from this recipe onto the "crust", topped with onions, 1 1/2 cups crushed tortilla chips and more grated cheese. Popped it in the oven for about 25 minutes, served with guacamole and more sour cream. It actually turned out to be a pretty successful experiment! Bottom line, though, the way the recipe is written, it is not a casserole, regardless of how many tortilla chips and cheese you add. It's a soup or stew.

I followed the advice of others. I added onion and garlic to the oil before adding the chicken. I served the meal with extra tortilla chips on the side and a dollop of sour cream on top.

Both my son and grandson called this a winner and asked to have it again. I doubled the amounts and added mild chilli peppers. I also used chicken broth instead of water.  The leftovers  were spoken for before we left the table.

If you like Mexican flavors, you will like  this casserole. It is one dish meal that my family enjoyed. I have made many times as is and it was pretty good, but for me, these few changes made it much better. 1st of all I use more chicken (3/4 LB isn't enough for my family of 4}. In addition to the taco seasoning mix. I add some chopped garlic, salt, cumin and cilantro. Also, I double the amount of salsa. I Just eyeball the crushed tortilla chips and the cheese.Last, you need to know that the recommended pan size in here is too big for the amount of food called for.

I made this as written because I was looking for something with good flavor but not spicy.  My wife is going through chemo right now so her taste has changed and it is hard to find something with good flavor that doesn't burn her mouth.  This was perfect for her.  She loved it!

First I sauteed some chopped onion then added the some Costco roasted chicken and cut off  3/4 pound and cubed it up. I also added some canned green chilles and drained the black beans but not the corn. I put the corn and liquid in. I didn't have any taco seasoning so I made my own from ingredients I googled to find out what was in it. I finished it off with a couple dashes of red wine vinegar.  Served with some sour cream. Most delicious.

Made this for my weekly work lunch. Very straight forward and simple to make and taste good as well. Only part I would change is just adding more. I doubled the chicken n corn but that still really wasn't enough. Next time might add more variations of beans for filler. Overall still satisfied.

Boy oh boy did I make it and we chowed it down!!! So in our family I am a "not so hot" and my hubby is "I am HOT" kinda guy. So I made this using only mild taco and mild salsa, but hubby (while on his plate) poured on the hot sauce. Happy couple! I am so making this again for company.  If you like Mexican food you can't go wrong with this.

I stirred in 4 oz. of cream cheese before I put the mixture in the baking pan ( because I love creamy sauces). I did not put corn in the mixture because I felt that the beans gave it enough carbs. It was yummy. I will definitely make this again

This is my husbands favourite recipe and he is so picky.  And the nicest thing about this recipe is that if I can't find the actual recipe it always turns out fabulous if I just eyeball the ingredients.  Easy and delicious I have this in my rotation and eat it once every couple of weeks.  The other thing I do differently is add multi-grain chips as I like the flavour better.

The flavor was on, but it dried out. Also, needed a binder of some sort as it was crumbly on the bottom. Maybe double the cheese and put half of it in the mix with the chicken?

I made this with the following substitutions/additions: 2 lbs ground turkey for the chicken, 2 c. frozen corn kernels (thawed) for the canned corn, 1 pkg taco sauce instead of salsa.  Added 1 can green chiles and some dried onions.  Needed to add a little bit of water.  Omitted the corn chips.  My family of guys loved it. Better the next day!

Great!  Here is what I did differently to make this even better:
-Used 2 large chicken breasts seasoned with Carne Asada, baked at 350 for 25 min then shredded with a fork instead of cubing.
-Sauteed onion and fresh garlic, then added chicken, whole package of HOT taco seasoning, whole jar of HOT good quality salsa, un-drained can of black beans, un-drained can of corn (no H20).  Also added some fresh cilantro, hot sauce (Tapatio), can of green chills. I didn't add Jalapenos to this but I would try it!
-Made a box of quick Spanish style rice and added the whole thing to the mixture.  This makes the casserole less soupy and is AWESOME INSIDE.  Highly recommend adding spicy rice.
-Tore up flour tortillas, spread one layer at very bottom of Pyrex dish and one layer in the middle of the casserole, also added cheese to the middle of casserole (lasagna-style)
- added cheese and crushed up tortilla chips to the top as recommended.  Serve with sour cream.  I made this for my fiance and some friends, received applause.  Great recipe!

This was pretty good. I would make it again but with some changes. As others suggested, I would not drain the corn. It needs the extra liquid. I would also add more salsa...only because my husband and I really love salsa lol. Lastly, I would boil the chicken until tender then shred it rather than cutting it into chunks and cooking it over oil. Thank you for the recipe :).

Followed the other comment advice and cooked the chicken with some onions and garlic, then added Chipotle sauce as well. I skipped the water and added the beans and corn without draining. Oh goodness was this delicious!  Had some Mexican rice and salad on the side. Definitely a quick and delicious dinner and a new go-to quick fix meal!

Not bad.  I modified it by putting it in the slow cooker and using nacho cheese sauce for the cheese--just topped at serving with cheddar as well.  This worked out well in the slow cooker, but does turn out soupy.  Not surprising--I was expecting that--but not something I want to do when I really have my heart set on a casserole dish.  In that case, I'd just do as directed.  However, I had a bunch of frozen items (beans, chicken) when I went to make this dish and didn't have the time to defrost and bake, so I just dumped it all in the slow cooker, turned it on high for about 4-6 hours, and voila!  Dinner!  I did make rice to serve it over.  Turned out delicious, and I'm glad I tried it that way--this makes it so easy and great meal for a busy day.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this into a vegetarian dish. Used one can of retried beans rather than chicken. Followed others' suggestions...one sautéed onion + 4 cloves of garlic, one cup of rice, 3/4 bottle of salsa. Also I used a homemade recipe for taco seasoning found on allrecipes, cut down on the sodium. Delicious!

Good and easy!  I didn't have chips so I put in a cup of rice .  I also used homemade taco seasoning, and a bit more salsa.  Served with sour cream (or yogurt) and avocado.

My mom and I had a lot of fun with this one. Nothing like cooking our Sunday night "comfort food" and watching premium cable! We steeped New Mexico dried chili peppers in chicken broth and used that same broth to cook our rice in. The rice was a beautiful brown color when finished (I have always struggled getting spanish rice to turn that color.) We just mixed pinto beans (substitute for back beans, pintos are milder than black beans for some relief) to the rice. The chicken we cooked separately from the onions and garlic then added corn and diced tomatoes to the mix. Used the rice and chicken mix as our layers and also included layers of Sargento mexican cheeses, provolone (for stringiness) and corn tortillas smeared with cream cheese. Topped with cheeses and VOILA.

My family really liked this!  I used 2 lbs. boneless chicken thighs instead & a 15 oz. can of corn.  I baked it in a 9 by 9 casserole dish.  When I took it out to add more cheese, I first spread another 1/4 cup salsa.  There were no left overs and I served 3 people!!!

Would add more salsa. Also doubled the cheese for topping. Easy and chicken tenders were very moist. Added some taco seasoning while browning chicken for flavor.

My kids devour this.  I read the reviews and added a can of petite diced tomatoes with chiles as well as an entire jar of salsa, but I also used 1 1/2 lbs of chicken.  It was incredible.  Easy, quick and yummy.  What more can you ask for?

We didn't love this. The chicken to vegetable ratio seems way off to me, I probably would add two more cans of beans and twice the corn. Bell peppers too. Also seems like the oven baking is unnecessary, cheese can melt on the stove. Anyways, we didn't like this more than chicken tacos or burritos and it was the same amount of effort. Would not recommend.

I used chicken thighs and Rotel instead of salsa. I have to agree that it needs spicing up a little. Maybe a little cayenne next time. But my husband does not like spicy food and he LOVED it. He liked the crunch of the chips. I will make this again because he liked it so much.

For anyone who wants tips on how to make this less bland without changing it up too much, I would suggest adding taco sauce instead of water, don't drain the black beans I think the juice adds a lot of flavor and maked sure your salsa is not mild, get it as hot as you can handle. That's how I make it.

Quick, simple and scrumptious!

Whole family loved this recipe and ate it in different ways.  Okay, I used Hot Taco Mix (family preference), cooked diced onion with the chicken in skillet, used frozen corn instead of canned, and added extra 1/2 cup of salsa (then didn't add water).  Unfortunately, I didn't have any cheese on hand so I made it without but it was still sooooo good!  I ate mine with scoops chips, my daughter put hers on a salad, and my son ate his in a taco shell.

There are very few meals that appeal to all of my family members but this one made us feel like we were eating out on a weekday!!  I doubled the ingredients but still did not need a 9X13 pan.  Other than leaving out the chips, no other modifications.  I have already added this to the dinner rotation.  My younger daughter said this would be great for a party with chips...like a think con queaso!!    It is very good and worth trying!!!

very easy. Make your own taco seasoning to control salt intake. I first sauted a small onion.I used a can of diced tomatoes with onion and green bell pepper. seasoned chicken with taco seasoning and cooked chicken in the sauce. then followed the recipe for the rest.

i dont know how much i liked this! i made it exactly as the recipe.. except i added onion and garlic in the beginning after reading other peoples reviews. i ate it with sour cream, tomatoes, and cholula (sp?) hot sauce on top. i'm thinking tomorrow i'm going to eat it as a taco type salad and i think that might be better!
EDIT: it was a lot better mixed in with a salad the next day!!! i just used romaine/ spinach mix and added extra cheese, tomatoes, sour cream, and cholula hot sauce. it was excellent that time!

My son didn't like it, but I loved it. I put 1/4 cup of chillies, 1/4 of pace picante hot, some liquid from the corn/beans and added a cup of rice before the oven. crunched up a few taco shells i had and immersed them in the liquid in a layered approach.

This dish is so easy and quick to make. Next time we make it we re going to add few different kinds of bell peppers to it and maybe some onion. I def recommend this one!

i don't know how to make many mexican dishes other than the typical tacos & enchiladas, so this was a nice alternative in the same genre.

This was pretty good and very easy to make but it was kind of bland and missing something.  I cooked the chicken with a can of chicken broth in a crock pot for 7 hours on low, then shredded and sauteed it.  I added more salsa, probably about a cup and it still didn't seem like enough.  Once I topped it with salsa and sour cream it was much tastier.  I think this would make a very tasty burrito, but I won't make it on it's own again.

Had high hopes for this but it did not wow. I thought it couldn't go wrong with what went in it, but even with upping the salsa it was rather bland. If I make it again I will definitely add chilis, hot sauce, etc.

This really hit the spot when you are hungry for mexican but really don't want tacos!! Instead of putting the taco seasoning in, I used a taco seasoned rice. Very good addition. Must up the water and salsa amounts to make the rice plump.

This was a great recipe, but like many people some doctoring was necessary. We added a full can of green chilies, bell peppers and onions to give it a bit more kick. Very delicious! If we had to make it again, we'd probably mix in some tortilla chips as well as put it on top of the dish.

This was excellent!  I added some extra salsa, but other than that, didn't change the recipe at all.  I served it with a side of Allrecipes Guacamole, It was a hit!  Next time I might add some rice as other reviewers suggested.

This recipe is great just as it is posted, except I used a slightly smaller casserole dish. I put sour cream on the table, I tried it both ways and liked it both ways.  This simple recipe will get added to my "in a hurry" recipes.

One of our favorite meals.  I cook chicken every week in my slow cooker and then shred it to have for meals throughout the week.  This meal comes together in a snap with already shredded chicken.  I also use corn tortillas instead of chips.  I layer tortillas, chicken mixture, more tortillas, more chicken and the cheese and sauce.  We have this nearly every week and absolutely love it!

Excellent  recipe!  I have a very picky son and he thought it was yummy.  I used Del Monte diced tomatoes with green chilies and Bush's pinto beans in chili sauce.  i also added a little more salsa.

Great jumping point recipe. Like many others I: -Sauteed garlic and onion before adding the chicken. I used whole frozen chicken breast pieces and cut them with the spatula in the pan after they cooked half way through. I hate cutting raw chicken on a board. :-) -I did not drain the beans so no added water was needed. -I used half a bag of frozen corn instead of canned. -I also used a whole jar of salsa. -I added beans,corn, seasoning and salsa to my stainless steel pan and put the whole thing in the oven to avoid using another dish and have less cleaning. :-) The whole family loved it served with a green onion cilantro salad.

GREAT basic recipe - sauteed 1/4 minced onion with 1 clove minced garlic, added 1/2 lb ground turkey, 1/2 packet taco seasoning, few shakes of Johnny's seasoning salt, and cooked until done. Added 1 cup pinto beans, 1 cup black beans, small can of sliced olives (drained), and 1/2 cup pico de gallo salsa. Heated mixture through till bubbly then transferred to glass 9x9, then topped with 1/2c cheddar and layered with crunched up white corn tortilla chips. Baked 10min, added 1/2c cheddar. Served with sliced avocado on top. My boyfriend requested that this be our main Mexican flavored dish - YUMMY

I took the other reviewers' advice, sauteing garlic and onions in the cooking oil, adding more (hot!) salsa and cheese, preserving the liquid from the black beans, and cooking the whole shebang in the cast iron skillet it was simmered in.  I also cooked the chicken in a crock pot before shredding it and tossing it in with the sauteed garlic and onions.  This kept the chicken very moist, and I was able to use the broth remaining in the crock pot instead of water to keep everything flavorful and tender. It turned out great and reheats surprisingly well if you have any leftovers. We will definitely make this again. Thanks!

now a family staple as my girls love tacos and I am always looking for a way to use seasoned meat just to add variety.  After making it as is,  I now throw a pile of cilantro, more tomato and taco fixings to make this a taco in a pan.  Perfect for packing for my lunch, too

I loved this! I did do a few things different just do to what I had on hand. I didn't drain the beans or the corn, I used cumin, chili powder, salt & pepper instead of taco seasoning, I used a can of stewed tomatoes with green peppers instead of salsa, and I topped it with cheese no crushed chips. My family enjoyed it but it was better as leftovers because I threw some on top of lettuce and made taco salads with it. Wow, it was amazing. I'd love to keep this on hand to take salads for lunch. I didn't even need any others dressings. Great recipe!!

This was a decent casserole and pretty flavorful. Next time I think I will add a little "hot" to it though because for me it was a little on the bland side and I like my mexican food spicy. I added a layer of tortillas to the bottom of the pan and it eased serving the casserole tremendously! Topped with a dab of sour cream and it was pretty good. Very easy to make, not so great as leftovers because the cheese and chip layer gets a little leathery with reheating.

I loved this recipe. I added extra water like some of the reviews suggested and ours was a bit too runny. We used our casserole as filling in flour tortillas and everyone loved it. My 15 month old even ate the chicken and squealed for more!

Decided to cook this last minute, because I just happen to have all the ingredients. I didn't it would turn out and actually end up liking it, but this was an AWESOME recipe! It was so easy! We ate it all up! I followed other reviewers suggestion of adding onion and garlic, etc. I had no Taco Seasoning, so I just threw in oregano, cumin, season salt and pepper.

I did what the other reviewers did and spiced it up a little with extra salsa and kept the water in the beans and corn.  It turned out great.  The plus side is that I have 3 extremely picky eaters and they all LOVED IT!  One of my sons didn't make the first complaint.  I can't remember the last time that happened.

My family LOVED this recipe. They told me it was a keeper. My son asked for it again today. I did make minor changes. I used kidney beans instead of black beans, since that was what I had in the cubbard. I also sprayed the pan with Pam and put half of the chrushed tortilla chips on the bottom of pan. I spinkled it with a little cheese before I put the chicken mixture in the pan. Then I followed the rest of the directions. Topped it with a dab of sourcream and spinkled it with chopped olives. It tasted great, and it was easy clean up.

I made this and LOVED it. It's hard for me to give something a 5 star. However please read "DELE PETERSON " When I read he is a fireman, I had a good idea this recipe would be a hit. Everything he suggested was right on! (Replaced the black beans with chill pinto beans with the sauce.) Replacing the corn tortillas for the chips made the meal!

This was really yummy and very easy to make!!  I added a can of green chilis also.  Instead of preheating the oven, I had the oven ready at 350 degrees and only did the cheese routine once and it was great.  I also only put cheese on half of it because my husband is trying to eat better, but he ended up eating his half and some of the cheese half!  I will for sure make it again.  It reminded me of chicken tortilla soup but as a casserole.

I changed it up a bit. I cooked the chicken and and add all the other ingrediants accordingly, but instead of making a layered asserole I cooked everything up on the stove and served it in stuffed tortillas. Very good.

This recipe was very good. I used hot salsa and a little extra taco seasoning for some kick. I served it over rice and thought it was wonderful! Even my husband, who isn’t a fan of new recipes, liked it.

As written.. this was just ok. However, I added green chilis, mushrooms, onions, garlic and black olives to the mixture... Also, I used home made taco seasoning from this site (Bill Echols) and the second time with making this it turned out much better! This is for sure a good base recipe.

A little bland, but being in Texas we like it spicy! I added garlic, doubled the salsa (my hubby's homemade), used the liquid from the beans and corn.  My picky 16 year old liked it along with her friends.  It's a do again!

I was looking for something to make with defrosted chicken breasts after my husband backed out on making supper for us at the last minute.  I didn't read the reviews, I just checked to make sure I had all the ingredients.  I didn't have everything, but I had enough to substitute.  I used kidney beans and and soft taco shells.  I layered it taco shells ripped up, the chicken/corn/bean mix, cheese and tacos again.  It was really good!  Next time I will definitely make some changes though.  I was thinking of things to add while I was quickly throwing this dish together!

I got even my pickiest eater to scarf this down.  I didn't add the water just used the salsa juice as a liquid.  I crushed Fritos on the top which I think would be better.  Added more cheese and a whole package of taco seasoning.  Thanks for submitting.

This was super easy to make. I didn't even have to buy any of the ingredients, just used what I had in the cupboards.  I replaced the water with broth and ripped up corn tortillas instead of using chips because that is what I had on hand.  My husband really liked it.  I added guacamole before serving.  Delicious!

Excellent and simple recipe. It does need a little extra to make it flavorful, and definitely add more salsa if you want it spicy. I used some green salsa and a mixture of pepper-jack and cheddar cheeses. I also added onion, garlic and cumin to the chicken. Next time I'll include green chilis and diced jalapenos to give it a kick.

Used more salsa instead of water as recommended in many reviews, but still this was just an average dish that was no more than the sum of its ingredients.  Perhaps cooking the chicken, then shredding it would help, but as it is, this is sort of a meaty baked nachos.  Reheating it produced a very dry meaty baked nacho dish.

He always has some critique, but none for this dish!  AND my two kids (2 and 3 years old) ate their meal and asked for seconds!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Delicious!!  Everyone loved this.  I didn't have tortilla chips so I used dorito's instead.  I added at least twice the amount of salsa and tons of cheese.  Absolutely loved this and will go into the dinner rotation.

Great, easy recipe!  I rinsed the beans (I think you should always rinse black beans), but I used the liquid from the corn in lieu of water per suggestions.  I cooked chicken with diced onion, and next time I will saute some red and green peppers to add to the chicken and onions.

I took other reviewers hints and added minute rice and cream cheese. I also added the black beans and corn with their liquid. Turned out great. Great recipe. Definitely a keeper!

I never follow the recipe exactly, but this was a good starting point.  I didn't have taco seasoning on hand so instead I used garlic and ground red pepper, which I sprinkled on the chicken when I was cooking.  Like others suggested I fried diced onion and bell pepper with the chicken and used some of the juice from the black beans instead of water.  I prefer fresh corn so I baked an ear before hand, and added that instead of the canned corn.  I also added green onion on top in the last five minutes of baking for some extra flavor. For a first try it was pretty decent, but I think I will use more salsa and veggies next time because the taste of the beans was a little overpowering.  My biggest complaint was that the cheese congealed the tortilla chips together so that the top layer too easily seperated from the rest.  Next time I will experiment with the layering to see if I can get the dish to have a more casserole like consistency.  Note: Not great for leftovers because the chips get soggy.

Quite good, but if I make it again, I'll layer in more chips or some tortillas. It was a bit too soup-y, and would have been nice with a bit more firm bits.

So good! The hubby scarfed it down and grabbed seconds.  I followed some suggestions of other reviewers. I did not add water, I used the water in the can of corn and about half of the liquid of the beans. I also accidently dumped the whole bottle of salsa into the pan so I just left it in there. Use medium salsa and spicy taco mix.  I also added a cup of minute rice before putting in the oven.  I used rostierie chicken leftovers.  Really good! Will definitely make this one again.  Yum!

Very good!  I didn't really mess with it too much, it probably would have been just fine as-is. I use a whole pound of chicken, added an extra cup of cheese, and a quarter cup extra of chips.  I also didn't add any extra water, but I didn't drain the corn in order to compensate. I thought this was really good, and easy!

This was super easy to make!  However, I still didn't like it the first time around, but it was good leftover as a filling for tacos.

I've been making variations of this recipe, on my own, for years.  The only thing that attracted me to this version was the casserole idea... and, I have to say- that was the worst part.  My advice: shred the chicken, skip the casserole dish altogether, serve it w/ warm tortillas & fresh lettuce and call it some kind of taco.  The filling is good, but the baking is unnecessary & unflattering.

I would give this a 5 star rating... but I made a TON of changes so can barely call it the same recipe.   For starters, I used a pack (20 oz) of ground turkey, onion, garlic, and a whole packet of fajita mix sauteed in the pan together. I added probably twice the amount of (frozen) corn and salsa, added a can of green chilis, no need for any water, probably doubled the cheese and halved the tortilla chips... I eyeball everything.   It was delicious and I will definetely make it again! I topped w/ light sour cream and homemade guacamole, served w/ a few chips on the side and a nice cold Corona!

Fast, easy, and delicious! Other than substituting crushed chips, which I didn't have, for torn tortillas, I followed the recipe as written. Each family member doctored their portions to their liking; adding sour cream, more salsa, hot sauce, chopped onions, crushed red peppers, etc..

My family loved this recipe! I made some very minor changes (I added a chopped onion and jalepenos, doubled the salsa to half a cup, and since I was out of taco seasoning, I substituted chili powder, cumin and chipolte chili powder).  Great flavor and pretty healthy! The Daily Plate calorie count is 351 calories with 12 grams of fat. The fat content in my version should be lower, as I used baked chips and 2% sharp cheddar.

This was wonderful. I made it as in the recipe using equal amounts salsa and water. I also used a little more cheese on the top layer. And to make it even easier, I used an oven-proof skillet so it went straight from stove top to oven! It's a great meal that was fairly fast and everyone enjoyed it.

This was a great recipe to start with, but I feel it would have been kind of blah without some of the changes I made, suggested by other reviewers: Sauted onions and minced garlic with the chicken, and added lots more salsa than called for. I also ended up adding some cumin and chili powder when I tasted it after simmering and decided it still needed something. Oh, and I used the liquid from the corn and black beans instead of adding water, and added a can of green chilis. My husband wasn't a fan of the tortilla chips on top, he said he would prefer the whole mixture wrapped up enchilada style and baked. I think I'll try that next time.

This was great but i thought it should be either the inside to a burrito or a dip. Too heavy for little ol' me. Boyfriend LOVED it though. Definately needed the cyan pepper sauce to kick it up, not spicy enough.

Fantastic! My semi-picky 19 month old loved it!  I had some leftover marinated chicken (Mrs Dash Garlic & Herb marinade)that I used instead of plain chicken.  Also, I used the whole can of corn (mine was a 15 oz can) and added in more salsa instead of water. I probably doubled the salsa.  My hubby, MIL, daughter and I all loved this recipe! Will make again and probably try freezing it.

I wanted to make something different, but I was a little nervous my kids wouldn't eat it. Turns out my husband and 5yr son loved it, and my 3yr daughter liked it enough to eat most of her portion. I'll definitely use it again. I use a can of diced tomatoes instead of salsa, and eat tortilla chips on the side, rather than baking them in.

Very good; black beans make the dish.  I boiled the chicken instead of cooking it in the pan and then I just mixed all the ingredients together in the casserole dish.  Worked fine!  13-yr old had 3 helpings!

This recipe was excellent. What I did with my casserole was I added onions and garlic just like others who had made this recipe did, and also I added jalopeno peppers to one casserole and left the other regular. Overall this recipe was fun easy and delicious.

The whole family loved this dish! I skipped the oven step though- Just served it in individual bowls with shredded cheese on top. Skipped the chips- didn't have any. Would be super yummy with a plop of guacamole and/or sour cream on top, served over rice. Tastes a little bit like a burrito bowl from Chipotle. Yummy!

This was ok, but nothing special.  It needs enough fixing, that it is likely not worth trying again.

I made this last night & we usually have leftovers but not with this dish!  3 kids & 1 hubbie enjoyed it. This is also a VERY EASY dish to make. I added more cheese but everything else stayed the same.

This recipe was super easy.  I didn't have all the right ingredience so I used what I had.  Instead of one can black beans, I used two cans of pinto beans and I used chili packet instead of taco.  It still turned out great.  Will make this again. Oh, I also threw some jalopenos in.

Decent recipe with all the changes the other reviewers had suggested.  I took the advice and sauteed an onion and garlic before adding the chicken.  I also did not drain the beans.  I was reluctant to keep all the juice from the corn, so I drained off half of the juice from the corn.  I am glad I did because it would have been way too runny otherwise.  With the changes it was a recipe that both myself and my husband enjoyed.

This was really delicious and I will make it again. I didn't have any chips on hand but made it anyway, with steamed flour tortillas on the side, and I did use the taco seasoning recipe from this site. It was so good, very filling, quite versatile and I don't have any left. Thanks for submitting!

Very tasteful.  Adjusted to fit what I had on hand.  Added a red bell pepper for flavor and color.  Used kidney beans, instead of black beans.  Didn't have enough salsa, so used a can of mild rotel. Spicy and flavorful, but not too hot.

Awesome dish.  We loved it!  I actually used Nacho flavored doritoes instead of plain chips.  I also used the whole packet of taco seasoning and added a good amount of water to keep it moist.  (about 1.5 cups).  I doubled up on the cheese, and used about 1/2 cup more salsa.  It was soo good.  It is going on next week's menue again.

With a few changes this was a reall good dish.  My 2 year old ate it up and she has been EXTREMELY picky lately :P
I added rice (cooked with half the packet of taco seasoning and a some cumin, reserving the other half to stir in the salsa/chicken mixture) and used shredded chicken because I had some left over that I needed to use.  I also added a small can of green chilies and frozen corn instead of canned.  I did have to increase the salsa because of the extra ingredients.  I read a lot of reviews how the chips got soggy so I skipped the second cheese layer; I just topped with cheese then the crushed chips.  I followed the recomended cooking time of 15 minutes @ 350 and it came out fine.  The chips were still crunchy and had a nice baked flavor.

This recipe is easy and good....but it's not all that "casseroley"....so I added in about a cup of cooked rice and that made it more filling...other then that, it's great.

This was good but I've had better Mexican casseroles; It didn't say how much water and I may have added more than necessary since mine was pretty saucy when finished.  I felt the meal needed something to go along with it to be complete... Somehow it seemed like a filling  for something else instead of a casserole.  If I make again, I'll serve it with rice or a green salad.  *** Update; I reheated the leftover casserole today and made soft tacos with it.  I added some sour cream and a little more cheese.  It was better this way!

Absolutely delicious!  I took the advise of other reviews and used an entire jar of salsa.  I also didn't drain the beans and I used a whole package of mild taco seasoning. My husband is already looking forward to our next "Mexican Night" dinner, and he has requested this.

I followed along with others, but added a little more:  I added the garlic and onion while cooking the chicken, added the green chilies to the mixture, used southwest salsa instead of regular salsa and then at the very end, added pasta to the mix.  I used elbow macaroni (it was what I had) because without it it was too much like a 'stew' for my husband's taste.  He loves things with pasta and it turned out great.  I served it with sour cream as a stand alone dish.

I would have given 3 stars (3 and 1/2 was my personal rating), but since I changed some things that might have changed the taste, I gave it 4. I prefer the Burrito Pie recipe on this site to this one, but this wasn't bad.  I used fritos (which I enjoyed), and I doubled the salsa and cheese.  I added 1/2 can of green chilies, and like other reviewers, I left the liquid in the corn and beans.  One thing I did that I think may have taken away from the taste of the original recipe was that I boiled the chicken instead of frying it to try to make it a bit of a healthier meal.  Overall, it was good, just not my favorite.  :)

WOW!! What a fantastic recipe. I did alter it a bit to suit our taste. I used a whole jar of salsa, 3 chicken breasts, 2 packets of taco seasoning, cumin, chile powder, 2 cans of mexi-corn (undrained), and insterad of water I used some chicken broth. I also added some sliced black olives. Instead of crushed tostidos I used corn tortillas. I also chopped up some scallions and sprinkled them in with the cheese. My husband and I loved it. Thanks for the recipe Sue. This ones a keeper!!!!!!!!!

This is really quite good; however, the amounts for the meat are really too small, since the recipe claims to feed 5 (what? Canaries?).  I doubled the amount of chicken breast meat.  Even so, the mixture fills a 13x9 pan only rather shallowly.  All in all, (with the change), it's a nice, easy supper.

My family all ate seconds of this dish, so I guess that means it's good!  The only complaint was that the chips were soggy, so next time I will put the chips on after all  the baking time is done.  I used more salsa than it called for, maybe that's why the chips got soggy.  Over all this is a good recipe.

I added a whole package of taco seasoning to some shredded chicken I had on hand.  I added 1/3 C chopped onion and 4 cloves minced garlic to the chicken.  I upped the salsa to 1 cup.  I mixed 2 C of crushed tortilla chips to the mixture and put it in a 9 X 13 pan.  I topped it with the cheese.  This was great.  No one complained about the black beans.  I will be making this again and again.

Awesome recipe! I think it would be great
if I put a can of refried beans in it to thicken it up. My whole family enjoyed it, thank you!

This is good. I recommend putting it into a warm tortilla and serving almost like a burrito. I put sour cream on it as well, but I usually add sour cream to Mexican dishes!

Original recipe needs to be tweeked. I added garlic, onion powder and 1 cup rice like someone suggested. I also added about a 1/2 cup sour cream in mixture. Maybe even 3/4 of a cup. It added a lot of flavor and creaminess. This was a great recipe to start with.

This casserole was very good, and Oh so simple! I think next time I might add a little more salsa. I think it would be good with some onion and green pepper added as well. All in all, it's a keeper!

I used ground round instead of chicken.  It was good, but I think it needed something else.  It was a little plain.  I topped mine with sour cream and it was good.  I would probably only make it again as a last minute supper. It might also be good if you use it as a dip maybe.

This was a really yummy dish but more like a dip than a casserole. I did not crush the chips so that we could eat it like a dip.

This was ok.  I took the advice of other reviews and sauteed some onion in the oil before adding the chicken.  I also used a whole packet of taco mix.  I on;t had about 1/4 cup of salsa so I added some taco sauce and some extra water to prevent drying while simmering.  I also put a layer of crushed chips on the bottom of a round casserole dish in the hope that it would stay together a bit better.  It really didn't, but I liked the added crunch.  Anyway, we ended up eating the "casserole" rolled up on whole wheat flour tortillas.  The flavor was ok, I just always find black beans too firm unless they are really cooked a long time.  The best thing about this recipe is that it is quick and fairly healthy.

I added 2 c. of cheese as 1 c. wasn't enough for our liking.  Quite easy to make.  My 10 yr old daughter said "gross" when she heard and saw what we were having for dinner.  She ate 3 helpings!  Our family ate all of it in one sitting except for ~1 c.  Definitely a keeper!  Thank you, Sue.

This recipe is super easy to make and tastes great! However, I was a little disappointed that it did not actually turn out like the consistency of a typical casserole. Instead, we ended up eating as a taco salad and really enjoyed it :)

I didn't have black beans, so I used pinto. I put diced chiles in it. I also added a bag of Uncle Bens 90 second Spanish rice while it was simmering. It was an entire meal.

This was an awesome, quick dinner. A big improvement over the tacos we usually eat when we don't feel like cooking. I took the advice of someone and had spanish rice on the side, a perfect addition. My boyfriend would've added sour cream and guacamole (i'm not a fan of those). Yummy, thanks!

Yummy and easy.  It smelled delicious while baking.  I couldn't wait to eat it!  I forgot to buy salsa, so I mixed up a can of tomato sauce with a small can of hot jalepeno peppers and some chopped onion and used that.  My husband and I both liked this.

This is a great recipe! I also altered it a bit. I ground up the salsa and used almost a full cup. I also cooked the chicken with the Taco seasoning. I only cooked it until the cheese was all melted (about 10 minutes)and it turned out great! My boyfriend couldn't stop eating it.

My husband commented, while we were eating, that this meal was "unremarkable". As a casserole meal-in-one, I wouldn't recommend it. To make it less dry, I doubled the salsa and added quite a bit of water. It was still quite dry. We put it on top of rice, but it still didn't feel like much of a satisfying meal. It tasted good, though, and would probably make a good hot dip for taco chips at a gathering - minus the topping of crunched up chips!

This was VERY yummy, and even satisfied my 4 year old.  He was thrilled to help me make it, breaking up the chips and layering the items.  We aren't big fans of blackbeans, so I used regular, Bush's baked beans, but I would recommend if you do that, then add ALL the taco seasoning packet, mine was a little bland, so I threw a dollop of salsa on top for me and my husband, my son was fine with it the way it was!  Thanks for the very easy and quick recipe!

I doubled the salsa and added quite a bit of water but it was dry. Next time I think we will bake with just cheese and add the tortilla chips after. Corn chips might be good to try. I added a can of ortega green chilies and used the hot taco seasoning packet. Good flavor but just too dry.

I liked this!  It was simple and fast.  I used some leftover baked chicken.  I did use a little more salsa as others suggested and even a little  chili powder because I like it spicy.  My daughter and daughter in-law liked it as well.

I thought this was very delicious,although I doubled the salsa and added 2 small cans of green chili and 1 diced jalapeno.I also used shredded chicken and let all the ingredents simmer for longer than 10 min.When I baked it I layered it like a lasagna instead of putting it all on the bottom.My family really liked it.Thanks

I, like others, found this dry even with the addition of water and double the salsa.  I like the suggestion someone made of adding enchilada sauce or queso cheese sauce.  Good recipe with some experimentation -- thanks Sue!

This was an excellent dinner! I omitted the taco seasoning and doubled up on the salsa, and I used frozen sweet corn instead of canned. Needless to say, it turned out superb! We'll definately make this again and again!

I put the mixture in tortillas and baked in oven, it was good but a little dry. Next time I would add a cheese or enchilada sauce to the recipe.

The taste in general is great but the casserole is dry despite adding more water. I think next time I will double the salsa as someone else suggested. Not my favorite but worth trying again with a little tweaking.

Very good - even the 5 yr. old grandson liked it!  I think next time I'll shred the chicken breast instead of cutting it into chunks.  Top with sour cream and guacamole - yum!

This recipe is AWESOME!!  I am such a picky eater and generally can't find things to make that I'll like, this one was fabulous!  I used a 15 oz can of fiesta corn and the whole jar of salsa, it was great!  My hubby can't wait to eat it again!

This was really good.  I was looking for a quick recipe for chicken with ingredients I had on hand.  I didn't have taco seasoning so I used fajita seasoning and I didn't have any tortilla chips so I used nacho cheese flavored chips.  It turned out great.  My husband said he wants this again!  Can't wait to try it will all the "right" ingredients.  Thanks for the great recipe Sue!

This is easy to make and SO good!!  My husband LOVES it and we now have it at least once a week.  He likes to put it in tortillas with some sour cream.  I use the whole package of taco seasoning, 1/2 cup salsa, and use a regular sized can of corn.  I also mix the cheese and tortilla chips into the casserole.  It is really yummy!!  One of our favorites!

WONDERFUL! I made this on a week night while over at my fiance's, who is pretty picky, and eats alot of chicken. He really enjoyed it. I doubled the chicken, salsa, taco seasoning, and cheese. Took the suggestion of sauting onion and topping with sour cream. I also reduced the sweet corn to 1/2. He was excited there was enough for left-overs for him another meal or two. I will definitely make this recipe again, not only for us but for guests also.

Tasty and so easy!  I ended up using a 15 oz can of corn, which was fine, and probably double the salsa.   My husband loved this casserole, he wanted to eat the whole pan!  I'm sure I'll be making it often.

Awesome receipe!!!  It doesn't look as good as it tastes.  I used a whole 15.25oz can of corn instead of the 8.75.  When I took it out of the oven I also topped it off with sour cream.  Taste just like a nacho supreme.  I don't normally write reviews even when they are good but I thought this really deserved it being that it was super easy and very quick to prepare and taste soooo good.

This was good, it seemed like a few too many chips on top though. Next time I may double the chicken/bean mixture. I think you could easily substitute ground beef for the chicken too. It was tasty though, and even reheated well.

This was very good. My husband and I were quite pleased! So easy for a weeknight meal. Next time I might stir the chips in a bit. The basic ckn/bn/corn mixture has so many more possibilities...tacos, burritos, nachos. Yum! Yum! Thanks for sharing!

Very good--nice to find a recipe that is not based on carbs...as you can leave out the chips if desired.  I do like to add sauteed onion & bell pepper, & if I'm in a hurry, I find that a roasted deli chicken pulled apart is excellent in this casserole.  Thanks for sharing!

My 10 year old daughter is really getting into cooking this summer and we had this tonight.  It was very easy to prepare and she needed little assistance from me other than the sauteed chicken.  Yummy.  She was so proud!  Thanks for the nice quick recipe.

pretty good. needs something. maybe sour cream mixed in or cheese mixed in to make a more moist texture. used kidney beans instead of black (personal preference). very good filling for burritos with some melted cheese dip inside. will make again.

I thought it was awesome, but a little dry. I added some extra cheese to it to make it a little easier to take down. As much as my fiance' and I loved it, my 4-year-old wouldn't touch it.

I thought this was pretty good, not great, but my kids wouldn't touch it. They tried it, but didn't like it at all.

I just loved this one, even my son liked it and he is pretty picky. Made it after an afternoon of skating outside with friends. It was quick and very easy to make. It's a new favorite.

I thought this recipe was ok & my husband said it was a keeper.  My two young kids tasted it & pushed it away. It needs something more but I will make it again only when my kids are staying with grandma.

After reading all the great reviews on this recipe, I was quite disappointed. It wasn't real bad but it wasn't great either. My husband and I ate one serving. The kids wouldn't eat it, and I am not sure if the left overs will be eaten or not. I am very fond of mexican food but just care for this one much.

My husband really enjoyed this. It has the right combination of everything. Very quick ( especially if you pre-cook chicken in big batches) and easy, along with good tasting. You can't get much better than this recipe.

This is soooo good! I made it with Louis Rich Southwestern Carving Board fully cooked chicken. This saves time and adds some extra zip. Spicy but my family loves spicy flavors. A little to spicy for small children.
