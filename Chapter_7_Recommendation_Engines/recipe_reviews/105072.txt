We all LOVED this ~ absolutely delicious! If you use frozen fruit juice concentrate (as recipe indicates), it will be too sweet, guaranteed ~ as some reviewers found out. Instead, use Goya brand "Frutta - 100% Pure Passion Fruit Pulp", which is a puree with no sugar or water added. The flat plastic bags of "Frutta" can be found in the freezer section of possibly your regular grocer's, & definitely at Hispanic & Asian stores. At a regular grocer look in the freezer with Hispanic or Asian foods, & where frozen juices & fruits are located. ~~~ I highly recommend this to anyone. It is also super simple: 3 ingredients, 1 to 1-1/2 minutes of blending, 30 mins. of refrigeration (for a slightly firmer texture). Amazingly, a serving size in an espresso cup satisfies as nicely as a larger serving in a ramekin. This may very well become your go-to recipe for summertime, for a creamy~dreamy ending to a tropical meal, for special occasions ~ or more often!

For those of you who say it's too sweet...I did not realize that the frozen concentrate juice has sugar (it might have other juices, too?). I listed the concentrate juice as I figured that is the main or only way some of you could get passion fruit juice! The BEST  THING TO USE IS THE JUICE FROM THE FRUIT ITSELF, such as we do here in Brazil. Then it will not be so sweet because passionfruit is a very tart fruit, almost like lemon! That is why this recipe also works well with lemon or lime juice. So, certainly, if you use the frozen concentrate...lessen the amount of sweetened cond. milk, but I'm not sure how it will turn out, because then there will be less cream. *By the way, this makes a marvelous ice cream. Just put it in the freezer instead of in the refrigerator-you don't even have to beat it again later. Yummo! *Another option is to use "light" cream and "light" sw. condensed milk.

The recipe was really easy but the mousse was WAY TOO sweet.  Is was a good flavor but I could only have three bites before I had to put down my spoon (and I have a big sweet tooth).  It also was more of a pudding texture then as light and fluffy as a mousse should be.  The adventurous cook could probably make this better...but as it stands it is only ok.

I LOVED this dessert! I used 100% pure passion fruit puree and found the final result to be just sweet enough and wonderfully tangy (if frozen passion fruit concentrate has sugar added, I think it would be too sweet). Such a simple recipe and I received rave reviews from the taste-testers. It will definitely be a "go-to" recipe for dinner parties. I want to try it with lemon or lime next time.

Want to impress family and friends? Serve this inside the hull of the fruit. Just cut off top of fruit, fill and chill. Perfect serving size too.

Super Super Easy and your friends will think you spent hours. Its worth it to get the passionfruit pulp (Goya is the brand I use). I used 1/2 the amount of the sweetened condensed milk (plus a few spoons) and it was tangy and sweet the way maracuja is served in south america. Loved it!

I made this recipe exactly as stated. It sounded very good in theory, and it was incredibly easy. But it really is so very sickeningly sweet that I couldn't eat it. I tried using some fresh blueberries - their tartness helped a tiny bit, but I could only eat a few mouthfuls. The puree, or pulp, that people are substituting isn't available in my area, but then that's not what the recipe calls for.

I found this extremely easy to make. The flavor of passion fruit is very similar to guava. I almost liked it but not enough to make it again. Sorry. I guess I don't like passion fruit.

I would for sure use the frozen fruit puree. With the juice concentrate it tasted like nothing but sweetened condensed milk and was waaaaaay overly sweet! I used pineapple orange concentrate since I could not find passion fruit juice or any type of frozen puree. I have hiiiiiggggghhhh hopes this will turn out with the frozen fruit rather than the juice but as written we just did not enjoy it.

I used one 14oz pkg of Goya Passion Fruit puree (unsweetened), one 14oz can (1 1/2 cups) of sweetened condensed milk and 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream. I didn't want to have any left over puree or condensed milk. It still could've been a tiny bit tarter for my taste, but it was still delicious. It would've been WAY too sweet with sweetened fruit juice concentrate. Glad to have the basic recipe to work off of. Would not have thought of using condensed milk.

Delicious.  Be cautious using frozen juice concentrates,  as many have added sugar already, especially lemon or lime.  If a frozen juice concentrate doesn't add sugar,  it's still going to be too sweet for this recipe.  If, however, the concentrate indicates that you need to add sugar to it,  it will work well with this recipe and be delicious!
There are a few different brands of passion fruit that you can get.  Whichever you choose,   make sure it doesn't already have sugar in it, or drastically reduce the amount of sweetened condensed milk you use.

Something else to try,  after making the mousse, freeze it.  It makes an absolutely decadent ice cream!

Very easy and tasty dessert.  I used homemade unsweetened passion fruit puree and it was still too sweet for my taste.  Will experiment with the quantities of sweetened condensed milk and cream to come up with a less sweet version.

By using non-fat sweetened condensed milk and unsweetened passion fruit puree the Weight Watcher's Points Plus for this recipe is only 4 points for a 1/4 cup serving.  Considering the sweetness of this dessert 1/4 cup is a perfect portion size.

Just make sure the juice is unsweetened, it's one of my favorite desserts of all time - I usually just make it with the juice of one fruit.

I usually make deserts several times before I leave feedback to be sure. I don’t know why some people didn’t like it. My husband and I love to go to Brazilian steakhouse restaurant, it’s a high end place and not cheap, but we can’t help ourselves, we love it somuch. Especially passion fruit mousse. We kept asking waiters to share the recipe with us, but they only smiled and said it was a secret. So, I made it my mission to find it online. Before I bumped into this one, I made at least 5 from different websites and none of them tasted like the one we love. This was my final attempt and we LOVED it. My husband is so spoiled and picky, plus an amazing cook himself, said ‘this is it!’ and we knew we had a winner. Not everything needs to be complicated to be tasty. This is exactly how it tastes in our favorite Brazilian steakhouse where a Chef himself is from Brazil. The only thing I did different, i added shaved semi-sweet chocolate on top of each dish (not mix it but cover it as top layer) and I added 1 extra table spoon of passion fruit juice to get that distinctive taste. I use concentrated juice I buy on Amazon. After 5-8 hours in the fridge it’s ready to go. My husband took 10 ramekins to his office and all of his colleagues and business partners licked those dishes like there was no tomorrow.  And since they all live here in Dallas too and ate at several Brazilian steakhouses, everyone of them said ‘it tastes just like the one I had at the restaurant!’ and that was another
