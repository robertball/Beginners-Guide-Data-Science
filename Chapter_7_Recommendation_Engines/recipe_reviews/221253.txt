I was looking for a recipe to use up some zucchini and spinach I had in the refigerator. This is a good starter but I agree with LindaT's comment about blandness.  Perhaps the original recipe was designed to be low fat, low sodium but it doesn't have to be nearly so bland.  Second time I made it I sauteed the onions and zucchini in a little canola oil and substituted vegetable broth for the water (about one inch over the tops of the vegetables).  I skipped the soy sauce as I find its flavor overpowered the mild veggies and substituted rice wine vinegar for a little acid. I added salt, cumin, basil and some red pepper flakes for more spice.  A much more flavorful version was the result in my opinion.

I liked the idea of zucchini and spinach, but this is a very bland soup as is.. plan on needing to add some spices, in my opinion. I wasn't able to find enoki mushrooms so I used a few oyster mushrooms

I heavily modified this to get a little more flavor and loved it! I added chicken broth instead of water and asparagus instead of potatoes. As well some roasted red pepper spices,garlic, and seasoning salt. Then grilled and chopped up a salmon burger and threw it in. So hearty! loved it!
