Came across this recipe last night and made it today.  The only change I made was to make in my bread maker instead of a food processor. Place (in this order) the water, oil, salt, both types of sugar in the pan  and top with all of the flour (don't forget the 4 tsp in the top list) and the oatmeal on top and place the yeast in last (I used 4 tsp) and process it on dough cycle.  Shape into 2 loaves, let rise about 45 minutes and bake in greased 4 x 8 pans at 350F for 30 minutes.  I actually used 2 identical bread makers and made a batch in each one simultaneously,  divided into 3 equal amounts (by weight) and put them into 3 ( 9 x 5) pans and baked them for 35 minutes.  Best bread I've ever made and I do not ever buy bread

Turned out great! I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour. Mine also took longer to rise, about 75 minutes. Will definitely make again! Thanks for sharing!

This bread is fabulous! I cannot stop eating it. It was very easy to whip up on the food processor. My first rise took an hour and my second rise took a couple of hours. I just left it in a warm oven and forgot about it. The crust is fabulous! I've had one slice with orange marmalade and one piece with a slice of cheese.

Wonderful bread! Good texture with a nice light crust.  I made it in my bread maker on the dough cycle then divided into 4 long sandwich shop style loaves. I baked them on greased cookie sheets for about half an hour. Kids never wanted sandwiches at home because we didn't have the 'right bread'.  I will be making this on a regular basis, thanks!

So easy, and tastes good, too.  I was glad to find a recipe that didn't involve a bread maker or a lot of kneading.  This turned out great, dispite the fact that I used all purpose flour rather than bread flour.

Insanely easy to make and absolutely delicious.  I made it yesterday and 1 loaf was gone at dinner time and the other we saved for breakfast.

Recently bought a Kitchenaid F/P and thought I would give this recipe a try. F/P handled the ingredients without a problem and had a good looking dough in a few minutes. Both rises were very good and baked according to recipe. Excellent results, moist firm crumb and a very nice crust. Only adjustment was to cut bake time by 2 minutes on my 2nd and 3rd batches. This bread seems to keep better than most that I make.

This was really a great recipe.....soft, hearty bread with a perfect crust.  This was my very first time making a yeast bread and it turned out to be delicious and easy to do!  Mine took about 2 1/2 hours to rise in the pan, instead of just 1 hour. 

I love the hint of sweetness from the oats and brown sugar.  Mmmm!  One of my loafs was perfect, the other didn't rise as much but, I am new at this.  Will definitely make this again! Soon!!

Unfortunately, this didnâ€™t work out for me.  I made half the recipe for one loaf so it would fit in my food processor.  I noticed in the reviews, several bakers had problems with the second rise.   The first rise was great, and was not over-risen, however it rose very little the second time.  This may be because I cut the recipe in half, although I do that often and have no issues.   I finally gave up on the second rise after two hours because I had planned on serving the bread with dinner and hoped it would rise a little during baking.  The flavor was ok, but just eh for me.  This was my most disappointing bread recipe to date.

This is really a wonderful bread. I made it yesterday for the first time. I have been making bread by hand for years, but never liked the kneading process, and I don't yet have a breadmaker. I have a small food processor, so I made it in two batches and it worked well. I am hoping the motor of my food processor holds up to make many more loaves of this!

I mixed and let this rise in the bread machine, according to mfgr. instructions (liquids in bottom, then dry ingredients, yeast last), then placed in greased loaf pans to rise and bake in a regular oven.  I was very pleased with the results.  It made a nice looking loaf of soft wheat bread, as opposed to the denser texture that one often gets with whole wheat.  I did find that I needed a little less flour (1/4 - 1/2 cup less) than the recipe stated, perhaps because I used old fashioned oats, rather than quick cooking.  The recipe was perfect, as far as sweetness goes.

I'd definitely make this again.  Next time, I am going to substitute 1/2 cup of the whole wheat flour with 7 grain cereal.

First of all this is very easy and not a lot of mess to make. It is delicious as well. You need a HUGE food processor. I thought my Ninja was big but turns out it's not! I had to dig out my Bosch bread mixer and it worked just fine. I will definately make this again!! I did use spelt flour instead of whole wheat. 30 minutes was long enough maybe a tad too long??

Made the dough in the bread machine, and baked it in the oven, at least three times this week.  It's excellent, thank you for sharing :)

I have made this bread twice and it has become my "go to" bread recipe .  It comes out with a slightly dense crumb, and the oats and whole wheat give it the substance and character one enjoys in home made bread.

I have used bread flour and quick rise yeast, and have not had a problem with "slow rise" that others have reported.  My understanding is that bread flour has more protein, and therefore would rise more quickly. ( more protein=more gluten and therefore more strands for the yeast to act on). It may also be that the whole wheat and oats are inhibiting the rise by severing the developing gluten strands. So I would suggest, if you use all purpose flour, think about increasing the yeast and slightly decreasing the whole wheat

I have tried this recipe now 3 times.  It was recommended by a friend. First, there is a discrepancy in the recipe.  3 1/3 c flour or 3 1/2.  The rising time is also an issue.  Maybe there's a better version of this type of recipe!  It has turned out flat/not risen every time!

Yummy.  Recipe was too big for my food processor.  Ended up dumping the whole thing into the bread maker: first the yeast mixture, then the brown sugar/salt/oil, and last the flour and oatmeal.  Mixed on dough setting, then rolled out and baked in oven.  Easy and delicious.  Made twice in three days because it disappeared so fast.

Really is a great bread.  Baked it in my sun (solar) oven at 11:30 - done at 12:15 - and it came out perfectly.  Brushed the top with a bit of butter to brown, and added 2 Tbs gluten (we live at 5K ft and always add gluten to yeast bread).

Tasted great. Did not rise as much as I would have liked. Used new ingredients. Not sure what happened. Was easy and the first time I have made bread. Will make again.
