Love these!  They taste just like the ones you get at restaurants.  I used pickle slices rather than spears because they make crunchier fried pickles and they're easier to eat.  When you make the slices there is a lot of the bread crumb coating left over, so it might be a good idea to reduce that part of the recipe.  Also, it seemed like there was an awfully lot of milk added to one egg.  Less than a cup of milk would probably suffice.  I'm going to try these changes next time.  I served them with thousand island and it was great!  I like ranch, too!

I LOVE deep fried Pickles and was so excited to try this with my husband.  I love th recipe except that the breading on my pickles came off some of them in the oil and also slid off when we picked up the pickles :(  My oil may not have been right but who knows... I think i will try this awesome beer batter recipe I found on this site to make fish tacos.  I would have given it 5 stars if my breading hadnt of fallen off.

i did a trial run and only had some plain bread crumbs and added some Italian seasoning and pepper, garlic powder and cayeene, I used one egg and a little bit of milk, used sliced pickles. It was tasty I think I am going to play around with the seasonings!

This recipe doesn't work.  There is waaaaaay too much milk.  A dash of milk at most is all that is needed.  The breading all fell off the pickles.

I've never had fried pickles before so I gave it a try. I reduced the amount of milk so the breading would stick better. It was okay, I didn't care for the italian seasoning. I felt like it was too much. It might have been better with bread-n-butter pickles. I'll have to try it next time.

These were fantastic.  We used baby pickles, so we didn't have to cut them at all.  Going to make them again tonight at a fish fry.

These were good, and if you wait for them to cool down a little the breading sticks on better. I also didn't put them in the freezer, I just coated them in the breading and put them right into the fryer - it worked fine!

Other reviewers are correct.  Too much milk in this recipe.  Made with less milk and turned out great.

The coating is awful. Instead I used 1/2 cup milk, one egg and then around 1/4 cup flour so the pickles would stick to the bread crumbs. With this batter I also did not have to double coat it and I did not let them sit I just dunked them into the oil. Turned out delicious in the end with these changes.

love this recipe !!! but way to much milk .. the first couple pickles gets nice and coated & cooks perfect in deep fryer , but once you start coating the other half they start falling apart and the breadcrumbs gets chunky , i recommend putting half of the bread crumbs in one bowl and use that for half of the batch then discarding the remains then use the other half  of breadcrumbs for the remaining pickles :) so gooood !!!!

Taste was good, breaking was crunchy, but it ALL fell off the pickles! The second dip in the milk/egg just washed the bread crumbs off from the first dip. Super frustrating, and once deep fried, we had pickles and pickle shaped bits of deep fried breadcrumbs - hey didn't stay together. Won't make these again.

The breading fell off all the pickles. Instead of milk, perhaps only eggs or a full-blown batter should be done.

these were ok, the batter didn't stick on as good as I wished they had. Probably my own error but the batter was good despite this.
