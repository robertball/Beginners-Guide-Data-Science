I tried six recipes from this site and this was my least favorite.  Not enough flavor.  Very bland.  Maybe with some basil it might have some punch to it.

sarita166-I'd like to know what you tired, and what you liked. Its hard to imagine that this had no flavor..between the parm, olives, and jalapeno? Your palet must be unique. Thanks for trying it, that means a lot!

This is a customized version. sorry not in right place. 
I sauteed a large minced onion with garlic, salt and pepper. then  Processed parsley nuts fine and some olive oil
Added thin to pan. cooked alittle added fresh lemon juice. Adjusted flavor. 
don't remember if added something else. recipe not in front of me now. 
But added some capers. 
Can add little broth instead of so much oil. But this will change flavor. I variete 
One person in my family does not like parm. cheese so i now seperated some. and add  parm. cheese. 
I sometimes add marinated dried tomatoesin oil  to it. and serve it over pasta. 
Parsley healthy and we like this. 
I sometimes add more fresh sauteed garlic to it though. and adjust lemon. adjust salt and fresh pepper.

I made this today and omitted the jalapeno and substituted slivered almonds (budget reasons). It was amazing! I'll harvest the rest of my parsley and freeze it in containers. With the almonds the color was gorgeous. Thank you to Soup Lover-Sue

I kept adding more of this and that but it just never tasted very good. Also kind of a bad color.

I did not use olives, added corn instead.
