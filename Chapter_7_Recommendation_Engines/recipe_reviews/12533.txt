Very easy to make.  Very healthy and low fat.  the only negative is that it definently tastes low fat.

i started making this pie and quickly realized that someone had put onion soup mix in our sour cream, so i substituted strawberry yogurt.  since it turned out great, next time (will definately make it again) i'll probably use yogurt even if we do have sour  cream.  we topped the pie with whipped cream.  the only problem with the recipe was the dough was very sticky and it took a long time to get spread over the pan because it stuck to my fingers even with flour.  it was worth the effort because it was absolutely delicious. thanks for a great recipe!

I thought this was a great sweet snack.  I love that it is low fat.  I used peaches and raspberries and I used frozen fruit.  It tasted a lot like a cobbler with out all the fattening ingredients.

Wow! I loved this pie. My husband who doesnt really like custard also enjoyed this pie. I cannot tell this is low fat at all. The crust is not my favorite but still a winner!

Absolutely love this, quick and easy, made it twice in 2 wks! I'm an absolute novice, so I admit I used a pre-made crust and added the lemon zest to the custard mixture. I bought frozen berries: raspberry, blueberry, blackberry variety and defrosted them, drained excess liquid. Everyone loved it, served best with whipped cream topping of course!

Very simple recipe that my 11 year old made. He used a graham cracker crust and that may have been some of the difference as there seemed to be something missing flavor-wise. The custard was nice but next time we may try a traditional egg custard and see what happens. Will make it again just because our family loves berries and we need new ways to use them.

This was really lovely.  I used a graham cracker crust because it was easier for my toddler to help make.  I also used frozen berries.   The custard browned beautifully.  I did add some corn starch to the berries and they set up perfectly.  A few berries bubbled through to the top of the custard, giving it a lovely colorful top.

Like Nalova, I found the dough mix to be quite sticky.  You may want to keep the cooking spray handy so you can apply to your hands as needed for easier spreading.  Or maybe add a little more baking mix to the dough mixture.  It was well worth the effort -- it's a hit!

I used regular sour cream and whole eggs and it turned out great.  The crust was a little cake like and the presenation wasn't pretty but it made up in taste.

I was pleasantly surprised by this dessert... reminiscent of a clafouti, although much lighter, of course.  The dough for the crust is SUPER-sticky, but it will eventually spread and form a crust.  I used blackberries, but will try this recipe with raspberries and/or peaches next time.  Thanks for a 'berry' delicious dessert!

I was looking for a recipe to use up the raspberries and blackberries I had on hand and this fit the bill perfectly.  Very easy to make.  I only had low-fat sour cream, doubt it made much difference in the overall taste.  Next time, I may try low-fat vanilla yogurt in its place.  Even my picky teenager was highly complimentary of this pie.  Be patient with the crust - it is very sticky and hard to work with but will fit the pie pan with a little patience.  Thanks for a great summer recipe, Lea!

I liked this better than my boys & hubby. I am a lover of creamy-type desserts. My husband is more of a purist and I think the custard detracted from his berries! Because I bake for them mostly, I probably won't keep this recipe.

Simple and good. I have made this a few times and always really liked it. You can vary the types of berries used.

I didn't make the crust, but the pie is wonderful.  I did make a couple of minor changes.  I did not add any of the spices.  I used only raspberries (no blackberries).  With those minor changes, this is the best raspberry pie I've ever tasted!

I tried this recipe instead of a mixed berry cobbler, and wish I'd sticked with a cobbler. It was cake-ey rather than like a pie or a tart. With fresh ingredients, it was still a decent dessert served with vanilla ice cream and fresh whipped cream, but I wouldn't make it again.
