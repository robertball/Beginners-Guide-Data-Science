Personally I felt this salad was too oily.  I will make it again, but will cut the olive oil in half.  I also won't drizzle the noodles with a little oil.

I thought the premise was good but it needs more flavor. I added 3 cloves of finely minced garlic and 1/4 cup fresh oregano to the mixture.  I also refrigerated the mixture overnight so the flavors could meld and added it to the elbows veggies and cheese.  We enjoyed this for Sunday brunch. Thanks, Barilla.       8/5/14.  My 4yo aspiring foodie has been demanding this for lunch, but it must be made with the the White Fiber Mini shells.

i made this as directed.  It was a little bland for our tastes, so the second time I made this, I added some balsamic vinegar.  I used about a third of a cup.  I also added 1/2 teas of cayenne pepper to the dressing.  We like things hot as we are both a couple of chili heads.

My husband loved it, but I thought it was bland.  I'll make make it again, but I'll have to add some spices.

We loved it!  Used basil olive oil and only in the mixture.  More oil on the pasta would be too much.

Made this for a pot luck at work for labor day - family eat it right up.  Had to make another batch for work.  I used the high fiber shell pasta.  Using what I have in the pantry.

This turned out great.  The only thing I changed was to toss with olive oil and added a beef summer sausage.
