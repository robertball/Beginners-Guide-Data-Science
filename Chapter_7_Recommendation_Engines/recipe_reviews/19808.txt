Wow!  BEST Vanilla Ice Cream I've EVER had!  But then instead of using vanilla extract, I used THREE vanilla beans!
My husband does NOT like vanilla Ice Cream but he RAVED over this one and wanted more!

I cut this recipe in half using 3 eggs, 3 cans evaporated whole milk, 1 whole can whole milk sweetened condensed milk, 1 cup sugar, 1 T. vanilla for more vanilla flavor, and 1/2 whole milk. It was amazingly creamy and had the best consistency frozen. Not too hard. My husband said it was the best of the 3 recipes I tried. A definite keeper!

I made this in my kitchenaid ice cream maker attachment.  I'm not sure if it was the recipe or if  it's just me, but in order for this to actually become ice cream, I had to make sure the mixture was almost frozen before I even put it in the ice cream maker (which had been sitting in my freezer for at least 24 hours before I used it).  After churning for about 20 minutes, it started to look like ice cream.  Then about 5 minutes later, it was back to looking like melty soft serve.  

So, after lots of re-freezing and re-churning, I finally had my ice cream.  It was okay, kind of rich, but I will try and add more vanilla next time since the freezing process really takes that away...

Also, this recipe freezes well.  It doesn't turn into a brick, either.  It just likes to stay kind of soft.

Very good and easy too!  I used egg substitute instead, as I have two small children, and it turned out great!

My third grade class cooks each month.  This recipe is easy to make with kids.  It's so sweet that it didn't even need all of the toppings we had.

This was very good.  I followed another cook's advice and reduced the recipe.  My version was three eggs, 2 cans of evaporated milk, 1 cup of heavy whipping cream, one full tablespoon of vanilla, 1/2 cup of sugar, and 3/4 cup of sweetened condensed milk.  Still came out excellent!  Next time I might try  a real vanilla bean or two.

Very yummy!  I did put all ingred in a large pot and used a hand blendr to mix smooth then cooked to a boil before chilling for 24 hours before making ice cream.  Made 1/2 recipe and it was still more than my kitchen aid could make so added a little cocoa to the 2nd batch!!!! Yummy!!! Tasted like Wendy frosty and this ice cream doesn't freeze so hard you can't serve! This is r new favorite of the whole house.  A scoop of vanilla and chocolate please.  :)

Best stuff I have ever made!!!  Used less sugar and heavy cream and Half & Half instead of evaporated and whole milk.  Texture was super creamy.  I made Vanilla and Strawberry. Chocolate is next!!!

We were looking for a recipe that did not take heavy cream.  This recipe was rich, creamy and delicious.  We halved the recipe to be sure we would like it and although it does not freeze extremely hard, it was great!

I was making chocolate ice cream and I accidentally grabbed the almond extract instead of the vanilla.  Chocolate Almond Ice Cream is yummy!

So good! Next time Iâ€™m going to try substitutions to make it healthier. My ideas are replace sugar with stevia, replace half milk with coconut milk
