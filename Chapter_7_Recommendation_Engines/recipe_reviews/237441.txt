Wanted to clarify about adding the water. You add the water after you add the chicken, carrots, potatoes and seasonings to the oil and curry mixture. You add it gradually as the mixture thickens. You can add more or less water as needed.

This tastes just like the curry chicken my mom's friend from St. Kitts used to make when I was young. As this is the exact taste I was going for, and I've never made curried chicken before, I'm giving the recipe 5 stars. The only problem I ran into is that the recipe doesn't mention when to add the water. I did so about half way through step 2 when I realized the error.

Super tasty! I would have given five stars but I made a few tweaks and it was also a bit too salty. Still highly edible but next time I will reduce the salt by 1/2 tsp.

For substitutions I replaced powdered garlic and onion with fresh. And replaced the chille pepper with a splash of cayene pepper. The fresh ginger root with 1/2 tap of dried.

I threw in approx two cups of baby potatoes and a handful of baby carrots.

I'll definetly make this recipe again!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe!! I've actually made your recipe and fell head over heels in love with it!! Making it for my dad today.. He moved in with me about a week ago, and has never had curry chicken before.. He loves spicy foods, so I'm sure he's gonna love it as well.. I followed the instructions to a tee, but I also added onions and red and green bell peppers to it.. This is gonna be SO AWESOME!! Thanks for an excellent recipe!!

Just made this eating as I write this. came out great. I used to make this dish that I learned from my Jamaican friend and have also eaten this many times in Jamaica. I would suggest buying the Blue Mountain Jamaican curry powder. I purchased mine from Amazon. Also I only did 1tb of salt rather than an additional salt seasoning and net time I will go half on the garlic powder . as it does taste a little salty. Made mine without the chile pepper bc I couldn't get to the store. And brown rice on the side. also u could do all water instead of oil if you want something more diet refined.

This was a good recipe. My husband enjoyed it. I added 1 cup of water, 1 cup of coconut milk and 1 cup of chicken broth instead of 3 cups of water. I made rice and steamed cabbage for the sides.

This is my boyfriends absolute favorite dish that I make for him. Whenever he's mad at me, or down and out, I bring him some and he instantly becomes happy haha. 

One thing that I did differently last time was that I used 1 cup of water with 1 cup of chicken broth to add with the mixture and it came out much more flavorful. I think I'll be doing this from now on. 

Serve on a bed of white rice and some cornbread and you'll have a very happy tummy.

What a great recipe! Thought we could reduce the salt, but it really needs it. Add a little tumeric for health too!

This is as authentic as it gets! I used half a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of cayenne.  Used boneless breast and removed it from the stew after 30 minutes, cut it up and put it back in the pot for the last 5 minutes. Very tasty. This was a big hit for dinner!!

Great recipe, very similar to my own. I have a few differences! Soy sauce, sweet potato and a homemade stock. My secret ingredient is black rum added before serving and cinnamon. 

I also let it cook for half a day in a slow cooker though I have tried this method with success too. Just be sure when using a slow cooker that you don't cook out the chili/peppers.

My kids went crazy over the dish, so great to see their smiles.  Thanks to all of the comments, I tweak a few ingredients as well - reduce the salt and added a tiny bit of flour to thicken the sauce.  When to add the water was puzzling but seemed right to throw it in before adding the potatoes, carrots. I would do 2 cups of water.  Great and east recipe.

This was a great recipe!!  I omitted the potatoes just out of personal preference & substituted the onion powder for fresh onion. I'll use just 1 tablespoon of seasoning salt next time as it came out a little salty but overall the dish was really good!

Easy to make and very tasty!  I let the chicken absorb their spices for 3 hours. The recipe fails to mention when to add the water. I added it with the potatoes, carrots, etc I may use boiling water next time (saw it in another recipe). I had this with rice  and it's awesome! Enjoy.

I have made this twice so far and the family has loved it each time. I make the dish in my stovetop dutch oven (highly recommended). I replaced the water with a can of coconut milk (12 or 13oz can) and 1.5 cups of chicken broth. Like many have already said, if you prefer it thicker you either need to add flour or reduce the liquids. I also used 1 small chopped onion instead of scallions. I added the water about 5 minutes after adding the chicken, just to give the chicken some time to cook in the oil. I added the potatoes after letting the chicken and liquids cook for about 10 minutes because the potatoes (sweet and regular) get extremely soft. Great recipe....winner winner curry chicken dinner!!!!!

This was really great the first time I made it as written! The second time I made a few changes as follows: I substituted 8 bone in, skin off, chicken thighs. I used 2 cups chicken bone broth and 1 cup coconut water in place of water. I did not add any salt. I added 1 tablespoon of Jamaican jerk seasoning and 2 tablespoons of lime juice to the sauce(it needed some acidity to offset the earthiness of all that curry). I used 1 large sweet potato in place of regular potato and 1 1/2 cups of chunked baby carrots. I substituted 1 large, sliced, sweet yellow onion(lightly sauteed) in place of the scallions, as the scallions seemed to disappear in the sauce the first time i made it. I stirred in 8 ounces of plain greek yogurt just before serving, and garnished with chopped cilantro. This is now my new favorite chicken curry recipe!! YUM!!

Boom ting!! this curry is the one.I tweaked the recipe a little by adding some soya sauce with the chicken at the beginning,i also added a piece of  GRACE creamed coconut in with the water and added some ketchup during the simmering process.
I also added some fresh cilantro when the curry was done to funk it up a little.
My family,my brethren dem all love it when i serve this up with a one rice'n' peas.

I love this dish! It has been my favorite since I was a child. Reminds me exactly how my mother used to make it. The only thing I recommend for this recipe is to not add the salt because the seasoned salt is already salty and adding more salt will ruin the dish.

I followed this recipe carefully and my curry  was WAY TOO SALTY. I had to throw out 2.5 lbs of good chicken because it was unsalvageable. I suggest that folks start with 1/2 tsp of seasoned salt then adjust from there.

I found this recipe and love it however I did make a few changes to it....instead of adding water I used 1 can of coconut milk and 12oz's of chicken broth.  I also turned up the heat with the use of Penzey's Hot Curry Spice...the flavor was phenomenal.

Absolutely loved it. Tastes just like the curried chicken my Jamaican friend would make. I did omit the regular salt but kept the seasoned salt as some reviewers thought it was salty with both. I also used the Blue Mountain Jamaican curry powder as another reviewer suggested. This curry powder is very spicy so I did not need the scotch bonnet pepper. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

This was excellent, though I made some changes to accommodate for things I didn't have. 

I did not have fresh tomatoes, so I used a drained can of fire roasted diced tomatoes I had in the pantry. I also didn't have any fresh hot peppers, so I instead used around 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. I also added 1/2 tsp smoked paprika, and subbed coconut milk for water. 
 The end result was absolutely delicious, and will become a regular weeknight dinner in my house. It was very rich and flavorful. We ate it over rice, though honestly it would've been good by itself as well.

This was my first time making this dish, great recipe. I made a few changes out of personal preferences. My family loved it despite that I thought it was a bit on the salty side ??.  I didn’t use carrots, fresh ginger, or bonnet pepper. I used ginger powder and cayenne pepper instead. I will reduce the salt on my next attempt.

This is one of my family’s favorites. I’ve made it 3 times with variations and they have all worked well. Rotisserie chicken is excellent to use because it is already cooked thus the cook time is shortened. It also takes on a bit of the flavor of the chicken. I highly recommend that you try it and enjoy.

Very easy to make and tasty. Actually used boneless breasts cut in chunks which worked out fine, but would definitely add more potatoes and carrots next time

Excellent recipe, much like wat mi ex husband used to make...he's from White Water...only difference he adds 1/4th cup coconut milk and a likkle lime juice. He also showed me to substitute allspice (for us Americans lol) wit a dash of nutmeg, and cumin, the black pepper does its own ting...I substituted scotch bonnet pepper for crushed red pepper...

Absolutely delicious! I didn't really change the recipe much just omitted the carrots and instead added a can of chickpeas aka garbanzo beans, a couple more potatoes and water.

Excellent Recipe! I used chicken thighs (usually 3-4) instead of a whole chicken as they pull apart better. I also set the chicken over-nite in the fridge after step 1 because I wanted to make sure the chicken really absorbed the flavor. I cut down on the salt by half due to wanting less in my meal. Another thing was that I followed several reviewers suggestions and used half chicken broth and half coconut milk instead of water. also did not use fresh ginger as I had none on hand but the recipe still turned out delicious!

To get the negatives out of the way first: hands down, too much salt and water - this is curry chicken, not the freakin' ocean. I even cut salt to only 1 3/4 tsp kosher. Per OP's addendum, I will add water gradually next time and cut salt by at least 1/4. I neglected to divide the curry between 2 steps, instead coating the chicken with most of it, but it tasted awesome. The curry mix really clings on to the chicken. Did not have thyme but rather added cilantro at the end; even without cilantro the dish tasted v. aromatic and herbaceous for some reason...perhaps the green onions and ginger. Sub'd garlic for the garlic powder and sauteed the curry with some onions.

Turned out great! Didn’t have the patience to wait for the right sauce consistently though! Added flour to thicken very watery sauce, I didn’t want over cooked spongy chicken. I also upped the ginger and added celery, a yellow onion and swapped out green onions for minced garlic. Turned out amazing! Not too spicy, my 2 year old loved it!

I am so happy I found this recipe.  This taste just like my local Jamaican restaurant. All I need now is an awesome rice and peas recipe to complement this dish. 
Great and simple, a must try and taste!
Thank you for sharing this, this is going in our  family’s cook book under awesome.

My hubby ate his and half of mine. Hubby, my brother and the kids said this is a keeper. Our house still smell like curry after two days but everyone was fond of the meal.  Based on earlier reviews I did equal parts water, thai kitchen coconut milk (from can found in the international section of the grocers) and swanson chicken broth. I served with fried cabbage II ( from this site) rice and yams

I made this for my family last week and they said it was the best curry chicken they ever had.  I made it for a serving size of 18 which called for 9 cups of water. I replaced 2 cups of water with 2 cups of coconut milk and 1 cup of water for 1 cup of chicken  broth. I also added 1 tbsp of Jamaican pick a pepper sauce from my old recipe. Other than larger ingredient size,  I kept everything else the same. Delicious!

This is so delicious! As good as I've had from a take away. I reduced the salt like others have suggested, I added a few splashes of soy sauce and a squirt of ketchup. Served with rice and peas and I could eat it all again! Thank  you!

Awesome recipe! I only  made a few seasoning changes, and it was done through tasting. I added a little more curry and salt, but I did it to taste . Other than that, it's a fantastic recipe. My wife loved it, so in my opionin was definitely a hit! 
Thanks allrecipes!

This is an excellent recipe, I would consider using much less salt than what is called for as my curry was extremely salty. The salt was over powering, the chicken turned out fantastic and the potatoes and carrots were good but again extremely salty.

Thanks for this recipe, I am adapting it to a slow cooker chicken stew. I wanted a variance from the usual green herbs and basic stew flavorings. I started adding this and that to my pot and hoping the flavors would work, including ginger and garlic, Cajun seasonings, white pepper, curry and a bit of ground sage, its very similar to this recipe so I am using the flavor suggestions here as well to bring it all together.  Its still cooking, I was just glad to find a similar taste palate. :)

I really enjoyed this recipe. I used chicken drumsticks because that's what I had on hand. I also used scotch bonnet sauce and dried ginger. I didn't have any scallions, so I just omitted those. I will definitely make this dish again and next time I will use fresh ginger and add the scallions to see if there is a significant difference.

Good balance of flavors.  Very good recipe.  I thinly sliced chicken breast to majorly reduce cooking time.  I used about 1/2 the salt (the seasoning salt was probably all that was needed).  More carrots adds color.  The next time I try this it will be probably with oven-baked thighs only.  In essence, the seasoning blend amounts to "Shake 'n Bake."  I'll add a bit of flour to the mix and bake.

I've made this dish 3 times thus far. The 1st time I followed and it was ok. The second time was a disaster. And I guess 3rd time was the charm. I seasoned my chicken and set in fridge over night. I also replaced the water with 1can of coconut milk. I also added a bit more curry to the pan w/oil. I added a tablespoon of ketchup to the simmering mixture (Dnt knock it) and after a little revamping the dish was actually incredible.

Yes, I made it! I actually assisted a friend and used the recipe as a guide. It didn't differ from the way I prepare it , other than adding the curry powder to the oil. Great tip! De-li-cious!!!!!!

Very nice chicken recipe, with great curry flavor.  I used red curry which has a little more heat.  Also, didn't have a habanero or scotch bonnet, so I added 1 Italian long hot.  Had to add a little water to the dish twice during cooking but the meal was well received from those who like eat the heat.

I tried this recipe yesterday it was my first time making  curry chicken. My local market didn't have scallions when I went in so I substituted them with white onions. Delicious!  My family loved it!

This was the best curry recipe I have made so far! I reduced the water to 2 cups, used a little more curry powder and then added some flour at the end to thicken the gravy some. My family loved it!

Love! Made this for Christmas dinner. I had to add water to this recipe but the flavors are great. I used a  Jamaican curry powder called Ocho Rios and it was awesome, not over powering but packed nice flavor. I added two potatoes and a lot of carrots.
