The first batch I left in balls as they dropped off the spoon and they were a little "doughy" in the center.  The second batch I flattened and baked at the reccommended time.  The 3rd batch I flattened and then forgot about when I got a phone call!  It turned out WAY better.  They were in for almost 25 min. and golden brown around the edges.  Fantastic!

I found these to be quite bland, with virtually no flavor whatsoever...salty or sweet.  Perhaps for a childs palate they are fine, but wanted to take them to a charity event for adults.  Glad I tried them out first.

My Grandother made these cookies. Wonderful. She always kept them in the freezer as they are very fragile. At least Gradma's was. Bet you can't eat just one. Thank for posting Little chef

I make these cookies every Christmas.  I have added a twist though that my children just love....after the cookies have cooled, I dip half of each cookie in melted dark chocolate and additional crushed up potato chips.  They are a true crowd pleaser! :)

I have never tried potato chip cookies, but decided to make these to use up 3 small bags of chips that no one wanted. I was a little skeptical because of the simplicity of the ingredients and becuase the dough turned out very soft and buttery. I baked them until golden around the edges and they turned out really good. Just a delicious, simple cookie, nothing extravagant. Just a note, the dough doesn't seem to spread much during baking so you want to flatten them before baking. Also, I used a little more than 1.5 cups of potatoe chips and it turned out fine (I didnt want to throw away any leftovers from the bags).

how can anybody call this bland? do you have taste buds? i do bake at 325, as i find the butter tends to brown too quickly.  when i tell people about potato chip cookies, i get strange looks. however, when they taste one, they want the recipe.

I had this cookie for the first time when I was in grade school back in the late 1960's. I was amazed that the salty-sweet taste and texture reminds me of shortbread. This recipe turns out perfect both in taste and texture. It's become a favorite of my grandchildren. This is a true heirloom recipe!

Perfect in every way.  Followed recipe, no changes suggested.   Shortbread texture.  Hold together nicely. Baked exactly 20 minutes.

They seemed a little pasty. Although they did have a decent amount of sweet flavor, the potato chips seemed to completely overwhelmed by it. You couldn't even just pick out a potato chip and eat it without it tasting like sugar and nothing potato.

Always a hit wherever I take these cookies! I add mini chocolate chips. I also flatten them down before baking.

They were okay...luckily I only made a half batch because I didn't have enough potato chips.  My dough was really dry and I wound up adding an egg. I probably should have flattered them out because they didn't spread out and I they could have used 25 minutes in the oven. I might try them again if I have chips that need to be used or I might try a different recipe.
