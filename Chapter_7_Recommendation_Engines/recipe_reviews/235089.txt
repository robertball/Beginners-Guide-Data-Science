I always prepare a new recipe as written the first time. I have to say I think 60 mins in that hot of an oven is too long. Removing the foil for 10 min was not enough to brown the skin, so the chicken was overcooked and pale. Next time I will shorten the total cooking time and remove the foil sooner or perhaps put the chicken under the broiler for a couple of minutes.

Very nice. I love recipes like this because you can really use it as a base and add whatever veggies you have. I used some fresh picked green beans along with the basil and onion.  It's great that it doesn't need any kind of fat or oil added. Would also be excellent with mashed 'taters. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was simple to follow and was very tasty. I had all of the ingredients and added pear tomatoes. I also only had dry Rosemary. Like others suggested I baked it for 40 mins and baked for the remainder 20 uncovered. I did not brown the chicken prior to baking. My family had seconds. Delicious!

Quick, easy and very tasty.  We doubled the garlic and onion because that's just the type of family we are!

Love a dinner dish that you can quickly prep, place in the oven, and then relax with a glass of wine while it cooks to perfection!  Easy meal with good flavor that makes the kitchen smell great.

I followed the recipe to a "T."  In 49 years of cooking for my husband he has never told me that he does not like what I made and does not want the left overs.  All Recipes Is my favorite source for new recipes and this is the first time I have been disappointed.  We thought that this recipe was bland with very little flavor.  Although it is a fairly  healthy dish, I won't be making it again.

Made this last night for my fianc√©, and he loved it! I used less onion than called for, a bit more garlic (we love our garlic!) and dried rosemary, as I didn't have any fresh on hand. It was a very lovely dinner. He was extremely enthusiastic about me making it again, and for the first time in the 6 years we've been together that he was adamant about me writing down the recipe to use again (his mother is an amazing cook, so it can be hard to impress him). Needless to say, it was a great success!

My family loved this, I substituted the carrots with mixed veggies, and made cheesy garlic mashed potatoes to go with it.

Loved this easy dish!  So simple.  I doubled the number of thighs as someone suggested and it turned out great. I did not brown the chicken prior to baking but took off foil 20 min. before it was done and it browned nicely.  I have added this recipe to my meal plan!

I have become a fan of thighs over breasts now. It nearly melted in my mouth it was so tender and moist. I cut salt by using homemade chicken stock (plus added flavor) and I used only dried herbs (sorry...like they say..."it's all I had". First I seared the thighs in an oiled pan for flavor as well as the browning. Then mostly followed the recipe, reducing the cooking time a little. Definitely will fix this again.

We thought this was a very nice recipe.  It really did take one hour to cook because I'd rolled up the boneless skinless thighs.  My husband really liked the carrots, too.  The only thing I did different was to use dried rosemary because my fresh wasn't good any more.  I would definitely make this again!  Thanks, scottjolened!

Yummy!  I used dried herbs as my fresh ones aren't growing outside yet.  Followed recipe as written and served with Roasted Garlic Cauliflower Mash.  Great supper!

Made it as written.  I did not have fresh rosemary, but the dried worked well. Leftovers are more delicious after sitting in the spices several day.  Definitely will make again.  Thanks

Made this as written except I baked it covered for 40 minutes and uncovered for 20 minutes.  The chicken browned up nicely this way.  Served it with rice as suggested by the author.  Delicious!

Easy to make!  I used dried rosemary because I didn't realize that the fresh rosemary I had was old and the dish still turned out great.  I do think fresh rosemary would have been better.   My husband and I both loved it with wild rice and I think my kids will like the leftovers tomorrow.

This easy recipe turned out delicious.  As always in my kitchen I had to improvise with some substitutions.  In place of parsley I was forced to use cilantro, and instead of thighs I used chicken legs using the same temperature settings and time.  It was a hit!  Simply great flavors.

I made this with just a few changes and it turned out great! My husband wanted it for dinner again the next night. I substituted potatoes for the carrots and they soaked up the flavors divinely. I used fresh herbs from my garden and used a bit more than the recipe called for, just sort of guestimated, and I'm so glad I did because it wasn't bland at all. The meat was fall apart tender. I used boneless thighs and cooked them for 40 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered and it was perfection. I highly recommend this recipe!

I love this recipe.  It is very easy to make (and clean up) and the family loved it.  I added green beans as well.  The last 30 minutes in the oven I placed the chicken on top of all the vegetables so it could brown.  We served this with the juices over white rice.

This was great-chicken stayed very moist. Baked with foil on for 30 min, off for 20 min, it was done perfectly. Too much chicken stock, cut back on liquid next time, definitely make again. Also, used only dry herbs.

Overall it was tasty but a little bland. I don't like cooking with salt but after it was finished cooking, tasted like it needed more salt. Will try again but will use season salt instead of kosher.

Too many onions for me and didn't have a good flavor for some reason. I used fresh basil and crushed dried rosemary. Next time I would rub the spices into the chicken. I used boneless skinless thighs and a few breasts. I used convection oven, converting to 350 degrees. They would have taken about 45-50 minutes. Admittedly I probably cooked them about 10 min too long because I thought they were not done, but they were not dried out.   Husband liked them because of all the onions but the rest of the family didn't eat as much as usual because they were just so-so. I will not make this again. Also they didn't really brown. I'd advise removing the foil for the last 20 min.

This was pretty good. The carrots were great! Chicken could have used a little more flavor, but I did only use dried herbs because that's what I had on hand. If I make this again, I will also use more thighs. Six barely fed myself, my husband, and my two toddlers, and I also had rice as a side. I used boneless skinless thighs so I only cooked them for 50 minutes, and they were moist and perfectly cooked.

This was a nice and different way to cook up chicken thighs.  Honestly, we don't love the thighs, but like to switch up our chicken a bit.  This was pretty easy and I would make again.   Not an absolute favorite, but something good and different.  It does take awhile to cook to give yourself time for that.

I used the recipe as closely as I could since I only had dried basil and I didn't have any rosemary.  I used garlic salt instead of regular salt and I used a lot of black pepper because we like it.  We used boneless chicken thighs and they tasted delicious!!

Really delicious but was almost a soup. I used boneless skinless thighs, fresh basil and dried rosemary. Very tasty and felt very healthy. Will probably be even better tomorrow for lunch!

I don't know where I went wrong but I ended up with the most disgusting rubbery parboiled chicken. Does the cover need holes in it to let out the steam?

I was skeptical about the simplicity of this dish - add broth? But I followed the recipe and found that it needed more herb flavor.
Next time - I will put my spin on herbs and amount. perhaps simmer herbs in the broth then add to pan!
Thanks for a great base recipe!

The only change I made is that I couldn't use fresh basil.  I used basil from the seasoning aisle.  This dish not only tastes fantastic, but my vegan daughter kept saying how wonderful it smelled while it was cooking.  She wants to do the same thing with mushrooms instead of chicken. GREAT dish!

I kept to the recipe but didn't have fresh herbs so I used dry.  I used bone in chicken breast and they did come out very juicy and tender, however the flavor just didn't go throughout the chicken.  Very disappointed, even though I was heavy on the onion and garlic.  I will say the broth was used to make some gravy to put on my mashed potatoes and it was delish.  Just wish the chicken had that much flavor.

Would not make this again. I used fresh green beans instead of carrots. The green beans were the best part of the dish. The chicken never crisped even though I cooked chicken covered for 40 minutes and uncovered for about 25 minutes. Green beans were Delish.

While it was tasty, I was left with chicken  swimming in broth, and never browned.   I am going to put rice in the roaster, cook it in the liquid and then put the left over chicken on top to warm.  If I decide to make this again, I will put 3/4 cup rice in the bottom of the roaster, then add the carrots, then put the chicken in on top.  Will be like a casserole, without the boiled chicken effect after.

This recipe reminded me of chicken my Mom used to make. Only she would sprinkle with olive oil rather than bake with the chicken broth. I reduced the amount of carrots and added some potatoes to make a one pan dinner. Will make again.

Easy to make, low fuss... 

I liked the recipe, I used chicken legs.  I felt it needed a little more salt , despite I brine and season my chicken over night. My husband and children loved it.  I used dried & fresh Basil.  Dried Rosemary and caramelized my onions. Used a little dry white wine with the recommended chicken stock.  

I made roasted potatoes with the meal that also had rosemary, thyme, basil and oregano on them.  They complimented the meal well.

Easy recipe! Now considered as one of my go-to recipes. I didn't have chicken stock on hand so I just used water and butter as a substitute (works out, less sodium hehe). I also cooked the chicken as others suggested, 40 mins covered and 20 mins uncovered - perfectly moist!
