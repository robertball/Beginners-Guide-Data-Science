I went for this as it's something different. Followed recipe exactly even though I thought perhaps that's too much sugar. With addition of the Brazil nuts, the batter became very crumbly, so I used a small melon ball scooper and packed the batter into the scooper and placed the balls on a Silpat mat. The cookies were tasty - very sweet, nutty orangy flavor. I can best describe my reaction as ambivalent - they were kind of good, but maybe I'll make them again, and maybe not.  If I make them again, I would reduce the sugar by 2-3 TBspoons.

I used half sugar & half splenda for my double batch and cut the amount to just over a half cup.  The melon baller worked pretty well but i cut the cooking time to 11min.  Yummy!  People loved them and it was nice to give them a healthier cookie for a change.  Plus one that I can eat (I'm a low carber)  Next time I make I'll toast the chopped nuts just a bit before adding them.

I got great reviews on this cookie!  It wasn't a soft macaroon-like cookie I thought it would be as the oats were a little tough still, but I didn't leave them in the fridge over nigh either - only for 6 hours.  Either way, I liked this cookie and the orange adds just the little bit extra!

This recipe was great. It was suprisingly moist an very sweet. It was worth the cracking of the brazil nuts. The orange zest really gives it a unique taste.
