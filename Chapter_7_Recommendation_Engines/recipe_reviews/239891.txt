What a strange combination of ingredients!  But, the result was a delicious bowl of popcorn!  I'll make this again!

This was something different, and I enjoyed the half batch I made. I like spicy, but when it comes to cayenne (or any spice, for that matter, that I think may be too much for me), I usually cut back....and that was a good call here. I'd cut back a little on the cinnamon, too. Just as the submitter mentioned, you can adjust the spices to your own tastes. I would never think to combine these flavors, but they work! Thanks for the good recipe, allareine!

3 words; oh my gosh! This recipe is incredible! I too was dubious about the combination of flavors, but one bite and it was like a party in my mouth! Love this recipe, it's definitely a keeper :).

I made this exactly as written.  I thought this popcorn was amazing.  None of the ingredients overpowered anything else.  I will definitely make this again.

I really liked this combination of flavors.  I didn't make as much popcorn as the recipe called for so my topping was more intense and I liked it that way. Very easy to make and great taste.  Thanks!

A very unusual combo that grows on you.  Next time I may cut back on the honey as this a little too sweet for me.  Perfect for game day with it's not your normal popcorn taste.

This was a great way to eat popcorn. Warning; it is difficult to stop eating the popcorn. I am not afraid of hot foods, and I prefer to sprinkle the cayenne pepper at the end. It provides a fantastic contrast with the sweet flavor. 
I also noticed that the popcorn keeps well in a sealed container.

I'm currently dairy free, so I used grape seed oil instead of butter. I think that changed it coated the pop corn. It didn't coat well. But, the flavor was awesome! I will definitely make this again!

This bizarre combination of spices makes for a very delicious salty-spicy-sweet popcorn topping.  Also, mixing honey into the butter makes the toppings stick nicely to the popcorn.  This is the best popcorn I've ever had!

3.9.18  Interesting blend of spices which really does give you a good balance of sweet, spicy and salty.  Next time I make this I’ll be sure to have an icy, cold beer sitting right next to it!  Wouldn’t change a thing, I liked it exactly as it’s written.

I made this for a bridal shower with a popcorn bar. I made a few different kinds of popcorn, and this was definitely the favorite! This is a very different seasoning blend, like nothing I've ever tried before. I really liked it and will definitely make it again.

I didn't have onion powder, don't see the need for it. Interesting flavor mix, like the heat at the end. Doubled the honey/butter/spice mix to accommodate the amount f popcorn I made. For the knitting buddies...they will be the judge...

This tasted like a India spiced popcorn to me. After I ate a bit of it and got used to the taste I enjoyed it but my husband and son hated it.
