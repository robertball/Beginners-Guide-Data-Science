Very good.  I had to finish under the broiler for the bacon to be crispy.  A little advice: put the toothpick on the SIDE of the chunk of chicken so you can flip it over and broil the other side.  Served with honey mustard and would recommend the whole amount of sugar, but brown sugar.  Great appetizer!

This recipe was so good!  I halved the recipe because I thought it sounded like too much.  I never should have done that!  I took them to a church fellowship and they were all gone by the time the everyone went through for firsts.  Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe.  Will definitely make again.  Am actually making them again this Saturday!  Thank you for the awesome recipe!

These were really good!  My girlfriends raved about them.  I do think that 5 lbs of chicken is too much though.  I think my package was about 3 lbs.  I also needed more ranch mix because I dipped the chicken before and after I wrapped the bacon around it.  I baked for 20 minutes and broiled for 10 to get the bacon crispy.  I will definitely make these again!

this is great on the grill. I wrapped them in foil and let them cook for 10 minutes turning twice. removed them from the foil and allow them to cook another 5 minutes to crisp the bacon.  Served them with spinach salad and melon on the side. YUMMY

I made them slightly different for dinner instead of appetizers; I didn't cut up my chicken but skewered it onto the sticks  with the bacon on top that I first partially cooked.  I didn't have dry ranch so I used pre-made ranch (no sugar)and marinated the chicken in it for about 30 minutes.  Came out moist and delicous! :)

Just made this for Christmas Eve company and it was a hit. I used 4 chicken breasts, which was too much for the amount of bacon, but I just dredged them in the sugar/ranch mix and cooked them alongside the others. Thanks!

Really good.  I used Italian seasoning mix rather than ranch.  Coat it in alot of this mixture.  I also did not bake as long and then broiled it the last few minutes to make the bacon crisp.

Amazingly good!  My kids wanted to have this as the main course!  I cut the sugar in half, and still had plenty to coat the chicken and bacon.  Thanks for this recipe!

These were very similiar to the bacon wrapped little smokies I've made before.  I am not sure that the ranch added much flavor, and you could probably use the Italian seasoning that others suggested.  I would also use brown sugar instead of white the next time.  I used a package of bacon and 4 chicken breasts with half of the sugar/ranch mix.  If you like them crispy, broil them for a few minutes at the end.

I made these for a pot luck. I gave a sample of them to my hubby and DD. They Loved them!! I did use brown sugar instead of the white and only half the sugar at that. I added a slice of raw jalapeno to the bundles. My family and I thought they were delicious! Thank you very much Mel!! I will keep these in the rotation:)

YUM-O!  the ranch/sugar mixture makes a nice sweet coating to these appetizers.  I made a test batch and served them to my family for dinner and they asked for them again the next day.  I'll definitely be serving this up at my next family get toghether.  I tried another reviewers suggestion on the second day and substituted italian seasoning for the ranch and it was just as fabulous!

This recipe is awesome. Have used it as an appetizer and a light meal. I followed the recipe with the exception of having to cook it 10 minutes longer.

Delicious. I was afraid the bacon was going to be really soggy on this, but it turned out fantastic. I loved the ranch/sugar coating that turned crispy on the outside, too, but I had WAY too much of it. Next time I'll cut it in half.

I partially cooked the bacon before wrapping the chicken bites in it so the bacon was crispy when the chicken was done. Very good.

I think if you fry the bacon until it's about half done and then wrap the chicken in it it will finish cooking in the oven and come out crispy without putting it under a broiler.

Amazing Appetizer!!!  What fun and SO TASTY!  It couldn't be more simple, but be sure to use Silpat or non-stick foil b/c it is Super Sticky.  We had this for New Year's snacks and it was a huge hit.

We had this for dinner tonight.  It was very good, and we will be having it again!  Next time we will do a couple things different though.  We will cut the chicken a little smaller, about 2 bites per piece, we will lay the bacon on top of the chicken and secured it with toothpick instead of wrapping it, and we will NOT use thick cut bacon.  The bacon was difficult to get cook all the way because it was too thick and it was wrapped.  The ranch dressing powder was perfect with the white sugar, it turned into a little crust and was possibly my favorite part.    So in conclusion, we really like the taste of the sweet ranch powder on the bacon and chicken, definitely worth doing again!

These were good. Had good flavor. I broiled them for the last 5-10 mintues so that the bacon would get crispy. Would make again.

Absolutely loved it, just got a two packets of chicken breast and as I went made the cuts smaller to fit a good wrap of bacon. Used two packets of Ranch and  a cup of sugar but threw a couple pinches in as I went. Made about 50 for 5 of us never used the second packet of chicken cause I ran out of bacon but they literally were gone in 10 minutes. Put both trays in the oven and at 30 minutes bacon wasn't fully cooked. broiled for 8 minutes and turned out amazing!!! 30 minutes oven if you like your bacon cooked but not crispy add the 8ish minutes broil if you do, either way a winner of a meal.

Yes, I have made a version of this recipe...
I used barbeque sauce instead of ranch and
omit the sugar.  I also use chicken tenderloins
which are slightly smaller than the breasts!

AWESOME! I made these for my house-warming/ugly sweater party for about 15 people and there were NO LEFT OVERS!! I had people wanting more! I used Stubbs spicy BBQ as the dipping sauce and they didnt last more than 10 minutes into the party, and the prep was SUPER SUPER easy for those of us still getting used to the kitchen =) love these and will make these again very soon!

Made a slight change & we love it.  Used 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2. cup of brown sugar. Cook about 38 minutes to make bacon crispy and they are terrific.

I didn't care for the ranch flavor so I used a toasted sesame sauce instead and skipped the sugar...marinated for a couple of hours, then sprinkled with sesame seeds and popped into the oven and cooked for 40 minutes instead of 30, turning twice in the cooking process.

I love these! The bacon doesnt get super crispy, but I dont mind that at all; I took the advice of one review and used half the sugar, and used brown sugar, put the toothpick in the side, cooked for 15 minutes, turned the chicken.bacon pieces over, and cooked for another 15 minutes, and they turned out fabulous!!! I only got a couple of them the first time I made them, they went so fast!

we did not care for these at all.  The bacon did not crisp up in the oven; you couldn't even taste the ranch dressing; and the chicken chunks are way too big.  I don't even want to put the effort in to try to tweak it.  A no go for us

This was wonderful. I ran out of bacon half way through my chicken. I cooked up the leftover chicken chunks & seasoning mix in a saucepan the next day with some bacon grease. It got all sticky sweet and yummy similarish to orange chicken. This is a keeper whether in a pan or on a toothpick. *One note I would make is that 30 min was too long in the oven... The chicken got dry

Love this recipe.  When I take in to share in a group setting, I always come home with an empty dish.   A few things I have learned.  I don't think I am using 5 lbs of chicken.   Usually use 2-3 large chicken breasts.  I cook it on a broil pan so the juices drip down in the pan.  I tried using parchment paper on a cooking sheet - ended  up with a mess.  I need to cook it longer than stated in the recipe - I just keep checking on it.  When done I put it a crock pot to keep warm.

I took this to a party over the weekend and everyone wanted the recipe. It's super easy to make and is delish! I did cook the bacon for a few minutes in the microwave beforehand to make it extra crispy and cooked it under the broiler the last couple of minutes. I used 2 pounds of bacon and still didn't use all the chicken. I probably cut them into smaller than 2" chunks because they seemed easier to eat that way. Great recipe!

This was a big hit with my family, and they are HARD to please. They're addictive, so make a lot. The sugar burned off and that got a tiny bit smokey. But enough cooked into the bacon to make them just right.

I have found it helpful when baking anything wrapped in bacon, if you spray cooling racks and place them in a rimmed baking sheet, the rack keeps the items from laying in the bacon grease. It also helps if the bacon is partially cooked before wrapping.
