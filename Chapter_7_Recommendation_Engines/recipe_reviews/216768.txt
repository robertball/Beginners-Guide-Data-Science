I've never rated a recipe first!!! Well wouldn't ya know - I changed it - only because I don't eat regular potatoes unless their mashed with gravy on special Holidays!?! But I do serve sweet potatoes - and that's what I used. We love mushrooms and onions sauteed' on anything - so decided to give this a try and it worked!! My husband would have liked sour cream more but I was fine with the yogurt. All in all it was a very healthy - and fine tasting meal. I served it with a salad - and will make again sometime. It would probably be great with a bit of cheese on top - but I was looking for healthy and low fat. Thanks!

Delicious! I made a few changes - I used a medium potato, doubled the mushrooms and onions, and used plain greek yogurt (more like sour cream in taste and texture, but really healthy)! Also, 10 minutes in the microwave is a bit long if you're using a 1100 watt model - I strongly suggest starting with a shorter microwave time, otherwise the bottom of the potato will get hard (and I like to eat all of the skin!)

Yummy!!  This was perfect!  I did just go ahead and microwave it the whole time...I didn't want to heat up my house with the oven.  Yogurt is such a good substitute for sour cream!!!

I've added other veges, like corn, peas,, or whatever's leftover in the fridge. Baked potatoes are so versatile and this recipe can be a model for all kinds of additions.  I particularly like the yogurt instead of sour cream.

I boiled potatoes to save time.  Sliced them and placed in greased pan using olive oil spray.  In the meantime, I sauted onions in butter as directed until onions were translucent.  Added sliced mushrooms.  Omitted yogurt.  Covered and baked for 30 minutes at 300 degrees.  Great to make ahead and refrigerate until ready to bake.  Loved it. Add grated pecorino romano cheese for an extra dash of flavor.

This was very different and great. The onions and mushrooms, “yum” and the creamy yogurt!  I will definitely make it again. Soon!
