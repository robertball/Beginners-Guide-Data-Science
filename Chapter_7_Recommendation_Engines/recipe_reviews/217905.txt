Instead of using saltines, I used three packages of oyster crackers. I also used a homemade dry ranch seasoning mix. I chose to bake my crackers at 250* for an hour, stirring every 15 minutes only because I was worried they'd turn out soggy. These are so. freaking. good. GREAT movie night snack.

Really? You want me to pour oil over crackers??? They won't get soggy??? Wow, was I ever surprised that these didn't turn to mush! :)

I made half a recipe, since it's just me and hubby, and made it exactly as written. These whip together really quickly and are so easy. A nice blend of flavors, which I didn't find too spicy at all. They were quite salty though. I'm not sure I'd make these again, but if I do, I'll probably just use half the ranch dressing packet to cut down on the salt and/or use unsalted crackers.

I had some of these at a party for my stepmother and they deserve their strong reputation. The crackers won't get soggy whatsoever (it's witchcraft), but they're intensely flavorful and have a bit of a kick to them, which is of course adjustable. Two things: the ranch dressing is full of sodium, so opt for reduced or zero sodium crackers. Two, they can be a bit greasy to handle, so if you're serving them by themselves, you might want to have tongs and plenty of napkins beside them so nobody gets greasy ranch hands (ha! I said ranch hands!). Oyster crackers would be a better choice for soups. I recommend this recipe!

These crackers are so easy to make, and absolutely delicious! In addition to Saltines, we opted to try this recipe on Ritz and Club crackers as well. The Club crackers were by far the best... our guests were fighting over them! Ha! Also, we sprinkled some parmesan cheese into the bag to coat the crackers  after they were done "marinating"... perfection!

These are fantastic!  Didn't have whole wheat crackers on hand, but they turned out great anyway.

Suggestion:  I took these to work, still in the ziplock bag.  NOT the best presentation.  No one wanted to even try them at first, but after they did they went like hotcakes.

I'd move them to a different package for presentation.

Again, these are fantastic.

My sis-in-law started making these for the Christmas holiday a few years ago. I took the recipe and like many others, tried lots of different crackers. Oyster crackers work great, as well as Cheez-Its. I also agree with some others here that Club crackers are better than saltines. The recipe I use also calls for cayenne (red) pepper to taste... 1/4 to 1/2 tsp just gives it that extra spicy kick. Great for superbowl parties, too! You can put just about anything in there, kind of a Chex Mix variety... pretzels are good, and wheat Chex as well. Chicken in a Biscuit..Soooo good. Have fun with it and experiment.

Cheap.  Easy to make.  Real crowd pleaser.  I do prefer using the regular saltine cracker over the whole wheat ones.  Both are good though.

This was so simple, I could not believe it!  I had to use Multigrain Saltines because my store did not carry whole wheat.  They worked fine.  They were made the night before a football get together and as a friend said, "they are addicting"  Will diffinately make them again.

This is a great recipe. I had a similar one that suggested mixing the crackers and oil mixture, then putting them in a paper bag for 15 minutes.  The bag absorbs much of the oil.  I think I will next try the spice/oil mixture to make my own trail mix.

These are delicious, even though I only had one tablespoon of red pepper flakes.  I look forward to making it with two.  They are very similar to the Ranch Oyster Crackers we make, but the chili adds a new dimension.  I used regular saltines.

made these for a work carry in- took about 1 min prep time and cost 1.99 for the box of store brand club crackers- as I had every thing else at home. Most people bring in dips/ spreads and these were the perfect paring for all the salads/dips etc.
crowd favorite- these will be made again and again. I pinned to my tailgating recipe board. Will take to parties/ and will be my new standard for work carry ins.

We love this recipe. One change I often make is to use a packet of Fiesta ranch dressing mix, rather than regular ranch. It gives it a different flavor that is really good with cheddar and stronger cheese. We also like this combination for the cracker we use with the 7 layer Mexican dip.

I’ve made this recipe numerous times, with and without the chili powder, and the menfolk in my family prefer no chili powder.  I have also made it with oyster crackers and that’s a hit.  Once, I only had half a box of regular Premium saltines and half a box of Keebler Club crackers so I just threw them all together and made the recipe (no chili powder)...my husband was crazy about that batch!  He wants the Club crackers solely in the next batch so I’m making those this week. In one batch, I added a packet of Zesty Italian dressing mix in with the Hidden Valley Ranch, for another dimension of flavor, and it seemed that the women we had over liked those...maybe because the spice level seemed smoother?  In any case, this recipe is being made repeatedly, especially this month & next when my husband takes them to deer camp....his new favorite snack!

Oh my goodness.  I don't even know where to begin.  First of all, this recipe defies logic.  How can you soak crackers in oil without them getting soggy???  I don't know, but it doesn't matter because these crackers are delicious!  I have made them a few times now.  I like to use chipotle chili powder in place of the regular chili powder.  Use these as a side dish for cold beer and football games.  Seriously, you won't be able to stop eating these, even though your mouth is on fire.

Been making these for years and always a big hit! They are addicting! Can't eat just one! I use the rectangle ziplock containers and flip every 15 mins for an hour. I don't use the chili powder either. And we have yet to wait a day before eating....dig in!

These are great!  I have also had them with using the popcorn butter flavoring instead of the oil...adds a buttery flavor to them which is great!

These are amazingly delicious and addicting. I use Zesta wheat crackers, and add 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper. I bake for an hour at 250 degrees, stirring every 15 minutes. Then I place them in lunch size brown paper bags over night so they absorb some of the oil. Perfect!

I substituted the ranch with spicy or fiesta ranch. They are really good and this omitted the need for the chili powder.

These are addictive.  I made it just as the recipe states and they were great!  I might decrease the amount of oil next time to see how that does, but the recipe was good.

I've made these exactly as the recipe states and they're really, really good. I've also tried them using cheese-it crackers and they were amazing. The only thing I usually do differently is I bake mine at 250 for an hour and turn them every 15 minutes. This also makes it so that you don't need to wait til overnight to remove them from the bag and cuts back on the oiliness. You can also get away with using a little less oil if you're patient enough to mix the crackers around a lot more. I like to add cayenne powder, garlic powder and onion powder and increase the red pepper because I like them spicier. I've added 2tbsp of MSG to the mix and it really kicked the flavor up a notch, you just have to be sure the people you're sharing with don't have a sensitivity to MSG. This is a great recipe and you'll love the results. I like to bring these to potlucks in little baggies for everyone to eat then or take home. Thanks for sharing this recipe, I'm going to keep on making these forever.

Added a few twists so it's not as spicy for the kids.  Instead of the crushed read pepper and chili powder, we substituted a Cajun dip package that has a little less bite.

This recipe is such a surprise.  I too thought the crackers would be so soggy. After reading the reviews and trusting the author and reviewers opinions, I made these crackers.  I am a little wimpy on heat so I did cut the red peppers back. The crackers have a nice kick, they did stay crisp. I did turn the bag every 5 minutes for an hour as recipes called for with perfect results. I'll make this recipe over and over. You won't be disappointed.Thank you, Doeye.

I used spicy ranch dressing mix and it gave it a little more kick.

I love these crackers.  They don't get soggy, they just get better.  They keep for a very long time.  Yes, they are salty, but I use crackers with unsalted tops, which helps some.

I did reduce the oil and then baked them as suggested in the earlier reviews.  They came out great!  A nice snack when watching movies.

We make these often with one change - we prefer without the ranch dressing mix.  Still works and are absolutely fabulous.  You can adjust the red pepper flakes to make it as spicy as you want and I normally at least double the amount.  Yep - we like em hot here in Texas!!!

I have made them with saltines, wheat saltines, and Ritz (or something similar) and every variation is great!

This is a fun recipe to play with. Years ago the first recipe I used also had a packet of cheese (the one that comes in a Kraft Mac and Cheese box.
I then substituted 2 T. of grated Parmesan (Kraft in a container),  plus 2 t. Italian Seasoning. 
Both of these changes were added to the original recipe just minus the chili powder.
