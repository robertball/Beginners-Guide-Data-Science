This is a great recipe. I already know it's going to be great because I tasted the filling. My daughter is in the process of finishing this cheesecake with the glaze. She came to ask if I left off the salt as an ingredient when I typed it up so I came back to check. There is no salt in the ingredient list but it's mentioned in directions. I decided to check reviews to see if someone else caught it but saw the two disaster reviews instead. If the recipe is followed, the cream cheese and condensed milk will set it. The liquid ingredients are used for the glaze, not for the pie itself. Maybe that's the reason for the other cooks "runny mess".

My wife and I tried this twice (with 2 different types of cream cheese) and ended up with a runny mess both times. And 8 cans of Apricots for 1 pie? Check the recipe, there must be a mistake.

I tried it as written and it was so very runny. It never set up. I boldly made it again using half the sweetened condensed milk (just one can) and I made it in the morning, but it still did not 'set up'. The apricots sunk in, even after I let it chill for five hours (not just two). It has been over 48 hours and the thing is a runny mess. There is no ingredient to stabilize it. 'Cheescake Soup' is the end result.

Loved this recipe. Very simple, and not a lot of prep.
