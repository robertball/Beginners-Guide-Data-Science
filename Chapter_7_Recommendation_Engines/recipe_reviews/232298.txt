I prefer only real maple syrup, but miss the thickness of the fake syrups.  I recommend using light brown sugar vs dark.  After completely cooled & a taste test I increased the maple extract to nearly another tsp. I buy the maple extract from Kroger.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. It just didn't come out at all. I am not a novice cook and have made syrups before but this was just not good. Very grainy I am not sure I will try it again, if I do I will update review. But at this point not so much.

Best syrup I have ever had. 2 tbsp butter. Boiled to 223-230 C to thicken. Next morning after refrigeration it was perfectly thick and rich and delicious!

I have yet to go out and buy maple extract, so I just use pure vanilla and it's delicious. I've found that adding more butter makes this even tastier with no more effort. I looked for this recipe when we were out of maple syrup and have been alternating between maple syrup and this gem ever since.

I added butter flavoring and a little extra butter making it so no butter needed to be added to pancakes. I love the fact you do not need corn syrup. My family of five loved it!!! This is my “go to” syrup recipe!!!

Being diabetic I normally play around with ingredients. This one I substituted stevia for the white sugar and added an extra teaspoon of maple.

Super easy and super good.  Tastes just like bottled syrup but brighter and fresher.  I only made a little at a time becuase it does start to crystallize after a few days in the fridge.

Easy and tasty! I like that it doesn't have high fructose corn syrup.  I didn't have maple extract, so used pure vanilla extract and it was great.

I like this recipe because it's very easy and I didn't have corn syrup for one of the other recipes that I reviewed.  I'm wondering why I would need it at all. My syrup came out nice and thick although the butter made it a little less clear. I  use raw sugar with the light brown sugar and I also used the same amount of vanilla and it is delicious. I saved my old bottle and I used for this recipe a vinegar bottle and it made about 2 cups. Thank you

Super easy and the kids loved it! And, even though it isn't good for them, I feel much better giving my kids this syrup vs the syrup with high fructose corn syrup as the main ingredient! I also made a version with rum extract and vanilla extract!
