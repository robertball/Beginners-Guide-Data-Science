Delicious and easy!  Here are my changes.  1.  Grease the pan with cooking spray.  2.  Spread refried beans on 1st layer of tortillas.  3.  Used chopped fresh tomatoes rather than canned. 4.  Added an extra layer...tortillas/beans& beef, cheese & salsa, tortillas, beef, tortillas, taco sauce and cheese.
Really good with some sour cream and/or hot sauce on the side!

Yum Yum Yummmmmmmmy. This was easy to make and delicious. I did lightly coat the pan to keep things from sticking. I put refried beans on top of the first layer of tortillas. In the meat, I added onions and some garlic powder. I used more like 2 cups of cheese but I also added more layers. My layers went like this: Tortilla, refried beans, beef mixture, cheese, tortilla, beef mixture, cheese, tortilla, salsa and a lil more cheese. My mom and grandma tried it at lunch today and loved it as well. I served it with sour cream. The only thing I would do different next time is use 1 1/2 lb of hamburger. I think with the extra layer I needed a bit more.

Great for leftovers & freezing. You can alter this however you want - I often add black beans and green chiles, and use flour tortillas instead of corn. Like others suggested, putting a layer of "filling" on the bottom of the pan prevents sticking, dried out tortillas.

Huge hit! This dish reminded us of an enchilada recipe we both love. I used other reviewers' suggestions and browned the meat with some minced onion and garlic. I also put sour cream between the salsa and the cheese layers. Make sure to carefully oil your pan because the bottom tortillas won't come off otherwise.

My husband loved this recipe.  I used flour tortillas and thought they would be hard, but they were good.  I also added sour cream and refried beans plus an extra layer to make it more like lasagna.  So yummy!!!  Will be making on a weekly basis.

This is really good. I used more meat than 1 pound, added sliced black olives and a can of refried beans to the meat mixture, and used 2 cups of cheese (1/2 cup, are you kidding?). Topped it with sour cream and shredded lettuce at the table.

Wow- great recipe. This one beats all the other noodle varieties on this website. This is by far the best. I suggest using cooking spray and adding cheese to the meat layer under the 2nd layer of tortillas in addition to the cheese on top. I used a 2 cup bag of that Kraft Mexican shredded blend. Other than that I made it just as described. Great!

In Mexico this is actually called "Pastel Azteca" intead of lasagna. I usually use crumbled tortilla chips instead of whole corn tortillas. I also use two types of cheese together: mozzarella and an orange cheese such as cheddar or mimolette, putting a layer of sour cream sprinkled with paprika and chili powders just under the cheese before baking. As a side dish I make a mexican style rice: chopped onions, red & green peppers saut√©ed together, add rice, then a broth to cover the rice, add red or pinto beans and some corn, and allow to simmer till the rice is tender. Great together.

This was yummy, quick, and very versatile. I added some black beans and a can of mexican corn to the ground beef mixture, and then added some Monterey Jack cheese to the Cheddar, and put another layer of cheese in the middle. Thanks!

Excellent!  Made this meal very quickly and turned out sooo good!  I also substituted flour for corn tortillas and used ground turkey.   Also, I put black olives on top before I baked and added green chilis.  Turned out fabulous!  Will make again, thanks!!

Good and easy recipe.  Although I received no complaints from any family member, not sure if I'll make again because there are a few other recipes that are similar on this site that I prefer over this one.  However, if your looking for an easy mexican dish, it will satisfy.

You can cut the round tortilla shells in half to fit the pan on the sides better and place the round ones in the middle.  I make more layers by warming refried beans and spreading this over a layer of tortilla shells and topping with shredded cheddar cheese and another layer of Spanish Rice spread over a layer of tortilla shells and sprinkling with more cheese.  I buy a huge foil roasing pan so you don't have to worry about this rising over the dish while baking, let it rest after it's done, cut a square and top with shredded lettuce, black olives, diced fresh tomatoes, diced green onion and top with sour cream, taco sauce, warmed jarred mexican cheese sauce poured over all....a masterpiece.

I've been making since college and I'm glad to see it on here.  To make this a 5 star dish, in my mind, is adding 1 small can of enchilada sauce (I use on the very bottom below the tortillas and the top tortilla layer), adding one can of diced green chili's to the meat, mashing one can of black beans (on top of the tortillas below the meat), and adding Rotel on top the meat.

This was amazing! However, I did take a collection of tips from other reviews! I did add a small can of green chillis to the browned meat.  My lasagna layers were three tortillas, refried beans, half the me meat mixture, colby jack cheese (about a cup), another layer of tortillas (3), drained rotel tomatoes (with green chillis), other half of meat mixture, colby jack cheese (about a cup), a can of drained corn.  Finally, I topped the lasagna with 2 tortillas shredded and some cheddar cheese!! A side of shredded lettuce and sour cream!! Will make again, and again!!

As written this is 4 stars but with the following changes my family thought its was a 5 star meal. I lined a 9x9 pan with salsa and then laid a flour tortilla on top, spread with pinto beans, layer with cheese and hot sauce, top with another tortilla and spread meat mixture, top with cheese, repeat. I used taco sized tortillas and I didn't have to cut them to fit the pan at all. Also make sure you use a can of rotel or seasoned diced tomatoes and this will be great! I also made half with corn and that made it even better.

awesome! I added a can of black beans to it and split it into 8 servings (because when I did only 5 they were huge!) Fixed our cravings for mexican food and only cost us 251 cal :)

My friend originally gave me this recipe and I love it - mostly because you can customize it any way you want and it still tastes amazing!  Every time I make it I add different ingredients, but usually: sauted diced onions with diced red (or any color) peppers, I've added celery, frozen mixed veggies (peas, corn, carrots, etc.).  To the taco meat (with homemade seasoning) I add a cup of cooked brown rice and a can of black beans, sometimes kidney, and I mix in the salsa.  I haven`t added tomatoes yet but the salsa has lots in it.  I use wheat tortillas, about 3 layers.  I go easy on the cheese.  Longer in the oven at 350, usually 45 minutes so it`s nice and hot.  Or 30 mins at 375.  My hubby likes to top it with Frank`s Red Hot sauce.  He begs me to make this!!  My young kids eat it too!

I loved this and used the concept to make a really yummy dish.  I had a bit of time to play with the recipe today and I did modify.  First, I chopped a red pepper and medium onion to a small chop and sauteed it till soft in a bit of EVOO and then added 3 cloves of finely minced garlic and cooked for another minute or so.  Then I addded the ground beef and browned until cooked and not pink.  (I always make my tacos strating just this way.  It is an easy and inexpensive way to add flavor and nutrition for my vegetable avoiding teen son).  I then added the taco seasoning and a can of fire roated diced tomatoes with green chilies (Trader Joe's) and (because I like it a bit saucy) a 4 oz. can of tomatoe sauce.  I also added a can of drained black beans and simmered for a bit.  The ceramic pan was lightly greased with EVOO. I used the flour tortillas and put 4 on the bottom, half the beef mixture, a sprinkling of grated Mexican cheese, another layer or tortillas (3-but to kind of fit), beef and chesse then top with the tortillas, a layer of medium corn/black bean salsa and a layer of cheese.  The total amount of cheese used was the 2 cup package and I used probably a cup of salsa. I baked for about 30 minutes and allowed it to sit for a bit.  It was delicious and the chilis gave it just the right zing.  I thought the amount of beef (1 lb) with the added veggies was just right.  It made a good sized dish and we'll have leftovers.  Thanks for this recipe!

This turned out great. What little was left over went to work with my husband for lunch, he liked it that much. I couldn't find shredded Colby so I just used vermont cheddar, and I added some drained canned black beans that I added some chili powder, cumin, and Adobo Seasoning, and then just layered all this. Served with a salad, WOW this was good eating. Definitely will make again!

5 stars for taste and ease! Served with chopped avocado for garnish- yum. Added a can of refried beans, as a layer on top of tortillas, then meat, and used shredded low-fat and regular Mexican cheese for ease, at least double the amount. Great way to use up corn tortillas in your fridge. Hungry teens loved this one. Thanks for sharing!

So easy and very tasty! This is one of those recipes you think to yourself, " Why haven't I been making this for years?". My kids loved it too! I took another reviewer's suggestion of adding a layer of refried beans at the bottom. Great idea!

I made this for a potluck last night and it was one of the few dishes that was almost finished. I think it had something to do with the fact that a lot of people had made pasta and seafood dishes, and this was a welcome change. 

While I browned the ground beef, I opened the can of diced tomatoes and poured the juice onto the bottom of the casserole dish so that the tortillas wouldn't stick. In addition to the ingredients listed, I also added a layer of refried beans and sour cream. Instead of Colby cheese, I used 2 cups of 4 Cheese Mexican. Great recipe, what a crowd pleaser. SOOO easy to put together.

was very tasty but it tasted more like a dip.  my husband wanted to and did grab some chips and dug in.  he really liked it but not as a dinner.  you couldn't even tell there were shells in the recipe.  they just blended in.  i think i will use hard shells if i make this again.

Simple, fun recipe.  Easy to customize to your liking.  I used ground turkey and added jalapenos, corn, garlic, and onion to the meat.  Definitely added more cheese than the recipe called for and took the advice of other reviewers and added refried beans to the first layer.  It turned out great!

This dish was great. I changed a lot. Used flour tortillas instead  of corn and I added the refried beans too. Used half ground turkey and half ground beef. Used 2-1/2 cups of a Mexican blend pre-shredded cheese and added corn, olives and jalapenos. I added a little crushed garlic and some onion to the meat mixture while it was cooking too. Baked it for 35 mins. and let it sit for 5 minutes before cutting into it. Served w/ sour cream and guacamole.

This recipe has been a really big hit each time we've made it, a good base recipe that you can tailor to your liking and is easy to make.  We used the layer of refried beans on the bottom layer like some suggested.  I used fresh tomatoes this time, although my husband noted it was drier than the first time when I used the canned tomatoes, so I'll probably used the canned next time.  I used lots of cheese - the 2% milk shredded Mexican blend.

Yum! I too made an extra layer of tortillas, and added a LOT more cheese (bf is a cheese addict), added sliced jalapenos, green onions, and a diced roma tomato instead of the canned ones.

Very good.  Added a can of chili since I did not have any refried beans.  Also sliced up a few corn tortillas and sprinkled on top for the last 10 minutes of baking.

Everyone loved this one!  I made a few small changes here n there.  I had actually 3 layers of tortillas...I put a layer of Mexican style refried beans in and I only used about half of the can of tomatoes.  I chose Cilantro salsa and the Mexican seasoned shredded cheese instead of Colby.   My boyfriend said "This is a make again recipe babe!"

Very easy and super good! I did change a few things though. I added one small tube of regular sausage to the beef just because it is what I had in my freezer and instead of 1 can, I used 2 cans of tomatoes. I also added garlic, onions, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper to the meat while I was browning it. When layering I sprayed the pan and put tortillas on the bottom, then cheese, meat, tortillas, salsa, and then cheese. Served with lettuce, tomato, and sour cream.

I was hesitant to try this because the list of ingredients didn't seemed like they would make a boring combination, but I couldn't ignore the rave reviews. I'm so glad I tried it because it was so good! So easy to make & you can even assemble it the night  before. I did increase the amounts so that I could make more layers, as other reviews suggested. Note- the spiciness of the salsa you use will determine the heat of this dish so be sure to use one that you know you like, and use your fave type of cheese if you don't like Colby. Oh, don't forget to grease the pan!

Although edible, this was not particularly good.  I used Rotel and refried beans , per other reviewers.  The main problem was the corn tortillas turned to mush.  I will not make this again.

Really tasty!  A few changes I made:  used half a can of petite diced tomatoes with jalapenos and a small can of diced green chiles, spread refried beans on the bottom layer of tortillas, and used taco sauce in place of salsa.  Will definitely make again!

This dish was delicious. I modified it slightly by making it doubled layered and adding a little salsa, black olives, cheddar cheese, and jalapenos in both layers.  Cooking time was 30 minutes on the dot. I still can't believe how good it was.

This is a great family recipe. This is one of my teen-age son's favorites. It's easy enough for him to make... I didn't have a packet of taco seasoning, & instead used one small chopped onion, 2 T Chili powder, 1 t Salt, 1/2 t Cumin and 1/2 tsp chopped garlic. Enjoy! Thanks Alyce.

This recipe is a keeper. It has become one of our favorites in our household. Green onions on the tops is great, and sometime we mix refried beans after we layer the meat.

Not to bad as is, so 4 stars! But I have made this  again today but changed to my families liking. Spray casserole dish. Then spread a thin layer of Enchilada sauce on bottom,then layer Burrito size flour Tortillas then layer of refried beans,then rice(Spanish or white),then meat mixture today I used ground beef seasoned with homemade Taco seasoning. very good with shredded chicken as well,then layer of homemade salsa then shredded cheese. Repeat starting with Enchilada sauce.then final layer add more tortillas then a little sauce then shredded cheese. Very filling and a crowd pleaser.

This was fantastic.  We all loved it.  I did add refried beans on top of the bottom layer of the corn tortillas and also added garlic and dried minced onion to the hamburger.  Add extra cheese and used Picante Sauce and not Salsa, no difference.  Do spray the dish before using to prevent sticking.

I changed 3 things as some reviewers said it was dry and bland.  I used canned diced tomatoes with chiles.  I added a layer of colby jack above the ground beef mixture and doubled the salsa.  I didn't find it bland.  It had a little heat with the changes I made and the extra salsa did leave it a little too runny.  I might try to reduce the salsa to 1 1/2 cups next or 1 3/4 cups.  It is not a too die for recipe, but quick and easy and you can add different layers such as refried beans, black olives, green chiles, tomatoes, etc.  It reheated good the next day.  I only served it topped with sour cream.

Don't forget to spray or grease the bottom of your pan or the tortillas will stick.

See the suggestion on how to cut the tortillas to form to the sides.

My fiance is still raving about this! I used Morning Star grounds instead of ground beef (with 1/4 cup water to add some moisture), and added a small can of corn, half a red bell pepper and half an onion, just to add more vegetables, but it would have still been great without those. This is definitely in my keeper list!

Very mediocre as written but could easily be customized to suit one's taste.  The first thing I would add would be fresh cilantro.  If cilantro is out of season, the stuff that comes in the tube in the produce section is wonderful.  I would also ditch the packaged seasoning mix and copy the spice mix from a favorite Mexican recipe.

After I browned and drained the meat, I mixed in the taco seasoning, tomatoes and salsa. Then I spread 9 hard tostada shells with 1/2 can refried beans, and placed everything in an oval casserole dish in 3 layers: 3 shells for each layer, topped with 1/3 of the meat mixture and 1/2 cup cheese. (I increased the amount of cheese to 1-1/2 cup total.) It came out very good. The tostada shells were perfect; soft, but not soggy.

My alterations: Used 2 pounds ground beef and added onion, green bell pepper, fresh tomatoes, taco seasoning, cumin, and granulated garlic. Once cooked I added a can of tomato sauce and a little bit of salsa and heated. I sprayed the pan and then put corn tortillas, meat mixture, cheese, tortillas, meat mixture, homemade enchilada sauce, then cheese. I used about 2 cups cheese.  It was amazing!  My husband, 1 year old, and 3 year old cleaned there plates and asked for more.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It cuts out the need to dip the tortillas in oil before rolling them like in regular enchiladas. I used Boca brand crumbles in place of meat and used the "Taco Seasoning I" instead of packaged mix (I'll never go back!) I also had to add a bit of veg stock & refried beans to moisten & "glue" the Boca together. I also used Rotel in the Boca to give it more spice (I love spice!) and freshly made salsa. It sounds like a lot of modifying but really I just made it vegetarian friendly : )

I like this recipe, however, I used Old El Paso mild enchilada sauce on the bottom to keep the corn tortillas from sticking, and used what I had in the pantry and refrigerator...I used a can of ranch beans by adding it to the meat mixture, and chopped green onions. I layered and used the enchiladas sauce on the bottom of each layer along with cheese and meat mixture, and topped it off with corn tortillas, added one more layer of enchilada sauce, and cheese. Worked nicely..This recipe and style of dish lends itself wonderfully to imagination and diversity.

This is a great recipe! You can make this with whatever you have on hand. I generally omit the tomatos (doesn't need it) and salsa due to preference in my house; I usually cook 1-2 lbs of ground beef and one small onion, then mix in taco seasoning as per package directions. I make a cup of Minute Rice and add it to my hamburger mixture. Rice is so great in this! It also bulks up the hamburger mixture and extends it out a bit for more layers. I layer mixture on bottom, cheese, tortillas (flour in our house--yes I know it's no longer an enchilada--its now a burrito) then repeat. Top layer gets an extra handful of cheesy goodness! Cover with foil, heat through and serve with black olives, salsa, enchilada sauce, guacamole, sour cream....endless possibilities!

Usually the first time I make a recipe I stick to the original.  But this time it seemed too simple so I decided to try this recipe using the advice of others.  I added refried beans with chiles to the first layer and then went I also added black olives to the top layer before it went in the oven.  The fresh lettuce and tomato was a great idea. Next time, I will add cream cheese to the bottom layer instead of refried beans.  And I will add corn and black beans. Both my husband and I loved it and it will be in the rotation.  Only 4 stars because I deviated from the original recipe.

Very yummy. This is a recipe that you can play around with. My husband and I made tacos earlier in the week and made extra seasoned beef keeping this dish in mind to have a few days later. That made this even easier to put together. We have made several variations on this. Sometimes we add a layer of re-fried beans below the meat. We also add sliced black olives and green onions to the top of the cheese. We also add a dollop of sour cream on top before eating. Delicious.

This was so yummy! My husband and five year old both loved it. I used flour tortillas instead of corn. Next time I make this, I will use more cheese and probably add some more layers.

Oh this recipe is so simple and so good! I layered my tortillas differently.  I first spread the beef mixture onto the dish, then I layed 1 tortilla, then beef mixture, then 1 tortilla, then beef mixture then another tortilla.  On top I spread salsa sauce (the one we eat with tostitos).  Lastly, I spread Mozzarella cheese instead of Colby cheese.

I baked mine for around 25 minutes, broiling the top for a few minutes before taking it out to give it a nice colour.  Could it get any simpler?

So good!  My husband said this is one of my best dishes so far!  I put a layer of refried beans on the bottom, then a layer of corn, then tortillas, diced tomato mixed with taco seasoning & cooked rice for vegetarian version or meat mix,  tortillas, salsa, cheese and then topped the finished product with sour cream and tostidos chips.

This is a regular on our menu. Like other reviewers, I always add refried beans on top of the first layer of tortillas. You can add all your favorite toppings. Very good and filling.

I was glad to find this recipe.  I bought a huge bag of corn tortillas, then realized we could never eat all of them.  Now I buy that huge bag of tortillas just so I can make this authentic tasting Mexican dish.  It's easy and I always have the ingredients on hand.  Thanks for sharing it!!!

Wow!!! I honestly didn't think this would be as good as it was. Not that it didn't look tasty, lol, but I figured it would be a quick, decent-tasting weekday meal. It is quick, and it would be great for a weekday, but the taste was awesome! It's filling, and all your meat, tomatoes, and cheese are right there, which is all I eat on a taco, anyways. This will be a regular. Just a word of advice, I would lightly gease or oil the pan: some of the tortillas stuck to the bottom of the Pyrex pan. Thanks a lot for sharing!

This was an easy recipe to make and it was delicious.  I made it on Sunday for company, the same company came over on Friday and requested it, again. The only two variations I made was cheese on every layer and I used tomatoes with jalapenos.  It was great.  Thank you, Alyce.

Great recipe.  It was fast and easy.  The only variation I made was I put cheese on top of the meat mixture before I put the top layer of tortillas and and then on top of the tortillas.  It tasted great, and my family loved it.  I will defintely make this again.

I was pleased with the overall recipe. I use 'mexican style' stewed tomatoes, added onion to the beef mixture and used Monterey Jack cheese between each layer of tortillas.

This was great! I'm not sure how it is with kids since mine is 1 and didn't have it! It was so easy and just tasted wonderful! Definately a keeper. I also just put the refried beans in over the meat mixture. It was not dry at all. Just wonderful!!:-)

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit with my husband.  Following the suggestions of others, I sprayed the pan with non-stick spray, added refried beans, garlic and onion powder and doubled the amount of cheese.  I also used a chipotle-flavored taco seasoning which gave the dish a bit of a smoky flavor. I used a mild salsa, which made it more than spicy enough for me, but my husband would happily have gone with something spicier.  So adjust the recipe to your personal preferences. Much as I love olives, this is not a dish that I'd add olives to because it is already pretty salty.

Loved it! I am a casserole person. This was quick and easy. I used two lbs of ground beef, 2 pkgs taco seasoning, 1 can spicy refried beans, 1 can of rotel and 1 can of mexi-style corn and flour tortilla. I slathered 1/2 of the beans on 2 of the flour tortillas and put them on the bottom of the greased 4.5 x 9 casserole dish. browned the meat with peppers (red & jalepeno) and onion, drained the fat off, added the taco seasonings, the rotel, a cup of water and the drained corn until heated through. They I layered 1/2 the ground beef mix on top of the tortillas and beans. added another layer of tortillas and beans the rest of the ground beef mix and then topped with cheese. backed for .5 hour at 375 degrees. Now while the changes I made do make some difference it should not be as much as you would think. Anyway we loved it! Thanks for the recipe, definitely a keeper.

This lasagna tasted great.  My husband loved it!  The only disappointment to me was the fact that the tortillas disintegrated in the dish.  All the mexican tastes were there, just the texture of the tortillas was missing.  I did add a chopped onion and tubed cilantro while browning the meat, yellow hominy, and more colby cheese, then topped with sliced green onion.    I'll have to do some experimenting with the tortillas for a better outcome!

Loved this! I followed other's suggestions and added a couple of layers. I added onions, garlic powder and a can of chopped mild peppers to the ground beef. I spread refried beans on top of the first layer of tortillas. I made it in this order: tortillas, refried beans, beef, cheese, tortillas, beef cheese, tortillas, salsa and cheese. I also used almost 4 cups of cheese! I topped mine with a little bit of sour cream. Yum!

Mmm...I doubled the recipe and made one for dinner and one for the freezer.  For the filling I added black beans, onions, and egg plant.  From the comments I added an extra layer as well.  We really enjoyed the finished product.

OMG!!! Delicious. I did make a few changes since we like our food a little spicier. I added onions and garlic while browning. We added refried beans with green chile. We used Rotel with green chiles. I did a layering sequence.....tortillas, beans, meat, cheese and repeat. We then added the salsa that we pureed. It was a great dish. NO leftovers.

3.5 stars because I didn't actually follow the recipe. It's a great idea, quick, delicious and easy to cook and alter to ones taste. I browned the beef, cooked chopped white onion some scallions, garlic, green and red peppers, jalepenos, mixed in a can of diced tomatoes, added the beef added some cumin, black pepper and cilantro. I sprayed the bottom of a pyrex with some canola, layered whole wheat flour tortillas, followed by beef and sprinkled some cheese. topped that with tortillas, beef, and cheese. baked for about 10 minutes and let rest. Served with sour cream. Next time will probably add a layer of refried beans to the bottom before the first layer of beef to try it out- this recipe leaves you open to experimentation.

I made with added black beans and a little corn. Good flavors, but very dry. The tortillas disintegrated and the dish was crumbly overall. The added hot sauce and sour cream to my plate helped with this though (and perhaps might push my rating to 4 stars)

Very easy, very good (the best combination!).  Did make some insignificant changes - added refried beans on top of the bottom layer of tortillas and mixed black beans and can of Rotel (in place of tomatoes) in with meat mixture.  How many stars is a meal with no complaints worth?

This was pretty good. I used whole wheat flour tortillas and added black beans to the first layer of shells. I also chopped up an onion and browned it with the meat. I thought it was a bit bland but next time I'll add pepper jack cheese or some jalapenos to kick it up!

This recipe was so yummy and so easy!  I did make a few changes based on other reviews.  Here's what I did, I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and instead of mixing them up with the beef, I used them as an option on top of the lasagna.  I also spread a can of refried beans on the first layer of torillas and instead of using 1/2 of cheese, I used 2 cups!

Great basic start. I added Mexican olives, cilantro, onion, green pepper, corn, black beans, and cumin seed to the meat mixture, and a whole bunch more cheese to the layers. I also did it in 3 layers to give it more of the look of lasagna. Everyone in my house loved it!

Pretty good recipe. Well, I didn't have any taco mix so I used (and loved) Taco Seasoning I. Next time, I will definitely add anoher layer of cheese and tortillas.

Very easy and delicious. Had friends over and they wolfed down 3 large servings and then held their bellies. Like others suggested below, I greased the pan, added Rotel Hot Tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes, sliced jalepenos (I live in Texas, y'all!), black beans and corn. Serving w sour cream is a must! I skipped the salsa. Think it'd also be great with refried beans and rice.

Really good weeknight supper! I added some black beans for some extra fiber. Wegman's salsa worked great b/c its consistency is more like a sauce than a chunky salsa. I used Chi Chi's whole wheat tortillas. They have a soft, chewy texture that went really well with this.

This was excellent!  I made some of the changes that were recommended by other reviewers.  I added a can of refried beans on top of the bottom tortilla layer.  I also sauteed some onions along with the beef when I browned it.  I used jalapeno-style diced tomatoes.  I had to use mozz instead of Colby cheese because my husband won't eat any cheese but mozz, and it was still delicious.  My finicky husband actually had seconds, which is something he hasn't done in years!  I topped my own serving with sour cream.  We decided to freeze half of it for another day.

I followed reviewers suggestions: Cover bottom of pan with enchalada sauce. then flour tortilla, layer of taco meat prepared with onions, layer of cheese, layer of tortilla's covered with refried beans, a bit more cheese, tortilla, cover with enchalada sauce and cover with cheese.  i broiled it after baking @ 350.  cheese on top was GREAT! next time I will try a layer of corn chips for contrasting crunch.  It's a keeper.  It cut perfectly and stayed together.  Yum, Yum.

I had left over taco meat that needed to be used and followed some other reviews by adding refried beans on two layers and tortillas, salsa and cheese for the third and final layer.  I really liked it.  It took just a few minutes to put together and into the oven it went.  It can't get much easier than that.  Thank you.

SOOO YUMMY! I altered it a bit though: added 3 cloves of minced garlic and 1/4 minced jalapeno (for spice) to the meat when I added the taco seasoning; also made my own taco seasoning using just a few ingredients (1 tablespoon chili powder, 1 teaspoon ground cumin, 1/2 teaspoon paprika, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt..if you like spicy add 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper) and it came out flavorful and delicious! Bake time will vary but it took me about 25  minutes to cook thoroughly. Will definitely make this for years to come... Thanks for the excellent meal idea!

Very good. I sprayed the bottom with Pam. I also added a layer of refried beans. I used about 2.5 cups of cheese and it still wasn't ooey gooey as I would have liked. Also cooked for 10 minutes longer at 375.

Yummy! I have already made it twice.
I did add some refried beans to my meat mixture & since I ran out of salsa, used enchilada sauce for the topping (then the cheese).

Sooo good. I basically only used the recipe as an outline and the reviews of others to add on and make a mexican lasagna. It turned out great! I wanted more layers but I only had a few tortillas left in my house, and did not want to get more, so I used tortilla chips for a layer which also gave a crunch to it. Upon the advice of other reviews I used refried beans and a whole lotta cheese. My lasagna was layered as follows : tortillas, refried beans, meat mixture, cheese, crunched up tortilla chips, meat mixture, tortillas, salsa, cheese. It was very filling and easy to make. Not even a lot of clean up afterwords. My 3-year old even liked it. I will definatly be making this again.

This was pretty good. I used flour torillas instead of corn and used mexican cheese. I also put foil down be for I started to layer it. That made it easier to cut and get out of the dish. This was a little different than the norm but it was good. I will make this again.

This recipe was incredibly easy to make!  I made a few adjustments though:

-substituted ground turkey for ground beef
-used diced tomatoes with green chilies instead
-replaced with whole wheat tortillas
-replaced with jalapeno jack cheese
-added 1 can of beans (I've used pinto and black)
-added 1 can of corn

This recipe is so versatile you can add virtually anything and it'll be great!  Thanks for the recipe Alyce!

This was easy to make and we thought it was pretty tasty. The tortillas did stick to the bottom the pan. I sprinked some cheddar on top of the meat before layering with the remaining tortillas, then sprinkled cheese on top. Covering the pan with foil before baking did prevent the top layer of tortillas from drying out.

This Mexican lasagna was tasty and filling and was also really easy to make.  I used cheddar cheese instead of Colby, and I made sure to spray my baking dish with cooking spray so that the tortillas wouldn't stick.  Next time, I'll add refried beans and sour cream to give it more flavor.

Yum! I modified the recipe, but used this as the base. I mixed refried beans, sour cream, and salsa together and sauteed green peppers and onions in with the meat and tomatoes. My layers went: tortilla, refried bean mix, meat mix, cheese, repeat. Super easy and so good! My husband ate three helpings.

This was very good with a few adjustments. I used flour tortillas instead of corn. I cooked the meat in fresh garlic and onions and I added pinto beans and fresh cilantro to each layer. I also used twice as much cheese and put it on both layers instead of just the top. Also, I used half verde sauce (as suggested by someone else) and half salsa. It was great topped with fresh chopped tomatoes, black olives and sour cream. Thanks for the recipe!

Better than I thought it would be. Added 1/2 cup chopped onions to the beef when browning. Added a layer of pinto beans and olives. Used about 3 cups Mexican style cheese, for my cheese loving family. Ommited salsa and served with salsa verde, sour cream and mexican rice on the side. My picky husband loved it and my 5 year old asked to have it again the next night!

Very quick and easy.  It was quite tasty although I only gave it 4 stars because it was really good but not extraordinary.  I also added another layer with refried beans as some had suggested which helped.  This is a great meal for during the week and my whole family ate it and liked it.  Thanks!

Nice new twist to the good ol' taco!  Just cheese and beef between the shells and everyone can make the meal their own with their own topings (sour cream, salsa, onions, etc) Easy and very yummy!

This was fabulous, but I tweaked it a lot (both on purpose and on accident). First, I finely shredded up leftover pork roast and reheated it with taco seasonings and a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles. In an 8x8 glass pan I layered corn tortillas, meat mixture, cheese, more tortillas, refried beans, more meat, and cheese. (I forgot the salsa in that step) I served it with diced olives on top, and with sour cream and salsa on the side. It got rave reviews all around and will be great tomorrow for lunch. I guess it was because I forgot the salsa, but it wasn't soggy at all. Be sure to spray the pan!

This is a great recipe.  It is so easy to make and it tastes great.  I substited ground turkey, fat free cheese, and no salt tomatoes to make it lighter.  It tasted great.  Make sure you spray your pan with a non-stick spray.  I learned the hard way.

I didn't give it a 5 because it lacked something. Probably refried beans. Next time I'll layer it more and use flour tortillas. Thank you.

This is so easy and delicious. I made it a couple of times and we love it. Even my husband could make this!!! I actually used flour tortillas because I read the recipe wrong. It was fabulous. I just used less tortillas. The only caution is to not let the tortillas overlap because the bottom one doesnt get cooked. I bet corn tortillas are healthier I'll try them next time.

Great recipe. I increased the cheese and salsa (Personal taste). Next time I think I will add sliced olives and sour cream to the layers before baking. Tasty and perfect when served with a tossed salad!

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe the first time we made it, and changed the beef part to refried and black beans seasoned w/ the taco seasoning for vegetarians.  We just made it for our Cinco de Mayo party and everyone that ate it loved it!  It's so easy, quick, and you can add or take away anything you want w/o taking away any of the great taste and fun of eating it.

This dish was SO easy and delicious! I am not a big Mexican food eater (my husband is) and I was expecting to "tolerate" this recipe- but it was actually really, really good! I, too, added refried beans to the layers and served with sour cream, cheese and chopped green onions. This will definitely be joining our regular "rotation"! Yum!

Easy to make, feeds alot of people. However the sour cream and additional toppings are a must! I've made this twice and forgot the extra toppings because they are not on the ingredient list the 2cnd time, big mistake. Great easy family dish.

I used chicken instead of beef and it worked out just as well. I even added rice and black beans to the chicken layer for some extra bulk. It went over great and I will make again!

Loved it - especially after I used my powdered chili, fresh cilantro and garlic browned with the meat - and added fresh jalapenos, green pepper and onion to the mixture.  With the corn tortillas on the bottom, I covered them with 1/2 the mixture, layered cottage cheese in the center and topped it with remaining half of mixture. then topped it with corn tortillas and just over 2 cups of extra sharp cheddar over all.  When it came out of the oven, I spread fresh Picante sauce on top and served it with iceberg lettuce and sour cream over each square.  It is absolutely scrumptious!

I've made this recipe for years but I don't use tomatoes. I've also found that mixing the refried beans into the meat mixture makes them easier to spread on the layers.

My family is ecstatic every time I make this!  I make a vegetarian version using tofu crumbles instead of ground beef.  It is seriously delicious and meat eaters never even realize the difference.  Here are my changes and layers:
1.  spinach tortillas from Whole Foods bakery.  seriously do it.
2.  i fold the tortillas in half and tear them, flat side facing out
3.  i use wax paper to line the pan
4.  1st layer tortillas
5.  2nd layer Rosita's veggie refried beans
6.  Boca crumbles (seasoned just like the beef with McKormick's original taco seasoning in a skillet first)
7.  Mateo's medium salsa
8.  Shredded mexican cheese (sargento)
9.  2nd layer tortillas
10.  more beans
11.  rest of boca crumbles
12.  cheese
13.  3rd layer tortillas
14.  rest of 1 can of beans
15.  salsa
16.  fresh cilantro spread out
17.  sliced jalapeno's
18.  rest of cheese

It bakes perfectly in 20-25 minutes, and if you make some guacamole on the side that is all you need to make this meal perfecto!!  Muchas gracias for the base recipe idea!!!

I love this mexican lasagna recipe. I did tweak it alittle when reading the other ppls comments. Instead of diced tomatoes I used the ones that have green chilies in it and I added a layer of sour cream after the meat filling. I did tortilla, meat miz, sour cream, cheese, and repeat. YUM!

Amazing! So flavorful. Not to mention quick and easy, and budget friendly. The only changes I made was adding two layers of corn, and I used mozzarella because that's all I had. Everyone loved it. And even my extremely picky four year old declared this to be the "best dinner ever". That means something, because we only get to hear this about once a year. Everything else he hates.
Leftovers were also delicious warmed up in the microwave. The leftovers did not make it through the night.

I highly recommend this one.

Delicious quick meal!! I used ground turkey and wheat tortillas to make it a little more healthful and it was still great!!  I also mixed green onions in the meat mixture for extra flavor. Topped it off with enchilada sauce, green onion and melted cheese..YUMMY!!!

I used a 10 oz can of rotel in place of the can of diced tomatoes.  I also followed other recommendations to add onion to the beef while it's cooking, then stir in some refried beans.  With the gluten-free taco seasoning from Trader Joe's, this dish was HOT! My hubby and I both enjoyed it and are taking the leftovers in our lunchboxes tomorrow.

So delicious and easy! I spiced the meat myself instead of using a pre-packaged spice packet. My husband already asked me to make it again and I just made it yesterday.

This came out dry and pretty tasteless. I even used chipotle tomatoes to give it a little kick. I added beans and corn to the filling. 1/2 cup of cheese is pretty skimpy. I added about three cups total. I added about 1 1/2 cups to the meat layer. Still dry. Sour cream for the topping is a must.

fat free zesty salsa refried beans (2 cans)
A LOT of mexican blend shredded cheese
1-28 ounce can la victoria red enchilada sauce

This was really good, but I think it needed a little more corn tortillas or maybe even top with some crunchy tortilla chips. I will make it again, though. Thanks :)

I took advice from other cooks on this one and added refried beans on top of the tortillas. Once it was finished baking I topped with a little shredded lettuce and low fat sour cream...very tasty!!

This was so yummy!  I thought it was too good to be true, it looked so easy and not that many ingredients.  It's true.  Great.  I did add onion to my ground beef and some garlic powder.  Also added some sour cream to one layer of the lasagna.  I used nearly two cups of cheese, but you don't need quite that much.  Maybe one cup.  It was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a good base dish to customize depending on what your family likes, I'm going to ad beans and chicken and more cheese. Overall, it's a great dish!

This was really good.  My husband loved it.  I thought one layer was fine, but if I had a big family adding a layer would be a good way to make the meal go further.  I did spray the pan with cooking spray and added non-fat refried beans as a bottom layer.  Other than that, I eye-balled the amount of cheese to what I thought was good (I'm not a big cheese person and also used low-fat Mexican blend cheese).  I also added fresh chopped tomatoes to the beef rather than canned (as one reviewer suggested), but at the end of the day I don't think it made a difference.  I served it with chopped romaine lettuce, vine-ripe tomatoes, salsa and sour cream. It's an easy recipe and we both really enjoyed it, so upon my husband's enthusiastic request, it is making its way into my regular rotation.  Thanks!

This was a good basic recipe but the tomato flavor was a bit too strong for us so I'm thinking of modifying it by substituting crushed tomatoes for the diced tomatoes, as well as using half as much and replacing the rest with kidney or pinto beans. Also might top it with enchilada sauce instead of salsa.

Followed exactly down to the corn tortillas, only I used chredded cheddar cheese instead due to what I had on hand. The taste is great, but honestly, I didn't like the corn tortillas in this much, and neither did my kids. They were too mushy for us. I will try again with flour tortillas. I think It would be much more consistent as a texture. Thanks for sharing!

First off, my hubby gave this a "THUMBS UP," so I will definitely be making this again. I made a few changes, only because I am another lover of cheese... and garlic, so used a LOT of garlic powder, and doubled the hamburger. And cheese, I used 16 oz of Colby-Jack. I did as many suggested, and sprayed the pan 1st. Then added some salsa (just a little... before I put the corn tortillas in. (I spread refried beans on each of them before I put them in the pan to make things easier. I also did not use whole tomatoes, but added a few smaller cans of enchilada sauce and one small can of tomato sauce, since that was on hand. (My hubby doesn't care for dry food). I made sure my enchilada sauce was HOT, and the salsa! I did it in layers too! We topped it off with sour cream.           D E L I C I O U S!  The only thing is, next time I won't add the tomato sauce, and I think it will be perfect! Plus, I'll make sure I have some guacamole... and add olives. MAHALO for a very versatile recipe. YUM! : )

This was excellent and not messy at all like I thought it would be.  I used flour tortillas instead of corn and layered it as follows: tortillas, mexican blend of cheese, crushed corn chips, meat mixture, 1/3 chopped onion, fresh diced tomato, salsa, cheese, tortillas, cheese.  Amazingly my extremely picky kids tried it and both said they wanted to eat it.  (I baked it for less than 15 minutes)

This is a frequent staple in our house.  Sometimes I mix it up and will use a green salsa, & have even added black beans as a layer.  Yum!

This was easy to make on a work/school night and the 9x13 pan was eaten entirely by four people. Using flour tortillas, I added the layer of beans at the bottom like suggested and found the layer very isolated. I also thought the salsa was a little out of place. Next time I will probably layer all ingredients equally. Oh, and i used 2 cups of cheese and thought it still wasnt enough.

This recipe is the bomb!  My husband loved it and ask that it be a regular.  I also spread refried beans on the tortilla's before layering.  I split it up in two pans (there are only two of us) and gave the others to some friends.  They loved it too.  We even ate all the leftovers.

Great flavor. Everyone loved it even my one year old nephew. I added chopped onion when cooking beef. Made three layers of tortillas and lots of cheese.

I've made this three times and it is quite tasty.  I took the advice of previous reviews and added refried beans on top of the tortillas.  A keeper!

Although I changed it up a little bit by using flour tortillas instead of corn it was yuuummy. I will be using it again and again. I also want to add I have four kids and they loved it too.

This was good, I used Rotel original for the recipe and it's got a nice zip to it.  I also did spread refried beans over the tortillas, just a small amount but I think it did add to the flavor.  Topped each piece with some shredded lettuce and sour cream, Yummy!!  Thank You!

Excellent!  We prefer black beans over refried beans as other reviewers suggested, and ground turkey, so I cooked the ground turkey with seasoning (used chili powder and cumin instead of taco mix) and then mixed in the black beans and some corn with the meat and tomatoes (added a chopped fresh jalepeno for spice)as it finished cooking - then layered tortilla-meat-cheese and repeat!  It was awesome and there was not one crumb left!  Will make again!

I love love love this recipe! I did make a few changes-used flour tortillas, also instead of using chopped tomatoes I mixed salsa and sour cream into the cooked beef mixture.  It came out absolutely delicious.

I think this is a good base recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers & added (refried) beans to the bottom layer of tortilla's. I also used 6 tortilla's for my layers. Layers: Tortilla's-refried beans-meat mix-cheese-tortilla's-meat-plops of salsa that has corn in it-a little bit of cheese & I reserved about 1/2 c. of cheese for after I take it out....I LIKE CHEESE! Next time I will add more salsa plops & possibly more corn & diced green chili's to the meat mix.

Took me no time to make.  It was very good.  I recommend Rotel tomatoes, they are a bit spicy but add a good flavor.

This was quite good as is, but I felt it was a little plain.  I did make half of it with added montery jack with jalapeno cheese, and that half was better.  Might try this with chicken instead, as we dont like beans.  Overall a good recipe.

Super easy, pretty good!  I asked my husband what he thought and he said if it's easy and fast to make, it's great! If not, it's just okay.  Nothing fancy, but good eats.  Added kidney beans and olives, and cheese on every layer. Served with fresh tomato, onion, lettuce and sour cream.

Talk about easy and tasty.  This one definitley makes the rotation as a quick weeknight meal.  I doubled it and put one in the freezer for another night.  I served it with Mexican rice and refried beans.

Well I loved this recipe!! I used whole wheat tortillas and had to omit the tomatoes (I was dealing with a picky eater) and it was still great. I spayed a glass baking dish with PAM and put a layer of tortillas. Then I layered a can of refried beans, then half of the hamburg mix, then half of the cheese. I snuck in a bit of taco sauce (If my sister had know she wouldn't have eaten it. hehe) then another layer of tortillas and then the rest of the hamburg and the rest of the cheese. Baked at 350 for 20 minutes and it was amazing. 

Side note: Make sure you ask people if they like refried beans... my sister didn't and after all the changes I made to the recipe she still wouldn't eat it cause of that. But I lOVED it!!!

This deserves 10 stars.  It is simple and tastes great.  I've made this a few times and my family always enjoys it.  Most times, I make this at the same time I making a traditional lasagna.  I usually freeze one or the other.  Freezes well.  Gotta try this...it's great!

This recipe works really well for a weeknight supper. It goes together quickly and tastes great.  I added a very thin layer of sauce to the bottom of the dish to prevent sticking as suggested by earlier reviewers.  I also added a layer of refried beans on top of the first layer of tortillas, and added some corn to the meat mixture.

This a great recipe that uses ingredients that I normally have on hand.  I added an extra layer of tortillas and a little extra tomato sauce and salsa (the tortillas soak up the sauce!)and sometimes I throw in some black beans.  Everyone loves this.  I serve it with Mexican Rice II from this site.  Thanks for this easy family pleaser!

This was good and easy.  My husband loved it.  I used 8 oz of medium cheddar cheese instead of colby, and taco sauce instead of salsa.  I also used flour tortillas, but they became very tough, so next time I'll try the corn.

Great recipe!

We really liked this one. I put a layer of sour cream over the first layer of tortillas, and used ground turkey with hot taco seasoning. I used a blend of cheddar/jack cheese. Other reviews are right, you do need more than 1/2 cup cheese!

Yum, yum!  I used ground chicken rather than ground beef, and if we're being honest, used a lot closer to half a pound of colby jack cheese rather than half a cup.  Ummmm, cheese!  I also added a diced onion to the meat mixture.  This was quite good, and a fun idea.  I agree with a previous reviewer:  try it with the corn tortillas.  I'm not normally a big fan of corn tortillas, but they were absolutely fabulous in this.  I served this with sour cream and avocado on the side.  Delicious!  Thanks!

I liked this recipe, but my husband loved it!  I think this is a good "husband" recipe because of large quantity of meat. :-)  I made minor changes like adding half a can of refried black beans to the meat and using spicy canned tomatoes with green chiles like other reviewers suggested.  I think when I make it again I will add another layer of corn tortillas as I think that the flavor of the corn tortillas really makes the dish.  I would recommend against skipping these and using flour tortillas, corn is so flavorful and authentic tasting.

This is a great base recipe.  I added a lot of different ingredients to suit my tastes.  I also used flour torts instead and the rotel like someone suggested.

This was very easy and good.  I put about 2 cups of cheese on top, feeling like we'd hardly notice 1/2 cup.  I garnished with sour cream and next time would also add sliced olives.

My husband loved this recipe. It was easy enough to cut in half, and I will certainly be making again. Thanks for the easy Mexican-flavored meal.

This was very yummy! It smelled wonderful in the oven - had my hubby sniffing around shortly after making it. I used flour tortilla's instead of corn and added some cheese to the beef mixture as we are cheese lovers.  I did not have any salsa on hand and instead used some Taco Sauce to pour over the tortilla's and that was really very good.  We served with sour cream and even my 3 year old ate some.  Thank you! This one is definitely a keeper!

Very tasty!  Made servings for 7 adults. We added refried beans spread just below the cheese and held the salsa in a side dish w/ sour cream for optional use.  Came out very good, might use flour tortillas next time and some Fritos chips for crunch.

I tried this recipe with a few changes. I did not use Colby cheese, instead I used a Cheddar/Jack mix, I used enchilada sauce instead of salsa. I already had taco meat left over so I diced up some potatoes very tiny and fried them, when they were half way finished I added the meat. It gave the dish a wonderful texture and flavor! My husband had his friends over for dinner and they ate them all up! I will definately make again.

Great recipe.  Made it last night and everyone loved it and wants it to be made again.  Very easy to make so it is no problem coming in from a day of work and making it.  I did use a can of Rotel tomatoes instead and also added some refried beens and extra cheese.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

My son and I aren't very big tomato fans, so I was a little worried about making this recipe. I decided to make it for a church covered dish - that was if we didn't like it I wouldn't have a ton that went to waste.  Well, turns out both my son and I loved it!  He told me I definatly need to make it again for dinner one night.  It was very easy to fix, and had a great flavor.  I think I'll experament with adding different foods/spices (one review said they added a can of corn - I can see that being good).  I can't wait to make it again!

YUMMY!!  This is great!  The only change I made was that instead of salsa I used taco sauce.  I don't like salsa.  My kids really liked it.  I like that the recipe is so versatile, you can add to your taste and it would still be great!

This was very good!  We used rotel tomatoes instead of plain tomatoes and used a mexican blend cheese instead of colby and it was very good.  My mom thought it was a little spicy (which it was) so for those of you that don't like spice, use the regular tomatoes the recipe calls for.  I may use the suggestion from earlier posts and put in a layer of refried beans next time.  Very quick and easy!

Very fast and easy! I followed the recipe exactly but made my own salsa following the garlic salsa recipe on here (I also rated it)... Didn't use all of the beef mixture (drained it a lot) and I used more tortillas then it called for to make a thick bottom. Also used twice as much cheese as called for. Yummy!

This recipe was good and very easy, however instead of colby, I used a Mexican cheese mix and put cheese in the lasgna as well as on top.  I also served sour cream on the side, it was delicious!

Excellent.  My husband loved it.  I add a layer of shredded lettuce and sour cream.  Also, I added corn to the mixture.  Next time I will use a smaller pan and make the filling 'thicker.'

I think this is a great recipe; however I did make a few changes.  I used flour tortilla's instead of corn.  I also made more layers.  I put the tortillas, meat with refried beans instead of tomatoes, cheese, tortilla, then layered one more time and added the salsa and cheese. I will definately make this again!!

As written, probably 4 stars but with all the fixings definately a 5.
I took some of the other suggestions like olives and sour cream but I also added my own twist.
I created a layer of equal parts sour cream and cream cheese which I mixed with just a tiny bit of the taco seasoning to give it some flavour.  Because it was soft I easily spread it over the tortillas before I put down olives, salsa, shredded tex mex cheese mix and then the meat.  I repeated the same thing for the top layers except I ended with shredded cheese.  I did have to cover it though while it cooked because I didn't want to burn the top layer of cheese.
It was an excellent idea and a neat twist on tacos and lasagne.  Enjoy!!!

Nice and easy. I added mexican corn to the meat mix and added some shredded Cheddar/Jack cheese in between the layers and on top. I also added  a little chopped jalapeno to the mix (my family loves spicy stuff), served it with Spanish Rice and Refried beans, and they were lovin it!!! Thank you for a great recipe.

Oh, this was so good.  I wasn't expecting much from this recipe.  My three little boys have such a hard time eating tacos, I thought we would try this instead.  It was divine!  I think next time I might add corn or potatoes to give a few more vitamins in disguise.  We all loved it very much!

This was good, but I didn't like the texture.  A few more layers might've been better.  Serving this with lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream is a must!  The next day, my husband mashed up the leftovers and used it as a dip for nachos.  Very tasty!

Very easy and very good!  I used whole wheat flour tortillas and also added a can a kidney beans to the meat mixture.  Definitely serve with sour cream for the best taste.  I also served this with diced onions, tomatoes and lettuce.  Will definitely make this again!

My whole family loved it!  We added more cheese than the recipe calls for.  Also, 2 of my boys don't like the tomatoes, so next time we'll try it with tomato sauce.  Served with sour cream - yummy!

My husband and I really liked this.  It was very simple and delicious.  His coworkers were so jealous when he took this for dinner.  We will definately make it again.

A very quick and tasty recipe!  I don't eat beef, so I substituted ground turkey, and I also used flour tortillas.  My husband loved this, and I'm sure I'll be making it again soon!

Someone else's tip about using Pam (or another similar spray) on the bottom was a help. We use flour tortillas instead of corn, and add cheese to each layer.  Delicious and very easy!!  I brought leftovers to work for lunch and shared the recipe with several coworkers, who all loved it.  Definitely a new favorite!

EXCELLENT!  And low-cal, also!  This is my first week cooking (I'm 35 - don't ask)  BUT, this was very good, very quick, and very EASY!

I loved this dish, as did the entire family we had over for dinner!!  Very filling!  Most importantly, the recipe was easy to do and quick!  We will definitely be eating it again!  I did spray the baking dish so nothing was stuck to it, and I added much more cheese than what was called for.  Thank you for this great lasagna!

I loved this recipie!  It was very tasty and easy to make.  I noticed some other reviews mentioned it was dry.  I did not find this to be true, as when I made it I did not drain the beef or the tomatoes, so there was plenty of liquid and it came out moist yet firm enough that it didn't fall apart.  I forgot to add the salsa on top, but it was delicious anyway.  I'll definitely make this again.

Pretty good flavor but the recipe turned out rather dry.  It wasn't very "leftover-friendly" either.

I was skeptical at first--I was afraid this would turn out to be a gooey mess.  It baked up firm, tasted delicious and was made from ingredients I usually have on hand.

Easy weeknight meal! I have made this several times and am just barely getting around to reviewing it.  I took the suggestion of other reviewers by spraying the baking dish with cooking spray, spreading a layer of refried beans on the first layer of tortillas plus adding more layers and more cheese.  I also replaced the diced tomatoes with canned green chiles because having diced tomatoes and salsa would be too much tomato for me.  Served with Mexican Rice on the side and sour cream & hot sauce on top!

I kept to the recipe except for having smaller serving sizes.  I cut it up into 8 portions and I at one and my husband had 2 servings.  Trying to keep our calories lower. Next time I will add greek yogurt on top with cilantro and extra salsa. I used fresh salsa in the recipe.  It was light and delicious.

Loved loved loved! We greased the pan as others did. We also added cilantro in the meat and then on top of the casserole along with pico when it was done.  Kids loved it as well and devoured the entire thing. Will absolutely make again!

To serve 4, I saut√©ed onions with 3/4 lb. ground turkey, mixing in 1/2 env. low-sodium Taco seasoning plus one can green enchilada sauce and 1/2 can Rotel tomatoes. Then added 1/2 can pinto beans.  I sprayed Pam on a 2 1/2 qt. Oval baking dish before placing 3 corn tortillas on the bottom. Then layered 1/2 meat mixture. Next layer was a mix of 1 cup ricotta cheese, 1 egg and 1/2 cup Mexican cheese. Repeated tortillas, meat mixture and finally more cheese. Spread sliced black olives on top, then baked 30 min. at 350 degrees.  Hubby loved it.

My picky husband and I both loved this. I did like so many others suggested, and sprayed the pan with cooking spray beforehand. I added Rotel diced tomatoes instead of plain tomatoes, and did add the refried beans as others suggested. Oh, and added a lot more cheese. I can't rate this recipe as is, apparently, but we did love it as it ended up. Next time, I will probably add some corn or maybe even guacamole.

My family LOVED it!  It was very tasty and I wil make it again.  I tweeked a few things, I added onion and green pepper to the ground beef, and I also added another layer of corn tortillas, I lined the bottom layer with torillas, meat,  salsa and cheeses, then another layer tortillas meat,  salsa and cheeses, then topped with tortillas, salsa and cheeses.  My husband prefers spicy food, so I also added jalepons to half of the Lasagna.  I had sour cream with mine and we had salad as a side.

I mostly followed the recipe. The changes I made were I spread a can of refried beans over the bottom of the pan, added a can of pinto beans and 3 cloves garlic to the meat mixture, and used 3 Tbl taco seasoning.  Next time I would use 4 Tbl taco seasoning and add the salsa to the meat mixture.  It was delicious!

I made this tonight with just a couple changes:
1) browned ground beef, drained then added diced tomatoes, chopped onion, minced garlic, chopped jalape√±o and taco seasoning. 
2) sprayed cooking pan with non stick spray
3) laid flour tortillas topped with re fried beans, then meat mixture then shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheese, another layer just like this, then a layer of tortilla shells topped with salsa and shredded cheeses and black olives. 
4) baked 350 for 25 minutes

It was good but nothing over the top, certainly glad I added the jalape√±o, garlic, onion and tomatoes to meat mixture or this would have been very bland.

I have made this many times for my family and for my coworkers for a potluck.  It's a hit every time I make it and I always get recipe requests.  I  usually make it exactly like the recipe, but sometimes swap out for lower sodium versions of the soups.  I have also topped it off with shredded lettuce, sour cream, and chopped tomatoes.

Just made this tonight! Very simple and everyone loved it, even my 16 mos old! I like a lot of others added things like onions green peppers rites tomatoes tomatillos cilantro green chiles and refried beans. But I also precooked the tortillas before layering them so they wouldnt new too mushy. Worked great. Will definitely make again!

This was a really easy meal. I changed up a few things. As directed by others my first layer was beans second layer beef. But I added my homemade green chili to it as well. It was so yummy my family ate the whole thing. Ty for the idea.

I made this for dinner last night and my boyfriend really enjoyed it. I took some suggestions and added a few extra touches. 
1) I used corn tortillas. I sprayed the bottom of the dish with cooking spray and then later 6 small tortillas down. 
2) Next I spread half a can of refried beans on the tortillas. 
3) Third I took half my ground turkey mixture (I added a small diced onion and next time I may try some garlic and diced jalopanos as well) on top of the refried beans and then I sprinkled a half a cup of cheese over that. 
4) I added the second layer of tortillas, the second layer of the ground turkey mixture and then I drizzled that layer with taco sauce. 
5) Finally I added the last layer of tortillas as well as the salsa and almost 2 cups of cheese. (We use lowfat cheese so a little extra won't hurt). 

The end result was amazing. I used a little sour cream and my boyfriend used some salsa. We both had enough for lunch the next day and leftovers for a night from now!

This was pretty tasty. I used my own seasonings not prepackaged stuff. I didn't add the salsa but instead used a can of refried beans on the bottom of the pan to keep things from being dry. It was easy and yummy! We liked it and would definitely make it again!

This was an easy to make and easy to alter recipe. The wife and kids want me to sign up for a cooking show on television. I added refried beans to the first layer. Easy prep, easy cooking, and know easy clean up because it is all gone!
Thanks All.

I made this with cooking spray on the bottom. Then a layer of flour tortillas,  cheese with enchilada sauce, and then the taco meat. Last but not least I put a layer of salsa mixed with sour cream, another layer of tortillas then the major layer of cheese. Yummy yummy yummy!!! I love Allrecipes

So....family did like this recipe. However, I think it could have used a bit more sauce, like a regular lasagna. We will definitely be making again, flavors are good. I did make some changes: used lasagna noodles, because hubby just didn't want it with corn tortillas. I added a layer of cheese over meat, a blend of ricotta, sour cream, cilantro, mexican blend shredded and salsa). Like I said, we will definitely make again, and I will do the corn tortillas for myself next time (I also have to modify with a veggie sub for meat, due to vegetarian) but I am looking forward to it. Thanks!

This was delicious!  I really took liberties with the recipe, though, to make with what I had on hand.  I used a Bird's Eye recipe ready mix for tacos with corn, onions, peppers and black beans and mixed it in with the beef, salsa and taco seasoning.  Layered with meat mixture and cheese.  Topped with last layer of corn tortillas, rest of jar of salsa and cheese.  I would recommend coating bottom with a layer of salsa, as the bottom shells were inedible.  Other than that, awesome, will make again soon!

This recipe is one of the most versatile recipes ever made! You can alter literally everything to your family's wants and needs, and come up with something delicious. Just use this recipe as ground for personal expansion! I used ground turkey with a chipotle taco seasoning, cooked with onions, red bell pepper, and green chilis. Layered with far more cheese than called for (1/2 cup, what?!), corn, black beans, chopped roma tomatoes, and went lightly on an enchilada sauce, which you can always add more to individual portions depending on peoples taste. Will make again and again, probably switching up ingredients to alter the taste a little bit here and there.

Simple, but really good.  I didn't have Colby so I used a mix of Monterey jack and cheddar.  I only had 8 corn tortillas, so I tore some up to make for a perfect fit.  This gave me the perfect amount of corn consistency.

I don't know what I was expecting but I thought the tortillas were too "mushy".  I added corn, black beans, garlic, onions and cumin/seasonings.  It had good flavor but the consistency wasn't what I thought it would be.  However, the family loved it.  Served it with hubby's guacamole.  Thought this was a good basic recipe and maybe I'll play around with flour tortillas or different corn tortillas to see if that makes a difference.  It's too hard to find a recipe that everyone will eat so won't give up on it yet.

This was really easy to make.  I couldn't find corn tortillas, so I used whole wheat.  I also used a can of refried beans as the first layer on the tortillas.  A can of Aylmer Accent diced tomatoes with chillies adds enough heat and fresh salsa and pepper jack cheese on top made this dish incredible.  Super yummy!!!!

great! Added another layer with beans and cheese and used 2 cups of cheese instead. Will make again but plan to put some crunched tortilla chips on top for texture.

Um.....yum!

I made a version of this for a New Years eve get together at a friend's house.  Everyone loved it!  I doubled the recipe, used fresh tomatoes instead of canned, added a chopped jalepeno, cup of corn and a cup of black beans to the meat mixture.  I used corn and flour tortillas together as a layer, I added layers of refried beans.  All together I used over 2 cups of mont jack cheese.  Served with nachos, quac and sour cream!  Delicious!  Thanks the the idea!  I rated it a 4 but really before my changes, it's probably a 2.5-3

This wasn't very good.  It was way to meaty and dry in the center with soggy corn tortillas.  The campbells taco bake is a much better version of this.

Thia was fast, good and an easy recipe to play with. I made kind of a lot of changes. I added some of my bottled hot peppers, red beans and about 3/4 cup sour cream to the meat mixture. I used flour tortillas and rolled them up because I don't like trying to evenly spread round tortillas in a rectangle pan and I used cheddar and monterey jack cheese (a lot more thaat 1/2 cup) and put some in each tortilla and then put some of the meat mixture on top and covered with cheese.

This was a good recipe, but I made a few changes.  I added onions, 1 cup of brown rice, jalapeno, and a few other seasonings.  I didn't feel that there would be enough to fill everyone up, so I made these additions.  Everyone loves it and I have made it several times.

This is very easy and quick to make.  I followed the recipe except for using flour tortillas as that is all I had.  Topped with salsa, green olives and sour cream. This is a keeper!

Excellent recipe-my whole family loved it.  I tweaked the recipe somewhat and added two layers with refried beans and fresh homemade salsa and extra cheese.  It was a real hit!  Tastes great with sour cream. I will definitely make this one again.

Made it as stated but used flour tortillas instead of corn. Turned out great. I think using good salsa instead of generic salsa set it off.

This was delicious and very easy! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used ground turkey instead of beef: 1) Grease the pan, 2) Cook a chopped onion with turkey, and 3) Layer tortilla, refried beans, turkey, cheese, tortilla, beans, turkey, tortilla, salsa, cheese.

This was a very easy recipe. I added the refried beans and used flour tortillas for two layers and also a layer of round corn tortilla chips too. The amount of cheese the recipe calls for is not enough. I used probably over 2 cups of cheese easily. Some Colby Jack and some shredded Mexican blend cheese. A dallop of guacamole and sour cream made it even better. But really needed hot sauce. I think this is a really great recipe if you ever have left over taco meat.

The flavor and texture were off in this dish. There needed to be crunch and everything was mush. The family ate it, but the left overs went untouched.

This was very good but reminded me of eating enchiladas. Nothing wrong with that..just saying what it tasted liked. I kinda wanted more flavor so i suppose i could add other things to make that happen.

I made this late in the afternoon and left in teh warm oven so it would be ready to just reheat when I got home at 5pm for dinner. When I got home my DH had already helped himself - to half of it - and it makes a lot!!! No leftovers for lunch for me tomorrow. I did as a few other reviewers sugested and added refried beans and sour cream. Very good and easy recipe!!

My husband is not a huge fan of Mexican food, and even he enjoyed this.  I added black beans to the meat, and would consider adding refried beans next time to help the layers remain cohesive.  I followed the suggestion in other reviews to make a third layer to give it more of a "lasagna-look".  Very tasty!

I also made more layers and used more cheese. I used a combo of colby and monterey. I also added some sliced olives just because I had some and the family loves them. Served with  sour cream and guacamole. Disappeared fast.

This was pretty tasty! I did add a can of fat free refried beans and a cup of frozen corn kernels to  themeat mixture to stretch it a little bit because I wanted more layers. I did 4 layers in all. I also drizzled sour cream and sprinkled cheese between all the layers. Thank you :)

We added some bulk to the recipe to make it more filling.  I followed the basic but added one can of drained black beans, 1 cup of frozen corn, used 2% mexican cheese and made a total of three layers.  We cut it into 8 servings for about 360 kcal.  Served it alongside spanish rice and a side salad.  Yum!

This is SUPER good! I didn't have any canned tomatoes like I thought I did, so I substituted a can of pinto beans and a can of corn. The corn added a nice almost "crunch" to it. This is a keeper!

Tasty! I used flour tortillas, ground turkey instead of beef, 2 cups of salsa and 2 cups of cheese. I also added refried beans (put a layer on top the tortillas), and added a can of drained kidney beans. I baked it covered for about 35 min. and removed the cover and baked 10 more min. Once I got it out of the oven I let it set for about 10 min. before serving. It was yummy! I will be fixing this again.

quick and tasty - used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies - delicious, but too spicy for the kids

This was so good. I used the flour tortillas, and on the first layer of tortillas, I added the refried beans before the meat sauce,as another reviewer did. Also added about another cup and a half of cheese,divided on the first layer, and top per another reviewer. I loved it, and so did my teenage grand-daughter, and her mom and dad. Thanks for posting this recipe, Alyce.

Quote from my 5-year old daughter: "This is great. I would eat this every night for the next hundred years!" The only changes I made were to make extra layers and to put a layer of refried black beans on top of the tortillas layer. I tore up the tortillas by hand and used a little more cheese since I put it between the layers as well as on top of the whole thing. Delicious!

This recipe was GREAT!!!  I made a few slight changes.  I split the meat as 1/2 beef and 1/2 turkey.  I browned in a skillet and added the tomatoes, peppers and onions, black beans, and taco seasoning.  I put a little of the mixture in the bottom of the dish and layered with whole wheat tortillas, cheese and the meat mixture.  I added the salsa and about 3/4 cup of Mexican cheese on top.  I served it with the Spanish rice recipe from this site and everyone raved about it.  Thanks for the great recipe.  :-)

Good satisfying meal.  I served it with spanish rice, lettuce & salsa and the meal was complete. There are similar recipes on this site that are a little more involved, but sometimes simple is better.

My Husband and I loved this. 
When I made it, he said "Did you cook this?" When I confirmed he said "We're never eating out again!" :-D Lol. 
I really liked it, but next time I will be more creative... maybe add a layer of spicy re-fried beans or olives. This is also a great freezer recipe for a small family. I made it and split it into two 10x10s, we ate one and froze the other to save it for later. 
Thanks for sharing!

This was so easy to make and it tasted great.  My usually picky husband and kids loved it.  I added baked beans under the hamburger and sour cream and black olives when served.  I will definately add this recipe to our monthly menu!

Not bad at all.  I plan to make it again and make a few changes. I'm not a fan of taco seasoning, so I left it out and I'm afraid it was just a tad bland.  So next time I think I will add some enchilada sauce to the meat.  I also like the idea of adding a layer of beans, so I'll try that too.

This was ok.  I'm giving it 4 stars because my husband loved it.  I felt it needed something more.  Maybe next time I'll top it with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and maybe some avocado.

5 Stars only with the suggestions made by broken wings.  I sprayed my pan with Pam.  I layered it with corn tortillas, then a can of refried beans, then the meat mixture, and some cheese.  Repeat.  I put a 3rd layer of tortillas on top, then the salsa, and a little more cheese.  This was so good.  If you want it spicy, use hot salsa or tomatoes with chilis.  A keeper!

I made this tonight for dinner since I had everything on hand. It was really delish.  I did fry a  half a bell pepper and a quarter onion minced with some garlic too. Just to kick it up a notch. 
My husband, who always claims not to like Mexican, loved it - he went back for 2nds. Quick & easy - tweek as you like.

This was great. I added some corn (and MUCH more cheese) as per one of the reviews, which I thought was a great touch. I made it for dinner last night and my fiance and his parents thought it was delicious! We had it with avocado, diced tomato and sour cream. Thanks for sharing, I'll definitely be making this one again.

Very, very good!  My husband and son just raved and raved!  I did add a can of corn, a layer of fat free refried beans, more (low fat) shredded cheese, a diced onion, and substituted salsa for the can of diced tomatoes, and topped w/ low fat sour cream.  Next time I will add black olives too.  This would work well w/ ground turkey breast making a health-conscious meal.  Really fast, easy and delicious.  Will definitely make again...would be a great potluck.  Thanks!

This turned out delicious and my husband ate 3/4 of the pan by himself!! I actually messed up and added the salsa with the tomatoes to the meat, so I made it like Italian lasagna and made two layers of tortillas, meat/tomatoes and cheese. It turned out super!

Very good! I added a can of fiesta corn and omitted the salsa because I did not have any. I also used flour tortillas and 2 cups of mexican-blend cheese because we love cheese! And I threw in some red pepper flakes to give it a kick. My 3-year-old didn't really like it but all the adults ate it up!

This was a fantastic weeknight dinner.  It went together so easily.  One thing I'd suggest is to make sure you find a salsa that's low in sugar.  Some of the more popular salsas are loaded with sugar and I think that would make it taste weird.  I used a black bean and corn salsa and it was awesome.

I needed a something different for dinner and this was it. I added Pinto beans per my husbands request. I also had to reduce taco seasoning so my kids would be able to eat it.
Very good!!

I thought this was really good, I also added beans and olives and used a pre-packages mexcan cheese blend. It was a lot like enchiladas only a lot easier and not so messy to make, and leftovers that actually get eaten!

I was glad to find this recipe after returning from vacation and needing to feed my family quickly! Because I had to just use what we had in the house I used a can of stewed tomatoes with peppers and onions that I diced myself, I used flour tortillas, added black beans on top of the beef, and used cheddar cheese instead of colby.  We topped it with shredded lettuce, black olives and sour creams and EVERYONE wanted seconds!  Next time I'll double the recipe! :)

Very good.  It was quick and easy- great for a meal after a long day at work.  I used the Taco Seasoning I recipe for the seasoning.  It also was better after resting a few minutes.

This has 5 star potential but I did think it was rather bland on it's own. I added black beans to the layers this time but next time I will add more cheese, veggies, sour cream and scallions. It was something different though and very easy to make.

This is a fun and easy recipe. I made for my roommates and they loved it! It was so good! Instead of using corn tortillas, I use flour ones. I personally think it tastes better!

I make this frequently instead of the typical tacos b/c casseroles are so easy.  I use lots or refried bean on ours, though and hold the hot stuff b/c of kids!

I liked this more than my husband.  For some reason the tortillas on the bottom got hard.  We have a similar recipe but use croissant "dough" into a pie pan, and my husband wants to stick with that recipe.

Used ground turkey, flour tortillas (approx 7 fajita size tortillas total, each ripped in half to better line the pan) and added a can of garbanzo beans for extra body (should have mashed up the beans).  Will try adding refried beans instead next time to "bind it together"--was a touch watery.  Used 1 cup of shredded cheese total, 1/2 cup on the meat and 1/2 cup on the top.  Very easy and tasty!

My family loves this recipe.  I have made it many times.  I have made it exactly as listed and I have also done it with adding refried beans and an extra layer of tortillas.  This just helps the meal serve more people.

This is great! I highly recommend it. Very tasty. For a bit more oomph, try using a tex mex cheese mix (with jalapeno peppers). I used more than half a cup (but I loooooove cheese). :) I used an 8x8 dish instead and it was fine.. although I did not use all the tortillas (used flour ones instead). I loved the ones on the bottom that weren't as baked (this may sound weird, but it tasted good!).  This is a very easy recipe that tastes great!

The recipe as written was just OK but it certainly has a lot of potential.  I am going to try this again adding roasted green chili peppers, onion, and a lot more cheese, 1/2 cup is not even enough to taste.

This was GREAT!!  We made ours really spicy and added a fresh sliced tomato to the top.  There are so many ways to vary this, and I like that.  Thanks for a recipe I'll use again and again!

This recipe was good as printed, but its the kind of recipe you can tweek to just your liking. I added black olives, extra cheese, and a little sour cream for the top. Season it up or down depending on your family's preference. This was great the first night and great heated up. I even liked it cold. Its a quick fun dish worth making again!

This is really good and very easy to make.  I tweeked it a bit by also adding black beans and corn on top of the hamburger mixture.  This will definately be a regular in my house!!  Be sure to top with lettuce and sour cream and it's perfect.

This was an incredibly good (and easy) recipe. I added refried beans and mozarella cheese to it. I layered the tortillas twice and put some of the tomato, refried beans, beef mixture on top of the last tortilla layer before adding the cheddar cheese. (Could also use Mexican cheddar mix). This is excellent. My husband asked for it again tonight! Thanks!

This was so simple and it tasted good, so that means it is a keeper.  As stated by a few other, I added olives over the meat and after cooking dalloped with sour cream.

This was an easy & inexpensive dish to make..My husband & I both liked it & it was also tasty re-heated-I didn't use additional toppings but I have now added them to the list of ingredients so not to be forgotten next time. Adding a dollop of sour cream,a pinch of cheese & and an olive or two would certainly add to the esthetic appeal & would make everyone believe it was harder to create.

My husband and my 15 year ate the whole dish and loved it. If you have big eaters I recommend making a larger dish. Maybe more layers? We added shredded lettuce, black olives and sour cream. I also have a 5 1/2 month old so easy recipes are what matters to me and this was one of them!!

Excellent!!  My one suggestion is to spritz the pan a little with Pam or whatever as the bottom layer of tortillas stuck to the pan.  Otherwise it is a keeper! Thanks!!!

It was a hit...going to add it to our weekly menus to rotate it in every three weeks.  I accidently used medium slasa instead of the mild so my daughter (2) didn't eat too much, but that was my fault.

I really like this recipe it was EASY and GOOD but, it was DRY.  It was missing something.  I think I will try it again but, I have to figure out whats missing.  I added sliced black olives to the top before cooking and It was a very good addition

I make this at least once a week and my family still can't get enough of it.  It is wonderful!
