I wasn't holding my breath for this to be good but WOW was I wrong!  This instantly became my new favorite summertime salad!  It's one of those things that needs to be tried to be believed, so I really do hope you give it a try soon!

Truly amazing combination of sweet, salty, juicy and crunchy.
I have made this summer salad a few times and have never met anyone who does not like it. Always a winner !
