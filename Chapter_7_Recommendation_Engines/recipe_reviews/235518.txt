Followed the recipe to the letter, tasted, and thought the flavor was just a little weak and wanted the texture a little thicker.  I added more cheese, a little salt, and thickened with additional flour (all may just be personal preference).  This has a nice cheesy flavor, but then that layer of apple flavor follows and, finally, a little zing from the dash of the hot sauce is in the background.  This would be a nice to serve as an appetizer soup for Thanksgiving.  chrisdwilliams, we enjoyed your recipe, it's a keeper!

We all liked this (2 adults, 1 toddler). I think probably the apples should be cooked separately so that you can mix the cheese into the roux rather than melting it into the hot liquidy soup. I didn't do that this time and regret it because the texture wasn't what I think it could be. Tasted fine, though, if a bit thinner than I'd like. I think I'd cut back on some of the liquid in the future to thicken it up a bit. Served it with crusty rolls and sides of roasted broccoli (which tasted great as a soup topper, too!) Thanks for sharing!

I saw this Apple and Cheddar Soup referenced in a novel, so I thought I would try to make some. 
This recipe is easy. I had no dry mustard, so I substituted 2 tsp. of prepared Dijon mustard. I thought it needed a little something, so I garnished the soup with crisp bacon. That gave it some saltiness an texture. It was well received by my family.

I had some organic Gala apples that were getting old, and an 8-ounce package of cheddar cheese slices, so I made this soup and thought it was a bit bland, so I added a pinch of caraway seed and of celery seed -- so delicious! So happy for this great new recipe!
