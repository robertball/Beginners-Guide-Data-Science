Looking on the bright side of things, I gave myself a good laugh on a lazy summer afternoon with this one!  I looked at all of the steps involved in making one little mug cake and almost wrote this one off...but it *was* a pretty boring afternoon so I though I'd give it a shot anyway.  I kind of giggled my way through preparing the entire recipe.  The dough balls took a full Tbsp and a half more flour than called for to even reach a point where they could be handled and formed much less not be sticky.  The amount of dough it made created more like dime/nickel sized dough balls rather than quarters.  The sauce that goes over the top was, lets just say...abundant.  Even if there weren't any issues with this recipe there is no possible way this would cook through in the microwave in one minute.  So with a sideways laugh I threw this guy in the microwave- definitely with a plate underneath.  Thankfully I thought ahead, since as you can see in the picture I took just for laughs this would have made one heck of a mess on the bottom of my microwave had I not!  Not only did the sauce mixture make a huge mess but the dough balls disintegrated.  Definitely steer clear of this one and check out another recipe for Monkey Bread to handle that craving.  :-)

It ended up mixing into what can only be described as an overcooked streusel. While I should have known it wouldn't cook right from just reading the recipe, it was a waste of ingredients and time.

I followed the recipe, but doubled it for 2 servings. It started out okay but by the end, it was obvious that there was too much butter and sugar in the recipe. I will try it again but will reduce both the sugar and butter content. I'll give another review to say whether it was better or hopeless after my second try.
