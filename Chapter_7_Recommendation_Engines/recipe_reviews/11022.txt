This is actually my recipe and it just dawned on me that I should have listed the size of eggs that I used for this recipe.  This may be the reason that one reviewer had some difficulty with crumbling.  I use 2 Extra Large eggs for this recipe.

I tried this recipe this past Christmas for my Mom's Christmas cookie give-away.  She put them on her tray to take to her office and my phone did not stop ringing for the recipe!  They are amazing!  One of the best cookie recipes that I have ever tried!

My family loved this recipe. I substituted a half cup butter for half a cup of the shortening, and I added half a package of good-quality white chocolate chips. I also made them as drop cookies instead of chilling them.

there is something drastically wrong with this recipe.  After chilling the logs the are impossible to slice.  I finally crumbled the logs and added another egg and a bit of milk to get a cookie batter texture.  THEN they were good!

I think these cookies are great!  My family just loves them too.  Very easy to make and rather than chill them in the fridge I just dropped them as drop cookies!  Worked great.

Maybe it's personal preference. I enjoy macadamia but when put with oatmeal cookies, was a bit too much for me. Was little too sweet too. Would cut sugar by 1/4 each next time.

Easily the best oatmeal cookie recipe that I've ever tried!  I did opt to use the dough and make drop cookies, rather than refrigerated/sliced, with wonderful results!! Thanks Sue!

These were dry and lacked flavor. The macadamia nuts didn't seem to go right with the oatmeal either.

A friend of my husband had requested me to make him oatmeal macadamia nuts, which led me to find this recipe. I changed a few things based on other reviewers' comments and what I thought would make these better. First, I used 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening instead of the full cup shortening. I also used 3 large eggs. I upped the vanilla extract to 2 teaspoons and added a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. I did also end up adding about a tablespoon of milk to make the dough a better consistancy. I made drop cookies instead of freezing them. The guy I made these for absolutely loved them. I, who am a sweet lover, thought they were a bit bland and would probably increase the cinnamon if I made them for myself. I have to give 5 stars even if I did make some changes because Oatmeal Macadamia Nut cookies aren't very popular and I would've been in a rut without this recipe. Thanks!

My favorite oatmeal cookie recipe so far (and I've tried quite a few)!  These still came out great even though I made a few changes due to ingredients I didn't have an hand.  I substitued 1/4 cup margarine (then added 3/4 shortening), used walnuts, and almond extract.  They were easy to shape into logs and equally easy to cut.  I will definitely make these again.

these spread way too far out and thin.  Will need to add 1/4 c. extra flour next time I try these.  They were thin and almost transparent this time.

I added Coconut, so I cut back a 1/4 c sugar and I added a coffee elixir and cut back by the amount of Vanilla extract.  They were delicious!

I refrigerated the dough for 24 hours and it is still a big sticky mess.  No way it can be cut.  It's very liquid.

The cookies spread out in a thin sheet that covered my whole cookie sheet.  In spite of being so thin it took forever to even begin to get done.  I like soft cookies so usually will go a little under the time.  I added about 8 minutes as it was still batter at 10 minutes).  I measured everything precisely.  Lots of times I guess on salt or vanilla but I actually used a measuring spoon as this was a first time recipe for me.

If anything I was expecting my batter to be dry as my eggs were very small.  I did not melt the shortening or do anything like that.

  I thought the taste was just okay.  One thing that may have hurt - I chopped my nuts in the food processor so they were in mostly small pieces.  I put in more than 1/2 c. also.  None of this should have made it thin.  I couldn't really taste the macadamian nuts at all unless I came across a big piece.

I think next time I'd use a tried and true oatmeal cookie recipe and just add the nuts to it.

Great, but a little too sweet. How refreshing to find a macadamia recipe WITHOUT white chocolate! These are great cookies--easy to make and well behaved on the baking tray! I did find them too sweet, so am going to try them again with less sugar...will let you know how it goes!

This cookie recipe is rich. It is so yum! I made them for my son's batting coach. He told me he liked oatmeal cookies with nuts. He will be the taste tester for me.
