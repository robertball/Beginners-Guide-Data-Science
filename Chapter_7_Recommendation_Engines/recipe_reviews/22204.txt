Nummy! And so very, very easy! Like another lady who posted a review, I also used a blend of ketchup and BBQ sauce in the absence of chili sauce. And it turned out great. The nicest part is that I did it in the crock pot...put everything in at lunch time, and it was ready for dinner. If you want to try it in the crock pot, I put it in for four hours at High, then did one more hour with the lid off , stirring every once in a while, so the sauce would thicken up. Crock pot is definitely the way to go. I also slided the bricket very thin, adn returned it to the sauce for a few minutes. Then piled it onto fresh kaiser buns. Wow!

This is a great recipe.  As with everyone, I played with the ingredients though.  The night before I rubbed the meat down with salt, pepper and paprika and then put chopped onions and garlic under and over it.  I increased all ingredients so that I was sure to have plenty of sauce.  I opted for a combo of chili sauce, ketchup and a bit of barbecue sauce.  I also used Goodmans soup mix which isn't heavy on the dehydrated onions.   It was absolutely perfect.

This was good and very easy.  I would make this again, but I do have a better brisket recipe (it takes a lot time and effort).  The brisket was very tender.

I saw this recipe demonstrated on Gary Collin's old TV show (I think it was called "Home') around 11 or 12 years ago. I've been making it ever since. It's an easy way to impress your dinner guests. Everyone loves it. Maybe everyone knows this, but the chili sauce is the kind that is next to the ketchup in the supermarket, not salsa or taco sauce.

This was soooo easy and a huge hit! I prepared the brisket with a dry rub of garlic salt, pepper, and paprika. Then I used Gates BBQ sauce instead of chili sauce, a can of C2 (the lower-carb coke), and the soup mix. I put it all in the crockpot about noon on low and left for the day. When we came home around six, it was done and the house smelled great! We used the left-overs the next day for sandwiches. I am a real novice when it comes to cooking so I was impressed at how easy it was to make a restaurant-quality brisket. I will definitely be making this again!

This is an incredibly easy and delicious recipe. I used my slow cooker and baked it at 300 for 4-5 hours. (Just watch it well because the carmel in the Pepsi will burn if it's left too high without ample liquid.) I added an extra half can of Pepsi at the last hour to make a bit more liquid to cook 2 briskets at once. My father who eats nothing "new" had seconds on this one! Mom is jealous cause he never tries "new" stuff at home, but will eat it at our house :) I thought the Pepsi would scare him away but he cleaned the plate and he is a PICKY eater!! Kids loved it too!!!

I love this recipe.  It is so easy and feeds a crowd.  I have made it 3 times now, always in the crock pot, and it comes out so tender and flavorful. I serve it with mashed potatoes/w butter  and a veggie.  Definately a keeper!

I trimmed the fat off my 2.5 lb brisket and made the recipe as written. It was awesome. I served it with salad, roasted new potatoes and brussels sprouts. My husband wants me to throw  away my other brisket recipes and serve this often. Thank you!

I read all of the reviews and decided to try it. My family and I love it. I make it in the crock pot and it turns out great. With the leftovers the next day I shred it and make BBQ sandwiches. It is easy and delicious.

This was great!  Like other viewers, I didn't have chili sauce so I used bbq sauce.  Cooked in my crockpot on low for 10-1/2 hrs. Very flavorful (I used a spicy bbq sauce).

I really improvised and used Dr. Pepper instead of cola, Kraft Original BBQ sauce instead of chili sauce, and added a bit of liquid smoke.  I used a 5-pound brisket and baked it at 250 degrees for 6 hours.  It was SO tender.  I thickened the sauce with a little flour/water and ladled it over the meat.  I'll make this again!

So easy, and such wonderful flavor!  I served it with corn on the cob, baked beans, a salad, and French bread.  My roaster was large, and I didn't get a good seal on the aluminum foil that I used to cover it.  Sadly, the meat dried out.  Not the recipe's fault!  I think next time I'll try it with a slow cooker.  Thanks for the recipe!

Thought this recipe was wonderful and easy.  I did trim the brisket before cooking.  Guests could not believe that I made the BBQ sauce that the dish produced, and they wanted to know what I put in it.  Everyone was impressed.  Thanks.

If I could give it more stars I would. It's easy to shove in the oven. There aren't too many ingredients so if I'm at the store and decide to make it, I can remember all what is needed. It's moist and flavorful. The meat falls apart when done correctly.

I made a similar version tonight and it was so good! I used a roast and added a jar of Heinz 57 chili sauce, 2 garlic cloves and a can of coke. You can cook your carrots and potatoes right in the crockpot and the result is just a really tasty dinner that's both savory and sweet.

I tried a slightly revised version of this recipe, adding real onion slices instead of the powder. Overall, it turned out fine. I enjoyed the slightly sweet and spicy taste from the cola and the chile. Actually, I was expecting a strong syrupy taste but was pleasantly surprised. At 325, the beef came out tender and juicy, making for several fine meals that go well with mashed potatoes or rice. However, I felt the recipe could be jazzed up a bit without overpowering the natural beef flavor. To round out and complement the sweet, spicy BBQ flavor perhaps rub a little coarse sea salt (one or two teaspoons) or even add a bit of thyme to give it a more complex flavor.

My family loves this recipe and they say it is better than the beef brisket we had in Texas.  I think they would eat it every week if they could!

My husband could eat brisket every day if you'd let him.  I made this and he fell in love.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because I wish the sauce was thicker.  Next time I'll use 2 bottles of chile sauce.

I made this recipe for a large crowd on Sunday after church.   I used pork sirloin roast instead of beef.  I bought 9 lbs of meat and cooked in the crock pot in two batches using the ingredient amounts as given in each batch. I omitted the step of cooking with the lid open and opted to loosely break he meat up in the liquid and letting the meat absorbed the flavors of the sauce over night. I served it as sandwiches with bottled BBQ sauce on the side.  Everyone loved it.  Since I had some left over, I served it again to a couple of different "drop in" guests and got rave reviews once again.

Delicious and simple!  I seasoned my brisket with garlic salt, pepper and paprika.  I only has about 8 oz of chili sauce so I filled in the rest with bbq sauce.  Worked beautifully!  It cooked on low for about 8 hours and was tender and perfect.

The kids like this one. I'm still on the fence with it though. I didn't hate it but I think it was just a little too sweey for me. But it was simple so I do thank you for the recipe. Plus no kids were unhappy. So, untimately I was happy too.

This was great. I am really not good with cooking meat in the crockpot, I have trouble with them getting dried out and burned, never tender adn that is with half the cooking time but I was able to get this to turn out great and it tasted great too. All I had was diet vanilla coke and I just didn't think that was going to work so I used a can of beef consomme instead. I ran out of chile sauce and added ketchup to make the difference. Thanks, this was great and I made a roast in my crockpot that didn't taste burnt!

I've made a variation of this recipe for years and it's a family favorite. Instead of cola, my version calls for a bottle of beer. Add that to the chili sauce, onion soup mixture and pour it over the brisket after the brisket has cooked for 45 minutes on each side. Once the sauce has been added cook for another 90 minutes. The beef is tender and the sauce is tangy and delicious!!

Reading through reviews, I too changed it up just a tad. First , I use buffalo... The night before, I rubbed the brisket with chili powder mixture I like called ChugWater Chili. A blend of red chili, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, brown sugar, masa, and 6 secret spices.... and sprinkled liquid smoke on it.  Rolled and wrapped it in plastic wrap.  Before I put it in the oven, I seared it on a really hot grill, the poured mesquite smoke to it from a wood chip fire box in my grill for about 20 minutes with no other heat.  I stuck to, but doubled the sauce recipe..... and it is marvelous!!

This is very good... I cook mine in the crock pot and I use barbecue sauce instead of chili sauce...It comes out pretty sweet so you have to like that sort of combo with meat but it is sooo tender and makes really good sandwiches!

This recipe was delicious!  My husband and I both 
thoroughly enjoyed it.  I didn't have chile sauce so I used enchilada sauce
instead and I cooked it in a crock pot.  I will definitely make this again!

Fantastic recipe and so easy to make!  Simple ingredients, wonderful prep time, and enjoyed by everyone at our table.  They were so impressed!  Paired well with Baked Sweet Potatoes (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/baked-sweet-potatoes/detail.aspx)

Came home to the whole house smellin' gooooood! A fantastic dinner for a rainy, autumn evening :)  The sauce was just amazing... I added some red pepper flakes just because its my new favorite thing, and slow cooked it. Served with new potatoes & asparagus.

How can something so simple be SO good! I've never made brisket before because I was always a little intimidated to do so, but when I came across this recipe and read the reviews, I thought "what could go wrong?" And nothing did! I made the recipe as it was written and my family loved it, it was so tender and moist and the sauce it made was very tasty.  I added a little cornstarch to thicking it up.Other than that I thought the recipe was wonderful...meat good, sauce good...what's not to like! :-)

Made this yesterday using a 5 pound brisket. I used two packages of onion soup mix and only one can of Coke. Cooked on high in the slow cooker for about six hours. I shredded the meat and put on sandwiches. It was very tender and had a nice flavor but I think I would like to have more flavor so I will experiment with adding other seasonings. It turned out more like BBQ instead of brisket.

This brisket definately turned out nice and tender.  I didn't have chili sauce, so I used a bottle of chipotle taco sauce with the cola and onion soup mix.  Nice flavor!  I baked a 4 pound brisket, so next time I might double the sauce ingredients. Very easy recipe! Thank you for sharing.

The only ingredient I had from this recipe was the cola.  I replaced the chile sauce with salsa, and the onion soup with a Perfect Potatoes seasonings packet.  Plus, the brisket sat in marinade for 1 1/2 days prior to cooking.  It was GREAT!  I cooked two briskets (in a crock pot) with the intention of freezing one for later.  I didn't waste my time.  We finished it in three days.  Finger-lickin' good---literally.  :-)

This was delicious!  I was afraid the meat was going to dry out because I cooked on low for 12 hours in the crockpot (work), but it was so good!  My brother and son loved it!  I told my brother that I had substituted ketchup instead of chile sauce with sriracha and he actually said don't care it was perfect, remember what you did.  I used a 4.5 lb of brisket so I used 1.5 cans of Kroger pure sugar cola with a dash of liquid smoke and Worcestershire.  I only used 1 package of onion mix.  I squirted about 1.5 cups of k

This was delicious and so easy.  But I think it needs to cook longer to be falling-apart good.  I even turned up the temp the last hour, and used the convection cooking mode, but it still was quite "together".

I cook this in the crockpot with a pork roast and love it! I add a little cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce for gravy.  I season the leftovers with a little taco seasoning and make enchiladas the next day.

Everyone loved it! Cooked longer than required - turning to low for last hour. Meat became tender and flavor was great! Used Vernors Ginger Ale instead of Cola. Couldn't find Chili Sauce, so used Valentina Extra Hot Mexican Sauce (about 6 oz.). That makes it quite spicy...so if you don't like a lot of spice (and a little heat), get the regular Valentina Picante Sauce (yellow label).

Crock Pot Directions: trim fat if desired. May add flavor, but may thin sauce. Add all ingredients after stirring in bowl. 4 hours on high. Then 1 more hour with cover off. Then slice against the grain and add to the sauce to coat while you prepare some sides.  I recommend mashed potatoes or bread for the extra sauce.   This is extremely easy and delicious.

Tried this recipe on Sunday my family really didn't care for it. I even added some garlic to give it some flavor.  It was like eating beef with a sweet ketchup on it. Will not be making this again. I also prepared mine the crock pot. Thanks anyway!

I cooked this in the crock pot, and it turned out pretty good.  I was skeptical about the cola, but the overall flavor was nice.  My fiance loved it, but I thought it was just good.  It was very tender.

I will say it tasted much better the next day.

This was good barbecue. I made mine in the crockpot and cooked it on low for about 8 hours. The sauce was really good and very sweet. I will definitely make it again because it was so easy.
