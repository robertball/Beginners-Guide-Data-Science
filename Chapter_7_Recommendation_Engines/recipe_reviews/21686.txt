This was amazing! Made a few changes though:  sauteed some chopped yellow onion and a few chopped mushrooms in a bit of oil before adding 8 oz of microwaved & drained spinach.  Also threw in about 1/2 c chopped sun dried tomatoes.  Drained cottage cheese and mixed in with the spinach, then poured the whole thing into a greased pie plate.  I sprinkled with about 1/2 c grated asiago cheese and then poured 6 beaten eggs over the top. Baked for about 50 min at 375. The sun dried tomatoes and asiago really gave the dish a lovely flavor.

A delicious non-crust quiche. I followed the advice of an earlier poster and replaced the croutons with a mix of seasoned breadcrumbs plus grated parmesan. Delicious! The only thing I'd add is to leave about 10 minutes after cooking for the quiche to set.

This is great.  My husband told me I outdid myself on this one.  But squeeze liquid out of spinach, or it will come out when baking.

I looked at all the diffrent suggestions and just went for it with this recipe. I used Ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  Since it was before payay, I mixed and matched diffrent cheeses (smoked gouda, cheddar and mozerella) till I reached 2 cups. I put it in a store bought roll out crust, and added a few cooked slices of turkey bacon in the mix, and garlic powder 1 teasp.  WOW was it good.  Great basic recipe to mix and match.  I loved it!

I just loved this.  I am a Personal Chef and after a day long cooking session I am too tired to cook.  So, I tried this but added leftover artichoke hearts (chopped), feta cheese chunks, some hot sauce and for the topping used Pringles new Potato Parm chips crumbled up.  It is great with tomato/red onion salad and lovely heated up the next morning in the toaster oven for breakfast.  Very versitile recipe which I will be using for my clients.

I have been looking for a recipe to recreate the filling in Panera's spinach and artichoke souffle.  This is as close as I've been able to get!!  I substituted the cheese for a tub of Asiago/Parmesan/Romano blend.  A whole tub made it VERY tasty but too salty.  I'll do half and half with the cheeses next time.  I added chopped artichoke hearts, too, and two additional eggs.  This is a delicious recipe I'll be using again and again!  Thanks!

Lovely. I actually made these last night but didn't bake until this morning. Added about 1.5 cloves of garlic, along with salt and pepper. The only thing I would change is to saute the green onions and garlic before adding the spinach. Loved the fact that there wasn't a crust!

This was my first time making quiche. I found this recipe to be very easy. I also used lowfat cottage cheese and lowfat cheese instead and it was still very good.

I'm going LowCarb and this was right up there with only 5 net carbs per serving, according to my LIFEFORM nutritional program.   I did modify this recipe somewhat, but the "core," of the recipe was all there for me.  I used fresh (9-1/2 oz.) spinach.  I cooked a small amount of onion and garlic in a 1 T. each EVOO and butter, added 6 oz. of fresh sliced mushrooms (per a previous reviewer) and the spinach on top of that.  I just cooked till the water was gone and added it to the other ingredients.  I used full fat everything including 3 oz. of Monterey Jack and 3 oz. of Sharp Cheddar cheeses.  This quiche definely needs a little crunch, so instead of the croutons, I used Baked Kale Chips by Lucy DelRey (here on allrecipes),  sprinkled on top of each quiche when I served them.    We loved it!

This is excellent.. have made it many times... I add some garlic and I use six blend Italian cheese instead of the cheddar.. or you can mix them.. I think it reheats great.. I have also used fresh mushrooms and when I do I lightly sautee them with the garlic and onions before I add to the recipe.... a keeper... great for low carb diets and very filling

This was the best quiche we ever had.  I didn't know how the cottage cheese would work but now I'm going to use this as the base for all my quiche.  I did put it in a pie shell - and please remember to let it sit at least a half hour before cutting.  Dianne V

Very tasty!  I didn't know what to expect using cottage cheese but since I had a tub of it in the fridge, I thought I'd give it a try.  I didn't have green onions so I used yellow and my cheese was actually a cheddar/monterey jack mix.  I left the croutons off and didn't use a crust to save on the carbs and it turned out very well!  Next time, I'll add more spinach because I want to make it more dense.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time making a quiche, and I cannot believe how easy and delicious it was!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and made a few changes. I used fresh spinach that I  wilted first with a spritz of olive oil.  I also added artichoke hearts.  I tried a combination of chive cottage cheese, asagio/parm/romano blend, and shredded cheddar.  I also added 2 extra eggs and had enough filling for 2 pie crusts (no croutons).  I made them to serve at Christmas and had none left over, so I've already made it again.  This time I added   some diced ham.  A keeper!

Very good basic quiche recipe. I have used this often as a base to make quiche. I often use gruyere and gouda cheeses and some goat cheese (about 6 ounces) and I leave out the cottage cheese. I also saute half a large yellow onion with garlic and then I cook that with the spinach (i've also used fresh baby spinach). Sometimes I put in roasted red peppers, ham, smoked salmon or other things for flavor. Try using spike seasoning as well.

For this recipe I made a few changes to make it lower in fat...1. Used 1 cup of  southwestern egg beaters instead of the eggs 2. Replaced cheeses with fat free ones 3. Cut the spinach down to 8 oz. 4. Removed croutons from recipe.  With these changes I calculated each serving to be approximately 115 calories and

I changed this recipe by adding about 1/2 cup of feta to the cottage cheese and leaving out the bread crumbs.  I put a cup of shredded parmesan on top instead. It's very spinachy-just the way my family likes it!

Pretty good.  I topped it with crushed Ritz crackers instead of croutons.  I suppose you could top it with parmesan cheese instead as well.  My husband thought I should decrease the amount of green onions if I made it again.

Being a poor college student I don't have an oven and all I had was a skillet.  I was hankering for a quiche so I looked at the tons of bags of frozen spinach I still had and decided I could make a pure crustless quiche in that skillet and boy oh boy was it very very tasty.  I first sauteed half an onion (NOT AN OPTION FOLKS!) I then used requezon (spanish ricotta) and then some colby and cheddar and some slices of bread (yes bread) and it came out absolutely fabulous!  
People would call me crazy for not baking quiche but I'll be honest and say that it tastes absolutely wonderful either way.  Thanks for the recipe!

I loved this, I only had some of a 16oz. tub of sour cream, so I tried it using that. It puffed up beautifully and it was done in the 45 min. I used monterey jack cheese instead of the cheddar and put the top of foccacia-bread crumbs on the top and put it back in the oven for 10 min. and it was beautiful!! I will make it again and use more spice if I use the sour cream. Thank you for a great quiche recipe Bettina, when you don't have a crust!!!!!!! God Bless!!!!!!!

Very tasty . You can substitute the cheeses with 1 c. crimbled feta cheese.  (If too salty, soak for about 1 hr. in fresh milk, drain before using)
Use 1 more egg, also add 1/2 c. whole milk  3 tbsp. flour and chopped  fresh mint and basil leaves (about 1 1/2 tbsp. of  each. (Use the green parts of the onions also, just cut them about 1/2 inch long)

I made a lot of changes. Truly what I prepared is a cross between this, the recipe for bacon cheese frittata and my own creation. I not only made the changes based on my personal tastes, but also to use up ingredients.

I drained the chopped spinach using the fantastic tip provided by another user who advised the use of a potato ricer. Worked great! I heated the spinach in the microwave with about 1 T of butter. I chopped 2 green onions, light portions only, 2 Roma tomatoes, a handful of  drained marinated artichoke hearts and 6 peppadews. I cooked 12 slices of bacon, crumbled it and reserved half for the top. Into the bowl with the above ingredients, I also added 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese, about a cup each of cream cheese and sour cream (I didn't have cottage cheese) and 1 cup heavy cream. Stirred and added salt and pepper to taste.  I beat 8 (to finish carton) eggs and then added those. Poured this into my baking dish, which I placed on top of a cookie sheet because I was afraid it would spill. Baked about 30 minutes at 350. Added a mix of more shredded cheddar, crushed Ritz crackers and the reserved bacon to the top. Before returning to the oven, I put tin foil around the edges so it wouldn't overcook. I also lowered the temp to 325 and baked another 10 or so minutes until just done. Let set for about 15 minutes. This was my first quiche/frittatta and not only was it lovely, but it was also delicious.

This quiche is excellent.  I made it recently for a bridal shower and was surprised at how much everyone loved it.  There were no left-overs and everyone wanted the recipe.  I added a little bit of cubed ham to one and made the other exactly as written.

WOW! I added garlic (a MUST)and used 1/2 italian blend cheese with 1/2 chedder!!!!  A little nutmeg and no salt brings it all together!  This recipe seems to be forgiving enough to be very creative!

I made this for brunch today and though the texture and flavor was overall good, the spinach taste was a little too strong.  If I made it again, I would cut back on the spinach.

Wow, this was easy to make and fairly cheap too. I'm a beginer when it comes to cooking but there wasn't really anything hard about this. It tasted great too. I changed a couple things though. I left out the green onions and replaced them with baby bella mushrooms and instead of frozen spinach I used fresh and cut it up myself.
One word of warning. Try to remove as much moisture from the ingredients as you can before baking (cottage cheese, spinach, etc). By the time I removed it from my quiche dish it looked like a pile instead of a slice.

This was an easy and very "yummy" Quiche. I did make a few changes. I used a deep dish pan so I increased the eggs to 8. I also used fresh spinach, increasing that by a hand full. I am Gluten free so I used the ends of a gluten free multigrain bread and ran it through a processor, added the same amount cheese to the bread crumbs. We like spice so I added garlic and pepper. What a wonderful sunday morning brunch!

I made this using all ingredients as directed. Instead of heating the spinach in a saucepan, I defrosted it in the microwave, squeezed out the excess liquid, and then just combined all ingredients in a bowl. Even my mother-in-law, who has previously said that she does not like cooked spinach, said that she liked this quiche! I didn't miss the crust and I think this will be my new go-to vegetarian quiche recipe.

This is a great recipe!  I made it as written and with artichoke hearts and garlic added, both were delish.  I did use panko bread crumbs instead of the croutons, because of what I had on hand, a lighter option but I don't think they made a significant taste/texture difference.  Going forward I'll keep the change/addition of the panko and garlic.

Well, I've been debating whether or not to review this, but decided to give it a go.  I made this using completely different ingredients, but this review is to give thumbs up to the basic ingredients (eggs, cheese, cottage cheese).  It turned out perfectly, and we both really enjoyed this quiche.  No crust is a bonus for ease of prep, and we didn't even miss it.  It's really a no-fail no matter what vegetable(s) and/or meat(s) you add to it.  Thanks....this WILL be made again.  Love it!

I don't even like quiche, but I decided to give this a try and I am glad I did!! What I did was used regular minced onion and sauted it in some olive oil and minced garlic, then added it to the cooked spinach. I didn't use croutons but Italian breadcrumbs. Before baking, I also put sliced fresh tomatoes on top. The tomatoes added such a great flavor that next time I think I will use another reviewer's suggestion and add some sun ripened tomatoes in the actual quiche itself as well!

Fantastic and forgiving.  Like half the other reviewers, it seems, we were short of some ingredients and just had to "make it work."  Subbed greek yogurt for most of the cottage cheese, feta cheese for half of the cheddar, had to add a little frozen broccoli because we were short on spinach.  And it still turned out beautifully!  Everybody (kids included) like it.

Let me first just say that "ingredients search" is an amazing feature of allrecipes.com!  I came across this by trying to get rid of my spinach (and had a ton of egg and extra cheddar laying around.)  I followed the recipe as stated, subbing minced onion for green onion, added a little bit of garlic, and subbed panko/Parmesan for croutons.  It's what I had in my kitchen and didn't want to go to the store.  It was so light and rich at the same time.  It was absolutely amazing.  I add hot sauce to (everything!) but didn't need it because the flavors were outstanding as it is!  Thank you for sharing, bettina, we loved it!

I have made this several times and have loved it every time.  It is even better the next day.  I have always used fresh spinach and suate with onions and garlic and a little salt and pepper in butter.  I have used bread crumbs as the topping and then grate a little bit of gruyere cheese on top after I take it out of the oven.  Ganna try the mushroom and artichoke ideas next time.  This is so good, I would reccomend to all.

I like how the cottage cheese works for this recipe. I made it for a brunch and it was very well received. I added about 1/2 cup of chopped artichoke, 1/4 cup of chopped sun dried tomatoes, 1 extra egg and about 1/2 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. I sauteed the green onion in a little bit of olive oil before adding to the mixture. I skipped the topping because I ran out of time. Next time I might try bread crumb and Parmesan cheese topping. Thank you for sharing!

Very good base recipe; I also added red peppers, garlic and some jack cheeses into this. If i made again, I would take the advice of a previous reviewer and replace the cottage cheese with Ricotta. Would definitely make again.

I loved this!  The only thing I changed about this was adding a little less cottage cheese than the recipe says and adding garlic croutons instead of plain ones. I also added 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup of the crutons. Next time I plan on adding a little garlic powder to the mixture. It should give it a little extra kick.

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  I baked it a bit longer than directed because I have a slow oven.  I bought a good quality cheddar cheese and grated it myself - I think it really added to the quiche.

Delicious!  We made it (as directed) with garlic/butter croutons.  Tasted great the next day, too!  Just bake it in the oven at about 250 degrees (F) for about 20 minutes.

Very easy, and adaptable.  Following others' advice, I lightly browned both onion and garlic in a bit of butter, first, and since I only had 1/2c of mozz cheese in the entire house (EGADS !), I added 3oz of CREAMED CHEESE to that pan, until it was well melted and combined.  I recommend squeezing spinach dry before adding.  I just prefer a dry-ish quiche.  ALSO, hubby really liked that I topped it with crushed 'French Fried Onions' mixed with some parmesan cheese.
VERY YUMMY !!  Will probably add some ham or sausage to my next one, but even without it, this was great.

Fabulous recipe and a nice change from the mozzarella and ricotta spinach quiche recipe I usually prepare.  
After reading other reviews I decided to saute the green onions and a couple of cloves of garlic and then added the drained spinach and continued to saute.  I added the rest of the ingredients with a bit of salt and pepper and baked.
I did make a lowfat version though.  I used low fat cottage cheese; low fat sharp cheddar, and egg substitutes.  It drastically changed the nutritional facts.  Calories: 130; Total Fat: 4.3g; Total Carbs: 4.5g; Protein: 18g.
This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks for posting!!!

Substitute a bag of fresh spinach, microwaving for 2 minutes and squeezing liquid out.  This is simple and fabulous.  It is a weekend regular in our home.  I bake for 15 minutes at 375 and 45 minutes at 350.  Love that it just doesn't need the crust and all the extra calories.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!! :) My family loved it, and so did I! The richness of the quiche is absolutely delectable. The only thing that I changed was someone else's suggestion, which was to add grated parmesan cheese in with the bread crumbs. I used Italian bread crumbs and added other spices, too - lots and lots of garlic, too! I highly reccomend this! ^^

WOW this was a winner. AS  IS. so delicious, so easy, and so versatile! there are so many things you can add and replace to very: sun dried tomatoes, fresh tomatoes, mushrooms, yellow onions, broccoli, with crust or without... just to name a few. such a fun recipe. just make sure you saute the non-soft items like broccoli and onions before you put it in.

I didn't have green onion, so I used a small white onion and sauteed it first. I used egg beaters and 2% cottage cheese and cut the cheddar to 1 C. I also added a cup of turkey sausage. Delicious! This is one of the most flavorful, delicious quiches I have ever had!

This was fantastic, and everyone in our family loved it. It was very easy to make. I added some chopped cooked bacon and half of the cheese I used was Pepper Jack which added a little kick.

It was easy to make. this is a keeper! I'll make it again and again. It will be our family recipe from now on. Thank you so much for sharing..:-)

Very tasty dish.  I added two eggs and also two pieces of dried bread torn in pieces.  I skipped the onion b/c of my kids taste, but added a little salt and pepper for flavor.  This one is a keeper!

You can make this a lot easier, by using a can of spinach. Get ALL the liquid mashed out of it, then mix ingredients and cook. I have never had any other quiche in my life, but adore this one! I do not use the croutons on top, as we don't care for toppings on things. Just drain the spinach, mix everything up, and put in quiche dish and cook for an hour. It's awesome. My picky teenager, melts when I make this, she loves it SO much. Just made it yesterday for my best friend. She said it got better with every bite! This is a must make, if you like spinach.

I chose this recipe because I had a bag of spinach and some cottage cheese that needed to be used up...I did use fresh spinach-cooked, squeezed dry and chopped-and it was so good!!!  I  used low-fat cottage cheese, low fat cheddar cheese and added some chopped ham!  Awesome, healthy, full of protein and delicious!!  The whole family gobbled this up!

I've made this quiche more times than I can remember.  It's so good for breakfast, brunch or dinner.  Easy to make.  The only change is that I use low fat cottage cheese and low fat cheddar cheese.

Loved it.  So easy.  So good.  I didn't have croutons so I crushed some Sundried Tomato and Basil Wheat Thins.  They added a nice flavor.  I think I'll try this recipe with artichoke hearts or black olives - or both -  some time.

Wow!  So simple and delicious!  My husband said it was the best quiche ever.  I used fresh spinach and wilted it down on the stove.  I had cheddar/monterey jack so I used that.  Will make again.

Really good! I basically followed the recipe but used low-fat ricotta instead of cottage cheese cuz that's what I had, added a little sea salt & ground pepper and crumbled Ritz crackers over the top. I did cover with foil at the end and baked for an additional 5-8 minutes just to make sure the inside was a bit firmer. It was marvelous! I'm thinking next time, and there will DEFINITELY be a next time, I'll sub in egg-beaters. Thanks for sharing...

This was so good I didn't even miss the crust.  I was concerned because I don't really like cottage cheese but it gave an interesting texture to the quiche.  
I used bread crumbs because I didn't have croutons and I think it was a mistake. I will definitely try again with croutons.

A friend of mine gave this recipe to me a few months ago. The only difference is I use two box packages of the chopped spinach. I microwave the frozen spinach for about 4-5 minutes and then drain well. What I love about this recipe is that you can have a delicious vegetable and use low fat products and avoid all those calories without it affecting the taste. Oh yes, my recipt didn't call for croutons.

This was fabulous to our vegetarian preferred family members.  I didn't even bother with the croutons and only added about 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese.  I also used non fat cottage cheese.  
This was a great low cal breakfast.

Very easy and simple to make and adapt to your own preferences! I added mushrooms and a bit of extra onion. My family enjoyed how moist and light it was with such a quality flavor. (I also posted a photo of it)

My husband and I loved this quiche!  I used some other reviewers' suggestions by using a pie crust.  I actually had enough filling for two 9-inch quiches.  I also left out the croutons and used 5 eggs.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.  This one is a keeper!

This was a great recipe! Very easy to make. I made this the night before I had a Church Brekfast at my house. I warmed it up the next morning and it was wonderful. I used frozen spinach and warmed it on the stove and drained it and then added everything eles. I would gladly make this again!

Yummy! I added some cubed smoked ham and used sharp white cheddar. Skipped the crumbled topping and went for the crust!

This quiche is SOOO good! The girls at the office just raved about it. I left out the croutons and the crust. This is going to be on my breakfast menu weekly from now on!

This was fantastic!!  I did make a couple of slight adjustments: used sautéed onions instead of raw green onions and left off the crouton topping, it didn't need it.  I also used sharp cheddar (shredded).  I can't believe how scrumptious this was!  I'm not a big fan of spinach, but I barely tasted it in this recipe (tasted the fried onions mainly)!  I used muffin tins which gives me specific portion sizes; 2 quiche muffins = lunch, along with tomato juice and an apple.  The rest are in the fridge for future lunches, heat and serve.  Thanks so much for this tasty carb-free option!  Will definitely be making this one again!

This recipe was AWESOME! I needed a quick and easy recipe for an impromptu Easter Brunch. I had all of the ingredients in the house. Love this recipe because you don't make a crust. I mixed all of the ingredients the night before and then poured it into a buttered, glass pie plate as we were on our way out the door to church. When we returned home an hour later, the quiche was done. There were only four of us and NO leftovers!

This has been a hit with family and guests at two luncheons. I use 3 green onions (not a bunch) so that the flavor doesn't overpower. I took the advice of another reviewer to  mix up the cheese: instead of cottage cheese I use 16 oz of low fat ricotta; for the 2 cups of additional cheese I use smoked gouda, strong cheddar and mozzarella. The gouda not only adds a yummy complexity, it creates a hunger-inducing scent in the kitchen! Finally, instead of croutons, try panko -- very crunchy and you won't miss the crust at all.

I only slightly changed this. I used 1 cup each of cottage cheese, cheddar and mozzarella. I added some nutmeg (1/2 tsp.) and a few cloves of garlic. Switched out the croutons of a mixture of panko and Parmesan cheese. If I were to make this again I'd add something more to the filling, it was lacking something to make it have a "full" flavour. Also, I'd leave off the topping as it didn't add anything. It tasted good, but it was lacking.

I did not miss the crust at all in this quiche. I found this recipe to use up some spinach I had defrosting in the fridge. I was out of green onion and subbed 1/4 cup of very small chopped onion. I am actually glad for the replacement as they were very mild tasting unlike green onions. I just cooked the onion with the spinach on medium to soften slightly. I used 2% low fat cottage cheese and it worked fine along with reduced fat cheddar. I didn't understand the point of putting croutons on top of a basically set quiche, or why, so I left them out. I poured the batter into a 9" cake pan, well sprayed with pan spray, as I was afraid of it not fitting in the regular pie pans I had. It cut into 8 triangle wedges just fine. The only downside is I thought it had a lot of cheese. Tastewise that is no problem, but we have to watch saturated fat in my home. I wasn't sure if cutting it back a bit would affect the quiche from thickening. It was still a bit healthier, I guess, than the traditional ones with the pastry.

This was fabuous! I took a few suggestions made by reviewers, and made the following edits: substituted one small white onion, chopped, for the green onion; added one clove of minced garlic. Cooked these in a skillet with a bit of olive oil before adding the spinach in. I had fresh spinach from the farmer's market to use up, so substituted the fresh for frozen. I was short a few oz. on the cottage cheese, so added a splash of cream. Also added about 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper and fresh ground Italian seasonings. Used one cup cheddar and one cup mixed mozzarella/parmigiano reggiano. Used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs mixed with a bit of grated parm for the topping. DELICIOUS!

This turned out wonderfully and was really easy to put together. Awesome thing about this recipe is that it's a perfect base and you can switch around the ingredients a bit to fit what you have on hand or like.  I did make a few changes.  I used fresh spinach, which I simply mixed in with all the other ingredients.  Also used low-fat cottage cheese and seasoned breadcrumbs. I added some ground pepper, olive oil and garlic.

Super delicious.  Took one reviewer's advice and instead of croutons did a breadcrumb/parmesan mix.  Only had italian bread crumbs tho so probably not the best.  Would go lighter on the mixture next time too.  Quiche itself without topping might be an option too because it was super delish.

I did a southwestern version of this, using Southwestern style Egg Beaters in place of the eggs and shredded taco cheese (the kind with spices in it) instead of the cheddar. So yummy!

Very good, I sauteed onions and garlic (2 cloves) with spinach and also added some salt and pepper for extra flavor.  No problems at all setting and I used Italian bread crumbs instead of croutons and it worked just as good.  This is something that I'd make the night before a gathering and lightly reheat in the morning! Delish

Love, love this recipe and I hardly ever eat cottage cheese! I used fresh spinach that I sauteed with onion and fresh mushrooms and minced garlic. I also used a blend of cheese (sharp cheddar and white cheddar) since that's what I had on hand. This would be delicious with any variety of cheese! I followed other reviewers suggestions and topped with seasoned bread crumbs and grated parmesan cheese instead of croutons. This smelled heavenly while baking and tasted even better. I will be making this recipe again and again. I love that it has no crust or flour in the filling, but the texture is perfect because of the cottage cheese. If you leave off the croutons/breadcrumbs, this is a healthy, low carb meal for either breakfast, lunch or dinner. Remember to let the quiche rest for ten minutes before slicing after taking it out of the oven to give it time to set. Thanks SO much for posting this one Bettina!!

Really good base for a crustless quiche. I adapted it by using a heap of fresh baby spinach and red chard, which I wilted in a pan with sauteed white onions, mushrooms and garlic. I used fat-free cottage cheese and omitted the cheddar, instead sprinkling some parmesean into the mixture. I used 3 full eggs and some extra whites to make up the difference. It came out great!

This was my first time making quiche and it turned out so good! I added some red pepper (I'd recommend adding this, the colour makes it look very appetizing) and sliced mushrooms and sauteed them with fresh spinach instead of frozen. I also used only 2 whole eggs and 4 egg whites. Next time I'll add some fresh garlic to the veggies.

Loved this recipe.  I did follow the advice of others  and added bread crumbs and parmesan cheese on top instead of croutons.  I also added sauteed mushrooms and onions- it was delicious.  I was looking for a quiche without a crust that would have fewer calories but a rich taste and this was definitely it- you can't go wrong.

I made this for a potluck brunch a while back and everyone loved it. It's also really easy to make. Just be aware that if your pan isn't big enough, there may be some spillage. Also, a crusty, done-looking top doesn't mean that the inside is finished cooking (though that's not always bad if you like cheesy, melty goodness)!

I usually like a crusted quiche but I decided to try this one because of so many good reviews.  My husband and I both agree...it was not good.  The spinach seemed warm and mushy like the spinach out of a can.  I think the combination of cottage cheese in this recipe makes it too moist thus making the spinach have a wierd texture.  Not a big fan of the cheddar cheese in it either and I definitely missed having a crust.

Pretty darn good. But definently take the advice to add ricotta instead of cottage cheese. Do not substitute bread crumbs for chopped crutons, just isn't enough. It really needs that extra crunch to do it justice. YUM!!!!

O-M-G.  This is a VERY forgiving recipe--lost track of eggs once and added one extra, two extra another time--also can combine differect cheeses as well as or in place  of the 2 c. Cheddar--I like about 2 Tblsp parmesan reggiano which I quickly finely grate as I am adding other cheeses--also had leftover shredded mozzarella--so added about 1/2 c. as well as some provolone (not all to the same dish--just added these at different times during experimentation and desire to used up refrigerator stores).  Also I always like to add one small can sliced mushrooms, lightly drained. Have used flavored croutons as well as my FAV--Panko breadvrumbs with more grated parmesan. This recipe was a lifesaver for me. My guy had complications from dental surgery and this helped us through what became a prolonged recovery without depending on smoothies and mashed potatos and gravy.  Thanks you sooooo much!!!

This recipe was great. I used egg beaters,low fat cottage cheese, and added a teaspoon of garlic poweder. I also used crushed ritz crackers instead of the croutons. I think I like spinach more then I thought!

Fantastic recipe! I was on the hunt for a crust-less quiche and found exactly what I wanted... Only changes I made was adding a diced up ham-steak and an extra egg. This will be my quiche base from here on out.

Super easy and pretty yummy (not to mention healthy!). I added an extra egg and sauteed onions and garlic. I didn't think adding crushed croutons so late in the game would work, so next time I think I'd add them in the beginning and cover with foil until the last 15 minutes. I'd also amp up the spices, more onions and garlic, and maybe some kind of herb. That said, this was quick and simple and a better texture than other quiches thanks to the cottage cheese, so I'll definitely use this recipe again with the tweaks mentioned. Thanks, Bettina!

I tried to make this with canned spinach because I needed it to go in something and it was really bad.  I am sure that this would be really tasty with the frozen or fresh so I just wanted to warn anyone before they tried this not to do what I did, I wasted some groceries!!  All the other ingredients seemed to be good though, especially the cottage cheese.

Great, delicious and easy recipe! I used a little less spinach and cottage cheese than the recipe called for and also made it with a pre-made pie crust and it turned out beautifully! I will definately make this again!

A keeper with my changes! 1) Fresh spinach instead of frozen, 2) red onion instead of green (just because that's what I had), 3) 6 eggs, 4) a mix of mozzarella, cheddar, and parmesan cheese, 5) a bunch of sun dried tomatoes rinsed of the excess oil, 6) about 6 mushrooms sliced, 7) Did not use croutons.  Baked for 50 minutes at 325.

This was a wonderful quiche recipe! I must say that it was my first attempt at making quiche at home and I wasn't sure about it. I wondered if it needed any seasoning or anything. It was amazing! I added 3 slices of bacon, cut up and cooked until crisp to the mixture. I didn't have any cheddar cheese on hand, so I cut small pieces of provolone. It made for an amazing breakfast that I sliced and put in the refregerator for more breakfasts throughout the week.

This was delicious and easy! I made 2 pies for myself, my fiance, and our roommate (they're both former marines). There were just enough leftovers for me to have lunch the next day. Even the leftovers were awesome!

This was easy and yummy too! I did make a couple of small changes to this recipe. I reduced the cheddar cheese, used regular onion instead of green onion, added a small can of mushrooms and an extra egg. It turned out great!! Will make again. Thanks!

I tried this recipe the other day and have to say that I really did like it. Since it's crustless I added bread crumbs to the bottom of my lightly greased pie pan to hold better at the bottom. I also sauteed the spinach and the green onions together to make everything nice and soft. Oh and I also used the entire green onion, not just the white part in mine. Everything turned out great. Next time I'll try low-fat cheese and maybe some egg whites instead. Thanks Bettina!

I made this dish last night and had it for breakfast this morning along with 2 slices of turkey bacon, and it was GREAT! My alterations: I used 2% sharp cheddar cheese, fat free cottage cheese, five eggs, added garlic powder and omitted the crutons.  I didn't have a 9in pie pan and I didn't think it would fit into the 8in so I used a rectangle pan and it fit perfectly. I baked at 325 for an hour and it was perfect. Now I have a heat-and-go low carb breakfast for the entire week. Thanks for this submission!

We enjoyed this recipe.  I used broccoli rather than spinach due to family preference.  I used panko bread crumbs and salted it with BVI Caribbean Seasoning rather than croutons.  I also used reduced fat cheese and fat free cottage cheese and it tasted great and was healthier.

Instead of croutons, I like to add Italian seasoned bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese, just enough to cover.  Fewer carbs and additional cheese flavor.

This was pretty good. I actually thought it was better the next day. I substituted broccoli for the spinach.

This dish is so simple that I've added it to my small repertoire of recipes.  But it is so delicious that my family devours it almost once a week.  Delicious.

Wonderful!  I used two eggs and two egg beaters, reduced fat cheeses, and added mushrooms.  Will definately make again. Filling and very pretty when baked.  Super Easy!

This is good.  I used 2 eggs and 2 egg beaters.  I also cut the cheese back to one cup and added mushrooms.  I topped it with crushed crackers and parmesean cheese.

This was a pretty good quiche for vegetarians or people who don't eat pork.  If it's just for people who don't eat pork, I'd suggest adding a little lox for a pick-me-up because just veggies, cheese and eggs is a little bland.

I've made this four times now. Comes out great. Using the basic recipe it's easy to substitute or add ingredients. Kids and boyfriend love it and they are picky eaters.

Holy cow this was tasty! The only changes I made was use the cheese I had in fridge which was mexican blend and parm.  I accidentally added the seasoned bread crumbs (didn't use croutons) to the mix and not on top. I will make this all the time and use different veggies. Like next time I would like to do kale or half kale half spinach. I will probably  not add the bread crumbs next time to cut down on the carbs as I don't think it adds that much.

I have made this recipe several times.  I vary it each time. Sometimes I add sauteed mushrooms and onions.  Sometimes I pour it into a pie crust.  Each time it has been delicious.

Great base recipe! It has so much fexability you can add all sorts of different cheeses and veggies! It's a hit at my house. I usually use 8 ounces of feta in place of 1/2 the cottage cheese. I have put mushrooms, kale, carrots, bell peppers, and broccoli in this dish! Amazingly flexible and it has no crust!

I too have made substitutions and every quiche has been a winner. The best oops I had was I subbed panko crumbs for the croutons and accidentally put it into the mix. My quiche connoisseurs raved about it so I make it that way every time now.

Delicious creamy quiche! I used crumbled toast instead of croutons and used a lot more than 1/4 cup so it would be crunchier. It came out a little watery and I couldn't cut a solid piece very easily, so I definitely shod have drained the spinach more. Still was yummy!

Even my kids loved this recipe.  I did use a pie shell and used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  I also happen to have mushrooms on hand so why not!  I will experiment with more ingredients next time.

I love love love this quiche! The taste is amazing and it is filling. I make it exactly as is other than if I don't have green onion I use regular onion but I like the taste of the green onion much better. I now make this all the time!

This recipe was soOo delicious! I also seasoned with salt/pepper/crushed red pepper and I used 6 eggs instead of 4. I think that this is definitely a good basic recipe on its own. It also gives you the opportunity to be creative. Like other reviews, make sure that you drain the spinach :)

I've made this twice now, and love it.  I used a large onion, chopped, and fresh spinach and kale mix....
once I left out the cottage cheese and it was just as good......today I added some chopped chicken and a bit of real bacon.....added a few turns of fresh ground nutmeg....wow!!  Made a delicious lunch - this recipe is a keeper for us.  Thank you.

This is delicious! I used a combination of cheeses I had on hand -- mozzerella, swiss, cheedar and parmesean. I squeezed out the spinach well, wrapping it in paper towels and pressiing out all the water.  Sauted some yellow onion and garlic to add to the mix, skipping the green onions. Also skipped the croutons to save on calories. I will be making this again, perhaps with squash next time.

To make this lighter on calories I used Kirkland egg whites and part skim Ricotta cheese instead of the cottage cheese.  I also used part skim Mozzarella cheese, with a little Parmesan mixed in. For personal preference I substituted chopped yellow onions for the green onion. . I'm not real great at measuring, put in a little less spinach and a little more egg white, less Ricotta than what was called for.  But this is a pretty flexible recipe and it turned out good.

Excellent recipe.  Because I am watching my calorie intake I did change it up a bit and it still came out delicious!  I  used low fat cottage cheese and reduced fat cheddar to keep calories down... I also used fresh cooked and chopped spinach and since I didn't have croutons I crushed up some town house crackers for the topping.....my husband thought it was the best quiche he had ever had!

I made some changes to this recipe, which is probably why it didn't taste good. I didn't have any cottage cheese, so I tried using plain yogurt. Big mistake. I also used a regular yellow onion instead of green onions. Should've sauteed them first before baking.

On the plus side, the quiche did look beautiful and browned quite nicely. I used my cast iron skillet, and it did not stick at all. I might make this again, except using either cottage cheese or sour cream, like another reviewer did.

Good recipe!  I made recipe with slight changes (used chive cottage cheese and bread crumbs for topping instead of croutons).  I drained the spinach before mixing with the other ingredients and added a little bit of milk because it was a stiff mixture.  The cottage cheese flavor blended well with the quiche.  It is a pretty easy quiche recipe and I will probably make it again, but perhaps with broccoli or other vegetables for variety.

Really enjoyed this quiche but I think without some changes it would have been a bit bland. I followed the advice of others and added 2 cloves garlic and onion to the pan before added the spinach. About 3 pieces of turkey bacon, a pinch of seasoned salt and some fresh ground pepper did the trick. I also substituted low-fat cottage cheese and used sharp cheddar. This allowed me to use a half cup less of cheese and my quiche was still bubbling over so if it looks too full - it probably is, next time I will make some mini quiches in a muffin pan with the extra filling.

Great way to make a low-carb quiche! My picky husband liked it a lot, and I ate the leftovers for the next three days. If anything, they tasted better the next day!

I modified the recipe a bit to make it a bit healthier; used 2 eggs and 4 egg whites instead of 4 eggs, I used low fat cottage cheese and only 1 cup of low fat cheddar. Its very tasty, and I will definitely make it again!

This was good in a pinch....I really did miss the crust though.  I added a clove of garlic and 1/4 cup of yellow onion.  I only put in 1.5 cups of cheese.  I topped with seasoned bread crumbs instead of croutons.  I also used fresh spinach & mushrooms.  I thought it needed some sort of seasoning, but not sure what.  I put this in a small casserole dish.  Easy and yummy.

So good! I used fresh spinach and I think it worked just as well- just sauteed with a little garlic and olive oil.  I think next time I will cut the cheddar down- it seemed plenty cheesey!

Super good! I sauteed the green onions first, and used half cheddar/half parmesan flakes, and used a premade gluten free crust/no croutons or bread crumb topping. Only thing I suggest is maybe process the filling because the spinach is big and chunky, probably just a few pulses in a processor would do it. Excellent flavor, thank you for sharing the recipe!

I found this recipe last month and can't stop making it - 4 times and counting.  I drain the liquid from the spinach and use a insulated pie pan and it could not be better.

I made this last night and the appeal was crustless because I had some guest coming that eat gluten free.  Very good and easy to make.  I made it earlier in the day and kept it refrigerated until I was ready to bake it.  The only change was to use fresh spinach and add salt and pepper.  Thanks for sharing.

I only changed a couple of things - used egg beaters instead and added 6 oz of turkey sausage - I had to add the equivalent of 1 more egg.  Turned out wonderful!  Very calorie friendly with no crust, low fat cheese and egg beaters.  Definitely gonna make again - passed on to several friends who saw a piece I brought to work and they can't wait to try it.

This is one of the best recipes for quiche out there. I have made a couple of changes after cooking this recipe for a couple of years. I split the cheese between 1 cup of cheddar and 1 cup of shredded Parmesan and instead of croutons I crush 1/2 cup of cheeze crackers and sprinkle on top. I usually like to cook it a little longer than 1 hr so that the eggs can firm up more.

This was fantastic and well worth the try. My family loved it and everyone had seconds. I added  some diced marinated artichoke hearts which gave it a little extra zip. It was easy to make and easy to clean up the kitchen afterwards.

This is delicious and would be good for any meal.  I forgot to pick up croutons so I did as someone else suggested by using bread crumbs mixed with Parmesan cheese for the topping.  Next time I make this I might add some chopped artichoke hearts to the mixture.

Four stars - probably my fault since I didn't follow recipe exactly. Good spinach quiche base recipe. Made one ham and cheese and another with bacon and mushroom. I baked them both for approx 40 minutes at home, transported next day and baked additional 20 minutes. Quiches were too wet. Back in the oven for another 15. Very tasty but still moist. I really squeezed the spinach and strained the cottage cheese. Maybe I added too much cheese? Two cups grated or 8 oz ungrated? Will make again.

Good, but not as good as some spinach quiches I've had before. Still I loved it being crust-less, and using mainly ingredients that are typically handy in my kitchen. I'll probably be making this again just because of the sheer convenience of it, very simple recipe.

Yum!  My version deviated a lot from the original recipe.  I had no frozen spinach so I used fresh raw spinach, which I wilted.  I used up some mushrooms by chopping them up and throwing them in.  I also cooked some turkey bacon and chopped that up to add.  I used low-fat ricotta (15 oz) instead of cottage cheese.  I only had about 1 cup of shredded cheddar, but took a risk and just went with that.  It was fine!  Maybe I would have missed the extra cheese had I made this with the full amount before, but it was still pretty tasty.  Instead of buying croutons, I put a slice of sourdough rye in the food processor and made bread crumbs, mixed with a little parmesan cheese and italian herbs, and used that to top.  This was super easy, adaptable, filling, and easy to heat up leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe!  I will try this with garlic and other vegetables in the future.

I love this recipe...great starter quiche that you can add anything to! I did a few things differently with this recipe: I changed the oven temp to 375, sauteed the green onions with 3 cloves of minced garlic in 1 TBSP of butter, added salt and pepper, and mixed it all together with 2 cups of random leftover cheeses (pecorino romano, parmesan, cheddar, mozzerella) and replaced the cottage cheese with ricotta....DELICIOUS!  Thank you :)

I realized that I really like my quiche to have a crust! This just didn't cut it gfor me, the bottom was very soggy and scrambled egg-like.

I liked this and I don't like spinach. I used mozzarella instead of cottage and halved everything in the recipe. I also baked it with a pie crust. Great for leftovers.

This is a wonderful recipe for spinache lovers. I believe I would add a little more spices next time as spinache is a bit bland, other than that. I give five stars.

I sauteed onion, chopped garlic & a few sliced mushrooms with a couple of strips of bacon before adding the well drained spinach. I also baked about 2 cups of shredded hash browns (20 min @ 400) in some butter and used that as a base instead of the cheese. I added a bit of shredded cheddar and parmaesan and broiled it until the cheese bubbled (3 min)and it turned out delicious- really versatile!

This recipe was great; I ended up adding deli ham as well as minced garlic. I also dotted some margarine over the breadcrumbs to make it golden. 

Yummy :)Thanks for sharing--

My husband liked it, kids wouldn't eat 2nd bite. I am not sure what I did but it was too bland and dry. I followed advice of some reviews and used ricotta cheese and I think it made it dry. I was trying to make a quiche like our local cafe but not very close. I think I will try this again with the cottage cheese, half of the spinach and maybe some cooked sausage. I thinks it could be a good recipe to try different combos. 
Very easy to throw together.

I make this all the time. However, I do use  two deep dish pie crusts. I freeze one and serve the other! I have also made it with mozzarella cheese. It is a real crowd pleaser.

Very tasty! It was a bit spinach-y for me, so I will probably pare down the spinach the next time I make it if I can put 1-2 oz. to good use in another recipe. I used a few pieces of diced yellow onion in place of the green onions, and I didn't have any croutons so I threw on some rice crispies mixed with melted butter. It gave the quiche a slightly unusual taste, but not altogether unpleasant. I also added a bit of powdered garlic and a few generous twists of the peppermill.

Excellent recipe, the cottage cheese is a great addition. I didn't have much cheese - only 0.5 cup or so - but it still turned out fantastic and had less calories. I also added some fresh basil and chopped ham. Will definitely make again.

I was looking for a quick egg dish that I could throw together without having to go shopping and I'm glad I found this one.  I try to watch my carb intake but every now and again I like to indulge and this was the perfect recipe.  I sauteed a small onion and a few large cloves of garlic in olive oil and added them to the egg mixture instead of green onions.  I also used up what shredded cheese I had left in the fridge which ended up being equal parts of cheddar, swiss, four cheese blend, and freshly grated asiago totalling the two cups the recipe called for.  This quiche was extraordinary!  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't think the spinach was overwhelming at all.  It was delicious and the only problem I encountered was not eating the whole quiche myself!

Wow! This was fabulous. The only change I made was to use 1 cup of cheddar instead of 2. (That was definitely plenty of cheese.) We only had "italian" breadcrumbs in the house, so I used those and they added a wonderful flavor. I highly recommend them!! I don't even particularly LIKE quiche (too spongy in texture usually), but THIS was excellent. Seriously! I can't wait till tonight to eat the leftovers.

This recipe makes enough filling for two nine inch pie crusts. I used frozen pie crusts. It is heavy on cheese and I would add a couple more eggs at least. Pretty good, but I won't follow recipes letter for letter from now on, that was a mistake.

Very yummy, my mother loves it. I left the mushrooms out as Im not a fan of them but it still tasted great. I had to use feta dip instead of the cheese but it still turned out.

Thank you for this easy and tasty recipe that is very adaptable to low-fat ingredients.  I used 1/2 part skim mozzarella, and non-fat cottage cheese.  I also found the onion flavor to be a bit overpowering so if I make it again I will use less onion and perhaps a handful of very finely chopped green pepper.

I made this for a baby shower.  It was wonderful; everyone loved it!  I decided to use a crust, which worked really well.  Will definitely make again for other gatherings.

This is great!  I used low fat cottage cheese.  I also chopped up onions and put in the saucepan with the spinach instead of using green onions.  I wish I had read the reviews first and used mushrooms.  That sounds good.

I added:
1 small onion instead of green onions
1 red bell pepper
sautéed onion and pepper then added fresh chopped organic spinach. Cooked till all liquid was evaporated. 
Stirred in cottage cheese, cheddar cheese and then the eggs.
Instead of croutons, I used gluten-free bread crumbs mixed with some more cheddar cheese and sprinkled that on top.
It was very good. My husband had two pieces.  :)

A little bland for my taste. I think it could use a little salt.  If dietary sodium is a concern, this is very good for breakfast or brunch.

Liked the way this turned out the first time. Normally I have to tweek a recipe, but this was food out of the gate. I added some bacon and may add sun dried tomatoes as well next time.

For the record I don’t agree with using Greek yogurt in this recipe as one person mentioned. I used 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 yogurt because that is what I had. We thought it added a very unpleasant sour taste and in fact gave the dogs most of it. Bet it is great with cottage cheese or ricotta!

Added canned mushrooms, black pepper and trader Joe onion salt. I subbed 1/8 c each of panko and wheat germ, for the croutons. But I spaced out and didn't realize they go on top so I added to the mixture! Will make again the same way :)

Similar to others, I made but altered :)

I grilled onions and mushrooms, then added the spinach
Instead of 2 cups of Cheddar, I used one Cheddar and one Swiss

I placed the crushed croutons in the bottom of the dish

Only due to time, I baked at 375 for 50 minutes and it was perfect

A new crustless favorite!! 
This recipe should be renamed to Quick Spinach Crustless Quiche ha ha!

Delicious and without the crust, it’s a very healthy recipe. My family loved it. I added an extra egg and a half-cup of milk to make it a bit more fluffy, and to fill out my pie pan. I added a teaspoon of dill weed (as I do for Greek spinach pie) and it gave it a great flavor. I served it with chopped fresh tomato, green onion and avocado. I will be making this again!

Tasty as is and works perfectly for my low carb diet.  Next time I will add more onion and other seasoning.  I left off the croutons, and gave it 10 minutes to set before I cut it.  I will definitely make again.

I found this recipe to be dense, not fluffy, and it needs more seasoning.  It was very bland. Common sense told me that  5 eggs seasoned with  1/4 teaspoon of salt  and 1/8 teaspoon of pepper just wasn't going to work but for once, I was going to try and follow the recipe.   Too egg-y.  I won't be making this again.  I think those folks who rated it higher probably added their own touches.

A new family favorite. I had to substitute broccoli for the spinach, else my husband wouldn't have tried it. Had Panko bread crumbs on hand, so used those instead of the crushed croutons. However, it was still absolutely delicious. It took the two of us several days to finish, but maintained the texture and flavor even when reheated.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

This is the basic recipe I used but changed it up a little.

I did: 1 C shredded cheddar instead of 2 and added an extra egg. I also added 1 C. of finely chopped ham and 1/4 C. finely chopped onion (instead of the green onions) & 1/4 C. Italian bread crumbs into the mixture instead of the croutons and some shakes of parmesan. Seasoned with a few shakes of garlic pwder, season salt, and s&p. Nothing on top. Baked 1 hr. in 2 qt low casserole dish.

Great base recipe for whatever veggies and cheese you have on hand. Used fresh spinach, mushrooms, red bell pepper and shredded Swiss. Had never used cottage cheese in a quiche before and was very pleasantly surprised by the light texture it gave to it. Didn’t miss the crust at all! Will be making this many times again.

I actually used this recipe as a base.  I added four more eggs,  additional shredded cheese, green peppers  and tomatoes.  It turned out great.  I also love that It uses cottage cheese.   It worked out great the night I was making it, because I wanted to use up my cottage cheese.

This quiche is AMAZING!  It is now my go-to quiche recipe!  The cottage cheese is, I think, the key. This recipe bakes up incredibly light and fluffy. I omitted the onions and butter and added about 1 1/2 cups sliced portabella mushrooms.  It was wonderful!

I've made this quiche a few times now and it's delicious as is, no changes necessary.  The last time I made it though, I did add an extra egg and a small can of diced green chilies (drained) for a little extra zing and loved it that way too. Also good with or without the pie crust. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great flour-less quiche recipe. I've made this twice for a Sunday brunch with friends and everyone loved it. It's extremely easy to make but I wish there was a lower sodium version. It's tough to find a low sodium cottage cheese or cheddar cheese for that matter

It was delicious! I made a few changes to the recipe though...added 1 can mushroom pieces, 1 tsp all spice, 1 tsp lemon pepper, and 1 round onion.  And I baked dish for 30 more minutes because middle was still wet. Took out the dish and cut it in pie pieces, middle was still a bit wet but onolicious!

I make quiche quite frequently and always make them without a crust.  I wanted to try this because of the cottage cheese, just to try a different recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe was written except I did add a small can of mushrooms, drained. I also used a good sprinkling of parmesan on top instead of bread crumbs because I do not eat bread and I always top my quiches this way. T his was good and the texture was creamy and interesting, plus the recipe was quite easy. I did not like the taste of so much cheddar cheese and next time I would sub a good Italian blend and possibly throw in some swiss.  Overall a good recipe and quite low carb.

I used sharp cheddar and I used all of the green onions- not just the white part.  Delicious and just as good warmed up later.

Fabulous recipe! You really need to squeeze all the water out of the spinach, and let the quiche rest about half an hour before cutting. I also used the leaves from the spring onions and it worked really well.

Prepped and froze two bags for later use - sauteed the spinach, garlic & onion and froze with the cottage cheese.  Just add cheese, bread and eggs and voila!  Easy dinner!  Will update when I've baked it!

Only change I made was to add pre-sauted mushrooms.  Also, next time I will pre-saute the onions so they aren't as firm in the final product.  We loved it!

After 45 minutes in the oven, the quiche will have set too much for croutons to stick to the top. Either add them sooner, or do what I prefer and mix the entire bag of croutons into the quiche itself before baking. So good! Spinach flavor is awesome. I usually add more salt.

I loved the simplicity of this recipe, and decided to go the savory route.  Instead of chopped frozen spinach, I used a mix of fresh spinach and baby arugula. I also added fresh red onion, mushrooms, corn and tomatoes, minced garlic and chopped bacon.  I omitted the cottage cheese entirely and for the topping, I used Parmesan cheese instead of the crushed croutons.

This tasted great.  I read some other reviews and first sautéed onions mushrooms and garlic.  I also substituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese, and I used a grated cheese blend.  I also added a spoon of all natural consommé to the mixture before baking.

This was delicious, especially considering we don't normally eat cottage cheese. I did run the cottage cheese through my mini food processor to do away with the curds, I'm amazed at the wonderful texture this imparts to the quiche, I would have never guessed. Other than that, I did increase  the eggs to 6, and used fresh spinach which I sauteed with the onion. Also added garlic , onion powder, and a few sprinkles of paprika for more flavor. Next time I'll probably increase the cheese a little since I use more eggs. Thanks  for the great recipe :)

This was great! I cut back on the spinach some though as I just did not want that much, and for it to take over the dish.

I used a pie crust for my quiche & I ended up making mini quiches since I didn't want the excess going to waste.  My dude had me add bacon to it (pre-cooked) & it is freakin' awesome!!!  This will have to make it into the dinner rotation more often.

A great versatile quiche - I added bacon into the mix. Also, sprinkled parmesan instead of croutons. Cold, it would be wonderful as a picnic dish!

I don't like spinach but I loved this!  I'd make it on Sunday, cut and wrap it in pieces, and then just grab and go with breakfast during the week! I used mozzarella and cheddar cheese blend along with the cottage cheese.  Very flavorful!

I loved the recipe. It was very simple to put together.  The change that I made was that since I had a pie crust available, I place a rolled crust in the bottom of a springform pan and proceeded make the quiche. It came out looking like a tart.

This is my go-to when we have potluck breakfast at work. Per other reviewers I add artichoke hearts, use fresh spinach and sautée onion and garlic with the spinach. And, I top with seasoned breadcrumbs instead of croutons  since I always have them on hand. I always get compliments! Thanks for the recipe!

Hubby loved this. I'm not fond of spinach and I liked it too. I basically followed the recipe as written. I did increase the spinach to 16 ounces, and it still fit into a 9 inch pie plate. I used Italian Seasoned croutons. It added just the right amount of seasoning, since there is no spices or salt & pepper in the recipe. This is so easy to make and we will be enjoying this again. Thanks for such a simple and tasty creation.

This was very easy and also delicious. I was tempted to substitute the cottage cheese with ricotta but the cottage cheese was on sale so I didn't,  and I'm glad because I'm sure it was healthier and it tasted very good. I topped mine with flavored panko crumbs and some parmesan cheese. Delish!

I have made this several times and changed up the cheeses using sharp cheddar and shreaded (not in the green can)parmesan.  Tastes good both as original recipe and with changes. Flavored crouton work well!   Thank you for sharing this recipe, Bettina.

First attempt @ quiche & it was a big hit. Just added extra cheese & was generous on croutons. Used fresh spinach rather than frozen. No need to sautée that. Saved a step.

Made this for the husband and I to bring to work for breakfasts (30 seconds to a minute in the microwave per slice). This was delicious and tender even though I forgot to add the cheddar! It needs some seasoning, perhaps a half teaspoon of salt and pepper, maybe a little bit of garlic powder. Used seasoned breadcrumbs and parmesan (2:1 tablespoons was plenty) because I didn't want buy croutons just for this and it added such a nice flavor. I love cottage cheese recipes! With low fat cottage cheese, reduced fat cheddar and 4 eggs to stretch over 8 servings (and it's crustless, to boot), this is pretty healthy - this will be my new quiche base recipe!! Lined my pie pan with Reynolds nonstick foil and it worked great (no spray/grease) although Pam works just great as well. I can't wait to try some of the suggestions here - artichokes, sundried tomatoes, 2 eggs with eggbeaters, it all sounds good! Definitely echo the need to squeeze the liquid out of the spinach first!  LOVE Gina's idea about freezing the filling uncooked.  Update: had some leftover marinated artichokes and roasted red peppers and threw that in with pepperjack instead of the cheddar- that was SO GOOD - no seasonings needed. They complimented the spinach perfectly.

This recipe is delicious! My husband normally won't eat quiche and he loved this. Make sure you drain the cottage cheese as well as the spinach or your will get a VERY watery quiche. I found that pressing the cooked spinach in a rice press helped a lot!!

This was simply amazing. Not only the taste, but the process to make it. I thought making quiche would be difficult, but this is one of the easiest recipes I've done from AllRecipe. I did make a few changes. I didn't use croutons at all. I also added a 9in deep dish pie crust.(I just love the taste of pie crust) I actually sautéed my onions and greens peppers before mixing it. It just brought the taste out a little more. I wish I took the advice of another reviewer and used garlic powder because it sounds delicious. One main important thing is to drain the spinach as much as you can..you don't want moist quiche. Lastly, I didn't cook it on 325 instead I used 360 and left it in for an hour and 15mins. Again, this was a simple recipe and the taste worth it.

This was delicious and couldn't have been easier.  I followed the directions exactly, except I doubled the recipe so I could have leftovers.  As others suggested, I squeezed out the spinach before mixing in the other ingredients so it didn't make the quiche watery.  It was a lovely, healthy, light quiche that I will gladly make again.

This recipe came out excellent! I used low-fat or fat-free cottage cheese, cheddar, and croutons. I used only 2 eggs and substituted the other 2 with egg beaters, but that's just because I like to make healthified versions of everything. I will definitely make this again!

This is a great quick & easy Quiche recipe. I didn't have green onions so used regular onions. I only used 8 oz of cottage cheese & it was still very tasty.  I added a pie crust. Everyone really enjoyed it.  We will be using this recipe again for sure!

Perfect for my weekly meatless meal. Add a salad and you have a great dinner. I squeezed the water out of the spinach by hand before putting it in a pan and warming it. I had 3 oz. too little cheddar, so I added that amount of mozarella. It worked just fine. I also omitted the croutons hoping to cut calories just a bit.

This is a great recipe .. I've made some changes and it came out really delicious. I've sautéed the green onions and 3 cloves of garlic, then added half a red bell pepper and a some cayenne pepper (I like my food hot) then added mushrooms and the spinach. I added the cottage cheese (which I usually not fond of) and about 2 spoons of a cheese mixture, 6 eggs and into the oven. I omitted the crouton and it was really great and simple .. I would definitely do it again with more spinach. Thanks for a great recipe

I was looking for directions to make a non-crust quiche to decrease calorie and overall fat content, so tried this.  Switched out spinach, had  left over broccoli to use, added onions and mushrooms that were sautéed first, used various spices on those, a little African smoke on the broccoli, and reduced the cheese to about 1/3 of what recipe called for (not expecting cheese to be a major flavor ) and it was great. Will use basic concept again with different combo of spices and veggies.

I have made this recipe three times now. I made two for my sister's baby shower and I had many people pandering for the recipe! The only changes I made was add more cheddar cheese (can never go wrong with more of that). Also I used seasoned croutons, parmesan cheese, and bacon bits to top this wonderful tasty dish. Thumbs up for my taste buds!!!

Universal approval by my husband and my relatively picky kids, so that's notable! I really liked it. My only changes were adding an extra egg because four just didn't seem like enough - probably would've been fine but I will keep it at five next time too. So good, definitely a keeper of a recipe!

LOOOOOOOOVED it!
I just fried the spinach to begin (less moisture that way), with the onions and some mushrooms and added feta. My husband doesn't eat veg and he actually asked me to hold the meat...jaw dropping!!!

This is an easy and excellent recipe. It allows room for mistakes and omissions too. I've left out onion and was short on cheeses another time, and it still turned out great.

made this for easter brunch. my only problem was it seemed hard to tell when it was done, had to cook it forever. maybe I just didn't get enough moisture out of the spinach? Tasted pretty amazing, especially the next day.

Delicious!  I have made this many ways: as is, in regular & mini muffin tins (great finger food for baby/bridal  showers or for kids). I've swapped ham for the spinach.  I've used half whole eggs, half egg whites w/ fat free cheddar cheese. I have cooked it the day before, placed it in fridge overnight, & reheated it the next morning.  I've frozen the mini & regular muffin size & microwaved them for a quick breakfast when needed. Every way I've made it has been absolutely delicious!

I made this using 4 green onions, white and green parts.  I added salt and pepper, an extra egg and omitted the croutons, as we’re watching our carbs.  I also made sure to thoroughly squeeze the liquid out of the spinach.  I baked mine in an 11x7” baking dish for about 50 minutes.  I froze this in individual servings so Hubs can easily grab one for breakfast, and pop it in the microwave.

This quiche is delicious! It's a staple breakfast in our home now. I negated the croutons and sprinkled about a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder on the spinach while cooking. With no crust, this is a wonderful low carb breakfast. I make all my quiches like this now! Thanks!

Delicious and super easy.  I omit the onions and use onion powder.  I also use mozzarella instead of cheddar, but I've made it both ways and it's just preference, because either cheese works great!

I made this with crushed saltines instead of croutons, and a clove of garlic in place of the green onions(what I had on hand).  It was very good- the only thing I'd note about it is that it's not very eggy like I would have expected from a quiche.  If you love a really cheesy quiche, though, it's great!

Giving this recipe 5 stars, but I after making it directly by the recipe, I cut the spinach by 1/3, cheddar by 1/4 and graded the cottage cheese in food processor for less than minute. It is not the fluffiest, but very healthy. I threw in some pan fried mushrooms and would like to try it with onions and other random ingredients. Thank you for this great recipe!

Very yummy!  I sometimes have a diffcult time eating quiche because of its texture, but this quiche is not thick and easy to eat.  It has a very pleasing flavor.  I made this for a ladies brunch and everyone loved it.  It has no crust so next time I may try using a crescent roll crust.

Made this for a late supper, added 1/4 finely chopped onion, used a mixture of mozzarella and cheddar cheese & omitted the croutons because I'm not a fan.  I sprinkled freshly ground black pepper and fresh nutmeg on top.  Baked it for the full time & then let it rest for 10 minutes before cutting.  Now I wished I'd taken a picture because it was picture perfect, but we were hungry! DH said it's a keeper and I can make it again anytime.  Easy, too!

I was really bummed out by this recipe. I followed the ingredients and I was really disappointed. I'm not sure what I did wrong. The only thing I can think of is I used red onion instead of green onions...the quiche was very "oniony" and the spinach tasted blah. I usually love spinach. The spicing seemed off to me, but then again may be it was just the onions. Oh, and I used a little mozzerella cheese with the majority being chedder.

This is comfort food..so good! I used 2TBSP of dry ranch dressing mix in place of onion. I added 1/4c of real bacon bits and used a combiniation of swiss and cheddar, reserving a bit for the top with the crouton crumbs

My family came together for an early Christmas gathering this year.  We decided on having a brunch setting to simplify things.  I found this recipe and liked the ingredients and the idea that it was crustless!  Since my drive time to the holiday gathering was aprox. 5 hours, I made this the night before and at arrival, slid it in the oven with the other warming treats.  It was a hit.  The texture, lightness, and taste was perfect.  The hit of the party!

It turned out well.  I am accustomed to a richer quiche flavor, but I wanted to try this recipe to go more on the healthy side.  Next time I will compromise and substitute some of the cottage cheese for cream and I think I will enjoy it more.  Also a little garlic and onion powder give some extra flavor.

This recipe was awesome!!! I made it for my boyfriend and he loved it so much that I made a version for the both of us that I could eat too (lactose issues) So instead of cottage cheese and cheddar cheese I used 1/4 cup of toffuti sour cream, 3 tbsp toffuti cream cheese, and 1/2 cup veggie shreds mozzarella flavor.  He there was little difference between the two, so yay!

A very light and delicious quiche, reasonably healthy with plenty of flavor. Add a crust if you're in the mood, it will come out just fine.

I love this recipe because it's really quick, simple, and it doesn't broke my bank (really important since I'm a college student). My vegetarian boyfriend loooooves this dish. And from my personal experiences, guys don't really know the difference between dishes with many fancy ingredients (and hours to prepare and cook) with the dishes made simple just like this recipe. As long as the food is yummy and fulfilling, guys would enjoy it.

Excellent, very tasty. For those who found it lacking flavour, it could be your cheese. I also tried it with the ricotta cheese and found it just as good, not dry. This time I added some jalapeno but will add a little more next time and perhaps a bit of fresh ground pepper. The only thing I didn't care for were the crushed croutons. I didn't feel they added anything either time. I will perhaps use some Italian Bread Crumbs next time. Freezing sounds good too, will also give it a go.

I've never made a quiche and it was simple! It tasted like it was from a restaurant.  I didn't have the green onions.  I did have croutons that were garlic & butter flavored croutons (Marie Callender's)so I used them.  Simple and tasty recipe

Just tried this recipe with the Family for Boxing Day and they ALL loved it.  I made a mistake and put the croutons in the mix instead of on top but it was great none the less.  This is a super easy recipe.  Will definitely add it to the family cookbook!

I liked this recipe--very quick and easy to make.  I suggest you thoroughly drain the spinach though as it makes the quiche too watery.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and skipped the topping.  I think next time I'll use a different kind of pie though.  Maybe graham cracker to make it taste better?

this was VERY good.  i only used two green onions (all i had).  And I used fresh spinach that had been wilted down.  And I used a cheese blend.  Also, did not use croutons on top.  This tasted GREAT, even reheated in microwave later.  Only problem was liquid in the bottom of my dish.  Maybe use an extra egg??  Thanks--this will be replacing my fritatta!!

This was better than my old quiche recipe which was pretty good.  I did not have spinach so I used frozen chopped brocolli instead- shredded mozarella cheese instead of cheddar and added bits of ham.  We ate it very quickly because it was very delicious.  Thank you for the recipe.  It is a keeper.

Very easy to make.  I substitute the cheddar cheese with Italian Blend cheese and instead of the croutons on top I sprinkled just a little bit more cheese  and some diced tomato before I took it out of the oven.(Just until the cheese was melted) Yummy!

Too strong spinach taste.  Disappointing.

I cooked this for my parents and while it was a little bland tasting for me, they loved it. I had added a little garlic into the mix but you couldn't really taste it. A real easy and good recipe to make though.

It was not what I was expecting but it was okay.  I will probably try another recipe til I get the flavor I am looking for.

I bought a pre-made graham cracker crust in a pan and three of us were raving at the unique and delicious touch of its sweetness to compliment an already delicious recipe.

Made this quiche for my wife's friend's bridal shower and got rave reviews.  Never got to try it because when I got back from a hockey game it was all gone.  I am going to make it for a New Year's party though so I'll finally get to try it.  Highly recommend it.

I was so surprised at how well this recipe came out.  It was awesome and my picky family loved it.  Next time I think I might add parmesan cheese to it just to make it a little better.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

This was good, I just didn't find it fantastic. The cottage cheese kind of turned me off from the texture. I also used a pre-made frozen crust which absolutely added that bit of calm in this full flavored dish.

The flavour was great although my boyfriend and I both missed the crust. Next time we will make it in a crust, or maybe double (or triple) the crutons. Tasty!

Absolutely delicious!  And so easy!  You really must make this...I have served it to people claiming to like neither spinach nor quiche....they went back for seconds on this one!  Highly recommended, and easy to throw together last-minute.  I keep the ingredients on hand in case unexpected visitors arrive.  (I used 6 eggs instead of 4).  Thanks for the recipe!

This tasted and resembled an omlette more than a quiche.  Tasted good though!

It is nice to have a quiche without a crust.  It was just great.  Everyone really liked it.  This is a nice vercitile recipe where you can really add whatever you like.  To reduce the calories you can use low fat cottage cheese and it works just as well....I will use this recipe again!!!

I loved it!  My husband was not so impressed but I caught him going for seconds. Next time I will not put so may onions, they were a little strong for my taste.

This was great and minus the croutons it fit perfectly into my meal plans for my first two weeks of the South Beach diet. (Once I start adding carbs back in, I think I'll try it with croutons or ritz crackers).
