This is a favorite. The whole family loves it. My local grocery store doesn't carry the Zatarain's  Spanish Rice so I use the Rice-a-Roni brand. Rice-a-Roni makes more so I increase the water to 2 cups.  Also, I use the diced tomatoes with green chiles to add a little kick. Lastly, I always use closer to 2 pounds of steak, it doesn't require any changes to the rest of the recipe.

This is great, I've made it with Elk steak, Elk heart and sirloin beef steak and we loved them all. I added a red bell pepper to the veggies and garlic powder and onion powder to the meat.
