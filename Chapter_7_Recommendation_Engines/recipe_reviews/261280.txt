This recipe is super yummy! I used a gluten-free soup mix instead of canned soup. I chopped and sauteed boneless chicken instead of using rotisserie chicken. For the quinoa and steamed broccoli, I used my rice cooker set on the rice setting. I used powdered nutmeg instead of fresh. I've made it twice now, and I can hardly stop eating it. It's that good.

Really good way to make a quinoa casserole!  I like full flavor so I added 1 teaspoon curry & 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder.  Yum!

Made this tonight, but used a raw chicken breast cut up in small chunks in place of rotisserie chicken because that is what I had on hand. Since I figured the raw chicken would be juicier I also crumbled up two leftover cornbread muffins to absorb some of the juices figuring it would be like really moist like stuffing. It was not overly juicy at all, and actually looked like it might be a bit dry. However, I was pleasantly surpised that it actually wasn't dry tasting at all, and was quite tasty! This is a solid casserole dish to whip up, or even pre-make for a busy weeknight dinner. Will make this again. Next time I think I may just mix the Parmesan cheese in with the casserole, and top with more shredded cheddar so it's a little more gooey-cheesy goodness. My family all liked it. Everyone went back for seconds.

Surprisingly delicious.  Wasn’t sure about this recipe with the low amount of reviews but yum.  I didn’t use nutmeg (not a fan) or the Steva powder. Added garlic salt to taste and used boneless skinless chicken breast, made the rest as written. Next time will use 1 cup quinoa.  Will definitely be making this on a regular basis.
