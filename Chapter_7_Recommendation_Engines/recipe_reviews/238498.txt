I mixed up the dough the night before, let it chill overnight, then baked them the next evening. The dough was super easy to mix up. If you don't have a double boiler to melt your chocolate, chop the chocolate into small, even chunks, then melt in the microwave at 40-50% power, stirring every 30 seconds or so til melted. This should only take a couple minutes tops. I did find the dough difficult to work with and roll into balls. It was very sticky. It's best to roll all the balls first (or whatever amount fits on your pan - in my case, it was 16), then roll them all in the powdered sugar. Don't go back and forth between rolling into balls, and rolling in sugar. This gets very messy. I baked mine for exactly 9 minutes and they were perfectly done. A nice light minty flavor; not at all overpowering. The recipe only made 55 cookies for me, and I made sure they were about 1" balls (about 7-8 grams each).

Mmmmmmm!  Very good, but I think I would like them better if I doubled the mint extract.  While the cookie dough smelled rather minty, the flavor baked up very subtle.  I didn't have unsweetened chocolate, but I had unsweetened cocoa powder so I followed the guide on the cocoa to mix with oil as a chocolate replacement.  I thought the chocolate flavor came out just right!  These baked up to have a slightly crispy edge with a soft, puffy middle. Will make again and increase the mint.

Such a pretty and easy cookie to make . . . and delicious too! I halved the recipe and got 29 cookies, formed using my 1" cookie scoop. They are slightly crunchy on the outside, and then a bit chewy on the inside, with just a hint of peppermint, which I love. Lining your baking sheets with ReynoldsÂ® parchment paper makes clean up a breeze, and no need to worry about the bottoms sticking. These would make a great cookie for a cookie swap or a Holiday cookie tray.

Excellent instructions! Right down to the number of cookies it would make! I got 44 cookies out of my batch. Very easy recipe. I chilled dough for about 3 1/2 hours and it was very easy to work with. Chocolate and peppermint together taste great. Cookies are soft and really pretty too! The first new cookie recipe I have tried this holiday season that came out just like the picture!  Thanks for the recipe!!

These cookies are great! They have a nice cake-like consistency and a beautiful minty flavor. Chocolate and mint are my favorite combo, so this is a cookie I think I'll be making more often now.

My favorite cookie that I've ever made. I veganized it with flax eggs instead of eggs and coconut oil instead of shortening. Yum.

My cookies wound up flat. I think maybe an extra quarter-cup of flour (or more) is necessary. They tasted great, but were flat and that really wore out the crinkles. The 2nd time I made them I added more flour, but I didn't really measure it. Used dark choccy the second time too because we just prefer it and it's prettier. Came out great. Thanks, with reservations!

These cookies were very good and such a simple recipe to make. They look so beautiful when baked and were a perfect selection for our Christmas Cookie Exchange!The mint flavor is a bit strong for me so I would probably cut the mint down by half next time I make them. The Reynolds Parchment makes for very easy removal from the baking sheet.

My family loved these cookies, 24 of them were gone in less than 2 days. Crispy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside. No difficult at all to prepare. I left the dough rest for about three hours in the fridge  and the texture was perfect. I used my 1 inch cookie scoop to get the right amount of dough and my 9 year old daughter helped me form the balls and rolled them in powder sugar. I got 43 cookies out of this recipe and half of them put them in the freezer for another day.

Made these for the neighbors,but none were delivered.  My family loved them and would not allow them to leave the house.  Actually, I did made another batch.  Mine chilled well enough in a few hours... a bit messy but worth it!  Thanks for the greate recipe.

First, it's not chocolatey enough and second, the mint is so strong, that's all I taste.  It's very easy using the Reynolds Parchment Paper but the end product is not something I'll be making again.

This cookie is a tough one to rate for me; I'm torn between 3 & 4 stars.  Ultimately, 4 stars is "I liked it" and I did, so we'll go with 4.  One thing I DON'T like is having to wait for dough to chill.  If I'm baking, I want to get it all done NOW.  That being said, after the minimum two hours, the dough was ready to work with with no issues.  These taste good, but I only want one.  It's kind of like an after dinner mint where one is enough (which is not a bad thing).  I ended up yielding just shy of 4 dozen smallish cookies.  One thing I DO like is easy clean up and I liked not having to wash the cookie sheets since I'd used Raynolds (R) pre cut parchment sheets for cookie trays (which they provided, but my opinion is still my own; I'm not that easily bought).  THANKS for the recipe!

I did not care for this recipe. The dough was hard to handle, even though in the refrigerator 24 hours. My cookies ended up flat instead of round as shown in the pictures.

I made a Gluten Free version of this recipe by using rice flour, tapioca flour & sorghum flour.  I did 1/2 the recipe and had to add a 1/4 cup more tapioca flour & 1/4 cup cocoa powder, because the dough didn't seem stiff enough. The dough was still a bit sticky after chilling, but the cookies came out great.

The dough chilled over night and was very easy to work with. I got 50 cookies from this with a bake time of 13 minutes. The combo/ratio of chocolate to mint is perfect. I didn't think either flavour overpowered the other. They are definitely cake-y but they're still good, just an unexpected texture. They look pretty cool too!

This was an okay cookie.  The chocolate flavor was rather overpowered by the mint and it was very cake-y, so it was more of a powdered mint cake cookie.  It's good if you like that sort of thing, but it wasn't much to my taste.  The parchment paper did help, though, and the cookies were very easy to remove from the pan.  I only got 42 cookies.

I followed the recipe completely.  Once refrigerated the dough was easy to work with.  Tasty but wish the chocolate was a bit stronger.  I had a similar recipe That I lost (without the mint) that was a richer chocolate flavor.

The taste is pretty good but I am a bad judge of 1" balls of dough. I think mine were more like 1 1/2" and so I only yielded 36 cookies--nowhere close to 80!

Our son wanted to make these for Santa's cookie plate last year and boy Santa had a great treat.  These were great.  The mint is a nice touch.  He loved rolling them in the powder sugar.

I loved these and so did the people at the dessert potluck I brought them to, but I did add more mint extract. I'd like it if the mint were a more obvious flavour up-front as opposed to just an aftertaste, but I'm not sure how to correct that.

These came out kind of crazy.  I stuck to the recipe, except for using butter for shortening.  I also added an extra half teaspoon (because the container held 1 1/2 teaspoons, and I really didn't want to hang onto a tiny container of 1/2 tsp of extract), and that was apparently way too much.  The cookies were overwhelmingly minty.  I wanted them chocolatey, so I added two handfuls of chocolate chips, but when the first tray come out so minty, I added two more handfuls.  I cooked them nine minutes, and got 59 cookies.  They're really too minty, but they're also excessively chocatey, so they almost even out.  I would try them again with less mint.

My cookies turned out flat and undercooked, and since they'd spread much too much, it didn't seem worth it to keep cooking them.  I must have done something wrong, since everyone else's seem to have  turned out, but i haven't the faintest idea what.  Very disappointed.  :(

I prepared the cookie dough on Christmas Eve. I followed recepie step by step. Very easy to do. I placed cookie dough in refrigerator for 48hrs. I baked them this morning.  These cookies are delicious! ...and just enough mint and cocoa that when mixed together create a perfect hint of mint...not too overpowering.  My husband loves them!. Thank You

Simple and elegant cook recipe. Made for Christmas dinner tomorrow. Based on other reviews, I added 2 more ounces of chocolate and baked for 10 minutes. The balance of peppermint and chocolate was great. Will definitely add to my holiday goodie bags from now on. Using a 1" cookie scoop, the recipe yielded 52 2" cookies. Not sure what the size would be to yield 80 as the recipe indicates. Also, my first time using parchment paper - big fan now!

I loved the chocolate mint flavors in this cookie. Easy to make too. Just be sure to chill the dough long enough. I froze half the dough balls to serve some on my Christmas cookie platter.

After having just recently removed these treats from the oven I must say these cookies are a repeat must. 

I believe my attempt to be oversize (32) but successful with an alteration in cooktime(approx. 13 min). 

On the next attempt I wouldn't change much. The lovely mix of spices is warm and very Christmas-like.
My boyfriend is still at this moment "clearing up casualties". I'd be surprised if I had any left to gift come the 25th!
