I love ragu or bolognese sauces and have been tweaking the one I usually use.  This recipe was great and seemed to solve all the problems of the one I had been using.  Turned out perfect, and as always well worth the time and effort!  Classic bolognese with good flavor.

This sauce was amazingly rich. It also freezes well and actually is better after the freeze.

LOVE this recipe!!!  Prep and cooking times are long; however it is that recipe for special occasions or when you have extra time on your hands.  Have always received compliments on this dish.  I do tend to add a couple of bay leaves and some oregano and other italian seasonings.  ALWAYS get requests at home for this meal.

This recipe was great.  I made it a few days before we ate it and the flavors really came together.  I can do without the celery though.  Instead of just adding basil I used my homemade pesto about 1/4 cup.  I think I will use more pesto next time but it gave it a great taste.  I might try spaghetti next time.  Fettuccini is not my favorite.

This dish is sinfully delicious.  I hadn't cooked with 3 different ground meats before.  It really made a difference.  I used hot Italian sausage instead of mild.  I added extra canned tomatoes to the leftovers to suit my taste for a less meaty sauce.  The pancetta added a lot to the flavor too.  I'm adding this to my recipe collection.

Love this recipe.  It is even better a few days later.  I substituted ground beef for the pork and used 1 pound of sausage (2 spicy and 2 mild italian sausages).  I also used 2 cans of whole, peeled tomatoes and 2 cans of crushed tomatoes with sauce.  Finally, I added a small can of tomato paste.  I will be making this again as it is worth the time.

so so so good!  Thanks.  I made this with chorizo sausage and added a can of tomato paste as well.  I made it a couple days before my dinner to let the flavours meld!  We loved it with homemade noodles!

I do not use the meats that this recipe called for, therefore I only used bacon and bracciole (rolled up beef slices with parm cheese and garilc in the middle) I've never made sauce with milk in it...very good!
   A nice heavy sauce for a cold day.

I think this was an ok recipe for pasta sauce.  I felt the whole ordeal was too labor intensive for the result.  Granted, I'm not particularly familiar with bolognese sauce, and was trying this for the first time.  Really though, I don't think I'll make it again, the only reason that I'm giving this dish a 3 is because I don't think I'd like this sauce period, even in a restaurant.

Great recipes. My family loved it. I used dry parsley basil  and thyme. Also the store had no ground veal. But used ground pork. It  still tasted good.  I looking forward  to making this recipe for a pot luck dinner.

This recipe is absolutely the best. With the exception of using heavy cream instead of milk, I do not make any changes to the recipe.  I make the sauce the day before serving so the flavors can meld together.  I think this recipe yields a sauce far superior than I have had.  My family and friends love this recipe and request that I make it often.  Thanks Steve!!!!

I loved this bolognese sauce! The color came out perfect -- not too red (indicative of too much tomato) and not too brown (not enough tomato). The sauce, while thin, is full of flavor. And, even though I'm not a huge fan of visible veggies in a sauce like this, they did not interrupt the flavor or texture of the sauce. I actually also served this over spaghetti squash and substituted the milk for coconut milk. Still perfect.

A solid 5 stars. Kept all ingredients as is. I browned the veggies and meat separately, though. Combined everything and brought to a simmer on the burner, but then transferred the sauce uncovered to a preheated 290 degree oven and let it go for about 2.5 hours. Broke up tomato chunks at the end. Definitely a keeper. I will not season with salt next time, though. I think it gets plenty from the pancetta and added cheese.
