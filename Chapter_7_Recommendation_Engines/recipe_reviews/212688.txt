Don't walk, RUN toward this recipe after Thanksgiving and you are so sick of thanksgiving turkey sandwiches that you can hardly stand it!  This salad is FANTASTIC!  I made it and immediately put it over a bed of lettuce (did not put it in the refrigerator for the suggested 2 hours), and my family (including a 13 year old boy) LOVED it.  My husband is eating seconds as we speak!  An excellent recipe and perfect for the leftover turkey after the holidays.

Very tasty salad~ Had to add extra Mayo for creaminess though. I make a similar salad with toasted pecans and craisins.

Loved this turkey salad, simple and delicious , I switched the raisings for craisins, just because I had some left from thanksgiving , I also put walnuts instead of the sunflower seeds we always have them in the house.
Next time I will omit the salt altogether, don't think is necessary, the mayonnaise has enough. The 1/2 of a lemon 's juice is the perfect touch.
Thanks, I'm very happy with the result

My family of six loves this recipe (kids aged 7 years to 15 months).  We buy turkeys in November when they're on sale, keep them in the stand up freezer, and then grill throughout the year for a healthy meat that doesn't heat up the house.  Some portion of every turkey gets made into this salad.  Sometimes I use the sunflower/raisin combo and other times the pecan/cranberry.  Both work well; just depends what is on sale at the time.   Great with my husband's homemade rosemary raisin bread.  Keeps well for the next day, too.

Super easy, a change and a flexible recipe! What could be better? I didn't have sunflower seeds, so I used pecans. In addition to raisins, I had craisins, so I used both. I had celery, which I normally use in a Waldorf salad, so I added it. (I wish I had sweet cranberry relish still.) Excellent for when your family is getting sick of the turkey-- we had no leftovers.

My husband liked this a lot, and it's a nice change from tuna salad.  Next time maybe I'll try it with the craisins and nuts instead of seeds, as others mentioned.

I used this to mKe a wrap. It was good. I had some leftover cranberry sauce so I spread about 1 tbsp on the bottom of the wrap and then used some of the turkey salad. I topped it off with some shredded cabbage. I made the salad as written except I felt I needed a bit more mayo to make it creamy. I didn't add any salt  and used craisins instead of raisins. Just a personal preference. We really enjoyed this as a wrap. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

The only change I made was to substitute the raisins for dried cranberries.  I would definitely make this again.

This is really nice and flexible as you can tell by the other reviews.  I had small sweet peppers, celery, finely chopped kale and almond slices to add but I'm sure it is delicious per the recipe.

Excellent with the recommended reviewer substitution with dried cranberries and pecans.  This salad works on a bed of lettuce or in a wrap.  Everyone has their personal preference.  I am giving 4 stars as the recipe submitted.

Great way to use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey!  Easy and fast.  Used pecans instead of sunflower seeds as that is what I had and they were a nice addition.  Could use some extra mayo to make it a little more creamy if you're willing to send the calories on that- I thought it was fine as written but hubs liked more mayo

Made this today and used it in whole wheat roll ups with cranberry mustard.  It is sooooo good!  Thank you for this easy and delicious recipe!

Was very good on leftover rolls from Thanksgiving. I liked the use of sunflower seeds, never thought of that before. I added a bit of red onion and another tablespoon of mayo. My sunflower seeds were salted, so I cut back on the salt. I'm going to try this with leftover chicken also. I ate the leftovers right out of the bowl for breakfast in the morning.

My daughter hates Turkey, but loves this!!! The flavor blend so well this is perfect on a bed of lettuce, on potato bread, or plain. I highly recommend. I made it twice. The first time followed the recipe the second time made it with pecans and cranberries instead of raisins and sunflower seeds. Both we equally successful. Perfect for leftover Turkey.

Very good! I didn't have any raisins, so I used dried cranberries and apricots instead.

This is an easy recipe to adapt to whatever you have on hand.  I used pecans instead of sunflower seeds, regular salt instead of sea salt and added a sprinkling of black pepper and a bit of soy sauce.  I  threw everything together without measuring and headed out the door to work.   Delicious!  Even my husband who isn't an apple fan liked it.

My grandchildren devoured this!!!! What a GREAT way to reduce my leftover turkey!!  I used chopped walnuts instead since I had those on hand instead of the sunflower seeds. I also didn't have the lemon juice so I just added a little more mayonnaise to make it moist.  I didn't put it in the refrigerator since it was time for lunch and it was still delicious.  I will definitely be making it again.

Sorry, but I did not care for this recipe at all. I do not understand all the good reviews. Perhaps the fact that I only had granny smith apples, and not the super sweet apples, made the difference? It was just so bland. It was not totally inedible, because I could eat it if I had to, but I chose to toss it. I even let it sit the fridge a whole other day to see if it was any better...but nope. It was such an easy recipe, I just wish I could understand how my experience with it was so bad when apparently everyone else was in love with it.  On to the next leftover turkey recipe!

This salad was awesome! We had it for dinner after letting it sit for 1 1/2 hours-the flavors blended together well. I used 1/2 t. lemon juice, since I didn't have fresh lemon. My daughter was not a fan of fruit mixed in, but my husband says she will like it when she's older. He loved it and will take it for lunch tomorrow
