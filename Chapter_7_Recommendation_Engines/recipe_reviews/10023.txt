We have completely rewritten this recipe for clarity and we have also added flour to it. It should work well now. We always appreciate comments about bad recipes from users so that we may correct them immediately.

I saw the bad reviews on this recipe and I almost didn't try it, but I am so glad that I did!  These gingerbread cookies taste so much like the real thing it's uncanny.  My daughter has an egg allergy, so anytime we can do holiday baking together it is such a treat.  Thanks for submitting this great recipe!

This is a great eggless cookie. I didn't even bother to roll them out. Just used a small ice cream scoop, rolled them in additional white sugar and pushed them down with the bottom of a glass. Mmmmm.

This is possibly the worst cookie recipe I've ever tried to make. I felt a strong responsiblity to review this. I followed the directions PRECISELY, and what I got was a sizzling pile of smokey molasses junk in my oven that nearly ruined my pan! For the first time in my 25 years of baking, I actually threw away the remainder of my batter. My house stinks and all I can say is that this is the biggest waste of ingredients because there MUST be something missing. I realize that eggless recipes don't always come out perfectly, but this is ridiculous. This is awful!

Made these tonight for a function where a child is allergic to milk and eggs and they came out GREAT! We used cookie cutters and followed the recipe to a T and they taste wonderful. Will be using this recipe again and again!

The revised recipe with flour works great! just let dough chill in the refridgerator for half hour before you roll out and cut into shapes!

These are actually very good.  I followed the recipe with the exception of the following:  1. I made half a batch 2. I used 1 cup spelt/ 1 cup white flour 3. I used becel olive oil spread instead of shortening. 4. I dropped from teaspoon and flattened as suggested by another reviewer.  5. And I added a pinch of seasalt.  The result was awesome & vegan. Bonus: house smells so yummy!! Thanks!

If it were possible to give this recipe a negative star rating, I would.  Two minutes into the oven and my house was filled with smoke.  I almost had to throw away my pan.  I followed the directions exactly.  Maybe there are some ingredients missing or the measurements are way off.  These are horrible...

This is really nice.  My dad is a vegan, and can't eat meat or dairy products.  The holiday season is filled with Gingerbread recipes with milk, which we can substitute with plain soymilk, and eggs, which we can't substitute anything for.  This recipe is a lifesaver, and a heartwarmer.My father loves this gingerbread recipe, and asks for it specificaly every christmas.  Thanks to the really fast baking and prep time, the cookies are done at the longest time of 30 minutes. Thank you so much for entering this great recipe.  I seriously don't know what i would do without it.  This is the most thoughtful recipe I have ever seen, and I thank you Annette.  The first time we made these cookies was the first time my father had homemade, warm, and delious gingerbread cookies in a long time. 

           Thank You So Much!

Finally an good eggless recipe! I'm kinda sick of people posting recipes in the dairy-free section that contain eggs.  I don't eat eggs.  Thanks!

I couldn't even wait to finish baking them to write my review.  My son has an egg allergy so I was thrilled to find this recipe.  However, the dough was way too dry and took me half the night to get to a consistency that I was able to roll out (adding water and working with my hands).  Next time I would cut down on the flour and then only add as needed.  The taste was fine, would never know the egg is missing.  Drop cookies would probably work better but be prepared if you want to roll out for Gingerbread Men!

Great cookie to make with little kids who try to eat the batter (since there is no raw egg in it) and they were very tasty as well

These were okay until they cooled. Now they are hockey pucks.  I'm going to give this recipe some credit by saying maybe I baked them too long (first time I've used a dark cookie sheet), but I will NOT be trying these again.  They were also pretty easy to make, the consistency was right after sticking the dough in the refridgerator for 20 minutes.

These cookies taste good, but I did have trouble with them maintaining their shape. Maybe it was because I used gluten-free flour. I tried to do cut-outs, but the cookies just spread, so I just gave up and made them all round. Having said that, with gluten-free flour, these cookies are safe for all food allergies I can think of!

Pretty good.  I baked them for 7 minutes.  I didn't roll them out, just spooned on to sheet and flattened with a glass.  Not as pretty as the picture but not bad tasting at all.

I used ginger paste and I could barely taste the ginger in the cookie.  However, they ended up tasting just like Archway molasses cookies, which are some of my favorite.  My daughter is allergic to eggs so I wanted a Christmas cookie she could have.  This made a tasty cookie.  I only used three cups of flour and rolled them into balls, coated them with sugar and pressed them with the bottom of a glass like someone else suggested and they turned out fantastic.

It was a great recipe. I wasn't sure how it would turn out, but I was happily surprised. 
The only changes I made were, instead of a cup of sorting I used a cup of unsalted butter, and I added a rounded half teaspoon of allspice, black pepper, and cloves. Also added a rounded quarter teaspoon of salt. They are amazing and spicier than the original recipe.

This is a great one whether you're vegan or NOT.  Aunt Patty's Blackstrap Molasses makes for a richer experience, Brer Rabbit for a sweeter one.  

Wax paper makes the roll out process neater/easier, reducing excess flour mess.  Tomato sauce can makes an ideal cookie cutter when rolled to 1/4" thickness.  

Usually 6 minutes cook time for first batch, 5 minutes for all subsequent.  Perfect crispness happens while they still seem a little gooey off the pan.  Makes 2 1/2 pans of 16, the way I roll and cut 'em.

Outstanding ice cream sandwich building material here.  We're lucky we have Nicoco across the street, world-class local vegan ice cream.

A week before payday, and I had to find a cookie recipe that uses only ingredients in my pantry.  This one fit the bill.  I used a 3" cookie cutter and cooked for 7 minutes. I will add more spice, and roll in sugar, before baking next time.  The dough consistency would be perfect for gingerbread men.  Note: These cookies harden considerably after they cool; if you want them to remain chewy, cook for less than 7 minutes.

These cookies were very good. I actually replaced the ginger with pumpkin spice (because I was all out at the moment), added a touch of vanilla, and sprinkled the tops of the cookies with sugar. This is a great quick and basic recipe.

I had to use margarine instead of shortening and added 1/2 tsp of fresh, pulverized ginger root along with the ground ginger. In the end, the dough was much too dry to roll out so I just splashed a tinsie bit of water on it (bad idea). Had to undo that with more flour. Anyway, they turned out great! Experimented a bit with baking time (only cause I forgot them in the oven!) So one batch was in for about 10 minutes, the other about 17-18 minutes. The first batch is fine, nice and bready. But I prefer the cookies that I left in too long. They're very crunchy when cooled but I really enjoy the crunch! Could almost be stone cookies if I baked them at a lower temp and left them in longer :)

i made these for someone who can't have eggs or refined sugar, so i used honey and a bit extra baking soda and flour instead of the sugar, and they turned out better than my usual recipe. very chewy and quite enjoyable!

My cookies turned out great.  I used 3 1/4 flour in the batter and the remainder for rolling out.  I chilled the batter.  These are very tasty and good for my grandson who has a dairy allergy.

I have struggled with eggless ginger cookies, these came out perfect! I didn't have molasses so substituted with maple syrup, didn't have enough topped that up with traditional syrup, worked!!

Glad I tried these, was hesitant after reading bad reviews. I’m not easily pleased but these were very good. I didn’t have milk, eggs or butter and was wanting something sweet to eat. These filled the void. Will be making them for Christmas for sure. Very easy to make.

I doubled the ginger, halved the recipe and rolled really thin.

This was an ok cookie, chewy when first came out of the oven, but was hard when they cooled down.  Be sure to not over bake. Bake for approx. 6 min and take out and leave them on the pan for a min. or two.  You also don't need 4 c. of flour I used a little less than 4 c. and they came out dry I added extra molasses to moisten the batter.

This is a great cookie. It made me think of the ginger snaps my Mom used to make!
