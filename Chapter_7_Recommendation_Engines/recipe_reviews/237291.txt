I substituted canola oil for the butter, and added 1/4 cup of Truvia and a half bag of Enjoy Life chocolate chunks.  The dough was pretty moist so I refrigerated it for an hour and then baked the cookies at 375 degrees (not 400) for 14 minutes.  Delicious!

just made these Tonight. followed all on the direction's. they were very bland. I'm not even into sweets and even I thought they needed something sweeter. I think next time I'll use a teaspoon of honey. the texture was good and the recipe was easy.

I was afraid the cookies  wouldn't hold up, that they would fall apart, but, they held up great!!!   I really liked them!!!   I was also afraid they wouldn't be sweet enough for my husband, which they weren't.  I definitely plan on making them again, but, will add some coconut sugar, chopped raw organic dates, and lots of organic raisins.

I added 1/4 brown sugar and it still doesn't taste as sweet peanut buttery as I prefer.  I like the idea of flax seed in it though.
