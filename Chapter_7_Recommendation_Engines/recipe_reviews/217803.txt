This is a wonderful, classic margarita recipe.  Very light and refreshing.  It would have earned 6 stars except for the instructions.  I am SURE it is supposed to say "Combine the ingredients WITH ice and shake vigorously."  A warm margarita is less than refreshing.

Just made these and everyone loved them. Didn't change a thing but squeezed some lime juice on top! Big hit!

We really enjoyed this.  Instead of the mix we used fresh lime juice cut with sparkling water.  I never cared for tequila until I tried the Sauza Silver, Blue agave

Loved, Loved, Loved this Margarita! I used a "light" (4 cal/serving) margarita mix. Absolutely De-Lish!

If you like to entertain, you might like to have a simple recipe for the classic margarita. A good bartender will tell you the secrets to making a good one include using top shelf tequila and lots of fresh lime juice, squeezed into the drink before you serve it. Enjoy!
