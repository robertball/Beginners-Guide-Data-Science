I've made this several times. It's always gobbled up! Do NOT leave off the cucumbers, they give it a wonderful flavor! This is one of the dips I make that EVERYBODY loves!

This recipe is awesome. I've made it twice now. The first time I used up some non-fat cream cheese that I had and the family loved it. This last time I used regular cream cheese and it was even better. I omit the lettuce and cucumber and put sliced black olives on top. I also started the bowl by slicing out a section and putting it on a plate -- that really helped because our guests weren't being agressive enough with it and were missing the bottom layer. My family knows better now and digs right in!

This dish is devoured everytime I bring it to an social event. When I get invited places, this is requested for me to bring.  I make no alterations or additions, it's loved as is.  It even presents very well.  This is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!

it was good...would try it again.   i think next time i'll leave out the mayo and try to add more cream cheese and sour cream.  i like thicker dips and the mayo made it too creamy for me.  i wasn't sure about the cucumber on top or the cocktail sauce...but it works!!!  i made it for a bridal shower and there wasn't any left!!!!

I made this for my 6-yr. old nieces' b-day party and I received a dozen requests for the recipe.  I used light cream cheese and light mayo.  no one new and there was no left.

I have made this many times and I never have any leftovers. I don't add as much lettuce and I omit the seafood sauce and I use medium or hot salsa. I add red, green and yellow peppers and both black and green olives and lots of cheese. I think you can add what every you like to the top and it will always be a big hit.

This was easy. It was good. It is a good party dip because you make it ahead of time. I would make it again. I did not include the cucumbers I don't know they seemed out of place.

Oh goodness, this is delicious!  This is really the best nacho dip ever-what a nice change to the ordinary taco dips.  The cocktail sauce adds such a nice taste to it and I also loved the addition of cucumber.  Everyone that tried this loved it, it looked fabulous in the bowl and tasted absolutely terrific-what more could you ask for in a recipe?  Thanks for sharing.

Very good, maybe not the best ever, but definitely worth making again! I added some onion and garlic powder to the cream cheese mixture for a little more taste. Also, use finely shredded lettuce (works better with the chips).

I have made this recipe for several different gatherings and it is always the first thing to go!  We don't always add the cocktail sauce and we usually substitute shredded spinach for lettuce. One of our favourites!!

I have taken this recipe to so many parties I can't count.  It is always a hit and there are never leftovers.  A simple suggestion is to let the cream cheese layer sit in the refrigerator for an hour so the cocktail sauce is easier to spread. Everyone loves this!

I've made this a few times and it always disappears pretty quickly.  I made a few changes because I'm a guy who likes a little more substance to my dips, so I added 1/2 pound of hamburger with taco seasoning and some jalapenos.  pretty awesome recipe

I AGREE - ABSOLUTELY The BEST Nacho Dip Ever! I did add tomatoes to the top - as I love tomatoes with pretty much everything, but would have been great with or without!!! Great job/recipe!

I have made this recipe a number of times and am always asked to bring it to get togethers. Sometimes I use light mayo, cream cheese & sour cream and it's still good. Although it may sound strange, the cocktail sauce and cucumbers really work and add to the extremely fresh taste. I like to cut the veggies a day or two ahead of time and refrigerate in containers on paper towels. Seems to keep the dip from getting too watery.

AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!  This is SOOOOOOO DELICIOUS!!!!  I made very slight changes and I think they made a huge difference, but the basic recipe still deserves 5 stars.  I used a combo of shredded Monterey Jack and Cheddar and added a small can of sliced black olives on top for color.  But, the MOST important change I made, was to eliminate all of the shredded lettuce and used a big bunch of chopped cilantro instead.  OUTSTANDING!!!  My family and guests RAVED!!

For two cents I'd add this under "Main Dish".  Just one of those things that could soooo easily replace your total plans for dinner.  Yep, it's THAT good!

A little conflicted on this one. I thought it was an excellent veggie dip, but not what I think of when I want a nacho dip. However my meat loving husband could not stop eating this. Hence the five stars. The only change I made was to top the dish off with diced  cucumber and cilantro.

Very easy recipe. It was made for a school Spanish class party by my daughter; everyone, she said, loved the dip!!! She forgot to include the layer of green bell pepper; but she said no one missed it. I think it needed the crunch of the bell pepper. I also don't think it needs the mayo. The cocktail sauce gave it a nice zing. Next time, I am going to mix cream cheese and sour cream with some chopped cilantro; skip the mayo. Definitely will use a spicier cocktail sauce and salsa. The cucumbers were a very nice touch. Used multigran tortilla chips to eat with dip. This recipe is a keeper!!! We will make it again, with a little tweaking.

Everyone loved this! Personally, I prefer everything really, finely diced- so individual flavors aren't too overwhelming. Make the shredded cheese the last layer, cover w/plastic & refrigerate for about 1-2 hrs.  Excellent even two days later!

I made this dip for my daughter's baby shower and it looked so attractive and it was very good.  I can't say it is the best.  Those that tried it- loved it.  I didn't use a few items-the cocktail sauce and the red bell peppers and it was still very good.

Fresh and delicious.  A great change from heavy cheese dip.  I made it without any changes.

Everyone loved this dip! I modified it a bit. I mixed the cream cheese, sour cream and mayonaise, then added some taco seasoning. Used this mixture as the first layer of the dip. Then added salsa as the second layer (I agree with the other reviewer who said Pace Chunky medium is best). Then the next layer was a mixture of orange peppers, green onions, tomatoes and lettuce. I then topped it with a mexican cheese mix (chedder, mozzerella and jalapeno flavored cheese - prepackaged like this). It was a hit all night. The pan was totally cleaned out ;) I never ended up adding the cocktail sauce, but it would have been a nice addition.

I took this to work and everyone thought it was wonderful.  I think it's a nice 
change from the usual layered taco dips.  My husband thought there were too 
many peppers, but he's not a big fan of peppers.  That was the only complaint
I heard.  I will make this again.

I loved this recipe and will use it often!  Instead of using the cucumbers, I added sliced black olives to the top of the dip and it was a big hit!

Well, good, different....my mother loved it, said it was "light", i didn't add the peppers, (not a pepper family). I did add diced tomatoes and 1/2 with olives. The Cucumbers indeed compliment the dip very nicely. All that said, likely wouldn't make it again.

I have made this for a few gatherings and everyone loves it.  I did make a few minor changes to make it easier to eat and a little more for my taste.  I added several tablespoons of Tapatio sauce to the cocktail sauce because I like it a little spicy.  I also made a mixed salad for the top, instead of layering. I mixed some iceberg lettuce and some shredded green leaf lettuce with chopped cucumber, the bell peppers and some cilantro.  This made it much easier to eat and very delicious.  I recommend this one to anyone!

Thought this was a great recipe.  The only changes I made was to the toppings - seemed like it needed a little more.  I added sliced olives, chopped jalepeno peppers & omitted the cucumbers.  I was going to put them on but my husband said no (he doesn't really like them)  We both thought it was great and unique tasting compared to other taco dips out there.  Will definitely make again!

I had to come back.  I've made this recipe several times and everyone loves it.  It gets gobbled up and I always get compliments.

hmmmm....not certain what I did wrong but this didn't turn out for me. Maybe I'n not the best nacho dip maker and I deserve the 2 stars rather than the recipe. Even though the salsa didn't appear watery, I strained it - so..I may have removed needed moisture out of the saucy part of the salsa. I halved the recipe but I think if I do that again, I'll use the entire sc/cc mixture called for in the primary recipe because it was pretty skimpy when layered at the bottom of the bowl. I liked the idea of cucumber so after I spread the finely cut lettuce on top, I diced the cucumber and spread a ring of it on top of the lettuce around the edge of the bowl and sprinkled black olives on top of the lettuce in the middle. Most of the chips broke off when we tried to dip them including those shaped like a scoop. I'll probably tinker around with this a little and see if I can get myself up to at least 3 stars.

When I was making this, I thought my husband and two sons would hate it. Out of the three 'football sunday' appetizers I made, this was the hands down winner. The cocktail sauce does add unexpected kick to this easy to make dip.

What can I say that someone hasn't already said? This was great! I had my doubts, because of all the liquid from the salsa + cocktail sauce, but it was fine. The only thing to consider, is if you like olives, you could add a layer of them. I'll be making this again and again. Yum! Thanks for the recipe, Jeff.

This was a really delicious variation to all the other nacho dips that are out there.  I followed the directions exactly, with the exception of adding chopped black olives to the top.  It was great.  It was a tad watery after sitting due to the salsa,  I think draining the salsa would be a good tip as a previous reviewer recommended.  Thanks for the recipe Jeff,  I'll be taking it to our company Christmas treat day,  along with copies of the recipe.  I'm sure many will request it.

I had my In-laws over for chicken wings and salad the other night.  So I tried this dip first for an appetizer......Let me tell you it sure lives up to it's name.  EVERYONE loved this from my 70 yr old father-in-law to my 6 yr old son.  Try this dip at you next gathering you will not be sorry.  A really tasty dip!!!  
P.S.  Drain the mild salsa before you use it in the dip beacuse it was just a little watery, but very very good.  I served it with small tortilla chips.

This IS the best nacho dip ever! The cream cheese, cocktail sauce and salsa go together perfectly.  Dont omit the cucumbers - it seems weird to add them, but they work GREAT with the recipe. I will definately be making this again!

I love this recipe - my children go wild over it and always request it as a treat at parties. I do use the cocktail sauce (the kids don't even notice it!); I prefer to use PACE chunky salsa (medium) - it doesn't get watery. I don't bother with the cucumbers but do put on the lettuce (finely shredded) - I have not had one child/teenager say they don't like this dip!

I made this dip for the Superbowl. It was a lot of work, chopping all the vegetables and after all that hardly anyone ate it which was disappointing. This recipe should not be called a nacho dip as it is mostly vegetables. It tasted fresh and was ok, but it was watery in consistency and isn't a dip I would make again.

Absolutely fabulous. Got great raves. I used medium hot chunky salsa, replaced cucumber with chopped olives and topped it all with some chopped, seeded tomatoes. It disapeared fast. Yum, Yum. However, it does not makes 64 servings. 10 ladies took care of it all by themselves.

This dip was a smash hit! I made a few minor adjustments to the recipe though. I doubled the amount of cocktail sauce and skipped the lettuce and cucumbers (I thought that they would be awkward to balance on the tortilla chips). I served the dip with lime flavored tortilla chips, that also made a big taste difference. Everyone loved it!!!

I tend to like mexican layered dips, and just found that I missed the texture of having beans in this dish. I also found the mixture of mayo, sour cream, and cream cheese to be too much, without something to tone it down. I did add garlic powder as some suggested for added flavor. I served this for a gourp of friends at a movie night and there weren't many takers. Just not to the groups tastes I think. Not bad overall, but needs some tweaking.

was not the "absolutely best nacho dip ever"  I don't understand what the rave reviews were.  Family and friends did not care for it.

This stuff is DELISH!  So different from the "usual" layered dips.  It was a big hit at our Christmas party!  As long as you set your cut up veggies on paper towels to absorb the liquid, the dip doesn't get watered down at all.  I will definitely make this again and again :-).

Made these for the game today. These were wonderful! I really had my doubts about the cocktail sauce. I used light or low fat cream cheese, sour cream, mayo and cheese. I omitted the cukes and peppers and added seeded, chopped tomatoes and (only on hubby's side) sliced, black olives. The bagged shredded lettuce from the produce section was good for this recipe, but I only used about 1 cup. Thanks so much for the post!

The cocktail sauce gave the salsa a weird taste. It might have been better with the lettuce on top, but I omitted that like others suggested.  There are a lot of better dip recipes out there.

The base was fine.  The SC/mayo kept it from becoming a chip breaker like reg. CC can. I did use Pace chunky salsa, as other readers had suggested.

I think you could expand this greatly - make it different every time.  I would suggest using any combination of the following:
med or hot salsa (thought the mild was no help)
fresh jalapenos, seeded and finely chopped
green salsa or tomatillo salsa
fresh yellow onion
definitely use black olives
thinly slice iceberg lettuce and use more than 2 c. (IMO)
Put a good thinly shredded cheese on there.
Be sure to finely dice the veggies you choose.  My husband did my chopping and the pieces were just a little big for the chips.

I think Fritos would be good with this.  I served it in a very shallow white Chantal dish and it was not runny until the next day but it was still good.

I look forward to playing with this.  If I come up w/something spectacular, I will post it here.

I have made this dip several times and everyone loves it.  I added 1/3 cup of cocktail sauce as I like the flavor.  Also used Mixed Mexican cheeses and do not  add the cucumber slices as they get in the way of dipping.  Frito scoops are great with this.

The only problem that I had was that the salsa made the dip runny.  I made it earlier in the day and quite a bit of water was coming out of it when I served it.  The cocktail sauce does taste so good in it and I did use olives instead of cucumber.  I am thinking of trying it w/out the salsa next time.

I used a glass pie plate to layer this into.  It was the perfect size.  No one in our house likes green onions, so I chopped up a yellow onion instead and it was fine.  The only complaint is that at our party, the cucumbers made people go "THIS is a nacho dip?"  As it turned out, no one ate the cucumbers.  They were pretty, but not really appropriate for a dip.  Next time I'll put a ring of whole black olives around the top, or just sprinkle some sliced black olives on the top.  Otherwise, wonderful flavor.  Don't omit the cocktail sauce, it really makes the dip.

I made this as an appetizer for a gathering of friends.  It was gone in twenty minutes.  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out wonderful.  It has such a unique taste, a cool taste and not as heavy as some other dips.  This recipe is a keeper!

The cocktail sauce makes a big difference in this dip.  I really like it alot.  It also doesn't have refried beans which seem to dominate most other nacho dips.

I had never made a dip like this before. It was good. Most of it was eaten. I omitted the cucumbers and added olives and hot peppers. I wasn't sure what size dish to put it in so I used a 9" x 13" glass baking dish. That worked out well.

Delicious! I've taken it to parties and people love it!  The cocktail sauce makes it stand apart and people notice there is something different about it but can't figure out what it is.  Be mindful of the salsa...try to keep it thick and chunky so it doesn't water it down.  Thanks to Jeff for submitting this.

It was nice to try something other than the ordinary bean nacho dip, however, this was a huge disapointment. I let all my veggies sit on paper towels for an hour before assembling (as was suggested)it was still a goopy mess. Cocktail sauce added nice flavor, but cream cheese was tasteless and over powered both cocktail sauce and salsa. Not worth the effort or expense.

Easy to put together and the taste is great. I can not always find cocktail sauce so i substitute it with salsa and the taste is great. I do find though that it can get watery if it sits to long.

fantastic - like other comments i also use chunky salsa, substitute red or orange pepper for green pepper, and put black olives and chopped tomatoes on top.

excellent dip - I added a bit of taco seasoning to the bottom layer which gave it a nice spicy flavour.  Even better the next day!

This has become the most requested recipe when I ask "what can I bring".  I make no changes.  I just sit back and enjoy the praise.  One person said.... "you just want to put your face in it and eat your way out".... that about sums it up...this recipe is WONDERFUL !!!

Everyone loved it...especially since it was vegetarian.  I accidentally misread the recipe and put 8 oz. of cream cheese instead of 1/4 of the package.  Several people thought it would be better with more of the peppers.  I made enough for ten but eight of us ate all of it.  Will definitely make it again.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  And, it is so easy!

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make!!  Everyone at the party was raving about this recipe and wanted it.  The cocktail sauce gives it a really good flavor.  This recipe is great for chip dipping!!

I made a couple of modifications to the recipe based on what I had on hand (used black olives instead of lettuce, for instance.)  The only trouble I had with this is that I... you know... couldn't stop eating it.  The cocktail sauce is a nice touch.

Made the recipe as written with the exception of chopping the cucumbers and layering them under the lettuce. It makes a ton which makes it a consideration for a large party (leftovers do not do well). It is also messy to scoop. Considering the time it takes to chop everything and the cost of the ingredients, I would not make this much fuss for the result.

I just served this last night at a party.  This is really good and everyone was saying  that there was something different about it they could not put their finger on. It is the cocktail sauce and it adds a ton of flavor and an extra kick!   Cucumbers for me are optional... they made the dip look pretty, but you could certainly leave them out if you do not have them on hand.  Also, a bit watery half way through the dip which made it look less appetizing.  I would definitely make this again because it is different than all the other nacho dips I have ever had.

This was a huge hit at a BBQ the other night. The guy who was hosting it doesnt' like veggies, so we left out the lettuce and the cucumbers. Just left in the peppers. Next time I make it i'll leave it all in. And add more spicy cocktail sauce.

This was just OK as far as I was concerned.  I thought it was very fresh tasting although I would not call it a dip. My family did not care for it and most of it was tossed as it does not hold up well in the fridge. I will not make again.

My husband and I loved it. I used thick salsa and cut all veggies on a paper towel to take out any moisture so my dip wasnt watery at all. I also used olives instead of the cucumbers. The lime chips suggestion made it even better. Would definetly make this again and again.

The dip was gone in 5 minutes, before I could taste any. It went over very well.  I omitted the letuce as we had to travel a fair distance and I was worried it might get wilty.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe Jeff.  I WILL make it again.  Hopefully I will get to taste it next time.

Personally, I loved the recipe.  The true test is the Bunco ladies.  They ate some, but no rave reviews and I did take some home.  I added black olives and skipped the cucumber slices.   Thanks, Jeff, for adding a new appetizer to my list!

This was very delicious. I didnt give it 5 stars because it wasn't that type of dip that I couldn't stop eating--but it IS very good.  I switched the layers around to try and prevent it getting watery. No problems--just use chunky salsa (not the watery type!).  YUMMY.

I enjoyed this dip, my children didn't so much, they prefer other dips that I make.  Just make sure you chill it at least 2 hours because it really needs that time for the flavors to mingle.

I've made this several times and it is a real hit every time.  Cocktail sauce gives it a great twist.  Excellent presentation, delicious and easy too!  A winner.

This was great! I try a lot of new recipes and my husband doesn't like very many of them. He did like this dip though. The cocktail sauce presents a sweet addition that goes very well with the other flavors. I will make again.

interesting - needed extra dash of something, a bit on the bland side.

This was excellent.  I added a layer of refried beans on the bottom, tomatoes & black olives & omitted the peppers.

I have made this dish at least a dozen times and each time it's devoured. It's important to dice the veggies very small to allow for easy dipping. If I am bringing it to an outdoor summer party I make it in 2 smaller dishes. This way when the first dish is finished I can pull the second dish out of the fridge, nice and cold and crisp. You can always chop the veggies the day before and store in ziplock bags to make for easy assembly on the day of the party.

didn't taste good to me and my guest haven't said anything.  I think the cocktail sauce was the problem.

It was amazing!!! Made it twice for two different get togethers and gobbled up both times. Made exactly as the recipe states. The cucumbers actually give the dip an extra light clean taste. Definitely a must at any function!

Very good dip.  Recipe says refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  I refrigerated for about 36 hour.  DON'T DO THAT!  Still tasted good but wasn't worthy of company with texture and appearance.

The only thing I did different was instead of mayonnaise I used miracle whip. It turned out great. Everyone loved it.
