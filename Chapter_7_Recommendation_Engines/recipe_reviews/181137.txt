I find that most Shepherds' pie although a wonderful dish is quite bland in flavor.   I choose to add onion while cooking the meat and I also add sour cream and garlic salt along with the other ingredients in the potatoes....The favors are outstanding and it is requested over and over as my all time comfort dish.

My husband requested Shepherd's Pie, which is not usually one of my favorites. I tried this recipe and we BOTH loved it!  I also added onions while cooking the ground beef and I used Idahoan Roasted Garlic Instant Mashed Potatoes, so I omitted the minced garlic … yummy.  Definitely a keeper for us!

The family loved this dish. Made some alterations, because i didn't have all ingredients. Instead of Cream cheese, i used a half can of Mushroom Soup (store brand), and a table spoon of sour cream. I used 3\4 cup of canned corn and canned carrots to mix with ground beef.  Instead of garlic clove, i substituded garlic powder. I also added dried french onion soup mix and pepper to season. My family ate it all. Wish i had made a bigger dish.

Love this recipe..I used the reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat cheddar cheese and it tasted great! I used a can of corn instead of mixed frozen vegetables (did not have any). Will definately make again.

I added black pepper, a little bit of salt.  My two sons and husband loved it. I thought it lacked a little flavor. I will make it again and  add onions to the ground beef and more black pepper.

For the mashed potatoes:  I made it with boiled  Idaho potatoes with skins on and added butter, sour cream with chives, and 2% milk. Then stirred in the cheddar cheese, little salt & pepper to taste. Mmmmmgood

We love lots of flavor so when I cooked the meat I added garlic and onion. I also made the beef gravy with 1 cup of beef broth, boiled then added about a tablespoon on corn starch to some warm water, whisked and add to broth. Now add one package of Lipton soup beef and onion. Once this thickens add it to the meat and vegetables. I also used Idaho instant garlic mash potatoes. Lots of warm flavor on a cold night. It was a hit!!

So easy. Instead of mixing the veggies with the meat, I layered the meat (mixed with the gravy), then the veggies, then the potatoes. That is the way I remember having it growing up. Love it. Tastes just like mom used to make

I didn't use as much cheese and added fresh cut corn off the cobb to the mixed veggies. This is a combination of take away and add our own seasonings due to likes n dislikes. Over all, it was a great dish and we all loved it.

Honestly this was my first time making shepherds pie. I did tweak it a little by adding in caramelized onion and a few other adjustments. Everyone really enjoyed it! I’ll make it again for sure.

It doesn't say for shortcut How Much instant mashed potatoes to make, so I had a ton left over.
But LOVE the mashed potatoes with cream cheese combo.

I didn't make any changes from the recipe, and it was very good!  However, the next time I make it, I'm going to saute some onions with the vegetables, and use fresh cooked carrots, with frozen peas and corn, leaving off the green beans.

We made this last night for dinner and; my husband and older teen liked it. My younger teen and I, thought it was bland, bland, bland. :(  So, tonight I tried to save this dish; rather than throw it out. I sauteed a conservative amount of: freshly minced garlic, and some freshly minced white onion; upon tasting --- still not enough flavor! Then I added a conservative amount (I didn't want to add too much, because I could always add more but; not take the seasoning away), of the following: garlic powder, onion powder, freshly cracked black pepper and, sea salt and; a couple of shots of Worcestershire sauce. It was better; but still not enough flavor! So, I added more of only: garlic powder, and onion powder and; now the dish had enough flavor! :) I'm sorry, I wouldn't make the original recipe again. I will try a different Shepards Pie recipe, if I make it in the future.

This was really good with some minor changes. Cooked the ground beef with onion and garlic.  Added Worcestershire sauce to the mix. Also doubled everything for a 9 x 13 pan.

Made this for our family last night and I thought it turned out great. I changed a couple things-I made my own mashed potatoes (really just because I don’t Ike the instant ones) and used canned corn, green beans and cut carrots for the vegetables instead of frozen. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The potatoes were so good and creamy with the cream cheese and the cheese and made the whole meal! Yummy! Will definitely make again!

Haven't eaten yet, but wanted to tell you my additions to this already-simple recipe:
I added some chopped onions, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, garlic salt, pepper, no-salt garlic seasoning, paprika, and a SMALL dash of nutmeg to the ground elk.

Let me know if you try it my way.

This was so easy and quick to make after getting home from work. I used the idea to mix bbq sauce with onion powder in the ground beef instead of gravy. I used Idahoan instant sour cream and chive potatoes on top. This was delicious and is definitely a keeper.

Great simple and fast.  Didn't have cream cheese or cheddar but I had a block of Velveeta so I tossed chunked up Velveeta into the instant mashed potatoes and it was divine!

So easy to make and delicious!  I followed some suggestions in other reviews and browned the onion with the beef.  I also added a little bit of garlic to the beef.  Family loved it - will make again.

The only thing I cut back on was the amount of veggies. I used frozen vegetables but only 3 cups & felt it was plenty. I also squeezed the vegetables in paper towels to pull out some of the water. My last attempt at Shepherds Pie with a different recipe came out watery. This came out delicious!!!!  Will definitely make again!!

This was great. I read other reviews who said it was bland. So I added salt and pepper to the ground beef and Lipton onion soup packet. I used the bob Evans already made mash potatoes. This will definitely become a part of my meals.

This was great! I was looking for some easy to make comfort food & this recipe hit the spot. I did however make a few changes. First I doubled the recipe, not sure I needed to it was quite filling and we had a lot of left overs (but they were devoured as well). Sautéed 1/2 and onion and garlic with ground beef and added a packet of Lipton beefy onion soup mix to the ground beef. We used Betty Crocker Garlic mashed instant potatoes and otherwise followed the recipe as is. My husband & kids loved it and requested it be added to the rotation of recipes. Thanks for the great recipe!

This turned out well for me!! I used fresh vegetables instead of canned, and it was okay. I just should have boiled the carrots first to get them tender. This was good and tasty though! Thanks for posting!

I made this recipe for St. Patty's Day. It was easy with a few tweeks ;) Instead of whole potatoes, I used boxed garlic mashed potatoes.  I also added onion and garlic salt and sour cream to the meat to season it a little, as suggested by another user. The only thing I would change, is the type of veggies I placed on the bottom. I bought a frozen bag of corn, green beans and carrots (my husbands not a fan of green beans.) But, I can't eat broccoli or cauliflower, so my choices of mixed veggies were limited. Next time, I am going to buy a bag of corn and a can of mushrooms to put on the bottom. I think the flavors will be awesome with this recipe. My husband still ate it, picking out the green beans of course. It did taste very good reheated the next day as well!

This is a great recipe!  I used more beef and potatoes so I used a 9×13.  I also added  sour cream to the potatoes while mixing them.

I followed the recipe with no changes to ingredients but next time will add some salt as I thought it could use some to my taste, otherwise I thought it was very good and will make again.

Another family favorite; this recipe never lasts longer than 1 1/2 days in my household.

This is a great recipe, and quick if you've got left over mashed potatoes. I substituted ground turkey, and made the gravy with chicken bouillon. If you cook the meat (add onion) in a cast iron skillet, the whole pie can go right in the oven. One pan love. Served here with multi-color chard.

Only thing that was good was the potatoes. Once those were gone the rest got thrown out.

Very tasty and easy to make.  We came up short on the frozen mixed veggies but added frozen broccoli to make up the volume and it came out just fine.  Also short on the cream cheese and substituted sour cream...no problem.  Added some minced garlic to give it a little extra flavor, too.

I've made this a few times now.  It's easy and fast.  The third time I made it I realized I didn't have any brown gravy so substituted Kraft Honey Barbecue Sauce instead.  It was fantastic.
