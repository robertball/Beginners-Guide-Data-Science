The base for the biscotti has wonderful flavor.  I added some chopped dried cherries, chopped toasted almonds and drizzled dark chocolate over them.  Everyone loved them.  I prefer crunchy biscotti so I needed to add additional baking time.

Love this recipe! So many variations can be made and easy to cut. I opted for my sharp Chef's knife.

Loved these. Great flavour and perfect texture. I did make one change due to dietary restrictions...I used Earth BalanceÂ® instead of butter. My add in's were filberts and cashews. I'll be making these again.
