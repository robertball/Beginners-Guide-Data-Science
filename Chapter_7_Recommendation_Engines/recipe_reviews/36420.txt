Creamy cinnamon pie is delicious, I didn't make this one but do make a similar version of this but MUCH easier. cinnamon chips (or white chocolate chips with cinnamon) 1/3C milk, 4oz cream cheese, 2C cool whip, graham crust. Melt chips & 2T milk, add cream cheese and remaining milk, beat with wire whisk til blended, refrigerate to cool a bit, then mix with cool whip. Poor into crust and freeze for  4 hours, set out to room temperature to serve. DELICIOUS and SO EASY! I think I'll post this actually!

The gelatin makes the pie too rubbery.  Maybe half the amount of gelatin would be better.

We have made this recipes several times and it just tastes like fall to us now!  The first time, we sped up the cooling of the gelatin too much and ended up with a rubbery consistency, but no problems since.  Simply delicious...even the kids agree!

Initially sounded like a strange recipe, but it was wonderful and very well recieved.  I couldnt find cinnamon chips so I used white chocolate and melted it with cinnamon.

I agree with other users that the gelatine gives this recipe a somewhat rubbery mouth feel. I also think that 1 cup of cinnamon chips is a little overpowering (and I love cinnamon).  I probably won't be making this one again.

Ok folks this recipe threw me for a loop.  I was just seconds from throwing it down the disposal.  Plus I thought it was nuts!  The geletin, when placed in ice water turned into a rubber disk.  Stupid me tried to cut it into pieces and mix it into the batter.  I had a total mess.  I was about to throw it away when my husband said don't throw it away, I want some of that batter.  So i thought what would happen if i heated the whole batch of batter?  Would the geletin globs melt?  Well, they did!  I had used peanut butter and milk chocolate chips (out of cinn) on top I put chopped peanut butter, white choc, milk choc, and crushed pecans.  Let me tell you this pie was WONDERFUL.  The whole point of the geletin is to cut the over rich cream cheesyness.  I will try is with lime and several other cream cheese pies.

Wonderful recipe!  I had bought some cinnamon chips and was deciding how to use them.  This was definitely the right way!

I made this for a family dinner.  We all thought it was just ok.  My brother did mention it felt rubbery to him.  I didn't notice that but I still wasn't crazy over the flavor either.
