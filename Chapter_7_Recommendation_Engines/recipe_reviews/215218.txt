I have never posted a recipe review before, but I had to take the plunge for this one!  The taste of the sauce can only be described as divine!  I had my doubts as I was adding in the cinnamon and peaches, but this was oh, so yummy!  Even my 80 yr old dad who is pretty much a meat-and-potatoes guy asked for seconds and complimented the meal.  I used 5 leg quarters--the meat fell off the bone, so I fished out the bones (or at least most of them) before serving and just added the cornstarch/water mixture without removing the chicken.  I also omitted the apricots--only because I did not have any on hand.  I used frozen peaches--worked just fine, and I likely used more garlic than called for.  This one will definitely be repeated often in our household.  BTW, I put the chicken--frozen--in the crockpot the night before, left it in the fridge, and mixed up all the other ingredients so all I had to do before going to work was dump it in.  Cooked all day on low.  Served with brown rice.

I thoroughly enjoyed the ease and simplicity of this dish. I had 4 large bone in breasts that needed to be used rather than the boneless and this actually worked out better because the amount of cooking time would have turned the boneless into shoe leather in my crockpot. This cooked for 7 hours on low, and was on the warm feature for about 1 1/2 hours, til I got home from work. I didn't have the apricots on hand so I did sub in carrots this time around. That was nice and next time I may add them along with the apricots. I did use everything else and it cooked down to a very nice sauce. Not to sweet, and lots of interesting spices to give it lots of depth. Topped it with cilantro and sliced almonds. Served with couscous and pita and it turned out to be a wonderful comfort style meal without the hassle of standing over the stove. Not really sure what some of the other reviewers meant by "blandness". It was far from bland. Thanks Juliebo. I will make again for sure.

Not bad. Easy to make and decent flavour. Maybe a little lemon grass to add some zing or a bit of red chili for some bite. Will make again.

This is great! My husband has been bugging me every week to make it again! I added a tablespoon of hot asian chili to give it more kick. Also I recommend tossing the chicken on the stove before putting it in, just to avoid that boiled chicken taste.

One of my friends described this as "restaurant delicious!" I did alter the recipe a bit, just due to what I had on hand: Instead of chicken, I substituted 2 turkey drumsticks and 2 turkey thighs. (about 2 lbs of meat). (This may solve the problem of bland meat). I also used a large can of garbanzo beans. I couldn't find peaches in season at the grocery, so I used a 28 oz can of sliced peaches and drained off the juice. I added heaping portions of all the spices since I was putting in extra meat, etc. So this ended up not fitting in my small slow cooker- I cooked it on the stove in a large cast dutch oven. Simmered it a couple hours on the stove, then pulled the meat from the bone and added the cornstarch + water. Yum yum yum! So amazing over couscous!

I was expecting something with a more exotic flavor and despite all the seasonings and the sweetness of the peaches and tartness of the apricot - all I tasted was tomato.  I felt it was rather ordinary.

I thought this was pretty good to begin with, although it seemed like it was missing "something." I've been eating it as leftovers with a dish of plain yogurt on the side. From the second day on, the flavors had a chance to blend.

I followed the directions and did not change things up.  I didn't even serve it.  The flavors were weird and unappetizing.  This is the most disappointing thing I've ever made.  =-(

Absolutely awesome! Going to be one of our family favorites. My family is Thai so I love very flavorful food and this definitely qualifies. Great mix of spices, light sweetness, and a slight bit of heat. I even improvised a bit since I forgot the garbanzo beans and 1/2 the diced tomatoes. Very heathly served over whole wheat couscous! The only suggestion I would have is to reducing cooking time by one hour - chicken was fully cooked by this time and still moist.

I thought it was very good. I added an extra tsp each of corriander and cumin (might add more next time). I also added 1/2 Tbsp each of  red chili paste and lemon pesto (more red chili paste next time). Lastly I added an extra 2 tsp of garlic powder.  I used chicken breast cooked whole then shredded at the end. It was pretty good but a little dry. It would have been better with chicken thighs.

Great recipe, but I can't buy the canned tomattoes. Learn to peal tomatoes, it isn't that hard.  Also, you have to brown the chicken, garlic and onions.  Prep time is way off. It takes like an hour to get everything ready to cook (incuding browning the chicken and vegetables).  Also, this recipe makes a lot, so adjust, or invite friends.

This was pretty good.  A little sweet for me, I may have left out the apricots had I known.  However, I offset it with some spicy chili rooster sauce and put a little crushed red pepper in with the sauce.

OMG, this was fantastic.  I did double the the spices as we like a little more flavor on most dishes.  And I used fresh peaches with fresh apricots as I didn't want to put over $3 worth of dried apricots and the fresh are so delicious this time of the yearjavascript:__doPostBack('ctl00$ContentPlaceholder$edit$saveButton','').  Oh, and I used chicken breasts on the bone with skin, and the chicken literally just fell off the bones which was one of those times I wished I had cooked it within cheese cloth because picking out the bones was a real pain, but worth it0 I also had a bundle of fresh mushrooms that I halved and tossed in and was glad.  I do wish I had put some carrots in as it would have been super, so that is on the to do list for next time.  We served it on white rice and loved it.

I have no idea where people are coming from when they say this is not flavorful, because it is AMAZING.  My only changes were that I added 1/2 can of frozen OJ concentrate instead of peaches and 1 T red pepper flakes.  I used chicken thighs.  It was a fall off the bone flavor party in my mouth.

I cooked this for friends and it went down extremely well - clean plates all round. I didn't cut the chicken into pieces though - kept the boneless breasts whole and the meat was lovely and tender. As for the spices, I thought they worked well and there was loads of flavour. This one's a keeper.

This recipe sounds excellent and I intend to make it  and confirm for myself.  However, I wish to make a couple of comments based on my professional culinary experience.  First, the photograph shows the chicken served on top of either couscous or bulgar wheat pilaf.  In  Morrocan cuisine, the chicken is cooked in a  Tangine together with or on top of the couscous.  I think if you are going to show the side dish for this Moroccan chicken, the editors should insist on including the recipe or hyperlink it.  I consider that the photograph on the side of being deceptive because couscous is part of the traditional dish.  

Secondly, I would recommend cooking this dish with chicken thighs with or without the drumsticks for several good reasons. Breast meat if skinless and boneless is the blandest and easily driest part of a chicken when overcooked.    

Thigh meat has more natural fat in it, and remember that chicken fat is not an unhealthy fat compared to red meats,  and it will keep the meat moist over a longer cooking process.   Alternatively,  you might be able to cook this dish and take a temperature reading of the meat periodically to ensure it reaches 160-165 degrees Fahrenheit.  It may not require five hours cooking time.  Then it is a matter of reducing the sauce in a saucepan.   I will post again after I try this dish following the recipe and provide some other suggestions that may make it more flavorful than this particular recipe.

WOW!!  This had several layers of flavor and spice, not to mention how easy it is to throw together!  I had some pre-cooked BSCB that I chopped up with everything else; did not have any apricots on hand so omitted that.  Next time will get some cuz we thought it would really add more flavor to the mix.  Served it over rice and it was a big hit for both DH and myself.  Highly recommend trying this one-it will be a regular for sure!

I followed the recipe to the T and found it to be very bland and has a very heavy coriander taste.  It makes a lot so be prepared to eat on it for a while.

First off, I'm sorry I accidentally posted my picture three times! I'm new to the mediterrean diet & not a skilled chef! But this was so easy & tastes delicious! I didn't have dried apricots & think it would have added more flavor. But my family loved it!

I followed the directions exactly, almost. I didn't have peaches so I used mango. I also cooked it in the oven instead of a crockpot. Tastes great but it could be a bit more spicy. Next time I'll add some hot pepper flakes.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe.  It had so so so many different flavors.  What a treat this was.  Used 4 large fresh Roma Tomatoes instead of canned and didn't have the Coriander.  This is a definite keeper.  Served it over Couscous.

I thought this was ok.  I sped it up and slow cooked on high for 3 hours.  I added olives because I was craving them.  Next time I will slooow cook, and I may also either put the chicken on the stove for a moment (to get the outside a more flavorful coating rather than the boiled chicken it came out as).  I may also put the breasts in whole and shred them a bit at the end before serving.

I made this without the coriander and cornstarch. . I was a little disappointed with the flavors. Not sure if I did something wrng but it was just a little bland. I expected much more flavor!

Full of flavor. I wouldn't normally put all of these flavors together, but they mesh very well. Quick and easy. I served it over rice.

Great recipe!! Instead of rice as a side, I added to the cooker a diced sweet potato and I cup of diced yellow squash. I also added 1 sliced lemon to balance the sweetness of the dish.

Delicious! Made in a fast slo pro pot, like an instant pot. Added double the spices plus 3 tablespoons honey and 1 tsp fennel seed. I would triple the spices next time! Served over Carolina gold rice. The cilantro really adds a nice touch!

Used thighs and drumsticks along with breasts.  We like spicy, so doubled spices.  Added green olives at the end and it was a fantastic dish.  Served over cardamom rice.

What a surprise!  I happened to have most of the ingredients on hand except the chicken were boneless  thin breasts.  I think the spices are perfect as is.  If you happen to have all the ingredients, this is easy and quick to put together.  Bravo!

I made this a few days ago and at first it was just ok. I made this a little more Thai and now it’s amazing. Coconut milk some Thai red curry paste ( for lemongrass and spice) some lemon zest and Thai basil. I added these ingredients after dinner because it was boring, now it’s spit on. The base for a great meal is there but it’s missing a few thing to pull all of the competing flavors together.

This was quite tasty and a great way to use some of the fresh local peaches I had. I used bone in chicken legs which I covered in the spice mix with some olive oil to marinade for a bit before browning in a pan, I then added the other ingredients and cooked on medium low for an hour.

This dish came out great. I only had a 14 oz can of tomatoes, so I chopped up 3 more tomatoes and added that in. I also added in an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 of carddemon.  Otherwise no changes. I served this over mashed sweet potatoes, which was yummy.  
Next time I may try to make this with chicken legs and thighs or cut the chicken breasts into bigger chunks since the chicken was a little dry.
Thanks for the recipe!

I used my Dutch oven as it was a Sunday afternoon and I was going to be home all day. I browned the chicken - deboned thighs because I find them so much more flavourful - before adding the onions, garlic, and a couple of chunked up carrots. I followed the rest of recipe from there with a cooking time of around 45 to 60 minutes on simmer. Oh, and there are no fresh peaches in winter in my part of Canada so I put in frozen peach slices (not thawed).

This recipe was super easy and delicious! I followed the recipe except  I used frozen peaches instead of fresh (since they're not in season currently) and I didn't add the cilantro or almonds on top. I also cut the stewing time a bit short (cooked it some on high to make up for it) due to time constraints. This recipe makes a lot of food! I've been eating it all week and I still have at least another week's worth.

My first review of making a dish. I did not care too much for  this dish. Maybe it is because the peaches were not in season, or maybe it is just because it is something that I am not used to eating. The first bowl was fairly good (ok at best), I had to choke down a second helping. My sister also said it was “OK“.  I don’t think I could eat it again so I won’t be saving any of the leftovers which is unfortunate.  I hate wasting food. I won’t be making this again, but might enjoy maybe a stove top version of this instead of the crockpot version.

I made some changes:
Added  3 tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp unsalted butter,1 chopped shallots, 1 tbsp hot sauce, 2 tbsp white wine, pinch of sea salt, 1 tbsp fig honey  jam, and 1 container of Japanese noodles (last 2 mins.). Removed corn starch and water.
My house smells so good.

As others said, they found this dish to be a bit bland so I doubled the spices. In taste testing the dish before serving I still found the sauce to be bland so I added some honey to give it more flavor.  I think the variation in reviews is due to the variation in the sweetness... or lack thereof.... of the peaches.  Although I bought my peaches in season, they were not super sweet.  Hence the need to add some honey which I use in other Moroccan dishes anyway.

This was delicious and easy to make. Giving it a 4 star review bc my half Pakistani half Mexican husband felt like he needed to add extra cayenne pepper after it was served. Next time I might add a little extra spice to add extra flavor. But over all it was a great balance of savory flavors. Served it with jasmine rice and warm garlic nan.

I made no changes to the recipe.  I like the flavors, but the cooking time is too long.  The chicken was dried out.  Probably would work better with thighs.  Not likely to make again.

I made this for a summer birthday party, did not put any kind of rice or anything like that with it, just a tossed salad with feta cheese, cranberries and nuts, had french style bread available for those who wanted it. It was a big hit! The fruit made it very summery and you didn't have to eat it piping hot which was pleasant with the weather. I used 2 lbs of chicken breast, my coriander was not ground, and I threw in some extra garlic cause my was kind of old. I did it on high for 5 hours and the meat just shredded apart I did not cut it up prior. I loved the fruit in it so I might add some extra next time. Actually the cranberries from the salad got mixed in and that tasted good too! In the winter I would probably put it over a starch but you have the chick peas already.  Definitely recommend.

I followed this recipe verbatim.  I don’t know how you could put this many ingredients in a pot and have so little flavor.  I’m hoping this is one of those that tastes better on the second day.  Husband and child won’t be impressed, I anticipate.

Wonderful! Family enjoyed this receipe.  Next time I'll add a little more heat as my family prefers spicy meals and use chicken thighs instead of breasts. Great recipe!

I made it as written.  I had misgivings as I added the tomatoes, knowing from experience that onions should be cooked before tomato is introduced.  I was right - and we don't like uncooked onions.  The spice components were meh (and I cook with them all the time).  The liquid didn't set up as I would have liked.
I might make this again as a stew (cooking those onions/garlic before!), and finding some savory counter-balance to the sweetness of the fruits.

Turned out great, but the next time I make it I'll use a little bit more chicken and cut it into more bite-size pieces.

So-so but the flavors improved somewhat as day 2’s lunch.  I can’t decide if the leftovers are worth freezing (it definitely serves more than 6, especially if like us you are underwhelmed). Based on other reviews, I increased the spices by about half but should probably have doubled them. On day two, I added some hot sauce, which improved it.  Green olives as another garnish also helped.  I do agree with other reviewers that the meat was too dry and thighs would be better.  Not as special as I hoped based on the interesting ingredients (and rather a waste of a cup of dried apricots).

My very picky husband liked it. I enjoyed the spices and tender chicken. I did deviate from the recipe. My slow cooker broke, just as I was getting ready to pur the chicken in. So I cut up the breats into 1” cubes (approx) and lightly cooked them in avacado oil and butter, then added all of the ingredients for the sauce. I did double most of the spices and almond slivers. I served it over Basmati rice. Very tasty and filling.

This was different and very good. Did not use the cayenne pepper because we don’t like hot. The flavors were delicious. I thought I might adjust the spices next time because it tasted a little too sweet and then we had the leftovers!  Better the next day!  This is a keeper.

This was excellent. I cut the recipe in half except for the spices. It wasn't too spicy and there was lots of sauce left over. I used the slow cooker function on the instant pot and then the saute function to thicken the sauce without removing the chicken.  I served it with vegetable quinoa but next time I will use rice. This would be a great company meal.

My husband and I really liked it. I cooked mine on high for half the time and diced the chicken. I added a bit more spice and next time I will add even more. I don't eat onion or garlic so I omitted both. Next time I will make it vegetarian, with potatoes  and or paneer. Over all this is a wonderful dish and I will make it again. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Peaches out of season made it lack that sweet cut I was expecting. I am going to do this again in the late summer with fresh Niagara Peaches.  But the family was absolutely gob smacked with it. Definitely a success.

Delicious!!!!  This recipe makes enough for a large family, of lots of leftovers for two!  The prep time is much more than listed, as for me it took almost an hour to chop, peel, slice, measure and prepare.  But we’ll worth it!

Used bone in chicken breasts...found this to be tasty, but must say that it tastes more like a chicken chili and probably could be made with more beans instead of serving it over rice.

No changes except added fire roasted tomatoes rather than regular and used vegetable broth instead of chicken as that was all I had on hand!!  It was flavorful and the toasted almonds topped it off!  All the flavors in this one!

Really liked this! Makes a lot. I doubled the recipe. Had to sub the peaches out for a can of mandarin oranges& a can of lychees-what I had on hand. I was heavy-handed on spices per the reviews. Savory sweet. Mild heat. Yes, tomatoey , but the other flavors come thru making it very interesting & delicious!

Good recipe.   I like it as written.  I am not sure why some people would put curry or peanut butter in a Moroccan dish then give it  a low star rating.

Leave out the peaches.  Their blandness diminishes the dish.  Boost the cumin and hot pepper.  Moroccan food is flavorful, not bland.

Made it without the Tomatoes! Allergic! Used some roasted red peppers. And added some mushroom/veggie stock to make up the liquid. Yummy! Also served with multicolored quinoa. Be sure to rinse it well. (Quinoa) 1st b4 cooking to take away the bitterness!

This was really good. I wanted to find something  different to do with all peaches from my CSA and this was a great find. I love throwing things in a crock pot and having a great dinner come out a few hours later. I made it as is and served it with rice.  I also kicked up the spice with some red chile as I like it spicy. Overall a really good recipe that I will be making again.
