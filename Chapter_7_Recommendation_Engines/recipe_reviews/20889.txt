This is an excellent recipie. Even my son who does'nt like zuchinni said so. I did increase the salt in it. Also I used one zuchinni and one yellow squash. Easy, fast and delicious. Thanks.

I was not impressed with this at all.  The *batter* never really formed on my zucchini.  And it ended up coming out very bland tasting. I will stick to my traditional way of doing fried zucchini -- slice the zucchini, dip in flour, dip in eggwash, dip in flour again, salt and pepper and fry.

Great, Great recipe! The best fried zucchini recipe I have ever tried! Very easy to make, too! I couldn't make mine the night of, so I ended up sticking it in the fridge until the next night. The veggies were pretty soggy looking, but I fried them anyway (since I went through all the work!) and they were delicious! Even the fried onion rings which didn't take the batter as well as the zucchini were yummy! I did double the breading recipe since I had more zucchini than the recipe called for and used half cornmeal, half italian seasoned bread crumbs with the normal, proportional amount of flour. Also added 1/8 to 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese, probably 1/2 to 1 tsp of italian seasoning and increased the garlic powder to 1/2 tsp or more. (I am not an exact measurer, so bare with me here...) I premixed the dry ingredients and put everything in a gallon ziploc bag. So easy! The mess is minimal compared to traditional methods of frying zucchini, so that was a pleasant change! The fried result was crunchy and very flavorful. My husband and 18 month old loved it too!

I use italian bread crumbs instead of cornmeal. I added a little salt and adobo to the egg and dip the pieces in the egg, then to bread crumbs. After the oil gets very hot put the pieces in the pan and fry both sides. Remove onto a plate covered with paper towels to absorb the grease and sprinkle with salt while it is still hot. Let cool and enjoy.

My family has grown to really like this recipe. Remember to let the mixture sit for 30 minutes so the batter forms on the vegetables, as Jon suggests. We did increase the garlic powder and the salt.

This was a great starting off point for a second time fried zucchini attempt.  Will fine tune it next time to suit our tastes.  I will leave out the onions because they didn't take the batter well and will leave the zucchini in slices instead of quarters to be able to flip them in the pan better.  I like this recipe because there is not much mess when it comes to getting the batter on the zucchini.

I made a couple of changes. First I used whole wheat flour instead of white and second, I baked these ( just cannot bring myself to fry). They came out tasty but I do think needed some more seaoning. Next time I think I'll add some spicy seasoning to the mixture.

I used 1 yellow squash and cut it very thin...like 1/4".. 1/8"..slices....I didn't have any cornmeal, so i used breadcrumbs in it's place...I also added 1/4 tsp of Onion Powder. I let it soak in that mixture 45 minutes.. The squash looked wet as i put them into fry pan...And i did NOT fry in oil..I put 1/2 a stick of Butter in pan to fry...as it fried and absorbed into squash i added more butter to fry in. Almost like squash chips....Very good !

I followed this recipe exactly as written.  Even waiting 45 minutes the mixture never really stuck to the zucchini.  As soon as the zucchini hit the hot grease it simply slugged off.  That being said, the light covering of batter that did remain fried up nicely and the zucchini turned out crisp and tasty.  My husband gave this recipe two thumbs up.  I think next time I will try an egg wash and a second coating of batter before frying.  I might also add a little more garlic and some seasone salt to fit our tastes a little better.  Overall though, this recipe delivered.

hmm... seemed to be missing something.  I ended up with a few burned pieces before making some modifications:
Dip moistened zucchini in flour/cornmeal, then in an egg wash, then in breadcrumbs.  Pan fry for about 1-2 minutes each side.  Delish with ranch dressing...

First time I have fried Zucchini and the recipe was a hit.  I read the reviews and followed the suggestions, making sure I left the zucchini sitting in the batter for 30 or more minutes and that the zucchini was well covered.  Great Recipe.

I made this with an extra large garden zucchini and it was wonderful. We made it at the same time as another fried zucchini recipe and this won hands down. I followed the instructions exactly and there was a nice coating on the zucchini.The flavor with the onion (I used a sweet onion) was great. I didn't add any extra water or egg, but I let it sit for 30 minutes as instructed. All my kids loved it. I broke up the onion slices, but it may have been better to leave the onion slice together since the whole slice could have been flipped like the zucchini.

I made this exactly as it and it didn't turn out as I expected. Batter did not form on the zucchini for me either. I'm thinking perhaps if I soak in egg first (similar to the fried okra recipe in allrecipes that is excellent) it might be better. I'm going to worth with this and not give up!

Had tons of zucchini and no onions so had to go without which is a shame, as we love onion rings.  Sadly, the batter did not form.  Therefore, I did as another reviewer suggested and after the 30 minutes, dipped them in milk and again in the flour mixture.  After another 30 minutes the batter still did not really form.  Luckily I got sidetracked and was not able to get back to cooking the rest of the batch for another hour--ah ha, batter!  This is hard to rate as I’m not sure if it was my not using onions which may have added the needed moisture.  They tasted ok but sure could use twice the spices plus a little something with punch like chile powder.  Did like the shake-and-bake-like ease.  May try again with longer resting time and a few changes--oh, oh Parmesan…

Letting sit in the batter for 30 minutes makes all the difference.  Tasty!  Thanks for sharing.  :) PS - I use olive oil with a pat of butter in it.

It was very good and crispy, however I did let it sit overnight and also replaced half of the cornmeal for bread crumbs.  My zucchini did not seem to make the batter after only 30 minutes, but when i waited over night it was perfect.  Good way to eliminate those extra egg calories.

I did not care for this recipe.  No batter ever set up.  All you could taste was the flour corn meal mixture - grainy.  I would not make this again.

Wow! Wish I happened upon this years ago to save from the mess of breading zucchini. I'm going to try this mixture with other veggies, too! I followed the recipe pretty exaclty, except I used 1/4 cup hole-Wheat Breadcrumbs and 1/4 cup cornmeal instead of only the cornmeal. Delish!

Awesome!  I found I liked the zucchini a little better when I sliced it thinner-- stayed crunchy longer.  I also used this recipe for GREEN TOMATOES this evening, and they were quite delicious as well-- altho' probably better without the garlic powder.  Still quite tasty!

This also good for fresh okra and yellow squash. Sometimes I mix yellow squash in with the zuchinni and onions.  This is the only way my mom ever fixed these veggies when I was growing. True southern fare!

Thanks Jon
This was delicious as is.
I love not having to dip the pieces into batter with all the mess and work.
This was so easy, we all loved it and it was the best fried zuchinni we ever had!

Although it didn't really look like the picture this was a nice fried zucchini recipe. It wasn't what I was expecting - there isn't really a "batter" that happens. However, once I played around with it a little it worked pretty well. The zucchini inside is nice and moist and the outside just crispy enough without feeling really greasy. A couple of tips - definitely let it sit for at LEAST half an hour. I tossed and mixed it around with my fingers a few times during that too. Then as you're taking the zucchini pieces out, dredge them in the loose powder at the bottom. The moistness of the zucchini will cling to the powder and you'll get better coating that way. I ran out of time and couldn't make them all so I stuck it in the fridge. It was there for two days and then I made the rest and they came out just as well, if not better!

This needs an egg wash to adhere the crumb mixture to the zucchini.  I sit up three dishes side-by-side.  Cornstarch-egg wash-crumb mixture.  I use Italian bread crumbs and crushed saltines instead of cornmeal.  Rather than use flour to dip the zucchini in prior to breading, use corn starch and shake off the excess prior to dipping in the egg wash.  The egg will stick to the cornstarch and there is no aftertaste when cooked.  These are also delicious with a ranch dressing.  If you want to avoid the cooking odor from the frying in your house, use a cast iron skillet on the side burner of the BBQ outside.  Prepare all of the zucchini and move the cooking outside.  Takes just a few min and you are done since the side burners are usually larger than the stove burners.

This is the best.  Tried other recipes.  Tried just flour or just cornmeal dip in egg first but this is the one.  Just a hint of garlic.  Definitely let sit a bit before frying.  Yummy!

I did this two ways: directly following the instructions and then by taking the zucchini putting it in the flour mix, then dip into a beaten egg, and back into the flour mix before putting it in the pan. Both were a great success! My boyfriend seemed to enjoy the simple version better but I enjoyed the 'egg' version myself. All in all great recipe! *pic is of the 'egg' version*

I am astounded at how simple this method is, and how wonderfully the end result was!  I can honestly only rate the method, because I used 1 cup of Zatarain's frying mix instead of the dry ingredients.  The zucchini and onions came out crispy and stayed crispy.  For those who ended up with soggy results, here are a couple of tips.  Keep shaking that bowl of zucchini while the 30 minutes passes.  I also shook it between batches, and I waited longer than 30 minutes.  Second, make sure your oil temperature stays right around 350.  I will use this method from now on!  Thanks for the recipe, Jon!

There was to much cornmeal for me.  Other than that it's a great recipe.

I would make a few changes if I make these again.  first, I would slice the zucchini's a little thicker, maybe a 1/4" or so.  Second, I would not brown them as much as I did. The corn meal in the batter made them too crispy, like chips.  Overall, a good recipe

I cooked this according to the recipe with a "clone" zucchini, and it turned out good, not great, but good, overall.  I tried it with a BIG zucchini and it was horrible.  I tried it with a zuke that had been around a few days, bad.  So much depends on the zucchini you have (size, ripeness, dry or wet), and cutting it to suit (some thick, some thin) that to get it "perfect is like a multi-variable equation.  It's a real hit or miss, but done right, it's good. Stick to the megamart clone zukes for this one.

Did not like the cornmeal, will probably use italian breadcrumbs next time.  But flavor was pretty good, and very easy to make.  Much easier than making a liquid batter and dipping each one.  My kids liked them, but the cornmeal turns rock solid hard if you overcook them at all.  All in all, not a bad recipe, but will definitely tweek it to my taste next time.

Yummy!  Substituted Italian bread crums instead of cornmeal and dipped in egg before breading.

I have been frying zucchini for years, and I have to say this is the best recipe I have ever tried!  My whole family loved it.  I added garlic salt and seasoned salt for added flavor and I simply tossed everything into a Ziplock bag for 30 minutes.  The zucchini had a nice crisp coating and did not soak up a lot of oil unlike a lot of fried zucchini recipes.  I can't wait to make more tomorrow night!

Turn up the heat to medium-high if not high. They seemed to be too mushy on the early pieces and after I turned up the heat they were tender-crisp.

These were pretty good.  If you are looking for a more breaded fried zucchini then definately take others advice and double bread or dip in milk or egg before adding dry ingredients.  I fried mine in a deep fryer and had no issues making them as directed in the recipe but I do understand why others suggest making them more on the breaded side.  Both ways suit my tastebuds so I think its more a preference thing than anything else!

This was very bland. The breading did not stick for me either (and I know what I'm doing). 

Since it didn't work out, I added garlic, Parmesan, and a few Italian spices to the dry mix. I dipped the semi breaded zucchini in a milk/egg mix and then back into the improved dry mix. Much better, but the cornmeal was just not very exciting to me.

There was no batter ever formed. The powdered mixture remained a dry powdered mixture. I don't understand what could have possibly turned the dry powder to a batter to begin with.

I needed to add water to the batter - after 45 minutes it wasn't batter yet, still just dry. I needed to sort out the veggies - the onions cooked lots faster than the squash did. I also found I needed to salt it after it was fried and drained. I fried it at 365 degrees.

Super tasty! I have never used cornstarch in the flour, It is amazing how well everything stays together in the oil.  My zucchinis were a little dry so I dipped them in egg before the cornstarch mixture so a batter formed and I added a little extra salt and pepper once cooled .

I'm sorry I really didn't like this recipe. The batter didn't stick well and I don't think it had very much flavor. Kinda just tasted like greasy zucchini. I ended up rinsing the batter off of the zucchini I hadn't fried yet and steaming it like I normally do. The recipe might have potential if you play around with the ingredients, but my roommate and I were definitely not fans as is.

I've never really had zucchini, nor was i anxious to try it. This recipe was surprising good. I deep fried them, instead of in the pan. So I made them super crunchy! Hope my mom gets home in time, there might not be any left!!!!

4 1/2 stars from me! I didn't have the cornmeal so I used bread crumbs instead. Sliced the zucchini and, just for the fun of it, some mushroom. OMG! The mushrooms were delish, better than the zucchini!

Much easier and traditional way of frying zucchini.  Not for anyone watching calories.  I sliced the onion quite thin and will make larger rings next time because it browned faster than the zucchini. I will try butter next time instead of oil and will cut down on the cornmeal and add a little more flour.

I think this is one of those recipes where you need the proper cooking gear to make it turn out right. It was OK, but I bet it would have been better had it been cooked in a deep-fryer. I fried it on the stove and had the same problem as others, the batter not sticking as well. I just don't think the oil was hot enough.

These were delicious! I followed advice from other reviewers by using an egg wash, and then dipping into dry mixture. I had no problems with the coating falling off. Thanx for sharing. I'll definetely make this again!

This was excellent. I had no problems with the batter forming, as some other reviewers seemed to. The cornmeal added an unexpected crispiness and flavor that my family loved. Finally a use for all that zucchini!

My husband gave 3-1/2 stars but I found these lovely. Was out of cornmeal so I added cream of wheat instead. Followed rest of the recipe exactly and it was great. Thanks!

If you like really crispy fried zucchini, try adding a little water or milk or beer to the mix. 
Then, when you dip the slices, you get a nice thick coating. Yum!

If you love fried green tomatoes, you will enjoy these little gems.  I try all the recipes  on this site exactly as written the first time.  However, I don't like corn meal, so I replaced it with a little more flour and bread crumbs.  Delicious!

Loved this! Just a light coating. Came out crispy and delicious. Wish I would've used two onions.  Used two small zucchini and a yellow squash, too.  Kind of cored the yellow one and had 'squash rings'.  Sprinkled some Seasonall on after I took them out.

This was so much easier ( and less messy) than dipping in egg first. It turned out just right. This is how I'll fry zucchini from now on.

Pretty good.  This was my first time using this recipe so I followed the recipe exactly.  I'll probably change it up next time.  The "batter" never actually formed, even after letting it sit for over an hour.  But I cooked it anyway and it turned out so-so.  This would probably be very good on okra.

These were REALLY good!  My whole family loved them-- including the "non veggie eater", so this recipe is definately a keeper for us!  I followed other reviewers advice and added a little more seasoning to suit our tastes.  I also had no problem with the batter sticking, so I didn't have to dip them in egg or milk-- EASY!

Instead of pan frying then I used my deep fryer. A little less healthy I'm sure but they taste awesome.

This was a wonderful recipe! If you follow the directions the result will be fantastic - very yummy, not greasy at all. The corn meal adds a nice flavor and my husband loved having "onion rings" with the zucchini!

I've never liked fried zucchini until this.  My husband has always made the basic flour/egg recipe and I wasn't too impressed.  This, however, was very tasty.  Only thing I changed was to sprinkle a little salt on all after done and I didn't do onions at all, although next time I think I will try it.

I was skeptical that this would form a batter without any liquid...but it did!!! It was good. Next time though I'm going to try crushed crackers in place of the cornmeal as my hubby and I aren't huge fans of cornmeal. Also needed to add way more garlic and salt that is called for! Good recipe!

After mixing your dry ingredients, toss these all together in a bag!  I was hesitant that a batter would form without a liquid ingredient, but it did!  Used my deep fryer set at 325 and they were done in about 4 minutes..hit them with salt and parmesean cheese after they are done, I served it with pasta and marinara!

It didn't form a batter for me. It could have been because I had them sliced from the night before, not sure. I also used rice flour to make it gluten free. Some I dipped into a egg wash and then coated again and they were ok.

I agree with another rating that this is a good start. I began with cornmeal, switched to seasoned bread crumbs with some grated parmesan cheese, with the flour. I doubled dipped and dredged towards the end of the batch,it really beefed them up. I used green zucchini and yellow crookneck.I will keep this as my base recipe with the changes, for my zucchini fry ups. Worked very well for onion rings too. Next time I will even try some bell pepper. Thanks.

This was a good start. I exchanged the cornmeal for garlic and herb bread crumbs because I didn't have cornmeal and I sauteed a pound of shrimp in the oil after the onions and zucchini were done.    There needs to be a way in which a lot more of the batter stays on the zucchini and onions.  Just letting the veggies sit for a half hour doesn't allow enough to glom on.  The zucchini and onions need to be dredged in egg or milk before making contact with the batter.    HOWEVER, both the lightly battered and heavily battered zucchini ended up tasting good:  The zucchini I made that didn't retain much batter tastes great once you add a little salt and pepper at the end (because it doesn't retain enough spices from the batter).   The zucchini I made that retained a lot more of the batter (I dredged them in water) tasted FANTASTIC.  Will definitely make this again with my adjustments. :)

I love fried zucchini especially the way my mom used to make it.  This was good, but we didn't care for the texture of the cornmeal.  I think I will go back to using crushed saltines and fry them in lots of butter!

I made batter just like it said.  I did not let it set at all.  I coated it in a egg/milk mixture, put it in batter and then put it in deep fryer.  It turned out very good, especially the onions.

Ended up great but i give it four stars because i made some of the changes that were recommended by other reviewers. I used half the cornmeal and doubled the flour. I left it in the mix for 30 min, dipped it in a egg and milk mix, and then another 10 min in the mix. As for the breading sticking, i noticed that if i only put in a small amount of the zuccini in the oil then they cooked golden brown very fast and the breading was perfect and stayed on; however, if i put more of the zuccini in the oil it took a lot longer to cook and the breading did not stick that well. Overall, they were very good, but that was because of the suggested changes. (Also, I only used zuccini because the onions somehow never made it into my house from the store.)

I was excited at first when I saw this recipe because I wanted onion rings and fried zucchini. The dry ingredients did not stick to the zucchini or onion, (let it sit for over 30 minutes) and came right off in the oil. The batter came out soggy and oily and separate from the zucchini/onion. Everything fell apart! Will use pancake batter next time.

After following others' suggestion to allow the vegies to set a bit longer (4 hours), I thought this recipe was quite good. I added some yellow squash as well. The end product is not big and puffy, but the onions are super crispy and the squash is tasty. I'm not big on deep frying foods, but this one's worth doing again.

Although my boyfriend liked it, I didn't quite enjoy the breading as much as I thought I would.  It didn't stick to the vegies very well even though I did exactly what the directions said to do.  Tasted alright but I'll be using a different breading next time.

This recipe didn't work at all for me. I ended up with some greasy zuchinni, minus the golden breading. When I used the remaining cornmeal/flour mixture on egg washed zuchinni, it worked much better, but I didn't care for the texture of the cornmeal. I would stick with the traditional flour, egg wash, flour method.

After taking the advice of other cooks, I added milk to give the batter some consistency. I also had to add quite a bit of salt to resuce the dish from the bland taste. (I used Seasoned Salt). A pretty tasty dish, we will try this recipe again.

This is a great recipe. I did add milk to help coat it just before deep frying and it worked great!! Thank you for the recipe Jon.

This recipe was excellent...although the batter did not stick entirely to the zuchinni, it fried up very nicely and gave it such a wonderful flavor.

Also, I did not have corn meal on hand, so I added a 1/2 c. of corn meal muffin mix.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  Had a problem with coating staying on the zucchini.  Will keep looking for a better one.

I thought this turned out pretty darn good. I used onion powder instead of onions. I seasoned the veggies directly and heavily seasoned the flour too. I used a mix of almond flour/ coconut flour and shredded Parmesan instead of regular flour ( Keto) I fried some of them in olive oil and some in lard. I think I preferred the olive oil. I followed the recipe and fried some as directed then I also did a flour/egg wash/ flour to some of them. I equally enjoyed both. The egg wash veggies made a larger fritter. I made some roumalade  sauce to dip. Very yummy.

This recipe is GENIUS! I have fried zucchini for years, trying all kinds of batters. This is by far the easiest and best. The zucchini are much crispier than any I've ever cooked. My husband liked them, too. I couldn't understand how this would work - with no liquid at all. But it did! I followed the recipe exactly, except for adding a little sugar and Cajun seasoning. I also did all the prep in a gallon baggie, so it ended with a toss in the trash can, instead of washing multiple dishes.  After 30 minutes exactly, I fried them. The medium heat didn't do it for me. The first batch took way too long to cook and weren't getting brown. So I raised it just a little, to 7/10. Loved the onion combination. I'm SOLD! Thank you!

Nice, it was a hit. Make sure you use freshly cut and juicy young zucchini so the water beading up on the cut surfaces causes the breading to adhere. If you don't have that, maybe do a milk or egg soak to get the breading to stay on. If zucchini is large (a common problem when gardeners let them go too long), then peel it and cut into even sized spears instead of discs.

I will definitely make this again. I didn't make any changes and was very surprised how well the batter stuck to the zucchini without using an egg as I have always done in the past. I will try making this again using other types of squash.

Tried many fried zucchini recipes.  This is absolutely the best. I was hard to not eat it before it ever got to the table! I only made one tiny change - added some parmesan before serving!

Good as written.  Fry at a higher temperature to keep zucchini from being soggy, high to medium high depending on your stove.

id say this would actually be good on top of a steak, we fry onions and put them on steak all the time and this tasted like that, oily and almost caramelized, but delicious, i picked out all the onions and ate those first!

My boyfriend and I thought these were pretty good.  We did add extra garlic powder and a few other seasonings.  We let them sit for an hour before we fried them.  We made sure that all the pieces were covered.  After reading other reviews, we thought we would try to cook them two ways.  The first way was Jon's way. The second was dipping them in egg and once again in the cornmeal mix.  We really enjoyed Jon's way, especially after letting the pieces cool off.  Even though they didn't have a lot of the batter on them they tasted a lot better.  Thanks Jon!

This is a good and EASY way to make fried zucchini.  You do need to follow the recipe.  I tried without onions once, and the batter didn't form on the zucchini as well as it did with the onions.  I was more than happy to wait the 30 min or longer to be able to avoid the mess of dipping in egg or milk.

Very simple and delicious!  I was out of cornmeal and used crushed croutons instead which added great flavor.  I gave the 30 min. wait a try, but did end up dipping in milk and then back through the flour/crouton mixture.

i added turmeric, cayenne pepper, and cumin to the mix.  also, only used cornmeal.  to make it more "batter" like, i added milk to the whole thing (flour mixture on veggies).  Also, I did this with chicken and it worked great!

My husband made these one evening as an after thought. They were tasty. He double dipped them to get more of the crunch crust on the zucchini. We had some left over and ate them another day and they were still great after reheating them in the oven for 10 minutes.

I also never got the 'batter' that was suppsta form. So i fried some up the way it said and it was GROSS!! So i made the fried zucchini the way i thought it should be made and it was great!!! It worked for both the zucchini and the oinions, and also had great flavor. Where the flavor for the orginal recipe there was none. I will stick to my way...

I suppose I should have read the cooking time of 20 minutes.  I thought once you dropped them in the oil that they would cook and brown up in no time.  I ended up throwing out the first batch but then when I did the second batch and waited patiently...they came out great!!!  Very tasty.  I think next time I will cut them up like french fries and find a tasty dipping sauce!

These were very yummy!  But you have to be careful not to let the flour mix with the zucchini for too long- like I did- cuz they get too "wet" and some of the batter didn't stick to the zucchini in the oil. But the taste and texture was very good!

Yummy. Sometimes I leave out the cornmeal for a little lighter taste. I also slice the pieces extremely thin using a mandoline.

I really had trouble with this recipe.  First of all, ONE Illinois zucchini caused me to have to double the recipe!  Then a batter NEVER formed?  All I had was a huge mess in the bottom of my frying pan.  Just ok but wouldn't make it again.  Sorry

I'm sorry but this was awful. The "batter" wouldn't stick to anything and it had no flavor at all. The cornmeal texture just made it gritty. I'll stick with a real batter next time.

This was good, but I had issues with the batter not sticking to the zucchini or onions.

Neither the zucchini nor the onion would take the coating, except for a few zucchini sticks. I dipped all the pieces that didn't have a coating into an egg mixture and re-floured them. I ended up with yummy onion rings and soggy sticks - I didn't know what to look for in the sticks, so they cooked too long. Other than that, it's the closest thing to A&W's zucchini sticks that I've seen.

I loved it! I nibbled nearly 1/2 before we sat down to dinner! I just used flour and fried it in a little oil and a little butter until crisp. The fresh butter helps it crisp and gives it a good flavor. Loved the crispy onion. Reminded me of onion rings. I'd never thought of putting onion in with the zucchini. Thanks so much! I might make more tonight. YUM!

This recipe was somewhat tasty, but I prefer a crispier coating.

This was okay, but not exactly what I was looking for.  Next time I'll try the flour, eggwash, flour batter that another reviewer suggests or a good ol' Southern beer batter.  All in all, not a bad recipe, just not what I was hoping for.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I am extremely subject to err, so it is likely that I may have done something wrong, but, I would've liked the batter to bond better on the veggies.  However, this is definitely a keeper, and I will make it again and again (at my husband's request).
