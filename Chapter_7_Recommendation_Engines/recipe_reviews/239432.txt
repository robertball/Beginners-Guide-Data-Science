Tinga is one of our favorites and this one is the best on this site. There is only one flaw in this recipe and it is a big one in my opinion that might detour people from trying this and that is the "ready in" 10 hours 20 minutes. This has got to be a typo so please do not let it fool you. Plan for 4 hours max because this is all you need. Don't skimp on the toppings and I promise that you won't be disappointed!

Tinga is one of my favorite Mexican dishes.It is easy to prepare and full of flavor and very versatile as you can put it in tacos, tostadas, quesadillas or even as a filling in an omelet.The original recipe uses tomatillos instead of tomatoes and the red color is actually given by the chipotle pepper and the adobo sauce. Many people use tomatoes because it is what they have in hand and in some regions or countries is difficult to find tomatillos. The flavor is amazing no matter if you use tomatoes or tomatillos. This is the first time I use the slow cooker for cooking  tinga and it came out pretty good. I cut the chicken into thick strips to shred the chicken easily. I don't really like a messy tinga so I thought this would help the texture and presentation of it and it did. I added 3  more tomatoes to the recipe as I thought the dish was going to be a little bit dry and  I suppose I was right because mine was perfectly moist. I added some salt at the end of the cooking process. We enjoyed it in tacos and tostadas. Yummy!

Delicious!  I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I subbed canned tomatoes that I drained.  These are super flavorful and I found myself wishing I hadn't cut the recipe in half.  I won't make that mistake again!  Next time I'll increase the chipotle by 50% or perhaps add a spoonful of the adobo sauce, because we like spicy stuff and these are just mildly spicy.  Thanks for a tasty, healthy dinner, Mazola!

This was good but it wasn't really flavory enough for us, even with flavorful toppings like limes, cilantro, and cotija. I could've added more chipotles, but that would have added more heat. I do think in the future I would need to add something to liven it up without heating it up! A very nice solid base to dress up, though, and I liked what browning the chicken before throwing it in the crockpot brought to the party. Thanks Mazola!

This turned out well for us. I made it for chicken tacos. It didn't have anyone saying "Wow," but it's a good basic recipe for use in a lot of different dishes. I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used canned Rotel tomatoes that I drained.

Easily a five star recipe and what's even easier about this recipes is that it's done in a slow cooker. Use your favorite taco toppings for the perfect meal.

The chipotles added a nice smoky flavor, and the easy prep was great. We all enjoyed it!

Very good and easy! We loved it and I will make this one again. The house smelled so good as it cooked away.

Felt like it was missing something. This is the first tinga I've made, and it did not live up to any I've had before. Even the tinga from the cheap burrito place in the mall is better. The only real flavor seems to have come from the adoba sauce, but that ended up just being overwhelmingly spicy and killing any flavor from the other ingredients. My husband enjoyed it, though.

This tasted pretty good  but there was too much tomatoes for our taste. We are not big fans of  "cooked" tomatoes , so we didn't care much for this type of taco filling.

I have never had chicken tinga before so I did not know what to expect. I forgot to take my chicken out the night before so I did not brown it. I placed the frozen chicken in the slow cooker for 4 hours on high, seperated the breasts and flipped them over in the liquid and cooked for 4 hours on low. I shredded the chicken and placed it back in the liquid. I tasted the chicken and was expecting something more. I added some lime juice, homemade salt free taco seasoning and some of the adobo sauce from the peppers. I also found it way too liquidy, I think 1/4 cup would be better for the chicken broth. I made tostadas with the chicken, which my family enjoyed.

This was just OK.  

Pan-frying only one side of the chicken seemed curious, a step that made preparation more involved without an obvious flavor benefit.

If we make it again, we will cut way back on the chicken broth; even with a slotted spoon to serve the chicken, there was liquid pouring out the sides of our taco shells.

Also recommend using warm tortillas instead of taco shells, to better hold the meat and tomatoes.

The chicken was super-tender, which was a plus.

Overall, there was less flavor than we would have anticipated, and it felt like something was lacking.

Packed with flavor! My husband made this when I was at work and it turned out great. Much better than I expected. He put the whole can of peppers in so it was very spicy. I would make it less spicy next time but it's hard to stop eating it's so good! It was a hit with my entire family. I ate it just by itself without making it a taco- just added cheese on top. The rest of the family ate it as suggested. So good!
