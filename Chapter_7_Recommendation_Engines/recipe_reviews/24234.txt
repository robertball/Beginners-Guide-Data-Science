I added 8 oz sour cream to this and doubled the salsa.  It turned out good, except I added too much taco seasoning for my taste.  Everyone ate it up, so I guess it wasn't too strong for my guests.  Next time I'll go easier on the seasoning.

Excellent and extremely to make. Looks kinda blah but tastes amazing.  Black Olives would add nicely for both taste and appearance.

This was an absolute hit at my work. I normally have to make double because it goes so fast. You can also use low-fat or fat-free cream cheese. It doesn't change the taste.... and those that refuse to eat low-fat will never know!

I love it!  And so easy to make.  I already had most of the ingredients around the house, making it a great appetizer to throw together in a pinch!
I actually used triscits as my "chip" and it was a hit!

This is a recipe my mother had given to me a long time ago, it's great because you can make tons of adjustments to it as desired. You can add a layer of guacamole or kick it up a notch with spicy salsa but it will still be loved even if you just do the basics. No one will be able to resist.

I modified this a bit based on a similar dip that I had recently. I used all of the ingredients listed on the recipe but added 8 oz of sour cream as well. Because of that, I doubled the salsa and the taco seasoning. This was a huge hit and everyone loved it! I will certainly make this again.

Another favorite of my and everyone who has tried it.  I have made this twice.  The first time I used half fat free and half 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  It was great both ways.  I going to make this again.

Thanks Jennifer!! This recipe is just what I was looking for!! Even just for me I may double it the next time!! I did increase the taco seasoning to 3t. because I love spicey foods and that's what I was wanting! I also doubled the salsa and the cheese and added a 2oz. can of sliced black olives. I put 1/2 of the cheese in the dip and 1/2 on top...same with the olives. I was making something  "different" for myself for lunch so that's why I added the extra cheddar...didn't have to! If you like olives,  those are really good in this!! A few crackers and I was set!!  The hardest part was letting it chill for an hour but it was worth it. Absolutely delicious! Made it mild for someone else one time...very easy to adapt!!

My daughter's Godfather couldn't have enough of this.  The only change I made was spread to it on flour tortillas, roll them up, refrigerate & then slice them in to pinwheels.  I made them for a party yesterday and they were gone in a flash!  Definitely will keep doing this recipe.

This is so easy and so good.  I used hot and spicy taco seasoning mix, more hot salsa and topped with black olives.  Next time I'm going to add green onions.

This dip was amazing! All my friends loved it so much.
First time I made it it was a little hard to dip because the chips would crack easily, but then the second time around I added a little more salsa and it was the perfect consistency! I also added some chopped up tomatoes and green onions to add a little extra flavour and colour!

Holy moly, this is yummy! What a surprise hit, and for so little effort! I read through the reviews and made a few tweaks, but nothing big. I used more taco seasoning to taste (about 2 tsp of the top taco mix on this website), increased the salsa to 1/2 cup, added 1/4 cup plain yogurt (sour cream would work), mixed in some of the shredded cheddar, and used less than the 8oz called for. Thank you for such a great recipe! Delicious and easy.

Love it! I make this a lot for parties and events, I always get compliments. I just use chili powder instead of taco seasoning. I add to taste.

I have made this recipe many times, and it is always a hit! one tip to spice up the appearance of it is to chop up sweet peppers, red, green, yellow, orange, and sprinkle over the top! especially with red and green, it makes the dip very festive looking for the holidays!!  and it also adds a bit of crunch. Delicious!

This is such a tasty, quick appetizer to throw together.  Always a hit with my family and friends when I make it.  The best part is that it is ingredients I ususally have in my house. I do go a little heavier on the taco seasoning, but that is just my taste preference.

This is my mother's specialty!  Whenever we're invited to a potluck people always assume she will bring it.  Our varation, however, is a little different.  We don't use taco seasonings, but we do add more veggies on top.  We assemble ours with the cream cheese/salsa mixture as the base and then top (in this order) with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes and onions, and shredded mexican mix cheese.

It also tastes yummy with Harry & David pepper relish.

My family is addicted to the 7 layer taco dip so when this was before them, they were a little skeptical until they tasted it! They all loved it and I will definately make it again...thanks!

I made this for some friends over the weekend, and it was gone in less than 15 minutes. A creamy salsa dip that's great with tortilla chips, and couldn't be easier!

I thought since this was an easy recipe that it would be good but I am sorry this was a little bland for my taste.  It wasn't nothing truly in it to give it an unique taste.  I made it for a party and I am glad I made a small batch.  It didn't go over that well and I brought some home.  I will not be making this one again.

This didn't last long! I followed the advice of another reviewer and added sliced black olives over the cheese topping. I also found that this looked better in a glass 9 in pie dish rather than the 8 in casserole dish.

This was a good base to start, but I think people will adjust this a lot according to their own tastes...some like it spicy and some like it mild. I adjusted with more taco seasoning and salsa. Lots of options, but an easy fix.

This dip is so simple and easy.  I doubled it for a large party and it was a big hit.  I did stir in some cheddar into the creamcheese just for some color.  I topped it with sliced black olives and cheddar again just for presentation and color, served it with triscuits and it was a fast, easy and simple dish.

I've been making a very similar taco dip for years. The only difference is I add an 8 ounce container of sour cream. I also just spread the salsa on top, then the cheese.

Thanks for the dip! I make one similar to this but I use sour cream, salsa, onions, peppers, salt, shredded cheese. I am going to try yours now, we'll see which I like better!

Made this last night for a potluck.  I made a double batch and it was gone in minutes!  I topped with black olive slices and chopped green pepper.  Served with jalapeno tortilla chips.  Thanks for the tasty, easy and cheap recipe!

This was definitely an easy dip to make and very good.  I used regular taco mix and mild salsa, adding a little bit more of each and it was flavorful enough for me, who is not a fan of super spicy foods.  I should have used a bigger container to put the dip into as it was a bit too 'thick' and would have been better spread out more.  It disappeared quick at the meeting I took it to.  Will definately make again!!

I have made this for years with a slight variation.  I combine the cream cheese, taco seasoning and sour cream as the first layer of the dip.  I spread salsa on top, then a layer of shredded lettuce, then taco flavored cheese, then diced tomatoes.  Best served with nacho cheese doritos!

I have also made this adding cottage cheese to it.  I hate cottage cheese but somehow it makes this so good.  I think it tastes better if yo let it sit overnight.

Made this for New Years Eve Party 09.  Loved it.  I changed the recipe as suggestion by others who reviewed this dip.  I added 1 3/4 teaspoons of taco seasoning, and 2/3 cup of salsa.  Didn't add all of the cheese that the  recipe called for.  Also chopped red, yellow and green peppers on top. I will make this again.

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years now and can never go wrong. I add sourcream to make it stretch a little more and extra salsa. We top it off with black olives, tomotoes and shredded cheese...Perfect!

This is one of my family's favorite dips.  Sometimes we top it with lettuce, tomato and black olives too, which is really good.  Lots of times I make this to serve on the side when we grill hot dogs or hamburgers.  Really good on a hot summer day!

I really liked the base of this dip, although I must admit I liked it more without the cheddar cheese on top.  I will probably use this as the base of my usual taco dip (with layers of refried beans, lettuce, cheese and tomato). Yum!

Extremely easy!!! Everyone gobbled it up in minutes.  Next time I will double the amounts.  Stays soft and easy to dip the chips into. Great for that unexpected guest or when you need to bring a dish to a party.

A TREMENDOUS HIT!! I made 2 batches and it wasn't enough. Everybody asked me for the recipe. I had to doctor the recipe. Doing it the way it is written here it basically tastes like cream cheese.  Very, very bland and tasteless.  I had to tinker with it and add more salsa and more taco seasoning to get it to taste like taco and then even more to give it a bite.  If you like it hotter you will need to add some hot sauce.  It is easy to make but would recommend you zapping the cream cheese in the microwave for a bit to soften it up.  It doesn't mix well just room temp softened.  I used wheat crackers to serve it on just as a test and everybody liked that better than tortilla chips.

I'm a 18 year old college student who can't cook pasta without it being a huge deal. This was honestly the easiest recipe I've ever used, and it's SO TASTY :) I made a really small batch just to be sure I like it, and since I'm in love with it I will definitely be making bigger batches soon! Very cheap to make as well :) Thanks!

This just didn't quite live up to my expectations based on all of the other positive reviews.  I followed the recipe to a tee, but the amount of shredded cheese called for is a little much in proportion to the cream cheese base--I used one cup instead of two, and I garnished everything with sliced olives and green onions, which helped both the taste and appearance.  That said, I still wasn't all that thrilled with the results.  This dip definitely won't stand up to a chip if it's cold, so make sure that you bring it to room temperature before serving (I actually heated some of my leftover dip, and I enjoyed it much more that way).

This was good, but I was looking for a hot(instead of cold) taco dip so I added ground beef to my dip. I first put the cream cheese mixture in the bottom of a baking dish first, then I put my cooked ground beef on top of the cream cheese mixture (I seasoned my ground beef with 2 tablespoons of taco seasoning, then I topped it off with shredded cheddar cheese, covered it with aluminum foil, and put it in the oven for 20 minutes. Turned out good.

Really like this dip. I don't always put the cheddar on top, but if I do I grate it really fine, otherwise it kinda overwhelms the dip.

I LOVE this recipie,but do it a little different. I double it, because it goes so fast. I omit the taco seasoning. Soften the cream cheese and stir in a 16oz jar of salsa. Spread on platter and refrigerate while I cut up the veggies. I use: red, yellow and green pepper, tomatoes, cucumbers, spanish onion(sometimes I leave it on the side for those that dont like),radishes,lettuce, XTRA SHARP CHEDDAR CHEESE & whatever else we feel like. Mix all together, and spread over the mixture (Then I sprinkle w/more cheese). Serve with Tortilla chips....AWESOME!!!!

Sorry but we didn't care for this. My husband made a strange face when he first tasted it. Maybe it was the type of salsa that I used. It was easy to prepare however.

I thought this was pretty good but I think if I made this again I would put more seasoning than what is called for.  Everyone I had over enjoyed the dip.

Very good! We added about a half cup of sour cream, then some extra salsa and taco seasoning. At the end we sprinkled some black olive slices on top. Next time I’ll follow the advice of other reviewers and double the recipe because it went very fast!

I thought this was good for an easy snack. I used 2 t taco seasoning--3/4 t was too bland for me. I mixed most of the shredded cheese in with the dip and just sprinkled a little on top. I ate this with pretzels, and it was great. I had it with crackers the next day, and I think it would be good in a tortilla cut into pinwheels. Thanks for a tasty, easy recipe.

it is pretty bland. the cream cheese (8 oz) is the predominant flavor.  it needs more salsa or taco seasoning. I  do think the recipe should include olives and tomatoes. I wont make it again unless I add additional ingredients.

Super easy and really good... Did not change it at all except for doubling it... I can see how the salsa choice could "make it or break it". I used Pace medium and it turned out pretty good.

I mixed the shredded cheese in with it rather than put on top. I added a pinch more taco seasoning and a little more salsa. Very good, quick and eady!

Thanks for the quick and easy appetizer recipe! It was exactly what I needed for a party, and I had everything on hand. I doubled the recipe, using 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 cream cheese. I also didn't read the directions, so included the cheese in the mix. (Oops) I used a little extra cheese and some black olives as garnish. I served it with tortilla chips I had on hand. The pan was cleaned out, and I caught one person hanging out beside it, enjoying it alongside conversation at the party. I'm keeping this recipe! Thank you for sharing!

I used Mild Picante Sauce instead of Salsa. It's what I had on hand & they're so similar. It was so good. Took to a cook-out & I think someone licked the bowl. This time I'm using a Medium Picante sauce & spicier taco seasoning. Can't wait!

I read all of the reviews, and one thing I noticed was how boring it looked (not tasted).  So, just to make it pretty, I did not mix the salsa in with the cream cheese.  I put in on top, then the cheddar, and I put green onion on top (personal preference).  I don't like olives so I didn't add, but it would look nice.  Bottom line- I made this for an outing.  The only problem is, I have dipped into it at least 6-7 times.  I am going to have to make another one to take out, as by the end of the evening, I am pretty sure this one will be at least half gone. Easy and yummy.  I did follow one suggestion and double everything, but used one 8oz cr. cheese and one 8oz sour cream.  I used a little more taco seasoning, but did it to taste.  I can't believe I have been buying this at the store for BIG bucks, and now I can make it myself.

I thought this dip as is was a 4* recipes, but with modifications was great. I first followed the recipe precisely (although I did use low fat cream cheese) with medium salsa. After a couple hours in the fridge, the bf and I decided it was too bland, so we added another 1/3 cup of salsa, about 10 drops of green tabasco and another tsp+ of taco seasoning. We mixed in the cheese that was on top and added a little more. Then, it was flavorful and great (and very well received with tortilla chips at the party).

I made this yesterday and really liked the fact that it is really easy and I had all the ingredients.  However I feel that it needs something else.  The taste reminded me of those little jars of cheese spreads from Kraft.  I thought maybe I'll add a can of diced green chilies, chopped onions etc. next time.  I put it in a 9 in. glass pie plate and only added about half as much cheese.

This recipe is great! I have been taking it to family and work functions since I first found it here about two years ago(My mom always requests it). I top it off with sliced or diced olives.

This was really good...but I forgot to add the cheese. My boyfriend liked it too...but don't tell him I forgot the cheese. I will just add it the next time I make it and he will think that I created something new.

I did not have the ingredients to make my traditional taco dip and I found this one. It came out really good. Even the kids liked it. I may alter my normal recipe and use this one as my "bottom layer". I also added extra fresh tomatoes, green onions and olives on the top.

not bad if  you are looking for a quick appetizer...even better if you add more veggies.
