These potatoes are great, and so yummy.  The only drawback is time, but I cut that by microwaving the potatoes instead of using the oven for the first round of cooking.  Soooo good!

These were very good, and my first attempt at twice baked potatoes.  I put the potatoes in the microwave for a minute each to cut down on the baking time (it cuts it almost in half, and they still come out great in the oven).  I also sprinked the outside of the potatoes with water and then rolled them in salt so the skin would come out crispy in the oven.  I didn't use the American cheese, instead I used more shredded cheddar.  Everyone asked for seconds!

These were really good. Hubby's not a big fan of sour cream or cheese, so he missed out, but I certainly enjoyed these.  Didn't add the american cheese on top but could certainly use more than 1/4 cup of cheddar in the mixture.  I like mixing in some garlic oil and topping them off with green onions and chopped bacon.  Make sure you've got lots of salt and pepper!!

WOW!! These were Awesome..easy to make and delicious to boot.  Everyone in my family enjoyed these...and that's hard to do!!!  I followed this recipe pretty much to the letter, though I probably only used half a carton of sour cream instead of a whole.  This recipe is definately a keeper and thanks for sharing!!!

Very good basic recipe! I didn't use as much sour cream, because I only had small potatoes. I also just added more shredded cheese to the top instead of the american cheese. I didn't have as much time, so I microwaved them for 4 minutes and cooked for the rest.  They turned out really smooth and delicious, and were gone quickly. Next time, I'll add some chives/green onions. Thanks!

Way too much sour cream and not near enough cheese, also bland.  I nuked a couple more potatoes and added to the mixture, 1 cup of cheese, garlic salt, and a package of Concord Foods Potato Toppers, was much better, but still over powered with sour cream.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have made it several times and it is a big hit.  I am not a fan of American cheese so I top mines off of cheddar.

I agree with way too much sour cream.  I reduced after reading the other reviews.  I also didn't like the idea of American cheese, so I used motz. and provel (two of our favorites).  Turned out really good.  Thanks for a base for a good side dish.

These were -amazing-.  I cut down on the sour cream to equal about three generous spoonfuls, and I let the potatoes cool a bit before scooping out the insides.  Used cheddar on top instead of American, and rolled them in salt after scrubbing them.  Sooooo good -- creamy and crispy outsides -- husband and I were fighting over the leftovers!  There was also leftover stuffing, so I tossed it in a ramekin, topped it with cheese, and cooked it along with the other potatoes.  Great!

I find the potatoes to be a little plain if you make them to recipe. I add chopped green onions, garlic, season salt, more shredded cheese and no sliced cheese. The toppings you'll want to use will vary on your taste, but you'll probably want to add something. Definitely a great starting point to customize on. I do the first round of cooking in the microwave. That makes them way faster and tastes just as good.

I used the very large baking potatoes, rubbed them with olive oil and rolled in kosher salt.  Baked in a 400 degree oven for an hour or so which gave a dark and a little crunchy skin.   I already have plans to make more and change up the ingredients.

Easy to make and very tasty. I bake the potatoes at 500 degrees for an hour, this insures a crisp skin that is easy to cut and maintains it's shape well. In my opinion, the time in the oven isn't as important as the crispness of the skin. If you run a fork into the tater at the end of an hour and the skin is still soft, bake it some more. Let's face it, baked potatoes are fairly idiot proof as regards over cooking! Bon appetit!

We really enjoyed these.  Changes I made;  halved the potatoes because they were VERY large, added garlic garlic, halved the sour cream & doubled the cheese.  I think I will add some herbs next time.  Needs some color in the mixture, IMO.

These were delishious and very simple. I was pressed for time so I put them in the Microwave instead of baking them for an hour and then I baked them for 20 minutes at 350. They still came out great

Very tasty filling but I found it very hard to scoop out the inside of the potato. Maybe they need to be boiled first? All I know is that I followed the instructions and they still came out half done.

These are great. I added a little more than 1/3 cup sour cream because the mixture was dry. I also added some seasoned salt and chives. Topped with additional cheese on top.

It is a pain as far as cooking the potatoes, but the end product is worth it. I did do a couple of things different. I added extra butter instead of sour cream, and I used shredded monteray jack/colby cheese instead of american.

These were great.  After filling the potatoes with the mixture, plenty of potato mix was left to make a potato soup that is still being raved about a week later.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

I made these almost exactly as the recipe, but I had to add two cloves of fresh garlic to the mixture because I love garlic.  I did not think cheese slices would be attractive, and I did not have any so I had to use grated cheddar as a substitute.  I put the mixture in a piping bag and squeezed the mixture back into the potatoes with the huge star tip.  It looked nice with sprinkled bacon and green onion.  The taste was good, but not great, even with the added onion, bacon, and garlic. It was my first attempt at these, so I will definitely have to find a way to add more flavor next time, maybe more butter or cheese or something.

Super easy and a good basic recipe that can be modified according to individual tastes (with chives, garlic, bacon, etc). I didn't really measure the quantities of sour cream, butter, or cheese... just tasted as I went. I also brushed the potato skins with olive oil and salt before baking. Yum!

After reading the reviews, I altered the recipe only to decrease the amount of sour cream and increase the cheddar cheese. HUGE hit here, zero leftovers.

The potatos tasted great, but next time I'll use butter without the sour cream. My husband doesn't care for sour cream. I had trouble scooping out the the inside, maybe next time I'll cook the potatos for a shorter amt. of time so it doesn't fall apart

These took a lot longer to bake-I would suggest microwaving the baked potato first to soften it before baking.

Twice baked potatoes are always a favorite at our house.  I use lots of butter and sour cream as Cyndi does and think it makes them so much better.  
A tip for a full meal - add crabmeat or small shrimp.  Yummy Yummy!!

Potatoes turned out great.  Wonderful flavor.  I baked the potatoes the night before to cut down on time the next day.  Next time I think I'll microwave them.  ONE TIP - when you scoop the potato out of the skin, leave enough of the potato to form a protective "shell" so you don't break through the skin of the potato. My boyfriend liked them so much I caught him sneaking the leftovers out of the fridge and eating them cold!

This one is a winner! I just tweaked it a little bit by adding 3 oz bacon bits (real of course), adding double the cheese to the filling, and not putting the slices on top, and using sour cream w/chives (you can buy at most grocers). We ALWAYS have lots of filling left over so I love to stuff peppers with the remaining filling then bake them for 7 minutes @350. It's become a family favoriate, as well as my friends favoriates too!

This recipe is so easy and the potatoes are delicious.  Rather than using sour cream, I added a little milk and put the cheddar cheese on top.  It was a hit with my family and our dinner guests.

These were so easy to make! I ended up halving the recipe, and I only used about 60% of an 8oz container of sour cream because of other comments, which turned out to be a fine amount. I also didn't add the American cheese on top as I'm not a big fan of it in general. I also cheated one more time, cooking the potatoes in the microwave instead of baking them for the first time, and then just stuck them in the oven for 20 min. after I mixed all the ingredients. Will definitely make again... even my boyfriend who doesn't like sour cream or "baked potatoes" loved this!

Wonderful recipe!! I coated the potatoes in olive oil and sprinkled some garlic salt and season salt on them before I baked them, turns the jackets into crispy shells. Mmmm. I also add some finely chopped green onions to the potato mix. These were the hit of the meal!!! Thanks

Yum! Very good! I used fat free sour cream, reduced fat cheese, and the boyfriend added Bacon Bits to his. I added half a slice of Cheddar Cheese to the top of each during the last 10 minutes. SO good.

These potatoes were delicious. I didn't use near that much sour cream, and instead of topping with the sliced cheese I used more grated. When I make them again I will add some green pepper to give it a bit more taste.

Pretty good, though not like I remember from restaurants.  This recipe has more sour cream than what I've had in twice baked potatoes before.  The small potatoes were done after one hour but two slightly larger potatoes were not.  Make sure you use a very sharp knife when cutting the tops off of the potatoes. A dull knife is likely to take the skin off before cutting through the potato.  This is an very worthy side dish; good flavor.

Can we say YUMMY???? These potatoes were extra good! I followed the recipe other than not adding the American cheese at the end. I left that out and am so glad I did. They didn't need that extra bit. Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This recipe turned out really delicious with a few changes. My boyfriend is not crazy for sour cream so I halved the amount the recipe called for. I also used more butter and instead of american cheese on top I used grated sharp chedder. If you are in a hurry like I was you can put the potatoes in the microwave for the first round of "baking"(four to four 1/2 minutes each side). Turned out delicious and they were great for lunch the next day!

These potatoes were excellent!  Tasted great and looked good too...  I made these the first time for company and they all had good things to say.  After reading the reviews, I did adjust the recipe a bit by putting in a little less sour cream than the recipe called for.  We will definitely have these again.

These were soooo delicious! It was also a great recipe to make ahead of time, so I wasn't so frantic trying to get everything ready all at once. I filled the potatoes and put them in the fridge until I was ready to bake them. Instead of cheese slices, I used shredded cheese. They turned out great!

The first time I made these for my family, they loved them and asked for seconds -- even my youngest brother, who only eats mashed potatoes, and my other younger brother, who only eats baked potatoes. They liked them even better the second time around when I cut the amount of sour cream in half. :)

Loved these potatoes!  I used about half the sour cream and they still were delicious.  Also, I prepared mine in the morning so I only had to pop them in the oven at dinnertime.

I've made this recipe several times as written and as other reviewers have commented, the only draw-back is the time. I was serving them with Prime Rib last night and wanted them to look and taste up-scaled but wanted to cut the baking. I began by poking 8-10 holes in each potato, wrapping them in very moist paper towels, and microwaving them for 3-4 minutes on each side. They come out looking like potatoes baked in the oven this way. I then added 1/8 c. of sauteed onions minced in butter along with 1/8 c. of Parmesan cheese to the potato/sour cream mix. I topped them with cheese, crisp cooked bacon, and sliced green onions; broiling them long enough to be golden brown. It took about 25 minutes total. They went well with the Prime Rib and I'll definitely make it again this way for special occasions.

I've made twice baked potatoes many times, but thought I would follow this recipe tonight. The potatoes didn't cook after an hour on 350, so they were still pretty rock hard. They didn't come out of the skins well, so I ended up making a casserole with the ingredients.  Next time I will just cook the potatoes on 450 and I'm sure they will turn out much better!

This was easy and quite tasty.  I cut out the American cheese and just added some more cheddar on top.  I used less sour cream and butter and I added chives and bacon bits.

These were so good!!! This was my first time making twice baked potatoes...I'm not a big sour cream fan so I used ranch dip instead, and also added a little garlic powder and parmesean cheese to the mix........I topped with shredded cheese...delicious!!

I would givet his 5 with the change I just made. We didn't have enough sour cream and I wanted to add some flavor per other reviews, so I added about 8 ounces of French Onion Veggie Dip (store-bought) instead of the sour cream. They are superb!

there can be no other recipe for twice baked! i made these another time in a casserole dish because the potatoes i used were way too small to bother using the skins. i left the mushrooms out both times (i'm the only one that likes them!)--what a great recipe!

These are excellent!  I too microwaved the potatoes for a few minutes first.  Really cut down prep time.  I also added a little ranch dressing to the mixture.  I also broiled them for a couple minutes before serving to give them a crisp top.

This recipe is great. My boyfriend, who is not a big fan of potatoes even loved it! Next time I will add a more cheddar cheese into the potatoe mix. Also, my potatoes were pretty large so i used a whole slice of american cheese on top. It was great me and my boyfriend loved them, and then three of my friends had one the next day and loved them too, they heated up again great.

This is a really good recipe. I made it for the first time and it turned out really good. I added cheddar cheese on the top instead of American and rolled the potatoes in salt for a crunchier potatoe.

Not as suggested. More work than described. Potatoes need to cook much longer. My first attempt with this for Christmas dinner did not go as planned. Blender broke while processing because potatoes were not done as suggested in directions.

My husband and son made these on their own (code for this is not complicated) and we all enjoyed them. The second time around we used low fat sour cream and they were still good. Next time we plan to throw in some cooked bacon bits and scallions. Good solid addition to my collection.

Very yummy.  I cut time by microwaving the potatoes for the first round of baking.  I also make a triple batch and freeze most of the potatoes before baking.  Then when I want to add this to a meal I just thaw and then bake.  This makes a great meal with a salad.

Everyone liked them, though I had to use cheddar cheese instead of American.  Also made some with bacon and they were super appealing.

I decided to try these potatoes because  they were similar to the one I’ve been making for years.  I have to say they were pretty good but not as good as mine.  I bake the potatoes, scoop them out add butter, onion powder, s& p, sour cream and put them baked into the potato skin  and bake at 350 degrees for 30-40 mins.

These are so simple and satisfying. I used cheddar instead of American cheese, but both are great. These freeze pretty well too. I wrap in plastic wrap, then in foil. They don't look as pretty when they thaw out, but they taste delicious.

I added about 6 slices of bacon, cooked crisp and crumbled - delicious! Will definitely make this again. Also, I just cut potatoes in half and scooped the flesh out.

Once again we made too much and we ended up eating them for three days. Only make the serving size family of three we would have left overs even if we made 6. Very good and very filling. Good recipe better than the normal potatoes in my house.

This was a hit! I used a packet of ranch salad dressing to the potatoes before I mashed them and then the sour cream, wonderful kick. Only thing I recommend is that you top with shredded cheddar instead of slices, melts better.

I really liked these!  I put some dried chives into the filling and put some bacon on top of the cheese before I baked them the second time.  I did everything else exactly as stated.  They were very easy to make.  I will definitely be making these again.

Very good recipe.  Easy and you can add in all types of fixings!  I went with the basic recipe, but since it isn't exactly low-cal I took it to the next level for the "crunch" that was missing for me.  In a separate bowl I mixed panko breadcrumbs with whipped butter (not melted), then dropped the droppings on top of the pre-baked finished potato.  As I said, it gave it a nice crunch and it also looked good.  Excellent!

Yum!  I microwaved them to save time - probably would have been better with the crispy crst you get in the oven, but still yummy!  Skipped the American cheese and used more Cheddar on top.

Very good, the kids raved about these!  The taste is fantastic but they are rather time consuming.  I made them a day ahead of time so that Christmas Day I wasn't in the kitchen all day.  I also coated the outside of the skins with a little water and sea salt.  Very good recipe and good as leftovers as well.

I love this recipe, its super easy to jazz it up with a few extra ingredients. I add a few slices of chopped crispy bacon and some fresh chives and fresh dill to the stuffing, also, I sprinkle bacon and chives on the top after baking. Delish!

This was good, but I'm still looking for 'the one' when it comes to twice baked potatoes recipes. I cooked potatoes as directed, then cut off the top sliver...I scooped out the insides (I needed to scoop more out, though. Don't be lazy, too much of a potato 'shell' ruins the effect...) and stuffed with the filling as directed, then replaced the sliver from the top of the potato, so they looked in tact, but with cheese oozing out. This recipe had too much sour cream for my taste. I used 1/2 of what it called for and twice as much cheese and the sour cream was still a bit much. They were good but I will keep trying.

We enjoyed this recipe, using only 1/2 the sour cream plus it was fat free sour, Smart Balance butter and a smallamount of 1 percent milk, and regular sharp cheddar, we still wanted good flavor. If everything was full fat content I would of given it five stars, but since I'm watching my heart and weight, four stars is it. Thank you! Delishhh...

Easy and good, but a little bit bland. I made a 2nd time and added garlic to the potato mix and topped off with bacon bits.  That made them a lot more flavorful! It is a good recipe though, and I will use it again!

I tweaked the recipe a bit---added just a little cream cheese for some zip.  Not sure exactly how much sour cream I used---enough to make the potato mixture creamy.  I also added bacon bits, then filled the potato skins.  I used shredded cheddar on the top, then bacon for garnish.  Came out hot and tasty!!  Will definitely make this again!!

I took these to my family gathering last year and now the are the only thing I'm "allowed" to bring.  Not difficult at all ... the only thing I'm doing different this year is adding bacon bits.  I'm positive everyone will love them just as much as last year.

This was a very good recipe, although I did make some modifications based on others reviews.  I cut the sour cream down to only 8oz and I upped the butter to 1 cup.  I also added garlic salt and onion powder and then topped with permesean cheese instead of american.

It was delicious. I made a few changes. Instead of adding 2(16 oz of sour cream) I only added one and add 1 and half cups of butter. I also added bacon and broccoli. Instead of cheddar cheese I added mozzarella cheese. Overall it was very good.

This recipe is very easy. Cooking potatoes in microwave first saves time. Also, like other posters have said, larger potatoes take longer. Oh, and I added parmesan and chives to the mix. YUMMY!

Pretty delicious! 

Depending on the size of the potatoes longer cooking may be required. If you have the time, this is an easy recipe and tastes GREAT!

Everyone enjoyed this but I thought it could use more flavor. It was a lot of work and next time I think I'll just make flavored mashed potatoes since that's basically what it is anyway.

I have had more comments on this!  These are absolutely amazing!  I use white American cheese on top and a few drops of shredded cheddar.  They look and taste amazing!
Great recipe!

Sorry to say but 1 hour in my oven at 350 does not make the potatoes soft enough to scoop out.  I ended up messing up..Maybe I'll try again.

These were very tasty. As some of the reviewers mentioned, I used less sour cream than the recipe called for and added chives. I also replaced the American cheese with a slice of Swiss cheese. Rich tasting, with great flavor.

This was my first time with 2ce baked - I have heard many people talk about them so I gave it a shot - They were good but it was an awful lot of work for what turns out to be about the same as a "1ce" baked.  Oh well, I will make again for sure, but not on a week night.

These were great.  They were a little dry when I made them, perhaps I should have used a little cream?
