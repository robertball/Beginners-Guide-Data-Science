This was nicely tangy and different, it really cooked down and reduced well.  I would use this again.

Not to be rude, but this sauce was terrible! To thin and too pungent (both in smell and in taste). Ended up throwing it out and making another recipe (the 'Melt-In-Your-Mouth Meat Loaf' sauce; much better).

I did not care for this sauce at all.  I used it on chicken - didn't have much flavor.

Perry Family BBQ Sauce Haiku: "Why did I make this? Without reading the reviews. Way too watery." Ugh my eyes were burning when I put the ingredients in the pot - sooo much vinegar. After a little while, I added more ketchup, some molasses, a squirt of lemon juice, and some garlic, in the hopes that the flavor would tame, and it would thicken up. No such luck, so I put in a cup of shredded, cooked chicken that I had, hoping it would absorb the "sauce", but even after another hour, it was still too watery. When I went to make a sandwich with it, the bread disintegrated, so to save the chicken, I just added bottled BBQ sauce. Fail sauce. :(

I had to simmer it for 2 and a half hours, used lots of molasses, brown sugar, wondra quick-mixing flour, raspberry jam, pineapple juice, and finally!!! It became edible.
