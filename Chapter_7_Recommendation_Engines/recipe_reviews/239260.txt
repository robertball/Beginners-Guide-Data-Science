This is a very nice recipe. I gave it 4 stars because it was lacking a little flavor. I added some freshly grated ginger and that helped a bunch!

This was very good!! I needed to make more servings and so almost doubled the recipe. I read the reviews about needing a bit more flavor, so I added extra everything (garlic, hoisin, soy especially. I really wished I had fresh ginger like a previous reviewer suggested. I found the sauce to be a bit too thick and "cornstarchy"...I will lessen that next time. It was delicious though and with a little minor tweaking this would be 5 stars. My 8 year old said it tasted like "Chinese food"...a compliment! ;)

This was a really great recipe!  I made some changes to the veggies just based on what I had on hand, adding broccoli and leaving out asparagus and snap peas.  The sauce was great and it came together very nicely!  This is definitely one that I will be making again!

This recipe was literally dinner on the fly! I wanted something fresh and different, so I was up for the culinary challenge. I adjusted the recipe a little, omitting the sugar, red pepper flakes and green onions. When I prepared the sauce, I gathered broth, soy and hoisin sauce with one teaspoon Sriracha with 3 cloves minced garlic and a full teaspoon of freshly grated ginger. I let the sauce mix and sit for 20 minutes while I prepared the chicken and veggies. Grilled chicken with S/P, sesame oil (not corn oil)  and half sliced brown onion .. removed from pan and in the same pan added all veggies with a little more sesame oil till wilted and cooked through. Added the chicken, sauce and corn starch till heated through. I served this over a bed of rice noodles instead of rice, it was a *HUGE* winner!!! Best wishes for Delicious Dishes ;)

Really like this, made according to instructions its delicious and very forgiving and flexible recipe.  I like making the sauce to the side and substituting in whatever. Sriracha, Maggi, Chili paste etc. throwing about anything you have into the wok with the chicken works as well.  Very easy and fast.  thanks for adding this.

Mmmmmm...awesome recipe -- very easy and kids loved it.  I added tofu cubes when I was stir-frying the chicken.  For the sauce, I up'd the soy sauce to 1/4 c, and reduced the chicken broth to 1/4 c, also subbed brown sugar in for the white sugar.  Thanks, Mazola!!

1/2 tsp red pepper flakes

Loved this recipe!  A versatile stir-fry where you can easily add or substitute your favorite protein and/or veggies.  The sauce is slightly sweet and not overly heavy.  I did add more chicken broth after I added the sauce mixture. The sauce thickens up quickly and we prefer a "looser" sauce.  Also took Diana's advice and increased the amount of soy sauce which I think enhanced the flavor.  Will definitely be making this again using shrimp and more veggies.

I tweaked the recipe a little... I used hot chili paste because we like a little heat and substituted with whichever veggies I had handy that stir fry well. (Green beans and broccoli instead of snap peas a

Needed a little peppery seasoning of some kind but good basic recipe for any variety of veggies you happen to have on hand. Do increase the soy sauce, cornstarch mixture maybe adding a little sherry if you have it.

I used peanut oil and stir-fryed in my wok. Improvised by using Trader Joe's frozen bell peppers with onions mix, as I chose this recipe at the last minute and lacked fresh veggies.I food processed the garlic and onions to intensify their flavor, and stir-fried these first, then added the chicken.  I doubled the sauce.

This was delicious and super easy to make. Everyone in the family liked it, even my picky 11 year old. I followed the recipe exactly except I changed the veggies because I didn't have the exact ones listed in the recipe in my refrigerator.  I did pound the chicken before I sliced it into strips which thins it and makes it more tender. It's not necessary to do this though. I will be making this again and again. It's so good.

I used snow peas and broccoli' mushrooms onion and green onion for fresh vegetables added extra vegetables . I added fresh ginger as someone else had suggested . Next time I will cut back on the red crush pepper. My husband does not like pepper. I think the fresh ginger will compensate for omitting the crush pepper. Also I did not have sesame oil so I added peanut oil and rice wine vinegar.

Fantastic dish. I didn't have hoisin sauce so I added a bit more dark soy, honey and black pepper. Also stirred in some carrots and broccoli. Loved the outcome!

Great basic recipe. It can be tweaked to your own tastes. I also reduced the corn starch and added ginger. I used vegetables I had on hand instead of what was called for in the recipe. Will definitely make again

Really easy  to make.  The sauce tasted a little chalky from the cornstarch....I probably didn't have the measurements exactly right though.  Maybe add more liquid next time.  I used Asian Chili Sauce rather than crushed red pepper and cut back on the sugar.  Flavor and consistency was pretty good.   I used red peppers, white onion, snap peas and fresh mushrooms.  I also cheated and reheated grilled chicken leftovers.  I would definitely try this recipe again.

Read other reviews and added more soy sauce.  Cut back pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp.  Also was in a hurry, so bought a  pre-packaged bag of stir fry vegetables and pre- cooked rice that cooked in 90 seconds in microwave. I was a hero in less than 1/2 hour.

Use chicks thighs instead and season them first! I also added green onions to my veggies!
