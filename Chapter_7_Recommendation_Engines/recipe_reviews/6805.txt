I increased this recipe to 1 cup sugar AND 1 cup of blueberries.  Turns out wonderful everytime.  Hubby keeps asking for more blueberry muffins.  And they look just SO BEAUTIFUL.

I read all the reviews.  I doubled the recipe, added 1/3 cup sour cream, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and more berries- they turned out beautifully!  I was careful not to overmix or overbake- the best ones were very lightly browned.. I also used frozen berries- not sure if that would make a difference. My berries were not quite ripe so they gave them a nice tangy flavor that contrasted nicely with the more sweet and cake like muffin.

The muffins are light and fluffy, not weighed down with oil as some are.  But they are also light on flavor, mildly sweet.  They can be made tastier with extra blueberries.

I love the simplicity and ease of this recipe.  The muffins aren't overwhelmingly sweet, but the texture is outstanding (and SO moist!)  I prepared the recipe just as written except that I doubled the blueberries to 1 cup (1/2 seemed like such a small amount) and I used frozen berries.  I also had success foregoing the paperliners and just spraying the pan with cooking spray - they slide right out of the pan.

I am searching for a great blueberry muffin recipe and this is NOT it!!  They were bland and I followed the directions to a T.  I would skip this one and try something else.

I wanted to make Mini-muffins and used this recipe.  I don't know if perhaps I did something wrong or what, but they did not come out good at all.  They were very dry, and not sweet enough.  Not cake-like at all.  Nobody liked them and we ended up thowing away the whole batch.

Works well even when prepared vegan (with soy milk and fake eggs) and using substitute fruit (fresh strawberries were wonderful). My wife loves them.

I'm not sure why this is getting so many bad reviews, I thought they were very good.  I listened to what previous reviewers had to say and increased the sugar and blueberries to 1 cup each.  I used frozen blueberries tossed in a bit of the 2 cups of flour and the muffins turned out perfectly.  Soft, cake like texture with plenty of blueberries.  This will be my go to recipe for blueberry muffins.  However, I don't plan to tell my children I could substitute chocolate chips!

My friend and I made them together and doubled the recipe.  We used dried blueberries bought at T-Joes  We were careful not to over mix, but they had a biscuit like texture, very dense...  I will search for a better, moister recipe!  FYI - Something this recipe didn't call for was vanilla or salt; I just wanted to mention that they are included in the BettyC Cookbook for blueberry muffins and may improve the flavor!

The bf loved these.  I found them to be a bit lacking in flavor.  I added a dash of cinnamon to the top of some of the muffins that was nice, but next time I'll probably add it into the batter.  Also, using vegetable oil I felt really dulled out the flavor, so maybe I'll try applesauce instead.

These turned out great. I added 1-1 1/2 cups of wild blueberries which are smaller than regular blueberries to the dry ingredients then added the wet to the dry (opposite of the instructions) and I added 3/4 cup sugar, a pinch of salt, Tbs of sour cream and a splash of vanilla extract. I had to increase the cooking time to about 30 min. Tender, tasty and beautiful!

I thought these were easy muffins and tasted just fine.  I added a few more blueberries because I have a million right now and I did sprinkle a tiny amount of brown sugar on top each muffin before baking them just for that touch of sweetness.  I'd easily make these again with no changes.

I substituted 1 cup all purpose flour for 1 cup whole wheat flour to give it a healthy boost. I think they are delicious and I don't feel guilty for eating a couple as a snack - I believe they are healthy enough to serve often, whether for breakfast with yogurt or as a stand alone snack with a glass of milk. :) Thank you!

I was looking for a blueberry muffin that wasn't overly sweet or cakey, so I tried these.  They took no time for me to whip up and they are good, but they could be better.  I will make them again, but next time add a pinch of salt, some vanilla and maybe a little cinnamon or lemon zest to mix it up!  This is a good base recipe.

Good base for blueberry muffins.  Needs more sugar, needs more blueberries, needs vanilla extract, lemon zest and more than 1/2 a cup of blueberries.  I usually read reveiws before making a new recipe, but I didn't this time and was not happy with the results.  Then I read the reviews and I see that most everyone feels the same.

I was pleased with the recipe although I coubled the amounts- I found when I made this as a doubled recipe I needed to make changes-- I changed the baking powder from 1 tbsp/1 tsp to only 1 tbsp 
I also added more milk-- from 2/3 cup to 1 1/3 cups - There is still a flavor of baking powder in the finished muffin - I am going to try adding a tsp of lemon juice to the mixture for my next time- Makes 20 muffins when doubled. also didn't quite use 2 cups of berries - still came out with enough berries---Hope anyone that doubles this recipe finds this helpful

I was apprehensive about making these as there were so many varied comments but I love them.  I doubled the recipe, added 1 tsp vanilla, 3 cups of blueberries and 1 heaping tablespoon of sour cream.  Most and flavorful and although not real sweet, they were great.  I will enjoy them with my coffee in the morning.  Don't be afraid of this recipe, it is great.

These were okay, and were very easy to make. Next time I'll use more sugar and add some vanilla. I drizzled some vanilla glaze over the first batch since they tasted a bit bland.

I printed this recipe for my 3 kids to make me for mother's day breakfast because it looked easy.  Well, it must have been too easy for a reason because they weren't good at all.  Very bland, no sweetness at all, and were tough.  If you want easy blueberry muffins, stick with Bisquick.  I do not recommend this one at all, sorry.

I used this recipe many times and I loved it. But I wanted to try something new with it. If you have a cake pop maker you should use this recipe to make blueberry muffin cake pops. They are amazing.

These were delicious. However I think it needs a cup of sugar and a cup of blueberries to be just right.

I really liked these muffins, as did my parents. Some other people who tried them said they were good but not sweet enough. I think they're just used to store bought muffins that taste like cupcakes. I've also substituted the blueberries with chocolate chips, cranberries, and raisins and they wee still good. With the blueberries I add about a tablespoon of lemon zest and they're even better.

I cook for a living and made these for a client...this simple recipe was great, and not cloyingly sweet like supermarket and donut shop muffins.  You must not mix these too much.  Just until it comes together.  I added a cup of blueberries just because I decided to just get rid of all the berries so there wouldn't be any left over.  And horror up horrors, I get to my client's house and he was out of white sugar without telling me!  So I used brown sugar and sprinkled a teeny bit of brown sugar on top before I baked them.  They came out light, fluffy, and perfect for breakfast or with coffee.  In this sugar happy society, I was happy to find an old fashioned recipe that isn't disgustingly sweet.  And remember, DO NOT MIX TOO MUCH!  Just barely mix!  That is THE most important step!

I took other reviewers' advice and increased the sugar to 1 cup, and the blueberries to 1 cup, and added 1 tsp vanilla..  I also coated the blueberries with 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I waited until after the flour, sugar, and baking soda was mixed in, then added the blueberries.  I coated the tops with sugar.  It still felt like the muffins were missing something, so I think next time I might add another 1/2 tsp cinnamon in with the flour.

I decreased the oil to 1/4 cup and added 2-3 T ground flax and 1/3 c applesauce.  I also added more blueberries.  These weren't too bad.  A little bland, but not overly sweet, which works well for me.

These were good, although I don't know what seemed to be missing, but something didn't taste right.  I have made these many many times, with chocolate chips in with them to.  Great recipe and thank you for sharing

I baked these for 30 min and they were still under-cooked. Then when they cooled they were hard and thick, not cake-like at all. I am not the best baker, so it may have been operator error, but even so I will not use this recipe again.

I agree with other people, needs more sugar and more berries, but a good basic recipe.   I used self-raising flour because I didn't have baking powder and it worked well.

Awesome!  I've made these three times so far.  First time, I went ahead and did the 1 cup sugar and 1 cup blueberries like several others suggested.  They were good but that was a lot of blueberries in a single muffin.  They didn't last through the evening so they were still well liked.  So the second time I made them as the recipe states, 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 blueberries.  These didn't make it through the evening either.  Only one complaint, from my daughter, not enough blueberries.  Go figure.  This third time I did a rough estimate of 3/4 cup of sugar and 3/4 cup of blueberries.  That seems to be just the right amount for us.  Next time, mini muffins!  And I want to try substituting chocolate chips for the blueberries as one person suggested.

There was something missing with the flavor of these. They were sweet, but other than that quite bland. I did like the texture of them though. The key there is really in the mixing.

I don't enjoy baking, but this was easy and I had fresh blueberries we picked on vacation.  These were good.  I did use 1 cup plus a handful of berries and because I had no paper cups I just sprayed my pan.  The recipe made 12 regular sized muffins and an additional 12 mini's.  I would add lemon zest next time for some zing and because my berries were a little tart (1st pick of the MA season) possibly a tad more sugar or coat the berries with a little sugar.  Thanks for the recipe.

These muffins were ok. I used 1 c. frozen huckleberries and sprinkled a few chocolate chips on as well. They tasted great! However, they stuck to the liners and totally fell apart when eating. Next time I would just use a greased muffin tin.

Very bland.  They didn't get big and fluffy while baking...stayed like little lead muffins. I sprinkled extra sugar on top to help and still came out without flavor, other than the blueberries.  Also had to bake them an extra 10 minutes or so because they wouldn't brown.  Will not make them again.

Very easy to make (I used this recipe to bake with my toddler for the first time and it was perfect & simple for his first baking experience) and uses only ingredients you are likely to have at home (no need for an extra trip to the store, assuming you have blueberries of course).  But, like many reviewers said, the muffins were not sweet enough.  I'll add more sugar next time, and probably a bit more blueberries.  With those additions, it should be great - the consistency and overall appearance were wonderful.

I am only giving this recipe 3stars because I had to tweak it so much.  I added a big spoonful of sour cream to add moisture.  I added some brown sugar and a tablespoon of maple syrup.  I tripled the amount of blueberries.  The muffins came out great!! The kids love them.

I read the reviews before making this recipe & added salt, vanilla, doubled the sugar & blueberries. I also used buttermilk & increased the oil by 1/4 of a cup. With these adjust the muffins came out perfect. Remember not over mix then fold the blueberries in.

These muffins were perfectly sweet and delicious! I am confused by all of the bland comments I read. Perhaps too many people in our junk food culture expect muffins to be cake-like and sugary, like the processed variety? These were just right, with no changes to the recipe, except perhaps extra blueberries. Fresh blueberries add the extra touch of sweetness we like.

This recipe is very simple and quick!  However, I substituted half whole wheat flour and half white flour, added a 1/2 tsp. extra of baking powder, doubled the blueberries and used organic sugar instead of the granulated white sugar (adding a little extra for a little sweeter muffin).

I used bread flour because I didn't have all-purpose on hand.  I also used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  I didn't measure the berries, so I think I might have doubled the amount.  Kept everyhting else the same.  These were great.

As hungry as we were this morning, no one liked these muffins.  They were definitely too bland.  We will definitely not make them again.

Definately one of the better recipes. I have tried at least 3 now before this one and this one is the best. It didn't need any more sugar, i found it sweet enough, and I had added a 1/2 cup of mashed banana to the recipe for a twist on the flavor. I also added about 1/4 cup more blueberries, even a few more than that would still work. I think I will keep this recipe.

I used a cup of blueberries and semi sweet chocolate chips. Instead of white sugar I used brown and increased to a full cup. Also added a 2 tsp of vanilla extract. So far so good.

Just made these with the blueberries my husband picked last year. Easy, clear instructions and a great product.  Of course you should keep an eye on them as every oven is different.  Mine took 25 mins to cook.  Toothpick came out clean when poked in the middle, not poked in a blueberry.  Then it came out lucious blue.  I would definitely give these to family.  (The people who are not scared to tell you the truth.) If you are not sure about your cooking, definitely go with these!  I doubled the recipe and added an extra 1/2 cup of blueberries, just cause we love them so much.  You can see I was impatient after cooking the first batch, not as brown on top.

I really liked how quickly the recipe comes together with simple ingredients. My 4 year old and I whipped them up and added a dash of vanilla, used a mix of frozen raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries, and sprinkled a touch of brown sugar on the tops. We had to add extra milk however living in dry climate, we seem to have to do that with most recipes. Will make this again.

I increased the sugar to ~2/3, added a splash of vanilla extract, and eyeballed the blueberries.  They were quite delicious - moist and tasty.  A little more cake-like than I was going for, but still good.

For half of the batch, I added in white chocolate chips.  Very good. I will probably be keeping the white chocolate chips.  

Next time, I plan on adding a brown sugar/flour/butter crumble topping.

Followed recipe exactly instead of checking the reviews for tips to enhance it. Needs more sugar and more berries. Made mini muffins and will not put my name on them when I bring them to the office tomorrow. Bland, stick to the liner like crazy and not the crumbly, moist texture I think of when I think muffin. I hope you read the tips for making it better before making it according to the recipe!

Made exactly as directed, nice cakey texture, great flavor, but a bit dry. I would make it again, but add a touch more fat in form of butter, shortening, etc. Or just plan on using butter to spread on them. They ARE much better warm than cooled.

I wanted something quick, this was quick- but tasty? Not really. My kids liked them though. The problem is they are not sweet enough as is and not enough blueberries. It was good for my kids since it was less messy and less sugar, but...well, nobody else felt the same way.

As written, the recipe contains no salt, not enough sugar and absolutely no flavoring.  Needed some vanilla, orange extract, something.  Next time I'm adding orange juice instead of milk, and 1/2 teaspoon of orange extract.  Maybe some vanilla, too.  I've already changed my printed recipe to include 1/2 tsp salt.

While they taste good, mine turned out dry and very crumbly.  Not sure why, perhaps the temperature was too high.  Either way, I suggest adding more blueberries than the recipe calls for, makes them even better!  Also, the recipe made 17 muffins for me, so keep that in mind.

I thought they were delicious; very soft and tasty. Although they needed more sugar and blueberries.  I altered the recipe a bit and added a half a cup more of blueberries and a tidge bit more sugar. But I should have added more. I would recommend 2 and a half cups of sugar.

Good recipe. I double the amount of blueberries and add a little more sugar if I am in the mood for something sweeter although I prefer a less sweet muffin.  The trick is to not over mix, as stated AND to not over-bake... right at 20 min. take them out, even if the tops look a little light in color... they will be nice and fluffy! Great easy recipe!

These muffins are horrible when the recipe is followed. Obviously the people who rated this recipe four or five star did not make it as is. You should rate the recipe as is not what you decided to do to it to make it better.

While they are good, they aren't great. They haven't got much flavour too them and I felt I need more than 1/2 cups of blueberries.

The key to these muffins is definitely NOT to overmix.  The texture was very good.  It wasn't very sweet, which I enjoyed, because I'm counting calories.  It was so easy to make - my 10 year old daughter whipped up a batch this evening which we all enjoyed.  Will definitely make them again.

Pretty good! I used a mashed banana instead of the oil, increased the blueberries to 1 cup and baked it in a casserole pan and cut it in squares. Not the best blueberry bread/muffin I ever had, but enjoyable taste and very easy to whip together.

They seemed a little dry. But perhaps it's because I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh.

Ijust made these muffins and they turned out pretty good.  I think more than anything they need salt added to the batter and more sugar.  I added 3/4 cup and they still were not very sweet.  But with those changes I would make them again.

From reviews, doubled the sugar to 1 C.  My 5 year old and her friend (8) made this recipe for the county fair 4H auction and won the Clover Kids' Grand Champion with this recipe.    My son & his friend made this recipe with mini chocolate chips.    It was a nice basic recipe and a nice recipe to introduce kids to baking.

These were so-so. They came out really white (not golden) but fully cooked. They were not too sweet - very subtle. Definitely a quick & easy recipe.

Texture was light and fluffy, which was what I was looking for.  After reading all the reviews that said it was bland, I used 1/2 c wheat flour, 1 cup fresh blueberries, 1 extra tbsp white sugar, a few pinches of brown sugar, 1tsp vanilla, a few squirts of lemon juice, all in hopes of avoiding some bland muffins.  They were still a little bland, and then I realized, there was NO SALT in this recipe, next time I'll add 1/2 tsp salt.  I also added an extra tbsp white flour to correct for altitude, and they turned out well.

I just made these muffins this evening and found them to be very bland. They were nothing like what I would expect a blueberry muffin to taste like. The muffins seemed more like cake-like, but again very bland. Will not make again.

If it did not come out right, you didn't do it right. Don't blame the recipe. I have made HUNDREDS of muffins before and I always use 1 cup of buttermilk, a little bit more sugar, tad bit more blueberries, and butter instead of oil. Makes the batter yummy without even baking it. With the mixing; I mix until the batter is smooth and creamy. I don't think little mixing makes that much of a difference. Either way, this recipe has just the right measurements.

Took others advice of doubling sugar and blueberries.  Muffin was bland and tasted of egg.  I've made a LOT of muffins in my day, and this is one I will definitely NOT make again.

I really like this recipe.  I have a family member who is diabetic so I substituted 1 cup of Splenda for the sugar (I added 1/2 cup to make it sweeter instead of the required 1/2 cup)...these turned out PERFECT!!!  I also used large muffin tins (made 7 large muffins), but with substituting splenda the calorie count is still pretty low :-)

I added more blueberries and sprinkled sugar on the tops of the muffins.  It tasted good but they stuck to the paper.  Next time I would spray the pan with non-stick spray.  My 1 year old ate them too.

I added extra sugar and blueberries as well as a teaspoon of salt, and they were still were too bland- they tasted too much like flour.

I really love this recipe. I've used it a couple of times now, and it works great. Everyone loves my muffins. The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar. I put in a litte more, but I guess that's personal taste!

Before making this recipe, definitely read the reviews. This is not meant to be a really sweet muffin. It does turn out well though a little dry.

YUM! This recipe is wonderful! But it's better if you add extra blueberries to them.

These were very good.  I used whole wheat flour and so I needed to add a splash more milk, also I used about a full cup of blueberries.  I can see how people might feel that these were bland but in reality they were just not overwhelmingly sweet, letting the sweetness come from the whole wheat and the berries themselves.

I finally found easy and tasty home made blueberry muffins!  Just the right amount of sweet, and the texture was wonderful.  Even though it says to serve hot, they are still very tasty the next day.  I added a splash of vanilla extract and a cinnamon/sugar topping as well.  I will definately make these again!

These did not turn out well at all despite attempts to improve.  I added vanilla extract, a bit more sugar, more blueberries- they still tanked.

Easy to make, but these muffins were flavorless.  They tasted like bland pancakes.  I'm not likely to make these again.

I made these and turned out awesome. But....I added a 1/2 tsp salt, a tsp of vanilla extract, and extra blueberries, and for added sweetness I added a tbsp of honey.

I used the amount of blueberries it said to use but I do not think it is enough. The only bites that tasted good was the bites with blueberries in it, beside that they just seem to have no taste so I am going to add more blueberries next time to see if that improves the taste.

Super easy and fast!  This was the second time I made these and I felt it needed a little added sweetness without adding extra sugar so I added 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and it did the trick!

These were pretty disappointing.Very dense and not very sweet, tasted more like a biscuit. The only thing I did different is add a bit of lemon zest to the batter. Once I realized how bland they were I topped with lemon glaze but they were still 'meh'

Not overly impressed....   thankfully I’m cooking for toddlers so the lack of flavor isn’t such a bad thing.  These are very bland and just taste like flour.

I used wholemeal flour and they still came out beautifully light and very tasty.  The frozen berries I used were a little sour, so next time I'll add a little sugar to them before adding those in.  I also added a tiny bit of vanilla extract.

Heavy and tasteless when following exact recipe. After reading other reviews I would try doubling sugar and blueberries as many reviews recommend. You will notice all 5 star reviews changed the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, other than adding a bit of grainy sugar to the tops.  These muffins look great, but I find them very bland.  Additional sugar needed plus a dose of vanilla.

These were easy but not very sweet. I probably wouldn't make them again or I would adapt the recipe.

I doubled the recipe. Added twice the berries, I wish I added more sugar. The muffins were quite bland.

It was good. I made it more blueberry by topping it with a blueberry compote.  It was a hit with everyone who tried it.

This was my first time making muffins, and they were great. They are very quick to make and so simple. the only change I made was adding extra blueberries to the batter.

These muffins are delicious! I made half the batch with chocolate chips and the other half with blueberries. Next time I will add cinnamon to both of them, sour cream to the blueberry ones, and vanilla to the chocolate ones.

Very tasty! At only being 10, i still did make some changes. Add 3/4 cup blueberries or 1 cup blueberries. I am making it today- again! These are very good and add an extra egg yolk for fluffiness! keep calm and BAKE ON!

Very easy to make! I used chocolate chips instead of blueberries since that was the only thing I had in my house! I tweaked it a bit and added 1 cup sugar instead of a half a cup, 1 cup chocolate chips, and a teaspoon of vanilla in it! Very delicious!

I followed the suggestion for increasing the sugar and used a cup and a quarter of blueberries. My four muffin eaters loved them and commented that the results were better than store bought or packaged muffins.

I sifted the flour once, used cranberries, 1- 1/2teaspoon baking soda because I had expired baking powder. I mixed the batter until it was smooth and easy scoop (no longer thick). I baked at 350 with dark metal or aluminum!  Turned out delicious and beautiful!  You could use almost any fruit you wish.  This is a basic recipe for muffins that allows you customize. Thank you soo much!

I made these today and decided that they would be pancake muffins rather than straight up muffins.  It doesn't have a muffin-like texture and isn't incredibly sweet, but it does taste pretty good.

I followed this recipe but added 1 cup of mixed berries (frozen, then thawed) and the muffins turned out great! They don't taste too sweet which makes it a great addition as a breakfast snack.

I doubled the blueberries, and added 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp salt as suggested.  I did not overmix, or overbake.  Still, these muffins are completely bland, I'd rather just buy a boxed muffin mix from the grocery store.

I liked these becasue they were a dry muffin, not cakey. THey baked beautifully, very pretty when done but the muffin is a vehicle to show off the berry. Do not expect an amazing taste, but rather a drier and less sweet muffin, perfect served with butter. Because it is dry and less sweet we all enjoyed it very much. I used baby kiwin instead of blueberries. I am guessign that raspberries would be fantastic!

These were okay. They certainly weren't bad, but I feel they need a little tweaking in order to make them *really* good. I made them just as written and you could taste the baking powder a little too much... I'm not sure if they need less baking powder, or more sugar...

I thought these muffins were good.  I'm giving it 4 stars because I did not  completely follow the recipe as written.  I substituted almond milk for cows milk, added 3 tsp of organic vanana yogurt, and I used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  I thought they were great.  They rose nicely and were extremely moist.

It may have something to do with the fact that I put my berries in a blender first, but I found the muffins to be dense. I prefer my muffins fluffier.

I don't like over-sugary muffins but this was very very bland. I had even added a few extra blueberries and heaped the sugar. The one positive I will give the recipe is that it did rise well enough, as long as I hand mixed it and didn't over mix it.

I tried this recipe, needs more sugar! Try a cup of sugar instead of 1/2 cup. And I also added 1 cup of blueberries. They were OK.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used Canola oil. Served hot with butter. Great muffins that are about as easy to make as muffins can be. This recipe should work with most any other berry.

This recipe was actually quite bland, it wasn't unberable but it wasn't a joy to eat. I would put more sugar depending on how sugary you want it to be, and way more blueberrys!!!!!!!!!!!

Simple and easy. The muffins are OK - nothing extraordinary but OK. I would make these again. I did mix brown and white sugar together and uses more blueberries than it called for.

These muffins weren't really muffin-like to me.  They are not very sweet and they have more of a biscuit/corn muffin texture than a muffin.  They are okay, but not what I was looking for.

This recipe was easy to make.  I added extra blueberries, probably about 1/2 cup, and used Splenda baking mix (about 1/4 cup) and they turned out very nice.

Recipe was kind of bland. Others were right, more sugar is needed. I chose not to add more  sugar because as Asians, my parents do not like their baked goods to be too sweet. But definitely need to add a little more sugar. Doubled the blueberry as suggested. I'm not an expert or anything, but I wonder if the recipe was bland because salt was not added. The top was kind of crunchy, which I liked. (I had to bake it for 40 minutes because the top was really pale after 20 mins.) I'm going to try the recipe again and add salt to it.

They were very good and light on the sugar.  My daughter even liked them without all the sugar of most muffins.  They are definitely better when they are warm.

I took the advice of some of the earlier reviewers and I increased the sugar to 2/3 cup. I found this to be too sweet so next time I think I'll stick to the original recipe. I also added an extra 1/2 cup of blueberries which I think really added to the flavor. Overall these were OK muffins but I've had better. I'm still trying to find a recipe that is similar to the muffins that are made at the restaurant Sweet Tomatoes.

Very good. The consistency was excellent.
I did a variation of the recipe.
Used 1 cup of Post Cranberry cereal, less 1/2 cup flour and sugar reduced to 1/4 cup.
Sprinkle a bit or cereal and white sugar on top before baking. The aroma is to die for.

Added extra sugar, a whole pint of blueberries, baked in large muffin pan (6 muffins,)sprinkled top with Florida Crystals (sugar) after removing from pan, baked for 28-29 minutes.  They came out super! Thank you, Sylvia.
