I made this for Christmas dinner and it was very well received.  I made a 20 rib roast and I did double the stuffing, because our family loves stuffing.  I had a decent amount left over.  I also added pine nuts(instead of chestnuts) and apples to the stuffing.  It was great!!  I took about 3.5 hours to cook and the house smelled great!.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is my first time making crown roast pork and it came out delish!  The stuffing on the other hand....well I'm not sure as it was a bit dry.  Maybe next time I will use dry "cubes" instead of the crumbs as it was a bit crumbly.  Other than that great meal!  Thanks Marc.

Wow! I'm just a husband but I spent all day making this. I only changed it by substituting onion salt for real onion (onion allergy) and deleting the chestnuts (nut allergy). I was so proud of this meal. It looked so delicious, smelled as good as it looked, and the taste was the best. Thank you. It was a great cooking experience for me.

Prepared this recipe for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.  Hardest part was finding the steamed chestnuts, so I used roasted chestnuts in a jar that I found at a specialty market.  Also couldn't find the frilly "panties", but cherry tomatoes worked pretty well to finish dressing it.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a fantastic dish.  I cooked a 6 lb crown and I had to bake mine an extra 15-20 minutes and my oven usually runs a little hot.  Also, there really were no drippings to speak of but it was still very moist and tender.  A definite do again.

Excellent recipe -- thank you so much.  This is the "Prime Rib of Pork"  YUMMY!!!  I think I screwed up the stuffing because mine came really sticky, but it was still very tasty.  Very much a keeper!!!

Absolutely Amazing!!  Just sat down after everyone left and had to write a review.  Thank you first of all foe the recipe.  I made an 18 rib roast, cooked it for 1 1/2 hours then stuffed it and covered the stuffing as directed.  I cooked it for 1 hour and then removed it from the pan and placed it on a cutting board wrapped in tinfoil for about 20-25 mins. I then poured the broth and vermouth reduction into the roasting pan and put the bacon and flour in it. I poured it through a strainer to prevent lumps.  The roast was so moist aand the gravy was delicious.  I did not use chestnuts in the stuffing not a big fan.  The stuffing was delicious.  Moist and flavorful!!  Thanks again.

Very juicy and tasty. I did make a few changes. I seasoned the outside of the crown with some Ms. Dash,used white wine instead of vermouth, and used 2.25 oz dry pine nuts, which I roasted, instead of the ones called for in the recipe. This is now replacing our traditional Christmas dinner! 12/2016 made a smaller version and tried different seasonings and a different stuffing since I had to do that outside the crown because of the size, basically the same gravy minus the vermouth. Still totally yummy! Took about 2 1/2 hours to cook and rest.

This was my first time with this stuffing and it was great! The gravy was nice and tangy! I made this for 14 people for Easter today. I would not stuff the roast again, it was very pink still where I put the stuffing. I did have to put the rest of the stuffing in a casserole dish(too much to fit in the roast. Very good meal. Thank you for posting it! :)

RECIPE VERY HARD TO FOLLOW. STUFFING WOULD BE BETTER WITH BREAD CUBES RATHER THAN BREAD CRUMBS. THE GRAVY WAS AWESOME. EACH CHOP WAS ABOUT ONE POUND SO PURCHASE ONLY ONE CHOP PER PERSON.

This was the first time I'd ever made a crown roast and it turned out pretty good. I made my own bread cubes and I'm glad I did - I think it would have been really mushy using bread crumbs! I omitted the chestnuts due to a nut allergy and think, after tasting it, it would have been better with white wine instead of vermouth. It was very tasty, but I felt that the roast should have been seasoned with something prior to cooking...I will make this again but with the few changes I've listed. Thanks for sharing!

The crown roast turned out delicious.  We made the stuffing separate from the roast and found that it was a bit dry (I'd probably make a different stuffing next time), but the gravy was so yummy it helped make the stuffing tolerable.  Perhaps the stuffing would be better in the roast (maybe that's why they call it stuffing :)

This was fabulous.  We had it for Christmas dinner this year.  I used bread cubes for the stuffing.  The sauce/gravy is awsome.  Make extra, my family wanted the gravy on everything!

My husband and I made this for Christmas 15 years ago. We made it today and it looks fabulous.  Let's hope it tastes as good as it looks. We also replaced the chestnuts with pine nuts and had to double the meat to make it round instead of a strip.  The house smells devine.

I first made this recipe about 10 years ago for my kids for Christmas, it was my first year being divorced. I hadn't made it again until 2 years ago, I had a decent sized fancy sit down Christmas party for friends. I made this again the same way as the first time. I actually stuff the pork then baked it (takes quite a bit longer but so worth it). I had hot, herbed chicken stock on the stove and I basted the pork and the stuffing throughout to keep it moist. All I can say, is this is one of the most delicious special dinners I've ever made and probably the best I've ever had, anywhere. This beats beef tenderloin any day. It's so flavorful. I took the additional stuffing (and there was a lot) and mounded it into muffin cups (I basked for about 1/2 hour). My kids and my guests LOVE it like that. The best stuffing comes from inside the pork, all the cooking juice flavors it, but the muffins are a a great runner up. I made this with honey ginger carrots and a lemon zest/roasted garlic green beans.  Both are beautiful sides.

I'm making this again this year for a Christmas dinner for 8, I ordered a 14 rib roast.  My husband can't wait!
