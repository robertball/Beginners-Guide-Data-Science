I tripled this recipe, using 3 ounces of shredded kombu (kelp), instead of the 4 inch pieces called for, and over 2 ounces of bonito flakes (so, I used proportionally more of each ingredient than the recipe called for).  I followed the method exactly.  It was pretty bland.  I added fish balls and cooked rice noodles to make a nice soup, but wanted more from the broth.  I don't know if it needed to steep longer, or if I needed more of the kombu and bonito, but it definitely needed more of something.  However, this is much better than my amateur attempts at bonito broth in the past, so it has put me on the right track.
