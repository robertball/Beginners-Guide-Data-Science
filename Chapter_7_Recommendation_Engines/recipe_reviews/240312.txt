Flavor was great held. Kids loved the taste and the shapes held well. I used self rising flour and cooked my cookies for 8 minutes.

I like the flavor of these cookies more than other sugar cookie recipes I've tried.  The dough right out of the refrigerator was hard to work with but it softened up pretty quick.  I put the dough back into the refrigerator for awhile to firm it up again.

This is my all-time favorite cut-out sugar cookie recipe.  I have used it many times. It is more of a short bread (no leavening agent), so dough must be thoroughly chilled in order to not spread too much. The almond flavor canâ€™t be beat!

Good flavor, poor texture.
