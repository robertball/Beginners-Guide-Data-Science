First time making this, the only change I made was to change the egg amount to 1 whole egg and plus one egg yolk in order to add color and richness.   The basic recipe was great, though next time I will decrease the sugar (slightly too sweet for my taste) and not add cinnamon and nutmeg into the pudding, but instead use the spices to sprinkle over the tops of individual servings to cater to everyone's taste. One COULD safely forgo the egg altogether and you would have a somewhat thinner and less yellow custardy appearance to it. If doing so, add the entire 1.5 cups of milk at the beginning.
