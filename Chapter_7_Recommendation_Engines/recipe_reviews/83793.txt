As the creator of this recipe, it is very important to note that this recipe calls for low sodium soy sauce.  Don't even bother attempting this if you are using regular soy sauce, it will be too salty.  Update 7/2/08: I do not recommend making this recipe on the stove top.  The marinade can't cook off enough when trapped in a skillet...stick to the grill!

Excellent flavor.  I made this on Friday during a snow storm and rather than grill outside (hee-hee), I marinated the chicken for 2 hours, then added everything, marinade and all, to a baking dish, covered with aluminum foil and baked in a preheated 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.  Half-way through I used a turkey baster to coat chicken and prevent from drying.  After 30 minutes, I removed foil for 5 minutes to crisp top.  It came out perfect. Thank you!

Very nice recipe with great flavor.  Made the first time and it was wonderful.  Made it the second time with fresh squeezed orange juice as I was out of lemon juice.  Even better!!!

This marinade is awesome!!! I made a few substitutions and it just couldn't have been better!! Subbed Dijon for Spicy brown mustard, and for the liquid smoke, I used about a Tbsp of Kitchen Bouquet and added a packet of Goya Ham Flavored Seasoning. I allowed the chicken to marinate for about 3-4 hours then grilled/smoked them on a charcoal grill.  Absolutely THE best chicken we have ever eaten!! It wasn't salty at all and I even used regular Soy Sauce. I fixed this for my husband and had the chicken ready when he got home. The chicken was grilled and carmel colored and we're fixing it again for the 4th!! Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

Nice blend of flavors. This will become a regular in our house. I did marinate the chicken for over 6 hours and did not find that the lemon started to cook the chicken.  I use many marinades that take 24 hours and contain lemon and have never had any adverse effect on the meat. Thanks TaraNicole!

Great Marinade!  I followed the recipe exactly even though I was half tempted to substitute dijon mustard for the spicy brown.  I'm glad I didn't. The liquid smoke is a nice addition. I also pounded the chicken down thin and let it marinate all day.  I'm not sure why there's a four hour time limit here.  I had no problems.  It was delicious!

Liquid Smoke is found on the same shelf as any steak marinade.  It gives marinades that smoky flavor you get when grilling with wood.  It's potent, so a little goes a long way.  Right after placing the chicken on the grill, cover with lid. Will help seal that smoky taste into the meat and also helps cook the chicken through without drying out the meat.

I used bone-in breasts and drumsticks.  I substituted Dijon for the spicy brown mustard and in addition to all the other ingredients I added about 2 tablespoons of chili garlic sauce (asian food aisle).  The result was amazing.  The taste of the marinade really soaks into the chicken and gives it a nice caramel color after grilling.  Will make often.  Thanks for this one.

This was a hit on Father's Day. I skewered boneless skinless chicken tenderloins and threw them on the grill! I was worried that they were going to taste to strong because of the golden brown color but they were great! Not too salty and the liquid smoke was a great touch!

DH and I LOVED this marinade recipe!  It has just the right flavors...and I followed the recipe to a "T"!  I cooked the chicken on the grill until it was 165 F internal on my stem thermometer... moist, JUICY, full of flavor and perfectly cooked through.  (BTW, the ONLY reason that chicken, esp. breasts are DRY is because they are OVERCOOKED.)  DH commented several times during dinner how much he liked the flavor of this chicken!
I used regular old Kikkoman soy sauce and it was just fine...   I served this with my own published recipe "Mediterranean Bean Salad" and it was a perfect combination!  Thanks for the recipe!

Everytime I stock up on sale chicken to freeze, I freeze the boneless skinless breasts in this marinade.  I pull them out Fri night for our Sunday BBQ and let them thaw in the fridge right in the marinade.  Everyone who tastes this calls it Restaurant Chicken, which is funny b/c I saw another reviewer say the same thing.  It is, without a doubt, the best marinade for chicken, and we are SERIOUS grillers.  The amounts called for work for about 8 breasts in a large freezer bag.  I always whip up an additional half batch of the marinade for dipping.

Very, very nice marinade and love the use of liquid smoke! Used regular soy sauce and wasn't too salty at all and fresh minced garlic, yum. Can't help but wonder why you shouldn't marinate for more than four hours (I marnated mine for almost 24 hours and it was great)? If your thoughts were because of the lemon juice, well, citrus won't 'cook the chicken' but over marinating fish with citrus based marinades will and there are actually even recipes that use citrusy/acid based marinades to cook the fish rather than using heat methods. For those who say their chicken was dry it's because it was over cooked and/or grilled without the lid on.

I used this to marinate chicken breasts for about 7 hours before grilling. They were so juicy and tasted great! I cut down the soy sauce just a little and thought it was perfect. Will definitely use this again.

Great recipe!  I used regular soy sauce instead of low-sodium (it was all I had on hand) and honey dijon mustard instead of spicy dijon.  A great presentation, beautiful color and so juicy.  I served this dish with spicy roasted broccoli, lentil rice and cheesy garlic bread and my family gobbled up every bite.  Thanks Tara!

Delicious marinade.  I used this on pork chops and they turned out amazing. One little tip to conserve ingredients: by halving the recipe, you'll still get about a cup of marinade, which is plenty for 4 chicken breasts.

I love this marinade! I was looking for something to use my liquid smoke on. This was a huge hit. I used a tablespoon of minced garlic instead of garlic powder. And I marinated it for a day. The lemon juice doesn't cook the chicken, it breaks down the protein so the flavor can get in. But don't marinade for over 2 days, it will make the chicken tough. I will use this marinade often. Thanks TaraNicole!

I never thought I'd find find such a different recipe after cooking for many, many years. It really is delicious and easy to make. I do cut down on the oil and liquid smoke. I use half of what's called for just because it seemed like too much to me. It might be even better with full amounts but I like it the way I make it.  I've gotten rave reviews from picky eaters including my 4 YO grandson and my 88 YO mother. Thanks so much for a great, original recipe!

This is so good! I've tried several marinades, but this is at the top of my list.   I keep a big jar in the fridge.  To make meals convenient during a busy week, I'll marinade some lean beef,  pork, and chicken overnight.  Then it is grilled and sliced to use during the week in recipes or salads.  (This also helps us cut down on eating out as much and helps to control  the fat and salt).  Thanks for this recipe!

Followed it to a T, but it made the chicken tough, it was too salty and just not very good in our opinion.  We won't make this again.

Excellent recipe.  I've tried quite a few chicken marinades, this one earns five stars.  I used three large boneless skinless breasts and three thighs, the recipe makes quite a bit of marinade so you could probably cut it in half if you only have three breasts - I use a ziploc bag to marinade in.  I marinaded for about 5-6 hours.  Next time I'm going to try cutting the breasts in half lengthwise so there's more marinade flavor; the outside carmelized marinade part of the grilled chicken was the best part!  This would also be great on pounded breasts used for chicken sandwiches on a bun w/mayo, tomato, etc.

This marinade is amazing. I used lime instead of lemon (don't care for lemon) and cut the liquid smoke down to 1 Tbsp. (personal preference). I marinated 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts for about 4 hours, and they were AMAZING on the grill ... we ate two, and I am going to chop the third tonight and use it on homemade pizza. Try it! Thanks!

I would give this 6 stars if I could - it was THAT good! Was looking for something to mimic the grilled chicken sandwich I always order at The Rock. This was so close. Didn't change a thing other than to pound the 2 breasts thin and cut them into 4 pieces. Looking forward to leftovers for lunch this week! A definite addition to our rotation.

Great flavor and very easy to put together in a hurry.  I used worsteshire sauce in place of liquid smoke (as I had none) and I think it was a nice substitute, also used low sodium soy sauce.

I made this today, being a little apprehensive with the sheer amounts of soy sauce and liquid smoke. However, hubby & I absolutely loved our chicken!!! 

I think this will go well on any meat-pork, chicken, fish, even beef! The only think I did different was use horseradish mustard. We marinated it for 5 hours and it could have gone even overnight. We'll definitely be using this recipe A LOT!!! Thank you for the recipe!

Killer stuff!  Yes, it is salty (even with the low sodium soy sauce), so I wouldn't recommend pounding or thinning your chicken breast.  We used nice plump breasts which minimized the saltiness.  Looked gorgeous, tasted great - will be my go-to marinade for chicken.  Thanks so much for recipe!  Oops - forgot to mention I halved recipe and had enough 3 large breasts.  Served with broccoli rice medley and peas.

WOW!!!!! Picky husband LOVED this chicken! Chopped up the breasts & served over grilled romaine lettuce halves with diced tomato, onion, red bell pepper, pepperocini, bacon bits, cheddar & a drizzle of ranch dressing. Chicken is good enough to serve any way you like though!!!

This is my go-to marinade- such wonderful flavor! And not just for chicken- we've used it with steaks and other meats as well.  We have always used regular soy sauce (maybe if your chicken breasts are super thin or if you are sensitive to the taste of salt would the sodium content be an issue for you) Plus we have marinated it anywhere from 1 to 9 hours.  Always way more yummy the longer you marinated it.    I'm thinking maybe the percent of lemon juice in the marinade is not enough to begin "cooking" the  chicken as some reviews have said. I asked my friend who is a prof. chef about that and she said it is really fish and seafood that is more of an issue with watching acid in the marinade and length of time.  Granted, leaving the raw chicken in the marinade for days is probably not the best either ;).  Just my thoughts.  Do whatever you think is best...just know this recipe is a keeper!!

Very tasty! I substituted minced garlic for the garlic powder and also added some dried herbs (basil & oregano). Delish! Will definitely use this again.

I broke a cardinal rule with this recipe.  I made this recipe for the first time for a function with no trial at home first.  My work was having a "family reunion" cookout, and I was in charge of the food.  I let the chicken marinate for 4-5 hours, then grilled.  The chicken was eaten more than the brats!  Took leftovers home and shredded, added to some sauteed onions and garlic, mixed with bbq sauce, and put in crock pot for shredded bbq chicken for Monday Night Football.  Awesome!

The liquid smoke will trick you into thinking this was grilled.  We did our in the slow cooker, if memory serves me.

This was a really good marinade. Liquid Smoke is weird to me so I never buy it. We didn't miss it. We use a charcoal grill with some pecan wood, so we get the smoky flavor there. Thanks!

Awesome recipe - used regular vegetable oil vs. olive oil due to cost.  I made it for a graduation party and people raved about how moist and flavorful the chicken tasted.  I put between 6-8 chicken breasts in each of the four zip loc bags to feed the gang of people.  I then doubled the recipe and divided the marinade between the four bags.  It was more than enough marinade.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This was a big winner with DH who doesn't really like to eat chicken. I used 1 oz. of lemon juice instead of 2 ozs. (1/4 cup). I didn't have liquid smoke so used browning & seasoning sauce instead and regular mustard in place of the spicy mustard. I grilled them in the George Foreman grill for about 5 minutes & they were tender, juicy & full of taste.

Awesome marinade...I only used a tsp. of liquid smoke flavoring, I find that can be overwhelming, and I added a tsp. of onion powder...it was amazing for center cut pork tenderloin chops!

I used Grey Poupon mustard, 1/2 tsp black pepper, and 1 tsp garlic powder because I was serving this to guest with children and was concerned it may be too spicy. It was a tremendous hit!!! All loved it. It was quick and easy...and addicting. I highly recommend this marinade. Think it would be good on pork tenderloin as well.

My 11-year-old daughter made this marinade while I was at work, and we poured it over the chicken breast before we left for soccer practice.  Two and a half hours later, it was ready for the grill.  This was so easy and yielded tender, juicy, and flavorful chicken.  The spices were just right.  I didn't use the liquid smoke.  This is one for the recipe box!

WOW!  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.  I didn't have low-sodium soy sauce, so I used regular soy sauce and halved the quantity from 2/3 cup to 1/3 cup.  I have put low-sodium soy sauce on my grocery list, though, to keep on hand just for this recipe.  I didn't have spicy brown mustard so I used dijon.  This recipe actually made a little more marinade than I really needed for 3 breast halves (that's what always comes in a package in this part of the country), so I may make a little less next time.  This is the first time I have ever used liquid smoke.  I'm a fan!

So easy and delicious.  Family couldn't stop talking about how good and juicy it was.  The Liquid Smoke was just the right touch to give it a great smokey flavor!  I will be using a touch of liquid smoke in other marinades!

Pretty Chicken Marinade Haiku: "Oh yes, it's pretty. But the flavor is heaven. Deep, divine, and /drool."  I make this marinade weekly and cook the chicken in a med-heat pan, or occasionally on the George Foreman. I've found that 3-4 chicken breasts are fine with the marinade recipe halved. I skip the liquid smoke unless I'm grilling. The ingredients' ratio freaked me out the 1st time I made it, but I'm a believer in the wonderfulness that is Pretty Chicken now.

I used low sodium soy sauce but the chicken was much too salty for our taste. I used frozen boneless skinless chicken breast that may have been infused with salt which caused the problem.  Will use only fresh breasts next time.

Wow!!  My husband is sweet but a pretty tough critic.  He rates things out of 10 points, and after 14 years of cooking for him, we've only had one "10".  Until this recipe!  He interspersed the word 10 between every bite.  I didn't change anything, but I made SURE that I used low-sodium soy sauce.  This is the recipe!!!!!  (I only had time to marinate for 1.5 hours, and used the foreman grill for 6 minutes.  Amazing!!)

Easy marinade resulting in a nice flavorful chicken breast.  I like that the marinating time is only 4 hrs. as I seldom think so far ahead to marinate overnight or for a LONG time as many marinades suggest.  "Pretty" is subjective.  I wouldn't exactly call the chicken Pretty, but definitely tasty!

This was a pretty tasty marinade, unfortunately I didn't have any Tamari so I cut down on the soy a little.  The four stars are because it's way too much oil even for marinading in, and the smoke flavour was very dominant over all the other flavours.  The chicken did come out really juicy though.

This is ultimately THE BEST recipe!  I only made a couple of changes.  I had to increase the servings to six, which with this wonderful site made all the adjustment to the ingredients needed.  I mixed the marinade; put the chicks in to absorb the numminess, which was for 5 hours.  Grilled them as suggested, BUT made a small batch of the marinade to baste, adding a little raw sugar and a tablespoon of Annie's original BBQ sauce and basted it frequently for the last few minutes...AMAZING!  This was the moistest and tender piece of skinless/boneless chicken breast I have ever tasted.   Everyone at the table was making "Mmmmm" sounds with every bite.  I made some garlic mashed red taters with the skins on and some sweet corn, Along with a salad and bread.  It is a sure thing recipe...Thank you Tara Nicole for sharing!

This was a great marinade!

I used it on four boneless/skinless chicken breasts (from Costco, so quite large). I halved the liquid smoke and I was out of garlic powder so did 1 tsp of garlic SALT instead and slightly less than the 2/3C of reduced sodium soy sauce just in case of sodium overload. But it turned out great! I marinated overnight and grilled them up the next evening. 

The chicken was moist, tender, and flavorful. Everyone loved it!

This is fabulous. I used a mix of boneless/skineless thighs and breasts. Marinaded them for about 1.5 hours and then grilled them. Delicious!

I was excited about this, and it definitely looked pretty once it came off the grill, but it was super dry and had no flavor.  I marinated it for 3 hours and followed the recipe to a T.  Just didn't work for me.

Just so you know, I'm going to be one of those horrible people that rate a recipe that I've made a lot of changes to!  I just think this is a  recipe that you can  play around with a lot.  First I halved the recipe as I was using 3 boneless breasts. I used lime juice instead of lemon, fresh minced garlic instead of powder, 1 T paprika instead of liquid smoke and threw in 2 T brown sugar. I pounded my chicken to uniform thickness and marinated for 5 hours. Only had to cook about 5 minutes each side, I guess because my pieces were thinner. It was sooooo good!  Would like to try using orange juice next time as suggested by someone else.

This was seriously soooo good.  I used half low sodium and half regular soy sauce because i ran out of low and it was still great (I like salty food though)  My boyfriend came over hours later and he had one and couldn't believe how good they were.  I used tenders, becuase that's my preference and they were beautiful!  I highly recommend this recipe!

This is an excellent marinade! My husband loves chicken but particular about how it is prepared. He has asked me to make this at least once a week. Easy to prepare and my kids love it as well! It is excellent left over in a sandwich for his lunches!

Delicious! So easy to make. I just used 1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce (not a big fan of sodium), substituted orange juice for the lemon juice, and marinaded for two hours. Followed everything else accordingly though and it came out so flavorful! Slapped it on the grill and continuously brushed with the excess marinade until fully cooked. :) We had none left on our plates! Thanks for this awesome marinade recipe! Will definitely be using again.

I made this and the family loved it.  I was nervous to put 2 tbsp of liquid smoke and I only put 1tbsp.  Next time I will increase it a little and see.  It was juicy, tender and deff not overgrilled.  When you overgrill it gets tough.  Thanks for this one...  Oh and so easy.

This is great.  I have done it on the grill - indirect and I was wonderful.  I have also marinated the chicken and then roasted it, also great.  Here is a tip, take a whole chicken and cut down the back bone - splay the chicken flat - makes marinating a whole chicken very easy!

This is the first time I've taken the time to review a recipe.  All I need to say is Mmmmmm!  I have a very picky husband who seldom raves over anything I make.  He absolutely loves this marinade.  This recipe is a keeper.  I can't wait to try it on pork chops too :)

This is now my go-to recipe for grilled chicken. It is a must try--don't change a thing.  We marinated thin cut chicken breasts and it grilled so quickly!  It was the hit of our Mothers' Day party.  We served this with a green salad, corn on the cob, chili beans, hot dogs for the kids, and a homemade fresh fruit shortcake dessert. This recipe allowed my sister and me to serve a large group a really spectacular meal on a budget. And I have made it a few times since just for the family. Add this one to your permanent collection!

My picky husband and hard-to-please autistic 5-year-old asked for seconds, so this will definitely be a keeper for us.  I made it exactly as written except I left out the liquid smoke because I don't like that taste.  Also juiced a lemon instead of using store bought lemon juice.  Looks as good as it tastes.

My husband loves this!  He asks for Pretty Chicken all the time :)  I do add less of the liquid smoke - 2 tablespoons was overpowering.  I also throw in some minced garlic.  I have left this overnight each time and it's come out fine. I use the leftovers from this to make the Buffalo Chicken Dip from this site.  Edit: 12/13/2010 I no longer add the liquid smoke, and I ran out of spicy brown mustard and just use regular, along with vegetable oil and minced garlic and it comes out great every single time.  I just dump all of the ingredients in a bag and let it sit overnight and cook it the next day in my cast iron skillet.

Was very good. Could have used a tad less soy sauce and a tad more liquid smoke, but was still very solid. I baked the chicken for 30 minutes at 350 instead of grilling it.

This was so delicious!  I'm not a chicken fan, but my husband loves chicken so I'm always on the lookout for something we can both enjoy.  This recipe is definitely a hit!  I put one large frozen boneless chicken breast in a tupperware container with the marinade and let it defrost - longer than the prescribed time because I had to push back my dinner plans one day.  I don't know if the lemon juice began to cook the chicken or not, and I BBQ'ed it on the grill the regular way.  It was so moist and juicy!  We both loved it.  (It's also a bonus that the ingredients to the marinade are things that I keep in the house anyway, so I can whip it up at the last minute if need be.)

Pretty good- but too salty. And YES I always use low sodium soy sauce! Maybe there is a lot of sodium in the liquid smoke- I'll check it out. I would also recommend halving the marinade ing. unless you are using a lot of chicken.

This recipe was excellent.  Even my husband who isn't a huge chicken fan really enjoyed it.  He said this recipe was a keeper.  The flavor was great, and the chicken stayed nice and juicy when cooked on the grill over medium heat for 6 minutes per side.  I was concerned that it would taste too much like soy sauce, but none of the ingredients overpowered the taste.  All of the flavors blended together nicely.  I have made this for a large family bbq and everyone wanted the recipe.  I have also made this chicken and used it for fajitas.  I forgot to buy lemons so used some bottled key lime juice I had on hand.  Just grilled the chicken as usual then sliced thin afterwards and mixed with sauteed onions and red and green bell peppers.  It made for some really great and flavorful fajitas!

First, I must say this makes a LOT of marinade because rather than the chicken breasts called for, I used 10-12 boneless thighs and there was plenty.  Second, I would reduce the liquid smoke by half (1 Tbs.) because 2 Tbs. is over-powering--especially if using charcoal briquets.  Dijon mustard works well if you don't have spicy brown mustard.  All in all, we did like this and will make again.

Amazing!  Used fresh garlic and Bragg's Liquid Amino instead of soy sauce. I marinated for 2 hours because that's all the time I had. We grilled the chicken. This will be a staple seasoning for us.

This was awesome i loved the smokey flavor... i could really taste it though out the whole piece of chicken. I followed the recipe exactly, but with all the great reviews maybe i was expecting more. Everyone else seemed to love it tho, all and all will definitely make it again thanks for posting this.

WOW!!!!  My husband, son and I loved this chicken!  I made sure the chicken breasts were of even thickness by pounding them between plastic wrap. They were marinated for about 27 hours because of a change in dinner plans.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.  I plan on making this for our family Fourth of July meal.

This chicken turned out a little bland. It was too salty and the smoke flavor was a bit fake. The flavor of the other marinade ingredients was lost in the smoky/salty flavor. The color of the chicken was exceptional, though, as it turned a golden brown. Overall not bad, but nothing to rave about.

This is outstanding.  The only thing I didn't add was the liquid smoke.

This chicken has great flavor and has a nice caramelized brown color.  I always make more than one meals worth and use the left overs for tacos, enchiladas, etc.

I ended up not being able to use my grill for this recipe, so I just baked the chicken after a couple of hours or marinating.  It was delicious and I imagine that the grilled variety is even better!  My kids and husband gobbled this up, making it a big hit for our family!

Oh TaraNicole....I'm in LOVE with this recipe! I cook often, mostly chicken meals and this must be 1 of the most favorite chicken maridanes I've ever tried. I really thought that there's a typo in the recipe (2 t black pepper) but after reading many reviews, I made it like written, except for olive oil and soy sauce (used 1/3 C each...plenty!). Wau, even my 2 and 4 year old kids said that chicken was very yummy tonight. I let it marinade for 3 hours and cooked in a 350F bbq...wauzers! Thank you!!!

Loved this recipe.  The only thing we didn't love was the mess it makes in the grill.  BUT, hubby had to clean the grill anyway and he says this is a keeper recipe, too.  We will be using this recipe often especially during summer months.  Thanks for sharing.

Used this as a marinade for pork kabobs. This was fabulous.  Put cut meat and marinade into zip-bag and left in the fridge for 2 days.  Did not use liquid smoke, as we don't care for it, and the meat was so tender!!  REALLY yummy stuff, and cheaper than the store bought salad dressing I used to use.  Thanks for the recipe.

Wow!  This will be my "go to" chicken marinade.  The chicken had a fantastic flavor and a nice brown color.  I used regular soy sauce and while I could taste the salt, it didn't seem overly salty.

I made this with regular soy sauce and Dijon mustard. I also marinated my chicken for over 8 hours. The result was delicious - some of the tenderest, juiciest chicken I've ever had. I didn't find it overly salty. It may actually depend on the BRAND of soy sauce you are using. This recipe will definitely stay on my "chicken list". Thanks!

I used my foodsaver vacuum sealer to cut down the marinde time (one hour) and then grilled the chicken, it was soo flavorfull and moist. Note: If you have a food vacuum sealer, us it and marinade for 1 hour,takes all the air out of canister and infuses the meat with the marinade.

Hi amy1212, liquid smoke is a thin brown sauce that adds a smoky taste to food. You might be able to find it in the condiments section of your supermarket, near the BBQ sauce or maybe in the spice section near the BBQ seasonings. Good luck!

This is my new favorite chicken marinade.  I only used a splash of liquid smoke, since we were going to grill the chicken anyway.  Leftovers are great on salad.

I left out the liquid smoke and used this on pork loin chops. Left in the marinade for about 6 hours before grilling. They were moist and tender with really nice flavor. The mustard just subtly comes through so I would probably enjoy a little more of it. The amount of marinade seemed a little wasteful to me so I would try to reduce that next time and hope for similar results.

The recipe was okay but the liquid smoke was overwhelming and should definitely be decreased by at least half and decrease the pepper by a third. It was definitely ok for something different

This is a delicious marinade, although I think it could be done with less.  I marinated chicken breasts for a day and a half, scored and grilled.  Delicious.

Absolutely amazing! As others have said, make sure to use low sodium soy sauce or it will be too salty. I have made this every time without the liquid smoke(because I always have the other ingredients on hand but not the liquid smoke). I just used it for a pork tenderloin and it was amazing too! Definitely a recipe to keep in your files and use often.

Made this using 4 chicken quarters. Plenty of marinade for these. Great flavor. Nice caramel color when finished.My husband loves BBQ sauce on his grilled chicken but said this was very good and he'd like it again. Me to! Making it again soon but I think I'll sub oj for lemon juice and see what happens.

Oh. Emm. Gee. This is so delicious! I used fresh squeezed orange juice instead of the lemon (I've been on an orange kick recently), dijon mustard instead of spicy brown, and fresh minced garlic rather than garlic powder. I absolutely love this marinade and will be making it again and again! Can't wait for my boyfriend to try it :)

This was very good! The chicken turned out so tender, I couldn't believe it! I used the marinade recipe exactly with no substitutions.

I bought a bag of frozen chicken breast tenders with a zip top. Then I added the marinade in the bag with the frozen tenders and put it in my fridge the night before. (Put a tray underneath in case it leaks.) In the morning, I took the bag out of the fridge and  let it sit on the counter until I was ready to grill them for lunch (4 hours). Delicious!

Delicious marinade! I strongly suggest using the low sodium soya sauce however. I only had regular soya sauce and it turned out quite salty for my personal taste. Will use low sodium next time, as the recipe called for, and I'm sure it'll be perfect! Chicken was very moist, tender, and flavorful.

Excellent, I decreased the soy sauce to a scant 1/3 cup (didn't have low sodium so thought this would make it less salty) and the OO to 1/3 cup (didn't want to waste ingrediants), kept everything else the same. This was amazing, wonderful flavor! Thanks for the recipe:)

I didn't care for this at all (sorry!). The marinade smells wonderful and I have no aversion to any of the ingredients in it, but it just didn't wow me (or my hubs for that matter...). My chicken was only somewhat flavorful and not at all what I had had hoped for. This marinade doesn't glaze well at all (if you're gonna grill, you need a thick basting sauce / glaze, IMHO). The only thing I did like was the smokiness - the liquid smoke was a nice addition. Served with deli potato salad, BBQ baked beans, garlic bread and sweet tea. If for nothing else, I appreciate how simple this was to prepare. It made for a SUPER easy weeknight meal, but unfortunately wasn't a memorable one. Thanks anyways, TaraNicole! :-)

Love this marinade! Since I live in Florida, we grill almost every weekend and several times during the week.  To help myself out, I double the recipe to use on everything we will grill - chicken, beef, veggies, and shrimp. Even though it does give chicken a very pretty color, the flavor makes it a hit with everyone.  My favorite is beef steaks and the shrimp.  

Since this is my family's favorite ways to eat their meat, I often prep and cook my meat for the week over the weekend.  This way I have my protein ready for my week and just need to prepare my side dishes.

I just made this marinade this morning with these  adjustments I used white soy sauce instead of the dark(White soy sauce is made from wheat and is lighter and much sweeter tasting) I had fresh garlic so I minced  up 2 medium sized gloves of garlic with just a little dash of garlic powder and Dijon mustard.If I could give this recipe 50 stars I would it is just yummy,my husband had a taste of it and asked for me to put some aside to be used on his salad tonight,I pored the rest in a plastic bag containing chicken thighs so they can marinade all day .I shall grill them for tonight's dinner served with some homemade bread,salad,Au Gratin Potatoes and some nice Merlot.

The chicken came out moist and perfect.  The liquid smoke and mustard are the key to this marinade.

I thought that was a lot of fluid for only 4 chicken pieces so I added 1lb of shrimp to the marinade and put them on the grill as skewers, and wow were they great!

We thought this was outstanding!  I did marinate but not nearly long enough, I only had about 1 hour to spare to marinate.  But then baked it in the oven about 45 minutes and it was delicious.  I can only imagine how it would be on the grill.

This marinade is fantastic. It's not too salty, and the combination of flavors adds some je ne sais quois. It was such a hit at my last cookout that my foodie friends all asked for the recipe.

I had to make what I hoped would be good substitutions.  No liquid smoke, so I used steak sauce.  No spicy mustard, so I used regular yellow.  It was very, very good.  I only marinated for an hour or so while the coals heated, but the chicken had a very nice flavor.

I loved this! I didn't use liquid smoke, and only marinated the chicken for an hour. I used the amt of marinade listed, but on seven chicken breasts and there was plenty, even for that much chicken.  This is a definite keeper.

Yummy. I only had regular soy sauce. It was almost too salty where the piece of chicken was thin, but where the piece of chicken was thicker, it was not too salty at all. I also did not have the liquid smoke.  A great marinade.

Very good.  The 2 tbsp of smoke was edited down to 1 teaspoon and was PLENTY!  Would drop it to 1/2 next time.  I added fresh parsley and used fresh, not powdered garlic.

I was only able to marinate our chicken for about 1 hour.  I did use a little less of the reduced-sodium soy sauce because it was all I had.  Cooked inside on my George Forman grill for 10 minutes.  This was so good.  Paired this with "Adrienne's Cucumber Salad" also from this site.  Perfect light and awesome dinner!

Wow!  Really liked this alot.  Used full sodium soy because that was all I had in the house and came out fine.  Also marinated overnight because of a change in dinner plans.  Came out juicy and perfect.  Our new go-to marinade.  Can't wait to try it on company  :)

I think the liquid smoke really puts it over the edge. I actually soaked the chicken in the marinade overnight and I didn't have any problems either with the chicken. It was moist, flavorful, and the carmelization was fantastic.

I doubled the mixture and marinated a quartered chicken for about 20 hours.  I did have to use half lemon juice and half orange juice.  It was very good; I especially liked the crispy, flavorful skin!

My 15 yo son that HATES chicken because we have it so frequently said "Is this really chicken?" I said, "yes, why?". He said "BECAUSE ITS THE BEST CHICKEN IVE EVER HAD!" (with a bottle of BBQ sauce nearby-which he didn't even use & he puts BBQ or A1 on most of my chicken dishes). The only thing I didnt have was the Liquid Smoke but I did grill the chicken & I used boneless thighs. I thought the lemon was too much but maybe thats because I didnt have the liquid smoke. Def a keeper!

This is the BEST marinade! My family says it tastes like grilled chicken from a steakhouse. And it does. Even when omitting the liquid smoke. Try it once and you'll be hooked. So easy and delicious. Wish I could give this 10 stars.

Really liked this. I didnt have low sodium soy so i used regular. We like salty so we thought it was fine but if people aren't salt fans I would recommend using the low sodium. 
It turned out to be too cold to grill so I baked it and it turned out delicious. Will be making this more often. Thanks

Beautiful presentation but the chicken was a tad too salty.  I do normally cut my chicken breast into 2 pieces to make a true serving size so maybe there was more marinade on each piece?  Will reduce low sodium soy sauce next time to maybe 1/2 c and might add some crushed garlic.  My guests liked it though.  Great with grilled asparagus and really does look PRETTY!

Very good.  I only marinated for about 20 min, and it was very flavorful and juicy.  I don't have reduced sodium soy sauce, so I just used less of the regular.

Amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  I used this on chicken drumsticks that we grilled (using our propane grill).  I will use this again and again!  The leftovers were terrific the following day too!

Ever since I found this recipe, I have made it every week and no one in the family has gotten tired of it!  I try to make extra chicken so there are leftovers, but it doesn't last more than a day in our house.

Yum! We loved this recipe, I've made it twice; and while it is saltier with regular soy sauce - we liked it that way!  We ate it once with baked potatoes and corn on the cob, and the second time sliced over salad.  Great recipe - LOVE it!

Best marinade I've tried this summer!  My family agreed it was their favorite of the three others I've tried.  I marinaded 8 chicken breasts for 10 hours -- great taste on the grill, nice and juicy.  I did not have reduced-sodium soy sauce and it was a little salty for my taste... I will try it with reduced-sodium soy as directed next time.

My husband (not a chicken eating kinda of guy) and I both LOVED this.  I never substitute ingredients when making a recipe for the first time. I go to the grocery and buy anything I don't have. Any substitutions probably change the recipe that was submitted, right?  Sooo, prepared just as written and grilled on our outside gas grill by hubby, turned out delicious, Chili's restaurant type chicken.  He even said THREE times, (the "I really don't  like chicken guy"), this is really good!Update:  prepared this again and used the 2 tbsp of mustard (used less the first time) and it was alot saltier than the first time I prepared it.  Makes me wonder if the "too salty" complaints may have been caused by the amount of mustard than the low sodium soy sauce. ??  Will add only 1 tbsp. from now on.

We have made this chicken a couple of times since I discovered this recipe. This makes some of the best grilled chicken ever. I usually make a double batch of the recipe so that we can marinade the chicken, have enough to baste the chicken while it cooks and then some for dipping at the table. Awesome!

I followed the recipe exactly - with the exception of the cut of chicken i used.  I used bone in (skin on) chicken breasts and although I marinated the chicken for about 10 hours, the flavor of the marinade didn't really permeate the meat.  I will probably make this again, but next time I will use boneless/skinless chicken breasts which I've either butterflied or flattened.

Yum tasty.  I didn't find it too salty, but I am a salt fiend. I had to use spicy sweet mustard instead of spicy brown because I didnt have the brown in the fridge. I left mine marinate over ngiht and my breasts didnt cook in the juice.. they were fine

Sorry, but I didn't really like this recipe. I even used the low-sodium soy sauce, but all we could taste was the soy sauce with a bit of liquid smoke.

This was absolutely delicious! I marinated over night and there was no sign of the lemon cooking the chicken. The flavor was wonderful and the chicken caramelized beautifully on the grill. Rave reviews from my whole gang. Thank you Tara!

I had it marinating when my husband got home.  He wanted to meet friends at a restaurant.  I had to let it marinate 26 hours.  It still turned out great, wasn't tough.  very good flavor, browned nicely.  My husband really liked it.

This was just okay for me...it was tasty and had a nice tang but not as good as some other marinades I've had. It's not like it's a bad recipe or anything, I guess it's just not for me. I made everything as directed sans the liquid smoke (I never use the stuff). Also, if you happen to not have any reduced-sodium soy sauce on hand use about 1/4 cup of the regular stuff (go by taste, start out with a little then increase if needed). Just don't use 2/3 cup of not reduced-sodium soy sauce. :)

I used thighs since they were on sale. I made the marinade as listed and the oil was a bit much and unnecessary. I could see it being needed in a boneless and skinless chicken breast but it was just too oily to cook nice on the grill. My grill exploded as soon as I put the first piece of chicken down. Next time I will leave the oil out. Another modifier I used was I added a can of beer since the amount I made wasnt enough and I didnt want to add vinegar or water. Beer worked well!

Outstanding Chicken Marinade and instructions!  This is the FIRST juicy but cooked grilled chicken we've ever cooked.  The only minor changes from the ingredients included no liquid smoke, didn't have it and didn't miss it.  Used heaping tablespoons of dijon rather than spicy brown.  Used freshly ground black pepper and lemon pepper combined.  Also added about 4 healthy shakes of the Chicken/Seafood spice purchased from the 99Cents store(frugal--not cheap *giggle*).  Marinated it for just over two hours.  My husband grilled the chicken 8 minutes per side.  This was the most difficult part of the recipe for him because he likes to flip whatever he's grilling a bazillion times!  The results were D-I-V-I-N-E!!  Picture perfect, great tasting, moist and juicy grilled chicken!  Thanks so much for the recipe and the valuable instructions TaraNicole!

Excellent taste, pretty color just lik the recipe name.  I used less olive oil, soy sauce, and lemon juice and still had plenty of marinade.

This is now my dh's favorite marinade, and he is certainly a food critic! I usually make half the marinade for 4 chicken breasts - it is plenty and I don't like to waste ingredients. The only thing we do differently is to smoke some wood chips on the grill while cooking it instead of using the liquid smoke flavoring. I highly recommend that you try this!

Awesome just as it is!  We didn't have any dijon, so I used Paula Deen's substitution chart to help.  For one tablespoon of dijon, you can use 1 T. dry mustard mixed with 1 t. water, 1 t. white wine vinegar, 1 T. mayo and a pinch of sugar.

This is my most requested recipe.  I often make this for dinner guests and big barbeques.  I make the marinade in advance (at least the day before).  I sometimes split the breast of chicken in half width-wise to make thin pieces that cook quickly. I have marinated it them for varying lengths of time and always get great results!

Yum, this was so moist & juicy with GREAT flavour!  I can't really say my chicken was as pretty as it could have been...hubby is out of town and I don't BBQ, so I cooked 2 bone in skinless breasts in the oven at 400, covered for about 30 minutes and uncovered for about 10, basting often.  It definitely had the caramel colour, so can't wait to try it on the BBQ.  My only small change was not using liquid smoke...not even sure if I can buy it here in Canada, maybe somewhere, but have never really looked for it or noticed it!  I threw in a small amount of chipotle chili powder in its place (due to the 'smokiness' of that).  Fabulous chicken...the other piece that I was saving for hubby to try was devoured by my 7 year old!

I made this yesterday and followed the recipe prettty much exactly - the ONLY thing I did different was to marinade for about 6 or 7 hours - that worked out just fine.  My husband grilled it very slowly on low heat - Very tender and moist - my kids even enjoyed it (4 and 5 year old boys) The cut of meat I used was bone in chicken thighs  - its a keeper

Even though I marinated for 7 hours, this was the best chicken we have ever grilled.  Very Flavorful, juicy and delicious.  You know it's good when your children are asking for "that chicken" again, and the adults are asking for the recipe!  Thank you!

Absolutely delicious!  Followed the recipe to a "T", but the family found it a bit salty so will cut down on the soy sauce next time and probably on the oil also. A keeper!

Thank you, TaraNicole, for this amazing recipe!  This marinade is easy, delicious, and tastes like you've spent hours prepping.  I don't always have liquid smoke on hand, so I usually end up using 1-2 Tbsp of brown sugar to give a caramel-ly quality as it grills.  It also gives a sweetness that is a wonderful compliment to the saltiness of the soy sauce.

I halved the recipe and then halved the soy sauce again plus substituted Dijon mustard because I didn't have any spicy brown mustard plus I didn't have on hand the reduced sodium soy sauce so I used regular.  I thought with only using about 1/6 cup of the sodium, it would be fine.  Maybe if I would have used the low sodium it would have turned out.  The flavor was fine but it still was extremely salty!  I ended up throwing some Masterpiece BBQ sauce on it just to be able to eat it.  I will definitely not make this again.

This was fabulous! I would highly recommend it because it's so easy and very flavorful! The only thing I'll do different next time is to save a bit of the marinade before putting the chicken in it to make a little gravy for dipping.

Made this at a friend's house and cooked on her grill.  It was, quite frankly, amazing.  I've also tried baking the marinated chicken in the oven, and it's quite tasty.

Made them as specified. I liked the flavor; very interesting mix between the lemon juice and the liquid smoke. Unfortunately, I live in a NY apartment and don't have a charcoal grill (I used a stovetop grill), and the breasts were too thick (I should have pounded them so they'd cook more evenly), so they ended up too dry outside by the time they were done inside. I'd like to try the recipe again, because if the meat remained moist, I think we'd have a winner.

This is just a really good tasting marinade.  It definately has a taste that is unique.  My friends come over and are extremely impressed on how good it tastes.  I usually leave it in there for over 12 hours and shake up the tuperware I put it in occasionally through the day.  If using it after just a couple of hours, you might want to score the meat to let the marinade seep into the middle easier.

This was good, and my family really liked it. I was expecting something more spectacular based upon the comments here, but it really was pretty tasty. Part of my disappointment is really my own fault, I used chicken breasts that were too big so I don't think each piece got enough flavor infused through. When I try this again I'll follow one of the other reviewer's advice and use either tenders on a skewer or smaller/thinner pieces of chicken.

I am not a fan of chicken but I am on a low carb diet, so when I saw the good reviews for this recipe I decided to try it.  Wow!  I am so impressed!  I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken came out perfectly!  Very juicy and wonderful flavor.  It was SO easy too!  Thank you so much for posting!  I will definitely be making this one again.

This recipe has been sitting in my recipe box for ages, and I finally made it last night. I did not change one thing except I only had 1 tbsp of liquid smoke when it called for 2. I also used regular soy sauce. It was TO DIE FOR. My boyfriend insisted I make it again, only with steak next time. :) For the side I made the Antipasto Salad recipe on this site, which was also mouth watering and went great with this chicken.

With all the good reviews, I figured I couldn't go wrong trying this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, used low sodium soy sauce and only marinated for four hours.  This just didn't have much flavor, seemed to be missing something.  My husband and I didn't care for this at all.  Sorry to say, I will not be making this one again.

Ever since we got a new smoker/grill we make this recipe weekly. I don't change a thing and the ingredients are things that are always on hand. The only thing I do change is that I cut the liquid smoke in half since we cook the chicken on a smoker. Otherwise it is delicious, easy to make and fairly easy clean up.

I'm sorry to disagree with other reviewers, but this Marinade was not impressive and we feel didn't add much to the chicken.  My BH is an excellent cook and loves to BBQ, so we thought this would be something different for our grilled chicken.  It was too liquidy, didn't taste anthing other than the oil or soy sauce (too much if you ask me).  And we feel it didn't do much to tenderize the chicken.  I feel that once you "brine" poultry you can't go back to other recipes for tenderizing.  I was hoping that the marinade would at least give this chicken some flavor, but it didn't work for me.  Sorry!

Nice flavor. I cut back to 1/3 cup of soy sauce and 1 teaspoon salt.  I was out of spicy brown mustard so I had to sub dijon.

For the first time my boys didn't smother the chicken in BBQ sauce! Definitely a "make again" recipe.

This was GREAT!! The chicken was SO moist and had a wonderful flavor. I took the advice from another review and only used half of the liquid smoke. I also added 2T of honey, as I was worried it would be too salty (even with low sodium soy). This is a keeper!

YUMMY, i marinaated for one day in a foodsaver container, then broiled it instead of grilling.  I made quite a few of them so we can have leftover for the next 2-3 days (just make sure you keep it in foodsaver container.)

I'll join the chorus here and say it was GREAT!  Only marinated for about 2.5 hours but it was definitely enough.  Very flavourful and moist chicken resulted.  Thanks!

This recipe is great! I've made is many different times over the last 6 months and everytime it's a hit.  At the last party where it was served more than half of the guests asked for the recipe.  The only change I've made is to use fresh garlic instead of the powder.

We loved this marinade, it's quick and doesn't call for lots of ingredients. I used chicken tenderloin strips, and stir-fried the chicken with porobello mushroom slices and onions. Can't wait to try it on pork!

I joined just to give you the greatest review ever.  I cooked this chicken Saturday night for a party.  This was easy, tasty and I'm getting rave reviews on how juicy and wonderful the letovers are, not to mention the tons of compliments I got that night.  Thank you so much.

WOW!!! Very moist, flavorful chicken.  I like how it doesn't need to marinate long for it to work it's magic on the chicken.  I increased the pepper for a little more kick. I'll definitely make this a regular!!

Very Good!!!  I did make a few changes/additions.  I used one clove of fresh garlic, minced instead of the powder.  I also added 3T. of brown sugar, 1 tsp of grated orange zest and 1 1/2 T. of Makers Mark.  The chicken was delicious!

This marinade was delicious and the chicken was very juicy. I didnt use liquid smoke since we were grilling and it did turn out a little too salty but it still was great!! Next time I make it I will cut the soy sauce in half.

We tried 5 different marinade recipies to try to find one for our family bbq and this was the winner. The flavor is great  and it really is pretty. The first time we made it we  injected some of the marinade into the meat. The second time we were cooking to much chicken to take the time to inject it.  I hightly recommend injecting --the meat had so much more flavor. But either way, the meat was really moist.

Despite my worry after mixing up this concoction of odd flavors, it turned out perfect. I added a little bit of ketchup, a tablespoon of brown sugar.. and instead of liquid smoke I threw in a tablespoon of worcestershire. I served it with brown rice. This will definately be a recipe I use a lot this summer! Thanks!

Very tasty marinade. I used thai fish sauce (I was out of soy) and Dijon mustard. It did turn a nice caramel colour, as promised. I will make it again with chicken & I'll try it with pork, too... and I'll try the right ingredients, too:)

My entire family loved this, and one in particular is very picky.  I made a modified version with what I had.  Light olive oil, regular soy, lime instead of lemon and no liquid smoke, marinated for a little more than an hour.  6 half breasts grilled at about 350F for about 6 min. on each side.  I did flay the back of each breast at the thickest points for more even cooking before marinating.  So juicy and delicious!  This is a new family favorite!!

The flavor in this is AMAZING - by far my favorite chicken marinade.  I will say, however, that the oil and soy sauce amounts are quite a bit larger than they need to be.  When I make this recipe, I half the oil and soy sauce to 1/3 c. each and keep the other ingredient measurements the same - this works out well.

It was good flavorful recipe particularly if you like soy sauce as that is by far the dominate flavor. If you marinate in a plastic baggies you can make half the amount suggested for the amount of chicken specified. Next time I will bump up the other ingredients a bit.

Absolutely delicious.  I am staying a few days with my grand daughter, son in law, and daughter.  We wanted to have chicken but with something a bit different.  I was looking at reviews on another recipe on AR and someone commented that this recipe was better, in her opinion, so we tried this one.  We really loved it and my daughter and I will both have this on our regular rotation.  Thanks so much for an easy and delicious marinade recipe.

Easiest  and tasty chicken marinade.  As far as not letting it sit too long because of the lemon juice, I had the chicken marinating for two days (dinner plans changed) and it was the most moist, flavorful BBQ chicken we've ever tasted.  I used Dijon mustard instead of brown and used only one tablespoon of the liquid smoke.  Used half the marinade for 8 chicken breasts and saved the other half in the fridge for another batch of chicken breasts later in the week.  Highly recommend.

I used garlic salt, as that is what I had.  I will make sure to have garlic powder next time.  It was a great flavour regardless! Plus it is my favourite marinade!  I use Bragg's Low Sodium Soy Sauce and mmm mmm good!

I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne and 1 tablespoon of dry Italian seasoning.   I didn't add liquid smoke as I smoked and grilled it on my smoker BBQ.

Best ever grilled chicken and marinade recipe!  I have made on several occasions - home, family get together, and parties.  Everyone raves about it, and begs for the recipe.  I use chicken tenders, and will grill up a few pounds - it's great protein to grab and eat cold or heated up after a gym workout or just for snacking.  Easy, easy, easy and delicious!

YUMMY! I Did the recipe as is except I used regular kikkoman soy sauce. Turned out wonderful on the George Foreman grill. Wife said that they reminded her of Logans grilled chicken. Can't wait to try on the charcoal grill!

Not only is this great on the grill, but on a cold winter day I cooked these on the stove in a frying pan.  It was a bit messier than the grill, of course, but everyone liked that it was juicier than usual.  I recommend butterflying the chicken breasts – they cook better and more evenly in thinner slices.

Yes, this simple marinade is delicious and beautifully caramelized. I substitute three cloves of fresh garlic for the garlic powder and I reduce the liquid smoke to 1 teaspoon.  Secret to tender, juicy chicken breasts that marinade in just a few hours? Pound to 1/3" thickness before marinating and cook quickly over a hot grill.

This has become part of our regular rotation. So easy and so yummy. Every ingredient can be kept on hand. If it's ugly out, I either broil or use my FlavorWave. Awesome either way.

I don't get it. The pepper way overpowers everything if you follow it as written. It was so, so bitter from the pepper and I did everything exactly as written. Cutting the pepper in half and adding one T of honey made a huge difference, and with those changes it is a good marinade. Pretty and tasty. You can marinate chicken overnight. It is fish that should not be marinated long, no more than two hours.

This marinade is delicious! I think next time I'll cut back on the lemon just a wee bit but that's a personal preference. If you're using chicken tenders like I did, marinate for about 20-30 mins. An hour was much too long for mine and I think it contributed to some pieces being tough.  This stuff is addicting! Thanks for a new flavor profile for boring ol' chicken! :o)

Very very good. Seriously gorgeous just off the grill. Excellent with grilled corn on the cob and twice baked potatoes. 

**PAY ATTENTION TO USE LOW SODIUM SOY SAUCE. It is the perfect amount of saltiness.

I'm not even sure what prompted me to try this marinade.  I'm a very picky eater, and I tend to "stick with what I already know I like" when it comes to certain things.  I've been using the same 4 reliable marinades for years because of this.  

But this was simply out of this world.  I set my chicken to marinade about 4 hours and then my husband put it on the grill.  I am so impressed with how moist and flavorful it turned out.  We were arguing over who got the leftovers (I won :p )!  

I'm making this again tonight, and realized I hadn't left a review, so I needed to correct that.  Thanks so much to the person who submitted this... my family is so glad to have a new "flavor" in our marinades!

This was amazing! We used all ingredients as instructed, but we did marinade it for about 24 hours. The chicken was juicy and so flavorful. I haven't been to Cask 'n' Cleaver restaurant in about 10 years, but it instantly reminded me of the chicken I used to order there. Don't doubt the liquid smoke - when we first mixed it we were worried it would be too strong, but once the chicken was grilled and ready to go, the liquid smoke was just the right amount.

Fantastic marinade!  I halved the recipe, marinated for 6+ hours, used standard soy sauce and baked the breasts with the marinade in a baking dish at 350 for 40 mins--basting once toward the end.  Absolutely delicious flavor and the chicken was so tender.  Thanks!!!

This is a great recipe IF you let it marinade longer than overnight.  I left mine in the juice for two days in the back of the fridge as I forgot it and it made one of THE most delicious chicken I have ever tasted.  The second time I made this, I marinaded it according to the directions and it wasn't nearly as impressive.  OK, but not the best in flavor.  I substituted both times lime for lemon and legs for breast.  Then omitted the olive oil and mustard and grilled it on a foreman.  To me the mesquite liquid smoke helps a lot as well as leaving it in the marinade for a long time. First time I didn't  use nearly as much soy sauce and just put in some salt and water to taste (I taste the marinade before putting the chicken in) Everyone has different tastes but I feel limiting the marination hurt the overall flavor and quality of the chicken.

Delicious, simple marinade! Didn't add the liquid smoke because my boyfriend is allergic and it was still amazing. Kept it in the marinade for about 6 hours and didn't have a problem with the lemon beginning to cook the chicken. Kept the meat wonderfully tender. Definitely one of my favorite marinades thus far.

This was very tasty.  I substituted fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder because I love cooking with fresh garlic!  This made a lot of marinade and I hate pouring marinade down the drain, so I cut this recipe in half and still had plenty to marinade 10 boneless chicken thighs. 

Am planning on using this marinade again today for beef and chicken kabobs.  Should be amazing for both kinds of meat!

I think this might be the best grilled chicken I have ever had!  SOOOO good!  I did realize too late that it called for lemon juice after I had run out.  I had an extra orange in the fridge from another recipe that I juiced and used instead.  I don't think it made a difference.  DELICIOUS!  We will be making this recipe many times in the future!

While the chicken did indeed look "pretty," the ratio of flavors is off.  The soy sauce and liquid smoke were predominant, and lent an artificial taste.  If I make again, I will switch the amount of lemon and soy sauce, and cut the liquid smoke in half.

This was some of the best chicken I have ever ate.  It was wonderful! I cut the chicken breast into small peices and let it marinate for about 4 hours and had some onions with it.  My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it.  Thank u for the recipe.

made this recipe today with a few tweaks for volume.  we doubled the amount of lemon juice, added a little more olive oil, but left the other amounts the same.  the chicken was tender and not dry, and got great reviews from our guests for dinner.  this is one we'll make again.

This is an excellent recipe. Substituted dijon mustard for the mustard called for as I couldn't find the other. Served to guests and eaten with raves. Served with the spinach pasta salad from this site as well as my own tried and true baked asparagus (drizzled with oo and sprinkled with parmesan cheese and baked at 400 for 20 min). Made for a very successful entertaining evening. Thanks so much for sharing.

I tried this recipe on pork chops and it was FANTASTIC!  By the way, my plans changed the day I was planning on grilling them so I just left them in the fridge till the next day.  They marinated for way over 24 hours and they were perfect.  Can't wait to try it on chicken.

I was disappointed with this. It was just "too much" of everything that completely overwhelmed the chicken. We were looking forward to it , based on reviews, but we really didn't enjoy it. Did not have seconds. The taste stayed in my mouth for several hours afterward. Altogether overpowering.

A very nice marinade. I think spicy brown mustard is an American product because we don't have it up here in Canada, and don't really like it much, either, so I used Dijon instead. All in all, a nice marinade.

We prepared according to directions.  It started raining and we stuck it in the oven and baked it for about 35-40 minutes with some fresh chopped mushrooms. Served with mashed potatoes.  

It was FABULOUS.  It was like a baked franchise.  We can not wait to grilled next time.

Thanks for the fabulous dish!

My family loves this chicken and it's so easy!  I use Bragg's Amino Acids, slightly diluted for less saltiness, instead of soy sauce.  Delicious!

Holy-moly was this SALTY!  I did use regular soy sauce, only by default as I often do, but still this was far too salty even by those expectations. I even reduced the oil and soy sauce to 1/2 c. each.  The flavors were great, particularly the liquid smoke (which I had never used before), but it was just off, far too salty and a bit greasy.  I will make this again, reducing the olive oil and soy sauce (using low-sodium) to 1/3 c. and keeping the other ingredients the same.

Awesome!  My daughter loved this chicken.  She said it was the best chicken breast she ever had.  I put it in a tomato cream sauce over pasta and she loved it.  Thank you so much!  Oh I used brown honey mustard and salt instead of spicy mustard and soy sauce since I didn't have any on hand.

Left out the liquid smoke and substituted a little bit of lime juice instead of lemon juice, and grilled the chicken.  Great combination of flavors.

Tried this tonight and it was really good.  Followed the recipe except for the mustard, I only had Dijon.  Halved the recipe as I had three boneless chicken breasts and cooked on the G/F grill inside. Will use again.

I have made this 3 times for my husband and daughter, and once for my in-laws.  It has been a hit each time.  I poke lots of holes in the chicken before marinating.  Also, I frequently spoon it over the chicken while grilling.  Great recipe, great flavor!

I used low sodium soy sauce as the recipe calls for and it was still way too salty for me.  However, the flavor was very good.

Pretty good. I would use no sodium soy sauce next time since it was a bit salty. Think I may experiement with a few more chicken marinades.

Great recipe! I made the mistake of using regular soy sauce the first time I tried this recipe- way too salty! But when I made it again using the low sodium it was perfect. I made this chicken for a family cookout and everyone loved it!!

Excellent.  I left the chicken marinating for 2 days in the fridge (not necessarily recommended, but I forgot about it).  It was absolutely awesome!  The recipe makes alot, so I used half and the other half I kept in the fridge for use later.

Loved this marinade! It makes very flavorful chicken after only a few hours in the refrigerator - didn't need any type of condiment with it! I followed the recipe exactly and did not make any changes.

So good!  I made a few substitutions.. and it was a winner!  I only added about 1 tsp. of liqued smoke and added a TBS of Worchester.  I didn't have spicy brown mustard... so I used Grey Poupon.  Everyone loved it!

Good chicken recipe.  Very quick and easy to make. We only marinated for an hour and flavor was throughout the chicken.  Used regular soy sauce and dijon mustard and it turned out good.

Very good flavor, but please consider replacing the olive oil with organic canola. The olive oil when heated at high temperatures, and especially to smoking, releases free radicals. The best temp to cook with olive oil is low to medium heat.

Restaurant quality!  Absolutely LOVED this marinade.  Beautiful balance between sour, warmth, and sweet.  Hints: Canola oil works as well as olive oil, but with a little less flavor; and, 1 T paprika is a perfect substitute for the liquid smoke.

Very tasty recipe. I used this recipe yesterday to marinade chicken for my 4th of July cookout. It got many compliments. For a lack of a few ingredients,  I had to make some substitutions. I had to used ground mustard instead of spicy brown mustard since I didn't have any. I used regular soy sauce instead of reduced sodium soy sauce. Due to lack of time (found this recipe late), I marinade the chicken partially frozen in the refrigerator for about 4 hours. I cut 3 slits diagonally across on each side so it could soak it up in. Then we grilled it. It was SO juicy and flavorful!

I agree with Valerie's Kitchen that the chili garlic sauce was a must-add addition. I took that and ran with it, adding 2 tbsp. as she did. Our chicken came out SO flavorful and moist. Super yummy, finger-lickin' goodness.

I had my girlfriend and her new boyfriend over for a BBQ this past Saturday and so I wanted to marinade the chicken is something really good.  This recipe was amazing and a keeper!  It created a nice char on the grill and the flavor was outstanding.  I did tweak it a bit.  Instead of brown mustard I used a whole grain mustard with garlic and i left out the lemon juice because I wanted to marinade it overnight.  I will definatly make this again!

My 2 kids (ages 13 & 3) and I liked this one but hubby didn't.  Which is why I gave it 4 stars.  I made this ahead and froze it with the meat. After grilling, the meat was still nice and juicy.

This recipe, minus the liquid smoke, received RAVE reviews from the church crowd of about 60 I cook for on Wednesday nights. I grilled the chicken ahead of time, boiled some remaining leftover marinade, poured over the chicken and placed in  250 degree oven. The meat held over amazingly DELISH!

very good....sliced chicken, served atop brown rice made in chicken stock,then flavored with lemon juice and zest & green onion, brought  more citrus by topping off with segmented orange pieces would probably add in walnuts for some crunch

I love this chicken marinade recipe.  I have made it several times just as it says with no changes and the flavor is wonderful every time.  I will use this recipe over and over again.

My husband and I had kabobs last night and I marinated both the chicken and the pork in this and it was FABULOUS! My husband ate more of this than the steak (which he NEVER does) because the marinade was so good. The only change I made was dijon mustard instead of spicy brown because it's what I had in the fridge. Thank you!

LOVE this marinade, it is the absolute best!  I add about 2 Tbsp worcestershire, about 2 Tbsp honey and some onion powder.  I have used honey mustard when I didn't have spicy brown mustard with the same results.  Look no further, this is the BEST marinade!

This chicken was delicious and the color was pretty.  I didnt have liquid smoke so I cut up a raw piece of bacon into the marinade and it did give it a smoky flavour.  I also used regular mustard and dry mustard because I didnt have the spicy.   The only complaint I have is that this recipe wastes a lot of marinade.  Instead of using that much I cut it down quite a bit (1 T oil, 1 T soy sauce, 1 t lemon juice, etc.)  Then I put it in a large ziplock bag with the chicken.  Worked great and tasted great.  Thanks for the recipe!

One word - delicious!  Easiest marinade to put together.  Definitely do not forget to add the liquid smoke.  This will now be my go to marinade for chicken, pork or beef.

This was really, really good!  All 5 of my kids loved it, and that is very rare.  The soy sauce gave the chicken a really nice color, so it looked great too.  This will definitely become a standby marinade recipe - ingredients are always on hand and the marinating time is relatively short.

I made this tonight and it turned out just ok. Couldn't use the charcoal grill, so just had to use the electric one. I think the taste would've been better on the charcoal. Doing it on the electric just made it smell and kinda taste like bologna. As I said, the taste wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting. Will try it again though when we can actually use the outside grill :) Also think I'm going to use only 1 tbs of the liquid smoke. I think 2 is just slightly too much for my taste.

I recently stumbled across this recipe.  I had an end of summer backyard grill-out.  I marinaded about 24 chicken breasts in the marinade.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  The chicken looked great and tasted great!

WOW this marinade is awesome.  I followed the recipe except that we used lime juice (that's all I had at the time). Everyone raved about the flavor and how moist and tender the chicken was. Thanks Tara for sharing.

I used this marinade and everyone really liked it. I'm using it again this evening. I didn't use the olive oil (only cause my husband is on a fat free diet) and I also didn't use the smoke flavoring (cause I didn't have any on hand). I also used regular soy sauce and didn't have any problems, but we are all salt users in this family and add it to everything. Thanks for the recipe!

love it, love it, love it!  It reminded me of a chicken recipe I used to eat at Black Angus restaurant in California.   My husband really liked it too.  That says alot.  I did not use liquid smoke, just because I did not have any. You have to try this recipe!  Thank you to TaraNicole for submitting the recipe!

This was a really great marinade with a unique flavor.  I used regular soy sauce and I did not find it too salty.  I really wanted to follow the recipe as exactly as I could, but I just could not bring myself to use 2 tablespoons of liquid smoke.  Most marinades I've made before have called for about 1/2 teaspoon.  I used 1 tablespoon.  I will probably use 1 tablespoon if I make it again.

After our first experience with this recipe today, I am confident it's going to be in heavy rotation this summer!! I stuck to TN's directions for the most part, however I : 1. subbed dijon for the spicy brown mustard. 2. used regular soy, so I reduced the amount by about 1/4 cup. 3. Added 2 tablespoons each garlic chili sauce & Worchestire. 4. Used 2 cloves fresh garlic instead of the powder. 5. Reduced the liquid smoke to 1 tablespoon (that stuff is mighty potent!!) I marinaded for 6 hrs, threw it on the grill, and basted it for the next 40 minutes. It turned out excellent; calling it "Pretty Chicken" is being modest! Paired with a spinach salad & spicy carrot rice, its pretty hard to beat. Will most definitely be using this one again...and again..and again. Thanks Tara!!

A hit with my family.  I marinated for 4 hours and used fresh, minced garlic.  The flavor was amazing and I loved the smoked flavor the Liquid Smoke gave it!  Very easy amd very delicious...great for summer grilling.

This is very good.  I only had time to marinade the chicken for one hour and it turned out great.  I beat the chicken with a meat tenderizer before marinading.  This made it so tender.  I left out the smoke flavoring and used regular mustard.  My hubby grilled it low & slow basting with the leftover marinade which I boiled first to kill any chicken bacteria.  This was a hit with my boys!

What a fantastic recipe - we loved this.  The only change I made was to reduce the oil and the soy sauce by 1/2 because it just seemed like so much marinade.  It was beautiful too.  Grilled over a hot grill this is absolutely fantastic.  I will be making this again and again - thanks for a fabulous recipe.

This is seriously good!!! I didn't have olive oil on hand so I subbed in canola and used the juice of a fresh lemon. I halved the recipe as I was marinating a small whole chicken for the rotisserie. I did marinate for the 4 hours as suggested and cooked according to the rotisserie directions. It was FABULOUS!!! The liquid smoke gave it a nice outdoors flavor. This will be a regular chicken marinade from now on. Can't wait to try it on the grill!!! MMMmmmmmmm!

Very good! I used full salt soy sauce and thought it was just fine, but then again I do love my salt! I had to substitute lemon juice for frozen limeade because my roommate threw my lemon juice out. Still great!

This is a great recipe, and simple to make.  I grill it on the lowest temperature with the grill lid closed (watch for flare-ups.)  It takes a while but it's so worth it.  I use thighs, drums, wings.  When grilling is done, I cover with foil and the chicken is tender and juicy.  The best compliment - I served it to my 82 year dad and he insisted I give my mom the recipe.

My family loved this marinaded chicken.  I added some minced garlic to mine.  I also but the left over marinade in a pot and boiled it for about 3 minutes (to kill the bacteria) and basted the chicken with it while it was grilling

I followed the recipe with two exceptions.  I'm not wild about soy sauce, so I used equal amounts of light soy sauce and Kitchen Bouquet. I used Olivado Avocado Oil in place of olive oil...I like the milder taste.  I have never made better grilled chicken! I had some really thick chicken breasts, and now I wish I had cut them in smaller portions so that I would have had more "grilled" surfaces!  Next time I use this marinade, I would definitely do 'ka-bobs'.  I would save some marinade to do veggies separately. Congratulations to TaraNicole for her creation! YUM!

Great marinade!  Left out the smoke flavoring because I didn't have any and it was still yummy!  Only marinated in a tight ziploc for just about an hour and it was perfect!

I chose this recipe over others because I had all the ingredients on hand. I AM GLAD I DID! I will continue to use this recipe throughout the summer! It was great! My whole family loved it. I only used half the amount of olive oil and soysauce, which seemed perfect. Not only did it taste wonderful, it had a great presentation like the recipe states. My boyfriend claimed it "tasted like real bbq" which I attribute to the liquid smoke. Two thumbs up, unless I had more thumbs!!!

I would give this about a 4.8 it was very good, the color was nice but the need to use red sodium soy sauce (or use less like I did) annoys me. Otherwise a lovely recipe.

Pretty good stuff, I didnt have liquid smoke and it still came out moist anf flavorful, although I think next time I will cut back on the amount of oil. Thanks for this recipe.

Apart from using full-sodium soy sauce, and also adding some prepared Colman's English mustard, I made this as written (I was a bit worried about the amount of liquid smoke but it actually turned out to be very subtle. Probably because it was a year or so old). I marinated the chicken breasts for about 8 hours, and, while I thought the flavor was decent, it was a little bit tart/sour for my taste. If I were to make it again, I would add a good-sized pinch of brown sugar. Thanks though!

I thought this was ok.  I thought the smoke flavor was way too intense, but one great thing was my chicken was very juicy when cooked.  I did not grill this and baked it in the oven like another reviewer did. I don't beleive this had anything to do with the taste, but I doubt I will use this recipe again, unless I modify without the smoke flavor.  Thanks for the recipe and it was nice trying something new!

I'm not big on smoke flavoring, so I eliminated that. But, The combination of the remaining ingredients make an awesome marinade we just love and it still has that great coloring to give a fantastic presentation. Any oh, SO EASY!

Very tasty marinade-I chose this one because I always have these ingredients on hand. Regular soy sauce works just fine and liquid smoke is the key,just don't overdue it. Cooked on George Foreman grill and it blackened it a little yet juicy in the middle.

Grilled 3 chicken boneless, skinless chicken breasts and 5 skinless thighs using this recipe.  Probably used 1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce rather than the full amount called for.  Let the meat sit in the mixture for about 90 minutes. Excellent results. Nice to be able to grill out in February in central Illinois, even in the rain. Using this mixture, had very moist chicken with great flavor.  Next time, may add some brown sugar or honey or possibly a couple squirts of a sweet BBQ sauce to add a bit of a sweet taste to the mix. Loved it!

My husband and I LOVED this marinade!!! Will use it again tonight with BBQ Chicken Thighs.  Marinated the chicken for only an hour and was very salty, will try with reduced salt soy this time.  Poured marinade over the chicken when I put it in the oven, cooked for 30 minutes and then added BBQ sauce over the chicken for last 15 minutes.  Tasted great and came out perfect.  First time I ate the skin of the chicken in years@! Probably not the best for the dieter!

I am rating this 5 stars because it is very easy and I have taken it to family/friend get togethers twice and have had people raving over how good it was both times.  This is definitely staying in my cookbook and being passed on to my friends and family.

Since finding this recipe I have used it three times.  The chicken stays so moist and has a great flavor.  It also turns such an appetizing color.

Followed the recipe exactly!  We really enjoyed this!  The sweetness of the lemon juice really compliments the soy sauce and makes for great grilled flavor and also makes the chicken a wonderful color!  Would make a great main dish to serve guests and WOW them!

Used reduced sodium soy sauce and it was still way too salty.  Would have potentially been ok if we served it on a salad or as a sandwich....

Very easy and tasty marinade and the chicken stayed very moist.  Everyone really liked it but even with using the lower-sodium soy sauce, I thought it was a teensy bit salty (as did my salt-loving husband).  I'll probably make this again, though, but may cut back on the soy sauce and/or the marinating time.

This recipe was excellent but for me personally... I would half the amount of Liquid Smoke and Use 1/3 cup of honey... I also used Fresh Garlic instead of the powder.  I marinated the chicken for 10 hours and it was tender and moist.  Definitely use Low Sodium Soy Sauce!  And I agree with other users... chicken isn't tough or dry... most people just overcook it!

This is a wonderful marinade. Alot of the flavor of marinates gets lost when grilling but this one keeps its flavor. Served with a honey mustard sauce.

I found your recipe worked marvelous. I did  make a couple of changes to make due with what was on hand.  Light soy sauce bottle was empty and only had 1/2 cup of non reduced soy sauce so I added water to make up the 2/3 of a cup. I used Horseradish Dijon mustered as well because it was on hand. Other than that I went with it as you layed it out. I did find with that much oil in the marinade that I needed all the height I could muster on the grill. For me I wouldn't be surprised it that your recipe ends up being the hit of the summer for us.

Darned!! This was good! I had a bottle of Wright Hickory Seasoned liquid smoke. Wow. This was so good. I had thighs and drumsticks to use up instead of the breasts. This smelled so good on the grill and tasted heavenly. Will use this marinade many times again!

I put the chicken in this marinade this morning and cooked it this evening for my grandson. He loved it, and so did I. Used breast and thighs, boneless, skinless. When he tried the thigh, he was amazed at how juicy it was. I cooked it on the George Forman Grill for aprox. 8-10 minutes, till the thermometer read 180. It turned out very juicy and flavorful. Will make good sliced chicken for salad. Thanks for the recipe.

This had a nice intense flavor, but in spite of using low-sodium soy sauce, I still found it quite salty.  Must be something in the liquid smoke?  Thanks for sharing your recipe and review comments, TaraNicole!

I love this recipe and make it frequently.  The best part about it is that it only has to marinate for a few hours to have tremendous flavor.  I just made it the other night for guests and was asked for the recipe.  I only substituted regular soy sauce.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this marinade, although looked pretty after the chicken was cooked, was SOOO salty. I don't know what I did wrong, but man...too much for me at least.

My husband and I both loved this - even my picky 2 year old ate it without hesitation. We can't wait to try this for steak nachos - the flavor will be perfect. We are not salt people, but used reg. soy sauce because it was all that we had (just used a little less), and we didn't think it was too salty... Thanks for the easy, flavorful recipe!
UPDATE: This is still our go-to recipe for marinade!Last night, we didn't have time to defrost the chicken and marinate it. So, I put 1/2 recipe together in the crockpot, put in 2 frozen chicken breasts and cooked on HI for two hours (turning them over at about an hour). We finished off the chicken on the indoor grill - it was awsome!

Good marinade. I was concerned with the liquid smoke overpowering the other flavors, but it turned out good. I used regular soy souce and it did turn out just a little bit saulty.

by far the best marinade ive used so far! i didnt have low sodium soy sauce, so i used regular. i added a small handful of brown sugar to help even out the salt flavor. turned out great. not salty at all. i also used a horseradish mustard. this recipe does make a good amount of marinade, but i saved it in a ziplock bag and plan on using it again today for another batch, so at least it isnt going to waste. i was worried about the large amount of smoke flavoring, since a small amount goes a long way, but it turned out very good.

update:
i made this again without adding brown sugar and i have to say it is still very good, but was better with the sugar. from now on i will stick to using a handful of brown sugar also.

This recipe is definately worth trying.  I used it for a dinner party and cooked it on my George Foreman grill.   Everyone wanted to know the recipe.    I used 9 boneless skinless chicken tenderloins (~2oz) and probably could have gotten by with cutting the marinade recipe in half.

This was fantastic! Exactly what I was looking for. I made an asian themed meal and this chicken was perfect with the fried rice I made. So juicy and flavorful. I didn't have liquid smoke, and I did add some minced garlic. That was the only thing I did differently. Grilled up beautifully! We all thought this would be great for pork chops too. Will try that next.

This was a hit with the whole family, a rare accomplishment. I did not have the liquid smoke so I just omitted it and I marinaded it for six hours. It will definately be in my summer rotation.

The chicken turned out juicy and nice to look at, but the marinade really overpowered the chicken. It was very sweet. Not horrible, but not something I will be making again.

Amazing and I used double the amount of chicken with these portions. Served to a dinner guest who is an amazing cook and I was asked for a copy of the recipe! Teens love it too. Win win win! Change name to Pretty Awesome Marinade!

I used about 1/3 cup soy sauce and 1/3 cup Worcestershire sauce. I also added some fresh thyme and summer savory. I then added the chicken and marinade to a freezer bag and froze for later use. On the day of use I allowed the chicken to defrost and marinade for about 10 hours, and then grilled the chicken. Turned out great, juicy and with a great color. The liquid smoke added depth without being overpowering. Will make again.

I've made this several times and everyone loves it.  It is also good on Pork Loin or Pork chops.  I added a little zesty Italian dressing, dry mustard, marjoram and dry minced onion flakes to this recipe.

No changes to recipe for 3 large chicken breasts cut in to six halves and marinated about 4 hours, smells awesome and tastes delicious.  Step-son really liked it, my daughter did not.  Can't please everyone!  I'd make this again for sure.

I make it exactly as posted.  I mix it in a baggie and add frozen chicken thighs.  I thaw the baggie in the fridge for at least 48 hours before I grill the chicken.  I've never had the lemon cook the chicken before.  And I always have rave reviews.  I've shared this recipe more than I'd care to recount.  So good, every time.  This is is my go-to recipe the first time we have people over.

Delicious chicken!  Very juicy. I didn’t have the Liquid Smoke on hand so I substituted Worcestershire.   It was fabulous and my family loved it!   Will definitely be putting it in my rotation.

I always worry about chicken being too dry-. My skeptical son wanted me to cook burgers as well so he would not be subjected to dry chicken. Everyone raved about how juicy and flavorful the chicken was- and my son was the first to make the comment! This is a keeper.

Delicious!
I didn't have liquid smoke, and I added just a pinch of brown sugar. I pounded my chicken breasts just a bit to get them to an even thickness, then stuck them in a bag with the marinade for 5 hours before grilling. They turned out perfect. I will definitely be keeping this recipe on hand. Thanks Tara!

Great recipe. I did modify a bit by adding Worcestershire sauce instead of Smoke and chopped garlic instead of powder. I also added two ingredients - Turmeric and a few dashes of Tabasco. My family from small children to octogenarians LOVED it! And, like everyone comments and the name implies, the boneless, skinless breasts turned out to be BEAUTIFUL!

The best chicken marinade ever. Delicious for everything from boneless skinless breasts to bone-in skin-on thighs. Keeps sometimes dry cuts from drying out. Every time I make this, there are never any leftovers. Crowd pleaser with everyone from kids to adults.

We used this recipe with A six-inch cut of pork loin, and it was as I expected, fabulous. I seared five of the sides at very high heat to seal in the juices and then put the grill to low to finish it on the bottom side (opposite of the fat cap). I took it off at 130-135 and let it rest five-plus minutes. Awesome!  We think grilled pork loin is fabulous if you marinade/brine it; otherwise, it can be bland and dry.

This is a great recipe for chicken and does nothing but compliment our summertime grilled chicken sandwiches. I did marinade for 24 hours a dozen boneless skinless thighs and exchanged some fresh ginger and  garlic for the powder, just spectacular thank you!

I used 5 boneless thighs and cut the recipe in half. There was still plenty of marinade. 
I didn't have liquid smoke, but the taste was still excellent!

This was amazing!!! Tasted like our favorite teriyaki grill. Perfect amount of each flavor blended into deliciousness. I did a HUGE batch to eat throughout the week. Super versatile. We had it with broccoli and rice bowls, salad and sesame ginger dressing, and bbq chicken plates with all the fixings. My husband was in heaven. Even the picky kids kept coming back for more.

This is a great marinade! I used regular soy sauce and had no problem with excess saltiness. The chicken breasts I used were pretty big.  I marinated for 4 hours, came out nice and juicy, flavorful! Nice color. Definitely a keeper!

In my opinion, when chicken sits in a marinade for 4 hours or less, it never has any flavor. Well, not this recipe! This chicken was so tender and flavorful! I made it on the stove top using a grill pan and it turned out perfectly. In fact, my husband told me I could make this again.

I used regular soy sauce but only about 1/2 cup and the salt was at a good level.  This smelled like hot dogs cooking and was delicious.  My chicken breasts were small and thin so I only marinated for 2 hours which was perfect.  When I do thicker ones I'll let it go for 4 hours.

Outstanding!  My low carb wife and bodybuilder son approved...
Did use boneless, skinless thighs and cooked to 165F.  Love this marinade!

We used the recipe exactly as directed, and it was fantastic.  We served it with a couscous (from a package) and a cucumber/tomato/onion salad.  Everyone loved it.  Just the right balance of smoky and sweet.

Without doubt the best chicken marinade I've ever tried. Any time I'm grilling for company I go with this recipe. Of course, taste is paramount when it comes to cooking, but there's something to be said for a recipe that also gives it visual appeal. I mean, this looks like it was done by a professional chef. When I pull this off the grill, people are like "Whoa!"
You're awesome, TaraNicole! :)

This was very good. A super hit with some. I love pepper but this was a bit too much. I used gluten free soy sauce, no smoke (didn't have any) and baked instead of grilled. All in all, a very good recipe and definitely a keeper.

Made it almost as described with a few changes/substitutions. First, pounded the chicken breasts to about a 1/2" thickness and poked the breasts to really infuse the marinade. Didn't have the spicy brown mustard, so I substituted Dijon, and for the garlic powder, I used bottled minced garlic (plus an extra tablespoon). The key for this to work is Low Sodium Soy, and marinating the chicken for at least 4 hours. The chicken was grilled/flipped about 8 minutes per side. It was one of the most juicy and tender grilled chickens we've ever had. This will be the only way to grill chicken from now on.

This is absolutely delicious. I have made it many times. Although it is called "Pretty Chicken Marinade", It could also be called "Delicious" or "Favorite" Chicken Marinade. I don't make any changes to the recipe. I have always bar-b-qued mine. I serve it to company frequently.

Finally a marinade that really makes the grilled chicken delicious! I made this recipe exactly as given, and I wouldn't change a thing. The chicken didn't get crispy or burn like it does with some marinades. Next time, before I put the chicken in, I'll reserve about a cup for brushing on the chicken during grilling and for dipping.

This is my go to chicken marinade and pretty much everyone else's, once they try it.  Great flavor.  I make it exactly as written.  Typically use boneless chicken thighs and make plenty so we can slice up the leftovers for paninis later.

I was quite pleased with this recipe. I did not have liquid smoke on hand, but it still came out very tasty .  The Soy sauce allows the chicken to get a caramelized glaze .  I marinated organic chicken breasts for 1 hour and it was enough time to develop the flavor. I received rave reviews.

I used low sodium soy sauce and Dijon mustard instead of spicy brown because that was what I had. Also, because of an emergency situation the chicken marinated closer to 48 hours rather than  4. Still the chicken was very good and I make again.

WONDERFUL!!  Followed the recipe exactly.  I pound the chicken breasts to even thickness and after marinating in the fridge for 3-4 hours I spray a wire cooling rack with Pam, set it in a baking sheet and place all 4 chicken breasts on it.  Into the oven it goes, broiling at 500 degrees.  Flip every 7 minutes until chicken reaches 165 internal temp.

I use this marinade to make chicken for the grilled chicken salad that I eat for lunch at work every day.  Must be good if I'll eat it daily :)

Truly the best chicken marinade I've ever used! It is quick and relies on ingredients already in my pantry. Even if you only have 15 minutes to marinate , it is worth doing. I have even left it to marinate overnight and it is fine, but better to limit it to the 4 hour timeline. My mouth literally waters when I eat this. I will never  grill chicken any other way. By the way, I always grill my chicken on very high heat (but indirect), so it is crisp outside and very moist inside. Amazing! Thank you!

Made marinade exactly as written.  Marinade is very flavorful.  That being said, Beware.  All grills are not created equally.  On HIGH setting, using my Weber Natural Gas Grill, these were nearly incinerated after only 5 minutes.  I turned the heat down to medium, and was able to salvage them for DH and myself.  Luckily, I never try a new recipe out on company – EVER.  I will make these again, as the marinade is very simple to make and very tasty.  Thank you TaraNicole.

I made this with a few tweeks.  Since I only had regular soy sauce, I cut it down to 1/3 cup to reduce the saltiness.  Also, I left out the garlic powder due to my wife's allergies.  This turned out to be a very flavorable and moist marinade.  I will be using this regularly as is and, also, as a base.

Fantastic!  Used Dijon mustard and  Braggs instead of soy sauce.  It made enough to marinade a whole cut up chicken.  I very much recommend letting chicken marinade for 24 hours.  No need to worry about the lemon "cooking" the chicken.  It does not happen, thus the 4 rather than 5 stars.  Grill chicken 30 minutes, turning over once, over indirect heat.  You can crisp it up by placing over direct heat for a minute or so.  This made the prettiest, tastiest chicken I've made in a long time.  Try it!

For such simples ingredients, this was surprisingly awesome. I always have these items on had, too. I made the  marinade exactly as written, cut up breasts into 3 - 4 oz pieces, then marinated for 4-hours. I grilled them for 8 minutes on each side and they turned out perfect.  We had them with corn on the cob and salad for dinner. Then for the rest of the week, I cut them up and put them on my salad for lunch and dinner. I never got tired of the flavor.

On a whim, I substituted the soy sauce with Worcester so I could use up what we had, and it was absolutely fantastic! I don't know how it would have tasted with the soy sauce, so I can't compare, but I will definitely be using this recipe again and again. Perfect for the first grill night of 2016, thanks so much for posting!

This was absolutely amazing! I realized at the last minute I was out of mustard but it still turned out delicious. I'll be using this as my go-to marinade and can't wait to try it with all the ingredients next time! :)

With so few ingredients and so easy to make this recipe really surprised me with how good it made my chicken. Most of the time I avoid chicken because, to me, chicken is like tofu in that alone its like eating cardboard, but with more calories, and with this recipe I, et al,  actually quite enjoyed our chicken dinner.

This was fabulous - a definite keeper! I used regular soya sauce (didn't have reduced salt version). I used bone-in skin on chicken thighs, scoring through the skin in several places to maximize marinade penetration. I marinated 6-8 hours before grilling. Very good flavour!

I've made this multiple times.  It has become my go to marinade.  I've made it exactly as the recipe is written and I've also made it with some of my own flair.  My personal favorite being adding in 2Tbsp of dark brown sugar OR 2Tbsp of honey and some red pepper flakes.  I also substituted lime juice for the lemon juice one day because I was out of the latter and it still turned out beautifully.  It also works well on pork.  I do recommend using the grill as the original author intended.  It still does okay pan searing, but grill pan or grill truly is the way to go with this one.

This recipe is SO good!  I use whatever I have, within reason.  I've switched the Olive Oil for Vegetable Oil, the spicy mustard for whole grain mustard, the garlic powder for minced garlic--and, every time, it works like a charm!  I usually half the recipe with the four chicken breasts and it still works great.  I've also saved excess in a Mason Jar, for later use, and that works great too.  (My kids also love it, because, it separates--like a cool science experiment.)

I make this with 1/4 cup olive oil, 2/3 is way too much oil for my grill, it ignites my chicken.  Love it on skinless boneless thighs and breasts. My kids love this and have for years.

My kids like grilled chicken.  This recipe makes the best grilled chicken ever made, so they say.  I have made this a few times.  I have let it marinade overnight.  The lemon juice has not cooked the chicken.

This is our primary marinade for chicken. We make it all the time, LOVE IT!!! The only change I made was to 1/2 the liquid smoke, mustard, pepper and garlic. Especially the liquid smoke as that's pretty strong.

This has become our standard!  I too use Dijon because I always have it on hand.  As well, regular soy is just fine.  I use skin on chicken breast and hubby barbeques to perfection.  The skin turns a delicious golden crisp and seals in the flavours.  If people prefer skinless they can just peel it off.  We are in the chicken business and appreciate the excellent recipe.

This is my go to marinade and I don't change a thing. Makes the chicken moist and delicious even after just 30 minutes. I've left out the smoke flavor on occasion and the flavor is just as great.

This is now my "go to" chicken marinade recipe. Basic ingredients, simple, delish!!! I do usually sub fresh garlic for powder. The lack of sugar in this recipe keeps your chicken from burning so easily.

Mixed reviews at our house. I thought it was okay mainly because it was easy and the chicken was moist, but hubby wasn't impressed. We won't be doing it again; there are too many other marinades to try.

I can't believe I have't rated this yet!! I have been making it for years and LOVE IT!!!!  I don't care for yellow mustard but brown spicy mustard is very different! I keep it in the kitchen all the time now, due to this recipe, and I am now confident to add it to other recipes!!  THANK YOU for such a great recipe! :)

Only had two hours to marinade chicken, but it still turned out great!  Used yellow mustard since that is all I had.  Next time will use the ground mustard.  Made kabobs and the chicken was so tender!

LOVE this marinade.  I use it on chicken tenderloins and the grill up in minutes.  I usually make it up the night before and have never had a problem with marinating for this long.  Oh and bonus the kiddos love it too.

I did not have low sodium soy sauce, so I used the regular stuff and just used 1/2 cup instead of 2/3...this was still too salty for me, but the rest of my family loved it.  I did have other changes, as well:  I didn't measure out 1/4 cup of lemon juice and just used the juice of half a lemon.  I did not have liquid smoke on-hand so I just skipped it; I used Dijon mustard with chardonnay instead of the spicy brown mustard; I also added a tablespoon of brown sugar and two tablespoons of sweet pepper paste, just because I like to add a little sweetness wherever there is salt.  I will definitely make this again, but maybe use just 1/4 cup of the regular soy sauce next time...and perhaps buy the liquid smoke so I have it in my pantry.  Thanks for the great flavor combination!

Pretty tasty.  We only had an hour to marinade it, but it turned out mighty mighty tasty.  Will definitely make it again.  We only had yellow mustard and regular soy sauce.  My son wants me to mention that we used HICKORY liquid smoke (We also have apple and mesquite in the house for jerky)------ edit: I have been making this often.  One of my favorite ways is to make a LARGE batch of the marinade then place 1.5# of fresh raw chicken breasts (sliced about 3/4" thick and in palm-sized pieces) in a ziploc bag with 1 1/3 cup of marinade and freeze.  I do 6-8 bags at a time for easy dinners.---- the other thing I did last night was take the marinade that was left when I removed the chicken and boiled it on the stove for about 10 minutes.  The oil separated, and I poured it off, but then there was a yummy yummy sauce that added zest to our chicken salad last night and a wrap I had today with the leftover chicken.

Fantastic!  I rarely try a new recipe when I have company for dinner but this had so many positive reviews that I served it for a houseful on the 4th of July.  It was amazing.  I really dislike when people comment on how they changed the recipe etc but I did make 2 small changes out of necessity and it was still great.  I used 1/2 the amount of soy sauce simply because I didn't have low sodium variety and it still came out great!  I also used half the amount of liquid smoke also because of some picky eaters and it still had a great grilled flaver.  Highly recommend this marinade.  Foolproof great chicken!

Very good! My husband loved it. If you dont like "smoky" barbecue, you may wish to cut back on the liquid smoke. the first time I made it I made it exactly like the recipe. Next time I may just put 1TB of liquid smoke. However, my picky husband said he wouldnt change a thing so i would recommend making it to the recipe the first time through.

I made as written  I did leave it overnight and it was still very good.  My granddaughter said it was the best chicken.  Not sure where it gets the pretty name as it looks like grilled chicken.  It should be called great chicken.

Made a really nice, juicy chicken.  We reduced the liquid smoke to just a few drops, as the recipe amount just seemed like wayyyy too much.  Used regular soy sauce and crushed garlic instead of powder.  Half the recipe was just enough for 3 good-sized chicken breasts.  Let marinate overnight, then grilled inside on the Foreman.  Juicy, tender and NOT too salty.

A M A Z I N G.....doubled recipe for extra chicken, followed listed recipe (except doubling) but added some fresh chopped rosemary and thyme. Marinated for about 8 hours for heading to the grill.....perfect. I had 20 guests, served this chicken and Hibbs ribs (also from this site)...everyone raved.

I did all as written except for the mustard.  I subbed 1 tbsp regular yellow, and 1 tbsp dijon.  It was good, but it was a little salty (even with the reduced sodium soy).  We eat low salt, so we are more sensitive to it. I would make again

I followed this recipe exactly except I used 2 tsp McCormick Grill Mates Mesquite flavor instead of the liquid smoke which I did not have.  Usually I will read the reviews to see what I should substitute or if I should have just left it out but I didn't have time to research tonight and decided to just wing it with the mesquite.  I had 3 boneless skinless breasts and thought this was a bit too much marinade.  I HATE to throw the stuff away anyway but have to b/c of the chicken so when there is an abundance of ingredients going in the trash it makes me sad.  I wish I had more time to let the chicken marinate but even though I had only 45 minutes it soaked up PLENTY of flavor.  I put it in my convection oven for 30 minutes at 350 and it was super moist and flavorful.  Great color, like the featured review mentioned.  This is a KEEPER.  THANKS!

This marinade is nothing short of fantastic!  So savory and wonderful!  I didn't have spicy mustard so I used dijon.  I baked mine first, b/c I have too many distractions, and then finished it off on the grill.  Will be a regular in our house. Unlike others I have tried, you really do taste the marinade after cooking.  H. Huff

I use this marinade as the basis for many meat types we cook. It was interesting not only how easy it is to make (for chicken), but also to adapt it for pork, beef, or what ever. Because of this recipe, I no longer buy store bought marinade. If I want a BBQ, sweet and sour, or garlic i just change things up. Thank you for sharing this!

Fantastic! The chicken just melts in your mouth. But you must use low sodium soy sauce. It's too salty if you don't.

Very tasty but make sure you use LOW SODIUM SOY SAUCE as stated in the recipe, it really does make all the difference ( I used low sodium Kikoman soy sauce) This recipe is a keeper.. Thanks for sharing :)

I'm rating this 3 stars because it wasn't a bad recipe, but it paled in comparison to other marinades. The chicken tasted pretty good and it did look pretty, but nothing about the flavor stood out!! The only change I made was using worc. sauce instead of liquid smoke (didn't have any). It was a good way to switch things up, but I won't make this again.

I have tried this recipe several times...and its easy and tasty.  I made the mistake of blending my ingrediants into a bowl that had pineapple juice...and what a great mistake it was!  Now I incorporate fresh pineapple juices and bits of pineapple in the marinade.

Great Recipe... the family and guests loved it!  I cut the regular soy sauce amount down, I didn't have the Low Sodium.  And added fresh squeezed lemon on top as I served it.

This marinade was great! I followed the recipe exactly.  I got a lot of positive comments and the chicken itself came out moist. The fact that anyone even noticed/commented on the marinade was a good sign to me since it is not an overwhelming marinade that screams for comments but it got them! We marinated close to the "max" 4 hours for family dinner, but I prepped too much and we left a few pieces marinating for another couple days and they came out just as good when we grilled them later.

MODIFIED FOR WATER SMOKER
With a few changes, this marinade produced a beautiful and tasty whole chicken (3 1/2 lbs) after 5 hours of SLOWWW cooking in a water smoker (i.e., indirect heat with a large pan of water between the fire and the chicken).
In place of the liquid smoke, I used one cup of water-soaked apple chips on the fire.
Olive oil reduced to 1/3 cup.
2 tsp of Sriracha Hot Chile Sauce in place of black pepper.
Very tasty!

This was an easy and delish recipe.  My husband loved it. I used chicken thighs with the bone and skin, so with the oil combo, it flamed a lot.  Still, it turned out so yummy, and I basically have all the ingredients on hand at any given time.  Great recipe!

I tryed this recipe about a week ago and it was great. The marinade makes enough for alot of chicken ( I made 4) so next time I'll either make 8 chicken breasts, or cut the recipe in half. The flavor is really tasty.

This is probably one of the best chicken marinade recipes I've had.  I make it all the time for barbecues.   I do it as kabobs.  Kids, everyone loves it.  Makes a great left over over a salad to make a great week day lunch.

Great recipe, but I agree with almost all, WAYYYY to much salt!  Just replace the garlic salt with garlic powder and I bet it would be MUCH better! I will definitely try it again!

Made this as written a few times and thought it was fabulous. Last time, I added a splash of worcestershire and about 2tablespoons of brown sugar and thought it was even better, which I didn't think was possible. I will use this every time I grill chicken from now on!

This is an awesome marinade!  I will use it over and over again.  Can't wait to try it on pork chops or a pork loin.  I didn't use as much liquid smoke as called for and used garlic paste (in the tube) instead of the garlic powder.  I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and they turned out great.  The meat was very moist and tender.  I'd do it again in a heartbeat!  Best ever!

I tried this recipe for dinner tonight and it was a success! I only marinaded it for 2 hours, but the flavors were great!! I made two changes however, I left out the mustard (I didn't have any on hand) and instead of grilling the chicken I placed it in the oven, marinade and all, and cooked it for 30 at 350° (we don't have a grill) and it still turned out AMAZING! Even my husband liked it and he is not a big fan of chicken. I will definately be using this recipe again!

We love this chicken both on the grill and I even cook it in a frying pan with the marinade.  I have yet to use liquid smoke because I don't have any and it still tastes great and makes the juiciest chicken.

I have to start by saying that I rarely give a recipe 5 stars.  I also have to say that I read all the great reviews thinking, "how can chicken really be that good".  Wow, was I in for a surprise.  I'm not a huge fan of grilled chicken but this was out of this world.  Very easy marinade to throw together and now that I have all the ingredients in the house I will be making this often.  The chicken came out so moist and so wonderfully flavored with just a hint of smokiness.  I loved it and so did my family and our visiting guests.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Really good.  I made 1/2 my chicken using this recipe and 1/2 as I normally do (seasoned salt and pepper) as a just in case.  There was no need for a just in case.  This will be my go-to summer grilling chicken recipe.  I didn't have liquid smoke and I added brown sugar.  Yummy

Every time I make this chicken I have to give the recipe.  It is great.  The only change I made (only because I didn't have it) was to omit the liquid smoke.  It was so awesome without it, I have never tried it with it!  It is a keeper for a long time to come.

So so so good; followed the recipe to a "T" and I think this is the best chicken I've ever had. My better half ususally avoids chicken whenever possible and even he can't wait to have this again.  Thank you for submitting this delicious recipe TaraNicole!!

I used fresh lime juice because that is what I had on hand. I also used 1/2 spicy brown mustard & 1/2 Dijon mustard, based on other reviews that mentioned Dijon. The smoke flavoring smell was  overpowering to me as the chicken was marinading and I was worried about how it would taste, but was happily surprised to find it delicious after cooking on the grill. Glad I tried this recipe.

Yummy!! This was so easy and delicious! And a bit different, too, which is always welcome. Didn`t have spicy brown mustard, so I used dijon. And I have to say I was a bit skeptical at first, but ended up LOVING the liquid smoke flavor!!

Wow!  This had incredible flavor. I marinated for 8 hours, reduced the leftover marinade for basting because we love sauce on meat and also used fresh garlic.  Was hesitant to try this initially because the flavors seemed just okay, but once put together it is great

Marinaded for 5 hours, grilled for 6 minutes each side on Medium Heat.  I cut the chicken breasts in half again to get 8 pieces for quicker cooking without outside burning, they were moist and smoky tasty!  Repeat!

My family and I loved this one.  Had to do them in the oven due to bad weather; can't wait to fire up the grill and try this again.  Outstanding recipe, thanks for sharing.

Very good and easy to make. The chicken came out so moist and full of flavor,  but it was not over bearing . This will definitely be in my recipe box:)

This was good. Makes a very bland meat very tasty. I  especially like using cold leftovers in a salad.

This is probably the best chicken marinade recipe I have tasted.  I try very hard to make the ORIGINAL recipe first and rate it based on that before making any changes.  The only change I made was using real chopped garlic instead of garlic powder.  It was delicious!  It gave the chicken a beautiful color when grilling.  Chicken usually looks so blah off the grill.  The flavor seemed to go all the way thru.  This was a BIG hit with everyone who ate it.
One comment, this makes a lot of marinade.  I used the same amount for double the chicken (8 breast halves) and it was ample!  If I were making only 4, I would probably cut the amounts a bit.

This marinade was very good but I didn't check the nutritional information until after I ate the chicken. I'm subtracting one star because of the high sodium content.

This truly is a great marinade. I usually half the recipe though because it makes more than you'll porbably need. Also, I've never grilled chicken usuing this recipe. I've only baked it and tried it on several cuts of chicken.

Loved it.  Only marinated for 40 minutes and used regular soy sauce.  I could see that it would get to salty if you marinated for more than one hour.

I've made this several times and family likes it.  I DO NOT EVER EVER USE Liquid Smoke.  I cook this over charcoal and hickory wood to get the smoked flavor. I have always found Liquid Smoke too overpowering.  I also think that using 2/3 cup olive oil and 2/3 cup of low sodium soy sauce is wasteful.  I use 1/3 olive oil and 1/3 low sodium soy.  I really don't measure the garlic powder and pepper, I just eyeball it.  Squeeze some spicy brown mustard into and mix.  Coat the chicken with it in a bowl, cover and refrigerate.  I put the lemon in right before I grill it.  This is a good tenderizing marinade.

It WAS pretty once grilled, but we did not enjoy the flavors. I'm not sure, but I think it was the lemon and liquid smoke that was just overpowering and distasteful. Sorry. Not bashing it at all. Just not to my tastes.

This was an amazing marinade! I let my chicken soak for a little over 2 hours. I also used regular soy sauce and it was fine... not salty at all. Will be using this one again for sure!

Very good. Like a moron I did not listen figuring the low sodium was for sissies  and used regular soy sauce and found out why the recipe call for reduced sodium.  Part of being a man  I guess.  It was still awesome and have bought  low sodium for the next time which will be soon. I am sure it will be even better.

This recipe was awesome!! This will be my recipe for grilled chicken for now on. It had great flavor. I stuck to the recipe to a T except I cut it all in half because I was only making 5 small chicken breasts and I used Dijon in stead of brown spicy mustard. It was fabulous!!

This was pretty coming off the grill, I’ll give it that.  But, I’m afraid that’s where my praise of this recipe ends.  We thought this was quite salty, even though I used low sodium soy sauce.  And it had a very strong and dominating soy sauce/liquid smoke flavor, which didn’t appeal to us.  Another fault I find with this recipe is the quantity of marinade it instructs you to make.  I scaled this back to one serving and had plenty for two large skinless boneless chicken breast halves – probably enough for four smaller breasts.  If you decide to make this, save yourself some money and scale way back on the amount of marinade.  I’m being generous with my three star rating, but this one just wasn’t for us.

The chicken had a nice color but I don't think the marinade gave the grilled chicken much flavor. I have had better marinades on chicken. I marinaded for 7 hours too.

Everyone we made this for asks about the recipe... it is awesome. I use half the soy sauce when I am out of low sodium and unlike other chicken marinades the chicken truly absorbs the full flavor and you really do not need much time. My husband who isn't a chicken fan loves this one. The leftovers are great on a salad too.

This marinade is amazing. Even my picky DH loved it. We used it on chicken, but tonight we are going to try it on porl chops. I reduced the smoke flavor in half, b/c I'm not big on the smoke flavor, but it was the perfect amount. Also, I used regular soy and it wasn't too salty. Will use again and again.

This is a great and easy to make marinade.  I am pretty strict with my diet, so I don't like to use the marinades with a ton of sugar in them.  Both my daughters and wife really liked this one also.  I didn't have liquid smoke, but I did cook the chicken over 100% hardwood charcoal so we didn't miss it.  I don't really care for the flavor of liquid smoke.

This made for very tasty chicken.  I made a double batch and there was only one piece left which I ate sliced on a salad.  It was just as good warmed over.

I had to use vegetable oil, because I had run out of olive oil, but other than that I followed the recipe.  It came out wonderfully!  I marinated it for about 5-6 hours and it was perfect!  Will only use this marinade recipe from now on.

I made this marinade for dinner last night.  I cut the ingredients in half since I was making only 2 breasts, but did not change anything.  My fiance and I loved the flavor and the chicken stayed very moist and juicy.  We did not think it was too salty at all.  We will definitely be making this again.

We took others suggestion & used less liquid smoke & soy sauce. We also marinated over night. It had a nice flavor this way, but will reduce the lemon juice next time. A nice change.

This was tender and tasty!  It had a terrific flavor and the beautiful color created a browning effect that helped me control my bad habit of over-cooking  chicken on the grill.  I liked reviewers' idea of using brown sugar, but didn't have any on hand, so I used molasses. Very good!

This is my first time rating a recipe. We make this all the time, only I put it in freezer bags. We then make a square foil tray and then add the chicken and the marinade togeather on it and grill till nice and golden and done. I'am making this in June for my nephews wedding for 200 people.

I made this and grilled out doubled the recipe but not the soy even the reduced sodium has a lot of salt.  I also had no liquid smoke but I smoked with Hickory and it was fine.  Maybe I'll use some next time.

this has become a favorite for our family! I found that kabobs carry the flavor more consistently and spice up with a dash of cayenne - love it!

This was too salty for me. Even with low-sodium soy sauce and only marinating it for 2 hours. I didn't care for the "smokey soy" taste. I cooked the chicken on my George Foreman grill, and it did look very "pretty" - it makes a great presentation.  Thank you.

This was delicious!  To be honest, when I made the marinade, I wasn't sure because I thought it smelled awful, but it was so good.  I used boneless, skineless chicken thighs.  It was tender, moist and really flavorful. I WILL use it over and over again.

This was ok.  Not spectacular but tasty enough.  It was not half as "pretty" as the picture but otherwise all right.  Will probably make it again.

Very good flavor - Everyone commented on how delicious the chicken was. I used 1Tbsp of liquid smoke as I was afraid of an overpowering taste.  I'll be making this again and again!

Great basic marinade.  Don't need all the soy sauce, just add to taste.  Didn't have liquid smoke, so I used about 1 tablespoon of powdered au jus.  Worked just fine for me!

My family eats chicken 3-4 times a week. This is undoubtably our favorite recipe! Beautiful color, so juicy, and tender enough to cut with a fork!! I let it marinade while we were at work, and then grilled it. It was DELICIOUS! I even made it with regular Soy sauce, and it was just a tiny bit salty. Since I like salty, it was PERFECT. Great recipe, we will make this over and over!!

This was pretty good. I loved it my hubby not so much. I ate chicken quarters with skins on and he had boneless skinless chicken breast. I think the skin makes a difference it really absorbs the marinade. I marinaded over night and had no problem with chicken starting to cook. Just the grill kept flaming up while we cooked it. So the skins were nice and crispy. Just the way I like them. This taste just like our local firemans chicken bbq they have once a year. Now we can have it whenever we want.

Even without the liquid smoke (which doesn't seem to exist in Canadian supermarkets), this marinade was delicious. A little tangy, I might tone down the lemon juice next time.

This was a very good recipe.  I made with chicken legs and boneless breasts.  It was very moist and tasty.  My husband who is not a huge chicken fan even had three legs!  (Usually two is his limit.) Will definitely try again.

WOW!  This was awesome... I loved that I had all the ingredients on hand, so I just added almost 2lbs of organic chicken tenders to the mix (in a ziploc), threw it in the fridge for the afternoon, and it only took me 5 minutes to grill!!  So moist and tasty, my family loved it!  Even my picky toddlers!  Thank you!!!

I made this the other day using chicken quarters and it was very, very good.  I added 1/3 c honey for a touch of sweetness and the chicken was a lovely carmel color.  I am going to make this again tonight using pork tenderlion cutlets and am expecting excellent results once again!  Thanks, Tara!

Loved the flavor of this marinade! I was 1 Tbsp short of liquid smoke but it was still delicious. I was preparing it as shish kebob and had to broil in the oven since it started storming outside.

This was awesome!!!!  Made it exactly the way the recipe is written, EXCEPT I didn't have liquid smoke so substituted McCormicks brown sauce AND added the Asian garlic pepper sauce as recommended.  Marinated it for 4 hours.  Was juicy, tender, and tasty!!  A lil different twist to chicken on the grill.

As I was mixing the ingrediants I became unsure of how it was going to taste.  I'm not one for trying new things and I was serving this to friends and family without a trial run.  I was a little nervous but to my surprise it was a hit and everyone asked for the recipe.  My husband wants his chicken like this from now on!

This was great!!  I always have the problem of grilled chicken being dry, but this was moist and juicy!!  My only change: I only had about half the liquid smoke that was called for.  I will definitely make this again - and again.

I was excited after all the hype and good reviews, but this was not very good.  I made it on the stove instead of on the grill, so maybe that had something to do with it.  I'll keep looking for another chicken marinade.  Thanks anyway.

really good & really easy!  Definitely use the low-sodium soy sauce; I only had regular & the chicken turned out pretty salty.  I also only had a couple drops of liquid smoke, so its flavor wasn't overpowering.  I'll be using this marinade alot!

I love this marinade because it's easy and no-fuss.  It makes terrific chicken and everyone seems to really love the flavor!  I used regular soy sauce...if you're concerned about too much salt, then just marinade it for a shorter amount of time.  I usually stick to a good few hours when I use chicken tenders and 1/2 to 1 day if I use full chicken breasts.  YUMMY!

I have to echo what everyone else has said about this chicken. It is so moist and tasty! I used the leftovers to make an amazing chicken salad. The chicken salad was so good that I'm going to make the chicken again just for the chicken salad. Awesome recipe!

I have made this twice now, once with added brown sugar and once without.  Both times, it was a huge hit with our family and our guests!  I made half the recipe for 4 or 5 chicken breasts, and it was plenty.  Thanks, TaraNicole!

I would not say this is the best chicken marinade ever, but it was really good.  I cooked this twice in a row, the first time marinated for a whole day, room temperature, until we grilled it on the gas in the evening.  Yummi.  Second time the same thing, except this time I sliced the chicken (breasts both times) thinly and made small "steaks" which I then put on sandwiches with some fresh vegetables.  Even yummier than before.  Can very well recomend this one.

Definitely a keeper! There are millions of marinades, why choose this one? Because it has the right ratios of everything. I did add the 2T of brown sugar (as recommended by another reviewer). This is a great "first grill of spring" item! Thanks!

Very nice taste.  Used on 6 chicken breasts and still had marinade leftover.  I ended up using regular soy sauce instead of low sodium which next time I will use.  It was not too salty but I think low sodium would be better.  Thanks

I love, love, love this marinade. I injected the chicken with the marinade and grilled it on the george foreman. They were soooo juicy and tender. I had four chicken breasts left over and I used them in with a basic chicken salad recipe--the marinade made it just amazing! I'm making more tonight, with extra chicken just so I can make more chicken salad! I also used this marinade for steaks...GREAT!

I thought this was a great marinade for chicken and I'm gonna use it again.  My only concern is the cost of using olive oil as opposed to vegetable oil.  I know it has a better flavor but the end result is very much the same if you're not going for a more healthy product.  Given that, 5 stars.  Excellent marinade.

Unless you truely like the taste of soy sauce, than this recipe is not for you.  The soy sauce was overpowering. On a positive note, chicken was very moist. Will not make again.
