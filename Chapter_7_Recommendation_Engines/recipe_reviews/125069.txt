This is a good recipe for that down-home taste.  My only complaint is that putting the lid on to simmer causes the crisp skin to become soggy and greasy.  The second time I made this recipe, I just lowered the heat slightly to prevent burning while the chicken cooked through, and it was perfect!

I haven't made fried chicken in a long time because usually all my crispy skin falls off and ruins the chicken. This was EXCELLENT!  I added paprika, poultry seasoning and garlic salt to the flour mixture for the chicken and used the leftover flour to make the gravy but otherwise followed the recipe and it was delicious. However, it did NOT take 40 minutes--more like 30, and if I'd left it longer it would have burned.  Following the lead of another reviewer, I turned the heat down and left the lid off to keep the chicken crispy.  We'll be having this one again! Thanks!

Yup, that's the way to do it!  You can add your favorite herbs and spices, but nothin's as good as plain ol' fried chicken.  The buttermilk actually tenderizes the chicken!

I used boneless chicken breasts and found this to recipe to be quite flexible with boneless chicken. The buttermilk did a fantastic job at keeping the chicken hydrated and moist even after the cooking time. We enjoyed glazed carrots and stuffing with our chicken and were all left feeling very satiated! I definitely look forward to using this recipe again with bone-in chicken as called for. Great recipe, thanks!

This was very good. I used a pound of boneless skinless chicken breasts and just cut each of them in half--I only cooked them about 10-12 minutes per side total, and didn't cover them, as per one of the reviewers instructions. I also added a little extra salt afterwards. We will definitely be making this again.

I soaked my chicken overnight.  Used Alton Brown's recommended fried chicken spice mixture (I have it premixed so don't remember what's in it) instead of just salt and pepper.  The cooking instructions were weird but I went along with it until the cover on the pan started making my crust soggy then I removed it.  I chose to use all milk in the gravy.  I tried to follow the recipe but I ended up changing everything, sorry!  All in all it was a winning meal, therefore I gave it 4 stars.

I was totally surprised at how tender this chicken was! I marinated it for about 4 hrs in the buttermilk and added cayenne pepper and poultry seasoning to the flour mixture. Turned out very flavorful and very tender!  Also, I just cooked it on med heat until it was done, didnt cover and reduce heat for 45 minutes as I wanted the chicken to stay crispy.  The gravy was so easy to do too.

I rarely make fried chicken, because the outside is usually burned while the inside is raw.  Such was the case the first time I made  this recipe, and it lacked flavor.  The second time around, however, I kicked up the flavor by rubbing garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper, paprika, and poultry seasoning into the chicken before marinating it in two cups of buttermilk for more than three hours.  The same seasonings were used for the flour, to which a small amount of baking powder was added.  As suggested by another reviewer, I fried the chicken until it was golden brown and put it on a rack that was set inside of a baking pan.  I then put the chicken into a preheated 350 degree oven and allowed it to cook through for about 23 minutes.  The end result was crispy, crunchy, flavorful fried chicken.  It was perfect!

I have always felt I wasn't a true southern women because so many times I failed at making fried chicken. All I ever acomplished was having a big greasy mess in the kitchen and really lousy mushy chicken that only the dog would eat. But I seen Vera Reid's recipe and thought I would try one more time and it really was good! The chicken meat was so moist and the skin was crispy (I did listen to the suggestion of keeping the lid off and lowering the fire). Thank you so much for sharing your recipe. I didn't mind cleaning up the mess as my family ate every bite. But the dog isn't happy...

I liked the buttermilk marinade, but I think I'm going to stick to my usual fried chicken.  I clean each piece, rinse under cold water, pat dry.  Then beat 3 eggs, add 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning, mix well.  Prepare 2 cups all purpose flour, 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning.  Mix well.  Dip each piece into the egg mixture, then the flour mixture, then egg mixture, then flour mixture and set the pieces on a tray.  Let sit for about 15 minutes until the coating looks damp.  Heat oil in a cast iron skillet until a drop of water sizzles and pops.  Carefully set the pieces of chicken in the pan so that they aren't touching.  After 5 minutes gently slide the chicken 1/4 turn to make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom.  Reduce heat to medium low and fry approximately 12-15 minutes more, depending on the size of the pieces, Turning ONCE.  Turning only once seems to decrease the amount of grease soaked into the coating.

So easy.  I browned the chicken in canola and olive oil and then put on a rack in the oven at 350.  Came  out absolutely perfect.  So moist and juicy.  Very tender.  This recipe is a keeper.

This made some of the best fried chicken we've eaten. Just like Nini used to make. I was using boneless breasts so I didn't cover it or need to cook as long as specified. I did use chicken broth instead of plain water on the gravy. This made plenty of gravy for mashed potatoes too! Definitely a keeper! Thanks, this is awesome.

Really good, I added a few more seasonings to the flour, such as garlic powder, cayenne pepper, paprika and onion powder, and for the gravy I use chicken broth in place of the water sometimes, it adds a different flavor. I also think letting your chicken rest in the buttermilk overnight adds something to the final outcome. Great fried chicken dish!!!!.

This chicken was so GOOD!!!  The gravy is also great.  I did not cook as long as stated, as I used chicken breasts that I had (not a whole chicken), but it was so delicious.

In theory this was a good recipe and I was very excited about it half way through and then I cut into raw chicken.  The outside was almost burnt, while the inside was still uncooked.  I didn't even have the oil too hot.  I heated it on a temp of 5 and then turned it down to 4 for the 40 minutes.  I had to end up putting it in the oven to finish cooking it and the crispy outside was way overdone by the time the chicken was cooked.  I can't imagine I did anything wrong.  I plan to try it again, but perhaps lower the temperature even more and use smaller pieces of chicken.

The buttermilk gives the chicken a very nice flavor.  I did not use a lid to cook chicken though.  Thanks for the recipe.

I put an egg in with the buttermilk and marinated it for a couple hours in a plastic bag using boneless skinless tenerized chicken breasts.  I added a quarter teaspoon of garlic pwder and a couple dashes of paprika into the flour mixture.  I made the gravy dumping off all but a couple Talbespoons of the grease, 2 large Tablespoons of flour, and added one chicken bouillon cube, 2 Cups 2% milk and no water, it was great.  Kids and adults loved it.

I have made this recipe for years and my family loves it just the way it is.  If you are going to keep this chicken warm in the oven, just keep the lid off slightly so it doesn't get soggy.  I also crimp up tin foil for the bottom of the pan so that the oil can leak out if there is any excess.

I thought it was tasty.  I didn't use as much chicken so the cook time was much faster.  Don't let it sit too long on one side...it might burn some.

We enjoyed the flavor that the buttermilk added, but I used more than one cup for 3 chicken breasts. I added garlic powder and more pepper and needed a little more flour to coat well. I used 1% milk and no water in the gravy.

This is real good. I use milk for a thinner crust than buttermilk. Wasn't crazy about the gravy though.

I noticed another poster said to skin the chicken...Traditional Fried Chicken in NO WAY should be skinned. That is some new psuedo-healthy idea and really defeats the purpose of fried chicken altogether.

A moist and flavorful way to do chicken, especially keeping it so simple.  The gravy was nice too.  Reminded me of good old home cooking.

Very good recipe.  I triple-dredged in flour mixture (egg baths in between) as suggested by a fellow reviewer, and that made for a thick, crispy breading.  I did not cover the chicken while cooking.  I used thin sliced chicken breasts and they came out moist and juicy.  I also tried the suggestion of adding some hot sauce to the buttermilk while marinating but the 1/2-1 tsp I used was not enough to impart any hot sauce flavor to the chicken.  Will definitely make again.

Great results!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and left the cover off.  I also had to use 2 frying pans.  Tasty and crispy!  This recipe is a keeper!

A bit too much work for me, and a lot of mess. It tasted pretty good though. I don't think that it needs to be dredged twice, and the leftovers did not taste good at all.

Pretty good.  I think next time I'll only fry for a few minutes to give a crispy outside, then bake.  It tasted very fatty.

i absolutly found this recipe delicious. however I altered it a bit. i used a deep fryer and I added my own seasonings, because it sounded bland. I used italion seasoning, garlic salt and seasoning salt, and pepper.This is the first time i made a fried chicken and my crust didnt come off...must be because of the buttermilk? I didnt make the gravy this time, but i definitly will next time! yum

Excellent fried chicken! I followed the recipe as printed except I didn't put as much water in the gravy but just added enough to keep it smooth. Served with fresh green beans and homemade buttermilk biscuits and it was a big hit with the family.

I tried this Recipe and it is a bomb! One thing is don't use chicken with the skin on!They don't tell you this in the Recipe. I used skinless breasts and skinned leg's the breast's kinda burned(You gotta watch them closely!) The leg's ended up with all the coating falling off! Make sure you skin it before hand or the coating fall's off! The gravy turned out like ! You definetly need more than a 1/4 cup of dripping's. I would delete the milk it's just too much liquid with the water involved.
