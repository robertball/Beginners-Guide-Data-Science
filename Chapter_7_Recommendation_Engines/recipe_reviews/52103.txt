I loved the taste of these, but the dough was a little tricky. Maybe I didn't make it correctly. It was a little hard on the outside of the roll-ups. I wonder what could make is softer? Basting during cooking? The insides and bottom were delicious and soft like a dumpling. I thought the apple would make it too sweet, but not at all. I used a tarter apple. 

Also, being a vegetarian, I left out the bacon and bouillon, and I think the recipe was perfect without it. But, for those who eat meat, this would also be good with tiny bits of sausage inside. Maybe some leftover brats would work good. 

My family was mystified by them, but I'll think I'll make them again. I need to work on the rolling up proceedure to get it a little tighter.

I did use less sauerkraut and more apple. I cut the recipe in half and only used 8 oz. kraut. Good stuff and a nice change.

These were delicious!  I made them for a World Cup party where everyone had a different Country.  I did modify them a bit based on other suggestions.  First, the dough was really dry with the amount of water suggested so I had to add a little more.  About 3/4-1 cup of water.  Then, I flipped them halfway through so both sides of the dough could bake in the juice.  This one second place out of 25 dishes!

The filling was absolutely delicious, but the dough was very hard.  I tried putting a foil sheet over them during baking to make them softer, but to no luck.  However, the leftover dough fried up was delicious.

This is based on the changes I made, so take it with a grain of salt. Based on the reviewers comments, I halved the filling, but only reduced dough by 1/3 (so 3 C flour, 1.5 tsp salt, 2 eggs). I used a little more than 2/3 C water to get the dough workable. I also made it gluten-free, so I used an all-purpose gluten free mix, 1 tsp xanthum gum, and 1 tbsp full fat yogurt to compensate for the lack of gluten. I flipped half way through baking. Like everyone else said, without flipping, the dough would have been too hard on top and too gooey on the bottom. I had leftover filling, so I should have simply halved the filling and left the dough quantity the same. This was really good and we'll definitely make it again.

Made this for our New Year pork and kraut dinner.  Everyone liked it and want to have it again.  Like many others stated the dough was hard. I had a very hard time rolling the dough out thin enough.  I had a lot of the kraut mixture left over. Next time I will make more of a pastry dough.

This recipe came out pretty good, dough and all.  But there are some issues I had with the recipe.  First, 1/2 cup of water and 2 eggs is nowhere near enough to bring the dough together.  You'll need to add some more water for the flour to come together.  Second, the recipe tells you to use the juice from the kraut, but doesn't tell you a.) how much to use, and b.) whether to use it from the opened can or bag of kraut or from the simmering juices that naturally come from the cooked ingredients.  I went with the cooked fluid.  The only other thing I would say is that the taste of bacon, and apple got subsumed by the intensity of the saurkraut.  Even with this however, the things were delicious, and we ate all of them.  I am now "tweaking" the recipe, and going to try experimenting, and I'll post what I did, and if I thought it was worth the changes I am making.
