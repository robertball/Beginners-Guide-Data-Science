Me and the Wife love it!  We also like to make Sekanjabin as well!  Both are REEEEALLLLYYYY good! .

. One suggestion though... instead of tossing out that LOVELY strawberry mash after you strain and squish out as much juice as possible...

. MAKE FRUIT LEATHER!!!

Very yummy! I became addicted to McDonalds strawberry iced tea,but it was getting to be an expensive habit. I decided to find a recipe for strawberry syrup to make my own tea and this one fit the bill! I didn't add the whole two cups of sugar, but cut it down to 1 1/2 cups as I don't like things too sweet. Perfect, perfect perfect. Will be using this recipe again and again.

Simply awesome. .. I used Splenda. ... so I didn't reheat the second time. ... Splenda dissolves without the need to reheat.... and slipped up and forgot to cut them into smaller pieces. .... still turned out great. ...  now I just need to experiment with heating times to make it more concentrated. ... so I can use it in my 6 to 1 ratio soda fountain.

Made this for our sodastream. Love it, instead of sugar I used a no calorie sweetener. :)

We made this recipe and absolutely love it.   We used it for Summer lemonade.  We used it in the fall over ice-cream.  At Christmas, we made everything we could think of strawberry.  It was great tasting and easy to make. Can't wait until next year to make more!

This recipe worked perfectly. I wanted a unique drink for a summer tea party, and it had to be pink! I added this to 2 L of club soda and made the best strawberry soda anyone had ever had!

We Love it, have made it many times to go in my sun tea. I have substituted different  types of fruit and it's awesome.   I find 2 cups of sugar to be too much for me, so I cut it in half. Gives a good fruit flavor without being overpoweringly sweet. Chef John is inspiring and is good at making everything look easy.

Way yummier than I would expect for 3 simple ingredients! My advice is to freeze some syrup in ice cube trays. You can add however many cubes right into a pitcher of drinks in the future. I used homegrown strawberries for the best flavor and color. Because they were so sweet already I did add less sugar. Thank you!

Delicious! I made a half-recipe with a pound of cheap, not all that ripe strawberries from Aldi and it turned out great. We made strawberry soda and strawberry lemonade. Very refreshing.

Delicious.  I used fresh strawberries I had frozen in the summertime in attempt to clear out my freezer.  Halfway through boiling I used a potato masher to crush down the berries to release more flavor.  This will be perfect to use with our SodaStream machine instead of using the expensive syrups.

I hate to waste things such as the strawberry pulp so I used it to make a strawberry nut bread much like banana nut bread. I do not have a ready recipe for it yet as I am still experimenting but it tastes pretty good now. My latest experiment uses some honey for added sweetening.  Also I have tried strawberry corn bread.  Just some ideas...
