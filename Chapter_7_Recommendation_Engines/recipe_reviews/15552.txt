This is a good dip for veggie's, just a little bland for me.  I tasted then adjusted more to our taste before serving, added more onion, a little garlic salt, and garlic powder, returned to frige for another hour, had more flavor.  I think when I make this again, I will use equal parts of yogurt and sour cream.

I liked this as a dip for veggies.  One change I would make is adding more spices such as pepper.  It was a bit to yogurty for me.

This dip is great! I increased the vegetable ingredients from one tsp to 2 or 3.

A very good vegetable dip, once I had made some adjustments:
I added a 1/4 cup nonfat mayo, fresh mint, salt and pepper, and 1 minced garlic clove.  I omitted the celery salt.  I also blended the dip in a food processor to get an even consistency. It turned out quite delicious and my guests enjoyed it!

I am eating clean in 2010 and I made this sauce to go along with the Spicy Turkey Burgers from this site. I omitted the sour cream because I didn't have any on hand and I still loved it.

Very tasty and no one knew it was made "low fat".  This is the dip we use for vegetables now.

This very basic dip can be adapted as needed. I spiced mine up a little with some more fresh herbs and cayenne pepper.  Really liked the celery salt!

Very nice dip, good for veggies, salad dressing and sandwich spread instead of plain mayo. I will  make this again.

Super good. Didn't had celery salt so I added garlic salt. Used this as a dip for Burek. DIP SAVED THE MEAL.
