I certainly didn't need a recipe for this - 'been eating it all my life and there's a reason for that.  It's wonderful.  This is not so much a review as it is a commentary to get more people to try it.  I came across this recipe while looking for something else and noticed only one person had reviewed it and that was in 2007 - years ago! This is truly old-fashioned Italian cooking, tho' I suppose every Italian family makes this a little differently.  We don't add green pepper or parsley, for instance, but I'm sure that would be delicious.  Grandma and Mom always cooked the heck out of this but to "update" it for today's tastes I cook it until tender, but still somewhat firm.  We also slice rather than cube the zucchini, but I'm sure it's good that way too. While it's not traditional, I added fresh mushrooms today - because I had them and, well, because I love 'em.  Not necessary to measure anything, just cook and add everything to your heart's content.  Parmesan is optional - this is delicious with or without.

I have been making this for years and it is my favorite way to cook zucchini. I typically make this in a casserole. Layer the sliced zucchini and onions (I typically omit the green peppers) with salt and pepper and parmesean cheese. Cover the top layer with sliced tomatoes and microwave for about 20-25 minutes or until tender. I have also added a layer of cheese on top for the last 5 minutes if you want a cheesy sauce but it is delicious without that addition.

This was an excellent, yet easy way to make zucchini taste great!  I did tweak the recipe a bit, by cooking 2 slices of bacon and then using a tablespoon of the bacon grease to cook the onion, rather than the olive or vegetable oil.  I added the bacon, crumbled, to the pan when I added the zucchini and other vegetables.  Even my kids said that the recipe was really good!

Always a winner!  I have been making variations of this for years.  This time I tried to follow this recipe as closely as I could.  I didn't have romas so I used whole grape tomatoes and instead of green pepper I used a mix of yellow and orange.  This is such a colorful dish and the flavors of all the vegetables work together beautifully.  And another bonus is that it's a snap to make and it's on the table in no time.

As a full-time working mom of two kids, I need fast, easy and good... this fit the bill! My husband was saying "Hey that smells good, what is it??" I didn't have a green pepper on hand nor the parsley, but no matter. It still came out pretty good. I also added a chopped shallot to the onion in the beginning. I think freshly shredded Parmesan at the end would have been a whole lot better than the grated version I used. But overall, easy and good. And a good use for all the zucchini I get in my weekly organic box! Would be great on top of angelhair pasta, which I'll try next.

Just made this dish.  It smelled so good my roommate, Maggie, demanded to eat some.  I didn't peel the tomatoes, and I threw in a Serrano pepper from the garden.  Turned out great and will definately make it again.

This was so good!   I will definitely be making this again in the future.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I added a can of diced fire roasted tomatoes.  I also added and extra clove of garlic, 1 tsp of Italian seasoning, sliced baby bella mushrooms, and I used all of the green pepper.

I didn't measure the ingredients, but I used all the right veggies and it was delicious.  It will be a regular on our menu from now on.

This is incredible! Served with homemade linguine and a ton of fresh herbs. Also had to cook the zucchini covered for a little longer than recommended to fully soften. It was delicious though. I will definitely be making this again!

Really delicious and easy.  I'm always looking for something healthy to do with veggies other than just steaming them.   And this is very healthy...  doesn't need much olive oil at all.  The 1st time I made this with grape tomatos & no peppers (just because I didn't have any in the house)...  I just made it again last night with one regular tomato, chopped & a red bell pepper.  I have to say, the pepper adds a lot of flavor... I highly recommend adding it.  As for the tomatos, they get a little soggy, so I think the plum ones would work best, buit really, you can use any kind you have.  Overall, a light, pretty, delicious, and easy side dish that would work with any type of meal.  My 4 year old & my husband love it too!

LOVED this! If you grow a summer garden you most likely will have the other veggies in it. This was the best zucchini I've ever made. The combinated simmers together nicely. I will be making this again!

Very quick and easy to make. Sprinkled a little Italian seasoning because I didn't have fresh parsley. Lots of flavor. Tossed with pasta for a delicious dinner. Will definitely be making this over and over again.

Fantastic, easy.  I did two things though. In the last 4 minutes, I added a tablespoon of butter to the pan and added the garlic in the last 2 minutes.

Nice jumping off point to use up the veggies I get each week from my community-sponsored agriculture group:  added portabella mushrooms (3 large ones, sliced), a tsp of oregano, a tsp of basil, and aduki beans (1/2 can, rinsed) b/c we are vegetarians & I wanted it to have complete protein with the risotto I made in my rice cooker (1 cup aborio rice with a pat of butter and 2 cups of vegetable broth - Pacific is good).  Was delicious.  Used more Parm than original called for and had to use dried herbs.  Oh, threw in about a handful of fresh spinach leaves just before serving too.  Yumm!  Looking forward to the leftovers.

This is a wonderful dish, I really enjoy how all the flavors blend together. Next time I will add a tablespoon or 2 of dry white wine and some fresh oregano. I love being able to go to the garden to select all the ingredients to make an entire meal  - fast, easy to prepare meal. A slice of sourdough completes this meal for my vegetarian son.

Yum - I don't use zucchini too often, but this is a great addition to the veggie rotation! It was quick and easy, yet still something I would serve to guests.

OMG, soooo good, doubled recipe, chopped onion, and used canned plum tomatoes and chopped them-since they have a little bit more sauce canned, and cooked down quicker leaving the zucchini crisp and fresh. Then... added 2 cups cooked plain cous cous, and a pinch of grated romano-making this a complete side dish. Picky two year old ate it up!!!

I substituted mushrooms for the bell pepper, chopped the onions and sliced the zucchini.  Next time I will slice the onions and cut the zucchini slices into quarters.   Mushrooms also cut into quarters.  Forgot the parmesan cheese!

Really, really yummy. I did use one whole leek that I bought from Trader Joe's the day before, chopped red pepper (we don't care for green peppers in this house), 2 tsp. of Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute and at the last minute, I used 2 tbsp. balsamic vinegar. (Don't you just LOVE balsamic? I swear, I could drink it, it's so good.) We have one little quarter cup left, even doubling the recipe. This might be my new summer salad recipe! NOTE: I should add that I didn't read the instructions and I did not cook this recipe. It was a happy mistake because I think it was perfect that way.

This is a great and simple recipe for a side dish.  It is great as described.  For extra zip add a packet of zesty Italian dressing mix.  YUMMY  The family always asks for seconds.  It rarely makes it to the leftover pile.  This is also super flexible.  I have added kale, chard and other greens in conjunction and it never fails.

YUM, YUM, YUM!
Used two small zucchini's and an extra garlic clove. I did not have green pepper so I omitted it. I let it cook twice as long for a less crisp zucchini.   I mixed the parsley in at the end and probably used more than 1 tablespoon of parmesean.

Delicious, but I'm not sure how someone could do all that prep in 5 minutes! Allow for a bit more time!

Yum Yum Yummy! Only thing I omitted was tomatoes, since I didn't have any. Used Asiago cheese. I will be making this again!

I was searching for something different to do with my zucchini when I came across this recipe. I doubles it, since zucchini happens to be a family favorite. I also used dried parsley instead of fresh, because I had forgotten to pick fresh parsley up at the store. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee, and YUM! I was not disappointed! It went perfectly with the chicken parmesan I made! This will definitely be added to the recipe book for future meals.

For only two in the house, 6 zucchini plants are not necessary so I have had to find recipe after recipe.  I love this one.  I didn't have Parmesan or fresh parsley so I substituted fresh basil and Asiago cheese.  YUMMY

Great healthy recipe!  I did substitute red pepper, since that's what I had on hand, and didn't bother peeling the tomatoes. We sure did enjoy this one, and I'm looking forward to trying it with other variations.

This is so incredibly simple and delicious.  I added crushed red pepper and more italian seasoning.  In addition to parmesan, I added a little asiago cheese.  This has become a staple for week night cooking.

Great veggie side dish.  It did pale in comparison to all the other yummy things on the Thanksgiving table, but don't veggies always do that?  I would make this again and probably like it better when there's not so much daunting competition.

What a great dish!  Had all of the ingredients in my CSA this week.  Can't say I really changed anything, the recipe is simple and good.  I served it over pasta for myself (vegetarian) and as a side dish to my son's pork chop.

The entire family loved this!  We scaled the portions to make enough for the entire family, and it turned into a really hearty side, resembling a chunky vegetarian minestrone.  My son, who claims he's allergic to vegetables, asked for seconds.  I added a teaspoon of sugar to cut back on the bite of the tomatoes.  I also added 50% more garlic and pepper.  YUM!

I had one zucchini in the fridge and I didn't know how to cook it. Looked it up here and came upon this recipe. I used what I had in the fridge. Used yellow bellpepper instead of green, added some mushrooms.  It came out great!!!

Such a simple recipe and so easy.   Have been making a very similar one for years (especially when zucchini are in season).    Granted have made changes over time and usually add a lot of fresh basil when I have it plus some hot pepper flakes.  Highly recommend for a quick side dish or as a vegetarian meal.

A yummy use for lots of CSA veggies and very easy.  I disagree with the 2T of green pepper though, that seems wrong - why bother with just 2T?  I like green pepper so I put in more, half a green pepper.  I also accidentally made it without the green pepper (oops!) and it was also very good.

This was quite possibly the best use of zucchini and summer squash we could eat.  So easy and so tasty.  Hubby loved it.   This will definitely go into the rounds at dinner.

This was a great way to enjoy my abundance of zucchini and roma tomatoes!  The only change I made was to add some freshly grated, organic, raw, cheddar cheese on top right before serving instead of grated parmesan cheese.  Delicious!

My family demands all italian meals be loaded with garlic (they are obviously afraid of vampires), so I saute'd about 4 cloves worth of garlic with the onion and zucchini.  I did not seed the zucchini as it didn't say to do so in the recipe, but I don't think it would make a difference. I made such a huge batch I am happy to say we had leftovers. And, like so many italian dishes, this was even better the next day.

Great way to use up some zucchini from the garden.  I followed the recipe pretty closely but I think I will make some changes for next time.   Adding bacon sounds delicious and I will be adding more peppers.  Also I recommend fresh parmesan cheese.

Used seasoning salt, omitted tomatoes, soya and breadcrumbs. Was awesome. Leaving out the breadcrumbs made it a low-carb recipe that I need for my diet! So simple yet so good that even my husband who doesn't like zucchini loved it.

This is basically a Ratatouille without the green beans and eggplant. My wife makes a custom version with veggies fresh from our garden throughout the summer. One reviewer said they thought it would be good over pasta... It is awesome...especially with some fresh grated Parmesan or Emmental.

LOVE IT! I am so happy I found this recipe when I was looking for a way to prepare some zucchini a neighbor had given me. Zucchini isn't a regular staple around here and I really didn't know what to do with it other than grilling and zucchini bread. It was excellent! I had a second helping and was picking at the leftovers while I was putting it away. I left out the green pepper because I didn't have any and added fresh mushrooms. Other than that I didn't change a thing. My husband agrees that this is definitely a keeper.

So good!  I added a little bit of chopped fresh parsley.  Otherwise made as directed.  We loved it!  Thanks!

Very good.  I am not a big fan of fresh tomatoes but I had some leftover from another recipe and needed a way to use them.  This was a great way to do that.  I would definitely recommend this as a great side dish.

This is one of my favorites! I change the recipe a little depending on what’s in my kitchen or what I’m in the mood for. I usually serve it over bow tie pasta or with orzo.

I made this as a side dish for dinner tonight, and both my husband and I thought it was really good.  The only thing I would do differently next time is add another clove of garlic. I didn't peel the tomatoes either (as another reviewer said), and used an orange pepper instead of green.  It turned out great. Nice to make something that's good for you and delicious too!

We love this recipe! The secret to keeping the flavors robust is to just cook everything lightly and serve it right away. I start the garlic in the olive oil while I chop the onion, then add that. I start chopping the zucchini right away and add it as soon as it's ready (I prefer half-circle slices). Then I cube the tomato and toss that in with fresh parsley, salt, and pepper. I let it cook while I toss it for just a minute or so, then serve with just a bit of parmesan. I don't feel like it needs the bell pepper; the colors and texture and flavors are perfect anyway!

love this recipe! I've been making a version of it for years, I usually don't add the green pepper but it gives it a nice bit of color, also I add some balsamic vinegar to the pan and I don't cook it for very long because I like the zucchini with a little crunch.

So easy and great tasting.  I sliced the zucchini and a small yellow pepper.  A wonderful way to use garden fresh zucchini, tomatoes, and peppers.  Thanks for sharing !!

So Easy! I don't cook with zucchini very often, but a friend gave me some and I was looking for a side dish - this was awesome! I used canned tomatoes with Italian herbs and I left out the bell peppers and parm. Still so yummy and its so adaptable!

This was delicious. I had a ton of cherry tomatoes from my garden, so I substituted cherry tomatoes for the romas. I used fresh cilantro instead of parsley, and threw in a bit of fresh basil. Fantastic. Making it again tonight. Great for lunch, side dish or over pasta.
