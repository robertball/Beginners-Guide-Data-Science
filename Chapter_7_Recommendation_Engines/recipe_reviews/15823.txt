Melt some Kraft caramels, put about 1 tsp caramel and 1/2 tsp chpped pecans on top of nilla wafer before adding cheesecake mixture bake as usual, just before completely cool, top with a little melted milk chocolate chips, drizzle with a little more caramel and sprinkle few more pecans. OH MY GOSH YUMMY!

I have been making these since the early 1970's and it has been one of my most requested recipes of all time. You can certainly create a lower fat version by using lite cream cheese, fat free vanilla wafers and lite cherry pie filling. I have used blueberry and strawberry pie filling as toppings too, however the cherry remains the most popular. It's a very nice presentation to do a variety of toppings however, and there are endless possibilities. One tip I have is to make a day ahead of time and refrigerate overnight (without any topping) and then add the cherry pie filling after thoroughly chilled. Just seems to work better and it is easier for you (or your guests) to remove the muffin paper. I don't add sweet cream cheese or whipped cream to the top, they are flavorful and PLENTY sweet enough as is. Love that this is a nice individual serving, sure to get rave reviews ~

What a tasty little treat! I used mini muffin tins and baking cups. I cut the wafer down to fit in a mini cup. I also made my own rasp. puree to put on top, then I topped with whipped cream. I made these for my niece's bridal shower and they were a hit.

This was gobbled up!  I made a graham crust for them instead of the wafers with 9 graham crackers, 1 T. sugar, and 2 T. butter.  I put 1 T. in each cup and pressed down.  I used a spoonful of blueberry jam on top of each and then a dab of whipped cream.

O My Gosh, These mini cheese cakes are the perfect New York style which is somewhat dense but never creamy. I made over 100 of these for a benefit and they were eaten quickly. I used 1/2 package of graham crackers for the crumb mixture and used 1 rounded tbs. of crumbs in the bottom of the paper liners. I also sprayed the liners lightly for easy removal. Then, topped half with cherry pie filling and half with semi sweet melted chocolate. If you want to serve individual cakes, use larger muffin tins, skip the crumbs and freeze the cakes until serving. The paper peels off the frozen cakes easily. I did bake about 8 minutes longer the suggested time. When they start to crack open on top, they are done.

I do NOT know how to cook, nor do I know a good recipe when I see one.  Based on all the reviews I tried this one for my annual wine party and they were phenomenal.  My husband loves cheesecake and thought it was a very good recipe.  So easy too!  I used the small muffin tins and it yielded about 48 mini cheesecakes that were simply ravishing!  Highly recommended

I made these for a fourth of July party and they were a big hit. I decorated them half with blueberry and half with cherry filling for a festive look.  I doubled the recipe which yielded 36 mini cheesecakes. I recommend making them the night before to let them set in the refrigerator.  They are much better by the next day.

This is one of the most versatile recipes I have ever found. It is so easy and yet so impressive for any holiday party. I have not read thru all the reviews but I have a few alternatives that I have tried with much success. First I never use lemon juice, I substitute vanilla instead. Add 1/4 cup cocoa to the mixture and use crushed up oreos for the base then top with 3 white and milk swirled choc. chips when they come out of the oven, so cute and satisfied the chocolate lovers in the family. I have also baked the fruit filling right in the mix because I made these for cookie trays for people at work and was worried about them tipping over and making a mess. One more, use ginger snaps as a base add 1/4 cup of pumpkin, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice ( or equivelent) and top with small dolops of whipped cream.

Fabulous and wonderfully versatile! I have made Bailey's Irish Cream cheesecakes by omitting the lemon juice, adding 3 Tb Irish cream, and 2 Tb sour cream. After they cool, I brush the tops with a little more Irish Cream, and no one can get enough! Of course, the fruit topped minis are lovely, as well, made according to directions.  They can be made chocolate by sprinkling the bottoms of the papers with crushed Oreos, eliminating the lemon juice and stirring 1/2 cup of melted chocolate chips and 1/4 tsp vanilla into the filling. To dress those up even further, I have been known to top the Oreo crumbs with 1 tsp hot fudge sauce, then pour the topping in. Also lovely is a grasshopper version, using the Oreo crumbs, and in place of the lemon juice, add 2 Tb green creme de menthe and 1 Tb creme de cacao. I will sometimes even fold mini chocolate chips into this one. The possibilities are literally limitless. Simple to make, even simpler to eat! These freeze like champs. A+++

This turned out great.  I even substituted the full fat cream cheese with half fat free and half low fat.  It was still great.

This was sooooooooooo good. I live with three guys and they gobbled these little cakes up. I don't cook so this was a little surprise for them. We all loved it and i will make this again. The only thing I changed with this recipe is the crust. Instead of the vanilla waffer (which occasionally gets soft and soggy) I crush up some graham crackers, mix it with some melted butter and then place it in cupcake cup holders. Then place the cream cheese mixture on top. Then cook. Good with or with out toppings :)

These turned out amazing.  Made them for a friend's birthday and they were really received well.  Didn't change a thing from the recipe measurements.  Definately a keeper...thanks for the post.

I was looking for a recipe for my daughter to make for her class at school.  She was able to make these bite size cheesecakes in just a short time, and they were delicious.  Her brothers got upset when she did not leave any behind for them. She came home with rave reviews, and requests for MORE.

I have made these several times and they are perfect every time. One thing I did that was different was I used bite size Nilla Wafer, but, you have to be using the miniature muffin pan, or otherwise it won't work.This has always been a no fail recipe for me. When using the "mini" pan, you will get about 72 "mini" cheesecakes.  Follow the recipe, bake no longer than 20 min. if using the mini pan.

Excellent.  I added an extra tablespoon of lemon juice and one teaspoon of vanilla to intensify the flavor, then added a tablespoon of flour to help firm the consistency and they came out perfect.   The lemon flavor is so nice that these cheesecakes don't need any topping at all.  For a different version, I omitted the lemon juice and then stirred in a half bag of mini chocolate chips after mixing.  Used half an oreo cookie for the crust at bottom of each paper cup (twist oreo cookie in half, place in cup with frosting side up...be sure you keep the frosting on the half cookie!), then sprinkled coarsely ground oreos on top before putting in oven.  The oreo cookie crust softened while baking and the overall result was unbelievably delicious.  I double up on the liner cups because one alone is too flimsy.

If a cheesecake is over-baked it cracks.  A properly cooked cheesecake, even these mini ones should still be wiggly in the middle when it is done, it has to have time to set up. They look underdone but they are not.  I cooked these exactly as written, my oven though takes 18 min., at that time I turned off the heat and opened the oven door and let them finish for 1 - 1 1/2 hrs. This is how I cook all of my cheesecake recipes!  I do believe that they could have been transferred to a rack to cool and set up fine.  Then I transferred to the fridge over night and they set up beautifully, no cracks or indents.  These are delicious and can be topped so many different ways.  I got exactly 12 out of this.  Thank You Ginny!

This is a great recipe!  It was really simple to make and I even made them in bulk.  I managed to make about 80 for a party...
A tip: If you want to make chocolate chip cheesecakes, don't put in large chocolate chips.  Make sure you chop up the chips so that it blends in well.  it tastes fantastic!  I also used an oreo cookie crust which turned out pretty well.  They're best out of the fridge.

I have been making these for over 30 years!  They are delicious!  I usually make 48 at a time.  We eat 24 or so and I freeze the rest.  Remove from freezer about 1/2 hour before serving.  They are good with whatever topping you choose.  I like cherry pie filling, but any flavor you choose would be perfect!

I followed the recommendations of many others here and tweaked this recipe to what I think is now perfection! I used one cup sugar vs the 2/3 cup listed. For the crust, I made half of the mini cakes using the Nilla wafers as directed and the other half using Graham Crackers by mixing crushed graham crackers, tiny chips of pecans and a bit of melted butter to hold it all together. I put 1/2 tsp of crust into each "mini" muffin.  As many of you indicated, the Graham Cracker crust is MUCH better, especially with the pecans added! For the topping, I just added a raspberry on top which tasted great but did not have anything to "hold" it on. Next time, I will either add a bit of cool whip or use pie filling as a topping. These mini cheesecakes are delicious. You will love them!

Great recipe but requires attention and caution! My first batch did not work at all. The filling was lumpy and didn't mix well at all. That caused the vanilla wafers to "float" up into the middle of the cheesecakes. The flavor was good though. So, when I tried again, I made sure to cream the cream cheese alone at first and made sure it was very smooth. Then added the other ingredients. I tried doing a crumb crust with cookie crumbs and butter, but found that wasn't a great combination since the butter soaked through the cupcake papers. Otherwise, when prepared correctly, these are tasty and very cute.

These were very very good. I made then for valentines day and they were a hit! I cut a small lemon in half and used the juice from one of the halves (be careful not to get any seed in the batter). I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla. I used strawberry as my topping. I bought the frozen strawberries that come in a tub. I let it defrost and blended them into a smooth consistency and poured a little onto each cheesecake. The tub of strawberries are already perfectly sweet so I didn't add any sugar. Delicious. I will definitely be making these again.

I added 1tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp almond extract, and the flavor was amazing! Very Smooth and easy to make. I made my own graham cracker crust with one plastic package of grahams and 6 tablespoons of butter, and 3 Tbls of sugar. Loved it!

Oh, wow. Like many others, I used a graham crust for this (couldn't tell you proportions, I made it on the fly). I halved the recipe, used neufchatel cheese (1/3 less fat than cream cheese), a drop or so of vanilla extract, and used a little less lemon juice than called for. I also added about a tablespoon of light cream, and about 1/4 teaspoon of flour. I didn't use the cherry pie filling and I didn't use paper liners, just greased the cups really well.  No problems with sticking. My cakes cracked a tad, but that's my tempermental and inaccurate oven. My advice: DO NOT try or rate these until after you have chilled them overnight. I had some the night I made them and was at first disappointed since they tasted eggy and the texture was way too soft. HOWEVER, I put the rest in the fridge, and the next morning they were fantastic; better (in my opinion) than the Cheesecake Factory in terms of taste AND texture. I ate some plain and some with a little raspberry preserves. I was very pleased, and my husband has requested them again.

GREAT RECIPE! Such a HIT with GROUPS. People request these from me for their birthday, party, Thanksgiving.... you name it. After may times of making these I did customize just a little...

1. Add Vanilla Extract (2 TBL)
2. Use 1/3 Fat cream cheese (Trust me you will not know the difference and it brings the calories WAY down.)
3. Try 1 batch with an OREO cookie at the bottom
4. Not a fan of cherry pie filling so I slice a few strawberries thing and "fan" them on top. You can even roll the strawberries in sugar first. yum yum.

Anyway, thanks for a great recipe!

I tried to make this recipe - twice.  The time should be extended to at least 30 minutes, or until lightly brown.  I baked this recipe and each time, the center fell.  I tried for a third time at 30 minutes and it worked perfectly.

These were delicious and easy. clean up was effortless. I ate almost half when I was "testing" them. If you refrigerate for 2 hours before serving, they are magical! I came home from work the next day , mouth watering for one and all that was left was an empty cupcake pan in the frig!!! thanks hubby!xoxo

This recipe turned out great for me. I changed it right off into a cookies and cream cheesecake, adding lots of chopped oreo cookies in the crust and using a whole cookie in the bottom of each cup. The texture was awesome and the small portions were perfect. Thanks so much for sharing.

When people asked me for this recipe, I always joked that it was the "Noah's Arc" of recipes, everything by 2's. These little cakes were so delicious and I usually have everything needed on hand to get the job done. Make sure you have a really good mixer, this will incorporate lots of air and make the cakes light and fluffy. Not to mention, there will be more batter.  More batter=less calories per cake and more cakes!

The flavor of these is great, not too sweet, which is a lovely match for the sweet pie filling. My only complaint is the vanilla wafer got a bit soggy. Still taste good, though! This recipe will easily make 2 dozen, not 1, and I did have to cook my cakes a few minutes longer to get them to set. The middles sank when I pulled them out, but it provides a nice space for the filling. I didn't have much trouble getting the wrappers off once they cooled like some did, probably because I waited until they were completely cool before trying. Give these a try!

I found a jar of pineapple topping in the fridge at school. The crew and I had been working our fingers to the bone and we deserved a TREAT!  I found flat macaroons at the market and used those in loo of Nilla wafers, I filled the tins nearly full and added the pineapple to them BEFORE I baked them. Omg sooo YUMMY. The ladies LOVED them!!  I got 1 but well worth it! Thanks Ginny, these are super easy and I will defiantly make these again:)

These are great! I tripled the recipe for a group of about 20. It made 45 cheesecakes and they were all gone! I topped mine with strawberries and also did a batch with mini chocolate chips and an oreo instead or vanilla wafers. Yum!

Been making these for many years. They are nice for entertaining, showers, holidays, etc. I like to top them with fresh fruit and then glaze with a warm apricot jam. So pretty & always well-liked. Try kiwi & blueberries, raspberries & blackberries, sliced strawberries, etc.

My husband liked these, but I did not.  They stuck to the paper cups and they seemed to burn around the wafter.... Not like NY Cheesecake at  all.  They do look nice on my holiday platters but I do not think I will make these again.

I'm giving these a 4 because of how cute they look, how easy they are to make, and because of all the toppings you could do with this recipe.  The taste is probably between a 3 and 4.  Ok, but nothing to rave about.  I did make a graham cracker crust like many reviews stated.

These are a great dessert to take to a party, everybody gets their own little treat. I do the cherry pie filling to top them, yummy. It is fun to pair these with other small desserts like cut up brownies, pecan tarts, or any other mini sweet treat.

I must say I agree with all the high praise and ratings, these are easy to make and delicious to eat. One thing to note though: I doubled the recipe, and only ended up using 1 can of cherry pie filling. I had about 5 or 6 that didn't get cherries on top, but those got eaten just as quickly. Next time I make this I will probably use mini cups instead of regular ones as the vanilla wafer only fills about 2/3 of the regular size baking cups.

These turned out wonderful! I made some changes though, I used an oreo on the bottom instead of vanilla wafers and put crushed oreos on the top as a garnishment. I also used the foil cupcake wrappers. Make sure you chill them for a while before pealing the paper off, otherwise it will stick to the cupcake wrappers. I took them to work and everyone loved them, I didn't have to take a single one home! Great recipe!

Well, I was a little confused about the serving size. I didn't realize that this recipe makes 12 regular sized muffin tin cheesecakes. I was after the 'mini' cheesecakes that would be bite sized and I wanted to put them on a buffet table. So I doubled the recipe hoping for 24 mini cheesecakes! I ended up with over 60! That's OK, there were only about a dozen left behind at the end of the evening. These are so good and the fresh lemon juice makes the recipe outstanding.

I love to make cheesecake but have difficulty with cracking and cooking time. A friend requested cheesecake for his going away party so my search on allrecipes.com began. I found these mini cheesecakes and have used it at least a dozen times since. I did make graham cracker crust instead of the nilla wafers, this was my ONLY change. The lemony taste was wonderful for the hot summer night. I have since changed it up a bit by omitting the lemon and adding whatever I wanted like mini chocolate chips and even spreading a little raspberry jam on top of the graham crust prior to filling. This is an excellent cheesecake that I will keep in my box for years.

I have made these a couple times and the requests keep comming. They are easy and amazing. I used a nilla wafer in the bottom but I like it to be a little more crusty so next time I will make some graham cracker crust and do it that way. I also did it in a watter bathe. I had a cookie sheet full of watter under the cheese cake to make sure it cooked all the way without drying or splitting. They were perfect!

I made these for a bridal shower and they were a hit. Definitely cook these for 20 minutes instead of 15-17 or they are mushy. I love the fact that they use vanilla wafers that fit perfectly in the muffin pan! I might add a little vanilla extract next time too

These are delicious and easy to make.  This recipe uses slightly less sugar than some others I've used, and it makes for a nice little cheesecake, not too sweet.  This is my favorite pick for a baby shower - "baby" cheesecakes!

I made these for my son who is a  9 y/o cheese cake lover. He said they were "OK." Not what I had hoped for. But I thought they were pretty darn good! Very, very simple to make. And I love the fact that the recipe can be divided easily to make only 1 or 12 mini-cheesecakes. I think these are perfect when entertaining a large crowd.

Great easy recipe.  I took Sweetslady's suggestion and I made a graham crust for them instead of the wafers with 9 graham crackers, 1 T. sugar, and 2 T. butter. I put 1 T. in each cup and pressed down. I used a spoonful of cherry pie filling and little whipped cream on top.  Hubby loved them...daughter liked them better plain!  Thanks for the recipe...keeper!

Simple to make and delicious! Make them a day ahead and refrigerate them overnight--it makes a difference. Warm cheesecake never seems sweet enough, but it really is just right when it is cold.

I made these this weekend to take to a friends house for dessert.  My husband is allergic to gluten so I used 9 crushed gluten free graham crackers, a bit of cinnamon, butter and sugar as suggested by another user.  They were delicious.  Our friends never would have guessed they were gluten/flour free and my husband did not feel his was missing out!  I topped each with a fresh fanned out strawberry instead of pie filling. They were the perfect delicious dessert after a big meal.  I will make these over and over again.  Easy and delicous.

I have cheesecake connoisseurs in our house so I tried a couple different versions. Normally we love the graham crumb base for our cheesecakes but with these, the vanilla wafer tastes great and is so QUICK and EASY to do. We prefer the cheesecake till just blended, instead of fluffy, so it has the more New York thicker cheesecake texture. 

Our favorite combo was the following:
 Vanilla Wafer base, melted Kraft caramel (finicky but worth it), thick cheesecake, melted chocolate on top then topped with the cherry mixture. These ones look very pretty.

Our second favorite would be drizzling caramel sauce over top the chocolate and some graham crumbs from your crust base with the thicker cheesecake and still melted caramel on top of cookie base.

These were made for our hockey fundraiser and were the first to go, with players taking 4 and 5 at a time. This has moved to one of our top favorite recipes for taste, speed and easy to make.

I made these for my moms birthday today and I can confidently say I will never use another cheesecake recipe ever again.  I used 2/3 cup graham cracker crumbs, 2 tablespoons white sugar, and two tablespoons melted butter for the crust instead of vanilla wafers and topped them with lemon pie filling and they were exactly like (or even better than) tiny Baker Squares Lemon Supreme pies.

I am giving this 5 stars because not only is it a delicious cheesecake it has very few ingredients and its fast. Also you can make so many different variations.  I didn't have any vanilla wafers and so I cooked some for it.  I tried strawberry topping and also chocolate.  Delicious!

It was good.  The vanilla wafers I used were too small and too thick.  Look for large, thin wafers.  I also baked it for 5 min longer than the recipe said.

The vanilla wafers floated to the top and the cheesecake just didn't taste like cheesecake. Mine all caved in too. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd be glad to take them. I really want to make this recipe work out well.

Made these for a party, along with mini key lime cheesecakes.  These are great, I didn't have lemon on hand, so I added vanilla, and they are still fantastic.  I top mine with Comstock cherry topping, since it's what I personally always loved about my mothers cheesecake when she made it.  But this recipe allows you to be very creative about the flavors and the add in's that you like.  It's worth reading the reviews to see all the creative ways people are using it.  But as is, it is wonderful!

Delish!  Didn't have cherry filling, vanilla wafers or lemon juice, but instead made my own crust with 1 1/4 Cup of graham crumbs, 2 Tbsp brown sugar and 1/4 cup melted butter, pressed in bottom of 12 greased muffin cups and baked for 5 mins, then let cool.  Used 1 Tbsp vanilla and 2 Tbsp of sour cream with the filling, and topped with frozen berries that I cooked on low with sugar and a little bit of water until soft.  Sooooo incredibly good!  I liked them warm with whipped cream, but hubby loved them refrigerated with drizzle of chocolate sauce.  So quick and amazing.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This makes 18, especially if you are leaving some room on the top for the filling not to spill over the cup. They can also be made with Oreo cookies instead of Nilla Wafers, substituting 1 tsp of vanilla for the lemon juice.

I wanted to make a dessert for a get togeather I'm having this weekend so I did a trial run with these last night. They turned out fantastic! However, I did make a few small changes. My family has been trying to eat healthier, so I substituted Neufeletta (spelling?) 1/3 less fat cream cheese for the regular and used sugar substitude in place of sugar, and added the zest of 1/2 a lemon along with the juice. Also, I made a gramham cracker crust (six full graham crakers, Tbls. sugar subs. 3 Tbls butter) instead of vanilla wafers as some reviews said they came out soggy.  We did not add the pie filling at the end. 
The end result was AMAZING!!! You cannot tell that lighter ingredients were used and you still get the "full richness" of a regular cheese cake. I brought the leftover to work today and they were gone in less than 5 minutes.

I loved these and they are so easy to make!  My husband preferred the version with vanilla extract instead of lemon juice, but I think these are just the right flavor if you want a cheesecake with a little zing.  I will definately be making these again soon- thanks for sharing!

Very easy and quick to make, not to mention yummy. Great for parties. I made a pecan caramel topping by melting about 16 Kraft caramels with a couple of tablespoons of heavy cream over low heat and topping with chopped, toasted pecans. They were gobbled up in no time!

Quick and easy to make, just the way I like it.  I followed the recipe to a "T" accidentally left them in a little bit longer than necessary, the middle caved in a bit, but they were still a hit.  Awesome recipe for a quick dessert fix.  Thanks

These cheesecakes are wonderful.  I do not like the lemon flavor in cheesecakes so I did not add the lemon juice.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly and they were perfect.

This is a good basic recipe, but I have to give it 4 stars b/c I had to alter it too much to get a recipe I really liked.  The recipe is good, but the vanilla wafers were not as good as when I used graham cracker crust.  Added a little vanilla extract b/c it tasted like something was missing without it.  Baked in mini muffin pans (15 min was perfect) and also topped with drizzled dark and milk chocolate.

I used this recipe to make 1000 (thats right, 1000!) Mini cheesecakes for my highschool graduation party. I baked exactly as directed, except for the pie filling. Once they were cooled, i took fresh raspberries and piped melted hersheys kisses inside them, and placed on top of cheesecake, and drizzled more melted kisses on top. These were such a hit with teachers, and kids alike, that i recieved "student of the year" award, and a $500 prize!!!! Thanks for an awesome recipe! :)

I've been looking for this recipe for years. In the 1970's my Home Ec teacher Ms. Whitehead gave our class this recipe. Wow, she made us proud chefs that day. Very easy recipe and so good eating. Just the right size if you have portion control issues. We didn't crush the vanilla wafers and also included vanilla.

Heavenly!!! I made big and litte mini cheesecakes by using regular and mini muffin tins. I also made these diabetic-friendly by using Splenda sugar substitute instead of white sugar and reduced fat, reduced sugar vanilla wafers. Then for the topping, I topped half of them with 1-3 whole pecans, then melted 1 teaspoon of sugar free honey substitute and 1 cup of Hershey's Sugar Free Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips together. I dipped the tines of a fork into the melted sugar free chocolate mix and waved it over the pecan-topped cheesecakes to make little strands of chocolate over each. I then drizzled a little bit of Smucker's Sugar Free Caramel topping over top of the chocolate. For the other half of the cheesecakes, I topped them with sugar-free cherry pie filling. They were amazing, and nobody even realized they were nearly sugar free until they saw my diabetic fiance devouring them!!!

An awesome dessert option.  I didn't use the vanilla wafer, it appeared to small to cover the bottom of the muffin pan.  Instead I substituted crushed graham cracker with melted butter for the crust.  I doubled the recipe, but there is no need to double the cherry topping; 1 can is plenty.  Also, I found that to only fill the muffin tin 2/3 full made for skimpy (cookie height) minis.  Next time I will fill to the top of the liner for better presentation. I did bake in a water bath and had no cracking.

People at the party kept asking me if I bought these premade from somewhere... the presentation was wonderful and they tasted great too! I used a regular size muffin tin and a graham cracker crust following the instructions on the box (you do not need to prebake the crust.) I doubled the recipe for 24 cheesecakes and had enough filling to make at least 12 more cheesecakes. 1 24oz can of the cherries was plenty. I baked them in the foil wrappers and then refrigerated them over night. The evening of the party, I took them out of the wrappers, put on the topping and served. They were perfect!

Very good.  I prefer to crush the vanilla wafers to make more of a crust for the mini cheesecakes.  These freeze beautifully and you can put the cherries on once they are thawed and are ready to serve.

Made these for a party... the vanilla wafer idea was awful and didn't work, so we switched to standard graham cracker crumbs.  Cheesecakes came out good after that.  The recipe should tell you that the only way to use Vanilla wafers is to crush them... they don't fit into a mini-muffin tin.

I've used a recipe almost exactly like this. The recipe I found (by Paula Deen) called for 1 cup of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla extra instead of lemon juice. The only difference! I found mine were a little mushy (and hard to eat, even after chilling overnight) after cooking a full 20 minutes. I would suggest a few more minutes cooking time. Otherwise, these are a treat!

I love cheesecake, and these were really good. I added about a tablespoon of flour and about a teaspoon of vanilla extract. YUMMY! I can see someone getting pretty creative with variations - caramel, raspberry, etc. I'll whip these ones up again.

I'm a cheesecake lover and thought these would be great.  Unfortunately for me, they were not very good.  I followed the recipe exactly, but topped them with strawberry topping.  They looked lovely, but they were not nearly sweet enough and they were not creamy, like traditional cheesecakes.  Still looking for a mini cheesecake recipe.....

I made these for my son's surprise 30th birthday party- everyone loved them. The filling puffs when baked, but will lower as it cools.  Mine made 14-15 a batch. I plan to make these at Christmastime to give to the neighbors!  Enjoy!

these were rated by my husband after they were 3 days old. sounds strange but he said they improved as they got older.  ???  i used low fat cream cheese and these taste BEST if chilled. i wasn't too impressed with the nilla wafers as a crust. i think they've made them smaller in recent years and they really don't fill up the cupcake liner like they should. so i'll try making a crushed nilla wafer crust in each liner next time. i used fresh strawberries on top, pie filling is too sweet, imo.   husband has requested these instead of a birthday cake this year, and he is a cake fiend, so these must be yummy!

This was super easy and it turned out great!  Believe me, I was skeptical, as I don't exactly have a 'baker's touch'.   I would definitely make it again and perhaps experiment with different toppings...although the cherry pie filling was super good and easy to use.  Overall a very economical, practical recipe that looks like it was super difficult to make!  A keeper!  :)

Made these yesterday. So light and creamy and just the right amount of sweetness! I didn't have nilla wafers on hand or graham crackers so I made a crust of 1/2 cup flour, 3 TBSP's sugar, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/4 cup of cold butter-tasted like a shortbread cookie and worked wonderfully. We topped them with a homemade peach sauce I had in the cupboard, but they were equally good plain. This recipe is incredibly versatile - I think you could easily customize it for the season and your personal taste. Thanks for sharing!

Keeper! This recipe is very good. I did make a small change in the two tablespoons of the lemon juice. I replaced one tablespoon of the lemon juice for vanilla. The sugar amount is just perfect too. I followed the suggestion of refrigerating the cheesecakes overnight and topping them the next day for letting it set better. I also replaced the wafer for graham crackers which I combined with 2 tablespoons of melted butter. It is my preference to eat cheesecake with graham crackers so there you go perfect quick recipe and delicious!

These fell apart after baking. I even baked them 6 minutes longer, thinking that would help. They are squishy and can't handle them without them collapsing on themselves.

I thought these were GREAT! We were having a cheesecake party, I found out about it very last minute, this was quick, easy and delicious! Every one loved them.  I left them plain and put out cherry sauce, hot fudge and chocolate sauce as choices for our friends.....they didn't last long :)  I think next time I would try just a bit of vanilla in them, just because I LOVE vanilla!

followed the recipe exactly and for some reason these were not all the hype I expected. My husband was the first to try them and he said they were dry :( I was pretty disappointed to hear that as I'm know to be a good baker. Anyway I topped them with cherry pie filing to help with the dryness a little. Don't know what went wrong since others had great success, oh well.

Made a 'light' version. I loved the way they turned out, but I've changed quite a bit. I used Ricotta instead of regular cream cheese to cut calories (added a bit of flour because of that, like ~10-15 grams/a tablespoon?). And I put a thin slice of store bought yellow cake underneath instead of the cookie. Also I only added a little lemon juice (tasted to see if it was okay), I think if you make it the way you're supposed to they become very sour... I've had that happen before with a different recipe :( These are like apple pie, they taste best after resting for a while, like overnight, and are best served cold.

I've been making these for years, they are awesome and so easy.  I make them bite-size by using mini Vanilla Wafers and baking them in a mini-muffin pan.  I do not top them with cherry pie filling because I personally don't like it.  This year I used homemade Grand Marnier Cranberry Sauce left over from Thanksgiving dinner to top them.  They were a huge crowd pleaser!  In the past I've used fresh fruit as a topping - also delicious.

These were very nice!  I crunched up my vanilla wafers to make sure there was a good bottom everywhere, not just in certain places.  I also did two toppings:  cherry and chocolate.  I melted some chocolate chips with a little bit of shortening and let it cool to room temp.  Once the cheesecake cooled down and sank a little I filled the indentation with chocolate to the top.  Those were a HUGE HIT!  I made 48 of these and we didn't have ONE LEFT.   That says something!  Thanks!

So delicious! I doubled the recipe and put them in mini-muffin pans using the graham cracker crust instead of the vanilla wafers. It made over 100 mini cheesecakes with enough left to make a full pie! Next time I won't double the recipe ... but we have lots leftover for treats this week!

These were very good. My guests liked them more than I did. Make sure to use the mini vanilla wafers if you do mini muffin cups - the regular sized ones work, but they take up too much space.

The flavor was very good but having made lots of cheesecakes did not care for the fact that after removing from the oven the center totally fell.  However, after looking at the photo, I realized this was evident in the photo as well.

I thought the 2 tbsp of lemon juice would be really over powering, but it was just right! I topped it with a saskatoon berry sauce and it was great! Thanks!

I used lowfat oreos for the crust, lowfat cream cheese, splenda and egg beaters.  They tasted great and were only 95 calories a piece!

Big hit! I made these in mini-muffin pans, had to cram the vanilla wafer into the paper and added the filling. Made quite a few, bite sized cheesecakes. The proportion making it this way is almost have cookie to filling, but no complaints. Baking time was about 16-18 minutes. I also added lemon zest, wonderful!

Mine didn't look anything like the pictures, and they were bland.  Maybe I did something wrong. I think using a vanilla wafer on bottom was a mistake, because a wafer is a lot smaller than the cupcake wrapper, so the cheesecake doesn't really have an anchor.

I am only giving this 4 stars mostly because I changed it up a bit. Otherwise it deserves 5!! I dont like vanilla wafers so I used Graham crumbs and butter (just followed the directions on the box) and pressed it into the muffin cups. Then used the cheesecake recipe provided to fill them. I followed others reviews and chilled them in the freezer prior to removing the cupcake wrappers. Then filled half with pureed frozen raspberries with some sugar and drizzled melted semi-sweet chocolate over all of the them. OH MY!! They are amazing:) And they are such a cute size for get togethers or whatever.

These didn't turn out for me.  I used a gas stove so I don't know if that may have been a factor?  I kept baking and baking these and they never did set for me.  The consistency tasted good, but it just wouldn't bake for me.

This was very easy to make!!!! It did not take long at all. Very good, very good. I used 1 cup of /sugar, 2/3 wasn't sweet enough for me. Next time I will use graham crackers instead.

These are awesome.  The filling is delicious! The nilla wafers end up puffy and cake like, which I love.  My husband, on the other hand, calls them "soggy vanilla wafers" and though he LOVES cheesecake will not eat these.  Men!  Ugh.  ;)

I pretty much made these as is except for the toppings. I made them in a mini muffin pan with mini nilla wafers. 1/2 of the cheese mixture I added melted chocolate chips for chocolate cheesecakes. Turned out great! I made these for a martini party and had a few different toppings out so everyone could choose their own way to eat it. They turned out great! Thanks! will def. make again!

2 Tablespoons of lemon juice is way too much for this recipe.  Needs to be cut down by at least half.  They were very tart.

These are pretty amazing. They are really simple to make, I ran out of lemon so we skipped it and they're still really good.  I made a graham cracker crust as well, so I can't speak to the vanilla wafers.  This is a really good base to make other types of cheesecake, and since they are mini it's really easy to try a lot of different flavors without committing to a whole cheesecake that won't get eaten.  We made plain, key lime, strawberry, kiwi, chocolate, caramel, and then combinations of the above.   Maybe I made them too small, but I made two batches of these and had a little bit of the mixture left over each time.  They aren't small at all, but I ended up with an extra 6-12 cheesecakes by the end.

Well these tasted good but they didn't look very pretty.  Probably my fault - I used the foil baking cups (thought they would hold up better) and they all fell in the middle.  Maybe they didn't cook evenly because of the foil cups?

These are so easy!!!  They were very good too!  Hubby had a bring snacks to work day and I decided on these for a summery type of snack...a big hit!!  The first thing to go!  Since this was the first time for me to make a cheesecake I was unsure of what they look like done but I followed another reviewer and waited til they became cracked on top a little.  They turned out perfect!  While the vanilla wafers are easier I think they would taste better with crushed graham crackers mixed with butter and fresh fruit instead of the pie topping.  Either way they were still delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!!

They are not easy to get out of the papers and they are just not feasible to eat.   I just made them for a party and they are an awful mess!  I did not have time to cool them enough maybe.  The wafer is too small for the muffin paper and its all just not pretty to say the least. When you peal the paper they are not holding up well...oh well- I will go make a dip instead.

I also use the lowfat cream cheese. For a topping alternative I used the Polaner All-Fruit. I warm it a bit in the microwave to thin it out a bit, then put it on top of the cooled cheescakes and refrigerate.

I modified the presentation to use mini muffin trays - a little more work because I had to crush the nilla wafers, and mix with a bit of butter, and bake, pressed in the mini-muffin trays, for 5 minutes before adding the cream cheese mixture - but boy, was it worth it!  I got these absolutely divine looking micro-mini cheesecakes, that were the perfect pop-in-the-mouth sizes.  They disappeared sooner than I could make them.  Will make again and again!  Thanks for the recipe!

Followed this recipe exactly and it was wonderful and sooo easy to make. My husband loved it although he put strawberry jam on top instead of cherries. I made it later for some friends and they loved it too. Definetely a keeper.

My fiancee really liked this.  I thought it was pretty good...especially for something super easy to make.  I think it might have been the Nilla wafer crust.  

I ended up getting some caramel sauce to put on it.  Also, got some frozen cherries, threw it in a blender with some lemon juice and a little sugar on top make an easy fruit topping.  Pretty good.

So if you're looking for a super easy-to-make cheesecake that's also good, you really can't beat this one.

I've made this several times and it's absolutely delicious.  I puree frozen raspberries with a pinch of lemon juice and sugar and pour it into the bowl on top.  It's my husband's favorite dessert!  However I can never get them 100% smooth, there's always little cream cheese lumps even though I use room temperature ingredients.  Any suggestions?

I have had this recipe handed down from my mom. I absolutely love it. I have found over the years of making this wonderful treat is to USE FRESH LEMON JUICE! You can taste the difference. Thanks for sharing.

I made this recipe 2x, for different events. The first time, I followed it exactly. I found that I didn't like the addition of the lemon juice and missed the graham cracker crust. I also found they cooked too quickly and cracked or turned brown. People liked it, but they didn't seem to love it. The second time, I made a graham cracker crust using 6 sheets of graham crackers (I used store brand), 1/3 C brown sugar, and 6 T melted butter. I stirred it together and put 1 heaping tsp into each paper cup. Then, using a round spice container pushed the graham into the little cups. For the cheesecake filling, I subbed the lemon with about 2 tsp vanilla and added 1T of milk, to thin it out a bit. I lowered the temp to 325, and baked 14 mins. Out of 42 cheesecakes, 2 cracked and none browned. Some of them I topped with cherry pie filling; some I topped with fresh chopped strawberries; and the rest I topped with the remainder of the graham cracker crumb mixture and a drizzle of chocolate syrup. All loved it. And, I did not have 1 left over. This is a great recipe that you can definitely make your own.

I made these to rave reviews!  Great and SO very easy....just could not be simpler and great cheesecake flavor.  I also made them with an Oreo instead of the Vanilla Wafer, then used crumbled Oreos on top.  Two for the same dirty bowl.  Just double the filling then enjoy!!

Everyone who has tasted these has absolutely flipped for them. These are so delicious and best of all, exceedingly easy to make. I baked them for 18-20 minutes making them much less likely to drop in the center. Topped with fresh fruit instead of a filling. Amazing. You can also try using 1 container of strawberry cream cheese and one original. Reduce sugar to 1/2 cup. Top with fresh strawberries or chocolate chips.

My mom made these when I was a kid and was looking for a recipe that replicated hers. Not sure if this was it, but they turned out great! However, the yield says 12 and for me, it was 24. I used a full-sized muffin pan and cupcake liners and filled the cups 2/3 or more full. 

I made sure to have my cream cheese at room temp before mixing the batter and added the eggs one at a time, had no problem with cracking. 

The taste can't be beat! Everyone loved these. Definitely will make again.

Did not come out good at all. I made them 2 times. Both times the center fell. They would not cook all the way. I lefted them in longer to the point where they were all brown. Center still was not cooked. I let them cool too. Still did not come out good. Oven was at right temp to.

These are awesome! I found that they disappeared almost as soon as they came out! The only thing I changed was the vanilla wafer as I did not like the taste. Instead I used a homemade graham cracker crust.

Great base recipe. I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and also separated my egg whites and whipped them with a teaspoon of cream of tarter. Then you fold the mixture into the batter.

Very easy and quick to make.  I couldn't find mini muffin liners so I made these in regular cupcake muffin tins.  We had to bake them a little longer (eye balling it) and it came out great.  Taking them to the company potluck to see how they are....I hope they all disappear.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I just finished making this dessert and it was amazing. The texture and flavor of the cheese cake was wonderful. And it was very easy to make. I did make the crust differently I still used the vanilla wafers but I decided to crush them and found that it was better to eat. I definitely recommend this little dessert.

For crust use 3 Tbsp of butter, 3 Tbsp sugar, 1 cup of Graham cracker crumbs.  Use I Tbsp per each muffin liner.  This recipe plus the crust listed above makes 24 mini cupcakes.  You can double it.

This was my first time making cheesecake of any kind, so I am sure that there was some user error here. A couple of my cakes caved in, but I know what I did wrong with that. The flavor was okay, but I also wish it would have been sweeter. It was almost too much of an egg flavor. I used a blender to make sure the mixture was smooth all the way through. I heard you are supposed to used room temp cream cheese, but mine was still a little chilled at the time, perhaps that was another issue as well? I also forgot to put the nilla wafers in the baking up, so after baking I crumpled them up and put them on top with the cherries and that tasted pretty good! Definitely liked them much better with the wafers and cherries. My boyfriend, who LOVES cheesecake (and can be bluntly honest) said he liked them so that certainly is saying something! I'll be trying this recipe again with a little more experience and a little extra sugar ;)

Delicious recipe, Ginny. Thanks for sharing! For special events I use Athens mini fillo shells with 
1 1/2 teaspoon of the filling. Bake on a cookie sheet for 10-12 minutes. Sometimes I top with a slice of strawberry, and when I get really energetic, I make candied orange peel curls for the tops. Left plain, these are creamy and flavorful.

Made these last minute (nine pm!) on Father's day. Aside from deflating a bit as they cooled, they were great. Creamy and flavorful. I added some vanilla and cinnamon to the batter and crust.

These are great! I'm a very inexperienced cook, and this is the first time I've made something from scratch without guidance from a more experienced person, but it turned out very well. The middles did sink as some other reviewers pointed out, but this worked in my favor. I made my own topping for these little cakes and the bowl-shaped middle turned out to be the perfect way to keep the topping from spilling over and making a mess. Great recipe!

I think the cake recipe is better suited to a full sized pie since the batter doesn't hold up very well it just kind of mushes. Also they need to be baked longer at least 20 minutes for the centers to not fall in- I topped mine with home made caramel- yum. Over all the flavor is ok.

Not a holiday in sight but wanted something sweet, easy, and lunchbox friendly...Aha...found it!!  These are delicious.  Very pretty on a plate to invite a galfriend over for tea or coffee.  My DD makes these often to take to work to share with office mates.  Can't begin to know how many times I've shared this recipe or told family and friends where to find it.  I love easy peazy yummy and oh does this fit!!

Easy and sooo good. Made these once on a trial run at home, (all were ate very quickly) and again for a family reunion. These were gone before anything else there with everyone raving asking how to make them. Loved that they are made as individual servings. Will use this over and over.

SO EASY!!! I always envisioned cheesecake as being difficult to make. I brought a dozen of these to Easter dinner and they didn't last long. My mother has Celiac and I couldn't find a gluten free vanilla wafer so I made a gluten free graham crakcer crust but the filling is to die for....
This will definitely be my go to recipe for gatherings and work place treats. The individual servings are awesome combined with different toppings, these are fail proof!
Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Really good. I added between 1-1.5 tsp of vanilla extract to the cheesecake batter though. I noticed a lot of other cheesecake recipes did this, so I did it, and it turned out really good. Also, I usually make my own cherry pies, and the recipe I've used each year says to use almond extract and the canned cherries. I love this combination so much that I absolutely never use canned cherries without the almond extract. I add about 1tsp of the extract per can of cherries. Turned out great! I've already caught my husband trying to sneak another before our company arrives tomorrow!

I used the bottom with Girl Scout Savannahs to give the cheesecake a lemony taste.  Love this easy recipe.

This is the BEST (not to mention the EASIEST!) cheesecake recipe I have ever tried!  I followed the directions exactly and my cheesecakes came out SO yummy and with perfectly smooth tops.  I did put a small pan of water in the oven with them...I don't know if that made any difference or not, but regardless..I'm sure they would have tasted just as good! This will now forever be my "go to" recipe when I want to make cheesecake!  Thanks for sharing it!

I use this recipe to make mini cheesecake Easter baskets. Tint coconut green with food coloring for the "grass", top with mini jelly beans (I use Jelly Belly) and use licorice ropes to make "handles".

Theses were pretty good. I liked the smooth texture most homemade cheesecakes are much thicker and not sweet at all. This does have a sweet flavor. I looked at other reviews but decided to stick with the recipe for the first try. I'll agree vanilla wafers don't work to small, may crumble and fill the whole bottom and next time my and some vanilla like other reviews have said. But I will be making these again.

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were a hit!  I did not have vanilla wafers, so I used graham cracker crumbs and oreo crumbs.  I also did not have any pie filling, so I drizzled caramel and chocolate (on some).  Next time I will add pecans as well.  Very simple and easy and very good!  Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this recipe today and I love it! It was a hit with my family and kids. I made the mistake of not allowing the cream cheese to soften all the way, so I put the batter through a food processor and it worked out the clumps fine. I topped it off with a spoonfull of sweetened sour cream mixture I found on another review (1/2 cup sour cream + 2 Tbl sugar + 1/4 tsp vanilla extract) and a spoonfull of cherry filling with sliced almonds. Delicious! I will definitely be making these again :)

This recipe is so simple that I half expected it to be disappointing.  I made them for a friend's birthday and was still recieving emails the next day filled with compliments!

The only change I made was I crushed the vanilla waffers into crumbs and just used the crumbs as a bottom crust.  It held together perfectly without any additional alteration and it was delicious!

Excellent results! I cut the recipe into half and used 12 muffin cups. They are definitely under-filled but the portion is just right. I put one whole vanilla wafer at the bottom, flat side down, and topped it with the cream cheese filling. I used room temperature cream cheese and egg. I added lemon zest in addition to lemon juice in the filling. The amount of sugar produces results on the sweet side. Next time I'll try to reduce the sugar a little bit, maybe just slightly more than 1/4 cup of sugar for half of the recipe.

Made these today as a dessert for my sister's surprise birthday dinner. She loves cheesecake and I don't have the appropriate pan to make one in, so using a muffin pan for these little darlings was perfect! I followed the recipe exact, except for when it came to the vanilla wafers- instead of placing the whole wafer in each baking cup, I crushed  several up for each cup, in effort to give them a normal "tradtional" look. This worked out very well for them(though I did not use baking cups in the muffin pan,not sure if that would make any difference or not) They were a big hit with everyone that tried them, my sister even asked for the recipe lol. I will be making these again and again. Thanks so much for sharing a wonderful recipe!!

My first homemade cheesecake. Very good, I did crush the vanilla wafers and mix butter in with them to make a crust. I know that the whole point of the cookie was to be easy but it just looked to small. They tasted great, although they did have a little bit of a strange texture but I think I can attribute that more to my greenness with cream cheese and I dint think that I whipped it quite enough but they still tasted good. A great hit for Valentines Day with a little strawberry and chocolate on top!

This recipe is awesome! The only thing different I did was to omit the lemon juice and add a tbs vanilla flavoring instead. I also crushed the wafers before I put them in the liner.

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them. I doubled the recipe and still there were no leftovers! I left 1/3 plain, 1/3 topped with raspberries, and I mixed chocolate chips in 1/3. I'm making them again for Christmas (per request!) This time I might top a few with cherries. 

My 3 year old daughter loves to help. She lines all the cups with the Nilla Wafers (making sure to eat all the broken ones lol) and she helps measure and mix.

These were easy to make and everyone liked them. I made a mini muffin version and used the mini vanilla wafers- they were a perfect fit. Topped some with cherry & some with blueberry pie filling. I will make these again!

So delicious and easy to make! Best to have an electric mixer for cream cheese, I attempted to hand-whisk unsuccessfully before picking up an electric mixer. Big hit at work for co-workers!

i doubled this.  I didnt use the whole vanilla wafer.  I crushed up the whole box and added butter to it.  The rest i made the same.  It made about 32 mini cheesecakes.  I used cherries and melted chocolate for toppings.  This was also a big hit on Thanksgiving, i also gave some away too! pretty easy too and didnt crack!

I took these to a BBQ at a friends' house and they were a HIT!! I absolutely loved every single bite of them. These very well may become my signature dish to bring to parties. Good thing I accidentally dropped the leftovers in the street or I would've finished them all!

This is both simple and delicious. I used splenda instead of sugar to reduce the calories (83cal). Topped it with whip cream (using splenda) and blueberries. It was around 150cal each and VERY good.

I made these for the 4th of July and everyone loved them. I used graham cracker crust and added some whipped cream to the filling but everything else was the same. I put whipped cream and strawberries on top and they were very good. I'll make them again soon.

This recipe can't get any easier. If you decide you don't want to use the cherry pie filling or don't like it, I would suggest making a glazed banana topping. I used butter, pancake syrup and a tad of cinammon. The results was stupendous!

These little cheesecakes are so easy and delicous!! Seriously think about doubling batch depending on the size of your party. They are yummy with any fruit topping or even just plain! I drizzled caramel and chocolate on top, then sprinkled some chopped pecans on top of that. They were a HUGE hit at my party! :)

These are yummy. I had to crush 2 vanilla wafer (and I did not even add butter, because they still made a wonderful crust. I will try graham crackers next just because I think that might taste good too. The only changes was I used one cup sugar instead of 2/3 cup, because we like ours a little sweeter, and baked 19 minutes in full size muffin cups.

I love these mini cheesecakes!  I do them up for our Youth Group's fundraising Dessert Night each year.  They are quickly gobbled up!  I use store-bought ginger snaps for the base; they don't get too soggy and add great flavour! Yummy!

The cheesecake filling was excellent but personally I did not like the wafer base.  Next time I will make them with the crumb base.

Enjoyed this recipes very much, added the tsp of vanilla to the batter and did the graham cracker crust. The mini-cupcake pan takes exactly 15 mins.

The lemon juice really brings the flavors together in this recipe.  This being my first time making cheesecake, I wasn't sure what the finished product will look like.  But my family loved it! I used crushed Nilla wafers mixed with sugar and melted butter.  Instead of cherries, I used freshly sliced strawberries.  It's great for a hot summer night dessert!  Thanks!

I can't rate these 5 stars because I never got to try them!  They disappeared before I could even make coffee.  Instead of the pie filling, I used fresh raspberries & blueberries.  Put the berries on top when they just come out of the oven & are still "puffy".

I am HUGE cheesecake lover. If you are expecting a rich and creamy cheesecake flavor you're in for an unpleasant surprise. I did however serve them to 4 adults and two children who liked them so there you go. I may make them again (they are very easy) but I won't be eating them.

Everyone loved these mini cheesecakes.  I made a change in the topping; I used fresh fruit (blueberries and strawberries) instead of cherry pie filling. I also used pretty liners and left the cheesecakes in the liners. It seemed to make it easier for everyone to eat and keep the fresh fruit on top.

Gave this a four for time commitment only. Taste was fabulous, but took a VERY long time to make it. The "mini" muffin tins don't fit vanilla wafers, so you either have to crush them and then add butter or shortening to make a crust, or cut the cookies to size. Neither is as easy as the recipe implies. The recipe makes many more than the number of mini muffins it says. I made 48 mini muffins + 12 full size muffins with a double recipe and still threw a lot of batter away. Unwrapping frozen cheesecakes from the muffin liners is easier, but still quite time consuming. Also, not sure why, but mine fell a little after baking. (I'm a novice cook.) Next time, I will make a full size and then cut into bite sized pieces.

I took this to a company pot luck and it was very well received! Instead of using wafers (didn't have any) I used the Graham Cracker Crust recipe found on this site. I also used mini cupcake moulds. Before baking, I added a couple of drops of strawberry jam and made a couple of swirls. They looked and tasted fabulous!!

I substituted the graham cracker crumb/butter/sugar mixture for the wafers, and used frozen raspberries in light syrup as topping.  These were delicious and I will definitely make them again.

Excellent recipe! The only thing I changed (to eliminate the extra carbs) was to blend together melted butter, almond flour, splenda and cinnamon for the base instead of the vanilla wafers. Oops, I also used Splenda instead of sugar, but, I had to double the amount to get just the right amount of sweetness.

These are amazing with endless potential for creative versions!  I followed the recipe exactly but added an extra 1/2 tblsp lemon juice and maybe 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. I also found the nilla wafer too small to use as crust and opted for crushed graham crackers and oreos. I also found strawberry pie topping and made a turtle version as another reader suggests, both were wonderful!

This is sooo good! I decided to make this for thanksgiving this year and thought i would make a batch early just to make sure they turned out good and they are soo yummy! I used a oreo without the filling for the crust and topped it with raspberry pie filling. I did buy vanilla wafers but it taste so good with the oreo i'm using them for the few batches I make! Thanks for the yummy recipe~

The adding of the lemon juice is a very nice taste and complements the fruit topping.

Very easy to make & nice end result.

My kids don’t like fruit toppings, so  I added a chocolate swirl on the top (melt 2oz semi-sweet chocolate squares with half teaspoon butter, drizzle a little bit on top of each mini cup, and swirl with a butter knife, before baking)

Usually I don’t leave reviews because I’m lazy, but I had to give these 5 stars. They are my daughter’s new favorite thing in the world apparently! Mine didn’t turn out as photogenic as some others, but they tasted great and that matters more. We will certainly be making them again... and again.. and again probably

Made these with my girlfriend, they turned out absolutely lovely. We realized quickly that the wafer cookies weren't exactly suiting our needs, so we put some graham crackers, butter, and brown sugar in a food processor and baked for a while in order to make a more traditional crust. Using these, we had great results. They needed a little bit of extra time in the oven, and the texture improved drastically after refrigerating for a few hours. Aside from those few notes, they were wonderful. We ended up with quite a bit of extra and made several extra cheesecakes, which was a pleasant surprise. Will absolutely come back to this recipe at some point.

I made this keto I replaced the sugar with swerve and I used the walnut nut crust, but used almond flour. It was great. My brother in law who hates anything with a sugar substitute loved it. I also added cinnamon..YUMMY.

Excellent recipe! I tried the recipe three ways. I used whipped light cream cheese because my husband bought the wrong thing. They needed to bake a tad longer and really sunk on the top, but they were very creamy. The next time, I used fat free cream cheese bricks and Splenda instead of sugar. They were good, but a tad rubbery. Not as creamy. The third time, I used one brick regular cream cheese and one brick of fat free and went back to sugar. They were only slightly tough on the top, but not noticeably so, and the cherries were great camo. My guests loved them. My photo is from the third variation.

Very pleased with this recipe. I made very small changes; no lemon, and added vanilla. I also made graham crust instead of using nilla wafers. The texture was heaven and baking time was spot on. No sinking, no cracking just cheesecake yumminess.

So so so incredibly delicious and couldn't be easier!!! I recommend the jumbo muffin pan liners to make clean up almost non-existent. I found that the jumbo liners allow for just the right amount of filling in all 12 places, but doesn't run over and make a mess. Throw an extra 'Nilla wafer on the bottom and top with strawberry pie filling for the perfect dessert.

Very good! Though I only put in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, as I thought 2 tablespoons would make it too overpowering to my personal taste.

These were a huge hit! Easy to make and everyone loved them. I dropped an Oreo in as my crust, reduced the lemon and added alittle more vanilla. Once they have cooled do not put your toppings on, refrigerate overnight and next day the liners come right off. put toppings on and serve. Side note: if the tops crack you over baked them.

These were delicious and so pretty to present.  The recipe makes a bunch thus a bit time consuming but worth the effort.
Thank you for the recipe, Ginny.

No changes need to this recipe...unless you are serving someone who is allergic to wheat or a diabetic.  I have done both and I simply substitute splenda for the diabetic and remove the nilla wafer for the person allergic to wheat.  For those who have no allergies or special health diets, this is a great recipe exactly as written.  I love it!

So delicious and easy to make! I made sure to use my had mixer to fluff up the cream cheese. Then, I added all the other ingredients. The lemon juice makes it so good!

Love this recipe!   Once, I made the mistake of buying mini vanilla wafers, so here’s what I did:

1. Pulse 1/2 a box vanilla wafers in food processor until it’s crumbs.
2. Melt 1/2 stick butter (1/4 cup) in microwave and pour into crumbs and mix. 
3. Drop 1 small scoop of crust mixture in each cupcake paper.  
4. Press into bottom with a spice jar.  
5. Make cheesecake batter as recipe says. 
6. Drop 1 large scoop cheesecake batter into each cupcake paper.  
7. Bake 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  
8. Recipe yields about 16-17 cupcakes.

The wafers floated to the top of about 1/3, eek! I made it as directed, but my cream cheese had been frozen (huge 3lb brick I didn't need right away) and was a little runner than usual so maybe that's why. The flavor is good, standard cheesecake.  Will make again, but maybe try graham cracker crust if my c.c. is frozen. Let's hope the strawberry filling hides the oops!

These where sooo good but the vanilla wafer got soggy so the second time I did it I used crushed gram crackers and then they where way better.

Easy ingredients for something quick and simple to make.  Used this recipe as portion control!  Switched cookie for actual graham crackers and no fruit for dressing.  Baked almost like a cupcake but soon collapsed on cooling rack.  A little heavy in consistency so next time I'll lighten the batter,
Nice concept!  Thanks for sharing.

I really like this recipe.  To remove the sugar entirely, I decided not to use a cookie or any graham crackers for the bottom.  Instead of the 2/3 cup of sugar, I used 2/3 cup of NuNaturals MoreFiber Baking Blend (Stevia).  I followed the advice of other reviewers and made them in cupcake liners, cooled them, and froze them.  The cupcake paper comes off nicely when they are frozen.  These modifications resulted in the healthiest cheesecake dessert I've ever made or eaten.  I would make it again this way.  In the words of a previous reviewer, this is such a versatile recipe. I'm grateful that the original cook shared it!

Turned out great! The boyfriend loved them for our anniversary~! I substituted the nilla wafers with 1/3 cup crushed graham cracker mixed with 1/4 tbs butter for the base. Then I hand pressed them into the cupcake paper wrappers and poured the cheesecake batter over top to the 2/3rds mark. Tasted delicious and topped it with my own strawberry syrup and a dollop of whipped cream. Yummy yummy!!!

Pretty simple to put together added the zest of the lemon along with the lemon juice. Added 1 teaspoon of some good vanilla. Made my own blueberry topping with some simple syrup &  fresh blueberries that I tossed in corn starch (to help thicken).

These were phenomenal! Perfect taste and texture. The only thing I had trouble with was the baking time. I had to add an extra 15 minutes and let them firm up in the fridge for an hour but it was worth the wait!

My first mistake was that I used 1/2 Cream Cheese and 1/2 No-Fat Cream Cheese as the store was out of Neufatchel. I was doubling the recipe but ended up with 32 mini cheesecakes, even at 2/3 full. Then, after baking at 350 for 17 minutes, they weren't close to being set. At 25 minute I gave up and took them out. Some still weren't set up and the taste was wasn't what I had expected.
I'd made this before but must have used a different recipe because I remembered them as being easy and yummy!

Recipe was super easy, and they came out perfect.  I did crumble up Oreos, and used that instead of graham crackers as something a little different, and used the left over Oreo crumbles for the top.

Yummy and easy  to make.  I made  a  pretzel crust mixture (butter, brown sugar and pretzel pieces) that I put into the bottom of foil cupcake liners ( which hold their shape well).  Made the recipe for the cheesecake as written.   Of course my kiddos and I ate  some as soon as we thought they were cool enough :0)  I made my crust a little bit thicker..and enjoyed eating them plain and topped some with a sour cream and sugar topping (mix to your taste).  Left them in the fridge for a couple hours to chill.   Everyone loved them.  Making more today!!

I have been making these off and on for decades and still love them.  Planning to make some to take to work this week for co-workers who have never tried them.  So easy, so good and they provide just the right amount of cheesecake to make you think you're really cheating on your diet when you're just getting a taste of sweet.

Might make them again, this time I will add the fruit topping.  I was asked to make them for a shower, my first time, and assured there was fruit to top with, but there was none. The cake was not too sweet and could have done with a sweeter fruit topping.

Awesome & Quick - many compliments. I do wish the vanilla wafers covered the bottom of the papers; I may crumble them next time to better cover the bottom.

This is the easiest Cheesecake recipe ever! I didn't have vanilla wafers so I used honey wheat pretzels. I added butter, cinnamon and brown sugar to the crushed pretzels and it turned out amazing! This recipe is a keeper!!

My friend and I made these for Christmas for a group of people. We didn't have the vanilla wafers. So we improvised and used teddy graham cookies instead for a crusty bottom. It was wonderful had rave reviews from our group of people, and we also used mini muffins cups to make it less messy. This is a new Christmas tradition at our house!

it wasn't as solid as I was thinkinh normal cheesecake  should be, but they tasted great! I drizzled a bit of chocolate syrup on top. we also used graham crackers and used a little melted butter to blend together and pressed the crumbs into the cups. we didn't have wafers. turned out great!

Delicious and so easy to make! Went over well at the office. The serving size was disproportionate, it states the recipe makes 12 cakes but it actually made 18 cakes, which was a nice surprise but something to keep in mind when preparing.

Cooked mine longer than recipe called for.  Took them out of the oven and they deflated to half the size.  Maybe should have added 2 TBS of flour?  Nilla wafer is much too small to cover the  bottom.  I think I'd add a little flour if I make them again.

the vanilla wafers  don't come close to filling the bottom of the muffin tin. I baked mine for 24 minutes and THAT was still too short. When I took them out, they promptly deflated.

These are awesome!!  I prefer graham cracker crust so I used the graham cracker, butter, sugar mix for the bottoms.  I also made mine in ramekins instead of a cupcake pan.  I halved the recipe and it made 4 ramekin desserts.  Otherwise,  made it exactly as stated.  Turned out great!  Not overly sweet like cheesecake can be.  Also, the texture was great for me, not mushy.
   I've made cheesecake before with vanilla wafers and even with animal crackers if I don't have graham crackers and both work just fine.  Just for my personal taste, I like the graham cracker crust.
   I had cherry pie filling to top them with and caramel with pecans.  Tried them both ways and I prefer the caramel topping or just plain because the cherry pie filling seemed to overpower the taste of the cheesecake.  And this is definitely a cheesecake you want to savor in your mouth!

Loved them they are so tasty!!! I used graham crackers instead of vanilla wafers because I personally don't like them, but they still tasted amazing. I just cut the graham crackers to fit in the muffin cups and tada delicious cheese cakes.

I made these for the men's Beast Feast at church and I almost ate one of right out of the oven because they looked so tasty!  I'm glad I waited until they had chilled overnight though, because the texture was so creamy, cold, and good! I filled my tins just a little over half way to leave room for the cherries and still be able to stack them for transporting, and I got 18 instead of 12.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla because one reviewer said they weren't impressed with the flavor.  I think they would have been delicious with or without it. I wasn't sure how I would like the vanilla wafer as a crust, but it was perfect and so so easy. I also was afraid they would stick to the wrappers, but they pulled away nice and clean.  I'm making these again next weekend just because, and I will definitely be making them for the holidays! I will use a variety of toppings next time.....blueberries, strawberries, caramel and pecans, maybe some white chocolate and raspberries.

We loved these at our house . They are ideal to prepare to serve at any upcoming holiday party or gathering. Individual servings, there's no more cutting and serving on desert plates, they are already to eat when put on the table. from (Brandy)

I used regular cupcake liners with foil which are lined with a paper liner. I followed the recipe exactly the first time. Second time I used Oreo cookies, twisting and then scraping off the frosting, using one wafer for the crust. Used about a 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips,I then drizzled hot fudge once they were chilled.I had rave reviews. Definitely a keeper. The only problem I had was while they cooled the cheesecakes fell. Not sure how to prevent this. Definitely make a day ahead and chill before topping.

Really tasty and easy to make.  Came out a little more dense than I would like, but I will definitely try this recipe again.  I topped it with fresh raspberries and a dollop of sweet whipped cream.

Awesome!  Followed the directions exactly!  Impossible to screw up.  These are exactly like the ones my mom made when I was a kid.  Also, these are highly versatile!  So much easier (and faster) than making a full cheesecake.  Plus, perfect portion size as to prevent overeating.

Family loved em! I added 1 Tbsp cornstarch & 1/2 Cup sour cream, bake @ 325^ for 22 minutes-doubled the recipe-made 28 tarts-using 2-12 cup regular sized muffin tins, & 4 extra in a smaller muffin tin-I filled em full-would've made 30 if I hadn't filled so full. Did like others-chilled 24 hours before topping them with a Tbs. of lemon pie filling, or cherry pie filling, or blueberrie

Tried with low fat neufchatel cream cheese, forgot the lemon juice and still turned out very well. Very easy and simple recipe, will definitely make again with different filling options. I used homemade blackberry jam as I didnt have any fruit filling on hand.

Taste was great. Presentation was disapointing. Why did they fall once out of heat? Also, how do you beat cream cheese til fluffy by hand? Tips to get mine to come out creamier? I had tiny lumpies of cream cheese even after I stirred the livin day lights out of the poor dears!

This is my favorite 'what will I make' recipe! So many ways to dress it up! I use vanilla wafers, ginger snaps, chocolate chip cookies, oreos for crust, and top with pie fillings, chocolate chips, vanilla chips, mint chips, peanut butter chips, fruit, little candies, whipped cream, ice cream toppings. These are always a hit at parties, picnics, holidays, or any day!

I have made these on several occasions and everytime they are a hit -- but more importantly easy and quick to make with an impressive appearance.  The cherry pie topping is the best.

I can't wait to dig into these.  Taking them to my sister's as a house warming gift.  Just for kicks...I used 1.5 packages of cream cheese, and the other half of strawberry cream cheese.  Adds a nice strawberry flavor.  I'm going to top it with homemade strawberry syrup that I made a few weeks ago.  Hmmm...mmm!

I made this recipe lite, lower fat by using neufachtel (1/3 less fat) cream cheese and fresh mixed berries with a squirt of fat-free whipped cream on top for presentation.  The result was amazing.  I will make it again and again.    176 calories for each serving with 10 grams of fat (still not low fat but lower than the original 15 grams).

Flavor is excellent.  These didn't turn out the best for me, I tried both regular and mini muffin tins.  I think I needed more baking time than stated.

I tried your receipe , but being a little dumb because it didn't say to crush the vanilla wafer, which I thought I should, I used the whole wafer. It is important to be precise

Wow - these taste great and took literally 5 minutes to make!! What a fantastic, quick and easy recipe. My only complaint is that the wafers are too small to entirely cover the bottom of the muffin tin; however I am going to try again in the future with different brands of cookie. Round shortbreads maybe? Ginger snaps? I am not sure. So far we have loved them here and I know the girls will gobble them up at girl's night out tonight. Thanks so much!

I used graham cracker crust because the nilla wafers were too big.  I liked the graham cracker crust much better.  The mini cheesecakes were easy to make and tasted light and creamy.  I did add a bit of vanilla to the recipe.

This was a very easy and very good snack at our holiday cookie exchange.  We were a little nervous about the idea of using a Nilla as the crust but it worked great.  We used silicon cupcake cups which made them easy to serve and a little festive as well

These are super easy to make and taste great. I baked two dozen and topped half cherry pie filling and the other half with blueberry pie filling. I added a rosette of whipped cream to each and put a tiny American flag pick on each one. They looked very cute on the table for election eve dessert. My guests raved about them. Just a perfect serving of cheesecake! Have your cream cheese and eggs at room temperature. This makes the mixing so much easier and will give you a smoother cheesecake.

Everyone thought these were great! Plus they were so pretty! I didn't use the wafer instead I made a crust with the Graham Cracker Crust recipe on this site. I thought they could have been sweeter - but like I said everyone else thought they were great.

Good. I used strawberry shortcake cookies instead of wafers and put a kiss in some of them, plain ones and ones with a Hersheys Kiss in the middle. I would like to try another similiar recipe that is a little more smooth tasting though. Very good party idea and tastes much better the next day.

These are simple to make and look pretty but they aren't creamy or sweet enough for my liking.

I made these for dessert the first night I made dinner for my parents and little brother.   These were really easy to make and taste wonderful. Next time I think I'll try oreo cookies without the filling
