I love these muffins!   I wound up selling products for a company based out of Texas because I fell in love with the pecan pie muffin mix they had.  I was so excited to find a recipe for these wonderful little gems.  I only put about 1/2 cup of pecans in mine and I like them pretty gooey so I bake them at 325 degrees for about 12 minutes.  They do tend to stick.  I use a nonstick mini muffin pan and spray it very well.  Baker's joy works better than anything else.  I wouldn't recommend using the paper muffin liners.  The muffins stick to them like glue.

I have found that the "key" to these muffins is mini muffin tins -- the regular size ones just don't work, and Baker's Joy spray.  Also, I fill mine with just 1 tbsp. of filling, and bake only 17 minutes. Mine are always a hit, in fact, I am enjoying some right now.  I love the jar gift idea -- I am going to try that one next Christmas.

I LOVE it!  They never last at my house more than an hour!  I use Baker's Joy and never have a problem with sticking.  Also I use melted butter and add it straight to the dry mixture, then the beaten eggs.

After I sprayed my muffin tin with Pam, I coated the cups with sugar (instead of flour).  My muffins popped right out of the tin!  My office loved them.

This recipe is easy and fantastic!  I serve it warm with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream and everyone loves it!  I also bought glass holiday jars, mixed the flour & sugar and put in the bottom, topped with the nuts, put a ribbon on it with a "finish the recipe" card calling for the butter and egg and gave them to teachers for holiday goodies!  BIG HIT!!

By the time I finished reading many of the reviews, I was terrified!  All that sticking and gooiness and whatever!  But most people, despite negative comments, said that they TASTED wonderful, so I decided to be brave..... Well, these are the most adorable little things to look at and to enjoy!  Worried, from comments, that I would practically have to use pliers to get them out of the pan, I sprayed with Pam AND I buttered and sugared each little cup lightly.  Since I was using a dark pan, I baked at 325.  I tied myself to the kitchen chair so that I could keep an eye on the little guys and so that nothing could go wrong!  The changes I made were due to suggestions:  I added a bit of vanilla and I used only 1/2 cup of butter which I melted (I usually melt any butter called for in a muffin recipe since it seems to yield a more tender muffin). I set the timer for 15 minutes.  Ding!  What came out of the oven were 12 perfect little muffins that were a cinch to remove from the pan!  I had enough batter for another dozen and this time I used liners (Pam-sprayed lightly).  Another pan of perfection.  Although they look prettier in liners, there was a teensy sticking problem here and there, but not enough to ruin the muffins.   Probably a bit more Pam would help.    Please, folks, try making these again if they did not work out the first time.  They are  perfect for a little tea party! So glad I accepted the challenge!

I followed the suggestions of other raters and reduced the butter and added a little more flou. They did not turn out good. They were dry and nothing like pecan pie. If you try these I would suggest following the recipe. I am not sure if I will try again!

These are fantastic! I usually make them in regular sized tins, but you MUST use oil and flour the tins, or they will stick! I lost the first batch using only tins sprayed with PAM. The paper liners do work, too, but if you want to eat them right away, the muffins will stick to the paper until they have cooled a little. They are not too greasy for us!!!!

I read a few reviews and wondered about the muffin liners...after reading TANYAHOLMAN's review, i experiemented a bit. Mini muffins are definately the way to go...so then I tried a few variations with muffin liners; regular,  parchment lined foil, and none at all.  The winner was no liner.  I used EV olive oil to coat the cups (nonstick mini muffing pan) & coated with sugar. They popped right out! the others were stuck to the paper...thx for the tip it worked out great. I also made a 2nd batch. I used a bit of vanilla, dash of salt, and a splash of sugarfree maple syrup...I like mine gooey as well, so I baked them at 330 for 15-17 mins and they came out great.. My husband's favorite idulgence has always been Pecan Pie...he loved them. Great recipe& great tips,  thx!

I took these to a superbowl party and they were a huge hit.  Delicious!  Here's what I changed: used 3/4 golden brn sugar and 1/4 dark brown; added vanilla; and cooked in mini-muffin pan greased with flour/crisco spray for 17 minutes.  The trick to not sticking is to remove the muffins from the pans about 2 minutes after removing from the oven (any sooner and they will fall, any later and they start to stick).  One word of note: my eggs and butter never became "smooth", not sure how this is possible, most recipes cream butter and sugar, then add eggs...but it turned out not to be an issue.  Oh, I also used 1 and a half to 2 cups of pecans instead of just the 1.  I will say that people thought these were bran muffins, so if you are taking them to a party either use a placecard stating what they are, or dress them up somehow, maybe a chocolate drizzle or a whole pecan on top??!  This is a keeper recipe for sure, and uses ingredients I ALWAYS have on hand.

Love these little gems! I'm a huge fan of pecan pie, so this makes it really easy to satisfy my craving. I did feel they were missing something, so next time I will add a little salt and some vanilla (or rum!) extract. I made half a batch, which gave me 12 mini muffins. I greased and floured my non-stick pan. I let them cool in the pan, then gave them a little twist and they popped right out.

A friend gave me this recipe several years ago.  Since then, it has been my most requested item to take to pot luck luncheons.  Suggestions:  With all the butter in this recipe, I have found it is not necessary to grease and flour my pans.  It might depend on the type of pan you are using.  Knowing when to remove from the oven is key.  I watch for the edges to get golden brown and a little bit crusty.  It takes 13 to 15 minutes in my mini muffin pans, so check them frequently the first time you make them.

I don't really care for pecan pie but my husband adores it.  So, I thought I would give these a shot because the ingredients didn't seem like the result would be too sweet for my taste.  THEY WERE FANTASTIC.  The absolute best pecan recipe I've found.  I have made them at least a 1/2 dz times since Thanksgiving and had to e-mail this recipe to at least 15 ppl.  SOOO GOOD!  Plus, my husband dug them so much I wasn't forced to make the actual pie this year!  THANKS!

This recipe is great but I added 1/2 cup whole wheat flour , vanilla and I think next time I will cut back on the sugar. I added more flour because some people had tried it where I work, and said they were hard. I maybe used a little less 1/2 cup of whole wheat turned out great!

I have made these twice...once using 2/3 cup butter and once using 1/2 cup butter which most recipes say.  They are awesome and 1/2 c. butter is just fine.  On the second batch, I experimented and added 1/4 flour and 1/4 quick oats.  I liked the ones with the oats better.  You have to have something that make these a little healthy, lol.  I made 12 muffins and only cooked them for 16 minutes.

I added some vanilla because one reviewer said "they were missing something" and I think this did the trick.  I made half a recipe and it made 16-1 TBS muffins.  The first batch I baked for 15 minutes and the second for 12 minutes.  I like the shorter baking time.  These are going to go on my dessert buffet on Christmas--if they last that long.  They are in the freezer now, but I know they are there; hopefully, out of sight, out of mind.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These are simply delicious and so quick and easy they can be whipped up for an impromptu coffee date with a friend.

I used a silicone mini muffin pan that I sprayed with no-stick spray with added flour (Pam for Baking in Canada) and they popped right out of their little cups with no sticking at all.

The name of these muffins and the very basic ingredients had me very intrigued.  I love pecan pie so I was hopeful.  The muffins are *okay* but in my opinion not worth the gazillion calories they must contain.  If I'm going to eat that much fat and sugar it should be mouthwatering and these muffins simply are not.  Doubt I'll make them again.

These are so good! Used the bakers joy spray-they popped right out of the pan. Tablespoon of mixture was the perfect amount for each mini muffin cup.

Wow. These are soooo good! My husband absolutely loves pecan pie and requests the mini versions all year long. I have tried quite a few different recipes using different crusts and whatnot. These are hands down his all time favorite. I have to say, mine as well. They're so quick and easy to make and the outcome is delicious. Crunchy on the outside and moist and chewy on the inside, they almost have a dense brownie texture. I've been hassled for another batch since making the first so I told my husband I can only make these once a week. That was last week so naturally the second batch is in the oven as I write this! THANK YOU PRISSYCAT!

Why only 5 stars??? This is a wonderful recipe. I used others suggestions to not use papers in my muffin pan. I used Pam & dusted with sugar. I made some this morning to take to work and they were gone as soon as I entered the office. I wouldn't change a thing. If you made them as full size muffins they might be too rich. With the mini muffin size you can almost pretend that there are no calories...almost!

These are really delicious.  I am on a low sugar diet, so I substituted splenda for 1/2 the brown sugar (1/2c brown sugar, 1/2 c splenda, + 1/4 c. non fat milk powder to make up for the lost volume).  I was afraid that these would not be very good with my alterations, but they were great!

I just finished making my fourth batch--I'm impressed! I grease my pans very well with vegetable-oil-based non-stick spray and then flour them. Then when I take the muffins from the oven, I loosen the edges a bit if needed, but don't remove until they're cool. I've had no trouble getting them out of the pans. 
I melt the butter before mixing it with the eggs, and it blends better. Also, I ran out of butter once and used margarine instead with good results (but a bit less buttery taste).
I even made one mini-loaf, though it took a much longer time to bake (after 30 minutes, I checked it every 7-10 mins. until a knife inserted in center came out clean) and I had to cover it with aluminum foil for the last 15-20 mins of the baking time to keep it from browning too much on the top.  Still, it came out delicious!  It's got a somewhat hard candylike crust, with a thick, doughlike middle (but it doesn't taste undercooked). Sliced nicely when I used a *sharp* serrated knife.
Thanks for a great recipe! :-)

I've made these muffins three times-- twice as mini-muffins, and once as regular-sized. My mother and I are absolutely crazy about them. Beware, they can come out a little greasy at the bottom of the cups, so don't remove them from the pan right away-- let them cool. But the flavor is so worth it, warm and delicious, chock full of nuts. I always add extra!

Help!  I made these last night, but something went wrong.  The tops crusted over beautifully, but the bottoms were not cooked.  I cooked them for 25 minutes at 350, then had to put them back in for another 5 minutes.  I don't know what I did wrong - this was a first for me.

Even thought they didn't turn out "right" they were absolutely delicious!!  I'm going to keep trying this recipe until I get it right.  Can someone help me out with this problem?

My son is deployed so He won't have my chocolate chip pecan pie this year... So.. I bought pint sized mason jars,sterilized them, added 1/3 cup chocolate chips, 1tsp vanilla and baked them in a 325 oven for 45 min ( or until the tester comes out clean). I placed the seal and lid on. The jars will pop when they are sealed. I will ship them to him in time for Christmas.I made atest batch and tried them from the jar 2 weeks  later...yum!!! Be sure to use a knife to run around inside and they will slide right out!

These are an evil goodness...  ;-)  Made them yesterday evening for my husband the pecan pie fiend.  No mini muffin pan, but made 12 large muffins, baking at 325 for close to 30 minutes.  No problems with sticking, as I greased and floured the pan.  Will definitely make again, as they are very easy and taste divine... or evil, depending on your diet.

These are awesome little devils!!!  To make them  a 'little healthier' I used Splenda Brown Sugar (read pkg for conversion) and Smart Balance 50/50 Butter with Omega 3.  I also added 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract.  YUM!

These were absolutely delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out wonderfully.  I read other reviews and when they are fresh out of the oven, they do taste buttery.  However, once they have cooled off, they taste even better.  My edges had a nice crunch to them.  I didn't cook them for the twenty minutes.  I cooked until the edges were slightly browned which was about fifteen minutes.  I let them cool in the muffin pan before removing.  Everyone thought they were delicious as a dessert (very sweet!).  I am going to try the low sugar version a reviewer posted so I can indulge a bit more and not feel so guilty.  Thanks for the easy and delicious recipe.

The muffins would have been so much better had they not been as greasy. I think it might be due to the amount of butter to flour ratio. These muffins will be excellent provided you add more flour than the recommended amount--perhaps 1/2 cup more than the recipe states.

Sorry, did not love these at all.  Because of the amount of butter vs. flour, they are very heavy and greasy. Not at all like pecan pie.  The only thing you really taste is nuts.  Very heavy in your stomach. I won't make them again.

These are good, but I just had a pecan pie bread (similar to a banana bread) and it was outstanding. Maybe this needs a little corn syrup. May try to tweek it a bit to make them again. These are better once they are cooled or even refrigerated. Nicely crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.

I suggest you try these, even though I only gave them 3 stars.  They are SUPER easy! With that said...

I didn't love these, but I liked them.  They didn't taste as much like pecan pie as I had hoped.  (To be fair, this is probably only because, to me, the texture of pecan pie is part of what makes it so good.) I did eat a lot of them as my sugar addiction kept me going back, which is ironic because I thought they were too sweet. 

I will definitely make them again, but I will add semi-sweet chocolate chips and coconut. I may even add a pinch of salt (my pecans were not salted).

I made some in a mini muffin pan, but getting them out was a bigger pain than what I wanted. (I didn't like having to wait for them to cool...)  So, I baked the rest as if they were brownies.  I will definitely continue making them this way.

These little muffins are absolutely delicious.  I got 35 mini muffins out of this recipe and they are a perfect size.  My husband said he thought he could eat them all!  FYI, I did add a splash of vanilla extract.  The only problem I had was they stuck horribly in the pan.  Nearly all of them were torn up just trying to get them out of the pan.  The first batch I just sprayed with non-stick cooking spray.  The second batch I sprayed then floured and wiped away the excess and then wiped a little butter in each cup.  They still stuck but not as bad.  I will try mini muffin liners next time.  Other than the sticking problem, they were just so delightfully tasty, I will make them again and again!  Thank you!

These are delicious!!!  I feel guilty eating them for breakfast.  We made them in regular sized silicon muffin pan (sprayed with Pam) and had to get them out VERY carefully.  Not the most beautiful for presentation, but who cares, they don't last long.  I have made them in mini muffin pans and do agree that they are better in those.  Also, these are fairly rich, in my opinion, so the smaller muffin pans at least make you feel a little less sinful!!  The only thing I have ever changed about the recipe was to add about 1 tsp. of vanilla to the mixture.  Today we had some extra "ground" pecan so we mixed it with a little white and brown sugar and spooned over each muffin. Not for the dieter, but great for a pregnant mommy every once-in-a-while!!!!

I made this in a sunflower-shaped cake pan, and it was both beautiful and delicious. The top and sides were kind of crispy and tasted exactly like bits of pecan pie! Everyone loved it. I used virgin coconut oil instead of butter, and the house smelled divine while it was cooking. This is a keeper!

These were amazing! I did have to add a little bit of water, as it was too thick to pour as written, but otherwise, I followed the recipe. I don't have a mini muffin tin, so I used a regular size, and came out with 12 muffins. I used muffin papers, and didn't have any problem getting them out. I made these for my mom for Mother's Day and she LOVED them. I'll definitely be making these again.

WOW!  These really did taste like half muffin/half pecan pie!  Very awesome.  I put them in for the suggested 20min and they cooked perfectly.  People LOVED them!  My only suggestion for next time would be to lower the amount of butter.  I felt like they were oily when I took each bite. In fact, when I went to heat up the leftovers in the microwave the following day, butter pooled at the bottom of the plate, and if I lightly squeezed the muffin, then butter would squirt out.  The batter was liquid enough that I think cutting it down by a bit would be all you need to do, and I bet they'd be just as great and a little bit healthier.  UPDATE:  I made them again last night, using only 1/3c butter instead of 2/3c.  They cooked wonderfully and were still moist.  Cutting the butter down was the way to go!

I love these and unfortunatley I can't keep away from them.  I did add a dash of vanilla as someone suggested. With Pilsbury Baking spray these came out with no problem.

I used 3/4 c. flour to make them more muffin-y.
The original recipe is very dense (like pecan pie--what the name says!) and I could only get 8 muffins out of it.

Superb pecan taste, however!  I gave some to my neighbors and they raved about them all year!  I also made some for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day--shipped well, with the extra flour added.  Without that, they are just too gelatin-like to ship well.

Fabulous!  My family has a new addiction!  I have made these as written (and they were great!) and I have also made them dairy free (using earth balance, worked perfect) and then gluten and dairy free using earth balance and GF Bisquick for the flour.  If you use the Bisquick, I would maybe make in an 8x8 pan or just don't put a lot of batter in each.  I had a huge mess, but they still taste awesome, even being eaten with a spoon straight from the pan!  Using a GF all-purpose flour might work better, I'm new to GF cooking so still learning.  
Thanks for this recipe!

These are awesome!!!  Quick and easy to make.  No problem with the muffins sticking to the pan, I sprayed it with baker's joy. I only baked them for 17 minutes and they were perfect.

This was an excellent recipe! The only problem I had was trying to cream the butter with the eggs. I eventually gave up and just added in the rest of the ingredients. They turned out well, though!  Like some other reviewers, I added about a tablespoon more flour and used Baker's Joy, and they turned out great! I also used a regular muffin tin (it made 10 muffins) and they turned out just fine.

These were wonderful!  Gone in minutes at my party.  I only used 1/2 c. pecans and 1/2 c. butter.  I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour.  Sprayed the mini muffin pan with Bakers Joy and baked for 12 minutes.

I creamed together the sugar and butter (I had to substitute margarine), added 1 teaspoon of vanilla , then stirred in the eggs , followed by the pecans . This resulted in a smooth , even batter , to which I added the flour & mixed well. I then used the wrapper from the margarine & greased 12 silicone muffin liners . Baked for 22 minutes @ 350 . Perfect , only thing I will change next time is that I plan to try adding a bit of cinnamon .

(Previous review was not submitted under my name...sorry)I am SO glad I tried this recipe. These little mini pecan pie muffins are so scrumptious. I have a mini muffin pan that makes 20 muffins. This recipe filled 15 of them. I sprayed each one with Butter Flavored Pam - - that's it. No paper liners, no flour. Baked at 350 for 13 minutes, put down a wire cooling rack, and 14 of the 15 just popped right out when I flipped the pan over. I had absolutely no problem with them sticking or being hard to get out. (The trick is do not cook them for as long as the recipe says to.) I know I'll be making these little babies again this holiday season!

These were pretty good-husband and stepson ate them all...I only got one.
  Many people said they stuck to the pan; I used a large size muffin pan (22 mins.) and thoroughly greased it w/real butter and floured it well.  All my muffins popped out w/a knife as soon as I took them out of the oven.

Oh My... These little gems are INCREDIBLE!  Buttery and ever so addictive.  Followed recipe exactly, only doubling, found myself with the most insanely delicious, melty, teeny tiny pecan pies (in mini-muffin form).  After a few runs, experimenting with cook time, I found it better to short cook these slightly, so they won't harden up when cooled.  About 13 - 16 minutes cook time made for a perfect (when cooled) product.  Butter flavor Pam spray used on the muffin pan.  No sticking whatsoever.

These were good, undoubtfully, but they didn't have a catch on me. What is more, it isn't as syrupy as a pecan pie. Sorry, but I don't think I'll bake some again.

I thought these muffins were incredibly easy and very tasty.  Took them to a brunch and got numerous recipe requests.  I was worried that they would stick since it was mentioned in the other reviews but after spraying with cooking spray and dusting lightly with flour there were no problems.  Some may find them a little rich - - I think you could cut down on the butter a bit and be fine.  I will definitely be making these again!

These are so good. There is a company that sells mixes for Homemade dinner table appeal...I swear this is the same ingredients and there's cost $6.00 a mix and you still have to add eggs and butter. The only difference is the cost! Must use Mini tins!! Well Greased! Awesome muffins!

These little muffins taste great, but they stick to the tins a lot. I would definitely use paper liners - I had one entire batch ruined because I could not get them out of the tins - we had pecan topping instead of muffins!

OMG! These little babies are the bomb and that is something to be said coming from a southern girl who knows what a true pecan pie should taste like! I made one change by adding 1 1/2 tsp of pure vanilla extract otherwise everything else stayed the same. They are amazing!!!

These little treats are a staple around my house because everyone loves them.  Whenever I serve these to guests they always want the recipe.  TIP: I melt the butter before stirring it in.  That helps to determine how much to put in each cup before baking.  Someone mentioned that they were much thinner and overflowed in the oven once the butter melted in the recipe.  Also, my trick for having these come right out of the pan is to use a silicone mini muffin pan AND spray it lightly with cooking spray (without flour).  I loosen them around the edges as soon as I take them out of the oven, flip the pan over and voila, they fall right out.

This recipe definitely needs a bit of salt to round out the flavor.
Otherwise it is fine.

Had these the other day at a luncheon.  They were absolutely wonderful.  They are like mini pecan pies.  A crispy texture on the outside and slightly gooey in the middle just like a pecan pie.  Will have to make these myself this holiday season.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  A must try...

I made these last night and I thought they were not sweet enough, but this morning they tasted so yummy! Pecans are very expensive in Germany and I can't find them in stores unless I order them online, so I did a trial test with chopped walnuts. I baked them the full 25 minutes and I used a good quality, non-stick mini muffin tin from Wilton (I greased and floured the cups anyway). I can't really say that they tasted like walnut pie, in this case, but they were delicious nonetheless! I will make these again with pecans for the holidays. And a note for those who add more flour to the batter: please follow the recipe, otherwise, the muffins will have more of a cake-like texture. I also think that using a good quality pan is also key to avoiding the muffins from sticking to the pan. Thanks for sharing your recipe, prissycat!

Delish, fast and easy!!  I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the dry mix and 1 tsp vanilla to the wet.  Also be sure to take the time to prepare your pans or you will regret it!  I used silicone mini muffin pans which I buttered then floured lightly.  I will make these again!!

Thank you for saving my relationship. 
Okay, my relationship might not have needed saving, but this recipe 100% increased our chances of staying together forever. 
My only additions were a dash of cinnamon, cumin, chocolate chips, and salt to the flour mixture.
So incredibly highly recommended. I will be making this again. Hard.

These were absolutely divine!!! Only variation was that I added half a cup of pecans and half a cup of chopped almonds (reason was that I didn't have enough pecans). The result was really tasty and my husband loved the nut crunchiness the muffin had. Thanks for sharing!

Wow!! These are awesome!! I will admit that I was surprised. I followed the other's advice and used only 1/2 cup butter and added a splash of vanilla. I have made 24 mini muffins so far... and still have batter for more. Definately will be making these again!!

I wanted to add- I also at first tried the liners... they stuck really bad. So the next batch I made I just sprayed the mini muffin tin llike crazy and then right when they came out of the oven, I ran a plastic knife (so I wouldn't scratch the tin) around and under the muffins so they wouldn't stick. After doing that and them cooling for a couple of minutes, they popped right out. I think the trick is to loosen them in the tin before they cool. Everyone who tried these, have loved them (the 2nd batch with no liners). Thanks for sharing the recipe. I'll be making these around the holidays for the goodie gifts I give out... better than making a whole pie and so much easier!!

These were really good and moist.  They do stick to the muffin tin even with a good coating of shortening but popped out alright with a spoon.  I was expecting a little more flavor, but they are actually the right "muffin" taste- not too sweet and not too bland.  The recipe made 24 muffins for me and I baked them for 16 minutes to perfection.

A good finger food.  Used less butter because I didn't have the full amount.  The only thing I would change next time is to add some vanilla extract.

This is one of my favorite recipes! The crispy outside and gooey inside are perfect, especially in the mini muffins. I always add 1 tsp. of vanilla to mine though and it gives them a little extra flavor matching pecan pie.

i just made them and they are delicious. They just came out the oven and yumm yumm yumm! I took someone 's suggestion and added in a tad bit of vanilla to it and it came out great! The reason i gave this 4 stars is because i think it was a little too much butter. Next time i will use less butter, maybe a tablespoon or 2 less.

These are pretty good, but not awesome. I used regular-sized muffin tins and greased with butter. There was no problem with sticking. I think I was expecting more of the gooiness that you get with pecan pie. Next time I will lower the oven temp as one poster suggested and reduce the cooking time to 15 minutes.

This recipe is awful.  The muffins taste like pure sugar with loads of grease, and are excessively chewy.  It's a lot of trouble to prep the pans, as well, and the muffins still stick.  I should have known better when it called for mixing the brown sugar with the flour, while mixing the butter with the eggs.  As I should have expected, the butter formed into balls in the cold eggs.  I've never seen a recipe that didn't call for creaming the butter and sugar, then adding the eggs, and finally, adding those wet ingredients into the dry ones.  Did I mention, they smell terrible?

I just tried this recipes today and it was a success. I read the reviews about this recipe and some said that this recipe was more like a pecan tart without the crust, but I feel like it tasted like a muffin. The texture was more dense than a muffin, but the taste was definitely not as sweet as a tart. Also, I baked my mini pecan pie muffins in paper liners and they did not stick. In fact, the liner peeled off quite easily.

I tried this recipe with hopes of recreating a delicious, dense, buttery, pecan flavored muffin I had at a church potluck. Well these were very good, and had a similar taste, they weren't quite the same. First of all, I think these call for a tad too much butter...next time I make them, I'll reduce the amount slightly. I think the other muffins I tried had ground pecans as well. I really liked the pecan pieces in these, but I'm going to try it with the ground ones as well, just to see. Thanks for sharing the recipe...these are very good! I'll be making them again!!!

These were a hit. I used mini muffin tins that I sprayed well and had no problem with them sticking or being greasy. Just like a pecan pie without all the mess. Excellent recipe.

Great, easy recipe. I bake maybe once or twice a year and these came out perfect. I don't understand the expected yield. I used a mini muffin pan and got 45 bite-size mini muffins from the recipe. Perhaps my minis are mini-er than some. No sticking issues, either. I sprayed the tin with butter-flavored Pam before each batch, waited 1.5-2 minutes after removing the pan from oven, then dumped on the rack. Besides not sticking, these were not sticky-gooey like pecan pie. Instead they were delightfully chewy. Oh, I baked them for 14 minutes at 350 deg BUT our oven is probably on the low side--I didn't check with a thermometer. So on a good oven, I'd take a look at 12 minutes.

Super easy to make and so good.  They went quickly when I took them to church! Only problem I had was even though I sprayed my muffin liners, the muffins stuck to the liners really bad!

It's fantastic!  So easy and tastes just like pecan pie. I had this recipe for years and gave it to all my friends but the quantity for the flour was missing when I copied it for someone recently.  I'm so happy I found it on your list.  Thank you.

Excellent! I made these in a hurry and they came out perfect. I actually got more than 18 mini muffins...maybe because I added around 1 1/2 cups of pecans. I baked mine the full time because I like them crisp on top and chewy at the bottom instead of gooey. Will be making again ;)

5 star recipe! A must save for your recipe box. I sprayed my mini muffin tin with bakers joy spray very well and sprayed again each time before putting more batter in. They came out easily and pan clean up was a breeze. I put 1 tablespoon of batter in each cup and that was perfect. This is one of the best recipes on this site!

These make great little bite size treats for a pot luck dinner.  I used petite four paper baking cups and baked for 12 minutes.  They came out perfectly and are great for those who are watching their waist line (not me) and only want a little taste.  Probably won't be able to stop at one, however.  Thanks for sharing.

I made these muffins for Easter... and didn't have enough. Everyone wanted more and I made 2 batches. I did add just a little bit more flour the second time and they were great both times. You must cool them on a wire rack or glass plate. Don't use paper towels. The paper will stick to the muffin. Loved the recipe.

These are out of this world! I used walnuts the first time(that's all I had)and they were very good, but they were fantastic with pecans. I used the mini muffin tins (24 muffins) which was perfect for a bite-sized treat.  They turned out buttery crispy on the outside, and very tender on the inside. This "mini" size makes them perfect to take to a shower or a "tea".

These are chewy and rich and wonderful with a cup of coffee. I used melted Land O' Lakes margarine and coarsely chopped the pecans. My mini muffin tin is dark metal, so I used a 325F oven and 15 minutes baking time. I used a cookie scoop to plop the batter in the tins. Easy and fast!

These are simply amazing! I cannot believe how much they taste like pecan pie, they are incredibly good! I was skeptical at first, because only 5 ingredients, but I can't rave enough about them. Next time, I will add half cup chocolate chips, see how that is. They are perfect the way they are though!!

I made these this morning and they are terrific!  The only thing I did different was to add 1 tsp. vanilla to the butter and eggs.  I will absolutely be making these again and plan on having them on the breakfast table Christmas morning.

I really enjoyed them. Followed recipe as followed. Used liners no pam or crisco. But I think I need a little more sugar. Not as sweet as I wanted it. But its very good...just need a little more sugar in my opinion. Thanks for recipe.

Our family loves these - in fact, I made a plate of them for my mother on her birthday this year, as she is quite to pecan pie aficianado.  The first two times I made them last year, I used sprayed paper liners, but this was still problematic.  But we purchased slilcon muffin pans last spring, and those have made all the difference!  I spray the pans, and after they cool, the muffins pop right out with no problem.  (I know your not supposed to need to spray them, but with these sticky buggers, it helps.)

I haven't tried full-size muffins.  I find that with the sprayed silicon pans, I can get *exact;y* eighteen muffins, as I can fill close to the top, and space isn't taken away by the paper liners.  With the richness of these, larger muffins aren't needed.

This is a keeper for certain!

Easy, easy, easy. Didn't have any trouble with sticking - sprayed down the pan with Pam and then floured it.  Loosened the muffins with a knife when they were done, and they came right out.  I used a full-sized muffin tin, and recipe produced 9 muffins. Baked at 350 for 25 minutes. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.   Yummy.  I'll make these again.  Would be a good addition to Christmas breakfast.

OK, these little delights are so rich and wonderful. Do not overfill the muffin cups and make sure you use the mini muffin pans and use liners. They taste like little pecan pie bites and you really can't eat just one but you should as they are so rich. I made one batch and tasted them and immediately made another batch as they are so easy to make and so wonderful to eat. They freeze well and heat up nice if you can ever get any left over to freeze.

Every person who ate these loved them! I must say I was skeptical at first (only 5 ingredients) but wow! Delicious! I seemed to have a hard time getting the butter and eggs incorporated to the smooth texture as stated in the directions, so after three min. of beating, just mixed everything together and voila! I did however bake for 25 min. though. Thanks!

OK - these are fantastic little gems.  I've made them twice now and both times I used walnuts instead of pecan since that's what I had.  I also made them into mini muffins instead of the standard size.  My son loves these and he's not a real nut fan.  Thanks for sharing this recipe...I highly recommend it.

After reading all the horror stories about them getting stuck in the pan I did the following: I sprayed my mini-muffin tin with Pam, followed by a sprinkle of flour and sugar. I melted my butter, added 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla and because I have a dark pan I baked them at 325F for 15 minutes. As soon as they were done I popped them out of the tin without any problems at all. My husband and son loved them. Very fast and easy to make! Also, I ended up with 24 mini-muffins.

I previously started my review but accidentally submitted before I completed it. Sorry! I followed the recipe by using softened butter and I slightly beat the eggs. When I tried to mix this it was a total disaster. It was a huge glob. I had to it poured out and start over. I’ll began reading others reviews and made the following alterations. These turned out delicious and addicting!  The second time I melted the butter. This is extremely important and added a teaspoon of vanilla to the egg/butter mixture.  To the sugar, flour, pecan mixture I added a pinch of salt. I baked them in a dark, nonstick pan that I greased with shortening and dusted with flour. I lowered the temperature to 340 degrees due to a darker pan. I cooked each batch 25 minutes. I waited 2 minutes after I took them out of the oven, then I ran a butter knife around their edges to loosen them.  I immediately removed them from the pan and placed them on a cooling rack. Each one lifted out beautifully with no mess!  I used a mixture of smaller and larger pieces of pecans in my batter as well. THESE ARE SO DELICIOUS!

My, oh my, these little gems are delicious!  Rich and not too sweet, they are perfect little bites for a cup of coffee.  In my 12 muffin pan, I was only able to fill 1/2 full.  I placed a whole pecan in the center of each muffin before baking.  DH is SO disappointed I am making them to give away!

Love these mini muffins! I have made them
 twice. I had a little problem the first time with sticking.  This time, I used 1/3 cup butter and 1/3 cup canola oil (instead of 2/3 cup butter), No sticking and it didn't change the taste!

If you like pecan pie, you will love these super-easy little muffins. They are sweet, nutty and chewy, and not a cake-like "muffin" texture. I made a batch planning to use them on my holiday cookie and candy gift trays, but the "tasters" in my house left few for giving away. So I whipped up another batch in no time. I used the suggestion to dust the muffin tins with sugar after greasing them, and I had no problem getting the muffins out of the pan. I would like to try them in cupcake papers just for the sake of appearance....

This will be one of my go-to holiday goodie recipes from now on!!

I am a modest cook, not a baker or a chief. I am expanding my skill set. I like to follow recipes pretty close the first time.  These turned good.  My non-stick mini-muffin pan has 24 spaces, but it worked OK.  I did them for 21 minutes and with the second batch, of tiny muffins, I did for 19.5 minutes and improved results.  The pecan halves were on sale and cost less than my usual broken pieces so I added a half pecan to the top.  That was weird, chopping pecan halves to get chopped pecans.  I had sprayed and completely floured the pan.  I dumped a cup of flour into one part and then dumped it onto a flex cutting sheet.  Dumped that flour into another section and dumped it again onto the flex cutting sheet.  Repeat until all holes coated.  Remaining flour used for the recipe.  When I took them out of the oven and tapped them onto the table; those that did not pop out easy I prised them with a 1/2 inch wide spreader.  Only broke one, which I considered a volunteer for tasting.  Yummy and easy!  Clean up required soaking the pan a few minutes so reloading a double batch took longer than expected.  I froze my batch of 45 for a party.  The other two went to my preparing dinner for my wife.

I made this recipe exactly as written and sprayed my mini-muffin pan with Baker's Joy,  I baked them for 15-16 minutes, let them rest in the pan for 2 minutes,, and was able to remove them without any problems.  In fact, the pan barely needed washing!  My co-workers loved them!

Made these muffins last night. The cooking time ended up being 25 minutes longer. I used the large muffin tins, the butter melted into a liquid, making the batter soupy halfway thru cooking. They are now very heavy, but moist muffins. My husband loves them, I'm not a fan.

I don't usually like overly sweet stuff but didn't think these were sweet enough...  So, I melted some dark chocolate chips with milk in a microwave and used it to cover the top of each muffin.  I also made some candied pecans and put it on the top of the chocolate coating.  I personally didn't think too much of them but my husband thought they were REALLY good.

These are very good plain, or with minature chocolate chips in them too. Doesn't affect baking time or make them stick. I used a good quality mini muffin pan, and pam and sugar. YUM

These looked yummy, so I made a batch this afternoon for my kids who are coming for a visit. I made them just as the  recipe is written. I doubled the recipe. These ARE yummy...no changes necessary. I made mini muffins. The outside is chewey and the middles are soft. So good!! They taste like they are a lot more than this simple recipe. These could go to a pot luck or office party for dessert no problem!!! I got 56 muffins doubling the recipe. I've eaten 3 or 4 already. (-:

SUPER easy and EVERYONE loved them!! Here's what I did a bit differently. I used 1/2 cup of butter, added a splash of vanilla extract. I liberally sprayed my mini muffin tin with the baking spray/flour combo. It was store brand and I had zero issues with sticking. My pan was dark so as someone else suggested, I baked it at 325 for 15 minutes. PERFECT!!!

I decreased the sugar to 3/4c., decreased the butter to 1/2c., and added 2T. oatmeal, 1/4t. salt, and 1/2t. vanilla.  Very good!  I used cupcake liners and had no problems getting the muffins out.

Make them as mini-muffins. Perfect size for parties, and they won't fall apart on you. Not to mention you get more of that crispy, chewy crust. Spray the pan with Pam.

These delicious once I got past the fact that they are not "muffins".  They are really a crustless tart.  I wish I had known that before I made these for my kids for breakfast. The 4 and not 5 stars is not for the taste but the name. It is misleading but delicious all the same.

These were so delicious!  I used muffin liners and they did stick to them so will try the spray with flour next time - I had to run out and buy some of that so I can make them again soon.  Hubby can't stop eating them!

Made these and took the advice in other reviews to cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. They were great!  I had to cook them an extra 20 minutes until the toothpick test came out clean. Not sure if it was something I did or just not being used to the new oven but the extra time did not hurt them. They really do taste a lot like pecan pie!  I will be adding this recipe to my list of usuals!

These are yummy muffins however they're definitely a little greasy on the outside [which I can taste, husband can't] and they're a little dry.  Still great, just not excellent.

These are yummy little muffins! I made a few small changes - once my butter was melted I realized that there was a bit extra, about 3/4 C, so I added a little more flour to compensate. I also reduced the sugar to 3/4 C, and baked mine for 20 mins. The recipe made 12 nice, small little muffins that are perfect with tea in the morning! I sprayed my tins with regular cooking spray and added a little flour, they didn't stick at all.

Interesting muffins! My family enjoyed them although I think you cut back on the butter a little. I made them as is and thought they were a little "greasy." I also made 12 regular size muffins and cooked them about 7 minutes longer and it was great!

This is the first time I've reviewed anything - but this was so good. :)  I did cut the butter down to 1/2C and baked it 22 minutes, and it was too long.  I'll bake it for 20 minutes next time.   They were fantastic!

Very tasty, but I could see adding some vanilla. DO NOT OVERFILL MUFFIN CUPS OR OVERBAKE. They are a S.O.B. (sorry) to remove from the pan. I sprayed a nonstick pan and had a terrible time getting them out. I was planning to take some to my mom and sister, but they are too ugly. Guess I will have to eat them all myself, they ARE good.

I have made this before but use 1/2 cup chopped pecans.  I spoon the mixture in regular-sized paper-lined muffin tins and bake the same amount of time. Makes 8 muffins.

I made these last weekend in anticipation of/celebration of Thanksgiving.  The recipe is perfect as is.  It's amazing what these five ingredients can do, honestly (although some people I made it with expressed concern about the amount of butter and sugar the recipe asked for-- but then again, that's the nature of pecan pie)!  I made them in regular-size muffin tins and didn't have too much trouble popping them out.  I greased the tin with butter, then dusted with confectioner's sugar.  This seemed to do the trick.  The muffins went really quickly, and quite a number of my friends said that they were "even better than actual pecan pie!"  I've gotten a lot of requests for another batch ;)

My goodness...these are so good! Crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. I sprayed my pan with olive oil instead of using paper cups and they were done in 15 minutes. Taste just like homemade pecan pie! Yum!

These were a great way to start the day.  Being that I am a huge pecan pie fan these muffins were were perfect for breakfast because they were not as sweet as a pecan pie but were sweet enough for breakfast! I had a small problem getting them out ot the pans.  Might try making in a pie tin like a coffee cake.

Just finished my first one of these and had to write a review and I've never been impressed enough with a recipe to do that. These are the best muffins I've ever made. I went strictly by the recipe except to add one half tsp. of salt, with that much sugar I felt it may have needed it. I also used paper liners and sprayed them with Crisco spray, odd I know but it worked perfectly. Do yourself a favor and make these, you won't be sorry!

These are simply delicious. They tend to stick to the paper cups, so I've started making them without. One batch of these is never enough. As soon as they come out of the oven, my kids are begging to eat them! And they're so easy to make! Thanks for the recipe!

This was an easy and tasty little muffin recipe. It made 2 dozen little muffins so it would be perfect for a group.  I generously greased and floured the mini muffin pan so I had no problem with the muffins sticking.

very tasty. I let them get nice and brown on the edges and they were yummy! I don't have a mini pan, so I used a regular size and divided it evenly into 12 cups. I sprayed and floured the pan and then ran a knife around the edges before trying to get them out. They came out fairly well, but a few broke or left a middle chunk in the pan - but those are the bits the chef gets to taste! Try this recipe for sure!

These were good, but quite greasy.  I prefer chololate if it's not good for me, so these wouldn't be my first pick on a dessert buffet.  But for pecan lovers, they are great.  I took them to my adult Sunday School class as a snack, and they liked them.

These are awesome! Hard to believe there are only 5 ingredients. Next time I would melt the butter instead of just soften it. I also found that they only need to cook for 15 minutes.

I made this recipe the other day and it was fabulous.  It was so easy to make and tasted sooo good.  I don't think I have ever tasted a muffin that tasted better than this one.

These are "out of this world" delicious! I had no trouble getting them out of the pan because I liberally sprayed tins with butter-flavored Pam. Made 12 regular size muffins. Didn't change anything--unless using Jumbo eggs & pulverized pecans due to using my chopper counts as changing. :o)THANKS!

WOW......these are absolutely decadent!!! I followed the advice of some and decreased the butter to l/2 c and added l teaspoon of vanilla.  The tops are crispy and the insides moist, and the flavor is out of this world! I was able to get 2 dozen mini muffins. I baked them for l8 minutes on the lower rack. Watch so they don't overbrown. I had some problem with them sticking to the greased and floured pans. Cool them for a couple of minutes before attempting to remove from pans.  You may have to loosen the tops with a knife if they go over the edge, as mine did.  Next time I will be using paper liners. I used a cookie scoop, which worked great. The size is perfect to serve with Sunday brunch. Wonderful recipe!

Very tasty - but I agree with others - was too greasy - my second batch I changed the butter to 1/2 cup and added 2 tablespoons of oatmeal - very good compliment to the flavor.  I will continue to work with this recipe as everyone loves the flavor!

Great recipe!  I followed as directed and they came out perfect.  Mine were a tad greasy on the bottom, but after reading comments about sticking, I believe I went a little overboard with greasing the tins.  By the way, the recipe says it makes 18, but there was plenty of batter to make 24 muffins.

This was a totally awesome tasting recipe.  The presentation is awful.  I heavily greased and floured my miniature muffin pans and I still could not get them to come out as one piece.  I will make this again but not sure what pan I will use.  Maybe if the dough doesn't 'travel' too much I will spoon it out onto a cookie sheet.

Excellent! I used gluten free flour instead of regular flour and they still turned out very nicely. I did add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp baking soda to the dry ingredients and 1 tsp of vanilla to the butter and eggs. I thought the baking soda will fluff them up a bit. Definitely a keeper and very easy to make.

These muffins are delicious.  Anytime I take them anywhere, they are a hit.  I always include them in my Christmas baking.  Just five ingredients make these a cinch to make.  I use mini muffin tins which I spray generously with cooking spray.  They took 15-17 minutes.  Turn them out onto a cooling rack as soon as they come out of the oven.

I made these with chopped almonds, and some of my coworkers liked them better than with the pecans. I have also made the with the Sahale Valdosta Blend Pecans, the cranberries give them an extra punch.

I cut down the butter to 1/2 a cup, as I thought 2/3 was way too much, and it still came out extremely buttery, almost dripping with butter! I don't understand how most people gave this such a good rating. I guess they love the butter taste! All in all, it was not an absolute disaster, but they were wayyy too rich, and lacking a bit of flavor. Perhaps adding some vanilla and chocolate chips to the batter in addition to cutting down on the butter even more, would make these much better.

Definitely cut down on the cooking time. I went for 20 and should have gone for 15. I used the paper liners and they still stuck, but were delicious. I took the advice of the cooking oil, flour, and crisco mix the second time and they did just pop right out. I would definitely use that tip. I also added the vanilla, but don't think it is necessary. My boyfriend was practically eating the paper from the first batch. This is a keeper. A perfect addition to brunch!!!

I made 12 full size muffins from this recipe. I greased and floured the pans VERY well and they still stuck. My sister and my mother did enjoy them though. I may try to make them again, but probably not any time soon.

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because of the difficulty trying to get these out of the pan in one piece, even though I used nonstick pans and greased them generously. Next time I will try the spray with flour. Otherwise, we ate all of them, broken or not :)

The review below from Valeries Kitchen really says it all, these are fabulous and more-ish a kind of cross between a muffin and a cookie, and especially dont overfill your pan because they dont rise that much.  These popped right out of the tin, and were gone before they could cool down.  I had intended to try splitting them and putting a nice slice of ripe banana and a dot of sweetened cream in there, but next time I will know to make two batches LOL  There is nothing better than people heaping praise on your head for something so ridiculously easy.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

LOVED these! I sprayed a mini-muffin pan with non-stick spray and getting the muffins out was a breeze. These are nice and crunchy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.

oh, my, oh, my.  we make these a lot for breakfast, as well - we use whole wheat flour.  my next door neighbor shamelessly asks me to make them for her... i'll be taking them to share at my next Bible study!!  i, too, made them as mini-muffins, lots of baking spray and no paper liners.

I absolutely loved these......greased and floured the mini muffin pans and they just popped out.  Im actually afraid to make them again, because I ate 3/4 of them all by myself~gasp.  Next time I will make them to take to a potluck/party, so I wont be tempted to devour them all!!!

Absolutely incredible!!  What makes these mini muffins worth shouting from the rooftops about is that everyone raves about the taste, asks for the recipe, and you only spent minutes whipping them up from ingredients you already had in your kitchen.  It doesn't get any better than that!

I LOVED the texture of these little bites of heaven...the tops were chewy, edges were crispy...SO hard to believe that these 5 simple ingredients could taste SO much like pecan pie!!  I used an unsprayed nonstick mini-muffin pan & they popped RIGHT OUT!  I was only confused when trying to beat the butter and eggs together...they DID NOT combine until "smooth".  But...everything worked out fine in the end anyway.  Will DEFINITELY make these again!

Even though my first attempt was not successful - they really tasted good. I don't recommend spraying the tins with Pam - mine stuck! Next time I will use paper liners - spray them like crazy - and sugar them as another reader suggested. Do you have to let them cool completely before eating them - maybe then they won't stick.

I love these! I picked up this recipe from somewhere else. I made 12 large muffins and cooked them for 15-20 minutes. I make pecan bars with a cake mix but these are much easier and faster when you want to get a pecan pie fix!

the only reason i rated theses only 4 stars was because T's mom wrote that we could line the muffin pans with paper muffin liners - i did and it was a real problem to remove the paper.  what little muffin we could scrape off the paper was really delish.  i'll try these again but will grease and flour the pans really well.

I used regular size papers and did just what the recipe called for and I think 5 stars is not enough. Everybody that tried them wowed over them. I have made 4 batches and have had no trouble at all. A little messy to put in cups but worth the trouble.

The consistency of these muffins was very strange, and I'm really surprised that nobody has commented on it thus far.  I baked my muffins for about 25 minutes, and they were still *raw* in the middle - but were they?  Is that supposed to be how they look (ie. like pecan pie?) Who knows....but I baked mine for an additional 10 minutes...they tops of them are very hard, but they're still edible.  Also important to note that I don't have mini muffin tins, so I used a large muffin pan - and made 11 muffins.  **EDIT** this was my initial review, but after eating a number of these muffins, I would like to change my rating from 2 stars to 4.  Although it still isn't clear what the cooking time should be, the flavour of these muffins is excellent and I will make again for sure!

Sooooo good! Tastes just like pecan pie as the name suggests. And with the mini-muffin tin, they look similar to and are just as good as pecan tarts but easier to make! Loved this recipe!

My husband loved them, and I thought they were ok.  Pecan Pie is not my favorite flavor.  You must, must, must spray the muffin papers.  I made regular sized muffins and the recipe made eleven muffins.  Maybe a 1/2 a cup of chocolate chips would perk this up to my taste next time?

Makes for a good snack, goes great with coffee or tea, easy to make, a bit on the sweet side so can reduce amount of sugar by a tad.

I made it as written and I thought the taste was good, but they were just a bit greasy!  I think I would cut back just a bit on the butter, or maybe a bit on the nuts as well.  Otherwise, it was easy and tasty.

These are delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except for the addition of 1/2 tsp vanilla, which I will up to 1 tsp next time. I used regular sized muffin tins, as I don't own a mini-muffin tin. My tins are stainless steel, and I sprayed them with bakers joy. Filled each halfway, made 12 muffins, but they are not tall. They don't rise much and end up about the same size as the raw dough you filled them with. They took about 20 minutes to bake, the edges were crispy and I didn't want to over-bake them, so I removed them from the oven and immediately ran a knife around the edges. I used a small silicone spatula to remove them carefully to a wire rack. No sticking whatsoever!
I ate 4 of them within 20 minutes, that says a lot!

Whoever suggested not using muffin liners was spot on! They were kinda hard compared to my second batch that I made without the liners. They were more "muffiny".  Also, I only cooked for 20 minutes and then let cool/cook with the oven open. I like my muffins soft and doughy on the inside and a little more firm on the edges bottom and top!

These are absolutely wonderful. Very moist and they really taste like pecan pie.  I baked 17 min. like another person suggested.  I think if I went longer than that they would have dry and hard.

These are very simple to make and absolutely delicious.  The first batch I made the butter wasn't soft enough and, inspite of using a hand mixer, the butter / egg mixture came out lumpy.  The muffins still turned out great.  I made the second batch with melted butter so the egg and butter mixture turned out creamy.  I double the recipe so that i could make 12 full sized muffins instead of 18 mini muffins. My family loved them and so did I.

These little muffins were delicious after a second attempt with the following changes from original recipe.   Use 1/2 cup melted butter instead of 2/3 cup softened butter.  Cook for 15 minutes,  not 20.  Do not use paper liners.  Spray mini muffin pan with Bakers Joy non stick baking spray.  Recipe makes 24 mini muffins.

These turned out very tasty, however, I did have some problems.  I had trouble mixing the eggs and butter, so these were "standing" in grease when they were baked.  I think next time I will cut the butter to 1/2 cup and use a mixer to combine the eggs and butter.  Definitely need to use mini-muffins,  I did with liners and they came out easily.  I almost over baked them at 20 minutes.  Next time, I'll do 17 minutes.

I have made these many times. I usually end up making about 6 or 8 batches for everyone for Christmas. My brother loves them and eats his and his wife’s also. I had to hide some more for her in a gift I told her not to open until later last year! These are the perfect gift for everyone in my family and all of my friends also. I have a native pecan tree in my yard that I collect pecans from and shell them then make the muffins. It’s hard work but extremely worth it because the tiny pecans have way more flavor than anything you can buy at a store!!!

With everyone having troubles getting them out of the pan or muffin cups, I decided to use parchment baking cups. They did not stick in the least. Give it a try!

I make these all the time but add toffee bites, cinnamon and nutmeg to the mix. I also roast my pecans before I put them in the batter.

I made these using 1/3 cup butter and 1/3 cup coconut oil.  Melted both and added to dry ingredients!  I also used 2/3 cup chopped pecans and 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips and some cinnamon (maybe about 1/4 tsp?). They are still in the oven, but look good!  I'm trying some in mini muffins, and some in regular sized muffins.  I will update my review when I try them! (Wanted to note all my changes for my own future reference, haha!)

Easy to make and was a hit at the office!  Suggest adding more brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla extract for that extra homemade flavor.

These are tasty, and pretty simple to make. I replaced about a quarter of the flour with oats, which worked well and gave them a nice texture. I greased and floured my muffin pans, and didn't have a problem with them sticking. Next time I'll probably try reducing the butter and sugar a little, since they are VERY rich, and perhaps using half oats instead of a quarter. Be aware that these are desserts in muffin shape!

Oh WOW - if you like pecan pie - you will LOVE these muffins. Reading other reviews cutting the butter by half and then melting butter will aid in mixing together. One of my friends came over when making these for church - so we made a lot and used miniature size muffins and paper cupcake liners. A little batter did stick to the liners of a couple we 'sampled'. Next time I will use a whole grain flour and increase from half cup to 3/4, there is a lot of sugar in these, but oh how sweet!  A full size muffin - would be a lot of sugar, I will play with this recipe a lot. Thank you Prissycat for sharing.

Wonderful rich crunchy pecan flavor.  My hubby who isn't a pecan fan though they were "really good" and "not too sweet".  (Next time, I'm trying toasted walnuts instead of pecans just to change it up.). Listening to other reviewers, I buttered and floured my non-stick mini muffin tins and the muffins came right out after sitting in the tin for a couple of minutes after baking.  I also added 1/2 tsp salt to enhance the flavors and a 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I baked them for 20 minutes and got a nice crunch to the outside yet tender in the middle.  Next time I'm going to reduce the baking time to try some that are still gooey in the middle as also suggested by reviewers. That would make them even more pecan pie like!  Thanks for a versatile, easy and pantry friendly muffin recipe!

Hey guy!!!
The secret to the muffins not sticking and baking right is using parchment cup liners!
Bake then for 20 min (make sure you know your accurate oven temp ).
I've been making these for years.
The liners make all the difference :)

Easy and simply amazing!!! It taste like a butter cookies and a sugar smashed together. Crusty on the outside and an almost cake like texture in the inside. I dare u to have just one. I had to cook mine in a large muffin tin, cooked it for 26 mins no later then that.

I made these last night.  They are delicious.  I did add some vanilla though and cut down the amount of butter to 1/2 cup.  They are STICKY!  So when spraying your pan or muffin liners, spray liberally!!!!!  I sprayed my liners and they still stuck, but not enough to stop my hubby from gobbling them up!

I will definitely be keeping these in my go to folder.

How I could possibly not have come across this recipe before now is beyond me.  If you like Pecan Pie, don't hesitate, MAKE IT!  

Oops, I did follow the suggestion of one reviewer  and melted the butter first, pour it  into the dry ingredients, then the beaten eggs. . . .

Great flavor!  I must be doing something wrong... Mine never consistently turn out right.  They stick to the edge of my muffin pan.  I still continue making them, because they are so good.

I use the ingredients as written. I use regular muffin tins lined with foil cupcake liners. I spray the liners with cooking spray. I bake for 20 minutes and they turn out crispy on the outside and nice and ooey gooey on the inside, just like pecan pie.

Had a feeling these were going to be delish!  Doubled the recipe, and they were AWESOME!! Didn't have spray for pan, used cupcake liners, and they DID stick to the liners...but my grandkids, and the big "kids" too, loved them so much, they were eating the goody off the liners!!!! Needless to say, they were a big hit!  Grandson said "Wow, gotta have more of these"... after he gobbled up 4 regular-sized muffins!

This is the first recipe I've ever made that has come out correctly-- so that tells you my skill level, hah!  My mother was so surprised to love these. I'm not known for my culinary abilities, but she couldn't get enough! I make these in mini form, and they are rather poppable. Really good!

These muffins are super delicious.  I use non-stick mini muffin pans and spray with Pam and sprinkle with sugar.  Never had a problem with sticking.  I add a teaspoon of vanilla otherwise I follow the recipe as written.  They never last a day in our house.

These muffins were delicious, and very easy to make, but I didn't use the full amount of butter the 2nd time..Just too much and too rich.I used regular size muffin tins with paper liners..I also used walnuts since I did not have any pecans and they were still very good..Toasting the nuts first really makes these muffins tasty..I served them last night to friends and they all loved them...

These tasted pretty decent, but were an aesthetic disaster. I did all the things that should have worked. I used a quality mini muffin pan, I greased it, I sugared it, I made sure to cook them long enough (less than the stated time...they were quite dark after 18 minutes), and I gently loosened them after taking them from the oven. 

Still, most of them fell apart. 

They taste ok, but a lovely box full of crumbs does not make for a great "please forgive me" gift.

After reading of all the trouble everyone had getting the muffins out of the tins, I thought to use the silicone ones. Had a set of 12 that I bought at Home Goods. Worked perfectly although, when I took them out of the oven, I thought they would never come out. But, after cooling, they worked perfectly. I used  1/2 cup of butter and added some vanilla. Will definitely make these again.

These are delicious. However I would NOT recommend using paper muffin liners. You can not get the paper off the muffin. Just grease and flour pan and pour in pan. Other than that this is a great recipe.

These were good, took the advice of previous reviews and added 1/2 cup butter, melted and some vanilla. Greased a non-stick mini-muffin pan, then sprinkled with sugar, a few stuck a bit on the bottom in the middle but not too badly. They are tasty but fiddly to deal with the pan. My husband loved them though!

I make these often, using mini muffin tins. They are nothing to look at, but they are delicious! I follow the recipe exactly, topping each muffin with a pecan half. Use one tablespoon per muffin and don't overfill or they will have ugly tops. These freeze very well. PS: I don't bother flouring the pans, but use a good baker's spray.

No one believes that I didn't pick these up at the local bakery. My kids, grand kids and my wife were blown away. Two dozen lasted less than 34 hours. I did add a quarter cup of confectioners sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter. WOW!!! This is one incredible recipe    James In Pittsburgh Pa

I followed the recipe and loved the "pecan pie" taste.  The only thing missing was a crust.  I gave it 4 stars because the people I served them to, thought the muffins weren't done.  (However my husband devoured 6 when I got home)!  I'll will try it again but cut back on the butter and maybe add 1/4 flour.  I never have any problems getting my muffins out of the silicone muffin cups and find that I can spray lightly with Pam and they always fall out (all recipes fall out). To serve them warm, put them in a basket with a warm bread stone and leave them in their silicone cups.

Love this recipe... however, if you use mini muffin tin, and use muffin cups, you must spray them as well as they will stick to the paper and ruin them!  I have made them before using a light alum mini cupcake pan and sprayed it with the flour baking spray and it worked great.  Tonight I made them using mini muffin cups and they're stuck to the paper.  I'm so sad!   I must say they're yummy, moist and a big hit, just be careful about prepping the pan, and use spray with flour.  Also, DO NOT OVERCOOK.

These started to rise like a muffin should, then spread out over the top of the muffin "holes" in the muffin pan.  They tasted good but I had to invert them when I removed them and called them "little hats" because they were flat and had a brim.  I have made them several times and this always happens.  I have bought fresh flour and done all I know to do, following the recipe.  Did anyone else have this problem and solve it?  Help me if you did.  Could I have been filling the mini muffin hole too full?  They taste wonderful but I would like  them to look better.

I made these as mini muffins.  I liberally sprayed the tins with baking spray and turned the muffins out as soon at they came out of the oven. I had no problem with sticking.After tasting one, I felt they needed something, so I drizzled them with a browned butter frosting.  That really help the flavor and appearance.  They were definitely better the second day.

These are very tastey!
I made two batches. The first batch I cooked for 20 minutes and it was way to long and I burnt the bottoms of most of them. I cooked the second batch for 15 minutes and that worked fine. I used paper liners and mini muffin pans. They do stick to the liner so I plan to pull the muffins out of the liners before I serve them at a breakfast potluck I made them for. If I make again I will try cooking spray as others have used.

Sooo easy! I first saw this recipe in our home town newspaper and it was the same with the exception of 1/2 cup of butter (1 stick) melted. I just beat the 2 eggs with a whisk and then stir in the melted butter, and then add to the dry ingredients....easy and no big mess! I did use paper liners which were perfect. They were even better the next day, warmed and a little ice cream on top!  It really is a nice dessert as well as a muffin :)

So so yummy! I was actually searching for these after having a homebased business one and these turned out better!!!! My brown sugar was old and I had to use butter spray but they were still good, I can't wait to make them again with better ingredients! I did add the vanilla like one reviewer suggested because I love vanilla! I used Pam with flour for baking spray and had NO trouble getting them out!!!!

What a funny recipe!  Even though it doesn't really say it, they are definitely more of a dessert or snack recipe.  I assumed that when I saw that the recipe calls for more sugar than flour!  They are SO good though.  Even though they are loaded with butter and sugar, you don't need to feel too guilty if you cook them in the mini muffin tins as directed.  Super easy and only 5 ingredients.  This made enough batter for me to fill my 2 mini muffin tins (24 muffins) and I had batter left over.  Don't overfill or they will spread out and bake over the top of the tin and you'll need to cut them apart.  I added 1 tsp.of vanilla.

The results are so flavorful you'd swear there were more ingredients.  I ran out of brown sugar so I substituted molasses and white sugar, then backed off on the egg.  It still came out so well that I couldn't stop eating them!  I'd like to make them again for friends and parties, but I'm afraid they'll never get to try them.

Delicious!! I had tried the Homemade Gourmet mix and wanted to recreate it from scratch.  This recipe was the answer. I used whole wheat flour and sprinkled chocolate chips on top of the 12 muffins.  Thanks T's Mom!

These were soooo good! I must have had tiny muffin pans because I got 24 out of this recipe.  I sprayed the pans (didn't use liners) and cooked them for about 18 minutes.  They came out perfectly, not gooey at all.  I was looking for recipes for the Days of Unleavened Bread and this recipe is definitely a keeper.  Will make it year-round.  Thanks for sharing.

They were delicious, will definately make again. I did use 1 tbs. less butter, beat eggs before adding to the butter, filled each muffin with 1 tbs. of batter, sprayed with Bakers Joy and baked only 15 minutes. I was able to get 30 muffins this way. My family loved them.

I tried these last night.  Here's my experience.  The dough was sticky enough to fight going into the cups.  However, I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor of these muffins, and will make them again.  I bought chopped pecans, but chopped them a bit finer, since the cups are so small, and some of the pieces were still quite big.  Enjoy these, they are worth it!

These are awesome! I served them at a party on a platter with a bowl of Cool Whip in the middle. A double recipe was gone in no time. I did not beat the eggs before adding the butter with the first batch. They tasted good, but they turned out looking much better the second time when I did beat the eggs beforehand. Very good recipe.

I wasn't very impressed with these when I took them out of the oven, but they have grown on me during the course of the evening! They were much heavier than I expected them to be, but this isn't really a bad thing. They have the texture and consistency of cake more than muffin. I used metallic muffin cups, and I wonder if that made them easier to get out of the wrapper. Also I used a handful of choc chips for a little sweetness. Thank you!
