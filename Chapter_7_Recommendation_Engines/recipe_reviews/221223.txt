Made this exactly as the recipe says and it was quite flavorful but the volume of liquid was too much so it was kind of soupy and had to be strained to get to the tasty morsels.  I'll definitely make this again but will cut back on either the liquid from the tomatoes or the beef broth just a tad.  Yummmm!

This recipe was wonderful. I placed everything in my slow cooker the night before. I didn't have beef broth so I just added chicken broth. I did add a little extra chili powder and only used one jalapeno pepper. All I can say is yum!

I thought this recipe was awesome! I did not have the chili-seasoned diced tomatoes, I just used regular canned diced tomatoes and upped the chili powder amount to 1 Tbsp. Once the meat was done cooking I put everything EXCEPT the meat into a pot on the stove and simmered it down. Once the most of the liquid evaporated I used an immersion blender to puree the tomatoes and onions. Then I returned everything back to the slow cooker and kept it on warm till it was time to eat. My family loved it. I served it with shreded oxaca cheese and diced onions and cilantro.

Made this for a party and it was a big hit! Instead of broth I used dried onion soup mix and added a cup of water since it was all I had. AMAZING!

These are no fuss indeed and real easy to make. Taste-wise, it is alright. It does not taste bad, just ordinary.

Loved how easy the prep was. Disliked the excess liquid. However, I did take all the vegetables (tomatoes and onions) and pureed them after the meat was completely cooked. As an added bonus, I put in some smoked paprika (my little addiction) and used sweet onions instead of yellow. I let the meat simmer in the pureed broth for another hour or two and the meat was divine! Tacos were an absolute hit!

Great recipe!  I followed the recipe but took the advice of others.  I did not use the beef broth at all.  There was plenty of liquid.  Could have drained the tomatoes and use the broth instead.  But no need for both.  Oh, darn!  I did do something different.  I used a chipotle in adobo sauce instead of fresh jalapeños.  And jarred roasted pablanos instead of green chiles.  Love the coffee idea!  Great recipe thank you for sharing.

This is a really good recipe. Taste vary so I followed the directions as stated and then altered to suit my taste.  I did a taste test when the meat was done, and concluded it needed more of something.   I added another tsp. of chili powder, another tsp. of cumin.  It made a lot of liquid which I strained from the meat and reduced to half by boiling for several minutes.  Did another taste test and realized it needed some sugar.  I added 2 Tbsp. of sugar (to offset the acidic flavor) and another tsp. of salt.  Then I thickened the liquid with some corn starch (make sure your liquid is boiling and use about a Tbsp. of cornstarch and 4 Tbsp.or so of cold water, mix well and add to boiling liquid.  Then I added the nice thickened reduction sauce to the meat and mixed it together really well.  I made quesadilla's with a Mexican blend cheese, topped it off with some hot queso cheese dip (We like Gordo brand), homemade salsa and homemade guacamole, and sour cream and voila! It was a OMG make this again from my family.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!

I love this recipe and my slow cooker.  I have found the slow cooker to be a great way to roast meets.  Especially with beef, I have found out too much liquid added during cooking can actually dry out the meat.  So, left in all the goodness and left out all the liquid...turned out amazing.

This was so good... the only problem is... as others have said, there's a lot of liquid.  I used a strainer to get out the meat and tomatoes, but it tasted really good.  I'm going to work with this a bit.  Thanks so much for sharing.

SO GOOD! Thanks to all the posts before, I didn't use the beef broth, the canned chili's I used were Hatch green chili's (for a bit more heat) and I used habanero chili powder. I thought my tweaks might make it too spicy, but yoozah it was good. My husband raved about it.  This is definitely a keeper!

It inspired me. Bravo for the coffee idea. I'd have never come up with that on my own. Just threw a cross rib roast in the crockpot, onions and red and green bells, a jar of salsa, garlic, salt, pepper and a little cinnamon. Added water. Cooked on a high for two hours then turned to low and went to bed. Outrageous! The coffee made the liquid amazing.

The meat turns out extremely tender, and is flavorful. Tortillas don't hold up well unless you use a slotted spoon to drain the meat. I saved the broth from the crockpot and used it, and some of the leftover meat, as a soup base for beef vegetable barley the next day. It made a delicious soup by adding a quart of store bought beef broth, a bag of frozen mixed veggies, and a cup of barley. I'm going to use the rest of the meat to make enchiladas tonight. Will make again!

i used 1.8lbs of roast. i used half a can of 14oz diced tomatos. i skipped the coffee (weird, and eating in the evening) cooked for 12 hours and was good. i checked after 6 hours as suggested and in no way was my 1.8lb roast teady to be pulled. skip the excessive liquid in half at least is my suggestion.

These are no fuss and the meat is tasty and flavorful but I doesn't taste like tacos (which is what I wanted for my birthday). I cooked the meat for 5 hours (I have a great slow cooker) shredded it and mixed it and put it back in and its just okay to me. I drained both cans of tomato (I used spicy red pepper tomatoes), used actual chiles instead of the cans, added extra chili powder and some Lawrys seasoning salt. It still only okay to me. I really wanted tacos but I guess I can turn it into a delicious quesidilla (sp?). The meat is very flavorful and cutting the liquid but still having enough to make the meat stay nice and tender was an added bonus. I'll make it again but next time I will definitely be adding taco seasoning. The spiciness is amazing!

I used this recipe on Thursday and we loved it.  I did do just two tweaks to the recipe due to what I read from others. I strained the second can of tomatoes to try and keep the amount of liquid down.  I also added to habaneros to the pot.  After 8 hours, most of the heat from habaneros is lost, so it was not too spicy.  We will definitely be making this again.  This is the best shredded beef recipe we have used to date.

Thanks!

Cooked the meat about 9 hours and it just fell apart... so moist and tender.  I did not add the beef broth, to cut back on liquid. It definitely makes a LOT of 'juice' as it's cooking.  I decided to ladle out the juice at about 8 hours and strain and simmer on the stovetop to get an enchilada sauce.  I wrapped the beef, shredded cheddar and fresh cilantro in corn tortillas and placed in baking dish, topped with the sauce and ended up with pretty good beef enchiladas!  I still have 1/2 the meat left (we are only a family of 4 and this was 2-3 meals of meat for us)... will make shredded beef tacos with the rest in a day or two.  Or, might dice it up and make a "Chili Colorado".. that would be fast and easy with this meat!  In any case, this recipe opens possibilities for all types of meals.  I also added smoked paprika to mine and left the jalapenos out, was a nice flavor for us.

This was fantastic! I followed the guidance of other reviewers and omitted the beef broth. I used canned Rotel tomatos with chili and added a 1/2 teaspoon of smoked paprika and one jalapeño. I let it cook for 10 hours and when I removed the meat from the pot it was literally falling apart. Shredded the beef and removed about 2 cups of liquid before putting the beef back in. Served it with corn on the cob with a compound butter with taco seasoning. Easy, just mixed salted butter with taco seasoning, spread on the corn and wrapped in foil. Grilled the corn as well as lightly grilling the taco shells and tortillas. Easy crowd favorite!

I made this exactly as instructed. Turned out amazingly delicious. The meat was so tender, it easily pulled apart.  This recipe is a keeper. Highly recommend.  Here's what I noted: (1.) The spice measurements can easily be adjusted to taste, I think next time I might increase them slightly, we like things on the spicy side. (2.) Like other reviewers, I found that there was way too much liquid. After cooking & shredding the meat, I used only about 1/3 of the liquid to mix back in with the meat. There was so much liquid remaining that I ended up straining it (adding back the tomatoes, onions, peppers, etc) and used this as a base for chili the following night. (3.) Added some BBQ sauce to leftovers and it was delicious. The spices the meat was cooked in mixed with the BBQ added a depth of flavor that was to die for. However, this pulled  beef recipe can stand on its own two feet without the BBQ sauce, as well.

This was a great recipe. I am a busy mom and teacher so I make big batches of freezer meals all at once. This month we made 30 meals. We did several recipes that included other taco, fajita, and Tex-Mex marinated meats. This was our favorite. This marinade goes great with pork too. We saved the roast juices for Caldo because it made a great base.

I tried this recipe with venison. It turned out really well and I think the coffee did help tenderize the meat. Like other reviewers suggested, I decreased the liquid by more than half (left out the beef broth) but it still had a lot of liquid. Next time I will drain the tomatoes but I will make the recipe again.

This is a tremendous recipe.  I cooked my chuck for 10 hrs overnight in the crock pot.  Every one enjoyed it.  The next day I washed off the beef in a collander, added BBQ sauce, slowly heated and served it as BBQ beef sanwiches on onion rolls.  Guess I can't shake the restauranter in me and waste any food.

This is pretty darn yummy.  There is quite a bit of liquid but I think its necessary to keep the beef moist.  You can toss the liquid or use it for something else like gravy.  The only changes I would make is to use a couple beef bouillon cubes or some additional sea salt.  The beef had a fantastic flavor, was super tender and made perfect tacos.  I would actually give this four and a half stars.  The only other suggestion would be to use maybe one can of diced tomatoes with habanero for an extra spicy kick.

My 2 boys (husband and 14 yr old son) loved this recipe. I have to say, I found it pretty tasty myself. I made it close to the recipe. I used a can of rotelle instead of tomatoes and at the end threw in a can of low sodium black beans, because thats just the way we roll. I added a little fresh cilantro and squeezed in a bit of lime. I made some guacamole and we added shredded cheese and chopped onions with soft shell tortillas.  We all loved the shredded beef instead of the traditional ground beef. I will certainly make this again. Yes, it was pretty brothy, but I used a slotted spoon so really, no big deal. :) Yum!

Fantastic, but I added 2 tbsp of fresh squeezed lime juice and some chopped cilantro.  The juice can also be drained off afterwards and the meat fried for again, a different meal served with shredded cabbage, homemade mayo ketchup, served on fried tortillas - just like we used to eat when I lived in Costa Rica.

This was great. I only left out the coffee because I was just too skeptical. I will double the recipe next time or start with half amount of listed coffee to ease my weird ingredient fears!

My husband said it was the best shredded beef he has ever had.  I had to experiment a bit, as I did not have the exact ingredients.  I substituted the coffee with beer, cut down the jalapeño to one, used one can of stewed tomatoes instead of the mexican flavored tomatoes, with half a jar of salsa, and cooked it for 12 hours on low in the slow cooker and it turned out great!

Made as written and loved it. The meat is tender, juicy, and full of flavor. There is no coffee flavor at all. Thank you for the recipe.

This is absolutely delicious. We serve with pickled jalapenos, sour cream and cheese. I also printed a coupon to save on th sour cream at www.frugalharbor.com.

These were delicious and super easy! I left out the jalapenos because I didn't have any, and used regular crushed tomatoes, just because that is what I had — but I did have the green chiles and I used all the other spices. That made the flavor milder as a result, but I prefer mild over hot and spicy, so I thought they came out great. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was definitely a hit in our house!  After reading the other reviews, I did cut the liquid by draining the cans of tomatoes and reducing the beef broth to half.  There was still plenty of liquid, but once I blended everything with my immersion blender, it was a nice sauce, just a little runny.  Next time, I think I will skip the beef broth all together.  The only  change I made was that I substituted a can of rotel and a can of plain diced tomatoes for the Chili tomatoes called for in the recipe.  I didn't have those handy, so I used what I had and just added about an additional tablespoon of Chili powder.  I used the equivalent to about 1 sliced jalapeno and it had just the right amount of heat.  My husband loved the meat both on tacos and nachos.  Will definitely make again!
