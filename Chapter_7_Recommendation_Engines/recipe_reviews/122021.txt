I followed the recipe as written, but made a few different variations. I made a few as written, made a few into balls and rolled in granulated sugar before baking, added raspberry extract to some and put an indent in some and filled with raspberry jam. The cookies with the raspberry jam were our absolute favorite, followed closely by the raspberry extract -- next time I make them I will try some different variations, such as peanut butter chips, chocolate chips, mint extract.  This is an excellent versatile cookie! glad I made them today!

Oh my.  I can see already that Hubs is gonna eat himself sick on these (his gauge as to how good a cookie is) and my jeans will become just a little tighter.  I had a plan for these cookies from the get-go and they fit what I had in mind PERFECTLY.  I had leftover buttercream frosting from something else I made and since I had taken the time to tint it in a variety of colors I hated to just toss it (or mix it all together, add cocoa and make it chocolate frosting, a good "save" for this situation).  I wanted to make a sandwich cookie but I needed something soft so the frosting wouldn't just squish out.  I made the dough exactly as the recipe directed, then chilled it for an hour or so till somewhat firm.  Rolled it into  1"  balls, being very careful to make them all the same size. I flattened them just slightly and they baked perfectly at 8 minutes.  These are soft, buttery and chocolatey, exquisitely homey and old-fashioned good.  Great on their own, no doubt about it....but filling them with almond buttercream? There are just no words.  Excellent cookie, recipe perfect as written.

I thought these were great.  They are very cake-like and soft as the name states.  The batter looks like brownie mix and I was able to make the cookies just fine w/out rerigerating the batter first.  They can be dropped onto the pan and then you can flatten them with your hand.  The ones I made on my Silpat mat turned out perfect - came off easily & smooth bottoms.  The ones on the Silicone mat kind of stuck to it and when they came off they looked like torn cake on the bottom.  I'd recommend Silpat mat or perhaps a greased cookie sheet.

I folded in some Reese's peanut butter chips. My husband tells me that this is the cookie to make from now on. He says "These are like brownies, but cookies. They're officially the best cookies ever." He couldn't even wait for them to cool all the way before he started inhaling.

If there's any such thing as the perfect chocolate cookie, this is it. Tender texture, with just the tiniest bit of chewiness, if removed from the oven at 8 minutes. Vivid chocolate flavor. I turned them into Chocolate Peppermint Blossom Christmas cookies by baking only 8 minutes, cooling them 3 minutes, then pressing a Hershey's Candy Cane Kiss in the middle. Then, sprinkled lightly with powdered sugar. Be sure to wait the 3 minutes, because if you don't, the kisses will melt completely and form a pool, which is OK, but it won't have that little peak that give blossom cookies their traditional eye-appeal. This is because the Candy Cane Kiss version has a much lower melting point than chocolate Kisses. This recipe lends itself to many variations. Add chocolate chips for a double chocolate version. Toffee bits are another great ad-in. Add a depression in the middle and put in a dab of seedless raspberry jam, then drizzle with melted white chocolate. Let your imagination run wild. This recipe can be embellished as you like, or make it just as written - they're flawless with no changes whatsoever!. A wonderful recipe that you'll make over and over.

These were easy to make; I had all ingredients on hand.  Batter was pretty sticky, but I dropped by spoonfuls onto parchment paper-lined cookie sheet and they were fine.  Very soft cookie, almost cake-like.  Best to wait until they're completely cooled to eat them.

These cookies are incredible!  I followed the recipe exactly and then added the candy cane Hershey's kisses on top like peanut blossoms.  The only thing I would add would be to leave the cookies on the cookie sheet for about 5 minutes so they can set up before removing them to a cooling rack.  I will use this recipe often!

These are very good chocolate cookies. Because they are sticky, they hold their shape well. They also lend themselves well to lots of different additions. I have made them with butterscotch chips, peanutbutter chips and chocolate mint chips (my BF's favorite). They are also excellent with rasberry dark chocolate chips if you can find them.

Followed the recipe exactly... Some people told me they were too sugary. I found them very mediocre. If I were to make them again, I would add some type of chocolate chip to make it tastier... I can only give this a three. I really didn't think very highly of these.

Wow! My big mistake was making these unbelievably delicious cookies. Now I can't stop eating them. I followed the recipe exactly and used room temp eggs so they would be easier to mix. I would recommend waiting until they are completely cooled to try. I was impatient and tried one right away - a little like eating hot brownie mix. But, once they are cooled, they are chewy and fantastic! Did I mention fantastic!?!?

These were great cookies!  The dough was very sticky though, even after refrigerating for 2 hours so it was hard to make balls.  I added candy cane hershy kisses on the middle of the cookie (like a peanut butter blossom) and they were a big hit!

Very tasty and quick to put together.  I found my batter held up enough that I didn't need to refrigerate; instead of rolling into balls, I just treated it like a drop cookie.  
I also added a pinch of kosher salt to the top of each cookie before baking - the salt really brings out the flavor of the chocolate.  
Great recipe!

Great! Just like tiny brownies--I didn't use the confectioner's sugar. I also used baking powder instead because I like puffier cookies.

Excellent, chocolatey,cakey cookie.  I made mine Triple Chocolate though by adding a 1/2 cup chopped white chocolate and a 1/2 cup chopped milk chocolate.  DEE-LISH! I did cut out half the granulated sugar and replaced it with brown sugar though as I like to use a half and half of white/brown sugar in my cookies.  For those in Canada that are die-hard Timmy's fans, this is *almost* like their Triple Chocolate Chunk Cookie :D

I have made these a couple of times now.  The first time with peanut butter chips to give to our neighbors and they received rave reviews.  The second time I made them with dark chocolate and mint morsels for Christmas and they were awesome.  It is like a brownie cookie and has been probably the most popular cookie that I have made.

Made these on a whim last night and boy am I glad I did. I added three different kinds of chocolate chips and that only made this recipe better. I also had to substitute shortening for the butter as that was all I had on hand ... and I'm sure this helped make the cookies even better. I didn't bother setting a timer, I just watched them closely and removed from oven when small cracks started to appear on the tops of the cookies. I was also sure to only soften the shortening (not melt it) and use cold cookie trays for each batch. The dough did not flatten or spread while in the oven.

Finally, with some chocolate frosting, these cookies are tonic to a PMSing girl's soul.

Very, very good. They do taste like a cross between a cake brownie and a cookie. I would definitely make again.

These are A-A-A-A-AMAAAZING!  They're like the taste of brownies, but with the soft/crisp, easy handling of a cookie.  Oh man.  Dangerous cookies these little guys are!

I made exactly as the recipe indicated but added a half a bag of cherry chips (I wanted peanut butter chips but didn't have any) and they were FAN-TASTIC! This is a very versatile recipe that you could change or add things to and it will still be great! I used parchment paper and just dropped by spoonfuls and they came out perfect. This is one we'll put in the "keeper" file.

These cookies are so good!!!  I made them a little smaller, I think, than the recipe called for because I ended up with 27 cookies from only a half batch of dough.  They turned out beautifully though!  I would give them more stars if I could :)

These are good. I was too anxious to let them cool completely so when I would lift them off the pan, they kept breaking and therefore got to go straight to my tummy! I had 5 of them and would have eaten more but I am trying to eat healthy! It is so hard though because these are absolutely delicious. I used whole wheat flour to up the fiber content and organic cane sugar. I also used Belgium chocolate chips (at Bulk Barn) which I find actually melts in the cookie during the baking process unlike many of the name brand packaged baking chips that do not melt and keep their form during baking (for some reason I always find this strange and unnatural. Shouldn't chocolate melt when hot?). Anyhow, this is a wonderful recipe as it and I am sure without my healthy adjustments would have been a definate guilty pleasure. Maybe the only thing for me is that I found them a little salty, so I may only add 1/8 tsp salt instead. This recipe is great to modify to suit your cravings and I am sure this would even make an excellent base for a chocolate oatmeal cookie. I am tempted to try this now. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Finally, my chocolate fix is satisfied!  By far, the easiest and best recipe I've found for a cookie that stays soft!  I did add 1/2 bag milk chocolate chips and 1/2 tsp cinnamon to enhance that chocolatey flavor, and whoa!  I've gone through 3 batches in a week.  This could be a problem - for my diet.

Awesome cookies!! With a rich, chocolaty, brownie- like taste, these cookies are sure to please. I made these yesterday, adding 1 cup chocolate chips to the batter before chilling, and they turned out great. 1 inch balls make bite- size cookies, so I recommend making them bigger. They were exactly what I was looking for and I will definitely make this recipe again!

These are exactly as described - soft chocolate cookies. Not cakey though, if that's what you're looking for (I personally do not prefer a cakey cookie). I added a little more cocoa because I like a strong cocoa flavor (3/4 c. instead of 2/3) and added chocolate chips. Delicious. This will be my go-to chocolate cookie recipe and I'm glad I found it.

Holy Cow Wow this is one delicious cookie.
What I like about this cookie. 
Soft, not very sweet with a nice chocolate flavor. Like other reviewers said you can do so much with this cookie.(perfect the way they are) mint, toffee bits, peanut butter chips and on and on.
5 stars all the way

Perfect. Beautiful. Delicious.
No need to flatten. They are good with or without powdered sugar. Note: that if you sprinkle powdered sugar right out of the oven, it will melt and therefore have to re-sprinkle when they cool so they look nice. Wait a few minutes for them to cool a little, then apply sugar. Delicious!

These cookies are rather soft and cakey. I omitted the confectioner's sugar because the cookies are sweet enough by themselves. I experimented with blueberries, peanut butter and strawberry jam- they are all delicious but the best was the peanut butter. Make a dent in the cookie before baking and put a generous swirl of peanut butter in. You can also put cold creamy peanut butter on top afterwards.

Phenomenal!  The changes I made were adding only 1 whole egg and 1 egg yolk added 1 tbs fresh clementine juice and the zest of 2 clementines.  A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.  This recipe only yeilded 30 cookies for me.  They are soft and delicious.  My batter was not runny like some said.  It was firm and sticky.

A hit with the family.  Be sure not to over bake. I added chocolate chips and put in a tad bit less cocoa powder as they were a little too intensely chocolaty for our taste the first time I tried the recipe. Very easy and very good! They are a bit crumbly but who cares?

These are super good. A nice change of pace from the usual chocolate chip cookie. I baked one batch for 9 minutes, and the other for 8 minutes. The batch that I baked for 8 minutes came out perfectly moist and yummy. The 9 minute batch one came out a little drier and cake like. These are a lot like brownies in taste and texture. Love them. I did dust mine with powdered sugar, but it's totally unnecessary. They're perfect without it.

mmmmm good soft chocolate cookies.  we added chocolate chips too.  i did not chill the dough - didn't realize early on and then didn't have the time or patience to do it - and i think it does affect the end result - mine we flatter, although still soft..  i think chilling would yield a puffier cookie from rolling into balls, which you can't achieve by doing a drop cookie.  thanks!

These cookies are incredible, I could not wait until they got cool before I started gobbling them up.  They taste like a brownie, but in cookie form.  I will be making some more tonight because after I ate some my husband finshed the batch.

These were really soft and yummy. My mother loved them. She liked them because they were not to chocolaty. Next time I make these I will add white chocolate chips, I think that would go perfect.

These cookies were very yummy! Very easy to make! I greased the pan slightly and it really helped with taking them off! And I put a little bit less sugar! They are really nice rich cookies!

So I started making these forgetting that I didn't have any eggs.  So I used a banana.  Bam. Chocobanana cookies. Quite good.

Love these cookies!!! So very chocolatey. I doubled the batch, added chocolate chips, and sprinkled with a good amount of table sugar just to give it a different look. Everyone loved them!! I will be making these again.

So good, so easy and tasted like little brownie cookies.  I did not squish them down with a fork because I like a soft cookie and they were great.  Also had all ingredients on hand.  Thanks!

Thank you for an excellent recipe!!  I wouldn't change a thing.

These are great!! Reminds me of a thin brownie. I took some of mine and made them into ice cream sandwiches ( soften vanilla ice cream,put on one cookie then top with another, wrap them and freeze them. I will be keeping these cookies on hand. Thanks for sharing.

AMAZING! I added some semi-sweet chocolate chips to sweeten the deal, but I can tell the cookies would still be fabulous without them.

Well, I can't say I followed this exactly. I used 1/2C butter & 1/2C shortening. I didn't have the 2 sticks of butter on hand. Did 1C sugar & 1/4C brn sugar for a little depth. 1C AP flour & 1C whole wheat flour for some fiber. I did roll a smidge bigger then 1" balls and then lightly pressed on chopped walnuts so cookies were thick disc shapes. I did refrigerate dough overnight and put the dough back in the fridge during bake times. I found 10 minutes worked for me, any less and mine were undercooked. I left them on the baking sheet until cool and they removed easily. I did line my cookie sheet with parchment paper so that may have helped. Dough gets a bit sticky to handle if you let it come to room temp. I liked these but feel they need "something" to perk up the flavor - more salt probably since I used 1/2 shortening. Oh, I did have to splash a little milk in the dough as it was so stiff I got where I couldn't stir it, probably because I used 1/2 wheat flour. In the end, they were good and not sick sweet (didn't use any powdered sugar). Cookies were dense with a nice chewy texture. I'll add more salt due to using 1/2 Crisco next time and maybe more cocoa. Even with my modifications these turned out quite yummy.

A perfect chewy chocolate cookie.  I added semisweet chocolate chips to the batter and opted not to sprinkle powdered sugar on top once done.  I did not refrigerate the dough.  I did baked on parchment paper which yielded a perfectly puffed cookie.

OMG!  These cookies are so good.  I took the advice of the reviewers and had so much fun playing around with these cookies.  We split the dough in half and added peanut butter chips to half of the dough and made thumbprint cookies with the other half.  We put a half cherry in the center of some and strawberry preserves in the others.  They all turned out so good.  I don't know which variation was best.  They are all so good.

I am surprised by how much I love these cookies! I am usually not a big fan of chocolate cookies (I'd rather have a fudgy brownie!!) but gave these a shot with an idea I got from another reviewer... I had leftover peanut butter mousse and decided to use it as filling between two cookies... OUT OF THIS WORLD! I had to give them ALL away or I wouldn't have been able to stop eating them. Wonderfully moist yet still perfectly chewy... great chocolate flavor, which I kicked up a bit by adding some chopped chocolate to the batter. Wow. Incredible! (Oh, I should mention the cookies by themselves are tasty too!)

I'm very happy with these cookies.  I decided to make these when reviews stated "brownie like".  I upped the cocoa to 3/4 cup (very chocolatey) and included a cup or so of chopped walnuts.  Husband loved them, said they tasted like brownies.  Will definitely make again.

I had a hankering for Oreos but didn't want to go to the store to buy them.  I used this recipe (with the dough balls rolled in sugar and pressed on to the cookie sheet to bake) with some homemade buttercream frosting in the center and made my own homemade Oreos! Delicious recipe!

These are really good cookies! I was looking for something fast as my son was having a play date after school. I am trying to clean out my pantry as we are moving as well. I used part shortening for the butter about 1/3 c to finish it up, used brown sugar for the white, baking powder for the soda as I had Dutch processed cocoa not baking, I also added 1 tsp espresso powder. I chilled in the freezer for about 30 minutes, used my purple scoop and got 39 cookies, flattened with a glass dipped in sugar, 12 minutes on Silpat lined sheets was perfect. Slightly crunchy edges with a soft, cakey center, would definitely be great for whoopie pies.

Very good recipe!!  These cookies have a soft "brownie like" texture.  I followed the recipe as stated and did no adjustments.  The only difference for me was a greased lined cookie sheet and I sprinkled a bit of granulated sugar on top of each ball prior to pressing so the fork would not stick.  The only reason I did not give this recipe 5 stars was because the cookie dough even after refridgeration was a bit messy to work with.  All in all, the results were definitley worth it!!  Thanks for sharing!!

Excellent recipe. Perfect with no alterations, but very nice with one tsp vanilla and one tsp peppermint extract. The texture is excellent! To those of you having trouble with flat cookies, make sure you are:
1. Creaming butter and sugar well. This should take 5 min in a standing mixer, and your butter should be soft, but not melty. 
2. Chilling your dough well. This dough is pretty easy to handle so it's tempting to skip, but cold dough will retain height better in the oven.  
Try it again! These cookies are fantastic!

I love this recipe!! I followed the recipe except for rolling the cookies into balls, I used an icecream scooper to drop the cookies onto the baker's stone. It worked very well. The cookies are sooo soft and chocolately. :) My friend loves this recipe and is always asking me to make it. Again, LOVE IT!!!! :)

These are the perfect chocolate cake textured cookies. They are light, chocolatey, and moist. This is my go to chocolate cookie recipe now, definately give these a try. I put crushed potato chips in some and those were delicious as well.

These were just ok to me. I felt like they were missing something so the last couple of batches I sprinkled in some Andes mints & some on top. Those tasted just like Girl Scouts Thin Mints...YUM!

The name said it all, great recipe.  I wasn't able to roll my dough in balls, too sticky and soft, it just melted in my hands and I left it in the fridge for an 1 hour and 15 minutes.  I end up spoon dropping them still had a great shape.  This is my go-to chocolate cookie recipe from now on.

I was unfortunately unimpressed with these cookies. They left the taste of baking soda in my mouth, rather than chocolate. I will not be making them again.

These cookies are delicious, and I know cookies! I'm 25 and I make better cookies than grandmas with this recipe. I add chocolate chips and sometimes walnuts..The cocoa can also be excluded for a delicious regular chocolate chip cookie. Or you can do what I do and add the cocoa later on so you can have half regular choc chip and half double chocolate...mmm

Pretty darn good.  Added chocolate chips.  Try using dark coco instead of regular.  Also used White Whole Wheat instead of regular flour.  GREAT!

Delicious! Just made half a batch for family movie night. The kids love them. And amazingly they aren't overly sweet. Tastes great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This is a VERY good cookie, but it's important that one uses quality ingredients.  It really needs to have real butter. I like salted, even though most recipes for baking call for unsalted. I would also highly recommend a high quality cocoa powder.  Bernard Callebaut is very good. I used a container of higher quality cocoa powder from Costco. These would be good with fun mix-ins like peanut butter chips, toffee, or maybe even a hit of coffee!  YUM!

Excellent Cookie Recipe!! I did make a few small changes...I used sugar in the raw and unbleached flour. I made the cookies large, so I could make icecream sandwiches. My family loved them!! Thanks for sharing!

Very nice!  I rolled them into 1 inch balls, dipped one side in mini m&m's, placed them candy side up and flattened them with the bottom of a drinking glass.  I also used mini chocolate chips on some and left a few plain.  These are beautiful and soft cookies that would be good to make sandwich cookies with (or icecream sandwiches).

These cookies were good, similar to two bite brownies.  I did expect them to be a bit moister.  Next time I will cook a minute or two less and be sure to cool on racks.

I've made this recipe multiple times and they have always come out perfectly! They taste like little brownies. I always top them with powdered sugar to balance the rich chocolate taste. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were one of the best chocolate cookies I have ever tasted.  Growing up, we had a bakery close to us that had the best chocolate butter cookies.  I have tried to find a perfect recipe to duplicate them and I finally found it here.  The dough is easy to work with and it produces a wonderful tasting cookie.   A+ all the way!

Made these for a Christmas cookie exchange and they were amazing! Instead of confectioners sugar, I topped each one with an unwrapped andes mint immediately after pulling them out of the oven, and after 5 minutes I smeared the melted chocolate over the top of the cookie, swirling the white mint part. DELICIOUS.

Perfect chocolate cookie recipe as is.  Quick, easy, uses cocoa powder so it's pantry friendly and economical. I've added lots of things to the batter with success: chocolate chips, coconut, raisins, nuts,marshmallows, etc.  My favorite substitution is brandy for the vanilla.  Really bumps the chocolate up a bit.

This is a great recipe.  These cookies are addicting.  I added 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips to the batter.  Once baked, I had a nice warm, gooey combination of chocolate and butterscotch.  Just wonderful!

I made the cookie base as written then added shredded coconut, ghiradelli white chocolate chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips. Made a double batch for the holidays which made a lot of cookies but it was a good thing as these were really great cookies! The base of this is very good and very versatle. I am going to try to make them with various additions in the future but the coconut and chips were a great combo! Like a chewy brownie cookie!

Very tasty! Easy, and everyone loved them. I added some mini chocolate chips to the mix before refrigerating it, then baked them about 4 minutes longer then recommended because I made them a little bigger than it says too. They were very rich, and tasted like brownies. Lots of flavor but you'll need some milk to drink with these because they are VERY rich. lol.

Good, just not the best chocolate cookies ever.  Even after time in the fridge, these were still really sticky to roll.  I started dusting my hands with flour, and that did the trick.  Baked 10 minutes...just be careful not to over bake!  Unfortunately, I know this from experience.  Oops, just realized I forgot to dust with powdered sugar...too late for that now, as they are all gone!

Delicious and easy to make! I didn't have time to refrigerate these before baking. To make it easier to work with the dough, I used a small cookie scoop and simply dipped a fork in water before using it to make indents on the cookies. Results were great!

Very good cookie and easy to work with.  I made them exactly as recipe stated.  It's a soft cookie, which my kids love.  After I chilled the dough a bit, I put it in my cookie press in a snowflake pattern and sprinkled with powdered sugar.  They were beautiful!
I will add that they are really better on the second day.

Pretty good.  My kids loved them.  They aren't super sweet, so if you want something less sugary these are for you.

I brought these to my family's Thanksgiving and they were a hit.  This is a BIG deal... my brother is famous for his chocolate chip cookies and these went before his!  Oh, I added dark chocolate morsels (not semi sweet).

Made exactly as written. Did not sprinkle the confectioners' sugar on the cookies but did add mini chocolate chips to the batter. They are delicious. They taste like brownie cookies. Yum. Definitely a keeper!

I love them! Everyone loves them! They are simply, fast and extremly delicious! There were weeks when I've baked them every day! I made just one little modification : I add just one cup of sugar, and as for me it's enough. Very tasty and very chocolate!

Very good!  I was expecting more of a cake like cookie, (fluffy texture) and got more of a brownie like texture (chewy).  But, I was pleasantly surprised!

In the middle of making this I realized I only had about 1/4cup of butter.  Thankfully, I had a bit of apple butter in the fridge to make up for it!  These lived up to their title. Just like a soft chewy brownie inside, even after cooling.  This recipe along with another choc. chip oatmeal recipe I found will be given out as xmas gifts this year!  Makes exactly 33 as shown.  Thank You for the amazing recipe!

Easy recipe and the cookies had a nice soft texture, but they weren't very chocolate-y.  Maybe they need more cocoa?  Regardless, I've made better and won't be saving this recipe.

Let me just say WOW!!  I can't have dairy, so satisfying my choco-holic addiction has been a challenge.  But this totally did it!  I just made 1/2 batch to test out the recipe, and now I am bummed that I didn't make more ('cause 1/2 of these are gone and they're still warm).  I used Earth Balance spread instead of butter, and I just can't bring myself to use margerine or shortening because of the trans fats and other bad stuff...  So to all of you who can't have dairy, you have to try these!!!  YUMMY!!!  Will make these again... probably tomorrow :)

Used Earth Balance original (margarine) instead of butter and applesauce instead of the egg.  You absolutely DO NOT need to refrigerate the dough or shape it into balls; just make it like a drop cookies.  Delicious right out of the oven.  HOWEVER, after they cool, they are WAY too sweet.  Like, inedibly sweet.

Excellent! I made them with swirled hersey kisses on top. cooked 8 minutes and then waited a minute after removing from the oven to put on the kisses. 
Very soft, and tasty. 
I make cookies for  my sons football team every game. ( Over 50 players)
This was one of their favorites.
I llok foward to trying them another way,  but then as my husband would say " don't fix what isn't broken "

These were very good cookies and were sort of a cross between a cookie and a brownie.  I made half of them into sandwich cookies with vanilla buttercream in the middle.  The other half I put a chocolate glaze with sprinkles on.  My kids loved both kinds, but were partial to the sandwich ones, which these cookies were perfect for.  With just using my cookie scoop, these turned out uniform and perfectly round.  Chocolate chips would also be a great addition to these cookies.

These are quite tasty.  Soft and chocolatly.  I doubled the chocolate and added 1 tsp. of instant coffee.  I also sifted in the flour (1/2 whole wheat) and cocoa.  I  had a hankering for chocolate cookies and I was eating these about half an hour later.  Thanks for the recipe;)

Alright, where's the option to give 10 stars?! These cookies are to die for - especially the next day! I made the first two dozen as per the recipe then proceeded to add walnuts to the next pan and chocolate chips to the last pan, they are all SO good! I always make my cookies on the small side, and so I got 55 cookies from this recipe.

Sooo good! Cakey, yes.  But also CHEWY.  I baked exactly 9 minutes and flattened the balls a bit before putting in the oven.  Taste like a brownie by itself, and very versitile.  You could add pretty much anything to this cookie.  Thanks so much for sharing!

Soft and delicious. I tried 3 variations within my batch. I added a tbsp of espresso powder and topped with a coffee bean to 1/3 of the dough, added 1 1/4 cup of chocolate chips to a 1/3 of the dough and went with the original recipe with the last 1/3 of the dough. All 3 kinds were fantastic. Great recipe to keep as is or play around with.

I used butter and baked the cookies for exactly 8 minutes because I was afraid they would be overbaked and dry.  They came out perfectly. Stored them in a plastic container and 2 days later they are still soft and moist.  My family loves them.  My husband made sure I saved this recipe because he is expecting me to make them again. The cookie is delicious on its own, dusted with a little powdered sugar, but I may try adding some peanut butter or white chocolate chips next time.

As I'm sure the original recipe is superb, I did a variation. My husband likes dark chocolate so I substituted Dark Cocoa. I upped the sugar to 2 cups and used Almond Extract along with the vanilla. I think next time I might try a mint extract or throw in some chocolate chips. They are a very soft and easy cookie and can easily be made in a variety of ways.

Made these exactly as directed, right down to the powdered sugar. They were excellent--soft and chewy just like I hoped they would be. Thanks for the recipe, Beth!

Soft in deed, almost to soft. I let them fully cool before placing in my cookie jar, and they fell apart in the jar over night.

very very very nice recipe.  I used margarine in mine (1/2 batch) and didn't chill the batter.  Next time might only bake for about 8 minutes to get an even more brownie-like consistency :)

I made this recipe exactly as is, however I failed to read the "refrigerate for 1 hour or until dough is easy to handle."  I use a scoop and just scooped the fresh dough onto parchment lined cookie sheets, and they turned out just fine.  They taste excellent!

Sooo good! I am rarely successful when making chocolate cookies, but these were fantastic and not hard at all! I added chocolate chips to mine, and it made them to die for! Also, make sure you take them out while they're still soft so that they stay chewy and fresh-tasting.

I've been looking for something soft and chocolatey to send my boyfriend in Seattle, but since I am in California, it has to go through the mail.  What may be soft after it cools might be slightly hard when it reaches him, even if I put bread in the box to keep the cookies from going stale!  No more!  This is a wonderfully delicious recipe that arrives soft and safe at his doorstep!  Thanks!  The only thing I changed about this recipe was adding 1/2 tsp of baking POWDER so that the cookies would rise some.  AWESOMe and YUMMY!

I actually used 1/2 cup of butter and a 1/2 cup of Crisco and I really loved the combo of butter and shortening.  Really tasted close to an Oreo.  Next time I want to make a white butter cream fosting and make sandwhich cookies out of them!  Loved this recipe!

It is a little short on sweet. I had to add an extra handful of sugar and the dough tasted a bit better.  When I took them out of the oven they still didn't taste sweet. I had to put a mountain full of confectioner sugar on it then it tasted fine. I am just stating the worst, overall great cookie, great texture and color. I will make it again.

I was looking for a new base recipe for my annual double chocolate peppermint cookies, and I've found it! These were so moist and fluffy--not usually my favorite cookie texture, but very welcomed for this. I substituted half the butter with apple sauce and left out a half cup of sugar, then folded in a cup of chocolate chips and a cup of crushed peppermint candies. The result was completely addictive! Four stars just because I really do prefer a less cakey cookie, but they really were a hit. I dare you to eat just one!

These cookies were good and chocolate-y. They were soft, too, which I like my cookies to be. They were even better when I added some semi-sweet chocolate chips to the dough.  Super yummy!

These were great! It was a rainy afternoon and I wanted something chocolatey. I had no chocolate chips, but some unsweetened cocoa and this is the perfect plain chocolate cookie. HOWEVER, def more brownie like than cake like or cookie like. Still fantastic!!! Very moist in the center yummm.  ONE THING: 1/4 tsp less salt.

Not bad at all...my daughters loved them! I thought the batter was more of the consistancy of brownie mix and it wasn't rollable in an hr...but I  just dropped them on the cookie sheet and went. Baked 3 dozen with this recipe. I didn't dust with confectioners sugar since we just moved here and I havent found my sieve but they were yummy and cake-like...almost like an oreo cakester!

very hard to handle the dough - I had to freeze it for over 2 hours and it still was a pain to roll into balls. I had to drop the dough with tablespoons. Also, they are too soft and too moist.  I wouldn't make these again, but my sister really loves the softness/moistness of the cookie.

Fantastic! I made them with 1 and 1/3 cup agave nectar instead of sugar, and 2.5 cups flour (half of it wheat flour half white). They rose nicely, didn't stick to the baking sheet, and tasted like brownies, but light!

I added one 10 ounce bag of Andes Creme De Menthe baking chips and got 52 delicious cookies.  This is an easy, foundation cookie recipe to add different types of chips...I will try peanut butter pieces next.  I was anticipating cake-like cookies from the reviews, but my cookies were more flat.

I couldn’t stop eating them! -- I was looking for a quick chocolate cookie recipe to make last night that was different than my husband’s favorite standby, which is Nestle Tollhouse Chocolate Chip Cookies.  These fit the bill perfectly.  I softened my cold butter in the microwave for a bit on a low power (I didn’t want super soft butter) before mixing the ingredients in my stand mixer.  I added ½ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and ½ cup white chips to the batter.  I skipped chilling the dough (in a hurry to eat ‘em!) and skipped the confectioners’ sugar (forgot) and went right to baking.  I used my #50 cookie scoop, 1-1/2”, and flattened cookies slightly with my fingers before baking.  I baked on my air bake cookie sheet lined with a silicone-baking mat for 10 minutes. I pulled the cookies out of the oven when they looked just slightly under baked, cooled for a couple minutes on the cookie sheet and transferred to cooling racks. The recipe made about 2-1/2 dozen this way.  The cookies turned out amazing.  They were just ever so slightly crisp on the edges and nice and soft and chewy in the middle.  These were great right out of the oven! I think the addition of the chocolate chips were what made these cookies even better.  I didn’t notice any greasiness as some people mentioned. These cookies aren’t just for kids. I would recommend these cookies for any type of event!

My youngest daughter and I were making Christmas cookies and decided to give this one a try.  It was a hit with the entire family.  Very good and very cake-like.

Very good and easy-to-make chocolate cookie recipe. Not too greasy like some others I have tried... and has a nice soft texture, just like it says.  I was careful not to over-soften the butter and didn't have to refrigerate the batter at all. I did use a cookie scoop and got about 40 cookies out of the recipe. I added peanut butter chips to part of the batter, the rest I made just plain and it was equally as good. Would definitely recommend this as a good basic chocolate cookie recipe- esp. for someone with little baking experience, as it was so easy.

Great recipe didn't change a thing!  8 minutes in my convection oven was perfect.  Soft and chewy, this recipe is a keeper!

Fabulous. I tried several simliar recipes for chocolate cookies on this site and this one is by far the best. Love the flavor and texture. I prefer to roll the entire ball of dough in confectioner's sugar before baking though, rather than dusting on afterwards. Also, we tried them with finely chopped mint chips in the dough and they were so good!

WONDERFUL cookies.  I had everything on hand, melted the butter completely because I didn't feel like getting my stand mixer out, but that was the only difference- okay that and the fact that I only made 18 cookies.  I just dropped them onto a greased cookie sheet and baked for about 14 minutes in a 325 degree oven.  Oh my goodness-- cakey, chocolatey, AMAZING.

These were soooo good but soooo rich and filling.  I added a chocolate rosette to the center of each.  They were a hit for sure.  My step-grandmother said I could make money off of them!

I have made these twice. The first time as written and they were great. The second time I added white chocolate chips and dropped them by rounded teaspoons rather than rolling as the dough is very sticky! I baked on parchment paper. Very good!

My cookies were not 'soft' (as in chewy) but did not have a 'crunch' either. I topped them with powedered sugar as suggested and they disappeared!!! I'm not really into chocolate cookies, but these were fantastic!!! My boys devoured them!! I used a teaspoon cookie scoop (they were a bit sticky even after refrigeration) to drop them on the sheet. They spread out into a nice circle about 2 & 1/2" across.  I will definately make these again.....soon!!!

These chocolate cookies are fabulous!  If you are looking for a recipe that bakes soft, thick, cookies that do not fall flat, you must try these!  Also, for a fun minty-chocolate cookie, I added a bag of Andes baking chips and they are to DIE FOR!!  These cookies do not last long in our house!  I use a 50-50 mixture of Splenda and sugar for my diabetic husband and you can't even tell!

Absolutely excellent!  I halved the recipe and added about 1/4 cup of walnuts, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  They are soft, plenty chocolaty, and yet a rich buttery taste also comes through.

These were SO yummy! And for as long as they were around the house, they were still soft. I did add a cup of white and milk chocolate chocolate chips which turned out to be a great addition.

DELICIOUS... moist, chewy, chocolately but not too chocolately.  Great with a cold glass of milk.  Followed recipe exactly, very easy, and they came out perfect.  Thanks for sharing.  I'm sure these will become a family favorite.

typing one handed because I do not want to stop eating these soft, chocolatey,perfect cookies. I have to make double batches so I can get a few. They disappear quick. This is a good cookie for whoopee pies or sandwich cookies because of the soft yet hardy texture.

July 19, 2012: I love the buttery and chocolatey taste! Baked it for 9 minutes and it had a nice chew to it which we liked.  I topped a few cookies with chocolate covered sunflower seeds to them and thought it gave it a nice colorful and festive touch. Update: I tasted it again at night and it totally lost it's flavor...???...usually some cookies
are best aged hmmm. But it could've been someone who left the container open.

oh dear...I've already eaten 6 of them and I haven't even baked half of them yet.  thanks for the recipe.  they're very easy to make.  I substituted the butter for a vegan/soy free buttery spread (Earth Balance) due to allergies and they turned out great!  Now if I can only get thru baking the rest without eating any more this evening!!

These were actually really good.  Only thing I would add is chocolate chips or walnuts.  I had neither so it worked out this time.  So, I will use them next time.  Also, if you want a good size cookie you will not get 33 cookies out of them.  You will get about 26 ish.

These are some of the best cookies I have ever made. I make these all the time - in fact, I have a batch in the oven. I bring this in to school a lot and people love them! They're very soft, so they crumble easily and stick to one another, so keep that in mind when transporting. Also, make sure they're mostly cool when sprinkling the powdered sugar - it looks so much better!

These are super delicious and a family Favorite. I have made these twice so far. The first time they were amazing the second my blender broke down on before I added the baking soda and salt and came out a little salty on some cookies but the rest were good I think it was my fault not mixing it well enough. If you are questioning to use this recipes definitely use it but you need a blender.

I made these delicious cookies a few days ago and they are already gone! My family loved them! I didn't have quite as much cocoa as the recipe calls for so I just dumped in what I had, and it was plenty. I also added chocolate chips for extra panache. 8-10 minutes was just a tad too short baking time though (at least with my oven), so I left them in about 10-12 minutes or so, and the cookies ended up soft, chocolatey and delicious! I will definately make these again!

These were okay - I seem to have a problem with cookies falling flat no matter what I do and this was no exception.  Easy to play with - some i made exactly as directed; others, I added coconut to, some with mini-m&m candies, some with toffee chips - all were nice.  Nothing knock your socks off, but a good staple to have for when the grandkids come knocking.

OK, I followed everything exactly, and read all the reviews that said these were great. NOT SO MUCH  I chilled the dough, followed instructions exactly and these had no flavor at all. I didn't even finish baking them. I'm in search of a new chocolate cookie.  Don't waste your time with this, they aren't worth it

Since these cookies are so soft, they're perfect for making cookie sandwiches.  I used Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting from allrecipes to make chocolate and peanut butter cookie sandwiches.  Tasted great together!

This is a very good recipe! The cookies are brownie like and stay soft. I use unsalted butter, whole wheat flour, and bittersweet chocolate chips. If you don't refrigerate the dough, they flatten out so be sure to do that. Very tasty!

I thought these cookies sounded yummy and easy enough for me (a fair-weather baker), but mine came out completely flat.  I didn't change anything in the recipe, and they had a good taste, but were just very thin--not what I thought they'd be.  Oh, and I wanted to roll them in the powdered sugar, but the batter was far, far too sticky so I stuck with sprinkles.  A little disappointed, but I know it could be because I'm such a beginner too . . .

Throw in some milk chocolate chips and these are wonderful!! Didn't leave in the batter the fridge for an hour and just worked with them after mixing. Baked mine at 375F (190C) for same amount of time and it was perfect.

5 stars definitely...super easy to make and tastes great. I never let the dough sit in the fridge and it was still really easy to handle and form so I don't think you need to do that step. I did a few with mint extract and those were good too. Next time (when I have ice cream) I am going to make ice cream sandwiches with them...so good :) Will make again.

I want to give these cookies a full five stars but mine didn't come out quite right.

There was no way I was going to eat 33 cookies by my lonesome so I used this website's calculator to scale the recipe for 16 cookies. Following that recipe exactly, my cookie dough turned into brownie batter. Way too soft and liquidy for even refrigeration to make firm. I had to keep adding sugar and flour a table spoon at a time to make the dough stiffer and it took about five until I could work with it. Plus, I had too grease my baking sheet because the cookies were sticking. 

But, even though I had to alter and adjust, the end product came out fantastic! The cookies were like circular brownies and tasted WONDERFUL! But I can't tell if this is how they would have come out with a perfect recipe or as a product of my fixes.

U seldom see a recipe w/ 5 stars and this one deserves it! Followed everything except the dusting of powdered sugar on top and they were amazing. Might add walnuts next time? 8 mins @350 was perfect. This recipe yielded 38 cookies for me. Thx for sharing!

Yum yum! I found these and they turned out to be exactly what I needed because I couldn't decide what I wanted to make - between cupcakes, brownies, or cookies....these are the perfect combination of all three. Soft like cupcakes or cake brownies, but in cookie form! The batter is more like a moose instead of dough which makes them hard to "roll" into balls, but spooning them out on a cookie tray works just as well.

These cookies are ridiculously easy to make - I did not chill them before baking, I just tried to handle them as little as possible.  Super soft and the family chowed down right away! Lots of variations from adding an extract to topping with candies/chocolates and all are super tasty!

I made these cookies to take to my weekly volleyball group. Eveyone there raved about them. I added walnuts and a dash of cinnamon to the recipe. I thought that they were perfect with the little bit of extra flavor the cinnamon gave it. I will definately be making these again.

I'm kind of scratching my head with this one. I haven't had a single recipe I tried on here not turn out tasting excellent, but this one is, sadly, not one I'm planning on making again. I totally get that this is a quasi-brownie/cake cookie, but I found it to be very bland. I followed the recipe perfectly and was looking forward to making a treat for my husband. I'm disappointed that this didn't turn out at all like I wanted to... I'm still scratching my head over it, especially since it got so many excellent reviews.

Made one batch and then turned around and made a second batch right away.  They turned out great.  I didn't refrigerate the cookie dough...they turned out great any how.  My family just loves these cookies.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Beth!  : )

WOW! If you can get these into the oven without eating the cookie dough, I applaud you! These are fantastic. Baked them exactly 8 minutes. They were soft, chewy, and very fudge-y. Perfection.

I follow the recipe to a T but also add 1 cup of chocolate chips. The cookies are soft and chewy--almost like brownies, and are a great chocolate cookie option for people who don't like the typical vanilla/nutty/spicy sweet holiday flavors.  Everybody LOVES these.

I made these with added chocolate chips to the batter.  I flattened them after rolling into balls. I made a thumbprint impression in the top of each and added seedless raspberry jam before baking.  They were soft and yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

perfect! I made these for xmas gift and wanted to "jazz them up" ( not that they needed to be ) but I added oreo crumbles and milk chocolate chips. I kepts the balls of dogh no bigger than and inch and i was able to get a good amount of cookies at a good size. They spread a little but will not flatten ou! I flattened then out a little once i took them out to make them look bigger, and were perfect! They have been a big hit, and 
I will make again!

YUM!!!
First attempt was a huge success! We bought some seasonal miniature non-pareils called "Smoothe & Melty" and I searched for a chocolate cookie recipe to be the perfect base and oh man, this fit the bill perfectly! 
Simple and delicious. Can't wait to make other variations!

As all the reviews have already said, "THIS IS THE BEST CHOCOLATE COOKIE EVER!!"  I've never had a more perfectly delicious chocolate cookie before. I followed the recipe exactly and with half the batch mixed in Andes Creme de Menthe chips. Some I patted down the dough and added a bunch of Andes mint chips on top. They turned out AMAZING!!!!  Can't wait to make these again with peanut butter chips!!  THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!!!

really hard to roll into balls...came out good tho! I got really confused for a minute because I didn't know which sugar to pour into and ultimately forgot the powdered sugar at the end, but it was still good :)

These cookies were great! I flattened them a bit and took them out a hair early as I prefer a denser, moist cookie to the more cake-like variation. They are nice and chocolaty--I made them plain and they were delicious but I'm sure they would make a phenomena base for nuts, chips, flavorings and/or jam. This now will be my go-to chocolate cookie recipe!

AMAZING! Very cake like. I also added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips & 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts. The chips are a nice rich surprise every now and then & the walnuts balance out the chocolate. They did stick to the pan a bit so I sprayed it w/Pam.

Beautiful soft cookies, for ease I just roll it into a tube shape, and after refrigerating until firm, I slice and bake.  I've mixed it with crushed candy canes, toffee bits and chocolate chips. Very versatile, and easy! Thanks for helping with this years baking!

These are easy and really good. I rolled them in powdered sugar before baking instead of after. I found a fine line between under and over baking them. They are more like little cakes than cookies...would be good for whoopie pies!

Absolutely delicious!  I added some Andes chocolate mint chips, and everybody loves them!  I found I didn't have to wait for the dough to chill.  I greased the cookie sheet, and made 1/2 inch balls, patted them gently.  This recipe will be a staple during the Holidays for years to come!  Thank you for posting.

Everyone in the house were flocking in the kitchen lke vultures when I made these last night. I made them for the second night in a row, and actually rolled them into balls this time. Instead of 33, the recipe made 46 cookies, without altering the recipe. It could have easily made 50 if i hadn't made some of them larger than the rest. My mother said they taste like those two-bite brownies that you can get at our local grocery store or at KFC, and she's right! I'm definitely making these again for christmas. I think buttercream frosting with peppermint extract instead of vanilla  would be great, and also mixing candycane bits in, then icing the top, or even making little sandwiches would be great!

These cookies are wonderful.  I have been trying to find the perfect chocolate cookie and this is it!  We have made them several times.  Our favorite is to add mini marshmallows, chocolate chips and pecans or walnuts..I would call it Rocky Road??

after shopping for my thanksgiving dinner, i found that i had extra ingredients that i had no room to store, so i got online and looked for a cookie recipe.  i happened upon this recipe quickly and decided i would try it.  the first batch just came out of the oven.  i have to say they are delicious!  i did not chill them, just spooned then onto a sprayed pan- just in case - and popped them into the oven for 8 minutes.  i believe my children will be eager to share them with their friends today!  i'm glad i found this recipe!!!!  now, if i had some frosting to plop onto them, i believe i might be in heaven.  oh, the timer is going off for the second batch....  more yummy cookies     ~ : )

Excellent taste. I was low on butter  so I switched out 1/2 cup of the butter for the equal amount of Peanut Butter. I used Creamy but chumky would work just as well. I whipped this out in no timea and the girlfriend loves it

Yummy cookies!  For half of the cookies, I rolled them in granulated sugar and stuck a dark chocolate chip in the middle.  Very good and very easy to make!

I made these chocolate cookies into "Cappuccino" cookies by adding some instant coffee to the creamed butter and sugar mix. I also went ahead with my usual replacement of halving the butter and replacing with apple sauce to reduce fat. Works beautifully and what a tasty and versatile recipe this is. I baked on ungreased cookie sheets as indicated and they turned out perfect. Great recipe, I will be making these often, enjoying a different twist each time.

Delicious!  They taste like brownie bites.  I added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips to the batter.  I had a hard time rolling them into ball, so make sure you let them cool at least an hour in the fridge.  I made sandwich cookies out of some with vanilla buttercream frosting.

Oh man....so good!  I used 1 cup spelt flour and 1 cup whole wheat and I had to force myself to quit eating the dough.  I also added about a 1/2 c. chocolate chips.  I rolled them in sugar before baking.  I plan to make a peanut butter filling by whipping 3/4 c. creamy PB and 1/4 c. powdered sugar to make sandwich cookies.  Yum!!!!

I can see why these cookies are on the top 20 list on this site. I made them excatly as the recipe calls for and they were DELICIOUS. My kids' eyes were the size of quaters when they tried them. These cookies are definitely one of my favorites and I'm sure I will be making them more many times!

Cookies came out just as described following recipe exactly! I like to smush cookies down some w/wooden spoon straight out of oven. When they cool they seem to hold together better and the cookie is a little less cakey, just the way I like it! I whipped up some buttercream and made sandwich cookies. They were a big it! I will keep this easy recipe on hand. ;-)

I've never made chocolate cookies before so when my friend requested them I had to find a good recipe. Found it! I only made half of what the recipe required because chocolate is a rich dessert that you don't need a whole lot of and I was right. I tried one and it satisfied my chocolate craving with just that one. I also use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour along with natural ingredients so I feel a bit better about the nutritional value of the cookies. I'm going to try to remake this recipe with honey next time and see how that turns out. Thank you for the yummy recipe! :)

I just made these cookies and they turned out perfect.  I really like the texture.  They didn't go flat which sometimes happens to my cookies.  I am sure they will be the new family favorite.  I am looking for a chocolate chip cookie recipe with this same texture if anyone has one.

These cookies are SO good. Last night I was craving chocolate and decided to try the recipe instead of going to the store. I am fairly new to cooking for myself and when my parents came home they were amazed that I cooked and how well the cookies came out. Now I am waiting for a new batch to finish cooking since the cookie monster (my parents) ate the rest when I went to hang out with my friends. Hopefully they come out as well as the first time. =)

Really great cookie recipe and I can't emphasize that enough!!  I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp peppermint extract but that's my only change.
General comment - I'm BEGGING those posting recipes to define 'Prep Time' as the time needed from absolute start to the time the recipe goes into the oven.  Please, Please include any refrigeration time in the posted prep time.  Thanks.

I made these last night, and I have officially deemed them as the best cookies that have ever graced this mouth.  My husband and I LOVED them...so much that I told him to take the majority of them to work so they wouldn't be within my grasp.  
These cookies are moist, slightly chewy, slightly cakey, and the perfect amount of chocolatey richness.  
I used dark chocolate cocoa and added white chocolate chips to the recipe.  Also, I used 1 cup of white wheat flour and 1 cup of unbleached all purpose flour instead of 2 cups of all purpose flour.  The cookies turned out exquisitely.  Love 'em...they melt in your mouth!  Thank you for this recipe!

Good basic recipe.  Very light and cakey.  There is a lot you could do with this to really jazz it up!

Very chewy and cake-like cookies!  Very yummy!  Only tweak I made was to add white chocolate chips.  Great, easy cookie recipe!  Thank you!

Followed another users suggestion to bake for 8 minutes to get the softest results.  And did have to flatten a little.  CAME OUT PERFECT!! Thanks...didn't last the night.

We just love these! I make these with my two small children and we like to add lots of things, like white chocolate,chocolate chips,nuts,and m&ms. we even use them to make cookie sandwiches with peanut butter or whipped cream! this is a great starter recipe because you can eat them as is or add so many things to them! These are so soft and fluffy! wonderful recipe!

I made these and used a silicone mat on my baking sheet. They came out perfect. I’ve made them many times, the last time I was a little short on the cocoa so I used some chocolate syrup ice cream topping. My husband said that made them even better! Super soft fudgey centers and crunchy m and m’s. Great recipe!

I was expecting nice soft fluffy cookies but all I got was hard flat gingersnap like cookies. I made half a batch and added a little more chocolate because another person mentioned they did since it needed it. The flavor is good but I was really disappointed in softness. I'll probably try again another time and make them bigger balls and less cook time. (I think I cooked them roughly 10-15 mins? Any less and they just inflated to the touch...)

These cookies are exceptional! I folded semi-sweet chocolate chips into the mix for a little extra meltiness in the middle and we loved them. They're like tiny cakes.

Just finished these, they are very good! Very cake-like and chocolatey indeed. 
I only give 4 stars because as good as they are, they just seem like something is "missing", can't put my finger on it. I imagine you could add just about anything to them though and they would be GREAT. :)

Terrific basic recipe! For a chunkier-looking, more textured (but still soft!) cookie, I adapted as shown below.  One batch, I added toasted natural coconut & pecans with 60% choc chips, another I added peanuts and peanut butter chips.  Fabulous and not too sweet!

1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. shortening (vs. 1 c. butter)
1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/2 c. organic cane sugar (vs. 1 1/2 c. white sugar)
1 1/2 c. AP flour and 1/2 c. white whole wheat flour
 (vs. 2 c. AP flour)
1/2 tsp. cream of tartar (gives dough more body, and increased surface texture after baking)

No need to refrigerate, just scoop out onto parchment and flatten tops slightly with your hand before baking.

Mmm, soft brownie cookies.  Was going to sandwich two together with something but they're too good on their own.  I even skipped the powdered sugar.

Excellent cookies! These are soft, chewy, and perfectly chocolatey. I wanted something other than just plain chocolate, so I threw some Andes Candies pieces into the dough, and then sprinkled additional pieces on each dough ball before I baked them. They came out absolutely wonderful this way...these cookies were a big hit with my family and friends! The only problem I had with them is that they came out rather flat, not like some of the other people's came out from looking at the pictures. I may add just a little extra flour next time I make these to make them puff up a bit more. But the taste and texture is great, so I'll be making these again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

Holy chocolate awesomeness!  These are almost like what I use for Crinkle Cookies (roll ball in confectioner's sugar before baking). Very rich chocolate taste --- I'm using them for ice cream sandwiches :)

excellent chocolate cookies! i was looking for cookies without chips (didn't have any!) and this was it! I just made it allergy friendly for my son (wheat, dairy and egg free). i used vegan butter instead of butter and 2 T flax meal + 6T water boiled and cooled to replace the eggs. i did have to cook them for 13 mins. but that's because of the flax meal. everyone loved them, and i say loved in past tense because they were gone in no time!

YUM!  My husband made these last night for the kids.  They sounded like good "snow storm" cookies, and they were great!!!  He made them pretty large, so we got nowhere near 33 cookies, but they are soft, chewy, and chocolaty!  This one is a keeper!

Someone mentioned that there seemed to be something missing with these cookies. For me that something was 1 TBSP finely ground espresso. I skipped the powdered sugar, and like others, skipped chilling the dough and just dropped dough by spoonfuls onto parchment paper. The cookies puffed up, then flattened out, so they looked a bit dubious when cooled. But they are GOOD! And better on the second day than the first, and the coffee addition was just right.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!! I've used it several times since I found it a couple years back, and they disappear as soon as they are cooled!! I usually make a simple peanut butter glaze to drizzle on the top to give it a kick, and they're perfect!!

Yummy cookies!  I haven't had a chance yet to make them after letting them sit in the fridge and they were fine, just spread a little bit.  The choices are endless with these - great dough by itself, can't wait to try adding things!

I love this recipe because the cookies come out soft and chewy. I have had bad experiences with chocolate cookies in the past coming out hard or biscuit -like. This is also the perfect recipe to experiment with. I added white chocolate toffee and it was delicious. Note, these are very sweet and chocolately. Next time I will try to reduce the sugar.

Only had half the cocoa it called so, so used 2 squares unsweetened Baker's chocolate (melted) for the rest.   Tasty!  Reminded me a lot of chocolate muffins or cupcakes!

Texture turned out well, but flavor not so sweet. Luckily, I wanted to use these for an artistic treat and ended up making a custard filling/frosting to go in between 2 cookies. If I make these again, I'll experiment with flavoring, prob add mini m&ms or something.

Awesome cookies! Perfect for that must have chocolate kind of day. I mixed in dark chocolate chips, chopped pecans, and little caramel balls. They are great! But you must have milk in the house! I literally had to go to the store while the last sheet was in the oven on my husbands request. :)

Followed the recipe to a T. It was good, but nothing special. It's chocolate brownie cookies.

These are just awesome. My dough wasn't sticky in the slightest, but I still chilled as directed and they came out beautifully. I needed a cookie recipe to use up some Andes Peppermint Crunch chips and this was perfect. These would be wonderful without any additions though, the amount of chocolate is spot on. Thanks, I'll use this recipe again :)

Delicious! I just got done making these and they are great. Soft and chocolate-y without being too sweet. A perfect chocolate representative in my cookie array this year. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Happy Holidays!

I love these!Next time I will try to cut down on the butter a bit as they stey quite oily. flavor and texture are otherwise great. I didn't flatten the balls on the baking sheet and they came out pretty nice. The other thing I did was I stuck the batter into the freezer for not even 15 min. handeled well. Easy, tasty, I will make them again.

I used whole wheat flour, and non hydrogenated margarine. I made about a dozen and then I added dark chocolate chunks to the last of the dough. (My hubby's request.) I made 4 with the chunks and they're gone. I will definitely add these cookies to my recipe book.

These are super rich, but they're perfect for ice cream sandwiches.  I halved the recipe because I knew my boyfriend and I wouldn't be able to stop eating them, and I was right.

These were really good. I give only 4 stars because the texture was a bit different than I had wanted(They were a bit flat and more crunchy than cakey). Others said they were cakey, but I feel they were more like a brownie, especially in flavor.

I needed something "chocolatey" in my freezer for company and just finished making a batch of these.  This is a very lovely cookie that would be in place at either an informal lunch or fancy tea.  I followed the recipe except that, instead of pressing down with a fork, I pressed a toasted pecan half into the center of each.  I removed them from the oven while they were still not quite set (I do that with most of my cookies) and let them stand on the pan for another minute before removing them VERY CAREFULLY with a metal spatula to a rack to cool. I made only 16, and froze the remainder of the dough (a pleasure - almost FUN to work with!) into 2 more packets of 16 each.  I am so happy I found this recipe - a real keeper!

Soft, cake-like cookies! Wonderfully chewy! I even used Egg Beaters instead of eggs and it still came out wonderful.  Be sure to use parchment paper or spray your cookie sheet.  I had to leave mine in the 350 degree oven for a good 11 minutes...Don't under-bake these.

These cookies are wonderful! I made them 2 days ago and have been storing them in a ziploc bag. These cookies are soft, a little chewy, and taste just like a brownie. This will definitely be a repeat recipe at our house!

Soft chewy cookies, just like the recipe said.  Not too sweet or too chocolatey, a nice balance of both.  I put shredded coconut into half the batch and it was delicious!

These are SO great! They bake up chocolaty and soft. We enjoyed adding butterscotch chips to a half of the batch and raspberry creme-filled chocolate chips to the other half. I will be making these again for the family to enjoy on Christmas Day.

EXCELLENT!  I neglected to refrigerate the first batch, and they were too crispy.  I put the second batch in the fridge for an hour, like the recipe said, and they were perfect - moist, chewy and delicious!  Great recipe to whip up when the pantry is low!

These are awesome with crumbled up Andes mints added in the mix. After mixing the batter I split it in half; one half as the recipe directed (without Andes)and the other half with. the half with the mint really blew everyones socks off whereas the plain were pretty good, but not as outstanding. Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper!

These were great.  I made changes to  make them gluten-free for my husband.  I substituted 1 1/2 cups rice, 1/4 cup cornstarch and 1/4 cup Masa mix for the 2 cups of flour.  My kids devoured them and they don't normally like gluten-free desserts.  This is a keeper for us.

I’ve been using this recipe for years and I love it! So delicious and so easy to customize. First I tend to make it a bit darker, 1 1/4 cups sugar and 3/4 cup cocoa powder. I like my chocolate dark.  Then there are so many possible additions! My kids favorite is the quadruple chocolate cookie. (Dark chocolate chips, milk chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips in a chocolate cookie is 4 kinds of chocolate!)   Or you can add peppermint extract and chopped Andes candy for the mint lovers. Or Reese’s pieces or mini peanut butter cups. Or a rolo in the center of each cookie for a caramel surprise. My favorite is caramel m&ms and crushed pretzel crips sprinkled with a little kosher salt for a salty, crunchy, caramel sensation! So many cookies, so little time!

I don't know what I did, but mine spread a lot and were basically flat, but soft.  I chilled the dough for over an hour, and even tried scooping them out, freezing the scooped out dough for 15 mins, then baking, but again they became flat.  I had wanted to do a jam thumbprint type cookie with homemade strawberry jam, but the jam would've just run out.  I used all butter, and even added some extra flour to try to firm it up.  I am an experienced baker, but it still baffled me.  In the end, they still tasted good and everyone at work said the recipe was still a keeper.  I told everyone I was calling them Brookies (brownie cookies).

Next time I will sandwich them with a creme filling and dust them with powdered sugar.  Not the jam thumbprint I wanted, but I'm sure they'll still be yummy.

So good and easy. I followed the directions as stated, chilled for 2 hours then rolled into balls and flattened with palms of hands, baked for 10 minutes. The perfect soft chocolate cookies.

My mom baked great chocolate cookies when we were kids. I've been searching for a recipe that would come close to the delicious goodness in every batch she made. This recipe was the clear winner for me. Usually, I have to adjust the recipe to accommodate serving many people, but that's never a problem. Yes, the batter is a little sticky, even with an hour or two in the fridge, but it's still doable. My oven does the job in about 10 minutes. After cooling thoroughly, I frost each cookie with a creamy white frosting, and decorate with sprinkles. I've made these cookies for several church bake sales, and they are always a hit with the kids - young and old ;)  My older brother now searches for these at our family gatherings, looking for 'Mom's cookies'. Recalling happy family memories with a cookie? You bet!

Very good.  Recommend not dusting with powdered sugar, though.  It was difficult to make them dusted right.  Other than that, they tasted delicious.  Friends at work raved and snapped them up immediately.

This has definitely become a favorite recipe.  You can add all kinds of stuff to these cookies and it only makes them better.  Chocolate chips, caramel pieces, nuts...  I even made a fluffy peanut butter icing and made a sandwich cookie.  They were gone before I knew it!  These are constantly requested by my friends and family.  Make them and you'll see what all the excitement is about.  YUM!!!

Perfect cookies! I was in a rush and did not refrigerate the dough and they came out great, sort of brownie-like. Can't wait to make them again and add peanut butter chips or peppermint crumbles or a million other things you could do with this basic recipe

I just made these for the second time, and they came out as delicious as the first time!  I'm gluten-free and vegan, so I use vegan butter, flax seed for eggs, and my own GF flour mixture.  Then, after rolling, I dipped them in unsweetened coconut, which toasted on top while the cookies baked.  Yum!  Can't wait to take them to a party tomorrow, where no one will even know they're V and GF.

Cakey cookies are usually not my favorite but these are divine. They are very chocolatey - I worried at first that there was too much cocoa, so if you're not into that cocoa taste, I would recommend cutting back on it just a bit. I plan on using this recipe as the base of all of my chocolate cookies, now. I added just a bit of buckeye sugar (peanut butter powder and sugar) to the dough for a slightly nutty flavor and also added a cup of dark chocolate chips to make double chocolate cookies. I can't wait to try other variations!

These cookies are awesome! The dough is incredibly delicious and the cookies are just as good. The ingredients are all fairly basic and cheap, which is great. I'm a college student, so cheaper is generally better. Also, I like adding chocolate chips, when I have them. Oh, and I've never added the confectioner's sugar, and they still taste great.
Occasionally, I'll have trouble getting them off the cookie sheet and they'll turn out really crumbly, but that could just be because my cookie sheet is incredibly old.

These have become a quick favorite. The basic cookie is wonderful plain. I make the cookie per the recipe - no changes. I've experimented with different drizzles and toppings. The white chocolate raspberry drizzle is a favorite, but I enjoyed also enjoyed these with a semi-sweet chocolate cherry topping (chocolate chips and pureed canned sweet cherries). The cookie is divine; topping it takes this recipe to heavenly.

I had a major chocolate urge and even though it was nine at night and with an hour refrigeration time it was totally worth it. Chocolate deliciousness all the way. Definitely going to make again my one suggestion is I think it need a longer refrigeration time. It wasn't firm for me with just an hour

We made these Gluten free. Simply Swapped the all-purpose flour, cocoa & baking soda with gluten free versions. They turned out like chocolate macaroons and tasted just as divine..  Crispy on the outside soft and yummy in the middle.

WOW! This batter was awesome. I made some last weekend and put a mimi reeses' peanut butter cup in the middle. I liked them best cooked at about 7 mins, they dont seem done at that time but they set up nicely. The dough did get very thick and I almost burned up the mixer, had to hand mix toward the end. Otherwise, very very very good. After doubling the recipe in total I made roughly 100 cookies, filling 3 gallon size ziplock bags.

EXCELLENT cookie recipe! I'm 24 weeks along and have craved cheese cake for the past 3, but tonight got a sudden urge to use my Ghirardelli cocoa and reeeally wanted cookies. These were soooo delicious and every single batch came out perfect! Hopefully there'll be enough to last for the kids' lunch tomorrow! These are a new favorite in my kitchen!!! Mama and baby-to-be approved!!!

These cookies turned out exactly as I expected, they are soft and intensely chocolatey, just the thing to satisfy my chocolate cravings.  My husband doesn't have a big sweet tooth but even he loves these.  I followed this recipe exactly, I didn't chill the dough for very long because it was pretty firm when I was done mixing so I didn't think it needed it. Definitely a "keeper", I'm sure I'll be making these again before long.

These are great!  They taste like hot cocoa in a cookie.  I ran out of butter so used crisco, but otherwise followed recipe.  Next time I might put a marshmallow frosting on top or sandwiched between two cookies.

The first time I made these I cut the recipe in half and substituted a mixture of flax seed and water in place of the egg, as my daughter is allergic. I also topped them with sunflower seeds and powdered sugar. Unfortunately, they fell and spread pretty drastically in the oven. The first batch were just alright and that may be because of my substitutions (which I will have to try again until I get it right).
The second batch I went exactly by the recipe,(except for using whole wheat flour. We dont use white.) I even added a small amount of baking powder to see if it would contribute any to helping them keep their puffy shape. These baked up nicely and fell in once I took them out however, not as bad as the others. Still soft, and tasty. And this may be also because whole wheat flour is much denser than white, and if the structure is delicate enough it becomes to heavy to retain a light shape. 
In conclusion, these were still soft, light and tasty despite everything I had done to them either attempt. I enjoyed them and at eight months pregnant I cant stop eating them. Although I probably should! I have saved this recipe and will use it in the future. Thank you for it.

5 stars well earned.   Only one tip that I have:  Keep dough in refrigerator in between batches to keep a good texture.
Excellent for chocolate cravings!

Moist with a wonderful chocolate flavour that isn't overbearing.  This would also be wonderful with orange extract.

AMAZING. I don't usually have issues only eating two, but these were so good I couldn't help myself! I accidentally used just half the butter (was planning on halving the recipe but forgot halfway) and they turned out fantastically :) So if anyone is concerned about using too much butter - it's fine with just half a cup :)  (hehe tho can't begin to imagine how heavenly they'd be with more butter!!!)

These are really good cookies!  They were pretty much what I was expecting, except mine flattened out a little more than what I thought they'd be like.  I added white chocolate chips.  They stayed soft, and chewable, just the way I was hoping.

These are great cookies! If your just in the mood for chocolate these are perfect. This recipe seems like it would be easy to add a little twist like , frosting ,chocolate chips, nuts, coconut ect... First time I've made them and my family loves them! I think next time I'm going to add a little twist with them:)

These cookies are awesome!  You can indeed make them as is and have some amazing cookies - hence the five stars.  But I also made them with a mix of white and brown sugar, I decreased the flour by a quarter cup, increased the cocoa to one cup.  I used dark chocolate cocoa.  Then I made cream cheese frosting to make sandwiches.  These have been voted the best sweet dessert ever at my house. :)

Rich, rather than sweet.  I took care to follow the recipe exactly the first time (including refrigerating the dough), and the cookies came out beautifully.  Extremely soft, with a good chocolate flavor.  I would, however, probably reduce the butter slightly and add more sugar the next time I make them, and possibly experiment with using mint extract rather than vanilla.

These cookies came out soft, moist and chewy, but the taste was just "bleh". They weren't sweet and I likely won't bother making them again. After all the positive reviews I thought this would be phenomenal, but I was utterly disappointed.

such a great recipe!  I added a handful of chocolate chips to the dough and refrigerated it for a couple hours.  It rolled easily into balls which I then flattened slightly and baked- 8 minutes was perfect.  The kids absolutely loved these.  Thank you.

Tasty and simple enough to follow for an amateur baker like me. (2nd attempt at baking!) 

However, I do feel "Prep Time" should be stated a tad longer considering there's a waiting period of 1 hour or more for the dough to harden up. Or maybe have it highlighted that there is a waiting time.

These are easily in my top 3 favorite cookies of all time. Chewy brownie center with a crisp chocolate outer cookie. Simply amazing. I didn't change a thing! I know my brownie recipe greatly benefits from a tsp of cinnamon or cinnamon extract and also a dash of chili powder, so I might add those next time. This is the only chocolate cookie recipe you'll ever need.

Very yummy cookie, but it needs a little tweaking.  I tried the recipe exactly as written except subbing 1:1 golden flavour crisco for the butter (did not dust with icing sugar.)  I see that the recipe actually needs a little more sweetness. Not sure i'd want to go the filling/frosting route that many have tried.  The second batch is in the oven now ....I added some SS chocolate chips to the next batch in the oven now.  Will continue experimenting.  I like idea of raspberry extract instead of vanilla.  WIll try that next time.  I did not have any trouble with the batch being sticky   I'm not sure it needs the fridge time. I used a large cookie scoop and then flattened with my hand.  My kids compare these to a chocolate bearpaw cookie.

I liked the cookies a lot. They were soft and cake like. The only suggestion to improve it would be to use real chocolate rather than cocoa powder. I was worried because the batter was so wet and i still managed to roll them up into balls which had terrible shapes. But once they were baking in the oven, they spread out and was looking like perfect round cookies. Tasted awesome! Could have added a walnut to each cookie just to make it look a bit more artistic

Great EASY recipe! I altered it a bit using an egg replacer, soy butter, whole wheat pastry flour, evaporated palm sugar, and raw cacao powder as I'm vegan. Altering non-vegan recipes is always a challenge but these turned out lovely! Tastes similar to a brownie but has the texture of a cookie. I imagine they would be great with a bit of mint extract added. Thanks for sharing this recipe! :)

These cookies are delicious as is (I did not use powdered sugar) but I added chopped Reeses to the second half of my dough and they were even better. I may try these with a peanut butter glaze next time. I was worried margarine would ruin them, but they turned out great. However, I used about 1/3 tsp of salt instead of 1/2 tsp with my margarine. My dough was not roll-able after an hour in the fridge, so I made drop cookies instead.

I've got to try these, but was just wondering if someone could tell me if the picture on the recipe was made with mini marshmallows or what is that.  It looks like a "rocky road" cookie. Yummmmm

Amazing! They taste like delicious brownies. We made them with chocolate chips and then again with peanut butter chips. Both worked great.

These are some YUMMY chocolate cookies! Just made these today and are a big hit :) I added white chocolate chips and then when they were done I dipped just the top in melted semi-sweet chocolate and topped it off with sprinkles. YUM! Will most definetly add these to my favorite cookie list. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

The recipe taste great, but the prep time needs to be altered! if you want to follow the recipe exactly. Letting it set covered for 1 hour in the refridgerator and saying prep time is 20 min are two different things all together..... hello

Super soft and delicious.  And quick.  Refrigeration was not necessary, but greasing/buttering the pan helped to remove them.  Will definitely bake again.

wonderful! I did have to add a little additional flour and refridgerate the dough before baking, to avoid the cookies spreading out too much, but the outcome was great! almost a mix of a brownie, cake and cookie!

Really, really good cookies. My friends have nick-named them "crack cookies" because of how wonderfully addictive they are. 

For those wondering about what kind of cocoa powder to use, I've used both Callebaut dutch-processed cocoa and Trader Joe's Natural unsweetened cocoa, the cookies turned out great both ways. I use the trader Joe's cocoa powder now because it's less then half the price of the Callebaut.

I "won" the best cookie at this year's cookie exchange. I "smooshed" mint M&Ms on top of the balls rather than adding them to the dough.

These are AMAZING cookies! Everyone who eats them loves them.  Very versatile too - I've added chocolate chips for double chocolate, and also made them into thumbprint cookies and put strawberry jam and peanut butter in the middles.  Yum.

fantastic. Its best to take them out when they're still slightly undercooked, as they will then be even softer (the texture is wonderful by the way), and have an almost creamy chocolate inside. I've made this about 10 times already and my family LOVES it. A definate keeper that everyone always asks the recipe for!!!

Yummy! They came out nice and soft. I let the batter sit in the fridge for about an hour in a half. Rolled into balls on a cookie sheet and flattened them a bit before cooking.

I couldn't keep them around!  Made a batch for the house, and they were gone before I could have many.  Then I brought them to the office, with the same results.  They're so incredibly yummy, and everyone was very impressed.  Nice and chewy, and after making them a few times, I've learned that they still taste fresh days later.

I only added 1/2 cup of cocoa to get a more milk chocolate flavor. And I rolled them in powdered sugar before baking. They were delicious.

One of the best ever cookies. I doubled the batch, and used 1 1/2 cups cocoa instead of 1 1/3, and added just a splash of milk because the dough was pretty stiff, but the cookies are chewy, with an almost brownie-like texture. I also added Andes Mint Chips.

Rolled these in powdered sugar, and they were perfect.  Lightly crispy edges, soft and chewy centers - yummy!

I didn't have the sugar to put on top, so maybe that really would've given these that extra something, but the cookies themselves are a little plain for my taste. Still tasty, though. And the dough is very easy to handle.

I must say I have never had a cookie that tasted better the second day than right of the oven - but this was that cookie.  I did add about a cup of chocolate chips but otherwise made just as listed.  A very good cookie.

This cookies are pretty good.  I think for those who don't like overly sweet desserts this would be perfect.  I love sweet and rich so I either add chocolate chips or peanut butter chips!  With this addition I would definitely give these cookies 5 stars.

Easy and delicious! I made a few changes based on a mix previous reviews and my own preference, and couldn't be happier:  - increased cocoa to 3/4c. - added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to batter - reduced sugar by about 2-3 TBSP - sprinkled the lightest amount of fine granulated sugar and sea salt before baking - added 1/2c. chunky peanut butter to half of the batter - increased bake time to 13 minutes  Cookies came out perfectly chocolatey and not too sweet. They were lightly crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. They are also now all gone. ;)

These were very easy to make. I am not a regular baker and still had all the ingredients except for the cocoa right in the pantry. I accidently melted the butter instead of softening it and I think it was for the better. The batter ends up being very thick so the extra liquid from the butter worked out well. I also only baked them for 8 minutes and they came out perfectly with a soft middle. I added chocolate chips to give them some texture.

These are a great staple for the cookie jar.  The changes I made were to add 3/4 cup of cocoa instead of just 2/3 and I added some white chocolate chips and rolled them in granulated sugar before baking.  Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.  Definitely a keeper.

Wow! Fantastic.  I didn't even refrigerate them and I added a cup of pecans.  No icing is necessary.  The light sprinkling of powdered sugar on the top makes them pretty.

I've been making these cookies for years. Very yummy, but they don't have a long shelf-life - altho they get eaten so fast that it's rarely an issue! I make mine with a pkg. of Reece's peanut butter chips or mint chocolate chips.

This recipe definately earned all five stars. These cookies were easy to make and disappeared quickly...I tried them out yesterday and had to make at least 5 batches before the night was over because they were so good....They are great just the way they are but you can definately play around with the recipe and add other ingredients to it like chocolate chips, toffee pieces, m&m candies or mint to add a different flavor to them....This is going to be a keeper....

Great cookie made from pantry staples.  Nice chocolate flavor and chewy.  Reminds me of a flat brownie.  I was disappointed they did not stay puffed up more but I did use butter.  I may try margarine next time.  I used a melon baller to scoop out the cookies and passed the dough over to my boys.  They rolled into balls and placed on the cookie sheets.  They had a great time and couldn't wait for the first batch to come out of the oven!

YUM!  I had a lot of fun playing with this recipe.  I used half whole wheat and half white flour, one cup brown sugar with 1/2 cup white, increased the baking soda to 1 tsp, and added 2 tsp of coconut extract.  Then I wrapped about 1 tbsp of dough around a Hershey Kiss for each cookie, then rolled in coarse sugar.  They came out perfectly chewy with a great crunch on the outside and a gooey chocolate middle.  Thank you for submitting this recipe!

Very soft cookies! Reminiscent of brownies. I've tried to make these cookies with white chocolate chips and semi-sweet chocolate chips, and I've got to say, my favorite is just the plain cookie. Hint: to make it easier, just use a small scoop for the balls. That way, it's neater and you don't have to wait an hour.

these are wonderful but do not expect them to stay puffy (they puff in the oven.  they are very flat so do not use a fork to mash them down before baking!  tastes like mini brownies.

Yummmmmm!  These are great!  Thanks to the reviewer who suggested to use the Peanut Butter Frosting recipe on this site to top them off!  Wow, is that good on them.  I overbaked the first batch, but now I've got it figured out.  The second batch was perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

These are delicious! Almost like a brownie - very soft and chewy. I added some chocolate chips and coconut to mine for a bit of extra texture. I also did not need to refrigerate the batter before rolling the cookies.

Why isn't this recipe more popular?! I've been making these cookies for years and they are PERFECT as written. The are so easy and so fail-proof. If you want them to have crackled tops, don't flatten them ... leave them in balls, they will spread a little, and crackle. (Andes mint chips are an AWESOME addition, especially for the holidays!)

delicious and easy to make. i love me a soft cookie, and these are super soft. i like how the cocoa makes them taste a little bittersweet. i put the powdered sugar on too soon after baking and it got wet. i will wait until they cool completely next time before adding the powdered sugar. also, i used my silpat, and it worked great with these cookies. i will be baking these again!!

these cookies were great.... the only difference was i mistakenly used baking powder in place of baking soda,but the cookies still came out great! i rolled them up in the confection sugar before baking as well, and i cooked 7 mins, then took out and flattened them with a fork before returning to the oven for the last 3 mins.

I made this recipe as is.  I did roll in confectioners sugar before baking. As my kids say, "uber good" in satisfying any chocolate craving.  The cookie is rich, chewy, fudgy-chocolatey so you won't go overboard eating too many because it would be too much.  Thank you for this uber chocolate cookie recipe.

Wow, these were great! I halved the recipe and skipped the confectioners sugar (going to use these for ice cream sandwiches), but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. My only complaint would be that they have the tiniest hint of a salty taste, but other than that they're perfect, texture and taste.

These were average. I was not blown away by the flavor, texture or appearance- they are actually quite boring. I can see how they would be a good cookie for an ice cream sandwich, but I agree with the reviewer who said  "I recommend these for indiscriminate children but not for gatherings or events regardless of formality." She is bang on.

Mmm, great cookies! I made these into small balls and rolled them in powdered sugar before baking them - this gave me about 70 cookies. The kids came in from playing outsideand were SO excited to have warm cookies waiting for them. I'll serve these with hot coffee next time we have friends over for game night!

The recipe is great!!! I modified a few things for my own personal taste. I used 
1/2 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown sugar and I also added chocolate chips. The cookies are soft and delcious. Make sure you don't over bake. Great recipe thanks!

Delicious!  I made these on an impulse and wanted them to be ready when the kids came home from school.  Being pressed for time, I didn't refrigerate the dough.  It was a bit sticky, so instead of trying to roll it into balls I just plopped it onto the cookie sheet in vaguely ball-like heaps.  Baking for 7 minutes produced perfect cookies--crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle.  My kids went nuts over them, and I have to admit I've eaten more than my fair share.  I did also add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dough.  It gives it a really nice flavor without being too obvious.  I'm sure I'll be making these again!  Yum!

This cookie is receiving 2 stars because the finished product is flat.  Rolling them gives a nicer, more finished edge and a slight increase in height, however, even then we're talking 1/4" high at the most.  The texture is their best feature.  The flavor is nice and subtle but their appearance is unremarkable. I recommend these for indiscriminate children but not for gatherings or events regardless of formality.

This recipe got the two thumbs up! I also added some white chocolate chips into the mixture. It  made it more interesting to eat, the white chocolate chips really goes well with the milk chocolate base. Will make again for sure!

I'm just starting to experiment with baking and these were fast and easy. I used my friend and boyfriend as my guinea pigs and they loved them. My friend has already asked me for the receipe. I will bake some more for the holidays.

yummy!  used real butter and dutch-process cocoa. cookies are like little cakes!  confectioners sugar on top makes a great presentation, but if that's not an issue, leave it off. enjoy!

These cookies were great!!  I added the andes mint as other reviewers had suggested and left out the confectioner's sugar.  I have only made them once and handed out the recipe twice.  Thanks for a winner.

WOW!!! Yummy cookies! I saw the tiny Andes mint chips at Target, so I added these as did some other reviewers. I left out the powdered sugar- partly out of laziness & partly because I only had unopened boxes in my pantry & didn't want to open one for a small amount! Anyway, I figured they didn't need it since I did add chips. My dough was in the fridge for several hours & was not sticky at all. A little hard, but not too much trouble to roll into balls. Cookies came out perfect after 9 minutes. Beautiful & delicious!!! Thanks so much!
