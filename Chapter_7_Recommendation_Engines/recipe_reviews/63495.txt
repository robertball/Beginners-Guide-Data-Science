I needed a bit more flavor. The rosemary and thyme were fine as well as the lavender but I missed a little bit of fresh ground pepper and seasoning salt. Only made two steaks and threw them on the grill as I made burgers. Very simple to prepare -- I do think the oil is an excessive amount and should be reduced significantly.

I used thick-cut boneless chops & decreased the cooking time to compensate.  Next time, I will brine them first in a saltwater bath w/ a couple of sprigs of the herbs. That will help keep them juicy & add flavor. I was unsure as to whther the recipe meant to use the greenery of the lavender or teh lavender buds. Never used the greenery before but assumed that it would be "lavender buds" if that was what was intended, so I used the greenery. I was also unsure of using so much, since lavender can have such an overpowering flavor, but I braved it. I was soo glad....it had lots of flavor w/out the unpleasant "perfumey" taste that the buds can have. I decreased the oil by half & next time, I will only give them a rub of oil & then just rub on the herbs, to avoid flare-ups on the grill. I drizzled a bit of honey on the plate to dress it up some & it added the perfect flavor. We both got more "drizzle" when we ran out. ;o) Loved the recipe & I will definitely repeat but I'll make my suggested changes next time.

So good!  I cooked them in a frying pan using the marinade oil, since it was way too cold outside to grill, and they were incredible!

I soaked the pork in the herbs, then pan fried it and served it with noodles and a creamy white gravy. OUTSTANDING.

I tried this a couple of weeks ago on my husband, mom and dad, and they all loved it! My first lavender recipe to try and it was delicious.

Like everyone else said, they needed some salt.  I brined the steaks for 2 hours before preparing, also there was a bit too much lavender, and too much oil. Next time, I think I'll cut those in half.

This was very good HOWEVER trying to find fresh lavender isn't always an easy thing so we had to omit it. But the flavor was good just the same.

Forgot to mention I used tsp Penzey's  Old World Seasoning added to recipe. Takes care of what you may miss without S & P.

I admit, I made A LOT of changes to this recipe. I used 1 cup of Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1/2 cup of Worcestershire, 1/4 cup of Italian dressing, and 2 T melted butter to the rosemary and lavender----I had no Thyme.

I  marinated the frozen pork while it thawed, about 2 hours. Turning it often.  This was grilled and served with Au Gratin Potatoes and baked beans.....YUM
Not dry and full of flavor.
