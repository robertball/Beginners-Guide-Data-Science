I tried this recipe and it was VERY GOOD. I didn't have liquid smoke, so I left it out. Otherwise, I made it to recipe. This will be my cornbread recipe from now on! Thanx

These are very good; very moist even without sour cream and butter, which taste great but add way too much fat.  I was out of liquid smoke (yikes! - a staple after being a veg for years) so I subbed a dry mesquite seasoning.  I've never thought of adding salsa to corn bread (although I've added almost everything else)!  This is my new healthier fave - thanks!

I make little mini pop-able muffins out of this recipe, and they go perfect with traditional chili or a white chicken chili, I even make them to serve with my Cajun Jambalaya.  I don't usually add in the liquid smoke, but instead use a shredded chipotle pepper cheddar cheese which still gives it that warm smokey peppery flavor!  I also use a Mexican corn blend, which has chopped red and green peppers.  ...They are best served warm.

I didn't have any liquid smoke so I skipped that but the muffins were great and really easy!  You can change it up using different types of salsa and I added some shredded cheese on top of the muffins before baking.

I brought these to a Boss's day luncheon and was terribly embarrassed.  They were very strange- in flavor and in texture.  Maybe they are best right out of the oven- I don't know.  I felt horrible that no one had anything nice to eat with their chili.

My husband gave these corn muffins thumbs up and I agree.  Between the two of us we ate every one over a couple of days.  Pop em in the micro 15 sec and they were great with our taco soup. 

I opted to leave out the liquid smoke.  I used black bean and corn salsa and my husband insisted I put a couple of sliced jalapenos in each of his muffins.  Also, I used what I had on hand which was the shredded mexican cheese. Yummy, can't wait to make it again.

These were very good. I stuck to the recipe exactly, using a black bean and corn salsa. I liked the smoky flavor very much. I served these with my boyfriend's homemade chili. I found that 20 minutes was the perfect amount of time. Thanks for the recipe!
