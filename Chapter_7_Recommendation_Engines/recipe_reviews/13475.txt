This recipe is delicious!  I took it to a church potluck, and came back with an empty bowl. Now I plan on taking it to our family Thanksgiving.
Thanks for the recipe!

Makes a wondeful and differnt side dish to any holiday meal, or just because. I did, however leave off the corn chips and just topped with cheese.

I did not care for this recipe. It wasn't a side dish. With the egg and egg whites it turned out to taste more like a breakfast casserole.

we made this and everyone thought it was kind of dry and bland, not creamy like a corn pudding should be.

Simple, yet different.  Thought it had too many onions, but others loved it.  Might be good served with a dollop of salsa and/or sour cream.  Definetly will make again.  Millons of possibilities with variations.  Make this one for dinner and they will say OLE~

I have been making corn pudding or casserole for a long time. I really liked this recipe for the most part. I had no red bell pepper so used chopped pimento instead & I used green onions instead of yellow onion. I also added some bacon and cheddar cheese to the topping. Its a recipe I will make again.

Many corn pudding recipes are rather bland. Yes, I liked the addition of peppers, garlic and onion in this recipe (most don't have them) and if you want a little extra kick, try adding some chopped jalepenos--not bland at all!

This dish really hit the spot! My changes were only because I didn't have on hand the original items: green pepper, Mozzarella cheese, dried parsley (1 tsp), 2 whole eggs, no chips on top.

I add a teaspoon of Cajun seasoning to give it an extra kick - my husband loves the extra heat. We make it every year for Thanksgiving.

It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without this corn pudding recipe!  The crumbled chips on top combined with moistness of the pudding create the perfect balance of texture.  A simple and delightful recipe.

It was not real "puddiny".  I think it would be better if the corn was pulsed a few times in a food processor to make the pieces smaller and release some of the liquid.   If you are not expecting a pudding, it is good.  I added some jalapenos and a pinch of cayenne for Chef John!
