I use half a cucumber sliced thin, half a jalapeno seeded & sliced, 1/4 cup cilantro - muddle them with a wooden spoon in a pitcher.  Add 18oz silver tequila, 8oz lime juice, 6oz agave nectar (available at Walmart or Costco), stir & chill for at least an hour.  Strain into ice-filled glasses rimmed with a mixture of lime zest & kosher salt. I made some today - happy Cinco de Mayo!

Being from the San Diego area we've been drinking these margaritas for many years, an if your ever on Shelter Island you can meet the Bartender at Miguels who has been making these for 10 plus years.  The trick is to use a guava nectar not syrup an to chop up both the cucumber and Jelopeno into small pieces along with some cilantro, shaken through ice and served with or without salt rimmed glass.  No waiting required, just enjoy....

I infused an entire bottle of tequila blanco with 4 halved jalapeños and 1/2 of a large (sliced) cucumber. I also added about a cup of triple sec to the tequila. Omit the syrup as triple sec is already sweet...unless you like girlie/dessert types of drinks. :P I let this marinate for 3 days in the fridge. Add the fresh squeezed lime juice when ready to serve! So much fresher that way. :) This recipe is also quite amazing with ripe mango instead of cucumbers!

Winner of the Gold Star Award!  About once a year I find a new recipe that is worthy of more than five stars.  This one deserves highest honors.   If this doesn’t make you feel the summertime fun, nothing will.   I agree with other reviewers that you need to use at least a half a cucumber in order to taste the cucumber.   The jalapeno gives it a fun little kick, but they are superb even without the jalapeno—except they go down a little too smooth and a little too fast.  Thank you, daddyyumyum, for sharing your outstanding recipe!   (P.S.  Simple syrup is easy to make, just follow the recipe for Simple Syrup here on allrecipes.)

These were amazing! I quadrupled the recipe for a party and EVERYONE loved them and wanted the recipe. Some people even went as far as to say it was the best drink they have ever had. ... I didn't add the orange liquor and used a little less of the agave nectar than called for.  I can't wait to make these again!

I made a monster batch of these for my sister's wedding, and they were a HUGE HIT! Proportionally speaking, I doubled the ratio of jalapenos (we like a good spicy kick, here in Texas) and used sweet & sour mix instead of simple syrup. Wonderful & refreshing!

Nice tasting Margarita with the extra cucumber as others suggested, but yielded only three 1/2 c. (4 oz.) servings. Not quite sure where the four "pint" servings came from.

Love Love Love this recipe --- delicious!  I eliminated the simple syrup - think it's sweet enough without. Also - had no fresh lime, so I used the bottled lemon juice. Taste almost just as good!
Have fun and Cheers!

I too love this combination. Try using Agave nectar to sweetened as desired instead of simple syrup and I prefer to fresh muddle a little cucumber and jalapeño and leave in glass for taste and looks. Also big improvement is using tajin lime salt mixed with a little cayenne to rim it!!  Yeehaw!

I made this for a crowd at a Mexican themed dinner party. They were a hit! The only change I made was cutting back on the simple syrup. I used about a fourth of what it called for.

Amazing, made it with modifications recommended in the reviews with half a cucumber sliced, added cilantro and a touch of cumin  powder. I diced  half a jalapeno and then crushed the vegetables like you do for a mojito, to release the flavors and it was yummy.

Made as listed, very good. ALso made and muddled the pepper and cucumber into the drink mixture - jalapeño was a little overwhelming for us.

Excellent!  My only advice is to quadruple the recipe, because people will want MORE!  I rubbed the glass rims with lime, and then pressed them into salt/sugar.  Yum!!

I used more cucumber slices and muddled them.  I could taste the cucumber but didn't taste the jalapenos.  Still, this gave me an idea of much spicier cocktail using jalapenos, so thank you for sharing!

This was good, but the cucumber/jalapeno flavor wasn't as prominent as I was hoping. Maybe a longer infusion, or maybe muddling them a little would work?

Wow!  This is delicious, only substitution I made was to use light agave nectar instead of simple syrup.  I let it sit for just a little over an hour and then took the jalapeño out thinking it might be way too spicy if left in any longer, also used some thick cut cucumber slices.  So good, can't wait to make for company!

Oh boy!  May a want to take most of the seeds out of the recipe(Jalapeños), but man is this a winner!
