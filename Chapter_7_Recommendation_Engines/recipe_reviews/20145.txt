Very good simple drink for the light drinker. I recommend throwing a slice of lemon or lime in it too.

We make this with Peach Fresca and a slice of lime. The perfect refreshing summer beverage! Not the same old same old!

WOW. Good stuff. I added just a hair more vodka as I like my drinks stronger. I also used citrus Smirnoff. So good.
