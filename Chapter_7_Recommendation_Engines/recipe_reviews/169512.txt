try to boil the bacon before you start. it is still close to the texture of uncooked bacon, and you can still wrap it around the pepper, and use the toothpick to hold it, but you cook off the fat, so your bacon gets crunchy in the oven instead of greasy

These were fantastic, followed the recipe exactly.  The only difference was that I doubled the cook time as I like my bacon a little more well done.  I did soak the peppers in iced water for 10 minutes before  using, which just took a little of the hot flavour out, but they still had a kick.  Will certainly be making these again.

Absolutely DELISH. Since my husband and I can't really do super spicy things, I soaked the sliced and deseeded peppers in a bowl of ice water for a few hours to take out some of the heat. I added a dash of basil to the mixture and it gave it a bit more flavor. Once I take them off the pan I place them between paper towels to soak up some of the excess grease from the bacon. These are a must-have at all of my potlucks at work, and my husband's platoon gatherings once a month. They're usually the first food to vanish!

Best stuffed jalapeno recipe EVER.  I used the precooked bacon sold with the regular bacon because it is pliable enough to wrap but since it's precooked it browns quickly and crisply (I sometimes have problems with regular bacon not crisping up).

For those that don't like the grease issue from the bacon, throw them on the grill. The grease goes through to the coals and gives it a whole new level.

A little too salty for my taste. Next time I will reduce the amount of ranch dressing and garlic just a tad. Overall great recipe.

I would rate this recipe higher if I could! These are absolutely amazing. As some other reviewers suggested I soaked the peppers in ice water for a few hours. I also put a wire cooling rack on top of a baking sheet and baked the peppers on that so the bacon would crisp up all around and so the grease would drain off. The result was one of the best appetizers I've ever tasted!

Everyone loved these.  YUM.  I made the recipe as is.  WEAR GLOVES when cutting the jalapenos!  I wasn't thinking and my hands burned for HOURS even with every remedy I could find on the internet!

These are sooooo good! I love stuffed jalapenos but don't like the breaded or deep fried ones. My hubby can't quit telling EVERYONE about them, and wants me to make them for EVERYONE he tells. Next I want to try with fat free cr. cheese,fat free mayo, and turkey bacon. Gotta watch those calories! LOL

I have not made this yet, but similar ones.  To reduce "heat" make sure you cut out all the VEIN that the seeds grow on.  Makes the jalapenos very mild that way.

Didn't have the dried ranch packet, but substituted with a splash of ranch dressing, they were a great hit!  The only down side was just slightly greasy, but delicious none the less!

Love this recipe but I made one change. I never have any luck getting the bacon crisp enough in any recipe that is "bacon wrapped". So, after stuffing the peppers,, I topped them with imitation bacon bits and baked them at 400 for 10 minutes. You don't need to cook as long because you are not trying to crisp the bacon. Absolutely fantastic! Great flavor and the crunch of the bits puts them over the top. It also eliminates the bacon grease factor of the original recipe.

This was the best recipe I have tried on this site for jalapeno poppers not fried.  I basically followed the recipe with just a few changes.
1.  I have a jalapeno rack so I left them whole & cored them out, leaving a few seeds for heat.
2.  I used mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar because I didn't have any.
3.  To make the mixture thin enough to pipe into the jalapenos, I thinned the mixture out with a couple TBSP of milk.
4.  I put the mixture in a plastic baggy and cut the tip off to pipe it into the jalapenos.
5.  Then I topped each one with approximately a 1/4 piece of bacon folded up and placed on top.
6.  Cooked according to directions.

I have made this recipe more times than I would like to admit and have discovered how to get great finishes on it by using these tips: To get the bacon crispy: Buy thin bacon, or use a rolling pin and flatten out thick bacon. Mild cheddar cheese seems to get the best results. Also, if you do not have dry ranch salad dressing, you can make your own by using about a tablespoon (more or less, just equal amount of both) each of garlic and onion powder. I tend to taste it after stirring to make it just right.  Lastly, after mixing all the ingredients, I let them infuse for about 20 to 30 minutes before stuffing the peppers.

Made as is and they were awesome!  Make sure you use the broiler pan as the directions state.  If you use a baking sheet they will be sitting in grease.

As written, this recipe is just too greasy for my tastes. The filling was awesome and the peppers were perfect but the bacon was not good. It was under cooked and made everything a greasy mess. I made a few with just bacon bits on top and they turned out perfect. Next time I make these I will use about half the amount of bacon, cook it first and crumble it on top before baking to cut down on the grease.

I had jalapenos in the freeze from my in-laws garden so they were not as crispy as fresh jalapenos - so I ended up chopping them up and using it as a dip (all the same ingredients. Served with beer bread. Yummy yummy!

Yummy!  Didn't have ranch seasoning so omitted the mayo and just put 1/4 cup of ranch dressing.  Precooked bacon in skillet about halfway and blotted on paper towels. Baked on cookie cooling rack inside shallow lip pan.  Did remove all veins and seeds with melon baller, but luckily didn't have time to soak in cold water and they were not too hot at all.  Only took about 15 minutes precooking bacon.  We will definitely be making these again.  I think the ranch flavoring is what others I have tried have been missing.

Made these for a Superbowl Sunday gathering, and man are they ever a major hit! Love these, if I could give them 10 stars, I would. (Consider wearing gloves while de-seeding the peppers, though. My cuticles on on fire!)

Oh Boy are these good!  Since it was so cold out, I baked these in the oven on some cooling racks inside of a jelly roll pan.  That lets the greese drip down away from the snacks.  My family begs for these all the time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Wow, these were easy to make and were DELICIOUS.  I ran out of cheddar so used some mozza and it worked just fine.  I think I kinda overstuffed them because they kind of oozed out...but the combination of the cheese mixture, the jalepeno and the bacon was amazing.  They were even good cold the next morning!  Thanks!

Great recipe, everyone asks for it!  I use the precooked bacon just because it's easier and less greasy.  Remove all seeds and white part inside jalapeno.  If it's too hot soak jalapenos in ice water for 10 minutes, it will lose some of the heat.  Love it!

This is the sort of appetizer you just can't stop eating!!  They were just the right level of spicy too!  I would also suggest partially cooking the bacon before the final rolling step.  Really crisped it up nicely!  I had enough filling for 10 large jalapenos (each cut in half, so of course I had 20 halves) so I used the equal amount of bacon half pieces, which used a bit less than the pound.

Very tasty. I soaked halved and seeded jalapenos in ice water for 2 hours to mellow out the heat a bit. I substituted sour cream for mayo and used turkey bacon bits for a healthier, less greasy, treat. I also added two tablespoons of chopped cilantro. Delicious!

We loved these!  I eyeballed cream cheese, sharp cheddar cheese, powdered garlic and about 1/4 tsp. of  steak seasoning and stuffed the jalapenos.  Before I wrapped with a 1/2 slice of bacon, I boiled the bacon to remove the excess grease (thank you previous poster for this tip).  This process ensures that the bacon crisps up nicely.  Also, as an after thought, I made ranch dressing and put in a ramiken as a dipping sauce.  Excellent!!

I loved how easy and tasty this recipe is. My husband loved it. I personally added rice to the side dish to make it a full course meal.

Made these just to try them.  They are amazing.  I actually left a few seeds because we enjoy the spice.   Just the right bite with the cheese mixure.

These were fabulous--made them for a party and they were a big hit. Comments: 1) I used turkey bacon and it works better than pig bacon, IMO, because it has more "stretch" for the wrapping part and isn't as greasy. 2) I used shredded mexican cheese because I had that on hand and the flavor was wonderful. 3) I recommend getting big, firm jalapeno peppers--the bigger they are, the easier they are to de-seed. I used a melon baller to clean mine out and it worked great.  Super recipe!

I make these ALL of the time for parties. I always freeze a few extra for later! The ranch gives is a nice blend with the bacon and heat of jalepeno. Don't try to make without toothpicks. I tried it and they were very messy!

Awesome recipe. Made it exactly as the recipe says but I did decide to cook them on a broiler rack for drainage since some of the reviews said they were a little greasy. This was easier than pre-cooking the bacon at all and worked perfectly. Thanks for sharing!!

Enjoyed by all.  I used the last jalapenos from our garden and they were not hot at all...just good pepper flavor mixed with cheese and bacon...perfect.  I did grill this batch, but have baked them and been very satisfied with the taste also.  Excellent recipe!

I can't rave enough about these. While they aren't the healthiest, they taste fantastic! I cooked mine on the grill and they were awesome. My husband, daughter and I also ate them cold out of the fridge the next day, and they were still good! Next time I'm going to try lower fat versions of the original and still see if the flavor stays true.   My toothpicks kept breaking as I tried to stick them through, so I just wrapped the bacon tightly and didn't even use the toothpicks. I also soaked the peppers in water to kill the heat a bit, but next time I'm going to leave them as is to give them a little more bite!

This recipe was awesome, the only thing I did differently was use the pre-cooked bacon from oscar mayer. The bacon came out beautifully crisp. I would of taken a picture but hands would of been in the picture! The football fans loved them!! Thanx Mrs.H !!!

All that I have to say is YUM, YUM, YUM. These will become a staple on my football buffets. The only thing I did different was dipped them in bread crumbs before baking because I noticed that in my first batch, the cheese somewhat melted outside the pepper. The second batch, which was dipped, didn't have that problem and the taste really wasn't altered. Also, make sure you use medium sized peppers, otherwise you will not get the number of pepper/filling ratio.

Use Herb & Garlic Cream Cheese, fresh minded garlic and add Tex-Mex shredded cheese and stuff the peppers.  The best.

I used turkey bacon.  I laid one piece (half of a strip) on each pepper and didn't need the tooth picks.  Surprisingly, I didn't have any problems with the bacon falling off either.

Love these! Because some jalapenos are hotter than others I've gotten in the habit of either wearing gloves or boiling first to eliminate the burn on my hands after halving and seeding.

Very tasty, but a bit salty.  The bacon didn't get crisp but I had to take them out of the oven as the filling was melting out.  Looked a mess but tasted very good!

Wonderful!  Ingredients used as written.  From other comments I soaked the jalepeno peppers in ice water for a few hours and baked on a rack.  Fantastic taste! (We did not find them too salty.)

I made these but tweaked it by skewering the jalaeno (for my hubby) and banana peppers (for me) and hanging them from muffin tins- bacon got super crispy and a lot of the grease dripped out!!

These were very good but extremely salty.  I made half with bacon and half without.  The ones with bacon were to salty to eat.  I will make them again but I will reduce the amount of dressing mix.  Hopefully that will help.

They were definitely decent.  But they needed more flavor, some spice or something.  But they were something I'd definitely serve again with short notice.

Made this last year for New Year's Eve and was such a hit I'm making again this year.  I think the recipe is just the right balance of heat and flavor as is, but my group likes a lot of heat so I added some finely chopped jalepenos to the cream cheese mixture and some smoked paprika to add a little deepth to the flavor to balance the additional jalapenos.

a little on the greasy side but overall very good. I might cook bacon separately next time and top with crushed bacon for the grease issue.- after further playing around I make sure I use regular and not thick cut bacon.  I also half cook it and drain it well then wrap bacon around pepper and finish off... Awesome dish and after a couple of years I am now requested to make these for get-togethers

Baking on a broiler pan made all the difference. They were crispy all around. Everyone ate them up.

Super good! The only thing I did differently, because of the bacon I had - thick sliced, peppered. I precooked the bacon in the oven for about 20 minutes. I don't know if my bacon was too short/thick or my peppers too big or both. So I couldn't wrap the bacon around the pepper so I just layed the bacon on top of the peppers. Then I ran out of bacon so I wrapped a few in salami. They were really good. I will definitely make these again!

Yummy.  Too greasy, but I did not use a broiler pan where the grease would have gone through.

GREATEST APP OF ALL TIME! My husband planted 46 pepper plants so we ate these every night all summer. We left off the bacon and I took the seeds out so they are not hot at all. I craved these all winter long so we used this recipe in frozen jalapenos and cooked them in the oven or toaster oven. I took these to work and people raved about it and wanted the recipe! THANKS FOR THE PERFECT JALAPENO POPPER!!!!

I have made these and pass the recipe to my father who also has made these for many occasions...I followed recipe but I did cook them a little longer. I cook them in the oven on a cookie rack that sits on top a cookie sheet covered in foil so the grease isnt an issue. My dad likes to cook them on the grill. Either way they still taste great. Making them again for Thanksgiving appetizers!

I just made these for a football party we had, and they were a hit.  I always put a lot of time into making tasty-good hearty appetizers, but this particular recipe gave me the most rave reviews ever.  Two guys told me that it was one of the best things they've ever eaten.  My husband is on his way to the grocery store right now to buy more ingredients so I can make more for him today.  I followed the recipe perfectly.  THANK YOU for the great recipe, I plan to use this one often!  :)

I've made these many times and they are excellent.  I don't halve the jalapenos, just slit them.  I also omit the ranch dressing mix.

These are absolutely delicious!  I actually cooked them on the grill rather than baking and they turned out fabulous.  Next time though I think I will cut the garlic powder and ranch dressing mix in half because they overpower that great cream cheese flavor.  Definitely worth trying!

Mike LOVED them.  Personally, I would only give them 3.5 stars.  I found the taste very meaty (and I used turkey bacon!).  But, since they were such a hit, I'll be making them again.

These were delicious!  I mixed up the filling by cooking some sausage in a skillet, draining the grease and mixed in low fat vegetable cream cheese.  That's it...two ingredients for my stuffing.  I also found that using a whole slice of bacon worked better in my case.  I will be making these again, probably every Saturday for college game day!

These were very good but I thought they were just a little too salty. Next time I will omit the ranch dressing mix and add garlic powder and chopped green onions in its place.

I saved this recipe over a year ago and finally got around to making it due to some awesome jalapenos in my garden. I used a raised rack over a cookie sheet in the oven to alleviate the grease issue and it worked well. There were 5 of us and all of these disappeared in less than 10 minutes.

These made great finger foods for the party I had at my house.  At the end of the night there were pretty much all gone.  This recipe really makes a lot so I was surprised to see only two left on the place!  I did run out of bacon when I made these so I had made some without the bacon and people still thought they tasted great.  It was a good teaser as I brought the baconless ones out first and then the bacon ones came out and everywhere went wild!  Awesome recipe!

I had to change the recipe a little bit, because we do not eat bacon, so I just left it out. It turned out great! and it could pass as vegetarian dish now :)  I didn't have any Ranch dressing, so I skipped this one too. I did however substitute garlic powder for the frozen minced garlic by Dorot (which is pretty close to the fresh minced one) - I think it made a great twist to the recipe... I would advice to try it...  Beside that - we LOVED it!!! Thank you for sharing :)

These snacks had great flavor, but the bacon took quite a bit longer to cook than indicated.  I doubled cooking time and my guests still found the bacon to be slightly undercooked.  I would suggest broiling until bacon is browned.

I took these to a superbowl party this past Sunday, and they were a huge hit!  I was worried they would be too spicy for some of my friends, but they weren't very spicy at all.  They were worth the work.

WOW!  Tasty!  We loved them.  We have had him battered before, but never with the bacon wrapped around them.  Much nicer with the bacon!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  I need a "Family LOVES" recipe folder now after this one!

This was delicious, although I didn't totally follow the recipe...I just put veggie cream cheese with the cheddar, and skipped the mayo, ranch and garlic.  I used the broiler for about 5 mintues after baking for 20.

We made this for a tailgate and loved it - with two changes that we made. Instead of wrapping it in bacon, we cooked the bacon ahead of time, chopped it up and added it to the mixture that we stuffed the jalapeno's with. We also added a small slice of pepperjack cheese on top of each stuffed jalapeno as we grilled them. Delish!

SO DELICIOUS! Will definitely make again. DON'T use thick cut bacon though. I had to cook about 35 minutes for the bacon to get done. DO wrap your bacon all the way around the pepper and push your toothpick all the way through the pepper. I made a half recipe (just two of us) because it makes so much. If I made this for a party I would make the whole recipe and prep them ahead of time and refrigerate then pop into oven when the guests arrive. I'm sure they would be a hit with my friends.

Absolutely the best jalapeño poppers out there! I make them for every get together, they never last long and I am always asked for the recipe. I do bake them at 425 because it gets the bacon actually cooked through so it’s not rubbery. One 8 Oz cream cheese package never seems to be enough for that many poppers so I basically double the recipe, but don’t use two full ranch packets. I place one toothpick in each end of the bacon and ensure it goes all the way through the other side, otherwise it doesn’t hold well (I use thick cut bacon and slice in half). Perfect recipe!

Boiling the bacon first was an excellent idea. They turned out great. I used smaller homegrown jalapeños and had plenty of cheese left. I would do this recipe again in a heartbeat.

This is a hit at my house. I have made these poppers several times and the only other part that I modify is that I add seasonings to the cream cheese and add shredded sharp cheddar.

I made everything exactly the way it called for. Everyone loved them! I only did 4 stars because if you’re not used to working with so many peppers you should beware! I did not use gloves or a face mask. Jalapeños, who’d thought? My fingers got burnt from pitting by hand. After awhile I decided to blow my nose. My nose quickly began to feel on fire from the inside! I submerged my nose in milk after googling it. I washed my hands several times before touching my face. Nope! Didn’t work. Not even with dawn soap. I had to trash my contacts and suffer for almost an hour before the burning subsided from my face. My hands, well, they couldn’t withstand any heat or picking up stuff for the rest of the day. So 4 stars due to the lack of hazardous advice but the whole family loved them. Great recipe! I’ll make again but use extra precautions next time.

I made up a batch of filling and baked 8 poblano and 4 jalapeno halves. (That's all I could fit on the foil lined pan I used.) I wrapped the jalapeno halves and just set the half slice of bacon on the poblano halves. 
These things are really good. 
And I still have a shopping bag full of peppers I harvested before first frost . . .

We love theses. I cook mine on a rack to keep them out of the grease. They go fast a our church picnics. My daughter puts bacon pieces in her mixture and no longer wraps them. They are good too.

Thanks Mrs. Houston. Delicious as written, husband loved it, but I like things a little less salty. The second time I made these I subbed in light cream cheese, ranch dressing for the ranch mix and mayo, fresh grated sharp cheddar and added a couple of dashes of tabasco. As other people have said, use gloves when working with the jalapeños.Let the bacon get to room temperature so it wraps easily (sometimes I use a whole piece of bacon for each one - mmmmm, then no need for a toothpick!) I put the cream cheese ingredients etc. for the filling in a quart size ziplock, smoosh together, then snip off an end to fill the jalapeños. Use the broiler pan as directed so the fat drips away from the poppers and they get crispy. In my oven they took about 30 minutes. These are now in regular rotation for football games and holidays.

I only made a half batch - we'd give them a 5 star rating!  I pre-cooked the bacon in the oven so it was too crispy to wrap, I just laid it on the stuffed pepper before baking - the appearance was great and the flavor was awesome!  First time making jalapeno peppers and it was terrific!

There are many jalapeño popper type recipes but this one is the best I've found. Everyone who tries these knows there's is something different about them but can't ever put their fingers on what it is- it's the ranch element! These are slightly labor intensive just because of the jalapeño prepping but they are absolutely worth the work. These are great appetizers and even just as aside dish.

Made these from Jalopenos from our garden.  Everyone liked them.  Washed the Jalopenos for a milder taste.
Cooked for 20 minutes at 400, but will cook longer next time.  Bacon needed to be crisper.

Didn't try these because I don't like anything remotely spicy but those who did eat them loved them. Great recipe!

Best appetizer ever! These are gone the moment they arrive. Just make sure to strip the jalapeno seeds and veins so that they are not too spicy.

I made these for the Mr. and me and they were wonderful!  I did not add the garlic powder because I felt the the ranch had enough garlic in it already.  I also partially cooked the bacon so it would be crispy and not wiggly or greasy.  We did them up on the grill.  YUM!  Cannot wait to make these this summer at one our pool parties.  Definitely a Keeper!!!

This is the very best jalapeno snack I have ever had or made.  So good that it should be illegal.  Thanks for sharing it with us.

THIS IS THE BEST! Ranch powder & seasonings set this recipe apart from all the others! I've done this in the oven AND out on the charcoal grill which is even better! .... Taking this to a new level, I'm going to try these in our smoker! YUM!  We love this recipe the best!!! :)

This is a very good recipe, although a pain to make. It tastes just as good if you add chopped bacon (or easier; bacon bits) to the cream cheese mixture. Also, you can put the filling in a ziploc bag and cut a small hole in the corner to pipe the filling into the peppers.  I do put the peppers in a sink of ice-cold water and make sure I get every seed out to keep from burning my  families mouths!

It was awesome, but I used cream cheese instead of mayo and prosciutto instead of bacon. Just a little less fattening.

These are delicious with the exception of one thing. Unless you are willing to take the time and remove the seeds with a tooth pick leaving as much of the rib as possible there is no bite to the jalapenos. Too get around that I add finely minced Serrano peppers, with seeds and ribs, to taste to the stuffing mixture. They come out with the same great taste but good and hot. I bake mine on a wire mesh rack to let the grease drip off. Yes some does get into the pepper but that just adds to the flavor. The 2 of us have had just these for dinner and had no guilt about doing so.

Very good, but I deleted the garlic powder, and saved some of the shredded cheese aside on a plate and rolled the cream cheese mixture in the pepper through it.  Then I stuck them in the freezer for a few minutes before wrapping the bacon and putting in the oven to help keep the cheese from melting off the peppers.  Next time I think I will partially pre cook the bacon so that it browns better, I don't like floppy bacon.

This recipe is so good that I get asked for it literally every family get together. It does take longer to prep then the instructions say, usually around an hour. And because it takes so long to get these ready I usually pre-make them up to the cooking point and then put them in the fridge. This does make them a little more mushy than if you cooked them right away, but they still taste awesome! I also render some of the bacon fat first so cooking does't take as long. Overall this is one of my favorite recipe:) Thanks!

I don't think people understand just how good this recipe is.  Whenever I take it somewhere new, I tell people that I'm making jalapeno poppers and they always tell me about a recipe they do.  All I can do is smile at them while in my head I think, "they've never had THESE before!"  It never fails...when I bring them for people to have, they all say they are the best they've ever had.  I have even had more than one person say it is the best thing they've ever eaten!

Like somebody else said, soak the cut and seeded peppers in ice water for 45 minutes and it takes out the heat but leaves all the flavor.  Also, instead of wrapping the bacon around the jalapeno, I just lay a slice right on top lengthwise.  That cooks the bacon more evenly.  The other thing I do is to cook these on a smoker.  I put a wire rack down with a layer of foil underneath it to keep the bottom from burning.  It's way better than in the oven.

These are so good I made an account just so I could review them.  Try it and you'll know what all the fuss is about.

The flavor is great (though I did add ranch seasoning to mine), the bacon didn't cook on the underside really. I also put mine under the broiler for 2 minutes after baking, just to crisp up the bacon a bit.

This was absolutely delish!  I did not have an issue with grease because it dripped through the broiler pan.  My husband and I love spicy foods and this totally fit the bill!  The fresh jalapenos still had a little crunch to them.  Perfect.  Even really good reheated the next day!  So much better than the over-breaded, soggy, flavorless frozen kind.  Mrs. Huston, we love you!

Delicious!  A party hit!  The filling is very tasty.  I did some in the oven and some on the BBQ.  The BBQ gives the bacon a delicious flavor and browns it up nicely!

This is amazing just like it is. My husband and I could not get enough. I am definietly going to keep making these and I will make them for our next family get together because I know everyone will enjoy them. They are very easy to make and you can use the cheese mixture to just spread in a cracker if you wanted. Thank you so much for this recipe!

I made this dish for my family's food contest this year and I won!!! They were delicious and everyone was raving about them. The only change I made is that instead of baking them in the oven, I smoked them out on the grill for about 2 hours. I think it gave them a very rich smoky flavor and helped cut the spiciness of the peppers. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking to impress their friends at a party :)

This was a good recipe, but thought using a full packet of Dry Ranch Salad Dressing Mix would be too salty, so I used a 1/2 of the package. Even with 1/2 package, it was too salty...Next time I think I would only use a teaspoon of it, for flavor. Otherwise, the recipe was really tasty.

Outstanding! They are time consuming to make, but so good. I thought the ranch flavor was a little too strong, so I might cut back a bit in the future.

Really good!  I like my bacon crispy so I microwaved it 2 minutes before wrapping--I could've even done it longer. A word to the wise:  I put the peppers in ice to de-zip them a bit.  I think I left them in too long--they tasted more like regular peppers.  Overall, we enjoyed these a lot.

These are awesome! I took other suggestions, and have tried using flavored cream cheese, and I always boil the bacon first so it gets nice and crispy in the oven. I don't use toothpicks, I just tuck the loose ends under each jalapeno, so when it cooks it hardens that way. At our family cookouts, they are always asking me to make this, even family members who 'hate peppers'. I soak them overnight in an ice bath after seeding and halving, this may or may not do anything; I don't like spicy jalapenos so I do this and always buy large jalapenos. They turn out mild for those of us who don't like super spicy. Also, I always wear vinyl gloves when prepping them so not to get the oils on my hands. Great recipe!!

Whole family came over to celebrate the start of hockey season and I made up batch of these.  Of everything that I made this was the first thing gone, and I had to buy more ingredients so I could make another batch.  The combination of everything takes the bite out of the jalapenos and makes for an excellent snack, or in my case dinner.

I used this site's Beer Dip for the filling.  They were very good, but most of the filling melted out of the pepper.  I will not cook them as long next time.

This is a very tasty snack. I made it for a party I went to and it was gone in no time. I did make a change. I used turkey bacon and it was just as tasty without all the grease. I also used sweet red peppers as well as the jalapeno.

this is a great recipe because you can change it up so it doesn't get boring. i'll do half Jalapenos and half red bell peppers. get the sweet and spicy going on. i also use minced garlic in EVOO over garlic powder, it gives it more flavor. you can cut the mayo in half and use sour cream for the other half. add things like cumin, or pepper jack cheese. i'll throw them on the grille as well to get the smoke from the wood. GREAT recipe and hail the creater.

We made them this year for a New Years party and they FLEW off the plate!  If you dont like them burning hot (which I dont) make sure to get all the seeds out when you slice the peppers - we even rinsed them in cold water afterwards to make sure they were all gone.  DELICIOUS!  I sitll got a few "frisky" bites but was able to eat about 10 of them! This is a keeper!

I LOVE this recipe.  I have pretty much been making it for every gathering I have attended and they are a bit.  I like that they aren't too hot to not appreciate how GREAT it tastes.
