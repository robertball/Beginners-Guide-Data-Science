Followed this recipe to a 'T,' which I believe is necessary to rate it properly. Absolutely perfect 'as is,' no changes to the ingredients. Just a suggestion for prep -- there's no need to marinate in two steps, just combine everything in one glass bowl (plastic absorbs smell) or Ziploc bag overnight. If you don't have a dehydrator, you can use skewers and hang them from one end in the oven at 150F for 4-5 hours. I also boil the leftover marinade for at least 10 min to rid of bacteria or until desired consistency and use it for BBQ sauce on beef, chicken or pork. Why waste it? Everyone loves this jerky, so it's the only one I make. Great recipe! :)

My husband used venison instead of beef.  It turned out great, although I didn't read the instructions thoroughly and mixed together all the ingredients listed.  I didn't cook the marinade in a saucepan either. I just put everything in a big ziploc and let the meat soak overnight.    My family and his family all thought it's the best jerky recipe we've found.

Excellent stuff!  I improvised slightly: first, I got home and realized I had no brown sugar. I did, however, have Sweet & Low Brown (brown sugar substitute). I used the recommended conversion amount for the sweet & low.  I also used low sodium soy sauce - but ran a little short on the amount.  I use Wright's liquid smoke - and it's really REALLY strong, so I only used about half the amount.  I substituted Penzey's Spices Black & Red Spice (black pepper & spicy cayenne blend) for some of the pepper too. Results?  Amazing!  The fake brown sugar worked really well, the smokey flavor is definitely there, and the Black & Red Spice gives it an added kick.  Can't forget the pepper flakes!

Definitely will make this again, and can't wait to share this with my friends!

Parents have an organic farm and we got a half a cow for Christmas... there's no way between the two of us we can eat that much meat, so I recently purchased a dehydrator and this is the first recipe I tried.  I feel no need to search for additional recipes.  This is perfect!  Purchased mason jars and will make custom lables filled with this jerky to give as gifts... if there is any left :)  Thank you!

If you don't have a food dehydrator, this can be made in the oven too.  Just lay the meat on cooling racks on top of foil-lined baking sheets and bake on 150 degrees for 5-6 hours. Open the door every now and then to let steam escape. So easy!

This was so yummy.  I've made it twice in the past month.  I tried to follow the exact recipe but had a problem with the onion powder in my cupboard.  I ended up using minced onion, it was delicious.  Oh yeah, only used 4 tbls liquid smoke too. I plan to make it a lot.  Thanks Dixychik!

This can easily be the best jerky that you have ever tasted. Necessary changes: marinate at least 24 hours in the fridge, and use too much marinade (too little will leave too little flavor). A few options to try: cut the meat cross-grain (this allows for tenderness and flavor soaking), use reduced sodium soy, gourmet teriyaki (make sure it contains some type of wine), use any lean cut of meat (typically some kind of round/top round), and finally the pepper flakes and spices should coat the meat before marinating.

The jerky was perfect!  I tried the marinade with turkey legs and chicken thighs and YUM!  The meat melts off the bones!  I'm making it again today and I'm going to fill my smoker with chicken, turkey, and short ribs. Delicious!

This recipe has a wonderful taste! WOW! It makes my mouth water even before I start to chew. The honey gives it just enough sweatness to balance the hot. It is our new favorite jerky recipe! Wonderful!

This was not good! I'm not sure how it got such high reviews. I followed the recipe exactly. The end result was slightly sticky jerky with a caramelized coating. It was more of "spicy beef candy" than a traditional jerky. Also, this make a LOT of marinade...you could use a lot more than the recommended 1lb of meat for the amount of marinade the recipe yielded.

great taste, we doubled the recipe and used it on 6 lbs of goose breasts, it would taste every bit as good on deer. Delicious. I omitted the liquid smoke and placed in the smoker with hickory pucks. 4 hrs at 160 degrees worked great.

Excellent Recipe.  Makes really exceptional jerky. Though after using the recipe a dozen times or so I discovered that you don't need to spread the dry ingredients on the meat directly. Instead I put all the spices into a coffee grinder, ground them into a fine powder, then just mixed them into the marinade.  I should note that I marinade considerably longer than the recipe recommends, at least a full day, and I use a Foodsaver Vacuum seal jar.

Thanks for the recipe - we all loved it.  Good flavorful meat - not just seasonings!!!  I used a 4.5 lb bottom round roast, which trimmed down to about 4 lbs.  Once it was semi-frozen, I sliced it with an electric knife WITH the grain, not across (if you want it chewy not dissolve-in-your-mouth). I doubled the sauce recipe, but even that was WAY too much - next time I'll use the extra half as steak marinade.  I ground the peppercorns and crushed red pepper in my coffee mill.  I put tin foil in the bottom of the oven and sprayed Pam on cake cooling racks so the marinade would be easy to clean up.  It made 3 racks full.  I cooked in my oven at 150 degrees for 4 hours.  Worked well, but good luck leaving it alone long enough for it to dry!

This is a fantastic jerky recipe. I did add a few more ingredients to spice it up a bit after the first batch turned out a little too mild for my taste. First off, I added red pepper flakes to the spice rub as well as to the marinade. I also let the marinade simmer for a couple minutes just to give the peppers a chance to steep. I also added about a tablespoon of Thai chili garlic paste. And just for good measure I tossed in a few dashes of Tabasco. The result was a more flavorful, spicier jerky. Not flaming hot, but a little more bite than the original. This recipe is a FANTASTIC sweet and tangy base for jerky. I would also recommend beginning your drying process in the oven at around 300 degrees until the steam evaporates, then transfer to the drying racks. Getting the meat up to 160 degrees or so kills bacteria and speeds the drying. Then you move it to your dehydrator for another 3-4 hours (depending on how thick your slices are). I highly recommend this recipe. Nice work DIXYCHIK.

I totally agree with Cat. I followed this recipe as is & it came out great. I tried three others on this site for a comparison & this is the best. I found at my grocery they slice beef for braising & it is perfect for this recipe, if you can find it, try it. Spearing the meat with a toothpick & hanging it from the top rack is a perfect way to dry the meat, just make sure you place some tinfoil on the bottom rack to catch the liquid. Delicious!

This is the first jerky recipe I've ever tried and I wasn't disappointed with the results. Perfect balance of sweet (but not too sweet) and hot (but not too hot). Leaves behind a little bit of heat on your tounge but not enough to need that huge glass of water standing by. It's the best tasting jerky I've ever had. WAY better than the store bought variety. I followed the recipe exactly as written. 5 tbsp of liquid smoke scared me but you can't even taste the liquid smoke in the finished product. It just adds that great jerky scent that gets your taste buds going. An electric knife is a must have. I bought one for the purpose of making this recipe and I can't imagine having to slice the meat without one. One 5oz. bottle of soy sauce = 2/3c. No need to measure, just dump the bottle into the sauce pan. I used one 20oz can of crushed pineapple and strained it to get the pineapple juice. That yielded approximately 1 cup of juice so now I have enough pineapple juice to make another batch of jerky OR maybe I'll use the leftover juice and pineapple to make Acini di Pepe (another great recipe from this site). Talk to your butcher about the different types of meats that are popular for making jerky. You're not limited to one specific cut (some are leaner than others). Your butcher knows what's best. All in all, GREAT recipe I will be using A LOT. I may never have to put my dehydrator away again!!  THANKS!!

I have made jerky for 20 years. This recipe is pretty good. After reading the comments; I decided to make some minor tweaks. First; I doubled the pineapple juice and simmered it to concentrate the sweetness. Then, I added a ¼ cup of orange juice along with the other ingredients ( I use a smoker so, I omitted the liquid smoke). I doubled the dry ingredients / coated the meat and let it marinade for 4 hours. Then I added the liquid marinade and let it set over night. I don’t pound the meat before smoking; I like the big chew. “This step is essential” before smoking / dehydrating; take meat and out of the marinade and place it on a towel. Place another towel on top to absorb the moisture. Then, put the meat on a rack (uncovered) for an hour or until the color turns grey. This helps the curing process and stops the marinade / seasoning from exiting the meat when smoking dehydrating.  I hope you find this hint helpful!

Okay this was a big hit.  I bought a dehydrator just for this recipe.  I ended up making 4lbs the first day which doesn't end up being much.  I made some extra spicy with heavy red pepper to send to my brother.  I doubled the marinade since I planned on doubling the meat but it was soooo not necessary.  I had so much marinade that I am on my 8th lb of beef!  It was such a hit and I had all of the marinade already I figured why the heck not!  Great gifts.  I have some marinating right now and instead of using red pepper flakes I think I am going to use dried Jalapeno flakes that I have.  I also made a plain batch with no spice.. This recipe is defintely a keeper!  I don't think it is sweet at all.  Maybe next time I would cut back a bit on the liquid smoke.

I've been making jerky amongst other dehydrated foods for years now. After a little searching I found this one a few years back. I love sweet and hot jerky, and with a little tweeking I was able to improve upon it for my taste anyway. I added a little more brown sugar, used crushed pineapple on top of pineapple/ orange juice and cooked it down to a little thicker consistency. All in all a terrific recipe and just the kind I was looking for. This time I used venison and it was the best batch to date. I would recommend this to anyone who likes sweet/ teriyaki jerky... the pineapple really does set it off!!! Thanks for a really superb recipe!!!

Perfect. Only next time I will cut my meat thicker.  My thicker pieces were a bit more tender than the thin pieces.  I also marinaded my meat for 24 hours before drying and it took about 16 hrs to dry.  My dryer doesnt have those fancy blower elements in it, so it takes longer for my food to dry.

I made this as a gift and the recipient liked it, but I was not as impressed. I think I wanted it sweeter and spicier and less salty and garlicy. It was edible, but not my favorite.

Love, love, love this recipe! I did make a few changes. I use Round Roast instead of steak and coat the cut meat with salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder by eye. I don't cook the other ingredients in a sauce pan, I just add them together and toss the meat in. Also, I add some hot sauce to the mixture, about a teaspoon (way more for my boyfriend though. Maybe two tablespoons), but the longer you let it sit the hotter it gets!  I also let it soak overnight in the fridge, at least six hours, but I prefer 12. :) I don't sprinkle any more seasoning on mine, but my boyfriend adds cracked red and black pepper, as well as cajun seasoning to his before drying.

This is the best jerky that i have ever made or purchased anywhere!  Very flavorful with just a small bite of heat at the end.  I make a large batch every couple months and it never seems to last around the house for more than a couple days.  My extended family and co-workers are always bugging me to make more.

Definitely give it a try.  You won't be disappointed!

Ok, I love jerky, and have made this twice now, not a fan at all.   I usually make it sweet so I thought the hot might make it pop a little, nope.  By all the reviews, it is prob just me, but had to write a review. Sorry to those who like it.

This is a wonderful recipe.  LIke others I just added the spices to the liquid ingredients.  Freezing the meat and using a meat slicer is really the way to go.  All slices are nice and even.  I used 15 pounds of London Broil and 6 times the marinade recipe.  There seemed to be plenty of marinade.  Thanks for sharing the reciped.

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it!!!  Followed the recipe exactly, but changed the cooking method. We are using elk and have made 6 batches so far.  I take the sliced up elk and boil it for about 3 minutes.  I then drain it and put it into the marinade immediately and marinate it for 3 hours.  And then dehydrate it.  It only takes 2 hours to dry this way.  EVERYONE in my family loves it.  Thanks for sharing!

We used this recipe to make deer jerky.  We actually ground the meat and then added the marinade.  This was a lot of marinade and we used it for about 3 1/2 pounds of ground meat.  We let it marinate for about 4 hours and then used a jerky gun and a dehydrator.  It has a wonderful flavor and we will definitely be making it again.  Thanks!

I put a little cayenne pepper, and a big scoop of chili garlic sauce which made it spicy and real juicy!! it is smoky but if you store in a big bag for a day or two the flavor will just amaze you :) I put in the oven on 170 degrees and used tooth picks to hold up the meat on the rack for 4-5 hours and was very juicy. I also used London Broil and had Ralphs my grocery store slice up the meet real thin and I got about 3Ibs. I noticed when I changed the servings it was way to much and could of made another 5-6Ibs more if I wanted with what I had. word of advice, stay with the recommended amount with 4 servings if you are going to make more.

We raise beef cattle so I'm always looking for the "better" jerky recipe. Have tried many and this is probably the best. Marinated short cut rump and london broil steaks (about 5 lbs. total) in a double batch of the exact recipe and had enough left over for another 5 pounds of meat. Think I'm done looking for jerky recipes! Thanks!

By far the best jerky I have ever had!!! I doubled the recipe and it all disappeared within a couple of days, everyone loved this addicting flavor! The thing I like about it most is that it's like all jerky flavors added into one. I'm always torn between teriyaki jerky, or smoked jerky, or peppered jerky and have a hard time deciding which one to buy, but this is like all 3 added into one! It's the king of jerkies in my book!

This is the first and last jerkey recipe that I will use! We did make a minor adjustment to the recipe though. Pineapple juice concentrate is 1 of the main ingredients in terriyaki sauce, so we didn't feel like we needed to add the extra juice that it called for. Otherwise we followed the recipe as stated and it came out unbelievable! We were going to follow our dehydrator's insructions and dehydrate for 1-2 days(Ronco 5 tray), but it was done WAY before that, so we will def follow the suggested drying time here.

(2006)I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!! We used this as a brine/marinade for a turkey. It ended up in the mixture for 36 hours but it was fabulous!!!!!! This is a definate keeper for our recipe files. (2009) This is an update for my original review. We have since used this recipe on venison & wild boar with terrific results. We have also used it as a marinade for chicken (whole and we beer-canned them with more marinade in the can), goose (roasted in the oven), and a fresh unsmoked ham. All were absolutely delish!!

I have used allrecipes for years, but have never felt compelled to write a review before now. I made this jerky yesterday with a mixture of venison and beef, and it is easily, hands-down the best jerky I have ever had. The family agrees! I mixed the spices in with the marinade instead of doing the rub, marinated overnight, then into the dehydrator. We tripled the meat - the recipe above for the marinade can easily handle three pounds of meat. So addictive, we're starting another batch tonight. Perfect balance of flavours, and the smell is heavenly. Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe! If there was a Nobel Prize for jerky, it would be yours!(lol)

I was marinating a steak in balsamic dressing and didn't get to cook it in a day or two so I decided to make jerky.  I put the beef strips on a grilling rack; the pan was lined with aluminum and I sprinkled with ground black pepper.  I cooked the beef on the racks at 150 degrees for 5-6 hours. I will definitely use this again when I am pushing the envelope on a steak.

I bought myself a food dehydrator this last spring intending to use it for the most part for the extra fruits and herbs I grow but my husband asked me to try to make some jerkey since he loves it and the store bought stuff is so expensive. I searched for a recipe to try and came across this one. Don't bother with heating the liquids and sugar or seasoning the meat w/dry ingredients, just mix everything except the meat in a bowl and stir well, the sugar dissolves really easily and you don't have to wait for the marinade to cool down. I didn't use the worcestershire sauce because it has fish ingredients and instead used extra teriyaki sauce and balsalmic vinegar and we love garlic so I used and extra 1/2 tsp. Let me tell you it was a hit! On my second batch I used a tiny bit more onion powder, black pepper and red pepper flakes than called for so we could have a bit more heat to balance the sweet. I've made this a dozen times now and have given it out as gifts, made it to take camping and sent some with my husband to work and everybody who's tried it has raved about it. The recipe makes way more liquid than needed for 1lb of meat, I've used this recipe to marinade 3lb of beef and it was fine. Put the marinade in a large ziplock bag, or divide between two depending on how much meat you have, squeeze out the air and let marinade over night for the most flavorful jerkey you've ever had. I not going to bother searching for another jerkey recipe, this is a keeper!

I have to tell you BEST VENISON JERKY EVER!!!  But I want to share my tweeks.  For starters I used one whole back strap.  But also Instead of pinaple juice I used coca cola I doubled the batch because I had 2 1/2 pounds of venison.  I also used a whole tbs of fresh course ground pepper and instead of red pepper flakes I used a better hot pepper blend mine was homemade but anything hot with flavor!  Soaked for 48 hrs. Smoked on a charcoal smoker with cherry wood.  I also used vernors in the water bowl.  Like I said best jerky I've ever had!!!!

Perfect recipe!  A lot of ingredients but well worth it! One tip that I do, put everything in a 1 gallon zip lock bag with all the air pushed out to marinade.  Every few hours I mix the bag without ever opening it.  This way produces a more even flavoring and is much less messy! When I am done, I take the meat out and throw away the messy bag.

This was a great recipe. Definitely a keeper! I made it exactly as stated, next time I'll probably cut back on the liquid smoke, I think it might have been too much.

Turned out wonderful.  I marinated it all overnight... Didn't have a dehydrator so I did it on a sheet pan with a cooling rack above it for ventilation at 150deg for 2 hours and 200deg for another hour to hour and a half.  It was wonderful.  I also didn't use liquid smoke.  It is so tender.  SO GOOD!

I absolutely love this recipe.  This was our first time making beef jerky and it came out delicious!  The only thing we didn't add was the red pepper flakes.  Thank you!

Nice one! I followed exactly - but cut back on the liquid smoke a bit and used about a tablespoon of Sriracha Thai chile and garlic sauce in place of the red pepper flakes - you can't have jerky without the all important spicy element. It went perfectly with the teriyaki/pineapple flavor. It beats Alton's recipe!

This was my first attempt at making jerky, and wow, this was great!  Might have a bit more kick than my dd will like so next time I'll leave red chili flakes off half the batch.  Also, you can easily double the beef and not adjust the amount of marinade.  I had waaaaaaay too much when I doubled everything.  Thanks!

This is the first jerky recipe I tried with my new dehydrator, and it was amazing!  Love the little bit of sweet, balanced with the little bit of heat.  And the marinade was so great, I think I'll try this with some other meats to BBQ.  Thank you for the great recipe!  I'll be making this all the time!

This recipe is fantastic!  I substituted regular vinegar for the balsamic to make it cheaper, and I added 1/4 cup of Bourbon I had sitting around.  Additionally, I added half a teaspoon of salt to the dry spices.

Great jerky recipe! It was gone in about a week (and I made a triple batch). The only change I made was to decrease the smoke flavoring by about 1-1/2 tablespoons. I had the butcher slice the meat for me and I made it in the dehydrator. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe. I made five pounds of beef jerky last weekend and its all gone. Everybody I gave a sample to, just loved it. I'm making myself another batch today for myself. The only thing I did differant was unstead of useing liquid smoke, I smoked it with alder in my smoker. I recommend this recipe for anyone. Good Job.

Excellent flavour, I used with a lean beef and sprinkled with crushed black pepper before drying. Very tasty even though I chickened out on the amount of liquid smoke and only added about a 3rd of what was called for. Have already had to make 2 batches to keep up with demand.

I tried recipe twice, first time I used beef, it was very good and tasty I added a few shakes of jalapeno hot sauce along with red pepper flakes. Very good.  2nd. time it was tried the recipe got altered a little and used ground beef, and shot it into dehydrator, with Jerky shoot gun and made round sticks instead of flat pcs.  Added more dry spices and little less on wet ingredients.  I didn't have to dehydrate only about 1/2 the time it also was really good.  Thanks again .P. Martin.

I am a beef jerky addict.  I found this recipe to be an EXCELLENT base recipe and for that reason I am rating it 5 stars.  Don't misunderstand, It's absolutely fantastic and yummy in it's own rite just as it is.  I too marinade at LEAST 24 hours.  You can make this recipe and you will be very happy with the flavors.  I, however, like my jerky SPICY.  I add several additional ingredients to make it my own with the right amount of spice that I love so much.  I'm talking Carolina Reapers or Ghost Peppers.  One ingredient I add seems to give it some richness/depth/body, about 5 heaping spoonfuls of Chili Garlic Sauce (Note:  I do 5 pounds of meat at a time.)  I put the dried chili flakes into a coffee bean grinder and pulverize them into a powder.  It really distributes the spice throughout. (And you don't find little flakes all around your house.)  An immersion blender mixes in the garlic and onion powders well which tend to clump in the liquid.  I'm lucky enough to have a store nearby that will slice my meat super thin for me which is most of the work (I use bottom round sliced cross-grain) and a 5-drawer dehydrator.  It can dry 2-1/2 lbs. at a time.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.  Whether you alter or use as is, you will love this recipe.  
I'm making 20 lbs. at a time now.  It's basically a 3-day commitment.

I have smoked jerky for 15 years and have tried many recipes. After reading the reviews; I decided to try the recipe. However; instead of using pineapple juice I used 1 can of frozen concentrated pineapple juice. Pineapple juice is a natural meat tenderizer and it breaks up the chewy fiber in the meat. Using concentrated vs. juice will give you the real sweet taste of pineapple. Also, I added crushed pepper flakes / sprinkled over the meat before it went to the smoker. It adds heat to the jerky so you get the heat and sweet taste. Basically, I used everything in the recipe except I added concentrate vs. juice and added additional red pepper flakes after marinating the steak. The overall taste of the jerky was excellent and friends that try all of my different types of jerky liked this one the best!

I added more red pepper flakes to make spicier. It was absolutely delectable. I also made some without the red pepper flakes for my husband because he doesn't like spicy. It's the best jerky that we have tried I highly recommend it. Oh I also added an extra half cup of pineapple juice.

Followed the recipe exactly. After marinating for 4 hours I took out 1/2 the meat to dehydrate. Once that batch was done drying I made the rest and had people taste test them to see if marinating them longer (18h) made a difference.  It did not.  It was all fantastic!  

Thanks for sharing!  I have my next batch in the fridge marinating now :)

This recipe is great! Like others, I cut back about 50% on the liquid smoke. I also added a little bit of maple syrup and honey. Very impressed with this recipe. One of the best beef jerky's I've had!

Great flavor.  I used Wright's concentrated liquid smoke and only needed one capful instead of 5TBSP!  I also added a dash of Siracha sauce and substituted canned diced pineapple (all I had) and some minced onion for the onion powder.

I loved this recipe!! Instead of heating it to melt the brown sugar I just stirred it in a bowl until dissolved and put everything into a bag with the meat. It was FABULOUS! A big hit, I even made a "vegetarian" version with some fake "steak" strips because my mother is a vegetarian.

Followed the recipe to a tee.  I was nervous about the vinegar being overpowering, but gotta say this came out very good.  One of the best soy sauce based recipes out there.

Made this with venison and just put everything in a plastic bag in the fridge for about 11 hours. It was delicious. Made some more hot with the red pepper flakes on top for the adults and not so hot for the kids. Everyone loved it! Will definitely make more soon!!

There aren't enough adjectives for how great this recipe is! No need to bookmark any other jerky recipe, this is it! Added Hot cayenne pepper and skipped the liquid smoke. Couldn't wait for it to marinade, so took the smaller pieces, seasoned them in the dry rub, quickly basted them in the marinade and chucked them straight in the oven. Marinaded the bigger pieces for the next day and even made a third batch after that. The neighbors were lining up to eat it.... Make sure you make A LOT if you want some for yourself!

Made exactly according to directions.  Everyone loved it!  I did make a small portion without the red pepper flakes for those who don't like spicy.

This recipe is outstanding, and highly recommend!  I altered it a bit the last time I made, added a little more terriyaki sauce/glaze, more pepper flakes, and used orange/pineapple juice, come out awesome!!  Had numerous requests to sell from friends, neighbors, and family!!  YUMMY!!!  Can't wait to make it again!!!

Made this exactly as suggested, it was excellent. I did divide the pepper flakes at the end to only half the jerky so my son could eat it too. I loved the contrasting flavors and it was really tender and flavorful. I will be using this recipe again. Thank-you.

I cut the liquid smoke and brown sugar in half to accommodate my family's tastes.  The meat had a great taste.  I saved the marinade from yesterday   and plan to put more meat in it today.  I will let this batch marinate for at least 5-6 hours and will add more pepper flakes to heat things up a bit more.  Wish I had a smoker!!!

I got a food dehydrator for Christmas last year and haven't done much with it. The other day, we decided to try to make beef jerky and found this recipe. I don't think I need to look anywhere else - this recipe is great! Tastes like "professional" jerky you might buy at the store or smokehouse.

this is fantastic!!  I was surprised at the reviewer who didn't think it smelled good while dehydrating because my entire family kept begging to know when it would be done!  The seasoning on this is just right - no to sweet, not to spicy - the perfect combination of both for a jerky.

i have to hide this from my boyfriend or the kids won't get any when they come visit! i use a dehydrator overnight and it's perfect! i also add some of JIM GOODE'S BBQ RUB to it as it makes my ribs sooo tender! don't skimp on the pineapple juice, the enzymes help to break down the meat. SOOO GOOD!

I didn't have pineapple juice, so I added 1/3rd cup molasses instead.  Also added some extra pepper flakes for a little more heat.  1 lb of meat took 4 hrs. in the dehydrator at 155°f.  Came out excellent

i omitted the liquid smoke,doubled the ground pepper and instead of the pineapple juice,i went with half apple juice and half honey.I smoked for 20 minutes with applewood chips and then put in the oven.it was the best jerky i have ever had.just incredible.I want to take the 5 tbsp of liquid smoke and use 5 tbsp of some other liquid that would compliment this recipe.Im a chef so i love to figure this stuff out.I will think of something.i was thinking of using a nice ice wine,something not too sweet.or maybe just 1/2 spicy bbq sauce and half water(2.5 tbsp of each)i think that would work great!i just made ot again,this time with the original recipe,it is better when you smoke the meat,but the taste was not all that different,stil.......SHAZAM!!!!awesome stuff.i bought a 18 pound roast and have made about 4-5 pounds of jerky.should last a while(doubt it!)

This is a great recipe!  It has a wonderful sweet flavor, but does not have an odd after taste that teriyaki jerky often does.  I kicked up the red pepper flakes the second time around as I like alittle more heat.  This recipe works well with both venison and beef. Marinating longer is better!!

Very, very good. I cut the liquid smoke in half but to each their own. The time varies depending on thickness and how many racks you use at a time. I also found my self slicing the meat too thin. I am trying tri-tip on the next batch. Will make again often.

What a great recipe! This was so wonderful and easy! The only thing I learned from the first time making this is not to leave it in the dehydrator for 5 hours...way too long. The second batch was perfect at 3 1/2 hours. This recipe will be a definte keeper! Thanks!

It’s fantastic! I put the meat in the freezer for approx. 45 minutes and then cut...it makes it much easier to slice methodically. Rock on!

Must need to marinate more than the 3 hours specified. Very little flavor in the finished product. If I make it again I will marinate overnight.

Fantastic recipe. Made a few revisions to bring out more flavor
-Replaced pineapple juice with one cup fresh pineapple (or frozen, they both worked great)
-Added 2 diced jalapeno's and 2 Pablano's, both with seeds

I blended the pineapple and peppers then added to the remaining ingredients.

The flavor was very good - the pineapple came through just perfectly. This quickly became the goto for my family. It's somewhat spicy, but not overpowering. I like spice and will likely add at least one more next time

Great recipe love the flavor. I would recommend using a little less liquid smoke so that it doesn't over power the rest of the flavors. Other then that this is differently my go to for a sweet and hot jerky!

First time ever making jerky and I doubled the batch right off the back.  Excellent turnout.  Made it in a hot air fryer at 160 for 6 hours.  Gave to a few jerky experts for taste and texture test and they were wowed by it.  Thanks.  Make more today.

I totally screwed up and read the directions off another recipe, ended up throwing everything together cold and marinated for about 15 hrs, removed the meat from the marinade and placed in dehydrater, no towelling off, took about 5.5 hrs (cabellas unit) on high (160f).  
  I used eye of round loin from Costco.  Anyway it all worked out in the end, probably the best I’ve made to date.  
  I had 5 lbs of meat after trimming the fat, multiplied the recipe by 5...WAY TOO MUCH MARINADE!!, next time I’ll maybe start at double the recipe for 5 lbs... live and learn...

This is my GO TO beef jerky recipe. I make it exactly as the recipe shows - and believe that is important in the rating of a recipe. Nothing needs to be changed - it is perfect as is. My kids friends actually request this jerky. Simple and tasty.

I made this and it was fantastic! I was concerned about the liquid smoke, as this was all I smelled for the next couple days! But, it turned out great! I did add the peppers as I like hot, for the meat I used a tri tip trimmed of fat and frozen for easy slicing. Otherwise, I stayed true to recipe. I will be making it again this weekend, because it’s about gone!

Made this for a weekend at the lake with multiple families. I doubled the recipe. Made it in the oven at the lowest setting  ( my oven goes down to 170 F) with a ball of aluminum foil to keep the door open a crack. Took about 4 hours. Everyone loved it. They couldn't stay away.

Followed the recipe.  Used orange juice instead of pineapple.  This was so good.  Best jerky ever.  My kids wiped out our first batch super quick.  Amazing.

A great mixture of flavours and a versatile base to make adjustments without altering the core ingredients. I have also made it with honey garlic in place of teriyaki with success. Only thing I find is the brine has an exorbitant amount of liquid for just 1 pound of meat and go with 2 or 3 pounds of meat and marinade overnight.

Try and pat dry your meat prior to put it in a dehydrator I just used a couple of paper towels to soak off the excess liquid and mine turned out great.

I thought this was EXCELLENT!  I made no changes and it turned out to be tastier than any store-bought jerky I have ever had.  I don't eat beef so I used turkey and YUM!  P.S.  Thanks for the hint of boiling and using the left-over marinade.  I like to be thrifty and this recipe isn't exactly cheap-it really bugged me to throw it out after marinating my meat in it.  Now I know how to use it.  :)

loved this one! made a slight modification by downing the soy sauce by 1/3 cup and substituted in hoisin sauce. used the same amount of liquids on 2lbs of meat. Had to up the onion/garlic/pepper mix.

I made the recipe as described. Adding the dry rub after marinade is essential. I smoked it rather than dehydrator so no liquid smoke required. I added a little prague powder #1 to preserve and smoked it low and slow with hickory and mesquite. Its the last recipe  ill ever need. My kids wont eat spicy foods. They disappear this jerky no matter how much pepper flake i add to keep them away. Simple , tasty, and easy to prepare.  My family and i love it. The semi frozen meat cutting is a great tip as well.

This is the 3rd recipe we tried and so far the best. It could be a little spicier for my taste so next time I'll add more red pepper. Also don't be afraid about eh "sweet" in the title as it is not very sweet at all, just a hint of sweetness.  I do agree that it makes a lot more marinade then is needed. I made about half the recipe and it was enough for almost 1.5 pounds of beef cut 1/4". It does taste professional and will definitely make it again..

Fam really liked this one. Made one batch without second layer of seasoning and no pepper. Mmmmmm. Fully seasoned next batch, more heat but so good. Got 3.3 lbs fron 8.25# roast.

My changes : Doubled the beef and used only a tiny hint (1/4 teaspoon) of liquid smoke.  I only had orange juice. I didn't cook the marinade either.  1 pound of beef strips (carne asada already sliced) each in 2 large mason jars, split the marinade, refrigerate overnight, food dehydrator on 160 for 4 hours.  Resist the temptation to dehydrate any longer!  Mine was just right.  Lots of compliments.

For the most part, this is a great recipe (though too much brown sugar and not enough spice (add a 1/2t of cayenne) for me), but do not marinade in a bowl.  This requires more liquid than necessary, all the liquid is at the bottom and the top stays dry.  Marinade in a Ziploc bag and put it in a baking dish so that it lays flat.  I was able to half the liquid in this recipe, and quadruple the amount of meat.  Also, you have to marinade a lot longer than listed, at least 24 hours.  I go 48 hours, massaging and turning the bag very 8-12 hours.

This is one of, if not, the best Jerky Recipe i have found.  I use a pellet smoker and opted out on the liquid smoke since smoke was going to be introduced via the smoker. I also used a shoulder roast (clod heart) for my choice of meat (cheap!!) Otherwise I followed the marinade recipe to a tee .  After 4 hours on the smoker (140 degree area) I pulled all but the thicker cuts and put them in a zip-lock.  As they cooled at room temp a delicious glaze formed.  These things are like potato chips! You cant eat just one.  The more you eat the more the heat comes out.  This will be my go to recipe, Though as a self proclaimed cook and pellet head smoker I will continue looking for an amazing jerky marinade it may be entirely futile with this finding.  Thanks so much!

I didn't add the final round of spices (my mistake) but even so it was very good- I might bump it to 5 stars once I properly follow instructions. I'll definitely make more!

I made this recipe Exactly as it was written. The only change I made was to marinade the meat for 24 hours. Everyone loved it. I don't have a dehydrator so I put it on racks in a low oven(170) for 5-6 hours, turning half way through. I've made this four times in the last few months and believe me it goes quickly. The last few times I doubled the recipe much to my husbands delight. It's just as described- Sweet, Hot and Spicy. This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent flavor for my deer jerky.  After not making any venison jerky for over ten years because it was too much hassle, I decided to drag out the old dehydrator after my latest harvest of a couple of deer.  The problem...I had long forgotten my recipe and needed a new one.  I've always liked the sweet and spicy jerky I purchased in the store so decided to give this one a try.  We are sure glad I did!  I followed the recipe with only a few exceptions.  First I always marinate the meat overnight using ziplock bags.  Every time I get in the fridge for something I work the meat around without having to open the bag.  The result is less mess with evenly and thoroughly marinated meat.  Secondly I'm not crazy about the liquid smoke taste so I cut it back and even omitted it on one batch.  I guess that's up to personal preference.  Lastly and probably most importantly to us, instead of the crushed black and red pepper I used in its place some creole seasoning and McCormick Caribbean Jerk seasoning.  It resulted in some great jerky...sweet with just enough pop of heat. Sweet, spicy and OH SO GOOD! My family and friends are eating it faster than I can make it.  Thanks for sharing.

Hands. Down. The best! I did only use 3 TBL mesquite liquid smoke and did ~4 hours at my lowest temp, 170F. The flavor is phenomenal, I would recommend using 2 lbs of sirloin tip since it makes a lot of marinade.

Used 3 tbsp. liquid smoke instead of 5.
Add 3 tbsp. honey
Use 1 1/2 tsp of garlic powder (use 1/2 teas minced garlic)
Use 4-5 drops hot sauce
No additional salt
Moose meat best

This is the best jerky EVER! I love making this so much I have to keep from eating it raw! OH MY GOD does it make my mouth water!!!!! I have made it by the recipe and then i made some adjustments. (it was a touch too spicy for my crew.) 1. I never have teriyaki sauce so I just add more soy sauce and pineapple 2. I cut the liquid smoke to 2 or 3 teaspoons. 3. I dump all the spices in the liquid. 4. I cut the red pepper to 1/4 tsp  and the black to 1 teaspoon mainly because I ran out of cracked black pepper and had to use ground. That said. its good  GOOD! I love love love this! I also dont let it dry to the dry dry stage. I like a little chewiness to my jerky. Its soooo good!

I had to create an account because I had to give credit for this recipe. It's perfect. If you want it hotter just add some more Tabasco. Everybody I shared it with loved it also. Especially my wife. She ate about two bags to herself. Thank you very much for this recipe!!!

I have made this recipe twice without changing anything except trying several different cuts of meat. My husband wanted beef jerky so I put the first batch in and showed him how to do it. Over the next couple of days he had made several batches to take on a trip out of town. Yeah, now he can make it whenever he wants to. I don't eat jerly, but my husband said this is a 5-star recipe.

This was my first time making jerky. I do not have a dehydrator so I followed advice of another reviewer and it worked perfectly. I used a foil lined bakers sheet and put the jerky on a cross-wire cooling rack. Baked at 150 for about 5 hours, opening the door to let out steam every now and then. Followed recipe exactly (did marinate overnight and doubled the meat but not the marinade) and would not change a thing, nor leave anything out. This was excellent and easy! This jerky is the PERFECT road trip snack! I definitely recommend doubling!

Excellent! First let me say great job and thank you. Taking the time to record and post proper potions made my part a piece of cake. Now, if I like I can tweak it. The only thing I did different was to add my own dried ground Sarrano peppers in the amount you recommended, great kick. 
I remember growing up and when my Mom and Dad would get back from elk or deer hunting we would string row after row of jerky across the garage and back yard. My Mom would salt and pepper it and that was all. Hay it was great but it was the same every time. Carne seca. 
I love that this is sweet and spicy. I knew after reading it that it would be caramely sweet because of the ingredients. No surprise there. Again, thanks for the recipe. Brad

This has to be the best jerky I have ever tasted!! My first time ever making it, I viewed a few other recipe's and most of the comments before hand. I only changed a few things.. i changed the meat cause I couldn't find anything on the shelf at the grocery store, I used a slab of flank steak from the butcher. I sliced and marinaded it for 12 hours. used 3.5 tablespoons of the liquid smoke. also I just added all ingredients to a big bowl instead of the two steps stated above (just easier for me)
Its still in the dehydrator now, been 5 hours, Just checked on it and  had to test a small piece, I couldn't resist it anymore lol mmmm mmm mmm wow!!  My hubby will be in heaven when he gets home!! Our thanks to you for posting!! CHEERS!!

This was amazing.  It's so easy and fast to do.  Both my boyfriend and I loved it.

I used beefalo sirloin for the meat.  I got 2 lbs of it and then doubled the marinade.

I pureed a whole pineapple instead of using pineapple juice.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce and it turned out great!

I'm going to use the leftover pineapple puree for a fruit roll-up.  

I'm planning to use this for a camping trip!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is by far the best jerky recipe I have ever used.  I had a huge leftover Christmas fully cooked ham and did not want to eat leftovers of that forever so decided to use this recipe and voila...Awesomeness.  The ham and sweet hot spicyness of this marinade were made for each other.  Added bonus is that instead of snacking on junk food I now crave this.  Way to go Dixychik!!!

My entire family loves this beef jerky marinade! It smells awful when you are cooking the marinade, but it sure is worth it when it's time to eat it. It always amazes me how quickly the jerky disappears.

Awesome! If it was up to my family and friends I could make a batch every day, it disappears so fast.

WOW!!!!! My husband is a first time hunter...got a moose and brought home a couple hunderd pounds of it! This is incredible!  First time I have ever made jerky or done anything with "wild" game! I have to make it every other day because it doesn't make it to any of the three F's ~ fridge, freezer or friends! I didn't have pineapple juice or the teriyaki (sp?). So went without! Delicious! Used the marinade twice ~ there was enough and didn't want to throw out! First batch was with round the second top sirloin...both great.  Sirloin a better choice! Incredible and my fam loves it with some cayanne in marinade and sprinkled on lightly before oven! 100 stars if I could give it!
Thank you!!!!

We use this recipe for EVERY backpacking trip.  Love the sweetness added by the pineapple juice.  Other than adding a little extra red pepper flakes to the mix, we follow the recipe exactly.  It's delicious!!

Yum!  this was very good,  just the right level of sweet.  i did omit the hotter spices because i don't always do well with smoldering food.

I have been making this all day! My daughter loves it..I used elk and apple juice instead of the pineapple juicel like another reviewer and this is great! I had just bought a counter top convection, toaster, and rotisserie oven and wanted to use it..It was perfect. The oven set on convection bake at 150 deg. and about 3 1/2 hours later it was done.
 Next time I think I will add ALL the spice to the marinade and more pepper flakes. But this is really good.

My family loved it, but to me it was just okay. I think it was the pineapple juice that gave it a strange flavor. I dried it in the oven, and it turned out great!

Because of this recipe, my friends and family think I'm a jerky expert! I've already made two batches since receiving my dehydrator for Christmas. Some with pepper, some without.

Great recipe.  Nice and tasty, I like the taste the balsamic vinegar adds.
