I sprinkled a little of the Kraft 3-cheese blend (parmesan, romano, & something)while it was grilling.  Yummy without killing the taste of the vegetable.

I put all of the slices in a baggie and just added enough dressing to lightly cover them. So easy and great.

This recipe was a big hit.  I think it would be nice to have some Parmesan cheese at the end of cooking.

We love this dish, and have been making it for years. It's also really good with some yellow squash and mushrooms along with the zuccini.

Great recipe. I used good seaons italian dressing with a little heavy on the vinegar side. I also grill zucchini by brushing with olive oil and then sprinkling with "salad supreme". Easy and quick. No marinating

Such a dependable recipe! I never marinate the zucchini for as long as this recipe calls for, though; I usually marinate mine for about 30 minutes, tops.  I also throw in a garlic clove, since I can't seem to make anything without it :P Grilled zucchini is delicious! I also add bell peppers and/or onions as well sometimes. Another suggestion, if you don't like Italian dressing: try a balsamic vinaigrette, it works great!

I may make again, but I definitely will not marinate for as long as called for in the recipe.  We found the flavor of the Italian dressing to be over-powering.

Instead of rounds, I sliced my zucchini in half lengthwise and then skewered them. It made it so much easier to cook on the grill this way. Didn't have any Italian dressing in the house so I used a Cranberry Balsamic instead. Tender crisp and absolutely delicious. Thanks Dave!

I only marinated my zucchini for about an hour, but the flavoring of the dressing was too strong.  I wouldn't recommend it.

Usually I saute my zucchini, so I was really excited to find this recipe that called for a different cooking method. Very summery and delish! :)

Zucchini is excellent when grilled. This is a great basic recipe. I scaled it down because I only make one or two zucchini at a time and I brush them with the italian dressing.

It was good, but make sure the dressing isn't too strong or that you really love the italian dressing you use.

I make this whenever our friends give us giant zucchini. I usually use Ken's Italian Dressing.
