Delicious little snacks that are perfect for taking in your lunch box. I was out of the tajin spice so I made my own by mixing chili powder, loomi aswad, and a pinch of salt.  I added some fresh lime juice to the water when boiling the seeds. I also used both melon and pumpkin seeds. Excellent recipe, thank you for sharing it.
