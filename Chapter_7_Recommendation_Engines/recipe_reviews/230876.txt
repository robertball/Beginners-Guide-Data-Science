I had a package of almond flour in my cupboard just waiting for the perfect dinner recipe to try it on. Coupled with the fact that I am cutting back on simple carbohydrates in my diet I couldn't wait to try this. Noting LilSnoo's review of the chicken not browning in the oven I chose to add pan fry this in a little olive oil and butter. Doing it that way certainly does not take a full 1/2 cup of butter and allowed it to turn the perfect golden brown I like to see in my chicken. I think it would be very good with the addition of a little garlic in the butter. I didn't have fresh Parmesan cheese so I used Romano in it's place. I served this alongside a simple garden salad topped with toasted slivered almonds and freshly grated cheese. This is very tasty recipe that I will be sure to make again.

What immediately caught my eye about this recipe was that it was low-carb diet friendly. I totally LOVE that almond flour is used instead of traditional breading or flour. I used a little less parmesan than called for, only because I ran out, but I thought the flavor was perfect, as were the other seasonings. I did find that they don't brown up much in the oven. They stay pretty pale-looking. I made up a second batch and stuck them under the broiler for about 15 mins, and flipped them halfway through, and those browned up nicely. I think next time I will cut back a bit on the butter, and use half egg/half butter mixture to cut back on calories. I will also set them on a grilling rack so they aren't sitting in the butter while they cook. That will help them crisp up nicely. Overall, a great recipe that I will make again and again!

This recipe is delicious! I agree with KGora and LilSnoo that is comes out a bit pale and pasty as is. I cut back 1/4 cup on the parmesan, dipped the chicken in egg instead of butter, rolled it in the mix and sautéed with butter and olive oil. I also like LilSnoo's idea of dipping it in a mix of egg and melted butter and broiling it. When it's crispy it is heavenly. Enjoy! 5 stars on flavor, 4 stars on original recipe.

Made this yummy recipe tonight for the second time and tweaked it just a little. I used mayo thinned with cream as the wet part of the dredge and used a six pepper blend for the seasoning. Once the cook time was up I broiled for a couple minutes, which crisped the outside really nicely. They turned out wonderfully, I think I've found a real winner!

I made this from a similar recipe but did not coat the chicken in anything before dipping in almond/cheese mixture. Then just pan sautéed it 3 minutes on each side.

So good!  I did add a dash of garlic powder for some kick.  Even my picky eater wants these again!

I didn't have almond flour, so I ground up raw almonds.  The crunchiness was delicious.

Very good!  I added slice of mozzarella cheese and a spoonful of pizza sauce to make chicken Parmesan, put back in oven until melted. Yum!  Will definitely make again!

I followed another reviewers advice and added an egg to the melted butter mixture. I cooked it in the oven at 475* instead of 375* and it browned up nicely and was cooked just right. I bought the chicken that was already precut into tenders so I didn't have to cut it up. I also didn't have any almond flour on hand so I used a wheat free gluten free coating mix I had and it turned out great. I gave it a 4/5 Because of the modifications I had to do. I would make this again with my changes. My kids liked it a lot and asked for seconds.

I love how this is low carb. Also, it's pretty delicious exactly how the recipe is. I didn't think the chicken turned out too pale like other reviewers mentioned, but I drizzled the leftover butter on top of the prepared chicken before putting it in the oven. So, there were golden patches on the top. I'll definitely be making this again.

Great recipe.  I used coconut flour instead of almond because that is what I had on hand. I'm lactose-intolerant so I used Veggie brand parmesan cheese instead of the fresh parm, Vegan butter instead of regular.  I also added some garlic powder.  They turned out great.  They are a little powdery and pale but I like it.  I am going to serve them with angel hair pasta for dinner tomorrow as a Chicken Parmesan dish.

Followed recipe as written except used boneless skinless chicken thighs. Baked in toaster oven and finished under broiler. Family states it's the best chicken they've had in a long time. Would definitely make again.

Fabulous and I will definitely make again!  Used a butter and egg mixture for dipping instead of all butter - can't wait to eat these again!

I pan fried these after reading the other reviews.  My boys really liked them and I have made them several times by request.  Our family has become GF and finding a breading for chicken strips was rather challenging, but we really like this recipe.

My family thought this was yummy. I used eggs instead of melted butter & lightly greased the foil to avoid sticking. I’m going to freeze the leftovers

Easy to make and can be modified slightly to produce different tastes. I added just a touch of dill weed and enjoyed it alot. Thanks for this simple, yet very tasty recipe.

Exactly what I was looking for - a baked chicken dish that I could eat on the KETO diet and that my kiddos would also approve of! I omitted thyme (our personal preference). Changes to this recipe based on reviews I read: used melted and slightly cooled butter combined with 1 beaten egg to dip the chicken strips in, cooked for 15 mins at 450, then broiled at 500 for 2 minutes to get coating crispy. Everyone loved it!

Was very delicious and tasty!  I didn't need quite as much flour and parmesan cheese though.  I had a little less chicken and had made about 1.5 cup mixture of them instead but still had plenty leftover.

Way too much butter so the coating never crisped. The flavor was awesome but the sogginess was gross.  Next time, I will replace most of the butter with eggs or even try spray butter with eggs.

I make these all the time for football games, parties, etc.  They are excellent.  The only reason I don't give them a 5th star is because they're not really crispy.  That doesn't really bother me too much, but it may be a deal breaker for others.

I had some almond flour left over from a dessert recipe and was looking for a main dish that used it as an ingredient. Made exactly as written- everyone liked it. Very easy too.
