The first time I made this I pretty much followed the recipe directions and ingredients. The second time, I got a little more creative and we ended up liking it even more. In addition to the ingredients written, I added 3 Tbls. of vinegar and 1 Tbls. of dijon mustard, which I blended in my food processor. After marinating the chicken, I broiled each chicken piece ten minutes on each side. I then placed the meat in the oven and continued to baste with the sauce. The broiling gave the chicken a nice crispy top and the vinegar and mustard additions added a nice flavor. Great recipe Holly!

This is sooooo yummy! I tripled (at least) the sauce for marinade, and used ziplock bags to marinate overnight.  I have baked and also grilled it on the gas grill in disposable baking pans - Each way was super good!  I've passed this recipe on to others and they love it too!

the BEST recipe for honey soysauce chicken ever.  It was so simple..marinated thighs/drumsticks/wings  for 3 hours and made extra marinade for basting half way thru.  Definitely use foil to line the pan though.  Also added a sprinkle of sesame seeds on top..we couldn't get enough of this.

I made this for lunch last weekend because I had all ingredients on hand. I used boneless chicken breasts (because that's what I had in the freezer). Note:If you do this, it cooks in about 1/2 the time. The flavor was good, but it was kind of salty. I'll definitely make again since it's so easy & pretty flavorful, but I'll try low-sodium soy next time and the (bone-in) chicken pieces as suggested.

This dish was okay, but I think the baking temp is too high.  The sauce burned in the first round of baking and made a mess of the pan.

This recipe did not have enough marinade to use as a sauce after cooking. I simply doubled the sauce to spoon over my famous ginger rice.......YUM!!!!!!

Had an excellent flavor.  I used ginger from a jar in the fridge, and I think when using that type, less of it is required.  Maybe half the amount.

I used thighs and drumsticks, doubled the sauce and added an extra Tbsp. of honey as well as 4 Tbsp of rice vinegar. Threw it all in a gallon Ziplock bag and let it sit in the fridge for a little more than an hour. I also turned the temp down to 400F because at the higher temp, the sauce would have burned and set the fire alarm off. At the lower temp it took about 45 minutes to bake. Hubby and son both say this one's a keeper!

WOW!  Out of this world YUMMY!  We are in love with this chicken.  The Hubster is already asking for it again soon.  I used the exact amount of marinade called for in the recipe, but only had 2 chicken legs (separated into thighs & drumsticks w/ skin-on) & it was so DELICIOUS!  Marinated all day then baked as directed (in an 8x8 dish).  Before baking, I turned the thighs skin side down & spooned marinade over the top of all pieces.  When I flipped the pieces after 30 minutes, I also spooned the marinate/drippings over all of them to get that gorgeous color.  Served w/ mashed red potatoes (no need for gravy) & garlic carrots.  Thank you for this absolute keeper of a recipe!  :)

Good recipe but couldn't help but chuckle at the first line of the directions where it said to arrange chicken pieces in a 9X3 inch baking dish.  I don't have a baking dish that narrow! Wonder how many typo's I've made, typing this review? Don't mean to be critical but just have a strange sense of humor!

Added 1/4 cup apple cider to marinade.  Suggest reserving part of marinade for basting during grilling.   Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

My husband and I thought this was great.  I actually messed up and put the green onion in the marinade instead of sprinkling on top and it tasted fine to me.  We both agreed there wasn't much honey taste so I may add more next time.  I also used two chicken breasts instead of the cut up chicken pieces.  Definitely saving this one!

Let me start off by saying this was great! 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the cooking times?? Lowered it to 350 still burnt by skin, but the flavor... yuum. My fiance said quote on quote, this is soo good, the meat is so tender its falling off the bone! I used bone in thighs.. will use legs next time or drumettes, would taste better. I tripled the marinade, put in ziplock bags next time when I have time, will mariande over-night. Used the last batch of marinade to baste while in the oven to keep it moist as it baked. This had a rich asain flavor with a kick. I did add ground red pepper and some red pepper flakes. (everything we eat involves spice) Deffinatly recommend, just think the cooking time is too high. Maybe bake covered?? Can you do that anyone?? Will it cook right/thru?

Yum! We really liked this.  My daughter gobbled down 2 pieces and picky son ate.  I followed suggestions and doubled sauce and lined pan with foil and recommend doing both.  Next time I may triple the sauce to have a bit to put over rice.  This is very good-will make again!

I give 5 stars because my bf absolutely loves this. He has me make it twice a week.  I use 5 0r 6 bone in chicken breasts and don't really follow the measurements suggested. I just put in however much is needed to cover all of the breasts.  I also don't bother to flip the pieces when cooking them. By doing this the pieces tend to get a bit of a blackened skin which is a huge hit.

SUPER! I used 12 chicken thighs that I skinned and boned myself, cut into bite-sized chunks and sprinkled some sesame seeds on top before I baked them. Perfect balance of flavors and really easy to make. I baked them on a foil-lined cookie sheet at 400 for about 15 minutes. SO good! Ate them with tri-color pasta, zucchini, avocado and chopped garlic.

This was excellent.  The only changes I made was to use 1/2 tbs of dried ginger instead of the 1 tbs of fresh that it called for.  I also tripled  the marinade.  I am so glad I did.  The chicken had good flavor that wasn't overpowering but that was strong enough to taste.  Very tender and julcy too.  I cooked it at 415 degrees for 50 minutes and had no trouble with it burning.  I served it with house fried rice and oriental vegetables.

This was really good. I used chicken breasts because that's what I had on hand. I doubled the marinade hoping that there would be some sauce to put over rice but there wasn't much. Next time I will triple the marinade. I served it with Basmati rice and broccoli.

This is the glaze I have been looking for. I trippled the marinade so that we would have some to drizzle over our rice. This was great flavor but I would cut down on the qty. of chopped onion. (I love onions raw, cooked, grilled, and fried but over powered to me but my partner does not care for onions said it did not taste to onion-ie.) I did not have green onions so I after I plated I sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds.

This was wonderful!! I did not have honey so used brown sugar. I doubled the sauce/marinade, next time I'll triple it. I thought it tasted just like the "Generals" chicken from my fav Chinese take out :)
I used low sodium soy sauce and sprayed the pan with Pam for easy clean up!

Good, but not any better than other sweet & soy style chicken dishes I've tried.  I marinated overnight, but this combination didn't get "in" the chicken as much as others have.  I tripled the sauce & had enough for the rice, too.

MMMHHHHHHHHHHH!!! This was delish! I used a whole 4lb bird rather than chopping it up. Cooked it for about an hour and 45 basting every 15 or 20 minutes. The flavor was great. the only thing I added was some brown sugar, lime juice and a little chili garlic paste. Came out great, cant wait to eat the left overs!

Great recipe! I was looking for something to make with chicken and honey and this one was a hit! I used skin-on bone-in chicken drumsticks and doubled the marinade. I didn't have ginger on hand so I didn't use it. I HIGHLY recommend using skin-on chicken as the skin takes on most of the flavor. Oh, and I took another reviewer's advice and lined my baking pan with foil for easy clean up. Nice and easy!

This is a great and easy recipe.  I used chicken breasts cut in thirds and marinated over night.  Worked great.  Will definitely make again.

I've made this a couple of time with a few changes to accomodate what I had on hand, and it was delicious every time.  Used garlic scapes that I finely chopped in the Magic Bullet instead of garlic cloves; used 1/4tsp of dried ginger instead of fresh (could probably use a bit more next time); used chicken thighs (skin removed) instead of a whole chicken; used half an onion in the marinade; and omitted the green onions.  I use a 9x13 dish as I assume it was a typo in the instructions.  I also marinate this overnight as other reviewers have suggested (I can't imagine it would be ready after only an hour of marinating unless you maybe poke holes in the chicken first but then you risk it drying out while baking).  I will definitely keep making this recipe!

This was pretty good.  I tried to use the grill with this recipe, which made the chicken a little dry.  It still had good flavor though.

This was just ok to me. Not, bad..but not great... I used thighs and legs...marinated the meat for about 5 hours...and still the flavor did not really 'get into' the meat as much as i had hoped. I did lower the baking temp so sauce would not burn as others had mentioned... it did the job, everyone ate it, but it is not a recipe in which i need to rush to make again.

This was not good.  Not much flavor, it was just too bland.  I had to make some spicy sauce to dip the chicken in otherwise I would have never eaten it.

I used chicken thighs and legs for this recipe. I don't like tiny pieces of ginger so I basically just cut slices and added that to the marinade. Let it sit for 2 hours in the fridge.

Think next time I would double the ginger and let it sit for about 4-6 hours to give the marinade time to really soak.

Excellent recipe. I made 2 changes. First, I added about 3-1/2 Tablespoons of soy sauce and I also lightly toasted the rice on high heat for about 4 minutes before I cooked it in my rice cooker.

I added 2 tbs rice wine vinegar but kept the rest the same. It was really tasty! Baked at 175C, 225C is way too high to make for juicy chicken. Great recipe though and we'll definately make again

Great starting recipe. I recommend you feel free to add more/other flavors you enjoy. As others have noted, I at least double the sauce. I try to cook light, so I use low sodium soy sauce and boneless skinless chicken breasts. I also add a tablespoon of spicy mustard and crushed red pepper for heat. After making the recipe a couple times, I decided on cooking the breasts in the oven on a sheet pan instead of casserole dish. I throw the extra marinade in a sauce pan to reduce and drizzle over the chicken when its done. I have also used this as a stir fry marinade/sauce on the stove top and it works great. I use the leftovers in a salad with ginger dressing... so great!

This was a very yummy recipe! I did double the amount of sauce and also added a little Asian marinade to it. It was quite tasty and my husband loved it! :) Even my picky 4 yr old liked it. I will definitely be making this dish again! Thanks.

This was just okay. I think it needs a little more doctoring for it to be asian-style though my kids really liked it. Both my husband and I thought it was missing something or two. Next time, I think I'll add some rice vinegar and maybe....I don't know. I want to play around with it.

This was delicious. Why doesn't it have more ratings? I had no scallions but the chicken was moist, tender and fell straight off the bone and melted in my mouth leaving behind an amazing after taste.

Delicious!  followed the suggestions of others and doubled the marinade, adding about 2 tbs brown sugar, 2 tbs lime juice and1  tsp of chili garlic sauce.  Marinated skinless/boneless chicken thighs about 6 hrs then cooked on a disposable pan over medium heat on a gas grill for about 10 min., then grilled them for about 3 minutes.

Easy, flavorful chicken recipe. Works for any piece, boneless or bone-in. I serve it with rice noodles and snap peas, then throw some sesame seeds on top for a pretty presentation. Gets great reviews every time.

The family gave me 5 stars for this...they said it had a great flavor and I made quick and easy pancit as a side for this which complemented the dish well...oh and also I was in the asian aisle of my supermarket and found ginger flavored soy sauce so I marinated the chicken in that and it really brought about a wonderfully unique flavor. Thank you very much for this!

This recipe is simple indeed  However, in my opinion, there seems to be something missing in the flavour.  I would not make this recipe again.

This was so good. HOWEVER....please don't make the mistake I did of pulling off most of the skin off the chicken. I was trying to be healthy, and the areas of the chicken without skin, (most of it) tasted like over marinated teriyaki and was so dry. The few remaining pieces with the skin tasted great. I let marinate over night, and followed the recipe as stated.

This was so good. I didn't have any onions so I added onion powder. The same with ginger but I left that out. I used leg quarters and marinated it over night. I used a little extra garlic, because I love it so but left other measurements the same. Using a pastery brush I lightly oiled the bottom of pan and clean up was almost a breeze. I baked 45 minutes, uncovered.  Not only did I love it, but so did everyone else. I can't wait to make this again.

If you've every had chicken baked in paper in a Chinese restaurant, this is a close approximation of it, and it's very good.  

If you chop the pieces of chicken up into tiny pieces and wrap each one individually in tinfoil, you can nearly recreate Chicken wrapped in paper.  

Otherwise, the original recipe turns out very well on its own.

I used boneless chicken breasts and added more soy sauce and it came out perfect. The family loved these tasty, tender chicken breasts.

Excellent Chicken.  My family loved it.  Do serve it right away, as the chicken burns easily.  Not very good as leftovers.

This was easy. I used boneless skinless thighs and doubled the marinade ingredients. It wasn't bad but I thought something was missing from sauce.

pretty good recipe.....although i would marinate it overnight instead of just one hour.  the chicken did not have much taste w/o the sauce but i believe it would have had i marinated it longer than suggested.

This was easy and delicious. Everyone in my family loved it, and it's rare we all agree on a food. Our family of 5 ate the whole chicken! I followed the recipe, but I did triple the sauce as suggested by others. I put 2/3 of it on the chicken to marinade/bake, and saved 1/3 and heated it up to serve over the chicken. It was a lot; I think doubling it would have been sufficient. Served with Jasmine rice (also great w/ this sauce).

I put the chicken in a ziplock and let marinade all day and baked in the evening. I put the chicken on a cookie sheet lined with a non-stick tin foil and also sprayed with Pam. I did broil the chicken for 15 minutes and the baked for 45 minutes. Yum!

I used 4 skinless and bone-in chicken.  I covered with aluminum foil and baked in 400 F for the first 20 minutes and reduced the heat to 375 F for the next 30 minutes.  I basted every 20 minutes.  I removed the cover for the last 10 minutes.  Very delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

I added some extra ginger to this and it was awesome! And you can do boneless chicken breasts as a healthier option too and either grill them or bake in the oven. Either are super easy and flavorful!

This recipe was excellent and easy to make.  I did tweak a few things like more honey, more soy sauce, and some Dale's marinade.  Recieved raze reviews from my co-workers, this one's a keeper :-)

This is a very good recipe. But I will say that to add the green oinion's for that length of time is a NO! NO!   30 second's before serving is best. they will then release all the flavour of nice fresh herb's. Oh yes I have made this recipe. It isn't some thing new. Nice to see older recipies coming out once again for our young people.

Very easy and tasty. Will make again often. I barbecued it as we love grilled meat better than baked. I cooked it low and slow as to not burn the chicken because of the honey.

This was good. I used boneless skinless chicken breast, and it came out very moist and delicious. I have a ten month old that I try to feed whatever we are eating, so for that reason I used brown sugar in place of the honey. Also added some sweet chili sauce and crushed red pepper to the mix and left out the green onion simply because I didn't have any on hand. Thanks for a good recipe, MARBALET.

This was a great quick dish. Covering the baking dish in foil save a lot of time cleaning up also. I marinated chicken in plastic baggy. I think next time I am going to put hoisin sauce on it and some chili paste to spice it up.

I tripled the marinade recipe, except on the "third time" I left out the onion and garlic as I had enough in the first 2. I also added 1 tablespoon of rice wine vinegar to the recipe (then times 3) and let it marinate in a ziploc bag in the fridge for about 6 hours. I baked it at 350 for 1 hour, flipping them half way through the cooking time. They came out moist and delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was a hit with my very picky family.  I used 4 chicken breasts,double the recipe, used powdered ginger (1 TBS) and left out the green onions (dd would have had a fit if she had seen them).

Super easy recipe that doesn't require too many ingredients! I doubled the sauce and did 4 chicken breasts. If you cook chicken breasts at 350 degrees, 15 min each side, it comes out perfect. I also suggest coating the chicken breast in olive oil before so the moisture stays in. If you are not a fan of ginger, this recipe may be a little too strong for you. The chicken tasted awesome with white jasmine rice!

This recipe was easy and satisfying. It is not a Honey Chicken recipe and therefor, most people will be either disappointed or delightfully surprised. It has more of a teriyaki effect to it (savory and ginger-y) this is probably why people feel it is too salty as well. I personally loved it. (used sesame seeds and 1tbsp apple vinegar)

Very Good. I made a lot of changes being i didnt have everything on hand. I didnt marinate the chicken since my chicken wasnt defrosted in time last night. I used maple syrup instead of honey and powdered ginger. I listened to the over reviews and doubled the recipe. came out very juicy! I cooked it at 350 degrees for 20 minutes on both sides and then I broiled it for about 5 minutes to make the skin crispy.

I've made this twice, once on the grill outside and once in the oven as suggested - both times with boneless, skinless chicken breast. Honestly, I thought it was 10 times better on the grill, with the char on it and the smokey flavor. Baking it in the oven was ok: very moist but not entirely flavorful inside. Try it on the grill, you'll never go back!

This was pretty good. I think next time I won't use so much cinnamon. And I agree that the outside tasted fabulous but the inside wasn't flavored at all. Maybe this could be marinated in the sauce & then it would taste stronger? Loved all the flavors though! Or maybe if the sauce is doubled the chicken would be immersed more in the sauce & soak it up better? Just some ideas... But still a great recipe & super tasty!

This chicken was good. I doubled the sauce and marinated for 4 hours, used chicken breasts with bones. Baked for 20 minutes on each side.

Looking for a juicy chicken? Then try this recipe BUT... as many reviews stated there's something missing and I think its a hot spice like chili oil or red pepper flakes but definitely needs some kind of zing. Flavor smelled more intense then it tasted, was to bland for my buds. The whole family ate it up. Will make again won't be on my rotation and will add something spicy.

I added extra soy sauce and added Dijon mustard and rice vinegar to the marinade and let it sit overnight. (Otherwise it seemed like there wasn't enough to marinade and baste it.) I seared it quickly on the stove top in my Dutch oven and placed it in the oven at 350 degrees until juices ran clear. It was a hit!

This had a great flavor!, but I did not follow the other suggestions of leaving the skin on and doubling the marinade.   If the marinade was NOT doubled and the skins were removed for health purposes, I would marinate for longer b/c the breast portions were a bit dry.

This had a great ginger flavor. I cooked this in a small countertop oven so it cooked in less time than stated. Son and I liked this very much although hubby really didn't. It was good, just not his preference. I used ginger paste, the same amount because it's what I had on hand. Easy and delicious! Thanks so much, my son asked for asian and he was happy with his dinner.

Excellent! I went home on my lunch hour to marinate the chicken so all I had to do was stick it in the oven when I got home from work. I used bone in drumstick/thigh with skin. Served with veggie lo mein noodles, great meal!

This recipe gets 5 stars because it required few ingredients, it was simple to make and tasted great. Im big on basting so i doubled the marinade and basted liberally through out the baking process. I will make this again :)

I really enjoyed this recipe, I used powdered ginger instead of fresh and didn't even have time to marinade and it turned out great.  

I didn't double the sauce and it was a perfect amount to glaze the chicken in a sticky sweetness almost like a honey garlic chicken wing.  The sauce is actually very strong when it bakes down and gets sticky, double in my opinion would be to much.

This is an excellent way to prepare chicken. I prepared the marinade as directed and marinated chicken thighs for about three hours and baked it according to the directions. I served this with roasted potatoes. This is a yummy way to bake chicken. I highly recommend this one.

This was a great dish, we cooked the chicken on the grill on low heat for 3 hours in a baking foil basting it frequently and we used more seasons than the recipe suggested, you can never use to much. Tasted great and we will cook it again.

I'm on a diet, so always looking for more flavorful and different ways to prepare chicken, so this one jumped out at me. I used chicken breasts, and substited Teriyaki sauce for the soy sauce; I also left out the green onions and the ginger ('cause my family doesn't like it), but this turned out very good. I took someone's suggestion and pan seared it, and yes, the sauce does stick to the pan something fierce, but it was very tasty. Only gave it four stars just because while it was good, it wasn't something that gave me that, "Oh my god this is heaven" feeling.

Seldom do I just follow a recipe without making changes. But this looked just right, maybe I uped the ginger a bit but only cuz I misjudged and cut a bit more than I should have. We were a bit rushed so it was left for only an hour to infuse the chicken. 12 hours or overnight would certainly boost the flavour profile and really kick it up so many notches. Wowza so good.

So simple, so delicious! Perfect to have prepared ahead and ready for the BBQ. I used skinless/boneless thighs...tender, moist and flavourful. This is a keeper.

I used the exact amount of sauce in the recipe for 3 bone in chicken thighs and broiled them for 7 minutes about 12 inches from the broiler. After I broiled them, I turned them skin side down and poured the remaining marinade from the bag over them. Baked at 375 for 25 minutes and then flipped them over and baked for another 15 minutes!!!  Delicious...even the pickiest kid in the world liked it!!!

so I ended up using this recipe for chicken that I added to an Asian sesame chicken salad and it took the salad recipe through the roof. This marinade  elevated the chicken and tasted fabulous and I followed the recipe to the letter.

I love this recipe and use skinless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts, since those always come out too dry. I also decrease the oven from 425 to 400 so that the marinade from the chicken doesn't burn as much.

Followed recipe...good, easy and tasty. The question is how do I clean the pan? It does leave a black mess.  I do not know if lining with foil would help or not. I will find out next time.

I cut the chicken into nugget size pieces and cooked according to the directions. I did forget to add the green onion. Green onion wouldnt have been well recieved for my kids anyway. Over all a pretty good recipe. Thanks.

I didnt really like this. There was not enough marinade as written- would need lots of tweaking to make it flavorful. I wont be making this again, not as its written anyway.

Quick and easy to prepare. I did make some changes though. I omitted the onion and ginger from the marinade as I had some leftover pineapple, ginger and lemon grass salsa from another recipe on here (it's a scallop recipe) and used that instead. I also added vinegar and grainy Dijon mustard as the top review suggested. Pulsed it all in the food processor then threw everything together and marinated for an hour as written. I recommend cooking the chicken skin side up for the first 30 minutes on your top shelf in the oven to get it crisp. I omitted the green onions as I thought they would burn. Only complaint is that these weren't saucy, so do double the marinade if you want to have some sauce to baste/drizzle over rice (obviously cooked since it's been with raw chicken).

I made a few changes...used red onion and a touch of sesame oil.  Its easy I would have given it 3.5 star is it let me.  Cheap and quick tastes pretty good.  You can do an Italian twist by removing the ginger and putting in some fresh lemon juice and balsamic vinegar in place of the soy.  Top with fresh herbs..

This was absolutely delicious!!  I baked at 425 degrees for about 25 minutes and then reduced to 350 degrees because the chicken was over-browning and I did not want it to burn.  I will be adding this one into my regular recipe rotation.

I found this recipe quite nice. I was a little concerned when I heard a few people referring to it as bland - I'm a spice & flavour fanatic but didn't find it bland at all. I added red pepper flakes (which was recommended by others) and salt & pepper to taste. It was a great tasting meal. Will make again.

This is ok in our opinion,but we have had much better. The sauce is awesome and I think I will try the sauce slow cooked over chunks of chicken. To us it just did not taste good with the whole pieces of chicken and I cooked it as directed. The sauce is a keeper and tasted yummy mixed with the fried rice and gave the glazed carrots and snow peas an even better taste when little bits of the sauce got on them.

I doubled the marinade per other reviews and baked covered at 300 degrees for 2.5 hours and then at 350 for .5 hours. It was fall-off-the-bone tender!

This recipe was pretty good.  My husband wouldn't mind if I made it again.  Next time I will definitely line my pan with foil.  I almost had to throw out a 9x13 glass casserole dish because I couldn't get it clean.

Yummy!  Both me and my husband loved this.  Tastes just like the honey garlic sauce I used to buy from a jar!  I used skinless/boneless chicken thighs, skipped the marinating cause they are so thin and just cooked at 350 for 25 minutes.  YUM!

LOVE this recipe! I read all the reviews before making it first time so I tripled the sauce, added sesame seeds and it was amazing! I might cover the chicken next time... the 2nd time I made it it was very dry. Total hit at my house!

This was an awesome recipe that I used for an unexpected dinner party. Although, I did lower the temp of the oven and doubled the marinade. I poked at the chicken to soak up more of the flavors. I also added an extra bit of ginger to the pan, of which I DEFINITELY recommend lining with foil. I used the extra marinade for my asian noodles and rice. BIG HIT! Even Grandma liked it!! Thanks so much for this. I will make it again!!

This was an excellent recipe.  The chicken was so tender and moist and full of that robust Asian flavor.  I will definately make this again, my family loved it and I think I may sprinkle a few sesamee seeds over the chicken as it rests before serving.

Very good! I marinated overnight and then cooked the chicken pieces in the crock pot on low for 10 hours in the marinade, I think next time I will try baking as author suggests, it was just too hot out today to have the oven on.

Good but not what I expected.  Tasted like teriyaki versus having the sweetness of the honey that I wanted.  Would make again and play with the proportion of ingredients.

I made this for dinner a few nights ago...my whole family raved--yeah!! The only change I made, was to grill the chicken. Fantastic! I'll definitely be making again. Thanks for sharing!

YUMMO!! well, i changed it just a tad. I added a couple T's of orange juice. used powdered ginger (didn't matter, still delish), and I did make a lot more marinade. The BIGgest difference is that i BBQed them on the barbie, and I think baking them would have been not near as good. The grill really makes a delicious sauce out of the marinade ... It was a huge hit.

This made a jucy chicken breast, which I never can make happen. Since using breast, I cooked for about a total of 35 minutes. I also doubled the sauce, and then added one more batch when I turned them over. I don't know, I think it lacks a flavor but I don't know what it'd be.

Chicken and honey go so nicely together. I loved the sweet salty balance of the honey and soy sauce. Used chives instead of green onions and unfortunately was out of fresh ginger so I had to use ground ginger. I love mushrooms so I topped mine with some fresh sliced ones.  Definitely marinate for several hours and try it on the grill. Thanks!

If there were higher stars, I would give this recipe that. It was so good!! I have had requests for it ever since I made it. I did follow some of the suggestions of the other cooks. I doubled the sauce, and covered it for 20 minutes with foil then let it cook for another 15 minutes. Wonderful meal!!

Although the sauce had good flavor, the chicken was dry---I used chicken breasts and will try it again using a whole chicken as suggested. Overall, it was an average dish.

My boys and my husband liked this recipe very much.  I doubled the sauce like others suggested.  I am not sure it is really necessary.  I used a mixture of white and dark meat chicken but will stick to dark meat next time.

Very good.  I used chicken thighs (removed the skin).  To make more of the marinade I added a little more soy sauce and a few tablespoons of canola oil.  Chicken turned out very tasty and moist.

I thought this was good.  I used boneless skinless breasts and browned them in a skillet before transfering them into the oven.  I wasn't thrilled with the consistency of the sauce, but that was easily fixable.  I did double the sauce to have over the rice.  I will use again, because it was very easy to do.  Thanks for the postl

I really liked this recipe. However I had to make a lot more sauce than the recipe called for. I doubled the sauce and used 3/4 on the chicken, saving the rest to put on rice and vegetables. I used chicken thighs and they came out really nicely.

Overall a good recipe.  I pared it with some risotto and steamed vegetables.  I would have prefered to have more of the glaze taste.  Perhaps using boneless breasts, or smaller pieces of chicken would have helped to highlight the flavor.  All in all, I will make it again.

i found that using legs and wings only was better...the glaze sank into smaller pieces easier than large.  i also tried it without ginger root and did not notice a difference.  since the root is only avail. as an actual root and i wasted more than i used i will not use the root again.

Yummy!  I didn't have an onion at the time so I used dried onion flakes.  It made it a little crunchy, which we liked.  I will make this again for sure!

This was certainly an easy recipe, and the flavor was good.  The high heat made the sauce burn in the pan, but it didn't stop us from eating all of it.  Thanks for the recipe, Holly!
