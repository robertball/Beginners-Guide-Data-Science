I don't use almond milk, any kind of cow's milk works just as well BUT the nonfat does froth better. The cream cheese was an interesting addition--I didn't think I would like it but it was actually quite good. I did change this recipe a bit and added chocolate syrup. Interesting coffee drink!

This was pretty good! I used 1/4 cup unsweetened almond drink, 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream with one cup of cold coffee. Also added one Stevia packet, 1 tsp. of cocoa and 1 tsp. vanilla.

This is best described as a watery - milky - coffee. I followed the recipe as written and even used unsweetened almond milk but mine had vanilla in it. This isn't something I would make again. It might be a good substitute for someone who likes coffee drinks but has diet restrictions.

I made this as a hot coffee drink as Paula did.  It was good but different. Next time I will try it cold with coffee ice cubes.

I was expecting weak, watered-down coffee with this recipe but was pleasantly surprised. Evidently , the cream cheese amps up the richness of this drink and compensates for all the almond milk versus so little coffee. I used coffee ice cubes to keep the ice from diluting my coffee as I slowly sipped it, and I used my normal stevia as sweetener. The key here might be very strong coffee to begin with.  ***I made this again tonight with decaf coffee and drank it hot. I like it hot as well as cold!
