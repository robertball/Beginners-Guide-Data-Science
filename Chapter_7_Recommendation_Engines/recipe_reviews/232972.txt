What a way to put silk stockings and high heels on broccoli!  The croutons (I pulsed them in the food processor to rough crumbs) add great flavor and the broccoli (I used fresh and blanched it for just a couple of minutes) stayed a vibrant green. Since my croutons already had sufficient butter in them I didnâ€™t add the second drizzle of butter the recipe called for.  Rich and flavorful, this dressed up broccoli is worth the extra preparation it requires.

Great way to takes plain 'ol broccoli to a whole new level! I used a steam in bag of broccoli and cut the amount of butter in half. Next time I might add a little grated Parmesan cheese or shredded cheddar, but honestly this was great as is and perfect for a last minute side dish!

I used fresh broccoli, blanched it for about 3 minutes and proceeded from there.  I couldn't see drowning this healthy vegetable in all that butter so I just dotted the spears with it.  Since the recipe name is broccoli with buttery crumbs, that is what I used.  I seasoned my homemade crumbs with garlic powder and some grated provolone, sprinkled that over and dotted that with butter.  Then baked as directed.  This was delicious, the broccoli was tender crisp and we will be having this again.  Thanks, Jen

I made this even easier by using a frozen steamable bag of broccoli (I knocked a minute off the microwaving time to ensure a bit of bite).  I also couldn't make myself use 1/2C butter (I halved the recipe), so I used a bit less than 1/4C and it was plenty.  I may try to use even less next time just to save some calories.  We only had seasoned croutons and they added some nice flavor.  I used GOYA Adobo Seasoning for the seasoned salt.  THANKS for the recipe!

This was really good. I just made enough for myself in a very small baking dish. I used frozen broccoli florets that I microwaved first for a few minutes. I also crushed the herbed croutons a bit so they would be more crumb-like and not chunks, topped with a bit of parmesan cheese and garlic powder and baked it for 12 minutes. I'm sure using buttery round crackers in place of the croutons would work just as well. Like a veggie comfort food!

I love this recipe! I see seasoned croutons, crushed. M am;y ate it as is, and thought it was really good. I squeezed a lemon over my serving, and it went up to AMAZING! I know that lemon is not in the recipe, but that addition made it a perfect 10! Thanks for sharing.

Liked it well enough but would use real parmesan cheese (not the powdered stuff in the green plastic jar) next time
