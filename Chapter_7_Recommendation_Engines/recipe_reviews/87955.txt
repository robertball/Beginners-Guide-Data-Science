Coming from a Chinese family, I would never attempt to make fried rice with fresh cooked rice - only ever day old rice. With this recipe and day old rice, my grains of rice turned out fresh and didn't stick to the bottom of the pan or turn into a ball of mush, but it didn't really turn out 'fried' either. I didn't have any eggs in the house, so I skipped it. And I couldn't bring myself to put BBQ sauce in hoisin and soya sauce - I just couldn't wrap my mind around it - so I used oyster sauce instead. My recipe looked more like: equal parts hoisin and oyter sauce with a splash or two of soya sauce, 1 tsp of ground ginger and 1 tbsp of peanut butter. The resulting sauce I was quite happy with. I then fried the garlic up with onion and chicken, added green pepper and zucchini...and voil√†. Despite the failure of the fried part of my rice, I quite liked the idea for the sauce this recipe gave me.

I was really looking forward to trying this recipe, but should have more carefully thought about the amount of barbeque sauce that was included in the sauce (I figured it would blend in a way that wouldn't scream, "Barbeque Sauce!") (And, I put only half of the sauce into the rice mixture...ended up throwing away the rest of the sauce.)
I'm not a big barbeque sauce fan (a little goes a long way with me), and the barbeque sauce was overpowering to all of us at this meal. If you *love* large amounts of barbeque sauce, you will probably enjoy this dish.

this could be much better if you used day old rice. with the freshly cooked rice it was quite mushy. great flavors though. the sauce was good on chicken.

I read the reviews and decided to make it as it is written the first time....it was ok.  The second time I did change it a bit.  I didn't use the bbq sauce....instead used a duck sauce.  We liked it better the second time around ...without the bbq.  Thanks for the post.

Awesome combination of flavors!   Only thing I added (because it's so incredible in dishes like this) is fresh chopped cilantro when it was done.   

Yum!

Since I loved all these flavours too, I was excited to try this recipe.  My husband and I LOVED it!  I made some substitutions, not out of "correction", but because I did not have the ingredients.  Ran out of onion, used onion powder both in the sauce and while frying the rice.  Used mixed stir-fry vegetables, and added some of last night's grilled chicken breast strips (marinated in Korean Marinade, elsewhere on this site.)  WOW!  The only addition I made was to had about a quarter teaspoon of Vietnamese chili sauce, making this dish a truely eclectic blend of Asian flavours!  Marvelous, will make this AGAIN AND AGAIN!  Thanks Carlyyy, for this great idea!

My husband and I enjoyed the taste of this rice.  I do think the trick to non-mushy rice is to use cold or frozen rice.  I had fresh broccoli rather than frozen and it worked fine in this recipe.  Liked the taste of the sauce with the hoisin sauce.  I will make this again, and again using "cold" rice.  I served this with 'Glazed Carrots Asian Style' and 'Asian Lettuce Wraps', both AR recipes.

This dish was great.  I replaced the white rice with whole grain brown rice, which add some extra cooking time, but the outcome was worth it.

Not real crazy about this. It was very sweet, and I didn't use that much of the sauce. I think maybe I just don't care for hoisin sauce? sorry, won't be making this again.

My fiance and I really liked this one! The only thing i changed was to add a little chinese 5 spice powder and water chestnuts (cuz i love them). And the only reason to give 4 stars instead of 5 was that it was a bit mushy. But I'm not really sure what would solve that problem....All in all, good dish!

I thought this was going to be great so I made a double batch because my husband loves rice. It was terrible! The BBQ sauce was so overpowering we couldn't eat it.

My husband took one bite of this and refused to eat anymore.  I think that if I made it again, I wouldn't use most of the ingredients in teh sauce, just use Hoisin instead.

I love this recipe. If I don't have enough BBQ sauce to make half a cup I will add some ketchup or teriyaki or even more hoisin sauce to make the half a cup. I don't use the rice part of the recipe, just the sauce. I also add an extra tablespoon of peanut butter. It make the sauce nice and creamy. Even my three year old has a second helping.
I use whatever meat and veggies I have pour it all over chow mein noodles.

First, I give it 3 stars on the directions, but 4, even 5, on rice recipe and the potential it has.  In order to have fried rice be fried rice, it has to be cooked cold rice. No other way around that.  The recipe ingredients are above average. I did take the recommendation of other reviewers and went really easy on the BBQ sauce.  Hoisin itself is Asian BBQ sauce. I used frozen peas and carrots, broccoli from my garden, fresh ginger and garlic, onion, the 2 eggs, and leftover cooked bacon I had. Added a bit more low sodium soy to the sauce, plus 1 T white viengar.  This recipe has so much potential using various meats, fish, veggies, and spices.  Thanks for sharing the recipe with us.  It will be on our table often.

This turned out great. I doubled the rice, water, and garlic to feed a larger group. I used frozen broccoli and frozen mixed peas and carrots. There was a faint peanut flavor, which would accomodate a Thai meal also. I left out the bbq sauce and added a little stir fry sauce instead. I definitely did not use 1 cup of sauce as written. I served it with a chicken ginger soup, and it was a complete meal. Thanks!

This was pretty good!  I substituted in the veggies I had, and used brown rice instead of white rice.  The sauce makes this a very versatile dish-- you can add anything in and the sauce adds a nice flavor without overpowering the rest of the ingredients.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This recipe was too sweet for our tastes. I might try it next time without the bbq sauce and hoison sauce and just add more soy. That would make it a good basic fried rice recipe.

I thought the flavor was great, but alas, my husband only gave it a shrug.  I think there was too much barbeque flavor for fried rice.

I followed this exactly and don't think will make it again. No one took seconds.

Spicy, spicy. I used a different combo of veggies than what the recipe said to use (half a bag of mixed veggies/shredded carrot/shredded onion/shredded cabbage) and halved the sauce mixture and kept it on the side. Aside form that I left everything the same and it tasted pretty good. A really decent fried rice dish that does have quite a kick from the sauce. I served this with Baked Spring Rolls and everyone really enjoyed it.

It's good. Nothing all that memorable, but it's an okay recipe. I added cashews for that taste and for the extra protien. Note: this makes A LOT of sauce. I cut the sauce measurements in half, based on other reviews, and still only used half of what I made!
