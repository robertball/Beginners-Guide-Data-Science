I'm giving this 4 stars but I did change the recipe.  The amount of tomato sauce (32 oz.) compared to the amount of chicken broth (14 oz.) seemed off to me.  I thought it might taste just like eating tomato sauce.  Anyway, I reversed the amounts with 32 oz. of 99% fat free broth and 15 oz. of tomato sauce.  I may experiment with the proportions in the future.  I also added one chopped onion instead of using only one slice & reduced the basil quite a bit, due to family preference.  Finally I added whole wheat pasta separately to the soup at the table so the pasta wouldn't get too mushy when the leftovers were reheated.

Very good and similar to the recipe I have been using. My kids don't like to see a lot of beans in this dish.  So, I reserved 1/2 cup beans and 1/4 cup chicken broth and pulsed in food processor to make the dish creamier. It also turns out lighter in color.

yum!  I upped the oil 3-4 T, upped the garlic to 5 cloves crushed, substituted one of the cans of tomato sauce for a can of diced tomatoes for more texture and added freshly grated parmesan cheese at the end.  Don't forget to serve with oven warmed crusty italian bread!

Quite good, especially on a cool night.  I too reversed the quantities of tomato sauce and chicken broth, and I'm glad I did.

I too used 2 cups of tomato sauce and 4 cups of chicken broth instead of the other way around. I also chopped up a whole onion and cooked the pasta in the actual soup (didn't see the need to dirty another pan!). I finished it off with some parmesan cheese over each bowl.

Thanks for this delicious, easy recipe.  I discovered pasta fagioli at Olive Garden and wanted to make it ever since.  We liked this version just as well -- and there's no red meat in it!

Delicious!  I reversed the broth and tomato sauce quantities and it was great.  Otherwise I think it would be too "tomatoey".

I make a more tasty and complex pasta fagioli, but this one was pretty good for the time it took.  I added 1 1/2 c water since the tomato sauce was too thick for a soup. I also wish I only put in 1c pasta. I also used a big can of cannelli beans.  overall pretty tasty and really easy to make!  I'll make this again!

I have made this recipe twice. First as written.  It was good, but needed changes.
First used 1 (14oz) can diced tomatoes, 1 (14oz) can tomato sauce, 4 (16 oz) cans of chicken broth.  The added 1/2 of a zucchini diced, 1 (10oz) pkg chopped spinach thawed and drained, and diced fresh mushrooms (about 1/2 cup). I also left out the pasta. I cooked the pasta and added when served.

This was great!! I thought I was in for a not-so-good dinner tonight when I realized we didn't have any meat in the freezer. But, I found this easy recipe, and I thought I'd give it a try! I happened to have everything right in my cupboard, I just had to use shell pasta instead. I think adding red pepper flakes is a must, it gives it a nice spicey kick. I also added more chicken broth and less tomato. YUM! Thanks for this recipe!

Followed this recipe - couldn't wait - but was greatly disappointed. I think this is the first time I only give 2 stars.  My husband who is Italian, said it was edible, and the leftovers were not kept.

Sorry!

Great recipe! I used 1 15 oz. can of tomato sauce and one 28 oz can of Diced tomatoes and about 2 cups low sodium chicken broth. Also used a whole onion (diced) and replaced celery with zuchinni (only because we are not big fans of celery), also added some diced red peppers.I used a whole wheat pasta. These amounts worked for me because I have a family of three so it was enough to feed us and have a little bit leftover. It came out perfect not too soupy. It was nice and hearty. My family and I loved this even my 9 yr old and that says it all! Infact I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch today. =-) I did pair this with a side of fried Cabbage. Fried (sauteed) in butter, a splash of Red Wine Vinegar and some black pepper. A definite A+ in my house, perfect for the coming cold months.

Needs more broth as is.  I would also add Italian sausage for my family since we enjoy that flavor.

This was an amazing recipe, however there were a few things I changed to get it to this point: I did as others suggested and reversed amounts of tomato paste and broth, I also used red kidney beans and macaroni instead. Five Stars. A wonderful Flavor.

I followed this recipe to a t.  Whole family enjoyed.  My 8 year old is a huge soup fan.  This soup is better the next day than it is on the day you make.   The pasta does soak up the liquid.  When I reheated - usually cup by cup -- I added a little bit of water to make it more soupy.

I have recently become a vegetarian and look for great new recipes. I was babysitting for my 6 year old granddaughter last night (who doesn't like anything green)and decided to make this soup. OMG! She ate her bowl, my hubby licked his clean and I can't wait for the leftovers today. I did follow the advise of others and used 1 15 oz can tomato sauce, 1 15 oz can diced tomatoes and 1 32 oz container vegetable broth. I also threw in 1/2 of a red onion instead of 1 slice and wanted to use up a zucchini and some green beans, so threw them in as well. This takes to a lot of variations and you should really try it.Thanks for a wonderful recipe Cindy.

This was great for dinner on a cold rainy winter night! I only gave it 4 stars because I thought it might not be quite as filling since the original recipe didn't call for any meat.   I browned some crumbled Italian Sausage separately and added that to make it more substantial.  I also used about 32 oz of chicken stock that I had frozen from before, and added 4 of the small cans of spicy V8 and 1 can of tomato paste.  I did have to add a little cornstarch to thicken a little - but if I'd let it simmer longer it probably would have cooked down.  BUT - overall, it was fantastic.  Served in big bowls with crusty french bread to dip into the broth.  Making me want to go get a bowl right now after writing this review!

I LOVED this recipe! It was so easy and uses ingredients I'm likely to already have in my pantry. I made a couple of small changes...I used navy beans instead of cannellini beans because I couldn't find any of those. I also added a few slices of cooked bacon I had leftover in the freezer. Also, I sauteed the veggies and added these and all of the rest of the ingredients (except the pasta) to the slow cooker. I cooked it on high for about 4 hours. I cooked the ditalini separate and just added it at the last minute. It turned out great!!

I tried this for the first time tonight and it was a hit! Like I always do, I took into consideration some of the suggestions of others and I added a hair more broth and only 1 can of tomato sauce to get that thinner consistancy. Added 4 garlic cloves for flavor and followed everything else exactly. Served it with Ceasar Salad. Awesome! I plan on making this some weekend with friends for soup, salad and I will add some bread and wine! Excellant healthy meal! :) Thanks for Sharing!
UPDATE: I added mushrooms and used mini shells...still delish!

I made this just as written except I doubled the celery and left out the carrot.  It was okay, but too bland--it mainly just tasted like tomato sauce.  I would add more seasonings to it if I made it again and more vegetables.

very good. I switched it up a bit. I only added 3 cans of tomato sauce, and I added an extra cup of chicken broth, and then I also diced up 3 plum tomato's and threw them in...

Great soup on a cold winter night.  I added more garlic and cayenne pepper as we like our food a bit spicy.  Also, i used anothe can of chicken bthan the recipe called for.

This was very good. It came out very thick as it is written. The leftovers seemed to have no liquid and more of a thick sauce. This tasted good leftover! I do think I would add another half of a can of both to thin it out. This is also very inexpensive to make. I will make again.

I made it the first time following the recipe exactly. Way too much tomato taste for me. I cut the tomato sauce to 15 ounces & increased the chicken broth to one quart. Outstanding! Will definitely make this again in the cold northeast.

It was easy to make and fairly cheap, too.  I used elbow macaroni since it is what I had.  Tasted almost like vegetable soup.  It wasn't bad, but nothing special to repeat.

Delicious! I made the soup as instructed in the recipe, but used fresh basil from the garden. Also, at the end I stirred in about a half pound of cooked ground beef that I'd seasoned with Italian herbs and garlic powder. 

My store did not have any ditalini pasta, so I replaced with a sort of tube pasta, with a lasagne type ruffle along the side. Very good!

The recipe was great! I was a little nervous about the 4 cans of tomato sauce (I don't like tomato soup and was afraid it might taste like that) but I decided to try it and I'm glad I did. The only changes I made were to add 2 bay leaves, puree about half of the beans to make the soup thicker, and I used Pipete pasta because I couldn't find Ditalini. Served with grated parmesan cheese on top--YUM!

I used celery seed rather than celery despite that(hate cooked celery), and used canned already-cooked carrots & avoided using oil altogether.  Otherwise made as is.  I generally prefer making the recipe close to as is, but this is one time I wished I'd seen the suggestion to switch proportions around for the tomato sauce & broth.  I didn't think it taste too tomato-y.  I just didn't think it was all that exciting, but mostly there just seemed to be way too much pasta relative to the liquid, even given that fagioli is usually thick.  But I think I'll try that switch.  (Also cooked the pasta first, sat aside, and reused that pan to save on pans.)

It seemed like I was making a marinara sauce.  I ended up omitting the beans, adding a can of minced clams with their juice, and serving the delicious sauce over cooked thin spaghetti!  An entirely different recipe, but it was really good!

My husband and I  made this recipe 2 days ago. The only change we made is we used Classico sausage tomato sauce and added ground mild italian sausage . The soup was so delicious that we are making it again for our son Evan.

I love this recipe and make it regularly (but I use veg broth for chicken broth).  This time I didn't have any carrots or celery so I substituted zucchini and broccoli and it was still delicious.  I like the strong tomato flavor.  I will make it again and may incorporate even more veggies!

I made this last week & the entire family loved it--even the kids.  The only thing I did differently was substitute Tomato Basil Prego for the tomato sauce & dried basil.  We had it with garlic bread sticks & every last drop was eaten.  Making it again tonight.

Delicious with some changes. Used equal amounts tomato sauce & chicken broth; pureed some of the cannellini beans to thicken broth; used 1-2 garlic cloves, half a diced onion, 1-2 tablespoons of fresh basil chopped. Cooked the ditalini pasta in a separate pan, drained & added cooked pasta at the end. Topped fagioli with shaved parmesan cheese & served with garlice bread.

I changed things up a bit for my family's tastes and what we had on hand. I sauted about a tsp of minced garlic in oil for about a minute, then I added 2 cans of chicken broth and a little over a cup of meatless spaghetti sauce. I also added some dried basil, pepper, and a couple shakes of dehydrated onion flakes. I let it simmer for a few minutes, then I added 1 can of drained garbanzo beans and ½ can of drained black beans. I pureed the rest of the can of black beans with some of the soup and then stirred it into the soup (it helped to thicken and improve the texture and colour of the soup). I let that simmer for another ten minutes, then I added a couple cups of a frozen pasta-veggie blend (mini bow ties, peas, carrots, corn). Ten minutes later, dinner was done and made extra-tasty with some parmesan. It was very similar to minestrone and quite delicious. Thanks for sharing, Cindy!

OMG this is sooooooooooo good!. I started to follow as written, but then saw I would want it 'soupier' so i added a full 32 oz box of chicken broth to 28oz tomato sauce. mmmmmmmmm so good! I will do this( without beans and pasta) as a base for cream of tomato soup too, from now on!!! My husband just finished his bowl and said, "This is better then what we get at the italian restaurant!"

It's a hit at our house! I subbed some things to use what I had in the pantry: V8 instead of tomato sauce (1/2 the amount), beef broth instead of chicken, and whole wheat penne. Served with parmesan and crusty rolls. YUM!

Excellent and easy to make.  The only thing I added to enhance the flavor was 1.5 lbs. of cooked lean chopped ground beef (drain any excess grease before adding to soup).  I also froze half of the soup for those cold winter rainy days.

Let me start by saying that we loved this! I did halve the tomato sauce and doubled the chicken broth and garlic as others did.  It is a keeper, just as it is!  However, in talking it over with my soup lover husband (who also gave it 5 *) I think the next time, I may add chopped green pepper, or chopped bacon, or some chopped spinach, or all of the above!  Excellent recipe and so EASY!

I really liked this recipe.  Here are the changes I made: I added an entire finely chopped onion, one bay leaf, 2 T. fresh parsley instead of dried, and an additional garlic clove.  For the broth I used equal parts tomato sauce and chicken broth (about 32 oz. each). Served with some homemade garlic bread.

It was a cold day here in Chicago (we saw our first snow flurries)! I knew right away I needed something warm and filling, and looking through my recipe box, I stumbled onto this little gem. It was the perfect meal, this is to DIE for! I've never had pasta fagioli before, so I really can't compare it to anything. But this tasted absolutely wonderful! The only change I made was omitting the carrots, as I didn't have any on hand. I wish I had tried this one out sooner! But now I know it is a keeper for sure, thank you so much Cindy!

Really good and easy!  I realize that some like their pasta fagioli chunkier than others, but I thought it was still pretty thick with using twice the recommended amount of broth and half the amount of sauce.  This is a keeper!

Very easy and great tasting!!!  I did shift around the liquids a little.  I used 1 can chicken broth, 1 can beef broth and 1 1/2 cans tomato sauce.  REALLY good on a cold day with a loaf of bread!!!

recipe was great with no changes - not sure what all the hoopla was about the sauce and the broth, I followed the recipe to a tee, family loved it-thought it was better than Olive Gardens

Super simple to make.  I love garlic, so I added a total of 4 tsp. of garlic.  My husband raved about it.  My picky-eating 1 year old loved it too.  Made a garden herb bread to go with it, which went very well together.  Will definately make this again.

This was easy and delicious.  I read the reviews and took others advice  to  swap the amounts of tomato sauce and chicken broth. I  added a little more garlic and a pinch of crushed red pepper. I will definitely make this again.

Great, simple recipe. I used one can of diced tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce because I like some chunks of tomato in it. Also, cut the pasta back as suggested. I also added some sliced zucchini to use it up. Very good flavor.

I only used 16 oz of tomato sauce and 10 oz of No Chicken broth to keep it vegetarian.  Added 1/2 teaspoon of celtic sea salt and 1/2 teaspoon of italian seasoning.  Also added fresh basil!
I used an immersion blender to smooth out the chunks of vegetables.  It was delicious with parmesan cheese on top!  I give it 5 stars with the changes!

Even if you reverse the amount of tomatoes and broth it's still too tomatoey, most like tomato soup with various ingredients. Also, I add some beef I had in the fridge and that really made it stand out.

Easy and delicious... I, too, reversed the chicken broth/tomato sauce proportions, added diced Italian sausage, parmesan cheese, a bit of Italian red pepper, extra garlic and waited to just before serving to add the ditalini.  Simple cooking is the best cooking, it seems.  And this recipe is a great example of that!  I highly recommend it.

I looked this up only because we had it at Olive Garden. Was very close however the restaurant version we had definitely had spaghettti squash in it. It was a nice addition.

I’ve never tasted this soup before but I must say I really like it, I added ground Italian sausage to it for a little more substance. I also made this gluten free, and it worked out quite well! ??

I found this too heavy with the straight tomato sauce and instead subbed 2 large cans of crushed/diced tomatoes. This added to the favour and made this absolutely delicious. I now make this on a regular basis and my kids love it!

This was delicious and so easy to make!!  I combined everything but the beans and pasta and in my crock pot and cooked it on low for 3 - 4 hours.  As suggested I added the beans while the pasta was cooking and the pasta went in once it was done.

Use 2 cans of canolini beans and 2 cups of pasta. When Pasta Fagioli was done I stirred in a 1/4 cup  romano. Let stand for 5 min and served.

The basic idea is great, but the liquid ingredient ratios are off.  I used 16 oz of san marzano crushed tomatoes to about a quart of vegetable stock.  We all love a lot of pasta in our soups, so I doubled the ditalini pasta.  I've also varied the recipe with garbanzo beans, adding zucchini when we are inundated with it in the summer, and adding spinach at the end of cooking.  It tastes better the next day, but you may have to add additional liquid when rehear

After retirement, my husband and I moved to the tiny Italian village that was home to his grandparents. We now live at the top of an old apartment building.  When my husband came in, a few days ago, he said he smelled pasta fagioli (pasta fazool) on the way up, and it smelled just like his nonna's.  So, I found this recipe and made it tonight.  He said it was perfect. The only difference, he said, was that "Nonna's was brown."  The only change I made to the recipe was that my husband said there should be pancetta in it, which I added.  He deemed the result perfect, and ate three big bowls. It's truly is a very simple recipe, and has made one NJ Italian boy very happy. Will I make it again?  Do I have a choice?"  Thanks, Cindy!

This was not soup at all; it was tiny pasta in thick sauce; waaaay too much sauce in this recipe - I hated this dish and will never make it again.

It's a good comfort dish and warm & hearty for a cold winter night (like tonight when I made it for the first time), but I would rename it Minestrone.  Although maybe that's because I'm used to whiter, less tomato-heavy pasta & fagioli.  I saw many of the reviewers say that they switched the ratio of chicken stock and tomato sauce, but since I'm pretty new at this cooking thing, I'm hesitant to vary from recipes.  However, since we're vegetarian, I did use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock, and I doubled the garlic for a little more flavor and health boost, and it came out well.

Delicious! Great on a rainy day! The only thing that I changed was that I added 1lb ground beef, some beef broth and fresh grated Parmesan cheese.

It was pretty good. A little too "tomatoey". I'm a vegetarian so I used veggie broth. I cut out the carrots and added salt. Next time I'll add more spices to cut the tomato taste. If I add more broth and less sauce it would be more of a soup and I didn't want that.

Delicious meal! Felt it could use more veggies so I doubled the amount and did use a little more onion. Forgot to add more liquid to compensate so mine wasn't as soupy as it could have been. Need to remember next time. I'm not a big soup person but I still thought it was great!!

I have been using this recipe for quite some time now and I now add 2 cans of the diced italian seasoned tomatoes instead of regular and 1/2 ground italian sausage and 1/2 ground beef - we are meat eaters and this makes for a truly yummy meal - especially when I add toasted garlic bread on the side. My family says it is better than Olive Garden's!

This was a very tasty, low cholesterol dish. I didn't use any basil leaves, but I was still pretty happy with the way it turned out, but I will definitely add basil the next time I make this dish.

This is SO great and healthy. I have used pureed tomato instead of tomato sauce and it turn out nice as well. Make sure your veggies and herbs are fresh if possible, it makes a world of difference. Yum Yum Yum, summer or winter soup!

Only reason I put a 4 instead of a 5 is because I changed the recipe just a bit, but still turned out amazing! I used garlic salt instead of cloves, and left out the celery and beans, simply because of personal reference. Its even more wonderful with bread! Definitely will make this again :)

I made this with a few modifications. I doubled the ingredients to serve 8. I used 1 29 oz can of tomato sauce and 4 15 oz cans of chicken broth, also put in 1 lb of cooked sliced Italian sausages. This is a very good tasting receipt worth making again and again.

We enjoyed this soup. It is nice finding new soup recipes in the winter. I will add a lot less pasta next time. Also used the suggestion of others to puree half the beans in a food processor.

Very tasty! Things I did differently: Used (1) 14 oz. can tomato sauce, (1) 14oz. can Red Gold diced tomatoes w/ garlic & onion, (2) cans chix broth and cooked pasta on the side for individual bowls to avoid the soup soaking up all of the liquid.

This soup is perfect for a cold winter night, and very easy to make!  I took another's suggestion of adding 1 1/2 cups of water to the recipe to keep it from being too saucy, and it came perfect.  I look forward to adding it to my recipe box!

Simple, quick and delicious. I followed all of the suggestions and it was fantastic with the switch of tomato sauce and chicken broth. I used a whole onion and 1/2 the amount of basil that was recommended. I will make this again.

This is just as good as Olive Garden. I was amazed at how easy this was to make.  I added a teaspoon of sugar and a 1/2 lb of beef just to have some substance to the soup and it is DELISH !!!!  Great with salad and bread sticks.

This is a great recipe.  Turned out very good.  I added Jimmy Dean Turkey Sausage links to this and it gave it what it needed.  My only recommendation is that you wait until you are ready to serve it to add the pasta.  It tends to get mushy.  And if you want some for leftovers, keep the pasta separate and add when you serve as well.

Good recipe. I used rather more chicken broth than tomato sauce & added some oregano as well. Also ran some tomatoes from our local farmer's market through a food processor for the tomato bit. It's one of those dishes that tastes even better after brewing a day or two. A really satisfying soup. Thanks!

This recipe was very easy to make and was very tasty.  I used 4 cans each of tomato sauce and chicken broth and that ended up being the perfect amount.  I like my pasta fagioli a bit on the thicker side so I added a small amount of heavy cream.  Next time I might try a bit of corn starch to make it thicker.  All in all, great recipe!

This recipe was delicious and so colorful and pleasantly satisfying!!  I loved the vegetarian friendliness!  :-)  I cut out a little of the oil and upped the garlic cloves to 1/2 TBSP per batch.  (I had to make four!)  It turned out great!  I might try with small white onions next time and experiment with other veggies.  Thank you, thank you!!

I made this for a girl's night in and it was a hit! The only changes I made were that I used about half a small onion (the recipe says one slice?)and after I had sauteed the veggies and added the liquid (I eyeballed it using some chicken stock granules), I cooked the pasta right in the broth to save time and dishes. When the pasta was al dente, I added one can of tomato sauce (15 oz. I think?) and one can of diced tomatoes with Italian herbs in it, plus the can of white beans. Oh and I also had precooked some Italian sausage and drained it realy well, and then added it at the end with the beans. I also put a couple of teaspoons of sugar to balance the tartness of the tomato. Very good recipe, especially with some crusty French bread. Will definitely make again!

I find it so irritating when someone completely changes a recipe and then gives a mediocre review. Here I am having changed the recipe but I am giving a positive review. As some suggested I switched the amounts of broth and tomato sauce, then I didn't hsve any beans except for a can of pork and beans which I used. I then used elbow macaroni for the pasta. My husband, the soup lover, liked it a lot. It would be better with the beans in the recipe but much to my surprise the pork and bean worked OK. Thanks for the good recipe.

My fiance really liked it but he likes just about anything. I was not satisfied with the way it turned out. It was just 'ok', it just tasted way too much like tomato soup. I think next time I will try it with less tomato sauce and I will steam the carrots longer so they come out softer.

I made this soup early in the morning pretty much as it was listed, but I chose to double the recipe, because in this cold weather - we can never have enough good soup!  Although I did not have enough tomato sauce in the house, I used petite diced tomatoes with garlic and the soup was fantastic.  I brought some over to my parents' house and they loved it as well!  This is a very hearty and easy soup to make and I will definitely make it again in the coming winter months.

My husband is not a lover of Italian dishes, but said "this is really good". A five star and a keeper recipe for us.  I used much more garlic than called for. I used the minced garlic. I doubled the recipe and added one pound of cooked ground beef. Served with a salad and bread. Delicious meal.

The only change I made was to reverse the amounts of broth & tomato sauce - that was dead on.  It came out OK, but I have so many other soup recipes that are just as easy/if not easier that come out much better.  Alterations I would recommend to others if you want to make it:  Do not stir the ditalini into the soup - it absorbs all the broth and any leftovers are mushy pasta with veggies.  Also, add some chicken or sausage to the soup.  I just found it to be bland and probably won't make this recipe again.  Not worth spending an hour cooking something that's just OK. Sorry.

I made this really hoping it would taste like the Olive garden soup and hoping my kids and husband would like it alot. Well I didnt have all the herbs so I just used powered garlic and mrs. dash original and salt and pepper. I also only used three cans of tomatoe sauce and added a 1/2 cup of water to the soup. It turned out pretty good but my kids and hubby didnt like it at all. I liked it but didnt love it like I was hoping. I think It might have tasted better if I had all the right ingredients.

This was GREAT!  Everyone loved it.  I did make a few changes but nothing radical.  I increased the garlic and added some crushed red pepper.  I did not reverse the tomato and chicken broth because we like the tomato taste but I did increase the chicken broth to almost equal amounts.  I would highly recommend using low sodium products or at least a mix of low sodium and regular.  
Boy was this easy and good!!

This was fabulous-I couldn't stop eating it!  I didn't have canned chicken broth so use Chicken Boullion.  I will probably use more liquid next time as it did get pretty thick after sitting awhile.  The flavor was perfect, a definite keeper thanks for a great recipe to add to my regulars.

This was pretty good.  It wasn't any better than the vegetable based soup that I make.  I would definitely recommend swapping the portions of chicken broth and tomato sauce.  I did as others suggested and it came out fine.

I hit a few road blocks making this, and made some adjustments. But overall my rating is based on the general idea of the recipe. I think its wonderful and I will definitely be making it again and adjusting it all different ways. I added some cooked ground beef to mine and turned it into a one dish meal that came together in minutes! Even better, my man loved it.

This was really good.  I added more garlic, more onion and prepared the remainder as written.  Really nice soup.  Next time, however, I would use less pasta (perhaps just 1 C)

Very tasty & easy to make.  My husband & I enjoyed this.  I followed some of the other reviewers' advice & traded the amounts of tomato sauce & chicken broth.  I'm glad I did as the consistency would have been too thick. I also omitted the celery out of personal preference. I'd like to try 1 reviewer's suggestion  & include some diced tomatoes the next time I make it.

Flavor was great!!  I too followed the recommended changes from other reviews:  15 oz. diced tomatoes, 15 oz. tomato sauce, 32 oz chicken broth.  I omitted the celery since my family does not like cooked celery.  I could not find ditalini pasta, so used small shells I had on hand.  My mother-in-law stopped by and tasted it and asked for the recipe.  Although other reviewers mentioned their kids eating this up, mine wouldn't try it, but they don't try many new things (they are 1, 3, and 4).  Looking forward to the leftovers and trying with it with hamburger some time.

For the most part I did follow the recipe, but I did make a few variations...And I too switched the ratio of tomato sauce and chicken broth (Swanson's makes a 99% fat free/low sodium option-I used that). It ended up being like a 2:1 ratio (Broth:Sauce). And I minced fresh basil-rather than dried...about one stem of leaves plus a few extra larger leaves... I really like basil! And I used two large cloves of garlic, diced fine. And I added a small tomoato to the veggies when I sauted them in the skillet.  Also, I added about half the broth to my skillet(rather than saute in a sauce pan) and let it simmer for a few minutes, then I poured it into a stock pan along with the rest of the broth and sauce.  Then in the same skillet, I browned a lb of ground round(85-15 fat content ratio...), which I seasoned with fresh ground black pepper, and added that into the stock pot after draining it. I salted the stock pot to taste with fresh ground sea salt-again less sodium. I didn't cook the pasta all the way, but drained it and added it to the stock pot. Then I let it simmer on the lowest setting, stirring occasionally, from about 2:00 on. My husband had the first bowl at 6:00 and said it was GREAT! Then he asked if he could take a container to one of his friends at work who is a bachelor!!!  =)  Thanks for a great recipe!

O my goodness, this was the best soup ever! This is the closest thing to the Pasta Fagioli that I eat at my favorite Italian restaurant. My whole family could not stop eating it! I followed the recipe except for a couple of minor changes. I used 2 cans of tomato sauce and then used 2 cans of chicken broth and 2 cans of beef broth. Also I included a whole small chopped onion instead of the 1 ring. Overall this was an excellent and easy recipe. Will definitely be making this one again!
