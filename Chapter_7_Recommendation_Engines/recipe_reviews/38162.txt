This salad was terrific.  I added corn and black beans and few more spices and omitted the anchovies.  I brought this to a Southwest/Mexican themed dinner party and it was a hit!  One word of caution: it makes a lot of dressing and I made the mistake of dumping it all on the salad and tossing before serving.  The lettuce was kinda soaked in dressing.  Next time, I will add a little at a time and toss just until the lettuce is coated or serve the dressing on the side.

Very tasty!!!
I made a few modifications: Since it's freezing rain outside I passed on grilling the chicken. LOL. I cubed it, marinated it in the fajita seasoning and then stir-fryed it. I added the diced peppers towards the end (rather than adding raw to the lettuce).
Let's see...I also skipped that anchovies. :)
One last thing, be careful when reading the "1 canned chipotle pepper". I almost read it as "1 can of chipotle peppers" !! Whoa !! That would'a been bad.
Good stuff!! Try this one, for sure. :)

Outstanding salad and dressing, Myra! We totally enjoyed this combination. I added some cumin to the dressing, and a can of drained kidney beans to the salad. Other than that, we thought this dish was perfect. It has become one of our all time favorite salads.

I took out the chicken, but I did make the salad dressing as the recipe said. It was excellent if you like a little bit of bite to your foods. I really enjoyed this recipe...it was one of my first attempts at making my own salad dressing since I usually just use the pre-made ones. One warning...I fed six people with the amount of salad dressing that was given...and had a huge quantity left over.

Yum! Very decadent, but very tasty dressing.  Next time I will definately use low fat mayo & sour cream, but I just had to try it as is the first time around.  My only change was to use a fresh chopped jalapeno instead of the canned chipotle.  FYI - let you dressing sit out for a bit before using...otherwise it's pretty solidified.  Thanks!

This was an easy recipe.  I used all fat free ingredients and it still turned out good.  I also added black beans and mexican corn.

Wonderful Myra!! Had to make a very quick and easy dinner last night and this fit the bill. I had leftover chicken in the fridge which saved time. Don't like anchovies so I left those out and made homemade croutons from this site. Hubby and kids loved it!

Dreadful. We took one bite and threw it out. Completely surprised by this one. Thought the ingredients sounded so good. Didn't put the chicken in the dish, just made a regular caesar salad. Way too spicy.

OMG!!!  This salad is sooooo good!!  I prepared it for a family outing and we couldn't stop eating it.  The dressing is ABSOLUTE FABULOUSNESS!! The right amount of spicy and sweet and crunch from the chipotle peppers, mayo/mustard and bell peppers.  I added tomatoes, avocado, corn and black beans to the mix.  I will definitely be making this again and again!!

Absolutely delicious!  I made this salad to go along with the steak and potato Father's Day dinner we fixed for my Dad.  I followed the recipe to a T and everyone loved it!  My Dad even said that was the best part of the whole meal!  I know that some reviewers felt that the dressing tasted too mayonnaise-y, but I didn't find that to be the case at all.  I think you have to be careful and make sure that you use the grated Parmesan cheese (comes in the canister and looks like a powder) when you're making the dressing.  Then use the shredded Parmesan (out of the refrigerated section) to sprinkle on top of your finished salad.  Most delish!  I think next time I'll add the corn and black beans, too.  That sounds really good.

Dressing could be halved.  Used light mayo and light sour cream, and tortilla strips instead of croutons.  I like the idea of the corn and black beans, which I will try the next time.

Everyone in the family gobbled this up and we all wanted more of the dressing.  Delicious to the extreme.  I make lots of salad with grilled chicken on greens, so I wasn't expecting a whole lot new and I was blown away.  This dressing is a complete keeper and I'll be making this again and again.

This was very good & looked great too.  I took it to a party, and it got good reviews there.  I admitted the canned pepper and added a whole jalapeno to the dressing, and it turned out a little too spicy for my taste.  Next time, I'll cut that back.  Otherwise, it was great!

Wow... this dressing is amazing!  It's also flexible.  I used fat-free mayonnaise and low-fat sour cream to make it a little healthier.  I also omitted the anchovy fillets, but added a few drops of fish sauce (made from anchovies).  Remember that your salad dressing container must have a large enough opening to allow the Parmesan cheese to get through!

This was excellent. As good as you get out at a restaurant. The dressing was to die for. I could easily see that being a new favorite veggie dip. I am definitely making again - maybe next time will try with grilled shrimp! Thanks for sharing.

Excellent.  My husband loved it.  I definately included the anchovie (paste) because it adds a lot to the flavor (and it's not a fishy flavor for those who are afraid of it) and is an ingredient of traditional Caesar Salad.  I halved the dressing for one head of romaine, and it was perfect.  Just the right amount of spice with 1/2 chipotle.  I also added corn and black beans.

My family had this as a quick "lupper" yesterday. It was fast and easy and VERY tastey. Even my son who doesn't much like salads loved it. I used jalapenos for the hot pepper and held the anchovies. I added tinned corn and sliced black olives. It was sweet,salty and spicy. Would be awesome served in a tortilla bowl. mmmmmm next time!

The dressing is fabulous!  I've made it twice now, and made a double batch this time since it went so fast the first.  I didn't use anchovies either.

This was pretty good. I added corn and black beans and I rolled everything up in a wrap :) I suggest to go easy on the mayo at first...you can always add-you can't take away :)Even though I only used a 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, I thought the sauce was a little bit too mayonnaise-y...I think cream cheese would be better. I threw in some fresh cilantro too...which makes every Mexican dish taste fantabulous!! (IMO) This recipe is definitely worth trying :)

OMG!!!! this is fantastic! I omitted the anchovies. If you like it hot, leave the seeds in the chipotle when doing the dressing, if you like it more mild, cut pepper in half and run your knife along the inside and scrape away the seeds. You will still get a good smokey flovor without all of the heat. Also I added black beans and corn and instead of croutons I had added crushed blue corn tortillas instead. In the dressing I added some cumin and a pinch of salt. Since I added parm cheese in the dressing I had crumbled some mexican cotija on the salad instead and garnished with avacado slices. What a quick and easy meal. Tastes like alot of work went into it, we loved it!

Loved the salad. Husband thought it a bit to spicy.  Followed the dressing to the tee. Added about 1/2 cup of Birdeys's Mexican veggies and put the salad into a fried tortilla shells and instead of croutons, some fried strips of tortillas. Excellent!

This salad recipe was great. A few people said they added corn, which I did as well, I also added sliced avocado. I had to make a substitution because I forgot to pick up chipotle peppers. I used chipotle mayo instead of regular mayo. It actually worked out really well.

This is a keeper! So delicious! I made a couple substitutions based on what I had available but it was so good. I threw a jalapeño & a couple cobs of corn on the grill with the chicken. I used the jalapeño (without the seeds) in place of the canned pepper and only had fresh cilantro so that went in the dressing instead of the parsley. I also squeezed half a lime into the dressing and let it sit overnight before I put the salad together to serve.

I made it exactly as the recipe states, but neither I or my husband cared for the dressing. Way too much onion and not very spicy. We also thought it was too thick.

I think this is a great recipe! Made it exactly - omitting the anchovy's.  It does make a lot of dressing - enough to use more than once.

I added some black beans and corn as another reviewer suggested. And I am glad I did.  The dressing was really thick, but delicious!  I did not add the anchovies.

I'd love to try your salad but I haven't heard of chipotle pepper here down under!  Can you tell me what it is, please, or something that can be substituted for it.  Thanks.
