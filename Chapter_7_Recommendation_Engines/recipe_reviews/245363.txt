This is an absolutely delicious salad.  I used Envy apples for the time of year and i was outstanding!  The celery root is important for texture though it doesn't add much actual flavor.   Be careful to not use all the dressing.  You can even cut that recipe in half as I tossed about 2/3 of it.  It's delicious but you definitely don't want to ruin this salad with too much dressing.  The fruits stand alone.  I will make this again.

Salad turned out great. I added BBQed chicken breast and I didn't have celery root so I used celery. I  only wished that I had chopped everything smaller because I used it to stuff a hollowed out papaya. I was trying to emulate a dish that I had on Qantas Airline in 1980 on my way to Australia. My husband said it was a 10 so I gave it 5 stars.

Good! I had pecans instead of walnuts and regular celery (used a ton of that). Yes, it made more dressing than needed in this one salad. 
Plated bit of cole slaw greens under the waldorf blend, added romaine around the edges, and sliced rotisserie chicken on top.  Yum!! Family loved it although they were critical at first.

Tasty with nice additions to the traditional recipe. While the celery root was not objectionable, I think the CRUNCH of celery adds a nicer contrast in a dish that's largely about the contrasting textures of the ingredients.
