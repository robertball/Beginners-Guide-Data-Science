Easy and delicious - perfect for a quick lunch! I added some cherry tomatoes that I sliced in half for a little color and flavor. I also added some croutons that I had on hand. I used "Mama's Balsamic Vinaigrette" from this site. Not sure if I'd heat the salad dressing again though...

Simply excellent.  Beautiful, colorful, delicious with very compatible ingredients. I opted to use thinly sliced red onion and my own homemade Lemon Dijon Vinaigrette.  Who knew it would taste so good heated and drizzled over a spinach salad?

A very nice salad!  I think warming the dressing was a nice idea, but I will say that once the dressing hits the cold spinach, it doesn’t stay warm for long.  Maybe I didn’t get mine hot enough?  I followed the recipe, just eyeballing the ingredients for two salads.  I added grape tomatoes, because I had them, and I liked the color they provided.  I forgot to add the parmesan, but that would have been good as well.  All in all this is a nice combination of flavors and one I wouldn’t hesitate to make again!

I made this for guests tonight and it was really good.  My husband, who doesn't like spinach had seconds.  I used red onions, and Newman's Light Balsamic dressing.  Very good, and good for us too!  Thanks for the recipe.

If you haven't tried this recipe you are missing out.  Fixed it tonight with salmon.  Yummy!  I did make a few changes.  I do not like onions so they were omitted.  I used turkey bacon to cut down on the calories.  The warm Italian dressing (ken's Zesty Italian) poured on at the last minute with a sprinkle of Parmesan Cheese was a hit.  Can't wait to make this again.

I didn't make this exactly according to the recipe but I still give it 5 stars because it was really good. I used spinach, two boiled eggs, parm cheese, and sauteed red onions. Topped with creamy balsamic vinaigrette.

Made this to go with our spaghetti last night, very good, and really easy. Followed the directions, everything worked together nicely. Will be making again.

This was wonderful!  I changed the recipe a little.  Did not use the bacon or the egg.  Instead I used dried sun dried tomatoes and pine nuts and used an all natural creamy balsamic.  It was amazing!  I will be making this again...today!

Great and easy!  Used fat free dressing and turkey bacon.  Will leave out the egg next time- personal preference.  I found it easier to make individual salads with 1 piece bacon each.  Who knew warmed up dressing could make a simple salad so delicious!

Left out onions, added cherry tomatoes & this was the best spinach salad!  As good or better than anything served at a high class restaurant.  Will definitely be making it again!

This was a very simple & enjoyable salad that when finished looks so pretty.  I did add an extra hard boiled egg (one just wasn't cutting it) & an extra piece of bacon (I had 4 to use up, so I figured it couldn't hurt).  I served this with the Italian Salad Dressing Mix from AR & it was a hit with the gals...the guys didn't really touch it, but I expected that would happed anyways.  ;)  Thanks for sharing...will make this one again...!!

Made it exactly as the recipe says. I had my grandson help by putting the ingredients together in the bowl. He now calls it "MY spinach salad." He asks for it again and again -- and he eats lots of it every time! I used a bottle of Italian dressing and just warmed up a bit in the microwave. FANTASTIC.

Although I forgot the egg and tossed the spinach over some heat for a few seconds with the italian dressing to wilt it, everything else was the same. My husband ate it all and asked for more.

That is good enough for me to make it again. The bacon makes this great.
