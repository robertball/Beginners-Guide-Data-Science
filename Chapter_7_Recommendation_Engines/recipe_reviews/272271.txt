This was delicious.  The neck bones are not easy to find.  One comment about the steps.  It’s missing the step for putting the meat back in before the end.  In step one it has you remove the meat and set it aside.  Then at the end it has you remove the bones from the pot to separate the meat.  Where is the step in between?

Delicious, foolproof recipe! I used ham hock instead of pork neck bone since I couldn’t find it, and it turned out really good!

I will definitely make this again!  The most authentic New Orleans taste.  Couldn't find neck bones so just used a couple of bone in pork chops and it was delicious!
