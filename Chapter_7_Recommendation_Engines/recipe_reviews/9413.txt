DO NOT double this recipe!! I was making it for gifts for about twelve people and so I doubled the ingredients.  Big mistake, I found out after my jelly did not set that you are never supposed to double a jelly or jam recipe.  I hope this will save another first time jelly maker from making this mistake.

HOT...SWEET...my jelly set up nice and quick. Try boiling ingredients on medium heat for 10 minutes, add pectin and boil for 5 minutes. Also, I used fresh jalapenos. 1 1/2 pounds. Don't forget the gloves and glasses.

Great recipe.  I substituted apple cider vinegar for white, which gave it a nice flavor.  I also used one green, one yellow, and one orange pepper to vary up the colors a bit and left out the green food coloring (turned out a clear-yellowish color).  I think the key to getting the jelly to set, is to load your diced peppers into a towel and squeeze out all the excess liquid.

The orginal recipe is very tasty and is a good base to experiment. Any true "pepper-head" will want to upgrade to serrano peppers  (or hotter) and increase the cayenne (I went to 1.5 tbs). For a sweeter Jelly stir in an additional cup of sugar before the pectin. One additional tip, don't use cheap vinegar, final taste is compromised.

Very good taste!  It was enough for eight 250ml jars.  
For all you cooks north of the border:  6 fluid ounces liquid pectin translates to 170 ml (two packages at 85 ml).

Wonderful Recipe! This is sooo easy to make and the flavor is WONDERFUL!! I am asked repeatedly for this recipe. My entire family enjoys it and I have to make it year round. Delicious with cream cheese and tortilla chips or crackers. I use my Quisinart to mince/mix the peppers  before adding them to the saucepan.Both green & red bell peppers make an attractive jelly. I can make this in 30 minutes or less.Thank you Brenda!

I love the flavor of this jelly. Although, I have tried four different times to make it and it will not set up. I have followed the directions to the "T" and nothing. It makes a good sauce.

Not sure why but my jelly didn't set well.  Stayed pretty runny.  not sure what I did wrong, I followed the recipe exactly.  Still tasted good though.  Just wasn't something I wanted to give away as gifts -- who wants runny jelly?

I have doubled, tripled and quadrupled a similar recipe with Great results.  If it does not set, the jelly was cooked longer than necessary after the pectin was added.  You can boil it again and add the pectin again, and only boil for 1 minute after it reaches the boiling point.   I learned the hard way and called the pectin help line for the asnwer. Good Luck!!

to those who have had trouble with the jelly setting, use 7 whole jalapeno peppers that are raw and puree them with the other peppers in the vinegar,not canned.Too much liquid. To those south of the Mason Dixon line, it is standard procedure to have it at any get together. Fantastic!

Made two batches of the recipe to give as Christmas gifts this year. The reviews are in and it is a big hit with everyone. I had no problems with the jelly setting up. I used Certo brand liquid Pectin and drained some excess water from the pepper before boiling. I also boiled for several minutes before adding the pectin.  I made one batch with approximately 8 oz. of fresh chopped and seeded jalapeno peppers, green bell peppers, and a few drops of green food coloring. This batch turned out a bright green. It has a good jalapeno flavor and just a hint of heat.   The second batch I used red bell peppers, red serrano peppers,  and a few drops of red food coloring. This version was sweeter than the green and the sweet taste of the red bell pepper was a bit stronger than the bite of the serrano. This batch turned out a strong and bright ruby red color.   I also used Cider Vinegar in both versions and highly recommend that. I prefer it over white vinegar in almost all my canning recipes.

I have made this jelly a couple of times and absolutely love it! Instead of 3 green bell pepper I added a red one, a green one and a pablano chili pepper. I put the bell peppers in my food processor then put it in a bowl with paper towls to pull out some of the moisture. This seemed to help with it setting. I also did not add the food coloring. With the different colored peppers it looks beautiful in the jars. I found that boiling it longer then 5 minutes helped it set alot better also. Overall a great jelly! :)

Don't panic if your hard work doesn't set up. If you are in Canada, use certo brand liquid pectin. It works best for this recipe. And don't forget to process jars in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes after filling. I used 4 large red bell peppers and 7 green jalapeno peppers. The red pepper flavor is what I set out to accomplish along with the sweet and wonderful taste of the jalapeno peppers. I left in some jalapeno seeds and added the cayenne. Very Nice....and Loved by everyone. Hope this helps.............cheers!

I used 2 fresh jalepeno peppers (in lieu of the canned pappers) seeded and deveined along with the bell peppers. Instead of mincing, I cut them in large chunks so they could easily be scooped out after the allotted time for cooking and just prior to adding either green or red food coloring. The jelly is then beautifully clear which I prefer when giving as gifts and I don't have to worry with turning it to evenly distribute the pepper flecks and it does not alter the taste at all. It is absolutely delicious as a condiment for pork, chicken, or with the ever lovely cream cheese and crackers!  It's a staple at my house for Super Bowl Sunday and even the little kids enjoy it! Not too hot or too sweet. We love it.  Many thanks for a great recipe.

7 times I have used this recipe and it has never failed. Use the right amounts of sugar and make sure you boil the pectin for the right time, 5 min, it will set.  I used 4-6 fresh jalapenos with half the seeds removed to replace the cans.  I placed all the peppers in the food processor but didnt quite puree it and left some of the peppers chunky. I got great compliments and everyone thought it looked better than just clear.

Delicious!  I used 3 red bell peppers, about 1 cup minced  fresh jalapenos w/ seeds and 1 tsp cayenne. I bought a box of Certo liquid pectin (2 pouches - net wt 6 oz.  That means 3 oz each.  I used only one pouch.  Set up once cooled (2 hours,)

This is soooo good!  I just made it tonight and literally licked the pot!  It made seven jars complete which was a nice surprise (or maybe not since I didn't have any that I had to put in the fridge right away!). I preserve my jalapeno peppers by roasting them in the oven, mincing them, and then freezing them.  I break of chunks as I need so I just used some of these. Also, I didn't have any green food coloring so I used about seven drops of red. It looks gorgeous in the jars! I can't wait to serve this with cream cheese! Thanks for a great recipe!

The best pepper jelly I've had. Boiled for 10 min, then 5 min w pectin. Used 2  jumbo & 3 medium red peppers & 7oz jalapeno's so increased sugar to 7 cups. This made 5 small canning jars  & 1 lg 645 ml jar of jelly, about 1/3 of store cost. Check reduced produce section of your store too!

This was my first time making jelly, and I couldn't be happier.  WOW!  This stuff is delicious.  I appreciate all the comments, even the negative ones, because I feel like I've benefited from others.  Thanks especially to the ones who mentioned how they substituted fresh peppers ... because that's where I got the idea to make pepper jelly!  Someone gave us about 10 lbs of jalapenos ... and I know EXACTLY where they're all going to end up!

Every year I make jams, jellies, and other preserves as Christmas gifts.  This year, I included this jelly.  It was absolutely fabulous!  Instead of using canned jalapenos, I substituted for the same amount of fresh jalapenos.  I saved one jar for myself, which was opened and finished Christmas Eve and I made another batch so I could enjoy all the jars, for myself ... at least until the end of January. It is very good with pate and crackers with any kind of cheese.  You can spread it on lamb, or any other kind of meat.  I can't wait to try it on chicken.

This is an excellent recipe.  I used 2 red peppers and 1 green with only 1 drop of red food coloring.  The reason I decided to write a review is to say that the jelly does set if you follow the directions HOWEVER, you have to use fresh jalapeno's AND pat dry when done dicing the peppers.  I set mine right out on Bounty paper towels to absorb all the liquid.  I have made the recipe 2 times now with no issues.  The second time I did use less sugar.  It is very good.  I highly recommend.

I could not finish making this Jelly.  I have chronic bronchitis, and the Jalapeno peppers caused me to cough so much that I could not continue.  That may be a warning to people with alergies or chronic bronchitis. I am sorry, but I think I would have liked that Jelly.  I do eat Jalapenos frequently, but 1 or 2 do not seem to bother me.

As other reviewers have said this recipe needs double the amount of pectin to solidify. The flavor is awesome as written, but you won't have a jelly consistency unless you double the pectin.

Nice recipe. I used I of each Yellow, Red, and green pepper (approx cup and a half each) I cooked mine 5 min after boiling and actually got 7 small jars of jelly. I just cracked one open after 3 hours and consistency is nice. Has a great bite ( I left the seeds in) I may try it with minus a cup of sugar next time. It tastes good on a Ritz cracker with Beer. Very nice.

This is delicious.  I can't wait to share it with friends.  After reading the reviews I was worried about it setting up so I did follow the instuctions to cook 10 min, add the pectin and cook another 5 min.  Mine is almost too set up.  Next time I will try pre-cooking 5 min instead of 10.

This is the first time I have made jelly and I am so glad I chose this recipe!  It's in my favorite's box for sure!  My boyfriend went through all 6 jars in less than two weeks because he just couldn't stay out of it!!!  I think I am going to make these for gifts for Christmas.  I don't like hot stuff at all.  If it makes my mouth warm, that's hot enough, this jelly was wonderful not hot but just enough kick to make it special,  Thank you for sharing this. Angela

Prepared exactly as directed. I did make sure that all liquid was drained and dry out of both peppers. I used my vita mix to chop green peppers. They need to be really small pieces. After canning and while cooling I lightly turned jars upside down and back once in a while to keep peppers from floating to top. I like this jelly because it's not to hot. Just hot enough for me. If you like it hotter Read other reviews.

I had fresh jalapenos to use--so, I used about 8 oz of fresh.  Way too hot!!  I'm hoping it will mellow.  It took forever to set.  I thought I was going to have to redo it.  But, overnight they set up. I also chopped everything in the food processor-makes the job go much faster! I also used cider vinegar and didn't add the cayenne, thankfully!

I followed this recipe very carefully, but mine did not set up in the end.  It was like a sauce.  Wish I knew why because I would like to try it again.

I made this recipe and by mistake only used 1/2 the amount of pectin called for, it still turned out very nice. I have given out for gifts and gotten nothing but rave reviews...and requests for me to make more!

very good jelly I also had excess fresh jalapenos.  I threw the seeded peppers and the red peppers in the blender.  Then I followed the recipe after than; it turned out great.  Putting this jelly on a cream cheese covered cracker is addicting.  Thanks for the recipe!

After a bumper crop of peppers I made this jelly.  12 hours in it's still kind of runny (taste is good) will use anyway and tweak as needed.  Used red & green jalapenos. seeded & put seeds in chesescloth & cooked in syrup mixture for added heat (removed before filling jars,) flipped jars about every 4 hours for good distibution of pepper pieces, very pretty.

This was a fun recipe. I used my own peppers from the garden, and unfortunately by the time the jelly was finished, it didn't really have much heat to it, even though I left most of the ribs and seeds in. I used red, orange, and yellow bell peppers instead of green; that's what I had on hand. Overall, I think this worked well.. remember, if you use smaller apples, you may need either more apples or else let it boil down further for the proper pectin amount to let it set. I also made a batch with serrano peppers, and used a few less because of the heat. I will use this recipe again.

First time jelly maker!!  This jelly has a really neat sweet/hot taste and turned out rather pretty!  I made this jelly and pomegranate jelly to give as gifts this year for Christmas (red and green).  I can't believe I did it and I can't wait to see what my family has to say!  Thanks a lot - I definately recommend this recipe to others.

The balance between the "sweet" and the "heat" is excellant. People are amazed at the great flavor. A great accompaniment to pork or chicken. I used 1/2# of fresh jalepenos.

I have found using a candy thermometer will make setting up foolproof. Bring the temp up to 220 degrees, add the pectin (liquid), and boil for 1 more minute.

Excellent results, thank you for sharing.  Itook all the seeds and membrane out, so I was lacking the heat I desired. This years batch I will leave some seeds in.  Thank you for sharing.

I don't have any trouble with this recipe setting into jelly consistency.  If you are using Certo brand liquid fruit pectin in a box, you need to use the entire box (2 pouches) of pectin which equals 6 fl oz. 

I also customize this recipe and use about 12 or more fresh jalapenos chopped in a food processor in lieu of bell peppers and canned jalapenos.  Adding green food coloring makes it a pretty gem color.

I loved the flavor of this, but I do feel like the green bell peppers may have stolen the show.  I might try yellow or red next time and see how that goes.  I also made the mistake of scraping out the seeds and my jelly had no kick at all.  My family definitely wants the kick so I am going to have to process the jalapenos to get the seeds in there as well.  Overall, very good recipe!

I followed this recipe to the "T" and it did not set up.  Sadly I had to cook it again following the " if your jelly did not set" instructions as provided in the pectin box.  It did set, but now I am afraid to taste it as I had to add lemon juice and more sugar to get it to set...hhhmmm. We'll see.

This is the best Pepper Jelly made by anyone, anywhere, at any time.  I put in equal amounts of Jalapenos and Sweet Red Peppers and it is just the right amount of heat and sweet.  Can't wait to serve it to my friends.  Thanks so much.

Great taste and texture. Made during Christmas so, I did follow the suggestion about red bell peppers, making a very festive green and red mixture. It went very fast and many guests took home the extra jars as gifts. thanks!!

I absolutely love this recipe!  It was super easy to make and took no time at all.  This was the first time I ever tried making a jelly, but defintely not my last!  I gave the first 2 jars to my family to try and they loved it and took 2 more!  Thanks for the great recipe Brenda!

This is such a good recipe! I used fresh jalapeno's instead of cans, I added about 9 of them, seeds in, and skipped the cayenne. My jelly didn't set, but I figured out what happened. I used too small a pot (allow the jelly to really expand- more than double), so I couldn't keep it at a full rolling boil for the 5 minutes. When my jelly didn't set, I poured it all back into a really gigantic soup pot, re-boiled it and added an extra package of pectin crystals. After that, no problem. I will make this recipe again.

Great stuff - easy - let the peppers drain thru a screen to get the water out - I used a blender and it did a good job mincing the peppers - gonna make another batch ASAP and kick up the heat a little - ROCKIN Y

This recipe is better with fresh Jalapeno's cut up and this is why Katieklg your jelly didn't set.  Too much juice from the canned Jalapenos.

This is a great recipe.  Everything worked out fine with the pectin.  Set really nice.  The only thing that I will do differently next time is add more fresh Jalapeno's. My family and I like a little more heat, but it was still very delicious.

I make this all the time, however, instead of cayenne pepper I use red pepper flakes, FRESH JALAPENOS is a must, and I also add about a good tbls. of seeds from my peppers.

Oh darn, mine did not set, and I had to open all the jars and add pectin and cook longer. I'm sorry to say, that I won't be making this one again, it's just too much sugar, too sweet ! I've had better. :(

The flavor of this is wonderful! I had a problem with it gelling though, it turned out more like a sauce.  I halved the recipe though so that might have caused the problem.

AWESOME recipe! Very easy to make and DELICIOUS! I use about half the amount of peppers for a milder jelly. I also use my food processor to mince the peppers. Makes a great gift! Can't go wrong with this recipe!

This jelly is wonderful! My sister & I have made 4 batches of it to give to family & friends. Everyone loves it! We made 1 batch without the cayenne pepper to use as strictly a sweet & sour sauce. YUMMY!!!

So good, and easy to make.  I used up a giant bowl of peppers I picked from the garden just before the first frost.  Everyone who tries it loves it.
