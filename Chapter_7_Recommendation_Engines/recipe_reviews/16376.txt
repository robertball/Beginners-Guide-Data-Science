This pie is surprisingly good!  I used the ingredients as written and mixed everything in my KA food processor. When filling the pie plate,  I was afraid the pie would overflow because I didn't know how much it would actually puff.  I made the whole pie and 4 small tarts. I could have added a little more filling in the large pie.  This is a super easy recipe.  Thank you Debbie for sharing!  We are enjoying it!

This is an amazingly easy pie to make! I have made some small adjustments to make it dairy free and gluten free for our needs. I use 1 1/2 cups lemon lime soda and 1/2 cup coconut milk for the liquid, and I omit the milk powder. Then I used gluten free flour instead of the baking mix. It turns out fabulous!

What a wonderful pie.  I didn't know what to expect.  Cooked mine in a pie dish and it fit perfectly.  Cooked 10 minutes longer than directed to make sure it was thoroughly cooked and I was getting some nice browning on top. Loved that there was a bottom crust, custard in the middle and crunchy coconut top crust. All prepared in a single container.... the blender! Will definitely make again. Very unique!

This was so easy and I'm all about that! I took it to my gourmet ladies luncheon and it got rave reviews.  They ALL loved it. It's great just like it is but it's also a base custard to add flavors to.  I sprinkled a lot of cinnamon on it. You can put fruit, sauces, lemon curd etc etc on it.  Best of all. It's easier than easy.

This pie is amazing! Easy to make & so delicious & moist! I also tried it with a graham cracker crust & it was amazing. I had a little mixture left over in the blender, so I put the rest in a greased muffin pan.  Everyone loved it...our new fave!!

Very tasty pie, bakeing mix makes its own crust, and the "filling" is sweet, with a hint of zest
