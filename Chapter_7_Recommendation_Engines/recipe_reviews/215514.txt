This is DELICIOUS! I made a few substitutions: dried figs (instead of dates), dried thyme and basil (instead of fresh), and I added pine nuts to the stuffing mixture. Next time I might try it without the prosciutto, because I think it would be just as good.

Because this recipe sounded so good, I decided to give it a try. OMG! It was wonderful. I live in a small town and couldn't find any goat cheese so I used plain havartti instead. Also, I could only find prosciutto in 3" x 7" slices. So I used two slices per breast and wrapped them lengthwise ~~ overlapping the ends under the bottom. Thus, there was no need for toothpicks. For the last 5 minutes of baking, I turned the breasts back so the ends were on the bottom again, and broiled for 4-5 minutes. I served this with oven baked red potatoes and Strawberry and Feta Salad from this site.

Delicious recipe! The prosciutto kept the chicken moist and delicious. I made this for a friends gathering and substituted the goat cheese with feta because I knew some guest were not a fan of goat cheese. The feta worked just as well. I did a light feta so that it did not over power the salty flavour of the prosciutto. Loved the combination of the herbs! I will definitely be making this again!

I had to cheat this recipe a lot, but it still turned out wonderful. Namely, I didn't have prosciutto or dates, and used (nothing) and apples instead. My wife was beaming after eating this delicious meal!

This turned out perfectly. The recipe was easy to follow and the dates really added a tasty sweetness to the meal. I found the goat cheese really mellowed out as it baked. Wonderful!

I made this for the first time on Monday and I made it again on Wednesday.  I added 2 extra dates and a little extra basil the second time.  These flavors are amazing together.  I wouldn't omit anything in this recipe. I was told it was the best meal someone had ever eaten.  Very impressive.  I served it with garlic roasted mashed potatoes and asparagus the first time and the second time I served it with mashed cauliflower and asparagus.  This is definitely my new favorite.

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would!  Oh My Goodness - this is divine!! Any soooo easy to do.  I subbed feta for the goat cheese, and green onions for the shallots.  With or without dates, it's excellent so don't make a special trip to the store if you don't have them.  I made this ahead of time in the morning, refrigerated it for the day and then cooked it at 400 for about 20-25 minutes (using very large chicken breasts). The chicken was juicy and tender, and the prosciutto was nice and crispy.  Perfect for an elegant dinner party.  I served it with mashed sweet potatoes and buttered green beans...but this would go nicely with any side.  I will definitely be making this again.

I know it's never fair to rate a recipe based on changes that are made, but I'm going to anyway! This was so delicious and the chicken was so tender and juicy! I halved the recipe for a dinner for two for hubby and I. I used all dried herbs since garden season in Ohio hasn't started yet. I didn't have dates on hand but instead used a good handful of craisons that I chopped up very fine...wow the craisons gave the herbed goat cheese mixture and incredible flavor! I wrapped them in turkey bacon instead of prosciutto because prosciutto is difficult to find around here and expensive when it is found. I served it with a strawberry and feta salad, also from this site and the end result was fabulous!! My husband begged me to make it again!

Moist and delicious! Didn't have dates handy so substituted with toasted pine nuts.  Used dried oregano and basil in addition to the thyme and tied the bacon wrapped roti with twine to secure.  Baked one chicken breast for 30 minutes (turned after 15 min.) and broiled for another 5 minutes (turn at 3 min.).  The end product was absolutely delicious, flavorful and moist. Will make again!

This was pretty darn good! I was surprised by the sweetness of the dates and how the flavor meshed well with the herbs. I also used feta cheese as a substitute for goat cheese, since I love the flavor. Goat cheese may have been a better melty cheese. I will definitely make this again.

Loved it and didn't have the fresh herbs. I used dried herbs ( herbs de provance) and dried figs instead. Me and my husband loved it and all three kids did not like it at all, so keep that in mind when you are making it for the family. Better served as a nice dinner when you have guests. YUM!

I followed this recipe to the letter but the chicken was FAR too overcooked (and my oven has been calibrated, so it wasn't that).  I should have trusted my gut instinct but second-guessed myself because of the stuffing inside.  It should have come out of the oven 10 minutes earlier.  The flavor was very good, so I will likely make it again but will definitely cut back on cook time.

We thought this was delicious. I did find it a little salty though, so next time will increase the dates to off set the salt and maybe reduce the added salt as well.

One of the best things I have ever made, and I use this site at least 4 times a week.  A HUGE favorite of my husband, easy and quick for company, I used figs because I didnt have dates and it was still a 5star dish, next time I will try as intended.  THANK YOU!

This is a very good recipe. My son enjoyed it very much. I rated it only three stars based on my husband and I because I must admit we are not cheese fans and the filling did not excite us.  I must however say that if you are a fan of cheese, you will love the texture of the chicken and the little salty touch of the prosciutto is really good.  I used two slices of prosciutto because my breasts were quite big.

Made for a dinner party, served with grilled asparagus and rice pilaf. It was a hit. Tons of compliments and the plates looked as if they had been licked clean. I had to send hubby back to store for more prosciutto, though, as each piece of chicken needed 2 slices. I bought big pieces of chicken because I thought they would be easier to make a pocket in. The prosciutto stays on nicely with no toothpicks and keeps the yummy filling in. I made the recipe exactly as written. Thanks, Stefychefy!

These were very good and the boyfriend complimented them more than once, which isn't something he tends to do.  Of note - the smallest of my chicken breasts was overcooked by the end of cooking time.  Served with roasted red potatoes and steamed broccoli.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe.  I used figs instead of dates.  And I cut the half breasts again so there would be smaller portions for a pot luck I was attending.  It was the hit of the party.

This is an excellent dish for entertaining!  I was really easy to prepare but comes out as a fancy dish.  I didn't know what to think of the dates but they add a nice twist to the goat cheese.  I will definately make this again!

Wonderful! the only changes i made were that i did not use fresh basil and i used green onion instead of shallots because its what i had, also i used the thin sliced chicken which made stuffing them a little harder but it still turn out fabulous. Very moist chicken and the dates added a wonderful sweetness along with the creaminess of the goat cheese.

This was so delicious! I used thin-sliced chicken breasts, so the proportion of chicken to the "good stuff" was really great. I used figs as I did not have dates and didn't care to buy them just for this, and it worked well. It does need a sauce, so I need to figure that out.

This recipe is EXCELLENT AS WRITTEN and is well worth the small amount of time it takes to make it! I also pair it with a 50/50 lettuce blend salad containing feta and cherub tomatoes dressed with EEOO, garlic, fresh cracked pepper and balsamic vinaigrette...doesn't get any better!

Delicious and easy. I made this last night, combining a small pkg of Herb and Garlic goat cheese (eliminating the garlic and herbs) prechopped dates to taste and using 2 chicken breasts. Cut a slit almost through the the breasts to flatten and pounded thin but not too thin. Cooked as directed and made a pan sauce after removing some of the grease with chicken broth, white wine, wild mushrooms, extra shallots which I had sauteed earlier, and some butter; reduced to desired consistency. You may need extra Prosciutto so plan accordingly.

This was pretty tasty. I used bacon instead of proscuitto and didn't use dates. I think that it worked very well.

I have tried this recipe 3 times and loved it as written. I'm improving at making the pocket in the chicken breast and filling it with the Herbal soft goat cheese mixture without leaking. Just use prosciuto slices which are wide and circle the chicken breast. Usually two slices are required if not three. 
It will be a favorite and a winner.

Delicious - one of our weeknight staples now because it's so easy but so 'fancy'!  I just buy the herbed goat cheese and use that to save a step.  Also I don't use dates.  Comes out juicy - Yum!

I used bacon instead of Prosciutto simply because I didn't know if I'd be able to find it at the grocery store. I also dropped the dates because I wasn't sure if my boyfriend would like that. I should have wrapped it tighter or used a couple of strips of bacon because the filling gushed through. I found the chicken dry.

Used equal amount of fig goat cheese and fine herbs goat cheese, mixed in about 2 tablespoons of roasted red pepper pesto + about 1 tablespoon of regular pesto. 2 slices of prosciutto per breast. The flavor of the fig goat cheese was very prominent. Interesting mix! Would perhaps brown the wrapped breasts prior to putting them in the oven next time, just to put some color on them. Cooking time was a little too long (I removed the breasts 5 minutes ahead and they were large pieces).

I would make this again.

Absolutely delicious! The sweet from the dates (well I had figs) against the salty of the prosciutto and the creaminess of the cheese - this was a restaurant worthy meal. I used chicken thighs and served with garlic and rosemary pasta and we sighed with delight all through the meal. Thanks for posting this wonderful dish!

Subbed dried cranberries for the dates and bacon for the prosciutto. Also used skin-in thighs, which made them harder to stuff... but the skin helped seal the stuffing.

Was able to make it a day ahead, but brought it to room temp before putting it into the oven.   Might try and play with the stuffing, but the chicken was very moist and tasty as it was.  I used regular onions instead of shallots.   It's an easy but impressive dish to serve for company.

It turned out great! I bought an herbed cream cheese to simplify a bit. Overall a very easy recipe. I recommend cooking the chicken 5-10 min less, unless you have huge pieces. Mine were slightly overdone.

A little too many spices for me.  Next time will just add McCormicks Garlis and Herb seasoning with a little more added garlic.   The nuggets were moist and filling.

This was delicious. I added well chopped pignoli nuts to the goat cheese stuffing, which really added to it . And I substituted bacon which worked really well.

Do not cook this chicken for 40 minutes unless you have exceptionally large chicken breasts. I cooked it for 36 minutes and it was desperately dry.

The flavors are spot on, as is the amount of filling. The only substitution I made was to use dried thyme and basil as that is what I had on hand. 

I will make this again, but will watch the cooking time more carefully.

I love prosciutto wrapped chicken, but my family couldn't get into the sweetness of the dates. I thought it was ok. I'll probably try a different recipe next time I wrap chicken.

Made this several times.  Suggest to use 2 slices of prosciutto per breast, bake on parchment paper to avoid sticking or any messy cheese cleanup and lightly oil the tops after wrapping to encourage browning. I also season the outside of the wrapped breasts with a bit of pepper as the prosciutto is salty enough, and check the internal temp after 25 minutes. Mine were done! 40 mins is too long and no flipping required.

A nice alternative is chopped dried cranberries and sage if you find dates too sweet. I have also substituted regular onions for shallots with good results

I followed the directions perfectly and took the advice of reviews to cut short the baking time by 10 minutes.  It still came out super dry.  I wasn't sure about flipping the chicken after 20 minutes as I was worried it would come "unwrapped" but the cheese and prosciutto stayed perfectly in place.  It looked yummy and we were so excited to try it but what a disappointment.

I found this recipe when looking for a recipe to use with the chicken, prosciutto, and mozzarella cheese I brought with me while on vacation.  Fortunately, I had brought fresh thyme and basil with me.  I had to use red onion in place of shallots and I didn't have any dates or raisins.  The chicken breasts I had were huge ones and I used the entire amount of cheese mixture for two that weighed a total of  a pound.  So if you have four large breasts, you may want to consider making more cheese filling.  I am looking forward to remaking it with the goat cheese and fruit.

I was very pleased with how this came out. The only changes i made was to substite bacon for the prosciutto and I added fresh rosemary and black pepper  into the stuffing. The only change I would make next time is to add more dates into the stuffing mixture. It was also surprisinly easy to make and looked much fancier and more difficult then it was. I served it with sauted sweet potatoes and asparagus smother in a creamy shrimp and cheese sauce. All the guest s raved and cleaned their plates.

Excellent dish.  I serve it with a balsamic glaze/reduction which fits perfectly with the flavors of the prosciutto and dates.  A quick shortcut I've used when I didn't have time to saute the shallots is mixing Smoky Fig & Roasted Garlic Sauce (purchased at Costco) into the dates/cheese mixture instead.

Loved it! Used dried cranberries instead of dates because that's what had on hand and then broiled each side of the chicken for 3-5 min, covered, and baked at 400 for 30 min. So juicy and even my 16 month old son gobbled it up! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent did it almost as stated, except added more garlic, dried Thyme vs. fresh and added slivered almonds on top during the last 20 minutes of cooking.  

will go into my rotation.

Dinner party debacle! I followed the recipe precisely but it turned out so dry it was virtually inedible. We had a hard time hacking through them even with steak knives. The prosciutto I used perhaps didn't have a high enough fat content and the 35 minutes at 350 degrees was DEFINITELY way too long. On the good side, the filling was absolutely delicious, however, its moisture didn't permeate the chicken.  IF I ever attempt this recipe again -- and that is my no means certain -- I will try using bacon instead of prosciutto and certainly reduce the time drastically. Going to dinner-party-host-embarrassment-therapy now. ;-)

Ok so I normally try and follow the recipes on here exactly as written but in this case I had to change it a bit.  I'm getting married in just a few months so in the interest of trying to eat healthy until that day, I had to leave off the prosciutto.  Also I don't like dates so I left those out too.  I do however love red peppers (which I understand are very different than dates) so I added those in and then followed the rest of the recipe.  The result was outstanding!  Me and my girl actually packed the rest for lunch the next day and I swear they were even better!  Thanks :)
