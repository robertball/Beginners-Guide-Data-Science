I absolutely LOVED this recipe!!  I served it warm on toast.  I did, however, make a few minor adjustments to reduce the fat.  First, I cut the margarine down to 1T.  I also cut the mayo to 1/4 c. and added 1 c. lowfat cottage cheese.  I also added a little dijon mustard for an extra kick.  It was so creamy and rich and DELICIOUS! Thanks for the recipe...it's a keeper!

I do like this recipe a lot!  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the mayo should be reduced.  I tried another Crab Salad recipe yesterday that had more ingredients and didn't taste as good.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a very easy lunch, and it tasted great. I made a couple of changes, I used 2 tsp of olive to saute with and omitted the butter. I also added some salt and a dash of garlic powder, and cut the amount of mayo in half.  
I served it with sliced avocado. Next time I might try subbing finely diced celery for the green pepper.

YUMMY!  I love it. I have tried a ton of recipes for crab salad. This was great!  I made a few modifications also.  I cut the butter down to 1 1/2 tbsp. Used a mix of frozen, already chopped, red pepper, green pepper and onion. Added a tsp of minced garlic then the crab meat. (I used lump imitation)I cut the mayo down to 1/4 cup just like the previous users and added some dijon and 2 tbsp lite sour cream. Served on toasted whole wheat bread. Very good!

I didn't like it hot but it got great reviews from my guests cold.  I also used about half of the mayo and have wondered about trying it again with cream cheese... This, along with the Hummus III recipe, were the hits of the party!

Way too greasy.  I did not care much for it.  My husband found it tasty, though, but he said that amont of butter can be easily reduced by half.  None of us are usually worried about our fat intake, but this had too much to taste good.

This was so good, I didn't have any green pepper so I left it out.  I ate it warm and it was delicious.  So simple to make too!  Next time I'm going to try it inside an omelet.

I made a few changes. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter. I used light miracle whip instead of mayonnaise, added chopped celery and gave it a creole taste by adding a little original creole seasoning. saraleo

We tried this recipe as is, and liked the flavor but felt it needed something additional. Next time we will try adding this to some type of noodle.

This was a super easy and tasty recipe. I did however made some changes. I cut the mayo to 3 tbs and since i didnt have fresh celery I used celery seeds. I also added 2.5 ups of finely shredded green cabbage, some black pepper and to finish it off i drizzled it with hot sauce. It was soooooooooooo good. I liked it cold for sure---not warm.

Please be cautious with this recipe being gluten free. Imitation crab meat contains wheat which is not gluten free. Make sure (if you can find it)the imitation crab meat is labeled gluten free!

We quite enjoyed this.  Used only 1/2 the amount substituted miracle whip for the mayo.  Also added about 1/2 tsp of white pepper to give it some zing.  Next time I will try adding a bit of curry powder.

I liked this cold. I didn't have any green bell peppers and so I substituted for 2 stalks of celery and added pepper.

I thought this was bland and a little too watery.  Between the water that comes out of the onions and the crab, this salad was somewhat runny.  I added 6 tablespoons mayo (instead of a full cup) and a pinch of salt, pepper, garlic powder, oregano, and basil, but still did not find it that good.

I'm a pretty good cook, but I really did not enjoy this. The flavor was so bland, and warming everything up just made such a flavorless lukewarm goop that it was almost impossible to stomach. Not a successful recipe at all.

Wonderful!  I am pregnant and have been craving Crab Salad, and NONE of our local grocery stores carry it in their delis!  This was so easy!  I did use grape seed oil to tenderize the onion and green pepper, and I did listen to other reviewers and I cut the mayo in half.  So good!  Thank you!

This crab salad is AMAZING!  I did make a few changes however, instead of using butter I used olive oil, I used 16 ounces of imitation crabmeat, and only half a cup of mayonnaise, and it turned out perfect.  My husband ate the whole thing in one sitting (and he is pretty hard to please)!

I thought this was good!  My package of imitation crab only had 8 ounces, so I had to modify the recipe and just eyeballed the rest of the ingredients.  I served it warm on buns.  It was a little bland, and I think I'll use lemon juice or hot sauce to perk up the leftovers.

Very delicious. I opted to use olive oil drizzled on the bottom of the pan versus butter. Butter would have probably given it more flavor, but it tasted lacking so I sprinkled Old Bay Seasoning over the top and it was perfect! I also decreased the Mayo by at least half. I just added mayo by rounded cereal spoon fulls until it was moist. Thanks for the great easy recipe.

With imitation crab I'd rate this only a 3 star, but I felt with real crab-it may have been a 5 star.

I added 1 T. Sriracha,  changed the plain butter to 2 T. Butter and 1 T. Garlic & Herb Butter, substituted the green pepper with tri-colored peppers, doubled the amount of crab, 1/2 t. Old Bay Garlic & Herb, and added 1/4 Cup 5 cheese Italian blend then baked at 350 for 25 minutes.  Such rave reviews.

I read the reviews first and decided to make this exactly as written for a light dinner served on toasted plain bagels.  This did not excite anyone;  too much butter and mayonnaise for our taste.  We like to try new ideas.  Thanks for sharing, but not something I would make again

I like the simplicity and use of ingredients as opposed to many weird recipes that I found.  However, I will cut the salad dressing amount, use Pablano or another spicier pepper (hate bell peppers and love Southwestern foods), olive oil instead of butter, and less onion.

Good recipe, I also like other reviewers used less mayo and I also subbed celery for the green pepper. I used a few shakes of Old Bay for a seasoning. Thanks for a great starting point recipe.

Excellent recipe. I  used real crabmeat in lieu of imitation and reduced the onion to 1/2 (glad I did - a whole onion would have been a little over-powering).  To make it lighter, I eliminated the butter and just sauteed the veggies in butter flavored Crisco spray.  Seemed to work fine.  I also reduced the mayo by 1/2 at the recommendation of other reviewers and would advise that anyone making this for the first time do the same.  You can always add more later but you can never take the mayo out once mixed in.  1/2c of mayo is more than enough.   Served over mixed baby lettuces with avocado slices.  Great stuff.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  Super easy to make, too.

I loved this recipe.  It is so easy and tasty.  I agree with the other reviewers - definitely use about 1/2 the mayo.  I added a little white pepper for taste. Served it on crackers. Thanks

Although I chopped up the bell peppers, I did not heat them nor did I add butter.  Added in some celery chopped very fine and about a capful or two of vinegar.

This was a pretty good lunch.  I added a little Old Bay Seasoning.  It could still use a little something extra to perk it up a bit.  Maybe some garlic powder?  Or maybe make garlic mayo.

This recipe was a good starting point, but I really didn't follow it much.  I omitted the peppers, sauteed green onions and crabmeat in butter and minced garlic and mixed it into some cream cheese and mayo with a dash of Worcestershire.  I just eyeballed the mayo, but I'm sure it was much less then was called for, maybe a few tablespoons.  Very good on a toasted roll.

I doubled this crab salad recipe and glad I did. We loved it and it made a great side dish for our Independence Day cookout. We first discovered crab salad at Sizzler many years ago in the early days of our marriage. This is the closest I've come to a recipe that duplicates that  recipe. If you love the taste of imitation crab--as we do--you will love this recipe, because the crab is the star. There's plenty of crab and not so much of anything thing else, like celery. Yes, you could add a little celery for crunch, but this is just perfect as it is. But wait, there's more. With plenty of leftover crab salad tonight, I had this itch in my brain that needed to be scratched, a distant memory of the seafood and crab sandwich that Subway used to have. So I buttered a couple of hot dog buns, browned them in a skillet on the stove top, and devoured two  crab salad sandwiches. The buttery crunch of the hot dog buns, the other worldly crab salad, and the contrast between the two, made for an unforgettable culinary experience. I can't wait to get hungry again so I can have another ...

Pretty good.  We added some fresh celery, cucumber, and carrots to beef it up a little bit.  We sautéed the onions and peppers with the crab meat as directed, then cooled it in the fridge for 20 minutes or so.  Then mixed in the fresh veggies and mayo, chilled the whole thing over night, and served on Jewish Rye.  Really good.

My brother in law makes this and I'm addicted to it.   I remember asking what the recipe was and was blow away with it's non complex coupling  It is really simple and savory.  I like mine served cold.

I used a little less butter and about 1/2 to 3/4 of the amount of mayo that the recipe calls for and I LOVED this.  Great warm on toast. I'm sure it is great cold.

This was great! I didn't have peppers, would have substituted celery, but didn't have that either, so I substituted dried chives. I only used 1 tbsp. butter to sauté half an onion and hydrate the chives. I gave it a dash of garlic powder. When the onions were starting to caramelize, I melted 1 brick of cream cheese into the pan with 1/4 cup of milk to thin. Also used only 8 oz of crab.

Too much onion, too much mayonnaise, and too little crab.  I used 18 oz real crab and 1 cup sour cream instead of mayonnaise.  The mayonnaise should be cut in half and 18 oz crab used.  I would cut the onion in half also.

I liked this recipe except it was a little bland for us so, I added some Old Bay Seasoning and a little lemon juice.  Oh, and I used coconut oil instead of butter.

This was pretty good! I'm not a crab person, but I had some imitation crab in my fridge that needed to be used up.  I made as written except I added a little bit of minced garlic and salt, and I ate it warm on toast.  I don't know if I would go out and buy imitation crab just to make this, but if I find myself needing to use up some again in the future, I'll use it this way!

Made it the first time with cooked shrimp instead of imitation crab.  It was good but 1 cup of mayonnaise is too much for only 12 ounces of seafood.  Everything was drowning in mayo.  Made it the 2nd time with 16 ounces of imitation crab.  Used only 4 tablespoons of mayo and I liked it much better.  I also added half of an avacado, cut up in chucks, to the salad.  Good flavor, excellent light summer salad.  Save your money and make this recipe yourself...it's so easy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this, I did use some of the other reviewers suggestions. I substituted green pepper for celery, as I didn't have the green pepper on hand. I also used only 1 tblsp butter and a little bit of olive oil together, since I don't like much butter, just the small taste of it. It turned out delicious and was good hot and cold.

What a great recipe! I had a few pouches of top of the line imitation crab meat and found this. After sauteing all of the ingredients I tasted what I had made, because I had added a bit of basil and black pepper. My husband and I never saw the need to add any mayo to the creation! However, just to make sure, I put a small amoutn in a bowl and added just a touch of mayo but I was glad that I served it without. We ate it over a bed of greens and veggies with a light dressing and it was marvelous!

Husband didn't like this, and I thought it was just ok. The flavors didn't work as well as I'd hoped. Oh well, thanks anyway.
