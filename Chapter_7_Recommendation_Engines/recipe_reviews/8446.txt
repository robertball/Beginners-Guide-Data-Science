My boyfriend's mother is supposedly famous for this cake, and the first time I tried the infamous dessert, I laughed silently to myself knowing that I could out her secret and it's ease with a mere link. But I didn't. :)
I do however serve this cake, and it is one No one can get enough of. I use dark chocolate chunks as opposed to chocolate chips. Try using mini bundt pans, and make sure to dust them with a little cocoa...I prefer Ghirardelli. Serve them drizzled with a liqueur, and don't be afraid to experiment with flavors...this is the kind of dessert you can cater specially to the tastes of your guests. I have used raspberry, hazelnut and creme de menthe liqueurs, all with raving success. Garnish with a couple of mint leaves and you're set. It's so easy it's ridiculous.

*edit* I found these little Andes Mint mini chips at the grocer and used them in place of chocolate chips. Oh my goooood. So moist and minty, it was positively sinful!

Absolutely fantastic!  Used a devils food cake box, 1/4 cup Godiva and 1/4 Kamora(just like Kahlua but 1/2 the price!), and only one cup of chocolate chips (mini is best but not essential). Used cocoa to dust the pan, but you can also use a little of the chocolate cake mix if you don't have cocoa. Baked for 60mins. Had leftover chocolate ganache from a cake I made earlier in the week (that was WAY more work and not as good!) so poured that over the top, and it looked stunning! Have been experimenting with different liquors every time I make this - Baileys, Grand Marnier, dark rum...My favorite liquor in this cake so far has been Chambord (raspberry), although Grand Marnier is very good too. FYI: Tia Maria, Kahlua, Kamora and Cafe Ole are all coffee flavored liquors (the last two being the cheapest). Godiva and Creme de Cacao are good for the chocolate flavored liquors.  You could also make this non-alcoholic by using strong brewed coffee.

Yes, this is a very rich, sweet, moist, dense cake.  Made this about 4 times and second time decreased chocolate chips to 1 cup, which is plenty sweet and taste better.  I also used 1 cup of Irish cream flavored liquer, which tastes much better and added more flavor.  Have also substituted 2 tablespoon instant espresso powder in place of the liquer and was fantastic.  Espresso really brings out the flavor of chocolate.  Have also used Andes Mint Chocolate baking chips and it was to die for!  Also, use room temp. eggs, which makes cake rise better.  (If in a pinch, soak cold eggs in  very hot tap water for 5 min.) No need for glaze or frosting or this will be too sweet.  Taste best with fresh strawberries/rasberries if available.  If not, dust with powdered sugar and you're good to go.  So easy and taste very homemade!!  **TIP - You can use other cake mix flavors, such as Vanilla, and add the sour cream to make a moist, dense yellow cake.

This cake is a Chocoholic's Dream! You'd really never know it was a boxed cake - it's that good! It's very dense, moist, rich, and chocolately - what more could you ask for from such a simple recipe! You really don't even need frosting, just a dusting of confectioners' sugar which provided a nice contrast and didn't ruin the flavor. I did cut back of the chocolate chips using only 1 cup. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing! This cake is perfect when you don't have time to make a scratch cake but want something that tastes like you did!

Incredible cake! I almost break out in hives at the thought of baking a BOXED cake...but I must give credit where it is due. I tried using one cup of chocolate chips at the suggestion of other reviewers, and it's delicious. I prefer using the full 2 cups of mini chocolate chips though. I think it lends greatly to the gooey consistancy of the cake. Regular chocolate chips look like chips in cake...the minis seem to melt right in. I have also experimented with different liquors such as Kahlua and Godiva but try others for fun too. I think it's great with Bailey's which my husband liked, but when I used my Aramula cream liqueur...he declared it the best chocolate cake in the world. It needs no icing...try a light dusting of powdered sugar for asthetics. Make sure you dust just before serving. This cake is so moist...the powdered sugar is quickly absorbed (and may look less than appealing). Also, make sure you do flour the pan or use baker's joy. Once, I only used oil and the cake didnt fall out as neatly.

This is very good, but there are nearly identical recipes that are just as good and call for half the sour cream. Why double the sour cream if it doesn't really make the cake any better?

Everybody loves this cake - they says its "to-die-for" and I get multiple requests for it.  I replaced the coffee liquor with chocolate milk.  Baked for exactly 1 hour and it turned out delicious and moist.  Thanks!

awesome cake!!!  moist, chocolaty, easy as pie (so to speak!)  i swapped lite sour cream for the full fat and it is just as rich.  i also dust my bundt pan with cocoa which is a nice touch.  i've made it with a tray of water in the bottom of the oven, and without--without works better.  the cake rises up like crazy when it bakes--my boyfriend and i like to watch it cook.  it does fall back down to normal size.  it's a bit hard to test for doneness with all the melted chocolate chips in it--every time i've baked it for an hour, it's turned out perfect.  i've made it with baileys and i've made it with kaluha.  both are wonderful and get rave reviews.  next i plan to make it with an orange liquor.  yum diddlie umptious!  it needs no glaze or icing--we love it just the way it is!

This cake is incredible. I have tried for a very long time to find a recipe like this one. It is moist and full of flavour.  The first time I baked this cake I followed the recipe exactly and the cake turned out wonderful. The second time I used milk instead of the liquer and topped it with a chocolate ganache glaze since I love a rich chocolate cake. This cake has made the Allrecipe website my favourite one.

Just made this last night and thought it was very good. I used Kahluha in the recipe and 1 cup of mini chocolate chips. I also made a chocolate glaze for the top with Kahluha. Glaze: melt 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 1/2 T butter in microwave. Stir in 1/2 - 3/4 cup powdered sugar, 2 T Kahluha and 1-2 T milk. The cake was drier than I expected because it looked so moist! I only baked it for an hour like the recipe said...

BEST chocolate cake ever.  One thing though...you don't have to add the liqueur...use milk, water, more vegetable oil, a combination of the three, or don't sub anything at all.  It turns out dense and terrific if you don't sub another liquid.  Milk makes it a little fluffier, and more oil makes it more moist.  So whatever you want!  It will turn out great no matter what.

A very dense, rich, full of chocolate flavor cake. (I couldn't really taste the Kahlua in it though.) Everyone loved this cake!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this twice... The first one I made into a layered cake with a choc. buttercreme frosting.  I took it to a ladies' party and was horrified as I heard a number of them discussing how it was WAY too rich, they would get sick if they ate it, and then they proceeded to the trash can to throw their slices away.  I was CRUSHED and almost embarrased to take the leftovers to a family gathering afterward.  They cheered me up as they proceeded to absolutely inhale the remainder of the cake and were outraged to find out that others had thrown their slices away.  So, I made them another cake a few days later, except the second one I made into the bundt cake as the recipe calls for.  That one quickly disappeared as well and most partakers claimed it to be the best cake they ever had.  However, the general consensus among those that had tried some of both the layered and bundt cakes, agreed that the layered cake was better as the frosting made it even richer, creamier, and more moist.  Lesson learned... don't take this to a party where it will only be served to ladies worried about their weight!
One more quick point... If making a layered cake, be sure to check the cakes for doneness after 40 min. baking instead of 60!

My family's new all-time favorite!  I don't keep coffee liqueur, so the first time I made it I replaced it with 1/2 cup of marichino cherry juice.  Yummmmmmy!  The next time I used 1/2 cup strong brewed coffee, also very good.  My crew liked the cherry juice the best, so that is probably how I will make it from now on.

I mae this cake for mother's day and made it using all fat free ingredients where I could!! I also put half of the batter in the bundt pan then added lite cherry pie filling then the rest of the cake batter on top.  This made for a super moist chocolate cake with cherries in the center it was out of this world.  I also dusted the top of the cake with some powdered sugar.  Great Cake!!

Whew!  This is a serious chocolate cake.  Heavenly if you're a chocolate lover.  I used mini chips as suggested, and every bite was moist and dense.  I used chocolate ganache poured over it, and it truly sent it over the top.  Great for those special occassions.

Very good, even with a pretty drastic change.  I used 1 carton of silken tofu in place of the sour cream and it worked brilliantly.  Also baked it in two 9-inch rounds instead of the bunt as it was a birthday cake.  Plan to make it again for a picnic this weekend.

So simple and easy!  This is really a delicious cake. I've made this cake at least once a month since I've discovered it.  I do reduce the heat to 325 degrees and cook it for an additional 15 minutes.  I also add v1 tsp. of vanilla extract.  The true key though is to use the exact size bundt pan - having used "almost 10 inch" pans, the cakes overflowed and "fell".  But with a true 10" bundt pan, there was neither problem. Thank You for a great cake!!!

My co-workers loved this cake so much, my boss asked that I make it for her birthday.  I used Godiva Chocolate liquer for the alcohol, used mini chocolate chips instead of the regular (made the cake more consistent, Then, added a white chocolate icing for the topping.  Melt a batter of white chips with a little cream.  (wait until cake is cool) let icing drizzle down sides of cake...then after the icing has cooled, add more semi sweet chocolate chips to the top to finish the look!

This recipe is amazing! The only things I did differently is replace the alcohol with a teaspoon and a half of raspberry extract!  I also used white chocolate chips instead of choc chips. White chocolate raspberry dark chocolate cake?? Amazing! Best cake Ive had in years and it was made by meeeee!! Even better :) Im not sure why people are using nonfat sourcream instead of regular. It seems to be ruining the texture and for what? to save 80 calories? So I would only adjust the chips and the liquer/extract. Leave the rest of it alone, its there for a reason.
i made this recipe for the second time and this time i made it into cupcakes! it cut the cooking time down to 21 mins and they were even more moist being so small! yummmmmy

I love this cake and make it whenever I can.  I just had an opportunity again, but this time instead of making it with chocolate, I used white cake mix, vanilla instant pudding, butterscotch chips, and Frangelico.  I'm a huge chocolate fan but I will definitely make it this way again.  So many of my friends wanted the recipe.

This cake was just okay for me. I'd say it definitely needs a frosting or a glaze to come close to the expectations raised by the recipe description and reviews. It really just tasted like a souped-up box cake. . . one with a little something added to it, but a box cake nonetheless. I'd give it three stars, but after all the ecstatic reviews, I was pretty disappointed. I won't be making this again.

Ive tried many cakes from this site and none have thrilled me much.  I loved this cake!  The best thing about it is how easy it is to make.  I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips and Baileys instead of Kaluah.  I used Bakers Joy spray and the cake fell out of the pan after 25 minutes of cooling.  This a very easy, quck delicious cake I will make often.

the cake turned out great! it is really easy and yes batter will be thick. the cake has a crispy surface and really moist texture. although it is a bit too chocolaty for me(i am not a fan of chocolate), but i guess that's good news for chocolate lovers! just one little note: do not attempt to remove the cake from pan when the cake is still hot!:)

If I could give 10 stars I would!  This is my kids favorite cake... tonight I made it for my son's birthday and used white chocolate chips and water instead of the coffee liquor.  Once cooled made a white chocolate ganache to drizzle over the top.  Perfect!  Another trick that enhances presentation is to grease the bundt pan and use the powdered cake mix to "flour" the pan.  This prevents the icky white residue.

This is amazing! Such a thick, rich batter. I used milk instead of liqueur and it turned out beautiful. And I only used 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips. I also highly recommend the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" recipe on this website as the topping.

Everyone in my family loved this cake. The first time I made it, I forgot to stir in the chocolate chips in the batter, so I added it in the bundt pan. It came out great because the chips didn't fall to the bottom of the pan and created a center similar to "molten chocolate cakes". 
Thanks for sharing!

OK.  This recipe scared me.  TWO cups of sour cream!  But, I made it exactly as written and it turned out fantastic.  I used a devil's food cake mix and devil's food pudding mix, full fat sour cream, Kahlua and mini chocolate chips, along with the other ingredients listed.  Served it for Father's Day and everyone raved about it.  This recipe makes A LOT of batter and the cake overflowed the bundt pan, so next time I will keep out a cup or so of batter and make a few cupcakes along with the bundt cake.  Make this cake-you will love it!

This is the best chocolate cake ever. The only thing I change in the recipe is switch out the liquor for Starbucks Mocha Frappuchino (cheaper alternative).

This was delicious! I made it again & used  milk in place of  liquor. (I used white cream de cocoa last time.) I'm not a fan of liquor but wanted to try recipe as written.  I also cooked it for 55 minutes and used 1 1/c cups mini chips as suggested by others. I cut baking time by 5 more minutes this time. Cake mellowed overnight & was great. I removed it from the refrigerator 30 minutes before serving. I kept it cold because I used a peanut butter pie filling  for top, split layers & frosting. See my photo & recipe at bottom. The filling is a very simple and delicious for the 1st time I baked this. 1 pkg. instant chocolate pudding, 1/4 cup confectionery sugar, 2 heaping tablespoons cocoa. Mix together and beat in 2/3 cup milk and fold in 8 ounces of whip topping. I used mini chips sprinkled on top as it was a birthday party. This time I used peanut butter pie  filling, see new photo. Used 8 oz. cream cheese, 1 cup peanut butter, 1/2 cup powder sugar, 2 TBSP. milk & folded in 8 oz. whip topping. Split bundt cake into 3 layers filled & frosted with this mixture. This way it was rich & could serve more people as there was a gang!

Oh wow!!  I made this cake a while back and am just now getting around to writing a review for it.  But oh boy do I remember how good it was.  This was really moist and very chocolately.  This is not your typical chocolate pound cake...but a more sinful version!  Thank you Incredible Chocolate Cake Lady.

I thought this recipe was great! It was very moist and chocolaty, and tasted great with a big glass of milk! Mine didn't burn and I baked it for about 60-65 minutes. I checked it frequently after 50 minutes. I placed a shallow pan of water underneath it while baking to give it some moisture, which really made it moist. I drizzled  white chocolate over the top after it cooled for garnish.

Thsi chocolate cake is amazing! I followed the receipe exactly! Everyone LOVES this cake! I whipped up a vanilla cream pudding and placed it in the middle of the cake and sprinkled mini chocolate chips on the cream. To make the cream just add one small box of instant vanilla pudding to one small tub of cool whip. It is yummy together!

Made it for My sister's birthday yesterday as well as a white chocolate cavitymaker cake.... Both were a big hit.  It was about 50/50 on the tally.  The vanilla cavity maker I added Praline liquor and white chocolate chips. I served them with whipped cream and raspberries....Yum! OK.... I've been making this for 7 years now without a failure and always rave reviews.  I've made it for wedding cakes, birthday cakes and any occasion that comes along.  My mother in law (a major chocoholic)  requested it for a halloween cake for her bridge club. It holds up very well (drove 40 miles to deliver it). I need to add that you can make a perfect 9" 3 layer  cake by doubling the recipe... Impressive!!

No doubt that this is the BEST chocolate cake I've EVER eaten!! And so sinfully easy to make! I switch up the liqueur depending on my mood but my favorite is a mix of amaretto and hazelnut! I bake mine in three 9 inch cake pans for about 25-35 mins. I make a chocolate mousse filling and a ganache topping using recipes from this site. You should definitely try it!!! Your friends will be begging you to make more cakes and give them you "secret" recipe!  ;-)

Wow!! My family raved. This cake can satisfy anyone's chocolate cravings. I like using the mini-morsels best. Also, I followed someone else's suggestion to use chocolate syrup instead of the liqueur. Hershey's makes a "special dark" syrup that worked great. I agree that it's definately rich enough not to need icing but I couldn't let it go without adding a satiny chocolate glaze. A little whipped cream on the side is the perfect addition.

Note: This is an excellent cake for parties. As a bundt cake it slices wonderfully. And this cake is so rich a little goes a long way. You could get 30 servings out of one. Bring along a can of Readiwhip and you'll a hit.

I've made a "Chocolate Kahlua Cake" for years but lost the recipe in a move. Low and behold, this is the recipe! My friends and family will be so happy because this cake is their favorite and made me a hit at any occasion I took it to. For an adult-only event, I pour a generous amount of Kahlua (the real stuff, it tastes best) on the serving tray and set the warm cake on it and let it soak up the Kahlua overnight. Yum!

I thought I had made this cake before and was unimpressed, but with all of the great reviews I decided to try it again.  I'm by no means a cake snob, and have made plenty of souped up cake mix cakes which have been excellent, but this is terrible.  It's heavy, dense and gummy and even with all of those great ingredients in there it has surprisingly little flavor.  Complete waste of expensive ingredients.

I made this cake for a bake sale.  It was so moist and delicious.  The only change I made was adding brewed coffee instead of the liqueur.  I baked it in my gas oven for 50-52 minutes.  I probably could have left it in for a few more minutes, but I was afraid of overcooking.  The sides were just starting to pull away from the bundt pan.  Anyway, this was a wonderful recipe and I've had three requests to make this cake again!

I have to confess, this is the only chocolate cake I've made on this site.  Why change? It is the most DELICIOUS bundt cake.  My husband has taken this numerous times to a men's fellowship...everybody fawns over it.  We've made this cake for several years now.  Just be sure to coat the bundt cake well. I always coat well with non-stick spray.  It's perfect sprinkled with the confectioner's sugar.  Love this cake!

This beats every doctored chocolate cake I've baked. I used Tropical Source choc chips from Whole Foods and they stayed gooey even in the cooled cake. Freezing not recommended as the chips may re-solidify.
I preheat the oven to 355° since you lose alot of heat when you open the door.  When cake goes in I decrease the oven to 345° and bake until done. Toothpick method doesn't work since choc chips stay gooey. 
I also sift the cake mix to aerate and remove lumps.  Then I beat all wet ingredients well before blending in the dry ingredients on LOW for 2 minutes.
It was a lot of batter, but it didn't overflow.  I also took a spoonful of cake mix to dust the choc chips to help suspend them in the thick batter. 
It certainly doesn't need icing.  Can't wait to bake it again.

This cake turned out great. My husband likes chocolate okay, but prefers just about anything else over chocolate, and he cannot stop talking about this cake. I used chocolate milk instead of coffee liquer, and dusted the pan with cocoa powder. This one is a keeper!

This cake really is very dangerous! Like another reviewer stated, I won't be making this again, as my will power was sorely tested! I made slight changes, per other reviewers' suggestions. Didn't have liqueur, so used black coffee. Didn't have vegetable oil, so I used a combo of butter and apple sauce. Added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract. I used four 7-inch pans, baked for approx. 30 minutes. It was so hard to stop at one piece! One co-worker said that it was like an orgasm in his mouth!

Delicious cake. I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze also found on this site, and it was sinfully delicious. Make sure you have a cold glass of milk handy; you will definitely need it!

Excellent.  Made without liquor and used milk instead and mini mint chocolate chips.  Super good.

I now know why this recipe has so many 5-star ratings.  It is DEEEE-LICIOUS!  I have actually made a similar cake to this one, something I sort of concocted last year around this time, but I never thought to put so much sour cream in it along with the liqueur.  But this recipe is perfect.  I will say that I only used 1 and 1/2 cups of sour cream because that's all I had left in the fridge.  It actually turned out to be the perfect amount for me.  And as per other reviewers' suggestions, I cut my chocolate chips down to 1 cup.  I think if I had minis that 2 cups would have been okay.  But the chocolate chips melted perfectly into the batter.  I think in the cake I made last year I used 2 cups, and my cake was so moist and fudgy that it fell apart when I tried to get it out of the pan.  So 1 cup worked out perfectly.  I kept everything else the same, and the cake was perfect.  It was very moist and dense but still retained just a bit of 'fluffiness' that some people like in a cake.  I think that extra 1/2 cup of sour cream would have made it a little more dense.  But this way I could actually use this batter to bake layers and decorate.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!  Oh...and I just topped this with the shiny chocolate glaze from this site...worked out great.

So rich and gooey...YUM! I've made this numerous ways and eveytime is a winner. I've used Godiva liquer, kahlua, Bailey's. My favorite combo is with strong coffee instead of the liquer and peanut butter chips. try this, you won't be disappointed!

Made this for Thanksgiving...my 5 year old nephew took one bite and said that this was 'icky'.  He was right--tasted fake and chalky.  And I followed recipe to the letter.

Fantastic cake, super moist and insanely chocolately - without being too sweet. I used Starbucks coffee liqueur, which has a stronger coffee flavor than others. I only topped it with a dusting of powdered sugar as anything else would have been too much. The only problem is that I cannot get it to come out in one piece - ever. First time the chocolate chips sank to the bottom and glued huge chunks of the cake to the pan. So I skipped them and prepped the pan with nonstick spray and a dusting of cocoa powder (to avoid the white-flour issue). Still stuck. Didn't detract from the taste, just isn't the prettiest once pieced back together. I'll keep trying.

My three-year old and I made this for Valentine's for my hubby and we all loved it!  Mini chips are definitely the way to go.  I used about 1/3 of the batter in a heart insert in my springform (make sure there's a double layer of foil underneath) and the remaining in a bundt pan and it filled it up, so maybe mine isn't a true 10".  I used Carolan's irish cream liqueur and the flavor was very nice, I could taste it mostly in the very moist inner parts of the cake.  I might use a splash more next time...either that, or I will drink a splash more when I'm making it; either way, I'll enjoy making this killer cake for years to come!

The cake was very moist and beautiful and fluffy, and it vanished practically overnight!  The first day, I didn't care for it; the godiva chocolate liqueur (substituted for kahlua) was way too overpowering.  But the next day, the flavor set and the cake was DELECTABLE!!! Does not taste like a cake mix cake at all.

Fantastic cake!  Everyone loved it.  Followed the recipe, but used the coco powder instead of the flour and it worked beautifully.  Added a dusting of powdered sugar and red and green decorative icing around the base to give it a christmas feel.  Will be making this cake again.

This the best cake you will make, bar none !!!!I am a baker and my husband says this is the best thing I have ever baked...hmmm!! I was leary about a boxed mix but you will not be able to tell the difference, I used a Betty Crocker Triple Chocolate Fudge cake mix. If you want raves, this is the cake for you. Thanks Caitlin for sharing this wonderful recipe with us

OMG omg omg omg....Oh....My....God!!! Absolutely the best choloclate cake ever.  Made exactly per recipe.  Was worried the batter seemed really thick.  Didn't have any chocolate of coffee liqueur, added a little over a 1/4 cup brown rum... Found that the rum taste comes across too strongly for my taste.  Will probably not use alcohol in the batter in the future - but absolutely the moistest, most sinful, richest chocolate cake ever.  To die for!

A big hit with everyone I've served these to! The one big recommendation I'd make is to use chocolate liqueur instead of coffee .. the chocolate just makes it!  Trust me, no need for icing or frosting, a simple dusting of powdered sugar and fresh rasp- or strawberries makes it decadent and fancy. (I made this in mini bundt pans and they were adorable!)

Oh. My. Word! This was amazing! Moist and tender and oh, so chocolately! I did make one small change: I used a double shot of espresso from the coffee shop instead of the coffee liqueur. So yummy! I'm definitely going to play with this recipe--use different flavors of cake mix and pudding, add different chips to the chocolate recipe, etc. Thank you, Caitlin, for this recipe!

Added about a tablespoon of vanilla and only used one cup of the Ghiardelli semisweet chocolate chips.  Cake turned out nice and moist but maybe next time I will use 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips to please true chocolate lovers but I thought this was chocolatey enough with the one cup.  Extra chips would also make it gooey which might also make it even more special.  Used a strawberry glaze recipe I found elsewhere on this site which added a nice color contrast (this was even commented on by one of the men eating the cake!) and which provided a contrast in flavor as well. Next time I think I will use a raspberry glaze instead since I think that goes better with the dark chocolate.  Everyone was pleased with my results though, I liked it as well, so I'll definitely be making this again.

Voted best chocolate cake ever by all of my family. My husband even stopped himself short from making teasing comments; that's how much he wants me to make it again. The only changes I made were that I used Hersey's special dark chips and instant fudge pudding mix. I topped it with fresh whipped cream & strawberries. Absolutely 5 Yummmmmmmmmmmmmm cake!

Thank you for this recipe. I would give it 10 out of 5 stars if I could.  I have made this cake at least a dozen times now and I get such wonderful comments every time.  I now get requests for the cake - not  the recipe but they ask me to bring the cake.  I have done it with and without the chocolate chips and I have also done it with liquor (I used grand marnier) and with espresso coffe instead of the liquor (much preferred).  I iced it with a homemade chocolate butter cream icing and took it to a local restaurant the other evening where we were celebrating a friends birthday.  We had leftover cake and we gave a hunk of it to the waitress and she shared it with the kitchen people and they actually asked if I made cakes professionallly.  I don't it's that the cake is that good. Wonderful!!

I made this cake twice.  First time: followed the recipe except used half the amount of sour cream (I was trying to be somewhat healthy) and used Bailey's Irish Cream with hint of Creme Carmel.  The cake tasted more like a chocolate chip muffin - which was delicious but I wanted it to taste more like a cake.   Second time: followed the recipe exactly (again used Bailey's Irish Cream with a Hint of Creme Carmel) and it definitely tasted like a cake.  It was moist and delicious.  Everyone raved about it and wanted to know what the ingredients were.  My sister even went for seconds! Topping: The cake is very rich and heavy. I wanted something light to top it off so I filled the center with fresh strawberries and drizzled white chocolate ganache over the top (search: Chocolate Ganache - I used Ghirardelli Classic White chips and didn't add in the rum).  The ganache is very rich but because only drizzled it, it added a hint of another flavor and made the cake look like it came from a fancy bakery.

Loved it! A huge hit! This cake is a foundation...build it anyway you want. I didn't have chocolate pudding so I used vanilla pudding and devils food cake mix. My hubby doesn't like the flavor of coffee so I used a 1/2 cup of water and 2 tsp of vanilla. It turned out GREAT.   The next time I made it I used a lemon cake mix, lemon pudding, omit the coffee liqueur and again used water and vanilla and added poppy seeds instead of chocolate chips.  Think of the possiblities...

I can't say enough about this recipe.  I have mixed up the recipe a bit to make, Mandarin Orange,  Key Lime cake, Chocolate Andies mint cake, Chocolate cherry cake, Lemon cake, Carrot Cake and many more.  They are all delish.

Outstanding! So easy to make and so incredibly good. I did not add the coffee liquor because I don't like coffee. You would never know this cake came from a box. I normally would never eat cake without frosting but this really does not need it. Everyone in our house loved it.

This is a cake for those with a preference for dark chocolate. I used duncan hines devil's food cake mix and jello devil's food instant pudding mix. When I took it out of the oven it fell in the middle--maybe I took it out too soon--but it was fine when I turned it upside down out of the bundt pan. Served it warm with Chocolate Ganache Icing, per LadyJaypee's example, and my Mom & husband loved it and gave it a 5. I will make it again and use 1 cup sour cream instead of 2 cups--I just think 2 cups is too much. I used 1/2 coffee and 1/2 chocolate liqueur. Very moist & tender and would be fine with just a dusting of powdered sugar but the ganache puts it over the top. I'd like to try with the kahlua next time.

I've made chocolate cakes using this recipe countless times, including two birthday cakes. It's really a morale booster to an amateur cook when you see the reception this cake gets! I remembered my cousins literally jostling one another for more cake! One of the birthday cakes I made served over 80 people and was wiped out within a couple of hours.
I've learnt to add the chocolate chips (I use the mini ones) after pouring the batter into the pan, and since I started doing that, none of the cakes have stuck to the bottom. I've also substituted the coffee flavored liqueur with chocolate syrup each time. And when making in a regular pan instead of a Bundt pan, my baking time exceeds an hour. Thanks Caitlin for this great chocolate cake recipe!

I have made this cake 4 times in the last 2 years.  Each time it has been a hit with my family that is full of people that CAN COOK!  Each year it is a festive cooking parade of who can bring what that is mouth-watering, 100% delicious.  Each time I make this cake I use a higher quality ingredient.  This year I went out and used the best of the best.  I used Godiva chocolate liquer, Land O' Lakes sour cream, Ghirardelli cocoa powder (to flour the bundt pan with) and Hersheys mini kisses.  I decided to pipe chocoloate fudge frosting around the bottom of the cake and make rosettes on the top 1/2" apart from each other for presentation.  Last year I used strawberries dipped in chocolate for presentation.  No matter how to decorate this cake it is a hit all by itself!

This is quite a cake - After such raves in the review section, I expected a whole lote of chocolatey-ness, and I wasn't disappointed.  Just some points I took note of...
1-The recipe itself is a bit on the pricey side... it's definitely the kind you have to go and buy ingredients for, so convenience wasn't great, however... 
2-Because of this, the recipe was SO fast and easy to prepare... Five minutes, tops, guys! 
3-DO NOT omit the chocolate chips... I thought 2 cups seemed a bit much, especially since the batter was quite chocolatey as it was, so I cut it down to 1 1/2 cups...It still tasted fabulous, but the chips really are vital...
4-I think you can get at least 16 servings, not 12.
Thanks for the terrific recipe - it was devoured by the lucky tasters, and I will definitely be making it again!

I have a chocoholic boyfriend and am always looking for new, easy recipes. Made this one for Christmas Eve and it was a huge hit.  Couldn't find my bundt pan so made it in a 9x13 metal pan and it turned out great.  Will definitely make this one again!!

Cooking is certainly my passion, however, to me, baking is a chore; therefore, when I do have to bake, I try to find easy and delicious recipes that don't require a lot of time. This cake couldn't have been any easier or more delicious. Thanks so much Caitlin for the perfect ending to our dinner party!

Unbelievable when it's straight out of the oven - it's so light moist and not too heavy.  I used free sour cream and I can't believe it's not butter instead of butter and eggbeaters and only one cup of mini chocolate chips nd it's just incredible when it's warm.  When it cooled down, it wasn't as good, so I like to heat it up, b/c it just seemed like a super light chocolate cake - but that's also b/c I tried to make it low fat! :)  Also I baked it at 325 for one hour and it was perfect :)  I prefer this over the Deep Dark Chocolate Cake on this website.  This cake is more chocolatey and richer and fluffier - not as sugary.

I've baked this cake 3 times in the past 2 weeks with the same result.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was using 1 1/2 cups mini choco. chips.  I use a 10", 12 cup Bundt pan sprayed with Baker's Joy (no problems inverting cake, flour doesn't show). The cakes rises beautifully (to the top of the Bundt pan), but falls to half that size when cooling.  Is that normal?  I added a warm chocolate glaze to the finished cake and everyone has LOVED it!!  It just looks a little funny--dense and short.  I will make again.

Like all of the other 154 cooks, I have to say this is one of the best chocolate cakes for chocoholics like myself. It is extremely moist, rich and chocolatey.Is great without icing or filling, but I elected to drizzle it with the raspberry sauce found on this website! Yummy!

If you are a chocolate lover, you MUST have this cake! I made it for a dinner party and it got rave reviews. It is very, very moist and keeps very well in the fridge. We added hot fudge and ice cream to finish it off and it was absolutely delicious! I cooked it for 50 minutes and although it looked a bit undone, a toothpick told me otherwise. Be sure to check it at the 45 minute mark because the pudding begins to burn around that time if you aren't careful.

I was in a crunch to make something for my mother's Thanksgiving dinner (since I had put it off forever).  I picked this recipe because it looked so easy, though I doubted it would be as good as all the reviewers said--man, was I wrong!  I don't even like chocolate very much, and I loved this cake.  I only got a tiny sliver, though, because everyone else devoured it!  I've already had requests to make it for every time the family gets together.

I don't drink, so I didn't know what kind of liquor tasted like coffee--I picked Kahlua since it was a name I recognized, and it turned out really well (although I still don't know if it's coffee flavored or not--ha ha!).  I also used half semi-sweet and half bittersweet chocolate chips, since that's what I had on hand.  Luckily, my family is made up of dark chocolate lovers, so this went over very well.

I tried to turn it out of the Bundt pan after 10 minutes, and immediately realized my mistake, since only the bottom half came out!  So I put it back into the pan and when it cooled I turned it out again, and the cake had "sealed" itself up, it was so moist!  Nobody but me even knew it had broken in half!  I also sprinkled some confectioners sugar on the top, and it looked really great!  Everybody kept asking me if I'd bought it instead of made it!

So easy, so fast, so yummy! I've only made it once, and it's already a family favorite.  If I hadn't made it myself, I would never have believed it was made from a mix.  If you love chocolate, you have to try this!

Best cake ever! Everyone asks for the recipe. Only suggestion is to butter the bunt pan then use the cake mix to coat it, if you use flour it leaves a white residue on the cake that isn't very attractive. You can make this into cupcakes but they aren't nearly as good as the bunt cake.

awesome cake!! I followed the directions and only subbed the coffee flavored liquor for Chambord (raspberry liquor) as recommended by another reviewer. No one suspected that it was from a box, but I had to fess up since they all wanted the recipe any way! I topped with vanilla bean buttercream frosting (found online), which was a PERFECT fit. Next time I will use only 1 cup of chips though, as  2 cups made it SO rich. This is my new fav chocolate cake recipe! thanks Caitlin

I made this cake with 1 cup semi-sweet mini chocolate chips. I also made whipped cream with heavy whipping cream and a little powdered sugar beat until stiff to serve on the side. This cake is better the next day in my opinion.

I would give this a 5+ star for flavor. The only problem that I had with this cake was when I flipped the bundt cake over to cool it on the wire rack it fell apart - I am guessing this was due to the fact that its super moist? Anyways, I put it back together as best as I could and once it cooled I topped it with powdered sugar. My husband also made a nice rum glaze to pour over the top - delicious! I would love to make this again - kinda skeptical though since it did fall apart. We'll see.

Oh My Gosh! This is so good. I used two round cake pounds and strong coffee for the water. I also made a not so sweet chocolate butter cream frosting just between the layers and right on top so it dripped down. I get so many request for this cake. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you for a great recipe.

Delicious! Even better, its so easy to make! I cringed at the idea of a “box“ cake but took my chances since I saw other had the same feeling and gave it good reviews....wow This will be my go to cake when I'm in a pinch. Fellow foodies adored this. I took this to a small gathering (4 people) so there was some left and I took the  remaining into work for the guys....while they are generally very happy to see me walk in with baked goods this one got particularly rave reviews....one even showed up in my office later asking if he could pay me to bake him another one because it was the best chocolate cake he'd ever had! Our resident "sour cream hater" did a double take when I told him what was in it...then asked if I had anymore! :) I used Godiva liqueur and 2 cups of the mini chocolate chips. I think next I'll try the Baileys Irish Cream and I'm thinking a red velvet version....but I can't decide on a liqueur for that one yet....hm....back to the kitchen to experiment!

Wow!  I don't know what to add that hasn't already been said.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was moist, rich, and wonderful.  I did not flour the pan - simply sprayed with PAM and let it cool completely.  It released perfectly from the pan.  What a treat!  Thanks, Caitlin.

This cake was easy to mix together and baked beautifully. It was very moist as well. However, it was kind of bland. It definitely needed frosting.

I would give this recipe 20 stars if I could.  It is the most moist cake I have ever made.  It does make a lot of batter, so be sure to use an angel food pan instead of the bundt pan.  Oh, and by the way, it is even better the second day.  As an aside, I only had pistachio instant pudding and it was just fine, so figure any of the instants will work just fine.  Definitely it is a keeper.

I used milk chocolate chips because it's what I had on had, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Sprinkled with powdered sugar after turning out of pan.  Cake was to die for when served warm & really good with vanilla ice cream.  Only reason I gave 4 stars is because once it cooled, it was not quite as moist as I was expecting, but at the same time not too dry.  Still a really good chocolate cake recipe and will definitely make again, because it is a very good cake, and my son really liked it.  Would also serve to guests or bake for a special occasion.

Love it!!  After reading other reviews, I opted for the Bailey's instead of coffee liqueur, I can imagine it would be great with other flavors as well.  Also used the mini chocolate chips.  My oven tends to run a little hot, so I baked it about 55 minutes instead of 60.  Super moist & delicious!

Such a wonderful cake, but so easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly except I put less choclate chips in. I would go ahead and put all of them in the next time, and maybe experiment with some white chocolate or mild chocolate chips. We had several people over for a casual party, and the entire cake was gone by the end of the night.

If you like A LOT of chocolate then this is your cake. We like chocolate, but this cake should be called chocolate overload! Just not for us- if I try again I'll skip the chocolate chips because the cake part is incredibly delish!

I substituted the sour cream for lower fat sour cream and the cake didnt turn out rich at all :( dont do that! I also used a chocolate almond liqueur and it wasnt as exciting as a fruity liqueur would have been. the cupcakes I made from this recipe were a great texture and look amazing! I will be using it again, with regular sour cream lol

So the cake is moist, but honestly I don't think it's worth the calories!  It has a boxy type taste.  I followed the instructions except I used: Reduced Fat Sour Cream, 1c of choc chips, Sugar Free Instant Pudding, and 1/4 c baileys 1/4 c coffee.  I baked it in a bundt pan at 350 for 1 hour and it came out a lil' over done. I will def have to had a ganache to keep this good. So bummed :-/

This cake turned out amazing!  I used fat free sour cream and did not take away from the cake at all.  I also used chocolate milk instead of the liquer, only 1 cup of chocolate chips, used cocoa instead of flower to coat the pan per other people's reviews.  I used the "Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze" recipe for the topping but used white chocolate chips.  I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and it turned out so great!!!  I had no problem getting it out of the pan either :)

Awesome cake!  Incredibly easy, and very, very tasty.  Moist, chocolaty goodness.  THis was the first cake I've ever made, believe it or not, and I made it for my wife's birthday.  Everyone enjoyed it, and my brother-in-law, who doesn't normally care a lot for cake, went back for seconds.  I served it with a raspberry sauce made from a recipe on this site, and it was delicious.

Amazing!  Added just over a cup of chocolate chips (mix of semi-sweet and dark), used low-fat sour cream and sugar-free pudding.  Substituted applesauce for oil, decreasing to 1/4 cup.  Also added 2 tsp instant coffee granules to bring out richness of chocolate.

This was good, but I usually use the Lisa's Chocolate Chocolate Chip cake recipe also on this website and I think I prefer it.  I didn't have coffee liquor, so I used Creme de Cocoa liquor.  Everyone at work liked it.  Made 24 cupcakes, baked for 18-20 minutes.  Topped with Whipped Cream Cheese frosting also from this site.

This is easy and consistently good. I use 1 cup of mini chips and make a glaze with the other cup, 2T of butter and 1T of liquer. I fill it with choc. mousse which is just 2 cups of heavy cream whipped with 1 pkg instant choc. pudding. Pour the glaze over, fill the center with mousse and top with sliced strawberries.

This did not stay moist, but instead turned into a dry, mealy chocolate mess.

My fiancé liked it, but I was disappointed. If I’m going to eat something this caloric (and boy, does it top the calorie charts), I’m going to make it something that I enjoy eating instead of chocolate flavored sawdust. 

I would never make this again for myself, but if he asks, I might make it again for my fiancé.

OMG this recipe was absolutely delicious.  I'm not a chocolate fan and I probably ate more of this cake than my chocoholic husband!  I'm getting ready to make this for the second time in a week.  If you love chocolate this cake is for you and if you don't like it you should still make it, you won't be disappointed.

Tastes great and super moist. I dusted with powdered sugar, because like others have stated, it needs no frosting, although my husband likes it with some whipped cream. The last time I made it, I used strong coffee instead of Kahlua (buncha non-drinkers), and used mini chips. The mini chips were more subtle; I prefer the standard size chips for my chocolate fix. I also used someone's advice about covering with foil the last 10 mins. Cooked perfectly.
**Word of advice: Since the batter is really thick - more like bread dough consistency, if you have a Kitchen Aid stand mixer with dough hook, by all means use it. It's a whole lot easier than the hand mixer and not nearly as messy.

This cake was okay. I think I read so many great reviews that my expectations were set too high.  This cake does not taste homemade.  It tastes like it is made from a box.  That is not the taste I was looking for.

I made this cake because of rave reviews, and because of how easy it was. It had to look good because it was for our school's Fall Carnival Cake Sale. It turned out beautifully. I did add a simple chocolate icing. According to the family that bought it, this cake is "to die for". I followed the directions exactly, no variations. Can't wait to make one for my family!

I followed the recipe except I substiuted Amaretto for the coffee  liquer.  The day I made it I thought,"Yeah, good but I could have made brownies."  The next day I tried a piece and now I give it six stars!  It has all of the flavor and moist consistancy of a lighter version of a brownie - in a cake.  Somehow 100 times better than both.  Definitely let this cake sit overnight before serving.

Wow! Everyone loves this cake! People who don't even like chocolate have told me how wonderful it is. Usually I make it just like the directions say but I have substituted Hershey's surup for the liquer and gotten really good results. I like to make a glaze out of butter and Giradelli Milk chocolate chips. I also found that it is much better if you eat it the next day.

As if this one needs another 5 star review--but this cake is ridiculously delicious.  I've been making it for a long time, and I've found that if you bake the bundt for 50 minutes, then cover it with foil for the last 10 minutes, the edges don't dry out at all and the center is baked through.  There will be stuff sticking to your tester, even though it is ready.  Make this cake, you won't be sorry!  And to the previous poster, I'm glad that your family enjoyed it!

I give it five stars for being the perfect cake for a chocolate craving. I am not a fan of dark chocolate so I was a bit nervous but don't fret over the dark chocolate...just try it out. I used the Kahlua but I can't taste in in the cake. One warning, like the recipe says the batter is super thick. It got so thicj in my beaters that it started rising and almost got in the motor part so be careful with that. Have a spatula on hand to scrape as you mix.

Absolute success at the neighborhood last-of-the-summer bbq today!!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  Other reviewers recommended mini-chocolate chips due to regular size chips sinking to bottom of cake; couldn't find any minis in my small town, so ground regular chocolate chips up in a grinder.  VERY thick batter, by the way, as the recipe indicates.  And VERY moist, flavorful cake!  Even though I oiled and floured my bundt pan, unfortunately, the top of the cake stuck to the pan, so it wasn't the best-looking result.  But I made the best of it and pieced it together and called it a Chocolate Kahlua Earthquake Cake, and everyone RAVED about it.  Drizzled it with Chocolate Ganache Icing recipe from this website, but replaced the brandy with kahlua.  Outstanding!

Fantastic!  The taste is peferctly choclately and the recipe so very, very simple.  I have also had great success with raspberry liquor.  I have baked it in two eight inch rounds and then frosted it with chocolate butter cream in an attempt to put my guests into a chocolate induced coma.  But the nicest results is when I baked it in a ten inch square and then cut out circles with a biscuit cutter, drizzled with satiny glaze and topped with raspberries.  Very pretty presentation.  Thank you Caitlin for the recipe.

Very good.  Easy to make and tastes great!  I did this as my Easter Dinner dessert.  I also took a small bag of unsweetened frozen raspberries, 2 tsp sugar, 2 tbsp of cornstarch and 1/2 cup of water and cooked this up on the stove.  When we had the cake I spooned the raspberry sauce on top.  It was a hit!  The cake was moist and chocolatey and the raspberries were a bit tart so it was a very nice combination.  I'll definitely make this again.

You've heard the old saying: "The way to a man's heart is through his stomach".  Well, the way to my husband's heart is through this chocolate cake!!!  WOW! So moist, so rich, so decadent.  No frosting is needed, trust me.  My chips were still noticeable in the cake so maybe I'll try the mini chips next time.  Oh yes, there WILL be a next time!

Loved it!  Used low-fat sour cream and "Special Dark" chocolate chips and it came out perfect.  The leftovers only got better w/ a day or two in the fridge.  Thank you!

I made the cake, but it flopped.  I forgot to adjust for living at 5000 feet.  Taste was excellent, but it looked like a dead spider sitting on the cake plate.

Well, I had high expectations for this cake.... AND ALL OF THEM WERE SURPASSED! My parents, who don't even like sweets, LOVED this cake! You only need a thin slice along with a scoop of vanilla ice cream to be in heaven! I used kahlua for the coffee liquer and highly reccommend it!
P.S. I made this for v-day: good idea!

Wowsers!  I know my comments will sound repetative but what can I do!?  This is SO easy and SO delicious!!!  I have made this twice and it turned out great both times.  I sprayed the bundt with Pam with great results.  Also, don't skip on the Godiva - well worth it, adds a rich delicious gourmet flavor.  Also, use the chocolate chunks rather than regular chips - they are so much more fun.  And don't bother with any frosting or anything, totally redundant with this rich cake.  The ladies at work are in awe that a cake of this quality was made by a man!!!!  If you leak the fact that a store-bought cake mix was involved I will have to track you down!!  Let's keep this our little secret, okay?  Well, enough ranting about this cake, I need to go give myself a insulin shot!!!  :)

Great recipe! And you can tweak it to your liking. I used devil food cake mix, chocolate syrup instead of liquer(other people said to do this) and milk chocolate chips. I also did a powedered sugar frosting drip and put a little more powdered sugar on top...it looked beautiful! And tasted even better!

One word - Thud! When I tasted this cake, I thot I had died and gone to chocolate heaven. How can anything so easy to make in so little time taste sooo good? I highly recommend this recipe - will make you look like a Jacques Torres apprentice. It is so rich, a simple dusting of icing sugar is enough to keep it elegant. Only thing I changed is to use strong instant coffee as I did not have coffee liquer on hand. Definitely a keeper.

DEE-LISH!!!  I used amaretto in place of the coffee, heavenly taste!  One warning, don't overestimate cooking time, I baked 45 min. at suggested temp, toothpick test came out wet, but the extra 15 min. made the outer edges too crispy.  Next time I will follow recommendation and lower oven temp.  Will DEFINITELY make again and again!!!!

One of the best chocolate cakes I have made. I served this warm and it was gooey inside. Tastes like it came from a pastry chef at a fine restaurant.
As a variation I made individual mini-bundt cakes, what a hit!

This cake was awesome! I used 1/4 cup Kahlua and 1/4 cup Godiva Chocolate Liqueur for the coffee flavored liqueur.  The cake took exactly one hour to bake and I didn't have any problem getting the cake out of the pan after letting it cool for 15 minutes. I took the advise of another reviewer and topped the cake with melted white chocolate that I thinned with a little cream.  I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely sinful.  I've made this several times already, and it's always a big hit at dinner parties.  I use cocoa powder instead of flour for the pan to avoid that white floury coating on the outside of the cake.  I've substituted 1/2 C of Godiva liquor for the coffee flavored liqueur one time, the next time I used 1/4 C espresso, 1/4 C Godiva liqueur, and it tasted great.
The perfect recipe for a chocoholic with a major sweet tooth!  Thanks!

I had to give it a five-star rating for quickness and easiness (because it warranted that), but overall it was a one-star, umimpressive disappointment! Everyone I cook/bake for has high expectations and I was embarassed by this mass-distributed (in one form or another) recipe. I guess it's not the fault of the person that posted it, but the people that rated it, come on! Are you so easy to please? Sorry to be controversial. To be fair, it did look nice. Sorry. Final verdict: not worth the extra tummy crunches.=)

WOW!!!  This cake is so delicious and rich!  Will satisfy even the most severe chocolate craving.  I took it to a birthday celebration and everyone loved it.  (But note it's a dense cake, not birthday-cake style.)  I even used light sour cream and substituted Bailey's Irish Cream for the Kahlua, and it turned out superbly!  Definitely recommend for chocolate-lovers.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for a family gathering and everyone loved it!  It especially thrilled the chocoholic women in our family.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  Someone suggested it might be good with a chocolate glaze drizzled over the top.  I will have to make it again and try that!

I have made this cake for a wedding cake and a fancy birthday cake by icing it with butter cream and making a ganache to pour over it and let it run down the sides.  Both times I got RAVE reviews.  Now, if I make it as a bundt, I create a glaze and use a technique I learned from another bundt cake.  Do the regular glaze recipe of 2 cups powdered sugar and 2-3 tbsp of milk and add a couple of tbs of cocoa if you want chocolate.  Then, when the cake is still a bit warm you turn it out of the pan and then put it back in.  Pour the glaze over the bottom of the cake in the pan and it should release easily in about 10-15 minutes when you turn it onto a cake plate.  Tastes kind of like a cake donut when you glaze it this way.

As Naples said, there is a MUCH better version of this recipe on this site. Two cups of sour cream and 1/2 cup of flavored coffee liqueur is UNnecessary. I much prefer the "other" recipe to this one. Mind you, the cake wasn't horrible, but it was hard to mix and didn't bake up that well. All of my cupcakes sank after I took them out of the oven. Thank heavens for frosting.

I use Kalua for the coffee-flavored liqueur.  Whenever I take it somewhere, I call it my Kalua Chocolate Cake.  It devine, super moist, and wonderfully rich.  It literally gets eaten in seconds.  This is my go-to recipe whenever I need a fast potluck dessert to take.  Super quick and easy to prepare.

Best darn chocolate cake ever..For the serious chocolate lover that needs a cake that is not goo but is rich & delicious..I made my son's confirmation cake with this being the bottom layer for half a sheet cake. Used a good brand canned strawberry filling on top of the chocolate frosting I made..a vanilla layer was on top & I made delicious white buttercream over all with yellow accent frosting & flowers..OOOHH How wonderful it was!!! I tripled the recipe & it came out fine..now,I am going to use this recipe to make my birthday cake..cause this recipe is the best & it's easy!!!

After making this cake what feels like 100 times I have switched it up! Try this.... Replace all chocolate with white. White cake, vanilla pudding, white chocolate chips and butterscotch liqueur instead of the coffee. Just as mouth watering but caters to those who are silly enough to not be a fan of chocolate. :)

Wonderful! I just used regular chocolate cake mix, used part mini-chips and part regular (and dropped the total down to about 1-1/2 cups), and subbed strong coffee for the coffee liqueur, and it was just lovely. I decided to serve it with some homemade whipped cream mixed with mashed raspberries -- I didn't add any sugar so it was a bit tart, and this paired really nicely with the very sweet, rich cake and lightened and freshened it up a bit. It was a big hit and very pretty with the pink cream served on top!

I've made this recipe as cupcakes  many, many times I always get GREAT feedback!  I makes about 3 dozen cupcakes.  Insead of frosting (the cake is already pretty sweet), I make a chocolate ganache and dip the tops in it, then sprinkle with mini chocolate chips.  As others suggested I always use 2/3 cup of liqueur instead of 1/2.

This cake is decadent, so moist!  I made this about a month ago and didn't change a thing with the recipe.  I'm making it again today.  Usually, when I make a cake, it never gets all eaten.  But THIS cake....it was GONE!  Definitely a keeper!

I didn't have the liqueur so used some rum instead, but mine just didn't have the moistness that everyone else alluded too.  May have over baked - cooked for ~25-30 min for cup cakes vs. the bundt pan.

I've been baking a version of this cake since the 90's.. it's always a huge hit. I too mix up the flavorings but prefer using Kahlua. I don't use either chips mini chips ~ try using a good quality chocolate (milk, dark white depending on the flavor you're baking) that you cut/chip yourself ~ to die for!

This cake makes me doubt the accuracy of the rating system.  I baked it as a "thank you" for a friend, and was embarrassed when I tasted it and found out how awful it was!  I followed the recipe exactly....it WAS moist, but left a bad aftertaste.  Throwing this one out.

I have tested 4 different chocolate cake recipes at the same that are similar on this website and this one is good but not the best. I like the Too Much Chocolate Cake and the Double Chocolate Brownie Cake recipes better. I also recommend Chocolate Lovers Favorite Cake if you like a hint of almond flavor.

One of the easiest, best chocolate cakes I've ever had.  I imagine you could customize this recipe all kinds of ways.  I used Irish Cream instead of coffee liqueur, and it was excellent.  Probably would be fantastic with any liqueur.

I even used a cake mix with pudding in it in addition to the box of pudding.  No problems.

Over the 'top' amazing...been making this cake for a year now, and "never have leftovers". I have tried several different types of chocolate chips, and really enjoyed it when I use one small bag of white chocolate chips, and one small bag of milk chocolate chips...amazing cake!! I use a boiled (egg white) icing and find it's a great alternative to just dusting with icing sugar. Anyone looking for a great cake...this is it!! Look no further!! :)

Also known as "Triple chocolate Cake" This recipe has been around for at least 10-15 years...but usually just coffee instead of the alcohol....and I am guessing the alcohol would evaporate and make it a little drier. Best choclate cake ever....never lasts long enough in this house to go stale.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  I never thought a box cake could be so delicious.  I have been married for over 21 years and my husband said this was the best chocolate cake I have ever made.  I made it for my son's 11th birthday, my husband's birthday and now my son wants it for his friend birthday party - 3 times in two weeks.  It is soooo moist.  I used Kahlua for the liqueur and omitted the chocolate chips.  The first time I made it, I only used 1 cup of chips, but just a little too sweet for my liking.  Try it!  You won't be disappointed.

I doubled this recipe to be able to use it as dessert for 24 men.  (!)  I used 4 8 inch springform pans and baked them for just over an hour.  Turned out beautifully! I used just over a cup of Kahlua for the double batch and you couldn't taste it all that much.  The very best chocolate cake from a box.  I will try next to make it with homemade choc cake.

The texture of the cake is a little unusual. The only thing I changed in this recipe was I used fat-free sour cream instead of full fat. I wondered if the fat-free sour cream is what affected the texture. It is possible that the emulsifiers and stabilizers in fat-free sour cream could have given the cake it's gummy texture. The taste was fine, but nothing exceptional. I probably won't be making this cake again, not even to test out my sour cream theory.

This cake is extremely rich and chocolatey.  It's also very dense and moist.  The only variation I did was using one cup of chips instead of two.  It's probably a 5 star cake, but it was a little too chocolate for my taste.  My hubby loved it, and I will probably make it again for an office or private party.  Chocolate lovers will definitely enjoy this cake.

Just made this for the first time and oh my...it is heavenly!!!! My 13 yo son would have given it 100 stars if possible! I used the recipe and only had to sub coffee for the liqueur because we did not have any. I added about a tablespoon of vanilla to it also. We used a dark chocolate cake mix, devils food pudding and the rest was the same. I added Hershey's dark chocolate chips and then drizzled white and dark chocolate over the top! WOW! What an awesome desert. I will have to make one to take to work and see what the co-workers think. I think that the chocolate raspberry chips would be great in it too!!!!

Used the mini chip recommendation with a butter recipe fudge cake mix and light sour cream along with the other required ingredients.  It is decadent!  I would put this up against any restaurant cake.

Thought I'd try this cake as I was in a hurry for something sweet.  The texture was spongy and gummy even though it was thoroughly baked.  It stuck to the roof of my mouth.  It was a little bit better when I topped it with some chocolate buttercream frosting.

Unquestionably the BEST chocolate cake I have ever made or eaten.  Definitely use the mini-size chips, they add moisture & silkiness and just enough texture.  I topped this with a simple ganache made from equal parts espresso-flavored 60% chocolate and heavy cream.  Seriously to die for.

Came out perfectly! Used cherry liqueur instead of the coffee one. The taste is very faint tho. Also, only used 1 cup of semi sweet chips. Very good!

This is wonderful! I didn't have the liqueur, so I substituted with 1 3/4 TBSP raspberry flavoring with water to make the 1/2 cup, and it gave a wonderful raspberry chocolate flavor. YUM! Thanks for the recipe!

i made this into cupcakes. AMAZING! totally didnt need frosting/icing but I was bringing them to work on a summer day, ergo, a dusting of confectioner's sugar was NOT going to cut it. Instead, I dipped strawberries in dark chocolate and placed one on top of each cupcake. VERY well received.

Today was the first time I've got to personally taste this cake. My sister makes it, but it always disappears before I can get to it. I made it once and sent it with my husband to a picnic. Didn't get to try it that time either. Well, today I finally got to try it...while everyone raves about it, it wasn't as good as I was expecting. Not sure why; maybe I was just hoping for more based on the high ratings. But I'm sure I will make it again since others seem to really like it and it's so quick and easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand. I will, however, try making it with mini chips the next time. I had a really hard time cutting the cake today. The chips stayed solid and the knife didn't want to cut through them cleanly. As a result, it was pretty messy and not the best presentation.

Excellent Cake! Tastes like it was made from scratch.  I made a layer cake and frosted it with a chocolate icing and it was yummy.  I  used chocolate syrup instead of coffee flavored liqueur. I also used 1 1/2 cups mini chocolate chips.

Strange texture !!!  Taste was fine, but nothing to write home about. The funky eggy/gelatin texture was just too much for me.   Looking at the reviews I now understand why its only beginner cooks rating it so highly.

I made this today, and it's amazing. I baked it for exactly one hour, then took it out without testing and it was perfectly done. I used light sour cream and did not have coffee liquor, so used a cup of plain old Maxwell House I had made this morning, not really strong, but not weak. It was sooooo chocolaty! No frosting needed. Also used mini chips as others suggested. Not sure I'll spend money on liquor since it was so good with just coffee next time I make it, and I will definitely be making this again.

this cake is also commonly known as "Emily McCormick's In a Pinch Chocolate Cake," and my grandmother has been making it for as long as I can remember. It freezes beautifully, and it's wonderful made into a layer cake with either a chocolate ganauche between the layers or sweetened whipped cream between the layers.

If you love moist chocolate cakes, this is THE de facto standard to beat!

It's so moist, so yummy, the only people who won't like it are those with chocolate allergies!

This cake was pure EVIL (in a good way)!!!  I baked it in a 9x13 glass pan and it fit perfectly - was finished in a little over an hour. I used cherry brandy liquor instead of coffee flavored. I used the Easy Bundt Cake Glaze from this site to frost. It was soooo rich and delish that many of my friends could not even finish their slice.  My boyfriend thought that it was way tooo much- but true chocolate lovers will appreciate this cake!!!

This recipe is a standout.  My sister (who's a sweet freak)and her family loved this cake.  My parents and hubby loved it as well.  I loved that it is so extremely moist.  The only thing that I need to mention is for you to MAKE SURE YOU LET THE CAKE SIT IN THE BUNDT PAN FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR and a half BEFORE TRYING TO EXTRACT IT.  I tried extracting mine after 45 minutes, and it almost split into two.  I topped it with Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze from this site, and freshly sliced strawberries from my garden.  This cake is so impressive, my husband requested that I make it again for his boss's 4th of July party!

I wasn't impressed with this at all, which was extremely disappointing given the high reviews.  I found the consistency of the cake to be too much like pudding and not enough like batter.  Because of that I had to cook longer than an hour to get the inside done while the outer areas burned and hardened.  Was way too much batter for a 10-inch Bundt pan.  I won't be making this again.

This cake is a chocoholics dream. Easy and delicious.  The batter is very thick and the cake ends up with a dense, brownie-like consistency. This cake actually tastes better after a few days, but it rarely lasts that long.  I use brewed espresso or strong coffee in place of the liquor and I always use semi-sweet mini chocolate chips because many reviewers mentioned that the regular size chips tend to sink to the bottom.  The mini chips literally melt right into the cake. I have made this cake several times and everyone asks for the recipe. This just might be the best chocolate cake ever!

Umm Umm Umm after every bite!  Loved this cake.  I would definitely make it in a bundt pan only. I made two cakes one in a heart shaped pan and it took longer to bake and dried out a bit. The one I made in the bundt pan was perfecto.

Delish! I made this cake for a dinner party I was attending and everyone really enjoyed. I topped the cake with the "satiny chocolate glaze" from this website. I do believe it needed some sort of topping. I think a cherry pie filling would taste excelent on top.

Absolutely incredible! I added a little milk and used most of the sour cream called for. I used half Kahlua, and half creme de cocoa. I also added 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper - it really brings out the flavor of the dark chocolate. I read what others said and covered the cake for the last 10 mins of baking with foil. The texture was fudgy and dense. Perfect for serving lots of people a gourmet tasting rich dessert. I bet it would be delicious served with a thickened berry sauce - like raspberries, but was amazing on its own too!

Awesome cake.  Made it 3 times in 2 weeks to take to holiday gatherings.  Huge hit for those of us who would like an alternative to pumpkin pie!  Followed the directions exactly.  I'll try the white chocolate version next time.

I wish I could give this one 6 stars!  This has to be the easiest and best cake I have ever made, and I have made some that took hours to make.  I made the chocolate as described the 1st time.  I did drizzle it with choc icing and decorated it with some mini choc chips.  2 days later, I made it again using French Vanilla cake mix, white choc pudding, white choc chips and used irish cream instead of the coffee liquer, and drizzled it with cream cheese icing sprinkled with white choc chips; it was even better.  All the kids in my family love it.  Thanks to others who suggested trying other flavors.

In a word, AWESOME!  We loved the chocolate recipe, but just for fun, I also tried a Lemon Cavity Maker Cake. It came out great.  I used lemon cake mix, lemon pudding mix and milk instead of coffee and Kaluha.  The first time I iced it with whipped topping (which melted on the cake, but was wonderful anyway)and the second time I just sifted powdered sugar over the top which looked pretty. We loved both varieties of this SUPER MOIST, easy to make cake!

Easy and delicious!  It looks pretty too.  Simply sifted confectioner's sugar over it as a finishing touch.  Used Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips and 1/4cup milk combined with 1/4cup Kahula instead of a whole 1/2c of the liquor.  Also dusted buttered pan with Nestle cocoa (had some hot cocoa packets laying around) instead of flour.  Baked for 55 min (5 min less than recommended), and it came out perfect.  However, I have a small oven and it may take less time than a conventional.

Very rich and moist cake. My guests loved it. I used mini choco chips and 1/4 cup of strong coffee in place of the liquor. Then added a glaze of melted milk chocolate chips with butter.

Wow what a great cake! I followed the recipe but changed a few things. I used 1/2 cup milk w/2 tbl of instant hazelnut coffee, replaced the sour cream w/vanilla yogurt and only used 1 cup of chips. I took the advice of another member and baked then in mini bundt pans. Moist and even better the next day!

Made this for my husbands b-day -- no one loved it.  Only change I made was using sugar-free pudding (all I had on hand) So possibly was my fault.  Cake was very dense. Put frosing on top and served w/ice cream which the only thing that saved this cake.  Won't try this again.

This was a rich and moist cake.  I substituted milk for coffee.  I made this in 2-9" round pans and cut each making a four layer cake.  Used ganache filling and frosted outside with creamy chocoalte frosting.  What a birthday cake!! WOW!

I made this cake today and it's so moist. I added a 5 oz box of pudding and replaced the alcohol with 1/2 cup of milk and it still came out great. I will definately make again.

This cake is THE best!  Chocoholics will love it!  I did make a few changes.  I used 1 C. chocolate chips instead of two.  I also substituted 1/4 C. milk and 1/4 C. coffee for the 1/2 C. of liqeur.

This cake was just OK.  I covered/stored it properly after it was baked and when I served it, it was very dry.  Only thing I did different was add regular strong coffee instead of the liqueur.  I didn't have any in the house.  We heated each slice in the microwave before we ate it, which made it very good, but overall I was a little dissapointed.  I might make again and bake a few minutes less.  Thanks for the recipe Caitlin.

The only change I made was using Godiva liqour instead of coffee liqour. I receive many compliments on this cake, although some have commented that it is too rich for them.

Um, did Entenmanns give away their "secret" recipe? This cake was alright; nothing special. Tasted like a cake I can purchase at the grocery store. One of the reviewers recommended "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" which is in fact not satiny, and not a glaze. I de-recommend it. I do recommend Guittard Chocolate Chips for all your chocolate-chip needs (ex-boyfriend, cookies, etc).

Not that this recipe needed another 5 star rating - but it was SO good even when I reduced the calories and fat a bit with non-fat sour cream, sugar free pudding and applesauce in place of the oil.  Used Starbucks Liqueur.  YUM!

This is my new favorite chocolate cake. Sooo moist and chocolatley.  It taste like something you would get from a fancy restaraunt.  It was difficult to tell if it was done though.  I baked it for the full time and stuck a toothpick in the center and it seemed a little gooey.  It must be because of the chocolate chips.  I took it out anyway and when it cooled it had set and was perfect!! Thanks again!

This cake is awesome, I used kahlua and baked it for 50 minutes.  Don't forget not to dust it until right before serving or bringing to guests, the powdered sugar gets absorbed otherwise.  It was a huge hit with adults and kids, and like other reviewers stated, was even better the second day.

This cake is every chocoholic's dream!  I usually don't make cakes from mixes but this is one I will be making again & again.  I didn't have sour cream so I substituted milk, vinegar & butter and it still came out great!  I also added cherry liqueur to the batter.  Wow!

I made this with a cake mix that already had the pudding in it and it turned out really great. The mix also came with a small pouch of chocolate syrup that I added in. 
I didn't bother with any frosting because it was so good the way it was and if it ain't broke...
The little mini chocolate chips worked out really well also. 
I noticed when I was mixing it, that it did have a sort of an army-greenish cast to it but the color looks like a normal dark brown after it's fully cooked; which took 50 mins at 350'.
So I wouldn't have any flour coating the outside of the cake, I used a high heat canola cooking spray and it came out of the bundt pan cleanly. 
I will definitely be making this again and will try some of the other reviewer's suggestions. 
Thank you for posting this recipe!

When you want serious chocolate this is it.  My husbad loves this cake.
Followed the recipe exactly.  Delicious, especially when slightly warmed in the microwave and served with a truly good vanila ice cream!  We all think it's best by the 2nd or 3rd day; so I try to plan ahead when I'm going to serve it to guests.  Many requests for the recipe.  Thanks!

This cake was a huge hit at a BBQ I went to last night!  I used sugar free pudding mix, lite sour cream, and 1/3 cup applesauce instead of oil, and it still tasted delicious!  I would recommend this to anyone who loves chocolate...it's a keeper!

This is not my first attempt to this delicious cake, but this time, my 3.5 year was the head chef and me the helper.  Surprise! It's so easy even he can do it!  To cater better to his taste, we added 3 loosely-mashed bananas and layered it in between 2 layers of the mix, and then bake.   All I can say is chocolate & bananas are made for each other... It makes the already scrummy cake even more scrummy.

I LOVE this recipe!!! It was very easy and the end result is a fabulous cake that everyone who tries it raves about.  It definitely does not taste like it starts with a cake mix and I am usually very sensitive to that. I did glaze the cake with a chocolate ganache which I feel made it perfect. I made the ganache by bringing 3/4 cup of heavy cream to a boil and then pouring it over 8 oz. of chopped semisweet chocolate, stirring until the chocolate melted and adding a tablespoon of Bailey's irish creme.  I also substituted Bailey's for the kahlua in the cake.You have to try this recipe--it is fabulous!!

This cake was very easy to make, but be careful to follow the recipe exactly.  I substituted applesauce for the oil to shave off some calories and used irish cream instead of the coffee flavored liqueur.  It turned out terribly.  It was not moist at all, it was very dry.  The irish cream just didn't taste right.  If I try this again I will follow the recipe exactly.  I am going to try the other super chocolatey cake submitteed by Susan Feiler - The Chocolate Lover's Favorite Cake - and see how that turns out.

This wasn't quite what I was expecting. Maybe because I used regular chocolate cake mix instead of dark chocolate. I found it to be too bitter with the coffee liquor. I served it with fresh whipped cream & strawberries at a party, but people went for the other desserts instead :-(

God.  this was - by far - the BEST chocolate cake i have ever had in my life.  i was a little wary of the kahlua (had a wicked bad 'white russian' experience in my youth) but it is imperative to the taste in this cake. i greased & "floured" using hershey's cocoa and dusted the finished product with a tiny bit of powdered sugar before serving and it didn't even need that though it looked really pretty. plus very easy to make...definitely a keeper & will make every xmas from now on.  thank you SO much for sharing!!!!!

What more can I add to the already outstanding reviews? I made this for my sons 15th birthday and we all enjoyed. I used a bundt and needed a bit more baking time than called for. I used Godiva liqueur, mmmm! This is VERY RICH and you should have a beverage close by and perhaps insulin! Enjoy!

This cake was great! I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips and used 1/4 cup Godiva Liqueur and 1/4 cup Kahlua. The cake turned out so very moist. I served warm with whipped cream for Thanksgiving. Thanks for the great recipe!

This cake was delicious.  I used coffee instead of the liquer and it was great - maybe not as sweet as it would have been.  There is no need for icing, but maybe a little glaze would have been nice for presentation.

This is by far the easiest and best tasting chocolate cake ever!  I'm made it many times now and it always comes out rich, moist and chocolatey!!  I've used amaretto or strong instant coffee instead of the coffee liqueur and it tastes great!  I do recommend checking cake before the hour is up, as I found it came our over cooked in my oven after an hour.  A chocoholics dream!!!!!!

We are all chocoholics in this household and this is WONDERFUL, intense and not overly sweet. I have made this three times since Christmas and everyone has totally flipped over it. Does not taste at all like a box cake was used. Definately serve with homemade thick whipped cream. Thanks, Caitlin AAAAA+++++

Makes a very moist, wonderfully rich cake that even tastes perfect a couple of days later (if it lasts that long!)  I served it with homemade whipped cream and fresh raspberries.  Mmmmmm!  Seconds and thirds were had all around!

I made this cake for my best friend's birthday and it was a hit!  Everyone at the party loved it.  I used Bailey's and drizzled melted white and milk chocolate over top to make a pseudo-icing (I mixed the chocolates with cream, while I melted them).  I will definitely make this again.

The actual cake was great.  I substituted coffee for the coffee liquer and baked in mini bundt pans for 25 minutes (reduced oven temp by 25 degrees).  However, in the future I will not add the chocolate chips.  It was too rich and made it harder to remove the cakes from the pan.

Fortunately I was making 2 cakes, because the first one TOTALLY fell apart...the baking time was way off!  The 2nd cake turned out fabulous, but I reduced the oven temperature a bit and baked the cake for about 35-40 extra minutes.  EVERYONE loved this cake!  Very moist, chocolatey and rich!  Thanx for the recipe!

WOW!  The only thing I changed was to add Baileys instead of Kahlua, and I poured a chocolate ganache over the top.  Beautiful and delicious!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Incredible chocolate cake recipe!!  This is so good! I used peanut butter chips as well as milk chocolate chips in mine and substituted water for the coffee liquour.  I also made a glaze of the peanut butter and milk chocolate chips. It was great!  I told a friend that it was good enough to make for Martha Stewart!!

I gained instant fame with this cake!  To dress it up I melted white morsels, drizzled over top let it cool, then melted down milk chocolate morsels and drizzled over the top.  Gave it a "straight from the bakery" look.

I made this cake for a potluck lunch at work, and it got rave reviews - all but about two slices were gone by the end of the meal!  I substituted bourbon for the coffee liqueur, and used mini chocolate chips instead of the regular sized ones.  I baked it for an hour in a stoneware Bundt pan, and it turned out great - very moist, and the bourbon gave it a good flavor.  And it was so easy to make!  I'll definitely make this one again.

This was excellent! I didn't feel like running out and buying the liquor and I hate the taste of coffee, so I substituted chocolate sundae syrup and a little water. It still turned out great! My boyfriend ate 4 pieces and somewhere around the 2nd piece mumbled "This is the best thing you have ever made" with his mouth full. A keeper!

After reading the reviews, I made this for a family gathering yesterday.  I usually bake from scratch and don't use boxed mixes.  This was excellent!  It did not taste like it started from a box.  It got rave reviews even from my picky mother-in-law!  I will definately make this again.

THIS CAKE WAS EXCELLENT.  I MADE IT LAST NIGHT FOR A FAMILY PARTY AND IT WAS GONE IN 2 SECONDS. I DIDN'T HAVE ANY ISSUES AS FAR AS IT BURNING AS SOME OTHERS DID, AN HOUR WAS PERFECT (ALTHOUGH I DID KEEP CHECKING IT WITH A TOOTHPICK}  I USED PAM COOKING SPRAY IN THE PAN AND A LITTLE BIT OF FLOUR (I DIDN'T HAVE ANY COCOA ON HAND) AND IT PRACTICALLY FELL OUT OF TH PAN WHEN I FLIPPED IT OVER 25 MINUTES LATER.  LOOKED GREAT.  THE ONLY THING I MIGHT DO DIFFERENTLY IS TO USE LESS KALUA OR MAYBE TRY A CHOCOLATE LICOUR INSTEAD.  EITHER WAY IT WAS A HUGE HIT.  I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT AND WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.  LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE ASKING FOR THE RECIPIE AS THEY WERE LEAVING!

Very moist recipe.  I've made this and substituted low-fat  yogurt for the sour cream.  It's as good and lower in fat.

I've also taken a flour sifter and sprinkled the top with confectionary sugar followed by cocoa powder.  This makes it look a bit prettier and the more chocolate the better!

I'm a super-picky chocolate cake eater but I'd give this 10 stars if I could. I'll never make another chocolate cake recipe again. I regret I had no liquor and had to use 1/2 cup strong coffee instead. It was excellent and we paired it with Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream which was delightful. My daughter complained about the lack of frosting UNTIL she tasted the cake. No frosting needed...

YUM!  This cake was delicious!  I made this with the Bailey's mint liqueur and the Andes mint chip pieces (thanks Sue24) and it tasted just like the mint Girl Scout cookies.  I actually added a chocolate glaze with just a touch of the Bailey's too and it was to die for.  It was moist and delish...thanks!  I want to try all the other flavors now!

I have been making this cake for years, but after reading a review I added a bag of Andes mint chips instead of regular chocolate chips and I had people fighting over the last piece of this cake...it was incredible! Its good as is, but with the mint chips I would give it ten stars if I could!

This was so good!  I always make it as the recipe states for the first time and rating.  It was amazing.  I did add raspberry flavoring the second time, and that was amazing too.  Just plain delicious!  Thanks for a great cake...3/31/2012 - Making this AGAIN!  I love it!  But I do only use 1 cup of chocolate chips now,  YUM!

This cake was fantastic. I agree that there was no need for frosting; even my husband who typically eats cake as a vehicle for frosting liked this one without. I decorated it with a sprinkle of icing sugar and raspberries that had juiced in a little sugar. It was moist, rich with flavour without being overpowering. I opted out on the coffee liqueur as I am not a fan but it was still fantastic. Besides the taste being great, the best part about this cake - super easy and fast to make!!

If I could give this more stars I would.  This was by far the best chocolate cake I have ever eaten or baked.  I love that is was so easy!  I made it as a bundt cake first and it was exceptional.  Then I made the recipe as cupcakes.  I filled the cups half way and baked for 20 minutes then topped with a chocolate ganache.  I served them at a benefit chocolate festival and got so many compliments.  They are so moist and delicious.  Of course I credited your recipe.  Thank you so much!!!

This is the best chocolate cake I have made.  I didn't have Kahlua, so I used a shot of espresso combined with enough milk to make 1/2 cup.  It was done for me in 55 minutes. Topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze from this site.  Absolutely wonderful!

I hate to say this, but I did make some changes. We did not have the coffee liquore so I used strong black coffee, used applesauce instead of oil, and I broke up a bar of milk chocolate instead of using chips since we didnt have those either. This came out AMAZING! I'm not a fan of chocolate but I made it for my mother in law. However, none of us can stop eating it!!! SO good!

This cake is absolutely delicious made the way it is written!!! A sure winner, very easy to make and worth every minute of baking time. Thank you so much for this heavenly goodness!!! I sprinkled each slice with powdered sugar as it was served with a little vanilla ice cream on the side.

I substituted canola oil for vegetable oil and strong brewed coffee for the kahlua.  I needed a last-minute cake for a birthday party so I tried this one since it's easy and quick.  I made 2 cakes because we expected more than 12 people.  Everyone loved it!  My oven tends to get hotter than it's supposed to be so I baked it for about 45-50 minutes.  Very moist and chocolaty.  Thanks for the recipe.

I could probably sell this cake illegally in a dark alley somewhere. Outrageously, ridiculously, sinfully good. I baked it for 45 minutes, then checked it and it was done. Better to bake for less time, remember- you can always stick it back in the oven, but if it's overbaked, there's nothing you can do.

I used devils food cake mix and it seemed on the dry side. I wonder if I should of put a glaze on it. I did serve it with whip cream and I put dark chocolate chunks in the mix. Maybe undercooking it some would of helped

This cake rocks!  My husband only likes 2 kinds of cakes and both involve icing.  I made this cake (picture is in the photo section) and dusted powdered sugar on top.  He LOVED it!  The kids came by and THEY loved it too.  Now there is very little left.  I used regular strong coffee instead of alcohol only because I didn't have any of the kind listed or recommended by reviewers.  Using mixes etc....made it so easy!  Thank you!!

This cake turned out very well. I used Kahlua and only 1 c mini choc chips, based on reviewer's comments. I think next time I'll try the full 2 cups, as we didn't find it overly sweet at all. I imagine which liqueur you uses tweaks the sweetness of the cake. However, using the Kahlua, if I were to frost or glaze the cake, I'd use just the 1 c chips. Unfrosted...increase to 2 cups. Mine cooked in about 55 minutes, so be sure and watch your cake and begin testing at 45+ minutes (always a good idea when baking, don't just go by a clock or recipe time). I also used light sour cream and the cake is still very rich and moist.

I was a little disappointed... it was good but I didnt think it was a whole lot better then a regular box cake mix.  It is a super simple cake to make and overall it was good I was just expecting a little more with such great reviews.

Cooked for 1 hour and it was dry. Couldn't taste the coffee liqueur at all. I followed some of the advice of using only 1 cup of chocolate chips, but they were mini ones so they kind of got lost. I used mini because I was thinking they would disperse better in the batter, but the batter is so thick that regualr would stay put and not sink. I only had one cup of sour cream so I used that. Definitely wished I would have had the full two cups then I could give this an honest rating. But the biggest let down was using a half cup of Kaluha and not getting any of the flavor from it. That is the main reason I chose this recipe over other ones.

A family friend used to make this cake when I was a kid and I was so glad to find it.  I made it as a butter-rum version (Yellow cake mix, butterscotch pudding, butterscotch chips and rum as the liqueur).  The flavors were amazing, but this version was too moist/dense for my tastes.  I'll try again with an extra egg and omitting the veg oil.

This is a hard rate for me... It was DELICIOUS, but, I used it to make Cup Cakes and they did not turn out well.... They just kinda melted over the pan and were flat. I was hoping for a fluffy rounded top, which absolutely did not happen. But, that being said, they were moist and delicious. My advice, for sure make this recipe, just make it as a cake only.

I took this to the park for a summer program and the kids and adults loved it. However I didn't have sour cream on hand so substitued 1 cup yogurt plus 1 teaspoon baking soda. Definately a keeper.

This was a super good dessert!! I read through a bunch of other people's reviews and had to change a few things.  I bought a box of D.C. cake mix at Kroger on sale, Walmart had their pudding mix cheaper so I picked some up. Used reduced fat sour cream and used the entire bag of chocolate chips (instead of measuring out the 2 c) Some people said the chips weren't melting good unless you bought them as minis, so I put them in a bowl and softened them up in the microwave before adding it to the mixture.  I didn't have a bunt pan, so I used a cake pan and dumped some cocoa on the bottom as suggested (tho I sprayed the pan first).   I cooked it for exactly an hour at 325 degrees and it was perfect!! After it cooled I served it with fresh strawberries and whipped topping on the side.   Everyone loved it!!!!   Thanks!

Oh, this was the very best chocolate cake I've ever made!!! And, I'm a chocolate person through and through. Everyone (including my son who rarely eats dessert) ate two slices. I used 1/2 cup of very strong coffee in place of the liquor. But I did everthing else exactly by the instructions....including the 2 cups of chocolate chips. It was very moist. I took it out of the oven just under an hour when it looked a little undone. But, it was actually perfect. Served it with sliced strawberries sweetened with splenda. Will make again and again!!!

This cake was sooo moist and yummy!!!  I did want to make a different flavor so I did dark chocolate and mint chocolate chips instead of semisweet and used chocolate mint liquer instead of coffee.    EVERYONE loved it!!  It made my house smell like mint...

YUMMIE!  Absolutely delicious.  I used the mini chocolate chips as recommended and I used Kahlua.  I used the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" on the website and put multicolored sprinkles on top.  It was a beautiful Birthday Cake for my best friend and there wasn't even a crumb left.  Thanks for sharing the reipe, I already have a request to make again

I bake all the time and I'm NOT a beginner.  I thought this cake was absolutely delicious and so very easy.  I added a little additional Kaluha other than that no changes were made.  I drizzled a chocolate sauce over it and sprinkled with powdered sugar.  Delicious!!

Very yummy! Make sure you do it in a 10 inch bundt pan. I did it in a 9 inch and it cooked over and out of the pan in the oven. A very big mess.

This cake simply melts in your mouth!!! Here are the changes that I recommend: Use 1 cup sour cream, 4 eggs, and 1 cup vegetable or canola oil. Use MINI chocolate chips, they will stay "suspended" instead of sinking to the bottom. In a pinch, I used two one ounce packages of chocolate pudding and 2 one ounce packages of vanilla pudding mix---Could not tell a difference! For the users who wondered about CUPCAKES--Absolutely wonderful!!! This recipe made 21 large cupcakes for me, but I think I could have stretched it to make 24. I baked them for 20 minutes at 350 degrees and used paper liners. I made them for valentines day and topped them with chocolate glaze and half of a strawberry--very elegant and simply delicious! Try popping an unfrosted cupcake in the microwave for 15-20 seconds...the result is an ooey-gooey treat!!! Thank you Caitlin!

Yes, it was rich, but it wasn't necessarily memorable. It was just a chocolate cake afterall.  The chocolate bits in it made it a little different than an ordinary heavier chocolate cake.

I made this recently for a holiday party with close friends.  I didn't get to eat a slice but everyone loved it!  I used the Chambourd (raspberry liquer).  Didn't frost but dusted with confectioner sugar and put it on a pretty cut glass plate-it looked quite lovely and festive.  I'll try again with bailey's.  Great recipe for special events.  The liquer adds to the cost but it certainly is great for special dinners and it rivals more expensive specialty bakery cakes for sure!!

OMG! This is the 2nd time I have made this cake, and it is TOO DIE FOR!!! This time I used Carolyns liqured cream and Ande's mint bits in the batter and it is so good. I went the whole 9 yards and did the satiny chocolate glaze (in the microwave) dusted with powered sugar and then filled the cavity with chocolate covered strawberries, decorated with white and brown chocolate and put halved strawberries around the bottom edges of the plate. Note: I used Pam baking spray on my bundt pan very heavy and my cake slid out perfectly.

Very yummy chocolate cake. I used Starbucks coffee liquor. SAD, my cake fell apart coming out of the bundt pan.  GREASE and FLOUR your pan WELL!!! I turned most of it into a chocolate trifle because it had fell apart.  I put the pieces of cake into a bowl added vanilla ice cream and topped with hot fudge!  Mmmmmm delicious!!! Some of the cake was still intact so we kept it and it was still delicious on day 3. I finally had to toss the rest to save me from picking a it :) Can't wait to make it again. THANKS for the great recipe.

This cake is a keeper which I made for my son's birthday last weekend.  I took it up a notch and frosted it with cream cheese fronting.  It is delightful and after I started to make this I realized that this was one of my mom's recipes that she always made when she when to a pot luck for it always impressed the guests

Wow, my family said this was the best cake ever - very moist.  I didn't have the liqueur so I used strong coffee and mini chocolate chips.  Top this cake with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze on this same site and you have a definite crowd pleaser.  This is one I will make alot! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Great cake! Made EXACTLY as written. I did take the advice of others and sprinked cocoa powder over the Baker's Joy I sprayed the bundt pan with to avoid having flour spots on a finished cake. It came out perfect, moist and delicious!

this is now my go-to chocolate cake recipe!  i've made it 3 times in the past 2 weeks and it has turned out wonderfully each time.  the only substitutions i made were instead of the coffee liqueur i used strong coffee, and i used 1 cup of mini choco chips instead of the 2 cups regular chips.  i make this recipe as cupcakes and it takes between 25-30 minutes for it to bake.  trust the 800+ positive reviews and give this cake a try!

If you love chocolate, and don't mind the fat and caloric overload, have at it! It was good, but not fabulous. Extremely chocolaty, rich, oily, and dense. Nothing exceptional, but it was decent. Would I make it again? Maybe, but doubtful.

Followed the recipe exactly & with wonderful results!  This is an extremely rich and moist cake that doesn't require frosting or glaze on top.  A dusting of powdered sugar was perfect. This recipe tastes so much "harder" than it actually is to prepare.

WOW!!!!  Made this for a friend's birthday as individual bundt cakes, served dusted with powdered sugar & topped with glazed strawberries!  It was amazing!!!!  The only thing I changed was to use light sour cream, substituted apple sauce for the oil (an old trick I learned years ago to make cakes not only healthier but moister too!) and used Bailey’s Irish Cream (had on hand) instead of coffee liqueur.  It disappeared!  My guests even asked to take home the extra mini bundts!  Only suggestion, serve while still warm to get the full yummy, gewy, chocolate-y-ness!

This was super yummy and rediculously rich! Definately need to eat it with a tall glass of cold milk. I used Kahlua and cooked it 10 minutes short of the instructions given (my oven runs hot). It came our perfectly! Thanks!

I have made this incredible cake 2 times now and think it is the best chocolate cake I have ever had. The first time I made it as the recipe is, the second time I used raspberry liquor(Chambord). Wow was that ever good...nothing better than chocolate and raspberries. Now I want to try it as a layer cake with a cream cheese frosting. Not sure how long to bake it, will just have to experiment...Also, intsead of chocolate chips, try adding chopped reeses peanut butter cups...YUMMMM

My wife has made this cake twice.  The second time she used white chocolate chips.  I prefer the white chips. Everyone begs my wife for the recipe.  Killer..........

This was an extremely good cake--nice and moist.  I don't care for the texture of the regular size chocolate chips--find the miniature ones as others have advised. The liquor flavor was a little strong for my taste, but everyone else loved it.  I made this in 2 9-inch round pans and split the layers for a 4 layer cake.  I used chocolate mousse for the filling (recipe from Hershey's cocoa) and chocolate ganache as frosting (from Taste of Home Kitchen on this site). Made for an impressive birthday cake for my boss, and everyone at the office loved it.  Update: Made this again using strong coffee instead of liquor and the mini chocolate chips--result was fantastic. I ended up serving the cake plain, sprinkled with powdered sugar, and it was still delicious. It's a 5-star recipe with the mini chips.

Perfect, easy chocolate cake!  Tastes like it came from a bakery.  Frosted it with cream cheese icing from this site and it was sooo good.  Would be great without icing, too.  Very moist!

This cake was really rich and chocolaty. I added warmed fudge frosting to the top. A truly versatile cake. Thank you for a  real keeper!

This is the second time I've made this recipe--and it was great both times.  I used milk instead of 1/2 cup coffee flavored liqueur and used mini-chocolate chips like others suggested.

This cake was moist and delicious even though I didn't use quite as much sour cream as the recipe called for (I used only 8 oz).

I am not a cake lover at all but this was by far the best, most moist, delicious cake I have ever tasted.  I had it with Kahlua (1 cup) and mini chocolate chips (1 cup) and it was to die for.  I am going to try different recommended flavors by others next time.

Very good!!  I didn't even ice it...I did serve it with icecream and plan on drizziling it with Kahlua next time!!!  YUMMO! Update:  I made this cake again and added pecans, used mini chocolate chips, and used the glaze another review mentioned.  I served it with icecream and it was amazing!  The pecans really added a nice touch with all the chocolate and icecream...I'll be making this again real soon!

What a great recipe!  I was looking for something quick & easy. I had all the ingredients, except the chocolate cake mix (had to use yellow cake mix). Turned out fantastic! (Can't wait to try it with the chocolate cake mix.) To make it even easier, I would recommend making it the day before, as the flavor is even better and still so moist. Definitely a keeper!!!

OMG!!! If you love moist, super chocolate cakes then this one is for you! I was a little worried about it when I initially took it out of the oven because it was still very moist but everything turned out perfect. I might even suggest making this the day before serving because I thought it was better the second, third, and fourth days. There were NO leftovers of this cake in our house and we were actually fighting over the last few pieces! We can't wait until the next birthday!

I made this for my husbands birthday. It is very good. I took a couple of the other readers ideas also, I used mini chocolate chips. I also baked it in three eight inch cake pans. Just to give it a more traditional look. will make again.

I have been making this delicious cake for many years and it is a shame that I'm just now writing a review. My son who was turning 5 wanted a mint chocolate cake in the shape of Spongebob.  I experimented and added Andes mint chips instead of chocolate chips but the cake turned out to minty.  Even for my son and I who love mint it was too much mint.  I would suggest to divide the amount of chips.  Half to be Andes mints and half chocolate chips.  Both my kids and my nephew did not like the strong mint taste...too bad because I spent a long time decorating spongebob.  I give this recipe a 5 stars all the way because it has been our family's favorite and friends and neighbors are always requesting I make it.  Everyone loves it!!!

This cake is wonderful.  My sister is pregnant and lactose intolerant, but she was craving a good chocolate cake when I stumbled upon this one.  I made it without the pudding and used a soy based sour cream (lactose free).  I also used a combination of starbucks coffee liquor and Creme de Cocoa liquor.  I used Andes mint chips instead of chocolate chips.  It came out wonderful, rich and moist!!!  This is my best new chocolate cake recipe, and I can't wait to make it with the regular ingredients to compare to the lactose free version!

this is a great cake.  I baked it in a 9x13 pan with no adornment.  It was a humble little thing on the dessert table, until someone tasted it!!

I advise letting it sit for one day, as it is moister and denser.  I subbed cool coffee for the kahlua.  The coffee flavor really adds complexity.  It was a big hit at thanksgiving.  A little kid asked me, "is there a brownie in this cake?"  4 stars, because there may be room for improvement with a drizzle of ganache.

***update - I made it yet again with chopped up ghirardelli chocolate instead of mini chips - but i chopped it the size of mini chips - best ever

Best bundt cake ever!  I don't change a thing.  I've made this cake many times, always to raves.  The Pam for baking/with flour is a godsend for baking.

I'm not usually a fan of bundt cakes, but this one changed my mind.  I was intrigued by the name and made it for an office party where "something chocolatey" was requested.  The only change I made to the recipe was I substituted coffee for the liqueur as I was out of Kaluha!  It was very moist, deliciously chocolatey and will satisfy any chocolate craving.  I also used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze (see my other reviews) with this recipe and it worked out perfectly.  A very simple recipe overall and I can't wait to make it again to keep for myself at home this time!

I cannot imagine anyone who loves chocolate cake not losing their mind over this recipe!  It is to die for...like OH MY GOSH good!!!!  I used the Satiny Chocolate Glaze as did other reviewers and it was killer, totally decadent.  I did not have any chocolate liquer so I just used 1/2 C of coffee from this morning.  Insanely good, probably the best recipe I've tried so far off this website.  Do yourself a favor and make this!!!!!  And whoever submitted this recipe is my new hero. :)

This cake is quite simply...amazing!!!  So easy to make, and so delicious.  The only change that I make to the recipe is to use Bailey's Irish Cream as the "coffee flavoured liquer".  As the cake is baking, I make the raspberry sauce (using frozen raspberries) from the "Old Fashioned Pound Cake With Raspberry Sauce" recipe.  To serve,  I put a slice of cake in the microwave for 20-30 seconds to warm it up, and then top with the raspberry sauce!  All I can say is "WOW"!

OMG this cake is AWESOME!!  My family couldn't stop raving about this cake.  I did make a few minor changes.  I used only 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips, I replaced the liqueur with chocolate milk as suggested by someone else and I heated up half a cup of heavy cream and mixed in 4 oz of semi sweet chocolate chips to make a ganache to drizzle on top.  The one hour baking time was perfect.  The cake was SO moist and gooey.  Will I be making this again.....oh heck yeah!!

Mmm, this cake is yummy. I have a variation in the oven right now I made with kirschwasser (cherry brandy) instead of coffee liqueur. Since kirschwasser is so strong, I probably will go ahead and make a chocolate glaze, but usually for this cake I don't.

OMG!  I have died and gone to chocolate heaven!  This is just like the one served at my favorite restaraunt.  The only thing I changed was to use mini choc chips, I think they melted better and gave a better final result.  Thanks for the great recipe!

SUPER EASY TO MAKE! I followed the directions, but took others advice and covered the cake in foil for the last ten minutes.  I was concerned about the hour cook time, but it came out perfect!  I had no trouble removing it from the pan.  I also used cocoale chunks instead of chips. I sifted powdered sugar and added sliced strawberries on top. (see my posted photo). NO NEED FOR ICING OR GLAZE.  It was very moist and super sweet.  I do not like chocolate cake, but everyone who ate it, including my kids (3 yr and 5yr) LOVED it. I would make this cake again and try the andes mint chips or a white chocolate version. Thank you for this EASY recipe.

This cake gets 5 stars all the way.  It is the best cake.  I used to buy a chocolate Bundt cake at Sam's Club that was my favorite but this one passed it.  My sister made it first.  She used caramel instead of the coffee liquer.  When I made it I used about 1/3 cup chocolate syrup (like Hershey's) and then added a little water to compensate.  It was delicious.  We both sprinkled powdered sugar on top to dress it up a little.  It can also be made in an angel food cake pan if you don't have a Bundt pan.  It's not as pretty but it still tastes just as good. :)

There are all sorts of versions of this cake floating around on this site. This one (in my humble opinion) is spot on. Delicious, rich as hell (try topping with a bit of vanilla ice cream or whipped cream), and easy. Everyone loves this cake and so will you--unless you're one of those odd people who doesn't like things that are "too sweet!"

I made this for my mom’s b-day and she really enjoyed it. It’s very moist and delicious!  I did not use the liqueur because we are not coffee fans and it was still wonderful.  I used mini chocolate chips and drizzled the cake with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze (also found on allrecipes).  I then topped it off with toasted, sliced almonds and lightly dusted with powdered sugar.  I will definitely make this again; however, I want to try it with Andes mint chips as someone else suggested.

The possibilities are limitless with this cake.  I am making it for the 3rd time, tonight, and this makes the first time I followed the recipe to the letter.  My first attempt had me caught without chocolate pudding, so I used the only thing on hand: pistachio!  I held my breath, but the pistachio gave a nice, nutty, refreshing taste to the cake - and no, it did NOT turn green!  My second attempt, I used a chocolate ganache recipe to drizzle and topped with maraschino cherries; The reaction from people on this cake is astounding!  A real crowd pleaser, no matter what the crowd.  I'll try it with a white chocolate glaze for my assistant's birthday, tomorrow - bravo!

I made this cake for my Bible study group without trying it out first, which I usually don't do in case it doesn't turn out, but this recipe didn't let me down! Everyone loved it! I also substituted choc. syrup for the liqueur and it was fabulous. I usually am not a big cake fan because cakes tend to be dry, but this was moist and gooey - like a good brownie in a cake pan!

This recipe is pretty good.  It is very rich!  I have made this twice but both times I had to omit the liqueur because I didn't have it.  The batter is VERY thick.  I iced the cake with the icing from Deb's Millionaire Cake reipce on this site.  It was very good but again VERY rich.  Everyone seems to love it when I make this cake.

Very good, moist and very dense.  For the holidays, I made one with french vanilla cake, white chips, amaretto and put a few dollops of cherry pie filling on the top with sliced almonds.  It was a HUGE hit!

I made exactly as the recipe said.  Very moist and delicious.  My family didn't want any icing on it - I agree.  It would have put it over the top.  Thanks for the recipe.

Just like everyone says, it's delicious! Instead of the liqueur, I added 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup coffee. And I used 1 cup chocolate chips and lite sour cream. I baked it for 20 minutes in muffin pans shaped like bundt cakes. Wonderful!

OK-originally I rated this 3 stars after trying the cake the same day I made it.  The Kahlua aftertaste was way too overpowering against the chocolate.  Knowing the good chocolate flavor comes out after a day or two-I waited and tried it again and it was much better.  Very Very moist but next time I will add only 1/3 cup Kahlua because it still comes out in the taste.  I would def consider making this in advance and letting it sit for a day or two to let the chocolate flavor age.

I have been making a similar recipe for a few years and it has always been a hit, but the recipe I had didn't call for the Kahlua. When I saw this recipe I had to try it and I am sure glad I did.  It was so good that I froze half the cake to keep from eating too much of it.  By the way, it freezes and defrosts very well.

This cake is out of this world.  It is so moist and yummy.  I didn't have a whole container of sour cream so I used what I had left (about half of a container) and half of a container of ricotta cheese. (both fat free)  I will definitely make it the same way again.  Like other reviewers, I used the satiny glaze and topped it with walnuts.  Yum!

This was one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever had.  So very moist!  My favorite part of the cake are the little melted pockets of chocolate throughout the cake from the chocolate chips.  I used milk chocolate chips because that's my husbands' preference.  Next time I might throw in a few more chips :)  I put a little powdered sugar on top of the cake for a little bit of extra sweetness and it looked pretty.  But next time I will also try it with some kind of choc frosting or ganache.  I think that would make it perfect!  Thanks for the easy, delicious recipe, this is definitely a keeper!

Oh my goodness - this is the chocolate cake to end all chocolate cakes.  :-)  Pure decadence.  Like others, I substituted milk for the coffee liqueur.  Also cut the amount of choc chips in half, and committed the sin of frosting this cake...  Worth every calorie.

my husband asked for a chocolate cake with raspberry filling for his birthday.  this is the cake i used and here is the twist i put on it...

i, too, used raspberry liqueur in place of coffee liqueur.  i did two 9" rounds (next time i may even do 3), layed with raspberry jam for the filling. and i did frost it with store-bought frosting that i added raspberry jam to, to taste, then added some powdered sugar to bring it back to the right "frosting" consistancy.  then i topped the cake with tons of raspberries it was DELICIOUS!!!  next time i will use regular size chips, as the mini ones did not melt and left chunks throughout the cake.

Wow!!  I am a cake decorater and this is my go-to chocolate cake.  I of course use buttercream on top instead of the drizzle, but it is still amazing.  I have had to share the recipe each time I serve it, lots of requests.  I substitute chocolate liquor for the coffee since coffee isnt loved by all.

This is the cake I take to work when my co-workers and I need a stress reliever.  I have even used dark chocolate chips and dark chocolate pudding with the dark chocolate cake mix.  I didn't have the coffee liqueur so I used milk and it was just as good.  A definite cake to make over and over again.

This cake is so yummy and very chocolaty. My hubsband asked me to make another one so he can bring to the party at work. I’m not a chocolate cake fan, but I will make this again again and again. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Initially I made this cake for myself because it got outstanding reviews, but I only gave it two stars because I didn't think it was all that.  I made it again for a party I was hosting this evening and it was unbelievable!  I must have done something wrong the first time because it was a hit.  Thank you for the recipe and I'm glad I tried the recipe for a second time.  I'll definitely make this again.

wowee was this good!  in fact, it was so good, i made it again the day after making the first one!  (no, i did not eat the first one all by myself...)  i followed it almost exactly, with the exception of using a half cup of espresso instead of liquer (less expensive, same result).  i also drizzled melted semi-sweet chocolate chips over the top and sprinkled heath toffee baking bits over that.  mmmmmmmmmm!

If I could give this cake more stars I would.  If you love chocolate, you will LOVE this recipe...and it is so easy to make. I added chocolate milk instead of the liqueur and 12oz. of choc. chips and it still turned out great.  I've made it twice in one weekend, my husband loves it!  Thanks so much for sharing this great cake recipe.

This is one of the easiest cakes to make and the results are fantastic.  I did not have the pudding to put into the cake, but it didn't matter.  Also subsituted chocolate milk for the liqueur.  Mixed half semi-sweet and dark chocolate pieces, and this cake was to die for!!!!  Ice-cream or whipped topping.....YUM!!!!!   It is truely a one bowl, one spoon, one pan wonder!!!  Can't go wrong with this cake!!!!!  Quick and EASY, was a great last minute dessert that everyone loved!

Very good but cake went south. Maybe my fault. I added 2 cups milk to the chocolate pudding mix,like the directions said to on the box. Maybe I shouldn't have added the milk? Can someone please respond.

Outstandingly moist and soooo good.  I couldn't taste the Kahlua very much so I may use a more inexpensive liquor next time.

This was one of those few recipes that came out exactly as it was supposed to with little tweaking.  I didn't have coffee flavored liquor, so I used Frangelico and some chocolate extract.  Everything else was strictly according to the directions.  The first day the cake was good, but the second and third day it was amazing.  I kept it well covered between slices and it just got moister and the flavors really came out.  This cake was so moist that you never really even need a glass of milk to follow.  It was so simple to make, though my husband had to help stir the batter.  He kept asking if it was brownie batter.  In the end it was worth the work, though next time I will be using my KitchenAid mixer.

I served this with a chocolate sauce,
whip cream and sliced strawberries.
It looked great and helped to not taste
the boxed cake taste. The cake is very
rich but we love chocolate!

I have made this so many times, one way to change it is to use a cream cheese glaze or frosting, with white chocolate chips!! so good!! 

Note: I used a cake mix with chips already in it, so I only added 1 cup of semi-sweet chips. I also used Irish cream liquor.
I have to say this is one of the best cakes I have ever tasted VERY RICH, but oh so good, I could only handle 4 fork fulls.... I made a layerd "Death by chocolate cake" for my husbands birthday party using these two recipes...  "Flourless Chocolate Cake I"  & "Chocolate Cavity Maker Cake", frosted with a thin layer of dark chocolate fudge, and crushed walnuts. I used 10" pans, and froze the baked cakes over night, I then sliced all the cakes in half, so I had 6 layers, then I placed a thin layer of frosting between each one... I sprinkled the nuts all over the top, and I swear I had 3 guests bow down to my feet... seriously. Now everyone wants me to be the "cake maker"

I have made this cake about a dozen times.  It is always a HUGE hit.  I've made it for weddings too.  

I've never used the coffee flavored liqueur, I just leave it out.  Cake turns out fine.

My goodness...can we just say chocolate KICK IN THE BUTT!!! Whew!!  I tried it for the first time at a dinner party Sunday and everyone raved at how much it tasted like those brownie sundaes at Chilie's, or Benningans, etc. (We had the cake with some ice cream:o) I didn't have any coffee liquor so i added a 1/2 cup of Hershey's syrup. Everyones message here is solid truth...cake is moist, chocolately and MOST defenitley heavenly!!
I give it 5+ stars :o)

Yummy and easy to make!  My husband is really picky about cake--doesn't like it much, but I took a chance and made this one for his birthday after reading the reviews.  I served it with vanilla ice cream and he absolutely loved it!

Delicious and very rich!  Instead of coffee liqueur, I used raspberry.  Topped each slice with fresh whipped cream and drizzled raspberry sauce over it.  Everyone went crazy!  This is now my Mom's and son's favorite dessert. Thanks so much Caitlin.

I made this cake for a work christmas lunch and it was great.  So moist and full of chocolate.  I used Godiva for the liqueur and coated the pan with Ghirardelli cocoa instead of flour as some others had suggested.  And, I turned the temp down to 275 for the last fifteen minutes of baking.  I also made chocolate ribbons to add to the top and sprinkled the cocoa over the ribbons and cake for presentation.  The cake turned out beautifully and several people asked for the recipe.  I am making this again for another party Saturday.  Thanks!

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever had!  I made it for the first time for a friend's birthday last night, a risky move, but it came out of the pan beautifully and everyone commented on how moist and great-tasting it was.  I used cake mix to flour the pan instead of white flour and used 1/2 cup brewed coffee instead of the liquer.  Also, topped it with a chocolate ganache from this site.  EASY & IMPRESSIVE!

I've made this twice.  Once I forgot to add the oil and it was JUST AS GREAT AS with it!  I could see how adding the oil makes the cake retain its moisture, but even after baking the day before my guests ate this thing in a day....maybe they just felt it was ok cause I'd left out the oil and used lite sour cream.  I drizzled with chocolate ganache glaze. This is a keeper!

I agree with the other reviews.  This is definitely a recipe worth trying and keeping.  The warning about overbaking is especially worth noting.  The cake will appear slightly gooey after 40-45 minutes, but may well be done. As it sits in the pan cooling, it tends to continue to bake - - resulting in the "crispiness" other reviewers have experienced. I can't wait to experiment with other flavors of liquers.

By far the best chocolate cake I've ever had.  I made it for my son's birthday and used the Chocolate Cream Frosting recipe from this site to frost it.  Everyone loved it.  The cake is so moist and this frosting isn't too sweet.  I didn't use liquour, but used some caffe' liquour or something I had on hand from Italy.  I didn't turn out the cake after ten minutes though.  I waited until about 24 hours and the cake actually fell apart and broke in half, which is why I ended up frosting it.  So, I guess I would definitely recommend turning out the cake as instructed.

This cake is fabulous!  I used devils food cake, fat free sour cream, and substituted applesauce for the olive oil and it was still amazing!  I drizzled a chocolate glaze over the cake for a little kick, wonderful!

Very tasty and full of flavour.  Hubby said it was too rich for him, but that didn't stop him from eating more! So rich that I think smaller slices are better. Didn't need icing.

I made this cake twice in 3 days, it was SO GOOD! The only things I changed were as follows: I didn't have coffee flavored liqueur, so I used Baily's. And, I dusted the whole cake with powdered sugar just for looks. Other than that, I did it as I was supposed to, and as I said, I had to make it twice in one week -- it was loved by all! A definite keeper. Thanks!!

Holy Cow!  This is the best chocolate cake recipe in the universe!  {Believe me, trying new chocolate stuff is my hobby!}  I've gotta go with the folks who used Godiva Chocolate Liqueur, and topped it off with chocolate ganache.  After all, you really can't ever have too much chocolate!  :)

I have recommended this recipe to all of my fellow chocaholics.  Definitely a keeper!

A fantastic recipe!  I was worried when I made it because when I turned the cake over it seemed to be a bit dry, but OH no!! This was an amazing and moist bundt cake.  Everyone at my dinner party raved about it and wanted the recipe.  It takes wonderful days later from the fridge as well. I particularly am not a fan of the big chocolate chips in it, maybe I will melt chocolate and put it in next time or use smaller chocolate chips.  It might make for a classier looking cake. But try this recipe!  You will love it.

Awesome chocolate cake! I sprinkled powder sugar on top and it was fabulous - definitely don't need icing with this rich, moist cake. Be careful not to over bake (like I did). One hour would have been plenty of time but I added ten minutes on because it didn't look firm enough. Even with some overcooked edges, we loved it!

This is truly yummy and so easy.  My husband is such the chocoholic, that I added yet another layer of chocolate to this cake.  I melted a container of chocolate frosting in the microwave, poked holes in the cake while it was warm, and drizzled the warm melted frosting over the cake.

This is a wonderful recipe!  No one can tell it's a modified box - they just think your a genius.  I use 1/2 as many chocolate chips and always use mini chips so they mix in better.  You can't go wrong with this one!

Excellent and very rich!  The time seems a little too long because mine burned all over...but it still tasted good.  I made a glaze for the top.
Melt two full semisweet squares(2 oz.) with 1 and 1/2 Tbls. butter.  Stir in 3/4 c. sifted powdered sugar and 1 and 1/2 Tbls. hot water.  Add more water if necessary to make drizzling consistency. Spoon on top and let drizzle down sides.

Absolutely the best chocolate cake recipe. My family went wild over this one. I used Kahlua as the coffee liquor and it had a wonderful taste.
We cut the cake after about 30 minutes and it was still warm and gooey on the inside. Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

The taste of this cake was fantastic HOWEVER even though I followed the recipe to the letter, it was pretty burnt when I pulled it out of the oven.  I think next time I will either lower the temperature a bit or cut the baking time a little bit...not sure how else to eliminate the burnt bundt

FYI-Kahlua is one brand of coffee flavored liqueur. So is Tia Maria (Jamaican I believe).
Godiva has a chocolate flavored liqueur that might be nice to try instead of the coffee.

I made this cake for a family party.  Luckily I made it the night before, since the cake did not come out of the pan.  After reviewing the other comments I even left it in the pan for 25 minutes as recommended.  The cake itself was very tasty, but I still need to make another cake.  I won't try this again.

This cake was quick and easy to make.  I sprayed the bundt pan with Pam, didn't use any flour and had no problems with the cake sticking. I did let the cake cool for 25 minutes as previously suggested before removing it from the pan.  I used Kahlua as the chocolate liquor and think next time I will try something else.  The cake baked beautifully, was dense and delicious.  I melted some white chocolate and drizzled it on top of the cake once it was cool.  The contrast between the white chocolate and the dark cake was beautiful.  I will definately make this cake again.

The kids loved it, the adults loved it.  A win, win, win because it is so easy to prepare.  I took others advice and let it cool in the pan for 25 minutes, then turned it on to a cooling rack.  **Note** This cake rose beautifully, I baked it for 1 hour, I tested it with a toothpick even though it does not mention this and my toothpick was clean when it came out, while cooling the cake fell back some; at first I was worried, but now I think thats because of its texture inside.  Definitely a keeper!

Fabulous chocolate flavor! I used Vanilla pudding(had it on hand) and it was still an EXTREME chocolate flavor! This is like a cross between fudge, brownie, and cake. Family and friends all loved it! Cool completely in pan before turning onto plate (because it is so moist!)  LOVED IT!

moist chocolate heaven, thick batter and I did not have any chocolate liquor so improvised and used fresh black coffee.Came out of the oven exactly one hour.I decided to make a ganache and added some Irish cream liquor to the ganache. Great chocolate cake.

I made this for my mother's birthday.  She can't have gluten so used a gluten free chocolate cake mix and followed the recipe exactly except had to add maybe a half to 3/4 cup of water to thin out the batter.   I had to bake for an additional 10 minutes.  Let cool in the pan for 30 minutes and it came out perfectly.  After cooling I drizzled with a chocolate ganache and left over chocolate pieces. I let is sit in the fridge over night which I think helps develop the flavor of baked goods.    To serve I filled the hole in the bundt cake with slightly sweetened whipped cream.  Everyone went crazy for it.  I did get asked if there was alcohol in it..so I might reduce that amount next time or swap for something else but everyone wanted more.   Will make again…and no one could tell it was gluten free as a bonus!

My new favorite cake! LOVED it. Didn't have coffee liquor, had 1/4 cup of chocolate liquor and 1/4 cup of strong coffee. Didn't have pudding mix, used chocolate pudding and half the sour cream, amazing!

FANTASTIC Chocolate Cake recipe!!!  I made it for my Boyfriend in celebration of Valentine's Day.  If anyone can mess up a recipe, it's me…..but it came out BEAUTIFULLY.  Boyfriend says it's the BEST chocolate cake he's ever had.  I could not believe how DELIGHTFUL and moist this cake is.  I will make it for my Dad's 88th Birthday in early March.

This cake made me famous.  I first made it about 6 years ago when I first moved to Colorado.  I brought it for a Teacher Appreciation event at my daughters school and since then, word spread!  ALL of her teachers and school staff ask me to bring this cake at LEAST once a year.  I have made it in a MILLION variations too!  I used Baileys Creme de Menthe and mint chips.  I used Amaretto, vanilla cake mix and pudding, white chocolate chips and slivered almonds.  Devils Food cake, Raspberry liquor,and chocolate covered cranberries.  So many choices!  Awesome awesome awesome!

It's very yummy and moist, I just subbed the kahlua with milk for my toddlers. Frosted with a cream cheese frosting. It's much denser after resting overnight. Highly recommended. Maybe I will try it next time as a 2 layer cake with hazelnut buttercream and boysenberry jam to put it over the top. :)

Four stars for taste, but the baking time was waaaaay off. My oven is accurate (I've checked), so I was frustrated that this cake took nearly 2 hours to bake. I kept checking it after an hour, at which point I covered it with aluminum foil. I think the cake is supposed to be gooey, but it was downright uncooked until about 95-100 minutes. I'd make it again b/c my brother thought it was the best. chocolate. cake. ever. I'll just allow more time for baking.

The frosting is in the inside! This is absolutely the best and easiest chocolate cake ever! I am not sure that it will last till tomorrow. I did not change a thing with the recipe and it turned out perfectly. I will be making this again and again and again........

This one is ALWAYS a hit with anyone who has some.  Recently did it with cupcakes, cooking them for ~ 20 min at 350, and it was a great way to break it up.  You can always toss any extras in the freezer to microwave when you need one later.  Served warm with vanilla ice cream?  Oh yeah.....

This, warm, was just like a molten lava chocolate cake. Moist, gooey, super chocolatey and delicious. And very easy!

Just made this cake for my mom's birthday and received rave reviews! Only thing I did different was replace Grand Marnier for the coffee liqueur.

This cake is so rich and moist, we didn't think it needed any frosting or glaze on top.  My only substitution was a 1/2 c. of Godiva chocolate liqueur instead of Kahlua... definitely making this one again!!

I was torn between 4 and 5 stars. There is a lot of liqueur in this recipe, so much so that it is very apparent.  When I use a liqueur I usually want some taste of it, but not as strong as out of the bottle.  I have a recipe that uses a few Tablespoons, I will return to that recipe.  Also I did add a 1/4 cup of water to this recipe, the wording said it would be thick, but WOW, I was too afraid it was overly thick, so I thinned it a bit (my other recipe uses 1 cup of boiling water)-so I knew it wouldn't hurt anything.  It was moist, rich, and cut well the next morning.  Held up well at the bake sale.

Just made this and it IS delish, but I've had moister cakes... I don't think a glaze would hurt.  But it was super easy and quick.   Next time I'll try the mint version people have suggested here.
BTW, baked it in a 9 X 13 (who ate my bundt pan?)and it took 40 minutes exactly.

Really great cake. I forgot to add the liquor, and it was still amazing. I wonder if it would have been a little overly dense with the added liquid.

Rich and moist...a chocolate lovers dream. Used low fat sour cream and half the chocolate chips - and it was still a party favorite. So easy it will definitely be on the top of my dessert list!

I used Duncan Hines triple chocolate cake mix,jello temptations chocolate mousse pudding, replaced 1cup of chips with sweetheart m&m's (they're cherry flavored), and cherry wine for the liquor. all except the m&m's and wine were low fat/sugar. fat free sour cream & replaced the eggs with 3tbs milled flaxseed & 9tbs water. 
it was super fluffy when i put in bundt pan &it's baking now. premature 5stars because it looks&smells great. will update later with pix, then again with the reviews at tomorow nights bday party

This is the best chocolate cake ever and it is so easy to make. I stored it in the fridge and heated a leftover slice for 5 seconds on high. The chocolate chips act like the icing - you really don't need to ice this. I didn't have enough kahlua so I used strong instant coffee.

Made this for first time this Thanksgiving, a huge hit and will definitely be making this again.  Used the mini chocolate chips as suggested and every few bites would get a little chip or two....so very very good.

I was really excited about trying this recipe. I love chocolate cakes and everybody seems to love this one. I must say, I'm a little disappointed. The cake is really moist and came out great. Additionally it was super easy to prepare. However the taste is that of a cake mix. I was a little skeptical before baking this cake. I couldn't believe that the additional ingredients could "cover up" the typical taste of cake mixes. And, unfortunately, that was exactly the problem. I used a Betty Croker mix. Maybe a different mix will yield better results. Overall this a quick, easy recipe and a good cake. But not a 5 stars for me.

This one is a dangerous one! I made 2 - 1 for my family and then had to make another one for my parents! This is too good to make often - I end up eating more than my fair share.  I made some chocolate syrup to drizzle over the top, but overall, the recipe is great as stated! Thank you so much for sharing!

I used this recipe for my boyfriend's birthday cake. I used chocolate cream cheese frosting for filling. It was very easy to cut the shape out of it. It was little bit dry, so I was bit worried, but when we cut it next day... Oh my god!!! It was amazing. Combination of this cake and chocolate cheese frosting is just unreal. This cake was the thing that everybody talked about for the rest of the night (instead of my boyfriend's birthday haha :))

Great cake, loved by all!  I took other reviewers' advice and used mini chocolate chips.  I couldn't really taste the liqueur so I might add a little more next time.  I added a chocolate ganache (found on the site), and it was delicious.

Make sure your oven rack is one lower than the middle especially if you have an electric oven. I had my oven rack in the middle and the top was slightly burned. I just cut that portion off and the cake was WONDERFUL! If you're not into chocolate do not make this cake, it's very rich! Rich and yummy!!

This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe.  I make it for everyone who loves chocolate and I have given out the recipe numerous times.  (I have even made a vanilla version as I don't care for chocolate. I used vanilla pudding and white godiva.)  It was wonderful.  I also trippled the recipe and used it in a very large round flat pan that my husband made for me to use as the bottom of a sombrero cake (I have the best hubby!!).  And I used the vanilla version for the top of the hat and it was a big hit!!

This is my "go-to" recipe for chocolate cake! I make it exactly as the recipe calls. But I do top it with chocolate ganache icing (2/3 cup of whipping cream and 1 cup chocolate chips, melted). For the ultimate in moistness, bake the cake A DAY BEFORE you're going to eat it. It's much better that way!

I didn't love it.  Didn't like the texture.  But it was a big hit at Grandma's party.  Also used a chocolate ganache and strawberries.

Love this cake! Easy and delicious! I use a raspberry liquor and fill the center with fresh raspberries. Then I cover it all with a dusting of powdered sugar. Everyone loves it!

I gave this four stars because it must be me, there are way too many people who have had success with this. I made this for my Bunco group in small miniature Bundt pans. All I can think is that I needed to bake much less time than I did.  I baked them about 50 minutes, and they looked divine but they tasted very dry. Not too many of the gals even ate 1/2 of their cake. So disappointing and I want to try it again in a full-size pan to see if that makes the difference.  Darn it, looked so good too!

This cake is AMAZING! I am not even a chocolate lover and I loved it! I brought it in to work today and it was all gone before the end of the day, and everyone asked me for the recipe! Thanks to all the previous reviewers whose suggestions I used - *Used only 1 cupe of Ghiradelli chocolate chips, *Left the eggs at room temperature, *floured the pan with cocoa, *used Baileys instead of coffee liqueur. Remember, the batter is going to be thick so don't panic, you aren't forgetting anything. Takes exactly an hour to bake. I used Betty Crocker's Devil's food cake mix and Jell-O choclate pudding mix. Baking it again tomorrow for a dinner party!

I made as directed, with the exception of melting the chocolate chips.  I think next time I'll make without the pudding.  There was a weird rubbery-ness that I think might be because of the pudding.  Also, I didn't get any of the liqueur flavor.  I might add more next time or do a glaze.  Worth making again!

This cake has ruined me for all other chocolate cakes! None can beat it! I use fat free pudding mix, no veg.oil, fat free sour cream and reduced sugar chocolate syrup rather than liqueur and it is still unanimous among my roommates and I - that between this cake and 'other things' - this cake is a better way to spend a Friday night!

This is the absolute best cake I have ever made or tasted.  I made it for my husband to take to poker night about a month ago and the guys are still talking about it.  It's so easy and stays so moist.  We just love it!

Delicious! This cake stays super moist for days (though you'll probably like it so much that it will disappear long before it has a chance to get dry). I like it with Irish Cream instead of the coffee liqueur and top slices with a tart mixed berry compote and fresh whipped cream.

This cake was nice, I brought it to a fundraiser and everyone who tried it loved it...the only downside was that it looks like a bland chocolate bundt cake so it wasn't always the first on selected...if only people knew what they are missing...I drizzled it with white chocolate, but I think next time I would jazz up the appearance even more...

For some reason, this didn't have a lot of flavor. My boyfriend liked it, but I don't think I'd make it again. It was, however, very easy to make and looked pretty.

So easy, so good.  I even used light sour cream and skipped the coffee liquor and is still delicious.  Instead of chocolate chips I put in dark chocolate 81 percent instead. I recommend this for any body who loves chocolate.  Not to mention that you don't need to put icing on makes it a little bit healthier for you :)

Make this cake when you need a chocolate fix- I made it for my family's Christmas party and everyone loved it.  It is pretty simple to throw together so it makes a great potluck dessert- easy to transport too since you don't have to worry about icing.

I made a vanilla version.  I used vanilla pudding and cake mix and I used the vanilla candy melts in place of chocolate chips.  I omited the coffee and instead used 2 tsp of vanilla.  It is getting rave reviews as we speak.  My husband says it taste like an old fashioned donut cake. I decorated with chocolate covered strawberries and cream cheese frosting.  I can't wait to try it again with chocolate!  It is a great starter recipe to customize!

This is the first time I've succeeded in using one of those new silicone bundt pans. Each time I did it before, the bottom (exposed) side of the cake would burn and the rest wouldn't bake properly. Covering it with aluminum foil while baking (about 45 minutes) did the trick. Thanks for the tip on knowing when the cake is done. Fabulous recipe!

BOX CAKE!  You've got to be kidding me?!!!  This is what I thought.  I tried it anyway.  I was glad I did!  It was rich and chocolatey.  I'd like to try the suggestions of others with the different flavor additions.  Whipped cream on top finishes it off nicely.

LOVE this cake. It turns out perfectly every time & I always receive rave reviews! To cut the sugar/fat I use low sugar cake mix, fat/sugar free pudding mix, fat free sour cream, and substitute apple sauce for oil. You can switch out the pudding, cake, and liqueur easily for a variety of flavors. The satiny glaze from this site tops the cake off perfectly.

I made this as wonderful cupcakes and they are just gorgeous... in terms of presentation and taste! I piped out some slightly-cooled melted white chocolate onto these littles cupcakes and got these outstandingly presentable cupakes in the end. I only needed to bake for 25 minutes and got some 15 cupcakes. Received raves from friends and colleagues:))

I thought this recipe was just ok, but I am not a chocolate cake fan.  I am giving it a 5 star rating because everyone else loved it.  I had difficulty getting it out of the pan, so it left a lot to be desired in the looks department, but that was likely my own fault.  I would recommend this recipe for chocolate cake lovers.

I found out that coffee flavored liqueur is Kahlua, and is purchased in a Liqueur store. This cake has a rich, moist chocolate flavor. It was perfect for my daughter's birthday!

This was so good! Had a hard time finding dark chocolate cake mix the second time I made it, so used chocolate. Definately better with the dark chocolate mix. Very easy and everyone has loved it that tried it!

For a doctored cake mix, this is a 5 star recipe. Moist, rich, and absolutely delicious with a dollop of whipped cream. Because I bought the ingredients on Sunday and live in a very conservative area, I couldn't purchase the liquor. I used coffee instead, which worked out well. I look forward to making this again with the coffee flavored liqueur or possibly Kahlua. [Note: I just made this for the second time, this time with the coffee flavored liqueur. Also fabulous, but my husband and I actually preferred the more subtle taste of coffee to the more overpowering flavor of the liqueur.]

Used raspberry liquor instead of coffee flavored liquor.  Also, used half the amount of sour cream (used only 8oz instead of 16oz... much healthier!!)  Very good, didnt use a bundt pan so it wasnt as dense and moist as it would have been.

I love this cake!  It is my go-to option that is always sure to impress :)  I also make other variations of it with other cake mixes and liqueurs.  Soooo moist and always tasty!  I highly recommend it.  It is a definite crowd pleaser.

WOAH NELLIE!!!! Talk about a moist and delicious chocolate cake! WOW!!! Now that's some kind of wonderful cake!!  First chocolat cake I have made and it came out perfect.  I made it just like the recipe said with one exception.... I used 3/4 cup of kahlua instead of 1/2 cup just to finish off the bottle.  I filled the cavity with strawberries and dusted the whole thing with powdered sugar. I'm making another cake for Thanksgiving dinner to take to a friends house. It deserves MORE than five stars.... I'll make this again....

Moist, rich, delicious - you will get rave reviews for this cake!  I also make this using mini choloate chips poured into muffin tins, and bake for 25-30 minutes,  Drizzling with a bit of white chocolate is the perfect finishing touch.

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever made. I made it for a 40th birthday party for our neighbor and the guests went for my cake before the sheet cake that was ordered. The cake was devoured in minutes. Everyone RAVED about it. Powdered sugar on top makes it look picture-perfect. I've used Kahlua coffee liqueur, Godiva chocolate liqueur, and Frangelico Hazelnut liqueur and all have made the cake delicious. I would give this cake 100+ stars if I could!

This cake is awesome and addictive. I've made it a few times already. The only thing I do differently is replace the liqueur with espresso and use about 1 to 1.5 cups mini chocolate chips.

AMAZING!!! I learned about this recipe from a friend and it is now my "go-to" recipe when we have friends over.  Its wonderful!!!  I think my friend divulged where she got the recipe because she was tired of requests to make it.  Its wonderful with coffee, alone, with milk...you can't go wrong.  Also, it makes a really beautiful (edible) centerpiece during coffee when dusted with confectioner's sugar and filled with strawberries as the picture shows.  NO FAIL SUCCESS WITH THIS ONE!!!

1st, this recipe is AMAZING! I've used this recipe twice now. I made a bundt cake with it for Father's day and it was out of this world (home made fresh cherry topping drizzled over). I've never tasted a cake so moist! It kills me to have to use a boxed cake mix with it, but honestly it's the best chocolate cake I've ever had. I substituted a little milk & Hershey's chocolate syrup for the coffee.   For this photo I submitted, I did a rectangular cake (white cavity cake on the bottom, dark chocolate on top),a layer of whipped cream frosting with fresh Raspberries, and a layer of homemade raspberry compote. I finished it off with a dark chocolate ganache, chopped hazlenuts, dark chocolate shavings, and a dusting of powdered sugar. I think the birthday girl will enjoy it!

I followed this recipie exactly and used creme de coacoa liquer.  The cake I made was a practice run to make sure it would be good enough to take to a family dinner.  It most definately passed the test!  Yes, it is very rich and chocolately, but that was the effect I was going for.  I am definately making this cake again.

So moist and delicious!  Used Starbuck's coffee liqueur and added a semi-sweet chocolate ganache on top.  A big hit with everyone.

Holy cow, that's a good cake!  Kept pretty well to the recipe except used Ghirardelli 60% cocoa chips and Godiva instead of Kahlua.  Yum.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this cake, using Caramel Baileys and  added some fresh raspberries to the batter.  Before serving warm, I drizzled it with black raspberry liquor.  My husband said it is the best cake he has ever had!  Will definately make this one again, and again.

Used Kahlua and mini choc chips. Neighbors all loved it and one of them took the rest home. Her college-aged daughter shared it with her friends at school. This one is a keeper and I will be making it again. Used a bundt pan and made sure to grease and flour so it didn't stick. Might try using cocoa powder so you don't see the flour. Put powdered sugar on top as seen in the pic. Might try making the satuny glaze from this site as it was a it on another chocolate cake. Will make this again.

This is one of my favorite cakes to make, it's quick/easy and tastes amazing.  When we have work luncheons, I am always asked if I'll be bringing. No one ever gets sick of it and people end up sneaking an extra piece to bring home.  Love Love Love this recipe.

This cake is fantastic and seems fool-proof. I substituted hazelnut-flavored coffee creamer for the liqueur, but it still turned out rich, moist, and delicious. It dusted it with powdered sugar and put sliced strawberries on top. It got RAVE reviews from adults and kids alike. I definitely will make this again and will try it with kahlua next time. Loved it!

Hi there Caitlin! This is THE BEST chocolate cake I have ever made - period.  I did not have the coffee liqueur so I used Godiva chocolate liqueur.  I am definitely going to buy the coffee one ASAP to have on hand as I absolutely love anything w/coffee in it.  This recipe is such a keeper that I will also have to put it into a special folder on my computer so that I will always have it somewhere!  I adore this cake.  Thank you, thank you for the recipe!  It is a 10*.

This was my first bundt cake and it was delicious!  In my oven the bake time was more like 45 min rather than 1 hr. So keep an eye on it.  Oh, I used Hazelnut flavoring and drizzled a little on the plates before serving.  Yummy!

Wow!  Great cake AND super easy!  I used Duncan Hind's Swiss Chocolate (all I had on hand).  I think using the original Kahlua is a must.  As I told my girlfriend, I am not a chocoholic, but I may become one after eating this cake.  Yum.

Great cake for my mother in law who does not like sweet cakes.  We made this with Supermoist Triple Chocolate Fudge Cake Mix (chips already in mix) kaluha and kaluha glaze icing.  The best was when I made it for a party with Baileys and toffee chips!! It got rave reviews, definately a keeper.

Easy to make and has a taste that brings it above the competition! I topped it with powdered sugar and fresh strawberries and blueberries.   A little mistake that turned out to be a great thing is that i didn't melt down all the chocolate pieces completely before mixing it in. after it was done there were moist/melty chocolate surprises on the bottom of some of the cupcakes I made.

I made this cake for Easter. What a treat! I had at least 7 testers and all gave it five stars. It is chocolate-y goodness times 3! Times 4 if you put a glaze on it.

Excellent and easy.  Used the mini choc chips as others recommended and they melted better.  I cooked for 60 minutes as recipe suggested and found that that the cake was a touch over cooked on the outside.  I used a dark metal bundt pan so next time I will reduce the cooking time by 5-7 minutes.

I dont mean to sound concieted, but I rarely bring a cake in to work without getting rave reviews.  This cake, however, was by far the easiest and one of the most highly regarded cakes I have ever brought in to date.  I loved that it was a bundt, all I had to do with it was sprinkle a little powdered sugar...  ULTRA moist! Just dont make the same mistake as me - if you have a patterned cake pan, spray it with nonstick flour well. :)

this cake is what I have been looking for- a dense, moist, chocolatey cake. I used 1/2 brewed coffee and 1/2 kahlua in place of the coffee liquor. I baked in two 9" round pans and just watched the bake time. The chocolate chips are a wonderful addition. Whoever says this does not taste like a bakery cake is crazy! I am very picky (I'm a prior career cake decorator, now just for fun) and this cake passed with flying colors. Will definitely be my signature recipe for chocolate cake. Thanks for posting the recipe!

My favorite Chocolate cake recipe to date. Instead of an icing or glaze, I like to top it off with a nice chocolate Ganache. It tastes like homemade sin, and gets devoured every time!

I made this last nite to take to a pot luck today.  Not a single crumb was left to bring home:)  I used a devils food cake and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the liquor.  Super easy and quick.  Great recipe and will be making again.

I have made this several times in the past few years and it turns out great every time. Instead of coffee flavored liquor I brew 1/2 a c. of super stong coffee and it works just fine.

This is a favourite that I make for birthdays, and everyone raves about it. Of course, the only problem is that it is about 10,000 calories a slice! LOL

I use the Betty Crocker Devil's Food Cake mix, and Cadbury chocolate chips. Sometimes I use half dark and half white chocolate chips.

I also always use Kahlua but will try other variations that have been suggested by reviewers.

Thanks for the recipe!

Yum. I have a feeling this will wind up being a "signature" cake for me. Was trying to find a decent German Chocolate Cake recipe for the boyfriend's bday, and found this-he about died. I originally did it with German Chocolate Icing, used butterscotch pudding instead of chocolate (forgot the chocolate at the store and had butterscotch...) used regular coffee instead of the liquer, and it actually came out really yummy. I made it today the regular way (chocolate everything) and it's just as good. Would like to do a version of this in a vanilla flavor (vanilla cake mix, vanilla pudding, white chocolate chips etc) just to see how it tastes. But absolutely two thumbs up for this one. Oh, don't cut yourself a huge slice-it's really dense and fills you up fast. Try a thinner slice first and go for seconds if you have the room! It's too good of a cake to waste!!

I think a super choco-holic would love this cake.  I may have messed up by adding homemade chocolate icing, which could have brought the super rich taste down a notch with the not-as-chocolatey icing.  I bet this cake is great with coffee.

I would not say this cake is to die for, but it's a very easy recipe to impress a crowd of friends. I give it 5 stars because the cake turned out flawless and it was easy to make for the results. However, you can tell it's made from a box and that's what you should expect when you're not baking from scratch - but still deserves 5 stars for a box cake.

I did not bake the cake in a bundt pan, instead I went with 3 x 8.5" layers. I used the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" for the icing and it was fabulous. I mixed strawberry jam with the icing to put between the layers, and then I added red food colouring for the piped edging. Also sprinkled chocolate shavings across the top; it presented very well - friends were impressed.

I complimented the cake with homemade vanilla ice cream also on this site called "Easy Homemade Vanilla Ice Cream"; it tastes exactly like Breyer's vanilla. The crowd loved the ice cream more than the cake, but that didn't surprise me - the ice cream is extremely tasty.

I will try other recipes before making this cake again, but it was certainly perfectly suited for the tonight's birthday party.

Yum! I didn't make any substitutions and this was to die for. So chocolaty (is that a word!?) and moist. You HAVE to eat it with fresh raspberries - then it's to die for x 2!!

I've been making this one for years. It's perfect for the chocolate lover in your life. I like to add Irish Cream once in a while instead of coffee liquor for a little change. Very moist and very rich. No need to frost this one!

It's a very moist cake!! I actually wanna put a pic of it but it just gone so fast before i could even take a single picture.

The calories frighten me a bit though so i altered the recipe a bit. I use only 400gr of light sour cream, 20ml oil and 60ml applesauce, and i used 60ml of strong brewed coffee and 60ml of kahlua.

But i got to say, it is a bit bitter for my taste with that much coffee and liqueur. Maybe next time i'll add a bit of powdered sugar. And make sure to dust the pan with coco throughly (i used mix of coco powder n powdered sugar).

Seriously--the BEST chocolate cake ever!  I don't have coffee liquer.  We don't even drink coffee anything--but I keep on hand a small container of the instant coffee granules and just mix 1/2 cup hot water with a few spoonfuls of the coffee granules and substitute that for the coffee liquer and it works great!  Oh--this really is just the best cake!!  I make it all the time for my family and church potluck.

Great cake!  I poured a can of cherry pie filling into the center of my bundt cake (once I turned it out onto the cake plate) and it was so beautiful! I served it for my sister's December birthday celebration and it was a hit!

excellent cake, but you need some serious milk! I'm not a coffee fan, so I subbed seedless raspberry preserves, and baked it just a tad longer. Served as a bundt with fresh raspberries loaded in the middle. Very good . . . .

This cake was delicious. Almost like a really good moist brownie cake. I only give it four stars because I altered the following ingredients: I used mini choc chips and used chambord liqueur instead of coffee flavored liqueur. Also, the cake tastes totally different the next day. By far a better cake on day 2. I was actually disappointed on day 1 and almost threw it out because the edges were so dry and the middle so moist. I recalled reading in a previous review that the cake is better on day 2. Definately make this cake 1 day in advance!! Thank you for submitting!

Can this cake get any easier? I love it! I made this for my son's birthday cake last week and it was a knockout. Turned out of the pan looking fantastic and tasted even better. Like a previous review said, it's even better the next day (assuming it lasts that long - don't count on it!) I'm making this again for our Christmas dinner dessert using Grand Marnier in the cake and orange flavored whipped cream.

Every chocolate lovers dream. This cake is always a big hit. I have had trouble with it sticking to my bundt pan so now I make it in my 2 part Angel Food Cake pan. It still looks good, just not quite as pretty, but anyone eating it doesn't care what it looks like.

A cake that doesn't need icing?  I was skeptical, to say the least, but this was fantastic!  So moist and tasty!  Also, very easy.  By mistake I used FF sour cream and that didn't even seem to make a difference!  I will try this with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze that everyone recommends next time.  Thanks for such a great dessert.

I wish I could give this 10 stars.  This is hands-down my favorite chocolate cake.  Like the other reviews suggested, I did substitute chocolate milk for the liquer.  I think it's even better the second day, so I usually make it in advance.

Best moist cake ever. No need for frosting at all. I garnished it with fresh rasberries and I won a desert contest at work with it. Easy to make also.

This is a phenomenal cake.  You can make it a little lighter by using light sour cream (not fat free, though, that stuff is an abomination), I didn't find that it affected the flavor at all.  This is so moist and rich and crazy delicious!  It's very similar to the Cake Doctor's "darn good chocolate cake" but calls for more sour cream and chocolate chips.  A winner!

Excellent for your chocolate fix! It's not for the faint of heart. I made mine in two 9" rounds just baked them according to the box directions, checking every 10 minutes or so once it go towards the end.

This has become a family favorite.  I make it in a sponge cake pan, decrease the baking time to 30-45 min. I then mix 1 container of vanilla frosting with 1 cup of peanut butter to top it off.  I NEVER have leftovers!

This cake is one of the best chocolate cakes I have ever tried. Everyone loved it when I made it. I used Chamboard instead of Kahlua one time. That was very tasty as well. I give this cake 5 stars.

This cake was a big disappointment.  I made it for a potluck at work and despite greasing and flouring the bundt pan really well and following the recipe to the letter, it stuck to the pan.  It fell out in a big lump and I had to throw it out.  Not worth the ingredients.

Wow. This cake is so rich, moist, and sinful.  I actually would prefer it a little less rich since I really like to add toppings to my cakes, but still..it made for a very special and decadent dessert.  I loved the addition of the chocolate chips, definitely don't leave those out!  the liqueur was great too, I used Raspberry instead of coffee and it worked very well.  I heated up some vanilla frosting in the microwave for about 20 seconds and poured it over the top since I wanted a nice thick white glaze, added some sliced strawberries and chocolate shavings.  Be careful not to add too much on top though not only because it really doesn't need it but because the cake is so delicate that it will sink down a bit.  Also, it might just be my oven, but I had to leave the cake in for longer than an hour..the cake tester definitely didn't come out clean after 60 minutes.

The cake takes on whatever flavor of liquor that you add.  Godiva white chocolate is my favorite.  Be careful not to overbake.

The cake was very good. I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips as everyone was saying how rich this was. I am glad that I did because 2 cups would probably have been too much. I just dusted it with some powdered sugar.

This cake was delicious! Everyone we had over for Christmas liked it too. I thought there may have been too strong of a Kalhua taste. Next time I will probably use a little water mixed in with the liqueur. I used Pillsbury Moist Supreme for the dark chocolate cake mix; Jello Devil's Food for the pudding mix. I added a little bit of black pepper; I don't know if it made the chocolate stronger or not.

Super easy and very rich! I used low-fat sour cream, but will go with non-fat next time to make it even lighter (and reduce calories a bit!). I also used sugar-free pudding mix, and I substitued water for the liqueur. I think this cake is better the longer it sits. Great with ice cream!

This cake was good. The photo shows a pretty iceing on the cake but the recipe didn't include one. I did use one from a cook book I had on hand and it was good, but would not have been as good without an icing. It's a very dense, thick cake... You will need a glass of milk to finish a slice, but it is very chocolatley!

This was delicious as everyone has mentioned.  But I needed to cook mine for 80 minutes and even then it was  runny when I flipped it over.  I know several people have stated 60 minutes was perfect.  I'm not sure what the difference was, maybe because I used a silcone baking pan?

I am a desert fan and I tried this recipe this weekend for a party and the result is WOW, so incredible and so delicious.  It's a heavenly chocolate cake and which is very compatible to the cake served in a five-star hotel.  I used Kahlua liquor for this recipe and the topping I sprinkled the powder sugar.  It was a hit in the party and I received many compliments.  Thank you Caitlin for sharing this great recipe.

I just made this cake because I wanted to taste test it before serving it for Thanksgiving.  I was surprised by how much it sank even though some of the reviews mentioned this.  I am not sure why as I baked it the full time.  I changed the recipe only by using half choc chips and half cappacino chips.  I also used Godiva instead of the coffee flavor.  My husband absolutley loved it but I think next time I will make it with strong coffee instead of Godiva liquor and will stick to just choc chips.  It definatly was moist and would have been to much with frosting!

This is the best chocolate cake I've ever had. My husband had 3 pieces - and they weren't small pieces. "Too Good For Words" chocolate cake should be the name.

This cake was great- intense and moist as promised... I made cupcakes for a work function and dusted them with powdered sugar just before serving (otherwise the powdered sugar soaks in and disappears).  I still believe the best chocolate cake in the world is the double layer chocolate cake on epicurious.com, but this one is a whole lot faster/easier since it starts from a mix.  Yum!

This cake is awesome if you love chocolate.  I served it with raspberries and ice cream... so yummy!  The first time I made it I didn't cook it long enough and it ended up not rising, so make sure you cook it for the entire hour... its not too long!

Just the name of this cake intrigued me so I made it for the first time this past weekend.  It was amazing!  I actually used strong coffee instead of the coffee liquor.  I brought the cake to a party and once everyone was ready for dessert, it didn't last.  I almost wished I baked 2 cakes!  Excellent recipe!!

If Chocolate is what you are craving this is the cake for you!  I substitute strong black coffee for the liqure. It is moist and too rich for frosting.  I make it in a bundt pan but a friend makes hers in loaf pans.

So, chocolaty and so delicious.  This is one moist cake, and the liqueur is a nice addition.  I didn’t have any chocolate chips but it was awesome nonetheless.

Yum.  Made mini bundt cakes. Turned out great. The cooking time was less and the recipe made 14 small cakes.  I covered them with a chocolate glaze.  Outstanding!

This recipe is just about the same as Easy Chocolate Chip Pound Cake by T's Mom. Only real diff. is the liquor and one less egg. I love    that recipe. I'll try adding the liquor next time, usually do that when I make Kahlua brownies.

Wow!  I couldn't believe this cake was good enough to not need a glaze, but it definately was!  Instead of the coffee liqueur, I used milk, instant coffee granules and a little chocolate syrup.  A chocolate lover's dream!

A chocolate-lover's dream. I have also used a chocolate fudge and a devils' food cake mix and it works just as well. I usually top it with chocolate cream cheese frosting and heath chips. Looks beautiful and tastes so good.

Oh my GOODNESS!  This is to die for.  So simple to make and tastes so good.  I took the cake out of the oven after 50 minutes of baking and it was perfect!  I got rave reviews from my friends.  My boyfriend has such a sweet tooth and I am making another one tonight just for him.  So Good! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great cake, and incredibly moist, it needs no frosting at all (in fact, I think frosting would ruin it).  I've baked a lot of cakes, and this is one of the best, as well as one of the easiest!  My family and co-workers all love it!  I don't change a thing - the recipe is wonderful as-is.  :-)

This was wonderful!!  I made it in individual bundt cakes.  I baked at 325 for 20 min. and they were perfect.  I used milk chocolate chips (the regular size), and I didn't use the liqueur.  I was practicing to make these for a baby shower, so I decided to skip the alcohol.  They turned out wonderful and moist.  The longer they sit the better they get.  If you eat them within an hour of coming out of the oven, the choc. chips are still melted!!  It was a little like a molten choc. cake.

THIS MAY BE THE BEST RECIPE I'VE EVER MADE-and I'm a good cook!  What a wonderful recipe!  I followed it almost exactly- the only change I made was that I used raspberry liquor (based on another review) instead because I love raspberry flavor, and the chocolate chips I used were mini (based on other reviews).  Thank you for submitting this- HUGE "WOW!" FACTOR at work today!

This is the easiest "fancy" dessert I've ever made.  You don't need to frost it (although sometimes either drizzling a nice glaze or sprinking with powdered sugar looks nice), and it is totally sinful!  I've brought this to numerous parties and served it up to rave reviews.

Very good cake, even for me (I'm not a fan of chocolate.)  I used strong coffee instead of liquor and mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. I also floured my bundt pan and no flour was on the outside of my cake after cooking. I did frost with chocolate frosting, because my daughter wanted a chocolate on chocolate cake for her birthday.  It was a hit for her.

Sooo chocolatey! I made this for a friend who LOVES chocolate (as do I), and we thought it was great. Some people at the party thought it was too rich. Very moist, make it for your chocolate lovers.

This is the best cake and so easy to make. I went ahead and added cinnamon as another user had suggested.  Everyone loved it and it really came out moist

One of the best cakes ever & I'm not a chocolate fanatic.  Definately make this if you want to impress someone or get him to pop the question.

This is good. The first time I made it, I accidentally bought a smaller sized cake mix and a larger sized pudding mix (and it wasn't instant), so I put in less pudding mix. I also accidentally bought low-fat sour cream. I also substituted espresso for the liqueur. Despite the boo-boos, it came out good (but not moist enough). I made it "correctly" the next couple of times (still w/espresso) and it came out great. Like some other reviewers said, it tastes even better after cooling in the fridge overnight. That's makes it an EXCELLENT dessert that you can prepare ahead of time without sacrificing taste!

This is a wonderful cake that I have made dozens of times. Everyone loves it! For the holidays, I use Hershey's Raspberry-Chocolate Chips instead of regular chocolate chips. It's always a hit!

This cake is soooo good.  I made it for dessert for a Mexican theme dinner party I had.  The only things I changed were I added two teaspoons of cinnamon to the batter & topped it with a chocolate glaze.  I served it with vanilla, coffee & cinnamon ice cream.  It was a huge hit & everyone wanted the recipe.  Very easy to make.  You really don't taste the liquer.  You could probably replace it with coffee if you didn't have it on hand.

THIS CAKE WAS DELICIOUS! BUT ONE BITE WAS ENOUGH FOR ME. IT WAS SOOOOOO CHOCLATELY! I USED CHOCOLATE DEVIL'S FOOD CAKE AND 12OZ OF MINI SEMI SWEET CHOCOLATE CHIPS. I WOULD ADVISE TO USE MILK CHOCOLATE CHIPS THOUGH (THEY AREN'T BITTER). I MADE IT IN MY NEW STARS BUNDT PAN AND IT TURNED OUT GREAT! I AM SURE THAT MY MOTHER-IN-LAW WILL LOVE IT. SHE IS THE PERSON I MADE IT FOR BECAUSE SHE IS THE ONE WHO LOVES CHOCOLATE =) THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE =)

My guests liked it. However, I am glad it was night time and we were outside when I served it. The cake has a dark green color to it in the center. Other than that, pretty good.

This cake is very good and very easy to make. I made it last night and i just had a slice and it is so moist and tender. It taste like the chocolate chip cake from kfc but without the icing and even moister. (If thats a word,lol)

I have used this cake recipe so many times, always is super moist. I use peppermint liquer instead of coffee for a slightly minty aftertaste. Everyone loves it!

I HAD to come back and re-review this cake...I was put off by the chocolate chips initially BUT if you microwave a slice for 20 seconds the chocolate chips melt and talk about "HEAVEN"! Also the longer it sits the better it is! I am making it again to take to a family labor day cook-out next week! I also made a chocolate icing  and drizzled it the cake while still warm, there is NEVER too much chocolate!

I took the advice of another reviewer regarding adding the chocolate chips after putting the batter in the cake pan. Big mistake. The chips burned and I had to cut off the burnt cake. I salvaged the cake by icing it. It tasted great. Next time I'll follow the directions as written.

I made this recipe last night and it is fabulous - the batter was enough for one full size cake and five mini bundts.  I gave it to my employees as a reward as well as sending some to my husband's office and it is all anyone can talk about this morning!  The cake also worked very well with the bundt pans, coming out cleanly and easily every time.

I followed this recipe exactly and was expecting a spectacular result after reading the raves that this got. I am so disappointed ! It turned out to be greasy. I touched it and could see oil on my finger. The chocolate flavour was ok but I reckon a Betty Crocker packet mix fudge cake is better! Plus the texture is very mousse-like. I really can't see how this has been rated so highly.

I LOVE THIS CAKE!
While I usually like to cook from scratch, when you need something really quick, this chocolate cake is the answer.  It is so easy and so moist.  I have made it in a spring form pan and square pan as well.  The square pan was great for our camping trip - the cake is so solid it is easily cut into squares for individual treats.

Incredible chocolate cake! Very moist and rich, after 1 slice I had enough. This batter is VERY heavy when you put it in the cake form. I baked at a slightly lower temperature and for an additional 10 minutes because my oven is very hot. I also didn't have enough sour cream so I subbed in french vanilla yogurt for the rest and it still turned out amazing.

This is the best chocolate cake recipe ever!!!  It didn't even last 2 days.  I substituted hot water for the liquer as some of the reviews suggested and it came out great.  The second time I made it I used a cake mix with pudding already in the mix and found I didn't need to add the extra pudding package. I baked it on convection 325 F for 1 hour and 5 minutes and it came out perfect. This is definitely a keeper for me.  Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely wonderful!  Have made the cake twice and both times I ate too much of it!  Replaced the liqueur with milk - which was my only change.  So easy to make and no one could guess that the base was a cake mix.  Thanks for an awesome recipe.

THIS IS HEAVEN!!!!!  Since I'm not a coffee drinker, and not a fan of the flavor i just substituted the coffee liqueur with water!  Works great!  I also use two 8 1/2 loaf pans instead of the bundt pan and just spray them with generously with cooking spray.  Comes out PERFECT every time!!!  YUM YUM!!!!!

Let's just say my mother( who is a baker) and has oft put me down for my baking skills actually said, and I quote," This is a good cake. Good and easy! Very Nice." Thanks Caitlin! My problem however was that it was hard to work with as it kept breaking very easily. I baked it in a 10inch square pan at 160c and it took an hour. I made a Ganache from this site as well and made the cake into a quadraple deck. I cut it in half and halved the halves and stacked them on top of each other. Looked messy, but tasted great. I used a chocolate liquer in the cake and my ganache was spiked with baileys. Good stuff! My bf who doesn't really like chocolate kept bugging me for more! Will definitely make it again and again!

5 stars is not enough for this cake.The cake mix I used had pudding along with butter in the mix, so I used neither in the cake.I served it with whipped cream and strawberries.I just purchased the festival bundt pan,so it made a beautiful presentation.Thank you Caitlin for sharing your recipe.

I made this cake for valentines day and it was wonderful.  My husband, a chocoholic, raved about it.  I changed it slightly though.  We don't like coffee so I replaced the 1/2 cup of coffee liquer with 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup milk.  I also baked them in mini heart shaped pans for a reduced time of 20-30 min.  The I topped them with a little bit of buttercream frosting, added a scoop of ice cream, and drizzled the whole thing with chocolate syrup.  It was sooo good!!!

Great recipe!  The whole family enjoyed it.  It was absolutely delicious.  It's true that you don't need frosting for this cake; it's moist and rich enough on its own.  It tastes a lot like fudge brownies, except with a cake-like consistency.  I have a fool-proof method of rating cakes.  It's based on how fast my son eats them.  In this case he practically inhaled it.  So I guess that means it's a hit!

Oh MY!  I wish I could give this 10 Stars!  I couldn't even begin to tell you how many times I've made this recipe since I found it here over a year ago.  It's a staple here!  So easy to make and ingredients are terribly easy to remember.  I substitue all of the oil with unsweetened applesauce, use two eggs and 2 egg whites in place of the 3 whole eggs and use fat free sour cream to make this lighter.  And we actually prefer the lighter version!  I don't think this is as good without the liqueur but it is still delicious if you need to substitute even water.  Don't miss this one!  My 4 year old little boy just looks for a reason to make it with me ;)

gorgeous recipe and oh so moist!  I like this cake because it is very decadent but the dark chocolate is much more balanced and less rich.  I garnish the cake with sifted powdered sugar then I drizzle dark chocolate syrup (i buy the cake mix that comes with the syrup) and finish it off with fresh raspberries or strawberries in the center and a few along the side.  Awesome recipe, thanks!

Really easy..even beginners like me can whip a gem like this...I used Betty Crocker's instant super moist choc fudge cake mix which comes with a cup of pudding in each pack. Very convenient! I didn't add liquer and used light sour cream.. still turn out wonderful...very moist and super sweet!

this is JUST like the one my mom always made (but there's no liquer in our family recipe :-) 
instead of the oil and liquer, we use 1 cup milk and a 1/2 cup of sour cream. top it off with cool whip and shaved chocolate curls, and it is heaven :-)

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday but I didn't have a 10" pan and used a 9" instead.  Although I cooked it for an extra 15 minutes, it probably could have used another 10 because I thought it was too moist in the middle.  However, my boyfriend couldn't get enough of it and had a piece every night for a week! I'm buying a 10" pan today and am making it again for company tonight.

This cake is wonderful!    I accidently left out the oil this last time I made it and it still was plenty moist--it's a great chocolate cake recipe that is a breeze to put together.   Great no fail recipe...yummy!Wouldn't be the same without the coffee liqueur.

This has become a staple in my family. Whenever the *need* for chocolate occurs, this IS the cure!!! I used a 1/2 cup of cold coffee instead of the liquir and it was FABULOUS!!! Thanks for the recipe!!!

This cake is truly awesome!!!  The 15 year old wanted a "death by chocolate" birthday cake.  I used those words in the search field and this recipe came up!!! I used sugar-free pudding, fat-free sour cream, and egg substitute.  It was so moist and rich!  Huge hit at our house!

This cake was delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly only leaving out the coffee floavored liqueur.  I took it to work and it was gone in a matter of no time!  Everyone raved about it!  Thanks so much for the recipe!  There will be no doubt that I will make this cake again, very soon!

I personally was a little disappointed with this. I was thinking this was going to be an awesome cake the way everyone raved about it so much. It's a chocolate cake to me and that's all. Nothing special. I have had many better. Sorry.

This cake was amazing. I made a glaze with powdered sugar, milk, and just a hint of Kahlua as a topping - probably not really necessary, just to cover the flour from the pan.

Spectacular recipe!! Excellent flavor, moist and so good that frosting is not necessary. I bake all the birthday cakes in my family and use this as my "base" chocolate cake recipe ***My only complaint: chocolate chips are a bit too hard for me after this cake cools - I just skip them.*** 

I divide this in two 8 or 9" round pans and fill with homemade custard and then frost and decorate - it is a hit! I also do not have liquour on hand so I use strong coffee instead :)

This was a great recipe! Make sure you have plenty of milk. I substituted a small jar of seedless raspberry jam for the coffee liquer and baked it for an additional 15 minutes more that the recipe calls for.  It was terrific. It has a soft cheesecake like consistency, but still a winner!! Have made this a permanent part of my recipe box!

Had no liqueur in the house so I used some really strong brewed coffee and it worked out fine. I would think you could maybe even leave ths out altogether, but I haven't tried that. Unlike some reviews, I liked the chocolate chips in it, although I think I used less than the recipe called for (it's all I had), but I think you could make this with or without the chocolate chips.

Man, oh man!  This cake was really something!  The reviews were all right.  Rich, moist, delicious.  I also made the recipe just as stated, except that I used an angel food pan instead of a bundt pan (because I don't own one.)  It came out easily and I could use the cake baked side up--pretty!  I drizzled the top with melted semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I made a lot of new friends today!  Maybe I'll be known as the Chocolate Cake Lady in my neighborhood!  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely fabulous, moist, rich and scrumptious chocolate cake. I am not a chocolate cake fan but this one is awesome. Every piece was eaten. This is also very easy. I made it exactly as it said and wouldn't change a thing. I just put a couple of chocolate roses and some chocolate covered coffee beans on the top to decorate it. Everyone raved about how pretty it was and how great it tasted. They kept asking if I made it or bought it. Thanks!

THE BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER!!  CAUTION: Chocolate overdose possible!!  I filled the center of the bundt with fresh strawberries and rasberries, and then sprinkled the cake lightly with powdered sugar.  Everybody wanted to know what bakery made such a beautiful cake.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This recipe is soooo good and easy to boot!  I followed it exactly and was rewarded with a super-moist, rich chocolately cake that everyone loved.  I used it as a birthday cake, and was glad that I followed the suggestion to skip the icing - it would have been too much.  Instead, I dusted the top with confectioners sugar to finish it and served it with fresh strawberries and French vanilla ice cream.  Divine!

Oh My Goodness.  This is the best dark chocolate you could ever wrap your gums around.  My husband HATES cake, especially with frosting, and HE has been handing this recipe out!  I did not put the chocolate chips in (thought it was overkill) and glazed the top with a powdered sugar glaze just to make it prettier.  By the way, everyone else is right.  This will NOT fit in a 9" bundt pan.  That was all I had and I made the excess batter into cupcakes. I honestly can't say enough good things about this recipe.  My husband wants me to make a banana version of this, using banana pudding and liquer.  Hhmm, maybe I'll put the chocolate chips in that one!

Excellent recipe...I couldn't wait for it to cool before I tasted!!  Yum!!!  I used milk chocolate chips rather then semi-sweet and used Bailey's Irish Cream rather then coffee flavored!!!  Also sprinkled with powdered sugar for the overall appearance!!  Thanks for sharing!!

This was great!!  I didn't want to buy coffee liquour to try it, so I used 1/4c. brewed coffee, and 1/4c. sherry and it was great.  The first time I made it I sent most of it home with our dinner guests, and then wished I hadn't so I made it again.  The second time I used 1c. of choc. chips, 2c. is better, but 1c. works nicely too.  SUPER EASY recipe, thanks!!!  Also tried it with vanilla cake mix, and chocolate pudding mix, not a bad combo.

Wow, this recipe is for serious chocolate lovers. It's rich but not overbearing. Serve warm with whipped cream, fresh strawberries and dark chocolate syrup for extra decadence! This is the dessert my dinner guests keep requesting.

This was a yummy cake! So moist! I changed it up a bit, since I stumbled onto this cake when I was looking for a chocolate banana cake. I used banana pudding instead and added one small smashed banana. I replaced the kahlua with godiva chocolate liquor. It was awesome!

Slightly strange texture, definitely not the texture of a pound cake, but satisfied by chocolate craving and was easy to make.  Still looking for a great chocolate pound cake recipe.

Pretty good, considering how easy and quick it is, but not fantastic. I probably wouldn't make it again, as you can tell that it came from a mix. Great if you're in a hurry, but doesn't compare to scratch.

This cake is not worth the money! It is not a bad cake. Its just ok. Maybe after all the great reviews I expected more. My family of sweet eaters hardly touched the cake! So Sorry all of you who loved it...it's not for this family!

This cake is FABULOUS!  It is so rich and moist!  My husband thought it was the best chocolate cake he had ever tasted.
I dusted it with powdered sugar and it was perfection.
It is also extremely easy!

Wow. This is the best chocolate cake I have ever had. I took it to my mom & dad's as an early Valentines Day present and they both really enjoyed it. They are on Weight Watchers, so they both only had small pieces (well, Mom only had one small piece, my father had four, LOL). The combination of the sour cream, pudding mix, chocolate chips and Kahlua makes this a cake that I would walk across hot coals for. Thank you, Caitlin. I could say it a million times and I still wouldn't have expressed my thanks enough for this incredible recipe.

Although I don't think it is the best dessert I have EVER had, it was very delicious.  Very moist and rich.  I served it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  My husband loves warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.

This cake is supermoist and delicious, my husband loved it, the only thing I changed the second time I made it was to omit the chocolate chips, the cake is so moist it doesn't need lumps of chips in the cake.  Excellent recipe, will definately make again.

My boyfriend and roommate really liked it (it took one day to finish).  It was very easy, but i think that next time I am going to try a differnt kind of liquer (ameretto or maybe a mint) or cake (i used a chocolate fudge mix) as it seemed to be missing something.

This was really good.  I agree that it doesn't need a frosting, although I dusted it with powdered sugar for looks.  I used milk chocolate chips since that is all I had.  I also used regular brewed coffee.  Very moist and delicious.

Made this cake this weekend for a group dinner.  It went over fairly well.  Everyone tried a slice, but no one was looking for seconds.  I did not think it had too much alcohol, as some reveiwers have suggested, but neither did I think it was anything spectacular either.  A solidly good cake, easy to make, so I might make it again.

So easy yet delicious.  Everyone who has tasted this cake loved it.  I agree with some of the others that it does NOT need frosting.  I've tried it both ways.  Hands down, no frosting wins.  Powdered sugar on top is truly best way to go with this one.  The frosting seemed to take away from the cake.  It probably would look really pretty with white chocolate drizzled over the top, though.

The cake was good, but not quite as fabulous as I'd hoped.  I used 1/3 cup Kahula and filled the measuring cup up to the 1/2 mark with strong coffee.  I also drizzled melted white chocolate over the cake, then drizzled melted chocolate chips over the white chocolate.  The cake looked great and tasted very good and moist, just wasn't fabulous, so I rate it four stars instead of five.

This has to be the best chocolate cake there ever was.  The first time I made it I took it out of the oven too soon although it seemed to be done.  I did not take into account that the recipe was for a 10 inch bundt pan and it should have cooked the full hour since I had used my 8 inch pan.  When I tried to take it from the pan it totally fell apart.  So the second time I made it I baked it the full hour and I used half Hershey's chocolate syrup and half strong coffee for the liquid.  I also used 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1 cup of peanut butter chips. I know it would be just wonderful without doing anything more to it but I did frost it with a can of frosting I had in the cupboard and then sprinkled powdered sugar over all of it.  It's delicious and beautiful as well.  Now I have to have company over to help my husband and I eat it or we won't be able to waddle across the room. Thanks Caitlin for the recipe.

Made this cake tonight and found that it is extremely moist and very chocolatey. I too found that the taste of alcohol from the Kahula was a little much. Next time I will try either strong coffee or maybe instant espresso powder reconstituted. I topped it with a cup of powdered sugar mixed with a little coffee as a glaze.

This cake baked up very moist and very rich. An hour of baking may be a bit long - mine was done at 55 minutes. Great flavor - I substituted Amaretto for the Kahlua and used mini chocolate chips and drizzled it with a chocolate glaze. The only thing I didn't like was that you could still taste the alcohol - I may try strong coffee next time as others have suggested or even a little almond extract. A co-worker said he would pay me to make him his very own cake after he tasted it, so I guess it was a hit! For an easy chocolate glaze, melt a bit of Duncan Hines chocolate frosting in the microwave and drizzle over the top with a spoon. I would definitely make this again.

I made this the other day for my husband and in-laws. The cake texture was perfect... moist and looked like a brownie. The taste was OK but I think the Kahlua I used was too strong. Next time I will use a more subtle coffee liqueur like Baileys.

This is a very delicious rich cake. I baked it at 350 degrees for approx 52 minutes. I made sure to grease every inch of the bundt pan with Crisco and then flour it. I used flour not cocoa powder and I wasn't left with any white residue. It might be because I really shook off as much of the flour as possible before pouring in the batter. My husband hates anything with the flavor of coffee, but don't worry if you have the same problem, the Kahlua doesn't really give it that taste it just adds a little something. The cake came out beautifully and I just sprinkled some powdered sugar on top and served it with homemade ice cream. Very good!

I tried this with and without the coffee liquor. I liked it better without, regardless, it was the easiest most deliciousest(is that a word?!?) cake that I had baked in a very long time.  Everyone raves about it....it had the office in an uproar!!

This recipe was a huge hit at the office and on Memorial Day.  I have substituted Brandy and Amoretto for the Coffee Liqueur and both are tasty.  The biggest hint I received was not to overbake it!!!

I'm a chocolate lover, and this cake really satisfies!  I made it with milk chocolate chips.  I dusted it with powdered sugar to make it pretty, and I served it with sliced strawberries and cool whip on the side.  It got rave reviews!  I will definitely be making this cake again!

Serve it warm and add vanilla ice cream. This makes it taste like those molten chocolate cake. If you cannot finish it, you can wrap individual piece in plastic. Warm it up in the microwave for 30 sec in medium high, and it will be as good as before.

This was a wonderful, almost pudding like cake. It's best if baked with milk chocolate morsels and devils food cake.  I found it best if served while warm.

WOW!!!  This was fabulous, especially for all the chocolate lovers in my house.  I used the light sour cream and it was still incredible.  Also, I couldn't find my Bundt pan so I made it in a rectangular cake pan instead.  It was fine, with powdered sugar on top.  Frosting definitely would have made it too rich to eat.  Don't forget your glass of cold milk with this one.

Very good recipe..no cake mix taste at all. This was gone at my house in 2 days. It was definatly better/moister the next day so you may want to plan in advance. It's quick and easy. I added a small package of chopped pecans and this gave it a bit of a brownie taste which was really good. Caution - do not skimp on the size on the Bundt pan! Thanks Caitlin.

Got raves from everyone. I substituted chocolate syrup for the coffee liqueur and used mini chocolate chips instead of large ones so the cake had a finer texture.

Absolutely beautiful, moist, rich and delicious. I topped it with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze - even better! When I offered a piece to some visiting family members, my sister-in-law, "That's a real cake? I thought it was a decoration!" I'll be making this many times in the future.

Made this for my Mom's 70th birthday, because she is a chocoholic!  I read the reviews, and followed some of the tips offered and the cake was a huge success! It was thoroughly enjoyed by all! I used the mini chips in the recipe, and I liked that idea.  I also used PAM to spray the bundt pan and let it sit for 30 minutes after baking before turning out.  I had no problems!  I plan to make it again soon and I am looking forward to using the Godiva chocolate liquor that was suggested!  Great recipe!!!!!

A very easy cake that was enjoyed by all on the X-Mas dessert table.  I didn't try it, but I trusted their opinions!  I've never had trouble getting a cake out of a bundt pan, but I did w/ this one.  Unfortunately, it was X-Mas morning before I realized I had no Baker's Joy and just used oil & flour.  I had to serve the cake in the pan, but they still loved it and I will make it again!

Made this for Thanksgiving and for my christmas party.  I like it better with the mini chocolate chips.  This is a keeper and I will make it again and again and again! I do not understand the last person to rate this , they had to have done something wrong.  I have made this over and over with perfect sucess each time.  Perhaps their oven is not working properly.  Anyway I get rave reviews each time.

I used 1/4 c. coffee flavored liquor and 1/4 c. Irish cream.  I also used the 
bakers joy, waited 25 minutes after I took it out of the oven , and it came 
right out of the pan.  I served it immediately with raspberry syrup on top, and
it was absolutely wonderful.

a good cake, but not as amazing of an experience as the reviews make it out to be.  certainly plenty rich.  i had to leave out the liquor and use water, so maybe that affected it.  had to bake it for over an hour.  when it first came out it looked molten, but it sank so much by the time it was ready to be eaten.  it was good cold the next day.  the chocolate chips are a nice touch.

I made this for a bunch of friends and it won rave reviews.  Putting it together is a breeze.  I coated the pan with cocoa powder,waited the suggested 25 mins to turn out of the pan and had no problems with it.  Very yummy!

With this recipe you simply can't go wrong. Not only is it the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted, it couldn't be easier to make. Do use cocoa powder to coat the bundt pan and do make sure to let this cake cool 20-25 minutes before turning it out. I used Bailey's since I love the flavor of it so much and it turned out incredible. This cake received rave reveiws by everyone who tried it. Even those who were not real big on chocolate cake!

This recipe is terrific.  Very easy, very chocolaty and very impressive.  I 'floured' 
the pan with cocoa powder and let the cake sit for about 15 minutes after it came out of the 
oven, and it turned out beautifully.  Did not stick at all, and looked great!
I will deffinatly make this again and again!

This was a really good cake. I took it to a dinner where I was meeting my boyfriend's family for the first time and everyone was really impressed. I used the brown sugar idea, instead of flour - so that it wouldn't show on the cake.  I think that it made the outside a little hard. So I used another suggestion and melted caramels with milk and glazed the cake. It looked really pretty and tasted delicious. I also substited 1/2 cup of water instead of the coffee flavored liquer. The cake was very moist, and so chocolate, sort of like a brownie.

I have literally made this recipe 4 times this week. I  added a layer of fat free sugar free hot fudge in middle.( put half the batter in the pan and add fudge then top with remaining batter.)
Also just to make this THE MOST SINFUL thing you have EVER eaten...find some or make some real caramel and add it as a glaze when the cake is semi cool. I only add 1/2 cup of choco chips...this is more than enough with the hot fudge addition. I have yet to meet a woman who wouldn't kill for this cake!!!! No joke..I'm picky and this one is awesome! If you dust the pan with cocoa instead of flour it doesn't change the color..(also who could argue with MORE chocolate!?!)
I strongly recommend you try this one....it's the best I have ever had.(even competes with CHILI'S Molten chocolate cake)

I LOVE this recipe! It's become very popular among my friends. I use
chocolate liquer instead of coffee and actually frost mine with fudge icing (overkill
I know). You really have to keep an eye on this cake in the last 5-10 minutes of
 baking, because it's so thick and dark it's easy to singe the edges if you
aren't paying attention. I really reccomend you have milk or your drink of choice
on hand when eating this rich cake!

OK.  I confess.  I made this cake to impress a new man in my life.  AND OH DID IT EVER.  He's a real chocolate lover so I made this for his birthday - he left the next day for a hunting trip and took the cake with him.  He shared it with his buddies and I'll have you know that I am now #1 on their list!  Every time we talk, he begs me to make the cake again.  So, this recipe gets five stars (and then some!) from me!

Thank you!  This was the absolute best chocolate cake I've ever made.  I used Dunkin Hines Super Deluxe Moist Dark Chocolate Cake mix for the mix.  I used 1/2 Cup of water instead of the coffee liqueur and only 1 Cup of the semi-sweet chips as I thought 2 Cups were too much.  Fabulous!  My husband is real picky and had been trying to get me for years to make him a moist dark choc. cake.  This was it!  I loved it and I'm not that crazy about choc.  It was better than my grandmothers and hers (up to now) was the best!  Thanks.  Lisa N.

This cake is wonderful! Two people asked me for the recipe and couldn't believe it came from a mix.  I didn't have any coffee liqueur, so I used Godiva liqueur. Thanks for the great recipe.

WOW!!  This cake is superb!!  I have made this recipe a few times and have left it plain, topped it with a combination of sifted icing sugar and cocoa powder and have also topped it with a chocolate glaze.  All are excellent.  Thanks, Caitlin, for sharing a great recipe.

Absolutely sensational!  I loved this cake.  I have made it many times.  The last time that I made it, I made it a White Chocolate Cavity Cake by using White Cake Mix, White Chocolate Pudding, omitted the coffee liquor, and used grated white chocolate in lieu of chocolate chips.  It was fantastic!

This cake was *excellent*, a real "death by chocolate" cake.  The only problem I had was that this cake is so rich that you have to make sure to grease and flour the pan, as it has a tendency to stick.  Otherwise, it's amazing.

This cake was OH SO GOOD!!! Made it on Saturday for Father´s Day, it was a sure hit, I used Amarula liqueur (South African) gave it a twist and tasted wonderful, also I used chocolate chunks instead of the chocolate chips the recipe called for, it turned out fantastic, next time I´ll use Bailey´s. YUM YUM, thanks for the WONDERFUL recipe. This was definately the best chocolate cake I´ve ever tasted or made.               Moshi

Maybe I don't like chocolate as much as I thought I did because I really didn't care much for this one.  Very dense choclate flavor, you really need something to go with it like ice cream or canned cherries and whipped cream.  Very easy to make.

BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER!! I have been making this cake for my daughter for years for her birthday it's her absolute favorite. My best friend and my daughter have the same birthdate now I make it for her as well and she loves it! There's no need to make any changes to this recipe it's perfect. I do add a glaze to it which I found here it's called satiny chocolate glaze it's perfect for this cake. I'm making two cakes today for a benefit and I always make these cakes for church socials, potlucks or anything we have going on and they go over so well. These cakes are easy to make and fun to eat

It was very moist and chocolatey.  I followed the recipe pretty closely.  I used the regular size chocolate chips (not the mini) and I'm glad that I did.

This cake is quite dense!  I knew it was a denser cake but this was even more dense than I imagined.   The texture was somewhat coarse as well.   All good if that is what you are looking for!  

Next time I make this cake, I'll reduce the chocolate chips to 1 cup.    2 cups was a bit much.   The coffee liquour was fine but not outstanding for me.   I might try red wine in place of the coffee liquour next time.   Red wine is very nice in chocolate cake.

Definitely could cut the chocolate chips and sour cream in half as some suggest.  Do go the full hour for cooking; I pulled it out at about 56 minutes and it fell (still was pretty tasty, even in its fallen state).

I made it according to the recipe, the only change I made was to reduce the chocolate chips to 1 cup as recommended by other reviewers.  It turned out, but wasn't as dense as I expected.  Personal preference, I know, ut I wouldn't make it again.

I made this for my son and it was a hit! I used chocolate milk (as per recommendation below) instead of liquor and only 1 cup of mini chocolate chips. Dusted with powder sugar and it was perfect.

Sorry - but tasted like hardened pudding.  A much better quick cake mix recipe to bring to a potluck or give as a gift as mini-bundts is the Butterscotch Cake II on this site.

I used the Godiva liquer & peanut butter chips in this recipe.   People wanted to know what the lil delicious chunks were.  I always grease my pans w/coconut oil spray & dust w/cocoa powder, so there’s no white powdery stuff on the dark chocolate  cake to ruin its look.  This recipe is definitely a keeper as there’s so many different ways to “mix it up”.

This cake is really delicious - and is truly very rich.  It does fall a bit when cooling but that's because it's so moist.  When you flip the cake over so the rounded part is on top,  the fact that it fell a little is not obvious.  I used 1/4 cup creme de cassis  and 1/4 cup blue curaçao - citrus and raspberry flavor with the chocolate are  unbelievable!  I drizzled with a bit of white glaze and a little dark chocolate drizzle and put some fresh raspberries on top also - very pretty. Small pieces are all anyone will need but oh so good.

This was good, bordering on great. Used Kahalua but looking forward to trying with an orange liquor.  Everyone wanted the recipe. Had served with a vanilla ice cream which helped. Very moist, hard to dry this out by overcooking. Was better even on the second day after the flavours matured.

Our family loves this cake, it is my son's birthday in a couple days and this was his first and only choice doesn't even want any other kind.  I do make it ahead of time because I think it tastes better a day or 2 old. After we have this cake and if there is any left, I cut the cake into serving sizes and wrap them in saran wrap individual and freeze them perfect for when you want a little something sweet.

Super moist pretty dense cake, almost torte like. I filled the center with raspberries and sprinkled with powdered sugar and served it slightly warm. Wow, it was sensational!!!! I didn't have coffee liqueur so I used brewed coffee instead, about 1/3 cup. Killer cake.

Changes: 15 ounce box not 18, milk not liquor, and 1 & 1/4 cups of chocolate chips (because I ran out). Well, I loved it but the rest of my family thought it was too-oo chocolatey. (If that's possible) I suggested putting some ice cream on it to dilute the chocolatey-ness. This worked great for me with Mint-Chocolate Chip ice cream but the rest of my family still thinks it is too-ooo chocolatey. Oh well. Good thing lent is on Wednesday. :)

This is the recipe I used to figure out how to adjust a cake mix into a bundt cake recipe, which I doubled to use my dragon bundt cake cake pan.  Have also received a recommendation to swap in melted butter for the oil for a better allover flavor.  Need to make it from scratch as well.

Yep.  Ok.  Not great for small families.   One gets tired of it...so much chocolate can be tiresome.  It would be good for a large party because the slices could be cut small.   Very,  very  rich cake.   Can prove to be too much of a good thing.  (A light, plain glaze would top it off well.)  Good-tasting cake for me, for only 1 or 2 small slices!  Probably will not make it again unless I'm planning a large gathering.

Very easy to make.  A bit too moist for my taste, but everyone else loved it.  I used the chocolate icing that came with the cake mix to glaze the top. Will probably not make again.

I made this for Christmas exactly as the recipe said, except, I made a chocolate drizzle, which turned out to be more of a thicker frosting, with melted semi-sweet chocolate chips, butter & vanilla. So, I "frosted" the cake and my family couldn't get enough. They loved it!!

I was hesitant at first to make this as I thought it would be too rich with all of the chocolate.  It wasn't and everyone loved it!  I substituted a devil's food cake mix for the suggested one.  Easy to make and delicious to eat!  Definitely a "keeper" recipe"

I've made this twice now and have received rave reviews!  The first time, I made it as written with the exception of using mini chocolate chips. The second time, I didn't have chocolate liquor, so I used chocolate milk instead. I used a 12 cup bundt pan, which was the perfect size.

Mouthwatering! I have made this recipe about a dozen times and it is by far my favorite. I make as it says, but I never used coffee flavored liquor (substituted rum each time). For a "frosting" I weigh equal parts heavy cream and chocolate chips to make a ganache, but I substitute about 1/4 cup of heavy cream with rum and it is awesome! I pour  it on top and it's like a lava cake when fresh! The cake is slightly warm after an hour or so, which is good perfection!

Tasted pretty good, except you can tell it's boxed cake mix. Hoping to find a recipe for chocolate cake from scratch that has the moisture this one does.

Don't stress about coffee liqueur.  Make some really strong coffee & add a tsp of sugar. Also, don't load up with the amount of chocolate chips the recipe calls for. I only use about 1/3  to 1/2 the suggested amount.  Always turns out great!

Oh. My. Gosh. This was THE most delicious chocolate cake I have EVER had. I love chocolate....this was fantastical!!!! I followed the recipe all but the coffee liqueur which I didn't have. I had some mudslide mix in the fridge, so I used that...turned out incredible! I also dusted the pan with cocoa powder, which turned out a much prettier cake than flour would've! I sprinkled some powdered sugar on top. I cannot stress enough how delicious this was....the consistency was different than any other cake I've had...the only way I could think to describe it is think chocolate pudding in cake form....oh my....so good!!!!! Thank you so much! My new go-to! My guests were incredibly impressed too!

Most box cakes are now 15.25 oz which throws all the other ingredients in this recipe off. I reduced the amounts of the other ingredients as best as I could so everything was proportionate. Otherwise I made it exactly as the recipe is written.  The people in my office liked it but it lacked something. I sprinkled it with powdered sugar and decorated with fresh raspberries but something about it seemed plain with no frosting. It's very dense although moist. I will probably look for other Chocolate Cake recipes.

Now I'M becoming known as the incredible chocolate cake lady thanks to this recipe!  Easy to make, moist & rich!  I make a frosting of 4 oz cream cheese, some butter, a little vanilla, powdered sugar and milk to get to whatever consistency you like.  I have also made this using a butter pecan cake mix & butterscotch pudding, with vanilla liquor.  
Thank you for this recipe!

I do love this cake, though to me it tastes alot like my grannies Chocolate  Sour Creme Cake. Which is a wonderful chocolaty moist cake. I used chocolate  fudge pudding mix  & 1 tsp. Raspberry liquor in the recipe. Although it doesn't need it, I made a thin raspberry chocolate glaze and drizzled it lightly over the bundy cake. You can use Orange liquor in this cake and glaze and it's also outstanding! I feel the flavoring help take away from the heavy chocolate taste that can sometimes become toooo rich. Wonderful recipe and great cake to have fun with.

YUM! I unknowingly didn't have enough sour cream for this, so I used about 7 ounces of sour cream and 2/3 c. oil - turned out great!  I know this said it didn't need frosting, but it was my kid's birthday, so he needed decorations.  I used a chocolate canned frosting on top and it was rich and delicious.

I have been making this cake for about 5 years now and I haven't messed it up once! (Backstory~I am NOT a baker. Baking to me is a science and cooking is an art. I am much more an artist than scientist.) I have used different kinds of liquor, Amaretto, Godiva Chocolate liquor, Chambord, Kahlua, Bailey's or just plain strong coffee or chocolate milk. I will occasionally make a glaze to drizzle over the top using confectioner's sugar, melted butter, water and a bit of the liquor I used for the cake itself. I signed on here tonight to check out other reviews and possibly get a new idea or two since I am getting ready to make this for Thanksgiving (it's my son's favorite and he's home from school). I think I'm going to stick with the chocolate theme and go with Godiva chocolate liqueur. If you are looking for a great chocolate cake recipe look no further! If I can make it great, anyone can!

My family loves this cake recipe. I have been using this recipe for about 3 years now and always substitute chocolate milk for the coffee liquer; I also only back for about 48-50 mins. The other day I substituted vanilla greek yogurt for the sour cream and it was even better. As other reviewers mentioned, don't be afraid to substitute :)

I have made this several times for birthdays, everyone LOVES IT!  If you can serve it a little warm with either vanilla ice cream or cool whip it's even better!  Plan on taking this one to a 4th of July BBQ.. this is my all time favorite chocolate cake recipe.

I made this recipe into cupcakes last night and our kids/grandkids had nothing but the highest reviews!  Our son ate four of them before dinner was served. (At age 42 he is too big to spank).  I didn't have Kahlua in the house so I used Coke for a substitute.  I frosted the cupcakes with a buttercream chocolate frosting & so we ended up in a chocolate coma.....ahhh....heaven!  I know they will all beg for me to make these again at the next family gathering.

The cake itself came out great!  I put cherries in the middle which sank to the top of the cake instead of staying in the middle.  Other than that, it was received well.

This was only okay in my opinion. I don't like boxed cakes and I thought adding a few extra ingredients would change that, but it didn't. Adding chocolate chips is definitely a huge improvement, but not enough for me to make this again.

Great cake!! Made it as a sheet cake and added a chocolate chip frosting. My co-workers were fighting over it. I've made it 5 times already...work, church, bake sale, Mother's Day, just because.

Made this cake this morning; but not in a bundt cake pan.  I baked it in regular Wilton cake pans.  It was delicious!  Even without frosting as I have been trying different recipes.  Also, I did not have any coffee liqueor so I used 1/2 cup of brewed (cooled) coffee. The chocolate chips I used were Ghardelli.  I will try it again with coffee liqueor as I think that would make it even more full flavored.  I have been looking and trying different chocolate recipes from scratch and have been disappointed with each one.  The next cake I am making is an ocean/beach cake with a sailboat for my daughter's baby shower.  I must say that when put in the refrigerator; this cake was very easy to carve.  So using a cake mix with additives didn't bother me at all. It's the end result I was going for.

I agree with other reviewers who thought that this cake needed something extra. I made a chocolate glaze with butter, chocolate chips, vanilla and tia maria, then sprinkled almonds over that and served with raspberries and whipped cream. With the extra bits, I thought it was excellent, but I think it would be too plain on its own.

This cake is amazing! I substituted plain nonfat yogurt for the sour cream, half coconut rum and half chocolate liqueur(its what I had on hand) and only used 1C chocolate chips. It was plenty sweet and very moist. I will definitely be making this again and I cant wait to try different liqueurs in it.

Nothing unusual about this cake.  I bake about 3 to 4 times a week and have made  many cakes better than this one.  It is def not worth the cost of the ingredients.  It's not a bad cake but not worth the 5 star rating it received.

If I could give this cake 10 stars, I would! 
I use 2 eggs sometimes to get it a bit more denser brownie-like texture. And a tiny bit more oil. Instead of chocolate chips, I add butterscotch chips and my god,along with the sour cream and baileys irish coffee liqueur it made everyone go crazy over it! Tis true, you don't need any frosting. i just dust some bitter dark cocoa powder ontop and last new years eve, my drunk uncle had like 5 slices!!! It was a hit! My cake was gone in about 3 hours! Lol

everyone who i have made this cake for, just loves it. it has to be one of my husbands favorite, right after red velvet cake. i followed someones advice and substituted the coffee flavored liquor for chocolate milk or hot cocoa. the cake turned out super moist, so much flavor that there is no need for an icing or a glaze. turned out fabulous, thank you for this keeper :)

Served this at a party and my guests raved about it. Super moist and so chocolaty.      Changes: 1 1/2 cups mini chocolate chips                dusted with powdered sugar

My husband loves this cake.  My mother makes a similar version.  I only added 8 oz of sour cream but I added 1/2 cup of vegetable oil and 1/4 cup water.  I added about 1/3 cup of coffee flavored liqueur.  My tube pan is 9 inches and I baked it 45 mins.  I also iced it with chocolate icing.  It was delicious.  I was worried it would be too sweet, but my husband pouted because he loves icing so I added it.  It was perfect!

My mother in law made this cake and it was AMAZING! I made it myself and it came out a little dry but I think that was my fault because I over baked. Try out this recipe and don't make my mistake.

The cake turned out good. But I substituted the following: dark chocolate cake mix with Pillsbury Devil's food cake mix w/ pudding; chocolate pudding mix with sweetened unflavored pudding mix (because no choc pudding mix was available in the supermarket); instead of 1/3 cup of veg. oil, I accidentally poured in 1 cup of it (haha..); coffee flavored liqueur with cappuccino flavored vodka (the liqueur is too expensive for me. hehe..); and I used the normal chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet (because the pudding mix I got was unflavored. so I thought these choc chips would replace the choco flavor I missed with the pudding mix). I really dont know if the cake would normally turn out like this. But for me, I love it though its a bit too chocolatey. :D

Delicious! I used strong, cold coffee from a  French Press in place of the liqueur. Can't really even taste the coffee, but it definitely brings out the "richness" of the chocolate. Wonderful, wonderful cake!

I made my first cake at Thanksgiving. I've made about 20 since then! I did change a couple things.  I use solid shortning and dust my bundt pan with cocoa. I only use 1c of dark choc chips. It's the best right out of the oven as the choc chips melt in your mouth! I've even put left-overs in the freezer and a month or so later it's just as moist.

OMG this cake is delicious!  I didn't think it was ever going to get done though.  I cook in Pampered Chef stoneware and always have to add some time to my recipes but I know I had this in at least 30 minutes longer then what the recipe called for (and it started smelling like it was burning...thank goodness it wasn't!).  When I finally took it out of the oven, my cake tester still was coming out somewhat gooey....but the cake turned out great!

I made this after reading so many rave reviews and it didn't come out as great as I expected.   I followed the directions for the most part, but ad discovered I had only about 9 oz of sour cream, so used that. Also subbed chocolate milk for the liquor, as suggested by several reviewers.  Baked it exactly an hour.  Came out overly dense and drier than expected.  Maybe I overcooked it or really needed the full amt of sour cream? Tastes pretty good, but not a keeper based on this try.

The cake turned out great. I did frost it with peanut butter frosting and then drizzled chocolate glaze on top of the frosting. It was so good and not too sweet if you only had a small sliver of cake. Perfect with a cold glass of milk.

The perfect chocolate cake....I have had rave reviews and make it over and over. I used Baileys liquor....little more than called for and you can get the taste in the cake more. Very moist. I poured chocolate ganache randomly over the ring....just made it more decadant! 5 stars!

Made exactly as described.  Excellent cake, moist, rich, delicious. Icing or glaze would ruin the balance, leave plain or with a light dusting of powdered sugar. I have a heavy bundt pan, and an accurate oven. 350 for 1 hour was exactly right.

Everyone loved this.  I didn't have mini chocolate chips so I used regular ones and yes, they were like little balls of chocolate inside the cake.  I could've skipped them altogether as I didn't think it added much.  It's definitely a pretty cake!

Wonderful.  I made it for my 2 year olds birthday party.   The cake with homemade butter cream frosting on the side was unbelievable.   The kids and the adults loved it.   I used Baileys Carmel liquor - tasty.

I absolutely love this cake, and I'm not even a fan of chocolate cake, lol!  Great recipe.  This is gonna sound weird, but I didn't have any coffee flavored liquer, but I did have butterscotch schnapps.  Yes I used the butterscotch schnapps and aside from that I followed the recipe exactly.  I drizzled on chocolate ganache (recipe from this site by ingridevogel) and loved every last bite, not to mention the cake looked beautiful!  My children didn't care much for the ganache though, but the adults loved it.

This was great! I am making this recipe for the third time in a month! I used mini chocolate chips and baked in mini muffin cups for 12-15 min. There's never any leftover.

Delicious!  Served it as dessert for a small dinner party and everyone loved this cake.  Will absolutely make this again.  I did use slightly less choc chips then the recipe called for, but otherwise followed the recipe.  yummmmy

Darn good chocolate cake.  I've made this before with half the sour cream, and no liqueur. Just added warm water and it's just as good. Use a variation of chips if desired

Excellent!!  Made exactly as written except the cake packages apparently have shrunken a little as I could only find 18.25 oz boxes.  I have a 9" bundt pan so I baked the rest of the batter in a little 3"x5" pan which we snacked on when it was hot out of the oven.  I also used oil and cocoa powder to prep the pan.  I made this cake for my husbands birthday and filled the center cavity with slice strawberries and served with vanilla ice cream.  It was a huge hit with him and our friends.  The mini chocolate chips melt into delicious gooey chocolate pockets which is really great.  I'm glad I didn't leave out the mini chips because they're an integral component of the recipe.  I highly recommend this to everyone and I would like to try it will all vanilla products and serve it with mixed fresh berries and whipped cream. Mmmm can't wait.

I always follow a recipe exactly the first time I try it, and I can't think of many changes I'd make to this awesome cake! Everyone who tasted it loved it. Even my chocolate-averse parents downed a few slices :) The Kahlua is what makes it different from recipes I've tried in the past, and it's a great addition.

Oh boy this WONDERFUL!  Very rich and moist with a great chocolate flavor.  The chocolate chips take it to the next level of goodness.  I topped mine with chocolate fudge that did not set up, wow was it delectable.

This was just okay.  I found it rather bland.  Just chocolate cake with chips mixed in.  The next the day the chocolate chips hardened giving it a funky texture.  Sorry, not my favorite.

This cake is totally delicious, I used the recipe to make a birthday cake for my husband, who was just so impressed!  The only difference was that I used applesauce instead of the oil, I lightly greased the Bundt pan and then finished with a sprinkle of cocoa powder before adding the mixture to the pan.  I baked for the 1 hour stated, and the cake was cooked to perfection.  Finished with chocolate glaze and chocolate dipped strawberries.  Yes so much chocolate, but it was so decedent, you would be hard pressed to find a better chocolate cake.  Enjoy!!!

I've been to Heaven and Back! Sinfully delicious. I made my son's 13th b-day cake and it was a hit. I read many other reviews and used flavored coffee for the liqueur, used baking chunks and lessened the cooking time. If you follow the times on the cake box it is pretty true. Cake will rise and fall, no worry. Too much good stuff inside to stand tall. The deer scene b-day cake is mine. I kept some aside to have with my coffee...yummmy!! Plan to try another version will follow up on how that comes out. You love chocolate, you will love this.

Of course this is good.  It's got three different kinds of chocolate in it!  Now, every time our friend H comes over, he requests it.  He comes over twice a week.  Out of fear for his health ONLY, I decline to make it two out of three times.

Made this for a potluck at my office and won best dessert!!  So delicious.  I used about 1 1/2 cups mini chocolate chips and made in a 10" tube pan instead of a bundt pan.  Served w/ sliced strawberries and dusted w/ powdered sugar.  Will definitely make again!

OMG!  I have a similar recipe that I have used numerous times, but the liqueur adds a whole other dimension!  I used Creme De Coaco, which complimented well.  I put Chocolate Fudge Icing on top while still slightly warm (so it would melt and run over the cake) and it was AMAZING!

This is a fantastic cake! I made it for my mother in-law and she loved it! I ended up filling in the center with chocolate mousse and put strawberrys on top. It looked fantastic and tasted great! I am not a huge fan of really sweet things and I though I would not like it, but somehow it wasn't overly sweet.

Oh my gosh, so good!! I plan on winning a dessert contest with this recipe! The only thing I changed was cutting the bake time by about 15 minutes. Other than that, it was perfect!

This is a great recipe...Very, very, very rich! A chocolate lover's dream... I usually make this recipe for friends' birthdays and everyone seems to enjoy it. You only need to eat a small slice though...They are not kidding when they call it a cavity-maker!

I just made this cake following the recipe exactly except that I subbed mini chocolate chips for the regular ones and grand marnier for the coffee flavored liqueur.  I made two 8" rounds and frosted with chocolate ganache recipe (posted by taste of home test kitchen?) from this site.  The cake turned out extremely chocolaty rich (in a bad way) and not that moist.  To be honest it was gross. There was also a strong alcohol flavor.  I read rave reviews which is why i chose to make this cake.  I wonder if i did something wrong, maybe overcooked it? The cake was easy to make, but I won't make it again.  It was not great at all.

Oh my goodness.  This was the best chocolate cake I've ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I made cupcakes with it.  They were so moist and gooey, even after I put some of them in the fridge.  No need for frosting at all.  I took the cupcakes to work, and everyone raved about them.  I may try adapting the recipe so that I can make it from scratch and without the mix, but it's not at all necessary.  This cake is awesome as it is!

Delicious, moist and easy cake. I made this for my daughter's 18th birthday and it was a big hit. Very chocolatey and dense. As in the photo, I sprinkled it with powdered sugar and put some beautiful strawberries in the centre (and candles on top, of course!). Thanks!

Awesome, easy and quick even for me. I've made it twice, once with an old pan that produced a wonderful tasting pile of cake with half of it stuck in the pan. Bought a new pan (Bakers Secret) recommended by Cooks and the second try was great. I took it to work and brought back only crumbs.

This is very moist, the description is right. It's very similar to a couple other jazzed-up cake mix bundt cakes I've made lately. I can't see what the Kahlua added to the cake other than making it a little sweeter. I think if I were to make this again, I'd add cold coffee and a couple tbsp. of espresso powder as another reviewer did, instead of Kahlua. I did use a less sugar cake mix and NF sour cream. NOTE: This took what seemed like FOREVER. I stopped counting after an hour and twenty minutes, I just kept resetting the timer for another twenty minutes or until it felt done. Do what I did and at least cover it after 40 minutes to keep the poor cake from burning.

Wow! This cake was ridiculously good!! I added double the liquor (Kahlua) and added 62% cocoa chunks instead of the semisweet chips... OMG... soooo good!

Yummy!! I used devils food cake mix, 1/4 cup Kahlua and 1/4 cup baileys, and Andes mint baking chips. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I sprayed the pan with Bakers Joy and the cake came out of the pan perfectly. The bake time for this cake is perfect!  Update: Now that I have eaten a little more of this cake, I will say that if you decide to change it up a bit and use the Andes mint baking chips, only use between 1/2 cup and 1 cup. If you use any more than that, the mint almost overpowers the chocolate. (I used about 1 1/2 cups) It would be much better with just a hint of mint.

Absolutely delicious and so easy!  Like others, I used chocolate chunks instead of the chips.  Dusted with powdered sugar and served on a chocolate drizzled plate with vanilla bean ice cream.  Company worthy!

Incredible!  There doesn't seem to be anything particularly special about making this cake, but it is soooo good!!  I used Carolan's and a mix of chips and it was delicious.  Already, I've given this recipe to 4 people and we just made it a couple days ago!

This is my new favorite cake.  Absolutely scrumptious, moist and altogether awesome.  I used Frangelica instead of coffee liqueur (but couldn't specifically taste it however).  One problem I had, and it was user error I'm sure, but a 1/3 of the top of my bundt cake stuck to the pan.  People didn't care, though, cuz the ugly cake tasted so  good!!!!

My husband and I didn't think that this would come out as good as it did. I have never felt such a moist cake in my life! This was a huge hit at our Father's Day BBQ! It wasn't too much chocolate, which is what I originally thought when I was reading the recipe. You MUST try this cake!

AMAZINGLY moist.  We used whole milk yogret instead of sour cream. And baked it in two round cake pans.  Next time i would add an extra cup of choc chips on top after the cake batter is poured into the pans, because all the choc. chips sank to the bottom so there were none on top.

This was fabulous and one of those recipes that is even better the next day! I didn't have the coffee liqueor so I used Ameretto flavored coffee creamer...yum. I served it with fresh sweetened whipped cream with a hint of almond.  Then topped it with fresh rasberries! I will make this again for sure!

This cake is delicious, especially fresh out of the oven when the chocolate chunks are still all gooey and melted! It made a wicked birthday cake.

The BEST! This is the most moist cake I've EVER had. I didn't have alcohol so I used chocolate milk and 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 cup chopped up Andes Mints. Next time I will definetly use the alcohol and ALL chocolate chips. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and don't frost. It is hard to tell when it's done but I baked for exactly 1 hour and it came out perfect. Will definetly make this recipe over and over!

I didn't have Kahlua on hand so I used Bailey's instead.  I sent it w/my husband to for an all guys weekend and he said they devoured it.  I wish I could have tasted but I'll try it next time.... Update: I made this cake last night for a family get together and it was UNBELIEVABLE!  I used strong coffee in place of the Kahlua.  It was moist and dense.  You must have milk to eat it with.  I will definitly add this to my personal recipe box.  Oh, and it's so quick to make (bonus)!

I am typically not a fan of cake but this was delicious!  I made it with a Devil's Food cake mix and Chocolate Fudge pudding mix, I also used light sour cream.  The only substitution I made was Amaretto instead of the coffee liquer.  The almond flavor tasted really good with the semi-sweet chocolate.  I used a friend's recipe for fudgey glaze that I made with bittersweet chocolate spooned over the top and it was really good!  You would never guess that this cake starts from a boxed mix.  Great recipe!

Made this cake for a gal that I work for for her Birthday.  The only thing i did differently was to add about a TBLS. of ground coffee with a tad bit of water instead of the liqueur that I didn't have.  I was anxious to try it today as I brought it to her yesterday.  I had a sliver and it was to die for which she and her girlfriend and husband said as well.  They all ate two pieces each that night.  No frosting needed, I sprinkled powdered sugar on and some slivered almonds and in the middle "hole" from the bundt pan, i put whole strawberries!  Going to make this for my family now!!

Amazing!  Rich, decadent and over-the-top chocolate.  Not overly sweet, but you absolutely need to cut small pieces.  I made a raspberry sauce to go with it - turned out to be completely unnecessary.

I have been making the chocolate Kaluah pound cake for some time and then I found this recipe.  It is much better than all the others I have tried.  The ingredients and the cooking time make a perfect cake. If you are currently making other recipes of the same cake, I would definetly try this one!

First off, I do not like chocolate, so I did not taste this. Made for a football banquet and was dissapointed that it did not go over well. My son's friends tried it and said it was not good. Overall, only one person finished a slice. Though it did turn out exactly like the picture.

So freakin' good. 
I made Mint Chocolate Buttercream frosting with it by substituting a cocoa mix for part of the confectioner suger. It was so good. And I think I may have accidentally stumbled across a friend's secret cake recipe, too!

I made this last night for my father in law's birthday party.  It was so moist and rich!  I made it in a bundt pan and iced it with store bought chocolate frosting.  It was decadent!  A real hit!  Will definitely make again.

I didn't realize until I was making this, that I have a very similar recipe! The only difference is the amounts of pudding, sour cream, and flavor of cake mix. I played a little between the two recipes and feel there's really no way to mess this cake up...it's definetely a keeper!

I made this cake for a family gathering and it bowled everyone over.  The best compliment I got was that my sister, who considers herself a master baker, had to take some home to have later.  She said she warmed it up a bit and topped it off with ice cream and she thought she would die.  I have requests now from family and friends to make it for them.  Yummmm!!!!

Best Chocolate liquor cake there is. I made this for my mother-in Law for her birthday and she loved it!
Instead of the regular coffee liquor i used hazelnut flavored coffee liquor! Great!

Very good cake! Looks beautiful too. But, as another reviewer mentioned, it does indeed taste like it's from a box. You can tell it's not entirely made from scratch!

This is a great basic recipe for a moist cake.  I lowered the temp to 325 and baked for only 50 minutes.  Instead of liquer (I didn't have any), I added orange juice and grated the peel of an orange.  Made for a delicious twist.  Although the cake is GREAT by itself, I would at least add a glaze to the top the next time I make it.

This is the easiest and yet best chocolate cake I have ever made. It has become my signature cake and is requested for get togethers. I make it just as the directions say to and have done variations with different kinds of chocolate chips and types of chocolate cake mixes that have all come out very good.

I serve it warm with whipped topping and thawd frozen rasberries and/or strawberries. Yummy!

Simply the best! I have made this at least once a month for the past few years because it is *the* cake requested for family birthdays and office potlucks, holidays, you name it. I have subbed milk and coffee for the liquer and they work equally well. My favorite way to serve this is frosted with thick homemade cream cheese frosting from the philly cream cheese recipe. To die for!

Bangin! I made the recipe exactly as instructed and it was out of this world. Rediculously chocolatey and rich, everyone loved it. The Coffee Liquor adds a really nice finish to the rich chocolate flavor. I'm going to try modifying the recipe some, maybe trying a vanilla version. Great recipe, definitely try it!

Only make this cake if you LOVE chocolate. It is very very rich. I made it exactly as written with 2 changes. I only added 1 cup of mini semi-sweet chips and used praline liqueor in place of coffee liqueor. Also, make sure you have something to drink with it. Other than that, I never thought I would think something was too chocolatey but this was!

All the reviews were so great that I had very high expectations however this wasn't as delish as I thought it would be.  The problem is that I baked it on a Friday and waited til Sunday (48 hrs) to serve it.  By then it wasn't as moist.  I agree with the other reviewers - make sure you bake/serve same day.  I'm sure it's fabulous that way.  Bon Appetit!

This is a very good cake, but I'd hardly say that it is a fabulous as the ratings suggest.  I used Chambord and Ghiardelli cocoa with a dark chocolate (60% cacao) chunk instead of the chips. I used very high quality ingredients and found it just simply... good.  I am not sure if I'll make this again nobody who ate it thought it was that special.

Oh. My. God. This is IT. This is the most amazing chocolate cake. Followed directions precisely but used Grand Marnier instead of Kahlua. The only thing I might suggest is that for some people, the alcohol might be a bit too much, so try 1/4 or 1/3 cup instead of 1/2. The cake is very moist and very rich. Melts in your mouth. You'll need some milk handy!

I wanted to make this but only had french vanilla cake mix, so I used white choc pudding and white choc chips, didnt have any white choc liquour so I just used milk added a bit of vanilla extract. Made into cupcakes, baked for 19minutes. I also used fat free sour cream since thats what i had.

I gave this a 4 star because I was just a bit disappointed in it.  The presentation was great, beautiful cake - especially with the sifted powdered sugar on it, but it still tasted like a box mix to me and I was hoping it wouldn't with all the recipe added in it.   Not bad though, the kids loved it.  :)   Thank you!

Made this with "Satiny Chocolate Glaze."  It was a good cake, but incredibly rich.  Not a cake you would want very often because of the richness.

I've made this cake a few times a year...still a family favorite.  I've use almond ameretto, orange brandy, frangelico liquers, white chocolate chips and they all taste good.  It is pretty much a no fail cake.  Great for birthday cake.  Very similar the a cake I used to buy at a bakery called "to die for chocolate cake"

Delicious.  I used a dark non-stick bundt pan, sprayed with Pam and will try cooking at a slightly lower temp or for a little less time the next time because it was a little too "done" for my tastes after an hour.  (The Pam worked like a charm though, and the cake slid right out.)  I like to try recipes as they are written the first time, but next time I will probably go with the mini chocolate chips and Bailey's instead of Kahlua.  The Kahlua was good, but I was looking for a little more flavor.  Finally, other reviewers have said that it doesn't need frosting, which is true, but I'd love to taste it with a raspberry coulis to cut the sweet and give it a little zing (and color.)

I have made this cake a few times already and LOVE it. funny thing is, I'm not even a huge chocolate fan either!  I use Kahlua liquor and mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I have had great results with just spraying the bundt pan with Pam spray only.  For the topping, I sprinkle a little confectioner sugar....Yum-o!

I have made this cake so many times that I can not count how many times. I made this cake for a friend to take to a Christmas party and the next day one of the co-workers came back and said she dreamed of this cake, it is always a huge hit at all my partys. I highly recommend making this cake.

Um...this was fabulous!  I made it for my husbands birthday, because he requested chocolate cake this year.  I'm so glad I stumbled upon this recipe.  He made me promise to make it every year from now on!  I didn't put any sort of glaze or frosting on it.  Just dusted it with a bit of powdered sugar to make it look pretty.  I think adding frosting would be overkill as it is such a rich and chocolatey cake on it's own.

I thought this cake was good-I used mini chocolate chips and it turned out really nice with just powdered sugar on top

This is definitely a recipe worth trying. I've made it twice so far, and will be making it again... but will try it with other cake mixes and chips... The first time I made it I used coffee in place of the liqueur and didn't frost it. It was good, but would be better with the liqueur. Today I made it using 1/4 c. rum and 1/4 c. water- this is very good, but seems to take away a bit of the sweetness from the cake. I made a frosting glaze (5 oz. semi-sweet chocolate and 1/4 c. butter) and the end result was almost TOO chocolaty. This is overall a great -and easy!- recipe to depend on.

Everyone loves this cake whenever I make it.  I prefer the "grown up" taste of the liquor, which also helps to mask the fact that this cake is made from mix.  I use about 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips, and frequently replace the sour cream with plain yogurt as sour cream is not readily available in the country where I live.

It was pretty good.  Everyone seemed to like it.  I was expecting it to be a little better based on the rave reviews.  I'm a chocoholic, but it didn't blow me over.  I may make it again, but not before I try some of the other recipes on this site.

All I can say is "YUM"! This cake is dense, but light and oh so chocolatey. I used the Kaluah the first time and I made it and both Godiva dark & white (half of each as a substitution) the second time with great results both times. This recipe is a 'keeper'!

This is the best chocolate bundt cake ever! It's extremely rich and moist.  I've been making it for a few years now and it's always a great success. It's easy to make. The only change I make is to use light sour cream. I don't think it needs any icing/frosting; it would be too much.

This cake was super moist and needed no icing.  My husband said, "It doesn't get much better than this."  HOWEVER, I used my 10 inch silicone bundt an and also used a bread bundt pan b/c it made that much.  Very yummy!

I really wanted to love this recipe because who doesn't want a cake made of sour cream and Kahlua this simple to be the answer to all chocolate cake dilemmas.  Sadly it was not- just another box cake trying hard not to taste like a box cake and failing.

I am rating this 4 stars because of the extra baking time this required. The cake was very moist almost to the point of being underdone. But I am not sure if this is because of the 2 cups of chocolate chips or my oven. I found it to be too much batter for my bundt pan and had to cut off the edges. (larger bundt pan?). Anyway I will probably make again but cut down the amount of chocolate chips as recommended by some other reviews.

This was the best cake ever!!  I used chocolate syrup instead of the coffee liquor and reduced the chocolate chips to 1 cup.  I added a drizzle of some melted vanilla frosting and dusted it with powdered sugar.  My husband said it was the best Birthday cake ever.  I can't wait to experiment with other flavors!

Good cake. Not my favorite but tastes good warmed in microwave next day. Reminds me of a chocolate chocolate chip muffin.

This is a wonderful cake! 
Easy, moist and flavorful! 
You can change the taste with the kind of liqueur or chips you use.  I will definitely make this again.

My husband is a huge chocolate finatic!  He knows his chocolate!  Needless to say, it was hard to get him to shar the leftovers :)  Excellent cake!  I added a little chocolate frosting to the top while it was still warm and some festive sprinkles!  Yummy!

Absolutely the best chocolate cake I have ever made.  No fail cake.  Can't possibly ever mess this one up.  If you wanted to change it up in the chocolate flavor you could substitute for a different flavor liqueur, Ameretto, bananna, almond, etc.

This cake is Oh My God good! I've made it several times and it's always been wonderful.  Everyone compliments on how moist it is.  I do a different glaze using chcolate chips and whipped cream, but otherwise I stick to the recipe. I've got this one in my permanent recipe box!

I have made this cake a couple of times now because it always gets rave reviews.  Even without the coffee liquer and when I am missing one of the ingredients (usually the choc. pudding or the choc. chips) it is still the best chocolate cake ever!

This is a great cake for serious chocolate lovers!  I followed the exact recipe and the end result was a super moist chocolate cake.  I used the chocolate satiny glaze on this website for the top.  Some of my family members thought it was a bit too rich but I thought it was perfect!

This is an amazing chocolate cake recipe. I have had many friends say "I don't even like chocolate cake, but I looove this cake". Like some of the other users, I use milk instead of the coffee liquor, and the cake turns out amazing. It also needs no icing at all, so it is very quick to make.

I made this AGAIN for a July 4th gathering. It was wonderful, again. This time I used the "Satiny Chocolate Glaze" from this site, thinned down to drizzle consistency with some of the Coffee Liqueur. Wow!

this cake was delicious. i used amarula cream liquor instead of the coffee liquor, as one reviewer suggested, and it turned out perfect! i also cut the chocolate chips down to about 1.5c, but i don't think 2c would have been bad. one hour was the perfect baking time, and although it may not look done it is; just make sure you let it cool at least 15 minutes before taking it out of the pan. i just topped it with some sliced strawberries and it was beautiful. this is the perfect cake for chocoholics!

This is deceptively rich with moist crumb.  I substituted milk with a splash of vanilla and it tasted great.  I didn't use frosting but next time will make a ganache to pour on each slice as it is served.  Yum.

I thought this bundt cake was very good but a little too rich.  Maybe next time I'll go sugar free on the pudding and cut the chocolate chips in half.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the best cake ever!! I wish I could give it 10 stars. In the past 6 weeks my sister and I have made this cake at least ten times. Co-workers pout until we share. In fact, my sister was asked to bring it again for a work birthday party.

I made this for my mothers 50th birthday party. It was great! I did use frosting and it was almost too chocolatey. Will make this again for sure. The left overs were promtly devored by my mom and some friends with coffee. They raved about it.

Tastes like scratch, very good chocolate flavor.  I forgot to buy the coffee liqueur so I left it out.  Still turned out nice.  It does look a little plain.  Maybe it could use fudge sauce or raspberry sauce drizzled over it.  I sprinkled some powdered sugar over it to give it some decoration.

Hubby (the chocoholic) absolutely loved this recipe!  I could have done without the chocolate chips myself, but that's just me.  Other than that, great recipe.  Used cold coffee instead of coffee liquer.  Other than that, kept it the same.  Will make again for sure.

I made this yesterday & it was pretty good.  Very moist, not overly sweet, but lots of chocolate.  I used 1/2 cup of strong black room temperature coffee instead of the liquor. It's deceptively plain looking, so I'm not sure I'd recommend it for a potluck.   Otherwise, a very good chocolate cake.

Absolutely the best.  Everytime I make this I get nothing but compliments.   
the only change I make is to add 2 tsp. ground espresso. Adds to the coffee flavor for addicts like me.

I made this exactly as the recipe states and it was excellent, very moist and such good chocolate flavor, and so easy!  Several people asked for the recipe. A hint: we put the leftover cake in the fridge and it was even better cold! Out of this world. Thanks for sharing this one.

This has become my all time favorite chocolate cake! Super easy to make and it never fails. Very moist and rich. Usually I omit the coffee flavor and have it plain or with a raspberry coulis.

Very good cake.  I don't know if I'd say it was the best cake I've ever had but it was really good and very easy to make.  I'm not a big cake fan but this is more like a brownie cake.  It's a great cake to take to a party since it doesn't need to be refrigerated and it's dense and slices easily.  Plus it's easy to make it look really pretty by dusting it with powdered sugar and adding fresh berries.

This cake is fantastic. I made it for a party, and it was a hit. My brother in law described it as "like diving into a vat of chocolate." Yum!

WOW!!  This is an amazing recipe!  It tastes like it took days to create but it is so easy!!  I used skim milk instead of the liqueur like others had suggested.  This still turned out unbelievable!!  It is the most moist cake I have ever made!!!  Thanks for the recipe Caitlin, I know why your clients rave!!!!

This cake is so easy!  It is perfect for get togethers and birthdays when you are short on time.  My family of chocoholics absolutely loved the rich, dark chocolate flavor.  I garnished it with fresh strawberries and a dusting of powdered sugar, and it was beautiful, too.  I've gotten so many requests for the recipe, and I plan to use it repeatedly.

The folks at the office ate 2 pieces each, and asking for the recipe. You'd never know that I used fat free and Split oil 1/2 with applesauce. Also a regular cake pan works out great. This cake does not need frosting, but I do recommend a glass of milk to wash down this decadently rich cake - even with my calorie reducing efforts. Absolutely superb!

This cake is very dense and chocolatey -- but not overly sweet.  It is my husband's new favorite.  I drizzled chocolate on the top and sprinkled with colored deco candies.  Easy to make and oh so delicious!

If you love chocolate (like I do), this is the cake for you!  Its so moist and VERY rich.  I have made this many times and always get rave reviews.  I always top it with a light dusting of powdered sugar.

Everyone is right, this cake is awesome.  I have made it three times in a month.  Substituted milk for Kahlua and it is fantastic every time.  Yummy, my son says.

Alright, this is sooooo good. The kahlua gives it good flavor and the sour cream keeps it so moist. No one ever would've guessed that this was from a mix. I almost didn't want to admit it. Great cake. Oh I drizzled it with some thinned out basic powdered sugar frosting just for looks.

I'm not typically a fan of liqueur flavors in my desserts, so I didn't want to over-do it. I used 1/4c. Godiva liqueur, 1/4c. Kahlua. I was worried unnecessarily - because it didn't taste like liqueur at all.  Next time I'll add more. To reduce the fat a little bit, I used fat-free sour cream and substituted 1/4 c. applesauce for one egg. Even so,  my boyfriend (who had no idea) complimented the rich texture being "like velvet." Unfortunately, my neighbor who is a chef said she could detect the flavor was from cake/pudding mix, and said I should try doing the same recipe with real cocoa, flour, etc. Maybe one day I will try the real thing in future (especially if I follow the suggestion of using various more expensive liqueur flavors), but for such little work, the flavor tasted pretty great to me!

I helped a neighbor make this recipe into cupcakes and they were the best ever. I am usually not a huge chocolate cake fan, but these were DREAMY!!! Just make sure and fill the liners half full of batter and bake long enough so they do not fall. We iced them with a wonderful vanilla buttercream. DELICIOUS!!!

This was a great cake, very rich though.  You definately do not need icing.  I sprinkled the top with powdered sugar and served it with cool whip and fresh berries.

Absolutely wonderful--very intense chocolate flavor!  I did frost it--I beat a pint of whipping cream with one package of chocolate instant pudding until it was stiff, then sprinkled the entire frosted cake with chopped walnuts.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This cake was super easy to make and was an absolute hit.  I took it to my mothers.  She is a great cook and she absolutely raved about the cake, as did everyone else.  This is definately a keeper.  It is definately chocolately, and very moist.  I dusted the cake pan with cocoa powder for a final "Shot" of chocolate.  I dusted it with powered sugar for that additional "Pop".  Thanks a lot!

Oh my gosh! This cake will definitely send me to the dentist! I don't care though, it was really rich, moist and fudge-like. I used a dark chocolate fudge cake mix and added milk chocolate chips. You really do not need frosting! My daughter loved it and could not get enough of it. Maybe next time I'll add chopped cherries for a "chocolate cherry cake"...This is best chocolate cake I've had and I can't believe that I made it at home! Thank you for the great recipe.

My mother wanted something chocolatey for her birthday so I decided on this recipe.  I topped it with hot fudge.  Everyone loved it.  I cannot believe how moist it was.  I cut back on the chocolate chips and only added half the amount because I wanted more of a cake texture.  THIS IS DEFINITELY A WINNER WITH MY  FAMILY!

I've eaten this type of cake at a church function- the addition of liqueur intrigued me. I used Kahlua- it WAS good- just didn't blow me away for some reason. Everyone did love it at the Christmas gathering- I only made it home with 1 leftover slice. Definitely eat with vanilla ice cream or cool whip! I also dusted the top with powdered sugar- it is an easy way to make a bundt cake look beautiful!

I'm a webdesigner by trade and I haven't baked a cake since highschool (it's been a few years I can tell you!). I roughly followed the instructions as i hadn't noticed the metric convertor at the bottom and the cake has still worked out a charm! I couldn't find any coffee liqueur in the shops so I switched it for Baileys Irish Cream! mmmmm! I've made this cake as a birthday cake for my Fiance who is a total chocoholic! I just know she's gonna love it! Thanks for the brililant recipe!

This cake was incredible - I used 1/2 cup of coffee and omitted the choc chips.  I made a ganache to go on top and everyone loved it.

Awesome dessert!  I made this for company and they were oohing and awwing over how yummy it was.  I had a cake mix that already had pudding in it so I elimated the box of pudding the recipe calls for.  I have also made this with milk chocolate chips or whatever type of choc. chip I have on hand.  Great dessert!

This cake was very very moist.  I don't know if I liked the flavor of the coffer liquer as it gave the chocolate a different taste.  I made a double layer cake and frosted with the buttercream frosting from this site which made it richer.  When I make again I will probably use coffee or I'm thinking of trying the raspberry preserves sent in by one the viewers.  Sounds delicious.

This was such a delicious cake.  I made it for a group of people, that all raved about it.  I changed only one thing...I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, I liked the change.  It is hard to find coffee liqueur, and kind of expensive, but I figure I will be making THIS one again, so I don't mind.  Sprinkling with powdered sugar helps the appearance.  It looks like a ordinary cake, but tastes much better than it looks.  Also is Fantastic with Breyers Vanilla Ice Cream!!! YUM!

WOW!  Now, I am a total frosting lover, but my husband loves plain chocolate cake, so when I saw this recipe, I had to try it...so decadent! And I didn't miss the frosting!  I followed the recipe exactly and had no problem with the chocolate chips being hard at all...moist and yummy!  Will make often...thanks for the recipe!

This was incredible!  As some other reviewers suggested, I used the mini chocolate chips and the Godiva liqueur.  I sifted a bit of powdered sugar over the top to give it a little bit of color.  It was so moist and absolutely delicious!

I can't wait to try it with either a rasberry sauce over it, or perhaps some fresh strawberries and whipped cream.  YUM!

I can only repeat what everyone else said about this cake. It is divine! My husband thought it was too sweet but I didn't agree. Served with vanilla ice cream and a big glass of cold milk, it is fantastic.

Enjoyed this recipe.  Used homemade coffee liqueur.  Had to make a frosting for it, to cut down on the richness of the chocolate.  Didn't have a full 2 cups of chocolate chips, so I put in some raisins and peanut butter chips.  My husband made a wonderful buttercream frosting for it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This cake was so delicious and rich. Super moist too!  I made it for my sister on her birthday. She loves chocolate, and I came upon this recipe. I remember her saying "what-no icing?" After having a slice though she had to have another one.

I don't want to give it too bad of a rating because it could have possibly been partially baker-error...but it was really TOO thick and pudding-like. I even cooked it longer then what was said to and it was almost soggy on the inside.

This cake is sooo moist!   I used the Reduced Fat Sour Cream. Instead of the coffee liquer, I replaced it with water once and used Hersheys Syrup one other time and it was still very good and moist.  I also used the Mini Chocolate Chips.  I used cocoa powder to dust the pan the first time, but it made the cake taste really bitter.  So I used non stick baking spray the second time, and part of the cake stuck to the pan.  But it was eaten so fast no one even cared.   
This cake is a chocolate lovers dream or nightmare depending on how you look at it.   But if you are looking for a good, moist, chocolately cake recipe  then look no further, because this is it!!!

When I made this cake it was VERY thick. Maybe because I didn't add the coffee liquer. But I also baked my cake for 35 minutes and it was overdone. I had to add icing to cover the top. But after all that it turned out ok. I still have a lot to learn about cooking. I am 22 and I want to be one of those cooks where everybody raves about your food and calls for advice on what to make! This site is giving me a great start!

This recipe was REALLY good flavor... literally, like a chunk of melted chocolate. The tiny piece I got was very heavy, almost TOO much. I made my own raspberry sauce- good idea. The texture of this cake is kind of weird, I can't really explain it. Overall, good though. Don't know if I would make it again.

Sooo Good!!! I dusted the pan with cocoa and it looked nicer than with flour. Will add this to my personal recipe book. My husband wants this cake for his birthday.

This cake is better than sex!  I added a pinch of cinnamon.  If you like chocolate, this is definitely the cake for you.

WOW!!!  This was delicious!  I used devils food cake mix and instead of the coffee liqueor, I used chocolate syrup.  I just dusted the top with powdered sugar and called it a day.  I think that this is good warm, but it is even better the next day after it has sat in the fridge.  It is awesome cold. . .very gooey!!  Thanks for sharing!

My sister-in-law made this cake the other day. It turned out fantastic. Our family makes a chocolate lover's chocolate cake very similar to this, but adding the coffee flavored liqueur
was a wonderful addition. LOVED IT!

Moist, moist, moist! I used amaretto. Delicious, tender, rich cake. No frosting or sprinkle of powdered suger needed! This will be a fun recipe to experiment with different liquors. I had to bake mine in an angel food pan but this caused no problem. Try it, you'll like it!!

This is absolutely the BEST chocolate cake I have ever made. It is so quick and easy. The cake is super moist and my family LOVED it! I didn't have the coffee flavored liqueor so I substituted Hershey's chocolate syrup instead. I sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar on top just for looks. A chocolate lover's dream come true! YUMMY!!

Absolutely the best chocolate cake I've ever had!  If you're a chocolate lover, then this is the recipe for you.  So decadent, so sinfully delicious!  I sprinkle powdered sugar over the cooled cake for presentation.  This has become my family's favorite cake recipe.

This is an incredibly moist cake. It did not need frosting as many reviewers have also said. I did not care too much for the strong taste of the alcohol. I would prefer the alcohol taste to be a little less obvious. I may try a coffee flavored syrup in the place of the coffee flavored liquour. I enjoy the taste of coffee but not the taste of the alcohol. All in all, I will probably make this recipe again with a small modification.

Thanks Caitlyn for a great recipe.

Wow! If you are a chocolate fanatic like me, this is the cake to make.  I went thru the reviews and used a couple of tips, and it turned out great.  Flour was not needed, Pam spray worked fine.  I changed the liquer to hershey's syrup, and I melted some vanilla frosting from a can and drizzled it on top.  Although I must say that wasn't needed, it was plenty sweet!!  I say it tasted like half baked brownies.  It was dense, moist and so sweet and yummy.  This one is definately not good for your health!!

Look no further for the perfect "make people melt" chocolate cake. Make this cake and be prepared to receive all compliments. Extremely moist & rich. My only problem is that the cake deserves more than 5 stars. I'm keeping this one!

WOW! This is so chocolaty!  Mine came out like a chocolate cake surrounding a thick fudge middle.  I substituted choc syrup for the coffee liqueur & served w/ whipped cream & strawberries.  I will make again, but only if i have enough company to finish off the whole thing, too addictive for me!

I couldn't believe I sprung for a bottle of Godiva liqueur for this recipe because I served it with freshly whipped cream and raspberries and thought it was mediocre at best.  Then I had a slice right out of the refrigerator the next morning for breakfast (don't raise your eyebrows, you've done it, too) and it was SO GOOD.  My vote is to serve it cold.

Thank you Caitlin! This is a chocolate lover's dream! I used 1/2 c of Nescafe's Iced Java syrup in place of the liqueur, 1 1/2 c of mini chocolate chips (semisweet), and light sour cream. It was dense, moist and delicious!  I served it with whipped topping sprinkled with a few mini choc chips. Yummy! I may try adding Ginger's Satiny Chocolate Glaze next time for presentation. A definite keeper!

This was a GREAT cake!!!! I did make one little change - I used Hersheys chocolate syrup. I did look for the Godiva Liquer that others had used but couldn't find it. I also used a mix of 1 1/2 cups mini choc chips and 1/2 cup regular ones. My husband said "I do believe this is the best cake I've ever eaten" And he should know - he LOVES cake... after a little while he said, "This cake is so good, noone else should have any!!" The kids loved the cake - even my son, who doesn't like cake. I'm not a real big cake eater... but I don't think I will ever make another recipe for chocolate cake... this is pure delicious!!

Really really delicious moist cake.  Couldn't believe how soft it came out.  I used the large chocolate chips and it came really well.  Absolutely no taste of box-cake...I'm sure it will fool everyone :)

Pretty good but I prefer a denser cake with frosting.  In it's defense I'm not a real cake person but I LOVE chocolate so thought I'd give it a try for Valentine's.

This was a fairly good cake. I thought it turned out a bit on the dry side, but everyone at work enjoyed it.

Delicious, but very rich.  Best made in small loaves.  or cut the bundt cake in smaller pieces to freeze.  Made it for gifts several times.  EVERYONE wants the recipe.

I made it in a mini-bundt pan, it was a bit sticky to scoop without making a mess, next time I'll pipe into the pan.  It did rise and sank 40%.  My colleagues loved it, all begged for the recipe.  I served it with a Berry Yoghurt (the contrast of tartness and sweetness was great) Thanks for this keeper..

This cake is SO eay to make and delicious! I decided to use my baby bundt pans, so they only have to bake 30 minutes. Several of my guests don't care for coffee so I added 1 egg and an extra 1/4 cup of vegetable oil to substitute. They turned out fabulous!

This cake really hits the spot! I served it with whipped cream.  Next time I think I will put in a layer of carmel, or make a topping to go with it to make it extra fancy.  Thanks for sharing your recipe

This really is the best plain chocolate cake i've ever made! You really do not need any icing in this one. I added kahlua as the liqueur,and added 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. you definately need a tall glass of milk with this one!!!

Made this for my husbands boss and family and it was a big hit.  They claimed it was the best chocolate cake they'd ever had and called later for the recipe.  I used cocoa to flour the pan but other than that I did everything as the recipe said.  Turned out fantastic.  Will definately make this again.

The best chocolate Cake ever. I used Baileys liquor and an expresso shot instead of the coffee liquor and it worked great. You can do many alterations to this recepie and it still comes out fantastic. Try it and enjoy.

My husband, who is an all time chocolate lover, tasted this cake and immediately said that this was his new birthday cake. It has a very deep chocolate flavor and I also frost it with the Ganache frosting for a very chocolate experience.

Fantastic Chocolate Cake. WARNING: Large sections of this cake disappear in the night. I have a nice glass cake stand, which I like to keep displayed in my kitchen, complete with cake. This cake doesn't get to 'decorate' for very long.

The second time I made this recipe I eliminated the oil and chocolate chips and used just two large eggs and it turned out fine.  I like to use two cups of whole walnuts.  I made this for my husbands office and they loved it. I also used vanilla pudding the second time and it was fine.

BEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER!!!!  I made this cake for my BOSS'S birthday, of all days to try a new cake!!!  My whole office are food fanatics let alone chocolateholics.  The whole cake was demolished within seconds between only 8 people.  The only thing I didn't do was add the coffee flavored liqueur.  It still turned out awsome!!!! Everybody had been talking about it ever since!!! I've already been asked for the recipe and the day isn't even over!  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR MAKING THE DAY GREAT FOR US!!!!!!!!!!

This was the first cake I ever baked.  It was so YUMMY I am encouraged to bake some more.  I, too, used Kahlua and I topped it off with a basic raspberry sauce.  Thanks Caitlin for this one, it will be a standard at my house for special desserts!

Buttery and rich. So easy. No need for icing. Great with a dollop of unsweetened whipped cream.

OH MY GOODNESS!  This is one of the best cakes I've ever made or eaten.  My 3 year old loves it.  It is sinfully rich and milk or ice cream make a great compliment.  I served mine with a little whipped cream and a strawberry on the side.  I will make this one many times to come!  One improvement though...instead of greasing and "flouring" pan, use cocoa so that it doesn't show when you turn it out.  I also sprinkled powdered sugar on top as someone suggested!  YUMMM!

Wonderful!  I used an 8 inch Bundt pan and baked an extra 10 minutes and it came out perfectly!  This will be perfect the next time I attend a gathering and am asked to bring the dessert!

This cake is incredibly moist and rich--no frosting or glaze needed. I use mini chocolate chips, which seem to make it even more scrumptious. Absolutely delish!

The perfect cake when you want to impress! I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but WOW!! This cake is fabulous. Definitely a family favorite now. I especially love the ease and the versatility of the recipe . . . will try it with Bailey's as suggested by other reviewer.

I baked this cake on this Thanksgiving Holiday because everyone wanted something
chocolate. Well, my family just raved about this cake! It was really moist and you don't need any icing
My family wants this cake for Christmas too! Thank you.

Fantastic!  I used Godiva liquor instead of coffee and it was delicious!
