Simple, fast, and delicious!  I followed the recipe and used two heaping tablespoons of 505 Southwestern Medium Roasted Green Chiles (this product comes in a jar already chopped).  Next time, I'll add some chorizo, breakfast sausage, or bacon to the pan.

Sometimes it's the simple recipes that turn out best.  Thank you bakerbob.

This was a great way to use leftover corn tortillas!  I used a pizza cutter to cut the tortillas into strips.  Try cotija cheese in place of the cheddar sometime!

Delicious and simple. Came together in less than 10 mins. Used Hatch jarred green chilis I picked up in Walmart. Similar to canned green chilis. Might add some garlic next time too. Served w/ a green salad for dinner. Yummy!

I used tortilla strip toppings for salads so they would be crunchy and use hot green chiles to up the wow factor. Quick, easy and worth making again.

I used bacon grease to try my tortilla strips. I fried them until they were crisp. Otherwise the tortilla strips wind up being mushy. I used 2 hatch chili's and did not measure anything.

I used olive oil instead of butter to cut down on fat. It was good but nothing spectacular.  Simple tasting. Topped it with salsa and it did need it because it was a little bit bland. I used a whole can of mild green chilis for 2 servings.
