Outstanding, an excellent fresh, tasty salad. Use a combination of red, orange, and yellow tomatoes for a visually stunning presentation. The combination of fresh cilantro, basil, green onion, chilis, and tomato makes for a fresh, vibrant look and taste. Sear the tuna in a very hot skillet or wok, and turn with tongs to sear both sides for maximum flaor.

Really really good -way better than it looks like it's gonna be!!  And I even used cheap canned tuna!  I also added a touch more honey to the dressing, a bit of chile paste, some frozen peas, cashews and served over mixed greens.  Yummy, inexpensive and healthy!!

My tip:  drain the sauce before searing and pat dry tuna with paper towel to aid searing. Add 2 TSP of corn starch to sauce and reapply sauce to tuna after searing.

I added additional lime juice and zest to counter the fishiness.I also added chopped lemon grass and dried pepper flakes for some additional heat. Outcome was excellent.

THIS is a recipe that you will cook over and over again- basic but with flair and loads of flavor. What a crisp, zingy change from bland American canned tuna salad. The seasonings are just right, and guests loved this dish and have asked me for the recipe. Try it!

This was delicious! It was mild enough to please my parents, and tasted great when I added chili paste to the rice I served it with.

The fish turned out very well, we really enjoyed the marinade.  The cilantro was a bit overwhelming in this one.

Delicious recipe! I forgot to grab fresh basil at the store so I had to settle for dried - it was still tasty, but next time I will definitely use fresh. We also mixed this with rice - which was great! Thanks for a great recipe!
