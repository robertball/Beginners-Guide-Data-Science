This is not at all like the white pizza I am familiar with, but I'm glad we tried it. We really liked this pizza - the sauce and chicken go really well together. I think we will use that sauce on other things too.  We put some mozzerella cheese on top and it came out well.

Next time, I'll make a couple of changes.  First, it was a little too saucy.  We ate it with fork and knife, although the sauce was very good.  Maybe I should have gotten a large pizza crust instead of the medium.  Also, we will bake this directly on the rack instead of using a pizza stone so the middle gets crispier.

Note - We used Biboli pizza crust.

Delicious. I subbed shredded mozzerella and also used sundried tomatoes instead of the sundried tomato pesto. Added chopped proscuitto also. Looked beautiful.

5 stars overall for good base.  Can be easily adapted to personal preference.  I have made this several times.  These are my preferred changes.  I used Mama Mary's Pizza crust (walmart) 2 in a pkg. - held up perfect for this style pizza!!  I make 2 batches since I have the extra crust.  Rubbed the crust with the olive oil. Omitted the butter.  Used 3/4 c. Classico reg. alfredo. 3 crushed cloves garlic.  2 Roma tomatoes seeded and diced.  Only seasoned the chicken breast with pepper when cooking.  3 Tbls. shredded parmasan cheese. Kept the remaining ingredients the same.  Baked at 425 degrees for at least 20 min. on preheated stone.  Can bake longer.  Sauce has never come out runny.  I slice with pizza cutter after it comes out of oven.  Have used mozzerella instead of feta.   Have used tomato basil feta and cut the dried basil and oregano in half.  But have always found that it needs to bake at least 20 minutes or more.  Thanks for a nice change in Pizza.  Family always enjoys it!!

LOVED this recipe!  Used fresh pizza dough instead of a pre-baked crust.  Also, omitted the chicken and used wilted fresh spinach instead.  Add a small sprinkle of mozzerella about 1/4 cup.  Other than that followed the rest of the recipe  What a great sauce!  I will make this again for sure.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very good.  The only thing that I will change next time is cutting the tomatoes smaller.  I will probably cube them to spread the tomato out more.  They are definitely an important part.  This reminds me of California Pizza Kitchen pizzas.

Great pizza combo! I made this as directed, mixing the chicken with the Alfredo mixture. I chopped the tomatoes for the top instead of slicing them and added extra parmesan on the top. Huge hit with MrByrd. Thanks for the recipe!

The BF said 4.5. Though here are the changes I made. I cut up one raw chicken breast in small pieces and then cooked it on top of the stove in the marinade from Chicken Diablo from this site (we had leftover from the previous evening). I also had about 4 slices of leftover bacon to cook and I cut that up small and cooked on top of the stove. Instead of pesto I had this sun dried tomato brushetta in a jar that has a lot of nice flavor to it. I made the sauce as it said more or less then layered in this order: sauce, chicken, cheese, bacon. I think a little mozz. like half and half would have been good. All the feta was a little heavy for me. Very tasty.

Yummy!!  I made my own Alfredo sauce.  We also topped our pizzas with some red bell pepper and julienned Canadian bacon strips.  Love, love the feta on this!!  Terrific and cheap gourmet chicken pizza!!!

This recipe is good. It's very rich. Make sure you cook it long enough that the ingrediants set-up, otherwise, it might be too soupy. There are a couple of things I might tweek next time, but, there will be a next time because overall this was a good recipe!

I tried this based on the rave reviews.  Frankly, I was disappointed.  Although I did alter the recipe by adding artichokes, fresh basil and sliced tomatoe on top.  I used fresh garlic and it over powered the taste.  I had reservations about the alfredo sauce but since everyone else said it was wonderful, I went along with it. I also used Sicilian style pizza crusts from GFS.   I agree with the New Yorker! Next time I'm going with my gut instincts.

Had some leftover chicken & a jar of Alfredo sauce but didn't want pasta...so glad I came across this recipe! Followed the directions & ingredients for the sauce with the exception of using fresh basil & homemade basil pesto. Made my own pizza crust & topped it with the chicken, chopped tomato, artichoke hearts & olives. For the cheeses I used mozzarella, parmesan & romano. Sprinkled the whole pie with a little bit of kosher salt & cracked black pepper. This was very yummy & super filling. Leftovers, reheated about 10 minutes in the oven tasted even better today - yum! And as for the leftover sauce (which is what the 5 stars are really for) hubs made hot chicken alfredo subs for lunch - also YUM!

such a nice change from regular pizza! i used a classico sun-dried tomato alfredo sauce and eliminated the pesto, added a little mozzarella with the feta and threw on some kalamata olives (b/c i had them and they needed using up). everyone loved it and ate the leftovers for lunch the next day.

Fantastic! I added steamed spinach and Trade Joe's marinated artichoke hearts to make a good hearty pizza. Pillsbury thin crust pizza dough wasn't as crispy as I would have liked. I'll try a different brand or crust next time.

This is such a huge hit at my house!  My significant other often asks for this (at least weekly) and guests absolutely love it.  I make a homemade alfredo sauce rather than using the jar version for a fresher taste.  Absolutely amazing recipe!

I just made this and it was AMAZING.  I made a few changes as follows:  I used Trader Jo's garlic and herb pizza dough, regular Pesto in lieu of Sun Dried Tomato, added some mozzarella, and for the chicken I browned in a pan with olive oil and Montreal Chicken Grill Mates.

Rather than using tomatoes, I used red pepper, onions, and canned mushrooms. And instead of using feta, I grated a block of mozzarella. I didn't have any pesto, so I left it out. The pizza still turned out really well and everyone enjoyed it.

It is for me to have my boyfriend remember something so simple as a pizza, yet when I mentioned making pizza again -it's been about 4 months since I made this the first time and I forgot to review it- he asked for "that yummy chicken pizza".  

This is a pizza that is worth taking the extra time to make it.  Put the gourmet effort into the gourmet. Make the Alfredo Sauce using the recipe listed on this site that has 1800+ reviews.  It's excellent. 

Also, find a GOOD pizza crust recipe and make that.  If you have never made one, they are very easy and worth it.  I use a honey whole wheat dough not listed on this site.  Finally, to the chicken.  Grill the chicken yourself and you will thank yourself later.  Season it with something that goes with the pizza;  I use onion powder, sundried crushed garlic, salt, pepper and some thyme.  I grill it on a ribbed stove-top grill.  

Everything I mentioned sounds like a lot of work but think of it this way, you can make the sauce and chicken hours ahead or even the day before.  Same with the dough. As I said, this is a great, great pizza.  Give it the time and it will be unforgettable ;)

Amazing, have made it several times! Cut the fat so you can enjoy this more often: neither the butter nor the oil are needed, and I use Light Alfredo sauce. 1 tbs garlic is garlicy enough for us. Using the sauce & feta as starting point (good as is), add anything you want: pepperoni or sausage (my kids hate tomato sauce), or veggies that don't need much further cooking (olives, store-bought roasted peppers & tomatoes etc.) I have made it with different pizza doughs/crusts; follow the instructions but make sure the pizza is in the oven long enough for the garlic to cook... A very thin crust can get soggy from too much sauce, but still tastes good.

This recipe was awesome:)  Made a couple of changes after reading the other reviews.  Used 3 tablespoons of sun-dried tomato pesto and 3/4 cup of Alfredo sauce and 2 tablespoons of olive oil to avoid the 'soupy' consistency described in the other reviews.  Used a store bought rotisserie chicken, shredded the breasts and sprinkled Parmesan cheese, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp basil, additional fresh cracked pepper and salt on top before pouring on the sauce.  I also diced the tomato and discarded the seeds, added sliced marinated artichoke hearts and tomato-basil flavored feta cheese on top.  Cooked at 400 on the rack for about 25 minutes, and lastly used a whole wheat pre-cooked crust, absolutely delicious!

Very good recipe! I bought a dough ball from my favorite local pizza restaurant and a rotisserie chicken to speed up the process (without losing taste). I also used basil pesto since I had it around, and split the feta with freshly shredded parmesan for a milder cheese effect. I added a handful of fresh basil just because I love it. This makes a great appetizer when made in a rectangular pan and served in small pieces (looks less like dinner).

Awesome!  Wanted to add spinach but was out, so I added some fresh chopped broccoli that needed used,  and chopped up the tomatoes.  Put it all on some bread I found at Kroger with garlic in it....forgot the name..(oudan?).  Also cooked the chicken in garlic and olive oil with basil garlic sprinkled over it.

Terrific! My whole family loved this including 2 year old twins and a 4 year old! Will definitely be using this recipe again for our Sunday night pizza night! I did not have the pesto and only used 2 Tbsp garlic with a homemade pizza crust that was not pre-baked and it turned out awesome!

Wow! So good. I used a refrigerated crust that I baked first, added some chopped, cooked bacon, and followed all other directions. Next time, I might use a little less garlic- maybe 2 TBS instead of three. The garlic really stays with you!

This was allright. I was planning to make greek chicken kabobs (katplusgoll) this past week. Plans changed and I decided to make them this weekend. I never got around to it (story of my life!). Since I bought all of the ingredients for the kabobs, I had to repurpose them somehow.... I had most of the ingredients on hand to make this, including feta (sun-dried tomato basil) and alfredo sauce, and since this recipe specifically called for both, I decided to give it a try. My verdict? While this wasn't bad, it didn't WOW me either (nor was my fiance impressed). I pretty much followed RRADAM's directions to the letter, but to speed prep, I purchased a rotisserie chicken (after 5 PM, my grocer discounts their unsold rotisseries by 50%!!!). I chose a Boboli pizza crust (all the grocery store had available). Before I even put our pizza in the oven, my fiance commented that it was too heavy (i.e. too much topping). I wondered myself if this would be a problem. Although not a deal-breaker, our pizza had to rest for 15 minutes before we could cut thru it (slices fell apart otherwise). At that point, it was cold lol! My other beef.... The feta never melted thoroughly (but feta isn't easy to melt anyways). Overall, this was decent, but I wouldn't jump out of my seat to make it again. NOTE: Use the best quality alfredo sauce (homemade, if time allows) you can find. As my fiance commented, it makes a HUGE difference. Thanks for sharing! :-)

This was wonderful!  I used Classico Alfredo sauce and added a little extra parmesan to it. Instead of regular feta I used sundried tomato and herb feta.  I also added artichoke hearts and a little mozzarella cheese to the top and it was a hit at my house!  Loved it and will definately make again!

This recipe was great as is- but I made a few changes. One being that I used fresh grated parmesan (threw a hunk in the food processor). It added a little bit more flavor. The other thing I changed is I used sliced cherry tomatoes in place of larger slices ( we found that the bigger pieces fell off and took the rest of the toppings with it! Another handy tip is to use chicken tenders cut into chunks, just place them in a microwave safe bowl and cook for 6 minutes stiring half way...quick, easy, and can be done ahead of time!

I have to admit this pizza came out very tasty, although I wish there were more tomatoes and less chicken (I'm a recovering vegetarian, though, and my husband thought it was perfect).  It is fattening, but a great way to spend calories.

I had a jar of sun-dried tomatoes and a jar of basil pesto, so I used those instead of the "combination of" as the recipe is written.  I omitted the tomatoes as I didn't feel like running to the store for 1 thing.  I thought this was very different, good, but different.  Hubby thought it was tuna! LOL  (It did kinda taste like it, musta been the pesto, I used a lot of it)

I agree, it did have too much sauce, but it was very rich and tasty.  We actually saved some of the sauce and used it as a dip for breadsticks.  I also changed the toppings a bit; we used feta, black olives, pine nuts, and shredded mozzarella & provolone.  We will definitely make this pizza again.  I recommend using shredded cheese though, especially since it's very saucy, because it will hold it all together.

3 tablespoons garlic seemed way too much for me, cut back to only 1 tablespoon. This was a pretty good pie.

Great base recipe where you can a extra veggies or make your own alfredo. I did just that. Added Caramelized onions, sliced kale and spinach, chopped sun dried tomatoes, and used grated herbed monterey jack cheese instead. Made my own pizza crust .Winner with the whole family.

I made this pizza for my husband and I (the boys ate just a plain pepperoni), and we thought it was pretty good. I love pesto so I knew that it would be great, and it didn't disappoint at all. This is not a healthy pizza even though it has quite a few veggies in it, but with the butter, oil, and alfredo sauce there are a lot of calories, but I think it's worth it! Next time I might try it without the butter and oil just to see how that turns out, and that would cut some of the extra calories. Great taste and very easy to make! Thank you for the recipe, RRADAMS.

I made no modifications to the recipe.  My husband and I thought it was ok.  I did like the taste of the Alfredo sauce and sun-dried tomato pesto together, but it was a bit salty and did not reheat well.

Good!  I subbed mozzerella cheese for the feta and as other reviewers suggested, diced the tomatoes.  Family enjoyed the change of pace from the regular pepperoni and sausage!

Made this tonight - YUM!!  I used a Martha White pizza crust mix and it turned out fine!  I didn't have sun-dried tomato pesto, but I found alfredo sauce with sun-dried tomatoes in it.  It still tasted fantastic.  I also added spinach on top of the chicken.  Loved it - will definitely make again soon!

Great flavors - I used homemade crust that I baked to almost brown before adding the toppings.  Next time I am going to reduce the amount of Alfredo sauce and let it cook a bit longer b/c it came out a little soggy.

Super yummy.  The flavor was great!  Just some of the logistics were off.  Next time I will leave out the olive oil and butter.  It did not need it.  The crust was a bit soggy so bake it a little before topping.

This recipe is a regular in our household.  We love it and it's a nice change from our regulary fare.  Just know in advance that you'll have to eat this pizza with a fork rather than with fingers as you're used to doing.  Yes, the sauce is thinner than standard pizza toppings but it's wonderful!  So get out those forks & enjoy!

This was amazing and easy. Instead of buying sun dried pesto, I but newman's sun dried tomato alfredo sauce. I put sun dried tomatoes instead of fresh tomato, and I sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top in addition to feta. It was soooooo delicious and quick to make! I did use about 1/4 c less sauce than called for, and it was perfect.

This pizza was really tasty.  My only complaint was that it was runny which made the crust soggy and a little hard to handle.  The flavor is def there thou!  Next time (and there will be a next time) I'll just cut back on the sauce a little bit.

This is amazing pizza! Very different. I used the "Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce" that uses cream cheese as the base, and the addition of more garlic and cheese MADE it! Wonderful change. I also made this as a Greek vegetarian pizza and skipped the chicken, adding kamala olives and spinach to the tomato and feta combination. Yummy. Thank you!

Pretty good tasting pizza. I liked the pesto/alfredo sauce. I only used about half of what it made. I didn's have fresh tomato, so I snipped up a few sundried tomatoes on top. I added a pizza blend shredded cheese as well. Would have been great with fresh torn basil leaves also. I'm starting to get used to having chicken on a pizza, but it still isn't a top choice for toppings. I think I'd have liked this with artichokes better than chicken truthfully.

Being from Europe, I always found American pizzas to be very greasy and too cheesy. This was an interesting recipe, using feta cheese instead of traditional mozzarella, definitely favored my personal taste. The alfredo sauce combined with the pesto was delicious, and not as saggy as I had expected! I had some leftover tandoori chicken, which worked excellent on this. I used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this site and it turned out to be a weekend favorite! No more ordering in!

Very good but I would recommend either cutting the toppings in half or dividing it over two crusts. Also, I skipped the pesto just b/c I hate pesto.

What a great option for pizza, we loved it! I did reduce the garlic a little & added mozarella cheese on top. We didn't mind eating this pizza with a fork, it was well worth it.

This is a very good recipe...however, I suggest using about half as much garlic.

I found this recipe on this site years ago and have been making it ever since, we have friends from out of state that we see once a year and we all come together to make this pizza because it was something we made together as a group when we first met... And it's that good!  The sauce is delicious and we use it not only for this pizza, but also for pasta dishes, spread on chicken and baked or tossed with veggies.  We vary the toppings but most commonly we load it with grilled chicken, spinach, mushrooms, sliced tomatoes and red onion and top off with mozzarella and feta cheese... Absolutely amazing!

The recipe for sauce is awesome! The sauce and chicken went together really well on the pizza. I altered the recipe a bit and added bell peppers on top, because I always eat white pizza with red and green peppers over the top. And the pizza turned out great for dinner. Even my picky sister loved it, which is a miracle in itself, considering all she will eat is Hamburger Helper.

Didn't change much except I added a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and some diced green onions for some extra punch and topped with a smidge of mozzarella cheese. We didn't use all the sauce so it made a great dipping sauce for breadsticks. Definitely a keeper for us!

Such a yummy easy dinner or lunch! i used pre-baked flatbreads and you can used any kind of white cheese i used an italian cheese blend i did not use the alfredo sauce (to cut back on calories) i brushed a mix of garlic and evoo on the flatbread.

This was by far the most AMAZING white pizza I have ever made. I tried it out when we had friends come over and the pizza was gone within minutes. Everyone raved about how amazing it was and now every time we get together for pizza they ask if I can make one. It was rummy and creamy and the feta is incredible on top.

I always make a recipe "as is"my first go at it,  so for first timers, it's great. However, I used only 3/4 of the sauce, because it seemed like a lot, and I'm glad I did. Anymore would have been too much. For the calorie conscience people out there, I substituted the regular alfredo with Buitoni light alfredo and the feta with Athenos reduced fat feta. It was still amazing. I thought the garlic was a tad overpowering, so I recommend downing it to 2 tablespoons. I served this with side salads and it was a great, complete meal. Good luck and a enjoy!!

The sauce is amazing but it does tend to make it a bit runny. I also found that I needed to bake longer but everyone loved it and was begging for the recipe!

The sauce was delicious...I took hints of others and didn't use quite as much garlic.  I only used 1 c chicken and used 1/2 c mushrooms and 1/2 c spinach (sauted first).  Wonderful!!

This was fantastic! I had plain pesto (not sundried tomato) and I used 3 tablesepoons instead of 2.  I also cut way back on the garlic.  Superb recipe!  My whole family loved it!!!

My husband and I really enoyed this! Next time I might try artichokes instead of chicken, like a previous reviewer mentioned. Also, while we love garlic, 3 tablespoons of fresh minced garlic was just a little much for us. We'll probably use a bit less next time. My mother-in-law will love it with all that garlic, though!

This pizza was delicious!  My husband said, "this is great, where did you order this from".  I was proud to say I made it!
