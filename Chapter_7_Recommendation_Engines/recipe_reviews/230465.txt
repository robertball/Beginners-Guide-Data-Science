I thought this tasted pretty good. I had been meaning to try it over Christmas time. It would work well for someone that cannot have eggs or cream.

It also made one serving which is nice. ty

It doesn't even come close to tasting like eggnog of any kind which is a little disappointing for someone with an egg allergy that used to look forward to the holidays strictly for the eggnog.
