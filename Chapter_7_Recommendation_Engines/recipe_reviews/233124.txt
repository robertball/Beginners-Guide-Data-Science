This had a few more steps than the method I've been using for years but it was a nice change if you have the extra time and an extra hand in the kitchen to help. I loved the addition that the hot sauce brought to the table and I loved the extra crunch of the panko. The brown sugar..not so much.  I will most definitely make these again with next years crop but will be leaving out the brown sugar.  If you use a hot sauce you like that is not too much heat, there is no need for the sugar in my opinion.
