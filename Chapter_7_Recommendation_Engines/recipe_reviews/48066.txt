I wasn't thinking when I made this pie. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added 2 Tbs sugar instead of one. It didn't need the extra sugar at all, but it DEFINITELY needed some spices. I threw some cinnamon on top to salvage it, but it would have been much better with the standard pumpking pie spices blended in before baking. It's a pretty good pie, and I highly recommend it to people who can't bake with eggs (I'm allergic to milk and eggs. Milk is easily substituted, eggs are not).

I omitted sugar entirely and added a little nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves. I liked the pie, but I think next time I make it, I will blend the baked pears with the figs and pumpkin. I think it would be even better if the taste was more consistent from bite to bite. Oh, and I also added a splash of milk to make it easier to blend the pumpkin/figs.

Very good, but I added a splash of evaporated milk to make it a bit easier to blend and we topped it with whipped cream.

I tried this recipe, as per the the suggestions, I added the suggested spices and even so cant say anything positive about it. Bearing in mind that I made these alterations may not necessarily reflect on the original recipe, but I am not left with a desire to even try the original, sorry!

I've made this twice now... It wasn't great as the recipe calls for it (without the sugar), so the second time I added pumpkin spices like the other reviewers, but also 2 eggs, 1 banana and some applesauce. I lined the bottom with Apple instead of pear (my pears weren't quite ripe and I didn't particularly like them with the first go). Also, I made my own crust (no fail pie crust with shortening). So technically my pie was very little of the original recipe, but I kept it sugar free and enjoyed the figs :) I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the apple on the bottom of the pie. I know someone else said they'd skip it, but that actually turned out to be my favorite part. My 4 year old ate 1/3 of the pie and his 4 year old friend ate another third. Turned out to be a great non-sugar, non-dairy option.
