I am that guy who uses what's in the cupboard and substitute as needed. Used Spinach & Asiago Chicken sausage, regular broccoli and whole grain rotini. Great recipe, super easy, super fast! Absolutely will use this recipe again.

I used this recipe mostly as a template.  I did use the chicken sausage but substituted zucchini for the broccoli.   My husband and I both enjoyed it!

This isn't your average pasta. This is Nonna's pasta. My kids' grandmother makes this every Sunday when broccoli rabe is in season. It's a religious experience. I used Barilla GF Tortiglioni instead of rotini. Thankfully, this GF pasta holds up to this recipe like a trouper. No split pieces nor gummy texture, just real pasta as a perfect vehicle to get all the sausage and veggies into your mouth. Be really Italian and add some hot peppers when sautéing the broccoli rabe and top the final plates with toasted, plain, bread crumbs ... you won't be sorry. Grazie nonna Barilla for the recipe. :-)

Really enjoyed this recipe! Had a super busy day and this was simple and easy to make which was right up my alley haha. Substituted GF for regular penne pasta (all I had), added a 1/2tsp (1 clove) more minced garlic, used 1 cup of pasta water for simmering instead of 1/2 cup AND used close to 1 cup of Parmesan since we love cheese. My family seasoned their portions with garlic salt and pepper before eating and it helped with taste issues (we thought it was a bit bland without it) Will definitely be making again! Want to try with other veggies like spinach or mushrooms YUM

This was super easy and I loved it! Did not have the rabe on hand so used regular broccoli. Still delicious. Will make this again.

Good basic recipe. Like others I substitute with what I have available in house. I used kale and didn’t need to boil that,just added to chicken sausage in pan . Also used Barilla extra protein farfalle. Delicious quick weeknight dinner!

I made this with items I had in the cupboard. I didn't have gluten free rotini, but I did have tri-colored veggie rotini. It was easy and fast. However, I have cooked with pasta water in the past. I don't think half a cup of pasta water was enough. Next time I will reserve  more than half a cup and add as needed. Maybe a little more white wine as well. It was a tasty dish and seemed light, however, it was missing some sort of flavor I couldn't put my finger on.
