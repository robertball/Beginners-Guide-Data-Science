I'm the submitter of this recipe and I want it to be perfect, so please know that the simmer times need to be increased.  When simmering the cider and spices, up the time to nearly an hour at a very low simmer, to reduce the cider somewhat.  After adding the cranberries, simmer until nice and thick.

The taste was really good but it was too soupy even after adding gelatin to it.  Next time I will use less apple cider, cut it down by 1/3.

WARNING! This sauce is highly addictive. I have never liked cranberry sauce out of the can and just don't see what purpose it serves. Not wanting buy canned cranberry sauce I though I'd give this a trial run before thanksgiving. I'm so glad I did. This is definitely a keeper. When I was making this my wife came from a back room in the house and wanted to know what smelled so good. It does take ever bit of an hour to thicken up on a simmer but who cares, your home will smell happy, happy. Thank you mimosa.

I let this simmer on low for a good hour or so. It was thick and flavorful...perfect!

ok so I never eat cranberry sauce because of the after taste of the cranberries.. anyways I'm cooking Thanksgiving dinner for the first time this year and my mom wanted cranberry sauce the looks like a glob of jello kind.. keeps the form of the can... well I was making everything else from scratch so decided to give this recipe a try.. I made sure to simmer the liquid part and reduce it down about an hour.. then added the cranberries, after they popped I reduced heat again and simmered until nice and thick.. tried it and OMG I actually might eat this with my meal, and maybe next day on toast, and I'll look up more things to use cranberry sauce in or on because this is really Yummy and smells amazing. thank you.

I made this, which was also my first attempt to make any cranberry sauce. (In fact I haven't done much cooking in my life.) I love cranberry sauce to start with, but this was an amazing taste blend to me, delicious and potent! Probably only for some tastes, but I already got the ingredients to make a second batch, and look forward to having it again! I doubled the recipe, it being for a church potluck, which moderately filled a 2 quart Pyrex casserole dish. It was runny at first, but jelled nicely after refrigeration. Did require a long time cooking, as others have said, and for that reason I may cut back a little on the cider next time.

Wanted to try something different this year over my usual oranges, cranberries and sugar.  This is okay.  I'm taking it to Thanksgiving tomorrow and my fear is that the spices will overpower the turkey.  We will see.  I let it simmer for an hour to thicken up.  I like the consistency.  I don't hate it but just not sure if I like it enough to keep around.
