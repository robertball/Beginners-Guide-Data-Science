I just keep making "this" cake.  I did vanilla pudding/milk chocolate chips first, then chocolate pudding/semi-sweet chips, then lemon pudding/dried blueberries (that was wonderful!), then chocolate pudding/heath bits and milk chocolate chips, then pistachio pudding, then butterscotch pudding/mini-chips, and most recently, coconut pudding/mini-chips.. and they've all been big hits.  most versatile and easily adapted recipe I've ever come across.  In the process I've reduced the oil to 1/2 cup, and this last one was skimpy on the sour cream too (because I didn't have the full amount on hand).. I really think it's better with the less oil.  (try the lemon/blueberry one.. yummm..)

I should of reviewed this MUCH sooner. This is great. I made this cake for the first time back in December and have made it about 30 times. I sell cakes and pies out of my home and this is a big seller. The only problem I found was it takes 1.5 hours to cook instead of 55 to 60 min. I used the mini chips and have never had a problem. I use the whole 3/4 cup of oil. Anyone who states that this recipe did not turn out, needs to give up baking for they do not know what they are doing.I do use a Chocolate glaze instead of dusting with confectioners' sugar.

Very good and super moist (almost too moist)!  I used vanilla pudding instead of choc. Most all of the chips sort of settled to the bottom of the cake during baking so perhaps mini choc chips could be used instead with more even results.

I should of rated this recipe 2 years ago but better late than never. I have fixed this cake at lease 20 times and all I can say is EAZY and GREAT!!

I do adjust the temperature for baking from 325 degree to 350 and bake for 50 minutes. At the 325 degrees it takes longer than stated.

I first had this cake when my boss made it for me for my birthday-- but I had given her the recipe off this site.  It was wonderful!  Then I tried it for myself and it flopped!  I baked it about 20 minutes longer than it said because it wouldn't get done, then the top got too dark- but when I tried to invert it onto a rack the top half stayed in the pan (but it still tasted really good so I put it in a ziploc and my fiance and I ate it with ice cream and hot fudge!!).....so then I tried it in 3 8 inch layer pans-- that worked pretty good, but lost the "pound cake" feel.  FINALLY, I tried it again today with only 1/2 cup of the oil and I used 1 cup of choc chips-- and it turned out beautifully--  I'm taking it to work tomorrow for a co worker who is a chocaholic and I know he'll love it!!  Just a note, though, I had to bake it for an hour and 20 minutes.  My oven may be a little off, but I have a temp guage that said it was fine-- My point is-- if it doesn't work the first time, try, try again because this cake is one that you won't be able to resist!!!!! yummy....

I made this yesterday for a friend's birthday using vanilla pudding, mini chocolate chips and peanut butter chips, and drizzled "satiny chocolate glaze" (from this site) over the top of the cake.  It was wonderful!  I did use about 1/2 cup oil and reduced the sugar to about 1/3 cup.  Note that this is a very moist cake.  I baked it for about 65 minutes because I didn't think it was getting done.  It always seemed wet inside.  I probably baked it a little too long - the inside was still very moist but the outside browned a bit too much.  A very versatile and easy recipe.  Thanks!
3/31/03 - I made this recipe for my Mom over the weekend.  I used a white cake mix, lemon pudding and about 3/4 cup of dried blueberries.  It was very good.  So good that most of it is already gone.

I have made this cake twice now.  My boys love it.  My husbands co-workers said it was the best cake they had ever had.  This one is definitely a keeper (Thanks!) I did reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup and the oil to 2/3 making the difference up with water.  Saved a few calories(ha ha ha)

Very good and easy cake..thanks t's mom!
I cut the oil to 1/2 cup, and the cake was still very moist and light. 
Also, I just happened to find white chocolate pudding mix at the grocer, and tried that...it was delish!
Hard to believe this is not a total "from scratch" cake...I'll never tell!

I made this cake with vanilla pudding, because I didn't have chocolate.  I used mini morsels instead of the bigger chocolate chips.  I have tasted this cake both with chocolate and vanilla now and have to say that it is great both ways!!  I wonder how it would be with either lemon or banana pudding?  I also used loaf pans so that I could freeze part of the recipe.  They turned out great!!!!  Thanks for such an easy and versatile recipe.

This cake turned out SO moist! The only thing I did differently was I used mini chocolate chips instead of regular chips and I'm glad I did!. Those chips stayed all throughout the cake perfectly! The only thing I would do differently is I would put the cake mix through a sifter before making the cake as I had a few small yellow bits in amongst the cake. When I made this cake I also made a pumpkin/cinnamon cake. I subbed a box of pumpkin pie spice pudding(available around the holidays) and half a can of pumpkin puree. Half a can of pumpkin is only about 2/3 cup so I topped it off with sour cream so I had the other half a can for the next time. Instead of chocolate chips I used cinnamon chips(available around the holidays) and this cake also came our super yummy! There were mixed views from the family about how there wasn't enough pumpkin flavor but I thought it was delicious. I do agree with some other reviews that there might be a little too much oil in it so I might cut back a little next time.

I love this cake, super yummy!  I put it in two 9" pans and used a filling, it was a HIT!!!!  I coated the chocolate chips in a little bit of flour, it keeps them from sinking to the bottom.  Two thumbs up!!!  Thanks!

Very moist and delicious! I used chocolate fudge pudding, since that is what I had on hand, as well as semi-sweet chocolate chips. Had no trouble at all with regular-sized chips, they did not sink to the bottom. I will make this again and again - thank you! MMM!

I tried this recipe exactly as stated first and it was simply too rich for us. Then I adapted it using 1/2 c. butter instead of oil, added NO extra sugar, used lite sour cream and no chips or dusting sugar and it was phenomenal! Thanks for the idea! It was good with butter pecan cake and pumpkin pudding, also chocolate cake with chocolate pudding and vanilla frosting is a winner! So many combos!

This cake was very moist and delicious.  Only problem I had was cook time.  Had to leave it in about 15 minutes longer than directions stated.  This is a great cake.

LOVE this cake - just wish it didn't use a cake mix as I generally cook from scratch.  I like to bake this in mini bundt pans (1/2 cup batter per pan, bake on cookie sheet for 30 minutes).  I serve the cake warm with the following chocolate sauce on top:  8 oz Ghiradelli semisweet chocolate squares, 1 cup cream, 1/2 cup sugar.  Chop chocolate evenly.  In saucepan, heat 1/2 cup of the cream and all of the sugar until it starts to boil.  Remove from heat.  Add chocolate and stir until smooth.  Add remaining 1/2 cup cream and again stir until smooth and cream is incorporated.  While warm, pour over warm cake.  Can reheat "leftovers" later for another cake.  Serve over cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  YUMMY!  Taste VERY MUCH like Appleby's Triple Chocolate Meltdown.  Also, this cake works great in 3-D CHARACTER CAKE PANS!  Made an upright train cake for my son's birthday using this cake recipe, and it turned out wonderful!

I used about 2/3 cup oil and cooked on 325 x 60 min. Came out great. Also - used regular chips and had no problem with them dropping to the bottom.

This is a good, although I admit some disappointment in the white lumps that remained from the yellow cake mix and didn't incorporate.  While I mixed the batter very well, over mixing isn't good and the cake doesn't entirely 'mix'.  I'd use a chocolate cake mix next time so that presentation isn't a problem.

This is the second five star cake recipe I have tried that I didn't care for.  I think it is the pudding in the recipe, it has an odd taste to me.  I used a package of small semi-sweet chips like someone recommended and I had no problems with anything sticking to the pan.  This recipe was moist and wasn't bad, I just thought it tasted like something out of a box.

I don't really know where to start with this recipe. First, I used a lemon pudding mix and the dried blueberries as some people suggested but I followed the recipe exactly otherwise. The cake came out different from what I expected. It isn't a pound cake in the traditional sense.

It is very oily and doesn't seem as sturdy as a pound cake. There is so much oil that quite a bit remains on the plate. It also caused the cake to stick to the plate in a gooey, unappetizing way. It was definitely finished baking, just far too oily. 

I plan on putting some frosting on this cake and keeping it in the refrigerator. Perhaps chilling it will help it firm up a bit. It isn't an inedible cake especially if you don't bake from scratch very often but it does retain that weird "manufactured" quality that cake mixes often have. 

I'm giving it 4 stars because I should have known what to expect from a cake mix. Minus 1 star for being overly oily and another for calling itself a pound cake when it is not.

Love, love , LOVE this cake.  My very picky aunt really like it.  I made the version using lemon pudding and dried blueberry juice-infused cranberries (couldn't find dried blueberries in my little town).  It was moist and tender.  I had to bake it a little longer and had a lttle trouble getting it out of the Bundt pan that I used but it was still pretty enough to put on a cake stand.  It was the perfect ending to great Saturday evening meal.

great! I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I omitted the extra 1/2 c of sugar. Topped it with homemade whipping cream, blackberry and some mint for presentation. Took a little over 60 minutes to cook. yum!

This is a great recipe...I have made it many times with several variations (different flavor cake mixes/pudding).  Just tried a yellow cake mix with lemon pudding and blueberries instead of chocolate chips...yummy!

I made this cake over the weekend and it was delicious. I did omit the sugar, reduced the oil, and used semi-sweet chocolate chips. It is "lip smackin" good heated a few seconds in the microwave and served with cool whip...tastes like it just came out of the oven. It is very moist and 
and I will make again soon.

Mmmmmmmmm!  I made this for a surprise birthday party for my friend and everyone loved it.  I used light sour cream and chocolate fudge pudding mix.  As other reviewers had suggested, I used mini chocolate morsels instead of the regular and had no problems at all with them sticking to the pan.  I also added some toffee chips to the batter and only used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil.  The cake turned out dense, like a true pound cake and so chocolaty good!  Since the birthday girl is an extreme chocolate lover, I topped the cake with the 'Satiny Chocolate Glaze' from this website.  Then, I topped that with toffee bits and melted some buterscotch chips, put them in a small ziploc bag and squeezed out twirlies on top of the cake.  It looked fantastic and tasted awesome.  I'm not really a huge chocolate lover, but even I liked it a lot.  Definitely going in my 'keeper' file!

I made this cake and brought it over to a friend's house as a housewarming gift - they absolutely loved it! In fact, her husband and oldest son were fighting over the last slice. The best thing about it is that it's so easy to make. I used mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and vanilla pudding - it worked great. The mini chips didn't sink down to the bottom.

I used this recipe as a base to make a couple types, and am thinking up more!  The first was devil's food cake mix with vanilla pudding mix and Kahlua instead of water, dark chocolate chips and fudge icing.  So decadent I had to stop them from fighting over the last piece.  The second was french vanilla cake mix, white chocolate pudding mix, Advockaat (egg cream liquer), and white chocolate chips, french vanilla icing. (We decorated it with red and green for x-mas) There isn't any left, so I think I am going to have to think up another. ;-)  Thank you so much for such a wonderful base recipe!  ps My daughter Tricia, whom we call T, said: "of course its good, its from T's mom!"  lol

Over the years of passing this cake off as a scratch cake, I have found that using a 1/2 cup of unsweetened applesauce in place of the oil works great -- fewer calories and still very moist. You can also use egg beaters and the low-fat or sugar-free versions of sour cream and pudding to decrease the calories.

This is very good, however, mine is just as good and even easier to make.  See Chocolate Chip Pound Cake.

I followed the recipe exactly, only difference was that I used mini chocolate chips.  I never got to taste this cake as I gave it as a hostess gift, but I was told it was excellent.  It was certainly very easy to make, and smelt delicious!

This is so good, it doesn't even need a glaze!!  I normally use a yellow cake mix with a box of vanilla pudding instead of the chocolate.  It is incredibly moist and gets better every day (if it lasts that long).  I mix some of the chocolate chips into the batter, then sprinkle a few on top before sticking it in the oven.  Otherwise the chocolate chips tend to all congregate at the bottom of the pan.  GREAT recipe!  This one is a keeper, folks!

Awesome is the only word I can use to describe this recipe. I took advice and used vanilla pudding instead of chocolate. Very moist. Took to work and everyone loved it. Will definately make this one again, but next time will try suggestion of lemon pudding and blueberries..

I also reverse the recipe with chocolate cake mix and vanilla pudding...... still comes out yummy and my kids immediately said "Oh mom this one is a keeper".  The only change I make is I preheat and bake at 350 degrees for 55 minutes ....... it comes out perfect...... Thanks Prissycat

This cake is moist, rich and easy to make.  I did make every attempt to slash the calories though.  I used Sugar-Free Vanilla Pudding with my Yellow Cake Mix.  I didn't add the sugar...the cake mix and pudding mix are sweet enough.  I also used 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce, plus 2 Tablespoons Canola Oil, and I used Lite Sour Cream, and mini-chocolate chips.   My daughter just called and said she used a Lemon Cake Mix along with a Sugar-Free Vanilla Pudding Mix....along with the same adjustments I made to cut the calories.  She says I just have to try that combination, it's delicious.  She put a Lemon Glaze on the Cake also.

With some chocolate gnache on top and a little whipped cream on the side this is the perfect dessert. Every one went back for seconds.

This is an outstanding recipe!  I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and used 5.9 oz. package of instant chcolate pudding mix since I couldn't find a 3.9 oz pudding mix.  Also, as others suggested, I mixed 2 TBSP of flour with the chocolate chips and frosted with "Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze" from allrecipes.  This is a fantastic cake!

Just tried this recipe and I looove it! I was looking for a good chocolate chip cake for my daughter's birthday and liked the ingredients I saw. I used yellow cake mix & mini chips. I made cupcakes with it and they're so dense and moist! I omitted the sugar, used 1/2 cp oil and low fat sour cream. I tossed the mini choc chips in some of the dry cake mix to prevent them from falling to the bottom of the cupcakes. It worked great! I got 24 cupcakes & 1 mini loaf out of the recipe. I'll definitely be using this again! It will make great mni loaves to give as gifts! Can't wait to hear what my friends and family think of them!!

OMG this is great.  After reading reviews, I reduced oil to 1/2 cup, cooked at 350 for 50 minutes and it was perfect.  The other thing I did was use mini semisweet bits and mixed them with 1 tablespoon flour before folding into the batter to keep the bits from dropping down to the bottom of the cake.  It's wonderful.  Thank you Prissycat.

Delicious.  I didn't have yellow cake mix so I used chocolate cake mix.  Used vanilla pudding mix (the larger size) and only 1/4 cup of white sugar.  Sprinkled about 1/2 cup chopped pecans on the bottom of the bundt pan before baking.

Moist and nice, though the outer edge was a lighter, more "baked" looking color than the darker inside.  I used Chocolate Fudge instant pudding, for a rich and amazingly chocolate-y flavor, and semisweet chocolate chips.  The guests I had over loved it, and declared it amazing, so I'm happy with it!  Baked at about the right time, according to the instructions.  Next time I'll try fat-free sour cream and another type of pudding.  Delicious though, and perfect for people who like chocolate a LOT.

I make this cake using Devil's food cake mix(Duncan Hines), devil's food instant pudding(3.9 oz), 1 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1/2 cup water and oil, no sugar, and Pam and cocoa not flour for the bundt pan.  I don't dust the cake.  VERY rich, but my friends are adicts.  I'm very popular around Christmas!!

I made this cake last night and it is so yummy!  Very moist!  This will become one of my go to recipes! The only change I made was that I did not have a box of yellow cake mix and instead I used a Devils Food box mix!  Which is probably how I will make it from now on.  Thanks for sharing!

Awesome recipe, the pudding really makes its moist and dense. I highly recommend mixing in some cream of tartar or merengue powder if you are making icing for this cake. Made all the difference. Was a hit at my office party.

This has an old fashioned grandma made it cake taste!   I used sour milk in place of the water and cut the oil in half.  It is very very tasty.

This is a great cake, but I make it a little differently. I substitute 3/4 cup of strong coffee for the water and add 3/4 cups chopped pecans. It is always a hit, and so moist.

I haven't actually made this (yet) but a friend of mine made it for us after our baby was born.  It was delicious!  I am not a huge fan of cake because I always find it dry, but this was extremely moist, even after several days.  She substituted the chocolate/peanut butter swirl chips.

Yummy!  I used a vanilla cake mix (since I didn't have yellow), reduced the oil to half a cup and used 3/4 c. of mini chocolate chips.  It took a little longer to cook - 68 minutes  However, it tasted very good and was so moist.

I made this today for the first time and will be making it again and again!  I chose the lemon pudding/blueberry option using fresh blueberries instead of dried.  I also used only 1/2 cup of oil as many of the other reviews mentioned.  I put in all of the other ingredients as called for, but I think the sour cream could be lessened to 3/4 cup or even 1/2 cup as my cake, cooked at 325 for 55 minutes is still VERY moist. Regardless, it is delicious.  My kids, 9 & 7, and my husband were instant fans!  Oh, I also added about 3 T. of lemon juice to the batter.

Okay, here are my two cents.  This recipe is FANTASTIC, with a few little changes.  I use the sugar-free, fat-free instant white chocolate pudding mix, Duncan Hines yellow cake mix, 1/2 cup of the oil (and I use Enova oil), I use Egg Beaters for the eggs and I use fat-free sour cream.  I save the fat wherever I can, but have made this recipe both ways (fat-full and much less fat) and both are absolutely equally as good.  I also use one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I have NEVER had anyone say anything but how yummy this cake is and I get tons of requests for the recipe.

This is an absolutely delicious cake and so easy to make. A couple things, I used vanilla pudding and the mini chocolate chips. I also needed to bake this for 65 mins, so make sure you pay attention to your baking time and take it out once a toothpick is completely clean.

This cake is very moist!! I used semi-sweet instead of milk chocolate chips and it gave it really good flavor. My fiance LOVES this cake and he's not fond of chocolate...I will make this again thank you!

Hang on - this is under the heading "non-cakemix cakes." The "recipe" calls for a box of instant pudding and a packet of cake mix ... need I say more?

I took this wonderful and easy to make cake to work. The chocoholics I work with devoured the cake in no time. Absolutely delicious and moist! I'd highly recommend trying this one if you're looking for a simple yet tasty cake.

This was the best tasting batter...I just knew it would come out perfect, but I agree with the others that there is too much oil (and I even cut it down to begin with).  I will try 1/3 to 1/2 c next time.  It will be worth trying this again because the flavor and aroma are great.  I went chocolate all the way, of course :).

Super Moist Cake!  I used vanilla pudding when I prepared it.  I also think that I will use mini chocolate chips the next time I make it, because the larger ones mostly settled to the bottom.  I think that these would make excellent muffins/cupcakes.

I am not a big sweets eater, nor am I much of a baker, but we really liked this.  I did reduce the sugar to about 1/4 cup, and the oil to about 1/3 cup, and we really liked the outcome.  Not TOO sweet, but a great flavor and nice and moist.  I also read in the reviews to add a couple of Tbsp flour to the cake mix since the box mixes are a little smaller these days.  I've made it twice and we love it!

Due to the downsizing in cake mix sizes, all cake mixes now come in smaller boxes. In any recipes calling for an 18.25 oz cake mix (the "old size") just add enough flour to bring the cake mix up to 18.25 oz. For example, in this recipe,I had to add 2 oz of flour to the cake mix to bring it up to 18.25 oz as the recipe calls for. Otherwise, I made this exactly as the recipe stated, and it was perfect!

LOVE this cake!  It was a huge hit with company.  The only change I made was using a full cup of chocolate chips instead of a 1/2 cup.  I will def. make this cake again and again- so easy and yum!

This cake was so easy to make, and I was able to easily substitute ingredients for what I had in my cupboard.  I took it to work, everyone was so impressed with how moist it was.  I will definitely make this cake many more times with many different variations!

Awesome!!! for less fat and still moist and delicious cake, reducing oil to a half cup and increase oven to 350 degrees and bake for 50 minutes!!! I make this cake often and with so many variations that others have suggested. i use vanilla,(and add 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa if out of chocolate pudding) lemon, chocolate or cheesecake flavored pudding mix...delicious!!!

This was so incredibly moist and delicious even after sitting overnight in the fridge loosely wrapped in plastic! It was super easy to make and modify! I have since tried this recipe with confetti cake mix and vanilla pudding with great success also!

I just made this today for a women's brunch at my church--I used devil's food cake and made the rest as directed.  I glazed it with 3/4 cup powdered sugar mixed with 2 Tbsp of sour cream--it was a BIG hit!!!  So moist!

This cake was good, but not like a pound cake. Just a plain ol chocolate cake. I expected it to be dense and heavy, but it's not. If you're going for a real pound cake taste, this is not it.

This cake is super easy!  I made this in a 9x13 cake pan, and didn't need to change the bake time at all.  The only thing I will note is that this cake is SO moist, it almost seems undercooked.  Next time I will decrease the oil by 1/4 c and see if that helps

I made this cake for my sons 14th birthday with help from my son & my 9yr old niece. They had a blast doing it! We WILL be making this cake again & again. The cake did need to cook 1hr & 5min, but otherwise no problems. D.Henry, Tucson,AZ

This is a delicious cake!  One thing to note--I copied the recipe exactly (except used canola oil instead of vegetable oil) and it turns out to be more of a chocolate cake than a yellow cake.  So I wouldn't expect it to look like the yellow cake in the picture.  But it tastes delicious!

I wouldn't really consider this to be a pound cake, more like just a yellow cake (I used vanilla pudding rather than chocolate because it's what I had on hand). Actually, I think it tastes like a cake version of chocolate chip cookies. People loved it - who doesn't love cake and chocolate? - and my classmates requested I bring it for the next pot luck. It's quite sweet, and it tasted to me like a cake-mix cake more than others I've made. I made mine as mini-bundts (so cute!) and I think it took about 15 minutes less than the lowest recommended time, so about 35 minutes I think. This is definitely easy and quick, but I think next time I'll just make the poundcake from scratch. There's just nothing like the real thing.

This is a very yummy recipe! I baked it in 2 8" rounds, filled it with whipped ganache, and covered it in chocolate ganache. It was a great combination. I sent it to work with my hubby and everyone loved it.

I absolutely love this recipe, I've made it 3x in 1 wk to share with work, family and friends. I did cut the oil a bit, used fat-free,sugar-free choc.pudding, and low-fat sourcream and,there was no difference in the outcome. I used 1 cp of the mini choc. chips and 2tsps of vanilla,then I cooked it exactly 60min so i didn't have to take out and put in again.  Rave reviews from everyone. I too will try the lemon/blueberry version. Can't wait!

So far, for recipe that called for box mix, this is the best (and trust me, i've done quite a few). But saying that, i do make some changes to the recipe. I put 100ml of oil , 30ml of applesauce, and substitute the water with 230ml of coffee (and i reduce the sugar to 80g coz i don't have sweet tooth).

And the taste is absolutely wonderful, i have the perfect texture (for my taste, haha) and it's not too oily too, unlike some other box mix recipe. 

It takes me 50mnts at 175C and 30mnts at 150C till it's done (i reduce the temperature to prevent cracking).

I got this recipe out of my "All Recipes Dinner Tonight" cookbook.  It has become an instant HIT with our family.  I have made this multiple times for parties, give aways, and fundraisers and every time it is a smash.  It is wonderfully moist and chocolaty!  This is a must try and KEEP.

This was easy to make and the results were great.  Took to a party and others wanted the recipe so they could also make this cake.  The cake was moist and delicious.  If you like chocolate you will love this cake.

Although everyone that ate the cake said it tasted good. I felt that it was too oily. I had to blot the cake with paper towl to get some of the oil off. I used a silicone bunt pan and Pam with flour and it was very greasy. I'm not sure if it was because of the silicone pan, but I gave it the 4 stars because of the oil factor.

This is a very good recipe....I used the chocolate pudding (will try vanilla next time) and milk choc chips but I do not think it resembles a traditional pound cake though.  It made two large loaves as I baked it for over an hour in 2 loaf pans.  I will make it again, it was very good but I am still looking for a good traditional pound cake recipe.  :)

I used milk chocolate pudding and left out the 1/2 cup of sugar.  It was very moist and just the right amount of sweetness without the extra sugar. Everyone loved it, and it was pretty easy.

I can not believe that anyone would have a problem with this recipe! This is hands down the best cake recipe I have ever used.  My favorite variation is using 1/2 cup of choppped hazelnuts and 1/2 cup of chopped dried apricots to the recipes (I substitute vanilla pudding for the chocolate and leave out the chocolate chips).  A very yummy cake!

Incredibly moist, melt in your mouth, rich delicious cake. Everyone wanted the recipe and ate up every last morsel.  I love chocolate, so I increased the chocolate chips to a whole bag (12 oz.) and it was fabulous!

I've made this cake several times and it has been a big hit every time!  It is super moist and really chocolatey, so be prepared for a very rich dessert.  The only problem I have had is that I need to cook it for at least 70 minutes - it might be my oven, but if I don't cook it that long it doesn't get done in the middle.  When it turns out though, it is SUPER YUMMY!!

This cake lives up to everyone of the rave reviews it has received.  I don't care for a real intense chocolate flavor and this was just perfect.  I make this cake in mini bundt pans and it turned out great.

Absolutely wonderful and easy. Made it for a Summer party and plan to make it for Christmas dinner. An excellent dessert for any occasion. Fancy it up with the confectioners sugar. I used the yellow cake mix and it was not too heavy or sweet.

Very good and SOOOO easy!!  I usually use yellow cake mix, chocoalte pudding, and milk chocolate chips in this cake.  I have used all chocolate with semi sweet chips - good, but VERY rich.  Yesterday I made it for DH to take to work today.  I used yellow cake mix, chocolate pudding, half milk chocolate chips, and half semi sweet.  I only had 1/2 cup of sour cream on hand, so I used that and 1/2 cup of whipped cream cheese.  He said it was eaten in minutes and was the best version I've made.  I will make another this weekend to verify.  ha ha!

Made it for my coworkers and they raved for a whole week (while consuming it within a few hours). Needs A LOT more chocolate chips than 1/2 c. I used 1 c. and it wasn't enough. Also, you probably could drop the 1/2 c. white sugar. It's sweet enough without it.

This cake is delicious even with a few mods.  I did not add the 1/2 c. of white sugar.  I increased the amount of water to 1c. and decreased the oil to 1/2 c.  

With these changes, the cake came out VERY moist and delicious!!!  Will definitely do this one again.

I made this cake only with one change, i decreased the oil just a bit, more than half a cup but less than 3/4. The chocolate chips melted in with the cake but some were still solid. Either way the cake was great! I melted some milk chocolate chips (with a little evaporated milk) to drizzle over the top, as well as some peanut butter chips with a tablespoon of peanut butter mixed in for real peanut butter flavor. My husband and sister in law loved it! I will be making this cake again today with the lemon/blueberry change and a lemon glaze icing!

This is a great recipe! It comes out so moist.  I used semi sweet chocolate chips, and I topped the cake with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze recipe that is on here. Would definitely make this again!

This cake is delicious. Made it yesterday for the first time. The only ingredients I changed was that I used devils food cake mix instead of yellow. Also it states to bake at 325 for 50-60 min. I checked mine after 50 mins and it was still wet in the middle. I changed the temp to 350 and baked for additional 15 mins. It was perfect. Will make this many many more times.  We didn't even use any frosting or powdered sugar. It doesn't need it.

I made this recipe several times using chocolate and yellow cake mixes. I used vanilla pudding for both - that's what I had.  The first time I made it as per the recipe and found it to have a greasy taste and feel.  On the 2nd try, I reduced the oil to 1/3 cup (as it states on the box) and increased the water to make up the difference in liquid.  Still very moist and delicious without the greasy taste and feel.  Plus a savings of almost 100 grams of fat per cake!

Holy goodness!! What a GREAT cake! First time, I made it with chocolate cake mix and vanilla pudding. Second time, I used chocolate cake AND chocolate pudding...and made a couple of mini bundts and cupcakes!! VERY GOOD!! Both times my cake turned out wonderful-no issues!! And I love how you can substitute this for that. Thanks for the recipe!!

I just made this for a party and it turned out great! Although it's not a pound cake, it is a delicious, moist, chocolate cake. I used canola oil instead of vegetable and only a 1/2 c. sour cream because that's what I had on hand. I used the recipe for Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze on this site and it complimented it really nicely. I decorated the plate with fresh raspberries and powerdered sugar. It looked great and tasted even better!

Everyone always loves this cake when I make it. They also think that I spend hours making it...if they only knew. LOL! I did follow others advice and placed the chocolate chips on top of the cake  last vs. folding them in to prevent them from sinking to the bottom.

This cake is AMAZING!!!!  I made it for my wedding rehearsal dinner and there was only a couple pieces left to take home.  I have made it on several other occasions and it has always been devoured.  I always make the recipe for "Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze" on this website and it really compliments the cake nicely.  I definately give that cake/glaze combo 5 + stars!!!

Easy and yummy - I've made it with chocolate and vanilla pudding - both are just as good.  I don't add a glaze, I just give it a dusting of powdered sugar and it's perfect!

I used vanilla pudding and added 1.5 ounces of melted semi-sweet chocolate to half the mixture. By swirling the two in a bundt pan, I created a marbled cake.  Very moist.  Non-chocolate lovers raved.

A very good and moist cake.  I added 1 tbsp. cocoa for a more chocolate flavor.  From reading the reviews I baked the cake for an hour at 330 degrees.  I also used a cream cheese drizzle instead of chocolate.  The cake came out so moist it was hard to cut without messing the cake up.  I will make this again!

Not impressed by this one.  Delivers on the "easy" part of the name, so I'm giving this 3 stars, but I didn't care for the taste or texture.  There are so many other good dessert recipes out there that I wouldn't bother making this one again.  If you want to jazz up a yellow cake mix, try the Honey Bun Cake recipe on this site instead.

The cake was good, but definitely is not a traditional pound cake.  It was more like a boxed cake.  The cake was extremely moist and a bit gooey even after an hour baking at 335 degrees.

This was fantastic! It was so moist. I did have to increase the cook time by about 10 minutes but everything else was perfect. I would not cut down the oil. The only thing I would advise against is using the Williams Sonoma Castle Bundt Pan. It was a nightmare to clean.

If I were rating this cake for taste alone, I would easily give it five stars.  The recipe, however, doesn't rate so high.  It was very easy, but after returning it to the oven three times, it was still so moist that it stuck to the bundt pan and looked terrible.  I was serving it to guests, so I warmed a can of frosting and drizzled about half of that over it to camouflage the missing chunks.  It tasted wonderful, but next time I will decrease the oil as suggested by another reviewer.  I think if it were less moist, I would have had better results.  I also look forward to trying the lemon/blueberry version someone suggested!

This recipe is my standby favorite - I get SO many compliments on it.  I change it in a few ways - I use a chocolate devil's food cake mix, and eliminate the sugar completely.  It's outstanding if you are a chocolate lover - very rich and moist.  Thanks so much for this recipe - I have a lot of happy friends that use it as well.

This recipe was really incredibly easy. I brought the cake to my office to share with co-workers and they all loved it! The cake was completely gone in about the same amount of time it took to make it!

Although this got really good reviews, it didn't really work for us.  It seemed too oily or moist.  I ended up cooking it for about 80 minutes and it was still like that.  I checked and I don't think I did anything wrong so I'm not really sure what my wasn't good.  :-(

I opted for vanilla pudding for some visual contrast.  I had no leftovers and the prep was easier than falling in love.

Did I do something wrong? I thought this is a easy recipe using a cake mix. I was expecting something better after reading all the reviews about this cake. I used 2 pound cake pans instead of a bundt pan but bottom of the pan was so moist (wet) and oily it didn't hold the shape when I took it out of the pan. Only part which was good was the crispy top of the cake...

It was very easy to prepare.  My 5-year-old did most of the prep work with some supervision. We used a butter recipe cake mix and semi-sweet chocolate chips b/c that's all I had on hand and it turned out great.  It was very moist!

I claim this recipe as my "signature" at parties and family functions. Everyone requests that I make it for special occasions. I use the substitute egg products (i.e. EggBeaters) in place of the real eggs for a reduced fat version and it makes the cake even more moist. If you love chocolate, you'll love this cake.

Hmmmm...did I do something wrong? I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using the mini chips (as suggested).  I guess I wouldn't go so far as to say it was awful, I think maybe kids would like it, but I found it really kind of oily and spongy for my tastes, not at all like a pound cake.  I also used a sculpted bundt pan from williams-sonoma, which in retrospect was not a good idea, because the cake didn't hold very well.
But the crust part that formed at the top was pretty tasty, so it wasn't a complete loss.

This cake was easy to make and it tastes great, just be sure it'll be eaten within a day or so of baking. After that, it takes on a peculiar taste. I used regular size semi-sweet chocolate chips and all the chips sunk to the bottom of the pan, which did cause it to break up slightly when removing it from the pan. Next time I will use mini chips as others suggested. It did take slightly longer than indicated, about 65 minutes, even using a 10" bundt pan.

This wasn't very flavorful.  I prefer the "Easy Dump Cake" recipe from this site over this one.  It has the same ingredients as this one, just different amounts which makes it a richer cake.

This is soooo good!!! I only used three eggs and the white from the fourth one, substituted 1 cup of 2% yogurt for the sour cream and it came out beautifully. the only problem is that the chocolate chips struck to the pan (but no problem as i ate those separately. Beautiful, it melts in your mouth.

I didn't really like this reciepe.  The chocolate chips all settled to the bottom and the poundcake itself I thought was too airy.  Kinda like it wasn't "pound" cake-y enough.  I wont make again.

There are several older ladies in our country "neighborhood" who have lived here longer than I have been alive so I was intimidated when I took this to a get together. We overheard several people say how good it was and two of the older ladies even asked me for the recipe! I did substitute vanilla pudding and also subbed a white chocolate ganache made with Wilton Baking Melts and cream for the topping. VERY moist, the ladies were asking me what is in it to make it so moist. Made a beautiful presentation in my specialty bundt pan too. Thank you!

I will only make the cake for company, or else my hubby and I will eat it all ourselves!  I did 1/2 cup of oil and 3/4 cup of water.  It just seemed so wrong to use that much oil!  The mini chocolate chips were perfect.  This is a must try!

I fixed this cake the night before Thanksgiving and my husband whom doesn't like chocolate loved it! He ate about a third of it that night. It was a very easy cake to make and had a very good flavor. I used mini chocolate chips and it turned out great. I chilled mine because I prefer cool cakes. This recipe is a keeper.

This is a very wonderfully simple cake recipe.  I like that it involves using staples that I always have on hand.  I used a Devils Food cake mix and chocolate pudding.  The only other things I did differently was added a teaspoon of vanilla and I substituted 3/4 cup of fresh brewed dark coffee for the water.  I did not add chocolate chips, but if I did it would have been about 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips mixed with a teaspoon of flour to coat them.  Otherwise, I used all other ingredients as listed.  I baked at 350 degrees for about 50 minutes in a bundt pan.  I had no problems whatsoever, and it turned out beautiful and chocolatey!  I dusted with powdered sugar when it cooled.

I modified this recipe to make a lemon cake and loved it!  Lemon box cake mix was only 16 oz, so I added 1/4 cup flour.  Substituted two 6 oz containers lemon yoplait yogurt for the sour cream.  Added a little lemon zest and lemon extract too.  Cooking time for mine was longer than this recipe states.  Took approximately 80 minutes.  Moist, delicious, beautiful lemony cake!  I look forward to trying other flavors with this as a base recipe!

Man this cake is good. Used it for a car-shaped cake as well as the top of my son's first birthday car cake. The cake itself is not as dense and I would have liked -- was difficult to carve even when frozen. But the taste is phenomenal.

This one turns out great every time. At times I substitute coconut oil for veg oil. This does tend to take a bit longer to cook- I find 60-70 minutes for my oven. It's definitely a crowd pleaser, and makes enough for us to eat the extras for a midnight snack (or breakfast the next day!) ;)

This was the most moist cake I have eaten in a long time. It is very easy and you can't go wrong with it. Everyone loved it on Thanksgiving and everyone I worked with. Wouldn't change a thing. I did sprinkle some powder sugar and mini choc chips over the top just for decor., but taste and moistness wise it didn't need anything.

I love this recipe and so does my chocoholic husband. It may sounds crazy but I use chocolate cake mix instead of the yellow. I wanted an intense chocolate flavor and got it! I make it for holidays and picnics and there are never any leftovers, everyone loves it!

I think that the problems most people are having with this recipe is the cook temp and time.  I've never baked a cake at 325, so I upped the temp to 350 and baked for 55 minutes and it turned out perfectly!  I also increased the amount of chocolate chips to 1 cup and used vanilla instant pudding.  Delicious!

This is a seriously easy cake to make. Made as directed but didn't have milk chocolate chips, so I used what I had, semi-sweet. Can't imagine that much of a change in taste. I thought it was good, but not exceptional. Very moist, but, probably won't made again.

Delicious and very moist! I omitted the sugar completely.....saw no reason what so ever to add extra sugar to a box mix. Used a sugar free/fat free chocolate pudding mix, low fat sour cream, 1c water and 1/3 canola oil, and kept it at 4 eggs. Made in a bundt pan and everyone really complimented on this easy dessert. Thanks!

Hands down, the best recipe i have come across!!! I have been preparing this recipe for my family for about three years now and at every birthday party they look forward to it. I have even used this recipe in special cake molds and it turns out fantastic. Super moist!! I also have made a few variations with white chocolate pudding mix and white choc chips, but the original is my family's favorite

I took the advice of others and decreased the oil to 1/2 cup, increased the temp to 350 degrees, and took it out at 55 min when the toothpick came out clean.  Unfortunately, after it cooled and I cut it, it was still not done.  It was more like a brownie consistency.  It may have been because I used a pound cake mix instead of regular mix, but I would think it shouldn't matter too much. Tasted really nice, but cook time may need to be extended??

Easy and well liked by my family.  It probably would be just as good with much less oil, but I made the recipe as written except I used about a cup of semi sweet chips.  Great cake mix recipe!

This cake is truly delicious!!
Don't skimp and use low fat or fat free sour cream, or use less oil---afterall, it IS a pound cake!
Whenever I've made this for events there are rave reviews to follow!  I use a full cup of chocolate chips (half milk chocolate and half semi-sweet).  I drizzle melted white chocolate over the top and then dust with powdered sugar.  Truly a wonderful, moist, delicious cake!!

This cake IS moist and tastes quite good, but I had a lot of bubbles in my cake so the texture looks weird. The flavour of the pudding doesn't really stand out. My cake looks like chocolate cake, but it tastes like yellow cake. I didn't use the extra sugar and it was sweet enough for me. I also reduced the oil to 1/2 a cup and increased the water a bit more due to other reviewers complaining about the oiliness. I'd use the recipe again, but maybe tweak it a bit more next time.

Thsi is one of the best cakes I have ever had.  It was extremely moist--used Frenc Vanilla pudding.  Also, made into cupcakes and let the pans sit for a minuteor so and the chps fell to the bottom and made a choc crust.

This cake was very rich and moist.  I used vanilla pudding instead of chocolate and I screwed up and poured half a bag of chocolate chips in before I realized it called for a small amount.  I will definitely make again, but I think I might make it without the chocolate chips.

i followed the recipe to the tee except added a little more chocolate chip.  It was very good but it is more of a cake than a pound cake.  This is a keeper.  Thanks, t's mom

This is such a great cake! I could never write enough wonderful things about it!!! I served it with vanilla ice cream in order to cut the chocolate taste rather than using vanilla pudding. The ice cream and cake were all gone! Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!!!

Very very good recipe. I did listen to some of the comments and it turn out perfect. I did use chocolate fudge cake with chocolate  pudding. I use a half of cup of oil instead of 3/4 of a cup. and a cup of jumbo chocolate chips instead of a half of a cup. I also add some finely chopped walnuts in it and topped it with a homemade Ganache made with semi sweet chocolate chips. It was amazing. Like some one said in the comments very versatile recipe. Oh and I baked it at 325 degrees and cooked it for 10 mins more.

I use this recipe all the time and have for years. The possibilities are endless use any cake and pudding flavor combo. Can be baked in round cake pans with increased baking time. This makes a dense moist cake I often use when making carved cake shapes and covering with fondant.

Love this cake!  Have made it Many times & my favorite is still the yellow cake mix with chocolate pudding.  I make the recipe exactly as written But I set my oven at 335 & bake for 60 min.  I have tried all the suggestions about the  chocolate chips But I have found the secret !  I prefer reg size chips, & lots of them....SO I fold/mix in the chips After pouring batter into bundt pan! It Works!!  I also prepare bundt pan with butter even tho it’s a “no stick” pan??

I've made this twice now and didn't change a thing.My sister put the first one in the freezer to use for Christmas in 2017.We learned that it freezes well and is so moist and delicious when thawed and served.

I also made a lemon using a lemon cake mix,instant lemon pudding,zest of one lemon and 1 teaspoon lemon extract and followed all other directions and ingredients.
It disappeared very quickly.
I didn't use the powdered sugar or any type of frosting as I felt they looked great as they were.
Hope you enjoy this recipe as much as I did.
It's a keeper at my house!!!

Base recipe is great. Second time I made, I used base recipe but replaced 1/2 cup of the water w/ 1/4 cup creme de cassis liqueur and 1/4 cup blue curaçao liqueur (then just 1/4 cup water).  I used 1/2 cup oil as suggested by another reviewer and used dark chocolate chips.  I melted dark chocolate chips for glaze and ringed the cake with piped whipped heavy cream (to which I added a tablespoon of sugar).  Definitely company worthy!  Everyone raved and wanted the recipe.

To RJJOHNSON, here is a tip my mom taught me years ago.  Put your chocolate chips in a bag with a little flour and shake them to coat before adding them to your cake batter. They will not sink to the bottom of your cakes anymore.

Best cake ever!  I doubled the recipe and used 1 small instant cheesecake pudding and I large instant vanilla pudding.  Didn't use the chocolate chips.  Made it for school and my kids begged me not to take it after the small taste I gave them. Will make it again and very soon!!!

I have made this recipe for many years. It was passed to me from my mother who had also made it for many years. This recipe is a classic. Each time I make it people want me to share the recipe with them. It is simple and delicious. Many of the pictures I'm seeing on here have people adding glaze, berries, and icing. I have over the years added glaze and icing but In my opinion, this recipe is best with no topping at all. I love it when it is warm out of the oven with a cup of coffee.

This is the moistest bundt cake ever, my family loved it.  I will be making it over and over again. I did use chocolate glaze on top, but powdered sugar would be great to. Tastes almost like a gourmet brownie.

This cake recipe is a keeper!  You have endless variations on the pudding and substitution for the choc chips.  It is also very easy to make and always really moist.  I'd like to add a couple of tips I use:  a heavier bundt pan will make it easier to remove.  I don't measure the sour cream I just buy the 8 oz size and dump it all in - so much easier.  I also increase the temp to 350 as I find 325 seems to take much longer.  
My favorites:  Lemon pudding with frozen blueberries (coat the blueberries in flour to keep them from sinking to bottom), white chocolate pudding with choc chip minis, choc fudge pudding with reeses pieces (yummy)!  Endless possibilities.

This cake recipe is the best! My son loves chocolate and requests this often so I have made it just as written many time since finding the recipe on this site. We love the moist cake and would give it more stars if possible.

good, not fantastic. Made for daughter's birthday. Seemed a little oily-would substitute applesauce next time, and would save some calories. Not really pound cake or cake, in the middle. Doesnt need any frosting.

Perfect EVERYTIME ! ( I use mini chocolate chips and stir them in just as I poured into bunt pan to keep them from all sinking to the bottom/top)

I used a devil's food cake mix, fat-free white chocolate pudding mix, mini semisweet chocolate chips, 1/2C oil, and a capful of almond extract. I baked the cake at 335 for 65 minutes, let it cool for 10 minutes before removing from the bundt pan, and it turned out wonderfully moist and delicious. I also microwaved some extra vanilla icing and used that as a drizzle. Will definitely make this again. Very good cake!

I made this yesterday. I did add a little less sugar, maybe more like 1/3 cup, and I only had semi-sweet morsels on hand, but otherwise, I followed the recipe. Then I topped it with the satiny chocolate glaze, as suggested by another reviewer. We quite enjoyed this and it was very simple and pretty. One reviewer said this cake was too sweet, one said too moist...I didn't think either of those applied, so maybe its a question of preference. I checked mine at 50 minutes and decided it needed a little more time. 55 minutes seemed to be just right. I would make this again and serve it proudly! Thanks for the recipe :-)

Moist and yummy.  Cut oil to 1/2 cup (used coconut oil), used mini choc chips in batter and vanilla pudding,  topped cooled cake with a chocolate icing and sprinkled more mini choc chips on top.  The choc chips did sink in my batter.  If I could remedy this problem, then I would actually prefer double the mini chips in the batter next time.

I am not one to bake cakes with cake mix but this recipe I couldn't resist. My DH wanted something sweet and I needed to use up some cake mixes that I had up in the cupboard (I always keep one or two on hand in case to make cup cakes etc) Anyway I also had some choc chips and the other ingredients on hand so I decided to make this cake. Boy I am glad I did... the cake came out perfect. The only thing I did different was to use 1/2 cup applesauce with 1/4 cup canola oil instead of 3/4 veg oil and added some vanilla extract and did not add the sugar. I thought between the cake mix and choc instant pudding mix there would be plently of sugar.... I was right... I also had some milk choc frosting in can on hand so I frosted part of the cake with this while it was still warm... so it kinda looked like a glaze. This cake is a keeper.... it is delicious and so moist... and really good the next day too... doesn't even taste like a mix cake.... also I used store brand (shoprite) yellow cake mix and store brand choc instant pudding(walmart). and the cake is plenty sweet!I also baked this in a bundt pan. Thanx Prissycat for the easy recipe!

I made this for supper club Friday night.  It went over very well.  I used a paper towel to line my Bundt pan with vegetable shortening.  I used pistachio pudding mix instead of chocolate.  I only used 1/2 cup of canola oil (that's all I had on hand).  I mixed the ingredient without the eggs, then added them one at a a time.  Then folded in Ghirardelli chocolate chips.  I baked for a full hour.

I bought a bundt pan to make this cake.  I think I baked it way too long, but it STILL turned out fantastic!  This I used vanilla pudding, and a chocolate glaze, and received it was delicious!

This was very moist and was good as a fondue dipper and as a base for a strawberry shortcake type of dessert, but I don't think I would eat it just by itself.

Mine came out extremely moist.  I think I'll leave out a little oil next time, otherwise it was delicious.

This cake has a nice taste to it. And I will make it again but use less water and oil. I had to pat with paper towels to get some of the oil off and still after that I had oil on my hands heavy. Thank you for the recipe.  God Bless You.

This is very good and so easy to make.  I wasn't sure what went wrong but when I went to invert the pan the cake fell out and kind of fell apart.  I had greased and floured the pan as the recipe stated.  Maybe next time I will let the cake cool longer.

I made this cake for my mother's visit. It was so moist and yummy, we couldn't wait for it to cool before digging in. Its taste belies the recipes' simplicity. I will definately make this again!!
