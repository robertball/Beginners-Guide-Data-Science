Does it really mean 1 cup of oil AND 1 cup of margarine...? 
I used both in the spirit of following a recipe, but when I took the dough out of the fridge, it was really greasy and filled with pools of oil. I drained as much as I could by turning it upside down over another bowl, and just wrapped each ball of dough in a paper towel before putting it on the cookie sheet and didn't grease the sheet. Aside from the oil mayhem (worked wonders for my cuticles though) (just kidding), the cookies turned out great! They were light and crispy and chewy all in one, and not at all too sweet, and entirely adorable. (:

My daughter and I made these a couple of days ago and thought they were fun to make and delicious. Using the 36 serving batch, I substituted the 1cup margarine with 1 cup butter and only used 1/2 cup of oil instead of the 1 cup the recipe asked for. We did not need to refrigerate the dough either. Will make again in the future.

great recipe!  the only reason it got 4 stars is because it was WAY too oily.  i have made this recipe twice now, and the second time i only used 1/2 c. margerine and 1/2 cup oil and they turned out PERFECT!  great tasting and fun looking cookies!

These taste fantastic, crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. They look beautiful too. I added a drop of red food coloring to the center of the "flower" for a splash of color. The only change I made was to the ingredients was to use 2/3 cup butter in place of the margarine, because it was all I had on hand.

Oh what fun... I just love the flower design. I have been making this cookie for many years. AKA "Amish Sugar Cookies". Because the dough is so soft though, I found if I use 4 3/4 cups of flour, the dough is a bit easier to handle and refrigeration isn't necessary. I always used to flatten the cookies with a fork, in the old, boring, crisscross pattern used for peanut butter cookies. Using the thread spool just makes a wonderful cookie look even better. And since they say "we eat first with our eyes" maybe the flower design makes them taste even better too... LOL Thank you, Jacquie, for the great idea.

I reduced the oil to 1/2 cup and found these to still be very oily.  Overall a good cookie, but my regular rolled sugar cookie recipe is tastier, so to change it up, I think I'll use that recipe and press them with a spool. Sorry.

I tried this recipe because I had limited resouces in the kitchen and no butter to make my usual sugar cookies.  I was pleasantly suprised by both the taste and delicate texture of these cookies.  Also the spool print did make a nice addition to the look of cookie.

I should have listened to my instincts.  This recipe was too oily.  I would suggest using a solid such as butter, margarine, or crisco in place of the oil; or at least cut back on the oil.  The flavor is good.  Thank you Jacquie Whitney for sharing.

these are awesome cookies! a new favorite to make with my little granddaughter. i've been saving up empty spools so that i can make these, make gift plates of them, attach the recipe and a spool to go with it. it's a really lovely cookie and a fun process to make them.

These really have a fantastic flavour and are super-easy to make. Unlike other reviewers, I did not find the dough overly oily. However I did make the mistake of following one reviewer's advice and adding more flour, because I didn't have time to chill the dough. The cookies turned out cakier than I think they would otherwise have, and they were not as pretty because the edges cracked. Followed exactly, I am sure I would have had the same pretty cookies as in the picture. I should also have looked for a different spool. The one I used made it look like my cookies had the symbol for radioactivity on them! Ha!

Great recipe, I did modify it a bit. I used butter instead of margerine and it tasted great.

Maybe it was just my carelessness, but i thought it was way too oily. I used this recipe for a pie crust, and I forgot to omit the baking powder/soda, so it turned out looking like a big, yummy pancake! It tasted wonderful though...!

Such a fun recipe and so easy too!  As far as using margarine and oil is concerned, this recipe is almost identical to the "Amish Sugar Cookie" recipe also on this site which I have been making for years and love.  If you want, the oil can be subbed for applesauce, but it does make it cakier and I am not sure the pattern will be as distinct.  Making this tocay, I did reduce the oil to a 1/2 cup and the flour to 4 cups and had no trouble.  It was still a little oily on my hands, but honestly it didn't taste oily at all.  I love this and I will definitely make it again  :)

Having no real reason to bake during the Holidays anymore, because I live alone, I decided to cheer myself up and putter in the kitchen Xmas Eve. Couldn't find my usual recipe so I dropped in here for a 'second best'. Well, there is nothing 'second best' about this cookie!

First, it was an easy recipe to follow. Second, every ingredient can be found in most kitchens. Third, instead of getting fancy with the spool idea, I just lightly flatten each ball with the bottom of my measuring cup. Since I was going to ice them with my 'secret' frosting, I didn't even bother to coat the press with sugar as was called for. I did watch carefully as they baked because I have an oven that thinks on its own and I didn't want to make them too dry or crisp. Once they were cooled and iced, I ate the best sugar cookie I've ever eaten. Even without the icing, they are moist, delicate with just a hint of sweet sugar. Hmmm, hmmm, GOOD!

Delicious!!! Very simple to make. I made the mistake of not reading the entire recipe before making them, and didn't have time to chill the dough like it said. They were still really good, but for some reason, they tasted better the next day. My friends were amazed that I made them with a spool! Oh, you really want to dip the spool in powdered suger between each press. I dipped it direct in the bag. Real easy.

These are by far the best sugar cookies I've ever eaten, and the first I've ever made.  They had just the right sweetness and texture.  I did try to make shapes, not knowing they would spread so much, but they still tasted good! Thanks!!

My family went nuts for these! The perfect weight and texture, fluffy and sweet. The design was cute as can be. I am making them as Christmas gifts in painted flower pots this year. I, too, added another 3/4- 1 cup of flour and didn't have to chill dough! Perfection! Thanks!

I have been looking for a nice, sweet (but not too sweet), melt in your mouth sugar cookie for years.  My boyfriend loves sugar cookies, but I could never find just the right one until now.  This is the perfect sugar cookie, even if you over bake it just a little, the cookie is crisp, but not hard.  It still melts in your mouth.  The only thing I changed was I used almond extract instead of vanilla. I didn't bake all the dough.  I made the rest into balls and stored them in the fridge so my boyfriend can have fresh cookies throughout the week.  Love these cookies.  These will definitely be added to the family cookbook.

Easy, not too sweet and fool-proof to make.  The texture was great at an 8 minute bake, but bear in mind, every oven is different. Almond flavoring was substituted for the vanilla. I rolled them in regular white sugar as the recipe calls for as well as red and green sugars (separately).  I'm sure one could add food coloring to the dough for variation.  I think one could make these year round for various holidays or even for every day.

This tastes really good! I don't know how on Earth you can't go wrong with a simple sugar cookie, let alone this recipe, the best one ever! 

Notes:

 Add 1 or 2 Tablespoons of flour for doughier cookies.

 Add peanut oil mixed with canola oil instead of vegetable oil for a hint of tasty.

 Butter is OK!

 If your sugar mixture is lumpy, wash your hands and cream it with your hands.

Thank you for a good (no, amazing is the word) recipe! This is the only recipe you will ever need. Even for regular sugar cookies just don't do the flower design. This is a 100 star recipe!

EXCELLENT! This recipe has been passed down in our family for over 70 years (butter in place of margerine). Shame on reviewers who changed it, then rated it low. If you don't follow the recipe, submit your own. Not chilling makes it more difficult to work with, but results are the same. My Grandmother added a dried cherry or nut meat to the center to dress it up. She'd have LOVED the spool idea, and I'm going to try that. Cute. Flavor is FANTASTIC with no dress up.

Good buttery cookie.  I don't think the spool is necessary, but adds a fun little twist.  Of course, you'd have to flatten it with something else instead.

I've made these cookies many times and I'm famous for them!  They are really the most delicious cookies I have ever made and my friends are begging for my secret recipe!
The only change I make is to only dip the balls of dough into the sugar instead of rolling them. Otherwise, they are actually too sugary, if that is even possible.

I have been making these cookies for over 35 years they are Delicious they are NOT greasy I do use real butter not margerine and 41/2 cups flour 2 teaspoons vanilla sometimes 1 t vanilla and 1 t almond extract  bake just until edges begin to brown they are pure heaven they do not have POOLS of oil as  one person stated and  Ihave never met anyone who dod not truly  enjoy them If you are going to go thru the trouble of making real sugar cookies then go all the way or stick to some crackers

Overall great taste but they are very greasy so I recommend less oil. Also, they didn't rise much in the oven so they were very thin. But still, the taste is great

This is now going to be a family favorite.  The design from using the spool makes for attractive cookies, but the recipe itself is the winner.  The cookies are light and tasty.  I rolled them in plenty of sugar before pressing in the spool.  I barely had enough for the plates of Christmas cookies that we distributed.  Thanks for this superstar recipe.

I make this same cookie every holiday.  Everyone at my business loves it.  I do six batches.  4 1/2 cups flour. Gold Medal or King Arthur, Land of Lakes, Wesson vegetable or a Canola.  I use parchment paper.  It's not oily just take your time following the steps.  Use a big bowl and good ingredients.  I use a glass bud vase with a star on the bottom, but I have to try the spool.

They were fun to decorate, but not to eat. Texture is like the picture.

I made this, they weren't the worst sugar cookies ever, but they sort of tasted like play-do even after i changed the recipe from one cup of sugar to two cups of sugar. i would only recommend these if you are going to use a very sweet topping on them.

A little oily, but the cookies turned out good. I will probably use about half the oil next time, but they were okay.

I was hired to make sugar cookies for a local company's party, I used real butter instead of margarine, they were a HUGE HIT! I made them since then and forgot to leave out the salt when I used salted butter, they were still tasty, and SO easy! For Easter I rolled them in pastel colored sugars, WONDERFUL!

following the advice of the comments, i reduced the butter and oil to 1/2c. each i found the cookie to be unreasonably crummy and dry so i added the rest of the butter and oil. still pretty dry so i added just a splash of oil more. i found it really didn't need to be refrigerated but did so for a hour or two anyway. i made them standard cookie size because my family likes medium to large cookies better but then i had to tag on another 2-4 min. and the design did not show up as well on the larger cookies. i think next time i will follow the instructions exactly and maybe add more oil or butter so i wont get as dry a cookie.

Taste is great. But had some trouble with the spool impression as sometimes it stuck inside. But great alternative to rolling out and cookie cutting!
