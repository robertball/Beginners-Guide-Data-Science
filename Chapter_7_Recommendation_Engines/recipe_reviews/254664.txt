Sprinkling the seasoning on top wasn't such a good idea. Cause I can't do it evenly so on some parts of the chicken it'd be flavorless & others I would get a mouthful of seasoning. I'd recommend mixing the seasoning into the sauce before you put it into the crockpot. That way it's evenly spread out.

This was amazing!! I didn't have time to use crockpot so I followed all the steps and then baked in oven at 350 for about 45 minutes then added spices & cheese and baked for additional 15 minutes.  I have a very picky family and we rarely ever eat leftovers.  This recipe made enough for all of us to have a leftover for lunch the next day and surprisingly EVERYONE ate it all.  Will make again! Thank you for sharing the recipe!!

For the amount of time it took, I'd rather go with Chef John's recipe on this site. It takes about the same amount of time, and tastes much better. I appreciate the recipe but I won't be making it again.

Crockpot recipes are supposed to be easy and save time. You might as well just skip the crockpot and do this in the oven. It takes less time.

Chicken was very moist and it took very little time to prepare. I served it over noodles along with spinach salad. Huge hit!

The only thing I changed is the number of eggs. Three eggs seemed like too many so I used two, and I still had some leftovers after dredging.

I made it in the oven in a tightly covered baking pan and slow cooker it at 240Â° for 4 hours.  It was too much for my crock pot.

This recipe has recently become one of my go-to dishes; I've made it twice in the last ten days! The first time I used canned marinara, and the second I made fresh marinara for the sauce (recipe also found on AllRecipes). I also used whatever cheese I had on hand-- mozzarella the first time, asiago the second. Both were great. With some roasted broccoli, garlic bread, and a bottle of cab, this meal was wonderful.

I followed the directions fully (with the exception of putting my slow cooker on high because it tends to run low, and for closer to three and a half hours because I had to run some last-minute errands), and the chicken didn't even cook all the way through.

While it was good for the first couple bites before I realized it was still uncooked in the middle, this definitely isn't something I'll be attempting again.

This was a good recipe. I used fresh garlic and seasoned the chicken directly, then added the sauce. It was a little heavy with oregano, so I'll reduce it next time. We had this with fettuccini.

Followed the recipe but skipped the crock pot entirely. Baked at 375 for  one hour. ( I had other things in the oven, so turned it up a bit. ) Turned out great!

This is very tasty and we enjoyed it. I followed one of the other reviewers' suggestion to mix the spices into the marinara sauce. My only complaint was that when I took the breasts out of the slow cooker, the breaded coating fell off the  entire side of 2 or 3 of the chicken breasts. I think I''ll repeat it but cook it in baking dish in oven instead.

This was a big hit in our family! I followed the recipe except I didnât dip chicken in the flour first. I made homemade sauce. It was delicious but not as simple as normal crockpot recipes.

wow thats a lot of calories.  my dad makes chicken parm all the time but we bake it in the oven-- it's soooo delicious and i bet its a tad bit healthier.  i havent tried this method in the slow cooker yet, but to me, it seems like there are better things you can do in a slow cooker.
