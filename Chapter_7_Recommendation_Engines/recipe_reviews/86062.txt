Just like the Rémoulade(Note Spelling)Sauce at Galatoire's. Thanks for the memories. By the way because of hurricane Katrina, Galatoire's has moved its operation to Baton Rouge and will open there soon.

Neither Hubs nor I much cared for this with the shrimp.  We found it too tangy from the vinegar and just "too much" for the delicately flavored shrimp. However, inspiration struck me and it occurred to me that because of its zingy flavor and tanginess it just might be good with raw vegetables.  Just as I thought, I liked it a lot better.  Hubs gave it a whirl and agreed.  So for us anyway, this sauce was much better suited as a dip for raw vegetables than as a sauce for shrimp.

I loved this remoulade!  All others I've had in the past have been smooth, so I appreciated the thicker texture of this sauce.  It really clings to the shrimp, and the flavors blend really well.  The parsley is my favorite part of it because it gives a wonderful freshness.  I would serve this for a true N'Awlins' dinner party.  Thanks for a terrific recipe!

This version is close except for a few things: it is missing 2 tbsp. of prepared horseradish and a few amount differences – ¼ cup red wine vinegar, ½ cup salad oil, 2 tbsp. Spanish hot paprika, ½ cup curly (not flat) parsley and 4 dozen (4 lbs. of 15 count per pound) boiled (fresh is best) shrimp.

I'm not sure why this hasn't gotten 5 stars all around. It tastes just like Galatoire's remoulade! I'm born & raised in the Greater New Orleans area so I've eaten my fair share of remoulades. It's not mayo based so it's supposed to have that acidic bite from the vinegar. I added a dollop of horseradish and a little garlic, but the recipe is just fine on its own!

Maybe it is just a matter of personal taste, but (although I liked the fresh ingredients)I felt the mustard flavor overwhelmed the shrimp.  I think the tomato cocktail type sauces are a much better compliment to the mild flavor shrimp flavor.

I made this and had a lady friend over for lunch.  She thought I was some kind of genius!  I had left over for my parents and they said they couldn't even finish it all.  But everyone loved it.  I had a bunch of sauce left over that I wish I could have used for something.

Very yummy
I didn’t have red wine vinegar so I used 1/2 white vinegar 1/2 red wine 
My processor doesn’t allow me to stream in the oil so I would use the blender next time.
This was for a crowd that doesn’t like spicy so it was perfect. If you like spicy I’d recommend adding something hot.
I would make this again!
