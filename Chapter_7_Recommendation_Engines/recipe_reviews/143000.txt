This was a pretty good recipe. The crust was quite hard to cut through, though. And definitely use the cookie sheet underneath, because something leaked out during the baking time. But overall, we enjoyed the dessert.

I love this recipe.  I started using it a few years ago and I always get great comments on it.  The only thing I change is more vanilla in the crust.  I like sweet crust.

this is a great base recipe to play with and tweak.  I love adding fresh lightly sweetened cranberries to the apples, and making small amount of extra dry/extra sweet crust and crumble over top. Yum.

I decided to make this cake using about 5 cups of pears instead of the apples. My 10-year-old helped prepare (and eat) it! It was easy and turned out great! I did increase the sugar in the cream cheese mixture to 1/2 cup and added 10 min. to the bake time until the center of the pears was set!

I really loved this recipe for its simplicity and overall taste.  I added sliced almonds on the top to compliment the apple and everyone loved it.  I have made it twice now and had to lengthen my cooking time but it could just be my oven.

I would recommend a corn flake crust and granny smith apples.

This is a guaranteed crowd pleaser that is requested when we go to certain dinner parties. It is worth it to lay the apple slices out perfectly.

If you don't have a springform pan, a 8x8 square baking pan (glass) works just as well! This was delicious, best warm out of the oven!
