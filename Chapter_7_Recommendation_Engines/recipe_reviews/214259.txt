Great summer pie you can make with pantry ingredients you almost always have on hand. To cut back on the fat/sugar, I use sugar free pudding, FF whipped topping and NF milk. To make it lower in carbs, you can forgo the crust and serve the filling as a "mousse" in dessert cups.

My aunt taught me how to make this years ago! I didn't even know there was a recipe for it. She used to make it because she couldn't have too much sugar and would subtitute sugar-free pudding. It is like a very quick version of a chocolate mousse pie using boxed ingredients. I always thought it was tasty though, even with the sugar-free version she used to make.

Quick and Easy to make. I used a premade regular pie crust that I needed to use up but will use this recipe again for sure.

So easy and so good. I topped mine with a layer of cool whip and sliced strawberries and then I drizzled hot fudge over it. Yummy

I made this yesterday and it turned out pretty good. It was very easy to make and it was thick and fluffy.
