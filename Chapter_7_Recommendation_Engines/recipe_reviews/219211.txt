I used the leftover skillet rolls (Butterfluff Rolls from AR, that I baked in my cast iron skillet) from last night to make this breakfast bake. I did NOT have half-n-half so I subbed in fat free evaporated milk. The spinach I used was frozen--I made sure to thaw it and really squeeze the moisture out of it before I added it to the casserole ingredients. I also sauteed the vegetables in butter because I happen to be out of oil right now. This turned out really good--my youngest especially liked it. Next time, I would add some fresh garlic and I'd cut back on the milk a little next time. This was a great way for me to use up leftover rolls and get a little "green" in the family's diet.

Great casserole! People were shocked to know it is made from dinner rolls. Spinach is a great addition and the flavors are nicely developed.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  This was for a holiday brunch with family & while I am a big fan of spinach, I worried that picky eaters might not like it.  I needn't have been concerned.  This was a huge hit and I know I will make this again & again.  Note: I made sure to cut off large stems & veins in the spinach before cooking (they're unpalatable) & drained/blotted the spinach with paper towels rather than a tea towel. This type of recipe is very forgiving & adjustable to taste, but I found that just as it is, it's a nice blend & layering of flavors.  Don't be afraid of the hot sauce, it adds a subtle but nice contrast to the other ingredients.

This recipe was amazing. I used Maple flavored sausage which added a sweet flavor and was sooo good. I also just sauteed the vegetables in the remaining grease after cooking the meat (instead of MORE oil). I also used a combo of fat free half and half and whole milk... I will definitely be making this recipe again. SOOO good!

Wonderful! Made this for the first for a pitch in at work and everyone loved it! I used white rolls as I didn't have wheat and I sauteed the onions and spinach in butter instead of oil.  I squeezed as much water as possible out of the spinach/onions. I also put the sausage in a collander and let it drain while fixing the other components then took paper towel to it and got even more grease off.  The casserole was moist and very flavorful. I was skeptical about the hot sauce but I used it and it tasted great!  I will definitely make this again.

I loved this! Couldn't find this brand of rolls do I used another frozen name brand wheat roll. Used a package of original Jimmy Dean sausage. Only change were 2: 1) used frozen chopped spinach. Not quite a while package, just eyeballed it. Which I did saut√©e with other veggies. (After squeezing excess liquid when defrosted) 2) added some small diced red bell pepper for color and added flavor. Was really tasty! I kept going back for more.  Served at a brunch and people kept asking for this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly...I even covered it with foil and cooked it a little longer to make sure it was done.  Mine got too done on the top and was soggy in the middle.  I took it to an event, and the inside looked like a hot, runny mess! Luckily, I gave it a 2nd chance.  I took the leftovers home and heated them up the next day for breakfast and they tasted great!  I recommend covering it with foil the entire time it bakes, then take off the foil at the end so the cheese gets crispy.  Setting it out to rest afterwards is a must, or the rolls are soggy and gross!!

Do not change anything!  I have made it twice, once full size, once half size and it is by far the best breakfast casserole I have ever tasted. I couldn't find the wheat Sister Shubert wheat rolls so I got the SS plain dinner ones and I don't think it made any difference.  Lots of compliments :)

This is very good. I agree with another reviewer that it takes much longer to cook; keep it covered and then remove the foil the last 20 min.... It took about 1.25 hours to cook.

Great recipe! Even my picky kids loved it! The only changes I made was for convenience as I wanted to use what I had in my fridge. I used 2% milk instead of half & half. For the bread I used the sweet Hawaiian rolls and it was delicious! The mild sweet balanced the salt from the sausage. Lastly I added bacon crumbles to the top for some crunch. Overall great recipe and I will definitely make it again!

This is a good casserole. The wheat sister Schubert rolls give this dish a sweeter flavor. It is very good. I did substitute cooked ham instead of the sausage and it worked well. I also substituted whole milk for half of the half and half. Next time I probably won't use half and half at all. The milk was fine. I will also use one less roll and add 2 eggs for less bread. This was good and we all enjoyed it-  I'm sure it will be better with the changes.

Using real cream instead of half and half makes it almost a dessert.  I would add more spinach, 10 oz barely covered the top.

I shared this dish with some fellow condo and boat people ~ the unanimous decision was a 5 - absolutely delicious!  I used bisquits instead of dinner rolls, otherwise went right by the recipe.

I made this for my husband for our 29th wedding anniversary breakfast. I followed the recipe except for adding dried parsley to the top prior to baking. This was perfect! I will definitely make again.

I didn't care for this recipe at all.  Followed the recipe to a T and nobody liked it.  The dinner rolls made it too sweet and gave it a soggy texture.  Would have been better with potatoes, but I think I will just look for a new recipe.  I divided it into single servings and have been making my poor husband take it to work for breakfast so I don't have to throw it all away.  I'm worried that it may come back to haunt me when he one day exacts his revenge.

We made this as described except reduced the cheese to 1 cup, and increased the spinach to 10 oz. (2  packages). We also used hot sausage. The flavor was excellent. We made Christmas morning and are looking forward each day to remaining leftovers. Definitely a do over and want to share with family/ friends in future.

Made a double batch for breakfast during our stay at a cabin in Vermont for a family reunion.  Everyone loved it.  Several have asked for the recipe.  Have no clue where to find Sister Schubert rolls, but a substitute of other frozen dinner rolls worked just fine.

Great tasting morning meal. Warning though... stated time from prep to table is an hour and a half. This fails to mention the two hours need to refrigerate before baking.
