I should have mentioned the chicken soup can be switched or combined with either cream of mushroom, cream of broccoli, or cream of celery soup.  I personally use the low fat cream of chicken mixed with the low fat cream of celery.-casch

I have never enjoyed any recipe made with canned soup, but this was fantastic!  It tasted very much like the homemade, labor-intensive tarragon chicken I make, as far as the creamy sauce goes.  Delicious over rice!

I used 6 chicken breasts, 2 cans cream of chicken, 1 can cream of celery, 1/4+ cup mayo, 2 teaspoons garam masala, and 1 cup grated parmesan.  Fabulous!  I actually joined this site just to rate this recipe.

Wow! This is unbelivably easy and so very, very yummy! I've made this several times and it's always great and very quick.  I usually add a bit more curry than usual, because I love the flavor.  I find myself licking up every last bit of the sauce!

Not good.  I followed the recipe exactly and will never cook this again.  No one liked it, had an unusal taste maybe the mayo- I have made many great recipes from this site- this is not one of them. Sorry.

I used one can of cream of chicken and one can of cream of mushroom, and substituted shredded mozzerella because that's what I had.  I was hoping it wouldn't be too spicy, since my husband is not a huge fan of curry, but it turned out deliciously creamy and mild.  I also upped the cooking time to 1 hr 20 min, since my chicken was not completely thawed.  It tasted great with brown rice!

This was okay, but you REALLY have to love cream of chicken soup....I think next time I'll use cream of celery.  Overall good and easy though!

VERY tasty and easy meal.  My husband & I both enjoyed this recipe very much.  Cut up my chicken and doubled the curry - delish. Unlike some other reviewers, I didn't feel the Cream of Chicken soup overpowered the recipe at all - the parmesan seemed to eliminate that.  Thanks for a quick, easy and different chicken recipe.  We served over wide whole wheat noodles.

My girlfriend used to make this for a special dinner.  She died of lung cancer almost 2 years ago.  The only thing she did differently was to add 1 tbsp of lemon juice to the sauce and used shredded cheddar to top it instead of the parmesan.  This dish always reminds me of her and how special she was.  I miss you Ms. V!

My entire family LOVED this meal! My 4 yr. old exclaimed- "this is better than pizza!" I doubled the curry and replaced one can of crm. of chicken for crm. of celery. I also cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces before cooking. I served it over rice with some broccoli and rolls, it was super easy and so tastey! This is the best meal that I've found on this site! Thanx!

This recipe is darn good. It's very tasty and quick to prepare -- perfect for college students! It took us a little longer to bake, but that might have been because our chicken pieces were big.

Hi Everyone!  Well, I didn't have any parm cheese, but I had 3 chicken breasts, curry, cream of mushroom and mayo, so I gave this a whirl!  It was really tasty too!  I served it to myself in a bowl - brown rice on the bottom, fresh broccolli, carrot and onion in the middle and the chicken and sauce on top.  I have enough left over for a few lunches this week. I'll surely make this again.  Great recipe for a crowd, or for a singleton like me(-=

I made this with only cream of mushroom soup since I didn't have cream of chicken.  Followed the recipe otherwise, and tasted the sauce before putting over the chicken...  and ended up adding another teaspoon of curry to it.  I don't usually like curry, but this was pretty good, and my curry crazy husband loved it and has asked me to make it on a regular basis.  I agree with other reviewers in that this is not really a pretty enough presentation to be a company dish, but it tastes good, all the same.  Using the two cans of soup gave me plenty of sauce to spoon over the chicken and some rice when it was all done. Update:  I've made this several times now, and I have to say that cream of chicken puts it over the top!  I won't make it with mushroom anymore.  I use one can of soup, as two is too much sauce.  I just about double the curry and leave the parm the same.  Great served with the sauce over steamed potatoes!

YUM!  I poached 3 bone in chicken breasts (instead of baking boneless).  I used 1 can cream of chicken/mushroom (blend) soup and 1 can cream of chicken - as other reviews mentioned, too much cream of chicken flavor to use alone.  Mixed it all up, baked it and served over rice.  Everyone cleaned their plates!  Thanks for the great recipe casch!

This was ok. It tasted like it was missing something. Probably would have been better with some garlic in it, or sour cream instead of mayonnaise.

I was surprised by this recipe.  I didn't expect it to be very good, but it wasn't bad...wasn't out of this world either though.  I would make it again...but only if I'm in a pinch or not in the mood for cooking.  :)

This is pretty good, but not fabulous.  I would have rated only 3 stars, but my 8 year old daughter gobbled it up, which is rare, so that has some merit.  I halved the sauce ingredients and still had plenty to cover the chicken.

Sorry, this one just didn't do it for me.  I didn't care for the texture of the sauce and don't feel the curry incorporated smoothly into this recipe.  Still edible, but I don't think I'll make it again.

This recipe has real potential, I didn't change a thing. (I feel if you are going to rate something it should be made as the recipe states) I like anything with curry, I would make it again with a few of my own changes to it. (like add onions and bell peppers maybe)

Yummy and a nice change of pace from the regular old chicken dinner. I love curry, and even though I made it with 3 tsp it could have used a bit more. Otherwise I made it pretty close to the recipe...maybe a little less mayo and soup. I thought about putting the chicken broth/stock in, but thought I would try it without the first time. It was thick and we liked it. My husband would have preferred it over noodles but I loved the brown rice with it. I cut the chicken into long strips which made it easy to flip in the oven and also looked nice when serving propped up on a bed of rice. Served it with broccoli. I will make this again and try a couple other variations based on other reviews.

I used chicken thighs with it (bone in and skin on) I cooked it for a hour so the meat just melted off the bones...delicious! I also sub marsala (found in the india section)instead of curry. The kids LOVE it. The gravy went well on rice. I forgot to add..I used THREE cans of chicken soup NOT TWO. So we had plenty of sauce; the chicken was swimming in it.

Not bad!  I agree that the taste of the cream of chicken soup is rather strong in this and the curry flavor didn't come through as much as I'd hoped (also noted by others).  My husband really liked it though (served it over fried rice).  Next time I'll probably add some paprika and a bit more curry.

I didn't have curry powder so I added garlic powder instead. I also used Chicken Broth instead of the cream soup because of being lactose intolerant. I removed the chicken breasts and thickened the broth into a sauce. It was delicious!  I would definately make this easy recipe again.

My husband and I adore this chicken--the mayo really adds! We always pound the chicken out to tenderize it first (otherwise it is a little less flavorfull) and add a bunch more curry.

Different recipe, but very tasty.  I wasn't sure the reaction I would get because of the curry, but it turned out okay.  Thank You.

I only used 1 can of Soup (Chicken) and added 1 Tbsp of Soya Sauce, an extra 1/2 tsp of Curry Powder + 1/2 C milk.  Lots of left over gravy.   Very tasty.

I have been searching for this recipe for years! My aunt used to make what she called curry chicken when we came for dinner when I was young. This is fabulous! I also used a can of cream of chicken and a can of cream of celery. SO GREAT!!!

A can of mushroom and a can of cream of chicken were our choices.  It went together easily, and was pretty tasty.  Nothing really out of the ordinary though.

Company chicken?-No. Quick weekday homecooking?-Yes.  The presentation is lacking on this dish, but the sauce is nice served over rice with a side of broccoli.  Kids loved and very quick to throw together.  BTW, I used low fat soup and mayo, and it was just fine.

A dish the entire family loved! Yes, the 3-year old, 6-year old, mom & dad! I only had drumsticks available, so I baked them for 1.5 hours (they were still slightly frozen) and I double the curry. This has already become a family favorite! Thank you for the recipe!

This was great!!  I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces.  I used a smaller dish (8x8) so I had to cook it almost an hour.  Next time I won't do that!

I read the reviews first so I used 1 can of soup (cream of chicken and mushroom) and 8oz of chicken broth.  I also added a little garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper, and I used a lot more curry, almost 3tsp.

I served it with rice and steamed broccoli, we ate it all up.  Thanks!

This was easy to make and my husband gobbled it up. I used one can of cream of chicken and one half can of cream of mushroom. Also used more curry then it said.... turned out good. Next time I think I'll try it on pasta instead of rice though.

I loved this recipe, but I changed it like some others had recommended.  Used: 2 tsp. garam marsala. 1 tsp each onion powder and garlic powder. 1 can each cream of mushroom and chicken broth.  Sooo yummy over rice!  It was amazingly easy to put together.  Next time I have to try just the curry.

I made this with boneless thighs cut into cutlets. I placed the chicken into 13x9" oblong dish, then added sauteed onion, green pepper and minced garlic. Then I poured the soup/mayo/parmesan/curry sauce over it all and baked as directed. I served it over rice (made 8 cups rice). It was a hit, even with our teen-aged guests!    11/7/04

This was pretty good, especially over rice. The curry gives it that spicy, indian taste while it is a creamy casserole.

Very well received by my family.  Only had cr of mushroom and cr of celery soup. Used Dukes mayo and put in about 1/2 c chicken broth. 2 teaspoons hot Madeira curry seasoning and threw it in the instapot with 3 chopped up (because they were fresh out of freezer) chicken breasts. After instapot cycle finished I put 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese in the mix and then placed in a 9x9 casserole dish put another 1/2 cup grated Parmesan on top and cooked uncovered in oven for 15 min trying to brown it up. That did not work so probably won’t bother next time.  Very moist with mild flavor but good and served over rice.

This is a respectable dish for something that is so easy but I thought it could use just a little more jazz.  As usual for me, I cut the chicken breasts into medallions which works out perfectly for my family.  This was great served over rice.

Meh, wasn't great, but it wasn't the worst thing we've ever eaten either.   I think there was WAY to much sauce.  If I make it again I will only use 1 can of soup and will have to cook longer.

This was very good and easy to make. I did add a tablespoon of spicy chicken seasoning, though. My whole family loved it.

Didn't really care for this- all I could taste was the soup.  I would definitely recommend using low-sodium soup as mine came out very salty.

This had pretty good flavor but was very basic. Next time I might add more curry.

We LOVED this recipe! I used 1/2 cream of mushroom soup and 1/2 cream of chicken, instead of all chicken. Also, doubled-to-tripled the amount of curry. Would recommend using mayo and NOT Miracle Whip- this may have been why some people didn't like it. I liked it a lot, and my husband was absolutely thrilled!

Easy,quick and delicious.  My husband loved it,too.   For my taste, though, this is more comfort food than something for company...that's why I gave it 4 stars.  sooo good, though.

To be honest this dish was just ok. It had a good flavor for the time put in to prep (very little) but the mayo made it way too rich for my taste. I will try this next time with lite sour cream. I chopped my chicken and made with rice...good suggestion. Not very pretty though definetly wouldn't make for company.

Very good, but I noticed everybody added extra salt to their dish.  I add a bit to the chicken before cooking, but it needed more.  Also, I had it in the oven for 45 minutes and it was a bit overdone.  I also added half a can of water to make more of a gravy consistency.

I made as written (subbing one can mushroom soup with one can of cream of chicken) and it came out way too salty. If I make this again, I will try to use low-sodium soup.

I subbed the cream of mushroom soup with one of the recipes from this site (I think it was "Cream of Mushroom Soup III). The consistency of the sauce came out a little weird, but it had good flavor and the chicken was moist and tender. I doubled the curry and I think it still could have used more. It was definitely an easy dish to put together - will make it again, but probably not for company!

Super easy and the chicken came out very tender.  I added 2 tsp curry instead of one.  My husband suggested next time we eat it to cut up the chicken into bits and it would be easier to eat over rice.  Yummy!

As other reviewers did, I added chicken broth, more curry powder and decreased to 1 can cream of chicken. It was very creamy. I wasn't extremely impressed, but my husband liked it and I will make it again.

Delicious recipe! I added more curry powder and also some garlic and onion powders as well as fresh ground pepper. Put a little water into the mixture also. My daughter loved this and that is saying something; so did my husband. It was quick and easy to prepare. I did pound the chicken breasts and when I make this again, I may go ahead and cut the chicken up into bite-sized pieces. It was very tender and flavorful. Let me just say that I hate canned soup/chicken recipes and I was expecting this to be overrated. I am eating my words. It went great with a bottle of Darioush Viognier and I am thinking about adding this to a winetasting party buffet lineup because it went so well with this wine.

Fabulous! My entire family loved this recipe:ages 7 to 41! I did add to the chicken when placed in the 9x13 garlic salt, onion powder and black pepper. Also, use just 1 can of the cream of chicken soup, it was plenty.

I made a few changes to this recipe after reading reviews. Our family enjoyed it tonight. My two year old gobbled it up and the rest of us liked it pretty much. Here are the changes I made. I used one can of cream of mushroom soup, 2 tsp. curry powder and 2/3 can of chicken broth. The chicken, cheese and mayo stayed the same. It made lots of gravy that was great for spooning over rice. I also cut up the chicken into strips before cooking. I will use this recipe again. Thanks!

My husband & I thought this recipe was very good.  I will definately make it again.
I took some review advice and added a bit extra curry power & a bit of water to the mixture.  I had plenty of sauce to cover the chicken & some rice.

My family loved this!  I tried this for the first time on my in-laws.  (Risky, I know.) But, they both cleaned their plates.  I found out later that my mother in law "Hates curry" but thought my dish was "excellent"... Must have been my lucky day!  Thanks Casch!

I agree with Terri, I would never make this recipe again. My son (who eats ANYTHING) only ate about 2 bites. Sorry, but I didn't think it was good.

Yummy recipe and SO easy!  We love curry, so perhaps next time I'll add more, but it was delicious.  We served the rice and sauce seperate from the chicken (rather than on top) and our kids ate it up!

easy to make. you do have to love cream of chicken soup because that's all i really tasted. simple and easy recipe.
