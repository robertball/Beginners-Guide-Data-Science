Made this according to the recipe, used 1lb of frozen cubed butternut squash.  Only sub was a cup of full-fat coconut milk for the heavy cream.  The soup (according to the video) is quite thin, but the flavor - WOW!!  By “spicy” it means you get warmth from the ginger and curry powder, but it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what is making it so delicious.  I’d like to add more squash or a potato next time to make it thicker, but this is seriously addictive and so tasty.  Made on a snowy day = perfect savory sip.

Love the flavor of this soup!  To thicken it, I just added a small yellow squash and a small zucchini that i cut up and sauteed with the onions.  

Couple tips:
- if using a whole butternut squash slice the butternut squash in half, then pressure cook it with 1.5 cups of water for 5 or 6 mins, skin come right off!
- Add a chopped chili pepper when sauteing for a nice kick

Made this soup today for a friend. It was so good we had to hold back a batch for ourselves. I would not describe this as spicy, but very tasty. 

Only change I made was to add a half teaspoon of cardamon. If you want a bit of heat cayenne pepper would go well.  Next time I will add some cumin too. Can't wait to make this again. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this soup today and it was so easy and delicious. Loved the curry with butternut squash. The only change I made was substituting half & half for the heavy cream, it's what I had on hand. A definite keeper.

The recipe is a good reference point for me, but I made several changes.  I certainly used more than a pound of butternut squash, but still only used five cups of broth.  I wanted a really thick soup, but five cups of broth even with almost three pounds of squash made it rather soupy.  I went easy on the sugar.  I kept the other ingredients the same.  I also added two carrots, one apple and fresh ginger not grated.  I added a pinch of nutmeg, cinnamon, cardamon, and allspice Instead of heavy cream I used coconut milk.  Cooked it for 12 minutes, and natural release for 10 minutes. It was easy to make because you're going to use a hand blender so everything can be rough cut.

Delicious!! Used a whole almost 2 lb squash and about a cup of pumpkin puree with 4 cups broth and it turned out nice and thick. Sauteed the garlic and ginger with the onion. Also doubled the curry powder and added some cayenne pepper. Used coconut milk as well. We ALL loved it!

This had a beautiful color and perfect light texture.  Delicious.  My husband doesn't like squash  but tried it and loved it.  I can't wait to make this for a pot luck.  It was the easiest soup recipe I have ever made and has so few ingredients.  I did cut the squash in half and bake in 1/2 inch of water for 30 minutes because I think peeling and dicing the squash is difficult.  It is easy to scoop out the pulp after its been baked and add to pressure cooker.

I made it as-is for my wife and she loved it.  It was a cold afternoon and went well with a bit of bread on the side.

I used an entire butternut squash, about a pound and a quarter to a pound and a half, and it still came out perfect.

Very quick and easy in the instant pot.   Tastes great, although a very “thin” soup.  I also used coconut milk in place of the cream and would most definitely make this again.

Very nice. But I could not figure out whether the recipe wants me to wait 5 minutes before doing a quick release, or to do the quick release immediately and then wait 5 minutes before removing the lid. Can someone please explain?

Used less veggie stock as my first attempt was very thin. I use two pounds of squash and 8 cups of stock- delicious!

Maple syrup instead of brown sugar, half and half for the cream, ran short of vegetable broth so 4 cups vegetable broth/1 cup chicken broth.  Will definitely make again. Oh and used the whole squash-about a 3 pounder.

Loved this. Light and flavorful. I am making it for Thanksgiving. To the reviewer who asked when to release the pressure, my interpretation of the instructions was do quick release immediately and that it will take about 5 min for pressure to release. This is how I did it and it turned out delicious.

I made the recipe but saw that it was too watery before immersion so I scooped out 1 cup of liquid and it turned out perfect! Even better the next day as it thickened some more. I will make this again but next time with 4 cups of broth.

Yummy - not spicy at all. Pre-Made lunch for the week and now looking forward to eating it. Next time we make it I will add more curry and try using coconut milk instead of the cream!

Great soup! I agree with other reviewers that it was thin. We didn't have a lot of food around so we skipped the ginger and curry powder and subbed the heavy cream for coconut cream to make it vegan. It was too thin at the end so I put the instant pot on the sauté setting to let it evaporate a bit. In the end, it was great, and my sister who's a very picky eater and almost always refuses to eat any food with vegetables in it went back for seconds! We didn't even mind that it was really thin. We will definitely make this again!

I think it needs less broth and more squash. Otherwise it was good. Maybe more heat, too.

i used fresh ginger grated about a tablespoon in place of dried ginger and  i used coconut milk instead of half and half for the anti inflammatory properties and the nutty flavor. i left it chunky, just mashed itn instead of blending.
 i added a dash of turmeric in addition to curry powder. i wish there was smell-o-vision, so  i could share this with you! this is great!

I did love this soup. I made some changes to the original recipe however. I used coconut milk instead of cream, I used lots fresh grated ginger, I substituted real maple syrup for brown sugar, and added many extra spices. About a half teaspoon of each; Penzies Cajun seasoning, Penzies Hungarian sweet paprika, ground cloves, turmeric root powder and cinnamon. I also prefer to use "Better than Bouillon", instead of most liquid bouillon purchased in stores.Next time I make this I will use more ginger and add some sweet potato. I may try to bake the cubed butternut too. That should naturally enhance the natural sugars in the squash.

Really good!! I thickened with with 3 tablespoons of cornstarch in a separate pot after it was done. Easy to find out about this method online if you are not familiar with it. Mix the cornstarch into a cup first.

Amazing and simple. Now is the best time to make it (fall() with the cost of squashes right now. I think the whole soup cost only $6 and that was because i had to buy the expensive whipping cream and vegetable broth!

I have made many batches of butternut soup over the years and this BY FAR has been my favorite!  The Instant Pot made preparation quick and easy.  I used 3 squash, about 6 cups of vegetable broth, doubled the sugar and spices and added about 1 tablespoon fresh chopped sage from our garden.  I only used a drizzle of heavy cream - maybe 1/4 cup because after I pureed with the immersion blender it was a nice thick consistency and full of flavor.  For those looking to minimize the fat this recipe is absolutely delicious without any cream at all.  Even my teenage boys said "WOW!"

Fast, easy, hearty, flavorful, savory, with a hint of sweet soup!!!
I used the whole Butternut Squash (medium to large). I don't weigh or measure the squash. Next time I will either roast the squash in the oven or put it in the microwave to soften the squash and ease the process of peeling. I used flaxseed oil (what I had on hand) to sauté the medium yellow onion for about 6-7 minutes (longer or shorter sauté times for whatever you like). I then crushed up fresh whole garlic and sauted for another minute or so. Added unsalted organic chicken stock (what I had on hand), fresh ginger root that I peeled and crushed, salt, pepper, curry, cumin (because I love cumin), cardamon (hint of sweetness), and a little brown sugar. I have the crockpot pressure cooker and used the meat/stew setting over the soup/broth setting for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes I realeased the pressure knob on top of the lid,  turned the crock pot off so the pressure would not continue to build and be let out. This  took roughly 5 minutes give or take a few minutes. I removed the lid and used my immersion blender to puree the soup. I then tured the crockpot back on and clicked on keep warm setting. I did not add the heavy whipping cream into the soup as I was not the only one enjoying this. I left it on the side for people to add as they wished (some people don't deal well with dairy products). I absolutely loved it without the heavy whipping cream. Felt I could taste the savory and sweet all in one.

Delicious!!!!!!!  It is so yummy with a loaf of fresh baked bread and a salad!  Perfect on a cold winter night!  I love my bread dipped in this heavenly soup!  I have made this soup many times this winter.

I followed the recipe closely the first time. It is a very good recipe. Today, I used coconut milf instead of the heavy cream plus added a little nutmeg. I also roasted the onion, garlic and butternut squash. Still very good.

Such a comforting and delicious soup and you can make in less than an hour (even cubing up your own butternut.) I decided one hour before lunch that I wanted soup and had some old squash... no matter, it was yummy.

It is thin especially since I did not use the heavy cream (used instead half and half coconut & almond milk) f as I wanted to share with my daughter who is vegan. But added sour cream and crackers to ours and it was great. My daughter will use vegan sour cream.

I doubled the amount of squash since so many reviewers said the soup was thin.  It was still thin!  I wouldn't make it again.

It was so delicious!!  Since I work at different locations everyday, my car is my office.  I take soups for lunch in a thermos so I can drink it easily.  This soup was too thin and I was hungry in a couple of hours.  So any suggestions to make this more filling or thicker will definitely be appreciated.   YUM.....

This was really tasty, but would have been very thin if I had not  been warned b y the reviews of others.  I decreased the Vegetable broth to 4 cups and used my entire 1.75 lb butternut squash instead of a one lb one as per the recipe.  I also doubled the amount of curry powder and added a bit of cumin.  It was really delicious.  I am giving 4 stars since I had to make those adjustments.

I changed it up for a vegan recipe. Doubled the squash to two pounds. Added two more cups of broth. I added 1/2 Tsp. Real diced ginger. After cooking soup, I added one block of Firm tofu after squeezing out extra liquid for 1/2 hour, and then cubing it into bite sized chunks, and afterseparately Pressure Cooked on high for 3 minutes. Quick Release. Then stirred in one cup unsweetened plain soy milk. Add more curry if you like it spicy.

This has a delicious flavor, but is on the watery side.  I would add more veggies next time.  As others did, I swapped the cream for a can of coconut cream.....soooo good!

I only made one substitute because it was what I had on hand.  But, I don't think it made much difference since it was vegetable stock instead of broth.  Anyway, I did everything else as written.  At first, when I opened the pot, I thought, wow, this is really going to be a thin consistency, and it is.  That being said, it is a wonderful, belly warming soup.  I bought a couple of baguettes at COSTCO this weekend and it was great for dunking. I will definitely make this again and again.  Someone mentioned putting cumin in so I may try that some time just to experiment, but this recipe is great just like it is.

GREAT FAST  I used my squash sitting outside for fall
decoration , microwaved to soften then cut up for IP.
Turned out beautifully and soup done for lunch.
Can you imagine how much easier if using a package
of cubed squash. I used beef broth and a few red pepper flakes also. Definitely a keeper.

I used beef broth because that's what I had on hand. I also added a few small red potatoes which made it creamy, especially since I omitted the whipping cream. My family loved it!
