The really popular recipes keep getting more and more reviews and just keep getting more and more popular so I wanted to give an unrated recipe a chance. This is the first time despite a number of culinary misadventures that I've had to resort to a backup dinner. Giving the benefit of the doubt I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with 1 TEASPOON of salt per serving. Had my family eaten this dish we would have been dessicated corpses come morning. If I hazard a guess through the overriding saltiness this dish seems like it might have had an interesting flavor. It was too soupy though and had to be served in a bowl with spoons instead of the standard plate and fork I would expect with a casserole. I don't think I'm curious enough to even try it again with modifications but I did return it to the oven with some cut up potatoes to leech the salt to see if any salvaging could be done.

After reading the other reviews I improvised this recipe to use the leftover potroast I had (flavored with onions, etc).  I used only 1 cup of milk for the sauce, 1/2 t each of curry powder, garlic powder & seasoned salt along with the soup, Worchestershire sauce & paprika.  I did not use any additional salt or pepper.  I added extra cheese (1 cup total), a can of green beans & some French fried onions on top (last 10 min of baking).  The sauce came out thick & very tasty.  It smelled wonderful while baking, too!  I will certainly make this again.

I used this basic recipe to use up leftover roast.  It was pretty good and quick for a night we didn't have much time for supper.  I also cut way back on the milk and spices, as the roast was already seasoned with montreal steak spice from when it was cooked.

We loved the smell of the curry in this recipe but the dish was unedible. It was much too salty and watery. I added instant mash potatoes at the end to thicken it but the salt was just too much and I didn't add the full tablespoon it called for?????

Perhaps the tablespoon of salt is an error? Due to the bad reviews I skipped this one.

Needs half the amount of milk listed and 1/3 of the salt. Other than that it was a nice change from the same old flavors.

Something about this recipe is just "off". Maybe too much curry? My husband barely touched the dish. There are much better uses for roast beef.

With some changes this was actually not bad and the family liked it okay. Inexpensive and a great way to use leftovers. Did not use curry only 1 C of milk and 1 C of cheese. Added French Fried Onions to the top.

Very good but with the following changes. 1 cup milk 1 cup cheese cream of celery soup use salt(sparingly) & pepper in slow cooker not later. Add (optional)frozen mixed veggies 1/2 cup. also I plan on trying this with shredded roast chicken next time.

This might have been good -- I like the base of the recipe -- but it was far too salty. Surely there is an error in the recipe!

I followed this recipe completely. The curry powder was a strange addition. Would not use the full tablespoon next time.  So, it was okay.

The good the bad and ugly. For all the seasonings this recipe missed the mark- it's missing something. I took note about the Tablespoon of salt and quickly omitted the salt. I usedfresh potatoes julienned to cook quicker. Extra sharp cheddar cheese and aside from the issue with the salt no changes. It WAS flavorful not salty...but nothing to repeat.

After reading the reviews I had to change up this recipe quite a bit! I used cut up stew meat and and replaced the hash browns with a large bag of frozen califlower that I thawed in the microwave and diced up in the food Processer to make cauliflower rice ( We are watching our carbs). I also skipped the curry as it didn't seem to be a right spice for this dish. I substituted a salt free herb blend and added more worcestershire sauce. I spiked on paprika. I added the cheese and topped it out with a dollop of sour cream. With these changes I will be making this again we enjoyed it!
