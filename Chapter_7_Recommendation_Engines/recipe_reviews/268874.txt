Made this today. Family liked it. There was  a taste I was not familiar with,  not sure if it was the miso. Next time I make this I will add a little less, other wise it was good. Also,  found two cans of mixed bean in chili sauce, put one can in and the other I drained and rinsed, not sure what it would have tasted like with both cans.  I will try next time with both cans and see how it turns out. Will definitely make again.

This was super simple and turned out great! They no longer carry the 3 bean mix in my area so I just substituted 2 cans of other beans. First time making chili in my IP and it won't be the last time.
