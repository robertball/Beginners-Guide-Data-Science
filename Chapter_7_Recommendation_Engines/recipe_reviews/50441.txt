This is a great recipe.  My changes: 1/4 cup honey instead of splenda, a full cup of pumpkin, applesauce instead of oil, no water and 1 tbsp ground flax seed + 3 tbsp water instead of egg whites (let flax soak in water for 3-5 minutes before incorporating).  Baked for 8-10 min. because of the extra pumpkin.  Also, flax seeds need to be ground to make the nutrients available

I wanted to comment on WANKO's comments that baking w protein powder "destroys" the protein... this is UNTRUE - it denatures it (changes the structure of the protein) but the amino acids remain the same... and baking is a better form of cooking w protein powder... as opposed to frying or other high heat methods...

I left out the oil and put in 1/4c of honey instead of splenda. Also added 1.5 tsp of cinammon and about .5 more of nutmeg. and 1/4c more oatmeal... It's more like a sweet thick oatmeal bread... It does really cook in the 5 minutes too.

These cookies turned out great -- even after I realized that I didn't make them right!  I used soy protein powder instead of soy flour, which I'm sure altered the result (although that made them even higher protein, so I guess that's good).  I also added a dollop of crushed pineapple (with juice) to increase moisture. I baked them for about 6 minutes and they stayed nice and soft -- in fact, I think they tasted even better the next morning after sitting in the fridge overnight.  I think a dash of vanilla extract might be a nice addition next time.  In any case, these were a compact and very satisfying on-the-go breakfast, perfect with a cup of coffee.   Thanks for sharing!

This is the best protein cookie recipe I've tried!  The texture is moist and the flavor is great.  Only change I made was to remove the soy flour and add two scoops of protein powder instead.  For 85 cals and 6 g of protein per cookie!  Thanks Ronna!!!  Even my kids love 'em.

I made a few changes, too - omitted the molasses, used apple butter instead of oil, used half regular splenda, half brown sugar splenda, upped the pumpkin to 3/4 c., used low cholesterol egg substitute instead of the egg whites, and added a dash of pumpkin pie spice. The guys at work (construction workers, not big on health food) loved them! even after I told them they were good for them - LOL

Tasty breakfast cookies!  I used 1 cup fresh pumpkin and added cinnamon & some allspice to that as well, no water or oil.  I added about 1/2 tsp of allspice (piment is the name here) and about 1/8 of ground clove in addition to the recommended spices. Did add the flaxseed and used 2 eggs instead of 4 whites.  I also had to cook them longer than 5 mins (8-10)but I think it was b/c of the fresh pumpkin being so moist.  Very good though!  I've already had 3 tonight!! Oh! Also put in walnuts. ***True test of goodness: Husband approved! He is a big health nut and doesn't like/eat anything with too much sugar in it.  He LOVED them! Merci!

It is hard to rate healthy recipes on the same scale as chocolate brownies, but I really love these healthy breakfast cookies!!  I think they are much better than the brand I have bought in the store.  I doubled the recipe and used two whole eggs instead of 4 whites.  I used one tbsp. of  flaxmeal for the whole batch.  I will probably make a version for my husband adding some brown sugar and raisins, he is less of a health nut than I am :)  Thanks for submitting!!!

These cookies are very good! My kids enjoyed making these and eating them. It's always fun when they don't know they are eating something healthy! I used 1/3 cup honey instead of Splenda, 1 1/2 cup rolled oats, 3 tsp. cinnamon instead of 2, and organic millet flour instead of the soy flour. I think these would also be good with agave nectar in place of the honey. I may try that next time. I think they would be good with raisins too. Oh- I almost forgot- I doubled the amount of pumpkin and baked them for 8-9 mintues instead and they turned out great. Doing it this way made 20 cookies. A tasty healthy treat. Definately will make them again!

I love these cookies! I make large batches, freeze them, and pull them out of the freezer as I want them. They are great to use as snacks throughout the day. I did modify the recipe based on others reviews. I didn't use splenda but instead 1/4 cup honey. I used 1 cup of pumpkin instead of 1/2 cup. I also used more cinnamon and opted out of the nutmeg (just don't care for it). I then spray a mini muffin pan and spoon the batter into the pan and bake them. 3 cookies equals roughly 1 normal cookie. This way I can snack on them easily throughout the day. My kids even enjoy them!

I used all whole wheat flour and added walnuts and craisins for extra flavor and texture.  I also added about 1/4 more pumpkin and baked 10 minutes. They came out soft and yummy. A great Fall weather cookie!

Healthy and delicious! Great way to get protein while on the go.  Even my kids love these cookies. I changed just a few things about the original recipe: 
First, I doubled the entire recipe - the single batch seemed to make hardly at all.

Second, I added: 
1 1/2 tsp of vanilla
another 1/2 cup of Splenda
2 Tbsp of honey
2 additional egg whites

Third, I exchanged:
Canola Oil for 1 cup sugarfree applesauce
Soy flour for 4 scoops of protein powder

This all adjusted the baking time.  I baked at 350 degrees for 12 minutes.

The original recipe created a very dry cookie. The modifications that I incorporated created a more moist and tastier cookie.

These are super yummy. I used applesauce in place of oil, used half splenda and half brown sugar substitute, did not add molasses as I am allergic, used a full cup of pumpkin, and added half tsp of vanilla. I kept the egg whites, flour, oats and other spices the same. Don't expect them to have a cookie like consistency, they are more cake like, but really good flavor!

The kids and I loved this recipe. Although we changed it abit to make it stretch a bit more and to adjust it to what we had on hand.  I used 1.5 c oats, 1.5c regular flour, 1/4 c agave nectare, 3 tsp cinnamon, 1tsp vanilla, 2 small eggs (with yolk), 1 cup pumpkin. I didn't add any water, soy flour, splenda or flax seed. I did add craisins to half the batch and that turned out delicious!  I love recipes that are easy to adjust!  thanks!

Instead of soy, I use 1.25 cups of whey protien, double the amount of pumpkin and add about 1.5 cups of crushed walnuts(this is what is missing from the original recipe, the texture of nuts is perfect and adds more protein) and use the full egg, not just the whites. These cookies keep me full and are a great protein supplement. I can't believe something so healthy tastes so good!  I don't see a problem with too much baking soda as it makes them puff up, which i like.

Very moist and lite. I used ground almonds instead of the soy flour, spelt flour instead of the whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup honely instead of splenda, 3 tsp cinnamon instead of 2, added 1/2 tsp ground ginger and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Now they are wheat free and soy free, sugar free as well as dairy free!

I’ve made these a couple of times.  I find the splenda a little overpowering, so used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup splenda.  Also I added about 1/4 cup more pumpkin to make it easier to mix.  They are pretty good.  I’ve also tried them with chocolate chips and chopped nuts and liked them even better.

This sounded so promising that I had to tweek it and make my own! Here is my version: http://allrecipes.com/customrecipe/62808737/hikin-pumpkin-protein-cookies/detail.aspx 

They taste amazing, they're super healthy, and the whole family loves to munch these! Be sure to include dried berries and raisins, they add sweetness and moisture!

I got this recipe and tried it b/c I'm on a diet and I thought it would be a healthy, tasty snack.  My wife also likes everything pumpkin, so I saw it as a win-win.  I'm sure there's a bunch of people out there who would love this recipe, but for my wife and I it wasn't what we had expected.  :(  Probably won't try this again.  Sorry!

Haven't yet made these but I have pumpkin seed protein on hand (a not bad tasting vegetarian protein) and would like to try to substitute raw/organic sugar for the splenda.  Will let y'all know how it turns out!

Pretty good for what they are (I'm on a high-protein training diet). I added walnuts, doubled the cinnamon, and used honey instead of stevia.

I made some changes to this recipe, but it was delicious. I used 1/2 c regular sugar and 1/4 c splenda brown sugar. I used chocolate soy powder instead of soy flour. I also used maple syrup instead of molasses, and applesauce instead of splenda. I added craisins, carmel swirled chocolate chips and some bran (just to use up what was in the kitchen). they were delicious anyways!!

I'm really surprised at former reviewers who thought these cookies had great flavor.  In my experience they're quite bland.  I substituted brown sugar for the molasses and Splenda.  Mine took about 2 minutes longer to bake than the recipe called for, but once they cooled they had a nice, cakey texture.  Hopefully they'll be better tomorrow, but I doubt I'll make these again.  ***On reflection, these cookies weren't as bad as I originally thought.  They definitely improved after a day or two.  My boyfriend thought they were a little weird, but he ate half of them in one night.  His parents liked them and said it was a nice change from the usual, too-sweet cookies.  And, of course, this was intended as a breakfast cookie, not a sugary dessert.  I may make this again and tweak the spices a bit, or make them the same way and eat them with apple cider, since the combination of the two wasn't half bad.

This was a good recipe.  I had to make changes for my daughter to eat them though.  I used brown sugar instead of splenda and molasses, also added 3/4c of chocolate chips.  I had to cook them a little longer than the recipe called for.  These did taste better the next day.  I will make them again.

I'm giving this 3 stars because my 5 year old actually liked these. I did not like them at all. They had absolutely no flavor. I don't know if I did something wrong or they are supposed to be that way, but I won't make them again.

1 3/4 teasspoon baking soda is WAY TO MUCH! Out of all these variations in the reviews I saw no mention of this.  Another thing.. there are so many variations and the original seem to be of no use. The original should be removed and a viable recipe posted!   I won't try this again and will look for somthing else!  To many very good ingredients and time lost here!

I skipped the oil and added two whole eggs instead.  I also added an extra 1/4 cup of pumpkin (I didn't want to throw out leftovers).  Baking time was about 8 minutes and they were still soft.  I just had one for breakfast - yummy, and healthy.  Thank you for the recipe!!

I made the following modifications: used 1/4 c honey instead of Splenda (next time I'll use more honey), 1 whole egg, and 1 cup pumpkin. I cooked for 7 minutes because of the extra pumpkin. They baked well and the result was a bready cookie. I'll definitely make them again, but with more honey as 1/4c didn't provide enough sweetness. The dough was very sticky and I may add wheat germ or extra oats to make it more manageable. I think adding some pecans or walnuts may also enhance the recipe.

I just made these with double pumpkin and no soy flour (used all whole wheat flour), and they're great. I love how healthy they are. Great recipe, THANKS!

After reading a bunch of reviews I made the following changes: Subbed 1/4 C honey for spenda, 1/2 C garbanzo bean flour for soy flour, 1 TB ground flax & 3 TB water for egg whites & 1 TB applesauce for the oil. I added another 1/2 C pumpkin, 1/3 C chopped walnuts, 1/3 C crazins, 1 more tsp cinnamon, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp allspice & 1/8 tsp cloves. I think that next time I will either use all whole wheat flour or sub a different flour for the soy than the garbanzo bean. I think it gave the cookies a slightly strange beany flavor. It was my first time using it. So I didn't know what to expect.  I also baked them in mini muffin tins. Makes for a nice little snack to grab & go.

Perhaps adding raisins and/or mashed bananas would be a good addition to this recipe. I personally did not find it very flavorful. Just because it is healthy doesn't mean it must also taste bad!

Also, I replaced the oil with half an avocado. Avocado makes cookies chewy and have such a great consistency. (No mashing is needed if you use an electric mixer). Plus it is much healthier and a sneaky way to add nutrition to a dessert :)

We loved these cookies. Definitely will be making these more often. I used yogurt instead of oil, 1 whole egg instead of whites, and soaked the flax seeds for a few mins. before putting them in. And used brown sugar, white flour, and a can of sweet potatoes b/c that's all I had.  It still turned out really yummy.

These cookies are fabulous. Moist, chewy, sweet and delicious. I make them with 1/4c brown sugar instead of Splenda. I've made them with either pumpkin or 2 mashed bananas, both turned out delicious.

Pretty good approximation of the "healthy" breakfast cookies popular in coffeechops these days.  But, um, "sugar-free"?  Seriously?  There's molasses in there. Molasses = mostly sugar, by calories. I love the stuff and am not afraid of a little sugar, though, so totally leaving that in & instead replacing the Splenda (I distrust synthetic sweeteners more than I fear calories from sugar) with a bit of white sugar.

This was a great recipe! I am always trying to find a way to make "healthy" cookies that still taste good and have a normal texture. This recipe did the job! I used 2 tablespoons flaxseed and 6 tablespoons water instead of the eggs and I left out the oil. I also added some pumpkin spice and some all spice. Thanks for a great recipe!

Great for my diabetic boyfriend!  I made a few changes:  Sub unsweetened applesauce for canola oil. Sub monk fruit for sugar/molasses.  Sub 1 c rolled oats for 1 c flour.  Use 1/2 c brown rice flour for soy flour.  Add 1 tsp vanilla, 1/4 c. raisins, 1/4 c. diced almonds.  Delish!

I love be this recipe......I followed Karyn’s changes and freeze so I can pull them out as I need. I up the cinnamon and leave out other spice just because I don’t want it to be like pumpkin pie everyday. Great with cranraisins and pepitas.

These are delicious, very filling and satisfying.  Was surprised to find I didn't have pumpkin and was a bit tired of it after the fall anyway so substituted a 15-oz of can of sliced peaches, drained well and puréed in smoothie blender, otherwise followed recipe exactly. Shared with my daughter who agreed they are Yum!

I made these according to the recipe except they were way too dry too roll into balls so I increased the molasses and  added a little water.    Way too crumbly and bland with an overpowering Splenda aftertaste.   This is the first ALLRecipes recipe  that I've tried that has been so very  disappointing.

Couldn’t easily find soy flour. Substituted organic protein powder for a little more protein. Third diabetic recipe is a real crowd pleaser.  Baked exactly 5 min & probably made them bigger than the recipe specified, made a double batch. Really a great breakfast that stays with you.

I made this three times, because I really wanted it to work. But the texture is too mushy. The first time I didn't adjust the recipe. Awful, texture-wise. The second time I flattened them into smaller disks; still too mushy. The third time I upped the spices and cut back on the dry ingredients a tad. Still didn't like it. The flavour is good - this has potential, but for the amount of $ spent to buy speciality ingredients it wasn't worth it.

Thank you for the recipe!  I needed to use up some pumpkin puree. I had a whole cup so I used it all and adjusted the cook time to 15 minutes. I cooked mine in a muffin pan because they were a little too wet to roll into a ball with the extra pumpkin I used.  They were moist and yummy.

I made these minor changes: I had no soy flour, so used whole wheat plus a tablespoon of ground Salba.  I don't believe Splenda is good for us so I used 1/2 cup of Agave Nectar for sweetener.   I gave this recipe 5 stars for health value and because my children, including the fussiest toddler on earth, gobbled these up.  They aren't my favorite cookie, but oh so easy to make and good for you!

very tasty, my daughter loves them. I used pumpkin pie spice mix and doubled the pumpkin, and used a whole egg instead of an egg white.

I did not like these and I usually like recipes with pumpkin.  The flavor was very strong.
