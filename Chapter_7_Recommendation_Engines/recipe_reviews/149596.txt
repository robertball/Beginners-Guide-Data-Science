I used the recipe as a starting point.  Instead of deep-frying the cauliflower, I roasted it w/ garlic per another recipe here.  The dressing was okay, but I felt it was missing something.  I used Greek Yogurt and had to thin it a bit with water, but other than that followed the recipe.  The arugula, tahini dressing and garlicy cauliflower were a nice mix of flavors.

I roasted the cauliflower and potato in the broiler rather than frying it. Garnished with black sesame seeds. Good, but probably not something I'd make again.
