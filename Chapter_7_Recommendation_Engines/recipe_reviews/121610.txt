These were THE BEST homemade butter cookies I have ever tasted! I gave these as gifts this Christmas and they were a hit.  There were only two things I changed: the baking temperature and the baking time.  They took way too long on 350, so I changed the oven to 375 and baked them for about 20 minutes. These were total melt-in-your-mouth goodness! Thanks.

These cookies were okay if you're looking for "SUGAR" cookies(thus a 3). If I had'nt made them myself, I would'nt have thought they were butter cookies at all, I could hardly taste the butter. These cookies really do not have a distinct flavor but if someone had sent them to me, I would guess they were a light, crispy, sugar cookie. The cookies are not nasty, just lack the buttery flavor. The recipe was easy and fun to make with my 5 year old.

the cookies were easy to make, but they don't taste like a butter cookie. The cookies taste like a sugar cookie, but are still good, just not a butter cookie.

These cookies are light, soft and delicious. They have just the right amount of sweetness. Thank you for the recipe Betty. It is definitely a keeper!

These cookies were ok.  They are not very buttery and you definitely need to flatten them with a fork.  This is difficult because the dough is sticky.  I had to dip the fork in flour each time.  You also definitely need to add the sugar for sweetness.

I'm not sure if i made this wrong, or if measured the flour wrong but mine came out very floury tasting and at first was very powdery i had to add an extra 1/2 cup butter to get the right consistency in order to roll into balls. Very disappointing.

I needed some cookies in a hurry, so I decided to try this recipe.  These are really good cookies!!!  I just wish that I had doubled the recipe, so I would be able to leave some at home.

I am not a fan (AT ALL) of plain cookies (sugar or butter), but these were out of this world. I only tried a bite before serving them to be sure they tasted like something other people would enjoy, and before I knew it, I had eaten 3!! It's slightly crispy outside and soft, (like, melt-in-your mouth soft!) inside. The dough is indeed sticky so I did refrigerate it for about 30 minutes. The baking time stated was just right for me.

Delicious, simple and not too sweet. I did double the vanilla and add a shake of salt to the batter.

They are tasty light cookies but... The cooking time for me was too long, even for the 12 minutes. Also, the dough really needs to be refrigerated before rolling. It was unbelievably soft and sticky. I had to wash my hands off because the dough was just accumulating on my hands. I think refrigerating it for a few hours would solve this.

It was really crispy and yummy though I thought the butter wasn't enough. I didn't roll the dough with sugar and I am glad I didn't because the cookies came out perfect in terms of sweetness. I'll try to add in a little more butter next time. :)

These are excellent! This was one of the cookies that made it to my Thanksgiving Cookie List 2006.  I am so happy that I did.  These are the best sugar cookie that I have ever made.  I cannot roll out cookie dough because of an old injury so these work perfectly for me.

I saved these drab cookies by icing them with chocolate butter icing.  I won't make them again!

These are a favorite everywhere I bring them!  They taste amazing with chocolate or vanilla frosting, or just plain.  I always triple/quadruple the vanilla in the recipe.  Make these!!!
