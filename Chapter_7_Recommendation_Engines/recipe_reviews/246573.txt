Fantastic!  Very close to to dish I grew up with  and very easy.  It might have some ingredients that are not quite as familiar to some, but these days can be found quite easily.  Only thing I would modify is the amount of turmeric. I put 3/4 tbs instead and put a tablespoon of Ketjap Manis (sweet soy sauce). Yum!
