Tasty! I did modify, only to make it easier for me. Here is what I did -  sub one 6 oz can tomato paste for the tomato sauce, adjust to 2 cups water. Cooked in the slow cooker low 7 hours uncover last 20 minutes for sauce to thicken. Ate over brown rice - yum.

I was looking for a way to use my fresh cowpeas. This recipe is it, delicious! I of course did add some other ingredients, like fresh okra and tomatoes and some ham. My husband and I loved it and I will make more as the peas are taking off in the garden. Thank you!

I'm not a black eyed pea fan at all, the BF loved these and I liked them! I doubled all the seasonings but used half the peas. I didn't see a need for the oil and used veg broth for added body to the broth.... and to keep it veg for me! I served these as a side dish and the man enjoyed soaking up the juices with some cornbread. I'm sure I will make this again!! Thank you so much for sharing TGural!

We loved this.  

I substituted fresh parsley for the cilantro because my wife is one of those people that tastes soap when she has cilantro.  I also substituted regular paprika + a pinch of light brown sugar for sweet paprikia, because I did not have any sweet paprika.  Finally, I left out all of the cayenne pepper for the first batch because my wife does not like things that are too spicy.  I will probably add back 1/2 of it (1/8th tsp) in the next batch.  My batch was also done 15 minutes early, so if you don't want mushy peas, start checking about 30 minutes early to see if it is done.

I DO have one question.  I was raised in South Carolina and we raised 3 different types of peas that would match the description you use.  They all grew in pods that were about 4-6 inches long.  Blackeye peas are the smallest in crosswise diameter and are sold dried under that name in stores.  They have a small black spot where the pea attaches to the pod.  Purple hull peas were larger in diameter and had no black spot that I remember.  What we called cow peas (or crowder peas) were the biggest in diameter (almost garbanzo bean sized) and I think they too had no black spot.  My Dad said they were called cow peas because sometimes they were used (whole with th pod) as food for the cows 

So which of these do you use?  I used the dry blackeye peas from the store and they were really good.

I have never had black-eyed peas before but  I'm always trying things in an effort to eat healthier so I purchased a bag of dry beans and went searching for a recipe.

I came across this one and I thought; "this seems pretty run of the mill but I'll give it a whirl".  

No tomato sauce on hand so I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of tomato paste, added the water and used my stick blender to puree everything.  I did triple the spices (except salt and cayenne), cooked in crockpot on high for 5 hours and low for an hour.  Served over brown rice and a side of garlic/mozzarella turkey sausage.

This was SO FLIPPING GOOD!!  I have no idea WHY it's so good but do yourself a favor and make it.  

This will absolutely go into the rotation to be eaten at least 3 times a month.

Needed something to do with lots of farmer's market purple hull peas and this is the ticket! So good!

We loved it. I was looking for a recipe for black-eyed peas because I had some cans kicking around in the pantry. I used 2 15 ounce cans and reduced to 1/2 cup water.  I didn't have tomato sauce so used diced tomatoes. I think I might try throwing a ham hock in next time.

This was good. I'm not too familiar with making black eyed peas and look forward to making them again.  I would add some garlic next time.

The spice blend is GREAT but the directions make no sense. I don't know why you would dump a bunch of cold oil and raw onions in a pot with everything instead of actually sauteing them.

I sauteed the onions and garlic and then added tomato paste and sauteed that for a bit. Then I added everything in together. Using broth instead of water is good for extra flavor. Just go easy on the salt if you do that.

One reviewer suggested using brown sugar if you don't have sweet paprika. I used smoked paprika and about a teaspoon of brown sugar.

After fixing the recipe it turned out great. Definitely five stars. I just can't give this recipe five stars as written because of the whole cold-oil-and-raw-onions thing.

Mine had a soup consistency, probably because I soaked the peas over 12 hours. I really liked the unique flavor and level of spice. Served over brown rice. Great way to jazz up black eyed peas!

Flavor really builds as you cook it.   Have made it about 5 times.   I find that I like it better when I Cut olive to  .25 cup.

I was looking for a black-eyed pea recipe for New Year's that was a little different, and this was great! The flavors are amazing, it was easy to make, and my 15 month old loved it too! I will be making this again for sure!

I used the parsley instead of the cilantro because I had parsley on hand and I don't really care for cilantro. The cayenne made it just zippy enough without being overwhelmingly spicy. It was great served over seasoned rice. Will keep recipe and make again.

I followed the directions as written, except I replaced some of the water with chicken broth. Vegetable broth would work as well if you want to keep this a vegetarian dish. It’s become my New Year tradition. I will increase the cayenne next time, but follow the recipe the fist time until you learn how spicy you want it. I love this recipe and have shared it with others.
