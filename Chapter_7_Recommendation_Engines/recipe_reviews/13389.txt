I am the original poster of this recipe and since posting this I, too, have made some changes to thicken the soup up.  I now 2 to 3 cans of New England Clam Chowder and 2 to 3 cans of Cream of Potato soup.  I also add 4 cans of the minced clams.  This is still the best Clam Chowder I have ever tasted!!!!   Enjoy!!!!

Living on the Oregon Coast you would think that there is good clam chowder here? Anyone heard of Moe's? This is even better than Moe's!! This recipe is the BEST that I have had in YEARS and YEARS. Talk about easy and cheap. I used fresh clams out of the Yaquina Bay that we dug. Since there is not a lot of juice I added about 1/4 cup of clam juice (sold in stores with tuna), half an onion, 2 small potatoes, 1t of ground cumin, and cooked for 9 hours. I used the heaven sent Wondra flour product to thicken to our liking! THANK YOU for such a GREAT recipe! Everyone should try it!

I served this to my family on Christmas Eve and received rave reviews!  I doubled the recipe and cooked it in my crockpot on high for 2 hours and then on low for 3 hours.  I used 5 small cans of chopped clams with all the juice, 1 qt. half & half and 1 pt. of heavy whipping cream, 2 bags of precooked, chopped red skin potatoes, 1/4 cup chopped onion and also added approximately 1/3 cup of good sherry wine right before serving.   Decadent!!!  
Thanks Deena for sharing this fabulous recipe!

I just made this super simple chowder and took the advice of some of the other reviews.  Added more potatoes and used the fat free version of soups and used 1 pint of fat free half and half and 1/2 pint regular whipping cream.  It came out very creamy. I didn't let it cook all day either only until the potatoes were tender.  Although I'm not a connoisseur of clam chowder, I thought this was really good.

In a word... "Phenominal"!

My two sons and husband love clam chowder.  They have had many bowls in many different restaurants and insist this recipe is among the best they've ever tasted.  I made some adjustments to the original recipe.  I added 3 cans of clams, but the chowder could have used at least one more can.  I also substituted 2 cups of heave cream for the 1/2 and 1/2.  I also cut up 5 red new potatoes.  Thick, creamy and absolutely delish!

Took this to my boat club meeting tonight, and for the first time ever, my dish was all eaten up, and lo and behold, people asked me for the recipe!  That's such a great feeling.  A real judge asked me if there was some liquor in the recipe, and I whispered that yes, I had used some sherry, as someone earlier had suggested.  He danced about and insisted that I bring the recipe to the next meeting...So, a squirt of sherry will not hurt, especially if you are entertaining judges.

This is very good - although I did get a chuckle out of the title. Yes - this is quick & easy to prepare but it takes ALL DAY TO COOK! Maybe not so quick? :)) I added a larger can of clam chowder and used 1/2 the amt of half and half. It is very good but I think it tastes very "store-bought" (for lack of a better description). Some white wine might add more depth or I should have heeded others advice about adding some potatoes or perhaps even some shredded carrots for color. Overall - a very good recipe but I think it needs some playing around with to make it "perfect."

This was excellent! Thick and Creamy!! I used 2-20oz cans of whole clams and 1-6oz can of chopped clams including all the juice. I also added a whole bag of O'brian potatoes (frozen) which also gave the chowder some color from the red and green peppers. I seasoned it a little with Bookbinders seasoning. This is the BEST!

As per some of the other reviews I read here, I added 2 cubed/peeled potatoes, an extra can of minced clams, 3 stalks of celery chopped, and a small onion diced.  This was absolutely wonderful! Everyone in my house loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loves this soup - to make it even better I saute an onion, a few stalks of celery and some chopped red potatoes and then add the rest of the ingredients with the exception of the cream - instead I use a 12oz can of 2% evaporated milk to cut down on the fat.   To speed up the process I make the soup on the stovetop not in a slow cooker - it's ready in 30 minutes. To keep the clams tender I add them last just to heat them up. Fantastic recipe !!!

My husband and I loved this soup. I did make some changes after reading everyones reviews though and I feel they were well worth it. I used 4 cans minced clams, 2 cans clam chowder, 1 celery soup, and 1 potato soup can. I added minced garlic, old bay seasoning, sherry cooking wine, 1 small diced onion, salt, pepper, and a few chopped up petite red potatoes.  I used the whole pint of heaving whipping cream but not all the half and half as I was afraid of it being runny.  It turned out thick, creamy, and did NOT have that store bought taste others were mentioning. I think the must have ingredient was the sherry cooking wine, it made all the difference. Will definetly make this one again. Great recipe.

EXCELLENT!!  I work at a restaurant with "award-winning clam chowder" and I am very choosy about the chowder I eat...this recipe is delish!! I made some recommended modifications; ie: 2 cans cream of potato, 3 cans clam chowder and 4 cans of clams(using the liquid from 2of the cans.  I was running out of room in my slow cooker, so I ended up only using about 3/4 QT half-and-half, but we like it thick.  No problems with the cooking time in my Rival Slowcooker on low, I just checked it regularly to make sure.  I generally don't try recipes with pre-packaged or canned ingredients, but this was wonderful and I will be making it again-next time with potatoes!

I made this soup two nights ago with just some minor changes after reading ALL the previous reviews. I used 1 can of cream of celery, 2 cans of cream of potato and 2 cans of clam chowder (all condensed Campbell's). I peeled and cut up 2 potatos and nuked them for a couple of minutes. I added them into the soup along with the full quart of half/half and heavy cream. I used 4 cans of minced clams (2 drained, 2 not) I added pepper, garlic powder, onion powder (only because I didn't have an onion to add into the soup). I cooked it in my crock pot for about 8 hrs on low temp. The last hour I removed the cover to help thicken. This was not watery at all and the flavor blends were amazing. My husband said it was the best clam chowder I have ever made, and I have made quite a few (even from scratch). I took some to my neighbor who isn't a huge clam chowder person, but he said it was the best he had ever had. This recipe will definitely be in my rotation during winter soup season! Thanks Deena for submitting!

I am a BIG fan of clam chowder and I was very very happy with how amazing this recipe came out and how little prep it took. I used the following: 1 can cream of celery, 1 can cream of potato, 2 cans New England clam chowder, 3 cans minced clams (2 undrained), 1 pint of heavy whipping cream, 1 pint of half-and-half, 2 potatoes (peeled and chopped), crispy fresh cooked bacon pieces, and grilled onions (cooked in the bacon fat seasoned with celery salt and pepper). My family and guests raved about it. It came out thick and chunky and delicious :)

I made this for pot luck at a family gathering and it was a hit.  I changed it a little bit.  I added an extra can of minced clams without juice (total of three cans 1 with juice and 2 without). I also added 1 tsp cumin, 2 potatoes, 1/2 small onion, reduced half-and-half to 2 cups, heavy cream to 1 cup, and added 1 cup whole milk.  It was awesome.  Next time I might add some bacon.  Thanks Deena!

Wasnt thrilled with all the canned stuff but went with it anyway-it was delicious! Took reviewers comments and chopped up some onion, celery and two potatoes (which I nuked for three min.), added two cans potato soup, 1 celery, 1 large thick of new england and three cans of clams with juice, this was mixed in a bowl overnight and dumped into my crock pot in the morning, I added about 1 and 1/2 cups of fat free half and half, some black pepper and left it. Stirred at lunch break and took top off when I got home for an hour to let it thicken up a little. It was great with  garlic bread and we ate until we were stuffed!

I made this for my family last year during Lent, and I am doing so again tonight. It is essentially jazzing up and spreading out canned clam chowder--that's why it's quick and easy. This method also allows you lots of options for controlling the fat, calories, sodium, and/or additives content, something that neither a traditional cooking method NOR straight-up canned soup doesn't do. I start with a quart of fat-free half-and-half and a pint of cream and work with that. it's great. we also add potatoes for a chunkier texture and fuller meal. Oh, and as other posters noted, DO ADD WINE. or sherry. Something that's already open and in the fridge, even. It really brings the flavor up a notch.

I will never make another clam chowder. This is, hands down, the simplest, best-tasting chowder I've ever made, and it sure beats the over-thick glop you too frequently get at restaurants. This is thick but not too thick, creamy, fragrant, and all over just wonderful. I followed KRISSTINA's advice. Yes, you purists, I altered the recipe to suit me, but the basics are the same. Like Krisstina I added 2 small, diced potatoes, a teaspoon of cumin, and a little bit of  onion, about 2 tablespoons of dehydrated onion flakes, which equals about 1/4 cup chopped fresh onion. Threw a stalk of celery in the food processor and chopped it fine and added that too. Based on all the other reviews, I increased the clams to three 10.75 oz cans of whole clams. I drained only two of the cans--that little bit of clam juice from the third can adds desirable flavor. The texture, flavor, creaminess, and fragrance of this chowder cannot be beat. I know I will make it again and again. Thank you to the person who posted this! Oh yes, I assembled it on a Sunday night and put it on low on the slow cooker next morning for 9 hours before leaving for work. It was ready when I walked in the door and it was perfectly blended and cooked.

This is a darned good clam chowder.  I used 4 small cans of clams (plus the juice of 3), 2 cans potato soup, 1 can celery soup, and one can of bumble bee clam chowder mixer. I also used only one pint of heavy whipping cream. Threw in two healthy handfuls of roughly chopped new potatoes and 1/2 a chopped onion.  About 1 and a half tsp of white pepper and a toasted bread bowl did the trick. Double YUM.

I loved this recipe! While yes, it did come out a little thin. The second time I made it I added a second can of New England Clam Chowder and it was perfect! This is such an easy recipe!

I love this clam chowder!  It's easy, has common ingredients, and tastes amazing!  I've made just a few changes recently that I think made it even more incredible, though.  Instead of minced clams, I used chopped and put three cans in.  It's nice having the bigger chunks of clams.  Like others, I doubled the canned soup amount and I think that makes it better, too.  Thanks for posting this recipe, Deena!  It's one of our household favorites!

This is really great clam chowder. It's a little.. thick for my tastes, but I think next time I will just replace some of the cream with half and half. I did use 4 cans of the clams, and the clam flavor was great! Thanks for the recipe!

I cannot say thank you enough for this recipe!  Hubby and I absolutely love it.  I've started only adding one can of clams and a can of tiny shrimp and a can of crab meat that makes a really chunky seafood chowder.  Excellent!

Thank you Deena!

I love this soup so much this is my second time reviewing it! It’s so easy, so simple, and so delicious. The only thing I change is sometimes if I have the supplies I’ll add red skinned potatoes and celery stalks. But it is so good on its own as written. My husband and I now live in the UK, and clam chowder definitely isn’t a thing here. and this tastes like the one at Red Lobster. So glad I can have a taste of home in the cold winter season across the pond.

I altered this recipe as follows:

1 can condensed cream of celery soup
1 can condensed cream of potato soup
1 LARGE can condensed cream of mushroom soup
2 (10.75 ounce) cans New England Clam Chowder
4 (6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams (2 cans drained &  2 cans NOT drained)
1 quart half-and-half cream
1 pint heavy whipping cream
ground peppercorns to taste
dried chopped onions to taste
dash of cumin

This clam chowder was very thick and creamy and my husband and I both raved about it as the BEST TASTING SOUP EVER!

Sorry but I have had better Clam Chowder.  Very little flavor and thin.  I like a thicker chowder myself.

Yes, this is good stuff.  Very Tasty.  The problem is that it really is just like out of a can.  Considering that one of the ingredients is, in fact, a can of clam chowder, my recommendation would be to just make the canned clam chowder.  It takes less time, and it tastes just as good.  For those who do want to use this recipe, avoid runniness by using half the amount of heavy cream and replacing the half and half with 8 oz. of skim milk.  Using cream of mushroom instead of potato is also tasty.

Delicious!  I used a quart of fat-free half & half, 1 cup canned evaporated skim milk (2 T. of the canned milk mixed with 2 T. cornstarch to thicken), 1 can of potato soup, 2 partially cooked skinned & diced potatoes, 1 can clams (we don't like it too fishy), and 1 can each of clam chowder and celery soups.  Cooked in 3 1/2 hours on low and removed lid 15 min. prior to eating and it thickened up nicely. This lower fat version tastes rich and creamy. I will always make it this way. It's worked on the stove top too.

I made this last night and served it in sourdough bread bowl -- fabulous!  The only thing that I did differently was added a bit of butter for more flavor and omitted all the half/half and added a ½ pint of the heavy cream...otherwise it would have been way too thin (we prefer it on the thicker side!)  Overall ~ it was great!  Thanks!

My 12 year old daughter makes this. We add evaporated milk instead of the cream and 3 cans of undrained clams, garlic, pepper, onions sauteed in butter, sherry and a splash of hot sauce and Old Bay. Yummy!!

I was skeptical that this would be a success, however I had almost all the ingredients on hand so I went ahead with it.  It is really good.  I added more chopped clams, as we really like it clammy, and a couple of small potatoes cut into cubes. I also love dried thyme in my chowder so I added about 1 tsp.  This was enjoyed by all, and comments were that it was the best chowder they'd had.  :)  I will be making this again and again.

This is amazing. I was pretty skeptical of how a bunch of cans could taste just like clam chowder I've had in fancy Boston restaurants, but it really does work! I made it overnight one night while my in-laws were visiting, and we had it for lunch several days. They loved it! I added one large potato, cut into bite-sized pieces. I also did not drain either cans of clams -- I dumped them both in, juice and all.

My husband and kids LOVE this clam chowder and this is just as good as any restaurant chowder, with a couple additions:  I add one extra can of (none-condensed) clam chowder, an extra can or two of clams, 6-8 potatoes cut into semi-large chunks, a tablespoon of butter, dried celery and dried chives (about a tablespoon of each), a coffee mug full of instant mashed potato flakes, and salt and pepper to taste.  (The salt is a must and the mashed potato flakes, too, as the chowder will be VERY thin without the flakes -- more like a soup than a chowder.)  Trust me, this is really SO DELICIOUS and makes enough to completely fill my large crock put.  I microwave the potato chunks for about 1 1/2 minutes before adding them to the crock pot.  Then I cook on low for about 5 hours, or until the potatoes are nice and tender.

This was tasty. I used reduced fat soups and fat free half & half to make this a little healthier. I also added some red cubed Red Potato with the skin on for a little extra color and texture.

This recipe has such great reviews I thought I should try it.I gave it a 3 because it was edible.This tastes just like a can of clam chowder.You can kick it up a bit at the end by adding a splash of sherry and fresh grated parmesan cheese.I should have known...Scratch is always better than a can.

This is a awesome recipe.  I didn't use the celery soup; used two cans of potato soup, 2 cans of New Encland Clam Chowder; 4-5 cans of clams, juice from two (chopped and minced) two precooked potatoes; 4-6 slices bacon cooked and crumbled;1 medium onion chopped and sauteed with 2-3 celery stalks. I honestly can't remember having any better chowder than this.

Would never had tried this recipe except for the reviews...add a few potatoes freeze the left overs you can not tell that there are canned soups involved.  It's great served w/the 
"Cheddar biscuits I" that are also found on this sight.  An easy meal all the way around!

This was very good.  I made it the way Deena posted on 1/13/05 and only used 1 pint half-and-half and it was perfect.  The second time I made it, I went according to the original recipe and it was WAY too soupy for me.  I like thick clam chowder.

This is by far one of my favorite crockpot recipes.  It is so easy, and absolutely delicious!  The fat content is really high, but sometimes you just have to live a little!!

What an incredible recipe!  I loved it!  The taste is second only to Ivar's!
The first time I tried it, I didn't have time to sit and wait for my crock pot, so I just mixed it all in a pot and cooked it and then let it simmer.  It worked just fine.  My husband - who is totally blind - put this dish together this morning before we left for work and he was amazed at how easy it was for him and plans to "show off" to my parents tonight (who are coming for dinner) that he did it himself.  :)  Also, my little sister's fave food is clam chowder, so her birthday present this year is a special bowl & placemat, this recipe, and all the needed ingredients.  What a family-friendly recipe!

I followed the recipe as is and it tasted good. Next time I would add 2 red potatoes and 1 more can of clams for extra chunkiness.

This is the best clam chowder recipe ever. The only changes I made were I added red potatoes, and used 3 cans of clams with juice from 1 can. I have had many people tell me it is great and ask fro the recipe. They can't believe it is that easy YUMMY!!

This was the best chowder I have ever had! It was so simple to make, yet tasted like it took hours slaving over a hot stove! My husband loved it, although he said it could be a little more "chunkier". Next time I will add another can on clams, and also some chopped canned potatoes. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this tonight and it was delicious! My boyfriend is from Boston and I am a Florida girl. I was nervous about making him clam chowder especially from so many cans of condensed soup, but he was truly impressed he kept praising me for making an authentic New England clam chowder! I used two cans cream of potato, two cans clam chowder and one can cream of celery all condensed Campbell’s. I used the suggested amount of heavy whipping cream but cut the half and half to two cups and so glad I did or it would have been too thin. I sautéed celery and onion and threw that in with three red potatoes I had peeled, diced small and cooked until mostly soft in the microwave. Personal preference I only used two cans undrained clams. I put a tad bit of thyme, salt, pepper and garlic powder. My boyfriend was truly impressed by my New England style clam chowder and my 16 year old son who eats clam chowder in restaurants frequently said mom that’s one of the best clam chowders I’ve ever had can you make it again? So don’t hesitate to try this version of clam chowder I think you will be very pleased with the results!

I love this recipe. I bring this chowder to all sorts of functions and parties and it is always devoured and I am asked for the recipe all the time. People are shocked when I tell them  how easy it is. The only difference I do is I use potato soup instead of the one celery and I use whole baby clams, not minced.

Good but a little bland and runny. I'll thicken it and add some spices and maybe some fresh vegetables (potato, celery, and onion) next time. But, it was super easy!

Yummy and EASY! Did I mention how EASY it is? We've had it three times this month. I've since changed the recipe to four cans of chopped instead of two cans of minced clams.

This was very good and easy to make. I did it on the stove and let it simmer for 45mins. I also added chopped carrots and potatoes and sautéed a chopped onion in 3 tbsp of butter and added a little white wine and fresh cracked pepper.

I use straight heavy cream and no half and half. You can also trade out the cans of clam chowder with cream of chicken, substitute chopped rotesseri chicken for the clams and it's great!

I made this for work and everyone enjoyed it and asked me to make it again.  I did fry some bacon and browned onions in the pan then added the rest of the ingredients along with some clam juice. Very good as written also.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only modifications were diced red potatoes and 1 medium onion chopped. Threw it all in the crock for about 4 1/2 hours. Took it to the in-laws and my father-in-law ate 5 bowls. I did double the recipe and was able to feed my hungry father-in-law, husband, myself, and 3 hungry teenage boys. Even the teenagers told me how awesome it was. This is for sure a keeper!!!!!

I read about how thin it was so I used 3 cans cream of potato soup, 3 cans clam chowder and half of the half and half suggested...I also used 3 cans minced clams (2 drained one not), small yellow onion sauteed with celery and a bit of garlic, a little butter, pepper, and parsley and although the taste is absolutely delicious it was still quite thin for my families liking so next time I think I will cut out the half and half all together and add some diced potatoes to thicken it up a little more. 

Side note: Although this has excellent flavor as is adding the sauteed onion, garlic and celery is what really makes this stand out from tasting kind of like all the other canned versions. 

Thank you for the super easy and excellent base recipe.

I am not a fan of clam chowder, but my family loves it. I make this for them every month or so and they like this reciep. I make it in a slow cooker on low for 4-6 hours. I took this to a pot luck and 6 people asked me for the recipe. That really says a lot right there.

Pretty good, but don't let it cook too long.  Even on low temp. setting on my crock pot it seemed to change for the worse in flavor and consistency after a while.  The first time I had a bowl I liked it.  About an hour later it had totally changed and I didn't really care for it.

It was okay...I had to add ALOT of other ingredients otherwise it would have been too bland. My dad is from Boston and is VERY picky about his clam chowder (he knows his clam chowder!) He ate it, but I didn't get any rave reviews...I will keep looking for an authentic recipe.

Easy quick delicious recipe. It has been cold here and it was nice to let the chowder simmer on the stove and then enjoy it for dinner. I did add more clams, 3 red skin potatoes, a small white onion diced amd my usual compliment of spices (cayenne pepper, black pepper, garlic powder, cajun seasoning and allspice.) Great also with some rye bread or oyster crackers.

Great, easy and ppl can't stop complimenting.   I sauteed some onion, garlic, celery and grated carrots to make it seem less "canned"   I also ended up leaving out the whipping cream because frankly I didn't think it needed it. Very good easy way to make clam chowder.

I like another reviewer grew up on the Oregon coast & my husband grew up in Boston...so I have a very finicky crew when it comes to chowder!  I got this recipe about 2 years ago and have been making it with rave reviews ever since.  EVERYBODY requests I make it!  I have also made a couple of changes.  I use 4 cans of the canned clams drained,  1 quart of 1/2 & 1/2, 1 can of corn, chop the simply potatoes red potatoes into smaller chunks and add 1-2 tsp of old bay!!!I thin it with a little milk if it needs it as it's cooking!!  EXCELLENT...truly the best clam chowder ever..I used to crave legal seafood clam chowder, but no more:)

I've been making a similar recipe for years.  Only changes are 2 cans of potato soup instead of 1, no heavy cream, and 2 cups of half and half.  I also add garlic powder.  Delicious!

Yum! This tasted like something out of the best New England restaurants. I followed the submitters newest recommendations and added more cream of potato (I used 2 cans instead of the recommended 3), clam chowder (3 cans of "Snows"-2 condensed and 1 ready-to-eat)and 4 cans of minced clams. It was fabulous. Next time I'll follow her other suggestion and add some diced potato.

I would give this 10 stars if I could. This is very easy to make. My husband loves clam chowder and he really liked this recipe. I too added another can of clams. I also served it with some fresh ground pepper on top of the chowder. It doesn't get much better than this!

I made this on Christmas Eve instead of the usual "long version" clam chowder that I usually make.  No one knew the difference.  It was very good.

My husband's family always has clam chowder on Christmas Eve, so I decided to try my hand at making some.  I was so excited when everyone said it was excellent!  I used the basic recipe provided, but added extra clams,red potatoes and bacon bits to make it a little more chunky.  Nothing but rave reviews for this easy and yummy chowder!

Very good and very easy! I added some potatoes, chopped celery and chopped onion to the mix. It tasted more like a potato chowder though. So next time I will add some extra clam juice and thicken it with flour if needed. All in all, this was a great recipe!

for a "can opener" soup, this is the best I have ever tasted.  I told my best bud (who is blind) how to make this since he loves chowders, but really can't "cook" without sight.

This was the best, both he and I are pleased beyond words.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was so quick and easy!  It was a little thin for our liking initially, but I added diced potatoes, celery, and onion, and it was perfect!  About 45 minutes before serving a thickened the soup with three tablespoons of flour.  It ended up a little too thick, so  next time I'm going to add only two.  Wonderful recipe - we'll definitely be eating a lot of this throughout the fall and winter!

I may already have a review in on this one, but it is worth another.  It is definately not a low cal or low fat recipe, but it is the best clam chowder and so easy to make!  I get rave reviews every time and all I have done is dump things in the crockpot!  I do add the juice from the clams and thicken it at the end with instant mashed potatoes.  Makes me wish it weren't 100 degrees out right now, or I'd make it for dinner!!

I love this recipe and everyone always asks me to make it.  I tried fat free half and half before and it was too runny. I probably should have added corn starch.  Anyway, I now stick to the original but I add another can of clams, a splash of onion powder, and a few potatoes cubed. One hour or so before it is done, I add a small bag of frozen corn and hormel bacon pieces. Oh, it is so thick and yummy. Great with sourdough bread and salad or melted ham/cheese sandwiches. Thanks!!

Thanks Deena for a great recipe!  I did as others suggested and added red potatoes and extra clams and thickened it up a bit with flour.  But overall, this chowder was excellent!  Everyone loved it!  I'll definitely be making this chowder thru the cold winter!

This was really good. I did take some of the soup out about an hour befor it was done and added a quarter of a cup of flour to it, and then whisked it in. Then I poured it all back in and cooked for another hour on High. This made it thick, and we served in warm bread bowls!

Excellent chowder.  I made a couple of changes.  I used fat free half-and-half and per another reviewer's suggestion, I used a couple tablespoons of corn starch and a small can of evaporated skim milk in place of the heavy cream to try to lighten up a little.  I also added two chopped potatoes and two teaspoons of dried dill weed (just a personal preference). It was very yummy and my family really liked it too.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe. I am always hesitant to make anything in the crock pot with a lot of milk in it for fear it will curdle. I put everything in plus about 6 potatoes cubed. Set it on high, and 4-5 hours later in was perfect! No problems at all. Added potatoes are a must otherwise there is very little bulk to the soup. I will make this over and over agian.

I was taught by the best!!! to make New England clam chowder, but it took so much time.   Usually started with clams in the shell and proceeded.   Made this recipe, on a lark, to find out if  my family would detect a difference.   They enjoyed it immensely and were surprised to be offered containers to take home (made more because I didn't have to work sooooooo long.   Perfect!!!

Very tasty, but probably doesn't need more than about 2 hours cooking time--just enough to warm it through and let the flavors meld, longer if you add cubed potatoes.

This was a very easy, delicious clam chowder that even my young kids enjoyed! I tried to cut down on SOME of the fat content by substituting a can of evaporated milk for the pint of heavy cream. It was still delicious and creamy, but I kept having to skim an unappetizing layer off the top of the soup, so I don't think I'll try that again. I will probably make this on the stovetop next time, as well, since it was starting to boil after only 4 hours on 'low' in my slow cooker! I'm glad I was home to keep an eye on it, or it would have been a disaster. I also added some bay scallops I had thawed from the freezer during the last hour of cooking. Served it with a whole wheat garlic bread, and the entire family enjoyed it. Thank-you!

Not bad. Reviewers all had variations of this doctored canned recipe and I made mine rendition too.  Some useful advice; Be mindful of how many cans of soup, clams, pints or quarts of cream and half and half, extra potatoes, onions, and celery your crockpot can hold! Mine was full and I still had enough stuff for an entire second batch.  I used 2 cans chowder, 1 can each cream of potato and celery, 3 cans clams, added about 3 cups extra potatoes and about 3/4 cup each sautéed celery and onions. I only had room in my 5 qt. cooker for 1 cup each of cream and half and half. Don’t drain any of the clams. The broth is the essence of the clam chowder flavor. It’s costly to make a big pot of chowder from scatch but make no mistake, this isn’t a cheap way to make it either. The canned goods and milk products and extras add up.  I will leave out the celery soup next time,  flavor was a little too much.  I added butter and it needed salt.  Mine was wonderfully thick and chunky though.

This is the first time I have tried to make clam chowder and it was so easy.  I added one yellow onion and about 10 small white potatoes, diced. I cut the 1/2 and 1/2 to one pint, added 3 cans of clam chowder and 3 cans of clams, 2 drained, 1 with juice.  My husband and I loved it.  I think I will make this for Christmas dinner this year for something new.  Thanks!!!

I made this as written and it was "loved by all"!  Even my VERY finicky 8 year old son. Our daughter requested clam chowder at home, and I think we've found one that's a keeper! I did add approximately 2 cups of frozen, cubed potato. Also, for the"heartier" appetite, you may want to thicken this recipe.

Excellent! I just tweeked it a bit by sauteing a 1/2 onion in about 1-2 tbls. of butter, and added about 2 peeled medium yukon gold potates -medium dice, and I only used about a 1/4 of the half and half.  I like my chowder thicker. It was the best chowder I have tasted!  Everyone raved about it!  This is a definite "must try" ! Everyone will think you have slaved for hours in the kitchen!

My husband who is a picky clam chowder eater said this was the best. I followed the suggestions of adding more clams and potatoes and a little bit of onion. I served in the bread bowls recipe alsoon this site and the kids thought that was "cool". Will definately make again!

Very Good! I used two 15 oz. cans of minced clams. I also added 1 tsp cumin, 2 potatoes, 1/2 small onion, reduced half-and-half to 2 cups, no heavy cream, and added 1-2 cup whole milk.I also added some turkey bacon.

This was easy and delicious! After reading other reviews I added another can of clams (with juice), two cans cubed potatoes, changed to 2 cups half n half and 2 cups whipping cream and 1 lg can Chunky Clam Chowder. I cooked it for 8 hours then tasted it and it was missing something so I added a little bit of butter and cumin. Let it sit on warm for another hour for flavors to mingle and it was wonderful. My husband said it was the best ever! This is worth trying.

This definitely is the best clam chowder recipe EVER!! And it is so easy to make... I took the advice to add extra clams and diced white potatoes and only used one pint of fatfree half-and-half with one cup of heavy whipping cream.  My husband enjoyed it so much, he refused to share any with the neighbors!!

I love clam chowder, and this is the first time I ever tried to make it.   I can't keep it around!   My kids tear it up and everyone who tries it says it is the best they ever ate.   And it is so easy!   I hit the jackpot on my first try here.

I also added a potato and used low fat soups and fat-free half and half.  I eliminated the whipping cream altogether, as I like a thicker soup.  It was delicious and very easy!

This was good but I would add the clam juice in the beginning and reserve the clams until the last. I might also reduce the liquids for a thicker chowder.

I used 3 cans of New England Clam Chowder, 3 cans of condensed cream of potato, 1 can of condensed cream of celery, 4 cans of minced clams with juice, 2 pints of heavy whipping cream, 2 large potatoes cut up into bite size pieces & 1 stalk of diced celery. I seasoned it with a little O’Bay and pepper and cooked it in my crock pot for 8 hours as directed and served it with cheddar cheese biscuits and it was the best meal I’ve had in a long time! As good as high in restaurants! Thanks so much for the recipe. I’ll be making this again and again.

I have made this often over the years, my family loves it.  I modified it some I add 3 to 4 potatoes diced, a medium onion diced and 3 to 4 stalks of celery as well as a stick of butter and a can of chicken broth.  It adds addition flavor as well as makes it thicker .

Extremely easy to make but a favorite of everyone I serve it to.  I actually use this as a base for a seafood chowder by adding mussels, scallops and shrimp to this already flavorful chowder.

Great recipe. You can modify easily for crockpot and more servings, just add more cans of potato, clam chowder, or cream of celery. Add more minced clams and crumbled bacon.

I made this recipe just today and I have to say it was very easy. As per some suggestions I did add some cooking wine, salt , pepper, and some old bay seasoning as well as a tsp of basil (just because the clam can had a recipe for clam chowder and called for it). I like that you can throw it all in the crock pot and let it slow cook or if you're impatient can heat up on the stove and it cooks in about a half an hour. Thank you. I never think to use condensed soups to make an even better soup.

I made this for my family and it was awesome! As I was emptying the cans into the crock pot I thought... "This will not be good".... but it was good... real good.  You should double up on it all to get a good amount for a gang and maybe use a bit less cream and whipping cream than it calls for... ALSO I took an extra can of clams and put it in my mini chopper till it was almost liquid... ***then I dumped that in and the flavor was sooooo much better... just a suggestion...*** I will make this all the time now.... it's great with portuguese pops!!!

Made this recipe least year for our annual Low Country Boil.  I thought it would be a good appetizer, something to keep everyone satisfied while we finished up the boil (we always do the vegetables separate,  then the sausages,  then the seafood for those vegetarians and no shellfish folks.  Little did I know this soup would be the hit.  I made double and there was none left.  I had a New Englander among the guests and he said it was better than what he had at home.  He thought I made it from scratch. Like everybody else,  I tweaked a bit,  not using the heavy cream and using 2 1/2 qts fat free half and half (for the doubled recipe). Doubled the clams and used all the juice. Still won raves.

This was fantastic, although I wouldn't call it quick. My modifications: I used 2 cans each of potato soup and clam chowder, and 4 cans of clams - 2 cans minced and 2 cans chopped - and I drained all the cans of clams. Also, I used a pint of half and half and a pint of whipping cream and the thickness was just perfect.

This was easy! I followed the recipe other that a few adjustments. I did not use whipping cream. I added 1 stick butter, (if not fattening enough!) a diced onion, 1 very large potato chopped in bite size pieces, and a little salt, pepper & parsley. I  cooked it on  low all through the night to have ready for a school staff appreciation luncheon. Smelled wonderful and took a little sample and it was DELISH! The potatoes helped with the thickening. I will make again soon!

This is the recipe my dad has used for years and years!  It is my staple December birthday dinner!  My dad said he got this recipe from a master chef friend in Seattle, WA and has closely guarded it from all family inquiries (except me)!  I will say, some years are better than others.  Must have to do with the clam harvest.  If you try it and it's not absolutely wonderful, put away the recipe and try  it again next winter.  I'll say, 2010 was a great year!  :0)

I've been making chowder this way for at least 15 years and my family loves it!  I add cubed, cooked potatoes to the hot soup.  If adding to cooled soup, make sure you chill the potatoes first.

I gave this recipe 4 stars only because I had to tinker with the ingredients to get the consistency right.  It turned out very good!  For my soup, I also fried about 6 pieces of bacon, 1 onion and 3-4 cloves of garlic.  I also added 3 stalks of chopped celery.  I also diced 3 yukon gold potatoes.  The original recipe uses WAY too much liquid.  I had to add a lot of flour to balance it out.  So, when I remake this, I'll do the following: Do the same with the bacon, onions, garlic, potatoes and celery; use 1 can of celery soup, 2 cans of potato soup, 2 cans of clam chowder, 5-6 cans of clams (with juice), and then add half/half and cream as needed to make it the right consistency - probably about a cup each

I did not care for this recipe. It was like drinking warm milk. It had no flavor and was very thin, and I only added about 1/3 the amount of half-and-half called for. I can not understand how it got such glowing reviews. I was very disappointed.

Wasn't too impressed with this, it made a lot and even my husband, who loves clam chowder, didn't really care for it. Tastes like canned clam chowder, but not as good.

I'm a transplant to AZ from the bay area ca I've been missing the fresh clam chowder in a bread bowl from the wharf. i made this tonight and oh my gosh it was just heavenly and so darn easy (next time i'll cut back the cream and half and half, as it was very rich) the best clam chowder Ive had since i moved to AZ will definitely be in my dinner rotation yum-o

OMG sooooo good!!!! I followed others suggestions and doubled the soup and clams. Tossed in some diced frozen potatoes and frozen celery, carrot and onion mixture as well.  I also would recommend not using all of the half-and-half that will help it not be so thin and add a bit of cornstarch in water.  People who have never eaten or LIKED clam chowder tried this and ended up asking me for the recipe.    Thanks for sharing!

This was a big hit in my house. Although all of us--bi-weekly chowder eaters--wished it was just a little more thick. We did the original recipe (full fat!) with some of the suggested additions:an extra clam chowder and 4 cubed baby reds. Knowing I was going to use the potatoes though, I bought two cans of cream of celery as opposed to 1 celery and 1 potato (celery was on sale). I dumpedit int he pot the night before and put it on as I left for work. I did add garlic pepper to taste and we will definately be making again with the addition of some veg (maybe some cubed carrot and chopped celery).

I have made this clam chowder recipe for years now and each year it gets rave reviews. I've had great success adding in cubed potatoes and topping it with bacon crumbles and scallions. And since I can create this recipe in the slow cooker, it is perfect to take into the office for pitch-ins!

The easiest and best clam chowder you could make! I make this during the holidays, and everyone is amazed! I do add mroe half & half than recommended just to give it that extra creaminess. I also make sure to add red potatoes, celery and onions. Thank you for a great recipe I have used many times!

This was a great base that you can alter and tweek.  I used 4 cans of chunky clam chowder, 2 cans of cream of celery, 1 can of cream of potato.  I added 1 full can of sliced  white potatoes and 4 cans of clams (2 with the juice).  a half cup of whipping cream, sauted onions, celery and bacon.  About a cup each.  Threw it all in a crock pot with salt & pepper.  On high for 1 hour, low for 4.  PERFECT!

Definitely a good recipe and couldn't be easier to make.  My husband loved it "as is" but I would've preferred it more "chunky".  When I make it again (and I will!), I will add diced potatoes.

This was great!  My 8-year-old daughter makes it basically by herself and it is delicious.  We add in the cubed potatoes, bacon, corn, celery, and instant potatoes as other reviewers mentioned and this is a quick hearty meal on a chilly day.

This was a big hit at the holidays. I doubled the recipe in a huge crockpot, and it was way too much. Next time I'll stick to the recipe but still crockpot it. I served in hollowed-out bread bowls I bought from the bakery.

I'll have to admit, I was leary of this one. It seemed to easy to be any good. I was wrong! I added cubed red potatoes as well as chopped celery to my pot in the morning and then when I got home, I added a few more because I like my chowders chunky. I was really impressed with the depth of this recipe. It was excellent and everyone in my house loved it and the leftovers were gone before the next night!

I made a few minor changes... I used about 2 cups left over mashed potatoes instead of the potato soup, added two stalks of chopped celery, and two med-lrg. potatoes peeled & diced. Also, used "condensed" clam chowder soup because that is what I had and added 1 can "chopped" clams (they are a little larger peices. Next time it will use 2 cans chopped clams & the 2 cans minced, that will be the perfect amount of clams). Then I added black pepper and onion powder to taste. Served with sourdough bread, yum!!! It came out DELICIOUS!!! Thank you, this one is a keeper!!!

Excellent. We ate it w/ sourdough. Initially it didn't thicken up as much as we would have liked, but it did after sitting a few minutes.

My husband loved this. He is always trying different clam chowders at restaurants ever since he had this amazing one in Maine. He says "mine" (this recipe) is the best next next to Maine. I did have to use a garlicky potato soup instead because I couldn't find plain.

This was excellent. It has a superb taste to it. I did add about 4 whole potatoes to it (I had some baked potatoes in my refrigerator that I used)and also added some cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. Excellent and simple!

It was great, except I didn't put all the half-and-half. Next time I'll just leave heavy whipping cream out and use all the half-and-half. The soup was gone the first time around and no leftovers in the end. Thanks for sharing!

This soup is fantastic!  I made it with ff half and half, also added sauted celery, onions, and potatoes.  My husband thought it was the best chowder he'd ever eaten except maybe in New England.

Thank you for this recipe! I followed it to the last detail. I did add some diced potatoes, and an extra can of drained clams. Brought it over for Christmas dinner, and it was a HIT!!!!  Definitely going into my rotation of meals.

I ate this for days. I changed the recipe though, I added vegetables cooked in bacon fat, for more flavor. Delicious, easy and quick. Perfect for no-thrills cooking.

I used 1 can cream of celery soup, 2 cans cream of potato soup, 2 cans New England clam chowder, 4 cans clams (2 cans with juice), 1 cup half-and-half and 1 cup whipping cream. It could have been a little thicker but the taste was very good. This made ALOT of chowder!

Delicious!!! I added another can of potato soup and clam chowder plus another can of clams which I added the last  hours of cooking so that the clams will not get rubbery, used only the heavy cream to make a thicker  consistancy, also added a bay leaf.

Excellent recipe!  Even the "cape codders" wanted more.   I added extra potato (par boiled) and sauted onions and celery.  I also used fat free half and half and used only half of what the recipe called for.  I found that it started to burn around the edges after a few hours even with frequent stirring.  I turned the slow cooker down to warm and left it on the rest of the day for a party. Everything is cooked before you add it anyway so I recommend a few hours on high with frequent stirring and then right down to warm. Superb!

This was good and very easy.  I did make a few changes- added potatoes and substituted milk for the half and half. I will definitely make this again and probably add some more clams as others have suggested.  Great meal for a cold day!

I made this recipe this evening and darling bf really loved it. He said I was the best soup-maker EVER! I thought it was incredibly rich and I made a few adjustments based on other reviews. I added 3 cans of minced clams (1 with juice, 2 without); 1 1/2 c. of half-and-half, 1 c. whipping cream and 1 c. 2% milk. Next time, I'll probably cut back a little bit on the creaminess. I'll DEFINITELY make it again!

Delicious. I did open a can of evaporated milk instead of using whipping cream and I never buy 1/2 and 1/2. I use a substitution recipe of 7oz. of milk to 3T. of butter for each cup of 1/2 and 1/2 called for in a recipe.(I used only 2 cups, not 4 cups of my 1/2 and 1/2 recipe.) I also cooked on HI for 3-4 hours in my slowcooker in case the dairy products curdled. Also added some leftover corn. A corny clam chowder. Yum.

This was Great!  My first time making homemade.  I added some cubed potatoes and 2 extra cans of chopped clams with juice.  Then in the last ten minutes threw in a dozen little necks till they opened for presentation.  Will make again!

I made this, replacing the cream and half & half with evaporated milk, adding potatoes I had on hand, and using the rest of an onion I needed to use up. It was excellent. I stirred it every half hour or so, which I didn't mind, but I'll be trying it in a slow cooker. It was wonderful- if it's too thin, cook it down some more & it will thicken and get more rich. Yum! Easy!

This was my first failed recipe from Allrecipes.  I put it together before I left for work and 8 hours later when I got home, the chowder was burned.  So dissapointing.

This recipe is delicious!!! I don't even like clam chowder ususally, but I loved this - and so did the rest of the family.  I followed the recipe exactly as given.  Will definitely make again!  Will take this recipe with our family to the beach house.  Will be a great alternative to standing in line at a local restaurant!!

My whole family (which is pretty picky) loved this recipe!! Agree with others about adding more potatoes to it though. Other than that it is so quick and easy!! Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  Very easy and very good.  Everyone that tried it wanted the recipe.  I have given it to my mother-in-law, nephew and brother-in-law.

Great clam chowder recipe! Even better is that it's so easy to make (and doesn't taste like it's "store bought"). My husband, who is picky when it comes to clam chowder, loved it. It's definitely a keeper for us!

This soup was very good. It has a rich clam flavor fused into the dairy base. Probably the best and easiest clam chowder I could possibly make.

This was really good clam chowder.  I took some of the suggestions and added two potatoes, about half an onion and some celery.  It was a little thinner than I had hoped, but the taste made up for that.

Very good flavor.  Very easy to throw together.  I would definately add some diced potato to it next time, there just wasn't enough from the canned soups.  I think a little parsley sprinkled in would be nice too

Will make again- very good for a cold winters day.

It was good, but room for improvement. It was to thin. I would make the half and half even with the amount of whipping cream listed. Try adding diced potatoes.

Since I prefer a lowfat yet rich tasting soup, I used lowfat soups except for the Progresso clam chowder and added a potato, drained the clams and discarded the juice and only added 4 cups of fat free half and half for liquid. It was fantastic! I've probably made this four times now plus shared the recipe lots too. I add chicken or fish to it also for a heartier soup. Yum!

This is a great soup!!  You might want to add a few more potatoes and other ingredents to spice it up.  The soup was a little oily though but good.

I always make the original recipe at first to see if I'm going to like it. So I did make original recipe. It's too thin and not enough substance, like drinking milk. The flavor was good though.

Have made it twice now. First time, I had all the ingredients. Second time, I didn't have the canned potato soup. I did have a packet of powdered potato soup (the kind with the bear pictured on the front by a creek) and used that. Also good and made it even thicker.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious clam chowder and so easy to make! I was a bit hesitant when I saw that the recipe included canned soup because I'm not a canned soup lover, but I loved the flavor of this chowder with the first spoonful. I made some for a friend who is ill and she said it tasted better than restaurant chowder.

I have made this many times, it's a family favorite. I am normally making for a big crowd cause it's always a hit...so I always double and use the juice from 3 of the cans of clams, sometimes I throw a 5th can in a double batch... depends on your own preference. I also use only light cream, and a pound on fried diced bacon alone with a splash of red wine vinegar...try it...it's wonderful

I made several changes as I made enough for 20 servings.  I tried to stay with the original recipe as much as possible, but as others I did add some diced red potatoes, several cans of clams, about a cup and a half of Sherry.  Did not use cooking sherry as those products seams a little salty.  Added some green onion, Old Bay seasoning, diced celery, diced onion and some instant potatoes for thickening.  The soup came out wonderful and everyone had there fill.  Thank You DENNA for your recipe as it is absolutely the greatest.    Gil

This was easy and really good to eat.  I was skeptical using store bought clam chowder and soups but it was surprisingly delicious.   I would follow the suggestions of others next time by using two cans of the store chowder to create a thicker broth.

Awesome! I did not cook it for that long and did it on the stovetop instead and it was still wonderful!

This was way too salty due to all the canned, pre-prepared items. Lacked the fresh, briny taste of seafood.

This was amazing homemade chowder.  Added a dash of hot sauce and some sourdough bread and enjoyed on a rainy night.

Since I didn't have a crockpot, I made it stovetop. For me, clam chowder isn't complete without some veggies, so in addition to some reviewers' suggestions (double the cans of cream of potato and new england clam chowder, 1/3 cup -or more- of sherry) I added some grilled onions and celery to the mix. Talk about yummy!

I have been making this for a long time, but we also use canned boneless salmon instead of clams. We also add a chopped onion.   Makes for a different taste.  To Krisstina:  Mo's does not have the best clam chowder in my opinion.  Try the chowder at Fireside in Cannon Beach!!!  OMG, it is sooooo good!!!  I'm actually making this recipe tonight!  Serving it with some crusty french bread. Bon Appetite!!!

This was very good! Easy to make and very tasty. I added  4 cans of Cherrystone clams ( 2 with juice) and only 1 pint of half and half instead if the quart plus a cup of milk.

I live close to San Francisco...this is better. Really. Love it. I make it for friends and they think I'm this amazing cook. I add red potatoes, a little more clams, and a touch of red wine vinegar to make it a little more special. WONDERFUL - MAKE IT!!

Very good, and so easy! It was a little on the bland side- but this may be because I used low-sodium products. I also had to add cornstarch to thicken it up. Other than that it was yummy...rich and creamy.

This was excellent and super easy!!!  I doubled the amount of clam chowder soup and potato soup and added 4 cans of clams to this.  It barely fit into my crock pot!  I think next time I won't add as much cream to make it slightly thicker.  But I will definitely be making this again!

This is a convenient recipe. there are some modifications that can be easily made to reduce the fat and calorie content. I used low fat cream of celery soup and low fat half and half. I also added celery and onion that I lightly sauteed in butter first. I also added the chopped red skin potatoes and extra clams, as indicated in other reviews. Based on what some of the other reviews said, I used two cans of cream of celery and one can of cream of onion soup to avoid the "store bought taste" created by the canned cream of potato and clam chowder. It was yummy!

Thank You!  This is my go to recipe for clam chowder. I do add the bacon, onion, celery and diced potatoes, but this is a great start! I keep a extra can of everything on hand always!

This recipe is absolutely the best clam chowder I have ever made.  Quick and easy really describes it.  The few alterations I made:  added cooked bacon, sauteed celery and onions and used all half and half - Thickened with dried potato flakes.  Be careful if you double the recipe - it makes a lot.

Very good.  I followed the advice and added extra soups and clams.  Next time I will add shrimp, sea legs, etc and make a seafood chowder.  Yum! Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was easy and tasted mediocre. I will probably try it again without the canned New England clam chowder. It tasted a bit "canned" and I didn't like the texture of the potatoes in the canned soup along with my own chopped red potatoes. (The fresh potatoes were much better and made the other canned potatoes stand out.) We ate it with sourdough bread which made all the difference. My kids liked it. My husband and I thought it was just alright.

This recipe is very decadent but delicious.  I didn't have the cream of celery on hand but had cream of shrimp and it came out excellent.  Next time I would add cubed potatoes because that was the only thing lacking for me.

YUM YUM YUM.  The entire family loved it!  Added some red potatoes, sauted onions & celery to thicken it up.  This is restaurant quality.  They're already asking me to make it again this weekend, and simple!  perfect.

Even better the next day!!! If you like clams I would add at least another can.  I also added 5-6 small red potatoes and 1 onion. Next time I may also add celery.  Very good taste and incredibly easy.

So nice to come home to this one!  We do add potatoes for a little extra bulk, but otherwise stick to the recipe (which is a remarkable endorsement coming from an inveterate fiddler such as myself).  Thanks for a great recipe.

Doubled this recipe and entered it in a soup 'cook-off' to raise money for Souper Bowl at our church this past Sunday. I have never entered any type of cooking competition and in this case I entered without ever having made this soup before. I called it 'New England Patriots Clam Chowder'. After church, everyone tasted all 8 soups and voted on the best. This soup blew the competition away and took first place!  Thanks for a great recipe!

We thought this was great, although I did have to make a few changes.  They say necessity is the mother of invention and I had to reinvent it because I was missing quite a few ingredients.  So, I used 2 cans of clams w/juice, 1 family size can of Cream of Mushroom, 1 can of Clam Chowder, 1 pkg of Tater Tots, 1 cup of whole milk, 1 tsp ground Cumin, and 3 TBL of Red Wine Vinegar.  It turned out great!  Four out of five kids ate it, even my twin toddlers!

Very creamy! I added a few red potatos to added more body. And I accidently grabbed cream of chicken instead of cream of celery, it was great! Will make many more times!

My kids love clam chowder and said this was better than most restaurants!  I used canned soups from our local "generic" grocery store so the cost wasn't so bad.

My family thought this clam chowder was wonderful.  This is as good as many chowders we had while living in Maine.  I do add potatoes, a few sauteed onions and celery and extra clams.  I was hesitant to try with canned soups, but it is one of our favorites!!

I made this last night in my crockpot.  My neighbor tried it.. loved it. I added some celery, potatoes, onions.  Didn't think of adding some crabmeat, or shrimp, but I will when I reheat leftovers.  I used 3 cans of clams, 2 minced and one chopped. Only drained 1.  It was chunky.. but not chunky enough for me.  It was so easy.   And whoever said that this isn't the cheapest soup.. I agree. Unles you can stock up on these canned goods duringa  great sale, they add up!  But it made a ton of soup for both my family and my neighbor's family.  Good luck to everyone else who makes this simple recipe.  Have a great New Year 2006!

So good, and so easy!!  I did what other cooks suggested, and added crab meat, and shrimp.  I also added some corn at my husband's request. And for a little added flavor, I sauteed some chopped onion and celery in bacon fat, and added it as well!  So yummy!!!

Outstanding recipe!  Let me tell you how I extended it...  I browned an onion or two, then browned a sack of frozen (thawed) hash brown potatos.  I then added the rest of the ingredients.  This makes the soup go much further, and I LOVE potatoes in my chowder anyway.  This was a hit with EVERYONE!!!

I found this recipe made a delicious chowder base, but I'd try a few things differently next time. I like my chowder more on the chunky side than soupy, so I'd cut back on the cream and half and half.  I would take the submitter's advice and add more clams (I barely noticed them making the recipe exactly as is).  And I won't be adding extra cubed potatoes next time either.  They simply didn't cook after 8 hours. But overall it had great taste and I defintely will be trying it again.

This was excellent!  I served it with Christmas Dinner and was afraid it would taste "canned" which my mom would be sure to notice, but it really didn't!  I think it was the cream and half and half.  I used twice the clams it called for, but that may not be necessary!

Excellent Clam Chowder recipe, I will add potatoes and more clams next time. If you can stir a couple of times some of the clams had burned and stuck to the side of the pot.

Not the best clam chowder that I have had, it is a really plain base that I made a second time and spruced up with some celery and potatoes and added some seasoning salt, pepper and a little bit of garlic.

Excellent clam chowder! I added 2 cubed potatoes, some turkey bacon, another can of chopped clams w/juice and only added 1/2 of the quart of half and half. It was delicious! Everyone loved it, even my Connecticut-native husband! Definately a tasty keeper!

I really liked this recipe. I kept feeling that I needed to stir it though because when it boiled up it would start to leave a foam around the edges. But other than that it is great.

Excellent clam chowder. Very easy to make, not time-consuming at all. I put it together in about 10 minutes and let it cook on low in the crockpot for ~6 hours! Yummy! I added a few spices of my own too.

I added cubed potatoes, extra minced clams drained and in the last 20 minutes added fresh small neck clams for presentation. It was excellent and a huge success with dinner guests.

Just made this today and it was excellent.  Along with the other reviewers, I made a few adjustments, but it was so easy.  Put it all together the night before and let it cook for 8 hours on low in the slow cooker.  Can't understand what the big deal is about the cooking time, it is so easy to assemble and makes your house smell wonderfully.  Added 1/4 cup chopped onion, 3 cans chopped clams and 2 cans minced clams, all with juice.  Added 1/4 cup sherry before serving and crumbled bacon over the top.  Placed in sourdough bread bowls.  Excellent!

This recipe was a great starter recipe.. I was having a craving for clam chowder and found this recipe. I could not wait the 6-8 hours though.. so i altered a little bit and just used 1 1/2 cans of the new england clam chowder, 2 cans of cream of potato and 1 can cream of celery, added only the pint of heavy whipping cream and some 2% milk..This turned out just perfect for me, and I didn't have to wait the 6-8 hours.. wonderful recipe Deena.. Thanks a bunch

As most of the other reviews stated--this one is "a keeper".  I too added 3/4 of a bag of the frozen cubed hash browns and cut back on the half & half.  The consistancy of the soup was nice and thick.  My guests (from Mass) raved about the taste, however the way I made the recipe it was more of a cross between clam chowder and potato soup, then a true clam chowder--they said it didn't have enough of that "fishy" taste...personally, I think that is a compliment.  I couldn't ask for an easier recipe with such a great flavor!  Thx Deena

My husband and I loved this clam chowder.  It was so creamy and had a wonderful flavor.  I would make this again in a heartbeat and the fact that you can prepare it in a slowcooker is even better.

Not so great.  I added celery and onion, and another can of clams and it still wasn't a great recipe.  It was too thin, too sweet from the cream, and took too long to cook.  I'll stick to canned calm chowder from now on.  Or else eat out.  =0)

This is a great soup!!  My husband says it is the best he has ever had and clam chowder is his favorite.  I only used 1/2 the amount of the half and half and added some potatoes.  Will make often as it couldn't be easier!!!

YUM!  I had never made chowder before and was a bit intimidated and this was yum..My husband doesnt even like it and he lapped this up.  We are from Louisiana so I think next time I would add some shrimp or crawfish to it because it was a bit liquidy.  Also, I added a potato and would probably add a couple more next time.  My two year old LOVED this!!!

Pretty good recipe.  It was too thin for my taste.  I will make it again, however, I will be very liberal in adding clams and potatoes.  Also, I will probably adjust the half & half to cream ratio to make it thicker.  It was very simple and had very good flavor.

Yes, it looks too easy to be good but believe me it is.  This is the best clam chowder I have ever eaten.  Very easy to make and very easy to eat.  I added cubed potatoes and celery.  Try it you won't regret it.

This soup was a hit, everybody loved it. I will definitely make it again. I added cubed potatoes and used only half of the whipping cream replacing the balance with whole milk. It was alsolutely perfect. We served it with oyster crackers.

This chowder was delicious.  The whole family loved it.  I added diced potatoes and fried bacon pieces.  Thank you for providing this wonderful recipe.  We will be enjoying it often this winter.

Must admit I was very skeptical since the recipe seemed too easy to be really good-but it was!!  I threw in a few extra potatoes and some diced onion and would definitely add an extra can of clams next time.
