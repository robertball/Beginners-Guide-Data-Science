I made the recipe as written, except that I decreased the oil to about 1/3 cup. I tasted and really didn't care for it. It was too "heavy" tasting. I added 3T of lemon juice and voila! It was awesome!!! I highly recommend adding the lemon juice, but if you like, make as directed (I do recommend decreasing the olive oil to 1/3 cup AT MOST), and taste. If you like it as is, don't make additional changes. If you don't, add the lemon juice! It has a much lighter, fresher taste! Oh yeah... I only cooled the quinoa slightly before adding the remaining ingredients, as I wanted to serve it as a hot dish. It worked fine!

Loved it. Added a little lemon juice and some garbanzo beans(it does not need the garbanzo beans but I like them). Refrigerated it and served it at room temperature with salmon. Had a little leftover and it is even better the next day!

I really liked is recipe.  I did add the lemon juice by freshly squeezing half of a lemon into the quinoa.  It was quite tasty and I will be making it again.  I also used very little olive oil.  I drizzled it all over the quinoa and used only about 1/4 a cup.

Amazing! I left out the olive oil as I didn't see reasoning for extra calories. But this is going to be my definite new go to Lunch!!!

Very good! We added chopped onion in as well and forgot the olive oil the first time. It was still great. We just drizzle the olive oil on to keep it light.

Incredibly easy and insanely good. I cut way back on the oil, added some lemon juice. I used pre-sliced black olives because I'm lazy. It was to die for and made a great lunch for the next few days. Thanks!!

This recipe was delicious!! Simple, clean and light. We had it as a side dish with some Red Snapper and it was a perfect compliment. I had to sub green olives for the Kalamata only because that's all we had( will defiantly try those next round). Thank you for sharing!!

Makes a lot more quinoa than you think. Use as a side dish for leftovers. Don't skimp on the ingredients. Everything goes well together!

Quite tasty... I'm just learning about quinoa and trying different things.  I found that I needed to add salt and pepper.  Maybe next time I'll try the lemon juice.  But it is tasty, filling and good for you!

This was so good, the only change I made was to reduce the olive oil to 1/4 cup. The flavors blended together so great!

I forgot the basil and still couldn't get enough! My daughter and husband don't like olives so they didn't like this. My husband said he could taste the juice of them after picking them out. More for me!

As someone else said, the recipe as is, is very bland. I ended up adding extra olives, salt, garlic, salt, and lemon juice to taste. Also the olive oil could be halved. I will make it again though!

Delicious and easy to make on the fly.  I cooked the quinoa and saved it in a container, as I did with the sliced tomatoes and olives, the feta, etc. That way I can put a bowl together everyday, anytime I get hungry. I also added a lemon salad dressing I found, delicious!

I used the suggestions of others who made this salad with adding the zest and juice of one lemon and decreasing the amount of olive oil.  I made these changes while doubling the recipe. It was delicious and I'll definitely make it again.

I made as written, but took others advice and cut down on I olive oil. I still found it lacking in brightness, so added about a teaspoon of lemon zest and probably about 3 tablespoons of lemon juice, as well. I also took the liberty of adding about 1 tablespoon of oregano. Delicious and healthy!

I too added cucumber and extra Greek olives. I used green onions because I didn't have red onion. I used my homemade vegetarian broth and served it for  vegetarian Greek dinner for 6 and had plenty left to take to a Kentucky Derby potluck the next day and people raved. I'll be making it often this summer!

Excellent recipe! I think a very important key here is to let your quinoa completely cool and make sure it isn't wet. I also did not refrigerate the quinoa after it cooled. I did add the juice of one lemon and reduced the oil to about 1/3 of a cup like others suggested. After I mixed it all together and the oil was soaked up and all the ingredients married together, I refrigerated it. I will definitely make this again.

Very good. I also cut the oil out to a little less than 1/3 cup. I added chickpeas and 3 tbsp of lemon juice. It's amazing !

I love the flavors of Greek food and this is a option to add protein.  Good!

I make this on a semi-weekly basis and absolutely love it!  I used regular tomatoes and just chopped them (not a fan of cherry tomato).  It's incredibly easy to make and goes fantastic with Triscuit crackers or on fresh spinach rolled in a flour tortilla wrap.  Yum!

My husband absolutely loves this, I recommend goat cheese instead of feta and a drizzle of balsamic dressing.

Reduced the olive oil a bit as others suggested.  It was very bland for my taste. Guess I should have tried adding the lemon juice.
