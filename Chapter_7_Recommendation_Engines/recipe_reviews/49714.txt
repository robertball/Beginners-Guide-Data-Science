As a Korean myself, I find this recipe a little odd. I used to watch my mother make Kimchee and she never used fresh ginger, vinegar, or sugar in the mix. You want to break off the leaves of the cabbage and place them in a bowl, sprinkling a little salt on each leaf as you go. After salting the cabbage, fill the dish with water and then let it soak for 3-4 hours. Massage the cabbage then drain and rinse. Chop cabbage into 2-3 inch segments then toss well with the rest of the ingredients (I wouldn't suggest using ginger, vinegar, or sugar; but do what you think you'll like). Then pack it tightly into a jar, you don't want a lot of air within the jar, so use the right size jar. Kimchee is a fermented cabbage dish, therefore, if you leave it out in a warm area for 24-48 hours instead of refridgerating, the taste will be authentic. It's more of an acquired taste. It will also last way more than a week, I'd say about a month easy. We ate it straight out of the bottle; it goes well with some rice! :)

This recipe is very good. I have another idea to substitute the vinegar with a natural ones.
Boiled 3/4 cup water with 1/4 cup rice powder( may double),cook until thick and set aside until completely cool. Mix with another spices and cabbage. After more than 24 hour it becomes natural sweet and sour.

I did not care for the taste at first but the longer I let it sit in the frig the better it tastes, not I can not keep enough. It lasts way longer than one week, I made mine at least 3 months ago still going strong.

This sauce/brine is excellent.  The only change I made was adding a few dried hot peppers and putting all ingredients in a blender (because I prefer to bite into nothing but the cabbage).  When I read the ingredients I honestly wasn't so sure if this was going to taste like Kimshi exactly, & I used regular Chili powder & had to substitute 1/2 apple cider vinegar & 1/2 red wine vinegar (since that is all I had).  But I can tell after about 12 hours only that this is truly Kimshi.  This stuff is going to be absolutely fantastic in another day.  I accidentally used red cabbage & can just imagine how dynamite this stuff is with Chinese cabbage.  Kimshi is not always easy to find here, so this is just wonderful to know this recipe is so good & I can make it at home now.

I've never had Kimchee before so I have nothing to compare it to, and I have no idea if this is authentic or not! Despite the fact I was a bit heavy-handed with the ginger, I actually really enjoyed this. I followed another reviewer's advice and simply left the jarred Kimchee out on the kitchen counter for a couple of days. The flavor was wonderful (if a little too gingery!). I served this with 'Korean BBQ Beef (Pul-Kogi)' from this site. I'll defintiely make it again. Thanks, John!

Very easy to make, but you have to like cabbage to enjoy this scrumptious meal.

followed recipe exactly and was disturbed by the results -texture alone was a turnoff. overpowering flavour and totally unappealing.

Made as written except I originally read over the part where you let it set 24 hours before using and I liked it just fine that way. It wasn't until the next day when eating the leftovers and it had been 24 hours that I realized my mistake. It is perfectly fine (maybe even better) right away. Not sure this is authentic but it was good and we enjoyed it.
