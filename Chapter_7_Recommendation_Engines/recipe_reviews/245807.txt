This stuff is great. It's rich and creamy like ice cream and GF too! Perfect for lactose and GF folks. Loved it! Will certainly make it again.

This is so good! I made it using my KitchenAid ice cream attachment, but it still needed to set up in the freezer for a couple of hours. Definitely something I will make again!
