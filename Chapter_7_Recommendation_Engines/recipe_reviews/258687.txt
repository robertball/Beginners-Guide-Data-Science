7.2.17  I used fresh blueberries, so I did add a bit of crushed ice to compensate for them not being frozen.  The berries were so sweet that I didnâ€™t need the sugar, and I had a bit of vanilla almond milk in the fridge, so I used that instead of whole milk.  Who knew that blueberries and coffee would partner so well??  Very nice and refreshing drink enjoyed on a lazy Sunday afternoon.

I enjoyed this drink. The blueberries were more prevalent than the coffee.  I will try it again and decrease the blueberries to 1/4 cup so I can get more of the coffee flavor. This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

This is a fabulous and refreshing pick me up! I was hesitant about the coffee and blueberries together but it's an amazing combination. Such a fun drink for the summer. This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.

Like all the other reviewers, I had my doubts about coffee and blueberries. But for some crazy reason, it works. I did have to add more sweetener, but that was easy enough to do.

Just not a fan of fruit in my coffee.  Now, blueberry pie WITH my coffee is another story! Or even berries in yogurt.

I had my doubts . . . I mean, blueberries & coffee . . . really? Don't ask me how - but this works! I'm truly amazed. I topped it with some whipped cream and a few frozen blueberries. Yum! This Allstar has been compensated for participation in the Allrecipes Allstar Program.
