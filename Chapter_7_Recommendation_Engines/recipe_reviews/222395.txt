What an excellent breakfast this made!  I toasted a slice  of baguette in the pan that I cooked the Prosciutto in which was a great addition.  My asparagus wasn't very thick so it only took about 10 total to roast.  Thanks for another great recipe, Chef John.

Just finished this dish and loved it.  Minor changes - used bacon since that's all I had on hand and didn't use any oil, just a little bacon fat w/the bacon pieces and salt and pepper on the asparagus.  As someone else mentioned - great low carb dish and healthy (if you don't use too much bacon;).  Next time I might try some grated Parmesan on top.

I had this for dinner tonight with a baguette.  It's great for one person but also easy enough to make for a group.  Don't skip the lemon zest at the end!

This was incredible! Hubs made it as one of the 2 meals he cooks every week. I was amazed at how filling a few shoots of asparagus and an egg was. And the lemon zest pushed it right over the top. He made it exactly as written and we will eat this often. Chef John rules! Again!

I could eat this any time of day, breakfast, lunch or dinner. Made it twice in the past week; so good, especially with all the fresh spring asparagus around.  It's just so simple and elegant.  I've had asparagus with proscuitto and asparagus with lemon, and asparagus with egg (not poached), but never all together. Very creative and easy recipe that turns my favorite vegetable into a substantial and delicious meal.  Thanks again Chef John, another great recipe.  I'm becoming a huge fan!

What an underrated recipe! This was the best asparagus recipe I have ever had the pleasure of making and eating. The egg part was a bit tricky to make but on the second try it came out perfect, just be patient with that part if its your first time cooking your egg in such a way. Watch the video its very helpful.

Eggs and asparagus are a family favorite. Roasting the asparagus gives it a new dimension.  The addition of prosciutto crudo is a nice, salty, touch but I couldn't bring myself to frying it. Crudo is so delicious as is, we left it that way. We also added some Parmigiano Reggiano. The method for the poached egg is spot on.

I had to talk my husband into having this for dinner last night, he felt it wasn't enough to eat. So I made toast and spread mashed avocado and then put the roasted asparagus, crumbled prosciutto and perfectly cooked pouched eggs on top. It was one of the most memorable dinners I've had in quite some time! And we both are good cooks!  We will be doing this again and again. Thank you chef John!

Delicious and fairly healthy. This would also be good with a hollandaise sauce. Easy recipe, and quick to put together.

Sorry - didn't have prosciutto - used bacon cut in half inch pieces.  Really liked the texture and color.

Made it as is and it was a hit with the adults and the 12-y.o.!  It's a tiny little serving, and left us all wanting more!  This is definitely a repeat and as the cook in our house, I appreciate that it is quick and easy, but tastes like I spent a lot of time making it!

I absolutely loved the recipe. It will take a lot of practice from me to get that perfectly poached egg but really it is worth it. It is a satisfying meal on itself. Bread on the side makes it even better. Follow the recipe as is. Watch the video before making it and if possible watch Chef John's video on  how to poach an egg or read the article about it posted in this site. Highly recommended!!!!

We've had this for breakfast and for dinner. I like to sprinkle with Parmesan cheese before serving. A great way to use up a bumper crop of asparagus; even when spears get close to opening, the tender mid sections can still be used in this dish.

Quick, easy, healthy and delicious. Loved it and love how easy it is to remember all the ingredients when I'm at the grocery store. I keep making it !!
