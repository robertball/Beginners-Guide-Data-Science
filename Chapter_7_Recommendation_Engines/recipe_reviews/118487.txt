Delicious....I used red onion, half a pound of bacon crumbled and I really decreased the sugar....I maybe used about 1/4c. and it was plenty sweet  (couldn't even imagine 3/4c. of sugar in this recipe) and tangy from the vinegar. Assembled this the day before and served for Mother's Day BBQ....everyone love it. Thanks!

i just wanted to suggest if you don't want to wait a day to eat this because of the sugar not disolving use karo syrup instead of sugar and u should be able to eat as soon as chilled.just substitute one for the other.

This is delicious! A huge hit. I however did make a lower fat version of it by using fat-free Miracle Whip (gives it a tangier flavor) instead of sugar I used splenda and I used bacon bits and reduced fat cheese.  Either way, it's really good and everyone loved it! Great dish for summer.

I add rotini pasta and cut down on the sugar adding just enough mayo to make it creamy. They charge $5.99/lb at the store which doesn't give you much! Very good recipie even for those who don't usually like brocoli!

This is a great salad. Yes its sweet, might be the sugar but either way its good. I had a huge bag of broccoli to use up and in my opinion this salad could have used more broccoli. I will make this again! I did not use bacon and I added rasins. It did sit over night before eating. I also can see that this salad could be versitle for lots of different additions. This is a good salad.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!! I have made this salad often and I have only heard rave reviews. I have had many requests for the recipe. I usually use the cider vinegar and I let it marinade for over 4 hours. It only gets better with time.

Wonderful! As far as the sugar never dissolving, I did reduce sugar to 1/4 cup, plus a TBsp. I wisked the sugar with the cider vinegar. Dissolved perfectly! Then I added the mayo. I also added a few craisins before serving. Maybe 1/4-1/2 cup just for a little extra zing. Yummy!

Simple and delicious.  Just what I was looking for to use up some broccoli.  I've made dressings before that are a mayonnaise/sugar/vinegar combination so I made the dressing ahead of time so that the sugar would dissolve.  I made the dressing the night before and stirred a couple of times, in the morning I added the broccoli, onion and cheese to the dressing.  I stirred in some of the bacon before serving and sprinkled some on top.  It was enjoyed by all.

I loved this salad! I didn't change any of the ingredients like many of the other reviewers (IMO if you change the recipe you shouldn't really review it). I mixed the mayo, sugar and cider vinegar, and let it sit while I cut the broccoli, bacon, and onion. By the time I was done chopping, the sugar was dissolved. I only refrigerated for about an hour before I dug in and it was still amazing.

I made this recipe for a carry in dinner and it was the first thing gone. They loved it! The only thing I did differently was to use cubed cheddar cheese rather than shredded because it was all I had.

good recipe. I blanched the broccoli as this makes it taste better. I tried to reduce carbs--used rice wine vinegar, no added sugar, 1 tsp light . miracle whip, cayenne pepper for added taste. used red onions sliced very thinly, turkey bacon and only 1/4 cup of cheese.  I added lightly browned seasame seeds and almond slivers for additional crunch.

Very tasty salad! I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 miracle whip because I ran out of mayo but I thought it was delicious. I cut way down on the sugar..I used less than 1/2 than what it called for and I still thought it was plenty sweet. It was a hit at dinner tonight.

I love this broccoli salad.  I have made it multiple times and it is always a hit.  I use the olive oil mayo instead of the regular and it tastes great.  I tried it with Splenda, but did not like it as much, so I switched back to the sugar that the recipe called for.

The recipe didn't specify which onion to use so I used green onions. I also used a mixture of FF sour cream and low-fat mayo instead of all mayo and I cut way back on the sugar. I think I was good at four tbsp. I threw in the last remains of a package of sunflower seeds I found in my cupboard. This was good, but I think it would have been better without the sugar all together or with a homemade ranch dressing. NOTE: The sugar ruined this salad. It never dissolved which lead to a weird texture. Plus, it just didn't work. In my head, I guess broccoli salad isn't supposed to be sweet.

It was great!  I modified it a little bit, I added some cauliflower in with the broccoli and ended up leaving out the bacon, I didn't want it soggy and it was for a potluck so it sat a while.  Plus I left the onion out since I had picky eaters.  It did get a little watery, but I transferred bowls with a slotted spoon so that took care of that.  Even my anti-veggie hubby liked it!  Will make again!

Not quite what I was looking for, just way too sweet, when putting it together I had that thought with the amount of sugar it calls for and should have only put a tablespoon in. My daughter loves broccoli but would not eat this. Will make again with less sugar.

This is very similar to a salad I make. I just toss in some celery and for the dressing, add a packet of Italian dressing mix. It gives it lots more flavor.
