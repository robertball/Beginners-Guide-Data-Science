YUM! Substituted frozen strawberries in syrup for the cherry pie filling because it's what I had on hand. I also added an entire package of mini marshmallows as another suggested. Simply fabulous! Make sure to drain the crushed pineapple thouroughly! This is a very tasty treat and very similar to this website's "Antoinette's Strawberry Freeze" (which is wonderful)! Thank you for the great post! Will be making this one again and will try it with cherry pie filling as the recipe calls for! I may even try it with blackberry pie filling! Very kid-friendly too!

This was awesome!  It's always such a big hit at get-togethers.  One ingredient that I have seen in other recipes for this was missing though - 1 cup miniature marshmallows.  It's a must!  The 2nd time I made this, I used fat-free sweetened condensed milk, fat-free whipped topping, and unsweetened crushed pineapple.  Wow - still awesome, and so much less fat!  Will do that from now on.  Thanks for the recipe!

This came out really pretty but I thought it was missing something. The condense milk was way too much. I will cut back next time when I make it again to 1/2 or 3/4 of the can. The recipe was easy to make. Thanks!

Very simple to make! Just keep in mind that it has to chill in fridge at least 2 hours! It is perfect the way it is, but I like too add 1/4 cup coconut, and 1/2 cup chopped pecans.

Substitute the condensed milk for fat-free, light cherry filling, and light cool whip and you have a low-fat treat.

This was so easy.. My daughter loved it. I thought it was alittle sweet and I could taste the condensed milk in it. I will make it again just with alittle less condensed milk and will try it with some type of nuts and marshmellows.

Very easy recipe!  Be sure to drain the pineapple well and allow enough time to chill, otherwise it can be a bit runny.  My mom always made this with chopped pecans, but I prefer it without the nuts.  If it is too rich for your taste, you can cut back on the sweetened condensed milk.

I have made this same recipe, but added some chopped nuts. Instead of chilling the salad, I put it in a 9x13 pan and freeze it. Stirring once while it is setting up. Take it out 10-15 min before serving to thaw slightly. This makes for a cool, yummy dessert. I also make it with whole cranberry sauce at Christmas time. Everyone loves this salad. Oh I almost forgot--I add juice from 1-2 lemons or 2T  concentrated lemon juice to cut the sweetness. I prefer the real lemons, but when you are in a hurry I cut corners.

This was pretty good though I did alter the recipe as I thought the amount of the condensed milk would be too sweet.  I only used 7oz of the condensed milk and thought it would have been great without it anyway.  I also added Marshmallows to it.  I will make this again, but not use the Condensed milk.

This was really sweet but good. My mother did not like the appearance of the finished product so I added some whipping cream to give it more fluff.  We also used strawberry pie filling rather than cherry.  A good summer salad.

Delicious! I wanted to see if I could make a "Jello" out of it and it worked. If you take a 1/2 c of hot water and dissolve cherry or pineapple Jello and mix it in with all the ingredients, it will become more like a "molded" Jello dessert. VERY tasty. Thanks!

A simple, easy dessert using on-hand ingredients!  I tried it and LOVE IT!  Husband ate it up.  Going to try it next time with fresh strawberries!  This is like "dump cake" - but it's a pie!  I put it in a crushed graham crust and it was fab.

When I read the recipe, I thought, YUM! But after I followed the recipe exactly, and then let it chill for a few hours, I was really unhappy with the way it turned out; however, I needed a dessert, so I attempted to salvage it. I added chopped nuts, 1/2 package of sour cream, and a cup of yogurt. Then I made a graham cracker crust, poured the "fluff" in to the pie pan and then put it in the freeze for a few hours. Once it hardened up it was pretty good, but I don't think I'll make it again.

This was truly a surprise. I didn't know what to expect and was very hesitant when putting in the condensed milk. I only put in half a can. This was wonderful. I added marshmallows like a previous reviewer suggested. It is great for a cookout.

Very simple to make. I would definitely classify this as a dessert over a salad. Great for a simple, summer picnic dessert. Yummy.

Haven't had this dessert since I was a child; tasted just as I remember it.  Have made it several times and tried it with chopped pecans as some suggested, but prefer it without.  Recipe is great as is.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  (not very 'pretty' when it's first mixed up, but a pretty pink salad/dessert when it 'sets up' after being refrigerated for several hours.)  Oh -- I added about a cup of mini marshmallows!  (might add 1/2 cup of chopped pecans next time)

I loved this one, it's best with regular cherry pie filling, not NSA.  Also, I added 1 cup large curd cottage cheese.

This salad is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect, nice and fluffy. I did make sure the pineapple was very well drained as I think this is very important for fluffy results.  Delicious with chopped pecans added. I took it to a potluck where it disappeared quickly. Since making this many times I have started using 3/4 of the can of sweetened condensed milk. Still sweet but not too sweet. Still turns out fluffy and beautiful.

Awesome recipe, my family loves it.  Also great for any substitution of fruit and/or nuts.  Condensed milk a little sweet so I use more Cool Whip, and it works great! :)

This is one of the easiest things to make ever. I freeze mine in a casserole dish for a few hours, then thaw 20 minutes before serving. I prefer that consistency - more of an ice cream treat. Chopped pecans are also delicious in this.

This was a perfect dessert or light snack!  I added marshmellows and a small bag of pecan halves.  I also used the low fat cherry pie filling, lite cool whip and low fat sweetened condensed milk.  Thanks for the Recipe, i've made many fruit salads before and never had one this easy!  Will be trying strawberry and maybe blueberry next!    I liked this so much my coworker paid me to make it for her.

Very tasty! Have used this recipe for many months. What I always do is I take the whole can of pie filling and chop it all up into little pieces. This way it is more of a fluffy dessert than a chunky one. My family loves it with either chopped pecans or walnuts. Can also easily make this low calorie!!! So good but not too sweet.

This is THE best and easiest dessert recipe EVER! And there's so much you can do with it. I added slivered almonds the one time, then chopped walnuts a different time. I didn't have pineapple on another occasion and substituted drained fruit cocktail instead. Still turned out a great success.  As you can see, I've made it several times so far and it's always a big winner at potlucks, BBQs, or ANYTIME! Thank you so much for posting this recipe!!!

I used no sugar added cherry pie filling, low-fat condensed milk and light cool whip.  Color is pretty but next time I'll add some chopped nuts.

For those that say it has a liquid consistency, it is very important to drain the pineapple thoroughly.  I even squeeze mine and put it on paper towels.  The dessert ends up nice and fluffy.  And easy to make.  And super tasty.  :)  I agree with the others that say pecans make a nice addition.

I love to make this, but I use either peach or strawberry pie filling. I also have used sugar free cool-whip and fat free sw. cond. milk, and people never knew the difference.

So simple and delicious! I made it for a co-worker's birthday. I put it in a Graham Cracker pie crust, and let it sit overnight. It's a hit! I used Lite Cool Whip instead of the real deal, but it was still delicious! I'll be making this for Christmas. I see it more as a dessert than a side dish.

Been making this same dish for years at our annual huge Thanksgiving feast! We love it! It makes a nice compliment to most of the salty gravies and meats. We also serve Watergate Salad (pistacio) salad with this. They're both great!

You know, I posted a great Pistachio fruit fluff recipe on here that I thought was the "bomb" until I tried this......omg, can someone say AWESOME!! It's a great recipe because it's so versatile with adding more ingredients or substituting, etc. Thank-you so much for posting this. I've never heard of it before and it was a hit:)

The hubby loved this!! I thought it was just ok. I think the sweetened milk made it too waek and gave it a syrup like consistency in my opinion but the hubby wants it again for X-mas. I think I will add some coconut.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I also added some mini marshmellows. Next time I think I will reduce the amount of condensed milk as it was a bit too sweet.

I added chopped pecans to the top for a pretty presentation.  Very simple recipe with great results!  Have also tried the fat-free version using fat-free condensed milk and fat-free cool whip.  Tastes just as good although the consistency is a bit "runnier" than the original version.

I thought this was delicious! I made it for a baby shower, and everyone loved it (except for one guy who didn't wanna eat something that looked so pink and fluffy, lol)...I had several people ask me for the recipe. I will certainly make this again!

This is a fun, top-notch recipe. It gives a new twist to an old favorite and is perfect for the holidays or a BBQ. I did add marshmallows and some finely chopped pecans. YUM!

Okay.  Very rich.  Tastes familiar, like something we've all had before...sort of like a deli salad.  Nothing extraordinary, but very easy to prepare.

This is similiar to a recipe I have made many times before. The only difference between your recipe and mine is the added ingredient of chopped pecans. Actually, the recipe isn't mine, but I did find it on this site. It is called Pink Salad. I make it every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas or when I need a very tasty, quick side dish for a pot luck dinner at work.

This recipe is delicious, it was a hit with my whole family, especially the kids.  I did substitute a can of diced peaches and a can of mandarin oranges, drained, for the crushed pineapple. This recipe is great either way.

Its my fav,  Dose not get better then this! some people like to add nuts... not me!  and I use crushed pineapple in the can and squeeze out all the juice from it, this keeps the semi firmness. And BTW, I made my own whipping cream , and it made it just that much better! thanks!

I like this recipe but it is even better if you combine the sweet and condensed milk with an 8 ounce package of cream cheese before mixing everything else together. And I like to add pecans also.

I made it as written, but added the 2 cups of mini marshmallows that are in many other versions of this recipe, and which my cousin uses.  I refrigerated it for 2 hours and took it to a neighborhood potluck Easter dinner.  Everyone who tried it told me how good it was!

Didn't think it "looks" appetizing. I felt that the "condensed milk" made it taste unpleasant. I talked to other people that have made similar recipes that don't call for condensed milk. And also they would use jello(dry). Won't make this recipe again.

I made this for a potluck at work and everyone raved about it. Even though this is a dessert, I tried making this as 'healthy' as I could. I used sugar free cool whip, 'no sugar added' cherry pie filling, fat free sweetened condensed milk, shredded pineapple in juice (drained in a colander). I did add about 1 1/2 cups of mini marshmallows - which are fat free - as others suggested. 
I will definitely make this again, and my co-workers, who love their sugary foods, loved this lighter version.
Thank you for the recipe.

It is really good but very sweet and felt like it could use some texture added to it. Next time I will add marshmallows and maybe either coconut or chopped pecans.

I made this with raspberry pie filling, halved the sweetened condensed milk, used light cool whip, and also subbed 6oz of pineapple juice instead of the can of actual pineapple chunks.  Definitely not overly sweet, it was just perfect.  Spooned up nicely too, not too chunky and too runny.  Everyone I have served it to has loved it.  It's so easy to throw together and you can do it in a pinch.  Keep the ingredients on hand (relatively long shelf life for all of them) and if you find out the evening before that you have a potluck the next day?  You're good to go!

Delicious! I have made this a banana split variation by adding sliced strawberries and sliced bananas that have been dipped in the pineapple juice just before serving. One tip: I like to mix the whipped topping, cherry filling and sweetened condensed milk night before because flavors meld better. Enjoy!!

This was very good.  I made it with strawberry pie filling.  I did use the larger quanity of cool whip mentioned and ended up adding a container of draianed frozen  strawberries for more flavor.  I also used this to fill sugar cookie tarts with and it was very good.  (bake sugar cookie dough in mini muffins tins.  Out of the oven indent with a melon baller to make a deeper indentation.  Then top with a cookie scoop of this fluff or most anything.)

I LOVE this recipe.  I doubled the recipe to feed a crowd but separated the mix.  I added a fair amount mini marshmallows and in one batch added chopped toasted pecans and in the other batch I left the nuts out.  The batch WITH pecans won hands down.

Wonderful!  Similar to a cranberry salad my mom makes but less work and not as tart.  Very refreshing and surprisingly not too sweet!  Will for sure make again.

This recipe is fantastic! For those of you who don't like cherries- you will probably like this! My family is not a big fan of cherry pie, but they love this recipe. What I add to this is a can of mandarine oranges. Yum! I don't add nuts or coconut if I'm taking it to a get together because so many people son't like them but if I'm at home, I add lots! Very versatile recipe. I can't wait to try it with blackberry pie filling like someone else suggested- that could definately be a favorite!

Don’t let the ingredients fool you on this one.  When I first read the recipe I was sure this was going to tastes terrible, despite the great reviews.  I mean come on…cherry pie filling and sweetened condensed milk?  But I love trying new recipes and have several friends that allow themselves to be willing genny pigs.  Well, I made it some time ago and sure enough, it was really very good.  Everyone liked it and a couple of people even asked for seconds.  So, in the recipe box it goes and I am sure I will be making it again in the future.  Next time I will take the suggestion of others and add some chopped pecans to it.

I love this recipe because it is so easy and delicious!  I made it for a BBQ last week and everyone loved it.  I've used blueberry pie filling as well with good result but the cherry is my favorite!  It also works well with fat free condensed milk and fat free cool whip with good results.  I sprinkle extra marshmallows on top with some chopped cherries for garnish.

I got this recipe from a nurse I worked with.  She always brought it to our potluck lunches and everyone loved it.  Now I serve it at Christmas because of it's light red hue.  My family always asks for seconds...even my picky 5 yr.old.

Absolutely fantastic recipe. It's easy and can be tailored to suit many tastes. I add pineapple, marshmallows and chopped walnuts. I also use a quart of homemade cherry pie filling instead of store bought.   YUMMY!

I don't know what it is about this recipe, but it just tastes great.  It took me a whole of maybe five minutes to prepare and it went just as fast.  Everyone in the family enjoyed it!

This is a quick and easy recipe, it tastes great. After reviewing the recipe thought it might be to sweet, but quickly changed my mind once it was made and allowed to set. Will make this again and soon.

This recipe is just so quick and easy (inexpensive, too) to make that it can only be given a five-star rating.  Everyone in "my neck of the woods" seems to like it...great for buffets and potock dinners!

Very easy to make and tasty! I have used a recipe like this for years for baby showers and gatherings. I always used walnuts instead of pineapple. I used the pineapple in my last dish and it was great! A keeper!

I followed another review and used all fat free ingredients.  It was still very good!  My only complaint was that the crushed pineapple disappears in the fluff.  Maybe pineapple tidbits would be better.
