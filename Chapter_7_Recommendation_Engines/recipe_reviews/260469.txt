Yum, the smell reminds me of wonderful times in Mexico.  We love Chipolte peppers, but ONE and a half is plenty of spice for us.  Spicy is great, but 7 oz would kill us! (I learned this the hard way in a different recipe) I strongly advise starting with one and doing taste tests to find your limit.  Whenever I open a can to cook Mexican foods, I spoon one out with some of the sauce and freeze the rest to use.  I have forms for my taco salad shells and bake after painting with a little olive oil at 400 degrees, for 10-12 minutes.  You could probably make them out of foil too.  I hope Chef John gives some pointers for making great salad shells in one of his next videos!

Excellent recipe!  We made it as written and would caution that it is very spicy.   If you're using the recipe in burritos as we did, it's perfect as the other ingredients mellow out the heat.  If I were making it for tacos or another recipe that it was more front and center, I would reduce the amount of peppers by 1 or 2.  All that being said, we made burritos with rice, beans and cheese and then topped each one with a bit of the sauce and some more cheese and tossed them under the broiler for a minute and it was truly amazing.  Served it with a side of shredded lettuce, tomato,  onions and fresh guacamole and garnished with fresh cilantro and cotija cheese . Far better than anything you can get at a restaurant.

I'm not a big fan of chipotle peppers - but this recipe made me change my mind about that!!  I made enchiladas with them and no one could get enough of them.  I like that the recipe is pretty forgiving - if you cook the chicken too long it doesn't really matter because it's in a wonderful sauce that infuses the meat and keeps it moist.

Sooo delicious. I served it as a taco salad and topped it with cilantro, cotija cheese and a lime wedge. I followed the recipe exactly, including using the whole can of chipotle peppers, and while it had a nice kick I didn't think it was overwhelmingly spicy. This dish is so flavorful and I would not hesitate to make it again.

I followed this recipe except I halved it because of the reviews on the large portions. I also used chicken breast. It did turn out spicy but super delicious with some avocado, cheese and sour cream! I will definitely make this again. I can imagine the leftovers being good in quesadillas, taco salads, burritos, enchiladas, anything!

Super tasty! A little time consuming but not hard. Made a LOT of chicken, way more than 6 servings I’d say! I used one pound of drumsticks with two pounds of thighs.

Wonderful!!  I only used 2 chipotle peppers rather than the entire can, and it was perfect!  Even my picky 12 yr old loved it...after he added a ton of lettuce to cool it down.

This is super easy and super tasty! Love it! I make it every few weeks as it's even better when left for a day or two after cooking. 
One time I couldn't get thigh fillets (sold out) so substituted for breasts - worked really well though it took a lot longer to shred the chicken. Satisfied the fussy 'I only eat breast meat' people I know.

I made this recipe without any changes & it was fantastic.  I’ll definitely make it again & again.  It requires more steps/time than other Chicken Tinga recipes out there, but I believe the results are well with the steps.

This was a amazing I made it 3 times. At first my husband wasn’t going to eat it because he doesn’t like chipotles but now he always asks for it and takes the left overs to the station.  I like to do longer boiling / simmer times. I like the sauce thicker. It isn’t spicy it’s just so dang good.

Excellent dish, had plenty of sauce leftover so I froze it and a few weeks later just threw that and some frozen chicken thighs in the crockpot for the day and it was great again.

Doubling up the recipe, don't add the additional water. It will take forever to reduce the sauce consistency.

The brilliance of this recipe is that the Chicken flavor stands up to the adobo and chipotle.  I was frightened by the mount of chipotle and adobo sauce,  but I made everything  as written and it was perfect.   There is indeed a significant amount of heat,  but it's made bearable by the chicken fat.       I reduced the sauce as directed and had about twice as much sauce as needed.   I through some leftover porchetta in there and have more tacos for today!

Very spicy as made.  Which is fine by me - I loved it!   My family couldn’t eat it unfortunately.  Made it EXACTLY as written.

Yet another fantastic recipe from chef John. There are a lot of steps, but it's well worth it in the end. I used crushed tomatoes instead of peeled because that's what I had, and added a little under a tsp of baking soda in the end to counter a bit of a metallic taste from the tomatoes that come from cans they are in. Other than that, followed the recipe to a T. Thank you chef John!

Delicious.  Only changes were topping the dish with shredded Mexican cheese mix and skipped the cilantro.

Didn’t expect to like this since I didn’t appreciate the flavor while cooking. In the end the flavor was perfect for our taco Tuesday. I’d say I almost followed the recipe except I deseeded my chipotles, only had white onion on hand, doubled the oregano and I ended up adding some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I also cut time by using my instant pot, my chicken went in frozen for 20 mins. Every picky person (I usually make multiple meals) in my home complemented this.
We didn’t find this to be too spicy after removing the seeds. I have a 9yo and a FIL w/heartburn issues and I got no complaints. Although, we added sour cream, lettuce, cilantro, cheddar and Monterrey cheese to our tacos.  That may have reduced the heat.

I made this a few weeks ago and I'm getting ready to make it again this weekend. It was amazingly delicious. I first made the sauce in the blender with the entire can of chipotle peppers, but when I tasted it directly from the blender, I thought it was way too spicy. So I poured down half of it and added more tomatoes and it was still very spicy but more bearable. Even my son, who refuses to eat chicken (only eats beef, pork and seafood. I told him it was pork and confessed it was chicken after he ate it) loved it.  We made tacos. I will make this often!

This is soooooooo good! I kept putting off this recipe because I knew the kids wouldn’t eat it and I don’t have a lot of time to prep 2 meals. I’m so glad I finally took the plunge this week- it’s incredibly good! One of the best and most flavorful meals I’ve had in a long time and a big hit with others too. I made it exactly as instructed here by Chef John and also made his tortillas (as I regularly do) to go with it. YUM.

I made it just as chef John did and it was delicious. We ate it as street tacos the first night and in a quesadilla the next day. Both were perfect

No , the olive oil is a misprint. Watch the video; use 1-2tbsp to saute the onion for the sauce, or better yet, as Chef John says use the chicken fat skimmed off top of broth.
