This is wonderful with a couple of changes.  I used dijon plus a little yellow mustard. At the end of the cooking time before adding the cheese, I sprinkled a little cornstarch into the honey mustard sauce and stirred it up to thicken it a bit.  If you don't do this the sauce will be very thin.  Then top with the cheese and bacon bits instead of whole slices of bacon.  This lowers the fat while still adding the flavor.  Everyone LOVED it!

I made this tonight for dinner, and my husband rated it a 9. I used dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard. I actually blended this with the honey to my taste and spread it evenly over the chicken. At this point, I also sprinkled on the lemon pepper and added fresh chopped garlic to the baking dish. I also wrapped a whole piece of bacon around each breast. Then, I popped it into the oven at 375 as per instructions. After about half an hour, I kicked it up to broil to crisp the bacon. After I broiled the bacon for a little bit, I put on the cheese. Instead of using mozzarella, I used a shredded colby and monterey jack cheese blend. I broiled the cheese as well. The only thing that I think I would have done differently is flipped the chicken after a few minutes of broiling on one side so that I could get the bacon crisp on the other side too (since I had wrapped a whole piece around them) before adding the cheese. Overall, quite delectable.

My husband does not care for chicken breasts (too dry and tasteless, he says), but he admitted this was the best yet and that it definitely was a keeper.  I followed others' suggestions and wrapped each breast in two strips of bacon at the beginning, drizzled the honey-mustard sauce over bacon and breasts, baked 40 minutes, then sprinkled the mozzarella cheese just until melted.  It was absolutely the most delicious Honey-Mustard Chicken dish we have found and believe me, we have tried many!  Thanks, Sarahbea!

This has become one of my staple recipes, but I omit the bacon and cheese. It's fast, simple and so tasty. The chicken comes out moist and I like being able to adjust the honey and mustard ratio per my tastes. I tend to pair it with steamed broccoli and a baked sweet potato.

This has been my favorite recipe thus far from this website.  The only thing I did different was to wrap the breasts with about 2 strips of bacon.  I also prepared it early and let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours before baking.  It was delicious. It had great flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

HELPFUL TIPS WITH BACON AND FOR IT NOT TO TURN OUT BURNT LIKE I'VE BEEN SEEING IN PICS: First off, if you don't like bacon ...you don't need it.  Same goes with the lemon pepper.  This is a very forgiving recipe.  I prefer using dijon over regular mustard too.  With that said, I usually never have bacon handy, but then I started getting "real bacon bits" next to salad dressings. It's not the dried out kind, but as i said real bacon pieces in a package that are ready to use!  Plus this was the only way I could get my husband to eat the bacon!  Each time I do this, about 10-15 min before it's done, I pour 1.5-2T of cornstarch in a bowl (I use a measuring cup since it's smaller) then a little of the sauce I saved to dissolve it THEN pour over the sauce. Otherwise you will have a very thin sauce instead of creamy one. This is personal preference of course, but I like my sauces to stick a little bit.  Also since I cut each breast in half so it's thinner, I always bake my chicken at 350 for 25 COVERED .... add cornstarch ...add bacon/cheese ...then bake UNCOVERED for another 10-15 min (however long for the cheese to look deliciously melted).

Great recipe. Even the kids who were skeptical ate every bit. I sliced the chicken in half lengthwise to make thinner fillets. Then I rolled them and wrapped each one with bacon and secured with a toothpick. I seasoned with black pepper and after I mixed the honey and dijon mustard together I pour it over the chicken. Since I used thinner pieces of chicken I did not cook it as long. Turned out so yummy. Thanks!

This recipe was okay, but it took longer than ten minutes to get the bacon crispy, in fact I stuck it in the broiler because everything else for my dinner was ready.  Also, the cheese and bacon didn't adhere to the chicken at all, it came off when we tried to cut the chicken in one big hunk.  I would maybe suggest maybe putting some cheese and then bacon and then more cheese.  That might help it stick to the chicken!  As far as flavor, my family said it was okay, and I agree, maybe a more flavorful seasoning on the chicken, or maybe a more flavorful cheese rather than mozzarella?

Fantanstic taste and easy.  As suggested by another, subbed regular prepared mustard with Dijon mixed it with the honey.  Also followed TALQ's suggestions of wrapping the chicken with the bacon, cooking for 40 minutes, then sprinkling with mozzarella cheese. This will become a regular in our household. Very moist and delicious! Thanks

This was delicious-even my boyfriend thought so, and he is hard to please when it comes to food!  I wrapped the chicken with as much bacon as it took to cover the entire breast and cooked it with the chicken for the entire time.  Be sure to use bonless chicken breat halves to enjoy the flavor and don't forget the cheese. This recipe was very easy but looks like I slaved in the kitchen to make it. I'll be making this again, soon!

I love this recipe, it's easy, fast, and econimical. I use Dejon and honey lavishly, bake for 20 minutes. I pre-cook my bacon and discard the fat, and load on what ever cheese I happen to have on hand, usually cheddar and monterey. Bake for another 5-10 minutes.  
By pre-cooking the bacon not only am I eliminating unwanted fat I am not over cooking the chicken breasts, the most common cause of dry, tough white meat no matter what you put on it. 
This reminds me very much of "Alice Springs Chicken that used to be served at a popular Aussie restaurant.

I  have made this recipe twice now and love it!  I use prepared honey mustard and season the chicken with salt and pepper and leave out the lemon pepper. My chicken took longer than 25 mins.  More like 30-35 mins.  I also didnt add the cheese until the last 10 mins.  Sooo good:)

Because other reviewers indicated there was too much bacon grease in the sauce and the bacon did not crisp up well, I chopped the bacon and fried it partially to render off some of the fat before sprinkling it on top of the chicken.  Baked the chicken covered for the first 25 minutes and then uncovered once I added the bacon and cheese.  Timing was right on.  Used half dijon mustard and half yellow and made extra sauce but don't think I really needed it.   Very tasty and good presentation, too.

I have made this twice and made 2 very IMPORTANT revisions.

1. Mix the mustard and honey together.  I have seen pictures with just globs of each, this needs to be mixed for best flavor.

2. Place the bacon on top of the chicken from the beginning.  Once chicken is fully cooked place the chicken under the broiler and keep a VERY CLOSE eye on it.  This will help fully cook and crisp up the bacon.  Once bacon is done add the cheese and bake (NOT BROIL) the chicken until the cheese melts.

Some of the pictures posted online don't do this dish justice.  Next time I make this I will post a picture.  I receive rave reviews when I make it.

Delicious, quick and easy.  I live alone and found this one of those recipes that can be perfect just for one.  Although I followed the receipe I had no bacon or lemon salt (will try with both next time) however it was still delicious served with green beans, corn on the cob and hot chips.

Oh my god, that was delicious.  Only change was that I precooked the bacon 3 minutes in the microwave to cook them a little crisper.

Very good. Mixed the honey and the mustard and spread evenly over the chicken. Sprinkled with chopped, pre-cooked bacon and then covered with cheese.

This was really good! VERY simple to make. I do suggest lining your pan with foil, as the honey mustard dripped off the chicken  and burned on the bottom of the pan. I might use Dijon mustard next time, just for a little more flavor.

Let me first say this is one of the juciest and most tender baked chicken recipes I have ever made.  I just think it needs a little alteration to make it what I'm looking for. I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper, then wrapped in one bacon slice each.  Place ends down in a foil lined pan.  I cooked for 30 min on 375, then broiled it for about 10 min to crisp the bacon.  The cheese only needed a few minutes to melt.  Next time, I am going to use brown sugar instead of honey to make a thicker sauce.  The presentation was pretty ugly, and i think the cheese isn't totally necessary if you don't have it, but it tastes wonderful!  I think this will be just what I'm looking for in a bacon wrapped chicken.

It was great! I used fresh lemon juice and pepper instead of lemon pepper, because I didn't have any. Extra points for easiness!

I loved these!  My husband and three year old also loved these.   However, I did change a couple of things.  First, I mixed the honey mustard and marinated my chicken in it for a couple of hours (saving some honey mustard to glaze with later).  I then added spices (not lemon pepper, I'm not a fan) and placed them in a hot skillet with a little bit of Olive Oil so they would caramelize on the outside, flipping them once, then I glazed them and placed the skillet into the oven to finish cooking for about 15 minutes.  Last five minutes I added the bacon and cheese.  The chicken was very juicy and delicious.  Thanks a bunch for this recipe!

Great recipe!  The only things I did differently is that I used honey mustard and bacon pieces instead of bacon strips.  It tasted and looked delicious.

Fantastic! I made exactly as written and my husband and I both loved it. There was quite a bit of sauce leftover in the baking pan, so I spooned it over some rice. Yummy! I will make this again and again.

This was terrible.  It wasn't sweet enough because all you could taste was the mustard.  The bacon did not become crispy before the cheese burned.  It was also very flat (except for all the mustard).  I will never make this again.

I had all the ingredients in the house so I figured why don't I try out something new for dinner. I used a little dijon in my honey-mustard mixture and topped my chicken with A LOT of bacon because that's what my family likes. I also added a little three-cheese on top of the mozzarella right before I pulled the dish out of the oven which was very yummy. I was very pleased with the outcome of this and will definitely make it again.

Definitely something I'll make again sometime... I used dijon mustard instead, and left out the lemon pepper... I found the sauce a little bit runny, it all went to the bottom of the dish... but besides that it was perfect :)

This was amazingly good. Seriously, this will be made A LOT in our household. I did cook the bacon some first though, I didint want to risk it being undercooked. Tons of flavor and so easy. Yum.

Good recipe. I felt there was too much sauce so the cheese that was on the side of the chicken ended up soggy instead of bubbly.  I would also precook the bacon a little as the bacon was WAY to raw by the time the chicken was done.  Again it was a good recipe, but with a few tweaks it could be a great recipe.

Delicious!  I used Chicken Tenderloins and covered them with honey mustard.  I put strips of Bacon on top and cooked for 35 mins.  I then added Mozzarella cheese and boiled the dish for only a few minutes.  I was great!

I had a package of chicken breasts thawed out to cook for dinner and found this recipe.  You saved my life! Didn't do the bacon. It just doesn't get any better or easier than this recipe. I'd like to try it with chicken tenders and reduce the bake time.  This is a keeper.  Many thanks!

Easy, delicious and versatile.  I love this recipe, no matter what mustard you choose, this is a winner.  I did lower the oven temp to 350 to keep chicken from drying out.  DELICIOUS! I served with Spaghetti (I used Fetuccini) Broccoli and Mushrooms recipe from "DENISE" at a dinner party for four.  PERFECT.  Everyone asks for the recipe or asks me to make it again.  Being so easy to make, it's so easy to oblige.  This has become one of my favorite chicken recipes!

Very simple variation on basic baked chicken.  We loved it.  I used spicy brown mustard and regular Mrs. Dash vs. lemon pepper seasoning for a more simple flavor.  I also traded tomato slices for the bacon slices for a lighter meal.  Paired it with brown rice with peas.  Delicious, savory, and tender, this chicken recipe will be a staple in my meal-planning.

We really liked this recipe. I did like some others and wrapped the bacon around each chicken piece first, then drizzled mustard and honey over each. I actually forgot the lemon pepper. Baked at 375 for about half hour and then added the mozzarella for a few more minutes. Really good!

Very good, even w/o bacon. I would suggest using thin breasts or cutting thick 1's in half width wise to have more tender chicken and faster cooking time.

Superb!  I just went to buy more honey so I can make this again!  This time, I bought 8 pounds!  (lots of chicken breasts in the freezer; got a great buy) Even the kids love that honey-mustard flavor.  I used  a type of Japanese sticky rice, with the sauce over it, and it was perfect.  My only change was that I used homemade bacon bits instead of the raw bacon on top. I keep those on hand regularly, and this was a perfect recipe to use them.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I used Dijon mustard.  I cut the chicken up into smaller pieces for ease in serving it.  I also cut up the bacon and fried it prior to topping the cooked chicken with it.  I pre-cooked some mushrooms with a little garlic and topped the chicken with that, then the bacon and then the cheese.  Everyone liked it!  Served it with rice and a salad - quick, easy and yummy!

Too much sauce but next time I will just cut down on the honey and mustard. I fixed the bacon beforehand and topped it already crisp. Very good - will make again.

Delicious! For the sauce I used slightly more honey, slightly less mustard (dijon, rather than plain yellow), and mixed in about a tsp. each of garlic powder and lemon pepper. Prepared as directed, except for leaving off the bacon slices, BUT I topped with bacon bits after I melted on the cheese. Turned out moist, with a great flavor! Will use this recipe again!

Easy enough, but didn't really taste the bacon. I'll use a lot less honey & mustard. We did use dijon & it wasn't as strong which we prefer. My hubby said to use more bacon, but there wouldn't be any room on top of the chicken so I'm not sure what I'll do next time for more bacon flavor other than a different type of bacon.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe!  I followed it almost exactly as written.  The only changes I made were to fry the bacon before putting it on the chicken and I added some corn starch to the honey mustard sauce before spooning it over the chicken so that it would thicken.  I mixed the honey, mustard and cornstarch together before spooning it over the chicken.  I also ran out of honey so I used 1/2 a cup of honey instead of the 3/4 cup that the recipe called for and I thought the sauce was perfect.  I used 4 pretty good sized boneless, skinless chicken breasts, put them in a 9 X 13 pyrex dish, spooned the sauce over the chicken, sprinkled with the lemon pepper and cooked in the oven for 25 minutes.  After 25 minutes I took the chicken out and topped it with the shredded mozzarella cheese and then topped with the crumbled bacon and put back in the oven for another 10 minutes.  I made this recipe earlier in the day so by the time we had dinner that night, to reheat the chicken, I just popped the whole dish back in the oven for about 10 minutes while I cooked my sides.  We had rice and carrots with it and it made for a delicious meal. Adding the cornstarch really helped to thicken the sauce and make it extra yummy.

These turned out pretty good. My husband cannot stand when bacon is in recipes yet doesn't get crisp so I skipped the bacon. Right before I added the cheese, I sprinkled some bacon bits on to give it that extra flavor. I turned it under the broiler the last 5 minutes to get is good and bubbly. Kids ate ALL of theirs and the hubby got seconds!! =)

Nice go-to recipe....for crispy bacon, cook bacon on skillet until it is just about done while chicken is cooking in oven. Place mozzarella cheese under and over the bacon and don't leave the chicken in longer than 30 minutes! I usually make a similar recipe to this, and intend to make this one again as well. Good dish - loved by all:)

This was very good and very easy.  Next time I will put the bacon on a bit sooner so it will crisp up more.  10 minutes was not enough time to accomplish that, then add the cheese after it has become crisp.  Will use this recipe often.  Thanks for sharing.

After reading a lot of the reviews, it made me a little nervous about the bacon grease, so I cooked the bacon about half way through before putting it on the chicken and I put it on at the beginning.  Glad I did because it was cooked perfectly.  Added the cheese the last ten minutes.  I did not get thick chicken breasts, so I think I should have cooked it for a total of 25 minutes instead of 35.  But it was still fantastic and we loved the flavor!! A great recipe - you will really like this one!!  I used dijon mustard and the honey mustard sauce is awesome - awesome- awesome!!

Excellent - I did reduce the honey to equal the mustard, as I felt it would be too sweet.  I forgot the cheese, but served the sauce it made over spaghetti and it was delicious!  Did put a little parm on the pasta.  It's a keeper.

Yum!  This was so easy, and using pantry ingredients it was very economical.  I didn't think the ingredient list sounded very appetizing, but it turned out delish!  I used Purdue thin sliced chx breasts, layered them slightly on top of eachother, brushed them with honey mustard, sprinkled with lemon pepper, then sprinkled jarred bacon bits.  Baked in a 350 oven for 20 minutes, then topped with a shredded mixture of cheeses and turned the oven up to 425.  Baked until the top was browned and bubbly.  Definitely a keeper in our house!  Thank you for the recipe!

Wow was this good!  Definitely a keeper. I used Dijon mustard. Put the bacon in the microwave to cook it a little bit so I could drain some of the grease off and then put it on the chicken for the whole cooking time, and it turned out crispy.   think next time I will try Cheddar or Colby for a different flavor. Update: I didn't have enough chicken to make this, but I had left over ham. I cubed the ham and the 2 chicken breasts I had, put them in the oven wih the sauce for 25 min. I cooked and crumbled the bacon (don't over cook), and used a shredded cheese mix of Colby, Jack, and Cheddar and put the dish back in the oven for 10 min. It was fantastic served over rice!

The flavor is not bad but the sauce is runny and there's too much of it.  Maybe twice as much as it needs.  It just didn't look very appetizing. I put the bacon on in the beginning because of previous comments, and I also used mostly dijon mustard.

I made this recipe exactly as written and found the same issues as other reviewers -- the honey/mustard mix was way too overpowering for the chicken *and* the bacon. In addition, the cheese tended to just slide off the chicken breasts when serving them.

This dish has great potential and I plan on making it again; however, I plan on the following changes: 1) reduce the amount of sauce while also using dijon vs. prepared mustard and changing the ratio to reduce the honey "sweet" factor and 2) wrapping the bacon all the way around the chicken to try to avoid it and the cheese slipping off. I'll update my review after trying it with my changes and let everyone know how it turns out.

Easy and tasty.  I'm on the Atkins diet, so I used a little splenda in place of honey and I went light on the cheese.  Even with the changes it came out delicious!  Took advice of other reviewers and broiled bacon before adding cheese.

Very good and juicy. Everyone love it. I did cook the bacon first as others suggested. Actually, I used a cast iron skillet to fry the bacon, then baked the chicken breasts in the cast iron skillet in the oven. The bacon flavor was really good. I did use the lemon pepper and it was really good.

I tried this recipe today and i wasnt sure at first since im fairly new at cooking but im glad to say that it turned out delicious i did add a few ingredients though, i added some onions, a bit of chopped garlic and cilantro...I added the cilantro because my boyfriend insisted but i dont suggest it because its flavor is too strong. If you do want to add cilantro to this recipe i suggest adding it at the end.

This was not only simple but absolutely delicious.  Pretty much made as is, only exception wrapped each chicken breast in two strips of bacon and baked at 375 for 35 minutes, turn chicken, baked another 10 minutes and then topped with the shredded mozzarella cheese and baked a little more.  My daughter said it was AWESOME!

This was great! I did take others suggestion and used prepared honey mustard instead of making my own. The bacon didn't crisp because it was under the cheese. However this got great reviews from my kids and husband.

I liked everything about it, even re-heated, except the lemon pepper. I would not recommend pairing honey mustard and lemon pepper ever. It was a weird tangy taste which is not meant for chicken.

Few modifications -- no bacon, used 2 boneless, skinless breasts, some leftover chicken from the previous night, and two veggie burgers!  It still came out great.  One person does not prefer chicken, but he said that this recipe was the best way that chicken could be prepared (that's a compliment).

Really good...but greasy. Next time I will cook the bacon first because it just leaked grease into the rest of the yummy honey mustard sauce. I mixed the honey and mustard in a bowl, then dredged the chicken in it. I also poured the rest of the sauce in the baking dish and kinda basted the chicken every 15 minutes or so. The remaining sauce was great for dipping the chicken in, with the exception of it being full of bacon grease!! Will make again with a few small changes.

Awesome!  A couple of revisions...I used dijon mustard and thoroughly mixed the mustard and honey before topping the chicken.  Used the ready cooked bacon and microwaved the bacon for 20 seconds and added the bacon and cheese at the halfway cooking point.  Was absolutely delicious.

My husband, my brother and I loved it but I did make changes to it. After reading some other reviews I sprinkled lemon pepper on it first then I put the honey mustard on top of that, for the honey mustard I added the mustard to the honey little by little and tasted it till I liked the flavor, I also added some cornstartch in it so that it thickened up. Then after I drizzled the honey mustard on the chicken I put a little chedder cheese on it instead of mozzarella, chedder has a bolder taste, it was good. Then I put the bacon on before I put it in the oven(instead of waiting till the end of the baking time to put the bacon on) so that it got a little crispy. Then of course I did add more chedder cheese at the end of baking so that it would melt. To top off the chicken I chopped up onions and pickles and garnished the chicken with it, my husband really liked it. Next time I will try bacon bits so that it is lighter in calories and fat. But it was very Yummy!!!!

We thought this was pretty good. The chicken was tender and juicy, and quite flavorful. I did agree with the other lady that the bacon did not get crisp. Next time I may put the bacon on right at the start, or try precooked bacon.

Given that my other half thinks chicken is boring, I was glad to see this recipe.  I didnt use nearly as much honey OR mustard, and the bacon didnt get 'crispy' but overall we liked it enough to make it again.  Also, I had to substitute provolone since that's what I had.  Next time I might use the prepared honey-mustard you can buy now because the mustard did overpower a bit.

Absolutely the best chicken ever.  Seemed like a strange combo to me at first but I'm SO glad we tried this.  I use the "real" bacon bits in a jar and mix honey with honey dijon mustard and it tastes delicious!

Wow. This was some of the most delicious and moist chicken I've ever made. As with every recipe I find here, I tweaked it to make it a little healthier. I only used 1/2 cup prepared yellow mustard and 1/3 cup of honey, which was more than enough. I also took others' suggestions and mixed them together. After seasoning the chicken with salt and pepper (I skipped the lemon pepper because it seemed like a weird combo to me), then poured the sauce over it. I also skipped the bacon to save calories and fat, but might try it with turkey bacon next time since that's all we eat in my house. After the chicken baked for about 35 minutes, I added the cheese, baked for another 7, then broiled for 3 more. I served it over rice with the extra sauce spooned on top, and it was amazing! What a simple and yummy recipe.

Very easy and delicious too! I added the bacon about halfway through the cooking time and the cheese the last ten minutes. Simple enough for a weeknight with little prep needed. Thanks for the great recipe.

I love honey mustard, and anything with bacon on it is good, so I knew this was going to be a hit with me. I was worried, however, about my picky husband, and my toddler who won't eat food that is touching other food. But my kid devoured this! And my husband, who's usual response to something new is "eh, it's alright", said, "Hey, this is pretty good!"
I did make some changes. I used cheddar instead of mozzarella for one. I also crumbled the bacon, but I won't do that next time cause my husband said, "You know what would be better? If you laid the bacon in a strip on top instead of in crumbles." Well, there you go! 
I also, cut the honey/mustard down significantly. I used - per breast - 1/4 tablespoon honey and 1 teaspoon mustard, and it was MORE than enough. I also used only about 2 tablespoons of cheese per breast, and that was also way more than enough. I also halved the breasts lengthwise to make thinner fillets, because all that yummy stuff on top makes this plenty filling. I also sprinkled a little parsley on top to make it look spiffy! ;-) This is going into the dinner rotation, and I'm planning on playing around with different cheeses. Mozzarella would be good, I just like cheddar a lot!

Really good but be sure to conform the cooking time to the size of the breasts or you may get dry ones.

Everyone LOVED this recipe! There was none left, and my crew doesn't even like boneless chicken breast that much. Has a great flavor! I used garlic powder instead of lemon pepper, dijon mustard instead of yellow, and put the bacon on and broiled for it to get crispy. I added the cheese last to let it melt. Will definitely make again!

This was a HUGE hit!  We did as suggested and wrapped a piece of bacon around each slice and turned often to make sure bacon was crisp.  Leftovers were just as delicious.  Thanks for sharing :)

This was very good for a quick weeknight meal.  Kids really liked it and it did not require a lot of attention.  Only did one thing different, bacon did not look like it was crisping well, so I turned the broiler for a few minutes, then, after bacon looked crisp, I added the cheese and let it melt.  Delish!

Taste was okay.  I guess, for the flavor, I would not go with the extra steps and calories of adding the bacon and mozzarella.  Sometimes, I think people go overboard on adding cheese for the simple sake of "jazzing something up."  I will not make this again.

I used creamed honey so sauce was thick. Wrapped w/ 2 bacon, 40 min @ 375. Flip chicken, baste w/ sauce, top w/ cheese (generously), broil 10 min.  BF said this is "my" best recipe yet! Next time i will mix only enough honey and mustard for what I have. Recipe makes a LOT of sauce.

I was in a hurry and had to make one change--Hormel real bacon bits from a jar instead of the whole pieces of raw bacon--just under one jar for 4 large breasts.  Made it for company and everyone LOVED it.  Very moist chicken and great blend of flavors.  Thanks for a keeper!

Great recipe that you can really play around with, or make as directed.  Instead of putting the sliced bacon on the chicken prior to the cheese, I pre-cooked the bacon and crumbled it up because my family prefers that "crunch" of the bacon.  The chicken turned out moist and delicious!  Nice recipe!

Suggestions: Serve with noodles on a bed of fresh baby spinach (gently sautee or simply fresh as you like)on top and then layer with the chicken. For a "full meal deal" heat a can (we like Hunt's) of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano and serve on top of the noodles before topping with the chicken. Add capers to the mozerella topping for the finishing touch in the last minutes of baking the chicken. Definitely use Dijon mustard. Regular "hot dog" mustard just doesn't carry the quality of flavor that Dijon does. Add hot crusty farmer's bread and a crock of real butter (forget margarine which is one molecule away from Tupperware - I'm serious ) and you've got a dish to die for. Make that a dish to LIVE for.

One of our new favorite dishes. Chicken isn't my favorite thing to cook, though, so this made it simple, easy and delicious. I used dijon mustard and real bacon bits, and it was an amazing combination with the honey and cheese. Will make this over and over again. Thanks!

I loved this recipe. I took this one and another one and put them together. I poked holes in the uncooked chicken with a fork and soaked with worcestshire sauce an dlet soak for an hour. Then I baked the chicken at 350 for 30 min. I cooked bacon Once chicken was done, I topped each chicken breast with two slices of bacon topped with cheese then honey mustard salad dressing. I put it back in the oven for 15 min. It was so tender juicy and delicious.

This is my favorite chicken recipe so far from allrecipes.com.  I sliced each chicken breast in half, poured the honey-mustard mixture over it, and then placed one to two slices of bacon on top of each chicken piece.  When the chicken was done, I put it under the broiler to crisp up the bacon.  In my rush to get the meal on the table, I forgot to add the cheese!  It didn't need it.  I served the dish with rice and salad.  Next time I make it, I will use the cheese, but will sprinkle it over the rice and warm it enough to melt the cheese.

I mixed creole mustard with the honey, spread it on both sides and added a diced clove of garlic.  I also used shredded pepper jack cheese, which gave it a sweet & spicy taste.  Simple, tasty & quick recipe!

This was really good.  I didn't measure the honey or the mustard.  I just added to taste.  I always cut my chicken breast in half long horizontally so that it is more tender (my phobia).  Thanx for this recipe!

My brother scarfed this down, but I just wasn't a big fan. I made it exactly as written except I used a mixture of regular yellow mustard and spicy brown mustard. The bacon didn't crisp up and I just felt like something was off. If I try it again, I'll cook my bacon beforehand, as others have suggested....or I'll leave the bacon off all together.

Absolutely scrumptious and moist.  I cut the breasts in half (they were huge), coated the chicken with mustard/honey mixture, put the bacon on top and then cooked it for 25 minutes.  Then I topped each breast with a slice of mozz and baked 10 more minutes to bubble the cheese.  Yum!

Great recipe!  My girls (ages 3 and 5) ate it up too.  I did substitute turkey bacon since my hubby is watching his calories and didn't use the lemon pepper becuase I didn't have any.  VERY quick and easy dinner with things that are almost always on hand.  Thanks!

Use 3TB honey and 2TB mustard.    Wrap each chicken breast in a piece of bacon.  Rub the honey/mustard on.  Cook 400 for 25-30 minutes, then turn on broiler.  Cook for a couple minutes each side to crisp bacon, sprikles mozza and broil another couple minutes.   Cooked with lots of sauce, I took the kids' out at broiling time, and that worked too.

This chicken was SO good and SO easy. A HUGE hit! My boyfriend even mentioned how good it was one more time before he fell asleep. Following other suggestions I made a few changes. I mixed Dijon mustard, a little yellow mustard, the honey, a little garlic, and a little cornstarch to make more of a 'sauce' and spooned that over the chicken. I added some lemon pepper and then put one slice of bacon cut in half on the chicken right away because another reviewer had said the bacon didn't cook in only 10 minutes, and I prefer my bacon crispy. I followed the baking instructions - open the oven a few times to spoon sauce from the dish over the chicken, and added some Monterey Jack cheese toward the end. Perfect, easy, juicy, and delicious!

This made a great chicken sandwich. I cooked the chicken with the honey-mustard mixture, little fresh ground, garlic powder, onion powder and the lemon pepper. I served the chicken breast on rolls with the crisp bacon and mozzerella cheese. Everyone really liked it. Served with a fresh green and fruit salad, this was a great prelude to summer dinner. Thank you for sharing. NOTE: Once I can get my husband to fire up the grill, I can't wait to grill the chicken and then make a sandwich out of it.

This was pretty good.  I mixed the mustard and honey together before drizziling on the chicken. Then I cut up the bacon and sauteed it in a pan before topping it on the chicken.  I also had some roma tomatoes that i need to use so I cut them up and seeded them and topped the bacon with them then topped with cheese...my husband and i both agreed that this would be excellent sandwiched between two slices of bread and a piece of lettuce....thanks for the great recipe

We LOVED this! Since I cook for two, I made the honey mustard and used half for this meal and refrigerated the rest for a meal the following week. It was just as good the second time! This is now one of our favorites!

This may be a good recipe BUT... the bacon DOES NOT crisp in an oven for 10 minutes.... that's the only thing I didn't like about this recipe... nothing worse than limp cooked bacon.  UGH

For those of you that know the show, this reminded me of Everybody Loves Raymond and how Debra's go-to lemon pepper chicken probably tasted.  Long stroy short - I think this is a great recipe for somebody that doesn't normally cook (there are plenty of ways to keep chicken moist..) or perhaps it's different taste preferences.  All in all, I will never make this again or even variations of it.

I made this for my boyfriend and our 2 guy roomates and they all loved it! I did tweak it a bit...I put the bacon on the stove and heated it till just about done then split the breasts and stuffed it with the mozzarella cheese and half cooked bacon then baked it for the 25 min then added more cheese and bacon on top then cooked it for 15 min more...it came out great!!! just fantastic! No left overs and definitely a keeper...I love honey mustard and this dish was perfect! Even for people who are not a fan of honey mustard.  My boyfriend hates honey mustard...but LOVED this recipe!

Instead of seasoning with lemon pepper, I added a squirt of lemon juice and some cracked pepper. Let marinate for about 30 minutes. My boyfriend and I really liked it!! Thanks!!

I rubbed the breast with seasoning salt and pepper before cooking.  I also wrapped it with two strips of turkey bacon.  The breast was very moist.  I think a cheese with more flavor would have been better.

I absolutely love this recipe, my boyfriend asks me to make it all the time..  One change I made was that I use fresh mozzarella rather than shredded, and I slice it up and put it under the bacon.  We don't wait for the bacon to crisp either. All around an excellent recipe though.

Great inspiration!! I made a few changes. I used french's mustard with honey, regular honey. I also chopped up the bacon and cooked with lemon pepper and fresh garlic. Once the bacon cooled I added it to the chicken mixture and marinated for a few hours. I then baked at 375 for about 25 mins. I then topped with the shredded mozza and broiled until done. So tasty and my husband raved!!! Thanks!

Fantastic!!  The chicken was very moist and had a great flavor.  I did make a few changes to make it healthier but it was still very delicious. I used turkey bacon and reduced fat mozzarella cheese.  I also used Jalapeño mustard instead of yellow which gave it a nice bite without being too spicy.  I omitted the lemon pepper and instead rolled the chicken breasts on a shallow plate of seasoned breadcrumbs before placing them in the pan and topping with honey and mustard.

I liked the way the different ingredients combined to create a completely new flavor. I did use dijon mustard as opposed to the mustard called for in the recipe. I cooked the entire recipe at 350, and for a longer period of time. The bacon stayed on longer, and the sauce thickened because of the longer, lower temperature.
When making again, I would pound the chicken breasts to make them thinner. 

This was a hit! Thanks!

I read a lot of the reviews before making this dish and I think it really helped. I wanted to make a smaller portion of chicken without lots of extra sauce so I just made enough honey mustard to cover each side of the breasts of chicken. I covered each chicken breast with the sauce then wrapped it with bacon before baking. the result was moist chicken and crispy bacon. I would definatley make this again however I would add less honey and I would use mozzerella cheese as in the recipe as I tried it with tasty and it was a bit too rich!

I had high hopes for this one but it seemed just so-so.  I think I would like this better if I blended the honey and mustard together before drizzling so the tastes would be more balanced.  I used a 3 oz. jar of real bacon bits and added 8 oz. frozen chopped broccoli to the pan (had to bake for an additional 15 minutes).  Served this over brown rice.  Maybe we'll try again with a few changes.  It was definitely very easy, though!

We loved this recipe but I did alter it slightly. I used half Dijon mustard and half regular mustard mixed together. I also fried my bacon, 8 pieces, drained and diced it up so it was easier to eat. Other then that I followed the recipe and we were delighted with the flavor of this dish. I will be adding it to my favorite recipes list and can hardly wait to have company over so I can Wow them too! Thanks SarahBea for sharing this wonderful recipe with the rest of us.

The sauce tasted good, but the chicken was too dry for my liking.  I did cook the bacon a little before putting it on the chicken.  I am very nervous about eating under-cooked meat.  So it is possible that the chicken was dry simply because I cooked it longer than what was stated on the recipe.

Made this recipe for the first time tonight and I thought it was very good, the chicken was moist and had a very nice flavor, I will make it again but next time I would add additional lemon pepper.

This was excellent.  I lined the raw bacon over the chicken before it went in the oven to cook.  After, I pulled it out of the oven, added cornstarch to the sauce and set oven to broil to crisp the bacon.  Then I added the cheese and broiled it again til the cheese was bubbly and browned. For seasoning, I used celery salt, garlic salt, and lemon pepper.

This was good easy and I followed the directions pretty closely. The changes I made were to cook the bacon in the microwave first and to add a sprinkle of cornstarch to the honey mustard to thicken it.

My entire family loves this recipe (and I have one very picky eater).  I always have dried mustard seasoning on hand in case I'm out of honey mustard or Dijon mustard.

Pretty tasty...I would crisp bacon a bit in microwave or something before baking.  It just doesn't get done all the way when wrapped around chicken.

My husband says 3.5 stars. It was good but not exceptional. To me it was pretty good, and I will probably make it again. I used Amora brand mustard (kind of like dijon). Next time I will try with American yellow mustard.

I made this the other night for my two kids and boyfriend.  It turned out great.  My son at first looks at it and says there is mustard in this, isn't there?  I laughed because neither of my kids like mustard.  I told them to try it and if they didn't like it I would make something else.  Dinner was over in about 15 minutes.  The chicken was perfect with lots of flavor and so juicy.  I went and got chicken breasts that were cut into two slices because they are so thick.  I find I like them a lot better and so does my family.  During dinner, my boyfried said this is really good chicken three times.  That is a definite compliment coming from him.  Will be making this again soon.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

best to use pre-cooked bacon, so its crispy not rubbery, when the cheese melts.

This dish was DELICIOUS! There weren't any leftovers...I did make a few changes though, I added a 1/2 cup of chopped onions and 3/4 cup of honey bbq sauce and cut the lemon pepper.

I thought this might turn out sweet with the honey but it wasn't, it was very flavorful chicken and quite easy to throw together, I will definitely make this again. I didn't have mustard or lemon pepper so I skipped those and I marinated the chicken in homemade buttermilk and some italian seasoning for about 30 minutes before baking (over a bed of rice and veggies, with chicken stock) Very moist and it didn't need even need the mozzarella.

Very sweet.  Only 3 of the 5 of us liked it, but it did come out very moist.   Did not use the bacon, since I didn't have any, and that might have made the dish less sweet, with the saltiness from the bacon counteracting the honey. Would make again but cut down on the honey and definitely use bacon.

My partner loved this and I thought it was ok.  I followed recommendations and put in equal amounts of honey and mustard, added a healthy pinch of corn startch to the mixture and then coated the breasts.  Baked in a parchment lined pan (fantistic tip - thanks to who posted it!) and then topped with cheese about 5 minutes before pulling from the oven. Make sure to adjust cooking time based on the size of your chicken breasts.  I thought this was very sweet and needed more of a mustard taste.  The sauce was a nice consistence after baking for putting on the cut chicken.  My problem with this (outside of being too sweet) is that the flavor was entirely in the sauce.  This has already been requested again and next time I marinate the chicken for a minimum of 4 hrs before baking to see if that helps.  If you like a sweeter honey mustard sauce, this one is definitely for you.

I really liked this.  I used prepared honey mustard since it was in the fridge, spreading it evenly over the chicken, and I cooked my bacon in a skillet before topping the chicken (then I used the bacon fat to saute a side dish).  Hubby said it would have been better had the chicken been wrapped in bacon, but I think he just wanted more bacon!

This recipe was fantastic!  My husband must have told me 3 times during the meal that he loved this dish and directed me to keep it because he wanted it again.
Like other reviewers I used the dijon mustard. I mixed the honey and mustard together and poured over chicken. Other than that change I made as directed and it was perfect.  The cheese on top was browned perfectly and presented well. I would serve this to company.

My son has changed the name of this recipe to the Amazing Chicken . The only changes I made was I didn't use the lemon pepper just regular pepper and added some onions flakes . One hint I would give is if using low fat cheese watch it closely because it went rubbery  really quickly .

3 stars for being super moist and easy to make, but lost 2 stars because my husband didn't rave on and on about it like I hoped he would. I thought it was just okay too..not nearly as much flavor as I was looking for. I used spicy deli mustard because it was what I had on hand, but otherwise I followed the recipe as  stated. Probably will not make this one again.

I loved this recipe and so did my family. I used suggestions from others and mixed dijon mustard with yellow mustard to go in with the honey. I also used a little bit of corn starch to thicken the honey mustard glaze just a bit. I love lemon pepper seasoning so I went a little heavy on that, seasoning the chicken breasts before glazing. I topped it with a colby/monterey jack cheese blend I already had on hand and bacon bits on just a few pieces, (I don't like bacon). Made it with mashed sweet potatoes (baked not boiled) and steamed broccoli. Yumm, yumm, yummy! I will def be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

The chicken was yummy and the recipe very simple, but it was just nothing oh so good.
An for an every day recipe, I think it contains too much sugar - would not want my kid to have it. And for special occasions it`s not special enough.
For us it was one of these recipes where we thought "yeah, it`s good, well, or okay. Would we make it again? - No, probably not."

A very good week night dinner.  Only a few ingredients and leaves time to prepare other items while it bakes.  I did broil it with the bacon on top for a few minutes before adding the cheese and baking for the last 10 minutes, to ensure the bacon would have the crispy texture I prefer.  I could really taste the honey mustard flavor inside the chicken.  I prepared this with rice and salad, perfect.  Overall, very good and very easy!  Thanks for sharing!

Great taste, but the bacon needs to be added much sooner. I ended up having to broil it for a few minutes to get it crunchy. But this was absolutely delicious and very simple to make!

Excellent chicken dish.  I pre-fried the bacon before putting it on the chicken which helped it crisp perfect in the oven.

These were just OK to us, nothing to rave about. The flavor of the sauce did not carry over into the chicken. Maybe if I marinaded them for a few hours first? I cut the recipe in half since it's just the two of us. I forgot the lemon pepper but I know that was not a make or break ingredient. With so many recipes that we do like I doubt I will give this one a second chance.

I cut this recipe in half.  Used 1/2 cup dijan mustard and eyeballed the honey.  Baked chicken for 45 mins.  Topped with cheese and bacon then broiled a few minutes.  Great recipe and will make again.  Next time more bacon.  Used already cooked bacon.

This was pretty easy to make. I did stray a little on the preparation. I used the same ingredients but I cooked the bacon and sliced it. I pounded the breast, spread the sauce on the chicken, added the bacon and shredded cheese the rolled them. Place the seam side down and glazed the top with the remaining sauce then sprinkled the lemon pepper and added more cheese on top. Covered it with foil lightly and cooked for 30 mins. Took off the foil and baked it for another 8 mins. until the top was a little brown. Served it with noodles and alfredo sauce. Everyone liked it but I put too much bacon (used a whole package) but everyone said that you can't have too much bacon.

Excellent. Took the advice to use dijon mustard and mix with honey ahead of time.  Put 1/2 slice of thick cut bacon on top of each. Baked at 375 for 35 minutes and then about five in the broiler with mozzarella.  Really, really good.  Thank You for the recipe!

This was amazing!!  I didn't use regular mozzarella, but a 6-cheese Italian blend & a smoky dijon mustard.  Did cook the bacon 75% of the way done ahead of time.  AWESOME!  My husband loved it.  Will definitely do again. Thank you!

I made this last night and it was good, but not great.  I took the advice of the other reviews and wrapped the chicken in bacon.  I found the bacon overwhelmed the honey mustard flavor.  Next time, I would eliminate the bacon and reserve some of the honey mustard to serve with the chicken.

Very good recipe!! As per other suggestions, I wrapped the bacon around the chicken first...which held together nicely.
Also, I didn't have lemon pepper...but i did have lemon & herb seasoning, which worked very well.
Will definitely make again!

Just made this dish! It was AMAZING! Super mosit! I did not add the bacon however. (I don't eat pork or beef) And It was still delicious. I also used a regular lite honey mustard with a little dejon. I loved every bite! Thanks for the recipe that I will for sure be using a lot in the future! You could plate it with just about anything!

This is one of my fiancé's absolute favorite recipes that I make for dinner! He raves about it to other people and insists I bake the recipe for them! I find the recipe simple, easy and satisfying for a last-minute dinner.

Instead of making honey mustard as the recipe calls for, I use Beaver brand honey mustard as a base and add honey to taste! At the last 5 or 10 minutes, I kick up the oven to broil to make the bacon crisp. Yum!

Family enjoyed this chicken dish.  The only change I made, based on what I realized I didn't have while making this, was to use real bacon bits instead of the piece of bacon.  It worked out nicely because nearly every bite of chicken had bacon and cheese in it.

Before I made this dish, I made sure to read all the reviews about it. Instead of the regular mustard, we used Dijon mustard. We also used REAL bacon bits instead of bacon slices. It was so full of flavour and my boyfriend kept going up for more! In between bites, he said this one was a real keeper! Would be nice served with a more milder dish, such as herbed noodles. Awsome recipe, thank you!!!!

Too much honey and mustard... Turns out really runny. Also, the bacon didn't get crisp after 10 extra minutes, especially when you cover the bacon with cheese. I was really disappointed in this dish.

We made these the way that the recipe is stated. Then we chopped up the chicken and put that into flour tortillas and added a small amount of sweet baby rays BBQ sauce... These wraps were sensational!! The whole family loved them! :D  Will make again! Thanks for the recipe!

My entire family faved about this recipe, and I will definitely make it again.  I would never have thought to combine honey-mustard with lemon pepper, but it is very tasty!

The honey mustard gave the chicken an excellent flavor.  Definitely don't overcook the chicken or it will dry out.  I made mine exactly as recipe called for and my bacon ended up somewhat soggy.  If I were to do it again, I'd precook the bacon and then put it on the chicken and let it finish crisping up at the end of the baking time, then I'd add the cheese and melt it.  I used mozzarella slices and I liked that better than the shredded.

The whole family loved this yummy chicken!  I used Monterey Jack cheese and sprinkeled the chicken with garlic powder as well.  The bacon definitely needs some pre-cooking, otherwise great recipe!

I made this as directed, except I did mix the honey and mustard together and poured over the chicken.  While it was good, it was missing something.  I'd like to try this again with dijon mustard to see if that kicks this up a notch.  I'll also increase the lemon pepper next time.

Delicious!  I cooked the bacon before I put it on top of the chicken, used cheddar cheese (it's all I had), made the honey mustard with a sweet-hot mustard (left over from a Hickory Farms gift set), and chopped up 2 cloves of garlic before baking.  Just wonderful!  I wish I had left overs.

This turned out very nice. I turned my chicken breasts after 15 minutes and basted both sides generously with the combined honey & mustard. I also precooked the bacon slightly prior to adding to chicken. Since I only made 2 breasts, I held back some of the honey mustard mixture for dipping. My husband loved it!

Very good!!!  The only thing we would have liked is to somehow be able to keep the honey mustard sauce on it more, it kept running off but did leave some flavor still.  My picky husband really loved this as did all 3 of my kids!

My husband really went in a rant about this chicken. We loved it! I followed the recipe and only change I made is I combined the mustard and honey before I  poured over chicken. Also I used dijon mustard instead of plain for that extra zing! This is going in my recipe box to make over and over!

Mmmmmmmmm.  This is tasty!  I only had Monterey Jack cheese on hand, I used Dijon mustard with just a couple tablespoons of regular mustard, and I sprinkled the top with homemade bacon bits which I keep in the freezer.  I found that the sauce and cheese was plenty for 6 breasts.  The flavor is just superb, a great blend of sweet and tangy.  This one will definitely go on the list of "sure bets" for serving guests.

Pretty good...Only difference I made was cooking the bacon first as small pieces and then put on top of the cheese so it would stay crispy.

Very easy and customizable.  After the 25 minutes in the oven I put just the bacon on and the broiler on high for 8 minutes.  I added the cheese at this point and let  it stay in there for another 4 minutes.  Sweet, salty, crispy, gooey, and good stuff.  My picky 3 year old loved it!

Just made this for dinner tonight...everyone loved it!  I'm not a big fan of honey mustard, but I used 1/2 dijon, 1/2 yellow mustard mix & the lemon pepper definitely added that savory side that made it work for me.  I did cook and crumble the bacon onto each chicken piece at the 20 min. point and put little "mounds" of a mix of mozerella cheese and sharp cheddar.  MY husband even used the sauce over his brown rice. Quick, easy, & super good! Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

It was ok, easy to make but the sauce was very runny and very sweet.  Next time I won't use as much honey and maybe some spicy mustard.

I was a little worried that it may be greasy with the bacon but it wasn't. I took the advice of others and wrapped the chicken with 2 strips of bacon (my husband wants 3 next time) and broiled it at the end. I broiled the underside first and then flipped it and then added the cheese. Wonderful, thank you

Yummy and company worthy.  Used dijon mustard and about half of the honey/mustard sauce.  Sprinkled with garlic powder as well as the lemon pepper.  Wrapped the chicken in bacon and added the cheese before baking at 375 for 35-40 minutes. Husband raved about it.

After reading all the reviews I was excited about making this dish. I however will not be making it again. It looked so good when I came out of the oven but it was terribly sweet yet bland at the same time. I wouldn't recommend this dish to anyone.

This was delicious and easy! My husband, who is convinced he's going to grow feathers due to all the chicken I serve, loved it.  Did follow other reviewers and used Dijon mustard; keeping all other instructions the same.  A definite make again.

Really enjoyed this. I diced up half a Spanish onion and placed this over the chicken before putting the sauce down. A very tasty addition. Served the dish with rice and asparagus. Girlfriend loved it.

Meh, it was ok.  Used a dark mustard and for speed I cooked the bacon in a pan and then put it on for the last few minutes of cooking with the cheese and though everyone ate it (except my toddlers) I probably wouldn't make it again.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was soooo delicious!  My extremely picky 3 year old couldn't get enough of it! I didn't have lemon pepper, so I just used pepper and some lemon juice.  Also, I found that the bacon didn't crisp up, but it was still really good.

I thought this was fantastic. I omitted bacon because I don't like it, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe. I served it with the Black Bean Couscous Salad from this site. Definitely making this again - scrumptious.

I am not a chicken breast person, but this recipe makes boring chicken breast exciting. I used dijon mustard and fresh bacon. Bacon might need to a longer time since it didn't turn crispy after 10 minutes. And I regret that I did not put enough cheese. I served it with asparagus and rice pilaf. My hubby enjoyed it a lot. Will definitely use this recipe again.

At first, I was a little skeptical about the combination of ingredients (honey mustard with cheese & bacon?) but it was a hit with my hubby, teenager & mom-in-law!  This is my kind of recipe...just a handful of ingredients which are in my kitchen already!  The only changes I made was I used thighs (we're not "breast fans") which I microwaved till it was halfway cooked.  I placed the chicken in a pyrex dish, spooned some sauce, sprinkle the lemon pepper and baked for 15 minutes; turned the chicken over, spooned the rest of the sauce, sprinkle the lemon pepper, and baked for 10-15 minutes (or until chicken's done). I topped it off with the cheese and bacon bits, then baked for 5 minutes.  Quick.  Easy.  Yummy!

I made this tonight, and everyone loved it! However, I got all ready to make it, and couldn't find the honey! So I started concocting a sauce to put on the chicken and came up with: a teaspoon of splenda, 1/8c mustard, 1/8 cu sugar free maple syrup, 1/4 cu peanut butter, and a sqeeze of orange juice. I wrapped each peice of chicken in bacon (about 1 and 1/2 slices each) and then smeared the chicken in the sauce (which was very thick). Baked for 25 minutes, and then switched to broil for 5 minutes each side. We put mozz. on only half of the chicken as we didn't know if we would like it, and then broiled another 2 minutes. It was GREAT! Everyone ate it up. Even the little one, who hates mustard.. and a lot of things! I would reccommend the original recipe or the one we made!

So good!  Keeps the chicken moist and full of flavor.  I stuck with the same mustard/honey ratio and thought it was perfect.  I like recipes that are easy to do for just one serving and this was super easy.

I pounded the chicken breast to about 1/2 inch thick with a tenderizer.  I used cheddar/monteray jack blend cheese b/c I had that on hand.  I cooked in oven until juices ran clear.  This was devoured at dinner! I will put this into my regular rotation of dinners...

Very good and simple.  The only thing I'd do differently next time is to either add the bacon right at the start or pre-cook it separately.  I felt it was a bit too chewy (underdone?) even after 15 minutes more than the recipe called for.  Otherwise, will make this again.  Yummy!

This chicken is fantastic, my wife loved it. The only change I made was to use the bacon bits instead of slices.

Very good!  Followed another reviewers advice & cooked the bacon in pan first.  I then topped each breast with 2 pieces after cooking 30 minutes & sprinkled the cheese over.  YUM, this one's a keeper!  Will be making again for sure!

Absolutely delicious! I would have never thought to pair mozzerella cheese with this. The chicken was exceptionally moist and packed with flavor. I made sure to cook the bacon before I put it on the chicken as I like it extra well done and crispy. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe I will make time and again.

I made just a few changes.  I used cooked cubed chicken, added some already cooked rice and used honey mustard dressing instead of the separate honey and mustard. It cooked in a lot less time and made a great casserole with lots of flavor.  My picky kids love it!

My husband had the widest eyes with the first bite of this recipe and still claims that it ranks as one of his all time favorite meals. For my two-bits worth of changes, I wrapped each chicken breast in two slices of bacon. I prepared the sauce using the honey and regular mustard, but seasoned it with pepper, savoury, oregano, and onion flakes, rather than lemon pepper. Near the end of the baking, I took the chicken out of the oven, ladled the sauce over the chicken again, added the cheese, and returned it to the oven just long enough for the cheese to barely start toasting. The results were excellent. Thank you!

The flavors were great, but it was hard to cut since the cheese kept sliding around on the chicken. Next time, I will marinate the chicken in the honey mustard sauce and maybe pour it over the top of the cheese.

I pounded the chicken breasts so they all cooked evenly.  Shook lemon pepper directly on chicken (the first time I made this I put too little, the second time I put too much - however it was still good both ways.  Next time I'll have it down perfectly.  I used already prepared honey mustard, and put 2 pieces of bacon (Oscar Meyer center cut bacon) on each piece of chicken and baked for 30 minutes.  I put more shredded mozarella than receipe called for until melted (less than 5 minutes).  Delicious!  Thanks for the receipe.

Wow!  This is definitely a winner in my family! My husband usually grumbles when I make chicken but this time he just raved on and on about how much he loved it!  I used spicy brown mustard instead of regular for a bit of a kick and wrapped the bacon around the chicken prior to cooking. 40 minutes was perfect for the chicken and bacon. I wish I would have added corn starch as one reader had suggested as the sauce was a bit too runny for me. But it worked well to add the sauce to some rice as a side dish...yum! Thanks and we will be using this one again!

Made it exactly as recipe. Used Dijon mustard. Be liberal with lemon/pepper. Super dish. Next time I may try putting bacon on but holding the cheese until the end and just getting it bubbly and brown for the last couple of minutes. Bacon cooked but I like it a little crisper and it seemed the cheese held it back from crisping like I like it. Will definitely make it again. And it's even a great dinner on a work night - fast and easy!

Easy recipe. Great tasting. I mixed the honey and Dijon ("sauce") together, slowly poured over the chicken. Covered whole breast with bacon and then poured remainder of the sauce over the bacon.  Didn't have lemon pepper, but this didn't really affect the taste for me. I used aged cheddar and baked remainder of time - bacon was crispy (could've been the sauce over the bacon). Definitely will be using this one again - yummy.

Absolutely excellent. I'd give it 6 stars. Done exactly as recipe except I put the bacon on at beginning of cook time because it was very thick bacon.

I thought this was very good! I will make it again.  I used real bacon bits to save time. (Plus I wanted to make sure the bacon got crispy, as this was a complaint in other reviews.)  Next time I will add even more bacon bits because the bacon flavor is the perfect addition to the recipe.  I did halve the sauce originally, and then when I took the dish out to add the cheese and bacon, I dumped most of the extra sauce out b/c I did not want the chicken swimming in it.  Definitely don't use the full amount of sauce-- it will go to waste!  Overall, great mix of flavors and very easy!

Pretty good.  I thought it was going to be too mustardy, but it ended up fine IMHO, though there was too much sauce.  I was fairly generous with the lemon pepper.  I couldn't even taste the bacon so it was a waste of fat, but had I read the reviews first I would've cooked it ahead of time -- maybe then I could taste it.  I agree with the reviewer who said the topping just slides off when you try to cut into it -- I think putting some cheese on first would work well.  Despite what sounds like some complaints/problems, I did like it fairly well and would make again.

This was an easy and very tasty dish. The chicken turned out moist and the sauce was delicious, though a little thin. The flavor intensified with the leftovers.

I love this recipe. It's easy to make and delicious.  Good weeknight dinner (or any night). I cook the bacon first and then pour the grease over the chicken breasts after I dip them in the honey mustard.  Then I pour the rest of the honey mustard over the chicken. I leave out the lemon salt. This is one of my husband's favorite dinners.

Made this tonight and it was yummy ! Took some tips from other reviews and used 1/2 Dijon 1/2 yellow mustard. And added some cornstarch, to thicken the sauce before adding the bacon and cheese. Even my picky teen ate it. And he only likes tacos and Doritos. Lol.

This turned out great!  I substituted shredded colby jack instead of mozzarella and it gave it a little more of a kick - all mouths in the household approved.  :)

I made this recipe for my parents on Valentine's Day, and EVERYONE LOVED IT!!!!!!! I followed it to a T! The only thing is it takes awhile to cook and I wrapped the bacon around the chicken then cooked them together.

Excellent recipe.  I made it with a couple changes and my family loved it.  I did combine yellow mustard with horseradish mustard and a small amount of Dijon.  I also used bacon bits, as a previous reviewer mentioned and it was excellent.  Quick, easy and a hit with my family.

We love this recipe!  I made a couple quick changes... First I use Honey Mustard (French's), pepper and garlic salt and then I use microwave bacon.  The microwave bacon is already pre-cooked so it crisps nicely in the allotted time. Thanks for a great recipe.

This chicken was juicy with great flavor. The only complaint was that I would've liked my bacon slightly more done. I did put it in the broiler for the last 5 minutes only, I didn't want to risk overcooking the chicken by adding cook time. I'm one to eat my bacon on the not so crispy side so it didn't bother me much. My husband likes crispy bacon, but he just simply took it off. He still really liked the chicken.

Easy is right! This was quick and delicious. I used the left overs to make a chicken sandwich melt the next day. Just sliced it, added some avocado and 2 slices of bread, grilled it up for a few minutes and it was amazing!

this was delicious, i agree that the bacon didn't turn out crispy after ten minutes but i went ahead and ate it anyways, it was so tasty and sweet and my kids liked it, so five stars. Also, i didn't have lemon pepper so i used a mixture of black pepper and Mrs. Dash fiesta lime seasoning instead, and it worked great as a replacement!

The honey mustard sauce with lemon pepper is delicious. I omitted the bacon, and forgot about the cheese altogether, and this was fantastic! I unintentionally did exactly what another reviewer did, served with steamed broccoli and a baked potato. The meal hit all the important notes, the meat (I used chicken thighs) was sweet and tangy while still juicy and moist (baked it at 400deg for 22 minutes), the broccoli had a light sprinkling of salt, and the baked potato was a mellow starch that tied it all together. Yum!

Mmmmmm...this one is a keeper! My family loved it. I suggest crisping up the bacon in a skillet first and then putting on top of chicken with cheese and bake until cheese is melted. Great without bacon as well.

Easy to make, and my husband liked his a lot.  I on the other hand didn't care for it.   I did use Dijon mustard like others suggested.  It is a great weeknight dinner, as it doesn't take much to make.  I may try it 1 more time, maybe use less of the sauce on my piece of chicken.

Omitted bacon.  Substituted Dijon for the yellow mustard.  Very good chicken dinner.  As an alternative, I made another dish and just poured honey mustard salad dressing over the chicken and it was also very good.  Kids love it!

Why didn't I think of this.  My husband loved loved loved it.....but it did have bacon on it.  Like the video shows I pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave for a couple minutes to give it a head start and it cooked perfectly in the final 10 minutes with the cheese.  I just used bottled honey mustard as I have some I want to use up. I seasoned the chicken with my favorite seasonings as we are not crazy about lemon pepper.  I felt the chicken was a tad overcooked, not deal breaker overcooked, just a tad so I might adjust the cooking times next time...and there will be a next time.  It's just so easy and tasty!

Since I'm back in college I have no time.  This an incredibly easy and wonderful dish. My husband loved it, and no left overs. I prepared it as to the recipe...too easy not to! I agree the bacon added some extra flavor! I might try a small slit in a large breast and add some cheese.

my family loved this! After reading a few reviews and seeing some people had issues with the bacon being under cooked or over cooked. I decided to cook the bacon in a skillet on top of the stove and then chopped it up and sprinkled it on top during the last 5 minutes along with the cheese.  I also took the advice and added a little cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it a little. Came out perfect!

So delicious and easy. I did change it a little and it was fantastic. Used honey and Dijon mustard to my liking. Added cornstarch to thicken like others did. Definitely a must. Cooked the bacon ahead of time and then crumbed and put aside. Pounded out the chicken to make them thin. Salt and peppered the chicken and then poured a thin layer of the honey/mustard on the bottom of the greased baking dish. Put the chicken on top and poured on the remaining h/m mixture.  Covered and baked at 350 for 30 min. Uncovered the chick and sprinkled the crumbled bacon over each breast. Topped with freshly shredded cheddar cheese since I didn't have mozzarella. Cooked til cheese was bubbly. Delicious!!!

This was a GREAT recipe! I was shocked with the ingredients at how good it tasted. I used Dijon mustard and mixed it with the honey, and didn't have any mozzarella so I used cheddar. My husband gave it an 8 out of 10, mind you he's very picky! I also added cornstarch to the sauce at the same time I added the cheese. This will definitely be added into the rotation due to taste and how easy it is!
Thanks for the recipe!!

Sorry but this was not a hit at our house.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good.  There's way too much sauce which didn't adhere to the chicken...it just pooled all over the pan.  Also, I was never able to get the bacon crispy which ended up rubbery.  The bacon was underdone and the chicken was overdone. Thanks anyway!

I cut the chicken breasts in half for smaller servings. I followed the recipe steps, but realized that the chicken needed to cook for 50 minutes not 25 (and the additional 10). I then pre-cooked the turkey bacon and added the mozzarella for the last 10 minutes. My family really enjoyed this dish.

I thought it was pretty good; hubby didn't care for it. It has a very strong and unique flavor, but it was very sweet so I'm glad I only used 1/2 cup of honey instead of 3/4. I also followed the comments and mixed the honey and mustard before putting it on the chicken, which was definitely a good idea.

I don't know that the cheese really adds anything, so if I made it again, I'd probably leave it out. No need for the extra calories when it is overpowered by the sauce anyway.

I originally made this recipe as is and thought it was good, but not excellent so 4 stars as the recipe is written.  However the 2nd time I followed the suggestions of others and wrapped the chicken with bacon and then coated it with the honey mustard.  It was so good!  5 stars with more BACON!

My family really enjoyed this!  I didn't have mustard so I used dijon.  The changes I will make next time is to add the bacon sooner and cook the chicken less.  Our bacon was a little underdone, and the chicken was a little overdone.  Other than that, it was fantastic!

Very quick, easy & delicious! Used Dijon mustard instead of regular mustard & prosciutto instead of bacon, turned out very well & maybe lighter without the bacon! Will be making again for a weeknight meal!

We LOVED this recipe, but only after a few changes.
French's Dijon plus Chardonnay with the honey. I added a pinch of Smoked Paprika, Ancho Chile Powder, and Crushed Red Pepper Flakes. I precooked and crumbled the Bacon and used a smoked Provolone instead of Mozzarella. My husband called this the "best chicken of our marriage."

everyone loved this theother night when I made it. I didn't have bacon so I did skip that. I am going to tryit again with bacon next time but it seems like it could only make it better!

This is an easy and delicious recipe to make.  My husband, who is somewhat picky, said this makes the top ten.  Will be making this again for sure.  I did as some of the others and used real bacon bits and the italian 6 cheese blend for the last 10 minutes and it turned out really good this way.  Bacon gave it good crunch and texture yet the chicken was tender.  Only cooked for a total of 25 minutes as I used a chicken breast fillet cut for thinner meat.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is SO delicious and easy to make!  My husband and picky kids can't get enough of it.  I like to add spicy mustard to give it a little kick and put the bacon on in the beginning so it gets a little crispier.   I have yet to serve it to anyone who doesn't love it!

I'm not a chef, but this is one recipe that even I could not mess up. Not only is it easy but it also comes out tasting amazing. The only thing I changed about the recipe was that I used dijon mustard and put cut up potatoes in the baking dish with the chicken, and those came out really nice as well. I would highly recommend this dish and plan on making it often.

a bit too sweet/too much honey. I changed to be +1/2 and 1/2 c each on the honey/mustard + 1/4 c mayonnaise. Less sweet and the mayo helped keep the chicken more most. I also used dijon mustard. A technical difficulty with the bacon: I knew for sure that the bacon was NOT going to get crispy baing on top of the chicken for only the last 10 minutes as instructed. I put the bacon on at the very beginning. And it still took 50 min to get crispy. By then the chicken was overcooked. So.....you really need to start with  bacon that is partially cooked here.

Used agave instead of honey and used dijon mustard.  Mustard was a bit on the strong side so next time will add a little more of the agave to balance it out.  Also, will bake for a shorter period since these came out a little on the dry side after the recommended baking time and temperature.

This was super yummy! It made for good leftovers, especially if warmed in the oven. We changed the recipe ever so slightly, and instead of shredding the mozzarella for the topping, we thinly sliced it. It melted smoothly over the chicken and the leftovers had the cheese in each bite. We look forward to using this recipe again and again!

This had great flavor!  If you double the recipe, don't make the same mistake I did and double the honey too!  You really only need to increase the honey by a couple of tablespoons if you do 8 chicken breast halves instead of 4.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the advice of others and put the bacon in from the begnning however after the cook time the bacon was still not done.     The taste was pretty good and I would be willing to try it again just plan to cook the bacon a little before hand and not wrap the bteast since the bacon under the breast didn't cook at all.

Very tasty.  I used a coarse dijon instead of regular mustard.  I put bacon on the whole time and still didn't get done.  Next time I will use thinner slices of bacon.  Don't overcook chicken the first time (dries it out), but you can reheat in leftover sauce and it carmelizes.  Yummmm

I made this today with a minor change. I used white simple syrup and yellow mustard instead of honey... It was excellent. the family loved it. I also use  another suggestion from another review and added a lil starch to thicken the sauce a lil.

I wanted to try this because my family loves Honey Baked Chicken II from this site and this is a similar recipe with the additions of bacon and mozzarella. My family ate it but asked me not to make it again. They commented that the honey really dominated and the bacon and mozzarella didn't add anything special.  Honey Baked Chicken II has curry powder in the sauce which seems to really balance out the cloying sweetness.  I'll stick that recipe from now on.

I was surprised at how tasty this actually was. The idea of mustard and chicken was not an appealing thought but it was fantastic. After making this dish my daughter told me that I have been making the greatest dinners (I have been using allrecipes.com a lot lately).

This recipe was fast and totally delicious!Like a few other reviewers I omitted the bacon and cheese, and I used chicken thigh, and it was still amazing. I just liked the sauce itself and could see using the mixture for a few different dishes or even as a marinade for grilling.

delicious, and with a little morning prep it makes a great weeknight meal.  Service with roasted broccoli and rice.

I don't think I can ever go back to regular barbeque sauce after making this. I added some spices to the chicken before wrapping it with the bacon and did put it in the broiler after 30 minutes or so so the bacon would get crispy. I also added some spicy brown mustard in with regular mustard. I also saved any leftover BBQ sauce to use with other meats during the week.

This chicken was delicious. It is a fast and easy way to fix chicken. The honey mustard mixture really gives it a great taste. Something different instead of the same old seasonings i normally put on my baked chicken. I added a few  fresh diced mushrooms on top of bacon. Great hit in my kitchen!

This recipe is soo easy and soo delicious!! As other reviews is used Dijon mustard with a little spicy mustard, minced garlic & honey then dashed the chicken tenderloins with 'Franks Hot Sauce' cause we like a little kick-cooked tenderloins for 18 mins-in the meantime I crisped some bacon in a skillet then crumbled over top of the chicken with shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Broiled that for 5 mins or less.  Sooo tasty!  Thanks for recipe!

This recipe is one of the worst I've ever had.  WAY too much mustard and all around just terrible.  I threw out the whole pan after 3 bites. I'd give it zero stars but the site won't let me.

Excellent.  Love the various flavors.  The boneless, skinless chicken breasts I buy are quite thick so I cut them in half to make them thinner.

Love, love, love this recipe.  After reading through the reviews, I made a few adjustments.  I made the sauce with equal parts honey and dijon mustard - make however much you want.  I found that a little more than 1/2 cup each was plenty.  I also omitted the lemon pepper, these had plenty of flavor without it.  I used chicken tenderloins, so I reduced the baking time to 20 minutes and they were done but still moist.  I cooked the bacon in the microwave while the chicken was in the oven, then crumbled it.  I added the crumbled bacon and colby jack cheese to the top of the chicken, baked until the cheese was melted, about 7 minutes.  My husband fell in love with me all over again for making this, and my kids actually ate something new!  Definitely adding this to our dinner rotation.

I thought this was very simple to make and super delicious.  I think I just may have gotten a little carried away with the mustard..lol  I will definitely use less next time.  I did use bacon strips on half of my dish and also used bacon bits on the other half.  I think bacon bits tastes better and seemed to add more flavor.

Fast and Easy.  We really liked this recipe.  I used Hellman's Honey Mustard which had a bit more flavor and made this dish even easier to prepare.  Place the bacon on during the initial baking if you want it to be crisp and add the cheese for the last 10 minutes.  Delicious!

Very nice recipe and so easy.  I was concerned that too much honey/mustard was used, but not at all.  I did precook the bacon lightly, to be sure it was crisp.  This will be a regular meal for us.

If you like a little sparkle to your food, try what I did! I drizzled maple syrup over the chicken, then brushed jalopeno mustard as well as dijon onto the breasts. Baked accordingly then placed the bacon on top of each breast and covered with Kraft italiano cheese. The family loved it.

I used 5 breasts and kept sauce ingredients the same. It made a lot of sauce. We found this way too sweet for our liking. But, with the 2 leftover breasts, I discarded the extra sauce and made chicken salad with mayo, dill relish, celery, pepper and a little extra mustard. Good, with just a touch of sweetness.

Absolutely amazing.  I kept the oven temperature to the recipe and left out the bacon.  I also went with Parmesan cheese instead of mozzarella.  My wife said it was one of the best chicken I have ever made.

The honey/mustard was a bit over-powering for what we like (plus it easily stains!!).  I did as another reviewer suggested and wrapped each breast in bacon - MISTAKE!!  It became very greasy and difficult to crisp on both sides.  It smelled great cooking though :)

This was a good, quick entree that was enjoyed by everyone in my family.  I mixed the honey & mustard together first and then covered both side of the chicken with it.  I precooked my bacon in the microwave and added it with the cheese at the last ten minutes.  I highly recommend lining your dish with aluminum foil for easy cleanup, due to the honey.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, Sarahbea!

I made this for dinner tonight. I thought it was very tender and I loved the flavor. Super easy too. I added a tiny splash of white cooking wine to my honey-mustard mixture, and sprinkled my chicken breasts with the lemon pepper and some onion powder before brushing on the honey-mustard.   I've learned my lesson about bake wear, though. I didn't have a big enough Corningwear dish, so I used my metal pan....I guess it's like a bar cookie pan. My poor pan is going in the trash now.....The grease from the bacon mixed with the other juices and just baked onto my pan. :-(

I used dijon mustard (and blended the honey/mustard before pouring over the chicken) and otherwise followed recipe as written. Easy to throw together and very tasty. It was nice and tangy, and the cheese & bacon with it were great!!

This chicken is delish.  I've made it a couple of times and all the  kids make sure they're home for it.  I even gave it out on an e-mail recipe chain letter. I mixed the honey and mustard together before pouring over the chicken.  Yum

My husband made this last night and we loved it.  It will definitely be enjoyed again.  He changed nothing but amounts, as it was only for the 2 of us, and he used low fat products when possible, but it was delicious!

I'm not sure why my DH and I didn't like this recipe. We both love honey mustard & like chicken, but the mustard seemed too strong and we just didn't care for it. The bacon should be cooked first and there is way too much sauce.

Tastes wonderful, however it looks unappealing. I think next time I'll follow other reviewers advice and use dijon mustard instead since I think that might help!

This is pretty darn tasty and smells great! The only thing I had to change was after I added the cheese and bacon, it didn't crisp in bake mode. Next time I think I'll try switching the broiler to low and browning it that way. Also the recipe didn't call to mix the honey and mustard together, which I think next time I may try so its more even. I also added the cornstarch halfway through to thicken it up, worked like a charm!

Excellent recipe and ridiculously easy!  I used a course ground mustard instead of regular prepared mustard and only added fresh ground pepper instead of lemon pepper.  I didn't care for the lemon pepper the first time that I made this recipe.  Will make again (and again)!

This was good did not use the bacon and cheese and actually used maple flavoured syrup since honey is a bit expensive here and it came out really well.

We did not like this, as the chicken was dry and not very tasty.  Took a lot longer for everything to cook than what was listed in the recipe.  Will not make it again.

Excellent dish. Easy and delicious. I did not have lemon pepper so I just added a splash of lemon juice to honey-mustard mixture. Even my husband who does not like sweeter dishes said this was excellent. It is a keeper!

This turned out pretty good. My whole family of picky eaters really liked it. I followed the recipe exactly. I think next time I might try using dijon mustard instead of the yellow, but I will make this again.

I think this is a very attractive dish but I am not too sure about the taste. It seemed like an awful lot of honey IMO. Be sure to mix the honey and the mustard in a bowl before you drizzle it on. I don't think putting it on separately worked out too well for me. Since the cheese only takes a few minutes to melt, I would add it at the very last minute AFTER you are 100% sure that the chicken was done. My chicken was just not getting up to the correct temp in a very timely manner so the cheese was just a little over done by the time I pulled it out of the oven. I did pre-cook the bacon on the stove which was a very good suggestion.

VERY good! I took the advice of previous reviews and used swiss instead of Mozerella, dijon mustard, and I cooked the bacon before adding it in the oven.

To me, this recipe was pretty good. The bacon does'nt add much and the cheese needs to be sharper. I probably won't make this again.

Everyone in my food picky family loved this one. I substituted Trader Joe's Apple Smoked Turkey Bacon for regular bacon and it was just great. Actually, the bacon was a bit more like thin sliced cured ham. This is a wonderful recipe and my son who HATES mustard even liked this one a lot!

Oh my goodness!!  I will say I made some slight alteration to this recipe but it still gets 5 stars because my husband who is not a fan of chicken even had a second helping of this.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and wrapped the chic breast in bacon, then I drizzled already prepared honey mustard over before baking.  I did not have mozzarella on hand so used swiss cheese instead.  It was fantastic.  I will definately be making this again, even for company.  Thank you for offering this recipe

This was very easy and pretty tasty.  Next time I will use a lot more honey/mustard mix...couldn't really taste it.  Also cheated and used the ready cooked bacon and added that in with the cheese.

Excellent! I made this for the first time for my father and VERY picky husband.  2 days later, they're both still talking about it!  I followed the advice of others, in that I wrapped two pieces of bacon around each breast as well as dijon mustard. mmmmm!!!  I will definitely be making this again - soon!!

This was an awesome dish. I cooked the bacon separate and then crumbled it on the chicken...used swiss cheese (personal thing there) and then broiled. The next day I used the the leftovers as a sandwhich. Warmed up and put on a sweet Italian bread. No condiments neccessary...Really Really good and loved by the whole house!

Pretty darn good stuff.  The bacon & honey mustard add a ton of flavor but they also push the calories up quite a bit.  I'd like to try a leaner version next time.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  I also wrapped the bacon around the chicken.  One thing though, there isn't even close to enough sauce if you plan to have this over rice or noodles like we did.  I will double the sauce next time.

Easy to make. Chicken was moist and tender. But the mozzarella cheese was to bland. It needs a different cheese. Asiago might be good or even cheddar.

made twice, first time used regular mustard and didn't turn out all that great. second time used dijon mustard and tasted much better. I really like the fact that you can make the honey mustard to your taste. served over rice and will make again.

This is a great recipe to go from. I cut the chicken halves in half again, generously drizzled with honey, lightly (mustard is strong!) spread with honey dijon, topped with bread crumbs, added a few slabs of butter and sprinkled with some mozzerella 5 min before it was finished. Dubbed "Kickin Chicken" by my family!!

The flavor combination in this didn't wow me, to be honest. The lemon pepper with the honey and mustard and swiss cheese just didn't taste quite right. But the sauces and cheese made the chicken nice and moist, and it was eaten and enjoyed without complaint by the whole family.

This is very yummy- 5 stars from my family.  Only changes I made were done so because of convenience... I used honey dijon mustard and fresh bacon bits which I put on top of the chicken before baking (because I didn't read the directions properly!).  Thanks for the great share!

OMG! This is THEE best chicken I have ever had in my entire life! It was easier to make then PB&J and oh so delicious! I am in love with this recipe! I didn't have any bacon or mozz cheese and I am picky about only eating chicken breasts. I did use Swiss instead of mozz, but no matter how you make it, this is excellent. OMG!

This is great!!! Taste simliar but not exactly like Arbys chicken bacon swiss (without the swiss of course!) but you get the drift. Not real sure but putting the cheese over the uncooked bacon made the bacon not get crispy. maybe next time i will try to put the bacon on for like 10 minutes and bake it then top it off with cheese and broil it. Definitely will eat it again.

I made this last night - it was quick, easy and left the place smelling like i had spent hours on dinner!  I rated it a 3 because my husband said it was "OK" and when i asked if he would like it again he said "maybe". We both agreed that we thought it needed a little more honey. We added some afterwards and the taste improved alot.  I did run into a problem while cooking it. I always seem to have trouble with recipes that call for baking bacon in the oven. The bacon was NO WHERE near done after the suggested time. We baked it about 10 minutes longer and then ended up having to switch it to broil for a few minutes at the end, that also turned into being about 5. Maybe it's my oven since this is a recurrent problem?  Overall, the recipe and reviews excited me but i gave it a 3 star "C" because i thought the results were just that. If i could give it a C+ I would.

An amazing recipe. My boyfriend & I we're running out ideas for chicken when he found this recipe. We actually made it with regular yellow mustard & kept the cheese and bacon off. Next time we're making it as the recipe states. A+++ for sure!

This tasted good. The bacon did not get as crispy as I would have liked it but, it really did not taste bad. I used half dijon and half regular mustard. It was not too sweet, just right.

This is a great recipe. I cut my chicken breasts in half lengthwise and wrapped them in bacon based on others suggestions. My husband really liked it that way. However I do not like soft bacon, so if you like it crunchy, I would not recommend you cook it that way. Overall great recipe, thanks!

I made this tonight for me and my very fussy hubby also sent sauce to my neighbor to try.  She wanted to try something new to show aduld Son she could cook after all these years. Very Very impressed.  We all loved it.  As others said, a little too much sauce and cheese seems to disappear.  I put under broiler to crisp bacon and cheese(I uses monterey jack and cheddar).  All in all was delicious. Will make again,maybe add a little ginger? Or some orange rind w/soy sauce for different flavor? Great receipe to play with.  Thanks!!

I used dijon mustard and I think I used too much.  It was still pretty good and I will make it again, but will go lighter on the mustard. Thanks for a great combo of flavors!

What an easy and delicious dish!  I waited for the bacon to crisp and then added the cheese.

it was sooooo good! my terribly picky family all loved it! I wrapped 2 slices of bacon around each chicken breast at the begining, and mixed regular and dijon mustard. I also added 1/2 cup honey instead of 3/4 for the more mustardy flavor. (my family aren't very honeyish people). I flipped them half way through and added some more sauce and pepper. and cheese i did mozerella and cheddar. it was delicious and i will make it again!

This was a huge hit at my dinner party for 4! I used spicy brown mustard and cooked the bacon ahead of time. Just added the bacon and cheese in the last 10mins of cooking. The chicken came out tender and delicious! Thank you!

As I prepared this recipe I thought it was a little questionable, but it turned out GREAT! No changes necessary, it's yummy just the way it is. My husband hates mustard, but even he loved it. I will definitely make this one again!

I don't know how people could rate this recipe as as anything other than poor.  The mustard taste was overwhelming, and none of the flavors went together to make an enjoyable meal.  Very disappointing.

Just made this for the first time, and am extremely pleased with the results.  The only changes I made were to use brown sugar instead of honey (didn't have any honey on hand) and add a pinch of curry powder and a 1/4 c. mayo to the brown sugar/mustard mixture.  Excellent, delicious, easy.

Family raved about this dish.  Very easy to prepare.  The only change I made was to fry the bacon crisp and crumble over the chicken before adding the cheese.  Wasn't to sure about how this would turn out, not being a big fan of cooking with honey, but it was really delicious and will be making this again and again.

Made this last night, kids wouldn't touch it. I wish I listened to the other reviews and used a Dijon mustard and not yellow mustard. I thought the mustard was too strong as well. I think next time i would try it with a BBQ sauce.

YUMMY! My girlfriend and I got together for a 'girl's night' and this was the dish we chose to try for dinner. The chicken was excellent and the both of us were so pleased! I paired the chicken with asparagus and some rice pilaf, but there are tons of options of what can be served alongside the yummy chicken breasts. My boyfriend ate the left-overs the next afternoon and he asked if I could make it fresh for him some day- this is a keeper, as no one can ever go wrong with bacon :D

This is a staple in my family. If I'm running late, I'll precook the chicken, just fry in a pan for 3 min per side and use back bacon. Then place everything in a pan, which cuts the baking time in half.

Very tastey!! My husband loved it!! I eat low carb so I used sugar free honey and it turned out great!  After reading reviews (thanks guys), I added my bacon when I first put in oven so bacon would cook more and added the cheese later as the recipe suggested we are also not a lemon pepper kinda family so I just used salt and pepper - excellent!

Mmmm.  Mixed spicy brown mustard together with honey and lemon pepper seasoning (added a little extra fresh ground pepper for pizzazz) to make a sauce and coated the chicken well, pouring rest of sauce in pan, basting occasionally and flipping chicken twice.  Basted again after adding bacon, then topped with the cheese.  Next time, I think I would hold off on the cheese until the bacon is cooked.

it was a very simple easy recipe to follow and you can add so much to it.  i cooked the chicken 15 mins longer before i put the bacon and cheese on.  to make sure that the chicken was mostly cooked.  i will definitely make it again.

This was great !  One of our first attempts at a receipe from this site and it was delicious !  Only thing I did differently was used less chicken but kept the rest of the ingredients the same which allowed for extra dressing that saved for the perfect salad dressing the next day.  I also broiled the bacon at the last minute.  What I would do different next time would be to put the mozzarella on before the bacon and then broil as it would have allowed for an even crispier bacon.   Common sense I know but I am still learning !!  Overall this was a great receipe.

This dish was pretty easy to make. I found it to be tasty as well, although we tend to prefer a little more spice. I did alter the mustard/honey to suit my taste however, and the recipe is easy to tweak.

We liked this quite a bit.  I used just regular honey mustard since we had it on hand.  I cooked the bacon in a skillet while the chicken was cooking and crumbled it on top instead of using the strips.  Then we cooked some potatoes in the bacon grease and served with a salad.  Not very healthy, but still very good on the whole.  But I wanted a little more flavor from the chicken.  Maybe it needed to be marinated or something.  I'll play with it, but it will definately stay in the rotation.

I too struggle with finding chicken recipes for my husband so whenever I find a new one I try it. This recipe was wonderful and even better my husband really liked it. I tried sweet & spicy mustard which added a little more flavor. I also cooked the bacon for a couple of minutes in the microwave for a little extra crispyness. Thanks for this recipe.

Absolutely delish!!!!!! Pre-mixed the honey with French's prepared onion mustard. Only minor observation and probably something that can't be fixed - melted mozzarella doesn't stay on the meat - you cut into it and it sloughs off the chicken. It would be nice if it somehow stayed on the meat.. Otherwise - a GREAT dish - my son gave it a 4.999.

This recipe was very good. My family enjoyed it very much. I did do some changes. I butterflied my chicken breast and I lightly seasoned the chicken.  I mixed the mustard and honey and poured it over and baked it.  I turned them around halfway to get the other side colorful. At that point I wrapped the bacon all around and put the cheese over it. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. It was a hit. I will make this again.

What a special Saturdy night dinner for two! This was so easy and very good not to mention very eye appealing!This is company worthy and I will be making this for a family dinner soon! I did make some changes and took the advise of other reviewers. I wrapped the whole breast half with bacon from the start, using 2 slices of bacon. Then drizzled the sauce which I mixed together. I baked for about an hour uncovered so the bacon was well cooked. Very moist and I'm fussy about white meat of chicken because it is often dry but not this time! I served this with my crockpot cheesey potatos and peas.
I have made this so many time since reviewing this great chicken! Many times I have used chicken tenders or cut breast into strips and serve them as an appitizer or a second entree. Everyone loves these! A great make ahead dish. Make them ahead and just pop into the oven when ready!

I made this last night for supper and it truly was delicious not to mention quick and easy!  I liked all the flavors together.  I used split chicken breast and thighs (My husband thinks boneless is too dry, but I don't) anyway,it turned out great, and I used real bacon bits to save time.  My son loved this too!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I will definitely make this again, although I may halve the mustard and honey.  It just seemed like more covered the cooking dish than the chicken.  We also thought this would be an even better sandwich, on a roll.

This is pretty good.  I also thought it tasted a little heavy on the mustard.  I would maybe cut back on it a little.  I sprinkled the chicken with lemon pepper before putting the honey mustard on it.  I fried up my bacon before putting it on the chicken.  Then once I added the bacon and cheese, I just left it in the oven long enough to melt the cheese - the bacon was already cooked.

Made this for my husband tonight, he really liked it.  I used suggestions from other reviewers such as using part spicy brown mustard and part regular yellow mustard.  Did not use the bacon.  Still turned out pretty good.  Will make again.

This recipe is really...mustardy!  I don't know...I like mustard but it was a bit much.  I used 50/50 Dijon and yellow.  Maybe that was the problem.  But hey - it was something different!  Gotta mix it up.

This is a family favorite and I just wanted to share an easy fix for the raw bacon it calls for. I use either leftover cooked bacon or store bought ready crisp bacon and it is always ready in the last 10 mins.

Love this recipe. Simple and quick for the after work dinner. Kids love it too. I match mine with some instant potatoes and frozen peas. Leaves time to enjoy the evening with the family instead of spending it in the kitchen all night!

Really great weeknight chicken recipe.  The only modifications I made were the ones in the video of pre-cooking the bacon and using brown mustard.  I think we'll try just mixing up the honey & mustard to baste some chicken an hour before, and again during, grilling.

Very tasty and pretty easy.   I'll make this again.  I doubled the recipe with half breast and half thigh meat.  I used a combination of mustards  - dijon, honey, yellow & a little spicy brown.  I combined the mustard and honey with some bacon bits then marinated the meat for about 45 minutes in the sauce before cooking.  I used real bacon bits instead of bacon to top it off with as well.  At the 25 minute mark, I took about a half cup of sauce from the pan and combined it with 2 Tbsps. of corn starch (shook it together in a sealed, glass jar) then poured it over the chicken before adding the bacon and cheese. Delicious!

Tasted ok, you have to cook the bacon fully before putting it on the chicken to get it nice and crispy. Otherwise it’s super fatty.

My husband Liked it as well.  Not sure how I did it, but my chicken was a little dry, however lots of juice in the dish. I must have just cooked it a little too long. The flavour was really good, loved the bacon with it.  Will definitely try again, hopefully not overcook it

what a delicious recipe! I used wholegrain mustard as that's all I had, and my whole family loved it!
I also only used about half the cheese and added a small sprinkle of mature cheddar, which I thought complemented the dish really well. 
will definitely be making this recipe again and again!

Family loved it!!
I added  Ital seasoning to mine along w Lemon Pepper
and mixed imitation bacon bits with the shredded cheese.
Used Italian blend cheese mix, includes mozzarella.
Precooked the Bacon in Mwave so it was well cooked and crispy.
spooned the drippings over mashed potatoes. Too good to waste!

very easy and very tasty.   Great dinner to make when you don't feel like cooking.  It doesn't get any easier than this.  I loved it with the bacon and the cheese but I'm sure it would be good without also.

I wouldn't say this is a 'throw it in the oven and relax' although we did enjoy it.  I wanted to make sure the bacon was done crispy so I did pre-bake it before adding to the chicken, which also meant there was less grease later. The sauce was good and definitely needed a little cornstarch to thicken. Served with mashed potatoes.

My husband said between bites “this is really good” TWICE!!! I marinated my chicken for a day and a half, which really sealed in the flavor and made it quite tender. I put precooked bacon strips on top and sprinkled the cheese on for the last few minutes, and served with a side of rice. I used some of the leftover marinade to mix with a little cornstarch to thicken up the sauce and pour a little over the rice. Try this one, you wont be disappointed!

There are only two of us so I cut the recipe in half. It was really delicious however I think next time I’ll use less honey and Dijon as it was still way too much sauce for 2 chicken breasts. The tip in the video to microwave the bacon 1st was a good tip. Though I didn’t cut the time in half and over did my bacon. Very yummy though, I’ll definitely be making it again.

As other people said, it took much longer than 10 minutes to get the bacon to even cook thoroughly. It wasn't the best, but it also wasn't the worst thing ever. My fiance really liked the sauce, but the honey taste was a bit too much for me. Kind of felt like I was eating candy chicken. If you like sweet food, this would definitely be a good one to try.

Tasty dish and I really appreciated how easy it was to make.  I didn't have bacon strips so I used bacon bits and they worked very well. I also used a dijon and yellow mustard mix. It was a little sweet so I may cut down on the honey a bit next time. Overall it was very good and cleanup was a snap too!

Excellent and easy recipe.  I only had jalapeno mustard and used it.  The honey cancelled out most of the heat and it was great.  I read a review about using a little bit of cornstarch to thicken the juice and putting precooked cut up bacon on top (to eliminate the grease) and it was great.  I did bake at 350 for 35 minutes and had cut the breasts lengthwise; then topped with cheese and bacon until cheese was melted.  A definite keeper!

The chicken was exceptionally juicy and the honey-mustard sauce was very tasty.  This may sound weird, but I used some of that sauce on my loaded mashed potatoes.  We will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy to make but only used 1/2 cup of honey instead of 3/4 and served with buttered egg noodles and California veggie mix. Amazing! Might try with tukey bacon for heathier option next time.

3 as is, if add mushrooms and colby/jack cheese you have Outback Alice Spring Chicken.  Much more flavorable.

I made this when my mom and sister came to visit.  They raved about it!!!!  As many others have said, I used dijon mustard.  I also tried to wrap the bacon.  It definitely needed a couple of minutes in the broiler to crisp the bacon.  In the future, I would not wrap it, but place it just over the top.  The bottom of the bacon was too underdone for my liking.  I LOVE bacon, but I must say, if you don't, I think the recipe would still be great without it.  The flavor of the glaze is flavorful enough to stand on its own. I will absolutely be making this again!

This was delicious and simple! My boys love all things bacon and the bacon added delicious taste to the chicken. The only tricky part was when to put the bacon on top. Mine needed more than the alloted 10 minutes, hence the chicken got a little dry. Next time I would put the bacon on for 15-20 min before the end of cooking the chicken and then put the cheese on for the last few minutes.

I made it just like the recipe stated and my family liked it. Next time I will try a more flavorful cheese such as cheddar or Monterey Jack however. Also I mixed the honey and mustard and poured it over the chicken. It made quite a bit of sauce so I wasn't sure that was right but it cooked down and turned out fine. Also I cooked the bacon much of the way in the microwave then put it on top of chicken for last 10 minutes. It did not burn and seemed to be the way to go.  I will definitely make it again! Oh and it was particularly good with mashed potatoes.

I made it with Dijon mustard...everything else the same.  The family loved it.  Will definitely make again.   Only thing...honey is expensive  so I am going to try less sauce next time just to see if I can save some dough.  Lol.  Great recipe thanks for posting.

I had high expectations, but I've eaten a totally tasteless chicken. No salt, no seasoning.

This is a GREAT recipe as family ALL LOVED IT and so so simple!!! and  has so much potential for changes just for diversity in dinner rotation... I made a second time using gorganzola cheese and regular mustard sooo good next I will eliminate the honey and use honey mustard and whatever cheese I have on hand... and you could spice it up with hot mustard and pepperjack... no limit to using whatever is on hand and its still going to be sooo good THANK YOU it will be a go to on my busy work night!!

This was an easy, tasty, yummy recipe. The bacon really adds to this delicious dish. It doesn't matter if you use honey dijon mustard or just prepared yellow mustard and honey. Do not cover this dish with foil when baking in the oven. The sauce will be runny and the bacon soggy if you cover it with foil. I normally  cut my chicken breasts in half to make them thinner and I recommend it for this recipe too. My family went on and on about how much they loved it. Thanks for sharing!

Quite good and the family liked it.  I laid foil in the pan for easier clean up and next time I will mix the honey mustard before spreading on the chicken.  I will cut the bacon into chunks so it crisps easier

I was pleasantly surprised by this dish, considering I don't like mustard very much. I would make a few changes. The recipe says to drizzle, which I did and then I ended up spreading it with a knife. The end result was an uneven mix of super sweet chicken and super mustard-y chicken. Next time, I'll mix the mustard and honey and then spread it for an even coat. I'll probably also follow other's suggestions and wrap the chicken in bacon. I laid it across in strips like suggested and it fell right off when I cut in to see if the chicken was done.

But these changes are really more for convenience than taste. If I liked mustard more than I do, it probably would've gotten 5 stars.

Excellent recipie.  Used Cherrywood smoked bacon and just put the strip on top and let the cheese hold it on.  We will be making this often.

Wonderful and easy!  I added the bacon from the beginning, wrapping a piece around each breast before placing it in the oven.  I also used an "Italian Style 6-Cheese Blend" for the cheese as opposed to just plain mozzarella.  I did not find it necessary to thicken the sauce with cornstarch as some one else suggested.

Made it in a Nu-Wave oven. Did not like how the honey/mustard mixed; would have pre-mixed it before applying it, but otherwise was delicious.

I followed one review and sprayed Pam and wrapped whole chicken breast in bacon, put  on chicken breast seasonings lemon pepper,  garlic  powder ,onion powder, lemon pepper and put honey mustard(Dijon and yellow) over chicken. Bacon browns on its own, then last 5-10 minutes used turkey Baster and pulled all fluid out and added 1 heaping tablespoon of cornstarch /water) and put it back in dish in oven and put mozzarella on top and melted. Was perfect- don't add much salt due to bacon. Served over rice. Perfect! Done in 1 hour.

Very easy to make. Lemon pepper complimented the sauce well and the bacon really made this dish. Add as much cheese as you want, it can only make it better.

This was amazing!  There was a little too much mustard for our liking (we don't like much mustard), but that still doesn't take away from the fact that this was a 5 star meal.  

Next time I will also cook the bacon a little bit before I put it on the chicken.  It wasn't done enough for me.

When you place the bacon on set under broiler until bacon is crisp, drain and then add cheese.

Delicious, but the sauce burned after about 20 min, so I had to transfer to another pan.  Also, I like my bacon crisp, so next time will precook it before putting it on the chicken.

I did NOT change ingredients, only some of the directions.  I pre-cooked the bacon a little bit (as suggested by  another cook) so it would be crispier. I also mixed the mustard and honey together before drizzling over the chicken. My family loved the chicken so I will make this again. Next time I will use a mixture of spicy and salad mustard to mix with the honey and may use Colby Jack cheese instead of mozzarella for addition flavor.

I made this with boneless pork chops, cut in half lengthwise. Laid a half strip of bacon on each piece and baked for 25 minutes (probably 20 would have been enough), then broiled for a few minutes, then returned to baking (about 15 minutes) with the cheese. My husband and I really liked it, I will make it again.

I made this tonight for dinner but will confess to a few changes.  I used three full size boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  I cut them in half lengthwise and filled the center with cooked bacon and mozzarella cheese.  I proceeded to bake the chicken for about 40 minutes.  Once they were properly checked for temperature I brushed store bought honey mustard salad dressing over the top of each breast and let the juices sit for a few minutes.  The husband loved it and I thought it was pretty good myself.

I loved this recipe and so did my family! The combination of the bacon with the chicken and the sweet taste was a big hit!!  The only thing I did different was to follow one of the suggestions, and that was to let the bacon cook first before I put the cheese on.  It was the only way I could really be sure that the bacon was cooked thoroughly. And my total cook time ended up being 55 min. 

The next time, I also think that I might mix the honey with the mustard, and then drizzle it over the chicken. There were a couple of times Thant my son and I bit into the chicken and all you could taste was mustard. That is the only thing I would change.

I also served my chicken with baked red potatoes which was wonderful. However I think the idea of serving it with rice is great too, and will do that the next time.  The sauce left in the pan is so good, and would be great over rice.

I used a already made honey mustard and lathered the chicken with it. On top of that I sprinkled garlic powder & some Italian seasoning and baked it at 350 for 45 min. Thanks added mozzarella & a Italian 5 cheese mix... it was soooo delicious, I'm mad I forgot to take a picture before it was Inhaled! I made some olive oil & garlic angel hair pasta to go on the side!

This is a decent recipe overall. As some other reviewers suggested, I used dijon mustard instead of yellow. I added the cheese for the last ten minutes of cooking time. The taste was okay, but I thought it needed something else to make it a bit more flavorful.

This was very good and it was quick to make. I didn't have honey on hand but I had Ken's Honey Mustard Dressing/Dipping Sauce which my family loves for dipping chicken fingers. Also, the bacon required more than 10 minutes to crisp up so I needed to change it from bake to low broil for a few minutes. My husband told me to put this in my favorites. I will definitely make this again. I will try the original version with the honey and mustard next time and maybe precook the bacon a bit and I will update my review.

I used an Italian 5-cheese mix as I didn't have any Mozarella cheese, otherwise followed the recipe.  I was very pleased at how easy it was to make and how good it tasted. My husband and I agreed that it was excellent.  I served it with couscous, yellow squash and Brussel sprouts.
I will definitely make this again.

Any recipe that I try where my wife loves it gets a 5 star rating.  She is very "picky" when it comes to food with sauces and seasonings. I did go with one change that  other reviewers mentions.  I used Dijon mustard. I used the broiler at the very end of cooking to help crisp up the bacon, then added the cheese.

This was wonderful. I will definitely make it again and try the other user's suggestions of dijon mustard. I only used yellow mustard but still really enjoyed this chicken.

this was really good ! i took the advice of a few others and used Dijon mustard and added just a little yellow mustard . i also added some corn starch to make it a little thicker . i cooked the bacon in the microwave for 4 minutes  so it would get crispy quicker when i put it on the chicken . i also broiled it once i put the cheese first  both mozzarella  and cheddar and then bacon on it . we all loved it ! i will definitely be making this again . oh i also used maple bacon . i think it went real good with the honey mustard .... i also seasoned to my liking

We make this all the time, my whole family loves it!  To make it easy, I use French's Honey Mustard.  Then I use garlic salt and some pepper.  For the bacon, if you use precooked bacon, it crisps up perfectly without drying chicken out.

So easy and super good. My four year old and 8 year old even gobbled every bite up. I followed exactly except no cheese... It wasn't intentional- just forgot but it was delicious without it so I guess that saved a few calories :) will be adding this to the quick and easy weeknight rotation.

I made it as suggested.  However, I used precooked bacon instead of raw.  I would also probably mix up the mustard a bit.  But, it was still good.

I give this 5 stars because it's quick, easy, and delicious!  I poured honey mustard on the chicken and baked it for 20 minutes.  I used bacon bits that I had on hand, then added mozzarella cheese.  I baked it an additional 5 minutes.  Tender and yummy!

I think I must've done something wrong. The chicken was entirely too salty.  I may try again and withhold on the seasoning a little.

I made this dish and the family enjoyed it.  The one thing I'll do is pound the chicken breast to an even thickness. I had cut and precooked the bacon.

First time ever making this and it was delicious! Had to add a little extra mustard (I used yellow) because I'm not a huge fan of honey. The bacon also didn't crisp in the oven so i may just cook them before hand and add them on. In the end it was amazing!

Easy and fast, love that I can adjust the amount of honey to mustard sense I'm not overly fond of sweet dinner foods. With 6 kids it's hard to please everyone but I had no complaints with this one. :)

Delicious!  Easy to prepare.  I precooked the bacon and added it with the cheese.  Cook on a foil lined pan for easy clean up.  I recommend using sliced cheese instead of shredded.

So easy, I took it out to add bacon and cheese after 18 minutes and the bacon was perfectly cooked. My family loved it and i'll definitely be making this again.

This is super delicious I used colby jack instead of mozzarella cheese and it came out great I made a little extra honey and dijon mixed for dipping afterward not necessary but I LOVE honey mustard will be making again! Update made a 2nd time minus the bacon and cheese and it's just as delicious very moist flavorful chicken

This is a very good dish. I made a few changes by using turkey bacon rather than normal bacon. This gave it a great taste and made it a bit more healthier. I also broiled it towards the end to brown the cheese and make the bacon more crisper! Great meal and easy to make

I loved the flavors in this! The bacon does seem to take longer than 10 minutes to crisp up. I added the bacon with 15 minutes remaining and put it on broil at the very end.

I would have given it a 4 star, but since my husband was over the moon about it, I gave it a 5! I also wrapped the bacon around the breasts, but found it wasn't crispy enough, so I ended up drying out my chicken.  Even though it's an extra step, next time I'll cook the bacon separately.

My husband liked it.  I didn't care for it too much but then I don't care for chicken breasts.
Need to crisp the bacon before putting on the chicken as per the video, I microwaved the bacon.  I really prefer to fry bacon the old fashioned way.  I find microwaved bacon is tough.

My husband liked it more than I did.  I found it to be a little bland - maybe next time I'll rub half a garlic clove on each chicken breast.

This was the best recipe I've ever made from this site. The only thing I changed was I omitted the lemon pepper (didn't have any) and I pre cooked the bacon. It was so juicy and delicious

DELICIOUS! I cooked the bacon and chopped it up while the chicken was cooking, then sprinkled it on with the mozzarella cheese.  My husband absolutely loved it and it was super quick and easy.

I enjoyed this, and I am not a big fan of chicken.  I made some minor changes. I used thin chicken breasts, and the cooking time was perfect.  I didn't have lemon pepper, so I peppered the chicken. I mixed the honey and mustard together and added a dash of lemon juice.   I poured it on the chicken.  I cooked the bacon in the microwave and then added it for the last ten minutes.  I also added corn starch mixed with cold water to thicken the sauce.   I loved the mixture of the sauce with the bacon and cheese.  It was different and tasty.  ***The leftovers were not nearly as tasty.

Very good, and hubs even liked it despite the mustard part of this.  I used spicy brown mustard and thinned it a bit to get it out of the container (it was the last of it) and subbed a bit of Karo syrup for the honey, which I ran out of at about 1/2 cup.  I added corn starch to the mix as someone had mentioned the sauce is thin; because I'd thinned it out with water already, it wasn't all that thick after baking but was still pretty good.  I topped with Boursin cheese to use it up and used bacon pieces instead of bacon, then baked at 400 for another 15 minutes.  Went over well for dinner.  We have one piece left, but only because I can't do two pieces of chicken at dinner most of the time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this recipe for my grandmother and my parents, they all loved it! The only changes I made were slicing the chicken breasts into thinner pieces and since I wanted to make sure the chicken didn't finish cooking before the bacon I changed the cook times. I put the chicken in for 10 minutes, added the bacon and cheese and baked it for another 15 minutes. I also mixed the honey and mustard together with a little bit of mayonnaise after reading some reviews of the sauce being too runny. It made it a little thicker and kept the chicken very moist.

Super easy to make and it makes the whole house smell delicious! I of course modified the recipe a bit. I crisped the bacon and chopped it up and also sauteed some onions and topped that on the chicken. I served this chicken with a black and jade rice mixture and organic multicolored carrots.

Great recipe!  I recommend pre-cooking the bacon as we are at high altitude and it just didn't want to cook under the cheese. I used both breasts and thighs for the dark meat eaters and everybody enjoyed..

Easy dish that is delicious and very tender.  I forgot to add the lemon pepper but I marinated first with Dijon mustard with honey for a few hours.   I laid the bacon strips across the top as the recipe dictated before baking.  I did broil the bacon to crisp it up after the initial 45 minutes of baking, and then added the cheese and melted that under the broiler.  Picky husband loved it!!!  Thanks for this easy-to-make "keeper" recipe!

Great recipe. We added some extra honey and mustard to the tops (personal preference) but otherwise this recipe was perfect. We've had this a number of times over the years and will continue to do so!

First recipe I ever made and my family loved it! I don't really like mustard, but it was very mild in taste and actually added a good flavor to it.

I was a little disappointed in would have been better just to use the mustard to dip in rather than coat it w/ the sauce.

I tried this recipe last night shortly after reading it. My family absolutely raved about it! I made a couple of additions but otherwise used the recipe as written. I sauteed some orange and yellow peppers, onion, and a bit of garlic powder, in olive oil. That went into the baking dish first. I use boneless, skinless chicken thighs so they went on top. I drizzled everything with the honey mustard and put the bacon on in the beginning. I baked it until the chicken and bacon were done, basting with the juices occasionally, sprinkled a little mozzarella on top and basted again. When the cheese melted we ate. And ate, and ate. Hubby and son didn't even have room for pie!
This one is a real keeper. Kudos to the author.

Very tasty and easy!  I don't like when people review a recipe with changes, but....I just made two tweaks.  I substituted turkey bacon for the regular pork bacon and I added cornstarch to the liquid to thicken it up a bit.  I loved it!

Only made a few adjustments.  I used chicken breast tenderloins (thats what I had in the freezer) I added garlic and a bit of cheddar cheese.  I also cooked this at 325 for about an hour so the chicken was SUPER tender and the sauce was enough to serve over some penne noodles.  This dish was amazing.  My son who is as picky as they come ate it and there were NO left overs!!  YUM!

This recipe is very tasty and delicious! I've rated 4 stars because it took much longer than the estimated bake times. Next time, I will use precooked bacon. It never really got crispy even after using the broiler. Everything else that I was serving was prepared and ready and I had to wait an additional 15 minutes to finally put the main dish on the table! I would also suggest using thicker pieces of chicken (I used thin cut) I feel it would make the meal a little more hearty. Lesson learned, on both counts, but I will definitely make this again!

This was just okay... I found the combination of flavors to be very strange... I think it would have been better without the lemon pepper and bacon.. It certainly wasn't bad....but, just didn't come across with a good strong flavor.

Tried this recipe tonight. I used chicken thighs (that's is what I had on hand);I also used Fresh (or Buffalo style mozzarella). This is what I found... The Bacon should be the top item and for the last few minutes put under the broiler to get a good crisp. Oh, and I sprinkled a little oregano on the top prior to finishing it off. I actually turned the bacon. The flavor is very comforting and good. Husband rating: Keep in recipe box! :-)

Excellent melding of flavors! I used a mix of dijon and spicy brown mustard.  My bacon didn't seem to cook in the allotted time so I cooked it longer and put the broiler on for about 5 minutes.

Only made 2 chicken breasts, wrapped first in bacon. I made less sauce but still had extra. I used 1/2 cup honey, 1/4 cup yellow mustard, and 1 Tbsp Dijon mustard. My boyfriend loved how it got super sticky and crunchy in places. He isn't the biggest chicken fan, nor does he really like sweet things, but he would have eaten another had I made it! Definitely making this again.

It was OK: too sweet for me.  I will make again, though I will change the ratio of honey to mustard.  The amount of sauce of good.  I added 1/2 t. of lemon pepper and could not taste it; I will add more next time.

This was excellent! I pounded the chicken breasts so they were tender and wrapped them in bacon before drizzling the sauce and  putting in the oven.  Baked for 40 min then broiled for a few minutes to crisp the bacon. Then flip the breasts and crisped the bacon on the other sides.

I agree with all the reviews about the bacon not being crispy so next time I will try putting the bacon on first. When we got an end bite that did have crispy bacon though, it was so good! Can't wait to try again.

This is very good.  I only had "real bacon pieces" and used those.  Next time I will use bacon slices. It seemed like too much sauce, but it was good for dipping.

This recipe was fantastic, my husband declared this a keeper after 1 bite. I too had to cook it longer at the end to get the bacon to cook thru.  i would probably try to broil the dish at the end. I substituted spicy Dijon for the regular mustard, gave it a great flavour.

My fiance absolutely loves this! I make it every month for our anniversary! Except I actually use French's Honey Mustard, and it tastes amazing!!!! But it does take more than 10 minutes for the bacon to get crispy it takes about 15-20 minutes. But all around GREAT recipe :D

Made this in Nov. 2012 I followed a few of the other suggestions found in  the reviews. Flattened chicken, used pre-packaged real bacon bits and baked at 350 x30min, covered for the last 10 min and added 1tbs of corn starch to "gravy mix" to thicken. Turned out great!! On my menu for next week! Yummy!!  :-) I'm just learning to cook and all reviews help........Thanks to everyone who leaves tips for us newbies

I will probably try it again, but with honey mustard that's already prepared from the store. We all thought it was too sweet and we didn't use near as much honey as was in the recipe. I love honey mustard and chicken together so I think I'll like it better that way. I also didn't have bacon or lemon pepper to use. I'd cook the bacon most of the way before putting it in the oven for it to be able to get crispy.

I thought this was fabulous! Super easy to prepare and full of flavor. The chicken was very tender and moist. I followed the recipe as written except that I used pre-cooked bacon strips (I love these and use these in place of raw bacon for everything as they crisp up wonderfully with very little effort). Also, the recipe didn't specify to mix the honey and mustard together but I did. I cooked it in an 8x8 glass pan and it came out perfectly. The sauce was rather thin. I would like to thicken it up next time and serve extra over the chicken and maybe with rice. My husband's only complaint was that it was "too mustardy", so next time I think I will use Dijon instead of yellow mustard and/or increase the honey. I look forward to making this again!

It's a keeper!  I know I can do a better job of making this recipe perfect, but even with the mess of a job i made of the bacon/cheese toppings.... I could not quit eating it.  YUMMY

My whole family loved this recipe. The only changes I made was that I used Jack Daniels honey dijon mustard and cooked the bacon before hand. The last 10-15 min I put the bacon on then topped with cheese and baked until cheese was melted.

This was AWESOME..  I cooked it at 400 for 30min then 350 for 30min.. I wrapped the breasts with bacon and covered it in honey mustard and mozzarella then baked.. Everyone loved it.. from grandpa to grandson, it was a hit :)

Tasted great, we just thought that if you put the cheese and bacon inside the chicken it might have worked better, it all kept sliding off the chicken!

I'm not the best cook, but this was so easy & so delicious! My boyfriend even said it tasted like something he would order at a restaurant. After reading other reviews, I wrapped the chicken in bacon, then after 30 minutes I put the oven on broil to crisp the bacon. The only thing I will do differently next time is use cornstarch to thicken up the honey mustard more, because with mine, you couldn't taste it as much as I would've liked. I totally recommend this to everyone though.   Very quick & easy, even for someone like me, who hasn't gotten this whole cooking thing down yet ;)

Awesome!!!! But next time, I will double the bacon and wrap it around the chicken. I mixed the honey and mustard. Next time I will add some seasoning to that mixture (maybe salt,pepper, and sage)

Great reciepe. Only modification I made was I pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave for 2 minutes. Didn't want the chicken to overcook while waiting for the bacon to cook. Served it with homaade potato salad and fresh green beans. Great Sunday dinner.

This was a moist chicken, but other than that, we didn't care for it too much, and I can't point to exactly why! Rather a strange reaction to the recipe, I think. I might make it again with just  the honey mustard mixture, use cornstarch to thichen that mixture up and serve with egg noodles and broccoli. Then maybe I'll sprikle a bit of the cneese and some real bacon bits over this just before it's served over the noodles. This is too good an idea to give up on it. Thank you for the recipe, Sarahbea.

This recipe was fool proof. Very easy to make and yummy. I left the bacon off one of the chicken breast and my 3 year old ate it all up.

I made this just as directed - turned out beautifully and so yummy!  My three year old - who NEVER eats what I make, said "This chicken is yummy!"  Then asked for seconds.  This will definitely be added to my 'frequently made' list!  Thank you!!

I made this for my husband and son. I used Dijon mustard, mixed it with the honey and then dipped the chicken in it. It turned out moist and tender.  I also pre-cooked the bacon. Will definitely make this again.

We love this recipe more every time we make it.  The flavors meld so well together...not too sweet, not too tangy.  Several times I have been out of mozzarella cheese and have used cheddar/colby and it has turned out fabulous.  This one has made it into my "favorites" recipe rotation.

Follow some of the others suggestions. Wrapped 2 pcs of bacon around each breast. Used Dijon mustard and equal amount of Honey. Turned the breasts over half way thru cooking, then back again before adding the cheese. Bake time was about 45 mins.,  then browned the cheese using the broiler.

The taste of this was good - but the recipe needs some adjustments. First of all, there was way too much sauce! Secondly, the bacon should be partially cooked beforehand because it did not crisp up in 10 minutes.

This recipe was not a good as I thought. It was a little dry...but that was probably my fault. And I don't think I really like lemon pepper. But it was super easy and the rest of my family thought it was okay. Not sure though that I would try it again.

An easy and delicious recipe.  My boyfriend really enjoyed it.  I used Dijon mustard, and instead of shredding the mozzarella, I cut thin slices to put over the chicken breasts.  I also pre-cooked the bacon a little bit since I like my bacon fairly crispy.  I followed other reviewers by baking for time suggested and then turning on the broiler to crisp up bacon and melt the cheese at the end.  Overall an excellent recipe that I'll be making again!  Thanks.

We all loved this!  My husband called it his new favorite chicken!  I only used about a tablespoon of honey and mustard and maybe half a cup of cheese, and it was still fantastic (and hopefully a little healthier!)  Thank you for sharing!!

4 out of 5 for this one...too salty for our family. I did use dijon mustard instead of yellow, and it was still a bit strong. The lemon pepper seasoning was great, but it needed more cheese for balance. I pre-cooked the bacon and crumbled it on top along with the cheese before broiling, so the bacon was crispy.

Thanks for a great and easy recipe!  Made this after a long day at work.  Delicious!  Looks like you slaved over it but oh so easy!  I used a grainy dark mustard that I mixed with the honey and heated lighly in the microwave.  Wrapped the chicken in the bacon strips, coved with honey mustard mixture and cooked 40 min as other people recommended.  A real hit with my family! Thanks for a great recipe.!!!!!!

This was a big hit! like others suggested i used half honey Dijon mustard and half yellow mustard! i also wrapped the chicken in the bacon so the bacon could cook all the way! we like our meat seasoned,so i seasoned it with black pepper, old bay, season salt as well as the lemon pepper! i also used monetary jack and Colby cheese as well as mozzarella....needless to say YUMMMMMMMY!

I made this the other night and my wife and I both loved it! We used rather large chicken breasts, and so we used a couple strips of bacon on each, wrapping them around the chicken breasts. We added the bacon at the beginning before any cooking. We combined the mustard and honey together first, then drizzled over the chicken. We didn't have any lemon pepper, so we went without that. Hopefully I'll have some for next time.  The leftovers even tasted great cold the next day. My wife actually preferred it that way.  We will definitely be making this again.

This was so easy and really good but so fatty.  All of the fat from the bacon ends up in your dish.  Next time I will fry the bacon a bit in a pan and then add it to the chicken.  The bacon actually took 30 minutes to crisp up and even then it wasn't that crisp.    I actually discussed leaving off the bacon because the sauce is so nice but my husband loved the bacon.    I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This chicken was really moist but I think we just didnt like the flavors together. The sweetness of the sauce and the mozzerella just didnt mix well with us. Wont make again. Was not gross but wasnt good.

I made this recipe, and my husband wanted it again for dinner the next night!  I'm not a huge fan of honey-mustard, but this chicken is sooo good.  All I did differently was wrap the chicken in bacon for the entire 25 mins.   I served over rice with extra sauce.  You have to try this!

I ran out of honey so I used honey mustard (1/2 cup) and mixed a bit of brown sugar with it. I also didn't use the lemon pepper. Like another review I  broiled bacon after 1/2 hour of cooking. When bacon was crisp I added colby/jack cheese and broiled longer. This was very flavorful and tender. My mother in law who never likes anything I cook liked it.

This came out great. The only thing I did different was to wrap the bacon around the chicken at the beginning rather than at the end of the baking time. It was delicious, thanks!

Absolutely delicious! I added some bread crumbs so the sauce had something to adhere to, but it probably would have been just fine without it. I omitted the cheese, I just couldn't see ruining the sauce with it. The chicken came out perfectly moist. LOVE IT!

My Son and Boyfriend liked it.  I liked it too, but I think I used too much mustard. And I took the advice of another review and put on cheese than bacon then more cheese, but it still just slid off the chicken.  I will make it again, it is very easy and quick

I used a "German mustard with white wine" and followed everything as the recipe said.  It was EXTREMELY flavorful.  I served it over a bed of orzo and it was perfect.  Great meal!

This was good, but I'd crisp the bacon on the chicken first before putting the sauce on. The bacon was soggy the way the recipe describes to follow.

This is a great recipe but I left out the bacon...next time I will use bacon. I agree with another writer.... maybe use another kind of cheese (like swiss) as the mozz. is somewhat bland...that is why I just gave this 4 stars...I will be using the recipe again and again. Thanks for sharing.

This was marginal... I was looking for a sweet/smokey tasting chicken, like the appetizers that are rolled in chicken. This was similar but the lemon pepper kinda switched it up, too much for me... Just not what I was looking for.

This recipe had awesome flavor!  The only problem that I had with it is my bacon didn't get crispy so I had to bake for an extra 10 minutes.  I used yellow mustard, and it was very good, but I would like to experiment with using other varieties.

VERY good.  I was afraid after reading some of the reviews. I thought it turned out really well. I did mix the honey and mustard first and I did put the bacon on top and bake for 5 min before putting the mozzarella on top from some of the suggestions. My husband and his buddy were my guinea pigs and they gave it a thumbs up. both of them are great cooks and have very good taste.

Absolutely WONDERFUL!!! I am making this for the second time and my fiance is beyond thrilled about it! To cut the fat I took out the bacon (we don't like bacon that much anyway) and on my chicken I mixed regular mozzarella with fat free mozzarella and it was amazing!

Very Yummy! All the boys in the house raved about it.  I used Sweet Hot Mustard to give it some kick and wrapped it in bacon from the begining.  Used the broiler to crisp it up a bit.

This recipe is fantastic. I thought the ingredients were kind of strange together, but what a combination!  I did make some changes.  I used Grey Poupon mustard and cut up the bacon and cooked until it was slightly crisp and only used a little sprinkle of lemon pepper.
This one is a keeper.

I like the honey mustard in this recipe but the bacon took to long to cook and so the cheese got really hard.  The chicken was excellent and next time the only thing different I would do is put the bacon on at the beginning and then add the cheese later.

I was quite impressed with this recipe.  I did have to tweak it a bit, but it turned out really well. I made these changes: I didn't use whole breasts- I butterflied each one and cut it into strip-sized pieces; I then used plenty of lemon pepper, salt, garlic powder, and onion powder; instead of regular bacon I used turkey bacon and wrapped it around the chicken;  for the sauce I added mayo and substituted Grey Poupon for yellow mustard- I just estimated the proportions of each, but I think the mayo is an important ingredient to include...also, make sure you use just enought to cover the chicken, I used too much and the honey mustard was caked to my pan and I had to let it soak 24 hours to get it off; finally, I followed AndiK's advice and cooked at 375 for 30 min, then kicked it up to broil, one side about 5 min, flipped it, added the cheese and broiled for 2-3 minutes.  This recipe is really good for those who don't even really like honey mustard.  It produces an incredible moist and tasty chicken.

This wasn't that great for me.  I don't do bacon, so I omitted that.  I guess that must be the big flavor maker, because for me this was very bland, and the chicken was a little on the dry side.

I loved this recipe!  I had some honey dijon mustard on hand so I substituted with that and it was AWESOME.  Also, I used turkey bacon instead for a more figure friendly recipe.  The whole family enjoyed this.  The chicken was extremely moist and flavorful.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I had high hopes for this recipe, but my family didn't like it at all.  I thought it would be similar to Aimee's Chicken... one of my hubby's favorites.(found here on allrecipes)  So, I was hoping for another favorite to go into the rotation, but no such luck.

At first i was thinking i don't need to make a review of this recipe coz a lot of people already did.But i just cant get over it.I just have to let all the cook out there that this one is so good, just like i did with the other recipes i read reviews first and put it together.Its just if you love cooking try this one out,u wont be dissapointed. wrapping that chicken breast with a bacon made this recipe tasty and perfect

Very good chicken recipe.  I will be making this often!  Even my 3 year old who doesn't care for chicken, ate it.  I didn't give it 5 stars since it is nothing spectacular and it's pretty simplistic.  I turned the chicken over quite a few  times and basted it while it was cooking.  I also used shredded mozzarella since that was all I had on hand.

Great recipe. Used Colby & Monteray Jack cheese (didn't have mozzerella) and had no bacon, but this is a keeper. Thanks.

SIMPLE, simple, simple! Family loved it! Mine was even quicker than the original. I laid the chicken (cut up) in the pan, poured desired amount of mustard over the chicken, then poured desired amount of honey, sprinkled with 'real bacon' from the salad isle topped with sliced (not shredded) mozzerella. Smelled great while cooking! A+

Really I'd give this about 4.5 stars, but not an option. Very good meal though I'd omit the lemon pepper as the additional flavor is just not needed and takes away from the honey mustard. Next time I'll probably use some garlic powder or just some fresh ground pepper when I make it. However, it is a keeper.

My family loves this dish! Like others had suggested, I wrap the chicken in bacon in the beginning. I have made the honey mustard sauce and also use store bought varieties. The chicken comes out very moist and tender. Great recipe!

This was a good, easy chicken dish.  My husband, who doesn't like mustard, even said it was really good. The only change i made was to use prepared honey mustard sauce for convenience.

For us, this was just ok. The bacon did not crisp, I ended up taking it off and cooking it separate and crumbling on top. The sauce was very thin although that didn't bother me too much.  I don't know the whole combo of flavors; honey, mustard, bacon, cheese; just didn't really thrill me. Thanks for sharing though, it was worth a shot.

This is a great recipe, however next time I will make a few changes. This would have tasted much better prepared with Dijon instead of yellow mustard. Also, I will omit the lemon pepper seasoning and just add some poultry seasoning, salt and pepper. Other that, this was excellent, and I know it will taste even better with a couple changes. I served with steamed white rice with a little butter and salt..went very well together. Thanks for the recipe!

This was wonderful! Great taste combination. I used spicy brown mustard instead of plain, and after I topped the chicken with the bacon I turned the broiler on for about 5 minutes, then I topped with cheese and baked for another 10 mins.- turned out perfect!

This was very easy and very tasty!  We had some really good thick bacon on hand so there was a lot of smokey bacon flavor.  Next time i'll put the bacon on earlier as it was too thick so took longer to cook.  I used a Garlic Aeoli Mustard from Trader Joes that made it super yummy.  I'll definately make this again.

This will be an instant staple at our house. Used pre-mixed honey mustard and was even easier. Added some garlic and extra ground black pepper. I would even serve this for company potentially (though would not have as much "wow" factor as more extravagant recipes). This is something that everyone would like - even picky eaters. I also made a batch without the bacon and was still very good.

I really liked this recipe! It was very easy to make! I will, however, add some seasoning to the chicken the next time I make it, like basil, oregano, or rosemary. And maybe use spicy mustard instead of plain. Other than that it was great!

I used 8 chicken tenders, placed them in the dish, and sprinkled with garlic salt. I left them sitting to soak up that flavor while I mixed the honey and mustard.When I added the sauce they seemed to be swimming in it. I think you could back on that and still have plenty. I used the pre cooked bacon and just before time to add it, zapped it in the microwave. I cut the cooking time back to 20 minutes before adding the bacon and cheese, and put it back in only until the cheese was melted.(about 5 minutes) The chicken was very tender and moist and everyone loved it! We also love the Aussie chicken recipe from this site which is similar but a bit more complicated. This is a handy, quick substitute for when you don't have much time.

Not bad! The cheese and bacon flavors mixed well. Mine was a touch too mustard tasting for me. Next time I might increase the honey and decrease the mustard a little. I wouldn't say it was superb but I have a very strict rating scale. Will make again and again.

This is a great family recipe.  My 10 year old and my husband both loved it!  Told me to make it anytime.  My husband actually took the leftovers on a roll with mayo for lunch the next day!

This recipe was total yum.  I prepared it exactly as the recipe stated.  However, if you wait to put the bacon on after the 20 minutes of baking the chicken breasts, it will take at least another 20 minutes for the bacon to crisp up.  Then you can add the mozzarella!  Thank you for the great recipe.  Will make again.

Very good and so easy! My bacon didn't crisp up very much so next time I'd cook it  some first before baking it.

ok, but everyone in my family was pulling off the bacon and cheese and eating it.  The chicken was just ok.
