I should have expected it from the title, but it was an unpleasant green color. It tasted GREAT, but the color was a bit offputting. Next time, I will just do what I usually do when I make baked eggs with spinach and keep the leaves whole to avoid the color issue. Also, I think a bit of garlic powder, touch of salt and pepper would improve this recipe. Overall, though, a keeper.

This was absolutely fabulous.  I did make a few changes though.  Instead of blending everything, I just chopped the spinach and whisked it all together; I like the texture of seperate ingredients rather than all the same.  I also substituted chicken breast for the ham.  Lower calories, and my kids prefer chicken to ham anyway.  I also used a round pie plate rather than a 9x13 pan; it takes significantly longer to bake this way, so modify your cooking times appropriately.  Another great recipe!!

I wasn't sure about this at first, but the taste only gets better as it sits! I had only a tiny bit of spinach, so I added some cooked chopped broccoli.  I also added some garlic to the onions, which I cooked in a little butter, before mixing with the broccoli/spinach.  I mixed the baking mix, milk and eggs separately and then stirred everything together, so as to get a more chunky texture.  Added the ham and cheese on top of the 9 x 9 glass dish.  I cooked it 35 mins @ 325 and an additional 15 mins @ 350 because it was totally jiggly!

Green eggs and ham came out all runny. I do not like them Moneypenny. I would not eat them with some changes. I would not eat them cooked on ranges. I would not eat them with thyme or garlic. Never mind that yucky Bisquick. The thought of this fills me with dread. Try the Spinach Quiche instead.

This recipe is a keeper.  Very easy to make--  I just put everything through my food processer and poured into the pan.   My young children (The most honest of critics) asked for 2nds and 3rds.   I think it needs a bit of spicing up for the adults,  but overall a great, easy family dish.

I made this today for breakfast.  It was really awesome.  I could tell by the amount of ingredients that this recipe would NOT fit in a standard pie dish so I put mine in a 9"'x9" glass pan.  I also added 2 extra eggs because after all...it was breakfast :)  I made the baking mix ingredients and poured it in the pan then layered the rest of ingredients.  I cooked the onion with a little green pepper and put that in as a layer as well.  325 for 45 min. - BF and I loved it!

This was really yummy. I do think the next time I will cook it a bit longer as I like mine a little more set.

Good recipe; I added a little salt, some garlic and pepper to give this a little spice.  What didn't work for me is the timing.  I bumped the oven up to 350 and ended up baking this for at least 45-55 minutes before it set.  Good flavor and overall, pretty easy!

Yum!    Thanks for the recipe! It's great as is AND... it's also good with the Oil Pie Crust from this site.  Leave out the baking mix and cut way back on the milk if you choose to do it that way. Very forgiving recipe.  You can play around with it a lot!

Delicious! I poured the ingredients into a pie crust to bake and that made this good recipe great. I loved the spinach although I didn't use all two cups in my quiche.

My family loved this recipe!! This was made by my 11-year old son, who I am teaching to cook.  He really made it all on his own, with my supervision.  I'm not a ham fan, but it was awesome.  We did add a little pepper to make the recipe "his own", and he mentioned it is a little 'green' so we may just chop the spinach next time instead of blending.

I love this recipe and it reheats perfectly. We have had this for breakfast and dinner before...I just add some fruit and you have a complete meal my family of 4 loves. It is very easy to change the cheeses and I have even made this with broccoli before using the food processor to chop it finely. Go forth and experiment with this one...you won't be disappointed.

This is very like the one I used to make, after having some at a gathering. They used broccoli instead of spinich and added tomate slices, bacon bits ( Fresh) and the ham, sauted mushrooms, green and red pepper, chedar and mozza....all to your own taste! Requires less cooking time...so full of stuff every bite is origional Yummy This is a great base for many recipies

Although beautiful to look at the taste was so so. There was too much bisquick and made it taste too bread-like. Next time will use less bisquick and more eggs.

This is a nice, basic recipe.  I pureed the spinach with the onion first rather than chopped.  It definitely gave it a green color, but I knew what to expect from other's reviews and it allows me to add a bit more spinach.  I did sprinkle the mixture with garlic powder before cooking based on the advice of another reviewer.  I also cooked it in a suffle pan and it took a bit longer but was nice and thick.  Overall it's a nice recipe and definitely a keeper.

I use a handheld mixer and mix the bisquick, eggs & milk. I used a deep dish pie pan layered the spinach, ham, onions and cheese and poured the mixture on top of everything. Top with more cheese if needed. Baked at 350 for a hour or when done.

I am sorry to say this but I tried this recipe out, I had extra ham so I wanted to use it up. This was so bad that I actually had to throw away the whole pan. I ate my bowl because I don't like to waste but I couldn't hardly stand to eat it. My boyfriend couldn't eat his at all. He couldn't even pack it for lunch. Sorry, but this one has got to go.

My husband doesn't like spinach, so I used broccoli instead. I used most of a package of cooked, pre-diced ham. This was the best quiche I have ever made!!! Definitely going to make it again!

Used a real crust omitted bisquick.  Used 1/2 cup less milk and 3/4 cup sour cream.  Added in 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and sautéed mushrooms and onions.

There actually are green eggs.  They have a green shell.  I thought they may have been used in this recipe.  Dr. Seuss would probably have loved these eggs.

This was awesome. Great starter recipe for your imagination. I used a piecrust and the Bisquick. I added a layer on the bottom of fresh spinach and I added green onion.  It was superior.  The bake time is way longer than the recipe states.  I baked it 75 minutes at 325.

I have made this type of quiche before--the type with biscuit mix in it. However, I needed a larger recipe which would fill a 9 X 13 baking dish. After reading the reviews of other cooks, I made a few changes, and I was very happy with the resulting quiche. The most important change I made was to increase the egg quantity. I use an egg substitute (which is 99% egg whites) to avoid the cholesterol in eggs. I used two cups in this recipe--the equivalent of about 10 large eggs. This helped the quiche set up so it wasn't runny as some cooks had commented. It also increased the volume, which changed the ratio of eggs to biscuit mix--to avoid the bread-like consistency some noted--and fluffed up the result so it wasn't a flat quiche, as other reviewers observed. Additionally, I used an entire bunch of spinach, which I washed, dried and chopped, rather than puréed. I sautéed my chopped onion with a couple of cloves of minced garlic. I stirred a little salt and pepper into my egg, milk and biscuit mix. I put the spinach in the bottom of the baking dish first, layered the sautéed onion, ham and shredded cheese on top, and poured the liquid over it all. Baking time was about 50 minutes at 325 degrees.

Very tasty. I hand chopped everything. I put every thing but the cheese in a bowl and mixed it. Then I put it all in a 9 x 13, and topped it with grated Gruyere. Baked at 325 for 45. Not as fast and easy as the processor, but came out with great consistency and flavor.
