Needed something quick and easy to make. Substituted the vegatables recommended with anything I could find in the house (beans, peas, carrots)! Still was really tasty and felt healthy which is always good. 
Will make again.

My wife Loves vegetables so this recipe was a good one.  I added lots more garlic and pan fried the chicken strips before including them in the dish.  Great recipe to add other things too. I had mushrooms in the frig and sauteed them along with the onions and garlic.  This is a keeper and easy to make.

Tastes good!  Easy adaptions if you don't have some items, but very satisfying and fun to make.
