I'm glad I read other reviews before making this recipe.  There is a lot of liquid so be prepared to add a whole lot more fruit.  I added green grapes in addition to the oranges and pineapple and used a little cocoanut and just the zest of one lime plus the lime juice.  The lime made the taste distinctive.  I would definitely make this recipe again.

I had to use 2  cans of pineapple and 2 cans of oranges for the amount of liquid.  My family loved the flavor.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this delicious dessert on Easter Sunday, and it received rave reviews!!!  Everyone loved it!!  The perfect blending of the sweetened condensed milk and yogurt made it not too sweet.  I omitted the lime, because I thought it might make it a bit too tart for my taste. I didn't add the nuts either because I'm not a lover of nuts. I did add one sliced banana one hour prior to serving. 
This dish certainly has my approval!!!

The ambrosia that i make does not call for the condensed milk as that would make it too sweet, i think ambrosia should always be a nice light dessert, i always put in almost a whole bag of marshmellows that way its not too soupy and i let it set a few hours before i serve it, it always turns out perfect every time.

This is an excellent recipe! I received many compliments on it.  It's the lime juice that makes it different.  Try it!!!

Lovely flavor, but be prepared to add more ingredients! I used low-fat condensed milk, non-fat yogurt, and followed the recipe in terms of the lime juice and zest. When I added the fruit, marshmallows, and coconut, however, there just seemed like too much liquid still (even taking into account the fact that the marshmallows would eventually soak some of that up while the salad chilled overnight). So I added another can of pineapple, which luckily just happened to be in my kitchen. Had I had another can of mandarin oranges, I'd have added that as well. I wound up putting 1 1/2 cups of marshmallows in, and about the same amount of flaked, sweetened coconut. I also had some unsweetened coconut from Whole Foods, which is much drier than the sweetened stuff you find in the "baking" aisle at the regular grocery store; so I dumped a little of that in, to soak up some extra liquid while not adding any extra sweetness. I'm glad I did. After chilling and setting, the salad is quite nice! Of course, with all the extra ingredients, it serves way more people now, but it tastes so yummy, you don't have to worry about having leftovers lying around. Great idea for summer potlucks or picnics.

I made quite a few little changes to this recipe. I omitted the sweetened condensed milk, replacing it with 2 tablespoons of honey. I reduced the lime juice to 1 tablespoon and added lime zest. That made plenty of dressing for 2 cans of pineapple, one large can of mandarin oranges, and the remaining ingredients. Very good and not too sweet.

For personal preference I left out the coconut and pecans.  I wanted a very colorful salad to take to a potluck, so I made this one and added fresh kiwi, grapes and strawberries.  Some thought the dressing was a little too strong on the lime, but I loved it.  Thanks, just what I needed.

I did not care for this. The texture of the sauce was very syrupy and heavy, kind of a coat-your-mouth thing. I would take cool whip or whipped cream with fruit over this any day. Sorry. :(

This was a very tasty side dish. My family loved it because they said it was light. The lime really makes all the flavors stand out. Like eating a key lime fruit salad. For potlucks, this is what I bring.

I wanted to comment on the amount of liquid. I made the "sauce" the day before using the juice from 1/2 a fresh lime. It did thicken up some. I mixed the fruit, etc, in a seperate bowl on the morning of the party, and only used about 3/4 of the sauce. Other reviewers were right...all of it would have been too much. Next time, I will wait longer to add the oranges, because they fell apart. All & all, this was delicious, and I will definitely make it again! HEADS UP...this served only SEVEN people at MY house!!!

I loved it. My husband didn't care for the cherries. I will leave those out next time. The marshmallows stay firm which keeps the leftover salad from getting soupy. Nice!

I did not care for this recipe at all. It was way too sweet and there was too much liquid and it really did not look appetizing at all.  Even after draining the excess liquid, it didn't taste good.  Ended up throwing it out.

This recipe was too sweet for me. My mother-in-law has made a similar recipe for years. Only in hers there is no condensed milk, no lime juice or cherries.  She combines the grapes, mandarin oranges, pineapple with the coconut and marshmallows, and mixes all with 1 - 1 1/2 cups of low-fat sour cream. She then  refrigerates it for 3+ hrs or over night. I thought I would give this recipe a try, but it was a lot sweeter and had far too much liquid.  We will be going back to the old favorite.

this was  pretty sweet and the condensed milk gave it more of a thin-pudding-like texture. I was looking for something a bit more fluffy in texture.  Aside from the overwhelming sweetness and texture it did taste pretty good.

Absolutely scrumptious! As other reviewers noted, the recipe makes a lot of juice. I reduced lime juice to 1/4c; used 2c coconut, 2c marshmallows, 2 cans oranges. Added a whole pint of strawberries and 1/3c pecans.
