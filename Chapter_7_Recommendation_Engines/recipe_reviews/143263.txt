This was surprisingly good for a healthy recipe!!!!  I did not use the Catalina Dressing because taco salad is supposed to have fresh salsa as the dressing in my opinion.  I also like fresh guacamole on top.  It was a hit at my house.  I also substituted Best Black Beans from this site in place of the Kidney Beans. This also enhanced the flavor of the dish.  This was an absolute party in your mouth!!!!!  I do not think it would have been as good as listed.  So should I give less stars?  Heck No!!!!  You inspired me and that is what this site is all about.  Way to go!!!!

I omitted the lentils by accident, because I completely forgot about them!. I also added a can of corn, substituted black beans for kidney, and substituted shredded cabbage for iceberg lettuce. Made the catalina dressing from scratch, omitting the sugar that was called for. MAN, it was AWESOME! Filling, satisfying, and packed with tons of good protein and fiber. The lentils would have made it even more so. Yum!

I have never made anything with lentils, but for some reason had a brand new bag of them in my pantry, think I was going to make soup with it. I have to say they really smelled good while cooking and mixing it in with the ground turkey made you think you were eating ground beef. Really tasted wonderful, earthy is what comes to mind. I used my own taco seasoning mix, and canned black eyed peas (all I had). This was a great summer meal, so easy to make also...not to mention good for you. For the dressing I used Dorothy LynchÂ® Style Salad Dressing from this site that I had leftover, just added in a bit of the taco season. My beef loving husband even said it was good.

This is a nice recipe.  I had my doubts if hubby would like the meat and lentil mix - but he thought it was fine.  I used pinto beans instead of kidney beans and nixed the Catalina dressing.  In this house we use Salsa mixed with a little ranch dressing or sour cream.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe Dana and so healthy too with the exception of the sodium content. To bring that number down, I made my own taco seasoning which did not compromise the taste in the least. To add even more nutritional value, I served this with baby spinach. Thanks for a wonderful lunch today Dana!

Very tasty! I was actually pleasantly surprised at how good it was. The lentils really add a nice texture to the ground turkey - along with a more interesting flavor. The only thing I added was some shredded cheese (Mexican blend) - which I thought was needed. Great recipe!

I have been making a very similar recipe for taco salad for 30 years.  The only thing I do differently is no lentils and add cheddar cheese.  It is a summer favorite in our home.

I didn't make any changes, but I think next time I would put it in a taco shell bowl.

Excellent base for a healthy version of taco salad! I used the Mrs. Dash taco seasoning (cutting back on salt) and it was delicious! I loved the turkey/lentil combination.
I also subbed a chopped red pepper for (too salty for us) olives, left out the kidney beans, and added a chopped red onion. Topped it with salt free tortilla chips and a dollop of sour cream, and it was excellent. 
I'll be making this again.
