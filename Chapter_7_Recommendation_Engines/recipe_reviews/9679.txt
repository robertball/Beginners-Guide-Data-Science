I initially couldn't decide whether I wanted to make brownies or cookies, and these cookies are the perfect compromise! Instead of chocolate squares, I threw in a cup or so of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and it worked out just fine. The cookies are very, very chocolatey but NOT very sugary sweet. Excellent!

I also found this cookie to be very cake like. I put mint chocolate chips in them. I was trying to make something like chocolate chip cookies but with a chocolate cookie and mint chips and this just did not do it for me. I should have listened to the other reviews on this one.

Excellent recipe, lovely chocolatey flavour-not too sweet nor too firm, lovely soft centred cookies. Easy to follow recipe, I just had to add a little extra flour to mine, say 2 or 3 tablespoons to get it to a stiff dough, shaping the balls was easy and my 3 1/2 year old daughter loved helping. A great recipe to try with kids!

Very nice, I read the other reviews and added resse's pieces and chocolate chips. They are definitely more cake like then chewy.

These weren't bad, but they were somewhat plain. The texture was similar to that of a brownie, and their flavor a dark, barely sweetened chocolate. I think they could be vastly improved with peanut butter chips instead of the chocolate, although the chocolate on chocolate combination really is nice if you're craving some dark chocolate flavor. Not a bad starting point for chocolate peanut butter chip cookies.

These are super easy and delicious! I was expecting a little more chocolate flavor, though.  Still super delicious!

I mixed in food processor until dough ball formed,very easy and cookies came out perfectly. I also scooped with a 1 inch ice cream scoop that was dampened every 2 cookies. I used semi sweet chocolate chips in place of chopped chocolate and added a teaspoon of vanilla.. Like another reviewer suggested I put an additional few Tbs, of flour making them less cake like with a nice chew These are not too sweet and very satisfying when the chocolate craving strikes.

The taste of these cookies is ok, but they came out dry and cakey.  I only baked them for 10 minutes, since 13-15 seemed a bit much, but I think they would have been better with an even shorter baking time.  Either way, if you're looking for cookies, not cake, then stay away from this recipe.

I wanted a rich chocolate cookie and this seemed to fit the bill.  I used half "european drinking chocolate" from Trader Joe's, half cocoa powder, added 1 tsp vanilla, and used half Reece's Pieces half chocolate chips. The taste was very good, but the texture was cakey with a high loft.  I had to add 2 tbsp extra flour because I didn't have time to chill the dough.  Maybe without the flour they would be more chewy.  They were a good cookie, but not the chewy rich deep chocolate cookie I was looking for so I will continue in my search.

I wasn't impressed.  I thought they were dry with little flavor unless you bit into the chocolate pieces.

These really hit the spot.  They are cakey, like brownies, and very chocolatey but not too sweet.  I had a little trouble rolling the dough into balls as it was really sticky.  And I kept the oven temperature a little higher so that the cookies would be firm on the outside but soft on the inside.  When I asked my husband if he could think of any improvements, he said, "Yes - make more of them!"
