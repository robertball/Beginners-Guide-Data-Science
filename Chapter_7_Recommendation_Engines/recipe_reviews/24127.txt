This recipe is wonderful.  I made this for a recent family reunion. Instead of sprinkling the cinnamon and sugar on the top of the apples in the pan. I just put the apples and the cinn/sugar mixture together in a ziploc bag and coated all the apple pieces. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

Since there were a few ppl saying this was a dry recipe, when I made it I used a little less flour and a little less oatmeal. YOU DEFINATELY DO NOT need 1/2 cup sugar! I didn't even use 1/2 cup and it was a little too sweet, but when I had the topping  on I dotted it with a T of butter and baked as directed. This was juicy, bubbly, and SO DELICIOUS! I will DEFINITELY be using this as my Apple Oatmeal Crisp recipe from now on!

This is hands down my favorite apple crisp recipe! I like that there is one bowl and no cutting in required with the butter. My son is 4 and he loves to help in the kitchen, this is exactly the type of easy, delicious recipe he can help with. You cannot go wrong with this one. I even use the crumb mixture as a streusel-type topping for apple muffins. Thanks so much for sharing!

Awesome recipe, love it, I usually double the recipe, and make 2 at a time (one for eating and one for freezing.) I freeze them before cooking and when I want one later, I cook it from frozen at about 375F for about 45mins-1hr. tastes great!

I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using wholewheat flour, and it came out so great! It was really easy and delicious! Others have said in their reviews of this recipe that it was too much sugar, but the apples I used were really tart so it worked well. I think if I were using sweeter apples I'd consider cutting down the amount of white sugar, but for today this was just perfect!

Very tasty. I omitted the white sugar over the apples part, because the apples I was using were sweet enough as is it was. I probably increased the butter, didn't actually measure, jut added untill the oat mixture was a good consistency. I added some real vanilla and a few tsps of almond extract to the butter before I added it to the oats. (I really like almond flavour and apples together) I also added the cinnamon right to the oatmeal mixture, rather then sprinkle it on the apples. Oh, and I added some nutmeg as well. Served it warm, a la mode, and it was greeat! Thanx for this recipe! :)

If this is not heaven in a bowl, please don't shake me and wake me up and tell me I'm dreaming.  I add a tad of cinnamon to the crips mixture and a bit of lemon juice to the apples.  I sigh in deep satisfaction.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out very dry, so dry in fact we were unable to eat it. The oatmeal mix remained powdery. I would not attempt this one again!

This was a great recipe, and I would suggest it to anybody who hasn't cooked an apple crisp before. However, if you're feeling a bit adventurous, I would suggest using half the amount of flour suggested (the amount of flour put into this recipe makes it rather cake-like instead of crisp-like. Make up for the loss of volume by adding about 1/2 cup more oats), throw in about a teaspoon of salt (it enhances the sweet flavor, believe me), and mix the cinnamon and sugar into the apple slices rather than sprinkle (you get more of that delicious flavor into more of the slice), along with upping the cinnamon (for the cinnamon lovers like myself) by about three teaspoons to the cinnamon and sugar mixture , the outcome is golden!

I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9"x13" pan. Served with home-made vanilla ice cream, this one was a winner!
I noticed some of the reviews that said this was dry- it all depends on the type of apple you use! I use a combo of Gala, Granny Smith and Fuji, with great results. My girlfriend used red delicious and ended up with a dry and disappointing Crisp.

I tweaked this recipe a bit to make it healthier. My family enjoyed it a lot. I used whole wheat flour in place of white flour; instead of 1/2 cup butter (which is 8 tblsps.), I used 6 tblsps. butter and 1/4 cup applesauce added to the flour and brown sugar and oats. I also cut back to about 1/4 cup the white sugar. I baked for the first 30 minutes with a lightly covered piece of foil on top, and then removed the foil and continued baking until done. Thank you for basic recipe - very easy to make. I'm sure it's delicious as is, we are just trying to mkae every dish slightly healthier by making some simple changes to them. I reduced the overall fat, calorie and sugar content buy just a bit - but every little bit adds up!

I read this wrong the first time I made it and didn't realize that half the crumbles go under the apples and half on top - I'd put it all under and none on top! This time I did it right, and I now agree that this recipe is absolutely WONDERFUL! I do want to cut down the sugar next time I make it, just for the health aspect rather than the taste - it wasn't overly sweet, but I'm just hoping that if I use sweet apples, it can use less sugar. One note - I use thick rolled oats rather than the thin kind, which makes for a much more substantial and crispy crisp than if you use Quaker Oats or a similar thinly rolled oat.  I saw some of the negative reviews, and I honestly think there must have been something done in the process of making it that went wrong - like mismeasuring or  maybe using instant or fast cooking oats or something - in fact, someone said the crisp mix was powdery, which simply isn't possible if you've used good quality real rolled oats.  I've made a lot of crisps, and this was truly one of the best ever.

5 stars with the following adjustment: reduce the flour by about 1 or 2 tablespoons! It turns out just slightly too dry with all of the flour, and I ended up having to add more butter. If you don't have the right consistency, it'll end up being crumbly. BUT if you have the right butter/flour ratio, oh man, it's SO good! The topping gets crispy and delicious. Oh, and don't bother with the 1/2 cup white sugar, absolutely NOT needed!

Excellent recipe if you know what you are doing.  It doesn't explain that you must mix the flour, oats, sugar and melted butter with your fingers to ensure dry ingredients are completely moistened or it will be dry and powdery.  Also Gala apples don't cook well - you can't go wrong with Cortland or Granny Smith.

This was so delicious.  I just had my first piece.  My husband is a diabetic and I am hypoglycemic.  Because of those drawbacks I made this with Splenda brown sugar for the oatmeal blend and Splenda white sugar in the topping. It turned out wonderful.

This was just what I have been looking for.  I made it almost as written except I did not have rolled oats and used quick instead.  I did not peel the apples as the skins have most of the food value.  Awesome!  It will become a tradition in our household.

This is wonderful! I used the suggestion that you coat the apples in the sugar and cinnamon in a bowel first, then layer, this way the apples are all nicely covered, you can also use less sugar this way as you only use enough to coat them. This is much better for you then some other apple crisp's but it doesn't taste like you are trying to be more healthy! I made this for a dinner and everyone loved it! Definitely will make this again!

OMG this is the most delicious apple crisp Ive ever had! I couldnt help myself but have a few pieces before dinner! I did double the recipe to make a 13X9 dish and i mixed the apples, white sugar and cinnamon in a bowl and then put it in, it better that way. Will be making this over and over again!

Yes, I will make this crisp again, it is excellent! I used Splenda brown sugar blend (you only use half as much when using this product) and the taste was wonderful. I cut out the white sugar entirely and tossed the apples (MacIntosh) w/ about 2T. of the brown sugar blend along w/ the cinnamon. Served this with sugar-free vanilla ice cream and it made a wonderful fall treat for the diabetic in our family. Thanks for a great recipe Dave!

For fruit lovers:  After looking at several recipes and reading the comments, I did the following: - Increased the apples to 4 cups and mixed them with the juice of a whole lemon - Mixed in 1 1/2 cups blackberries and put all the fruit and juice in a 4" deep ceramic casserole pot 9" in diameter - Decreased the brown sugar to 3/4 c - Decreased the oats to 3/4 c - Decreased the flour to 1/2 c - Added 1/4 c finely chopped nuts - Did not use any white sugar  I mixed the dry ingredients (oats, brown sugar, flour, chopped nuts and 1T cinnamon) together first ,then added the melted butter. I put all of the crumb topping on the apple/berries - just covered them. It was moist and tasty. The crisp wasn't too sweet for me, but sweet enough for my teenaged daughter and all her friends who loved it.

i made it exactly as directed except i used 4 1/2 cups of apples instead of 3 cups, and this has to be the best apple crisp ive ever had! used 1 granny smith apple and 2 fuji apples and the flavor is perfect.. love the idea of the crisp over the pie as it seems the traditional fattening crust has been replaced with old fashioned oats in this recipe..seems like a way better and tastier, healthier alternative =) i would recommend this recipe to anyone!

This recipe is one of the better ones I've tried. A little on the sweet side and a bit too much crust. So I tweaked it! Doubled the apples, mixed directly in 11x7 greased pan, sprinkled with 1 T lemon juice, mixed 1/2 c organic sugar + 1 T flour + 1t cinnamon and mixed with apples. The topping was too sweet so I did 1 1/2 c flour, 1 1/2 c oatmeal and 1 c br sugar. Also I think next time I will only use 1/2 c butter instead of 3/4 c. Mixed and poured over apples, patted it down slightly and baked at 350 for 50-60 min. The amount of sugar added to apples will vary with the kind used depending on how sweet they are, also the cooking time should be adjusted for the density of the apples, the crisper the longer to cook.

I made this for a family get together. It went very quickly (even against other deserts) and there was none left by the end of the night. I used Granny Smith apples, also based on other reviews I used a little less flour and added a splash of apple juice to the 1/2 that I put on top. The only problem I had was the bottom mixture caramelized and stuck to the pan. Even though I did grease it. I think next time I may put the apples on bottom and the topping only on top.

This is a great recipe!  I didn't use all of the 1/2 cup sugar, and I also added pecan pieces to the fruit mixture.  It's also excellent with peaches instead of apples!

This recipe was awesome, for those who found it dry did not realize what the crumble mixture should look like, here is a few tips, test out a small portion once you have the crumble all together press it between your palms and make a small pancake, make sure you press hard, if you find that it feels to dry add a bit more butter, You will know its right if you feel the moisture in you palms and the crumble stays together and is hard to break apart.  I hope this helps!!!

Others commented on the dryness.  We like apple crisp, but we hate when the crisp sinks into the apples, and there's nothing crispy. This is not that kind of recipe, as there is crumb topping on the bottom and top.  So, we liked the crumble topping.  There is nothing mixed in with the apples, so the apple portion is dry.  One rater mentioned mixing it all together, and I will try that next time.  We used Jonathan apples which stayed firm during cooking.  Picking another apple should have different results.

Best. Apple Crisp. Ever.

I used 3 large golden delicious apples which I cut into chucks. I mixed the sugar & cinnamon with the apple pieces in a separate bowl - so technically it is no longer a single bowl recipe, but worth it to get a good coating over the apples which turned into a wonderful syrup in the oven. 

My whole family raved over it. It is now my go-to apple crisp recipe.

This was a great tasting dish. The only change I would make next time (and there will be a next time with this recipe), is that I would cover it loosely with foil. The apples on top tended to dry out a bit.

Easy to do when you have extra apples.  I think I'll add more apples next time, there was lots of crisp, not enough apples.  Delicious though...

Great recipe! Simple and delicious!   A few notes: it usually takes me longer than the suggested 20 minutes to peel and chop all the apples, I would allow for at least 40 minutes depending on how many servings you're making.  Also, this recipe is just fine with half the recommended sugar.

I didn't put any crisp on the bottom, as I had a lot of apples. I also used a lot less white sugar, and I used about half the flour. For those who think it might be too dry, make sure you're baking it long enough for the juice to bubble up and melt the brown sugar. I added a few pats of butter to the top of mine and patted it down and it finally melted nicely.

Just what we needed on a chilly end of summer day.  My kids and i had fun making this recipe, with the apples my eight yo girl brought home after apple picking with her school.  It turned out ab fab.  I always use lemon juice when i am preparing apples for any recipe, keeps them nice and bright white.  I did add orange juice to the assembled ingredients before sliding it into the hot oven, to make it more pudding like. I also added lots of cinnamon.  I used less sugar by using a brown splenda/sugar blend.  Kids had no idea.  I feel this is a healthy high fibre, no guilt recipe.  My recipe required less time in the oven.  We will definitely make this again soon.

IT was a good start for something better. I didn't put the crumb topping on the bottom, because it absorbs the juices from the apple, omit the white sugar, and add nutmeg and to the topping and also use Granny Smiths they are the best baking apples!

Excellent. I use honeygold and haralson apples from our trees. I will make a double batch next time. I've been looking for a really good crisp that's crispy and not soggy, this was perfect.  I mix the apples and sugar together and let them sit while I prep the rest of the ingredients. This may help for those who say it’s dry. The only crisp I make now.

This is a delicious and easy recipe. I have made it dozens of times, and it always turns out well. I always at LEAST double the apples and oatmeal, and do not add sugar to the apples. This makes it a little crumblier (which I prefer), and still plenty sweet. I've tried various apples and they all work (very hard to even detect a difference).

OMG, never made an apple crisp with a bottom layer, never even thought about it before, this is DELICIOUS!  The bottom layer is gooey and top is crispy, I added some walnuts to the bottom/topping mixture, yummy!  It was supposed to be dessert for after dinner tonight, but I am slowly picking away at it! Excellent, my new "go to" apple dessert.  My husband does not care for pie crust, so this is perfect.

I took took advice from previous reviews and added the sugar and cinnamon to the chopped apples in a bowl and mixed them all together rather than sprinkling on top. I also added a dash of nutmeg.   Delicious and easy recipe! Smells wonderful as it bakes! :D Perfect for cool fall and winter weather. My Fiance and I love this recipe.

This was a very easy apple crisp recipe, which in itself wins lots of stars in my book!  I made the recipe exactly as it reads so I could give a true rating (reviewers who change everything about a recipe and then give it 5 stars drive me bananas!) I agree with other reviewers that it was on the sweet side, probably because there seemed to be more of the oatmeal mixture than apples.  I think the next time I make it I will definitely add more apples (like maybe double the apples?).  The taste was spot on, just a little sweet because the "crisp" overwhelmed the amount of apples.  So, with that as my only change for next time, this recipe is definitely a keeper!  I also think I would double the recipe to make a 9x13 pan instead. Yum!

WOW! This is really good and very easy. Instead of dividing the oatmeal mixture into a top and bottom portion, I made half the recipe and used it only on the top. The variety of apples also makes a big difference. Really tart apples are the best - use a tad more sugar.

This was very good.  I was cooking for only two people, so I halved the recipe and split it into four cups of a jumbo muffin pan, sprayed with canola oil.  I baked it for about 30 minutes but I'm not quite sure of the exact time.  Being very careful when removing them from the pan (they tend to break when warm, and came out easiest if I let them cool before removing them and then reheated them individually later), they came out as cute individual desserts.  I used Granny Smith apples.  I also chopped up a few walnuts and mixed them into the top crust.  I served it warm with the Cinnamon Ice Cream posted elsewhere on this site.

I give this 5 stars unequivocally but I had NOT followed the recipe -- by accident I left out the white sugar.  In a flurry I sprinkled some on top when it was cooked, put some butter here and there and put it in for another 5 minutes. 

I'm not sure it would have made much difference but what is clear is that the desert is plenty sweet without the white sugar and even I tend to have a sweet-tooth.

Had it with vanilla yogurt (no ice cream available) and it was yummy!

This was really tasty!  I mixed the apples with the sugar and cinnamon in a bowl.  A zip-lock bag isn't necessary.  I also used white rice flour and GF oats so that it would be a gluten-free dessert for my daughter.  The whole family loved it!

Very Good but it does not need 1/2 cup of sugar mixed with the cinnamon. I used 1/4 Splenda with the 2 tsp cinnamon and it was just right!

This Apple Oatmeal Crisp is delicious! I found that there isn't enough "crisp" to layer the bottom of the pan and still have enough left over to layer on top of the apples, so I doubled the brown sugar, oats, flour, and butter mixture so I would have enough for the top and bottom. I put the apples in a zip lock bag with the sugar and cinnamon and coated them that way and then poured it all into the pan. I also scattered pieces of butter on top before baking to get it golden brown. It is so good served warm with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce on top!

Wonderful as written.  I get so many compliments every time I make this.  Sometimes I just put all the crumble on top and none on bottom and it works out well either way.

Love this apple crisp!  I use to only sometimes like apple crisp but now it is one of my favorite desserts!  I actually usually make more that one apple batch at a time and freeze the extra.  It still turns out great from the freezer.

Good basic recipe. Lots of crisp topping. I used 6 cups of apples and mixed the cinnamon & sugar together and stirred it right in with the apples. All the crisp went on top.  I baked it in a 7 x 11 dish and it came out very good. I think next time I will use even more apples.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious but EXTREMELY sweet.  I would recommend cutting down the sugar cinnamon mixture that goes over the apples.  It was overpowering.

Excellent. I cut the white sugar in half, added about 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg to cinnamon, and added generous 1/4 cup chopped pecans to the crumb mixture on top.

This is my go to apple crisp recipe. I have been making this one for a few years now and hubby loves it. Did not change a thing. Excellent every time. And I made this with pears this time since someone gave me quite a few from their tree. So I gave it a try and just as wonderful as apples.

My kids loved it!  I lessened the sugar to 3/4 cup packed brown sugar, and took the advice of another reviewer - I put the apple pieces in a bag with cinnamon and shook to coat.  I did not add the additional 1/2 white sugar.  It was plenty sweet and absolutely delicious.  Thank you for a great and easy recipe.

one of the most amazing and easiest desserts. my boyfriend loves this more than home made apple pie. I only used brown sugar and melted some sugar in water to pour over the top layer of the apples to make it a bit glazed. sooo good.

Too much crisp and not enough apple. I will make this again but will use more and thicker apple slices. I also will not use as much sugar.  Don't forget to toss in a Granny Smith apple as the tart balances out the sweet. Delicious!

Wow! Very good! Just like my Mother's! The only thing I changed was I did not add as much white sugar and I mixed the apples with some lemon juice (and a bit of sugar and cinnimon).

This is a huge hit with my family--a great way to use apples off your tree in the fall!  I used extra apple because we had so many and it was fine.  Also have added half again as much of everything to make 9 X 13 pan and it is great.

This is my go to recipe for apple crisp.  Super simple, super easy, always a crowd pleaser.  I sprinkle a little sugar and cinnamon on the first crumble layer, one apple layer and the top crumble layer.  I also add about 1/2 cup of toasted pecans on the top, before I put it in the oven.  

NOTE:   I have used apple pie filling, as well as my own canned  apples.  They both worked great, and taste just as good as using fresh apples.

NOTE:  I make this with America's Test Kitchen Gluten Free Flour with a  1/2 tsp of xanthum gum, and use gluten free oats.  You can't even tell it's Gluten Free.  

Serve it warm, with vanilla bean ice cream and drizzle caramel and or chocolate sauce over it.  My family loves this and requests it often..

Delicious! I substituted the apples by frozen blueberries and it turned into an excellent dessert!  Instead of melting the butter I cut it into small pieces and placed them all over the the flower and oatmeal.

Here's how to turn this 4.5 star recipe into a full 5 stars:  do not melt the butter. Soften a stick of butter and cream it into the oats, flour and brown sugar, adding a generous teaspoon of cinnamon. Peel and slice the apples about 1/4-1/3 inch thick. (Apples should be tart or mildly tart, and fresh.). Mix them with a scant 1/2 cup of sugar and another heaping teaspoon of cinnamon. Layer 1/2 the crumb mixture into a prepared 8" square dish. Push the apples into the crumb mixture, and top with the remaining crumb mixture. Bake 38-45 minutes at 350. Do not overbake!  Voila!  The perfect apple crisp.

I have used this recipe three times and I usually add water to it while it backs because it is very dry--or I have increased the melted butter. Is there a difference between rolled oats and quick oats? Someone in another review suggested it might be an error to use quick oats. This recipe is delicious!!! Just trying to figure out how to keep it from being so dry. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

This is very sweet with both layers of the butter/brown sugar mixture. It is quite good, but I found it a little too sweet. That would be my only reason for not giving it 5 stars.

This is the best cobbler of apple I have ever tasted.  I'ved tried a hand full...and not found one until now.  It's so easy that after the 2nd time of making it, I only had to refer to the recipe for the temp. of the recipe.  I actually put in 4 - 5 cups of apples.  It's perfect.  THANK YOU SO MUCH

I doubled the recipe but cut back a bit on the flour to keep it from being dry and added walnuts and raisins.  Once the crisp started to brown, I loosely covered it with foil for the remainder of the cooking time so the raisins wouldn't burn and it came out perfect! A new family recipe! Delish!!

Wonderful recipe. I reduced the butter and added a few splashes of milk. For those that complained that it was too dry, or for those that like it a bit gooey, I would recommend this. It was amazing!

My family's absolute FAVORITE recipe! I don't even like pie....but this is TO DIE FOR! I've made it once with wheat flour and it was still fabulous! ;) I cup up 3 large Granny Smith apples for one recipe and put them in a ziploc bag with the sugar and cinnamon. It helps coat them evenly.

Yummy apple pie crisp!  Some said it was dry and it was a tad bit, but I don't like real soggy crisps.  Granny's are the best for this one because of all the sugar.  The cinnamon was perfect.  I use vietnamise cinnamon which is a stronger than your typical grocery store cinnamon.  Maybe a sprinkle of water of top of apples to help moisten.  3 medium-size Granny's equaled 3 cups.  Would also be good with some chopped walnuts on top.  And don't forget the vanilla ice cream when it's hot!  Thanks for recipe.

I signed up for an allrecipes account JUST to review this recipe. I LOL'ed at a previous reviewer's comment that she thought she'd died and gone to heaven ... a funny sentiment, but apple crisp close to heaven? Eh. MAYBE tiramisu or creme brulee, but certainly not apple crisp...

WRONG! It was heaven and then some! I don't know about you guys, but my crust around the edges turned out chewy, like an oatmeal cookie. My husband (who wasn't impressed with the whole idea of it to begin with) is now on his second serving and just said he would "like it for my next birthday cake." Ha. It's rich but if anything is worth the calories - it's this stuff. GREAT recipe. Thanks so much for sharing it!

(P.S. - we, too, used a little less sugar, dotted the top with butter, and served with Cool Whip. I wouldn't change a thing!) :)

Made almost exactly as it says, LOVED this! Used a tablespoon or two extra of oatmeal, used about 1/2 wheat flour, used a little less brown sugar than called for and also a little less white sugar as some people were saying it did not need to be that sweet and mine turned out great.  Loved how quick and easy this was.

This recipe is extremely versatile, easy, and satisfying. I added pears, didn't have time to peel the apples and I accidentally left out the white sugar but it turned out wonderfully. Very sweet, even without the extra sugar.

awesome! I also reduced the amount of sugar in both the case of the brown and the white sugars... Even still, the crumble and crust came out perfectly and the apples were perfect! It was sooo delicious, I will be using this for all my fruit crisps in the future!

I used canned fried apples, (added some sugar and cinnamon), kept everything else the same except I forgot to add the oatmeal.  It was still great.

can't go wrong with this much sugar and butter... i used almost 4 cups of granny smith apples (3 apples). but then i wished there was more crumble. I liked the crumble on top better than the crumble goo on the bottom. next time i would put more of it on top. try this next time: 1.5 c rolled oats, 1.25 c flour, 1/3 c white sugar.

This is a hit for breakfast with my little ones...we added extra oatmeal and used Splenda in the apples.  They warm this in the mornings...also added granola.

It was a little dry, made it with Splenda could be the reason. Next time try putting a little apple juice in it

Delicious.  I added extra apples and some cinnamon.  I used gluten free bisquick instead of flour since I made for a friend who is wheat sensitive.

I just sprinkled a pinch of cinnamon (It's fall & I'm tired of cinnamon!) & about 1/4 cup sugar over the apples, it was still very sweet even with less sugar. Also, it's a LOT of crust/topping in relation to apples. I preferred "Nutty Apple Crisp" on this site, which uses more apples in relation to topping.  Thank you, it's still pretty good.

I used all Macintosh, because I had a bag of them.  They are a softer and sweeter apple. I tossed apples in plastic bag with (less) sugar and cinnamon.  Even if it happens not to brown to what you think it should, DO NOT overcook or you will have apple mush, tho still tasty.

This was a great recipes, and very easy to make. I did however make a couple changes:  I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2c. of all purpose flour.  I also mixed the sugar and cinnamon in a baggie with the apples. It is easier to coat them.  It made my house smell delicious.  The kids LOVED it!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This was a great way to use left over apples. Followed the recipe but added 1/4 a cup of ground flax seed to the crumble. I also added a 1/4 cup of honey on top of the apple mixture with the cinnamon instead of sugar. We loved this recipe!

The ingredients are good, I like oatmeal crisp. To improve, I would adjust the ratio of apples to crisp. Too much crisp, not enough apples! I ended up baking another 3 cups of apples with cinnamon, and added when serving.

Used half of the white sugar and added an extra apple. Loved the crust on top. Didn't need the oatmeal mix in the bottom of the pan.

Fast, simple and delicious!  This recipe makes a lot of topping, which was a tad dry as written.  The second time I made this, I used 3/4 cup brown sugar, a 3/4 cup flour and cut the sugar/cinnamon mix in half.   I sprinkled the cinnamon sugar in with the apples (which I added until my pan was too full for any more!), reserving some for the very top.

This was exactly what I was looking for! I used 3 large apples (which was more then 3 cups). I used a bit more butter (extra few tablespoons) because it needed more to soak up all the dry ingredients.  I also put the apples in a separate bowl, and combined the white sugar and cinnamon, and tossed it, so the apples were evenly coated. I did use a small glass square dish, and it was SO good. Cooked for 40 minutes.  OMG, I could eat the whole thing myself.  My husband and kids all loved it too (1 year old and 3 year old)! Will make this again and again!

Sooo delicious and simple to make! I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 9x13 pan. I used a variety of apples and used whole wheat flour for 1/3 of the flour. Used as much sugar as the recipe called for and it was perfect! Thanks for sharing!

I made this into 8 individual portions using large ramekins. Lessened the baking time to 30 minutes- perfect presentation for a dinner party. Delicious recipe! I needed about twice as many apples as the recipe called for.

I love this. I used only 1/4 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cups of brown sugar and found I could reduce the sugar even more and I'm not 1 to alter recipes! The person who said it was too dry - I recommend you to try it again. I'm going to do this again! Oh and it was perfect with vanilla yogurt!

Soo good!  I made this as a quick dessert for my boyfriend and I. Nom nom nom!  I left the skins on the apples and used ambrosia apples.

UPDATE: This time we eliminated the cinnamon and used blackberries instead of apples....REALLY good!

Used 3 med. granny smith and 3 med. jonagold and doubled recipe.  Baked in 9x13 for 45 minutes. This is very rich and sweet.  Its delicious with vanilla ice cream.  Next time I would increase the amount of apples because there is a lot of topping.  Depending on sweetness of apple, would reduce the white sugar.

I followed the recipe but did not peel the apples and did not add the white sugar. It came out great- still very sweet. Next time I will add more apple, though, as I felt like there was too much "crisp."

I love this recipe. It was easy and sooo delicious.  I love the crunchy crisp taste of the crisp part.  My family can't get enough. I made a batch last week and this week I'm making another one. (only this time I'm going to double the batch)

This is a great recipe, I added walnuts which gave it a great nutty crunch.  I used the amount of sugar listed suspecting it might be too sweet but it was not.  It was perfect.  I served it warm with Vanilla ice cream, definitely a comfort dessert.

Served this to my P.E.O. sisters last night - it was delicious. Mixed Granny Smith and Macs - cut back on the sugar - increased the cinnamon a bit - added dash of lemon - AND added about 3/4 cup of blueberries - this was the kicker ingredient. Wow - first it looked beautiful and tasted even better -everyone wanted the recipe and it will go into my "make again" notebook.

This was good, but next time I'd use more apples.  I used 4 med. mac. apples and it measured to about 4 cups, but next time I will double to 8 apples and leave the spice ratio the same.  Also, I only used 1/4c white sugar to coat the apples and it was sweet enough.  Defintely serve with ice cream.

This is very sweet. Next time I would add the cinnamon to the crumb mixture and skip the white sugar on top all together. Tasty but very sweet if you follow this recipe exactly.

Yum!  I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and the white sugar to 1/4 cup.  I'll cut it down again next time.  My tastes go towards the 'less sweet' side.  I added a bit if fresh nutmeg with the cinnamon wanting it to taste more like my pies.  It was wonderful.  This is the recipe I was hoping for.  A tweak this way or that does not make the original recipe less perfect.  I think I'll try adding finely chopped nuts into the 'crisp' next time.  The options are endless really.  Thank you so much Dave.

I only used a sprinkle of white sugar, added 1/4 butter, some raisins, and didnt have enough apples so I added some applesauce. Yummy! Next time I'll skip the white sugar completely and cut the brown sugar in half, keep the raisins and skip the extra butter.

I had hard time getting my daughter to like any apple crisp I made. I think I struck gold with this one, she asked for second helping. I omitted white sugar as I felt it was sweet enough. I didnt have any cinnamon on hand so I used allspice. It is awesome and now sitting in my recipe box for future cooking.

Great, basic recipe. I chose this recipe since it had easy to put together ingredients and the results were fantastic. I did use blueberries instead of apples since it is blueberry season, but I think this is a recipe you can easily adapt to any type of fruit! Used splenda instead of white sugar.

This is delicious. I agree that a scant less flour and oatmeal is good and I used 1/4 white sugar and it was plenty sweet. I might also suggest a dash of nutmeg. Tried with caramel sauce...yummy!

All I do is search for a good apple crisp recipe.  I used regular rolled oats in this, they did not cook, the apples didn't cook, I had to put this back in the oven for another 40 min & drenched it in apple juice, then it was ediable, I'm not sure how everyone else's came out so good.  Once it was thoroughly cooked it was tasty, but what a disaster.

This recipe tastes good but is rather dry. I covered it halfway through baking w/ foil  to help keep moisture in and also added a small amount of apple juice and it was still dry. Next time i'll start out with mixing in the apple juice and covering it the whole time.

I made this with Bramley cooking apples (as I am English) and it wasn't dry at all. They are jucier than dessert apples. Because of this I only put the 'crisp' on the top. It was a bit like an English Apple Crumble but better. The whole family loved it and asked for me to make it again. Great recipe!

Very good. The crumble turned out a little dry for me, but I was trying to cut back on some of the butter.  Turns out, you do need that to keep it sufficiently moist.  I also dusted the apples themselves with some cinnamon/sugar mixture.

This was a good recipe and I'll try making it again soon. I used half the sugar which seemed like a lot, but then I had tart apples and they could have used it, I also added some cinnamon to the oatmeal mixture. It baked like a charm and smelled so good. Next time I won't use such tart apples, but that was my own mistake. A great recipe.

We love this recipe!  The only change I made was to use about 4 1/2 cups of apples (4 apples) instead of 3 cups, and cook it a bit longer.  I also double the crisp portion because my family eats it right out of the bowl before I can put it in the oven! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I cut the flour down to 1/2 cup and brown sugar to 3/4 cup. I eliminated the sugar on the apples and added a few drops of water to the apples. It turned out great!  It wasn't too dry or too sweet.  I used McIntosh and Ginger Gold apples.

I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 baking dish, used Granny smith apples and added a bit of cinnamon to the crumb mixtured. Turned out wonderfully! I didn't find it too sweet as some of the others mentioned, I think the tartness of the Granny Smith's offset the sweetness nicely. Will be adding this one to my recipe box for an easy desert.

This was pretty good.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out a little gloppy and not very crunchy.  It tasted great though.  The second time I made it I used 2/3rds of a stick of cold butter cut into pea-sized pieces and cut it into the dry ingredients like you would a pie crust.  Then I stirred in about 6 Tbsp of ice-cold water 2 Tbsp at a time with a fork until the mixture was crumbly.  I liked the second version better.  It was a little crunchier and a little lower in fat.  Thanks for the recipe!

I only gave this recipe four stars and not five because I think the while sugar can be omitted. It was too sweet for both my mother's and my liking. But other than that, this is amazing! So unbelievably easy to make, and the end result is delicious. Great recipe.

This is the BEST apple crisp I've ever had.  Even better than how Grandma used to make.  I don't know why I never thought to have oatmeal crisp on the top & bottom- since the crisp is the best part.

SOOOOOO Good!! I used half granny smiths and half macintosh. Very happy with the texture. I did use only about 2 T white sugar because some people said it was too sweet. I also added about 1/2 cup walnuts to the top because we love nuts. Very yummy!!!!!!!

This was pretty good... I found it to be a little too sweet and a little too dry. Tried it again with a lot less sugar and more butter and it came out wonderfully! Also tried it with raspberry and strawberry jams in the middle and those were both good too!

I've made this twice, the first time by the letter, and the second time with half the sugar (much better). Used half the brown & half the white, and it got raves - definitely sweet enough.

The only thing good about this recipe is that it cured my sweet craving.  Waaay too sweet.  I'd much rather spend the time making an apple pie than making this.

Sorry to dampen all those spectacular reviews, but this was a big dissapointment. The "Crisp" part of the dessert was more of a gummy "Chew", and the taste lacked a certain twang to it. I suggest using tart apples for this recipe or you'll end up wondering "What's Missing?".

I am really not a fan of apple pie/crisp at all, however when I tasted this one I went back for seconds!  I added a tablespoon of caramel and a tablespoon of apple butter when I seasoned the apples and it was delicious!

Great, easy recipe. I added raisins and half a teaspoon of nutmeg to give just a touch of warmth. Served with vanilla ice cream made a delicious dessert to share. I've made it twice in 3 days to take to friend's house.

I’ve made this recipe more times than I can count and I get RAVE reviews everytime! Seriously family and friends ask me to make it constantly. I always double the recipe and use a 9x13 pan, also instead of sprinkling the cinnamon sugar on the apples I mix them beforehand. But seriously try this if you haven’t it’s HEAVENLY

Easiest best recipe ever!  It is so easy to change the fruit, add different fruits and it is still easy and fabulous.  I thought it was a bit sweet myself, but my family ate it sooo fast we didn't have any leftovers.

I have made this several times and it's always a crowd pleaser. I use almond flour instead of regular flour. I double the fruit and use any mixture of fruit that is in season. Today I used strawberries and rhubarb.  I also cut down on the white sugar.

I was worried from some reviews that it would be dry. To the contrary. It was a perfect dish! It may depend upon the apples you buy as to the dry factor.

Inedibly sweet, I think the 1/2 cup of white sugar on top of the apples could be skipped entirely (I made it with Gala apples). Good flavor otherwise, and one bowl prep is great.

It has become a favorite of our family. Be sure to cook it long enough for the sugar on the top to caramelize. It is way better than what the picture shows:-)

Tried to make it healthier and it was good so I imagine original recipe would be very "musty" (Must have more!) — I added extra 1/3 cup oatmeal and cut back a bit on brown sugar. Amount I cut back on is the amount of raw sugar I used to mix with cinnamon and sprinkle on apples.  Didn't use white sugar but used sweet apples and added a 4th. If you want the sweet recipe you ate as a kid, enjoy the original, but for those of us who aren't kids anymore, these modifications work.

Great basic recipe for classic apple crisp. My daughters and wife all loved it! I was a hero at dinner time. I added some nutmeg and a few raisins. Used honey crisp appes fresh from the orchard. They are not my favorite baking apple, but the recipe turned out really nice nevertheless. Yum! I want to go back for seconds.

This recipe was delicious. I did read about comments of it being dry, so I just added another apple. The crisp came out with a moist, caramel texture. I used 3 Granny Smith apples and the other was a mystery apple. All the apples were from the local orchard and I don't remember what the one was. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Tasty but REALLY SWEET!  I would cut down the white sugar and cinnamon mixture to probably half.  This is  a must serve with vanilla ice cream to combat that over the top sweetness.  A great recipe to use up those extra apples during fall.  Mahalo!

Made some slight changes as per suggestions from others plus past personal experience. Combine sliced apples w cinnamon & white sugar in a separate bowl. I also added a pinch of nutmeg and a dash of vanilla.  Let this sit a while to draw out some of the liquid (finished product will not be too dry this way). Combine remaining dry ingredients plus butter in another bowl. This facilitates construction since the unique aspect of this recipe is the inclusion of the topping on the bottom as well. The outcome was easily one of the Best Crisps i ever made or enjoyed!

House favorite! I have made this about 6 times and it always turns out great. I did change it a little bit - I coated the apples with the cinnamon and sugar mix before layering them in the crisp. We have tried it both ways and prefer it mixed in. We also add another small apple sometimes, and use old fashioned oats. Last time I used 2 small apples, 1 pear, and 1/2 cup or so rhubarb. It was excellent! Great base recipe, easy to make it your own. Thank you Dave!

omg.............I made this and doubled the recipe.  The only thing I did differently, was that I sprinkled some cocoa powder over the apples with the cinammon. I sprayed my pan with baking spray that has flour in it cuz I hate having to work too hard at cleaning up. Also, I didn't double the white sugar that was sprinkled on the apples.  This was absolutely delicious!!  Thankyou so much for sharing your grandma's recipe with us, it was fantastic!!  I baked it for 40 minutes and covered it with foil for the last 10 or so so it wouldn't darken up too much.  We all loved it and the house smelled sooooooooo good!

I had no fresh apples so instead I used a 21 ounce can of apple pie filling.  Put down first layer.  Used a knife in the can to dice up the apple slices, then poured entire can over first layer.  Sprinkled it with some cinnamon sugar I keep mixed in the spice cabinet, then put top layer on.  Hit the spot!  Wish I had a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

My family loved this!! So simple and delicious on a chilly fall evening!  I used Honey Crisp apples, so I followed recommendations and used a bit less sugar.  I also swapped 1/4C of the flour with an additional 1/4 oats.  Perfect!

I made it almost as written and it was delicious, but it turned out dry.  I'm thinking this may be dependent on the apple variety.  I used heirloom apples from my brother's property; I think they may be an old macintosh type but I'm not sure.  Still, it was very yummy!  The only minor modification I made was to cut down on white sugar because we like things a little less sweet.

My first apple recipe I have ever made and it was well worth the wait!  Awesome!  I did only use 1/4 c. butter and 1/4 c. unsweet applesauce to cut some calories.  Also, used 1/2 c. wheat flour and 1/2 c. white flour, and 1/3 c. white sugar.  Perfection!  Thanks for sharing this!

I think this is an EXCELLENT Apple Crumble recipe, and I'm going to pass it along to all my young adult children who are beginning to bake for themselves. In response to previous reviews, Just like most fruit recipes you can not follow them "exactly", and neither would the grandma who handed down this recipe! Sweetness and moistness of the final product depend on the sweetness and juiciness of the fruit you're using. So.....taste the apples, then add more or less sugar, more or less crumble, depending on your taste. I've made the recipe twice this week with different amounts of sugar because I used different apples. I also used two bowls; one to toss the sugar with the apples before adding them to the pan, and per our taste, we like less crumble on the bottom, more on top, to get crunchy. Next time I'll probably add cinnamon, nuts, cranberries......yet, this is an EXCELLENT basic apple crumble recipe.

Delicious.  I've never had a fruit crisp before.  This recipe tastes to me like a soft oatmeal cookie with fruit.  Based on other reviews, I cut back a little of the flour and I increased the butter a little.  The sugar and butter caramelize a little in the oven. I used canned peaches and I set aside the juice from the can in case the dish turned out dry.  It wasn't dry at all.

Very nice! Substituted butter with "buttery spread", turned out beautifully.  Allowing this to cool a bit after removing from oven is where you get the "crisp". Will make again, thank you so much for sharing.

I always love recipes that were "handed down by grandma!"  This was a wonderful recipe for anyone like myself who loves oatmeal with apples.  I do plan to make this again, but I will bake a little longer than the 45 minutes recommended.  The sugar in the topping remained a bit grainy on my first attempt, and I think a longer baking time would remedy that.  As some of the other reviewers stated, using a little less sugar is an option.  Simply a matter of preference.  Thanks, Dave, for sharing this keeper!  Enjoyed it.

Delicious! Although next time I'm going to drastically reduce the white sugar.  I used a fairly sweet apple so the extra sugar was not necessary. But it came out very delicious with a little milk in a bowl, or even a scoop of ice cream.

This recipe rocks! I was hunting for a good apple crisp recipe and this is it! Next time, I would likely eliminate the white sugar altogether as the apples were sweet enough. Really love the different texture of the crisp on the bottom vs. on top. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

The folks who owned the orchard got it exactly RIGHT!  This is by far the best recipe of its kind anywhere!  While the tasty result is rustic (not exactly pretty), presendation can be dressed up if served in a martini glass with a thin slice of raw apple (with the peal) hanging off the rim, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream plus a fine spritz of raspberry coulis for color interest and a bit of snap!

WOW!!!  I just made this because I saw the video it looked so easy and good.. I said if it didnt' taste good so what... not that expensive .. Well since we are dieting, well trying to eat healthier.. I made this with Splender Brown Surgar Blend, I also use "I can't believe it's not butter", I did cook this for about 50 -55minutes , it was not dry it was moist & crispy crust on the outside we served it with scoops of vanilla bean frozen yogurt... So this was really a healthy desert. My sister-in-law said it was the best desert she ever had.. and she is not an apple person at all.

Outrageously sweet. A cup of brown sugar in the mix and 1/2 cup of white over the top all in an 8 inch square pan...wow. Overall, it was unpalatable, at least for me. Sorry.

It was delicious, but I rate it a bit lower just because of the changes I made to the original recipe. 1) I added about 1/2 c more oats and reduced the flour by 1/2 c. I know usually these are not exchanged 1 for 1, but here it worked well -- not dryness as some members reported. 2) I used sweet apples (kept white prior with vinegar) therefore, I used NO sugar with the cinnamon. I also used about 1/3 more apples than they called for, but it was totally yummy with those proportions! Still the whole dish was a quite sweet for my liking so the second time I reduced the sugar by 1/3 and that was good (I might even reduce it to 1/2 the sugar next time). 3) I added some long bran cereal to to crumble to give it more nutrition -- that was GREAT! 4) I added 1/2 a tsp to the crumble mixture -- it was a very nice complementing flavour! 5) I topped it off in the end with crumbled walnuts. That was really yummy! Overall -- with my notes factored in, this is my new Apple Crisp Recipe. (If only good apples, oatmeal, and brown sugar weren't so difficult to find in this country!)

Good but very sweet with jonagold apples.   With a sweeter apple, cut sugar way back.  It's all about which apples you use if it's sweet or juicy or dry.   The recipe is great.  But your results will vary depending on your apple choice.   Think about how different a granny smith tastes from a golden delicious for example.  Adjust sugar accordingly.

While tasty, I think that I will make some revisions to this recipe next time I try it. The crumb mixture was great but I wished for a higher apple to crumb ratio and will use a deeper dish and more apples next time (I used about 4 cups). I will probably also skip the white sugar as this was too sweet for me.

I'm not sure why this recipe is so good, but YUM. I used organic brown sugar and flour and instead of the white sugar I sprinkled Sugar in the Raw over the top of the apples, more like 1/4 cup or less. Now about to make many many batches to put away in the freezer. YUM

The taste was good, but the texture is off. Like other reviewers, I had a problem with dryness - I think there is too much flour/not enough butter (how can one stick not be enough?? lol). Also, I used 4 cups of apples, unpeeled, and tossed with lemon juice before tossing with sugar/cinnamon. 

I would make this recipe again with the following changes: (1) Higher oat:flour ratio; (2) More butter so that all of the dry ingredients are moistened; (3) More apples (maybe 5 cups); (4) Only enough sugar to coat the apples (probably 1/4 c or so). 

This recipe is worth trying - just use your intuition with ingredient amounts and it will be great. So quick and simple too!!

Excellent and the topping can be used with any fresh fruit. The topping has just the right ratio of oats, flour and butter. Top this with vanilla ice cream and oo la la! It's so gooo!

I never thought to put the crisp on the bottom as well as the top. Genius.

Awesome & super easy! I didn't have an issue with it being dry like others did. The only thing I did different was not use nearly as much white sugar as the recipe called for.

Very good recipe but I followed some of the other reviewer's advice and added more spices and sugar to the apples.  Will double the recipe next time and bake in a larger pan - delicious!

Cut the white sugar in half and sift the 2 tsp of cinnamon into the white sugar.  I too added dobs of butter on top, because it was baking too dry on top.   5 stars all the way!!!

I love this recipe! Super easy and quick. I used whole wheat flour, and it still tasted great! I also copied someone else's idea of mix the apples, sugar, and cinnamon together in a ziplock bag before adding into the recipe. So yummy,

i tried too,  it, it's too dry, may be it need more butter or less flour and oatmeal. and it's too sweet too, even when i used non sweet apples, u need to taste the acidity of the apple to balance the sweetness from the sugar. i think the measurements need adjustment

Very easy. I like that the measurements are very simple. Use real butter, I didn't (because I only had the better-for-you-margarine) but it still turned out very good.

I make this recipe at least once a week. I LOVE it!!! I use any fruit I have on hand, including canned. I cook the fruit (or heat in the case of canned) per the recipe and crumble the topping across the top and bake. Absolutely fantastic. To those who said it was too dry, simply add some extra butter and problem solved. Rich and delicious every time. =)

Don't give up on this!  Make sure you really mix the stick of butter in with the flour so it is all moist.  I also mix butternut squash (peeled and cubed) with the apples.....then you can eat it for dinner without guilt :)

This is SO good! I love fruity desserts, but this has the sweet, sour, soft, creamy, and crunchy all in one! It makes it even more satisfying. A 10X13 pan never lasts overnight, even when I make it late in the evening!

i made this for a big super bowl party & they cleaned the dish!  it's very simple. i doubled the whole thing for the big 9x13 dish i used.  then i doubled (so 4x) the topping like the other reviews suggested.  i added the rest of my chopped pecans (3/4c-ish) to the oat topping.  & i added the rest of my craisins (~1c) to the apples.  i also extra doubled the cinnamon by mistake... but it was great.  i used 3 kinds of apples.  i would use some more apples next time.  it took about 75 min to bake cause it was so much bigger.  i just poked it til the apples felt right.  this was a fun recipe -  like i couldn't mess it up if i tried!  i'm passing the recipe along by request!

I made this last night and it was immediately a family favorite! Thank you so much for sharing, Dave! Only thing I did different was I didn't measure cinnamon.... just sprinkled until it 'looked right' Topped with vanilla ice cream and caramel drizzle= perfection!

I had fairly dry (read OLD) green apples.  The mix worked well for me as written, not too dry at all, though I did add another half cup or so of the apples.  This is a delicious and comforting dessert!

I love this recipe! I've made it three times in the past month for company and seems to be the perfect end to an autumn/Christmas season meal. I put it in the oven when we sit down to eat our dinner so it's hot and fresh out of the oven when it's time for desert.  I like to prepare it ahead of time so I squeeze lemon on the apples to keep them from going brown.

I tried this recipe with a few changes/additions.  I mixed up the dry ingredients as suggested with the addition of 1/8 tsp of nutmeg.  I put the mixture in a ziplock bag so I could make individual crisps whenever I wanted them.  For one individual dessert I cored, peeled and cut up one medium size granny smith apple and added a few drops of lemon juice concentrate, a couple of cereal spoons of leftover homemade cranberry sauce (from thanksgiving) and a sprinkling of the cinnamon sugar mixture.  In a single serving size glass pyrex I put a layer of the crumb mixture in the dish, then the apple mixture, then topped with a layer of crumb mixture and baked at 350 for 30-40 minutes.  I served with vanilla icecream.  Note: we have nut allergies in our house so when you do this as individual servings, you can add or omit chopped pecans in the crumb mixture as desired.

This recipe is so good! I followed it almost to a t. However, I didn't peel my apples and it still turned out great. I used granny smith and gala apples because that's what we had in the fridge.

I cut down a little bit on the white sugar. It was good but the crumb topping was a little bit gummy. I am not sure why.

This is the best apple crisp recipe ever! Super easy to make. I used a combo of granny smith and gala apples. This is going in my recipe box for sure.

Great apple crisp!  Just what I was looking for.  When there is a crust on the bottom (or middle) as well as the top, our family has always referred to it as "Brown Betty" instead of "Apple Crisp" (which has crust on the top only).  I was actually looking for a Brown Betty recipe when I found this one, so it was perfect.  It was very sweet, but very yummy, and so quick and easy to make.  I made it for company tonight and it was a hit.  I've added it to my recipe collection and will definitely use it again.  Thanks!

Excellent apple crisp recipe!  I tweaked it a little by adding a little fresh lemon juice to the apples and also a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  Also, instead of melting the butter I cut the butter into small pieces and combined them in with the dry ingredients.   Results were spectacular!  Delicious!

Delicious!  I doubled the apples, but kept the topping ingredients the same.  I put all the oatmeal mixture on top of apples.  I took to a church dessert fellowship and got lots of compliments.  My family loved it too!  Thanks for the great recipe.

this is really yummy. i added 1/2 c chopped walnuts since i had some on hand. since i added a little extra to the topping mixture, i snuck in a little extra butter.   this turned out just how i like my apple crisp- crunchy on top, and sort of creamy in the middle. the oats give it a lot of texture and flavor. i disagree with other reviewers who commented that this was dry- mine was bubbling and full of that gooey, moist flavor. make sure you use an 8-inch pan, not a larger one. that may contribute to drying.

This was delicious!  I tripled the "crisp" part of the recipe because it's my absolute favorite part, and it was perfect.  I left the skins on the apples because I like the flavor that way.  I would make this recipe everyday if I could trust myself not to eat it all at once.  :)

Excellent recipe!  I made it exactly as writer's recipe was written.  Only changes I will make next time is to omit the white sugar and cinnamon topping altogether -- too much sugar, and I will add pumpkin pie spice to the apples.

This was my first time making apple crisp. This recipe was easy to follow and came out great! I used some green apples my neighbor gave me. The only thing I did different was using half wheat flour. Next time, I think I'll use all wheat. It was just what I wanted. I will be making it again. Thanks

I love recipes you can play with and this is one of them! I added dried cranberries to the apples, and walnuts, flax seeds and cinnamon to the crumb mixture. Mmmmmm..... Thank-you for the recipe! Devine!

Positives:  great flavor, very easy Negatives:  a little dry Spin:  The slight dryness is offset with a scoop of ice cream.  Note: used the other side of the cheese grater to cut the apples into equally thin slices.

This is awesome and easy to make! I substituted the all-purpose flour with spelt flour - very yummy. However, if you are using freshly picked sweet apples, cut way back on the sugar. I used a cup of brown sugar and would cut that in half next time - I used 1/4 cup of white sugar and would use even less. Everyone loved it, in spite of the sugar rush!

This is the best!  Perfect recipe.  Easy to make and amazing flavor.  I made 2 minor adjustments.  Since some reviewers stated it was dry, I drizzled a little honey over the apples (probably not necessary) and others said it was too sweet, but I used granny smith (tart) apples and added a few extra past the 3 cups it called for.  Topping was perfect.  Very crunchy and tons or flavor.

If you'd like this apple crisp more moist, cover it with tin foil right out of the oven. It will soften it up right away. Wait till it cools a bit, and then serve.

Made this recipes by the book the first time.  I liked it better the second time when I cut the brown sugar to 1/2 c and added an extra 1/2 c oats.  Also, since some people said 1 c was too much white sugar, I simply used my cinnamon sugar shaker to coat the apples.

Kinda wet- possibly the apples I used (red-they were in the basket, had to be used) I followed the recipe exactly except for the 1/c cup white sugar.  Feel bad about my life using 1/2 C butter but, I did it for Guido.  He's got the vanilla ice cream ready for his second helping...

I really enjoyed this recipe, I added 2 cups of chopped apples and 2 cups of chopped pears.  I decreased the white sugar to 1/3 cup and coated the fruit with the cinnamon and sugar by shaking in a bag.  Delicious, not to mention a great way to make the house smell great.

This was great!  I took another reviewers advice and only used 1/4 cup of white sugar instead of 1/2 cup and it was still very sweet.  This is a keeper for sure.  Husband and I both loved it so much we emailed it to friends.

I am culinarily challenged. so made it exactly as written (as I was craving some comfort food).  This was amazing!  A little richer than I remembered, but simply amazing!  I may cut down on the brown sugar and flour next time, but this was absolutely amazing!  Thanks, Dave!

Amazing!!  I used whole wheat flour instead of white. I didn't peel the apples. I threw the chopped apples in a ziploc bag with sugar and cinnamon.  I used less sugar by the way and it still came out very yummy.   Everyone loved it!

Good, but too much topping. I skipped the white sugar entirely and liked the oatmeal cookie taste, but there was just way too much of it for 3 cups of apples. Plus, the topping is very heavy and thick (not crumbly). I still loved the flavors, I'd just use more apples next time.

My husband raved over this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to toss the apples in the cinnamon and sugar instead of sprinkling.  My husband requested that next time I double the amount of topping...he thinks it's the best part.

Excellent! Followed recipe exactly but used 4 1/2 cups apple (i love apples). my apple of choice was the Mutsu, tastes like a cross between a golden delicious and a granny smith but not as tart as the granny. great choice for an apple crisp!

Delicious!  I made this last night to rave reviews.  Based on reading the feedback, I used probably 3/4 cup flour so the crumbly mixture would be a little less dry.  Then couldn't stop eating it out of the bowl, haha.  Great recipe.

Very good recipe.  I made these in foil muffin cups to take to a pot luck.  I baked them at 375 for about 30 minutes.  They were a great hit.

I loved this recipe it was exactly what I was looking for.  The oatmeal mixture came out crunchy and not moist like so many crisp recipes.  I did half the recipe and I did not do the white sugar thing with the apples just sprinkled cinnamon.  I also did decreased the butter to one less tablespoon, and used whole wheat flour, also I baked mine a bit longer I think I cooked it for 45 mins. but I also halfed the recipe.  I used granny smith apples and did not peel the skins off.  Very good recipe!!! Thank you for sharing:)

I tried using 1/2 the sugar so my kids wouldn't climb the walls.  They loved it but I think I prefer the extra sugar. Also, it was a little dryer than I expected but it's my own fault as I used a little less butter (trying again to be healthier).  I will either use full amount next time or maybe just eat it with ice cream! (Heathly-smealthy...)

Not what I expected.  I was hoping to recreate the apple crisp I remember having in the grade school cafeteria for lunch.  I used granny smith apples and probably should have cut down on the cook time, since they were softer than I would have liked.  I also wanted the "crisp" to be crisper.  I'll keep working at it.

Used splenda sugars, added dried cherries, left the skins on the apples, and doubled the cinnamon. Added a little allspice too. Sweet and yummy. Didn't even use the ice cream!

amazing recipe, a new favorite for the keeping, the only change was the flour I used was whole wheat (just didn't have any all purpose) and still turned out perfectly...not sure how it could turn out dry(according to other review) maybe not the right kind of apple.

Hands down this is one of the best desserts I have made.  I did cut the white sugar down to 1/4 cup but, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Will make again and again.

Terrific!  I did make some modifications, mostly that I didn't exactly measure anything.  I used the recipe as a guideline, but probably used more cinnamon, flour and less sugar than called for.  It was delicious topped w/vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is my favorite "crisp" recipe so far. My husband said it wasn't "juicy" enough but the last one I tried was too "juicy" so there's no pleasing everyone all the time! I reduced the sugar by more than half overall in this recipe as I was using nice, sweet Gala apples. I used 1/2c. in the oatmeal mixture and for the final "sprinkling" I used less than 1/4 of a cup, I literally just sprinkled Splenda over the apples and then used the cinnamon bottle's shaker feature to shake it over the apples before topping with the other half of the oatmeal mixture. I also replaced half the white flour with whole wheat flour, and I wouldn't have known the difference. I did not have the required 8 tablespoons of butter; I only had 5 left! So I melted these and added heavy cream to make up the rest. Butter would've tasted better, but heavy cream did work fine, though I wouldn't do that again on purpose. I will definitely make this again :-)

Best one yet, I added 1/2-3/4 c chopped cranberries, 3/4 c choc chip or other kind & 1/2 c apple juice over top of crisp, then baked. The most moist crisp I've ever tried or eaten. I used 5 small or 4 med. apples. I also added a little apple pie spice.

This is a great basic recipe for Apple Crisp and there can be a million different versions of how it's prepared, but the basics here are important. I personally add some golden raisins (1/4 cup) to my apples and only use half the flour and sugar and put it on the top of the apples only. Apples are mixed w/ some lemon juice sugar and cinammon and place in a large buttered glass pan. But the basic ingredients are all here for a classic wonderful apple crisp. Just like Granny used to make.

Simple, easy to make, and delicious.  I read and followed the suggestion of using 1/2 a cup of sugar. My husband, who is quite the critic, enjoyed it but did suggest using the full amount of sugar if using tart apples--I used Granny Smith Apples which tend to be tart.  But overall this is a recipe to keep and versatile.

Loved this easy recipe!  I made it even easier by omitting the white sugar & exchanging 1 tsp. of the cinnamon for 1 tsp. allspice & just mixed the spices into the brown sugar mixture.  Only lasted 1 1/2 days in my house!  The oatmeal in the topping got me thinking this would be a great mix-in to plain oatmeal :)  Try this - you'll make it again & again.

Simply scrumptious. Just like apple crumble but even better as it's got two layers of crumble. This was so popular I had to make it again the next day.

This was very good.  I like a lot of crisp and that is exactly what I got.  Next time I will add more apples.  Very yummy.

This recipe was awesome!! I made a pan for my boyfriend to to have with his kids, then I went home and made some for my sons.  We used Fuji apples (my favorite for pies).  When I made my batch though, I cut the sugar and cinnamon in half.  But this is a delicious recipe nonetheless!  Will keep this one with my   favorites!

This was SO incredibly good.  I followed the directions exactly and used Rome apples.  It was gone before I knew it.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

It was just ok for me. a good way to use the oatmeal we had for a long time in home. I think 45 min it's not enough to have it crunchy.I cooked it for 55 min but I still could have cooked it for longer time.

I'd made, apple crisp once before about fifteen years ago. I am glad that I decided to make it again, and that I used this particular recipe. I squeezed lemon over the chopped apples to retain their color. This no doubt slightly altered the flavor of the original recipe, but for sure did it no injustice.  It may, have cut the sweetness a bit, and given it a added tang. I liked the flavor and the slightly chewy texture of the bottom crust. I ate just a small square of it, and was extremely satisfied.

Just served this last night with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. Was well received. I added a cup or so apples than it caused for, and did not even use close to the 1/2 cup of sugar it called for. That would have been way too much. Otherwise very simple and good. Next time I might add more spices.

I thought this was very tasty.  I used 1 cup of Quaker simple harvest instant hot cereal.  It was the maple brown sugar and pecans but if you use this you might want to put less brown sugar, came out really sweet for me.  I  sliced the  apples about an half inch thick and layered it over the cereal, came out looking like apple pie.  Excellent with vanilla ice cream.

I think this recipe is great. Since people said that it baked somewhat I dry I lined the pan with butter and decreased the flour to 3/4 a cup and it was fantastic! The entire pan was gone within 30 minutes after baking. I actually baked a second pan the same day.

This turned out a little dry, but not overly.  I used a little more butter than directed and less white sugar since I had sweeter apples.  With a little bit of ice cream it balanced out just fine and wasn't too dry to eat.  Other reviews that stated it was "too dry" might want to try altering the ingredients a little.  Use more melted butter and make it more of a gooey consistency than crumbly.  That should help to eliminate most of the complaints that it is dry.

Fantastic!!! I brought it into work for a fall party and everyone loved it!  It was described as "made with love" and "a little bit of heaven"!  I used Granny Smith apples and added a little water (~1/4 cup) following the recommendations of other reviewers.  Thanks for the recipe and tips!

Yes, it was sweet but both my husband and I have a sweet tooth. Used red delicious apples on hand and it was great. Would probably be even better with a tart Granny Smith. A keeper because of ease -- too bad it isn't healthier but I might try to rework that a little next time.

Incredibly delicious, and good with any kind of apples!  The oats give it an 'oatmeal cookie' texture.  A great dessert!  I will use less sugar (brown and white) next time though!

Mmmmm... this is delish!  I used all granny smith apples, some extra cinnamon, and subbed whole wheat flour (cuz I like me some fiber).  Anyhoo... it turned out great - especially warm from the oven.  This stuff's dangerous (and really quick to whip up)... my boyfriend's gonna love it.

I don't usually like apples, but this dish is excellent. The only changes I made: mixed apples, sugar, and cinnamon, and a pinch of cloves in ziplock. I melted caramels and drizzled them on top of the apples after I put them in the dish. I also added about a cup of chopped walnuts to the oatmeal mixture. Everyone really enjoyed this with a scoop of ice cream on top.

I cheated and used a can of apple pie filing because it was all I had on hand.  Everyone LOVED it!!!  Great fast dessert.  Easy to keep all ingredients on hand for that last minute request or suprise guest.  I'll make other apple crisp, but because of ease, this one is a keeper!!!

Very good and EASY! I was going to use apple pie filling and sliced pears (long story) and only added about half of the butter, since we were very low on it. I forgot about my plan to add the pie filling until after I had put the topping layer on. I improvised by adding  some pancake syurp (with butter flavor) on top to add some moisture and flavor. It worked well and everyone loved it. Very easy to add stuff to this recipe.

I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9 x 13 pan.  Worked great.  The second time I made it I actually mixed the white sugar, cinnamon, and apples before putting it on the crumbs.  My family liked it a lot better that way.

I made this recipe for my class...and they wanted me to make sure everyone knows how fabulous it is. They ate up every bit of it and could've eaten more. My only suggestion is to cut back the sugar a bit. It was much too sweet. Otherwise, happy baking! You won't regret making this one!

I can't remember how many times I've made this since I've found the recipe. It is so easy and yummy. I had some leftover frozen blueberries that I added, about 3/4 of a cup and it was a yummy change. Don't forget a scoop of vanilla ice cream with it!

So easy to make! Came out excellent! Only thing I changed was I mixed the apples all together with the sugar and cinnamon. This recipe is a keeper.

My daughter loved this, I made it for her birthday.  I didn't melt the butter but let it soften and then my daughter mixed with her hands, she loved it.  I used about 6 granny smith apples, and I put the apples, white sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon in a ziplock back and shook before putting in the pan.  I also put 1 tsp of the cinnamon in with the topping.  The crunchy topping on bottom was great.  I will make this again.

I've made this recipe quite often.  I always make it as printed, never change it.  It's delicious!  My husband begs for me to make it all of the time and my Dad and mother-in-law have both asked for the recipe saying it's the best crisp they have ever had.

Simple and yummy but I did make a few changes. I added a bit of vanilla and cut the brown and white sugar by about a quarter. I also squeezed a bit of lemon juice on the apples too. I used pink lady apples - a tart but kinda sweet apple that worked really well. I think the next time I make it I will add some raisins or maybe cranberries.

It was very dry and even with tweaking the recipe, no white sugar, adding nutmeg and more butter, the crisp was just crumbs of brown sugar.  I think less flour and combining the crumb and the apples might help, along with a little lemon and ginger.  I used a combination of Granny Smith and a new sweet, juicy variety of apples.

This is a KISS (Keep It Simple Sweetheart) recipe and makes a great basic crumble.  Works with peaches, pears and cherries too.  I like to keep the peels on the fruit and use the juice of a lemon to balance the sweetness of the crusts.  And the smell of apples and cinnamon on a snowy Canadian enter day ... heaven in a bowl!

Tasted pretty good.  I think it would be much simpler to make by NOT melting the butter.  And that would make it less "dry" tasting.  And it would crumble more easily.

I mixed  some of the cinnamon and sugar with the apples and sprinkled what was left in top of the apples.  I also increased everything but the cinnamon by half of what it called for and used 10 apples to put in a 13 x 9 pan.

This recipe was a little too sweet for us using Cortland apples.  It probably would be fine with Granny Smith however.  I would cut back a smidgen on the sugars next time but it was still was a good dessert and everyone enjoyed it.

This recipe was very good and easy as i melted the butter per recipe.  I made it as written.  It was done 10 minutes early and the topping did get a little burnt, but i was able to scrape it off and with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, no one but me was the wiser

Loved It! Followed the recipe exactly as it was written with one minor exception: I did mix the cinnamon and sugar with the apples first in a separate bowl instead of just sprinkling in on the apples - extra bowl yes,  but I feel like it helped evenly coat the apples. Turned out wonderful and it was all gone by the next day. It reheated nicely on day #2  straight from the fridge. I will definitely make this again.

This apple crisp taste fine but it's awfully dry.  I used  nearly 5 cups of apples and added cinnamon because it seemed to me that it would be dry and it still was.  My suggestion is that it's a fine recipe but you will need to add some apple juice to the mix.  Maybe drizzle it on before baking.  I will serve it with creme fraiche.

This smelled so good while it was baking, but I felt it was too sweet and too cinnamony. I followed the directions exactly as written. Next time I plan to cut the cinnamon in half and probably cut the sugar that is sprinkled on top the apples also in half.

Not good. I did exactly as written, with topping on top and bottom. The topping never really baked into the apples and it was like powdery flour and oats on top of crunchy apples. Maybe the type of apple you use is a factor, but this is just not appealing at all.

Delicious! It is a very easy recipe! I used 3 large Granny Smith apples (was about 4 cups).  I used a Jr. Cake pan (8x11 inch pan) and it was a perfect size for this. Next time I will maybe use one more apple for my size of pan.  I will use this recipe from now on!

This was very good and I will definitely make it again. Will probably reduce the amount of sugar though as it was very sweet.

Very sweet! I like my apples more tart. Next time I will not use the 1/2 cup of sugar on apples. I will use 1 tablespoon sugar with the cinnamon. Otherwise, great recipe.

This is my go to recipe with a few changes. I use 1/4 c of sugar and the same amount of cinnamon for the cinnamon sugar mix. I find that using the full 1/2 c of white sugar  makes it too sweet. As far as the dryness, the recipe as is, is too dry for my taste, to combat this, after washing the apples, I don't dry the apples and I also sprinkle 1-2 tabs of water on top of the apples after I put the first layer of crumple and the apples down. This makes for a gooey bottom that I love have fallen in love with.

Terrific classic apple crumble. Simple but delicious. I had to bake for 55 minutes to get the top crust they way I wanted. I also used only 1 (vs 1.5 in the recipe) cup of sugar and found it plenty sweet. The crust was a little dry first time through so 2nd time I mixed 3 tbsp. of maple syrup with 1 tbsp. of bourbon and drizzled it across the top.

I’ve recently been experimenting with apple crisp and this is my favorite recipe so far. I’ve made it twice now, and the first time it was way too sweet for my taste (especially because I like it with ice cream). This time, I made a few changes that didn’t change the overall dish, but I think made it better suited to my tastes.  Here’s what I changed: 
*I mostly kept the crumble mixture the same, but I didn't have brown sugar so I added 2 T of molasses to 1 cup white sugar
*Doubled the apples 
*Sprinkled apples with lemon juice (I only had sweet red apples and wanted them a little more tart)
*Reduced the sugar on the apple part to just 2 T
*Increased cinnamon to 1 T
*Added a sprinkle of nutmeg
*Finally, I didn't plan well and had to refrigerate the assembled dish for about an hour before I cooked it. I think this actually had the most important effect - the chilled butter led to a slightly crunchy, chewier topping than when I made it before (I used the molasses before too, so I know it wasn't that).  
Overall, this is so delicious and easy to experiment with.

I followed the recipe for this apple crisp exactly as given. I was more than disappointed with the final results. In my opinion, there was too much flour and the bottom was a solid mass of flour/oats which was not edible. I scraped the mixture off of the apples and ate the apples without the oat mixture. I have made many apple crisps in my day, but I must rate this the worst that I have tried. I will stick to my trusted recipe that I have used for years. My days of experimenting with other recipes have come to a screeching halt.  The one good note is that I salvaged the apples so it had a good ending at least.

I added a splash of vanilla and a quarter cup of shortening to the oatmeal/flour/brown sugar mix just to give it a little complexity and slightly more crunch.

Great tasting crisp topping! I recently made and canned apple pie filling and used that for this recipe. My crisp turned out very moist and flavorful.

It was so easy to put together.  I used pears instead of apple because we have an abundance on our tree.  It turned out great and my children loved it.

Aloha,  I added but of Cinnamon,  and a dash of nutmeg to the crumble mixture,  then tossed the apples with a little cinnamon,  nutmeg,  brown sugar(1/4 tsp cinnamon and nutmeg,  1tsp brown sugar.) Before layering on bottom crumble mixture. 
Oh,  skipped the white sugar all together,  and using Dark brown sugar for more carmelization.

I have made this recipe several times and it turns out amazing every time.  I am dairy free, and egg free, so this is a wonderful dessert that doesn't have to involve CHOCOLATE!!  As much as I love chocolate, I am not supposed to have caffeine either!  Most recipes that are vegan have to involve chocolate somehow.

I made 1 1/2 times the recipe to serve 12using Granny Smith apples - Just make sure you slice the apples thin so that they cook to perfection! Baked 40 minutes at 330 degrees until bubbling up the sides. (I added 1 Tbsp of Clear Gel and a bit of freshly grated nutmeg-everyone raved...)

Thank you Dave for your simple recipe of Apple Oatmeal Crisp. I had all the ingredients in my kitchen in the desert, except for the ice cream. I needed something sweet and it was an easy fix.

I made this but the mix turned out to be very dry and powdery.  Pretty much inedible. I ended up taking the entire thing apart after baking and added an extra 1/2 cup of melted margarine to make the crumble more moist.

I made this but used one and a half cans of cherry pie filling. I deleted the cinnamon, cut the brown sugar to 1/3 cup and used a 1/4 cup of white sugar. I also decreased the butter to 6 tablespoons. If I were to make this again, I would increase the butter and maybe even use oat flour or quick oats instead of the flour.

I made a sugar free version of this recipe. It was good and the hubby really  liked it. I liked the crisp on the bottom as well as crisp on the top, great dea. I did put a glaze on it warm out of the oven.

I made everything with a change. First I used Hormel apples & cinnamon 20oz tub. Put in 2 tsp brown sugar, 1/2 cup golden raisins and 1/4 cup fresh gourmet honey roasted pecan pieces. Stirred it and put into microwave to heat it up. I then took 3 weight control Quaker instant oatmeal packs and stirred in 3 to 4 tbls  melted unsalted butter. Stirred it. Took about 3/4 of oatmeal mix and used 4 ramekins placing it in a sprayed baking ramekin dish. Pressing down. I then took the apple mixture and evenly placed in each dish to the top. Took the remaining oatmeal mixture and crumbled it over the four ramekins. Placed the dishes on a cookie sheet and Baked at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. Then removed and served hot with a huge tablespoon of whipped topping on top. Yum! So easy!

Great & easy recipe. I use the plastic bag with scant 1/2c sugar & cinnamon and toss the diced apple bits as recommended by Most Helpful Positive Reviewer. Everyone loves it! Especially my 13yr old son with braces -I get apples in him easily this way (& yeah, I know there’s butter and lots o’ sugar too, but better than a store bought granola bar!)  ;-)

This was a wonderful, basic recipe. I did nothing to change it and it was a good comfort dessert on a cold winter's eve. I served it with freshly whipped cream but  had I had vanilla ice cream on hand, that would have been my accompaniment of choice. I will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe if you like the oatmeal mix on the bottom and the top. My husband and I enjoyed this very much.

It's a recipe I come back to every time. Really easy directions and so yummy. I cut the sugar down as it was really sweet. I highly recommend this recipe.

I will face mutiny if I don't make this again!  I let the kids have a taste while it was cooling, then had to keep shooing them away.  I mostly followed the recipe, making minor changes based on what I had on hand (e.g., ran out of brown sugar so supplemented with Truvia brown sugar). Great for those old apples that you're about ready to throw out.

I used all brown sugar, and half the amount of Vietnamese "Saigon" cinnamon.  This is the strongest variety of cinnamon you can buy. I've made this recipe many times but this time the cinnamon flavour and crunchiness of the topping are to die for!

Everyone loved it! The crust on the bottom was the big hit. Did need to add a little more melted butter. 
I did mix the cinnamon/sugar along with a pinch (1/4 tsp) of ground ginger, then gently tossed the apples in the mixture before putting them in the pan

Overall, it turned out ok... 
however, we found it too sweet for our taste, even though I only used 1 cup sugar, total instead of the 1 1/2 cup recommended. 
I also doubled the amount of butter, since the crumbs appeared quite dry, almost dusty. Finally, I added a few dots of butter on the surface before putting the pan in the oven.

Delicious. Love the oat crust on the top and the bottom. Would have given it 5 stars but found it too sweet for me. Will definitely be making again though with a little less sugar.

Was a little sweet so I used half the sugar as well as adding toasted walnuts and baked at 425. i think that using half the sugar resolves the issue of the apple crisp being too dry. Great recipe after my alterations A++

Some reviews mentioned this recipe had turned out too dry.  I cut down by 1/8 cup each on the flour and oatmeal, skipped the white sugar and added a few chopped pecans, nutmeg and vanilla.  I left the brown sugar and butter amounts unchanged.  Still, the result was very dry and there was little cohesion between ingredients.  This might make a good crumble topping for ice cream or a pie, but on its own, I didn't like it.  The recipe needs another source of moisture to hold the ingredients together and to avoid dryness.

Great recipe. I did decrease the sugar after reading the reviews, because I used golden delicious apples, as opposed to a more tart apple.  I sprinkled the top with finely chopped walnuts about midway of cooking.   I also baked it in a cast iron skillet. 
Thanks Dave, for sharing your Grandmother's recipe.

Quickie dessert.  I don't like fussing with pie crust, and this is a popular alternative in my family.  No changes.  All good!  

Update:  After making this dessert twice, I have realized that  when using unsalted butter I must add a little salt.  I will use 1/4 tsp next time I use unsalted butter.

Found ourselves with extra apples on our hands and thought this was a perfect way to get them used.  Followed the recipe exactly, but felt the need to cream a bit of pure vanilla extract with the butter.  We were trilled with the result!  I will be cutting back a bit on both the brown and white sugars next time around, but most people will probably find this to be the right level of sweetness.

This was so quick and easy to make, and everyone loved it! My husband said he would rather have this than apple pie any day. I did reduce the white sugar to approximately 1/3 cup and sprinkled some nutmeg along with the cinnamon over the apples. Delicious, thanks for a great recipe!

Fantastic - even w/my completely forgetting the white sugar and using apple pie filling (21oz. can)! I used an 11x7 glass baking dish; 10 Tbl. butter which helped the crumbling process; and mixed the cinnamon in the oatmeal mixture. Not at all dry. Also added a tsp. each allspice and nutmeg to the mixture.

A wonderful recipe! I mixed the chopped apples with cinnamon and sugar instead of sprinkling them with it. Next time I will use less than 1 cup of each ingredient. I will make it again for sure :)

Good recipe. I added  Toffee bits to the top Oatmeal mixture andused 1 tsp Pumpkin Pie spice and 1 tsp of Cinnamon. I then served it warm with Salted carmel ice cream toppinhg. Yummy! Next time, I would add the Toffee bits about 10 minues before it is done cooking and would probably have to wet them with a little melted butter and smash them down to get them to stick...

I used blackberries instead of apples and coconut sugar in place of all other sugar. Everyone loved it.

I followed the recipe, except I doubled the butter and dry ingredients and we used about 4 apples, galas or fujis, and we sliced the apples so they are chunky.  I also sprinkled a bit more sugar over the apples and squeezed a lemon over them.  This is the 2nd time I'm making it in three days, so that tells you it MUST be pretty good!  My daughter's boyfriend came over after 11 pm to get some to take home.  We cut it into individual portions after it was cooled and wrapped them up for the frig.  It didn't last long and it is relatively easy to make since most ppl who cook have the ingredients on hand all the time.

Very good. Apple choice matters -- choose an apple of combination of apples both sweet and tart. Also, I didn't use the white sugar on top because it seemed like too much sugar. I'm glad because I think 1 cup of brown sugar was too much. I will cut back to 1/2 cup next time.

I can't stop making this! I made 3 in 2 weeks. My hubby & I are addicted! We added the almond  & vanilla extract to melted butter. Added the nutmeg & cinnamon to the mixture instead. Used 4 Granny Smith apples. Used gluten free & oat flour (separate times), both turned out great!

I just made this...disappointed and I wished I would've read the reviews first. You absolutely do not need the added sugar at the end, and I would highly recommend only using half of the flour...or add another stick of butter.

My husband & I loved the apple crisp we used to get in our high school cafeteria.  That was 52 years ago and I have been looking for a similar recipe ever since.  This one is it! Nice and crispy.  Three people tried it and all loved it. Thank you so much for sharing your grandmother's recipe. Delicious!

I used 1/4 cup of white sugar and that was more than enough sugar, I did find the topping dry but as it incorporates with the apples it was no longer dry and after a day in the fridge it's moistened up a bit

Mixed the white suger and cinnamon with the apples, and threw in a handful of chopped rhubarb from the garden. Fantastic! Couldn't have been better...or faster...or easier!

Easy to make and super yummy! Based on the other reviews, I cut down the white sugar -- I filled a 1/4 cup and eye-balled it as I sprinkled it over the apples; I didn't even use the entire 1/4 cup. A few other modifications I made based on personal preference... I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour (I always do when I can), I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla and I didn't peel the apples (this was out of laziness). It came out delicious and perfectly sweet! My husband threatened to eat the entire thing tonight lol.

I loved the topping.  I used a food processor to pulse the dry ingredients (used white sugar because filling has brown) and oats to a finer consistency before drizzling in the melted butter and pulsed a bit more until moist.  Came out so wonderful. .  For the filling, I used the "Apple Pie by Grandma Ople" and added 2 tsp of cinnamon to the filling, as well as used dark brown sugar.  The inside looked like caramel, I got RAVE reviews that it was the best apple dessert they have ever had.  If you are making a very large dish, double the filling. 
This dessert combined with the pie filling was INSANE...

Easy and very tasty. I followed the recipe but I used 3/4 cup of sugar, 3/4 cup of flour and 3/4 cup of oatmeal. I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla powder and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the mix,
100% Delicioso!

SO yummy! I've made other oatmeal apple crisps in the past, but this one was extraordinary! Love dirtying just one bowl, too! I barely used any white sugar, since I wanted the natural taste of the apples to come through. I also recommend Wholesome Sweeteners brand Organic brown sugar- a must have for baking!

It has good flavor, simple recipe but we found it a bit dry. Good reheated with ice cream.

My new "go to" recipe for any fruit crisp.  I made it as the recipe called for, with 2 exceptions, I used 1/4 cup, melted, of a Light Butter (50% butter, 50% canola oil), and 1/4 cup of plain canola oil.  I also used less white sugar, just 1/4 cup, as my apples were sweet. My main goal was to cut cholesterol, but keep the crunchy goodness. My lighter version couldn't have been tastier.  The crisp ingredients go together in a few minutes, and I think would be just as good with canned fruit. helpful hint - mix the crisp with a fork, then finish by mixing with fingertips to incorporate the oils into the flour/oatmeal.

Really great base recipe as is though I'd adjust the amount of white sugar, depending on the sweetness or tartness of the apples. Could easily add other ingredients (raisins, nuts, etc) to suit anyone's personal tastes.

I made this recipe for my family. Instead of using fresh apples, I had a can of apple topping/filling & it didn't take as long to bake. It was great! Nice, easy recipe for a quick desert.

Loved this.  Added 1/2 t vanilla to mix.  Coated peeled, chopped apples in cinnamon and sugar instead of sprinkling on top. Used only a bit of cinnamon and sugar.

Easy and delicious.  The second time I did not use water, as the Granny Smith apples were moist enough.  I added extra apple as, too.

I made this recipe with gala apples in their skins (all I had in the house) and gluten free flour and it was FABULOUS!  Even my husband enjoyed it!  Am clipping this out and adding to my recipe file!  I will definitely make again without skin, but very, very good!

Would have added a photo, but we gobbled it up way too fast!

This may be the BEST apple crisp I've had. Apples caramelized nicely with the sugar and butter. Next time I will double the apple content. One complaint from a family member was that it was chewy (like a candy apple) but I thought it was great! Will be making this again...so easy and oh so gooey good!

Seriously delish!  I will next time however double the apples and maybe cut 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar and use sweeter apples instead. I drizzled a little Carmel sauce over the top, some whipped cream and cinnamon on top. It was to die for!  Thanks for great recipe

I had high expectations for this since it was so highly rated. But I was disappointed with the final result. I tweaked the recipe. I used whole wheat flour, added nutmeg, extra cinnamon to the apples and cut down on the white sugar (only used 1/4 cup). It was so dry. The mixture did not clump together like crumbles normally do. And it was very sweet, although I did not add all the white sugar. Overall I enjoyed the taste but not the texture. I will make this again but next time I will boil the apples in nutmeg, a little sugar and cinnamon so that they won't be so dry and will also use less flour and oatmeal so that the crumble mixture won't be so dry.

This is NOM NOM good! I took advice from others and reduced the flour & oats to 2/3 c and the brown sugar to 2/3 c and the white sugar to 1/4 c. It is plenty sweet this way, and I am one that likes sweets. I also added dried cranberries. I accidentally browned the butter just a little while on the stove and I swear it makes it taste so good. This recipe is EASY to make and super yummy. The only problem is that I seriously want to eat the entire thing!

I did not use the 1/2 cup of white sugar and would add a dash of salt next time I make this (which at the rate it's disappearing, will be tomorrow).

Fantastic! I tried my best to stick to the recipe, except that I used about 7 apples and 2 cups of fresh raspberries. I also squeezed some lemon juice over the fruit and added a lot of extra cinnamon, some nutmeg, and allspice. I also added cinnamon to the crisp part along with some salt. The flavors were out of this world.

I made this apple crisp for the first time today, and both my husband and I loved it. The only thing I changed was I cut the white sugar to 1/4 cup, as I didn't want it too sweet. We waited for it to cool a little, then we just had to try a piece. I'll be making this again. THANKS!

I made this today for a family gathering.  Instead of using  a 7" square pan, I doubled my recipe and used a 9x13" pan.  I gave it an extra 10 minutes?It really is a very tasty dessert.  Everyone like it a lot!

This was my first time trying this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except I made enough for a 9x13 pan. It turned out too dry and crumbly. The oatmeal mixture turned out fine but there was no liquid with the apples so they were dry. I will try adding some apple juice to hopefully save it. I'm definitely not making this again. I made the Apple Crisp II that is on this website before and it tasted great. But I thought I would try a different recipe this time to compare and wished I would have made that one instead.

Absolutely perfect!! My favorite apple crisp recipe ever. I add a bit of cinnamon to the oatmeal mix and sprinkle only half the amount of sugar and cinnamon on the apples.

Best apple crisp and super easy! 20 min prep?- only if it takes 15 to peel the apples! And easy to remember- make it once & you know it.

We loved it. Its nice and light. Not too greasy. I used only a tablespoon of white sugar over apples and still did not miss the sweetness. My 15 year old also loved it. I also like the fact that it takes much less preparation time. Thanks for sharing.

Had this for a group of 8  They loved it. I doubled the recipe and we did not find it too sweet.  I mixed the apples in a bowl with combined sugar and cinnamon- it is a little heavy on the cinnamon side I thought but my guests loved it.
Just made it again for a fall evening treat.

Very dry.  Most other recipes (e.g. Apple Crisp II) call for a ratio of 4::1 or 5::1 of apples to combined oats and flour.  This recipe calls for a ratio of 1.5::1.  No wonder it is dry.  I also cut the brown sugar in half, based on other comments, and got a good level of sweetness.  Do not overcook, as it will be VERY crisp.  Plan to serve this with ice cream or cream.

This is great! I added a tad more white sugar to the apples. I may try eliminating the bottom crust next time, so I can taste the apples a little more and some the crust it stuck to the bottom. It still tasted great though!

This is by far the easiest apple crisp recipe I have ever found.  So much flavor for just seven ingredients!  My nine year old son loves apple desserts and begs for this one on a regular basis.  The only thing I do a bit different, from the instructions, is I toss the apple with the sugar mixture to evenly coat them.  I have it in the oven right now!!!  Can't wait until my son gets home from school.

Excellent!  I suspect those who thought it was dry confused 1/2 cup of butter with 1/2 stick of butter because with 1/2 cup of butter it was anything but dry, and with vanilla ice cream it was a perfect way to use up an excess of apples.

Too sweet and dry.  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 cup of flour and 1/4 cup sugar and it was still too sweet and too dry.  It's missing something.

I tried this recipe this morning. Cut down the sugar a bit and it turned out really well. So quick and simple to put together and it held well also, didn't fall apart. I will definitely use it again.

Husband raved about this recipe.  Due to his food sensitivities, I used coconut sugar (blonde for white sugar and regular for brown sugar).  Came out great.

A few mistakes in ingredients first it doesn't say if you pack the brown sugar or not. I would say no because I did and mind was too sweet. Second it doesn't say how much sugar to mix with cinnamon. Overall good will make again with the adjustments.  Also it was dry it might need a little water to make it more moist probably 1/2 to 3/4 cups of water.

Turned out great however once I sprinkled the apples with sugar I realised there was too much so I sprinkled some on the crumb mixture as well & still had some leftover sugar/cinnamon. I also added in pears & increased the recipe to even it out. Mine wasn't as firm on top either but it still tasted wonderful!

The recipe had a good flavor.  However, I felt that it had way too much dough and not enough apples.  If I make it again, I would double the apples, thus decreasing the dough by half.

Best apple crisp recipe we've tried.  We are huge fans of apple crisp, and this beats them all.  I reduced the amount of sugar from 1/2 c. white sugar down to 1 T. Pyure erythritol/stevia blend. It was perfectly sweet. Also added more cinnamon to the crisp blend in addition to sprinkling cinnamon over the apples. Perfect.

Love this, thanks for sharing! Have made it about 5 times in the last few months with little regard for amounts/measurements and it ALWAYS turns out so great. The recipe is very forgiving, very basic (great for adding your own twists) and very easy! Hooray for fewer dishes to wash!

This was terrible. I added an additional 1/2 stick of butter because it was simply too dry to "crumble" in the pan. I cooked it the recommended amount of time, and then an additional ten minutes after it cooled because the topping had this awful uncooked flour taste. Will not make again. Complete waste of apples.

As others have said, this recipe lacks water but tastes very good. I added a cup of water & it turned out like an apple "oat cake" rather than a crumble. LIke others, I just blended the sugar and spice all through in one bowl. Great with homemade whisky caramel syrup on top & ice cream. But I I can see how it would be much drier than expected if no liquid is added. Probably depends on the  oats used, too. Next time, I'll probably add 2 cups water or maybe apple juice & put the oat mix on top instead of mixing through.

Delicious and easy! Only thing I added extra melted butter to the top of crisp with 10 minutes remaining to cook.  Melted about 1/2 cup of butter and poured over top.

This recipe is extremely dangerous for my waistline...I've made it about 4 times since I discovered it about 6 weeks ago.  Super easy and really delicious.  You've got to try it...

needs less melted butter for crisp. The crisp should be more crumbly. This came out mushy. But other than that it tastes great

I have made this many times and this time I changed things up some.  I didn’t have any apples so I used strawberry banana mixture. Not bad and I added some ground hazelnuts.

I had to add about 1/2 cup of water after the suggested baking time to get the apples done.  I continued baking for about 10 more minutes.  After that it was great.

I mistakenly mixed up where the brown sugar and the white sugar went, but this recipe was super forgiving! It was exactly what I was looking for - something relatively easy with ingredients I had in house. I cut down on some of the sugar and some of the butter, but it was DELICIOUS. Made the entire house smell of cinnamon! I've eaten considerably more than my share, but it's too good not to keep going back for seconds. Definitely saved for future use! Thanks so much!

This crisp was REALLY dry and powdery, leaving the oats feeling completely raw. I used Gala apples and found this too sweet to eat (maybe Granny Smith would have been a better apple choice).  Even my kids couldn't eat it. While I think some modifying could make this recipe awesome, as it is written, I have to give it a one-star rating.

Simple yet divine all at the same time. However the only thing i did differently was coat the apple with the cinnamon sugar in a bowl before I put it in the pan. Other then that this is a simple easy and cheap dessert. Have made twice with great reviews and will make again!

I really like this recipe! Its very simple, with few ingredients. The only thing I do different is omitting the white sugar. I find the crisp is sweet enough and don't need the extra sugar. I make this with my kids (3 and 5 yr old) all the time because of its simplicity. Thanks for a great recipe!

this was PHE-NOM-EN-AL! i've now made this twice in 1 week. The cooking time was off a bit. This recipe called for 45 minutes, but we ended up baking for 1 hour and 15 min and it was DEE-LISH. Took out the cinnamon the 2nd time around and added sugar to the top of the mixture and it was even crispier. Mmmmmm. Absolutely will continue to make this over and over and over.

I have to say that having made apple crisp for many years - this is the absolute best ever.  This recipe takes minutes to put together and is delicious, perfect - doubled it and had 4 ask for the recipe after a couple of bites.

Awesome!  Very sweet.  I used Spenda in place of the white sugar.  I'm wondering if it was too dry for others because they cut the apples too large?  Mine was perfect and I cut the apples in 1/4" slices.

YUMMY!  SOOOO Good!  The cinammon/sugar carmalized a bit in the bottom, the topping was crunchy, buttery, and delicious, and my 15 month old kept stealing my spoon!  A hit all around!

Great recipe!!! My husband loved it. I added a little vanilla and used about a 1/2 cup more apples. I also tossed the apples with sugar and cinnamon in a bowl to make sure they were coated nicely. I served it up with vanilla bean ice cream.

I don't recall a time that I've ever used a recipe for apple crisp; I usually just wing it and it turns out fabulously.  This time I decided to try a recipe and it turned out poorly.  I read the reviews beforehand and noted that some people found the recipe dry.  I adjusted accordingly, but mine was still terribly dry.  The apples didn't get bubbly and smushy like usual, either.  I cannot be sure what it is or why, but something just isn't right with this recipe.  I will stick to "winging it" in the future.

Mmmm, so good and a big hit with my family!! I used 2 whole apples, which was almost 4 cups worth, then put the cinnamon & sugar in a ziploc bag and added the apple slices and shook to coat. After putting down the first layer of crumb mixture and the apples, I squeezed about a 1/2 of a small lemon over the apples before adding the crumb topping. I also increased the cinnamon to 1/2 Tbs. in the apple mix and 2 tsp. in the crumb mixture. Delicious!!

I rated 3 stars for the recipe as is. I found that there was too much oat topping and not enough apples. Easy fix at least...add more apples or make less oat topping! Flavors were really good. Will make again

Delishous!  The first time I made this exactly as the reciepe stated and it was pretty good.  The second time I did change this but only by adding twice as many apples. I like more apples to my crust and it turned out delish!  Will for sure make again!

I love this. I make it all the time. I adjusted the flour and only used 1/2 cup. It came out great. I use granny smith apples so that it isn't too sweet and I once added nutmeg and pecans to it for something different,

This was an awesome crisp.  The only thing I did differently (and this of course is personal preference) is added more apple to help cut the sweetness a little based upon some previous reviews.  I increased the apple to 4 - 4 1/2 cups instead of the called 3 but again this is a personal prefernce.  I served with Ice cream, everyone loved it!  Thanks

DELISH! I put about double the number of apples to make a really fruity crisp. I also use pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon for some extra flavour.

I used this recipe but added some frozen mixed berries and a pinch of nutmeg as well.  My boyfriend said it was the best apple crisp he's ever had and he doesn't ever want to have it any other way!  I agree, it was deliscious!

Best apple crisp I have ever had in my life, I was worried that it wouldn't be that good but it was so so good, I made it in a small deep oven dish, so it was thick and gooey and DELICIOUS! I highly recommend this to anyone who has a sweet tooth!

I tried this recipe tonight, I actually thought it was pretty darn good! some of the apples did dry out, but i use more apples than the recipe called for, so i figure that's probably why :)

This is quick, easy, and delicious basic apple oat crisp recipe.   The changes I made were to sprinkle lemon juice on the apples and add a little water. I used about a quarter of a cup less brown sugar, as I don't like as much sweetness, and I used whole wheat flour.  I also didn't melt the butter but worked it into the dry mixture with my hands. I put this mixture on the top, rather than at the top and bottom of this dish.  This recipe is one I will try again.

I love this recipe. I used granny smith apples and pears. It was a tiny bit sweet but that's ok. I did what others did and rolled the apples and pears in the sugar and cinnamon. I did add a little water so it wouldn't be dry. Thanks for sharing

This is a super easy and YUMMY recipe!  I did not put any "crisp" on the bottom because I was afraid it would be soggy.  And I left out the white sugar since I used sweet apples.  It turned out perfect and oh so delicious!

Everyone loved it, so good fresh out of the oven with some vanilla ice cream on top.  I think I might add a dash of orange juice to the apples to get them to be a tad more juicy.

VERY yummy! I put all of the crumb mixture on the top for a nice thick top layer. It was amazing! I did add a little water to the apples and dotted the top with butter before baking after some of the reviews said it was dry. I also only used 1//4 cup of sugar. The only thing I'd do differently is to peel the apples as I left the peels on and didn't care for that. This is definitely my "go to" recipe for apple crisp!!!

Wonderful and delicious. I just cut the sugar a bit as I was using Honeycrisp apples. I followed the advice of another reviewer, and mixed the white sugar and cinnamon with the apples before putting in the baking dish. Baked 40 min. resulting in a still moist topping with a slight crunch. Will probably try baking just a little longer next time.

Not being a great cook, this recipe was so easy to follow and tasted amazing, its very easy to customise to however you want (I added probably too much cinnamon, but I LOVED it!) My husband is also a fan.I didnt find it dry at all.  Lovely.

Ridiculously good.  You don't have to use all the white sugar.  I used granny smith apples and only used a little more than 1/4 C.  I will only use 1/4 or less next time.  So delicious and easy though!  What more could you ask for.  Also, Vanilla ice cream or Cool Whip is a must!!!

This was ok for me, a bit too sugary for my taste.  I prefer mine with more oats.  There's another recipe on this site that  I love, Apple Crisp IV by Rhonda that has the ratios I love and get rave reviews when bringing it to pot lucks.

This was sooo good! I glazed some honey over the cinnamon and sugar, and on the top crumb mixture I glazed it with a bit of melted butter and even added some milk to prevent dryness. Turned out delicious!

I prefer a thick layer of crisp on top, so I skip adding half of the crumble mixture in the bottom of the pan. It turns out great that way. We have taken this for pot-luck dinners and always return home with an empty pan.

I've made apple crisp before, but this one is much better. It did come out slightly drier than the one I've previously made, but it didn't detract from the taste. The oats add just the right touch. My husband keeps asking me when I'll make it again.

Very good.  The first time we made it, we kept to the recipe exactly.  We did feel that the brown sugar was a little too much.  We cut it back a bit (reduced it by 1/4 cup) the next time and it was great!

This is an excellent base recipe.  I've used it with fresh peaches, and fresh pears too.  I would suggest much less white sugar.  The fruits have enough sweetness that they don't need the white sugar.  Also I add a little nutmeg to the crumbly topping.  It's an great way to use up fresh fruit, and smells heavenly while it's baking.

I made this for Christmas and forgot to review it. It is really amazing. Everyone loved it and finished it in one sitting, and that is amazing because they had just finished a very heavy lunch. The oats give a very nice crunch.

I've made this twice now--once as written (subbing gluten-free flour, though) and once decreasing the flour and sugars to just shy of the amounts called for. Both results were fantastic! We'll make this a lot this winter.

Pretty good. I found there was way too much topping for the amount of apples but it was a very nice flavour. I cooked it for about 50 minutes because we like the apples softer and it turned out very delicious.. Deffinatley a keeper!

This is ridiculously delicious. I put sugar on everything, but I still thought this was really sweet even without the 1/2 cup of sugar. I also added a splash of vanilla. I don't know if it actually did anything, but I saw it in some other recipes, so I thought I'd try it. Fantastic!

This was good.  I wasn't fond of the texture, though, which is why I'm giving this a 4 instead of 5.  I topped it with vanilla ice cream.

This was a lovely and simple recipe!  I actually forgot to add the white sugar prior to baking and I'm glad I did!  It was plenty sweet with just the brown sugar in the topping/base, and I even used a tarter baking apple.  I did add a little nutmeg as well, which was nice... Also, it ended up a tiny bit dry, probably because of the apples or something, or maybe because I forgot the white sugar, but regardless, it still tasted pretty great!

Used the "crumb" mixture only on the top after spraying the pan.  Delicious!  Used only a quarter cup of white sugar with the apple (golden delicious and another tart varietal that I can't remember!) and cinnamon (which I mixed in the pan before topping).  Also, ended up adding a bit of extra butter, even after reducing the flour and oatmeal by 25%.  Needed the full 40 mins of cook time but well worth the wait.  Didn't even need ice cream!

Love this recipe!  Followed advice of another reviewer and shook my apples in the cinnamon and sugar mixture, works great!  I also dabbed a bit more butter on top before baking.  I didn't measure my cinnamon, so I am sure I used more, just love cinnamon so wonderful flavor to me.  The guests I served it to agreed.  They like it so well I gave them the copy of the recipe I had printed off.  Now my "goto" apple crisp recipe.  Maybe we will have apple crisp for Thanksgiving!  Easy and so goooooood!

This recipe is perfect as is. Sometimes I add dried cranberries or raisins to the apples in a Ziploc bag and shake them up with the sugar and cinnamon. Or if it's just the apples, sometimes I add a little nutmeg.

Very good, we really enjoyed this apple crisp. I used only 1/3 cup of sugar over the apples and it was enough for our taste. Next time I will bake it less than 45 minutes, my apples were all melted and I prefer nice and firm.

My family and I really love this.  For the past 3 Sundays I have made it for them.  This is soooo good with vanilla ice cream! I too, thought it was a little dry.  I did use whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose white and less sugar.  I tasted my apples and they were super sweet so I was actually able to cut the sugar in half and not feel too bad about putting ice cream on top.

I liked this recipe a lot seeing as though it was very easy and using only one bowl is always a plus in my house. I should have listened to other reviews because it did turn out dry although we combined ours with vanilla icecream and it was just fine! Deffinatly will make this again, although I may follow another reviewer's comment about adding butter and less oats and flour. Thanks so much for sharing!

This was really easy and turned out great. I doubled the recipe but didn't measure the apples, and baked it in a 7-1/2 x 11 inch pan. I used almost a half a peck of Jonathan's and mounded the apples up.  They baked down and were just fine.  I made it for a small family gathering, and everyone loved it.   Thanks for such a yummy recipe!

Followed recipe almost exactly (but doubled the first time and made recipe plus half the second time). The only thing I did different was that I tossed the apples in the cinnamon sugar mixture. It was awesome, everyone loved it, it was a big hit. I had taken my son apple picking so I don't even know what kind of apples I used - they were all mixed up.

I cut out brown sugar, used less flour (approx. 1/3 cup) and butter (approx. 1/4 cup)!!!  Added 1 TBS of molasses and reduced white sugar to 1/2 cup.  Threw in some walnuts too.  Alternated layers of oatmeal mixture with apples.    Molasses was a great addition, kept it moist too.  And it was excellent, perfect alone, with ice cream or yogurt.

It was amazing, but a little on the sweet side. I'm going to make it again soon, but will cut the ingredients in half for the crunchy oat crust topping by only putting the topping on the top instead of bottom and top.

Wonderful late night fall-time snack! I didn't have any brown sugar so I used 1/2 cup white sugar along with close to 1/4 cup Maple Syrup. It was NOT too sweet this way! Just perfect!  I made a crunchy strudel-type top to make the top crunchy! (1/4 stick soft butter, few shakes cinnamon, enough oatmeal to make it crumbly when mixed with a fork!)  The only thing that I would like differently about this recipie was if it were a bit more crunchy, but that's personal preference!

This was really good.  I ommitted the white sugar part, as my apples were pretty sweet.  I also added cardamom, cloves and allspice.  This was a really yummy recipe.

Came out fragrant, delicious, hot and bubbly. Quick and easy to prepare. Used 6 Red Delicious Apples and split into 3 small dishes. I enjoyed the baked crisp top more so than bottom moist crumb layer. Will do again whenever I have apples handy. Hard to mess this one up.

I didn't get to try this recipe because I made it for friends who recently had a baby.  They described it as "amazing" so I thought I'd give it a five star rating.  I put some of the brown sugar/oatmeal mixture on bottom and then mixed the remaining with the apples.  I used a little less white sugar than called for and it sounds like it turned out very well!

Delicious Recipe! We normally go with the box to make apple crisp and they were all out of the packeged kind. I figured that there must be a good recipe here and I tell you, I hit the Jack Pot! My husband and kids loved it and so did I... Thank you for sharing.

This was rather tasty- followed general recipe but added some ground flax seed to oatmeal mixture and also threw in some craisins with apples.  Had to add some extra butter and cook a little longer but overall was pleased with outcome.  DD loved it with ice cream.

I really liked this recipe! I only added about 3 Tablespoons of white sugar to the apples, and still found it to be a little sweet. Overall I would make it again and adjust the sweetness to how I like it. I loved how the topping was used as a "crust" too!

The apples were kind of dry, and overall it was too sweet (even when I added 1/4C white sugar to the apples). Perhaps next time I will try adding lemon juice? Crumble was good, will try cutting back on the sugar in it as well.

This turned out wonderfully!  I follwed others advice-less flour/oats/white sugar...  I think next time I'll use whole wheat flour, more apples and even less white sugar - should turn out even better (and healthier) =)

Yummy! Cut down on the sugars as I always do with baking and served it with a big dab of real whipped cream.  To those who would complain about it being too dry, refer to an apple chart, not all apples are suitable for baking.

This recipe was great. I used 4 breaburn apples and a little less flour, oats, and sugar. My family loved it!

I used 3/4 c brown sugar based on others who said it was too sweet; used 4 large apples and combined them with cinn & sugar (add pecans or walnuts!).  Turned out perfectly; I'm going for seconds right now!

Very good recipe!  It was a little too sweet for my taste so next time I think I'll leave out the sugar.  The apples themselves should be plenty sweet.  But it was very good and super easy to throw together!

I used less sugar for the topping and margarine instead of butter.  It had a good flavor.  Topped it with some reddi whip.

Can I just say AMAZING!!! This recipe was absolutely delicious. I followed it exactly except I took the white sugar and cinnamon and coated the apples in it instead of just topping them. It was perfect severed with ice cream and/or whipped cream.

Like others have done, I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and it was still too sweet. I prefer to have more fruit and less crust, so this recipe is not my favourite apple crisp.

This was delicious, even though it didn't quite turn out as planned. I used sliced honeycrisp apples and my baking dish was probably a bit too large. I ended up with the apples on the bottom and the oatmeal mixture on the top, but it was still yummy warm from the oven with ice cream on top. (I didn't have vanilla, so I used pumpkin ice cream and it tasted like Autumn In A Bowl!)

A very sorry recipe!!! Thought I could make  it at the last minute since it had few ingredients but it turned out to be extremely dry. I added a little bit of fruit juice to moisten the dish.

I cut down on the sugar and still felt that it was too sweet. Overall it turned out nice and crispy; pretty good cinnamon taste. It definitely made the house smell insanely good.

I made this in the texan muffin tins as another reviewer mentioned, used 2 T vanilla syrup instead of the cinnamon sugar in the apples and only 2/3 c brown sugar.  Really great.

Liked how the crust was on the bottom and the top.  It was not real moist, but, it probably was the type of apple I used--next time I will use a different apple.  Actually tasted better the next day.  Easy & Good.

I have tried many apple crisp recipes and prefer this one.  Admittedly, it is on the sweet side, but I like that.  I used a 9X9 pan and added 1/3 of everything, except for the cinnamon and white sugar which I left as is.    Delicious!

I would have given this a 5 but for some reason my oatmeal crisp part turned into more of a sticky glump of a pile rather than a crispy clump.  The overall flavor was fabulous.  I used red delicious apples.  Thanks I will try it again.

Fantastic recipe, reminds me of one I used to love as a kid. I served with a choice of custard or vanilla ice cream - both seem to work really well with this.

The taste of this was pretty good but I wished it wasn't so dry. Maybe it was because I used splenda instead of white sugar but the apples were really dry and I like to have some syrup in the apple mixture.

Followed exactly and loved it - actally tasted like a carmel apple when heated and served w/ a scoop of ice cream.  Used yellow delicious - not exactly meant for cooking, but getting too soft to eat, and it was fine. Thanks for a yummy recipe!

This was good. I will probably make it again. However it's also very dry tasting. Definately have a large glass of milk waiting when you are ready to eat this.

This was very good.  I substituted Splenda for the white sugar but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I would make this again.

Great!  I keep forgetting to add the sugar and cinnamon at the right time, but it is still great.  kids get in the way of paying close attention to a recipe

We cut out the white sugar, since we like desserts to be less sweet.  Nice flavor, but somewhat too dry for our tastes--will try more butter/more apples, and less crumb mixture next time.

Very good recipe, but I reduced the brown sugar in the topping to 1/2 cup and it was plenty sweet.

I loved this and it very easy and fast to make. Unfortunately, my husband didn't care much for it, but he doesn't care for oatmeal. So I guess, I'll have to rate it a four.
