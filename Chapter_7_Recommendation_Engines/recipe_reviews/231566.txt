I first tried this recipe a month or so ago before it became a published recipe and fell in love with the idea of this fantastic bread idea. I followed the basic bread making recipe and found no need to change up anything, except in how I added the Siracha and the cheese. I love the taste of Siracha and find that most often when I add it to something and it gets mixed in, it loses some of its heat and some of its flavor. I felt that the only way to really showcase it was to pat out the dough and apply the Siracha on the rolled out dough, then add the cheese on top of it, and roll it up Jelly roll style. I brushed the top with an egg wash and sprinkled a little bit of Kosher salt on top of it and baked it that way. The smell was out of this world not to mention how it tasted. I could hardly wait for it to cool down enough that I could slice into it. I've since made it twice and it's gone in a matter of hours. This is an incredibly easy, and show stopping yummy bread.

This recipe made some grrreat rolls! We really liked these, nice cheesy flavor with a bite.  Beautiful color and they smelled wonderful baking.   I use the rolls for a chicken cutlet sandwich made with broccoli rabe (cooked with olive oil, garlic and crushed red pepper), provolone and long hot peppers.  I used lactose free milk and Cabot brand cheese that is lactose free.  An amazing roll I will be making again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  I don't have a mixer other than my handmixer, and I don't have a bread machine, so this was just up to me!  I used the handmixer up until I was ready to add the last cup of flour, and it worked out just fine.  I had to use buttermilk (all I had on hand) but otherwise followed the recipe.  Maybe because of the buttermilk, I only had to add about a tablespoon more of that last half cup of flour.  It didn't take very long to knead this by hand, and it was very easy to handle.  I baked it for half an hour, and the internal temperature according to my Thermapen was 196 degrees.  So far all I've done is toasted a piece with butter, but it will make such delicious sandwiches!  Thanks so very much, BigShotsMom!

Great bread!  I don't know which ingredient made it so soft, but I was very pleased with the soft texture.  I did add vital wheat gluten, but my bread doesn't usually turn out this soft even when I do that!  I threw all the ingredients in my bread machine and set the dough cycle.  When it was done I baked in a loaf dish.  Boy did the dough rise, and yet it was sturdy enough that it didn't fall.  I loved the texture, the flavor of the cheddar and sriracha, everything.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

One of the easiest bread recipes I have ever made. I mixed this using my KA mixer. I followed Marianne's idea and used buttermilk and had about 1/2 cup of  bread flour left. I used the Sriracha HOT chili sauce - Tuong OT Sriracha by Huy Fong Foods, Inc. and believe me, the more you eat - the hotter it gets :) BigShotsMom, thank you for sharing your delicious and addictive recipe.

Made these into rolls for dinner. My family loves sriracha on pretty much anything so I had a crowd in the kitchen for homemade bread that included it. They were loved by all even my picky youngest who isn't a bit interested in heat. You really get no heat just the wonderful flavor of the hot sauce and something about baking it really brings out the garlic flavor which I don't usually taste over the heat. Wonderful!!

Wow, is this a delicious bread!  You don't really notice the tang of the Sriracha until after you have swallowed the bread.  It has a really nice taste that pairs well with soups.  I put all the ingredients in the bread machine on manual and formed a loaf when the dough was ready.  My DH also enjoyed this bread toasted for his breakfast.  A bread recipe worth repeating.  Thanks BigShotsMom for sharing!

Delicious! I threw all of the ingredients into the bread machine and let it go. When the cycle was done, I deflated the bread and braided it, place it on a baking sheet and let it rise. This smelled soooo good while baking, and it is also very beautiful. Not too spicy, just enough background heat...Great flavor. This is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was excellent.  Could actually taste the cheese and there was just a little bite from the Sriracha.  Wouldn't change a thing except to make more next time.

This is a delicious bread!  The heat was just right - there, but not too strong.  It was gorgeous too.  I didn't have time for the second rise (in the pan), but it still rose beautifully while baking.  A keeper for sure.

This bread was awesome!!  I used my bread machine (mine is wet first then dry).  I proofed my yeast 10 min.  I warmed my milk, hot sauce and a TB butter a tad. I accidently added the butter into the bread the first time and it worked out really well.  I add both to machine, then add beaten egg.  Flour mixture added on top.  I also only used all bread flour as that was all I had.  I did a full cycle, adding cheese when it beeped.  The texture was amazing with just a hint of heat.  I had some leftover meatloaf, and cut a thin slice and made a meatloaf and grilled cheese sandwich with a side of sriracha ketchup dipping sauce.  Heaven.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This bread is SO good!  You can taste both the cheese and sriracha, but neither overpowers. You'll have a slight after-taste of heat and may wonder what's doing it, till you remember there's hot sauce in the bread. I might even try some other cheese flavor...Wonder how Parmesan would be? Bleu? Hmmm...I do use the bread machine on "dough" for this, so it's less mess & bowls.

This is a great recipe!  I made it on a rainy day so it took a bit more flour than called for but use your judgment.  Just don't over flour, the texture clearly relies on a slightly sticky dough as the author points out.  It also took a long time to rise because it was colder in the house.  The cheese flavor isn't strong but it's present and the Sriracha has just the right kick.  Plus it's a pretty color.  Worth making for sure!

Turned out great. Used a couple tricks I learned from watching cooks country. Specially cutting the cheese in cubes so it doesn't all melt away and putting it in cake pan to do final rise. Used the hot sauce in the dough for the pretty color but Thai bird chilies inside so it would stray spicy. Worked great.

This makes a very savoury loaf  I did coil it before baking. 
The bread is extremely light and would be a great share and tear bread at a buffet.
I used the down sizer for 6 servings. ..this equalled about 11 oz of flour.
very nice!...thank you.

I left out the cheese added a quarter cup of honey. I made dinner rolls. I put 3 balls about 2 tablespoons each into a muffin pan and baked as directed. Mine took 22 minutes. They are exactly what the potato soup needed! This recipe is delicious.

Sorry, we did not like this at all.  I made mine in the bread machine and made into rolls.  They smelled AMAZING coming out of the oven, but the taste was blah.  They were very light and fluffy.  Very disappointed.  I was soooo excited when I found this recipe.

This was very good! I was tempted to add oil, but I didn't. The bread is SO soft; you don't need any. This rose very high for me--almost too high. It didn't need a whole hour to rise, but that may be due to how warm it is in the house right now. Even though it rose high, it didn't lose it's shape at all. DH loves hot and spicy, and he said he didn't feel the heat in it at all, but he still liked the cheesy taste. I could definitely feel the heat, but it wasn't overpowering. I toasted a slice and had it with my egg for breakfast the next morning.
