Having made kebobs for my work for customers, I have to add a few hints---First put the vegetables on a separate kebob than the meat as they don't cook in the same time. (Meat needs a longer cook time and must be 165 degrees to be properly done)
Also using the bullion cubes as seasoning is raising the salt level of the finished product. You could avoid this by using liquid broth and marinate everything (meat separate from vegetables) prior to putting on kebobs.
Kebobs are a great cooking tool but preparation is a little work, a great way to get the family involved in preparation

Thanks for this great recipe. This will be in our family's steady rotation.  

Tweaks I made:
Used chicken thighs rather than breasts. Doubled the garlic and pineapple amounts. Added s&p and finely chopped fresh parsley at grill time. Replaced bouillon cubes with 1 cup of bone broth.

Delicious! Followed the recipe to a "T" and wouldn't change a thing. We served ours with long grain rice and an ice cold Bud Light Lime! Yum!

This is delicious. I used a little extra red pepper flake for some extra heat. Definitely a summer favorite in our household. You could add some more veggies. I'll probably use green and red peppers next time.

This recipe was so easy, different and amazing! My family tore it up! I served it with brown rice that I flavored with some of the chicken bouillon.  SO GOOD!

Excellent base recipe. Next time I’ll substitute pineapple juice for lemon juice, add more peppers/onions/pineapple and marinate over night. And there will definitely be a next time! Thanks for posting.

Very good. The other half of the marinade is a very enjoyable glaze. I didn’t find the chicken to be seasoned so I added about 1 teaspoon (badia) adobo seasoning & about 2 tablespoons Chief green seasoning then put it in the fridge for the recipe’s desired time.

Good flavor but the coconut flavor was lost...didn't really notice it. Easy to prepare and will definitely make it again but just tweak the ingredients a little

I marinated it for 6 hours.  Maybe I should have marinated it for over night.  May be pineapple juice would make it more flavorful than lemon juice.

Simply terrific! I used a zip-type bag to marinate the chicken and other ingredients, and I did add a yellow bell pepper. I discovered I had no lemon juice, so I used lime instead. The whole family savored every bite. Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious! I used light cream of coconut. The kabobs turned out fantastic!
