mmmm mmmm mmmm mmmmmmmmm  yum it's great! I never even bother with the orange zest or liqueur. Marshmallow fluff and cream cheese blended is THE best dip for strawberries. I always get raves with this.

This dip is incredible!  I served it with slices of green and red apples and it was gone within minutes.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  From now on, I am definitely bringing this one to parties.

Fast, easy, and delicous is what I was looking for in this dish.  I will continue to server this as my fruit dip but maybe add some walnuts to it next time for a crunch effect.

I served this at a baby shower with fruit kabobs along with chocolate dip.  Hardly anyone touched the chocolate...this recipe was all gone and I even made a double batch.  
I did use OJ instead of liqueor and it tasted wonderful

I liked it but the folks at the party I brought it too thought it had to much of an alcohol taste.  If I make it again, I will put way less than an ounce of alcohol and supplement with orange juice as another poster mentioned.

Very easy to make, tastes great! I used the suggested orange juice in place of the orange liqueur.  Sliced up apples dipped in this were delicious!  It was a huge success! I will definitely be using this recipe many times in the future.

This is a great dip.  I usually use 1 tablespoon of frozen orange juice concentrate instead of liqueur and zest, which works really well.

I always use strawberry cream cheese during strawberry season.  I still use a bit or orange juice - it helps with the consistency, too.  And everybody loves it.

This was delicious!  I made it for a snack after a tennis match and it got all eaten up (even though it rained, and the match was cancelled...I REALLY enjoyed it!!) ;-)  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe! Made this on thanksgiving as a pre-meal snack and everyone ate it up! I substituted orange extract for the orange zest. Yum. I will probably make this next time there's a potluck at work.

I omit the orange zest and liqueur and use strawberry cream cheese for a strawberry flavored dip.  I also stir in a spoonful of cool-whip which tastes great!

I made the dip with orange juice instead of the liqueur because that is what I had in the house.  It was a nice compliment to the sweet fruit.  I personally would have given it a three star rating, but, my husband really liked it and gave it a five.
