I'm the author of this recipe and just made this again tonight, to celebrate.  Yes, the sauce can be doubled, especially if you'd like the sauce on the rice.    As far as egg/cheese/sugar mixture goes.  I've never had a problem with it sticking to the flour-dredged chicken.  Not sure why it didn't work for Lavendertatoo.  I figure if it worked for Julia Child, it should work for anyone.

I thought this was a very good version on chicken french. Living in Rochester there are slight variations to the recipe and taste but for the most part this hit the nail on the head. I would suggest using a white wine sauce if you want a lighter sauce. Also possibly doubling up on the sauce since there isn't alot. Next time I make this, I will be sure to make a double amount of sauce. Several people also take fresh lemons, slice them and saute them in the sauce as well for a more Lemony flavor.  Overall, Great recipe.  I also suggest pounding out the chicken. the thinner it is, the better for this recipe. At least in my opinion!

Very good!  I live in Rochester and have ordered chicken french all over the city for years. I doubled the sauce, and used a bit more sherry and butter, that's just my taste. I also used chicken stock because I didn't have base.  I deglazed the pan with the sherry before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients.  I also like the chicken on the thin side, so I pounded it thin. Maybe the reviewer who had the problem with the coating didn't dust off all the extra flour?  Great recipe, do you have one for greens and beans Roc style?!

Complete disaster. The flour/egg combination fell off of the chicken as it cooked. So basically we got plain chicken with browned omelette. I thought something seemed off when the recipe called for putting the flour on first and then putting on the egg mixture. I should have followed my gut instinct and done it the other way around. I will never make this again.

I LOVE Chicken French Live in Rochester and have tried it all over town. This is a very good Recipe. I myself Mix the Lemon Juice and sugar together and sweeten to taste. I cook the chicken as done in first part. For second part I use a Riesling or Chardonnay instead of Dry Sherry.I use a good quality Box wine.( Always nice to have some around for drinking.) Heat on Low/med heat. Add chicken to pan. Then add the Wine next Lemon/sugar mix. Next add good amount of Butter on top Cover When butter is melted Dish is done! Excellent Enjoy!

The only difference I made was to season the chicken directly instead of mixing in with the flour. This was a quick meal and it was delicious! My husband kept saying over and over that "this recipes is a hit!" Thanks!

Just like the restaurant!  Was surprised at how nicely the egg batter stayed on the chicken breasts.  I doubled the sauce, reduced the butter by half (I like this dish a bit on the lemony side) and added flour to thicken it a bit.  Served over fettuccini.  Delicious!

LOVE this recipe. My only complaint is the recipe calls to "cook until no longer pink" twice, causing for over cooked chicken if you're not careful.

I've always used a similar recipe that carried a heavier base of olive oil.  Trying to eat healthier, we tired this and it was voted a keeper!  I add artichokes and cube the chicken into large pieces. Great flavor!

Easy & good. For my tastes I'll drop the sugar to a teaspoon next time.  Used 2 chicken breasts pounded thin, and still needed to double the sauce. Served with jasmine rice.

Loved it!  I doubled the sauce and added extra chicken stock so I'd have enough to put over egg noodles.  I finished it in the oven covered in sauce rather than the pan for timing reasons.  Delicious!

My 1st attempt at our Rochester NY signature dish!  I must say ....i was impressed w/ myself!   i followed the recipe pretty much to the T --except sauteed my chix in 1/2 EVOO and 1/2 butter.   I tripled the sauce (6# of chix!) and used a pinot gregio in lieu of the sherry.   alot of raves from family and guests...!!!   also followed the recipe and used aritchokes....simply divine!!!!    you ROCK rocgrandma!

My boyfriend is from the Rochester area & had been raving about Chicken French. (I'm from CA & had never heard of it.) Found this recipe and it was a HUGE hit with both of us!! I do think that slicing the breasts before breading would make it a little better, but it was absolutely delicious. Followed the recommendation of previous reviewers & doubled the amount of sauce. A WINNER!!

Loved this recipe! I did pound out the chicken and doubled the sauce which I poured over the linguine and added fresh parsley.  I didn't have chicken base so I used vegetable stock.  You do have to make sure your oil temp is hot enough before adding the chicken, or you will lose some of the egg mix and it will stick to the pan.  Very tasty, my family enjoyed it with linguine,green beens, and garlic bread.

As a Midwesterner transplanted in Colorado for the last 13 years,  I'd never even heard of Chicken French. I saw a recent review, scanned the recipe ingredients, and was immediately intrigued.  I followed the recipe fairly closely, only deviating slightly by doing the dredge of flour/egg/flour and pan-frying the chicken just once. I also added both onion and garlic powders into the flour. After making the sauce, I simply spooned a bit over each piece before serving so I could preserve the slightly crunchy coating of the chicken. My only preference for next time is to slightly reduce the lemon juice (I used freshly squeezed). DH and 5 year-old DD ate this up.  Served with roasted green beans (also an AR recipe) and wild rice,  this was a deliciously filling Sunday dinner. Thanks for sharing this regional favorite.

One of my favorites.  A never-fail guest pleaser. My healthy modifications: no sugar, use grapeseed oil instead of butter, garnish with capers and lemon zest.

I needed a quick dinner for Valentine's Day and this was it!  I had another recipe that I'd used before but was never quite happy with it, so I came here to search for better one.  And did I ever find it!  I, too live in Rochester and didn't realize that Chicken French was a regional dish.  I doubled the sauce and used the white wine I had in the pantry--DELICIOUS.  Before tasting it, my 2 year old asked for "atchup" for his chicken...one bite and he forgot ALL about wanting ketchup.  :-)  I served it with basmati rice and steamed broccoli. I'm so glad to have found this recipe--we're having friends over for dinner in a few days and I'm going to make artichokes french for our appetizer.  Thank you, rocgrandma!

I am from Rochester as well and have been looking for a chicken french recipe for a long time that is restaurant quality. I don't have to look any further. The only change I made was to use half sherry and half white wine in the sauce (I did not have enough sherry), and I used a touch of chicken stock in place of the chicken base as I did not have that on hand. Did not have any trouble with the coating staying on it came out perfect. Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!!

From Rochester, so I didn't realize Chicken French was a Rochester thing.  I love it and have always ordered it in restaurants!  This was pretty good, but I would say that there isn't nearly enough sauce.  I would 1.5X it, maybe even double it.  Very good to have it again though!

I also live in Rochester as do many of the reviewers. The only thing I do differently is that I do not use any sugar. I also use about 1/2 cup chicken broth and 3/4 cup sherry so that we have extra to put over angel hair. I use gluten free  flour instead of regular flour and don't add any salt or pepper because the stock is salty!

Amazing! Upped garlic, didn't measure... But we love garlic! Used chicken tenders instead and better than bouillon as chicken base. Doubled sauce per other reviews. Delicious and easy to make! Highly recommend'

Made it and loved it. No changes but did pound the breast as part of the prep. Like most of the reviewers grew up near Rochester and happy to have Chicken French in NC! Almost as good as learning Wegman’s opens near us in 5 months!

Made this several times and it's always a hit. I don't make any changes except to triple the sauce.

I doubled the sauce as others suggested, but the lemon overpowered everything. If I made this again, I'd use a lot less lemon juice. My boyfriend loved it though.

This recipe was great. I pounded the chicken thin, because that is how we like it.  I dredged the chicken in flour, then the egg mixture, cooked it as directed, and it came out perfectly.  You can't cut any corners or make substitutions on this part for it to work.  I have tried making a healthier version before using broth or another liquid instead of frying the coating in oil and it just doesn't work- the flour and egg coating will simply fall off if you don't fry it in hot oil.  You need a medium/med-high heat, real oil or butter (not a low fat substitute), only flip it once, and you may need to be careful about covering it- as this can lead to too much moisture being trapped in the pan.  I used white wine (dry chardonnay) instead of sherry  because that's what I had on hand.  I also added some lemon zest and capers to the sauce.   We served it with buttery mashed potatoes. Came out great!

Have made this several times since discovering it. It is exactly like the chicken French I remember from my days in Rochester. It's terrific and it's easy to make. Just make sure your chicken is all the same thickness. I prefer mine to be thin, so either butterfly your chicken breasts or pound them out to a uniform thickness.

Amazing recipe!  Yes, I'm from Rochester, NY, and they do make an awesome Chicken French! But it's hard to find a decent Chicken French on any recipe site.  I'm so grateful for this recipe.  Absolutely Amazing!!! I would NOT change a thing!

Outstanding!  The variations mentioned were helpful.  I happened to have some leftover brown rice, and added it to the sauce during the last few minutes of simmering.

If you add the sherry in the pan as you're cooking the chicken, it will flame up, its beautiful if you're a pyro like me, just pour some into a shot glass and pour it in QUICK!!! (DO NOT POUR FROM THE BOTTLE)

Very good recipe.  I was excited to find this recipe.  I live in Hawaii now but just moved from the Rochester area.  They do not serve chicken french here.  I believe it is a western NY thing though, not just rochester.  I ordered chicken french at salvatores in Buffalo NY once and it was the best ever.  If you have a chance order from there, you will die on how it melts in your mouth with a burst of flavor.  I'm telling you Salvatores beats any Rochester resturant.  I have tried everywhere in Rochester to try and get this flavor again but couldn't.  Thanks for the recipe.

Just had it for dinner, AMAZING! I have been using allrecipes.com for a while now but this recipe made me join so I could review this recipe! Chicken french is definitely a good quality of Rochester.  I doubled the recipe to make 8 servings but cut my chicken breasts in half as well as flattened them with the meat mallet. For the sauce, I added the juice of 2 lemons. Fresh lemon juice always tastes better than the juice from the bottle.  An Excellent Chicken French Recipe!

I, like other reviewers, did not realize that Chicken French was a Roch-cha-cha thing!  This recipe made, the BEST Chicken French I've ever had (if I do say so myself!).  The only change is that I did double the sauce like others suggested.  I served it with parmesan egg noodles and french cut green beans.  What a delicious, quick, easy--yet fancy meal!

This recipe is absolutely heavenly.  I lived in Rochester, NY until 2003, and have not had chicken/artichokes french since, but have been craving it for years.  Gave it a whirl tonight, and it is to die for.  Even my picky husband ate it.  I love it over rice or pasta.  Definitely double the sauce.  I also flour and egg drained, canned artichoke hearts to serve with the chicken.  If you love lemon and butter, you must try this.  You will not be disappointed!

I was a little skeptical using the egg as part of the breading, but this came out wonderful- a different twist on a chicken dish. I followed the recipe but added mushrooms b/c I had them on hand & thought it would add to the dish, which it did. The sauce was great, I did add extra lemon for an extra kick of juice. Will make many times again!

This was very good but it was a bit too lemony for my taste. Although my husband liked it very well. Next time I will try with less lemon juice. But otherwise very easy to make.

Excellent recipe. Very flavorful. Use one teaspoon of vanilla extract because I did not have Sherry. I would highly recommend! I put the chicken in flou then egg mixture then flour again. That is how I make chicken fingers. Thanks for the recipe.

I totally agree with Sarah—tenderizing the chicken with a mallet is key in keeping the flavors robust instead of the meat being too thick and monopolizing the flavor.  As for Lavendertatoo, my experience suggests the oil was not quite hot enough thus the egg mixture essentially drained off the meat.  I also add a few capers for garnish.

I too lived in Rochester for most of my life so was excited to find this recipe. It’s delicious. I made extra sauce to go on top of the rice I made, along with garlic, Parmesan  asparagus as a side. My only changes were a little extra garlic, additional pepper in the sauce and tiny bit more lemon juice. Then just sprinkled a little corn starch to thicken it more. It was delicious!! I’ve pinned it and put it in my favorites. Will definitely be making again!!!

We loved this recipe! My family enjoyed it very much. It came out so tender and juicy! I had never had Chicken French before, so I don't have anything to compare it to. 

Ok, so against my instincts I halved the lemon juice at my husband's request. (He's not a fan of any lemon chicken.) But it still tasted wonderful and had a non-overpowering lemon flavor. My husband said it's a keeper! Even my 12-year-old so gobbled it up.

I've lived in the suburbs of Rochester all of my life and Chicken French is on the menu of many of the favored restaurants here. I made it as written with the exception of using chardonnay instead of sherry and making a little extra broth with the chicken base. I then had to thicken it with a little cornstarch and water. In my opinion it's an excellent recipe for Chicken French, a Rochester, NY favorite!

Sauce was perfect, I used the wegmans sweet sherry instead of dry but we both loved it.  Also had it with Wegmans premade sautéed greens, I’ve never had kale that tasted so good.

I might add a little more wine next time. The lemon seemed to stand out a lot more.

I used chicken broth in place of the sherry and added a little grated Parmesan and it was the best I have ever had. I live near Rochester and have add it at many resturants and this was just as good if not better. This recipe is a keeper.

Highly recommend.  I split the chicken breasts & pounded thinner.  Followed the recipe (probably added a little more garlic) and it was as good as any I’ve had in a restaurant.  Drizzled extra lemon juice over all.  Not at all difficult to make either. Husband liked it.  Plus u can cut w a fork.

I used chicken tenders, about 2lbs, doubled the sauce using white wine instead of dry sherry. Also added a can of small artichoke hearts & served over angel hair pasta. It was excellent & made more than 4 servings!

I sometimes make this with spaghetti or linguini instead. And also use garlic and onion powder in the flour for added flavor in the batter. Great recipe and the person who reviewed as a disaster and the batter falling off the chicken clearly doesn't know how to cook. You always dredge in flour then egg in that order. Delicious with the sauce!

do NOT cook until no longer pink the first time.  Should only have to cook for  3 or so minutes on each side first , then remove from pan, do the sauce, add the chicken back in.  If you cook the first time til not pink you'll WAY over cook your chicken.

I had the same problem with the egg mixture coming off the chicken it turned out to be more like chicken and scrambled eggs. However I think that was my fault because I didn't put the chicken in a single layer, I just put it all in the frying pan. Lesson learned. I doubled the sauce recipe and I'm glad I did. I also added some flour to the sauce because it was very thin and didn't thinken up for me.  Overall I'd make it again.

This recipe rocked my socks. I changed a couple things cuz I didn't have all the ingredients and was too lazy to go to the store. Instead of Parmesan I used feta cheese. I used Marsala instead of sherry (not much different but still) and I left out the lemon juice. I also added some of the flour mix into the sauce in the end to thicken it up a bit more. But overall this recipe was delicious! Will def make it again. Thank you!

I make this on a regular basis! we are from rochester and couldn't believe how many foods are only found there! I use apple juice instead of wine (I don't use alcohol) and add a significant amount of sugar:) after just browning the chicken I remove it from the pan, make the sauce (usually a triple amount) and then put the chicken back in the sauce and simmer for 20-30 min. my husband calls this "candy chicken" and we all LOVE it! thank you so much roc grandma! I never would have ate this again if it weren't for your recipe!!

I have made this recipe 6 or 7 times. This time it was the first for my bride. Well we have been making spiral zucchini and summer squash this summer.  So tonight I made her this delicious dish.  I chose to make the sauce with my favorite dinner wine CITRA Trebbiano. I did the flour-egg wash-flour method. So  I made extra sauce and cooked the spiral veggies in it.

Also from Rochester! This is the 3rd time I have made the recipe.  My family voted it their favorite dinner!! I double the recipe except for the chicken, I use about 6 chicken breast halves. I did not have any trouble with the flour/egg mixture coming off.  I pound the breasts in plastic bags to make them really thin, more tender and cooks faster.  This time I added artichoke hearts while everything was simmering the last 15 minutes.  Also, I used Holland House White Cooking Wine instead of Sherry. I serve it with Basmati rice and a tossed salad :) Love, love, love this recipe, thank you for sharing it!!!

Excellant! Easy! Will make again, and again, and again. 

I followed this recipe as written, except had regular chicken base on hand. Will have to get the low-sodium chicken base, even though the taste didn't suffer. 

I usually alter recipes, but not this one!

I really enjoyed this - my son thought the sauce was too strong in flavor, but I may have accidentally let it reduce a little (had to let it sit on the stove while I picked hubby up from work).  I enjoyed it that way, though, and will make again.  Love the texture on the outside of the chicken.  Yum.

I have made this several times. Great flavor! I do need to add extra oil and maybe that was why the batter fell off fir some? I have not had that happen. As with most cooking, adjustments need to be made sometimes. All in all, this is my number one used All Recipe!

I am from Rochester, and have had this meal out all over the place without realizing it is identified with the area. My kids have had it out and liked it, so I thought they would like it at home as well. I tried this recipe last week, and the whole family loved it. I even substituted Tofu for chicken for my wife who doesn't eat meat. Everyone was really pleased. I had no problem with the flour coating coming off. I suppose one could reverse the flour and the egg, but with the natural moisture of chicken, one does not need to. In fact, it is the egg coating sticking to the flour that gives it the special texture, (a little like a crepe coated chicken breast.) That is why every recipe I have seen for Chicken French calls for the dredging first and THEN the dipping in the egg mixture. The first time I followed the recipe, the coating stayed on very well. If the pan is not adequately coated with oil or is too hot, it might cause the coating to stick. Regardless, it is the sauce that really gives it the special flavor. I did not have dry white wine or sherry available, so I used cooking Marsala wine. Halfway between chicken Marsala and chicken French. I think that made it even better.

Grew up in Rochester and this was definitely delicious spot on--big hit at my house! I served it over linguine which is how I always order it at restaurants. Same with a few others who commented, the instructions said to cook until no longer pink twice, which could make it overcooked if you are just reading line by line. Overall authentic and yummy... I'll definitely use this recipe again!

Sounds like 1-star "complete disaster" oil wasn't hot enough. Oil that isn't hot enough will cause the coating to coagulate and sort of blob  off. Cutlet cooking is a bit tricky. The oil has to be just right, not too hot, not too tepid. Otherwise, the recipe is a winner (though I don't add the sugar). Proud that it's a hometown recipe too!!

This is the best chicken French recipe I've found to date.  I usually make MUCH more sauce than directed (increasing the sherry and lemon juice, and also adding some pasta water) so that there is enough to coat pasta on the side.

This is an amazing recipe. My family devoured it, I agree with the other reviews that it is a restaurant quality recipe. I didn't have lemons so I got creative as opposed to going to the grocery store and used some left over lemon pie filling that I was looking to do something with. Sweetness didn't effect overall taste.  I tripled the sauce and served over angel hair pasta. Sometimes you just have to ad-
lib and this was a success!

This is a wonderful recipe and technique.  I grew up near Rochester, and this recipe hits the nail on the head!  I used thin sliced pork chop and it was just as good.  Thank you for sharing!  It's a keeper.

Great flavor but a little too much lemon and I used a decent Chardonnay instead of sherry I agree with other readers..make more sauce...next time I will make the sauce using the same amount of lemon but will triple the garlic, wine, butter and chicken broth. No problem with sticking at all.

As a Rochester, NY native, I have to say this was perfect! It's my favorite dish to order at restaurants and I have not been able to replicate it...until now! It took about an hour to make and I doubled the sauce, as others suggested. I also added a bit more lemon juice to taste. I "frenched up" some frozen broccoli along with it and served it over thin spaghetti. Whole family at it up! Thank you!

This recipe is fabulous!  This replicates the chicken french you order out in town. In fact it's better than what most restaurants present. I trim the boneless breasts and pound them until they are an even 1/2 inch thick.To quicken the process I sometimes substitute seasoned pan searing flour before dipping in the egg wash. I use drinking sherry from a regional vineyard and fresh lemon juice and always double the sauce recipe.  So grateful rocgrandma shared this! This is my husband's favorite meal!

My family said "make it again!" The only things I did differently were to use the juice of one fresh lemon in place of the lemon juice - I mixed half with the beaten egg and half in the sauce. I dipped first in the egg/lemon and then in the flour mixture. I added a bit of flour and water mixture to thicken the sauce before returning the chicken to the sauce.

Fabulous! I've been trying to find a recipe that tastes like the restaurants and finally, I have.  Made this tonight and was more than pleased.  I, too, doubled the sauce portion as I wanted more, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Yum!

This was excellent and easy to make. I have to admit, I'm from Rochester, NY, and I've never ordered this in a restaurant. I have no idea what is different from Rochester vs. other places. (Someone would have to tell me.)
The family loved this recipe. It's a keeper.
I used a mallot on the chicken breasts to get a more consistent thickness; this is a personal thing for me. I also had to fry for less time (probably because of the thickness).
The flavor was very good. I may try some of the other suggestions listed in the review next time, but still ok as-is for our clan! Thanks RocGrandma!

Delicious, beautifully golden and tangy!  My 14 year old son now on his first home-ec class of high school decided to make it and it came out DELICIOUS.  So if a beginner/inexperienced 14 year old can make it that good - This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks!

Great recipe!  I, like many others didn't realized chicken french was a Rochester thing until I moved away and no one I mentioned it to had heard of it!  I had no problems getting the egg to stick well, but I did 1.5x the sauce and will definitely pound out the breasts next time.  Served over rice pilaf with roasted asparagus on the side.  Was as close to Antonetta's famous chicken french as I'll get living in DC!

Since eating Chicken French at Sanibels in Webster last month, I've been wanting to try making it at home.  This recipe was not quite as good as eating at a restaurant, but all in all, this was very good.  Also good reheated the next day.

This recipe was amazing! 5 Stars!! I made it exactly as the recipe reads, other than I dredged my stick of butter in the flour mixture before melting it to make it thicker and I did double the sauce for pasta. My husband said, "that was like restaurant dinner!" I agree that chicken french is a hard recipe to master and most don't compare to dishes from the Rochester area! This one's a keeper! ~from Hornell, NY.

I am from Rochester and LOVE the Chicken French from the Northside Inn.  This reminds me of that recipe.

very good recipe - easy to do. I used chardonnay instead of sherry and a pinch of sugar and it worked out well. I might try adding a bit of fresh thyme the next time around to emphasize the lemon and a bit of an herbal undertone to the dish.   I also thought the use of the egg batter with the cheese mixed in was a wonderful touch - the coating was nice and light and the toasted cheese added a little something extra. Plus pounding out the chicken breast  makes it more tender and easier to cook.
