What a great idea! What used to be a ho-hum, clean out the fridge night, has now become a look forward to adventure. Thanks for the great idea! We tried your original, found it delicious, and discovered that this is a can-do- no-wrong recipe. Yeah!

It’s been my belief that a recipe is only as good as its versatility.  This is a fantastic base recipe and as one reviewer said, you can’t go wrong with this one.  I reduce the oil by about ½ and use EEVO instead of butter.  I like mine best with bits of broccoli and red peppers added.  I can’t imagine too many left over veggies you couldn’t easily add to this dish.  Great idea!

Didn't like this. It was edible, but I won't make it again. Chinese five spice with cheese and bread didn't seem right, but since it got good reviews I tried it anyway. Oh well.

This was edible but I didn't love it. Probably won't make again, Sorry.
