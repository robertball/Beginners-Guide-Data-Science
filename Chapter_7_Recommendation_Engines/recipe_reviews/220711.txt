Very easy and was surprisingly tasty. Made as directed except used canned diced tomatoes (drained) and didn't have linguini so used spaghetti instead. Never thought to add the asparagus with the pasta and cook together. Loved the way it cooked up because I like my asparagus crisp tender! Will definitely make again.

My kids liked it but my husband hated it. It was on the bland side. Probaby add some more seasonings.

Yummmm!!! This is a keeper.  I tweaked the order of some of the ingredients to bring out the best of flavor and it worked.  Here are my notes.  I sauteed the chicken in olive oil, generously added pepper, dash of salt.  Saved off chicken.  Added red wine (only because if prefer red wine, white will produce a better color) and stirred up the ruins from the chicken, added mushrooms.  Sauteed a couple of minutes, added the asparagus.  Stir about 1 min, add cream.  More pepper, dash of salt.  Stir per directions.  Add in tomatoes, stir, add back chicken.  Just before serving I added the garlic (maximizes nutritional value and flavor) and fresh basil.  I served over fresh spinach (I'm a gluten free girl), with a dusting of Parmesan. My husband went back for seconds and literally licked the bowl!  Thank's for the yummy recipe!

We didn't find this dish flavorful.  My finace liked it...at least he said he did.  I didn't think it had enough sauce even after I (reluctantly) poured an entire jar of Bertolli Alfredo over it, and I used half the amount of pasta called for in the recipe.  I made this per the recipe except used half and half and bow-tie pasta.  Reading the ingredients, the liquid ingredients total 1.5 cups for 8 servings so I shoulda known...

Nicely flavorful. I used half and half instead of cream, probably not the best strategy since it separated, but it still tasted great.

I agree with others who have said this is a bit bland and that there wasn't enough sauce. I made half again as much sauce, which helped. I added Italian seasoning throughout as I was cooking, but could have added more. I'm the only one in the family who likes mushrooms, so I couldn't add that, but I think that might be a key ingredient to boost some flavor.

I used the submitter's suggestion of using mushrooms only because of the cost of asparagus at this time of year.  I made half a recipe using capellini (desired by my hubby).  I sauteed the mushrooms in butter before adding them to the sauce, and I probably would have done the same thing had I used the asparagus.  My one suggestion would be to double the sauce because keeping everything in proportion, there just wasn't enough sauce.  However, that being said, this was a very good meal.  I will admit to one other digression (sorry to those recipe purists who stick to the total recipe as written)----I used leftover chicken from another recipe,  but I did sautee it in butter and olive oil with the garlic, very similarly to the recipe requirements.
