Unlike some folks, I followed the recipe to the letter. My kids loved it! My husband, who never eats chicken, loved it! I will be making this one again!

There is nothing wonderful about this recipe, especially for how many steps and ingredients.  If I do make it again, I would not use the basil (way too overpowering) and my husband did not like the tomatoes (canned diced tomatoes).  I also thought the sauce for the mac and cheese was boring.  To make it more edible, I added cheese to the top and baked it in the oven.  There are much easier chicken recipes to make than this one that taste much, much better.  I would have given it 1 star but my husband kind of like it.

SORRY - but my family found this too boring.  The last reviewer stated that the basil was overwhelming and the fresh tomatoes added nothing to the dish.  DITTO.

I liked the simple ingredients in this dish, however I did tweak it. Perfect for busy Moms & Dads to make. Cook 1 pound of thin ziti when done drain and add 1 jar of Ragu Cheese, throw into the mixture 1 Package of Perdue Shortcuts (diced), 10 oz. frozen brocoli (cooked),  1 can of Italian style tomatoes (drained) into a 9x13 pan. Sprinkle 2tbs whole wheat breadcrumbs crumbled with 1Tbs butter and Parmasagne cheese. Very good!

This was a good kid friendly recipe. Nothing special, but good for adding some nutrition to your standard boxed mac and cheese.

I changed a few things and added like other reviewers suggested. I did not add Basil but added poultry seasoning garlic salt and pepper. After I got it all done I stumbled bacon on top sprinkled with cheese.
