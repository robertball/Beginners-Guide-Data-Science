from a bartender of 30 plus years; classic drink...always use the top of the line ingredients. Changing the ingredients changes the entire drink. THIS is a margarita!

This was too tart for me.  Try using silver tequila, fresh lime juice, Cointreau, amaretto and splash of OJ to soften the tart.

I'm a margarita junky and this recipe is the closest to my dream margarita! I use simple sugar instead of agave nectar and I lie the rim with lime salt. YUM! Thanks for the recipe

Really strong for us, we reduced the amount of tequila and they were much better. Served at my birthday party and everybody was enjoying them. I couldn't find the brands mentioned, but did use some smooth silver and triple sec.

Mixed exactly as shown using good Tequilla and bottled lime juice.  EXCELLENT recipe!  Perfect combination of ingredients.  One of the best margaritas I have made.  Ps- you can make sugar free simple syrup using Splenda or store brand “Splenda” for us Diabetics! ??

Excellent margarita. Nix the pre made mixes and make this with fresh lime juice instead. We used agave syrup which keeps the integrity of the drink but we prefer less sweet drinks and used 1/2 ounce of agave syrup. Perfection!

Yum!  Instead of lime juice and simple syrup, I used frozen limeaid and it worked well.

Very strong so I used half the tequila.  Use good tequila because this is a fresh and simple ingredient top notch margarita.  I boiled the lime peels in the simple syrup which gave even more lime flavor without the tartness.

This was fantastic!  The only changes I made were the brands of liquor because I couldn't find what was listed.  I used Don Julio Blanco tequila and Cointreau.  I quadrupled the recipe and made them in a glass carafe about an hour before my company arrived and they were perfectly chilled and delicious.  I will definitely make again!

I make these all the time and they are a real crowd-pleaser. These are quite strong so be careful if you make a large batch and aren’t paying much attention to your pours. I like mine a little sweeter than the recipe so I round up a bit on the simple syrup. Nothing like a pure fresh squeezed simple syrup rita!

I made this on the whim because I was out of limemade concentrate and boy did this not disappoint. It is so good! I only used 1 oz tequila because I know it would've been too strong for me. It was perfect! Plus, it's healthier using fresh lime juice instead of that concentrate. Going to use this margarita recipe from now on. Thanks for posting! :)

This recipe is easy and tasty. Not too tart or too sweet.
