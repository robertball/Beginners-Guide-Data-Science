Great as is ....Just to offer a lighter twist and to stretch the budget out.....Rather than breading the chicken and then topping the chicken with another piece... try one piece ( not breaded) , add raspberry preserves over the brie and chicken and wrap in phyllo.  Light and yummy.   You can even use poached chicken and sugar free   preserves to be a little more healthy! Thanks for sharing!

I was very excited to try this recipe, but I have to say that I was a little disappointed. I love chicken, brie, and caramelized onions so I thought these things would go great together. It was just alright, not great. It took more time than I thought, and it was so rich it gave me a stomach ache. Also, look at the nutritional information...definitely not worth the 1500 calories.

Excellent meal.  Sauce didn't work for me (lumpy and nowhere near saucy).  Don't think you'll miss it.  Spoiler Alert - couldn't keep my hands out of the caramelized onions while the chicken browned.  Might want to make more than you think you'll need.

Everything was good, except the sauce. Followed the recipe and found that 1 x tablespoon of thyme and 2 x tablespoons of arrowroot - too much.  Definitely too much arrowroot - had to add vermouth to the recipe to even make a sauce.   One last thought - sweet (red) or dry (white) vermouth?  I used dry vermouth.

the chicken was great but the sauce didn't turn out...twice. I followed the recipe exactly and the sauce was one big lump. Dumped that and made it again with not even a full tablespoon of the arrowroot and had the same result. The dish was fine without the sauce.

Loved my version of it. Didn't have brie but used mozzarella with success. Didn't do the sauce because the onions were plenty of flavor. Thx! Husband liked it, too!

This is becoming one of our favorite meals, although the more I make it the more I change it up a bit to make it lighter and faster. Usually I cook the sliced onions until they are translucent in just a tiny bit of butter, and then add a tablespoon of sugar and balmic vinegar. While that is cooking, I will dip the chicken in the egg, and then dredge in flour. Next, salt and pepper the chicken and brown on each side in a tiny bit of olive oil. In a casserole dish, I will lay the chicken, Brie, and top off with onions and bake all of that. While that is in the oven, I will make the sauce. I have never had any problems with the sauce... and I think it adds a lot to the meal.
