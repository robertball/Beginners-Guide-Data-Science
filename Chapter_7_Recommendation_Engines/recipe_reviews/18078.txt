Yum! Another low-carb recipe the whole group (including 3 kids) loved! 4.4 carbs per serving. I usually don't care for water chestnuts either, but they added a really delightful crunch. I also added one egg to the recipe to keep them held together and broiled them -- about 5 minutes on each side. Perfect! Thanks so much for the recipe!

These burgers have a great flavor and my family loves them.  It was a little difficult getting the patties to hold their shape until I figured out to cube my cheese a lot smaller.

My picky husband and even my kids loved these!  The new kraft cheese crumbles are easier to use in this recipe than the larger cubes.

I love this recipe and everyone who tries it loves it too!  I do add a little oatmeal in with my hamburger mixture so it stays together better.  Other than that it's perfect the way it is!!

We just started the AKTINS diet and wow!! What a tasty surprise these turned out to be! I didn't serve them with buns and they were simply delicious on their own. The water chestnuts add a nice "crunch." This one's a keeper!

I was told these were the best bugers I had ever made! They were so excellent we didn't even use buns! I used an egg to help hold everything together, and also used Teriyaki and soy sauce. I melted a little cheese on top and served it with veggies and teriyaki rice. It's definitely a keeper!

I was shocked at how good these were!!! I really only made them because I am doing the low carb thing. I always saute' onions before adding to recipes (except cold dishes) but I didn't feel like it tonight. So I used 1 T. onion powder instead. I liked how it turned out! These were very flavorful & the whole family enjoyed. Thanks!

Here's the good and the bad.  The good is that this is a tasty burger.  The bad is that this burger seriously falls apart, and the cheese cubes melt big time in your pan.  The recipe says to cook on a griddle or skillet, so DON'T even think about cooking these on your outside grill, as I can assure you you'll have a disaster.  I read the reviews, did add some Egg Beaters in an effort to provide a binder, and although I was able to flip the burgers, it still was not a pretty sight.  I used a Calphalon grill pan which is pretty easy to clean up, otherwise, I think I would have had a mess with the baked-on melted cheese.  If I were to make this again, I think I'd skip the cheese cubes (not convinced there was anything gained from this) and just add a nice slice of cheese on the top making it a real cheeseburger.   As suggested, I did use Teriyaki sauce in place of the soy sauce, but I really couldn't taste it at all.  But then, who really cares, it still was a delicious and moist burger.

These were delicious!  I added an egg and some breadcrumbs based on other reviewers suggestions.  I also used ketchup and chili powder instead of chili sauce, and chinese mustard instead of prepared mustard.  I also used the cheese crumbles based on other suggestions.  They held together "ok" but that's just because I warned the grill master ahead of time.  We are going to try cooking them on the Forman grill next time to see if that helps keep them together.

I thought this was one of the best burgers I have had in a while!  They were so moist and flavorful!  I used shredded cheese instead of cubed, and I did add one egg as a binder.  I absolutely LOVED the crunch of the water chestnuts.  I served these burgers on whole wheat buns and topped them with a splash of teriyaki sauce, lettuce and a little extra mustard.  I also served this with the Snow Pea and Napa Cabbage Slaw from this website, which also had a lot of crunch, and made a nice, light accompaniment to this meal.

As written, I gave the recipe 4 stars - they didn't hold together that well & could have used a little more "punch" but were very good. I grilled them - flipping once. I will make this again & use only 1/2 cup chopped onion and maybe some chopped garlic or another Chinese-type spice. Made this with jasmine rice & a bagged "Asian Crunch" salad. We all enjoyed this dinner.

Yummy! I replaced the soy sauce with Teriyaki Sauce (the recipe from this site by Kevin, thickened with cornstarch). After I turned the burgers over I spooned a teaspoon of the teriyaki sauce on top. These burgers were very juicy and very good. I don't think I will ever make a regular cheeseburger again!

This was a very good change from the regular burger. Made only 4 patties out of 1 lb. but they were just right for our bun size. Added the full can of water chestnuts(8 oz.) and it wasn't overpowering at all. Also used one egg and 2 tsp. minced garlic, did the sauce exactly as written, and loved it! I did change the sauce a little bit because I used 1 tsp. Dijon mustard and 1 tsp. sweet hot mustard. I would suggest making the sauce in a separate bowl before adding it to the hamburger so you can do a little taste test. I thought the sauce wasn't going to be enough, but the hamburgers were a perfect moistness!!

I thought these were pretty good. 
I took the suggestion of some of the other reviewers to use the Kraft Crumbles and that worked out pretty well.  I did add the egg too to help them stay together, but they still fell apart a little bit.  

They were very moist and had good flavor.   I also took it upon myself to make a little sauce that used the basis of this recipie to put over top and served with rice pilaf & asian style veggies.  Pretty good.  Will most likely make again!

This recipe went over well.  I didn't have onions on hand, so I used dried chopped onions instead.  I didn't have cubed cheddar cheese, so I used shredded.  I also added a Tbsp or so of garlic, and a tsp or so of chili powder with a tsp ketchup instead of the chili sauce.   My husband raved about them and I will make them again.  For me, I used ground Boca burger and though I wasn't able to form them into patties, I warmed them up in the microwave and ate them sloppy-joe style.

These are great for something different. I used the Kraft crumbles cheese and it worked great. On getting them to stay together, I made sure to finely chop the onion and water chestnuts. I think this helps.

These are fantastic! I make them as loose meat sandwiches, sloppy joe style, instead of patties. I've used cheese sauce instead of cubed cheese also, which works out great!

I thought this was good.  My picky husband said it was ok.  I cubed the cheese very, very small and added an egg, as some had said to do.  I used whatever mustard I had.  My little grocery store didn't have chili sauce, so I bought mild taco sauce.  And, I was thinking about a different recipe and added some nutmeg.  I fried it in a non-stick pan.  Because of the egg it browned well.  I'll fix it again.

We really liked the flavor of these-they were nice and crunchy.  I put them on the grill.  I agree that these fell apart and if I made them again, I would add an egg to the mixture so the patties would stay together better.

Awesome....I loves these.  In fact I made them 3 nights in a row.  They held up better in the fry pan, than on the grill. I used the crumbled Kraft cheese and like other reviewers I also added an egg to bind, no chopped onion, but onion powder.

Very good burgers and you would never guess there are water chestnuts in them. My husband was totally surprised at how tasteful they are.  The secret to them holding together is to cut the cheese into small pieces, other than that I didn't change a thing.  Thanks for posting this one.

These were delicious.  I didn't have the chile sauce so I just added a little extra mustard & soy sauce.  I'm making these again for the second time in 2 weeks.  Yum!

These burgers were surprisingly outstanding! I couldn't find Chinese-style mustard, so I seasoned them with the soy sauce and some Chinese Five Spice instead. Yum!
