I made this in our motor home, and except for it taking longer because the oven only goes up to 425, the dessert came out delicious.  I got rave reviews from everyone.  I can't wait to make this again for my friend from the Azores.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Loved these when my niece bright them back from Portugal.  Also, reminds me so much of the Chinese egg tart but I love the modified laminated dough for the crunch factor, seriously the crunch can be heard from the next room.  I followed  the recipe minus the optional ingredients in the sugar water.   The family gave it 2 thumbs up and not overly sweet.

I made these for my family during Christmas this year and they were AMAZING! I was weary they wouldn’t turn out because my pastry dough seemed much more dry and stiff than in his video, and I was worried I wouldn’t get the beautiful swirl and layers at the bottom... but I did!! So yummy and satisfying!

I followed the recipe exactly. I refrigerated my dough for 2 hours (impatient. Lol. ) and they are outstanding. One of the best pastries I've ever had. They are sweet and you can taste the vanilla and hint of cinnamon.  Lemon is very subtle, almost not noticeable. The crust is flakey, buttery, and crisp when you bite it. They were a big hit.

Having just returned from a trip to Portugal, I had to learn to make these tartlets. I found many recipes but my trust in John's expertise won out. I was right. This recipe is the best. John's video was the key to success. I followed the instructions and tips carefully and my Natas came out amazing. A bit time consuming, but the dough and the filling can be made days ahead so  the tarts can be filled and popped in the oven minutes before serving. This will be a favorite recipe when I need something impressive to serve. Thanks, again, John!

Took me a while to get the hang of it but I finally made a dozen of those delicious tarts and there all gone! Instead of the water I just put about half a cup of cinnamon whiskey! I'll be making more of these in the future thanks again for the recipe!

I loved making this tart. It was probably the most challenging thing I’ve made yet. I made some powdered sugar to dust on top, and it really set them off!

Overall It was ok. I liked the pastry shell which was thin and flaky but the custard was not as light as I expected. I didn’t fill the pastry shells and bake immediately so I don’t don’t if that affected the texture of the custard. I will make it again so I can compare.

I made the custard and used phyllo shells instead of making my own dough. The next time, I will make my own dough. I made the custard and my husband said it tasted and was the same texture as he had in Portugal. I had left over custard so I made a pie with it
I put the Tart or piece of pie in the microwave to warm it, because it was in the refrigerator. Since microwaves have different power levels, the amount of time in the micro would need to be adjusted. I used the highest level for 15 seconds.  This was an excellent recipe to use because my husband compared it to the custard in Portugal. It was perfect.

I put too much custard on mine, but it still turned out great! I need to work on my dough and how I spread them because it ultimately came out super thin. Buuuut after baking it, it was perfect!!!!

Made mine with apple filling instead. I turned the heat down to 500f for the same time,  my house filled with smoke from the butter deep frying the tart.  The tart itself, was amazing!
 This recipe is better for an out door wood oven.

Video is very helpful with the pastry.  Tastes good but really sweet. I would cut back to 1/2 cup or a bit less next time. They don't need to be as sweet as the recipe calls for.

This was my first attempt at making pastry. It was a drumming success to welcome my wife after a week away. The dough was my biggest challenge. Also I ran out of custard after 10 shells. Maybe too deep or too much. I will try again for sure. Loved it. It brought back fond memories of Lisbon.

Absolute Perfection!!  I followed this recipe word for word (I usually tweak recipes), but this one is just right!!  And so delicious!  The video is a great tutorial as well. It is totally worth the time and effort to make your own crust - I did this with store bought puff pastry last week and it was a flop - making the pastry makes all the difference in the world!

Delicious!! I made a blueberry sauce to drizzle on top and it was a huge hit! But they are absolutely incredible on their own :-)
