This is such a delicious bread recipe. Just a few minor substitutions on my part.. I couldn't find dry buttermilk powder at the store so I replaced it with plain milk powder. Also, I substituted wheat germ in place of the wheat bran as wheat bran is actually less nutritous than wheat germ. Toasting the sesame seeds is definetely a must for this recipe. (And I only use brown sesame seeds instead of white.) Good bread recipe!

I normally make my breads by hand. I proofed the yeast in 3/4 cup of warm water along with the honey. Since I did not have any powdered buttermilk I replaced that with 3/4 cup of regular buttermilk. The total combined equaled 1 1/4 cup of liquid the recipe calls for. I used 3 T of wheat germ. I found the dough to be slighty wet so I added almost 1/3 cup of bread flour, but a little at a time to the dough until it was much easier to knead and handle. I let it rise for an hour under a damp towel. I then punched it down,let it rise again a while longer before placing it into a loaf pan. I baked the bread at 350 degrees for 35 minutes. The top was a nice golden brown color and I could smell a nice aroma coming the bread. I took it out from the oven to let it cool for about 20 mins. I cut a slice while it was still warm.  The bread is nice and crusty on the outside and chewy. The inside of the bread is very soft, light and slightly sweet, but not too sweet. The bread is moist and flavorful with a subtle sweetness. The sesame definitely gives the bread a wonderful nutty flavor. The honey adds a nice slight sweetness to the bread. I think the bread could have been baked a little longer as the bread was a little doughy towards the center. The recipe doesn't indicate a baking time w/o bread machine. So next time I will bake it about 40-45 minutes. Overall the bread tasted really good. I served along with, "Sesame Pasta Chicken Salad, " also from this website.

I really liked this bread, but I made some changes. I added 1 T. gluten, replaced 2 c. of bread flour with whole wheat, added 1/2 c. ground flax, and upped the bran to 4 T. (instead of 3). I also added 1/8 c. extra honey. The bread turned out great--I could taste sweetness, but not so sweet that it couldn't be a sandwich bread.

I'm sorry, but I changed this recipe quite a bit, but it turned out great!  Nice and soft and light and good tasting.  I added 2 tablespoons of margarine, since there was no fat in the recipe.  I used 3 1/3 cups of flour.  I substituted oat bran for the wheat bran since that's all I had in the house, and I decreased the yeast to 1 3/4 tsp. of bread machine yeast.

Loved the bread! I did find the dough quite "wet".  I added another 1/3 cup flour.  This bread makes GREAT toast!

This recipe is excellent.  I added 1/4 Cup additional Honey, and 1/2 Cup additional Flour.
It has a delicious, nutty, sweet taste.

I made this using my stand mixer, so I proofed my yeast in 1/2 cup warm water and the honey.  I replaced the balance of the liquid with 3/4 cup of buttermilk since I didn't have the powder.  I replaced the wheat bran with wheat germ and also added 3 tbs of grounf flax seed.  I allowed it to rise after kneading to a soft, slightly sticky dough then formed my loaf and allowed that to rise.  I baked it for 30 minutes at 350.  It smelled wonderful as it baked and we loved the slightly sweet, nutty flavor.  This bread is good for sandwiches or toast as well as to accompany soup.  Thanks for a terrific recipe.

I love this recipe! It's my favorite to make in our bread machine. Thank you to the person who submitted it! I add extra honey (about double) and make it even sweeter (I also have to add some extra flour). I also have experimented with adding other seeds to it (sunflower and flax) which is good too.

This is more nutty than a regular honey bread.  A medium heavy bread with outstanding flavor.  Toasting the sesame seeds is a must.  We added  a Tbsp extra honey.  So far this is our favorite bread.

Very nice bread!  I made just the dough in the bread machine, then baked the rest of the way in the oven.  I subbed 1 cup of ww flour in for the white flour and it turned out great.  Very nutty and wholesome.  A little too many sesame seeds for me, so I'd cut them down next time and maybe sub in a few other seeds, but otherwise I enjoyed this bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

The first time I made this the sesame seeds must have been burnt because it made it have a weird flavor . So I made it again and didn't toast the sesame seeds, and it came out great! Very easy to make.

I just tried this bread and it is delicious!  I made one small change to it ...added about 1/2 c dry roasted sunflower seeds.  Could hardly wait for it to cool off enough to cut into it!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this exactly as the recipe said, and my loaf rose beautifully, then fell in the middle.  One side burned slightly, and while the outside rose prerfectly, the middle sunk till it was only about 2 inches tall.  Taste was great.  Not sure what went wrong though.

My initial rating was not a 5 star rating. My initial rating was based on the difference between what I thought about the recipe and what my husband thought about it. I must admit that I did not think the bread was nearly as good as he did.

However, because he rather liked it, I have made this bread a couple more times since I rated it and feel the need to change my original rating. 

My bread machine overcooks the bread on the recommended setting. As this is the lowest setting on my machine, I keep and eye on it and turn it off about 20 minutes before the cycle is done. As such the results, and the bread, is much better.

I have been toasting this bread for sandwiches or to serve with soup. While I did not think it was anything special simply sliced and eaten, I absolutely LOVE this bread toasted. Toasted, it makes great sandwiches and makes a wonderful side to soup.

This evening, I am making another loaf. I am going to save some of it to make croutons. While I am convinced this will make great croutons, I will let you all know how it works out.  

Thanks Bruce!!

Very delicious, easy.  One of the best bread machine breads I have ever made.  It did rise too much and then sink way down in the middle, maybe needed a bit more flour?

Good!  Gave 4 stars on advice of my sister.  It's a bit chewy, especially the ends, and not as crunchy as I'd hoped...even though there's a whole 1/2 cup of sesame seeds in there, you could add more before it would be super-noticeable.  Turned out perfect shape, no problems.  Used powdered skim milk instead of buttermilk powder.

I make 2-3 loaves of bread a week and have an extensive bread recipe collection.  This is, by far, the BEST bread I have ever made.  The whole family raved about it and I couldn't stop eating it myself!  This is sure to become our signature bread at church gatherings.

*Note:  As other reviewers mentioned, the flour/water ratio looked off to me.  I added about 1/3 cup flour and the bread came out with a perfect texture.

I don’t have bread machine, but still decided to try this out. I first dissolved the honey in warm water, then added the yeast. I don’t have buttermilk, but did have baking margarine, and added two tablespoons of that. I might have forgotten to add salt (in hindsight), but regardless, this loaf, with the egg & sesame seed wash on top, tastes *glorious*. I’ll definitely make it again when our loaf runs out! (It gives two small loaves; if you’re lucky, you’ll have some left over for the next day!)

Great bread. I added oil for a softer crumb. Dries out quickly but nice for toast when it does.

When I saw the name of this bread I couldn't wait to try it. Sorry about a "it's just Ok" but I found it heavy and the taste was to overpowering as an addition to a meal. I found that toasting brought out a tasty flavor.

My hubby and I really liked this bread. It has a great texture and flavor. I printed this recipe out and am keeping it with my bread machine so I can easily find it to make over and over again. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first bread machine recipe I've tried that didn't adapt well to the manual method. For the liquid I used buttermilk, subbed wheat germ for the wheat bran, and subbed King Arthur's Harvest Grain Blend for the sesame seeds. Perhaps the substitutions caused the bread to rise very little, so it is very dense. However, the flavor is outstanding, so I will probably give this one another try.

This is my current favorite bread recipe.I didn't bother with the buttermilk powder and just used skim milk powder in place  of it.To toast the sesame seeds I put them in my cast iron frying pan over medium low heat and stir them constantly.They'll burn quite easily if you don't stir them.I also doubled this recipe and I make it by hand too.Bake it at 350 for 35 to 40 minutes.The color of the bread always turns out golden brown so it's very pleasing to the eye as well as to your taste buds.This recipe will be one I'll be making again and again to share with family and friends.

I think the failure in this recipe was mine.  I over roasted the sesame seeds almost to the point of burnt (10 min @ 350).  The taste carried through to the bread.  Not sure if I will give this one another try.

I used 1 Tbsp. of 2% milk instead of powdered buttermilk, used all purpose flour instead of bread flour and only used 1 1/2 of that and about 1 1/2 c. of wheat flour.  I used about 1/3c of Sesame seeds instead of 1/2c.  The ends are VERY chewy, and yet crunchy.  My son didn't seem to like this bread too much.  My husband enjoyed it, but it wasn't a favorite.  Oh well!!  We'll keep looking!!  Also, I cooked it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes.
