Recipe as written is bland and too complicated.  However, the idea is good and with a few simple tweaks, is a tasty meal!  
****
To make it taste better try this;
Add 1 tsp garlic, 1 tsp ginger, 1 onion, 1 red chilli, 1 red capsicum.
****
To make it easier, try this;
Chop all veges and chicken.  Cook chicken and onion (and salt & pepper)until not pink any more.  Remove chicken from pan.  I*n same pan stirfry all veges and flavourings until crisp/cooked.  Re-add chicken to pan, warm.  Pour in peaches & syrup and cook until thickened (only a few minutes).  Eat with rice.  Tastes great and much easier.

This recipe was okay and the combination of peaches, brocolli and chicken was good, but there needed to be more of a sauce.  It needs something extra to give it a little kick!

Ok-  Yeah this sounds wierd I know; but it was a hit with my 5 yr old son.  I read the first review and tried to spice things up a bit.  I used a tbs of cinnamon; wich did add a bit of flavor.  Also I used 2 cans of peaches, it made more sauce for the rice.  I also left about a quarter cup of the starchy rice water and mixed it into the chicken sauce a bit.  This will be a dish we eat when I've run out of everything else.  We usually have broccoli, peaches, and chicken stocked.

I made this and did some tweaks of my own as well. used half red half yellow onion thinly sliced them. Also used green pepper diced. diced my chicken and sauteed the onion/pepper/chicken/S+P, added 3 cloves of garlic and ground ginger and a little celery seed. once done added diced peaches and juice and a little bit of honey to give extra sweetness since my peaches were in water and not syrup. used tapioca starch to thicken it up to my preference and added frozen broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, and yellow and green zucchini that I had slightly cooked in the microwave and thinly sliced green onions last. served over basmati grice, very tasty!! love the peaches, chicken,veggies combination!  ?? simple, tasty, healthy!

I took the idea and made the chicken in the crock pot with chicken broth and the peach sauce.  It was a nice light taste, but did lack a "kick."  I added some Splenda-- I really liked the sweetness of the dish.
