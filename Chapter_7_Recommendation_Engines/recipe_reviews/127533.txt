I like idea of this but I felt it was a little off. Matcha is pretty concentrated, a little goes a long way. 2 teaspoons of matcha was more than enough for me. I liked one tablespoon of sugar. The water seemed to thin out the latte a little too much. You really only need enough to dissolve the matcha. More like 1/4 cup. I heated up the water first, stirred in the matcha to dissolve then, added the soy milk and sugar. And heated again to warm up the soy.

I made this with regular milk and a green tea bag. It was great!

I used all soymilk (vanilla flavor), sprinkled the matcha into the milk and blended it in a blender, then added a squirt of honey, and some ice cubes and blended it until it was all frothy.  Super yummy an so good on a hot day!

I didn't have matcha around, so I steeped a green tea bag in the cup of water, and continued with recipe. I have to say it didn't bring out much flavor, but it is a nicer way to get rid of my 250 green tea bags my family accidentally bought. Recommended on a cold day! ^^

very good, but as said below a bit too much powder. I put everything together with ice instead of water into the blender for a smoothie. I also added a touch of vanilla extract to mine, added a nice touch.

Very good!  And easy!  I tweaked this a bit and made it to fit one cup of tea.  I used 1 cup soy, 1/2 cup water, 1 weak tsp. of matcha and 1 pack of Xylitol.

Needs more flavor to balance the grass taste of matcha. I added a spoon of Skinny Vanilla syrup. It helped mellow the bitterness of the matcha. I feel the recipe needs more tweaking to get a better rating.

This was pretty good. Next time I will try it with all milk and skip the water.

I found that I only need 4 teaspoons sugar and that some of the matcha settled on the bottom. Next time I'll use 2 teaspoons matcha and try it with 1 tablespoon sugar.
