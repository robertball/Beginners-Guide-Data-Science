I could not find cream of mushroom soup with garlic, I used two cans of regular cream of mushroom soup. I just added in some fresh minced garlic when I sauteed the onions.  Instead of water, I used equal amounts lemon lime soda. I also had two packages of cube steaks--eight total. I served this with mashed potatoes to soak up all of that tasty gravy. The family inhaled it--no leftovers.

My boyfriend bragged about this recipe.  For a southern man used to pretty good cooking, that is a BIG thing.  So easy and yet sooo tasty!!

Very good and easy.  I am not a big fan of canned soup, too much salt and I was worried this would effect the dish.  I did use the lower sodium cans and only used 2 cans instead of 3.  I did add 1/2 cup milk instead.  It wasn't too salty.

This was so yummy and so easy!!! Hubby mentioned mushrooms wishing there were mushrooms in it. Next Time!!!We also used Deer Cube Steaks. I am glad to find this recipe since I have a hard time finding recipes to try for venison.  Definitely will be making again - We also used just two cans of soup.

I work one night a week and usually will put  to something in the crock pot for the boys to have for dinner.  When I put it in the crock pot, I did not have a good feeling about it.  Surprisingly, my husband texted me to tell me it was delicious.  Enough left over for 2 more good size portioned plates.  Took some to work the next day and the meat was still tender with a good flavor.  Only thing that I would change is maybe cut down on one can of soup.  Two is plenty, I think.  I'll make this again.  It was yummy.

This is a great recipe! Personally,  I don't want to have to cook prior to putting the ingredients in the slow cooker.  It defeats the purpose of the convenience factor of using a slow cooker.  Anyways, I followed all of the steps except the searing of the meat and onions and put everything in the crockpot and it turned out delicious!! I also added mushrooms to this recipe and my husband loved it! I used 3 cans of mushroom soup and it produced alot of gravy which I like.  And, I served this over brown rice rather than the egg noodles.  I will def add this to our venison dinner menu!

We loved this! I added some pepper at the end for some kick and used beef onion soup mix instead of the soup that was called for. I also used precut stew beef, but it took much less time to cook so I had to watch carefully.

It does make a lot of extra gravy. So either up the meat or plan on using the extra gravy for another meal.

We are hunters so I used Axis Deer cube steak. At a dinner party where I served this, everyone raved about it. The meat was exceptionally tender and tasty and yes, there is LOTS of gravy--I served it over rice. Not a mushroom fan so I used cream of chicken soup instead; otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.

I seasoned the steaks with cajun seasoning and black pepper.  I cooked 7 so i added two cups of beef bouillon with two cans of cream of mushroom soup and served with mashed potatoes and fresh baked bread.

I did everything exactly as the recipe said except we served it over mashed potatoes.  We aren't big egg noodle fans in this house.  Only complaint from my hubby was that I didn't make more!

We LOVED this. The only thing I changed was sprinkling the meat with a little seasoned meat tenderizer and dredging it with flour before searing it in the skillet. I used 6 steaks bc of the reviews saying that there was a lot of gravy. It was the perfect amount for 6 steaks. The meat was fork tender. I served this over mashed potatoes. Pure comfort food!  Thank you OP.

Who knew that cube steak gets fork-tender in the slow cooker?!  This tastes just like beef stroganoff.  Next time I will use 5-6 cube steaks to have leftovers for lunch the next day.

I made this last night for dinner, my husband loved it. I made the following changes, used 2 cans of mushroom soup with garlic, 3/4 of a bottle of good beer and deer cube steak. Cooked it for 5 hours on low temp in the oven.
