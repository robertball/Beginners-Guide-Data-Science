This recipe was absolutely delicious!! This was my first time making homemade dough, but this dough was so easy to work with and the rolls baked perfectly. They got rave reviews! I will definitely make again

These are delicious! You canâ€™t really go wrong with pumpkin or cinnamon rolls, they make a great combination! The only thing I changed was substituting skim milk for the almond milk and it still turned out amazing!
