very simple meal, but it's so easy that it's worth it.  next time i will take the casings off the sausage - i thought after simmering 6 hours they would get soft, but they were still chewy and i peeled them all off anyway.  the sauce gets a very strong pepper taste also, so i might cut back on the chopped peppers if i make this again.  overall, for the simplicity it tastes great!

Found another favorite recipe here! I tweaked this just a tad. While browning the sausage I added the onions & peppers. Then deglazed the pan with a half cup beef broth. Then put it all in the slow cooker with the pasta sauce. The sauce was so good we had to keep dipping our sandwich and fries in it!

I have made similar versions of this recipe before.  I use 1.5lbs of spicy italian sausage....bought locally in denver.  3 bell peppers (red,orange,yellow)
2 medium yellow onions.  I add lots of fresh garlic.  crushed red pepper, italian herbs, salt and pepper. Broil hoagie rolls with cheese and seasoned salt.  serve with a slotted spoon.  I also carmalized onions to go on the side. pepperocinis too.   high on the cockpot 3hrs  low 6-8.   You cannot go wrong with this wonderful dish.  Use over spaghetti/rice the day after.

I will give this five stars, since it is so easy, and tastes good, too.  I used a spicier pizza sauce instead of spaghetti sauce, that probably gave it some added flavor.  This took much less time in my crockpot, done in about 2 hours on low, then I just kept it on warm until dinner time.  I will make these again soon!

I made these for our Super Bowl Party and they were delicious. I used Johnsonville Italian mild and hot sausages (we liked the hot best). I did add a little beef broth and let them cook all day. They were so flavorful and tender.My husband really liked them. Easy and delicious, it doesn't get much better than that! Thanks.

Yum!!! Super simple and super delicious. I think browning the sausage first makes all the difference. I used both Hot & Sweet Italian sausage and let me just say, it's all good! Use whatever type you like. For the best sandwich, toast the buns and melt the cheese a little under the broiler. Add your meat and sauce and get ready to be happy!

This was DELICIOUS and very tasty. My family loved this recipe. It is similar to the Sausage Pepper Sandwich recipe found on this site. The slow cooker really allowed the flavors to blend well. I did make some minor modifications: I added diced garlic, cayenne pepper, and season salt. I used 2tbsp of flour to thicken up the sauce and besided the italian sausage I also added some hot/spicy beef sausages. We will definitely be making this again.

Really nothing more than adding peppers, onions, and sauce to some sausages, but after a long soccer practice it sure tasted good!

Simple recipe. For best results slice both the peppers and onions as thin as possible. I used a mixture of sweet and spicy Italian sausage and removed the skin from the sausage before putting it in the crockpot.

This is good but I really think the sausage needs to be fully cooked before going in the slow cooker.  I ended up having to add a small can of tomato sauce at the end because the sauce was runny.  Didn't taste greasy though, good flavor!

Very Easy,Very Good, Very Filling. Followed the Recipe exact, except did not use Bob Evans Italian Sausages. I used Walmart's brand of Italian Sausage & it turned out Awesome. The whole family LOVED this recipe.

This did not turn out that well for me.  Used turkey italian sausage instead.  Didn't care for consistency.  Par cooked sausage first to get rid of extra grease.  Not sure if I will make again with regular italian sausage.  However, my 13 year old loved it...

Excellent. I wasn't sure I would like it, but fell in love with it! I used all sweet sausage (store brand) and Newmans marinara sauce and mozzerlla cheese. My cooker runs hot so was done perfectly after 3 hours. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good!  I doubled the recipe as we had company, and it turned out delicious.  I do have quite a bit of sauce left, and a couple Italian sausages, so later this week it'll be pasta night.  Will definitely make this again.

Good sandwiches, and very easy.  I used a huge Costco jar of sauce and put it all in the slow cooker so I can use the remainder on pasta later in the week.  I used a turkey sausage and topped with cheddar (what I had), then served on Italian rolls I had made.  Pretty good sandwiches; we ate with sweet potato fries.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made these a few weeks ago when my parents and aunt and uncle came for a visit.  It was so easy to put together.  I even added some fresh mushrooms as well...love shrooms!  Sorry, I didn't use Bob Evans sausage, what ever I had in the freezer I bought on sale got thawed out and put in the slow cooker.

Sauteing sausages definitely helped them from being overcooked. Unfortunately my buns were a lot longer than my sausages so next time I'll use more sausage and get smaller buns.
Great busy week dinner.

We enjoyed this...I did not use Bob Evans sausage....I used lean Italian chicken sausage which I grilled first. Also used red and green peppers with the onions and used a container of homemade marinara sauce. Nice and easy for a work day....loved the provolone on the sandwich...really tasty. Thanks!

This is sooo easy to put in a crock pot on busy days! I usually buy the trio packs of peppers so I'll slice all three and toss them in. I usually use Classico Traditional Sweet Basil; a great sauce if you're one of those people who adds sugar to homemade sauces. We usually save our leftover sauce/pepper/sausage mixture and eat it over pasta the following night!

These are awesome! I put the cheese on the buns and stuck them under the broiler for a minute to melt the cheese before adding the sausage and peppers to the sub. Yum! 

I sliced up the leftover sausages and served with some of the peppers, onions and sauce over pasta the next day. That was good too.

Very easy!  Threw everything in the crock pot and turned it on before leaving for work.  Loved the smell when we got home and the whole family enjoyed these.  Did put them under the broiler to melt the cheese before serving.  Thanks for the recipe...will make again.

Super simple to throw together, comes out nice and tender, almost melt in your mouth and great flavor! I cooked mine on low for 6 hours and it came out perfect. You can't go wrong with this one! Thanks for sharing. :)

So easy and delicious - hubby love it!  I left out the green pepper(allergic), lightly buttered the buns and toasted in broiler, then added sliced mozzarella until melted, before adding sausages.  We will definitely make this again.  Thanks for a great, simple recipe.  NOTE:  Do brown sausages before placing in crockpot - eliminates a lot of fat.

I used a combination of sweet and spicy sausages and both were terrific.  My sausages were still firm and not fall-y-apart-y, but I liked that.

These were awesome! We used steak sandwich buns. I will definitely make again, but I think I will grill the sausages rather than pan fry next time.

My family loved this recipe. I would recommend browing the brats slightly before putting them in the crockpot.  This was super fast and easy and made for a great meal.

This was so good.  I am not a green pepper fan, so I added a jar of drained peppercinis.  I put the sausages on the grill for about 10 minutes and then threw everything in the slow cooker. I ran around, taking kids to after school activities and when we got home, the sausages were done.  I served them on sub rolls with a slice of mozzarella cheese.  I used fresh store brand Italian sausages, but any kind should work. I might use turkey Italian sausages next time.

Idk if it's maybe because I used sweet Italian sausage or maybe I left it in the crock pot too long, but this was very bland to me.

I have made these over and over again! They are perfect for when you have company or it is a game day. Throw them in the crock pot and let them go.  To assemble and cook them takes about 10 minutes when ready.  They are perfect and they look like you slaved over them all day.

My husband thought these were a 5, I'm more toward a 3.They tasted just fine but nothing all that special.  However the method of cooking did make the sausages nice and tender and not chewy at all....so that in itself is worth 4 stars.
