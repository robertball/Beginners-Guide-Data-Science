YUMMY!!! I am a college student living with three girls. We are always looking for great recipes to impress each other and our frequent company. This recipe is terrific!! It has a mouthwatering aroma and is very flavorful.  We don't have an outdoor grill so I used the Foreman instead and it worked just fine, shhhh. My date was incredibly impressed, he told everyone that I am a great cook.  It's offical...I can start looking for a husband now. Hahaha

Wow!! This recipe was incredible. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, and grilled them outdoors on our gas grill.

I marinated the thighs for 2 1/2 hours at room temperature, and they were awesome.

My husband, and two kids *ages one and three* loved them too. This will easily become a regular in our house!! Thanks for the great and easy recipe.

this was pretty good.  next time i make it, i will add either fish sauce or soy sauce to add more flavor.  even some lemon may add a little more.

Very easy to make and tasted great!  I don't think the ingredients would be enough to marinate 6 thighs, though (I used 4).  Although the recipe called for 2 hours marinating, I did it in 1, and it worked fine.  I might want to try adding some satay sauce to give it a kick the next time or use half ginger and half lemon grass.

Just three stars for this one as it lacks some essentials. The second time around I added two tablespoons honey, about one quarter cup rice wine, and a pinch of red pepper flake. Much better.

I made this with a couple of chicken quarters, and pretty much quadrupled the ingredients (I wanted enough to marinate the chix plus have some left over to baste during baking). I marinated them  for two hours, and baked in the oven at 350f for about 45 mins. Not bad at all. Thanks!
