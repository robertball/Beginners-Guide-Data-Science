Entire family absolutely loved this, had them as a healthy Thanksgiving side dish. I used squash instead of the sweet potato because they are more carb & blood sugar friendly. Used 2 whole eggs instead of just egg yolks.  Omitted the butter sauce for a healthier marinara to reduce calories. These would be great with a pesto or alfredo sauce also.  Tip: if you have a scoop for cookie dough it works great for making the balls.

SO glad I tried these! Very tender, pillowy clouds of pasta. Everyone loved them. I made a large batch and froze the extra. Will be making these again!

I haven't made it but it might be helpful to say how much, in cups, sweet potato is required once they are baked. No one sweet potato is alike :)

I was so excited to try to make this recipe for thanksgiving and I totally failed at it.  I was so nervous about adding too much flour and after putting in 1/2 cup (doubling what the recipe suggests) I stopped out of fear.  But the dough was still pretty moist.  I figured maybe once i formed the gnudi and refrigerated that would help it to firm up.  Wrong again.  Once I dropped each gnudi into the boiling water they just opened up and turned to mush.  I tried cooking for less time; I tried cooking more time and nothing worked.  I think I just did not have enough flour.  Ended up giving up.  Luckily we had plenty of other sides so it wasn't missed.
I'm still giving this recipe 3 stars because I'm sure this was a user error situation.  But it would have helped me if the recipe could have a measurement for how much mashed sweet potato is needed.  Perhaps I picked out potatoes that were too large and therefore had more water.

I must have used well over 2 cups of flour before I had anything I could roll into balls. The flavor was great, but not great enough to win me over, sorry.

I had roughly two cups cooked sweet potato but probably used two cups of flour to bind it. As I worked the "dough" I would add flour as it became sticky while rolling into balls.  Mine were not marble sized but much bigger, I couldn't seem to keep them that small. I will make these again. Delicious!!

i only had all purpose flour and dry sage so the results where only ok. i don't think i would go out and buy the ingredients to make the dish but it was ok to use up sweet potatoes and ricotta cheese that i had left over in the house

not appetizing at all, even bumping the flour up to 1.5 cups. Not recommended.

Like many others the flour ratio is waaayyyy off. Part of what drew me to this recipe was how little flour it called for. The end product wound up being something not compatible with my diet. I tried cooking it with the original 1/4 cup of flour and they all just fell apart in the water. I had to add probably 1 1/2 or 2 cups of flour (lost track as I added) to get it workable. I still cooked them when the dough was a little sticky and just used the extra flour to coat the outside as I rolled them. Flavor was very good although I used very little butter to save some calories and sodium. Maybe letting the sweet potatoes sit out longer and mashing them into a much thinner sheet would help? I don't think I'd make these again.

This dish is absolutely fantastic! The sage butter really sets off the flavour of the gnudi.  Getting the right amount of flour for the gnudi to hold together while boiling is quite tricky, and will likely take a little trial and error.  We broke up recipe in halves to see which

This is a keeper for me.  I really liked that I could do the gnudi in advance and clean up before doing the final sautee.  It took way more flour than it called for, so I guess I didn't get the potato dry enough.  I sauteed the gndi in the sage-butter-oul and crispped it up a bit, and then added the fresh sage and a lot of crushed garilc for the last minute.  Next time I  an going to leave out the riocatta to save a couple calories!!
