Olive oil?  Are you kidding me?  Olive oil has a low temperature smoke point, so using it in this recipe smoked up my entire house.  Next time I'll be using grapeseed oil - much higher smoke point.

This recipe was super quick and easy.  The breadcrumb mixture enhanced the flavor of the fish and added a perfect crispiness to the experience.  The taste was exquisite.  I served the ahi on a bed of freshly cut spinach, sprinkled with fresh lime juice and opened up a wonderful bottle of Malborough (New Zealand) 2003 Souvignon Blanc.  A side of soy sauce was helpful, but not necessary.  This recipe lived up to its name.

We found Ahi Tuna on sale the day after we had the appetizer out at a pricey restaurant.  It was so easy and sooo yummy!  We served it with a wasabi soy mixture to dip the pieces into.  My only recommendation would be to use parmesan flavored bread crumbs or a mixture of parmesan cheese and bread crumbs because the coating can be a bit dry.  It takes practice to get the searing talent down to a science, but once you do you will want to wow your friends with this fancy and inexpensive recipe all the time!

This was so awesome, I cannot believe I made this.  I love ahi, but in a restaurant I either get sushi or I get an ahi steak super rare.  Either way, it's always a "naked" piece of fish.  So I was a bit apprehensive about adding the breadcrumbs...but I didn't want my fish to be boring, so I did it.  I want to make this every nite.  I love this.  The breadcrumbs get nice and crispy and 45 seconds per side was perfect.  Totally recommend this recipe!

This was delicious and as quick and easy as a recipe could be.  I didn't have Italian seasoned bread crumbs, so I sprinkled a little Italian seasoning before using regular bread crumbs.

Super easy.  Got tuna from Costco.  Served as an appetizer & received many oohs and aahs from guests.  Cooked perfectly at 45 seconds per side.  Recommend wasabi sauce as a dip or drizzle.

Easy to cook and tastes great.  The prep time was 5 minutes and the total cooking time for 2 nice size ahi fillets was about 2 minutes (30 seconds on each side).

This receipe is good.  I love Ahi and if you have been to Roy's Restaurant, they make a great sauce to accent it.  It is made with dijon and soy.  It's very spicy. I use a soy and wasabi dip for this to add some heat!  Add some chopped cabbage salad on the side for some Asian flavor.

Don't bread Ahi like that photo #1 unless you're trying to make Tempura Ahi :) It's not Catfish. If you do bread it, make sure it doesn't look like it's deep fried. It’s fun to experiment with Seared Ahi and all the possible infusions of flavor. Sweet, Salty, Bitter or Sour. Create what the palette desires or modify it to go with any Good Wine or Crafted Brew :) I like the Sesame oil and Parmesan idea so I'll be experimenting a lot. Here's how I do it: Cut thick even pieces and coat in a Pepper/Herb Mixture. I like to mix herbs like Dill, Dried Crushed Lemon(natural), Poppy Seeds, a pinch of Clove Powder is surprisingly good, Dried Chopped Onion or Garlic. Sear each side in Oil for 10 to 30 sec. depending on thickness and your rareness preference. 1/8in at most. (Seared doesn't mean deep fried or fully cooked) The herbs seared but inside should be pink and tender. I add Garlic Cloves to my oil. For the dipping sauce I use a Ponzu or light Teriyaki with a bit of citrus. Soy is salty for me. Wasabi (Horseradish, Spirulina) Powder is best but it slowly gets milder so use it 5-15 min. after the paste is made for best result. Good Pickled Ginger may be hard to find. Store bought Pickled Ginger is too sweet for me so I add Cider Vinegar for a time. BTW, it's easy to make but if you use Cider Vinegar it won’t turn pink. Good compliments with your Ahi are Bitter Greens like Herb Salad or Baby Spinach, Green Sprouts(Radish Sprouts for me) Cucumber sliced thin and sliced Papaya Skin.

The Italian bread crumbs in this recipe thru me off a bit. Just didn't seem to go with the tuna that I normally associate having a more asian flavor. We much prefered the Seared Sesame Tuna on this site.

Really Good!  I made sure the pan was super hot with the olive oil and it was fine.  Only thing I had a hard time getting the bread crumbs to stick so brushed tiny bit of honey while putting salt & pepper on..did the trick and little sweet & savory!  good recipe!!!!

Very good! The grade of tuna is very important.  Mine came from Costco and surprisingly it was perfect.  Rinsed tuna and patted dry. Added a touch of salt and pepper on only one side of tuna so as not to over power the flavor of the tuna. For the breading, used 1/2 cup of Italian bread crumbs and 1 TBS of grated fresh parmesan cheese.  Mix together.   I put the breading in a large baggie added rinsed tuna and shook to coat. Removed from the bag and dredged the tuna in bowl containing 2 beaten eggs. I then added the tuna back to the breading bag and coated again.  This makes and excellent coating. Before cooking, I worked a bit more of the remaining breading into the tuna.  Heat olive oil.  Be very careful NOT to over cook tuna about 1 minute each side, a bit more if the tuna is really thick or if you do not care for rare tuna. Remove from pan and serve tuna on a bed of fresh spinach.  Sprinkle tuna with sesame seeds and as a dip use a bit of wasabi and soy sauce.  I have also used Black Swan, Jaipur, a lemon grass, ginger, garlic dressing/marinade; this too gives an amazing flavor.  It was Great!!!!!  A must try !!!

This was easy and quick. Wasn't sure about the whole bread crumb on such an expensive cut of fish but it made a wonderful crust. Due to the low smoke point of olive oil, I used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 veg oil for better control of the smoke.

Very good! My husband does not like his fish raw so we cooked his for 1.5 minutes/side and mine for 45 sec./side.  BOTH came out wonderful!!!  We are fortunate to have a searing grill attached to our outdoor grill so it added to the flavor. Thank you!

I was attracted to the simplicty of this recipe, although I had never even eaten this dish before, so wasn't sure what to expect! I bought the ahi steaks at Target for $8.99. Once everything was cooked, it was very tasy. The Italian bread crumbs I used gave everything a great flavor. I had some garlic mayo, and I dipped the tuna in that. My husband and I both liked this. I'm giving the recipe 4 stars, not 5, because for me, cooking the tuna for 45 seconds on each side was too long. It'll probably depend on the type of pan you use-- I used a Calphalon non-stick pan, and I turned the stove up all the way because the recipe said to make the pan as hot as you could. However, I really should have only turned it up to medium-high heat or so, because the extreme high heat was too much for my non-stick pan. The breadcrumbs on the first piece of tuna were pretty burned, and there was definitely a ton of smoke from the olive oil. I then turned the heat down and continued from there, cooking the steaks for only about 27-30 seconds on each side. I must also say that I was a little freaked out about the raw aspect! I have NO problem whatsover eating raw fish at a sushi restaurant, but making it myself at home, and being responsible for cooking it correctly made me a little nervous! All in all, this is a great recipe. Just watch the heat level, adjust the searing time as needed, and be prepared for all the smoke!

I don't really like the bread crumbs.  I usually just season it very simply and use a soy/wasabi dipping sauce.  I think I'll just keep doing it that way.  About finding cheap tuna, I have found that Target has pretty good frozen tuna steaks in their frozen foods area.  I think it was $7.99 for two decent sized pieces.  At that price I don't mind making it once a week!  I had the seared tuna appetizer at that Australian themed steak house and I think they just use their steak seasonings.  I am going to try McCormick's Montreal Steak seasoning.  I use my nonstick grill pan and wait until it's really hot and use a little nonstick spray.  I only give it a minute or two on each side and serve it sliced pretty thin.

Before finding this recipe, I had never had seared ahi tuna.  I happened to find some in the frozen section at our local Sam's Club, and decided to try it.  I'm SO glad I did!  I have now made this several times, and it comes out a winner every time.  I added panko breadcrumbs, but followed the rest of the recipe to a T.  Delicious and simple...who can beat that?

Even my husband liked this recipe. He has asked that I make it again. The oil smoked alot but that was just because Olive has a lower smoke point. All in all it was a great recipe and I will make it again and again. ~ Thanks for sharing

I had never made ahi, so was a little skeptical.  This recipe is awsome.  I made it for my family and then I made it to entertain, since I loved it so much.  Even my 4 year old liked it!!

This was so easy and yummy! My family said it was the best thing I ever cooked. The sashimi-grade thick tuna cuts I bought were kind of expensive at Whole Foods, but I still spent way less than I would at any restaurant serving something this good.  Make sure you have tongs at the ready to flip the tuna after each 45 seconds is up, also using them to hold the tuna on its sides in the pan to sear every part of the outside. I used Panko bread crumbs and they were SO delish. I also gave everyone a little dish of soy sauce on the side for dipping.

When will people learn?? Is this 1" or 2" or 3" thick? Weight is not enough. Also, is it fridge cold or room temperature? Makes a difference, just like with meat. Please, people!

Not bad.  I didn't use olive oil for searing as the smoke point for Olive oil is too low for such cooking.  I used canola oil instead as that was what I had otherwise.  I will try this again when I can purchase tuna on sale again.  Fish is so expensive here in Hokkaido these days.

First time! Excellent. I rubbed coarse sea salt, coarse ground pepper and a tad of caynene and oil all over. Cut into 1-2 " squares and BBq'd on sears 45 seconds on 4 sides and YUMMY!. Did make wasabi, ali oili, seafoood sauce, soya/wasabi but with the crust, the dips were not necessary. Will be doing this again!

So quick and easy that my toddler didn't get into trouble a single time while I was cooking! I did not have a problem when using the olive oil. I omitted the salt because I just don't like salt so I used a little balsamic vinegar for flavor.

The breadcrumbs (I used a panko italian seasoned) burnt in the pan and did not seem to add much to the dish. In a grill pan I had to cook the tuna longer as there are fewer points of contact.  the tune itself tasted fine. Next time will leave off the breadcrumbs, or use a flat cast iron pan and see if that makes a difference.

I made this dish for a dinner party but altered it slightly.  Instead of bread crumbs I used Japanese style panko breadcrumbs and I did not add salt to the uncooked tuna.  I prepared it as a bite-sized appetizer served on a mouth-ful of rice with a dollop of wasabi paste and drizzle of soy sauce.  It was delicious and I will certainly be using variations of this recipe in the future.

Very good, but sushi grade tuna is super expensive! it was like $20/lb so if I decide to make this again, it would probably only do it on a special occasion.

I have made this twice as we love Ahi Tuna. The first time was wonderful...45 seconds each side may possibly be too much (although we are small eaters and the pieces were small). The second time, the tuna was still cold in the middle - we had bought it that day and although it was not frozen, it was pretty cold - so make sure the tuna is at least room temperature. We will keep trying this until we have perfected as it is such a simple and tasty dish, not to mention healthy (mercury aside).

I don't like this kind of tuna, but my Dad loves fish, and he said that this is some of the best stuff he has ever tasted.  My only recommendation is to use a cast iron pan and sear the tuna on high in grape seed oil - it wasn't seared quite enough in olive oil.  Other then that, a wonderful & easy recipe!

Who knew ahi tuna was so easy?  Love it! Instead of breadcrumbs, I used black sesame seeds and it was more Asian-inspired and delicious. Thanks for sharing this simple and wonderful recipe.

This recipe was ridiculously simple!  I used Progresso Italian Style/Panko Bread Crumbs, served it with some spring greens and local sesame oil/miso dressing and got rave reviews from my boyfriend and my family.  This dish is usually served in high-end restaurants so to make it at home made me look like a super star.

This was so good and so easy to make.  I had 4 - 4 oz. filets, about 1" thick.  I made exactly as stated, except I turned the heat to med. - high instead of high because it seemed way too hot and the oil was burning.  45 seconds was just the right amount of time.  We whipped up a quick sauce of sour cream, dill, garlic powder, and a dash of lemon.  Delicious.

Great recipe!   Timing is critical.  I over cooked it a little.   It was still good but it was probably medium rare and I prefer very rare.

I live in Arizona so even though I had Ahi Tuna, it was frozen and therefore brown.  Still, this was really delicious and had a great texture.  Goes great with a side salad with a soy dressing.

To modify for Eat Right 4 Your Type (ER4YT) diet, type "o,"  I omited the black pepper and replaced the breadcrumbs with 1/4 cup Ezekial Cereal and 1/4 cup Sesame seeds.  Served with steamed spinach and broccoli.  Best cooked on a nice fry pan, like an All-Clad.

Was really good, simplistic and easy just like it says.

Figuring out how much salt to put on the tuna ahead of time might be the problem... cause to taste makes it difficult.

A reccomendation on what kind of sauce to put with it would have been nice.  I guess in short it could have used some more flavor.  Definately something I will try and make again.

I really liked this recipe. Quick and simple. I cooked mine just a touch too long, got kind of dark and wasn't as rare as I wanted but still really tasty. Next time I will seriously only do 45 seconds on each side.

Very easy. Do recommend subbing Italian bread crumbs for just plain ones (or maybe fine ground panko crumbs). The Italian seasoning was a little off from the flavor I was expecting for near raw tuna. May try mixing in a few sesame seeds as well. Great with a salad and a little soy sauce.

This recipe was very tasty, but the olive oil was smoky (we'll use something different next time). We also used Panko breadcrumbs instead of the recommended Italian ones.

This was a simple but really flavorful dish to prepare. Ridiculously easy and the bread crumbs were an ingredient I wouldn't have dreamed of but what a difference they make. My only complaint (and the reason I ranked this 4 stars instead of 5) is that using Olive Oil is just not the right way to go here. Try this with a sesame seed oil and you will get a better sear and a more authentic taste.

The olive oil smoked up my house as well. The recipe is as easy and fast as they come, which rates well with me! It was really good too. I don't think it is too fishy of a flavor, so if you are not big on fish, this one might actually be good for you!

This was soooo easy and soooo good!  The only modification I made was to heat the pan first until hot and then add the olive oil. I served the tuna with jasmine rice and a "ginger-sesame oil-soy sauce" sauce for dipping. My husband and I enjoyed it tremendously and I will definitely be making this again and again.

I LOVE Ahi Tuna.  I eat it almost everytime I eat out.  NOW I can eat it at home.  This was so easy....and delicious. 
I used the original recipe first....and added parmesan cheese the next time.  Either way, it's great.

This was very good and couldn't have been easier.  It could have used more salt than what I used, but overall it was very yummy.  The boyfriend loved it as well!

Real simple to cook and in less time. I've used one tuna from my bag I've gotten on sale from Aldi's. I never had it before and it was delicious with no alterations.

I followed this recipe to a tee except with using the olive oil I used canola because that ifs what I hand on hand. I seared the tuna for 45 seconds exactly and I burnt my tuna. In it said at the highest temp so i did. Not only was the outside burnt but some of the inside was still cold. I made it for my fiancé he said that The actual inside had good taste it was just burnt on outside looked kind of like it was deep fried. In opinion I might try this recipe again but I will not use the Italian breadcrumbs I think I will use Panko breadcrumbs or sesame seeds and sesame oil, and maybe some lemon juice since I've seen that everywhere. I will also heat the oil on high but then when I go to put the tuna in I'm going to turn it to medium that way it can sear for 45-50 sseconds  and not get it too done on the inside but also not be so rare.l and cold. Overall I'm glad that I found this recipe that is why I gave it 3 stars because j had never cooked Tuna before but I'm glad I did Bc my fiancé loves this tuna, he gets it at restaurants. I always thought it would be super difficult to learn how to make it taste good but I'm glad that I tried and with practice on searing I will master this dish!

Excellent and easy. Will make it again. I did make a quick sauce with some worcestershire sauce, ground mustard seed, garlic, dill, and ginger. Poured it on top. Was awesome. Thanks to whoever shared this recipe.

I found an Ahi Tuna steak at our local grocery store - and couldn't resist bringing it home. I have made this twice - however skipped the bread crumbs. This had a fresh, lean taste - and didn't taste "fishy" at all. Serve over a bed of quinoa and fresh veggies and dinner is ready in just a few minutes.   Enjoy!

This recipe is a great base that you can expand on to suit your tastes. I was looking for a non-asian flavored seared tuna dish so I started here.  Adding some parmesan cheese to the coating and a little bit of butter to the olive oil in the pan made it a 5 star recipe the second time around.

This is the first time I've cooked seared tuna and it was delicious and simple!!  I made no changes to the directions! My husband and I loved it! My husband used siracha sauce for dipping and I used a mixture of siracha and mayo - YUM.

My first time. Was great. I did not have a suace so next time I'll try a soy/wasabi.  As far as the other review about the olive oil. The smokepoint tempature between grapeseed and olive oil is similar although grapeseed is slightly higher.  The smoking was cause by the breadcrumbs that floated to the side. Overall. Fabulous. Will try again and modify w sauce.

I have made this dish several times and love it!  I typically cook it longer than suggested or pop it under the broiler for a few minutes as I prefer my steak more done.  Husband loves it!! I usually serve it with a horseradish sauce... may someday try with wasabi.
