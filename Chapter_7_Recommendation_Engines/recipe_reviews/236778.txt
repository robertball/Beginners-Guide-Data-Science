Really easy and really good! I followed the recipe to the letter ingredient-wise, including the onions, but used my immersion blender instead of the regular blender. I loved not having to think about it for six hours (except to savour the aroma). Yummy!

Love this!  Had a good flavor.  I was lazy and omitted the onion like another did AND I didn't use the blender - I just put my hand mixer in the crockpot and blended away.  So easy this way.  Yummy!

I love this recipe and it is so simple. If you love sweet potatoes, this is the soup for you! (I omitted the onion.)

Made exactly to recipe. Great flavor! I served it with gluten-free stuffing. Will make again.

This soup was very easy but just not a taste I cared for. I followed the recipe closely.  I did add Cajun seasoning to my bowl and that helped the flavor  in my opinion. My husband doesn’t like sweet potatoes and didn’t care for this either.

So very easy and good. I added a bit of cream to bring out some of the sweetness of the potatoes.
