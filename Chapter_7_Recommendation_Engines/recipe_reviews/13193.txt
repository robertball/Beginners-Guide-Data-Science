I really liked this soup until I added the bacon - I didn't think it complimented the other flavors at all. I would definitely omit it if I were to make this again. The only change I made was to drizzle one beaten egg in at the end, to achieve that nice Egg Drop Soup look. Thanks!

This was so tasty and easy. Tasted great two days later too. I ground the chicken which gave a nice texture. Served with fried noodles.

Very tasty and easy to prepare. Definitely better to use left over chicken.

I messed with proportions a bit, only 2 cups of broth and one egg. Added some frozen corn. Skipped the bacon but added several good shakes of red pepper flakes.

I used boiled chicken that I had frozen, used real bacon bits & I used mirin instead of sherry. Next time, I'll omit that bacon as it was unnecessary. This was a very satisfying soup, for as light as it was. I served this w/ Chinese Coconut Pudding for dessert. Thansk for the recipe William Anatooskin...we'll do this one again & again!

Very good and easy. I like to stir in the egg seperately to make it more authentic looking, but this disappeared fast!

This is good! My only changes were based on preference; I substituted potato and caramelized onion for the meat and used vegetable broth. I also added white pepper and cilantro for fun. Still was great! Thanks for the recipe!

I added a few chopped mushrooms and celery.  Agree, less broth is better.
