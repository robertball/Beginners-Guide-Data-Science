These were awesome and very quick and easy!  I was worried the clusters would taste like shortening but, they didn't at all.  MAKE THEM!  It's worth it!

Although I wasn't to fond of these, they were a big hit at our Christmas party! My husband and daughter thought they were great and I will make them again for our next party. Thanks for the recipe! These were super easy to make!

These are very easy and they are good.  I can't say they are excellent and deserving of five stars.
