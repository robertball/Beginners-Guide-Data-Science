I'd actually give this 4 stars as the recipe appears, but it's going to be so easy to fix that I wanted to give it 5 stars in theory....  To me, this recipe was awfully greasy, but the flavor was so good and the recipe so unique that, with the butter halved, I think it will be absolutely exceptional.  Per other reviews, I broiled the asparagus (cut and placed on foil-lined, greased cookie sheet, sprinkled with salt/pepper/garlic, and broiled for 3-4 minutes) and toasted 3/4 cup cashews (reused the foil lined sheet and broiled for 1 minute).  Be warned that the spaghetti browns really quickly in the butter, so next time I might brown the rice first and then add in the spaghetti to brown.  Finally, I did not have nearly enough liquid to cook all that rice -- I ended up adding almost 3/4 cup of water towards the end, but it still turned out beautifully.  Again, next time I will reduce the butter to 2T (and I like things buttery, but this left a lot of greasy residue on the plate, which for me means it's too much).

UPDATE 9-26-07: I've made this a hundred times (at least!) since my original review - I think I could make this blindfolded!  Now I only put in Asparagus if I have leftovers, and I rarely add the cashews - it's very good either way.  Obviously, this recipe is a keeper for me!  FIRST REVIEW JUNE 03: This Pilaf recipe offers a nice presentation and has great taste and texture.  I substituted the vegetable broth with chicken and would do that again.  Instead of boiling asparagus I broiled it in the oven, and would also toast the cashews next time as another reviewer suggested. I also enjoyed the browned spaghetti in this dish.  Excellent recipe, Sandy T., thanks!

Very good. Used sliced almonds as I did not have cashews, but it would have been way better with cashews, I can tell. I used chicken broth and then chicken base granules instead of salt. Also, substituted orzo instead of the spaghetti. And, I highly recommend that you french-slice the raw asparagus then saute in garlic, pinch of salt and olive oil/butter blend. The asparagus stays green and slightly firm. Better texture than steamed. Everyone really liked this dish. I will definitely make this again.

Lovely recipe but WAY too much butter.  I usually make this recipe camping, which is a rather unconventional side dish for under the stars but so easy.  In place of the vegetable broth, I use home made chicken stock from a recipe on this site, "Chicken Stock in a Slow Cooker" which allows you to control the sodium content and is fabulous.  Freeze the chicken stock and take with you in your ice chest which acts as a freezing component/ ice.  Cooked the asparagus on the grill until al dente, which retained the beautiful green color and toasted the cashews before leaving home.  Yes, I know it's very similar to the Rice a Roni recipe which would probably be much easier to pack camping, but this recipe tastes SO much better.  Little extra work than the boxed variety, but so worth it!

I would have rated this a five, but I surveyed my  dinner table after the meal and it was a four concensus.  I loved it.  To make the measurements easier than they are in the recipe, I used one bunch asparagus (roasted in the oven while the rice soaked up the broth), 1 cup cashews (roasted alongside the asparagus at 300), 2 garlic cloves.  I wasn't sure what 2 oz of spaghetti would be, so I bought it in bulk at a health food store and I actually used 4 oz.  Everything else I kept the same.  It was a perfect balance.  I recommend th is to all vegetarians.  It will probably be a five to you while your meat eating friends will probably rate it a four!

This recipe has to be the exact duplicate of Rice A Roni.  The only difference were the cashews and the asparagus which added a nice twist to this recipe.  It was excellent but since it was exactly the same as Rice A Roni, for ease, I will probably just make the boxed Rice A Roni and add the cashews and asparagus.

This pilaf is incredible, although it can do without so much butter...  2 Tablespoons would be adequate.  The mixture of these ingredients is to die for.

This recipe is excellent as is, but it's also a great starting point for coming up with your own version.  I used broccoli because I couldn't afford asparagus this week(also last time I tried an asparagus recipe from this site it was an expensive disappointment), chicken broth, and "wild rice" because I couldn't find the jasmine.  I also used a little less rice and a little more spaghetti, and DOUBLED the cashews.  I can't wait to experiment with different kinds of veggies and pastas.  I would not suggest varying the nuts, though as there is really no substitute for cashews.

I've been using this recipe for a few months and I like it more every time I make it.  I use at least double the amount of asparagus, and increase the amount of cashews.  I've taken it to picnics and potlucks, as it is just as good at room temperature as it is hot off the stove.  Our family loves this recipe!

Delicious!! And so simple to make! I added zucchini to it because the asparagus where I shop was really expensive, and I couldn't afford two punds. 
The one problem, though, was that I don't think it could ever feed 8 with this serving size - unless as a very small portioned side dish.

Very good and easy.  I increased the onion to 1/2 cup, using green onions for the additional 1/4 cup.  I also increased the garlic to 1 teaspoon.

This is very good. I used brown rice, which required more water to be added, and turned out stickier than I think the jasmine would have. Next time I'll stick to the recipe. As others did, I roasted the asparagus for about 5 mins in the toaster oven, and did the same with the cashews. I also cut the butter down to 2 tbsp.

I used homemade veg broth, which I do for everything. Very easy to make -- just keep all the ends of veggies that you have in a bag in the freezer (carrot ends, broccoli stalks, onion bits, etc). When you have enough to fill a pot, cover them with water and boil until the veggies have basically nothing left! Drain and keep the "broth." You can compost or throw out the soggy veggies, and then freeze the broth for when you need it. Great way to recycle old bits of veggies, and couldn't be healthier or more natural!

Excellent! I took out the first whole step with the noodles and butter and instead sauteed the onions and garlic in olive oil. So good!!! I would definitely make it again! :)

Well as usual I go through the wonderful recipes on this site and email them to my teen to see if it sounds good (this is working well so far!)She didn't think she'd like the Jasmine rice and suggested we try it with just noodles. Ok easy enough but now its actually a whole different recipe! I did everything according to the recipe but with just noodles. My daughter and husband absolutely loved it and their only complaint was that there wasn't enough. This was because I eliminated the rice and wasn't sure how much noodle to use so I only used 1/2 a box of linquine snapped in thirds. Next time I'll use a whole box. So the cashews really didn't seem appropriate so no cashews, but fresh grated parmesan on top! So delicious! Also its much easier to brown the onion and garlic in butter before adding noodles. This is an easy recipe. I love this website!

I made this for company, and was told I "hit it out of the park!"  I made it exactly as directed.

Even after a year, this is the recipe that people request I bring to parties what I cook for company.  It's so reliable and delicious!

This was an EXCELLENT side dish! I am always in search of good side dishes to go with flavorful fish and chicken main dishes, and this is going to be a regular for me. JRW does not like asparagus, so I sauteed them in olive oil and garlic separately and ate them with my rice pilaf, while JRW ate his without. We paired it with grilled teriyaki tuna. Also, I had to use lightly salted cashews (the kind you snack on) rather than baking nuts, and it was just fine this way. Other changes: chicken broth rather than vegetable, orzo rather than spaghetti, halved the butter, and doubled the garlic. Great, great, great!

A very tasty rice dish, Sandy! I used chicken broth with 1T Wylers chicken bouillon granules in place of the vegetable stock. I felt that this added more flavor. I used vermicelli rather than spaghetti, and cut the butter in half. This dish resembled a famous boxed rice/vermicelli, but without the added salt.The asparagus was good with the cashews and rice, but next time I think I'll try slivered almonds and green peas.My family really loved this rice! Thanks Sandy.

I made this for company to go with Barbeque Shrimp and it was in wonderful.  All my guests raved about it.  I used Chicken Broth in place of the veggie broth and I thought it added additional flavor.  I also followed several suggestions and doubled the cashews. This is a keeper.

Easy and pretty on the plate. I love recipes like this, they're so classy paired up with a nice steak. I made a beef tenderloin with it and it was worthy of a 4 star restaurant. Very good!!

I was slightly worried going into this recipe because, to be honest, the ingredients list looked a bit simple. In the end though, my husband and I both agreed that it was a surprisingly delicious recipe. The only think I changed was using olive oil instead of butter and adding onion powder because I was out of onions. I would definitely make this again!

Was just looking for a way to combine my two 'slow carb'/'fast carb' side dishes.  Found this because I had asparagus and rice on hand - didn't want to go to the store.  This is an excellent dish.  It was easy and delicious.  I'll be making it often, and probably adapting the recipe with other veggies.  Awesome!

Very yummy, simple and delicious!  I cut back on the butter to 2 tbls and that was plenty.  Also I wish I would have used the entire pound of asparagus I had on hand.  Thanks for sharing!!

I have made this several times and everyone I have made it for loves it.  The one change I made was using sliced almonds toasted instead of the cashews.  Toasting the almonds gives it a wonderful nutty flavor.  It has become a family favorite.

I substituted brown rice & multi-grain thinnest spaghetti (which I sauteed together with only 2 T butter, per another reviewer.)
Bet this would be another good dish using broccoli & slivered almonds, too!KDL

This was well received at my sons baptism. We did substitute the spagetti with wild rice. Used vegetable broth (we invited vegetarians). Used only half the butter suggested. Roasted the cashews. Lastly, we put the aspargus and cashews in at the end (when ready to serve) so they stayed firm.

Loved it!  Cooked this recipe as part of our Easter feast and got rave reviews, everyone wanted seconds.  After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to spice it up a bit more, so I used chicken broth and diluted a packet a Lipton Vegetable Soup in it.  The result was a very tasty rice, the perfect accompaniment for my Mimosa/Rosemary Marinated Cornish Hens.  The measurements were exact and the rice wasn't sticky or mushy.  Definitely a KEEPER that will make repeat appearances at our dinner table.  Thank you Sandy.

This is fabulous. Next time I think I will saute some prawns to add and make it a main meal dish. My son topped it with garlic-sesame sauce which added a wonderful kick. Try this. You won't be disappointed.

I made this as a side dish for Xmas dinner and it was a big hit!  Only alterations I did with the recipe was increase the cashews to 1 cup and toasted them in the oven prior to preparing the dish.  Nice presentation dish for special occasions.  It went great with the Lobster stuffed Beef Tenderloin!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made it with broccoli instead of asparagus and thought any vegetable would probably be suitable.  I prefer a higher pasta to rice ratio but that can easily be altered.  The cashews are an essential to this dish.  To cut down on sodium I used half water instead of broth.  Nobody noticed!

This was great! The smell of this recipe filled my house so my guests were hungry when they walked in!
I know it's is under the vegetarian category, but I didn't have veggie stock and used beef 
instead. It worked great! My kids (5 & 7) ate it up!

Good recipe. Not kid friendly to my mind since raw asparagus can be tough for little hands to cut, and hot butter/oil (I used olive oil& butter) may spatter and burn children.
I used wild rice in place of the spaghetti. I'm not even trying the spaghetti version now! Major hit for dinner. Add some steamed brussels sprouts w/hollandaise sauce and pinot grigio.

Fantastic taste! I roasted the cashews though, since using them raw makes them hard to digest. I had this with broccoli for the asparagus. Note: While scaling down the recipe, take care for the amount of butter you use. You will need a lot less than the recipe calls for if you scale down the recipe.

Love it. Have been using it for years. I do not add asparagus and cashews since it makes a big batch for two people so I freeze what is left. Quite often prepare asparagus and serve it separately.

I would give this a 5 but my husband said 4.  This was delicious.  At the suggestion of others I used about half the butter and I could have probably used less.  I also broiled the asparagus and toasted the cashews.  The texture and flavour of the rice was excellent.  We will definitely be having it again.

Loved it!  Tossed asparagus with olive oil, salt and pepper and roasted in oven at 400 degrees for 10 minutes.  Roasted cashews alongside for 2 minutes.  While the asparagus and cashews roasted, I started on the rest of the dish.  Probably used more than 2 oz spaghetti which was fine.  Really watch it though as it browns fast.  Used chicken broth instead of veg broth and more than recipe called for, probably an extra 1/2 cup.  Turned out great!

Amazing dish. Couple tips I learned while making this dish: less butter goes unnoticed, brown the rice first the spaghetti browns really fast and the onions/garlic don't take long either, broil then asparagus a little first. This dish was so good and the flavors complimented each other so nicely!! Definitely makes a great dish to pass!

Loved this.  Very different and everyone I've served it to likes it.  I use whatever pasta I have leftover and it's fine (I've used angel hair and I forget what else).  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable because I buy it in bulk.  Also I roast the asparagus and cashews in the oven at 450 degrees for 5-8 minutes.

Excellent rice! I've been using this recipe for months now,since finding it last summer, and thought it high time I write a review!   This recipe is extremely versatile and lends itself to many substitutions, as long as you keep the rice and liquid measures the same. I just love it! It's so easy, bursting with flavour and a much nicer addition to a meal than boring old potatoes or plain rice.  Thanks Sandy!

This dish is a winner!  I cut the butter in half because I like to cut the fat content whenever I can.  I also used Japanese (sticky) rice because that's all we can get in Japan and despite being a little worried about how it would turn out, it was great.  Will definitely make this again and experiement, as other readers have mentioned, with different pasta and veggies.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Quick, easy, different. I make my own vegetarian broth using cracked red pepper, italian stewed tomatoes, garlic and onion. This adds zest to the flavor.

We really enjoyed this, even my two year old (he had a great time breaking up the noodles). Kind of like Rice-A-Roni, but much better because you decide what's going in it. I used peas instead of asparagus (which is as expensive as steak here) and this tasted great. Choose a broth you really like, since this provides much of the flavor.

This is so tasty! Very addictive stuff. I sautéed the asparagus, and used beef broth because its what I had. I also used gluten-free brown rice spaghetti and it was perfect.

The best rice pilaf I have ever made! I make it at least once a week, usually replacing the asparagus with frozen peas because I always have them. To make it sinful use bacon grease instead of butter! Yum!

I didn't have jasmine rice or vegetable broth, so used basmati rice and chicken broth. The rice cooks in about half the time. Turned out great! The cashews and asparagus really made a difference. Served it with pan fried halibut with rhubarb/peach sauce and a good Sancerre.

My husband is extremely picky and is trying to go vegetarian.  Cooking is a challenge but with this recipe, I can add veggies like string beans, carrots, peas, as long as I cook them separately and then toss in to the rice and he's happy. And I found brown jasmine rice which is just as tasty.  This is a very easy, vegetarian recipe that we love.  Thank you!

This is really good. I used chicken broth instead of water, and I roasted my asparagus instead of steaming it. I also found that it needed more broth (about 1/2 cup more). I threw in about 1/2 cup of fresh grated Parmesan cheese. Delicious! A keeper :)

Wow! K. Get the rice cooked. They say to do it together, but my experience is that those things never turn out for me, so cook the rice separate and then in a large skillet... saute the onion, then add the asparagus. [For those of you not familiar with asparagus, you need to cook it in sections; cut the washed bunch of them from the bottom up, and add the bottoms first. Wait a few minutes, then add the middles, then add the tops. the tops cook faster, so you don't want them to burn.] once the tops are in, add the vermicelli and cashews with a little more garlic and butter. The tops can cook along with the vermicelli noodles and everything is done together. When the vermicelli and cashews are golden, add some diced cooked chicken and a few spoons of hot water to it, then simmer until the water is minimal to bloat the noodles. Toss with the cooked rice and enjoy! Lots of garlic is encouraged.

I omitted the onion but otherwise followed this recipe exactly.  I agree that it is a bit "bland" but still think it makes an impressive side dish that's a bit different.  I think this would be great with some soy sauced chicken.  I will make this again, maybe try with broccoli and add some teryaki.  Great starter recipe!

This was very good.  My problem is that I did not have jasmine rice on hand and used brown rice instead which I could not get tender.  I also steamed my asparagus in the micro and used peanuts instead of cashews which I sauteed in olive oil.  Very tasty with chicken broth for those who are not vegetarians.  I will make again but next time with the jasmine rice.  Thanks for sharing!

We had this today for Easter Dinner. It was very good. I like the flavors together. the only issue I had is that was a little greasy and softened the cashews a little too much fo rmy tastes. I would probably cut back on the butter a little bit.

This recipe was enjoyable.  I thought it was very easy to make.  I broiled the asparagus and the cashews.  To cook the rice, I used 1 cup of veg. broth and 1 cup water.  I also used half the amount of butter called for and it came out perfect.  I will definitely make this again!

I've made this a few times and it is a great side dish. I usually use only a tbsp or so of butter and add almost 3c water. Also, the dish looks much better if you properly brown the pasta. It works well with frozen spinach too if you don't have any asparagus.

This recipe is a great base to work from, as well as being good in itself. That's why it gets five stars from me.

I stir-fry my asparagus (or other vegetables) in a little bit of butter with the cashews rather than boiling.

My boyfriend and I love this with leeks and mushrooms instead of asparagus. Slice the leeks about 1/4 inch thick or thinner, and thinly slice the mushrooms. Stir fry, then add to the rice once it has cooked. Yummy!

Surprisingly good for being so simple.  It could easily be veganized by using Earth Balance or some other dairy-free margarine. I will reduce the butter to 2T next time.  I wish that I had gone with my instinct and added more asparagus though. Also, I think it is ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY to reduce heat to a simmer after you cover it.  The instructions are a little vague there.  You shouldn't have to add more broth if you reduce the heat. For me, this is  great comfort food.  Thanks for submitting.

Update:  I have found my favorite variation.  Definitely substitute chicken broth for the vegetable broth, and use sauteed mushrooms instead of asparagus and chopped pistachios instead of cashews.  This version steals all the attention away from every other course--even dessert!

Original review:  My guests and I loved this dish.  I cooked the rice in a pan with a glass lid so I could check it.  It got a little too dry, so I added some more vegetable broth, which helped.  Instead of cashew halves, I crushed whole cashews in my fist and stirred them in.  Instead of boiling the asparagus, I steamed it.   The dish was such a hit that I plan to do it again this weekend.

Really great recipe. I accidently doubled the butter, but it was still excellent. I used whole wheat spaghetti to add a little more color and for the extra nutrients. My husband had seconds - which is very rare. It also reheats well the next day.

Really very good and easy to make.  I broke my spaghetti into about 5 which seemed to be right.  I also didn't have any vege stock so used chicken instead.  I also added chopped spinach for the last few minutes of cooking for extra vitamins.  Be aware that the serving size has been calculated small if you are a big eater or are serving this as more of a main than a side.

This was very flavorful!  I did increase the garlic a bit and I sauted the asparagus in olive oil instead of boiling.  I wasn't sure how much to break the pasta so I just broke it in half. Next time I'd break it down a little further.  I may try again and add mushrooms as well.

Great side dish.  I used whole wheat spaghetti, riso Italian rice, and slivered almonds since that is what I had.  It turned out very good.  Next time I will cut the asparagus into 1 inch pieces.  Thanks, Sandy!

Halved the recipe and used orzo in place of spaghetti.  Also substituted canola oil for some of the butter.  Very good along with a Mediterranean flounder dish.

I have made this recipe many times since finding it on Allrecipes; my boyfriend and I enjoy it very much. A delicious, simple, and satisfying one-pot meal! It remains good as leftovers too. I use only about half the recommended amount of butter and I use a vegetable boullion cube to make the broth. I use whole wheat spaghetti since that's what I normally have on hand. And I usually use more than half a cup of cashews.

Tastes nice, I added some ham to make it a one dish meal.  However, the spaghetti does not seem to be necessary (don't see what role it plays in terms of either flavor or texture).

I had lots of fresh asparagus and a bag of large cooked shelled shrimp.  I split the butter and used half olive oil to saute.I increased the garlic to taste and used almost a pound of asparagus. I defroasted,drained the shrimp and added them with the asparagus at the end and warmed through with juice of a lemon, bit of lemon zest salt and lots of fresh ground pepper. Topped with the cashews...toasted,yummy!

Wow! Couldn't stop eating this, family loved it also.The only things I changed were the toasted cashews and the rice, I used raw, chopped cashews as they are easier to digest and I only had basmati rice but, the results were wonderful. Thank you.

This turned out really good, but could have used a tad more flavor.  I used chicken broth since I didn't have vegetable and I used almonds in place of the cashews.  I roasted the asparagus in the oven as opposed to boiling it and toasted my almonds in a little butter.  My husband who is picky about rice had 2 helpings.  Glad I tried this one.  Thanks Sandy

Very good. Three members of our party thought they didn't like asparagus but changed their minds after sampling this. I don't know how the left overs were because there weren't any. I used about twice as much veg. stock as called for because the Jasmine rice kept soaking it up.

We loved this rice dish.  We used peas instead of asparagus - frozen peas thrown in with the rice 10 minutes before the rice was done.  We omitted the nuts to lower the fat content.

A big thank you to Sabrinatee for submitting this recipe. I did roast the asparagus first however a NOTE TO SELF will only do so next time AFTER the rice is cooking. Used chicken stock and not as much butter. Would be fine to use orzo but angel hair pasta is what I had and what I used. PERFECT! Saying that this tastes like rice a roni is insulting. I had it with the Fish with Maille (R) Dijon Originale  from this site. It was the perfect side dish. 5 Star all the way! Will play with it with broccoli and almonds if I am in a pinch but tonight the asparagus and cashews were spot on!  Made just enough for DH & I with a small amount of left overs for tomorrow. Will need to double if ...or shall I say WHEN I make this for company! No way it will serve 8!! as it stands.  4 yes 8 n0!

12/10/14: Excellent!  I used gluten free corn spaghetti to keep this gluten free, and I used white asparagus.  Just the right amount of crunch from the cashews and firm asparagus.  Delicious!  8/9/16 update: i have made many times now. Its great with veges other than asparagas too, and even without the veges or cashews for that matter... Just a nice way to make your own rice-a-roni!

Wow...AWESOME.  The only exceptions to the recipe were barley for rice and vegetarian chk'n paste for the stock.  I discovered that the only thing better than this recipe itself is spritzing a little lemon juice on the pilaf upon serving, and that chilled leftover sweet grilled vegetable kabobs make a complimentary side for an easy full vegetarian dinner.  This will be a summer staple, thank you!

I started off by following the recipe pretty much exactly.  The only change was that I cut down on the butter, like others had suggested.  When the pilaf was ready to have the veggies added (I added broiled green pepper, zucchini, and fresh mushrooms) and roasted cashews, the taste was extremely bland. I then began to up the garlic, salt, and pepper just to get 'some' amount of flavor.  Took a long time to make it palatable, and for what should really be a side dish, it was a bit too much work.  When it was served, I was told that it wasn't horrible, but never to make it again.

We really liked this one.  I have a few suggestions for improvements.  Add the broth slowly as you may not need as much as the recipe suggests.  It depends on how old the rice is and the kind of pasta or spaghetti that you are using.  When I made this I did not use the full amount and it was perfect.  Also, I think it looks nicer if the asparagus and cashews are in smaller pieces.  I broke the cashews into smaller chunks and cut the asparagus into 1 inch pieces.  Finally, watch the sodium of the stock.  I would recommend a low sodium one.

We loved this!!  I did make, what I would consider, minor substitutions.  I used orzo for the broken spaghetti, chicken broth for the vegetable broth, and toasted almonds for the cashews.  My asparagus was thicker than I’d have liked, so I cut the really thick pieces in half lengthwise which worked well for me.  A nice change from plain rice and another great way to enjoy asparagus.  A definite do again!

very good recipe the only change that I made was instead of spaghetti I used orzo, also I did have to add additional broth and it was cooked in 15 mins, but probably due to the gas not going low enough wish I had a simmer ring on my cooker oh and I also dry roasted the cashews before adding

I'm sorry, but for the effort this recipe takes to make sure the noodles don't get too brown, the onions and garlic don't get too brown, and the rice doesn't burn, it just wasn't worth it. Not only that, but 10 minutes into cooking the rice on LOW and all of the broth was already soaked up and the rice wasn't cooked all the way and was sticking to the bottom of the pan. I had to add another 1 1/2 cups of broth just to get cooked through. Also, cutting the asparagus into 2 inch pieces is ridiculously too big. Half that would have been a more manageable size. Overall, it turned into a big pot of gelatinous glop that wasn't worth the time or cost of the Jasmine rice and asparagus out of season.

This was really good as a finished product.  I must be the world worst rice cooker because I ended up needing about double the liquid, but it still turned out great.  I did use chicken stock instead of veggie.  To everyone claiming this is bland, the instructions say salt and pepper to taste.  If it is bland add some salt.  I followed the directions and browned the pasta first, but next time I would do the rice first, I was afraid the pasta was going to burn.  The bottom line is, we all liked it and we will be making it again.

The overall taste is good, but its too buttery if you follow the recipe exactly. Next time I make this, I'd either lessen the butter OR I'd add some mushrooms and celery to the initial sautee, to add more flavor AND to soak up some of that butter.

I used almond slivers because it was all I had. Toasted them for a minute or two in a dry pan. Reduced the butter to 1 Tbs. Used shallots instead of onions and garlic. Absolutely delicious!

Loved this recipe and I'll make it again. I did roast the asparagus and because I was making it for a large amount of people I used some mushrooms too. If you top it with some Parmesan or some sharp cheddar it will taste even better. Thank you for the recipe.

I registered with allrecipes today just so that I could write a review for this recipe.  I use this site often but this recipe inspired me to write.  This was so good.  I used almost a cup of diced onions and chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  Also, I used almonds instead of cashews.  My boyfriend and I each had this twice today already...all of it is gone!  Delicious!  It isn't particularly gourmet, but it is easy and a wonderful side dish.  We had ours with roasted salmon with mango salsa.  YUM!

I was looking for something to do with rice and broccoli to go with my ginger sesame salmon.  Someone on the Recipe Exchange suggested this one, subbing my broccoli for the asparagus.  It was perfect!  Even my 12-year-old daughter who "hates" rice gobbled it up.

I thought this was really good-ate all the leftovers... I followed the instuctions exactly and had no problems with threcipe. I follow a primarily vegetarian diet and I think with a soup or salad it would be substantial enough for a vegetarian entree.

This is really good. I gave  it  four  stars  just because I felt it  was  a  bit bland on  it's  own.  I followed  someone  else's suggestion to add  feta  -  and it was  amazing! Thanks!

This one sounded a little weird - spagetti and rice together?  But I was looking for a way to use up extra asparagus and all ingredients were on hand.  Wow! The whole family LOVED it! I added extra cashews and didn't have jasmine rice so I used regular but otherwise made it exact.

Wonderful. I subbed peas for asparagus. Much cheaper. Don't forget to break the spaghetti into small pieces otherwise you can't stir them around in the butter. Also, reduce the heat after you put the lid on, otherwise there's not enough liquid.

Instead of spaghetti, I chopped up leftover cooked angel hair pasta, and sauteed it with the asparagus, onion, and garlic.  I then added long-grain white rice and the seasonings, and cooked it all in chicken broth.  Delicious!

This recipe is delicious! I used a little extra broth because it did cook up FAST. I only ended up cooking the "mixture" for about half of the time. Great dish to serve with a nice salad (spring mix if my favorite). I served this pilaf at my boyfriends family gathering and almost every single person there loved it and asked for the recipe! I recommend using Swanson broth as well (other broths have failed me with this recipe). Also, I found that using frozen asparagus works out better if you don't like the crunch of fresh (or the price). The last time I made this recipe, I only had frozen from Trader Joe's. I steamed it for about 8 minutes and it was perfect! (It was also only $1.99 compared to $5 and up). When it's cooking, make sure you keep stiring it so it cooks evenly and does not burn. Make sure you do add pepper to it and a little salt (although it's not necessary since the broth is loaded with sodium).

Excellent!  Watch it carefully, you will probably have to add at east 1 cup of extra chicken or veggie broth.  I almost burned my up because the liquid was gone too fast.  Make sure to break up the pasta into small bite-size pieces.

I have made this recipe twice now, both times I had to add 2 cups more of veg broth. The rice absorbs the broth  within the first 5 minutes. uckily I had the extra broth on hand. Other wise, it is an excellent recipe.

This has become one of our alltime favorites.  It's very flavorful and easy to make.  I don't toast the noodles first.  I just add them in before you cover and simmer and it turns out great.  Highly recommend this recipes.  Also, I've replaced the asparagus with green bean or peas depending on what I have on hand.

This can be great with some minor adjustments.  I used shallots instead of onions, because I had them.  I also roasted the asparagus (you can do ahead) and toasted the cashews.  With these changes, five stars.

This is so dilicious- Ive been telling all my family and friends about it and they love it too. Made without asparagus and it was still great. Cant wait to make it again. It does absorbe the liquid very quickly so it helps to use a smaller pan so the rice can cook.

Delicious!  Since fresh asparagus is expensive right now, I used canned asparagus.  While it's not as good as fresh, it's still delicious.  Just made it for a Christmas potluck, and will definitely make it again!

I was impressed with the flavor combo! I prefer the texture and flavor of sauteed asparagus and it's just as easy. I cooked it over medium heat with some olive oil and garlic for a few minutes and added that instead. The little bit of extra flavor helped make it as good as it was. I think I'll also chop the cashews a little and toast them the next time. The raw ones just didn't do it for me.

This recipe is just TOO good!  Didn't have asparagus so I threw in a handful of frozen peas toward the end.  This is great with or without the cashews or vegetables.  I can see that a lot of fun can be had with this one...lots of variations to play with.  Yummy!

This is now my favorite rice side dish. It's good even without the asparagus--for you vegetable haters! I use low sodium chicken broth, and regular rice works fine if you don't have jasmine.

This rice was awesome! The flavors went together very well. I used brown rice instead of Jasmine, so my cooking time was increased. I'll be adding this to my favorites. Thanks Sany!

This recipe is excellent! It has a wonderful flavor. I decided to use brown rice instead of jasmine. I adjusted the cooking time but found that there wasn't enough liquid to fully cook the brown rice. Next time I will use brown minute rice. Even with partially cooked rice this was awesome, so I know it will be even better next time. With every bite my husband and I said "mmmm..." It really is delicious! One thing to note: the recipe calls for 2 1/4 cups of broth. Most cans of broth are 2 cups - I just added a litte water to make it 2 1/4 c. so I wouldn't waste another can of broth. I also steamed the aspargus in my vegetable steamer.

My family really liked this pilaf. The second time we made it, we didn't have asparagus. So we used peas and broccoli instead. It was very good. I think you can cut the butter in half and still enjoy this dish.

Great dish. I too couldn't stop eating this. Things I did a bit differently: I steamed the asparagus vs boiling it, I put the cashews under the broiler for a few minutes to toast the nuts, and I cut the butter to 2 TBS vs 4 TBS, and that was more than enough. I served this with some leftover ham slices and it was a perfect meal. Husband loved it.

Even though I kind of screwed it up a little it was still good.  Be careful when lightly browning the spaghetti, it burns easy.  I used a corningware dish to cook everything in.  Had to make a second batch of spaghetti after burning the first batch.  I cooked the rice mixture with everything except the broccoli and almonds which I added when serving it.  I think I had the rice on too high of a temperature because all the liquid was gone and there was still 8 minutes of cooking time left.  I took it off the burner and just let it sit for the remainder of the time.  It was still flavourful but dryish.  I will probably try it again with the cashews and asparagus (when the asparagus is in season) and keep a closer eye on the rice.  A very low simmer.  Michele, Cambridge, Ontario

This was wonderful! I have made a pilaf similar to this for years using button mushrooms & chicken broth. I like this much better. It's fast, easy & foolproof! I used Fideo (vermicelli) instead of the spaghetti and served it at a dinner party. Everyone asked for the recipe! Thank you so much!

From all the other reviews and as a vegetarian, I was excited to see how this recipe would turn out.  The ingredients are quite expensive, but I thought this would taste wonderful.  However, my husband and two children tasted it once, and threw their helpings away.  I thought it was OK, but very bland.  Certainly not worth the hour long time investment to make a "side dish". Needless to say, I was disappointed with this recipe.

I liked this recipe. I used basmati rice instead of jasmine rice and I also used cut vermicelli instead of spagetti but I don't think that affected the taste. The garlic and vegetable broth were a great change from the typical no-spice/chicken broth rice that I usually cook.

I was caught in a rush, and I didnt have time to go get fresh asparagus, so I substituted mushrooms that I sauteed with the onion, garlic and butter, and chicken broth for the vegetable broth, and it still turned out fantastic.  I added a bit extra garlic but otherwise followed the directions exactly...This is a definite keeper, Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful side dish.  I cut the asparagus to 1" pieces rather than 2" (Just personal preference).  Even my somewhat picky 15 year old daughter loved it!

I made this dish as directed and it was sooooo blah!  I used slivered almonds instead of cashews.  Is that what made it so boring?  So here's what I did to fix it.  I added a quarter pound of fried proscuitto!(tell the butcher not to cut it too thinly as you will be using it for cooking) Cut the proscuitto into pieces, fry in a frying pan until crispy.  Then I also added a bunch of scallions, cut to (but not including) the white part.  Those two things were perfect additions and rescued my dish.  What a relief.

Love this recipe!!!! I have made it exactly as written and found the perfect balance with omitting butter and using a dash of pure olive oil to brown the rice and spaghetti. I roast the asparagus and cashews at 350 while the rice is simmering. It is truly a wonderful dish and I get SO many raves from all. Thanks Allrecipes.

This was just okay for me. Personal preference...because the pilaf and asparagus are prepared separately and stirred together at the end, I would rather have my usual brown/wild rice mix with asparagus on the side. I followed the recipe except to follow the liquid/rice ratio on the back of the bag of rice, decrease butter to 2T, increase onion to 1/2 cup, and increase the asparagus to almost one pound (pre-trimming). For meal-planning purposes, I would consider this dish a starch and a vegetable. As written, to me, it's five servings...nowhere near eight.  I appreciate the recipe and glad I tried it, but won't make again just personal preference.

I accidentally bought vegetable soup instead of stock and it still came out great!  I just had to add extra water.  My husband loves it and he's a meat & potato kind of guy!  Recipe makes a lot, but I think the leftovers will make a really good lunch.

Excellent recipe; we loved it! I think the person who compared it to Rice a Roni didn't do something right, didn't use Jasmine rice, or whatever. This is way, way above anything you can get in a box and best of all, there's no chemical additives!

I'd give this recipe 3 1/2 stars if I could. It was really not spectacular, but at the same time there is nothing in it that would suggest it would be a mind-blowing meal, so I don't want to give it a low rating. It was good but not great (I did cut back on the butter as suggested by the reviews). Basically, if you made some nice jasmine rice and broiled some great asparagus on the side, the resulting meal would be almost the same and you'd save yourself some time and ingredients. If I'm craving asparagus and rice, I will do that next time instead making this meal. But I would definitely recommend that one try this recipe out since it might just be the taste you're after. (I'm a vegetarian.)

OMG! My whole family couldn't keep from complimenting this dish!  I followed the suggestion of others and reduced the butter to about 2 TBL, didn't have jasmine rice so used regular white rice, used salt free garlic & italian seasoning since didn't have garlic and chicken broth (from bouillon) instead of vegetable broth because didn't have any.  The fresh boiled asparagus pieces and cashews made this recipe fabulous!  Used half cup of chopped onion but omitted the extra salt - still came out fabulous!  Family of 5 enjoyed and 2 family members took 2nds - so yeah, could have been made for "8" but hubby said double recipe for leftovers would be appreciated in the future!!

Was not my favorite and you have to be really careful when cooking the spagetti and onions. I burnt them. I am sure if i had not burned them it would have been better but overall not a favorite.

This was quite good. Like other reviewers, I did think the recipe as written came out a little greasy. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will reduce the butter and possibly broil/season the asparagus first.

This was SUPER yummy! Would def make it again. I took the other posters suggestions and only used 2 TBSP of butter (we use Earth's Balance) and it was wonderful. The only thing about it, which is really weird, is that is smelled HORRIBLE while it was cooking lol. IDK what it was, but it tasted great haha

Okay, will probably make again. I used vegetable broth I had made and low sodium cashews. I should have added more salt to balance and enrich the flavor.

LOVE THIS! Made it three times this week for guests! Way too much butter in the recipe, I just used a couple tbs. olive oil, and it was plenty. I used Wheat speghetti, and definitely brown the rice first, then add the speghetti and brown it. I broiled the asparagus for about 5 min. then broiled the cashews too for just a couple minutes. So good!

Really yummy, but a little heavy on the asparagus if you want it to be a pilaf side dish (as opposed to a vegetarian entree) and a lot of work to prepare.

SOO GOOD, I find its better with the powdered chicken broth, instead of "fresh" out of the box stuff. You can add more flavour by making the broth stronger. Always look forward to the leftovers too.

I changed a lot about this recipe so I don't know what the original version would taste like but it was a great starting point for me. I subbed quinoa for the rice and used whole wheat spaghetti. I roasted asparagus, zucchini, and shiitake mushrooms at 450 for about 30 minutes before adding them to the finished pilaf. I used cooking spray instead of butter and upped the garlic to two cloves.

This was a great recipe.  I fixed this for hubby and two friends and they raved about it.  Personally, it was great but not a five star for me.  I used all the ingredients, but I did take the advice of a couple of others and broiled the asparagus for 3-4 minutes on a cookie sheet that is foiled lined and greased.  Sprinkle the asparagus with salt and pepper and some garlic powder.  Broil the cashews for 1 minute (no longer as they will darken).  Thanks for a great recipe.

I liked this a lot - it's a great side dish that is easy, especially when cooking other side dishes/entrees.  It consists of household ingredients.  I cut the serving size in half, and still cooked the rice mixture for 20 minutes to get to the final, cooked consistency.  I added more asparagus.

Great and easy! To save time, I cooked the asparagus first, then set it aside and used the same pot for the rice. Also used pasta nests instead of spaghetti (b/c that's all I had). Turned out DE-LISH.

This recipe is awesome and easy! Because my husband is a meat eater I added pre-cooked grilled chicken, tasty and easy. I use chicken broth when making the pilaf and used olive oil instead of butter. With the asparagus mixture I added chicken, seseame oil, garlic, soy sauce, and chicken broth. Satued all together and pour over the pilaf mixture it's Delicious!!!

I have made this recipe tons of times
now.  It's easily one of my favorites plus I can feed it to vegetarians.  The only thing I would recommend is cutting back a bit on the butter.  Don't get me wrong - mmmm butter! but it was too much of a good thing for me.

This was absolutely delicious! I left out the minced onion and added crumbled feta cheese. Paired very nicely with some blackened salmon and a few fresh tomatoes. There was plenty leftover, and it tasted just as great reheated.

I make this ALL the time. I'm so glad I found this recipe! It's an easy one-pot meal, but I usually steam my asparagus separately. 

I have also traded the cashews for pine nuts or almonds, tried different broths for the rice, and added random herbs. Great recipe to vary up, and great as-is.

Having read all the raving reviews, I was quite disappointed by the blandness and dryness of this dish. It's ok for a side (although not worth the time nor the money) but certainly not as a vegetarian entree.

Totally 5 stars! Some people had problems with the liquid evaporating, and that is because the directions do not say to REDUCE TO SIMMER after covering the rice. Do take care to do that. I used peas instead of asparagus, and only 2 TBSP butter. So good.  This reheats well and will definately be a regular at the dinner table.  For leftovers, don't add all the nuts at once as they will not stay crunchy- Add a sprinkle each time you reheat.

I made 4 servings, but it seemed it didn't call for enough veggie broth.  I tasted the mixture once the intial broth amount was absorbed, i still had hard rice and the spaghetti. I added more broth (eyeball it), mix really good make sure the spaghetti is submerged (next time i will break into smaller pieces) and reboil it and simmer a little longer.  Adding the addl broth took away the onion and garlic flavor. Next time I will add more onion and garlic.  Also, since ours came out a little bland we put some soy sauce on it.  I think next time instead of using table salt i will try using soy sauce. Also didn't have any cashews so i used a pack of honey roasted peanuts, just as good. Its a keeper.

This is an incredible dish.  I roasted the asparagus as suggested & used lightly salted cashews.  My vegatarian guest and meat loving husband ate every last bit.  This recipe will definitely be a regular in my menu planning.  It's a MUST try!!

Excellent!  My only changes were to use chicken stock and I sauted the cashews with the onions and garlic and left out the spaghetti.  It was quick and very good.  Definately make again.

Really good!  I needed a vegetarian recipe and this really came through--the cashews made it great.

I don't know how to cook but am trying to learn and was pleasantly surprised at how this dish turned out. Used chicken stock, whole wheat spaghetti and whole cashews. When I was buying the cashews I worried that the salted ones would make the dish too salty but couldn't find unsalted. Worked out perfectly though - even with double the amount. Great dish and I feel like I could impress company with it. (Especially friends who are used to me nuking dinner.)

This was really good - I had to increase the liquid and didn't have enough broth left so I added some extra water and a chicken bouillon cube.  Thanks for the recipe, I'll definately make this one again.

I make this a couple times a month, and almost always for company. Everyone loves it, from my 2-year-old to my grandpa. Definitely one of the best recipes on Allrecipes.com! You can easily substitute broccoli or green peas for the asparagus, if you want, and while jasmine rice is superior, regular rice can work in a pinch. Excellent excellent recipe.

Made this dish as part of the first dinner I cooked for my boyfriend and he LOVED it.  (I'm a beginner cook, so that says a lot about this recipe).
Changed the serving size to 4 and we almost polished it all off.  Very yummy indeed.  :)
Modifications to the recipe: halved the butter, cooked the rice for 3 minutes (not 5 min) before adding in chicken stock, needed to add an entire can of chicken stock -- else the rice would have burned, added half a red bell pepper (sliced) about 15 minutes through the cooking process.  Threw in the asparagus and cashews at the end... it looked beautiful and tasted fantastic!
Next time, will double the onions and maybe substitute broccoli for asparagus (just to see how it will taste all together).
Paired the dish with Broiled Tilapia Parmesan (highly recommend) and it made for a great meal.  This such a tasty and fool-proof side dish, definitely a keeper.

This rice was excellent!  It was my first time making a pilaf and it came out great. Even my 3 picky kids ate it who usually don't even eat asparagus but the asked for seconds and thirds!!  I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly.  I changed the following:  1)instead of 1/4 cup butter, I used a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of olive oil. 2) I fried the asparagus in garlic and a little olive oil instead of boiling it.  3) added a lot more garlic (we are garlic lovers).  I have made this rice two times in the last week and have use both vegetable broth and chicken broth and both are great!  This will definitely become part of our rotation as a side dish.  Thanks for sharing.

I'm low-carbing so I couldn't indulge, but my husband hasn't stopped eating this YET!!! I made it as a vegetarian main course and he said it's GREAT (irresistible to be exact).  I found it hard to season on the back end as directed, so I'll layer the seasoning next time.  I added the asparagus as the rice and pasta cooked so it would be tender.  It came out perfectly and not overcooked.  I also doubled the amount of cashews.  I'll also finish w/butter next time and sautee initial items in EVOO.  That should give it a more pilaf-like finish.  Yummy and fast, that's a win-win!!!

Excellent, it tastes exactly the same as a rice served in a local Middle East restaurnt and I always loved that rice, now I can make it at home.  I dont use the asparagus.

Great recipe! I found it be flavorful and a fancy presentation. My whole family really enjoyed the flavor. I did not think it was bland at all. I did have to add extra vegetable broth because it cooked out before the dish was finished. I sauted the asparagus in olive oil and garlic. This was a dish I was proud to serve to my family, and will make again and again in the future.

This is a superb recipe - I followed it to the "t" and was amazed at how the ingredients complimented each other - the best flavor of all the items were really brought out.  I made this as a side dish with marinated, grilled walleye - it was a great combination.

It was really very good, however, the previous reviewers were right about too much butter. I will cut down by a table spoon or two next time. I didn't have jasmine rice, so I just used a box of Uncle Ben's Chicken and Wild Rice.... and threw in the seasoning packet too.  It turned out great. I used about 4 oz of pasta, and also sauteed my asparagus in a little olive oil and balsamic vinegar.

This was very good and easy to make.  I will probably cut back on the butter next time for a healthier dish.  I have also made this with slivered almonds, which I think I prefer.

This is sooo good, I made it without the cashews and added a bay leaf to it while it simmered. It was delicious and makes the whole house smell good. I have also made it plain with out the asaragus and it is still good.

Absolutely wonderful. I've made this weekly since finding the recipe.  Sometimes I leave out the asparagus. Peas are also good in it.  The leftovers don't make it to the next day. The side dish I've been looking for.

This is a great recipe, nice change from just plain rice. The first time I made the recipe as is. Last night, I used plain white rice, doubled the onion, added some sesame oil,toasted sesame seeds, soy sauce, and leftover lemon chicken for a complete meal, so it's really versatile.

I was hesitant to feed this to the bf who is not fond of rice pilafs at all but he kept saying how good the rice was! No cashews in the house so I threw in some slivered almonds instead. Also I had to use a red onion and chicken broth (low sodium). The red onion turned out to be a bad idea since it turned grey after simmering so long - just a warning to any other novice cooks like me :) When I collect the correct ingredients, I will make this recipe as it was intended - many times.

Quick, easy and delicious; even better with chicken broth.  Steam rather than boil asparagus.  When cooking just a few servings, increase the broth to prevent the pilaff from drying out before it is cooked.

This was sooooo good!  I cooked the rice mixture for 15 min. covered.  It was just the right consistency.  I used chicken stock instead of veg.  Just a personal preference.  We added some leftover grilled chicken on top.  Very light and flavorful.

Great side dish.  I had to use chicken broth and toasted slivered almonds (what I had on hand).  I definitely want to try it with the cashews.

I really liked this a lot. I used pine nuts instead of cashews, and it really complimented the flavor. I also added fresh ground pepper and freshly grated parmesean cheese after cooking. YUM!

I wasn't quite sure how much 2 oz. of spaghetti was, and I didn't know how much to break it - in half?  In thirds?  I broke it in half, and it was kind of strange to me to be in a rice dish.  I used only 1 Tbl of butter to cut down on the fat.  I would suggest toasting the cashews, as others have commented.  I did like the flavor though.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy! This is a great recipe, although you can feel confident in decreasing the amount of butter by half. I've made it a few times now and it tastes a lot better without so much butter.

This recipe was extremely delicious.  I used wheat spaghetti instead of regular spaghetti and pine nuts instead of cashews and lots of salt and pepper.  Bravo!! Will definately make again!

A very good pilaf!  I had to use broccoli instead of asparagus.  One store didn't have any and at the second store it was shriveled up. Couldn't find any jasmine rice either so I used basmati. Still an excellent rice mix that is versatile and goes with several vegetables.

This is a good recipe...a twist on just plain rice or rice with veggies. I made the peas and almonds with good results but added a couple of tbsp. of dehydrated vegetable flakes for additional colour. Next time I'll try the aspargus and cashew. Thanks.

This recipe was outstanding.  We didn't have asparagus so I added peas. My 5 year old loved it and I had to force myself to stop nibbling at it after dinner. Many thanks to Sandy T.

Very good!!! I did substitute chicken broth for the vegetable broth though and I didn't have any spaghetti on hand so I used angel hair.  This pilaf is fluffy, not at all like a sticky rice.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for this recipe.

I made this to go with Broiled Tilapia Parmesan tonight and it was a winner.  I didn't add the cashews because I didn't have any.  (We didn't miss them and I would not add them next time either.)

I used seasoned vegetable bouillon cubes for the broth. It was a huge hit, served as a side dish to roast beef. I think I would use a bit less butter next time, just because I'm always concerned about fat content and would like to use this recipe often.  It would also be great with a variety of veggies, depending on the season/availability.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This was SOOOO good.  The only changes I made was I added a half a red pepper that I sauted with the onions and a very generous sprinkling of crushed red pepper in lieu of the regular pepper because we like things to have a little bite.  This is going to be a regular addition to our vegetarian line up.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Loved this recipe. Used a suggestion from another reviewer and used orzo instead of the broken spaghetti. I also roasted the asparagus and cashews. And since I had it on hand, I added 1/2 a roasted green pepper. Loved the combination of roasted veggies with the toasted orzo.

I made this years ago. I’m so happy I found the recipe. I have made it adding shrimp at the last 5 minutes or so. Also have used chicken broth in place of the vegetable added cooked chicken breast cubed and browned mushrooms for a easy complete meal.

Pretty good rice side dish. I made some minor changes. I sauteed the asparagus in a pan 1st ( I had half a package of mushrooms that needed to be used, so I added that to the asparagus). Once they were tender crisp, I removed from the pan and set aside. In  the same pan I proceeded with the pilaf as directed, except by using olive oil instead of butter. I added the veggies and nuts to the rice and served with some roasted chicken leg quarters.

This was very good. Made this today as a side to lamb and ham for Easter. The taste and aroma were nutty, sweet, and earthy from the cashews and asparagus. Ran out of vegetable broth, so used chicken broth for 25% of the total broth. When plating, I scraped the rice at the bottom of the saucepan and sprinkled the caramelized, brown bits on top as garnish and a bonus flavor. Everyone commented on how good the rice was before going for seconds.

This is delicious.  I used broccoli because the asparagus at my market did not look good.  The flavor and texture of the jasmine rice is wonderful.  I will use this as a side dish and also as a vegetarian lunch.  As another reviewer noted, I had to add more broth at the half-way point since all the moisture was already absorbed but the end result was fluffy rice.

Really good but I made a few changes. Used half of the butter required as suggested by others, added extra water as needed when cooking the rice because the broth wasn't nearly enough and used broccoli rather than asparagus to suit my kids taste. I also served it with tofu for added protein since we are vegetarian. Great recipe overall that you can modify to your liking!

Quick and easy, and very tasty rice side dish.  I broiled my asparagus with a bit of EVOO and a sprinkling of salt, pepper and onion powder, @500 degrees for 5-6 mins total.  I did add 1 cup more water to the recipe than required (I also increased the servings to 12 so that we can have leftovers for lunch tmrw).  Used my nice big Le Creuset dutch oven for this one, and when the rice was just finished absorbing most of the liquid (10 mins or so after adding water) I turned off the burner and covered the pot and left it to steam.  Worked perfectly to avoid the rice burning and sticking to the bottom of the pot.  Will definitely make this again!

The first time making this, I did not make any changes and thought it was really good, although maybe a tad too greasy.  I also needed much more liquid than the recipe stated,  so I kept adding broth until the dish was done.  Next time,  I will follow the recommendations from others and will half the butter as well as broil the asparagus and cashews as I thought they didn't add quite as much flavor as they could have. Overall a really good and flavorful recipe! I made this as a side to the Halibut white wine caper recipe from this side, but feel it would do better with a more "plain" dish such as a grilled steak to not confuse the flavors too much.

This was delicious! I did make a few adjustments that appealed to me. I added about 1.5 tablespoons of fresh chopped ginger, about 1/8 cup low sodium soy sauce. I increased the vegetable stock to 4 cups. Had to do this because otherwise, it was too dry. All and all, a great dish! I will make it again!

Mine was quite crispy on the bottom, so next time I will cook it less than 20 minutes.  I had used almonds instead of cashews because I had almonds and cashews were far too expensive.  It was good.

Simple yet had a great flavor. I think the browned spaghetti really added a certain deliciousness. I would suggest breaking the pasta into very small rice sized pieces. I only broke the pieces up into 1 to 2 inch pieces and thought they were too long.

This is a great recipe as a basis for any rice & veggy dish.  I will use this again! I only used 1 Tbs butter and a little  olive oil,  I added a little celery , a small carrot shredded & some chopped up spinach (all from my garden) along with the little bit of asparagus I had. It was very good. It reminded me of the rice dishes I ate when I lived in Israel.  I have been looking for a recipe I could use to recreate those dishes, they add any veggy they have on hand, and it almost always has some chicken in it! Next time I'll add the chopped up chicken,  cauliflower & some of the Mediterranean-style spices they used.  This is definitely a keeper for me,  it can be changed up so easy to whatever is on hand and it is very easy and tastes great!

I roasted the asparagus and lightly toasted the cashews.  I also used whole wheat uncooked spaghetti  and only 2 Tbs of butter. This recipe is one I'll make again, it's a comfort food dish.

I've made this twice and it's a great side dish. I too broiled the asparagus with salt, pepper and oil. Even though I couldn't put nuts in it due to an allergy in the family, people thought it tasted "nutty" anyway.

I actually think this is my favourite recipe I've tried from allrecipes. It's just so, so good. This will definitely impress whoever you serve it to. I was a little suspicious about browning uncooked spaghetti, but I was pleasantly surprised at the texture it adds. Give this a try!

I make this recipe all the time! Instead of spaghetti i use whichever small pasta i have on hand (orzo or ditallini, or sometimes stars). I also used kasmati rice or a medly of long grained rice and it really changes up the flavor, depending on what type you use. Ill make it without asparagus, too and it's just delicious!

I made this dish just before last Passover. Followed the directions to a T and it came out perfectly, and it was pretty easy to do so. I think I'm just not a huge fan of cashews.

The recipe is great, but I think that it has too much butter.  I didn't even try making it with the whole amount suggested because it was too much.  I only used 2 TBS and it was delicious.  I also had to add about a cup of water towards the ende because the broth was not enough.  Otherwise it is excellent.  That is the only reason for 4 stars, I wish they offered a rating of 4.5.

Was great! Fluffy, buttery, moist- I doubled it, had to use chicken bouillion cube, and I used walnuts cause I had them.  I liked it fine with the walnuts. Making it again, I would probably decrease the butter just a bit- very nice side dish, easy and not overpowering, a good accent to main course.

easy to prepare and delicious. I toasted the cashews and steamed the asparagus in advance. I used only 1 full can of vegetable broth and substitued white wine for the remainder.

This was a lot like rice-a-roni, but probably healthier since I can cut back on the butter and the salt.  I also added extra onion, chopped, and sprinkled green onions on top when finished.  I will probably make this again with mushrooms added.

My family loved this recipe and have asked for it again. I didn't use as much butter as called for and it was fine.

This is really delicious.  I cut the butter back by half and didn't miss it.  Broiled the asparagus and probably used more garlic than it calls for.  I accidentally added more rice than I meant to, so I added an extra 1/2 cup of chicken broth and 1/2 cup of chardonnay.  Served this with broiled scallops but this was so good that we didn't even want the scallops.

Loved this!  My husband went crazy over it too.  I don't eat wheat so I used rice spaghetti and it was just fine. Per my own preference I will probably use a different nut and toast them before adding but overall this was such a nice alternative to just rice or pasta.

I was really not expecting much of this....but it turned out fantastic! I don't usually like Asparagus, but it worked here. It's going to be a staple in our house!     The Jasmine rice is a nice addition.

I don't understand why this recipe has a high rating.  It just doesn't have much flavor.  I served it at a party and no one really liked it.  I think it needs more seasoning but not sure what.

This was a good meal....I served this as a main dish so I think next time I'll increase it by 1/2 since everybody wanted more.  I also found it was a little greasy, so I'll use less than 1/4 cup next time (I used margarine instead of butter).  I didn't need to cook the rice as long as the recipe stated...keep an eye on it so it doesn't turn to mush! (Mine only took about 15 minutes) Thanks!

Fantastic recipe - everyone I cooked it for loved it! I just used ordinary long-grain rice, as couldn't find jasmine rice, but it was still delicious. Apart from that, I made it exactly as directed and it was great. A firm favourite. I should also point out that I made it as a main course, not a side dish or starter, and you should bear in mind that, if you want to do this, it will NOT give you 8 portions - 3 or 4 is more realistic, depending on how hungry you are!

This was yummy!  I cut down the amount of butter as per suggested by others, used corn pasta to make it gluten-free and brown rice (b/c it's healthier) with 2.75 cups of veggie broth.  Very good!  Thanks for sharing..

FANTASTIC! I used less butter, roasted the nuts with paprika and cumin, and added a squeeze of lemon juice. I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, because that was all I had on hand. I followed the directions to a tee and it came out delicious! Thank you!

Delicious!  Heeding some other reviewers, I only used half the butter and it still turned out excellent.  Note: The original 8-serving yield must be for this as a side dish, because it barely makes 4 entree-sized portions.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I do use a lot less butter and it still tastes great.  I never even cared for asparagus until I tried this recipe a few years ago!  The flavors work well together.

I took the others' advice about using less butter, broiling the asparagus, and toasting the cashews. Turned out pretty good. I'd prefer if the mix had more asparagus and less cashews, easily fixable next time I make it! Also probably would be good with a variety of other veggies (spinach, peas&carrots, etc)

Very tasty.  2 1/4 cups of broth was not enough for me, I had to use 4 cups of broth.  I put the asparagus in the rice cooking pot in the last five minutes of cooking.

4.5 stars. This is a solid recipe. I've made it several times; tried it with brocolli and also just the rice (minus the asparagus). It's best with asparagus. The dish tastes great and tastes no time to prepare. The only reason it's not a 5 star recipe is because I can get same results (minus the chopping) from Rice-A-Roni... (but I won't... I like to chop :o))

I made the recipe as instructed, but I did need extra vegetable broth during cooking like (as did another reviewer) and halved the butter as many reviews recommended.  The butter really is too much as written, and 2 tablespoons seems to be a good amount.  Next time I will take others' suggestions and broil the asparagus and cashews, and I'm sure it will be even better.  It was good; I'll make it again!

Fabulous, delicious recipe! It even tasted better than I expected. I reduced the butter used and used whole wheat spaghetti. I tried to use less pans and put the asparagus in with the rice while it cooked but it did end up getting too cooked this way. Next time I'll use the extra pan and follow the recipe!

Wonderful.  The only thing I fould was that both times I made it I felt I needed to keep adding a little water because mixture was appearing too dry and I was afraid it would burn to the bottom of the pan before all ingredients were cooked through and ready to serve.  Yum.

We enjoyed this and I will serve it again, with some tweaks.  I ran out of liquid, so next time I would increase the broth (my noodles were a bit al dente still).  Also, I'll go with some extra chicken broth (I used that instead of vegetable broth).

This recipe goes great with grilled salmon 1 from this site but is delicious on it's own.  My husband usually doesn't care for rice pilaf but in this case was very complimentary and had two servings.

My family and I loved this!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used slivered almonds instead of cashews because I already had it on hand.  It was just very simple and delicious - great side to grilled chicken!!  Also, the asparagus makes it pretty enough to serve to guests.

Based on all these great reviews, I was really disappointed!  I had to add all kinds of seasoning just to make it taste okay...it wasn't terrible, but definitely not memorable either, I will not make it again.

This is excellent!  I use Edward & Son's all natural vegetable bouillon cube for the veggie broth. So yummy!

This is DELICIOUS!!!!  I made some substitutes:  instead of butter I used olive oil (just enough to coat the saucepan); instead of asparagus I used sweet baby broccoli; and I used spinach spaghetti instead of regular.  I too toasted the cashews like the other reviewers suggested and this dish came out awesome.

This was really yummy and I will try making it again.  Definately double the asparagus as there is a lot of rice.  My pilaf soaked up the liquid really quickly and I had to add extra water which compromised the taste a little - next time I would use more liquid to start with. I will definately try this again, it was my first ever pilaf and I'm sure I can do it better next time.

This was amazing.  Even my 4 year old son couldn't get enough.

I did however broil the asparagus with a little garlic salt and pepper over buttered flavor pam, and then broiled cashews I chopped on the same pan once the asparagus was completed.

Followed all other directions entirely.  This was amazing, the combination sounds a bit strange, but together it was a perfect combination.

We loved this, especially the noodles in with the rice.  As others have done, we substituted broccoli, celery, and zucchini for the asparagus since that's what we had on hand.  I think I will add a bit of sherry next time and/or perhaps some rosemary.  We'll definitely make this again.  This meets what I consider to be all the most important criteria: nutritious, attractive, relatively easy, and delicious.

Great rice pilaf recipe.  Used peas and slivered almonds instead , that's just what I had on hand.  Needed to use about 1/3 c more liquid and also halved the butter.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was very good.I only used 2 Tbls.of butter, which was plenty, & 1/4c. orzo instead of spaghetti since I didn't have any. Didn't have asparagus either so subbed broccoli which I stir-fried with a little oil, adding crushed cashews at the end. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable.Followed the cooking instructions as written & added parsley to finish. Very good,similar to rice a roni.

This was phenomenal!
I sub'd Campbells canned Onion Soup instead of veg broth, and was amazed at how good and quick this was to prepare! 
I microwaved the asparagus for 2 min., chopped it up and threw it in. Looking back, I should have toasted the cashews. Excellent reheated too!

Recipe base was great!  I thought it lacked some flavor so I used the Garlic Asparagus recipe from this site to spice things up a bit.  Used Basmati rice and whole wheat angel hair.  Everyone loved it!

I made this recipe for 12 and didn't alter the INGREDIENTS.  My son referred to this as "the bomb".  Since I have given this to many friend who have reacted the same.  This is a perfect compliment for shish kabob.  Thank you for sharing

Perfect side dish.  Made for my friend who is lactose intolerant, so I omitted the butter and sub'd olive oil- Also, when I added the veg broth, I ended up using 2 cans, I added the 1 1/4 C the recipe called for, but that was absorbed quickly, so as I stirred the boiling mixture, I added bit by bit more broth.  This was fantastic!  Also, roasted my asparagus and toasted my cashews.

AMAZING! I love simple yet delicious recipes like this. I did reduce the butter to 2 Tbs, and used slivered almonds instead of cashews. Also, I roasted the asparagus instead of blanching. I think they have more flavor this way. I added the almonds to the pan with the rice so they'd get a bit toasty. Since I made so many changes, I gave this 4 stars.. But I will definitely be making this often. THANKS!

This was really good. I did use a little bit more vegetable broth (it wasn't enough). It was sooooo good after adding the asparagus. I wasn't a big fan of the cashews when I first put it in, but it tasted really good a day later when the nutty taste of the cashew wasn't overpowering.

This turned out pretty well, but could have used a bit more seasoning. I used my vegan butter and only 2 tbsp. I also added 1/4 cup of extra cashews (I love cashews!). It was pretty good, but I might add different spices next time I make it.

I have been making this for years. I gave the recipe to my chef Uncle who also serves it often. We also use orzo and roast the asparagus. I also toss in feta right before I serve. The warmth sets off the flavor and aroma of the feta -it's also a great texture/flavor addition. I can no longer imagine making this w/o the feta.

I've made this recipe twice now - once for my family and again for company. Everyone loves it! Cooks in half the stated time, so it's faster than you think. And I see how the other reviewers have encouraged experimentation with the ingredients; would do well with any veggie in the fridge, or with chicken or shrimp for meateaters. I do use a lot more vegetable stock than requested - three cans. Also, I use olive oil instead of butter. Really good.

The recipe is great as written.  I now make a version of this about once a month.  I double the recipe, and instead of asparagus I add a bag of frozen oriental vegetables.

This is honestly one of my favorite side dishes to make. Sometimes I add chunks of chicken and serve it with a salad for dinner. It has great flavor.

It's more like 4 1/2 to me.  I used Vermicelli instead of Spaghetti and chicken broth instead of vegetable (on accident.  We really liked it.  The crunchiness of the cashews was my favorite thing about this dish!  I would recommend it and will make it again!    Thank you Sandy!

i would have rated  this 3 and half stars. there just wasn't enough flavor, but the cashews competed the taste enough to be good -- but not great. also, the liquid really should be 2 and a half cups. the noodle are interesting, but i wonder if they are necessary, since they added nothing to the flavor. this might be better with orzo rice.

My family LOVES this recipe.  Even my 3 and 5 year old love it.  I often replace the asparagus with frozen broccoli, use regular rice, and use chicken broth.  It's a staple at our house.  Love it!!!

I thought this dish was fantastic.  The rice w. spagetti seemed a bit strange but it turned out purfect.  I had it as a vegetarian main dish and it doesn't serve 8 this way but great non the less.

I thought this was ok.  It was the first time I had jasmine rice so I may not be big on the flavor of that.  I'd like to try this again with white rice.  My family didnt really care for it.

This is a new favorite for our family. Very good. I use Orzo pasta rather than the spaghetti that the recipe calls for and I like it better that way (have tried the other way).

Probably the best rice I have ever made. I love asparagus, so I sometimes put about 50% more asparagus than the recipe calls for- but it is fantastic just the way it is.

this was ok. Just ok. I think it was rather bland... and I USED chicken broth, more garlic, etc etc. I subbed orzo for spag. And I did use jasmine rice. This is far from a bad dish... it is a good combo. It is... ok.

Delicious. I used 2 tbsp. olive oil in place of 1/2 of the butter - healthier. Also, I found I did not have to add any salt - the broth was salty enough. I sauteed the asparagus for a few minutes in olive oil and garlic - good idea. I did not use the spaghetti - it seemed strange to me and I couldn't wrap my head around spaghetti pieces in a pilaf, so I left them out. Also, I think the people that are saying you need more liquid must be using regular rice, because I had no problem with the amount of liquid - it was 
perfect.

This dish was so delicious and very easy. It definetly took about 2 times as much liquid. I swapped 1/2 C orzo for the spqghetti. I also added 1C peas. This is a very veresatile, light and delicious main or side. I will definetly use again. Thanks for a great one!

I liked this rice pilaf but will keep looking to find a better one.  I couldn't get jasmine rice at my market and maybe that would have made the difference.  Hoever, it was a tasty side dish and very easy to make.

Good - was a little bland, but it was a good combination of flavors. I didn't follow exactly - I cooked the rice in my rice steamer in chicken broth. I added about a cup of water to the spaghetti mix, and that was just the right amount. I also roasted the asparagus and cashews in the oven for a few minutes.

This was my first time making rice pilaf and it was pretty simple. I used almond slivers instead of cashews, but only because I had them on hand. I'll definitely be making this again in the future - but I will probably make the rice in the rice cooker instead of on the stove.

I was looking for a good rice side dish to serve for company. Glad I tried it first.  Bland.  And the ingredients and reviews suggested it would be great.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Would not make again.

Tasty! My husband raved about it. I didn't have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth instead and it tasted great.

I use orzo instead of the spaghetti, and saute the asparagas in a little olive oil and garlic. I have to double this recipe, because my three boys inhale it!

This is SO good!! I used Basmati rice and chicken bouillon (omitted salt).  Didn't have fresh asparagus, so used frozen and added some sliced fresh mushrooms and roasted red peppers. I toasted the cashews before adding. I will play around using different vegetables. This will be a staple when I want a great rice dish.  Thanks for a keeper!

We loved this!  Especially my daughter (who is not usually too keen on asparagus)...she told me that she couldn't wait to have the leftovers for lunch the next day!  The only change I made was to use basmati rice instead of jasmine (because that's what I had on hand).  Great recipe!

I thought this was pretty good.  I steamed the asparagus and that worked very well.  I was expecting great things from the reviews, and it wasn't THAT great to me.

I made this tonight to complement lemon rosemary chicken.  It was delicious!  Like others, I made substitutions for the ingredients I had on hand:  regular long grain rice,  and bullion for the broth.  I only used 1 Tb of butter in a non-stick pan, added more garlic and more asparagus, which I cooked with sliced lemon.  It came out delicious!  

We're cubing the remaining lemon chicken to add to this dish for lunch tomorrow!

Yum Yum Yum!  I cused chicken broth and reduced fat butter.  I used regular white rice because I didn't have jasmine.  When I was making it I thought "i should have just bouth rice a roni" boy, was I wrong. Ten times better than anything boxed.  I served this with Cajun Barbecubed chicken from this site and a side of corn.  We cubed the leftover chickne threw that and the corn into this rice dish and had wonderful leftovers.

This is a great dish. Recipe works well; I added 1/4 C chopped mushrooms and it was great. May add carrots next time, too - will definitely make again! Husband wanted a little soy sauce in it, but I thought it was good as is. Pretty buttery. Next time, I'll healthy it up a bit and reduce butter. Could add a tad white wine when sauteeing, too. YUM!

I made this dish as a vegetarian entree and served it with a salad for a light dinner.  I was out of Jasmine rice, so I substituted another long grain rice.  I also used half the amount of butter and instead used a combination of olive and coconut oil.  The spaghetti I used was whole grain. I also stirred in a little shredded coconut before serving...this helped make up for the lack of fragrant jasmine rice.  And we amped up the garlic and asparagus a little bit, along with a spot of cajun spice.  This dish had a great flavor and texture appeal.  It seems like wild rice would have been a fine substitute for the spaghetti.  We'll be making this again sometime, probably as a side dish.

Great Recipe!  The family ate the whole pot full.  Ive made it twice so far.  The second time i made it I tried half chicken and half vegteable broth but it wasnt as good.  So stick with all vegteable broth like the recipe has.  The only thing i did different was double the garlic and i added mushrooms.

Very excellent!  I used vermicelli and chicken broth---the only deviations from the recipe.  Served it with the Asian Beef Skewers from this site.  Got nothing but accolades.  Thank you for this terrific recipe.

I couldn't get enough of this!  I chop the nuts smaller now just 'cause that's my preference, but my husband loves it both ways.  I also use chicken broth instead of veggie broth.  But the recipe is great as is.  Yum!

Quick, easy and delicious. Had some trouble getting the rice sufficiently dry, but did it the traditional way the second time around and it was wonderful.

Great rice.  Next time I will scale this recipe down to half the amount.  This makes a lot of rice.  My Daughter could'nt get enough of it, she picked the cashews out though.

Great!! My family loved it and now am more a fan of Asparagus. Wouldn't change a think. Great with the Garlic Chicken recipe from this site.

This is so divine.  Makes a lot, but is great the next day.  Fancy but also suitable for the family.  Perfect if you're trying to impress someone!

My boyfriend couldn't stop complimenting my cooking skills.  I used some leftover white rice and added a little more spices.  Used brocoli instead of asparagus.

I was excited to see how this dish would turn out, as I am a HUGE fan of both asparagus and cashews.  I was disappointed to find the end-product bland tasting.  The asparagus and cashews (both roasted) tasted great together. However, I felt that the rice mixture needed another layer of flavor, as it benefited very little from the flavors of the vegetable stock. After adding more salt and pepper, I still felt like I was eating salty, bland rice.  Not a big hit with the rest of the family either. I probably won't make this dish again.

This dish has great flavor.  My mistake was making it up ahead of time and keeping it warm in the oven for about an hour.  The cashews became fairly soft during this time and I probably would have rated it 5 stars if I would have served it immediately.  For the same reason, it's probably not a great dish to make extra of for leftovers...  But it's definitely a keeper recipe and I'll make it again.

I liked this rice dish alot overall. I messed up a little and forgot to simmer the rice before boiling it, and I had to make my own veggie broth, but it still turned out yummy :).

This is my favourite rice pilaf recipe.  Delicious as is, and also very tasty with broccoli instead of asparagus.

Delicious!  I've never been a big fan of asparagus, but this dish was amazing!  I added chopped carrots and mushrooms to the rice mixture for more color and veggies.  This was perfect for my vegetarian friends, they even took some home.
