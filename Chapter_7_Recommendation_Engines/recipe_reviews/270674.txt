Excellent! Not too sweet and just perfect with a cup of coffee. I used two teaspoons of instant coffee along with a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips that I wanted to use up.  I also added some chopped almonds.  I didn't bother with the oiled foil, I simply shaped the dough on the cookie sheet like I usually do for biscotti.  They were a hit.
