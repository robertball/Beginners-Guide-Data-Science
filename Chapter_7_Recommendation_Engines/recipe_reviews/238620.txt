What a great way to change up the classic baked potato! This was much enjoyed and would be a great side to serve with steaks. I'd serve this one to guests too as it made a nice presentation! 5 stars from this house!

This was excellent! Because there are just two of us and because the potato was huge I made only one and cut the recipe to 1 serving. We ate this alongside leftovers of Chef John's Beef Stroganoff and a salad and we were happy campers. The only thing I did different was to use arugula rather than spinach because that's what I had on hand (and I LOVE the little bite of arugula!) and also because I love butter so much I added some to the bottom of the split potato before adding the sauce. Excellent! If you have just two of you to feed one 15 oz jar of Classico Fresh Alfredo Sauce is perfect for several meals. Just check out their recipes! You won't be sorry!

I realized until I saw this recipe that I have always been on the boring side when it comes to baked potatoes with the traditional sour cream butter and salt. We grilled up a couple of extra large russet potatoes so I had them ready for this recipe. Being as I only had 2 large potatoes I divided the rest of the recipe in half. Then accidentally used the whole jar of alfredo. It still worked fine! I made the sauce the night before. For some reason as it sat in the fridge it got thinner and not thicker. So this afternoon I made a roux to thicken it and that worked great. My only additions were a pinch of black pepper and garlic powder. I also added a large roma to the sauce in addition to on top. I like tomatoes and the color was pretty mixed in the sauce. My only issue is the saltiness. Although to the submitters credit no salt is added. I just find many bottled sauces salty tasting personally. I liked all of the fresh ingredients added to doctor up a regular or plain alfredo. It would work great on pasta too.

I went a slightly different route and used broccoli rabe instead of spinach. This is very rich and filling and I loved the slight bitterness of the greens with the lush sauce. Such a creative use of the ingredients. Thank you TFR

I love anything with Alfredo sauce! I love the twist on your average baked potato. It was like combining spinach dip and a baked potato. YUMMY!

This was such a great idea I can't believe I've never thought to do something like this before. Different but very filling and tasty. I did make a couple small changes but I believe they really added to it. I believe I used twice as many mushrooms Bertoli Classic Alfredo with Mushroom Sauce instead of Classico a 10oz bag of fresh spinach (instead of measuring out 6 cups) and I added 2 bags of Tyson precooked cubed chicken (just to make it a full meal) in between sauteing the mushrooms and adding the spinach. While I was wilting the spinach I gave it a few good sprinklings of garlic powder. These have already been requested as an upcoming meal at my house!

I give this recipe three stars. One star for creativity the second star for easy preperation and the last star for overall taste. My first suggestion would be to season your potato before dressing with the sauce (butter salt pepper ect). The second would be to thicken up the sauce with parmesean cheese. Or even better make your own alfredo sauce. I used the brand recommended and im sad to say it was awfully bland. I like a more cream cheese flavored sauce and this was nothing like what i had hoped.

Loved it! We have been trying to do 'Meatless Mondays' and this was the perfect fit! It was great tasting and very filling. A wonderful idea for a baked potato and I look forward to putting all kinds of pasta sauce on baked potatoes from now on.

This was fun to make and I thought it a nice break from "the usual" I did add bacon. My husband wasn't as excited as I was hence the 4 stars.

Had this last night. It was really good. It was also really easy to put together. I just used two baked potatoes and therefore I cut the sauce in half. Next time I will make the full recipe of sauce. I could have used more sauce. I put a little garlic in the mushroom/spinach mixture and since I was out of tomatoes didn't top with the tomatoes. I don't think the tomatoes would have added anything. Next time I won't add them either. Before I put the sauce on I put salt and pepper on the potato. Try it. You will love it. Husband couldn't quit saying how good it was all through the meal. I served it with a cucumber and radish salad. It was "meatless Monday".

I enjoyed this as a main dish by adding diced cooked bacon to the sauce mixture. I make my own alfredo sauce instead of buying a jar but other than those two differences I made this as directed. I do like to rub my baking potatoes with olive oil and sprinkle them with sea salt and fresh ground pepper before baking. Delicious!
