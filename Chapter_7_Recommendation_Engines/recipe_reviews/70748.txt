Very good for cold days! It was really good for the cold night I made it on too! I did add some more spice though!

Add a tablespoon of Season All and this is perfect. It's also very easy to prepare, freeze and cook later. I put the onion and meat mix together in one bag and the bean in a second bag and froze it to cook later. Worked like a charm

This was a good, quick, basic soup. I had to make a couple changes due to what I had on hand. I used 1 lb diced ham instead of the bacon and turkey. And I used diced tomatoes instead of puree. Both changes worked well. I ended up adding some garlic powder and hot sauce to flavor it a little bit more.
