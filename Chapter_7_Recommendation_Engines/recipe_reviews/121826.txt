Very Good!!  I did make some modifications as per other reviewers.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I cooked them completely and removed them to a warm oven.  I then sautéed the onion (I skipped the celery just because I wasn’t sure it would appeal to me in this).  I added just 1/4 cup chicken broth, but all of the remaining ingredients.  That way I didn’t have to reduce it for as long.  And, finally I added just a bit of cornstarch mixed with water to give the glaze some nice body.  It was wonderful and a beautiful color.  This is sweet, so be warned if you don’t like sweet chicken.  I would be tempted to add a little soy sauce next time, just to cut the sweetness a little, but still very good as is!  UPDATE: In thinking about the sweetness of this sauce, I'm now more inclined to use some dry white wine, rather than soy sauce to make this a little less sweet.  The wine won't discolor the beautiful sauce like soy sauce would.

I didn't have apple jam so I used some apple juice with corn starch mixed in and then added as said.  Delicious.

I didn't have the celery nor the apple jelly. So, I substitute the apple jelly for applesauce and added some corn starch.  My husband doesn't like onions and he ate it.  Great recipe, will do it again!

Awesome! I used boneless/skinless breasts that i hammered to be slightly thinner, and cooked it about 75% in the pan then placed it in the oven (375deg) to cook while I prepared the glaze.  Between mixing and reducing the glaze, it baked probably 10 minutes and was perfect.  I don't like onions, but added them (sweet onion) anyway.  The onion taste was very mild and blended perfect with everything else, so if you don't like them, add them anyway! Very simple, very good.

Exceeded my expectations!! I made this exactly as the recipe states and it was excellent!  I used bone-in chicken, and I definitely recommend it. I am concerned that boneless would get way too dry. P.S. Forget the cornstarch; the people who used that just aren't waiting long enough for the sauce to thicken!

Excellent Recipe!  The blend of onions, apple jelly, and orange juice truly compliment the chicken.  I've made this a few times, always with boneless chicken breasts.  Do NOT use thin sliced, they will get tough by the time the glaze thickens.  And definitely remember to cook uncovered.  Delicious with long grain wild rice and sugar snap peas (with glaze spooned on top!).

Chicken produces so much liquid, so I didn't use the chicken broth at all.  I still had to use a little cornstarch to thicken since I ran out of time.  On a whim, and the suggestion of another reviewer, I added about 1 Tbsp of white wine.  With leftovers, I cut up the chicken, stirred in cooked rice and took to a pot luck.  Everyone loved it!

This was so tasty! I didnt have any apple jelly so I used sugar free prange marmalade. It was so citrus-y, not lime or lemony like most recipes.

I don't usually rate a recipe that I have changed so much, but because this technique turned out fabulous, I thought I would rate it.  I used skinless, boneless chicken.  I didn't have apple jelly so I used Pepper jam.  I think this helped to reduce the sweetness other have mentioned.  I didn't have OJ so I squeezed a grapefruit, I didn't want to open broth for only 1/2 cup so I added extra grapefruit juice and a some of water.  It boiled down to a wonderful thick sauce. Sprinkled cilantro over chicken and  spooned the sauce over some rice.  Fabulous recipe!!!  Thanks for sharing.

I used my own applesauce instead of jelly, and added pineapple juice instead of orange juice. It was okay, but I think it needed lots more salt and could have used some other spicing. I thought it was bland overall. I think it's a good base, but it need a creative touch with spiced for sure.

Not too shabby.  I used apricot jelly because I didn't realize that I didn't have apple jelly until it was too late.  It was pretty tasty.  I made whole wheat egg noodles to compliment it, but I think it would have tasted better with couscous or rice.  The recipe?  EASY and good! :-)

Delicious, delicious, delicious!  Easy, easy, easy!  It doesn't get any better than this.  The recipe is SUPER easy on a busy night.  I LOVE sweet flavors with chicken, and the taste of the apple jelly was fabulous.  I would change one though - less chicken broth, more apple jelly (or add a little cornstarch to thicken at regular proportions).  The sauce was quite thin, but yummy nonetheless.  I served it with egg noodles and spooned the sauce over them too!!!!  GREAT RECIPE

Very easy and very good. I used homemade rose wine jelly and had good results. Next time I would reduce the sauce a bit to make it a little thicker. The chicken had flavor and the sauce was wonderful. We really enjoyed this recipe. Thanks

Amazing.  We were picking at the bones trying to get every last morsel.  The sauce tasted great on our mashed potatoes, too!  We'll definitely be making this, again!

This was delicious! I had to make some slight modifications because I could not find apple jelly anywhere, so I used apple butter instead and added a little extra orange juice and a teaspoon of cornstarch. Turned out great! Id make it again

Simple recipe and excellent flavor.  The apple jelly mixture however caramelized when it began to cool, making it difficult to eat.  I used regular grocery store jelly though which probably had too much sugar in it.  Perhaps try one with less sugar to minimize the 'creme brulee effect'

I can't believe no one has reviewed this recipe since 2011!!!  It has excellent taste although I used a different technique to get the glaze consistency.  I'm so glad a doubled the recipe even though there were no leftovers.  Not having chicken breasts, I used skinless, boneless chicken thighs tossed with a bit of garlic powder, browning them without butter in a non-stick pan.  I removed the chicken and kept it warm.  To the pan, I added 4 T. butter and cooked the onions  and celery (a must for this recipe!).   I then added 2 T. flour and cooked it for 3-5 minutes before adding the chicken broth.  Having discovered I was out of apple jelly, I considered pineapple preserves but then settled on red pepper jelly because it was already open.  I added everything else except the thyme (my mother isn't fond of it).  I returned the chicken to the pan and simmered it until the sauce was the correct consistency.  I served it over rice with Ken Shoe Green Beans also on this site.  Next time, I would add the parsley as a garnish or use green onions to garnish it for a prettier appearance.  Everyone said I should make this more often.  Thank you.
