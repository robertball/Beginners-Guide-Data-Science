I made this for my Spanish II class party.  I personally do not like flan, however, I got several reviews on how good this was.  Before making flan, I would advise reading the how-to on the mexican recipes main page.  It had many tips, like don't stir the sugar and to add a drop or two of lemon juice to it.  Also, it had more detailed instructions on how to make a proper water bath for the flan.  One woman, who lived in peru for 10 years, said that she usually flips her flan over right after it cools, then she chills it like that.  That way a lot less of the caramel sticks to the pan.  These tips made for a nice flan which was also moderately easy to prepare.

I have this same recipe from a cuban cookbook -- it's FANTASTIC and genuine.  It cuts well, yet is creamy.  One of a kind experience!  One hint for those who have a problem with it (such as the person who found it crumbly) -- switch the steps in the recipe.  First caramelize the sugar and pour into the pan, then allow it to cool -- that way the eggs will not curdle upon being poured into the pan.

This recipe was awesome! I cooked it for about ten minutes less than the recipe called for.  I used cream cheese in it.  It was crazy good.  It was very easy too.  I just didn't know how to get the crunchy glaze out of the pan.  I guess hot water would release it. I also wasn't sure whether to cover it or not, I didn't cover it. My husband took it to work to true Mexicans.  I shouldn't have been nervous about it, they loved it. I will make it over and over again. Fabulous!!!!!!

This was the easiest dessert I have ever made.  I was a little confused about the wet towel so I placed the pan of flan inside a larger pan and filled the larger pan until it was at the half mark of the smaller flan pan.  Tasted excellent and I received many compliments!

Help.  The caramalized sugar turned rock hard very quickly.  I baked it in the oven in hopes it would turn liquid again but no luck.  I notice this is a problem in some reviews so there must be a trick in working the sugar?  I love flan and will try this again.

I have tried flan on several occassions and have not been too crazy about it. This recipe is awesome!!! My kids loved it.We used the cream cheese version and my oldest daughter compared it to cheesecake. This recipe is worth making. Very little prep time.

Growing up in a mexican family everyone is so picky about traditional mexican dishes.  I made this last night and it came out delicious, next time I'm going to try it with the cream cheese. Thank you!

This tastes like scrambled eggs with simple syrup poured over it.  I followed the directions to the letter and it was nothing like I have had in restaurants.  I was very disappointed.  I will try another flan recipe next time.

Used 9 inch pan and it was only 1/2 inch thick. Texture not as smooth as I wanted. Flan was not as custard like as expected & was more hard than expected. Good enough flavor but not what I was looking for in a flan recipe.

This was too solid for me I followed the recipes exactly and it tasted like a syrup furtada or scrambled eggs with syrup. I was looking for something a little more custard like.

It was good, and a basic recipe for flan. Although I will say I'm Puerto Rican, and this recipe or Flan in itself is not native to Mexico, but Spain, therefore all or most Latin people have flan as a native food. I've been eating it since I was a baby, and the rest of my family from past generations, it is a very easy, commong, and good dessert. Can't go wrong with  it.

Not bad, but all these Flan recipes with sweetened condensed milk are TOO SWEET!  If you are satisfied by the sweetness of the caramel sauce (which is all sugar) and prefer the custard taste of a TRADITIONAL flan recipe, skip this one and continue searching for the recipes with just sugar, milk, eggs, salt, and vanilla.  There are a few out there, and they are much more satisfying with more variety of flavor, not just sweet.

Much too solid for Flan.  I'll use less eggs next time.  I haven't made flan in many years, I thought it used Sweetened Condensed Milk and Evaporated Milk.

It was ok, I personally use 6eggs, 2 cups of milk, one can of sweetened condensed milk, vanilla and cocunut milk 1/4 cup. blend this and allow it to settle until the bubbles have dissipated cook in a double pan with 3/4 inches of water in the lower pan on 350 for an hour. cool in the refridgerator for 3 hours flip on serving platter an serve. the caramel is optional to me as i just love the flan itself

Disapointed...1) the directions are not good for people who have never made this. ie:cooking sugar, i had to look for the directions, the sugar took forever & never browned.  2) it came out very eggy tasting, with bubbles, I followed the directions w/out flaw, now my boyfriend will never let it down, that he doesn't like flan.  I will find a better recipe!

I should have read the instructions more carefully with the sugar. I wasn't stirring as much as it said to.  The sugar came out a bit bitter.  How ever my kids loved it.  So I guess it ended well.

I had trouble with the caramelized sugar and tried it several times thinking I was doing it wrong. I went on with it anyway and it is fab. I did the cream cheese version. Made it for a church dinner and people that said they didn't like flan loved this. Next time I will try adding the water that another lady said she did.

Great recipe! My mom has a similar recipe to this, except she uses more eggs because she doesnt like it too sweet . I added teh cream cheese and it really turned out great! The one thing i did change was the sugar. In place of sugar, i just poured some syrup on the bottom of the pan to coat it and it still tasted awesome! Made the entire thing so easy and very quick!!

To the mixture I also added water(same amount as the milk)a pinch of salt a tps.of vanilla.Since I did not have 70 min. I did in the pressure cooker in a covered metal mold (or a round cookie can, as long as it has a lid)the caramelized sugar I do direct in to the mold, let the sugar cool(I did the sugar while I was doing the milk mixture, so by the time I ended it was already cool. and added just enough water to the cooker to get half way to the mold once you put it inside(Remember the water will boil and you don't want it to get into your mixture,even if its covered it is under pressure).Once the pressure starts, lower to medium  for 25 min.And that's all the time it takes.If you want a nice presentation and want to server it on a nice plate you have to put it in the fridge for at leats 2 hrs.that makes the caramelized sugar melt just enough to let you get it in to plate and won't stick to the mold>Use causion using the pressure cooker.I always use it and is a time saver!!

This flan was awesome! I really liked it. but i did add my own stuff like i added two Philadelphia packages and i added coconut cream to give it a great taste, and i succeeded but i do regret not adding any coconut flakes but otherwise my whole family liked it even my Caucasian best friend loved it, and he is picky. So good JOB :P

Firstly Flan doesn't originately come from Mexico. It's actually Spanish from Spain, look it up. In Latin America, flan is popular, and many local versions exist, including the Flan napolitano from Mexico, flan de coco from Costa Rica and the widespread flan de leche, often eaten with cream. If you really want the true tasty check "Creamy Caramel Flan" recipe sorry JessicaDez but your recipe is too dry.

I wasn't so lucky with this recipe. I was looking forward to a smooth, firm custard but my flan was not smooth, it was coarse and too too sweet. The caramel stuck to the pan so perhaps mixing with some water while melting would have helped or cutting down on the sugar would be wise since so much of it is left behind in the pan. I didn't try the cheesecake version and I poured the mixture into the pan only when the caramel had cooled.

I tried this recipe tonight but it didn't come out as real flan should.  It came out crumbly instead of soft.  I will not be making this flan again.

This recipe is out of this world.  I do not usually like flan but this flan is awesome.  My fiance is a flan lover and said this flan has a caramel goodness sent a shiver down his spine.  Will definitely make this one again.  Yum Yum!!!  Thanks a bunch!

Awesome! Definitely Mexican. You have to use the cream cheese. Easy, Quick and outstanding! I have given out this recipe to countless friends. Every one who has tasted this Flan has demanded the recipe. Thanks Jessica!

This flan is wonderful except the carmel topping doesn't melt well.  It needs water along with the sugar to dissolve.

This has to be the easiest and yummiest flan I've ever made or had! I mixed the egg mixture with a stick blender and the end result was a beautifully creamy flan. It even converted my non-lovin flan daughter into a fan!

I tried this last week.  I love flan, but I'd never made one before.  It was delicious, but not as fluffy as I had hoped.  Maybe I should beat the egg mixture longer.

Made this one last night. I am from Panama and my mother used to make her flan like this, but she would add a "splash" of rum (or any liquor for that matter) to get rid of the "egg-y" taste. I didn't do that and though it was nice, it did have that eggy flavor to it. I still think it was very nice. After cooling last night, it was still hard to serve. But today, it's just the perfect texture and very easy to slice and serve!

The flan seemed incredibly heavy for flan and in the future I will probably add more eggs.  Very good, just not the texture I was hoping for.

For a first ever attempt at a flan, it turned out well though I seem to have had the same problem as others with the caramelized sugar sticking.  Next time I'm going to try powdered sugar, just for the heck of it.  I found that even without the cream cheese it had a lovely thick, creamy textur (not yucky and gelatinous).

Super fabulous!! I used the cream cheese variation, and found that i much prefer this texture to that of tradition flan (which I find to be too gelatin-like). I brought this to a frind's home for a dinner party and it was raved over by all. Very easy to make, although I added 1/4 water and 1 cup sugar to make the caramel instead of the waterless version as directed.

So excited to find this wonderful recipe again, that was recently lost.  When the cream cheese is added it creates a wonderful texture that adds to this wonderful traditional dish.  This has always been a favorite dessert to share with friends, when having a mexican dinner together.

This was a bit more egg-y than I was looking for. I'm going to try some of the other recipes that call for more milk, less egg.
