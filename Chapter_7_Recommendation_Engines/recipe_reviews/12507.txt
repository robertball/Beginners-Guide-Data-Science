Not really a cheesecake, I was hoping for one.  If you cut one slice, the rest of the pie fills up the space.

this did not turn out well for me.  The cream cheese/chocolate filling had barely any chocolate taste, and mostly an unsweetened cream cheese flavor.  And letting it set for only 15 minutes (I actually let it set about 30), and then drizzling the chocolate syrup over the top was a big mistake.  Two hours later when I went to get it out of the fridge it appeared that the hot fudge sauce had caused the filling to sort of 'break down' and it was very liquidy and not appetizing.  The chocolate crust with the caramel on top was the only good part.

Instead of carmels, I used 3 small containers of carmel apple dip  ($0.99 each) and it worked great.

i added a layer of melted choc chips mixed with whipped cream on top of the crust to add more chocolate to the recipe. also once the caramel is refrigerated, it hardens, making it hard to slice. all  around, pretty good. will make again.

What a massive failure.  I made this twice in one night, thinking I had done something wrong.  The pie never fully sets up, has little to no cheescake flavor.  I took the second one to work for a pot luck and no one ate it.

Extremely easy and delicious.  The only problem I had was that I used fat free sour cream, lowfat milk and low fat cream cheese...it didn't hold its shape very well but it was still good.

this was the first cheesecake i've made and it turned out perfect! no oozing caramel and it didn't stick either. the only thing i would change is that the cheesecake flavor gets overwhelmed by all the pecan, chocolate and caramel. next time i will keep the crust the same but make 1 1/2 to 2 times the cheesecake mixture.

I was disappointed with this recipe, but it's partly my fault.  I used skim milk, because that's all we ever have in our fridge, and it never set up.  I'm sure this is a wonderful recipe, but anyone who makes it should use 2% milk or it will be runny.

The flavor of this was decent, but it would not hold together. Also, the other reviewer that said the hot fudge topping sort of seeped into the pie and separated it was absolutely right (and I didn't put the hot fudge on until the next day!).  I didn't serve this until two days after I made it and it still did not keep it's shape, which was disappointing. I did like the caramel/pecans on the bottom, so I may  have to play around with this and make my own chocolate portion.

This cheesecake is fantastic and so easy to make!  Instead of using regular milk with the chocolate mixture, I simply used the rest of the can of evaporated milk, and it turned out perfect!

Very very good, but mine didn't set up quite right either.  It was a little runny, but still tasted delicious!
