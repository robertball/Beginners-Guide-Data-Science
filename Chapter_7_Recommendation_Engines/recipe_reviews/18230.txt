This was a wonderful base to start experimenting with. We tried this recipe last night. After some changes we think we have found the perfect cream of crab soup. Being Marylanders we know cream of crab! Our changes – no salt, we used black pepper instead of white,  1 tablespoon of onion, leave out the shrimp – we tried it with and without, ¼ pound crab meat is enough, used 1/8 cup regular sherry (not cooking sherry) instead of the wine which really doesn't go with crab like sherry does and Old Bay sprinkled on top. With these changes it really is as good as the cream of crab soup you find at the best Maryland restaurants.

This was such a disappointment.  I should have known better when I saw that the recipe called for a half cup of wine to only 1-1/2 cups of cream. It ended up being way too thick and with an overwhelming taste of wine which was most unpleasant. If you still insist on making this, at least reduce both the wine and the flour by half.

Absolutely delicious!  I went ahead and make it with just a 1/4 cup of wine.  I tried both with all shrimp and all crab, but I liked it better with all shrimp.  It tasted like something you would get at an expensive restaurant.  It was real easy to make, too.  I think that it was meant to be used as a small appetizer served in a cup, thats why the servings are so small.  It does, however make a generous 2 servings, if you are using it as a main dish (especially since its SO filling!).  I served it with cheese-garlic biscuits, a winning combo.

I have to say that this recipe is delicious and darned near fool-proof!  I took almost EVERYone's suggestions, and it still came out glorious.  I used fresh Jonah crabmeat and minced shrimp (although I now agree with other reviewers who said, "Use one or the other seafood, not both."  The textures do not mesh well, at least not for me.)  I increased both the butter and flour to 3T, and added one pressed clove of garlic as the butter melted on low heat (caution: do NOT allow the garlic to turn brown; it becomes bitter, and will ruin the whole thing) and stirred in the flour as the garlic became fragrant.  Added a little onion powder and some parsley mixed in the flour, and used chicken base, as that is what I had on hand. I split the difference with the wines;  I added 1/4 cup of each!  After the second adding of half and half, I customized the seasonings for our taste -- paprika for colour, Old Bay, and a dash of cayenne.  Fabulous, fabulous, FABULOUS recipe!  Thanks for posting it!

A very good and rich soup.  I will definitely make this for company.  Next time I will use only 1/4 cup wine and will use either all shrimp or all crab.  One thing though, this recipe does not make 6 servings.  I made this full recipe as a dinner for my husband and I and we had two medium size bowls each and finished the pot.  This makes either 2 generous or 4 medium size servings.

I made this Feb. 10/07 for a dinner party for 12 and it was a hit! I served it as an appetizer with fresh bread. Thanks to the reviews, I omitted the shrimp, loaded up on the frozen crab meat, added crushed garlic (cooked down in the butter), black pepper instead of white, cornstarch instead of flour sherry instead of white wine. I used lactose free milk instead and a dollop of half and half. I forgot to add the chicken base but found that I didn't need it. Thanks a million!!

This was pretty good but I gave it a 4 because I made a few changes. I used all crab meat and used green onion rather than regular. I left out the chicken bouillion, made my roux and then sauted some garlic, the green onions and the crab meat, so the crab could really soak up that flavor. 
Next I added about half of the 1/2 and half and a TON of paprika--probably 3 Tblsp. 

Once it began to thicken I added the rest of the half and half and about a cup of sherry instead of wine and 1/2 tsp of white pepper. It was perfect!!

Thanks for a yummy recipe!!

WOW !!! This recipe was really, really, really, really, good !! I used all crabmeat, and cut the wine to 1/4 cup. It doesn’t make anywhere near six servings. It actually makes about two medium size bowls of the best Crab Bisque we have ever had. I will make this again.

I love this recipe.  I haven't personally made it, which is why I love it more. My husband is the one that cooks it, and I have to say...his cooking isn't always the best, but he has made this recipe his own. He changes it a bit, doesn't add all of the half and half, and turns it into sauce. He then pours it on top of Linguine noodles, and makes it an awesome pasta dish.  I absolutely love it!!!

I always double this recipe using a 1lb can of crab available at Costco  and 1lb bag of frozen salad shrimp.  I skip the wine and make up for it with 1/2 and 1/2, then thin it out with a cup or 2 of nonfat milk.  It's always a crowd pleaser.  It tastes like tons more effort is involved than actually is.

I tried this recipe, and it was a hit!  I got some crab cake (very lumpy) from a Greek restaurant.  Since I didn't like the strong smell of the crab, I decided to make it a bisque. While I was cooking it according to this recipe, I did notice that the portion of ingredients should be adjusted to match personal taste.  First, I would use half or 3/4 of the chicken bullion - it was way too salty.  At the end, I have to salvage the soup by adding 1 cup of milk to dilute the salty taste. Second, I also recommend to replace 1/2 cup of the half and half cream to milk, so that it won't be that fattening (and it still tastes just as good as the restaurant). Third, I recommend to use bigger(21-25 shrimps per pound), raw, tail-on shrimps. I got them from Costco, and for some reason, the smaller shrimps just don't have the seafood taste.  Fourth, I add a stick of chopped celery in the bisque. Fifth, I also add one bay leaf.  Sixth, I cooked everything for a total of 30 minutes.  

This is a really good recipe, and you just have to sample it whenever you add another ingredient to match it to your personal taste.

This bisque was absolutely delicious. I did make some of the modifications suggested by others.  My first suggestion is that if you are serving this soup to more than 2 people, double the recipe - it doesn't make much.  I used only crab, since I had been looking for a recipe for crab bisque.  I had 8 oz. of crab meat and made a double batch.  It was more than enough crab. I added 1 clove crushed garlic to the melted butter and I used Sherry instead of wine (about 1/4 cup for the double batch). I also used some paprika as suggested by another reviewer.  I used 2 tbsp and it was a bit much.  Next time, I will cut it back to 1 tbsp, but I do like the paprika with this recipe.  I ended up having to thin it out a bit with some chicken broth, since it became quite thick as it cooked.  My husband  and I both thought it was delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is really good.  My sweetie and I use to live in Maryland and have had Bisque from several very good restaurants.  This could easily compete but as so many have already said, it is not enough for 6.  I doubled it and it was just enough for 4.  I added Paprika, saute'd shallots and scallions to the recipe and used only 1/2 the wine. It was great.  We all loved it with some cheddar biscuits and will sleep very well tonight.

I feel bad for giving this such a low rating because I didn't follow the recipe at all. My husband and I have been craving crab bisque after watching the "Soup Nazi" from Seinfeld and so I tried to make it but with cutting the fat and calories in half. Not a good idea. My suggestion would be to follow the recipe and prepare your waistline.

This was a fantastic recipe!  I took the suggestions of others and added Old Bay seasoning and cream cheese.  I also used garlic instead of onion and imitation crab instead of real.  To keep the calories down I used fat free half and half.  Definitely a recipe you can play with.

I did not care for this recipe!! I agree with another review that said if they had tried this before having bisque soups at restaurants they would have never tried another bisque soup.  I have nothing good to say about this.

Like a few other folks, I added a bit more half & half because I had a lot more crabmeat and shrimp than the recipe asked for. This was delicious. I'll definitely make it again.

I love this recipe.  The only thing I changed was to add the wine at the beginning so that the alcohol taste cooks out and the richness of the soup is enhanced as the wine cooks.  I also added some paprika and used 100% crab meat. This is DELICIOUS!!!!!

My husband and i tried this last night and LOVED it. My hubby is a big fan of bisque and crab, so i figured this was a good combo to try out while he was feeling under the weather. I used fresh real crab meat and small frozen, pre-cooked shrimp. I followed the recipe exact with the exception of the wine, which because so many previous reviewers had reduced it to 1/4 cup i decided to hit in somehwere in the middle and used 1/3 cup chardonnay. It turned out BEAUTIFULLY. My husband and i LOVED the difference in textures with the shrimp and crab. I left the shrimp whole. Nice and rich and delicious!! I do agree that serving size is quite small. It must be an appetizer because as a main course there is only enough to serve 2, which was perfect for us!!

I couldn't give this 5 stars because after following the directions in the end you had the texture of an al dante onion.  I really believe you should cook the onion in the butter before you add the flour so that it is soft and undetectable.  Other than that it was really good.  After tasting it I added a pinch of cayenne pepper to add a little kick and it tasted just like a bisque I used to get up in the DC area.

My boyfriend is a big seafood fan and really enjoyed this. We made it using left over king crab and didn't add any shrimp - the other reviews said both were too much. I added a little paprika for color and a little extra flour to thicken it more (as my boyfriend requested) but he decided it would be better the original way.

Fantastic!!  I used lobster instaed of crab (I had 2 leftover tails form a dinner party) and I used chicken broth instead of wine.  It was great!!  I tripled the recipe and it worked fine.  I will DEF. make again.

Delicious!  Made exactly as the recipe says. I used chardonnay for the white wine and no fat 1/2 and 1/2. Still thick and yummy without the calories of real 1/2 1nd 1/2!

I have made this twice now and my wife and I love it. First time we used immitation crab it was ok, but the second time we used real crab meat and it was better. Only change I made was I left the bouillon out both times.

Once you've had a real bisque, this recipe loses it's luster.  The first time I made it, which was several years ago, I loved it.  BUT, now that I've had the 'real thing' many times since then, I made it again and... it was very thick and goopy.  I agree that sherry is probably the way to go because the wine didn't seem to fit and there was too much of it.  I did not add the crab, just shrimp, because of other user comments that said the textures didn't match.  I will not make this recipe again and do not recommend it.

I just got done eating a bowl of this and have to add my comment.  This is the best seafood bisque I have ever had. We always like to try it when we go different places to eat and only 1 time found one that was very comparable.  I triple the recipe in order to get about 4 large bowls of bisque.  I omit the onion and wine, but add Old Bay and red pepper seasoning.  It's a staple in our home. I make it several times a year...especially when I see lump crab go on sale.  Thanks Katrina!

This recipe is phenomenal! It made me feel like a chef!!! I can never get soup quite right, but this was so easy!  I did make these changes based on others recommendations: add 1 extra TBS each fo flour and butter, no white pepper (because I didn't have any), all crab, no shrimp.  To cut down on cost, I actually ended up buying a half pound of real crab, and a half of imitation. It was fine for us, but if I were making it for guests, I'd recommend using all real crab!  I added paprika for color and Old Bay to taste! I served it in french bread bread bowls! Delicious!

This was such a rich and delicious meal.  I served this on Christmas Eve with homemade wheat dinner rolls.  I ended up having to quadruple the recipe, because it didn't seem like it was going to be enough, but in the end I did have some leftover. Also, as suggested by other reviewers, I did add some extra seasoning (Old Bay and red pepper flakes, etc.). Great recipe!

This recipe as written, is not to my liking I am sorry to say. The addition of the wine just ruined it, but prior to that it was tasting really good.  B/c of this I decided to make it again...The 2nd time around instead of wine I used only 1/8 cup of cream sherry, I also took many of the other reviewers suggestions & added 1t of paprika, black pepper instead of white, cornstarch instead of flour, old bay instead of salt and used only crab, and added a few pinches of parsely.  With these changes I give it a solid 5 stars. I will definitely be making it again!

This is very good! After reading the reviews, we did make a few tweaks. We used sherry instead of white wine. Next time I will probably cut that in half though. Still a little strong. We used all the salt and boullion and also added old bay on top of that. Definitely too much salt. I think next time we will try not using the salt and boullion and replace with stricly old bay. We also used fat free half and half and coudldn't taste the difference. Enjoy!

This is a five between my rating of 4 and my husband's 6! After reading almost all reviews I made the following changes: 3 tbsp each butter and flour, 1 tsp kosher salt, 1/4 tsp each white and black pepper, 2 tsps chicken broth granules, 2 tsp onion powder (instead of chopped), 1 pint fat free 1/2 & 1/2, 1 lb shrimp (no crab) pulsed 2 or 3 times in a processor to make it chunky, 1/4 cup white wine, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 tbsp dried parsley, 1 and a half tsp each paprika and old bay, a few dashes of cayenne, and 5 drops hot sauce. I added milk to thin it out slightly, and to mellow the flavors. I will definitely be making this again! Thank you everyone for the great recommendations!

This is pretty good on its own, but as the other reviewers have said, stick to just shrimp or just crab. I prefer shrimp because you can get the ready-cooked frozen shrimp and make the dish very quickly. Additionally, try adding pumpkin. One entire can of pumpkin. It is the same consistency and just adds complex flavor. I use corn in all bisques I make because it also works well. Furthermore, I use coconut milk instead of heavy cream because it is much healthier and has a nutty, rich flavor. Try these ideas next time!

I made this Today it was very good...I did make these changes... double everything in the recipe if you want to serve 4 and use real Sherry. This needs to cook on low at least 2 hours to really come together.

I made this because it had such great reviews but I really didn't care for it at all. I followed the recipe almost exactly - except I followed a reviewer's suggestion of adding extra seasoning and sherry instead of white wine. It tasted way too sweet, like a bowl full of cream. We ate the shrimp... I'm so glad I've had good seafood bisque before. If this had been my first bowl I never would have eaten it again.

I'm a Baltimorean and this recipe is pretty darn good.  I agree with a recent review that something is missing, though.  For me and my chef friend its the fish stock.  We start with a couple leftover steamed blue crabs (if there is such a thing) and the shells from the shrimp.  Boiled this down with the wine, water and seasonings, then add this to the rue.  Reduce this to your liking, then dump the seafood in.  Now THATs B'more style.

This was very good.  I doubled the recipe, used 1lb bay shrimp and 1lb dungenous crab.  I used half 1/2 & 1/2 and half lowfat milk and it was fantastic.  Next time I will try it with just lowfat milk.  I also forgot to put the wine in until the very end and it worked out perfectly.  The broth didn't have a winey taste, but the fish had a hint of wine.  Delish.

Excellent starter recipe.  I doubled it and used 8oz crab & 1 lb shrimp.  I added some cajun seasoning and about 4 oz of cream cheese cut into tiny cubes, melted into the soup.  My husband raved, and he NEVER raves!!  Thank you.

Sorry, but I thought this was awful.  I prepared according to directions, except I halved the wine.  To try to make it better, I added extra half and half, milk, two american cheese slices, and multiple seasonings (cajun, garlic, bay leaf, black pepper, parsley).  Only after all this, did I find it edible.  I wouldn't even call it a good base recipe.  The wine taste was still strong, even after adding all the extra ingredients and only using half the amount called for.  I was hoping for a quick and easy recipe that was good.  It was quick and easy, but not good.

Awesome!!! Great recipe!! I did take several ideas from other reviews into consideration. I did not use wine or sherry, I did use chicken stock instead. I only used crab meat. I also found this recipe doubles nicely. Family all agrees this is a "keeper" Thank You !!

I love crab but I wasn't fussy on this at all.  It's probably just me.  I used sherry instead of wine and omitted the shrimp, just put in crab.  I found the soup to be a little bitter.  I wish I had enjoyed it.

Very tasty and so easy to make. My husband and I both liked it. I wasn't sure what type of wine to use, so I made it with chardonnay. May add a little more wine next time for some extra punch. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was so easy, quick and simply fabulous!!! The reviews were helpful, I added 1t seafood seasoning, 1T additonal butter and flour, 1/3c fat free milk to dilute. I also used 1/4c of sherry instead of the whitewine  and a crushed a bullion cube instead of the granulated bullion.  This would impress any guest, a definite keeper!!!

This was incredible!  I modified to reduce fat by using 3/4 c half and half, 1 1/4c skim milk and 1/4 c wine and the thickness or flavor was perfectly fine.

I added my own twist to this recipe, but it taste great on it's own.  I'm a garlic lover so I added garlic and thinned the recipe down a little bit with chicken stock.  My family ate the whole pot.  It goes really well with a garlic toasted baguette to dip or put in as croutons in your soup.

I didn't like this recipe too much.  I must admit I tried to change it as I went along because I found it more like a thick sauce than a bisque.  I also didn't like the wine since I think sherry suits crab better.  None of us could finish a bowl since it was so very rich.

This was the first time making a soup and it came out great. The only thing that the recipe lacked was basil. The wine was a little overpowering for my taste so I would probably add less next time. The only other problem was the serving amounts, it says 6 serving but it only comes out to about 3 servings at best. Next time I will have to double the recipe.

What's amazing is so much that this recipe is bad, but that it isn't more obvious.  A proper seafood bisque should be made with fish fumet, or at least chicken stock, but not bouillon.  I attempted it anyway hoping to find a wonderfully simple and tasty treat.  It's poorly seasoned, relying too much on salt.

Katrina, thankyou so much for submitting such a delicious recipe. This is the best bisque I have ever had, it tasted like it came from a 5 star restauraunt! I doubled the recipe, and I did add one sliced potato, thinly sliced celery stalk, and some Old Bay seasoning. I can't wait to make this for guests and blow them away - my fiance loved it!

MMM very yummy! first I put in the onions and let them carmalize, then I added the flour (and salt, fish bouillon, pepper)stirred it up a bit and then added about 1 full cup of white wine. I let this simmer I then added the shrimp and fish after which I added some 1/2 & 1/2 and milk. I threw in some 1/2 lb frozen broccoli because it screams at me *Vegetables!!* 
VERY easy INCREDIBLE recipe.

I tried this recipe for Mother's Day and my wife and kids loved it.  I was confused by the amount it was suppose to make.  I could see it would not make 6 servings and since several other recipes called for 1 or 2 cups of chicken broth, I thought something was missing and added a cup of water.  It still tasted delicious, but will try it without the water the next time.

I made this w/o using the shrimp and doubling up on the crab.  I think the wine was a bit much so I will use half next time, but this was overall an excellent bisque.  Served with some crusty bread and small salad and this was the meal.   Oh, some Old Bay also, of course.  :o)

This turned out delicious, I went by some of the suggestions of less wine and I only used shrimp. I also added Old Bay, IMOP that was the missing link.

I really enjoy this recipe - so good on a cold wet night.  I am wheat and dairy free so had to make a few substitutions.  I used coconut oil in place of the butter, milk in place of the half and half and all purpose GF flour + added garlic and cayenne as recommended by others.  It was delicious!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I omitted the shrimp and was worried that i didn't have enough crab meat because I didn't replace the omitted shrimp with more crab. In the end though, it was WAAAAY too much crab. It was more "mushy" than "soupy". Next time I will 1/2 the amount of crab.

made this for deer camp. It is very simple as is but I added celery and cayenne pepper and added chicken stock in place of the wine and quadrupled the amounts for a big pot.  a loaf of garlic bread made for a great dinner after hunting.

I'm only giving 4 stars because I didn't follow the exact recipe.  But mmmmm it was GOOD!  I used only crab and used green onion and added a clove of garlic.  I also added some paprika and some Old Bay.  We'll be eating this again and again this winter! :)

This is wonderfully simple and delicious! I was looking for an easy and quick recipe for a seafood bisque that I could make with things on hand. I wasn't sure if it would be as good as a more complicated recipe, but it is perfect! I didn't have white wine, so with a little uncertainty, I substituted chicken stock. It was delicious!

turned out fantastic. I agree it only makes two servings though but that was okay because I expected it. I only used crab & doubled the crab, only used 1/4 cup of white wine and added garlic & old bay seasoning. Definitely a winner!

A wonderful and easy soup. Make sure to double, triple or more. This will be gone in a flash! I did not change a thing. I see a lot of comments about leaving out the wine. I think the key is to use a wine that you enjoy. I used a sweeter local wine and it was delicious. I never use wine in a recipe that I wouldn't drink! :-)

This was simple and tasty.  I used garlic instead of onion and didn't use any wine.  I let the mixture simmer to thicken it up a bit.  I agree the texture would be greatly improved by using just one seafood (i.e. shrimp or crab).

Great recipe!  My husband has been searching for a recipe for clam bisque because his favorite restaurant that sold it closed down.  So instead of the crab & shrimp, I add 2 cans of clams.  Highly suggest this, adds a great flavor, esp when add a little of the clam juice.  I omit the white wine, neither my husband or I like the flavor in the bisque.  Not crazy about the white pepper, usually substitute black.  Sometimes add the onion, but I found it doesn't really add alot to the flavor.  Great starting recipe, with these changes I make this pretty often!  Thanks!!

This was a perfect recipe especially if you are willing to put your own personal touch on it. We used 1/4 cup of wine which was enough. Black pepper is fine. About 1/4 cup of chicken broth instead of boullion. Didn't use the crab. After cooking threw all of it in a blender to give it a different texture. If you choose to do that you may need to add a bit more broth and half and half to thin it out. Perfect in a small portion with a salad.

It was a bit bland and not as rich and creamy as I like my bisques but it was a good start. With a few modifications (additional spices, some cream and some sherry) it was quite tasty.

good recipe with a few tweeks.  Use only crab and not shrimp.  Use shallots instead of onions, use marsala instead of white wine.

I like to go exactly by the recipe the first time I cook anything but I just could not with this recipe because I felt it would be too salty and over powered with wine, so I left out the salt because the bouillon is pretty salty.  I started out with 2 tablespoons of wine then added one more tablespoon.  Next time I make this I will use a low sodium bouillon because I am going to sauté my shrimp in garlic and salted butter and add very last just before serving; the shrimp was just bland.   Forgot---also will use green onions instead of minced white onion.

easy to make and had a rich taste.  I found the soup a bit salty.  I think it was the bullion.  next time I will use chicken broth.

I loveeeed this recipe!! I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I made a few changes. I used scallops instead of shrimp, about 1/4 cup Chardonnay, 2 tsp cornstarch instead of flour, and half a can of sweet corn. It came out beautifully!! I will def use this one again and again!

This was wonderful!  Most definitely will make this again.  We did follow the base recipe with only a few minor substitutions.  To use what we had in the house instead of running to the store to get ingredients, we used canned crab and evaporated milk instead of half and half.  We also used Zatarain's creole seasoning instead of salt and some tricolor peppercorns instead of black pepper.  We did not measure the white wine, just splashed in what was leftover from the bottle we were drinking.  Overall we loved this: It was hearty and flavorful, and wonderful with hot homemade bread.  Perfect for this chilly autumn day.

Per some of the other reviewers, I doubled the recipe and omitted the wine completely.  I added some Old Bay and cayenne. I also added some half n half since it was very thick.  It was delicious.

Yummy! I was looking for something to do with my leftover crab meat. We had king crab yesterday.  It is too expensive to let it go to waste. So this recipe was suggested in recipe exchange portion of the website.  We loved it. Made a few changes per other reviews.  I used sherry, green onions and left out shrimp.  
It does not make much. If you are eating it as a main course for dinner I would suggest doubling for a family of four.

This bisque was absolutely AMAZING!! The flavor was great and even my best friends 9 year old loved...he all but licked his bowl clean, not only will I make this again, but I can't wait until I get a chance to. The only thing that I changed was doubling the amt of crab and shrimp. Absolutely wonderful!! Thanks so much for sharing

My husband and I LOVE shrimp bisque, so I tripled the recipe.  I added garlic to the roux, and added the shrimp at the very end, after the soup was bubbly, and let it cook until pink.  The soup was a tad bland so I added a good sprinkling of Old Bay, and it was perfect.  Be sure to saute the onions until they are very, very soft; I didn't cook them long enough so I used my immersion blender to puree the soup before I added the shrimp.  I would say the recipe still needs tweaking, but it's a very good start.

I think i expected more from a highly rated bisque..followed the recipe to the penney on first batch...tasted "moldy" from the white wine and frankly could have gotten the same effect from instant country gravy with crab and shrimp thrown it..2nd batch, no shrimp no white wine just tasteless....there was a recipe i used off this site with cream cheese and papricka that was so much more flavorful than this...sorry I can't rate this any higher its not justified.

Just what I was looking for...I wanted a restaurant-style creamy crab soup (not a veggie chunky chowder or just a clam chowder made with crab). VERY nice, rich,  and decadent.  I used fresh cracked dungeness, no shrimp, no salt, dry sherry, organic half n' half (tends to be sweeter and is great with a sweet crab), white onion, and Old Bay on top to taste as suggested.  Served with cheese biscuits.  Doesn't make enough!  As soon as my husband and I finished our coffee mugsful he asked for more.  Good thing we had a great crabbing weekend on the Oregon coast!  I made more...

We had a family get together on a cold Michigan day with several varieties of soups.  This Bisque was the BOMB! It was the first to go and everybody was dissapointed that there were no seconds!  I followed the recipe with one exception...I also added some lobster meat.  Definitely a keeper!

i used soy half-n-half and crab only. i added some old bay, paprika, and cayenne -- also browned 2 cloves of garlic in the butter as recommended. left out the chicken bouillon. this recipe is simple and yummy but i feel it still lacks something. i will definitly make it again, and continue to experiment. thank goodness for soy rpoducts so that i can enjoy this kind of food again!

I followed this recipe to the letter- using Chardonnay for my white wine- and essentially ended up with wine soup.  Terrible!  It was also way too thin for a bisque.  I feel if the wine was omitted or cut back to 1-2 tbs. I might have liked it. What a waste of all that beautiful seafood!

The stars are rated by my daughter, who thinks that this was "one of the best seafood things that she has ever had."  I did a bit of doctoring - worked with what was in the pantry - so it was mock crab, 7-pepper seafood blend (which has salt, so I didn't use add'l salt, and the mock crab has a bit of salt and sweetness that you don't find in regular crab).  I also used evaporated milk, which I always have on hand to replace cream (which I DON'T always have on hand) - and then added a little more milk to make proportions.  I also used sherry - another thing I keep on hand for cooking.  So, this was a perfect soup because it takes well to substitutions ... and is easy ... and fast ... and good.  This is one of those things that you keep on hand for when you have just about all the stuff and want to start a meal with a special first course.  Still waiting for husband to get home and put it on the table - he's working really late at the office every day this week - this will be a special way to start supper.

This is a great soup to make in a hurry. I used a chicken soup base instead of the granules, sherry instead of wine and added a little hot sauce. We really enjoyed it with some corn bread.

This was so simple and yummy!  I added old bay seasoning and a shot of tabasco for added flavor, but even without, you can't beat such an easy meal!

This is a good base recipe.  I ended up adding canned whole clams, and lobster tail (chunked up).  In addition to that, I used 1 TBS. of "Better Than Bouillion" Lobster base (purchased from the grocery store in the soup aisle, next to the bouillion cubes) rather than chicken bouillion.  It made ALL the difference in the world as far as taste goes.  I served this with a fresh spinach salad and crusty French rolls.

Like I said, this is a great base recipe, thanks for sharing.

This is delicious bisque.  I will omit the salt next time because the granuals are almost completely salt anyway.  I added more cream to make a little more liquid and to cut the salty taste. Boy was it YUMMY!  Making it again for Xmas Eve.

This was just so so for me. It wasnt 'bad' but ive definitely had better. Based on all the great reviews i am led to believe that I did something wrong, rather than this not being a great dish. Either way, this was a one-time only dish for me.

Very rich and delicious!  My children, 2 and 4, loved it as well.  I thinned this out with 1/2 c milk and it still barely made 4 medium-sized servings.  You won't want to serve this in large chowder/chili bowls--too rich!  Perfect for a luncheon with other lighter items, or an appetizer before a nice dinner.  When I fix it again, I'll serve in small, cup-sized bowls.  Have everything ready before starting--it goes very fast once you begin.  I didn't do this, and had to keep removing it from the heat while I'd do the next step.  I roughly chopped my shrimp since my little ones were eating it, and I liked it that way--every bite had something yummy in it!  Thanks for sharing this lucious recipe.  I'll definitely make it again!

I was a little disappointed in this bisque.  I took other reviewers suggestions and used Old Bay instead of salt - probably should have stayed with the salt.  Will not use crab if I make it again - made the seafood taste very overpowering.  Also, my roux had an odd color to it.

Five stars for ease of preparation; and great taste for little work!! I'd just make a few changes next time: Most importantly, add the crab meat last after all the stirring is done, so it stays in lumps. I felt that I was able to taste the wine too much, but I might not have chosen the best wine. Or maybe the alcohol needs to be simmered off?  Will make this one again.

I substituted the salt with Old Bay and fat free half and half to lighten it up a little.  My roux was a little strange but it turned out ok.  The FLAVOR of this bisque is FANTASTIC. Truely restaurant quality.  However I used flake style imitation crab and I didn't care for the texture it gave the bisque. Next time I make this I will use lobster meat instead to see how that tastes.  GREAT recipe... thanks!

Fantastic! Made it for a group of friends to have at a campfire evening. All raved about it and wanted the recipe. My changes; skip the salt and use plenty of fresh ground black pepper instead of white. First batch was too salty.  I also added more onion, a stalk of finely chopped celery, and a finely chopped potato. These I simmered for a few minutes in water before adding other ingredients. The original recipe only made four bowls, so I multiplied everything by four for the crowd. Didn't use quite as much half and half or wine for the large pot, but did use more water.  Planned on leftovers for us, but none was left!

I liked this ok, although my boyfriend didn't.  I thought it was a bit sweet though which was strange given that there's no sugar in it.  I used 1 lb imitation crab and 1/4 cup wine, and served it over fetuccine, and it easily served 4 that way.

I made this wonderful bisque and will definitely make it again.  I added lobster to it as well, and a small bit of cornstarch to thicken it more.  I also did not have white wine on hand and used white zinfandel instead. Overall, it was divine!

Delicious!!  This was the first bisque I have attempted and it couldn't have been easier.  I took other reviewers' recommendations and used all shrimp and 1/4 c white wine.  I also added Old Bay and cayenne pepper for a kick.  It really turned out well and my husband loved it too!  Thanks so much for this quick and easy recipe!

Near my house there is a little pub that serves a spectacular crab bisque, this recipe is quick, easy and much cheaper than the pub, but still just as great.  My husband an I really love it as both an appetizer or a hearty lunchtime meal.

Doing keto. Made the recipe as written but used leeks instead of onion and whipping cream because I had them on hand.  This was SO good!  We’ll definitely be making this again. Oh, and I added some curry and turmeric to help with inflammation and also for color.  Wow!

With plenty of shrimp (about size 20) I used no crab today on my first try. I would cut my shrimp in smaller chunks or use smaller shrimp next time. Took longer to make since I was also making the Garlic Shrimp recipe here with half my shrimp and I would also make that again but not on the same day. My husband also loved these recipes and just as much the next day for reheats.

Very rich but so good. Hubs said to rate a 4, I'd say a 5. He thought the white wine was a little strong, but I think maybe I just didn't heat things through long enough to mellow it out.  He doesn't drink so things can be a tad strong sometimes even though we cook with wine many times.

This bisque was absolutely fabulous!!  I used Old Bay instead of salt, and all shrimp and no wine. The recipe doesn’t make much but it’s so rich you don’t need much. I will definitely make this again and again.

Did not make - looking at recipe, there is something missing ie water - 2 cups of liquid doesn't serve 6?   Either chicken stock or water shld be added if chicken granules are used.

Excellent I reduced wine to 1/4 c and added slightly more of a milk/cream combo (out of  half and half) and sprinkled tad of cayenne. Served with New Orleans reusing French bread heated with butter

I made a few changes, and the family loved it. This is definitely one of our new favorites! I made this for 12 people, so these suggestions may need to be pared down if you are making a smaller amount. 1)add 1TBS tarragon, 1TBS onion flakes(Nix the raw onion-this is great for anyone who despises cutting onions), and 1tsp paprika, 2)use a pinch of cayenne pepper, not white pepper , 3)use 1 or 2 cups chicken broth instead of boullion granules. Add extra flour if you like a thicker consistency.

This recipe was everything I expected and more with a minor modification. I read a review that the wine was too overpowering so I cut down the amount and it came out great! Loved the rich flavor of the cream base. This bisque is a a bit on the thicker side so if you want to loosen it up a bit, add some chicken stock and cut the bouillon cube in half. This will definitely be a staple go-to soup for the upcoming winter!

I loved this as did my son. Used heavy cream instead of half and half, sherry instead of wine, and added a heaping tap of paprika. left out the chicken granules since I don't have any. also used only shrimp since I had plenty on hand to use up. so, yes I changed the recipe up a lot, but it was soo good!

This was very good and quick to make! I only used 1/4 cup wine, added xtra half and half to equal the total of 1/2 cup and used a 1/4 tsp of roasted garlic seasoning and a little fresh grated Parmesan on top when I served it.

This is our new Christmas Eve favorite! I tripled this recipe and made it in a slow cooker so it could cook while we attended services.  I began by melting butter, sauteeing onions until translucent, then added regular sherry (1/8 cup per serving) and added it at the beginning so the alcohol would cook out. I mixed all the seasonings into the flour and then added to the butter mix to start the roux, then added fat free half n half to thin it. We had imitation crab legs on hand, so I chopped those up in the food processor, added everything to the slow cooker along with milk and vegetable stock until it was at the desired consistency. Finally, for the Iowa in all of us, I added some corn. I served it with cheddar biscuits and it was PHENOMENAL!!  We will be making this every Christmas Eve...a new family tradition!

Used both seafoods and just 2 tbsp flour. Will only use shrimp next time. Added old bay and paprika, as well as a squeeze of lemon juice.

Delicious recipe with some modifications. Like many other posters, I halved the amount of wine called for (used a Chardonnay), added paprika and garlic, and used a mix of white and black pepper. Cut the salt by 1/4 too. As several others mentioned this does NOT make a lot of bisque--if you held the recipe as written you'd have about 3 cups of very thick, chowder-like bisque that MIGHT make 3 decent-sized bowls. So I doubled everything except the seafood meat (incorporating the modifications above), and it was marvelous!

This recipe turned out wonderfully! Since my mother is going through chemotherapy I have to be careful with certain things and not to make foods too rich so I didn't add the wine, and it still tasted delicious! Since everyone in my family loves lobster bisque, I got two lobsters instead of the shrimp and crab meat, pre cooked them, and used those instead. It tasted amazing. Everyone in my family loved it and is now obsessed with the bisque. It doesn't hurt that its quick and easy to make either! Great recipe!

This was great.  Perfect for a cold rainy night.  I didn't have any wine in the house so made it without and it was yummy.  I do think a splash of wine would have been a nice touch though, maybe no a whole half a cup though ...

I altered the recipe a bit to suit my needs, like swapped out the shrimp for scallops.... I quadrupled the butter, flour and crab and did everything else to taste.... I sauteed the onions in the butter, added flour, about 1 qt of chick broth and 1 qt of 1/2 and 1/2, 5 pototes that I cut and cooked, for thickening, 1/2 bag of frozen corn that I cooked salt and pepper and 1/2 of the crab and pureed everything. Then I added the remaining (lump) crab and corn, scallops, and wine. I may have added more broth at that point too, and then added bay seasoning to taste. The end result was a delicious soup that my friends and family enjoyed for New Years eve....

FANTASTIC!!! However one important thing to note-the serving size is not 6.  I should have known better when looking at the measurements of the liquid ingredients-it's only 2 cups. I made a few changes-added garlic, used black pepper rather than white, used whole milk since I was out of half & half, substituted extra milk for wine and only used shrimp.  The results were wonderful! As other reviewers noted, this would be excellent as a pasta sauce-maybe thicken it up a bit for a seafood lasaqna.

I only used this recipe as a guide for ingredients. I used fresh crab meat, cooking sherry, white wine a little bit of heavy whipping cream and the majority of 1/2 1/2. I didn't measure anything and did everything to taste. It was really good for a homemade  soup in minutes. I also did not add the onions.

Very Good!  I only used 1/4 cup of white wine as suggested by others.  I don't like things spicy at all so the pepper was a little much for me, but tolerable.  I might put a little less than 1/4 teaspoon next time.  It does taste like restaurant creamy crab soup though.

I had a "lent" party at my house on Friday evening and made this for my guests.  Everyone LOVED it.  The recipe is a little too think for my liking so I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 cream.  I also used the fake crab meat in the packages next to the deli.  It was REALLY good and will for sure be making again.  Thank you for a easy and delicious recipe!!!

I think stock was left out of the recipe by mistake.  I made two cups of stock out of the shells and added the boullion to it, then slowly stirred it into the roux and allowed it to reduce.  The final texture was not as thick as the original recipe but the portion size went much further.

Made this on CHristmas Eve for our hot soup (a tradition) and it was a success!  Everyone loved it, especially the chunks of crab and shrimp.  I had to quadruple the recipe for my party, however, and it still wasn't enough.  Thanks for the recipe and we'll definitely keep this on our list for next year's party!

This was excellent and I even made it with 2% milk since I didn't have any cream on hand.

Excellent flavor. Very easy to make. I had a pound of crab so I increased the half and half by an extra half cup and the wine by and extra 1/4 cup. Very thick, rich, delicious, and decadent.

This was amazing!  I used a very good canned crab meat, and I used large shrimp, but cut them into pieces.  By having smaller shrimp pieces, it blended better with the crab texture.  This was just like eating a fancy restaurant bisque.  Thanks for this great recipe!

I just made this tonight and it was really good!!  I followed a lot of suggestions from past reviews.  I used a serving size of 12 for four people, I used only shrimp, and I used garlic instead of onion.  I sauteed the butter, garlic, and shrimp shells together and strained the juices through a cheese cloth.  After mixing the dry and wet ingredients together, the soup was lumpy so I used a blender.  It came out so creamy!  I also left out the wine and it was still really good.

I made this the night before, It was very easy and simple to warm up the next night. after siting over night it was fantastic. After melting the butter I cooked the shrimp shell down in it to give it more flavor after draining the butter from the shells. My girl frend loved it.

I thought this was a great recipe however I felt like it was missing some flavor. I tried many of the other reviewers suggestions, garlic instead of onion, half milk half 1/2 & 1/2, paprika, & I used only crab. Next time I am going to try to use sherry instead of wine. The serving size is also way off. My husband and I polished off the whole pot easily! Good recipe, and I will make again, however, it definitely needs some tweaking to be a 5 star.

So good! I didn't have any fresh crabmeat so I just doubled the shrimp and ended up with a rich and creamy shrimp bisque! I did substitute a half cup of the half and half with heavy cream too. I've never made a bisque before, so thanks for sharing!!

This was excellent. I subbed 1/2 c. milk for part of the half and half, and it was still very rich, FULL of seafood, and could probably be watered down with more milk to extend the servings.  I used 1/2 pkg of imitation crab, and loaded up on the shrimp.  After reading the reviews regarding portion size, I went ahead and made it for 6, and it fed my husband (who had seconds), my toddler and myself with a small portion left over.  It was not enough for 6 adults unless made into appetizer servings.  We had it for dinner with some crusty french bread.  Will make again and again.

Wonderful recipe. Very easy to prepare.  I substitututed 1/4 cup sherry for the wine and used a bit more butter. I also minced the shrimp. Everyone loves this recipe.  It is a keeper.

This recipe was very good. i took the hints of many; omitted the salt, added cayenne and old bay. i also added minced garlic and parsley flakes. i dont deal in alcohol, so instead of the wine, i used a chicken stock that i flavor enhanced with a tsp of worcestershire sauce. And i served it over pasta. my kids loved it!

Came out delicious-thanks for posting this!  I did make some changes.  I didn't use the chicken bouillon granules (I don't eat meat), and the first time I found the wine overpowering, even though I lessened the amount.  I am not a wine drinking, so maybe it is just me!  The second time I made this, I omitted the wine and used Veggie broth instead.  I also used Old Bay Seasoning, and I replaced the crab with more shrimp.   YUMMY!!!!!!!

I thought this was great.  I used skim milk so I could justify making it just for myself and ate 2 bowls!  I'm sure it would have been alot richer with 1/2 & 1/2.   I added Old Bay to my liking and used canned crab.  Will make again.

i loved this bisque.  but, i DID make a few changes.  i'm a health nut and don't like things too rich.  so i used 1% milk instead of the half and half.  also, i omited the salt - it wasn't missed.  i used the full amount of wine and also added a little water (1/4 C?).  i added finely chopped celery with the onion - about 3 tablespoons.  the result was very thick and creamy and so much seafood in every bite.  i can't imagine it with half and half!  i ended up with 3 servings.

Loved this. Very simple and great taste. I scaled the recipe for 12 servings, which was perfect for a family of four. I served this in crusty bread rolls for individual servings. I used 2 cups heavy cream and 1 cup milk. 2 tsps. of Old Bay seasoning, no salt. Less wine also. Yummy! Thanks Katrina.

Very nice. I used two cans of crab meat and a package of frozen salad shrimp since they were already cleaned. I was on a tight schedule! The only addition that I made was a little cayene pepper. I wish I had doubled this recipe. Thank you for posting it.

Delicious, but EXTREMELY rich.  It also felt like it needed something extra.  We added lots of black pepper, but our spices were limited.  I would probably substitute some milk for cream next time.

This is a true keeper in my house. I added Old Bay Seasoning to spice it up a bit and used imitation crab. Results were great... only problem was that it did not serve 6. There were 4 of us and we were scraping the bowls clean. YUMMY !!!

this only stays fresh for a day or two, but it doesn't last much longer anyway! :) i agree with others in that it definitely does not make six servings...unless used as one of a few courses. also, i added lots of cayenne pepper. try serving this with french bread and a light salad. :)

This was yummy!  I made the following adjustments - I used low fat milk instead of the half and half which may have made it a little thinner but it didn't affect the flavour.  I also added some scallops.

If I could give this ten stars I would.  This was by far the best recipe that I have gotten off of this website.  I would not change a thing!!  This tasted just like the bisques that I have had in restaurants.  I had been burnt by another bisque recipe on this website that included tomato soup and cream of mushroom soup, so I was pleasantly surprised when this one turned out so well.

Like many others, I found this to be a bit salty.  Next time I'll use unsalted butter and reduce the amount of salt added.  Otherwise, this recipe was dead on with great flavor and ease in cooking.  I made it in 5 minutes flat and it was a great addition to my Christmas menu.

But you'll need to double your recipe to feed 4-6 people.  Everyone at my table got about 1/2 c. of soup in their bowl.

Like other reviewers I omitted the shrimp and doubled the crab meat.  This recipe was incredibly simple.  You can truly whip it up in 15 minutes flat.  I enjoyed the bisque, however mine turned out to be very salty.  Almost too much so.  I used canned white crab meat, which may have been the problem.  I'm not sure.  If I make it again I will omit the salt completely.

Quite honestly, I didn't care much for this - it was just a little too rich for me perhaps.   However, I must admit that my mom found it in the fridge and ate it all up; she very much enjoyed it!

This was my first attempt at a Bisque and it did not disappoint! I made it exactly as directed and thoroughly enjoyed it. The only thing I did not agree with was the serving sizes. Expect a bit less then 6 (more like 4-5) from this delicious recipe.

This soup was awesome!  It took no time to prepare and it was the hit at Christmas dinner.  Instead of the medium shrimp I put in a can of tiny shrimp (it was all I had at the last minute) and also reduced the wine.

I made this with crabmeat only, and we really enjoyed this soup.   It was nice and creamy, and the taste is different enough to seem quite sophisticated.

My picky family loved it!  I am tired of cooking the same things over and over.  I was looking for something new to feed the family and this is a keeper.  
Thanks!

I made this for a quick dinner one night it was very good.  It only made two small servings though.
I think I will double it next time.  Very easy and very quick.
