Excellent.  I used very ripe plantains, a cheap mozzarella, shaved, and Mrs. Renfro's (mild) salsa.  Made for a great hors d'oeuvre.  Thanks for the great recipe.

My first time trying this fruit! I liked the recipe, just missing some salt. Maybe I didnâ€™t put enough cheese? I tried with garlic salt and it did taste better. A keeper for sure!
