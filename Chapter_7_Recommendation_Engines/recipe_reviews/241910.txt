This  is OK, but it doesn't really compare to my favorite mix on this site (Taco Bell Seasoning Copycat). I think it needs minced onion, which the store-bought packet I used to buy has. Also in place of the seasoning salt, I think a beef bouillon cube would give it the needed flavor for ground beef tacos. I also thought it had too much cornstarch. I sprinkled some of this on fish that I was grilling, and it tasted great. It's still better than store-bought packets, and you can play around with the spices to find what you like.

Homemade Taco Seasoning Haiku: "Used this on chicken. But needed more than 'Cook's Note." Used whole recipe." I tugged about 1 lb's worth of chicken to shred off of a rotisserie chicken and put it in a skillet w/ the directed 2 TB of the above seasoning mix (which ultimately needed a bit of oregano in the end, and was very good, just not quite up to par w/ AR's Bill Echol's Taco Seasoning I). Ended up using the entire recipe's worth of seasoning, along w/ water, and simmered just as one would w/ ground beef, then served them in lettuce boats w/ cheese, tomatoes and onions. Very good and certainly not difficult to put together, and way better than any store-bought packet, but doesn't quite nail the ratio of spices that "Taco Seasoning I" does. Glad that we tried, and would be more than glad to make again another time.

I opted out of the red pepper, but it was still on point.   I now have a solid seasoning to fall back on.   Thanks for the add

A bit too hot when i added all of it to a pound of lamb on my tacos, next time I'll only add half as much. but still way better than the store bought stuff.

I left out the cayenne pepper but it still turned out great! Will be making it again.

Flavor came out just to my liking. Since we are not big on pepper I omitted the red flakes and the finished seasoning on our ground beef was perfect!

I expanded a little but pretty much used this as written.  Mixed it with browned ground turkey and make turkey tostadas that were wonderful!  Thanks for this.  Will make it quantity and keep it on hand.  No need for packets any more.

This recipe tastes ok but not exactly like store-bought taco seasoning.  I will use it until I find something that tastes better.  I am not sure what it needs to enhance its flavor.  The amount you make with the recipe is not enough for 12 servings--I suggest doubling it for that.

This worked fine for me. I used the whole amount on 3/4 pound of ground beef though. I left out the salt and used a saltless version of seasoned salt. Thank you cbowen76 for the recipe.
