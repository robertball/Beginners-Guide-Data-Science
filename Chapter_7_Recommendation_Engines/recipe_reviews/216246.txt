I am glad you all enjoyed it.  I would like to say that my original submission called for 1/2 cup fresh, cooked cranberries, but Allrecipes changed it.  I have asked them to change it back, but they have not.  I also added a comment about it and they deleted it.  So, please, when reviewing it, keep in mind that it is not how I originally submitted.

I took this to the folks for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  I made it exactly as written taking another reviewer's suggestion of using fresh cranberries.  I also added freshly chopped pecans on top before serving.  Delicious!  I am sooooo glad I ran across this recipe, thanks for sharing.

I don't use cranberry sauce, just wash them and stir the whole raw berries in with the yams.  They will bake nicely in the oven.  Beautiful and tasty holiday recipe.  Thanks again!

I made this over the holidays & everyone loved it and wanted more!  It's a great side dish.  It's not too sweet like traditional sweet potato recipes.  I will DEFINITELY make this again.  Yummy!!

This was the FIRST time my kids ALL liked anything having to do with sweet potatoes!  I do have to admit I kept the cranberries out - I love them but I have them in lots of other stuff - but everything else was exactly the same as the recipe here.  Will definitely be a repeat!

Love this recipe!  So much easier than past recipes I've used and really if you are going to mix the sweet potatoes with all that other good stuff there is no reason to use fresh ones. This is the best and yummiest sweet potato recipe I have tried and the one my kids have liked the best too!  Made it for a big family and friend Thanksgiving meal last November and it was a big hit!  Kids not only ate the marshmallow topping (usually this is all thy eat) they cleaned their plate !  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for my husband's 70th birthday celebration with a group of our friends.  They all loved it and because I am such a cranberry fan, I enjoyed it sooooo much!  Only problem is that it seems you have to serve it as soon as it comes out of the oven.  By the time I needed it for the table, the marshmallows were not looking so good.  However, the taste was still excellent!  Thanks!

I can’t believe I haven’t written a review for this recipe before. I pull this recipe out ever thanksgiving for probably 8 years now. It’s a hit with even people who swear they hate sweet potatoes!! I do change it up a little bit. I use whole fresh cranberries, and I use fresh sweet potatoes. I just peel and chop the sweet potatoes into equal sized hunks and boil until just soft. I use this in place of the canned yams which I find to be too sweet. It ends up being the perfect level of sweetness, with nice little pockets of tart from the whole cranberries. I also double it and put it in a huge casserole dish since people always go back for seconds!!

This was not a tradition in my family, but I've had it at other peoples' Thanksgivings and wanted to try it. The only thing I changed was using raw cranberries. It was good - but dessert sweet rather than vegetable-side sweet.

This is a recipe that my husband's family has made for years.  At the request of others, I bring it to every thanksgiving gathering I have ever been to and it is always a favorite.
Most of the time we "forget" to put the marshmallows on top and "accidentally" double the oatmeal mixture.

*Note the post about the recipe actually calling for fresh cranberries instead of canned.  You know the dish is done when the cranberries pop.
