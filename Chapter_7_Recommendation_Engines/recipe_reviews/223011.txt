These were so good. I used ground chicken and gave it lots of seasonings. Nothing better then meat and cheese on cheese tortilla chips.

The first time I made this was for my sister and brother-in-law.  We loved it and it was so easy.

These were pretty good but needed salt to give more flavor. I make something similar all the time.

Mediocre.  I followed the directions with no modifications.  Would be improved by adding chopped onion and serving with sour cream.  That said, I do not plan to make this again.
