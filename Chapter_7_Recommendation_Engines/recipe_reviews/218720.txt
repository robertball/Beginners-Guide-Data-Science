Very similar to what my Mom used to call "Little Pizzas", but she used toasted English Muffins for the base. She would sometimes add chopped mushrooms to the ground beef/tomato mixture.

I didn't think it was necessary to add all these extra spices, but the flavor they add is very good.  Only used a little crushed red pepper, personal preference.  Toasting the buns ahead of time is a good idea, too.

The only changes I made was to use Don Peppinos spaghetti sauce because that's what I had, I doubled the recipe and added some chopped pepperoni and my son used pepper jack cheese because he likes it spicy.  Very good!  Thanks for sharing.  Will definitely make agin!

When my grandma passed away, unfortunately most of her amazing recipes were lost as she kept them in her head. She was a cook in a school cafeteria back when real food was prepared. Little did I know the delicious "pizza burgers" we adored on Saturday afternoons were some of the same fare she made the kiddos back in the 40's and 50's. This recipe takes me back every time and I am so excited to now have a taste of what my grandma made for me to share with my kids!!! Sentimental yum!! And many thanks to the original poster of this recipe!

This was one our most favorite school lunches when the schools had lunch ladies that actually prepared hot meals!  I just made them yesterday and they are a huge hit!  I did not use paprika in my recipe, that's the only thing that was different.

I found this recipe because I wanted to use hamburgers buns before they went stale. My 3 yr old son and my husband both loved these! Very quick and easy for a working mom like me and very good!

This was good, but I guess I was expecting more from it.  Perhaps my memories of this dish as a child overshadowed the reality of what it is.  I still would make it again, and I do believe children would love it.
Next time I would half the recipe, as we had a lot of leftovers.  Each adult only ate 2 of them (1 whole bun worth).

Great recipe to tweak to your tastes!  I added black olives, turkey pepperoni, green peppers & mushrooms to the onions and ground beef. (and forgot to add the parmesan cheese) I also only used 6 buns (12 halves) and it worked out perfectly.  I'll be sure to make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for my husband and me - daughter wasn't home.  We thought they were pretty good.  I was hoping they would taste like the ones I had while in high school - not quite like I remember, but still good.  We will definitely use this recipe again.

Tasted just like the ones I used to have for lunch in school growing up although I used half sharp cheddar and half mozzarella like the ones I remember as a kid.

I thought these were great! I left out the red pepper flakes. They definitely brought me back to when I was little--our school cafeteria ones weren't good, but my mom used to make some that were similar to these.

Followed directions and ingredients exactly.  This was not something I would add to the rotation.  It was actually kind of bland and was more like a boring sloppy joe than a pizza burger.  Husband said it was ok.  I was disappointed.

I only made 2 changes. I added the onion right when I began the Hamburg. And I used American cheese because we were out. This was excellent, homemade sloppy Joe's. Took 15 minutes to cook all together. Will definitely be making again! I lied I omitted the  paprika also, I was  out.

I love these, we used to make a very similar recipe when I was growing up, but using french bread, halved horizontally and slightly hollowed out.  We used to put olives, etc in the ground beef filling too, and then topped with cheese and fresh tomato slices under the cheese.  Then after it was done cooking we would cut across the loaf into big slices.  We called it "Jumbo Pizza" and it was always a huge family dinner table hit.  The great thing about these is you can modify them with any sort of toppings according to personal taste!!!  Thanks for the recipe.  Yummy

Quick, cheap, easy. I actually used leftover ham and rolls from Easter for this instead of ground beef. Some of them I added leftover grilled veggies. Those were good too. I used my toaster oven and that worked great. I will definitely make these again during the summer when its too hot to turn the oven on. Next time I may try spreading garlic butter on the buns before the initial toasting for a little more flavor.

Hubby loved loved these! Only thing I did differ is I made them like normal topping pizzas. Added pepperoni and olives on them. We use ground turkey instead of beef. It gave it a nice flavor.  Pics a lil fuzzy tho. Delicious!!

The one thing I would do different would be to broil or toast the buns after adding the beef mixture as the buns seemed to get soggy.

I did twice as much red crushed peppers, pepperoni;s and oregano and they were delicious...thanks.  i loved these things in my high school days...great idea on a budget to feed many kids!!
