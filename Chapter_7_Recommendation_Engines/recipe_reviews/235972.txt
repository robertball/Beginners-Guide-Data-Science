I liked it, however when i made it the second time, i added Franks & Sriracha hot sauces , in place of the harshness of cayenne... I also added finely chopped smoked Bacon..  This is a good recipe...also one could add ancho chili powder in place of smoked paprika...

I made this for my grandson and he loved it.  He used chips to dip into it and also made a sandwich out of homemade potato rolls.  It was smooth, creamy and delicious.  Definitely a better substitute for plain ole deviled eggs.

I do not like avocados but I was looking for a low cholesterol snack this one is pretty good.  I ate it  with toast/crackers as a dip.
