I combined suggestions by previous testers, introduced my own touches, and my husband absolutely loved it!

(1) I used only 1/2 c broth which, as other testers commented, was the perfect amount.

(2) Based on another AllRecipes member suggestion, I used red pepper, which gave it another flavor tone.

(3) I cubed the squash, apples, and onions into large pieces, because I like chunky casseroles.

(4) Because of the size of the chunks, I baked for roughly 90 minutes, possibly even 2 hours (lost track), at 350 F.  No worse for wear by baking longer--just made the squash, apples, and onions more tender.

(5) Instead of white flour, I used 1/4 c wheat germ on a whim, and then added a dusting of whole wheat flour.  This absorbed the the liquid, creating a thick binding "sauce", and added an extra element of mouthfeel.

(6) I didn't bother "layering" but instead tossed all the ingredients together, which I liked because the cheese was distributed throughout.  I used 50% fat reduced Colby cheddar cheese.  Tossing the shredded cheese throughout helped hide the fact that as usual, it didn't melt terribly well.  The cheese combined with the broth to help create a sauce.

Instead of sprinkling the bacon only on the top, I also tossed crisped turkey bacon through the casserole towards the end of the baking time.

(7) To save on calories, I didn't grease the Anchor Hocking glass casserole dish I used.  There was absolutely no need because nothing stuck.

This review is written by a family that typically would not eat squash.  We are a meat and potatoes family and don't usually venture from the very typical brocolli, green beans, peas, carrots types of veggies.

I was unsure of this recipe, but had a squash I needed to use.  This recipe sounded the most appealing to me.

My daughter had 3 helpings!  My son ate 1 and everyone liked it, though it was pretty unanimous that more cheese would have been better.  The sweet flavor with the sharp cheddar was a great contrast.

Personally, I could have done without the cinnamon too because it made the apple taste like apple pie and that threw me off.

We chopped everything into 1/2" cubes, tossed it in the flour mixture, added the cheese and bacon to the bag and tossed that too, then added it all to the dish, poured 1/2 c broth over it and sprinkled a few red pepper flakes on it. I baked it for about an hour.

So next time, personally, I'd take the cinnamon out and maybe add a bit of cayenne or something to spice it up a tiny bit.  The red pepper flakes were good, but too hot for my kids.

I made this recipe as written, and my husband and I had the same reaction: "Hmm." It was odd. I love apple and cheddar together, and I like all of the ingrediants, but the result was not the interesting mix of sweet and savory I expected. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great, either. I wouldn't make it again.

This is an excellent way to serve squash to some one who does not like it. Because of this recipe my husband is now a squash convert. He never liked it before, and starting him out with this delicious recipe opened the door for me to try others on him. Great recipe. Oh and by the way, if there are any leftovers you can use a blender or immersion blender with some chicken stock and make a really excellent squash soup. Just blend adding chicken stock slowly to the desired thickness and then heat.

I made this as a main dish (serves 4) served with crusty bread. I didn't have 4 apples in so used 1 apple, 1 onion finely sliced, 6 small new potatoes and 1/2 cup apple juice and 1/2 cup veggie stock. Next time I would halve the amount of liquid as it was quite soupy, add pepper and some chilli flakes or similar to give it a bit of a kick. Veg was sliced to 0.5 to 1cm and it took the right amount of time to cook to perfection. Simple to make and tasty too.

YUM! I know what's going to be on our Thanksgiving table! I am vegetarian, so this is what I did.

1 butternut squash, peeled and cubed (I just used one of the small ones from last co-op pickup, about half the size of a conventional one)
1/2 red onion, diced
1 apple, diced
1/4 C flour
1 cup of water with one vegetable bouillon cube dissolved in it
3 strips of veggie bacon, cooked and crumbled
2 slices of sharp cheddar cheese, chopped
salt
itty bitty dash of cinnamon

I baked at 350 in my Pampered Chef Mini Baker (stoneware) until the squash was tender, stirring once.

Paired great with my curry dish too! So colorful using the red onion!

Cooking time for this recipe clearly fell short of that required in order to tenderize the ingredients.  Allow 60-90 minutes of oven time.  For my family's tastes, bacon crumbles would be optional.

We enjoyed this recipe.  Changes...added uncooked chicken breast chunks with other ingredients to slow cooker.  I cut squash in varying sizes up to 1x1, so big pieces had some integrity after cooking all day on low.   I didn't bother with the flour part, but did put the cinnamon in the crockpot.  I added the cheese on top before serving.  Good one-dish meal for fall.

This was a wonderful dish.....enjoyed the flavors!  However, we did use some vegetable stock because it was opened, and used the fresh bacon bits (Hormel I think), in lieu of frying up bacon.  My granddaughter had purchased a whole container of peeled, cut up squash (from Costco), so it was easy enough to fix and not nearly as time consuming as peeling & cutting up.  It's a must to do again.

This is a delicious and unique way to enjoy squash and apples.  My family enjoyed the flavor, but I won't be making it again.  Who wants to spend their evening peeling and slicing a butternut squash?  Unless you're out to impress, you are DESPERATE for something new to do with all your squash, or you have a ton of time on your hands, this recipe is waaay too time-consuming to be a regular.  I'd much rather stick the squash in the oven, leave it alone an hour, and scoop it out with a spoon, thanks.

Additional cooking was required.  Next time, I will cut the squash much smaller, after all , the apples will cook much faster than squash.  Taste was great.

Fantastic.  Left the bacon out, and used veggie stock.  Threw everything in the slow cooker, and cooked on high for 4 hours.  After that it was a party going on in my mouth!  A definite repeatable recipe.

Not bad, but the timing is off - after over 45 minutes in the oven (40 covered with the foil), everything was still very crunchy. It needs MUCH longer - I left it in for another 20 minutes or so, and wish I had time to leave it longer. But by that time I was really hungry, so I pulled it out and served it anyway! That was my main issue. The flavor was all right, but even though I love these ingredients combined in other dishes (apples and onions, apples and squash, squash and onions), I'm not sure I liked them all combined together. Or maybe it was the chicken broth. Something about the flavor was just okay to me and didn't really seem to mesh. Still, a nutritious dish that has good potential!

The dish turned out AMAZING. The only thing that I noticed, is the dish needed to be cooked longer than stated in the recipe.

I concur with a previous reviewer, this was odd tasting. It was fun to prepare, but I was very disappointed with the outcome. I added brown sugar to make it more palatable.

Sensational, and truly unique.  I took the liberty of caramelizing the onions and layering them separately. Don't be afraid to experiment with some sausage in place of the bacon too.  Looks beautiful in my small dutch oven.

Like somebody else has already commented, I like all of the individual ingredients in this dish, but it just didn't seem to come together the way I expected it too.  My family just didn't like it.  It tasted too much of the apple cinnamon combination.  I think if I was to make it again, I would cube the ingredients, omit the cinnamon, add more savoury spices and possibly some bread crumbs.

This was fabulous.  I may use less broth next time as it was a bit wet just to save the broth but did not affect the presentation or taste.

really liked it, left out the cheese and bacon as we are trying to cut calories. Used a whole can of chicken broth. Sliced everything really thin and was soft at the 40 minute mark. Will be making it again as a simple healthy and tasty sidedish.

I thought this was not all that great. I guess I just don't like butternut squash very much. I made it exactly as written, but I suppose that the "sliced" squash should have been fairly thin, since in my case, about half the squash was still pretty hard after cooking. The apples were somewhat nice, though (I used Golden Delicious). I must note that this did not reheat very well at all; I had leftovers for several days and they were kind of yucky. Sorry, but I'm pretty sure I won't be making this recipe again.

This was very good! We made is a main course, though (added feta for protein) and it was too rich for that! But as a side it's delicious.

I have never had butternut squash before and was worried about trying something new. I was pleasantly surprised. I used 1/2 cup chicken broth in place of the chicken stock and it was the perfect amount. I can see how more liquid would have made it soggy. I will make this again.

I have made this several times.  And always get rave reviews.  My sister "stole" half of the leftovers and wanted the recipe!  Coworkers finished the pan at our pot luck luncheon, and then wanted to know " what was that?"  Family ask for it when the squash first comes out of the garden.  A good sharp knife cuts the squash easy.  I peel it after I cut it into slices.

I'm not the biggest fan of squash, but wanted to try something new and chose this recipe.  I omitted the bacon and used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and it turned out great.  My husband, who says he doesn't like butternut squash, loved it.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I thought this was DELICIOUS! Of course i made a few modifications. I used monterey jack cheese only because that is what I had on hand and I added some nutmeg. The next time I make this I will use more bacon however i thought it was outstanding!

My family said they liked it but I didn't love it.  I followed the advice of others and used 1/2 the chicken stock and added more cinnamon.  I think you could go with 2 tbls of cinnamon.  I also threw in some more cheese.  Just cause I love more cheese.  Not sure if I'll try it again, although the advice of throwing in some chicken for a one dish meal sounds like a great idea.

My girlfriend made this for our recipe club and it was great!  I made it with a pork roast and it was simple and yummy!  A different approach to scallped potatoes...a great side dish for the Holidays.

This recipe did not work out well for us.  While the flavours weren't bad together...in the end it was just a soupy, cheesy mess.  I won't make this again I'm afraid.

I made this ten years ago (really), reducing the stock to 1/2 cup.  Although the flavor was good, it took twice as long to get done as the recipe said.  So, it was on my mind to make it today.   I used the 1 cup of stock as specified, added one sliced sweet potato and cooked for 50 minutes before adding the bacon and remaining cheese.  The result was a creamy, delicious fall dish.  I plan to make this several times this fall.

Next time I make this I would omit the Cinnamon, 1/2 the liquid, and add 1 cup medium cheddar along with the Sharp cheddar. I added cubed chicken and that made it a one pot meal.

I made this with kobucha squash and Asiago. My husband had never eaten squash of any kind, and swore that he never would...until I made this! He ate almost the entire dish- I managed to get a little for myself- and asked me to make it again soon. It's on the list for Thanksgiving this year, too!

decrease the amount of flour.   I made it with gluten free flour.  Needs a little brown sugar in the coating mixture and more cinnamon.  Also, try adding toasted pecans

I am trying to eat a healthier lifestyle so I tried this with 1/2 the cheese and no bacon.  It was good but not great.  I too added a little pepper flakes.  I've never had butternut squash before so I cut the chucks too large and took twice as long to bake.  Think I will make for Thanksgiving with all the stuff in it and everyone will like it.  I think alot of cheddar would taste great I just didn't want all the calories.

It sounds a bit odd, but it was SO good! The only change I made was to increase the bacon (and when is that ever bad?!) to make it more of a main dish. Sweet and savory, and made from all root cellared items....couldn't be better!

The only modifications I made were using the entire bag of pre-grated cheese & vegtable broth (I didn't have chicken on hand).  I took it to a dinner party & it won HUGE raves.  A perfect autumn dish & adequate as a main course.

It sure seems like the combination of apples and squash should be good but for me it is not. I think that the cheese may be the culprit. I tried all of the suggestions from others but for me it didn't work. My chickens thought that it was quite good though.

I was a bit underwhelmed by this but I think it was because in the Thanksgiving whirlwind of cooking, I forgot to add the cheese on top.  Without it, the dish is a bit bland but I fully intend on trying this again sometime with the cheese.  My family did enjoy it so I suppose I can't really complain!

Cheddar cheese is NOT a flavor that compliments cinammon and sweetness of apples.

Just think about it.  Would you put cheese and bacon on a pie?!

There are other squash bakes that involve butter, brown sugar, spices, and egg.

Squash alone is good with butter, butter/sugar, only spices, syrup, ...

Don't try the cheese, even though you may be a super cheese lover like me!  Don't waste a good squash and 40 minutes prep time to strike out.

I just mention that I like everything, and have never made something I didn't like until now.

My kids totally raved over this recipe. I added chunks of uncooked chicken breast, and sliced baby potatoes. I poured off some of the stock before I returned it to the oven, as it wouldve been too much liquid, but having it there to start with kept it moist. I will be making this a lot!!

Made in a crock pot (to save oven for pork roast) and i WAY overcooked this dish.  I'd recommend maybe 2 hrs, because 4 turned the whole thing to mush (i doubled the recipe, but even still... way too soft).  It was tasty though, so it wasn't a disaster.

Excellent side dish.  My vegetarian nephew loved it(used vegie broth), and my mother-in-law declared it a keeper - for special occasions.  My husband enjoyed it too.  Had to cook almost an hour though.  My butternut squash was probably sliced too thick (about 1/2 inch wide or so) for it to cook in 40 minutes.

I am vegetarian and eat dairy and eggs and made this to take to my busy friend and her husband on a night that she has a class after work.  They like veggie dishes and I made the dish as written except diced veggies into about 1/2" pieces.  I used vegetable broth and reduced fat cheese because my bag of grated cheddar had fused itself into one big hard chunk and I didn't feel like re-grating it after chopping all those veggies.  The ingredients filled a sprayed, glass 8" square dish, covered with foil and baked @350 in a CONVECTION oven.  The veggies were NOT TENDER, even after an extra 20-25 minutes. Since my microwave was not working I couldn't finish in there and this flop ended up being a big embarrassment.  I will try this recipe again, but will allow a much longer cooking time or may microwave veggies until partly tender before assembling casserole.  Rather time consuming as written and will be more so if microwaved first too.

Made a huge batch for a church potluck.  It was all gone quickly!  I had to substitute mixed tropical fruit and peaches for the apples, because I found I didn't have any after I started making it.  Yummy!

I really wanted to like this, as all the ingredients I love individually.  However, I found this dish to be a BIG disappointment.

Delicious recipe! My in-laws had given me a butternut squash from their garden and I had no clue what to do with it, especially sine my husband doesn't like vegetables. We did not have any bacon so I omitted that. We were also short on apples so I used 2 apples plus 2 pears. I also added a half cup of whole cranberries. I didn't miss the bacon but the added texture would have been nice. Next time I may add some walnuts. Thanks LJFQ27

I had to add an extra 20 minutes to the baking time, but it tasted alright.

I tried to like it.  It was just too sweet for me with all the apples.

I was a bit surprised at first bite at how it tasted, but liked it more the further I got into it.  I went with other member's suggestions and decreased the amount of stock.  I would probably add a bit more salt next time because it was definately lacking something.  All in all, it was okay.  I will probably make it again with some modifications.

I added chicken cubed up to make it a one dish meal and ommitted the bacon. It turned out strangely good, but not fantastic. I would use less squash, more apple, and definitely more cinnamon as I think thats what made it. Make sure you get a good coating of the flour mixture on everything ( I did 2 batches and doubled the flour mixture.)
Love the onion/apple/cheese mixture. :)

Another huge hit with the family. I used shallots instead of the onion as that's all i had in at the time, but it still worked. A keeper for sure!

It tastes okay. Cinnamon adds a nice touch, needs more than a pinch though. Overall for the effort I'm not really thrilled with it. Will not make again. Sorry.

I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it was just alright.  My husband said it wasn't terrible but if he never had it again in his life, it would be ok, so I'm fairly certain he (or I) never will.

Holy Moly, this was tasty!  I improvised a little by only adding 1/2 cup vegatable stock, sweet potatoes, more cinnamon, and a vidalia oinion sauce to top it all off.  One of the tastiest things I had a pleasure of making.  Thanks for the idea, it was a big hit!
