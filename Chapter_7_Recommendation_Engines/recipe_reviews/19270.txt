I also thought the mix was a little crumbly, however, I just added a 1/4 c. more PB and they turned out great!! Baked for 9 minutes and they were nice and chewy. A keeper!

I used butter instead of shortening.  The cookies turned out well.  Not very peanut buttery, I would recommend using more peanut butter than the recipe calls for.

Great cookie.  I wanted peanut butter cookies but had no butter, so I chose this since it used shortening.  These have a mild peanut butter taste, so if you are looking for peanut butter overload, look elsewhere.  I halfed all of the ingredients, and it ended up yielding 18 decent sized cookies.  I lined my cookie sheet with parchment and 9 minutes was perfect for these. A nice soft and chewy cookie - not sure what the other reviewers are doing wrong to end up with dry cookies.  This is a simple, fast and delicious recipe.  I sprinkled them with a bit of sugar as soon as I took them out of the oven.  Will definitely make again!

I made these cookies today and my family loved them I used the crisco butter sticks and I really creamed together the shortening and the peanut butter with the sugar until it was light in color then I went along with the rest of the recipe and my cookies turned out great.  I didn't get the crumble that others have stated and my cookies was soft.  I really think you need to know your stove and pull your cookies a little before they are done because they are still cooking while they are on the cookie sheet when you remove them.

I, too, had a problem with crumbly dough. I switched up 1/2 a cup of the white sugar for 1/2 cup of dark brown and it made them extremely moist, even after sitting out all night. I also added the extra 1/4 cup of peanut butter that several reviewers recommended adding. I am not a peanut butter fan, that would be my husband's department and he completely loved these, he said they were better than his mother's and that's a super hard act to follow. I like the fact that these only make around 2 dozen...with only 2 of us, things have a tendancy to go stale before they all get eaten. I will be using this as my peanut butter cookie recipe from now on. Thanks for the great recipe!

I disagree with all the negative reviews of this cookie - I thought it was pretty dang good, actually. It was sugary/buttery and had just the right amount of peanut butter taste mixed it. (If you're looking for A LOT of peanut butter taste - this cookie isn't for you.)My cookie mixture had no trouble with moisture, it mixed up perfectly with the directions provided.. so.. I dunno why mine was great and others had problems.. but there you have it.

I was so disappointed with this recipe.  Much like some of the other reviewers, whose comments I should have read, first, I added butter, milk, and more peanut butter trying to make these cookies suitably moist to no avail.  They were dry and crumbly and I could taste the shortening in the cookie.

I had no problem with the dough being dry, possibly because the eggs I used were extra large.  I've also learned to take cookies like these out of the oven a bit earlier than called for if I want them to be soft when cool.  I had some giant chocolate chips on hand and pressed a couple into the centers instead of flattening with a fork, and my family loved that!  Excellent recipe.  Thanks!

This cookie turned out great, however, personally, I might back off on the sugar.  My 13-year-old daughter and my mother in law, both sweet freaks, loved this cookie.  I am developing a different palate and thought the cookie was a bit sweet.  The composition of the cookie turned out fine. I do admit though, my Kitchen Aide always makes fine batter. My wife told me to use the paddle attachment when making a batter.

I made these, but added the 1/4 cup of peanut butter everyone talks about and they came out great.   The step where you dip the fork in sugar water, did not work to well for me.  The cookies kept sticking to the fork, so I just stopped doing this and it worked fine.

I have made these twice now. The first time I made them exactly how the recipe said. The second I added a half a cup more peanut butter. They are very delicious and to make them soft I took them out a few min early. Thank you for sharing.

I did not care for this recipe. The batter was far too crumbly and the cookies baked up on the hard side. The second batch I altered the ingredients so that I used 1/4 cup less flower and I split the sugar so that I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  This made the cookies more enjoyable...although I think the peanut butter needs to be increased as well.  Simply put, start from a better recipe and skip this one.

These cookies are the best! So light and airy and the taste is just perfectly peanut butter- not overwhelmingly peanut butter. I give this recipe a 5 stars! Definately a must!
I assume it's because it just uses white sugar and not brown like most PB cookies recipes. But it works. So light it melts in your mouth. The cookies are very fragile- but so good!

I followed the recipe exactly. Very good. not too peanut buttery. Just right. I baked for 9 mins but next time will bake 10 mins. I might also try adding 1/2 c oats too.

I had to give this a 5 star rating. I made this exactly as written except I used the butter crisco sticks in place of the shortening and I used crunchy Peter Pan PB as I love nuts.  My grandbabies loved them and so did me and hubby. The texture was that of a shortbread type cookie and nice and delicate but not falling apart when bitten into.  Just Perfect! Mahalo

Great recipe! I made an awesome fudge icing and made sandwiches with the cookies and fudge in the middle. To die for! I made a double batch and they were gone in 2 days. For easy fudge icing, put 2 cups marshmallows, 2 tbsp butter,  2 cups chocolate chips, and 1/3 cup half&half. I microwave mine in 1 minute intervals, stirring frequently for about 3 minutes or until melted together. You could also melt in a sauce pan. Pour warm icing over 1/2 of the cookies and place the other 1/2 of the cookies on top. Yum!

This is a great cookie.  I added and additional 1/8 cup of shortening because my mixture seemed to be too crumbly.  Next time I would add more peanut butter instead of more shortening to get more peanut flavor.  I used the butter flavored Crisco to give it a more buttery taste.  Excellent recipe

I gave this recipe 4 stars because of the texture- these are chewy soft peanut butter cookies!  Next time I will definitely add a bit more peanut butter because I didn't think they were quite peanut buttery enough- but I will definitely use this recipe from now on with only that modification.

These were excellent!! My husband is very picky but he loved these. Him and my son gobbled these up. If you like a lot of PB in your cookies then you should add a little more than the recipe calls for but I thought the amount was just right.

This is the best peanut butter cookies I have made. I think the sugar water fork print is what makes it so much better.

These cookies were the best, so easy to make my 3 year old helped out. And they were very soft and moist, Not dry at all. I baked them for 8 minutes and they were perfect. These will be a hit at our next bake sale!

this is a terrible version of this recipe; i left out a half cup of flour, and had to ADD another cup of peanut butter, as well as more shortening and some milk, and they still came out crumbly. i'd say go with the recipe on the hershey kisses bag, at least they spent some time researching if it worked.

These cookies were absolutely exceptional! The dough was a bit crumbly, which did make me worry that the cookies would end up dry, but they were so moist and chewy and delicious! I took them out of the oven once they started to turn a very light shade of brown. They were still quite soft, but I put a napkin over them while they cooled and they turned out perfectly! I'll be giving some of these to my neighbors because they have such a sweet little boy and he told me once that his favorite cookies were peanut butter cookies! Thanks so much for the recipe and God bless!

I'm not a fan of peanut butter (how ironic I was making PB cookies) so I wasn't big on them, but everyone else LOVED them, so I'm giving this five stars :) I got raves from everyone I handed them out to and they were really easy to make. Thanks!

Delicious.  I do agree VERY crumbly.  Hubby LOVES PB, and really likes these cookies. I cooked them longer than 10 minutes, and let them cool at minimum 5 minutes.  I will be making these again.  Thank you.

These were fantastic.  Not sure why others had such a problem with them being dry.  Mine came out moist and delicious.  The only thing I did different was used no salt added peanut butter but I added a 1/4 tsp extra of salt to compensate. Thanks for a great easy recipe Amy!

After reading the reviews, I decided to also add an extra half a cup of peanut butter. I made half the batch pressing down with a folk and the remaining by pressing into shape using fingers. The 2nd batch didn't crack at the sides when baked and where less crumbly when eating. The cookies tasted deliceous and I will definetely make these again. Thank you.

These cookies were a bit dry, but not so bad that we needed to alter the recipe.  We made them at Christmas time and had pizza delivered.  We had the delivery driver try one and he thought they were great.  We also topped some of them with Resse Pieces candies.  A nice treat!

I added a little extra peanut butter and did half shortening, half butter... It worked out beautifullY!! I may consider a touch of cinnamon in the next batch. I used parchment paper instead of greasing the cookie sheets. It allows you to move fast because you have less clean up.

I found these to be perfectly acceptable peanut butter cookies.  Not the absolute best I've ever had, but I was looking for a dairy-free recipe and this fit the bill.  The cookies came out chewy and good, and I didn't have any of the moisture problems that seemed to plague some other reviewers.

I read all the reviews and still tried this recipe. It was rather crumbly so I tried adding the extra peanut butter, that help a little. The mixture once baked was still crumbly, the flavor was great just hard for little fingers to eat.

I can see why all the debate on this recipe. This is definately a light, dry version of the cookie. If you want soft and chewy, this is not for you.

Overall I think they turned out excellent. I used Crisco butter sticks for my shortening, and sprayed my sheets with Pam. Other than that, made exactly to the recipe. Give them a try!

After reading all the reviews I made the following changes. I pulsed nuts in my mini processor to a fine powder to increase the peanut taste and replaced 1/4 cup of the flour with it. And since I always have Jumbo eggs on hand for Sunday breakfast, I used that instead of the regular Large. Moisture and taste problems solved.

These were pretty good. Came out crispy and light, dry like shortbread rather than soft and chewy. Had to work the dough a bit to roll balls of it, as it wanted to crumble. A decent cookie. Will probably make again. My 14 yr old son liked making these.

These were the best peanut butter cookies I've ever made or ate--they were a big hit at the crew camp where I cook. I added a handful of butterscotch chips, they added a nice touch. Didn't have any shortening on hand and used butter, still worked out great.:)

Pretty good! I was looking for a cookie recipe that didn't require butter, and these cookies turned out well. I was worried because my dough was crumbly, but the cookies have great peanut butter flavor and are a good mixture between crisp and soft.

The batter seemed a bit too crumbly, so I added a couple tablespoons of milk. The end result was a delicious, not too sweet melt-in-your-mouth cookie! My family loved them, and I will definately make them again!

These are really good.  Crispy on the outside and shortbread-like on the inside.  No cholesterol because of the shortening, rather than butter.  This will be my new go-to recipe for peanut butter cookies.

This cookie turned out just fine as is! Yum. I’ll add more peanut butter next time because that’s just my preference.

I tried it and if you do make this, you should know that  when you put the pan to go into the oven, the dough.MUST.  Be the size of  your pinkie finger or smaller! And let them sit and set for 30 min.-45 min.  Also,the center was so soft I couldn't pick it up. However it was sooo tasty! The only request I have is if someone can make it more dense.

I made these the other day using the recipe except I used margarine instead of shortening. They came out great.  Today, I am using splenda instead of sugar and butter instead of shortening.  I can tell the texture is different and had to use more peanut butter it still looks and feels a little dry with the splenda, we will see. I'm not used to cooking with splenda I was just trying to keep a diabetic friend have a little treat.  I may have to tweak it for splenda more?

Super easy. Based upon other reviews, I used butter instead of shortening and added a 1/4 cup extra of peanut butter. I used parchment and cooking spray vice greasing the pan. Thanks for the recipe.

This is the peanut butter cookie I grew up with. I added a few updates to it though. Added some dark chocolate chips and chopped cooked bacon...yup bacon. HUGE hit that I had to make another double batch on Christmas day!  Try it you and others eating it won't be disappointed  oh and I used 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c of the bacon grease/drippings andno was not greasy or gross just very yummy!

Before baking them, they were so clumpy and falling apart, and my "fork" deco was not good, but suprisingly they were pretty good. We enjoyed the flavor.

these were great. I thought they were kind of dry at first, but they are just a little crumbly. They melt in your mouth, very moist.  ideal amount of PB. I refrigerated these and had them the next day, they were even better a day old and chilled!

Made these for my cookie monster, who loved them. I found the dough too dry to work with so added some water and some peanut butter...texture was much like shortbread, which I think is what he liked best about them - I also used Splenda instead of sugar (diabetic), and it worked out fine.

I teach high school Foods classes. I gave this recipe to 2 of my advanced kitchens to test.  We followed the recipe exactly.  The batches turned out identical - a slightly dry, crumbly dough which was somewhat difficult to work with,but baking up to be very tasty cookies that the students did like a lot.  The edges of the baked cookies crumbled a bit.
I believe I will try adding 2-3 Tbsp. of milk next time, or possibly a bit more PB (although this would alter the taste).  Thanks for a good cookie recipe.

I added an extra egg and another 1/2 cup peanut butter. Though very delicate, they tasted wonderful. Will try putting some chocolate chips or a choc. chunk in the next time.

I think this is the best peanut butter cookie recipe ever!  I suppose I just like mine drier and more crumbly than others.  I always get rave reviews on these cookies, and I think it's because of the shortening (I use Crisco Butter Flavored sticks).  Thanks for this one!

I doubled the recipe and when I got to about 2 1/3 C. flour, I abandoned the spoon and worked the dough with my hands.  I was worried about them being too crumbly but the heat from my hands seemed to do the trick.  Because of this, this would be a great recipe to do with kids.....

this recipe was okay. The cookies were very crumbly, and they were not soft. I think that it would have worked out better if you used butter.

Good flavor, but way too dry and crumbly for the measurements. I agree butter may be better, or more of something moist. The first batch pretty much fell apart when I took them out. Might make a great pie crust or something.

This was a really good recipe and turned out really well! I was pleasently surprised when I made the cookies and they didn't fall apart. This is a good recipe for anyone who is just a beginner in the kitchen.

Great in a pinch. The cookies were pretty good, not to sweet. I added a few tablespoons of milk also, but I think they would've been ok without it. They were a good combo of crunchy and soft, great texture. My only complaint is that they did in fact tast more like sugar cookies than peanut butter cookies. I think these would be GREAT with a few add-ins. I say give this recipe a try for a good quick cookie, but move on if you are looking for something that has alot of peanut buttery flavor to it.

excellent recipe though I'm still trying to figure out how to make them a little more peanut buttery and less sugar cookie tasting. Doubled the recipe and yielded 3 dozen larger ones (plus some raw dough to eat while I was waiting for them to bake)

These were not bad, just not very good.  They were crumbly and dry, better after I added some water to the batter, but I wouldn't make them again.
