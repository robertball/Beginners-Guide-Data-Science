This recipe was a good start to something that could potentially fantastic. With a few of your own personal touches it has the ability to be really good. I would make this again with lots of garlic a few more seasonings and maybe a couple more vegetables.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I did make a few alterations, but nothing very serious.  I had to saute the chicken indoors because of the weather outside.  I used diced tomatoes instead of grape tomatoes, omitted the green onions, and instead of Cajun seasoning (did not have any), I just mixed more of the paprika mixture that was on the chicken into the pasta.

The chicken was delicious! The corn and tomato mixture was sweet but a little bland.

This was great. The tweaks I made included adding onion, garlic, broccoli, and red bell pepper to the tomatoes and corn. I also cooked the chicken in a cast iron pan then cooked the veggies in the same pan. It made more of a succotash style topping but it was delicious. Big hit, will make again
