I have tried this chicken over and over, and each time I do something different to make it more flavorful.  
Take garlic and onions minced together, with salt and pepper.  Rub it on the inside and outside, then put a medium peeled orange on the inside.  
Also, if you don't want to use onions, peel a head of garlic...and place the garlic pieces underneat the skin all over the chicken.  
Ginger is also a good spice to use.  Peel and grate fresh ginger, rub it on the inside and outside of chicken.
Hope this helps....

I would give this 5 stars for tenderness, but I gave this 4 stars since as some readers mentioned the original recipe was too bland for my tastes. I decided to jazz it up a little. First of all, I used a chicken cut into pieces (which saved me the trouble of basting since they were mostly covered in liquid). Also, I cut down on the butter by about half (I actually used margarine). I didn't have pineapple juice, so I used a can of pineapple chunks (liquid included). I also spiced it up with some hot paprika & an Italian chilli & garlic spice mix I had on hand (oregano,chilli, garlic, etc.) & stuck some fresh crushed garlic under the skin. I may have also stuck in a quartered onion, though I can't remember! What I do remember is that it was a big hit with my guests. So tender & such a lovely color! Thank you!

I thought this was pretty good.  I used 4 bone-in chicken breasts, and baked it for about an hour.  I didn't really measure anything, but I added pineapple chunks with the juice, plenty of soy sauce, minced onion, salt & pepper, garlic (2 cloves), & lots of ground ginger.  I made a thick sauce, using corn starch, with the resulting juice/broth after the chicken was cooked. I liked that, but my husband doesn't like sweet sauces with his meat.  He thought the chicken was good, though.  My 2 toddlers ate this pretty well, too.  I agree that you can't taste the orange juice too much.  Don't be afraid to add ginger; it's the perfect seasoning for this!  And I think the pineapple chunks (or slices) are a MUST to make it tastier & more appealing.

Oh this was the BEST ever!! The chicken came out so nice & moist.  I took it a little step further and I stuffed the chicken with a couple halves of oranges & some slices of pineapple.

I used a whole cup of OJ and pineapple juice.  I had to add water because the juice was burning to the bottom of the pan.  It had no flavor of OJ or pineapple, but was very, very juicy.  I used the remaining baste to make gravy which tasted great with the chicken (not so much the potatoes).

This is a great idea and I loved how easy it was. It was very moist but it lacked flavor. Maybe a little garlic or ginger or something would spice it up a little.

I made this last night, and it was great! My hubby liked as well as the kids. I followed some other reviews for flavor factor and placed a whole peeled orange inside the chicken. Also I used a full can of pineapple chunks, chunks inside chicken as well. I used a whole cup of each juice and seasoned chicken with salt and pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder. I also added a couple splashes of worcestershire sauce while basting. I wish I had had fresh garlic to put under the skin. All in all, very yummy.

This recipe was quick and easy. The chicken came out very moist. However, my family and I didn't think this was any better than any other baked chicken recipe. We couldn't really detect the orange or the pineapple flavor. I probably won't make this again but for a beginner it would make a really good recipe because it is practically no-fail.

I used Skinless, Boneless Breast Halves, (which shortened cooking time) 3/4 Pineapple Juice to 1/4 Orange and Lightly Seasoned one side of the chicken w/ Adobo (salt & pepper on both sides) I also added the pineapple slices during the last 1/3 hour of cooking..Family all agreed, the Flavor was really good, but the breast although tender was a lil bit dry.....whole chicken like the recipe calls for is probably best
