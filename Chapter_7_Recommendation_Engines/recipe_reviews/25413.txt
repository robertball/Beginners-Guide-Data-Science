If there were a zero star category, I would have given it that rating. Unless you LOVE the taste of CANNED vegetables, don't make this. I've been married for 31 years, and this was only the second dish I've ever made that my husband and I had to throw out because it was so awful. The first one happened the first year we were married. I thought I was pretty good at reading recipes and picking good ones, but this was truly bad.

Very tasty - this is now a part of our family recipe repertoire for repeat performances.  A couple of warnings, however: this is not a "mushroomy" sauce, despite all the mushrooms, and you'll wind up with way more sauce than pasta if you follow this recipe exactly.  Instead, I found this better as a recipe for a sauce that can be served over your pasta of choice.  The asparagus flavor is quite strong, but I didn't find that it overpowered the mushrooms, but rather complemented it.  Canned asparagus and fresh asparagus have quite different flavors, and if you don't like the flavor of canned, go with fresh.  Cooking it until it's very limp (similar to the texture of canned) will allow for easier blending.  If you do use canned, do yourself a favor and buy quality stuff, not the cheap canned stalks&ends.  My suggestions for improvement; onion and garlic fried up with the mushrooms, dice the mushroom instead of slicing, don't fry the peas, and mix the whole lot together and let it simmer for a little while so the flavors can marry.  I also found that I didn't need any seasonings beyond a little salt.

I had to add a small can of sauce to even get the blender to turn over to puree the mixture.  The asparagus really overpowers the flavor and I used freshly cooked asparagus instead of canned.  I cut off the tips to add to the mushrooms and peas on top.  Overall my husband (the mushroom lover) OK'd the recipe, but my daughter and I had a hard time finishing our plate.  I won't make this again.

First off, I never use canned peas or asparagus in anything.  Fresh is always better.  I would use just water to steam the asparagus.  Cook noodles in water until al dente.  Dice instead of puree the mixture of mushrooms, paste, etc.  I would add a bit more garlic and some heavy whipping cream.  Then serve over pasta.

This was very tasty to me.  I did however use fresh asparagus instead of canned, I like the crunch of asparagus that isn't over cooked.  thanks

I thought that the sauce was so flavorful and different from regular pasta sauce! It was like a party in my mouth! My husband was not on board with this recipe - he said that this "isn't his type of food", but I loved it. The portabella mushrooms on top were the perfect touch! They were so tender and the flavor was great! They added a great texture! However, as my husband evidenced, you really have to like "this type of food" - (ie - asparagus, olives, and mushrooms)!

Not only was this easy to make, but it was very tasty! It looked a little bland, but the taste more than made up for the appearance.

My family said this recipe should be rated F-.  I followed this recipe exactly.  The sauce was horrible.  The pasta tasted great by itself and the mushrooms and peas were ok together.

Made this with fresh asparagus (added a little water when blending) and fresh peas, so had great texture.  Was nice but a little "ordinary" - nothing to rave about but very filling - a comfort food rather than a dinner party dish.

I'm not sure if I didn't make it right or not, but I followed the directions step for step.  This think is awful.  I tried to finish it off with a lot of Parm. Cheese, but nothing could save it.

Ok.. So the servings must be wrong on this. I followed the ingredients to a T and I got a whole pot full of sauce.. I agree with the other reviewer that I had to add liquid to it while blending. I chose Vegetable broth. With all the sauce I can't imagine how only 1/2 pound of noodles would even dent this. I would suggest that you add seasonings to taste. I added about 3-4 tblspns of minced garlic, my taste to sea salt and fresh grated pepper, garlic powder and salt and onion powder. I also added an onion to the mix and I couldn't bear using canned asparagus so I used frozen. I also blended all the mushrooms and peas with the sauce because I didn't think it would look good on top of the sauce. My results were mixed. I think itâ€™s a pretty good light healthy pasta, but my daughter thought it was disgusting because of the color and texture. I ate mine, my daughter didn't finish her's and opted out for a PB and Jelly sandwich. I don't think I will make this again.. as I have enough leftovers to last me awhile.

I didn't pay close enough attention to the recipe before cooking to realize that the "sauce" in this recipe is actually a bland paste of mashed, canned asparagus.   The sauce could be better if mixed into a heavy cream sauce for a better consistency. Won't make again.

blek...i love mushrooms and thought hmm...sounds like it might be good...the canned asparagus was just too much and overpowered the sauce...and my weirdo friend the die-hard vegitarian hated it...and she loves everything...its ucky...but if you're feeling brave go right ahead and try it.

I really enjoyed this meal, but the kids did not. Its very flavorful, but you must enjoy aspargus and black olives to enjoy the flavor. I used fresh asparagus and frozen peas rather then canned, and i only blended half of the asparagus and olives and threw the other half in the pan with the mushrooms.  The sauce was a little thick, I think next time I may try adding a splash of tomatoe juice in it. I will be making this again.

This seemed kind of bland to me.  I think if I make this again I will chop some cooked asparagus and toss that with the pasta and probably add more tomato sauce to the ground asparagus, olives and tomato paste to make it more saucey.
