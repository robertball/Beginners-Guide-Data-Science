I doubled the amount of asparagus and it was pretty good.  I think next time I may add some fresh herbs and more asparagus.  I prefer more stuffing, less breading but my guests kept raving about them.

These got gobbled up quickly! The cheese does melt out of the bun fast so be careful it doesn't get burnt and stuck to the foil.

I had a lot to make so I just rolled these like sushi rolls cut in smaller pieces and baked like that. They came out beautiful but not enough flavor. O think they needed a nice dipping sauce to go along. THE KIDS loved them, and that's always good.

I used a garlic flavored olive oil to seal it , and after they were rolled up, I brushed w/ a little egg wash & sprinkled with Parmesean cheese as well as the Italian seasoning...I used the tops of the asparagus only -- I used the bottoms for asparagus cream soup.

Really good and simple. I wasn't sure these would have much flavor but the combination of cheeses is so yums. Everyone loved these.

I put 2 asparagus tips in each roll-up.  However, after piling on 3 slices of cheese, much of it melted onto the cookie sheet.  Next time, I will use smaller slices of cheese.  Other than the asparagus being a bit dry, it was excellent and presented nicely.

I don't know if I should rate this recipe or not, since I added baby bellas and green onions chopped finely, with the olive oil and italian seasoning, placed a 1 tsp on crescent, then cheeses, several pencil asparagus tops, rolled sprinkle italian seasoning on top then baked 18 mins. Tasted very good!! Will make again.

AMAZING!  These were inhaled, fought over, and bargained for by me, my husband, and daughter when only 2 remained left.  We dipped in melted butter with lemon pepper and garlic.

This is an yummy vegetarian alternative to pigs in a blanket.  The Alouette spread is a must for flavor! I also added havarti and Cheddar to give it some extra flavor. Everyone loved it!

I came across this recipe purely by luck; I just made a double batch for a Christmas gathering, and am very sad there were none left :-) The tedious part of this recipe was asparagus prep. When I rolled the crescents up I used my asparagus snapped in half (two pieces inside the roll), and patted one end closed, so the cheese melted out less. My oven took the whole 18 minutes to bake. I did not use the Italian seasons, as we do have some picky eaters, all to rave reviews! I did have one comment about the name (for a fear of snakes), but they really do look like little snakes, with the tips peeking out! Fantastic, easy appetizer that I am quite certain I will be making again and again! Thanks so much for something fun and new!

Very Good! I used Munster and Mozzarella, and baked them ahead of time for game day.  Warmed them up just before serving!

Used Swiss and mozzarella only.  Added more than one piece of asparagus.  When done sprinkled Italian seasoning and Parmesan cheese.

Yum - loved this snack, hate the name!  I had a hard time keeping all the cheese inside the crescent roll.  Next time, I will eliminate the olive oil inside the crescent and again once baked.  I think that just added extra calories.  I used low-fat crescent rolls, and dropped the asparagus in boiling water for 20 seconds and then immediately put it in a pan of iced water.  Some of my spears were quite large and I wanted to make sure they were completely cooked.  I will be making this quick snack again.  Great use of asparagus.

We thought these were good---not really good, but not bad, either.  I put the olive oil and Italian seasoning on top before baking them.  They did take 20 minutes to bake.  I liked the idea of them, and the name is spectacular!  Thanks for this idea!
