In my family this is called mystery pie. My step father has won so many recipe contests with this pie!! Our topping is a mixture of cool whip and 1 package of cream cheese whipped together. He tops it with a chocolate bar shaved on top and chills it overnight. Fabulous fabulous dessert. Reminds me of the famous "crack pie" at mamafuku milk bar in New York City.

This is a treasured family recipe only we used walnuts.  Great pie and easy to make (and unusual).
