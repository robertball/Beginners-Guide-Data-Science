For a Halloween snack I shaped the cream cheese into a shape of a bone and poured the sweet chili sauce over the top to represent blood. I will make this again.

This is wonderful as is! I've also topped the cream cheese with sweet chutney or sweet salsas. It's quick, easy and filling as an appetizer or a snack!

Great easy recipe. I will admit I find it easier to add sour cream to cream cheese so it is easier to dip

I make this with sweet Thai chili sauce. A trend used to serve this. it was my absolute favourite and I thought it would be a complicated recipe as the flavour was so sophisticated.

Thought it would be to simple, I really loved it. I don't think I would serve it at a party though...
