I can only rate the frosting as I needed some chocolate frosting for some cupcakes that I had made.  This was perfect and turned out great!  I did add a little more powdered sugar and milk until it was the consistency that I needed to pipe onto the cupcakes.  The chocolate cake looks good and I am planning to try it out soon.
