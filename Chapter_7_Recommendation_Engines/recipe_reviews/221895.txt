This is such a simple drink, it is a shame that there are so many odd variations out there. The trick to this drink is to use a quality lemon, such as Meyer. The standard American lemon is too sour for this drink. Also, cognac is often suggested as an ingredient, but a good French brandy such as St. Remy XO works equally well, if not better. I find that the smaller chipped ice works better than cubes, but use whatever you have in the freezer. If you opt for the sugar-rimmed glass, use superfine sugar for the best results.  Cheers!

Vary the lemon juice according to how much you like the sour taste of lemon. Most other recipes call for 3/4 oz. If you want a less sour flavor you can add a little simple syrup or agave.

If you are making at home I think the sugar rim is unnecessary, but to each their own.
