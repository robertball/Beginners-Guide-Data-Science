I made this almost as written. In step two I mixed it by hand instead of a mixer and I then used the KA to knead the dough. I used unbleached bread flour and wild, dried,  blueberries. not sure if that made a difference or not. I considered cutting back the sugar but went with the recipe and it's perfect as written.  Thanks for sharing, we throughly enjoyed this!
Update: I forgot to mention that there was no oven temp stated when I made this. The original recipe states 375 so that's what I went with.
