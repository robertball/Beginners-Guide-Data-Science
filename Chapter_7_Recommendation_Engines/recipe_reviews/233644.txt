Very simple recipe, I modified it a bit though. What I did was use 2lbs of lean ground chuck, cooked the beef and drained grease, then I put half stick of butter in the pan along with 1 packet of McCormick Au Jus mix and a packet of Ranch dressing mix plus 1/2 tsp of Cayenne Pepper. Mix everything together until meat is all coated, then of course I put it in a 3 qt casserole dish and put a pkg of french fried onions as the nest layer, then of course the vegetables finally topping off with left over garlic smashed red potatoes(skin on) and of course the cheese. My 5 year old son is very picky about what he eats and he could not get enough of this.

It was awesome! I did use fresh carrots and blanched them in a steamed basket on top of boiling potatoes and frozen peas! Also added 2cloves of garlic to meat mixture, and some sour cream to the mashed potatoes. Also melted the cheese and then browned it on broil. Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow! Tried to take a pic, even downloaded an app, but couldn't get it to work.  So yummy! Highly highly recommended!

Tried this recipe and my family has wiped out the entire casserole each time I've made it.  I substituted a package of mixed green beans, corn & peas (cooked it first) and came out fantastic.  One of our favorite recipes now.  Also used Better than Boullion and it was incredibly good.  Thank you so much for sharing this!!

I used ground pork with some fresh garlic and instead of the bouillion cubes which would have put the sodium over the top, I added some salt-free Mrs. Dash. Yummy!

Thought this was pretty good. I made the following changes:

* Used 2 lbs ground beef (1 lb really not enough meat)
* Added a little half and half, sour cream, and parsley to the mashed potatoes
* Sautéed about 1/2 cup of diced raw onion in oil in pan, 5-6 minutes, then added meat
* Used 1 tsp Better than Bouillon beef rather than a cube
* Dissolved chicken bouillon cube in 1/4 cup hot water, then mixed with soup mix and beef bouillon before adding to meat
* Sprinkled a bit of garlic powder on meat
* Used one 14.5 ounce can of mixed peas and diced carrots, omitted the corn (not a big fan). Seems like the 3 cans of veggies that the recipe calls for would have been too much.
* Mixed the peas and carrots together with meat in pan after draining
* Added a few tablespoons of water to meat mixture to moisten it a bit
* Sprinkled some dollops of butter on top of the mashed potatoes, after the paprika

I used the whole packet of soup mix this time, but might consider reducing it to 1/2 or 3/4 of a packet next time (flavor was almost overpowering with the full packet)

I made this recipe according to the directions and it was amazing. I loved it and, more importantly, my husband and 3 children all loved it. Great job, this is a keeper.

The hamburger on the bottom got way too over cooked in the baking dish.  I would probably mix the meat with the veggies if I were going to try it again but I probably won't try it again as the family did not care for it.  The potatoes tasted awesome though!

It was a bit too salty, but even with that it was really good. Next time I will use half of the soup mix and half of the bouillon.

Only change I made was adding two tablespoons of Worchestershire sauce too ground beef.

This was my first time eating and cooking sheperd pie. I didn't have cheddar cheese, so I replaced it with parmesan cheese; it still tasted good. This dish was easy to make as a beginner

This is THE Best! Every time I’ve made Shepard’s pie to was bland.  This was definitely not. I added roasted garlic to the mashed potatoes and 2 heaping tablespoons of minced garlic to the meat. Delicious!!

I would definitely make it again if I could remember what I did this time.  I started off trying to follow the recipe except I substituted canned mushroom pieces for carrots and actual beef bullion and chicken bullion for the cubes.  That made it too sloppy so I added a package of four pepper gravy mix in the hopes of thickening it.  Didn't work so I took some of the sauce out and added some corn starch which exploded the moment I tried to shake it.  Finally I just gave up, spread the potatoes on it and put it in the oven.  In the end it was still sloppy but close to the best shepherds pie I've ever had.  Even my permanently dieting wife had seconds.

This recipe was tasty!  I followed the recipe except I left out the bouillon cubes.  Felt it had enough salt with the dry onion soup mix.   DH loved it!   Would make again!

Fantastic! I've never had Shepherd's Pie before but this is definitely a keeper. Next time, I'll add Montreal Steak Spice to the ground beef. At the suggestion of my mother, I added roughly a 1/4 cup of natural yogurt to the mashed potatoes  and 3/4 cup of water to the ground beef layer to keep it from drying out.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and added one white onion, sautéed, to the dish. The end result was fantastic!
****
I've made this again since writing my first review. I added creamcheese to my mashed potatoes and omitted the extra cheese on top.  I also used low-sodium steak spice on my meat along with another herb and garlic seasoning.  The result was fantastic!

A good, easy recipe :)
I browned the beef and added ranch powder and beef stock, then layered mixed veggies and canned mushrooms, then onion soup mix, then fresh spinach. I added garlic and parsley to the potatoes and topped with cheddar. Tasty! And the leftovers are yummy, too :)

I loved the base of this recipe. Felt that the extra bullion.  simply added more sodium. Really not necessary. Did put in a half a cup of leftover sour cream, and made it much more hearty. I added  carrots, and diced onions laying around. This recipe is the great base  for what you have in fridge. 
Use 2.0 lbs of beef for sure, and the Potato count was great. 
Covered well. Thanks Marie!

It was way to salty with the onion soup mix and the two different bouillon cubes and salt. Next time no bouillon cubes.

This was,surprisingly good!  I used fresh grilled corn cut off the cob and frozen peas. I added sour cream and extra milk to the Potatoes to make it smooth out over the casserole. I baked it for 30 at 350 because of the frozen peas.

This was delicious. I made it for 12 servings. I always season my meat my way so I added garlic powder, season all and goya beef seasoning (one pack). Since I used the dry beef seasoning I only used one of the beef bouillon  cubes. I also only used one pack of the french onion mix.  It what seasons perfectly for my family. I didn't quite get to the picture-taking portion before we decided to serve ourselves but here's how it turned out.

This is a great recipe.  First Shepherds Pie my family loved. The onion soup mix is the key to getting the flavor my family likes.  I added some gravy and used my normal whipped potatoes, but the meat mixture really made this our favorite!

I've made this recipe several times now and it's been thrown into our meal rotation.  It's a good, simple recipe and my kids love it.  It's a good cold weather comfort food.  I double the potatoes (it's the favorite part for my kids) and use about a 1 1/2lbs ground chuck.  I also use frozen veg instead of canned (I like the crinkle cut carrot coins as opposed to diced carrots).  Also, I skip the melted cheese on top.   Be careful you don't over-brown the beef.  This isn't a really "saucy" recipe, if that's what you're hoping for, but the meat is very savory.  Leftovers are fabulous.

Really great recipe. I made it with instant potatoes the first time, and fresh potatoes the second time. It was definitely better with fresh potatos but delicious both times!

Next time I will either double the meat or halve the soup mix, as it was very salty. Other than that it was delicious!

Very good recipe, easy to follow. Left off paprika, and used two cans of Vegetable Medleys instead of separate cans of corn, carrots, and peas (just for personal convenience).  Cook time was right on time, and the end product lived up to the hype.  A winner.

Excellent.  My son loved it and even took for lunch the next day.  If he didn't I would know it was not a success.

This is also good for when you have leftover meatloaf (at least enough) to use as the meat filling in the pie the next night.  No leftovers.

This is very good.  I doubled the recipe and scaled back on the veggies.  A suggestion was made to pour some beef gravy over top.  Might consider next time.

I only added 1/2 of a beef bouillon cube and none of the chicken.  With a whole envelope of soup mix it would have been WAY too salty!

Not bad I prefer the onion soup mix over others that use cream soups. I make a "poor mans shepherds pie,
Ground beef, then pour cream corn, then cover with mashed taters (my grand kids are veggie picky" little garlic and onion powders "keeps the salt content lower" Worcester sause or soy is cooked in the ground beef cover the taters with cheese and bake. I also add mushrooms on occasion (shhhh don't tell the grand kids)
You can also use ground deer meat mixed with ground sausage for different flavors.

We loves this one. This will be our "go to" for shepherds pie. For the mashed potatoes I added rosemary and thyme and sour cream. That's all the changes I made. In the future I plan to use 2lbs of ground beef though. My family gobbled this up! We loved how flavorful it was.

We have made this many times and we love it. I definitely use extra potatoes, because I firmly believe you can never have too many potatoes. I also add more butter and milk to the potatoes for more moisture. I choose to use more corn and carrots and no peas. I definitely look forward to when we plan to make this again!

I cannot believe my whole family ate this and loved it.   I went to the butcher and had a London broil ground up, and followed the recipe .Since the London broil is very lean, I added a little more butter with it..This is definitely a keeper..thanks..Melinda

Over all I found the potatoes to be a little bland, so I added garlic. I used ghee instead of butter for them as well. Left everything else the same but simmered the meat for about 20 mins to really allow the meat to be seasoned. 

Great base recipe for your own modifications! Thanks LOVE2EAT!

I made this recipe just as it was written. It was tasty but way too salty for our taste. Next time I will omit the bouillon I think.
