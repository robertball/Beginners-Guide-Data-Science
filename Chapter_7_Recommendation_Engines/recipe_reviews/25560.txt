This recipe is not supposed to be like normal fudge.  It is supposed to be hard on top and goey in the middle.  This taste awesome!

I am NOT a baker, I don't have time and I'm not very good at it!  But as I was visiting a friend for tea and the British shops have very liitle good pudding choice I decided to go for it!   

This was SO easy and SO quick to make and the end result was delicious!  I did add a fudge icing (from this site also) and re-melted the whole thing in the oven before serving but ALL at the table raved about it and the pecan's gave it that something extra.

Highly recommended for impressing friends with very little effort!

This was the most delicious chocolatey, fudgey cake we have ever eaten!! YUM!!  I used a glass pan, and added about 25 minutes baking time, checking at 5 minute intervals.

This one would have been really good if I could have gotten it to finish cooking. I cooked it for 40 minutes longer than the recipe called for and the center turned out still slightly raw and the edges were hard. I will try it again using a larger dish than the recipe called for or maybe at a higher temp.

A precious tea room in our town serves a baked fudge and I've tried to find a similar recipe.  This is it!  It is the perfect blend of gooey fudge middle with a crust on top.  Add whip cream and you have a wonderful dessert.  Thanks.

The cooking time is really off as written. This came out almost like a Lava Cake not a Fudge Cake. I don't think I will make this again but if I do, I will follow the advise of another reviewer, bake it 45 minutes, cover with foil and bake another 15 minutes.

Well, I followed the recipe exactly...  After baking the cake for the correct time it still wasn't done in the center.  Forty minutes later it was done but the middle had sunk and there was a hard crust formed over the top...  I ended up throwing it away.  Maybe I screwed something up, I don't know, but I was very dissapointed.

I made some alterations to this recipe.   1 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, instead of 1/2 of a cup. 1 cup of melted Nutiva Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (It promotes weight loss, and a feeling of satiety, so I do not end up eating the entire pan of fudge!!!)   2 cups of melted semi-sweet chocolate chips. I replaced the 2 cups of sugar with the semi-sweet chocolate chips. It gave the fudge more of a 'chocolatey' taste, because I love chocolate!  I put the coconut oil and the semi-sweet chocolate chips together in a bowl and melted it, and I let it cool for about 15mins. before adding it to my dry ingredients.   I tried another recipe very similar to this one listed under baked fudge. The recipe called for pecans, but I used walnuts instead for this fudge. That is what I eventually found in my kitchen cupboard.    The fudge was divine. I ate 3 large pieces of the fudge, instead of the entire pan, because it was made with the Extra Virgin Coconut oil, instead of the melted butter.   PS. Make sure you cook the fudge at 275 degrees, because coconut oil burns at a high temperature! I let the fudge bake for 35mins, and I removed it from the  the oven. Absolutely divine!!! You will love the fudge like this if you are a chocolate lover!!!

Absolutely delicious!! I had forgotten all about Baked Fudge! We made this recipe exactly as written, baked uncovered for  40 minutes, removed from oven and placed pan on cooling rack. Of course the top sank upon cooling, which was expected having made it years ago. The top was crispy and the inside gooey, fudgy deliciousness!! PERFECT!!
