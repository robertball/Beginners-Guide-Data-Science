I really enjoyed this recipe. I made just a few changes and additions. I substituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese, and added some garlic and a little salt to the spinach mixture. I also only used one red bell pepper, as I think two would have been overwhelming. It turned out really well - my whole house loved it.

I sautéed the spinach first in garlic... A touch I highly recommend! Delicious!

This was a quick and easy recipe.  I didnt change a thing and thought it was great.  Cottage cheese is a great change from the usual ricotta in most recipes and red pepper added great flavor.

We had to add a LOT more sauce to prevent the shells from getting hard.  (pic posted) I made 2 batches.  I am not a fan of cooked spinach, but thought we could give this a try, see if the flavor is hidden enough.  there was waaaay too much (which is why I made 2 batches)  With my 2nd batch I ran out of spaghetti sauce and had to get a can of mushroom spaghetti sauce ::bleh:: which is all we had in the house.  My fiance would prefer meat in his shells.  I thought they were pretty good though.  DEFINATELY had to add garlic.  I took the advice and sauteed them with the spinach.

We really enjoyed this recipe. It was probably the best vegetarian meal that I've ever made. I served them with garlic bread and a nice vegetable salad.

Best shells I have made. Substitued ricotta cheese for cottage cheese. Use Bertolli's organic olive oil, garlic, basil sauce. Very cheesy & flavorful.

I just made this recipe. Came out great! I did make a few adjustments: used lean ground turkey and mushrooms to the sautéed spinach. When that mixture was cooled and well drained I mixed it with the cheeses and continued to follow the recipe.

This was very good. I went by the recipe but with the advice of others, added garlic. I used fat free cottage cheese and reduced fat shredded mozzarella. I also made half with ground beef added because my husband likes meat in everything. I actually thought the plain spinach/cheese without the meat was better. I will be making this again.

This was good. I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese, and seasoned with black pepper and garlic powder.

I am always sad when I reach the end of the leftovers. I've made this several times. It's easy enough to make for someone like me who is no kitchen genius, and it's amazing!

Could not find shells. Had manicotti on hand. Didn't have time to freeze a manicotti casserole, so had to cook the manicotti first. Rather than fight the soft noodles that were tearing anyway, we tore the manicotti into sheets & used them like lasagna. Doubled the recipe (only 700ml sauce tho), used 8 ounces of pasta. Layered: first a touch of tomato sauce: then spinach mixture, tom sc, pasta, ending w/sc & then the 'mozz'. Baked as directed. Added onion, garlic & salt, but otherwise made no extra additions (well, I did substitute some ricotta for some cottage cheese; and a little parmesan, and of all things, queso fresco for all the mozzerella - still very yummy).  USED FRESH SPINACH, AND SHOULD HAVE VERY LIGHTLY STEAMED WELL SPUN SPINACH IN ORDER TO REMOVE A LITTLE OF THE MOISTURE, BUT THE CASSEROLE WAS NOT UTTERLY RUINED BY THE BIT OF MOISTURE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CASSEROLE. I WAS AFRAID IT WOULD BE WHEN WE CUT INTO THE BEAUTIFUL CASSEROLE, BUT THE FLAVOR WAS: LASAGNA-LITE. This did not compare directly to a meaty lasagna, but my husband is quite pleased w/the results & so am I. My boys think the only way to go is gobs of meat & cheese, but hubs, daughter & I know better, & hope they will someday too. We love a meaty/cheesy lasagna, but are changing: won't always eat that way. A little leftover. Served w/fresh salad: so downed 20oz. of greens between the five of us, along w/a cucumber, tomato, onion, & some garlic.  That's what I call: Yummy, nutritious success!

So glad I tried this one!  Fits all criteria for busy family night...easy ingredients, fairly healthy (when compared to recipes calling for more cheese, plus ricotta cheese, etc), and actually pretty darn tasty.  AND the family gets lots of super-nutritious spinach to boot!  Try this one...
