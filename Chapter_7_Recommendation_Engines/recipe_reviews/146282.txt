I actually made these in the oven.  It was just to hot outside to cook.  At least inside you have air.  I did cut out the salt as I felt the bacon would add that ing. I also cut back on the brown sugar. Sprinkled a dusting of brown sugar onto wedges of potatos. Secured Bacon with toothpicks. Brushed potatos with oil wrapped in foil and cooked till tender.  Yummy, I do plan on doing the grill method as soon as it cools off outside.  Thanks so much for the post.  A new twist on a baked or grilled potato.

These potatoes are excellent. My husband does not like baked potatoes so I was hesitant to try these, but even he loved them! The sweetness of the brown sugar worked wonderfully with the bacon and potato. They were a huge hit with my family. I pre-baked the potatoes in the oven so they wouldn't have to grill as long. When they were tender I took them out and added the rest of the ingredients and put them in the fridge until grill time. It's a great, low effort, make ahead side dish. They only took about 20 minutes on the grill doing it this way. Very easy and very tasty!

I made this recipe by the method rather than using the exact measurements.  My potatoes were much smaller than baking potatoes, so I decreased all the other ingredients. I also got to try out the tip I had heard that said to slice the potatoes on the bowl of a wooden spoon to keep from slicing through.  It works! I baked these in foil in a 400 degree oven for 1 1/4 hours. The men at dinner really liked this recipe.  They said it has a salty/sweet flavor that really complements the potato.

i made these for my camping trip and due to the size of the potato, it took about an hour and a half to cook them.  I left them in the coals of our campfire.  The bacon was delicious, but our brown sugar mixture settled on the bottom.  still good!

I am not a fan of potatoes but this recipe intrigued me and fit with my "bacon BB" theme. Adding olive oil AFTER wrapping it in bacon – over kill on the grease factor I think - + what do you brush?  The bacon?
-	It called for 1 cup brown sugar for 4 potatoes.  I did six and felt 1 C was way too much
-	I left the salt out – already in the bacon
-	I wrapped them “loosely” but was afraid oil/fat would leak out so they weren’t THAT loose.

That being said, i would like to try them again so any suggestions are welcome!

Husband and I have made these several times both at home on the grill and camping over a fire.  The size of the potato does make a difference in cooking time and we did overcook them once but they were still delicious.  This has become a camping staple for us and is requested often by family members.  I don't use the brown sugar and do adjust other seasonings as desired but the bacon is the real star.  Hightly recomended.

Really great spin on the regular baked potatoe. Very tasty & sweet. The bacon adds just the right amount of salty to it. Yum!

I made these last night to go with smoked pork chops. I only cut the deep slices in the potatoes and wrapped each with 2 slices of bacon that was very wide.  Then I wrapped them in foil and baked them on the grill for about an hour until they were tender.  I was afraid the bacon wouldn't be done but it was nice and we both enjoyed them with butter and sour cream.  I will make these again because my husband wants to try them with some brown sugar cooked on them too. Not me, the bacon is rich enough for me.

I grew up & live in Idaho, so potatoes are one of my faves. I have done them very similar to this for years. Instead of the brown sugar, I douse a healthy dose of Tabasco sauce on them. Spicy, bacon-y & to die for! I may try the brown sugar....sounds good that way too!  In the winter I bake them in the oven, but love the smell of them on the grill in summer!

Loved it!  The brown sugar is the key, but not as much as in the recipe.  Just a good sprinkle.  Couldn't stop people from putting additional butter on the potatoes either.   But we were thrilled with it!
