This is awesome fudge, I absolutly loved it. Only thing I noticed was the directions read like you dont have to stir continuously while you're melting everything together, I've always stirred constantly when making fudge and did this time too. The other thing I did was use imitation rum flavoring instead of vanilla. All in all this is a great recipe and I know it will become a favorite holiday treat at my house (and my moms, I gave her the recipe and she cant wait to try it)

excellent! a must have for the egg nog lovers. My kids thought it tasted like Chai which is a favoriate in my house.
A few tips, instead of buttering a pan, line it with parchment or wax paper, it slides right out and makes for easy cutting, also refredgerate overnight before cutting and use a warm knife and cut very chilled or it will tend to "mush"

Made this for the 1st time to add to my Chritmas cookie gift plates. Excellent addition. Very rich (yet adddictive),so a small piece goes a long way.
Let pan set up in a cool area. NEVER refrigerate fudge (as Sheri Coleman suggests) it changes the molecular structure of the sugar & you will have gritty fudge instead of creamy!

This was absolutely perfect. I did not add any nuts because I wanted just the eggnog flavor. I did use half vanilla, half rum extracts. This was just what I was looking for.

All I can say is wow!  I substituted rum flavoring for the vanilla.  It's creamy and sweet; definitely calls for small pieces.  You should continue to stir constantly during cooking to prevent scorching.

The BEST Fudge Ever! I make this fudge every year during the holidays and give as gifts.  Everyone talks about it and looks forward to it all year.  I did make a few changes.  I used rum extract instead of vanilla.  I used pecans (I like them better than walnuts), increased to 1/2 cup   and toasted them first to bring out their flavor.  I also added 1/2 cup of hand chopped Maraschino cherries.  *VERY IMPORTANT*: Make sure you squeeze as much juice out of the cherries with paper/cloth towel before adding them.  It overpowers and you will no longer have eggnog fudge.  You will have pink Mraschino cherry fudge.

Yummy and very easy to make. Mu husband bought vanilla spice flavored egg nog and it came out great. We make fudge every year for the holidays and I have a feeling this is going to be a favorite.

Not my favorite taste, but the family LOVED it. I made it as called for except I let it cook at soft ball for a few minutes. I think I should've let it cook even a few minutes longer to set up perfectly. I also did half tsp. rum extract with a half tsp. of vanilla. NO WAY should it be in that small of a pan. I went for an 11 X 8 and it still is going to be fairly thick.

After doing this several times for many years now- depending on the pan you are using to boil- you may need to stir constantly AND if you don't have a candy thermometer you should let the butter and nog and sugar come to a rolling boil and then boil 5 more minutes and then add the marsh. cream and chocolate and other yummy stuff! Sorry for those who may have had a bit of trouble!

Everyone loved this recipe at church only thing I changed is I accidently put 3/4 cup eggnog and lots of fresh ground nutmeg it really makes a difference I did one batch with rum flavoring and one without the kids liked them better without. Also I did not use nuts since nobody in my house likes them but me. I didn't use a candy thermometer but did like one reviewer suggested and boiled for six minutes. two batches both came out great and I have never made fudge before.

This fudge is good, but the nutmeg is overwhelming.  I made this for gifts, and everyone made the same comment.  I will probably make it again, but will cut the nutmeg in half.

this fudge tastes just like eggnog. its very sweet. has consistency of a soft cheese. I liked it very much. Although, i gave it a 4 because I'm not a  fan of REALLY thick fudge, so I would use a bigger pan like a jelly roll pan or an 11x7 baking dish. using the square pan just made it too thick for me. i cut the pieces in half length wise. Very tasty recipe, though!

Oh, this is a serious keeper. I think I'll be making this at Christmastime from now until I expire. This was simply fantastic and everyone I gifted it to absolutely loved it. It's versatile with doing other flavors (though I haven't tried this yet), it does seem quite plausible that you could use any kind of extract that would lend itself to candy. I actually made it twice and used cashews which were perfect to match the buttery texture of the eggnog. I used grated nutmeg and cinnamon, so I expect I didn't use as much as called for, but because they were freshly grated, I probably didn't need to.

While I liked the fudge, the cinnamon and nutmeg were overpowering, and I could not taste the eggnog.  I will try again with half of those and more eggnog.  It tastes good, but not what I was looking for or expecting.

The flavour is great!  However, I found when I followed the recipe instructions exactly, like others have said, the fudge did not set properly.  I made a second round, heated the mixture to 140, then mixed everything with an electric beater.  It turned out much better.  Not the store bought fudge texture, but stayed solid at room temperature.

This recipe didn't work at all for me. I used semisweet chocolate rather than white but I don't think that should have made a difference. It didn't really harden and the eggnog taste was so strong that it tasted like it had alcohol in it.

First time making Creamy Eggnog Fudge!  I didn't have a candy thermometer so I followed directions in a similar recipe and let it boil while constantly stirring for 8 minutes.  Turned out PERFECT!  For presentation it also helps to sprinkle a little nutmeg on the top once you pour the mix into a pan.

I did modify it slightly by removing the walnuts, rum extract, and cooling to the typical 120 before adding the flavorings the second time. But honestly, my first time, I followed it exactly as written with really good results. With the egg nog I had, on the 2nd round, I didn't see the need for the rum extract, until it set up. You'll need it.

I made this fudge to give as gifts at Christmas but was disappointed in the appearance.  I always follow recipes to a T.  It tasted amazing but it did not set like other fudge so when I tried to cut it in squares, it was too soft and looked like a mess.  I'm guessing it is because it is made with marshmallow cream instead of sweetened condensed milk like most fudges.  I had no time to do another recipe so I still gave it out but apologized to everyone telling them "it tastes good but doesn't look good because it didn't firm up".  People had to eat it with a spoon.

This was a last minute decision for me at Christmas. What a great idea! I did find that I needed to cook it longer than the recipe said, and didn't let it go quite long enough. I had to put it in the freezer to keep the shape. But I think the longer cooking time resulted in a completely smooth texture, not even a tiny bit grainy (I don't care for grainy fudge). All in all, I would totally do this again, I might even buy some extra eggnog to keep in the freezer to have a special treat during the year!!

This is really good!  If you like eggnog you will love this.  I made it for a cookie sale at church and everyone who tasted it loved it. It was one of the first cookie/candy to sell out.  I did leave out the nuts and added rum flavoring instead of vanilla. My son asked me to make another just for him.

I find this is a very soft fudge so the second time making it I took the temperature to 140 and it seemed to help.

This was my first eggnog fudge,  and it came out beautifully! The only change that's needed, as other people have said,  is that you need to stir constantly to avoid scorching.  Enjoy!

Only thing I did differently was skip the nuts and used a little less sugar. I did stir the mixture constantly, as another reviewer suggested, however, I must have done something a little off, because after setting in the fridge overnight, it was not firm enough; the texture was gooey, and it was difficult to cut into. The spices were overpowering, even though I love cinnamon and nutmeg.

I reduced the nutmeg based on reviews.  I will make as directed next time as I don't believe following the recipe would have been overpowering with nutmeg flavor.  Excellent recipe.  A keeper.  Thanks for sharing.  Best eggnog fudge on this site.

The only thing I changed was using rum instead of vanilla, and halved the nutmeg and cinnamon as suggested by others, which should have no affect on the outcome, other than the taste.  What I ended up with was a crumbly mess.

This was a huge hit with my family, and co-workers.  It's also the first and only fudge I've tried to make. I will try more later on. I cut the nutmeg in half as I'm not a big fan of it's flavor.

this fudge is AMAZING! The only thing I changed was I only put in a half a tsp of nutmeg, but that was just due to personal taste. I will be giving this away as Christmas gifts.

Used "So Delicious Coconut Eggnog" (dairy-free) instead of traditional eggnog. Omitted the vanilla, since the white chips have enough vanilla taste.  Color, texture and taste were all excellent.

Not my favorite but everyone else loved this.  I doubled the vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon which were fresh ground and added a large pinch of all spice and red curry, my seasoning enhancers, and this tasted creamy and rich.

Just finished making this.  It's a little nutmeg heavy.  Also, it MUST be stirred occasionally.  Mine scorched a little bit but not enough to affect the flavor.  Next time I make it, less nutmeg and give it a stir waiting for soft-ball stage.

When I popped in the candy thermometer it was at the 235 degree required-seemed a little odd to me so I continued boiling and stirring until it went to 240 degrees. This recipe seems very runny and sticky. I hope this sets for me as I want to mail it to a family member. Will let you know what happens.

This eggnog-flavored fudge is O.K., but I probably will not make again.  I am glad that I used half the nutmeg indicated in the recipe.

My 9 year old son raves about this year round.  As soon as eggnog is seen in the grocery store we make some.  Then we make it again at Christmas.  
It does make a unique gift for friends and neighbors.

I followed the recipe, except to reduce the nutmeg to 1 teaspoon.  I am so glad that I did because the spices were very powerful in this fudge.  It is soooooo sweet and is not creamy.  This fudge was so hard, it was almost impossible to cut, and when I was finally able to cut it, it crumbled in a lot of places.  One of my kids, who really loves cinnamon, likes this, but the rest of us do not care for it.

I didn't have a candy thermometer when I made this, so I just boiled it for 5 min.  Also added a splash of spiced rum.  It never set up...the consistency was something like marshmallow fluff.  So I ended up spreading it on cinnamon graham crackers--and the fiance loved it!  Taste was great!  I'm going to try this again with a candy thermometer and possibly reducing the butter somewhat to try to get it to set up.

It tasted good, REALLY sugary I thought but everyone else loved it so maybe that was my imagination (I mean, it's fudge right?)... It would NOT set for me, though. I waited overnight, hoping it just needed some extra time, but no luck... I eventually put it in the freezer for 10 just to get it to harden enough to ice cream scoop into cupcake cups as I showed in the pic I submitted. It was still a hit, though, surprisingly.

Even though I am not a big Eggnog fan, I thought that the flavor was good. however, next time I will definitely take the advice of others and decrease the amount of sugar. I am a sweet tooth an even I found it too sweet.

Love it.  My husband, who has particular tastes when it comes to sweets, raved.
Follow the directions and will turn out.  Easiest fudge I've ever made and the best.
