I used half veal and half ground turkey (85/15), replaced the carrots with 1/2 c. diced celery that was sauteed until soft, and subsituted green onion for white onion.  The result was great! It was tender and juicy, and my husband loved it.

I prepared this using just one pound of my grocers 'meatloaf mix' meat (beef/pork/veal) and it turned out beautifully!  I will certainly add this one to my recipe box.  Thanks for sharing.

Dee-Lish.

I took a hint from another review and included some fine chopped celery. I subbbed half an envelope of onion soup mix for the onion. I baked it in a loaf pan. I made a really easy sauce I picked up with a turkey meat loaf recipe that you make by pureeing roasted red pepper with a bit of balsamic salad dressing. This is good enough to serve to guests.

This dish was awesome. I refused to eat meatloaf as a kid so when my husband asked me to make it I was less that excited. We did swap out ketchup for our fav BBQ sauce and used about 1/2 cup mixed in and 1/2 cup lathered on top.  When it was done in the oven we cut it into slices and then seared it on the griddle for a little crisp. Yum yum!

Much much better than any beef meatloaf.  The smell in the kitchen was to die for.

I thought this was terrible.  Neither myself nor my 13 month old enjoyed it one bit.  I actually gagged.  Terrible taste.  I threw the whole loaf away!  What a waste of money!  Good thing I 1/2'd the recipe!  I love meatloaf made with all three meats - beef, pork and lamb.  Guess I'll stick to the 3 meat loafs in the future.

Tried this over the weekend and wow!!! it was a great hit.  It's just my husband and I so I made 2 loafs and froze one for later.  The only two changes was from another recipie I added some oyster mushrooms, chopped and to the ketchup on top I added 2 tablespoons of Nance's Chili Sauce which gave it a little sweet taste which we love. Thnks for a great meat loaf

Loved this one! Followed the recipe as written - well, except for my mistake! I put the entire 1 cup ketchup in the meat mixture. No harm done. It was still delish, just extra moist. And since I dumped in all the ketchup, I decided to top it with our favorite bar-b-que sauce. Fantastic! Next time, I may cook the onions a bit first, but I can't say the crunch did any harm. And, like other reviewers, I must report that my house smelled amazing! Thanks, Marylou!

I thought this was delicious!  I made it almost as written, except without an egg, since I was out.  I didn't taste the carrots at all, so it might be a good way to sneak them in with kids.  Yum!

A classic, traditional meatloaf. This was moist, flavorful, and not nearly so heavy (or greasy) as ground beef meatloaf. I made a half recipe, following the directions as written. The baking instructions were accurate, even for a half-recipe. I appreciate that they include an internal temperature to measure doneness. I enjoy the mild flavor and the fine texture from using veal. This is my new favorite meat loaf.

Great recipe.  The only thing I changed was cutting the recipe in half and making mini meat loafs.  Still great the next day for lunch.

This meatloaf was amazing! I hardly ever make meatloaf, but I will make this more often because my whole family (hubby, kids 5 and 7) really liked it. I made it as directed, except for substituting chili sauce for the ketchup that was baked in, because I happened to have chili sauce to use up. I served it with roasted garlic and cauliflower and wild rice. Yum!

I didn’t follow the recipe as written so I didn’t rate it 5 stars. I followed suggestion from  other reviews. I had a pound of veal and 1/4  lb of ground sirloin. I sautéed the garlic, onion and shredded carrots ( I had no celery). I only used an1/4 c of diced onion because  I also used Onion Recipe Dip as suggested in another review. )  Used our favorite BBQ sauce instead of ketchup because my daughter hates ketchup. Other than these changes, I did what the recipe called for. I used a cast iron loaf pan lined with nonstick foil. I followed the temperature and time set. It came out really good and moist and tender. This is how I am going to make meatloaf from now on.

No, not "Yummy". Awesome! Best meatloaf we ever had. Didn't have carrots, so added some peas and celery. Sauteed onions and garlic slightly before adding to mix. And used a 50% ketchup and 50% BBQ sauce mix (my favorite 4Rivers BBQ sauce from Orlando). Will make again and can't wait for leftovers.

Loved it! I usually make all recipes as written the first time but my grocery store did not have plain ground veal so I made it with meatloaf mix. Wow! It will be greater even still with straight veal. Don’t change a thing.

I used venison instead of veal and it was excellent.  It set up well, was dense and cut nice and firm, making it excellent for sandwiches for leftovers the next day.  The carrots made it moist.  I added  some finely chopped jalapenos for a little heat and mixed some spicy BBQ sauce with the ketchup.  My husband and I definitely thought it was probably the best meatloaf I have ever made.  YUMMY for sure!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was excellent. The texture is much softer than a traditional meatloaf. Flavor was perfect.

Great recipe! I added chopped carrots and also used tomato sauce instead of ketchup.

Great change to regular beef meatloaf! I used 1.5lb veal and 1lb beef and followed everything else to the letter! Beautiful tasting and great stability when cutting slices for sandwiches. The next time I use this recipe, I'll only be changing the temp to 350 for a little more moisture otherwise awesome!

I used meatloaf mix (beef/pork/veal) and added more garlic and onions to satisfy requests from the dinner table.  It was delicious and loved by all!

Hubby liked it. While it was certainly edible, I feel it lacked flavor, and I followed the recipe to a T. So next time I make it, I will be adding some extra spices to try and give it more kick. The ketchup certainly worked to give it a lot of moistness though!

I tried this last night and it was a hit!!  My husband said this was "the best meal I've ever made."  I changed the serving to 4 and used only 1 pound of meat and also did not add the carrots or chili powder.  Still very good!!!.
