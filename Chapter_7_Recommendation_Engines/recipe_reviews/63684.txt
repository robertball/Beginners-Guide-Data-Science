This salad is wonderful. I have it once a week! It is great for phase 1, 2, and 3 of the South Beach Diet.

Best salad I've ever tried.  I just tried it and plan on making it all the time.  I was a little nervous at first because it sounded TOO healthy, but it taste SO GOOD!  I was surprised that it didn't have a lot of other ratings so I felt compelled to send in a review!

This recipe appealed to me because it didn't require mayo. It didn't have a lot of flavor to it, but it was pretty ok. I had only one lime and substituted with the rest with lemon. I didn't put in the radishes because I don't like them. This recipe needs *something*, but I'm not quite sure what it's missing.

This was really yummy. I skipped the avacado, because i hate it and added some mushrooms...Very good. Warning! you may not enjoy if you dont like peppery, garlicy stuff. If you dont mix the dressing in and just try to drizzle it on top and eat it you'll choke to death! stir it up first and move all those flavors around!

This recipe is very good.  My Husband is the Tuna lover not me, but I have to say I like this salad and will make it often.
I did not use lettuce but instead used fresh packaged spinach for a little more nutritional value.  The dressing is not to over powering so if you like a strong dressing taste I would just add your favorite oil dressing to this recipe.

I agree with another reviewer who said this was missing something.  Next time I think I might add some garbanzo beans and a little hot pepper sauce or red pepper flakes.

Sorry, I'm a big salad eater, but this one didn't turn my crank at all.  I didn't care for the dressing at all.

This was a nice healthy blend of vegetables. I did not use tuna ( had it the day before). I used a hard boiled egg instead. Also added some poppy seed dressing to the original dressing---I thought it need a little something sweet. The original dressing would be fine if I was dieting. Also liked the stacking approach---veggies stayed crisp provided you do not add salad dressing. I was able to eat this salad two days in a row and it was just a good the second day.

This is one of the best tuna salads I've ever eaten.  I've made it a couple of times now.  I didn't have any lines on one occasion, and so I used lemons for the dressing.  It was still wonderful!

I added fresh chopped rosemary to the dressing ingredients.  Very good.  Have made twice...once without the Tuna and it was still very good.

I thought it was a great blend of flavors.  I made the dressing with lemon instead of lime juice and I actually preferred it that way.

I hated this. My boyfriend, his best friend and I are on the South Beach Diet and we all agreed NEVER AGAIN will we use this recipe. I dont know what it was, I'm guessing the dressing because I enjoy everything else in the salad.

This is one of my favorite SB lunch recipes.  However, I totally understand why many don't enjoy it, and I recommend doing what I usually do, which is to make tuna steaks for dinner one night, making a little extra, and then make this recipe for lunch the next day using the leftover tuna steaks.  There is an ENORMOUS difference between "fresh" (you can get it frozen) vs. canned tuna.  I bet it will make all the difference!

I just loved this when I was on the diet and have made it regularly ever since.  This is my favorite recipe from this diet!  I love the different flavors all mixed up in this salad.  I agree that you have to use good tuna (well drained).

This has been my lunch staple.  I love it, and the veggies are flexible.  I use lemon juice instead of lime.  The key is using really good tuna.  Albacore, and not the catfood stuff.  Geisha is my favorite, the nice chunky kind that doesnt taste fishy.  I would probably even eat this if I wasnt doing south beach.

I love this salad too! The dressing is garlicky and very flavorful! The others are right-it is a nice filling salad-perfect for Phase 1!

Maybe I'm just not that much of a tuna fan, but I found this recipe to just be "OK"

It was difficult to save any leftovers, since the tuna made it too runny. I will have it again because it's so easy to make, but I think I'll just use vinegar and oil instead of making the dressing.

I had this salad for lunch today. I didn't have any radishes or avocados, so I left those out. Instead I added alfalfa sprouts, which I LOVE! I also didn't like the dressing they listed, so I just made my own with a little mayo thinned with oil. When I took the first bite, I thought it tasted really bland, so I added some fresh ground pepper, and it was better. This salad was pretty good.

The dressing was very bland. I added a chopped up pickle slice and a little bit of onion and I think that helped. I didn't use the avocado because I don't like them. It's especially disappointing that a dressing with this much oil in it would taste like nothing. With a restricted diet, it feel like a waste to use all that oil for something that tasted like nothing.
