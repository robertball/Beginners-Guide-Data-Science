Excellent rice dish.  Must mention that you must use Arborio rice in order to achieve maximum creaminess!  I substituted chicken instead of vegetable broth and omitted the celery.  My friends raved all the same.

I made this for a dinner party, and it makes way more than four servings!  All of it was eaten, though, and everyone thought I was magic or something.  I did used skim milk and fat free half and half instead of whole milk and heavy cream, and it was plenty rich and creamy.  Definitely worth the effort if you want to impress a date or a dinner party!

A good recipe overall.  Use half the cream.  The  5 cups of broth are more of a maximum amount you will need - use common sense and stop adding broth when the rice is cooked.  I used chicken broth instead and added chicken.

this is not rissotto.  Is is a nice mushroom rice but real rissoto does not contain milk.  The creaminess comes from the starch in the rice.

absolutely delicious - I didn't have cream so I didn't bother, but it didn't need it, still was really creamy.  took forever to cook but was worth it.  I added dried rosemary and fresh minced garlic.

What a delicious tasting risotto!!  I substituted minced garlic, dried parsley and used skim milk.  Made no difference to the taste.  Directions incomplete.  Did not tell you how or when to add the chicken broth.  However, as I had made risotto before I knew to add it,  one cup at a time.  Would highly recommend this dish.

really good recipe!!
it was my first ever risotto & it turned out to be pretty tasty!!
make these minor adjustments to make it perfect :
1. completely skip cream. it makes the risotto too heavy.
2. you dont have to add all 5 cups of broth. use common sense; when the rice tastes right, you should stop adding broth.

I served this risotto as a side dish, with london broil and caesar salad, for my husband's birthday dinner.  Everyone loved it.  My mother-in-law helped me make the risotto and it came out great.  We increased the recipe to serve six people.  We used a variety of exotic and dried mushrooms including black trumpet mushrooms.  We soaked the dried mushrooms in warm water for 30 minutes.  We saved this mushroom water and included it with the broth.  We used chicken broth instead of vegetable stock and we used Arborio rice (a must for risotto).  To keep things moving quickly we warmed the broth in a large pot along side the risotto on the stove.  We had a little extra broth left over (probably because we added the additional water from the mushrooms).  It took about 30-40 minutes for the rice to absorb all the stock.  Great recipe.  We will make it again soon.

Wow, this was delicious!!  Next time, I'm going to leave out the celery as it gave it a weird, and unnecessary flavor.  Everything else was superb!  Will make again for sure!

This is a very good risotto.  I had some mushrooms that I needed to get rid of, so I used 2 full cups of mushrooms instead of 1.5 and it didn't seem like too much at all.  I used only one medium yellow onion, left out the celery because I didn't have any, used nonfat milk instead of whole, and only used 2 cups of the vegetable stock (5 seemed like way too many and 2 plus the milk & cream cooked the arborio rice just fine).  My husband ate about 90% of this recipe in one sitting for dinner.  I guess he liked it!!

I have to give this recipe five stars because the flavor is phenomenal!  Perfect, really.

That said, it took about three hours to cook, and even then, it wasn't quite finished (the rice was still too firm).  I don't know if it's our high altitude, the fact that I used brown rice, or that the recipe is wrong.  My son went to bed before it was finally finished cooking (we made him a quesadilla instead), and our baked potatoes went cold.  After three hours, we were tired and hungry and couldn't wait anymore.  We ate it, and it was sooooo good, but we were frustrated that it took so long to cook when the recipe says 35 minutes.

Thick, creamy, delicious even before adding the cheese or butter.  I used a mixture of portabella, crimini, and white mushrooms, and will probably add more mushrooms next time due to personal preference.  I didn't add salt because the broth and cheese made it sauce enough.  However, I added 4x the amount of garlic, 2x the amount of parsley and 1/4 tsp black pepper total.  Also, I added the broth in smaller increments--about 1/4c at a time and remember to stir, stir, stir!

Was asked for the recipe and got compliments like "very delicious" and "filling."

This was tasty, flavor-wise, it was really good, but a few things:  this recipe calls for "rice" but i might specify what type of rice.  I used regular rice, so after it got cold, it became a bit clumpy.  Probaby would not leave any left overs.  The recipe called for 5 cups of vegetable stock, but I only needed about 3 cups.  I had a lot of stock left over, but I guess I could use it for another recipe.

This was wonderful, full of flavor, and I had to make a couple of substitutions based on what I had and didn't have.  I didn't have the parsley, celery, milk or heavy cream.  I sauteed the onions, garlic, and mushrooms (canned) in a little butter and then added a half teaspoon of dried rosemary.  Seasoned with salt and pepper. I then added the rice and 1/3 of a cup of 1/2 and 1/2 (I "thirded" the recipe since it was just for me and my husband).  I then added chicken broth, a half cup at a time.  I used about 2 cups total broth.  I tasted frequently, seasoning with salt and pepper as needed, and it came out creamy, full of flavor and delicious.  I even forgot the butter, just sprinkled with parmesan and fresh ground pepper. Delish!  I will definitely be making this again.  My first time making a risotto and it came out restaurant quality. Thanks for the post!

I made this risotto for my fiance and mother in law and they absolutely loved it! I used brown rice since I tend to be on the healthier side. I also used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock for more flavor. I did not use heavy cream because I didn't have any and I used portobello mushrooms and asparragus (combined at the end, cooked separately.)

This is an awesome recipe.  It very easy and mine turned out delicious.  I ended up using only 3 cups of stock because I covered the pan to help it cook faster. Mine came out creamy but not mushy! I will make this recipe again.

This recipe is fantastic...my guests and I loved the flavor.   I've made it three times now.  The only problem...if it is a problem...is that the texture was gooey.  I made exactly as instructed but thought the texture should be firmer with more separation of the rice.  I used arborio rice.  Does anyone have any suggestions to make this firmer?

My first attempt at risotto and it was perfect, better than my fav restaurants!  Only added 3 cups of broth and took longer than recipe said, but totally worth it!  Used fat free half & half, and only half the amount of grated Parmesan, my attempt to save a few calories.  Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe.

Great recipe!!   I used soy milk instead of milk and cream and it worked great.  Also, the rice I used was basmatti and for me it took only 2 cups of broth to cook the rice.

As a beginner, I was intimidated by risotto. This was my first attemt and it turned out pretty well. I opted not to use the cream, and wound up using 1000mL of stock. It tasted great, until I added the parmesan. I think it's because I bought inexpensive pre-grated parmesan cheese which overwhelmed the dish. I will try again with 1/2 cup of better quality parmesan.

This takes much longer to prepare than mentioned because there are 5 cups of broth that have to be added to the dish, one cup at a time until absorbed.

I wouldn't change the broth amount, though.  The only change I made was to chop up my mushrooms a bit more than just slicing them.  I think I may have added more onions than necessary, but the word "small" is so ambiguous with onion size these days.  The person should give a mention of how many cups of diced onions are needed instead.

Although time consuming, this is pretty good.

nice and creamy, good flavour. I usually add more mushrooma and some peas or asparagus to this. Good way to get some veg into kids.

An excellent, easy-to-make risotto. I only had to use two cans of broth, though (one can = two cups). I'd have to say, add a little more broth after you think the risotto is done -- this makes keeping it for the next day much easier. Otherwise the next day the rice sucks up all the liquid, making the whole thing lumpy and dry. If you add more broth and reheat then, it gets soggy and overcooked. But on the day of, this was delicious!

I forgot to add the butter and cheese but it didn't need it.  This was just fabulous!  We had it as a main course and it was the best dinner I've made in weeks.  I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a warm, comforting dinner.

I love this recipe! So flavorful and delicious. That being said, am I the only one who thinks 3 onions, even small ones, sounds like A LOT of onion for a recipe that is supposed to only serve 4 people? I like onions as much as the next person, but that seems really excessive.  When I make this recipe I switch the onion and garlic quantities; so 3 cloves garlic and one onion. I also replace both the milk and the cream with fat free half and half. The recipe doesn't state what type of rice to use, so I generally use brown.  I have used the generic take-forever-to-cook brown rice and it works fine, but I have found 2 pouches of Trader Joe's frozen brown rice works great and cooks so much faster. Which is great because, well, sometimes a girl is just too hungry to wait!
P.S. It's a good idea to wait until all the vegetable stock is in before you add the salt!

I have made this twice, first time "to the letter," second time with some alterations.  Though as-is it is very good, the second go-round I halved the onions, eliminated the heavy cream and used chicken broth - only because I didn't know I was out of veggie when the process began.  Though not a monumental difference,the 2nd effort was better.  It was a little bit lighter (though no less creamy), the chicken broth added more flavor, and the onions were more on par with my preference. I hate when onion overpowers the dish.  All in all a great recipe and one I shall return to to tweak yet again!

My family agreed they would eat it again. They guess. Success I guess? I added chicken to make it into a main dish.

Made as is.  3 starts due to a divided house on this one.

My husband LOVED it saying it was one of the best things I've made.  

I think it's pretty bland.  However, I enjoy rich food (i.e. Coopers Hawk Winery serves a Short Rib Risotto that is just amazing which is what I was kind of going for with this dish sans short ribs).  My husband does not.  Maybe that is the big difference between those that loves this recipe and those that don't.

I thought this was pretty terrible, actually. The heavy whipping cream made it waaayyyy too rich. Rich and bland... You might ask if that is possible, and I assure you that with this recipe, it is.

Delicious, I hate when people make changes, but you have to improvise at times...so, I only used one onion, chicken broth, no cream-substituted with 2% milk, added about cup and a half of chicken (chopped).  It was amazing!!!!

delicious! We loved this one. We substituted 1% milk for the whole milk and half and half for the heavy cream and it turned out delicious...and a little more healthy!
I would probably only use 2 onions instead of 3 next time too.

I halved this recipe, but left the mushroom quantity as in the original recipe, effectively doubling the mushroom quantity. I also used two types of mushrooms: fresh regular button mushroom and  fresh oyster mushroom (oh, and i threw in some frozen green peas towards the end of cooking for some color).
Other than that I followed the recipe closely and maybe overdid the parmesan cheese a bit in the end, but the recipe turned out wonderfully! I think it's a great basic mushroom risotto that can be augmented easily (for those who like more vegetable, like me!)

This was good, because it used ingredients I had on hand, but it is definitely not risotto. Risotto uses Arborio rice, and the creaminess comes from the starch in the rice, not cream.

I have always wanted to make risotto and am glad I started with this recipe.
I took some previous posters advice and thought 4 servings (which apparently actually feeds 6 or more) would make to much for our family of 4 so I scaled it back to 3 servings and it was perfect for a 13 and 16 year old and 2 parents. I used aborio rice, half & half, skim milk and 1 can of chicken stock and the rest plain water. Although the recipe called for 3/4 cup of parmesan I used 1/4 cup of parmesan and 1/4 cup of romano. 
Mine looks exactly like the risotto you get at a restaurant, not like the soupy consistency in the picture.
The kids said it tasted like 'more'.

This is an amazing risotto! Very creamy and mild flavoured. We slightly modified this recipe by using 3/4 of a red onion (instead of 3 small onions), using 1/4 cup of finely sliced celery (instead of 1tsp), using 2 cups of sliced mushrooms (instead of 1 and 1/2 cups) using 1/2 cup of wine and 1/2 of milk (instead of 1 cup of milk), using dried parsley and 1/3 cup of sliced pecans. 

The only caveat is that this risotto is very soft and mushy. We usually make a risotto that is cooked in less liquid so it has more texture (e.g., almost al dente).

In any case- an excellent recipe, especially with the pecans because it adds texture!

Great recipe! I did make a couple of modifications. I used chicken broth instead of veggie and I didn't think it really needed  5 cups of broth so I used 2-1/2 and 1 cup of white cooking wine. I also skipped the celery and used celery salt instead. Also drizzeled white truffel oil over the top once the dish finished and slightly cooled. Fantastic!

I made this recipe for dinner tonight. It was delicious and very filling however it took longer than  what I expected. Anyway, it was well worth it in the end. I used 1 cup of cream instead of heavy cream & milk.

I have made this recipie twice for guests, and so far it's been a hit both times! I made a few modifications.  I did not have whole milk on hand, so I used 1/2 cup skim milk, and 1/2 cup half and half. The consistency was perfect. I also used a combination of chicken and beef stock instead of veggie stock. Next time I will add more mushrooms.   I left out the celery, as this just didn't sound good to me.  I will definitely make this again! It's one of my favorites!

Flavor was decent, but it had an off-putting oatmeal-like consistency.  As far as risotto goes, this one wasn't worth the time and effort involved.

This was absolutely georgous. I made it for my husband ,children and mum (who is a vegetarian ). We all loved it and agreed it tasted nicer then the risotto at our local italian restaurant. I used slightly more cream and semi skimmed milk and put double the garlic in . A definate favourite. thanks

This was delicious~!  The presentation isn't too apealing, kind of looks like mushroom goo, but the taste was wonderful!  I added a bit more parmesan than what it called for, and I wouldn't do that again, too cheesy.  Definitely double or triple the mushroom called for (they kind of all disappear after a while of simmering).  Totally skip the cream (it is creamy enough with only the milk), and substitute vegetable stock with chicken stock for more flavor.  I also skipped the celery (we're not great fans).  Oh, also, I only needed half the stock that it called for. It was absolutely delicious! Thank you for the recipe!

Realy yummy.  I added chicken as well, as I find the texture can be a little 'gluggy' otherwise.  Also, you will find that a little goes a long way - don't serve very generous portions, or you will be throwing a lot away!

Too creamy and cheesy.  Eliminate the parmesan, replace the cream with milk.
Also, there was too much broth called for.

The rice tasted great, but the recipe used way too much water for the 1 cup of rice it calls for.  We got rice soup!  With some modifications, I would probably make it again.

Made this tonight as a side dish. I did a few alterations though, I learned to sauté the risotto rice before adding any liquids. So after I sautéd the veggie part (which I will use more parsley next time to season), I added the rice and after I "crisped" that for a moment, I added the HOT broth. As many others I did not use any milk to the recipe, but added a tablespoon of heavy cream, although it was quiet creamy already. I also suggest adding a bit of white wine for flavor if available.

I have cooked this a few times and the family love it.  I don't add cream but do add the milk.  Wine is added if available. Different mushrooms and lots of them chopped small with onions work well.

Absolutely delicious though I made the following changes based on other comments: 1 medium onion instead of 3 small, substituted and extra 1/4 cup milk for the heavy cream, 2 cups of veggie broth instead of 5, 3-4 cups mushrooms instead of just 1 1/2 cups, and 1/3 cup parsley instead of a measly teaspoon.

Cooking this right now. A co-worker and I do a food swap every couple weeks. He makes puerto rican and spanish foods and I make him italian. This week was rice so I'm making him this. He has a mushroom allergy so I just replaced them with carrots. Haven't made risotto in years and this recipe was very good! :)

We made the 6 portions recipe, it askes for 7.5 cups of broth, but we only used 5 cups and we think it would've been better with just 4 cups for a more hearty texture. It probably depends on the type of rice used. We used the rice shown in the previous entry

Not a spoonful of this hot number was left! I used Aborio rice and used greater amount of celery and mushrooms to add volume. I don't usually have whole milk so I substitued fat free milk and reduced it by 1/4 cup and increased the heavy cream by 1/4 cup. Next time, I want to experiment with different varieties of mushrooms and some other spices as well.

This is a delicious dish, whether it's authentic or not. I've made this recipe several times - a couple of times exactly as the recipe says and several times with variations, and it's always a hit with my family and company. That's why I like this particular recipe so much, it's easy to play around with if you don't have all the ingredients the recipe calls for - I've made it without the mushrooms, several times by using chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, one time with evaporated milk (yes, don't gasp foodies!), with 2% milk and no cream, many times using only a quarter cup of the Parmesan, and sometimes with no Parmesan cheese at all...and all varieties were very good and received compliments. My husband did say he preferred this dish with less than half of the Parmesan or none at all. I had to agree - using the full cup made it a bit overpowering to our taste. 
I do think works best to prepare it in a heavy-bottomed, good quality skillet, as I noticed that when I used a lightweight skillet it took quite a bit longer for the risotto to cook.

My first attempt at Risotto, I always heard it was hard.  I too only used fat free milk and no cream and it was plenty creamy enough. I forgot fresh parsley and used dry and it was fine.  I omitted celery and did not feel it was missing anything the mushroom taste really came through.  I will be adding this to one of my all time favorite sides.  Even my non eating mushroom son thought it was tasty.

I so enjoy risotto rice, and you must use the arborio rice to give it a good flavor. I wonder why though why people change the reciepe? It's great just the way it is. this is a great recipe and does not need to be changed.

This recipe is magnificent! tasted  it the whole way through, the flavors were perfect, the missing star is because the Parmesan at the end kind of ruined the flavor, deadened it if you will. Next time I will leave off the cheese, it is unnecessary!

The taste is all there, and I like that it starts with milk because it seems creamier than most risotto recipes I have used.  I am giving it 4 stars out of 5 because it calls for about a cup more liquid than it needs.  Not perfect but very tasty.

Perfetto! Insanely incredible recipe for all 4* palates. I made it with Cordon Bleu II. I highly recommend mellow side dishes to counter the bold and powerful tastes of such creamy, buttery, and rich dishes like the Bleu. Simple broccoli, asparagus, or peas are a great idea.

This was incredible!

SERIOUSLY AMAZING!  I am not exaggerating when I say that this risotto is the best thing I have ever made!  I admit I left out the celery and parsley, and used chicken stock because I prefer the richer flavor.  I will make this again and again!  In fact, it's going to be my fancy Christmas Eve dinner!!

I had never made or even eaten Risotto prior making this. I had only seen it on the cooking shows and so wanted to try it! I am so very glad I found this recipe as it was super easy to make. It tasted like I pretty much thought it would but even better!!!  My family loves this and has asked that I make it again. This time I am using 3 different types of mushrooms just for the fun of it!! I thank you for this recipe as does my family!!!! YUMMMM

Very delicious. I used parmesan raggiano and it make a lot of difference than regular kraft grated parmesan. I used chicken broth instead of vege and used portabella mushrooms.

Good recipe but made a few changes...Used almond milk instead of whole milk and to add some creamy texture, added a tbl of cream cheese at the end along with the parmesan.  Cream cheese really added a nice creamy texture.  Also added morel mushrooms, which brought stronger mushroom flavor.  Lastly, didn't have arborio so used basmati...I know, I know, but I was lazy and didn't want to go to the store.  Not ideal rice choice, but really didn't impact the end result much at all.

Delicious risotto.  I sauteed the arborio rice for a minute or so, since I always do before adding liquid.  Then I deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup white wine.  Also, I fried about an ounce of salt pork with the onions at the beginning, and left out the celery.  I really think these were minor changes, and didn't change the recipe all that much.  My whole family loved it.

I LOVE everything with mushroom so i made this recipe and everything went well .. except that the available vegetable stock we have in our markets is very salty which led to have salty risotto, but I can tell you this recipe is very tasty and have a nice texture.

I followed other reviews and didn't use cream.  I did use whole milk, but next time (and there will definitely be a next time!!) I'll just use whatever milk we have on hand, which is usually 1%.  I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and only needed a little less than 4 cups.

Great!  
I added some chives for flavor, tripled (at least) the parsley, omitted the celery, switched the whole milk for 1%, and omitted the heavy cream to save calories.  If you like spice you should add a bit more to give this some extra zest, but a really great recipe!

This was an excellent recipe, however I made a few changes. instead of cream, I used skim milk (2 cups) and instead of vegetable stock, I used 1 cup of my favourite white wine. turned out awesome!

Better than Bouillon makes a mushroom stock concentrate that works wonderfully here. I make it the broth with half mushroom, half chicken stock.

YUMMMY!  I added spinach to the mushrooms and cooked up some chicken breast in garlic and added that in when it was all done and BOY it was AMAZING!  Super delicious!  Really not hard to make either just took a little time.  Definitely worth it!

Amazing.  Simply awesome.  I omitted the celery and added 2 tbsp of chopped fresh rosemary to the dish.  I sliced some grilled chicken breast and placed it on top of the risotto (for my non-vegetarian guests).  Serve with a fresh salad.  And, of course, as everyone else has mentioned, be sure to use Arborio rice.  Look for it in the bulk foods section for the best deal.  A tip: As this is risotto, you do have to spend the entire time stirring it, or it will burn to the pan.  However, if you want a little security, you can make it in a heavy nonstick pan.  That way, even if it sticks a little, it comes off quickly and you're fine.

My husband and I both loved this.  I tasted it before adding the parmesan and it was delicious that way as well. We used just plain white mushrooms.  I also used 1% and Half and Half instead of whole milk and heavy cream because it was what I had on hand and it still turned out rich and creamy.  I really only needed about 4 cups of vegetable broth.  I will definitely make this again.

This is the most fantastic tasting risotto hands down. With that being said I gave this a 4 star rating because the directions are not clear. The parsley and mushrooms, imo, should not be added until the end of the cooking time. The parsley takes on a yuck color with cooking that long. I didn't want my mushrooms overcooked so I added them with the last addition of broth and I did indeed use all 5 cups. Don't skip out on the veggie broth as it adds a wonderful flavor to this dish. The heavy creme and milk also play an important roll into how decadent this dish turns out. I didn't add all the parm only 1/4 cup as we LOVED the flavor the the shrooms and broth added to the arborio. Oh and yes you must use an arborio rice for this to be as creamy and delish as it should be. I will be using this one again with the changes that I made, however, I don't think this is a recipe for the "first time" risotto maker as the directions lack a bit.

This recipe was fantastic.  I hosted a dinner party and served this with roasted cornish hen and asparagus.  It was a hit!!!  I was a little concerned about the cream and milk as I could find no other risotto recipe that included milk and cream, but it turned out great.  Next time I would exclude the celery, as I did not like the taste.

My husband and I prepared this risotto.  It was extremely good! It did take quite a while to cook however.  
We substituted chicken stock for vegetable stock and only needed 3.5 cups.  Also, we only used half the cheese as we felt a full cup would be overkill.  Next time I will add more mushrooms.  Overall, it was great

I made this for the second time last night and must say it is an awesome recipe!  Only change I made was I used 1 1/4 cups of fat free half & half instead of the heavy cream and whole milk and a mixture of parmesan and romano cheese.  The hardest part about his recipe is to just be patient when adding the broth.

Good - my toddler loved it! I Did not use the celery, and I eliminated the amount of milk to 3/4c. and did not use the cream.  I also carmalized the onion and added fresh basil.

I changed the recipe amounts to 6 servings. I sauteed about 4 cups of a combination of sliced white button and crimini mushrooms in olive oil, garlic and seasoning salt.  I added 2% milk with a little heavy cream, along with arborio rice and let the milk reduce quite a bit before I began stirring in hot vegetable broth.  I only ended up needing 4-5 cups of broth.  I used about half a cup of freshly grated parmigiano reggiano.  The result had a nice earthy mushroom flavor and a very rich and creamy comfort food texture.  I served it with Aidells roasted garlic and gruyere cheese chicken sausages.  We enjoyed it!

Very, very happy with this recipe!!  I did substitute  half & half for the cream as other reviewers suggested and I left out the fresh parsley (only because I forgot to purchase it). 
I will definitely be making this again.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

This wasn't that great.  The Parmesan cheese was overwhelming.  That was all we could taste, and it was just too much.  The only change I made was to use chicken stock instead of vegetable stock, otherwise I followed the recipe.  It took around 1 hour to incorporate all of the stock into the risotto.  This was a big disappointment for the time-commitment I put into this dish.  Also, it makes a lot.  You could easily serve 6-8 people with this dish.  If you are going to give this a try, I highly recommend reducing the Parmesan cheese.

Although I've tried many great ones, this is the first recipe to inspire a review. This was very time consuming but well worth it! I made it in a saucepan instead of a skillet and it took about 50 min. I omitted the parsley and celery because I didn't have any; and used 2 cans chicken broth and a 8 oz. package of mushrooms. Also, I used half the amount of parmesan. It was perfect!! I served it with a jaeger schnitzel and my husband raved. I will make this again and again!!!

Delicious!  Makes a bit more than 4 servings though.  I think skim milk and half and half would probably be good in lieu of whole and cream.  We used 2% and it was still quite rich.  Definitely a keeper though!

This was my first time making or eating risotto, and after spending all that time on a side dish, I was sure I wouldn't even want to eat it by the time I was done...I was wrong.  It is wonderful!  I actually thought it was just as good, if not better, without the parmesan, which coming from a cheese lover like me, is saying a lot.  I did make some substitutions, only because I wanted to use what I had on hand, which were 3c (as suggested in reviews) roasted garlic chicken stock instead of the veggie, and I left out the parsley and celery, as some previous reviewers suggested, and I also didn't have the full amount of parmesan, it was about 1/2 - 2/3 cup.  Anyway, so glad I didn't have to run to the store in this awful weather and it still turned out delicious. Will make again!

I made this for New Years Eve dinner along with a simple asparagus recipe with olive oil and sesame seeds.  I made some changes as suggested by others on this site... I used 1% milk and about 1/4 cup half and half as I didn't have any cream.  I ended up using 4 cups of broth as I was too impatient to do the full 5!  It was excellent... my boyfriend was impressed!  And wonderful leftovers which is always a bonus :)

This was very delicious.  I used wild mushrooms for some extra flavor, and a combination of Asiago and Parmesean.   Made it twice in two weeks.

This was my first attempt at making risotto and turned out fabulously.  Instead of the milk and heavy cream, I substituted 1 1/4c of skim milk and it was still delicious.  Yes, it took a lot of patience and I probably won't make it often, but still a very good recipe.

We love this recipe, it is absolutely delicious. I've never needed the 5 cups of broth about 3 cups is enough. But I follow the rest of the recipe to the letter and it's always a hit with dinner guests.

I used fat free milk and only 4 cups of chicken broth. It came out so creamy and delicious, this recipe became an instant favorite! Also, I only added a little bit of cheese on the top, it was already creamy enough without an entire cup.

I made this recipe exact the first time and it was great.  I started experimenting with it:  I replaced the vegetable stock with an even mix of chicken and beef broth , doubled the mushrooms, and added slightly cooked shrimp.  The dish becomes a meal.

Excellent recipe.  Turns out perfect, nice and creamy as risotto should be.  Great side dish to serve with beef, chicken, or seafood.  I will make this one again.

I gave this recipe 3 stars since you really need to add so much more to make it taste good. I added white wine after sauteing the onions and veggies. Extra garlic and saffron was added too. Next time I make this recipe, I will skip the milk and cream. It make the rice too cream of mushroom soup tasting. It was hard to taste the other flavors. A decent recipe if you omit the milk and cream and stick to the wine and broth to make the rice creamy.

Delicious!  I used oyster mushrooms and added peas... I love this.  Didn't want to stop eating it.  I used arborio rice, I don't know if that's why I needed less broth - only one can of veg broth and it was perfect!  Thank you!

Ohhhhh, so good!!  I made this recipe for a Valentine's dinner, and I am in love with this risotto!  I didn't change anything about the recipe, and it came out perfect.  My advice to anyone having trouble with this recipe is to read the general risotto cooking tips provided on this site.  They are very helpful.

This dish was pretty good...but since I am a vegan, I subsituted the milk with plain soy milk. I omitted the half-and half, and used vegan margarine in place of the butter that was called for. My 4 year old daughter was not too crazy about this dish though. However, it was pretty tasty, overall.

This turned out phenomenal!! I used just regular sticky rice No Celery No parsley just mushrooms onion and garlic. I used chicken stock 1 box was enough and probably used about 3 cups of rice. If you notice it’s super souppy add more rice I also just used regular shredded Parmesan cheese. I will be making this again !!!

First time making Risotto ever. I was a little confused about the broth but after reading the reviews I knew to wait longer between adding the broth a cup at a time and adjusted my temperature a little. I added more mushrooms, carrots and asparagus (at the end, I covered it and added the carrots and asparagus). Turned out amazing! only used 3 cups broth and stirred stirred stirred. I will make again. I will add a few more spices to our taste, leave out the celery (didn't need it I thought) but easy peasy and loved it! Didn't have the parm, only had 2% milk but did have heavy cream, but it was still creamy and rich.

It was wonderful.
If you double the amount, it takes twice the amount of time. I thought more rice would absorb more water in the same amount of time.
I absolutely adored this recipe.
I've made it multiple times and it's one of my go to carb based dishes.

This was excellent. I used crimini mushrooms and added a half pound of chicken. We felt it could use additional mushrooms. Next time I may try to combine the crimini  and button mushrooms.

I had never made risotto before, I should have read reviews first I think 5 cups of broth is too much however after reading reviews you stop when rice is done. Looks like 2 to 3 cups is all you need. Mine turned out a little mushy however it still was delicious it got all eaten up

This is my go-to website for anything I want to cook. They’ve never steered me wrong.

And now they have done even better. This is my favorite recipe that I have come across so far. It’s delicious!

I  did use 2% milk instead of whole milk, though.

I will be making this often

If you've never made risotto before, this is probably not the best recipe to start with. But if you're familiar with the mechanics of making risotto (Arborio rice, hot stock, constant stirring, etc.), it's not bad. I liked this much more than my hubby did, and there are other risotto recipes on this site that we've both liked, so I probably won't make this one again.

This recipe is the good - with a few modifications. The one instruction that cracks me up is "Saute the onion and garlic in the olive oil until onion is tender and garlic is lightly browned. Remove garlic, and stir... " Remove the garlic? Really. I don't do that. 

My modifications are:
- Don't remove the garlic
- 1.5 cups of rice
- Double the mushrooms
-  3 cups of stock. I prefer chicken stock
- NO celery... it dominates too much
- After the rice has cooked down to about 90% of desired amount I top with parmesan and stick in the oven at 350 for 10 minutes.

I wound up making a lot of changes.  I added wine (1c, before any other liquid) and I feel like if I hadn't, this recipe would have been kind of bland.  The milk and cream weren't readily absorbed by the rice, which made this dish pretty soupy.  The recipe also calls for a lot more broth than I needed, but that's kind of subjective so better safe than sorry.  

All in all, I'm probably always going to like a dish that has mushrooms in, but this could have been stronger.

I made the for the 1st time tonight. It was delicious and the hubby loved it!. I added an extra clove of garlic and used chicken broth as I didn't have vegetable broth. I followed the directions using one cup of broth at a time. I only used 4 cups instead of the 5 in the recipe as I was afraid it wouldn't all absorb. I will make this again as a main dish. I know what I will be having for lunch tomorrow! Simple ingredients for a fabulous flavor.

It was good, but as with any risotto, my shoulder hurts from constantly stirring for 30 minutes. Rice is somewhat gummy in texture. I don't know if that means I over cooked it. My fear was that I would have hard partially cooked pieces, and that is not the case. I doubt that I will fix it again due to the intensity of labor. But I am glad I tried it!

Made it exactly as directed. It was delicious and everyone at the dinner party enjoyed it. I've made it twice now and anticipate making it in the future. A good neutral dish for any potluck also!

I read several comments about changes people had made. The only change I made was the type of rice I used- Arborio. It was creamy and delicious. It was THE hit of Easter dinner!

I think this is beyond delicious.  I used regular long grain rice and left out the celery and pepper since I don't like those things.  I ended up using 6 cups of broth and it took 2 hours and 15 minutes.

The majority of the ingredients are good (like the mushrooms and celery, onions, etc) but why would you remove the garlic?  Just mince it and cook it with the onions.  Risotto (made with Arborio rice) by sheer definition is creamy; it doesn't need milk or cream to make it great.  I used unsalted chicken broth (preference).  I also added the parsley at the end with the butter so it kept it's colour and used about 1/4 cup of parsley rather than a teaspoon.  With these modifications, it was SUPER tasty!

I just made this recipe for the first time. the difference that i did was i used 1.5 cups of rice. italian cheese(i put a bit too much cheese on top) and i used only 2 cups of vegetable broth. i also covered the dish to help it thicken. i reccomend using 2% milk and half n half creamer like some people suggested this is thick n creamy and loaded with calories. i used minced garlic instead of cloves, diced onions, and i left our parsley and celery (because i dont like either) it serves a lot!

Nice flavor. I too omitted celery because I had none, but added celery seed and rosemary. Not sure why folks struggled with Time required for cooking. Used basmati rice and done in an hour, including prep. Tyvm!!

Have made this several times. Thank you for reviewers calling to use Arborio rice.  I didn't use cream and it turned out great.  Very hearty dish to be enjoyed on its own, with salad and cheese, or as a side.

Absolutely delicious. I used regular rice. I made 2 cups of rice. I omitted the celery and used 2 cups of half and half and 1/2 cup of slim milk and used chicken broth instead of begetable and used only one cup of parmesean cheese and omitted the butter. Wow. It was amazing   Restauran quality. I will definitely make it again and again.

This was a BIG hit with my family. Instead of the milk & cream combo I used fat free half & half. I went by something I saw on Martha Stewart a few years ago and sauteed the arborio rice first, then started adding the broth a little at a time while continuously stirring. I added the half & half towards the end. Served it with fontina cheese and a few roasted red pepper slices on top.

Easy and so good. I used Chicken broth, half and half (didn't have heavy cream). I also didn't have Parmesan anymore, so i used a mix of kraft dinner cheese. Sound silly, but it was Terrific:-).

I made this recipe to the exact detail and I loved it but it was so rich I could only eat a little at a time. I would recommend using half and half instead of heay cream and 2% or even skim milk for the whole milk. I also used 1/2 parm and 1/2 romano cheese and it was delicious.

Kept the same basics but as follows : no garlic, 1/2 teaspoon of celery seeds and parsley added fresh at the end.The mushrooms I used were dry sliced Asian ones I had re-hydrated in hot water for 1 night and they cooked with the rice. Also I used broth and no milk, only a little bit of cream at the end. Very good risotto but I would recommand to be light on the Parmesan cheese who can be overpowering.

Yum!! Arborio rice, melted butter instead of olive oil, didn't have garlic or parsley or celery (hate celery), used skim milk and no cream! Also used a mixture of vegetable broth and chicken broth. Loved!

Made this for romantic Valentine's dinner. It was my first time making risotto and it was absolutely superb. Used skim milk and 5%, instead of the higher fat options above. Turned out perfect!  My boyfriend loved it. Keeping this in my arsenal as a sure ire showstopper when I entertain.  Try it, you will not regret it.  I used some oyster mushrooms along with plain white sliced ones I had in the fridge.  I now understand that with risotto, you really have to " keep your eye on it and keep stirring", for the duration of cooking.  
Coupled it with halibut steaks and sautéed kale and grilled peppers.    Thank you for this delicious recipe.

Took alot longer to get rice to cook, would definately recommend covering during the cooking process.  Did not have the taste that I was expecting, did not have the rich creaminess that you'd expect with a risotto.  Not worth the time it took to cook.

My favorite risotto recipe. I’ve left the celery out before and subbed chicken broth, and it turned out great. I add minced garlic from the jar, so I don’t remove the garlic per the directions. It’s good to toast the risotto in the pan a little before adding the liquid, and use the widest pan you have (I use a paella pan).

Very tasty...and deliciously creamy.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable stock, and minced garlic in place of whole.  I think I could have got by with less milk or cream, so I will perhaps try that next time.  Overall, a nice tasting side dish served with yummy steak today!

Strongly recommend dropping the celery and doing a shallot instead of onion. I also do not add the mushrooms until there is only a few ladles of broth left.

NOTE: This was my first risotto, so maybe my rating should be dismissed. :-)
I felt this was kind of a lot of work for an "okay" dish. I really like mushrooms, but I was disappointed in the flavor. Also, it made a TON--we were eating it for days!

Authentic or not, this was amazing.  I did add some mushroom flour from morells we picked (maybe a T or so) and also a dash of nutmeg.  I only needed about 4 C of broth for a double recipe.

This was the best risotto that I'v ever made.  I used shitake mushrooms that I had bought at the local farmers market.  To cut a few calories and fat, I used fat free evaporated milk instead of cream and 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.  Added some of the left over evaporated milk when heating up the left over risotto.

This is an excellent start for making your own risotto. Like others, I tweaked it for my own tastes. I left out the parsley and celery, and instead of using milk and cream, I simply used whole milk. I also don't like mushrooms, so instead I added cooked orange or red bell peppers for a pop of color.

Smelled really great while I was making it -- BUT I think it had way too much parmesan cheese in it, and I only used 3 cups of chicken broth (5 seemed a bit excessive). I would put a whole stalk of celery in it next time, I added some oregano, and would cut the parm cheese at least in half to make this more tolerable. With a few changes, recipe could be great, but as is seems to just be missing something. Also makes way too much for 4 servings - I would cut the recipe in half for 4 people :)

I loved this recipe!  I brought it to a recent dinner party and it was a huge hit.  One of the hosts had never enjoyed mushrooms before, but ended up eating a huge helping and even finished off the rest for breakfast the next morning.  This is a recipe that takes some serious patience. I did change a few things, such as using chicken broth instead of vegetable.  I did not use any celery, as other cooks suggested, and I used the arborio rice.  I did use extra mushrooms, and I feel that it could even have used more.  I used half of one large onion in place of three small onions.  As others have already stated, the part where you add the stock is deceptive in the recipe.  You want to add one cup at a time, then wait until all of the stock is absorbed into the rice before pouring in the next cup.  I did use all five cups. This was a real pleaser and will make it again!

Fantastic! Really delicious - even my sister, who hates mushrooms AND risotto, really loves this when I make it. I put in more mushrooms than the recipe calls for, as I love them, and substitute fresh, chopped chives for the parsely. I also find that it doesn't need half as much stock as the recipe suggests, but perhaps I am doing something wrong. This has become one of my my favourite recipes - to cook and to eat!

Fantastic recipe! The only modification I make is to add 1 cup of white wine (to deglaze the sauteed garlic and onion from the bottom of the pan).  My family and friends love it!!!

YUM YUM YUM!!!  This was soooo good!  I made this for a potluck for friends and they kept going back for second and thirds and then fourths.. :)  I didn't have celery (and didn't want to go to the store) so I used celery salt and omitted the extra salt.  I also used chicken stock and 2 cups mushrooms (we love mushrooms and my husband has a bad habit of eating half the food as I'm making it so I figured if I started with 2 cups I'd end up with 1 & 1/2).  But that was it.  This is a fabulous recipe that I will be making again and again and again!!  And like the other reviewers said, start tasting after the 2nd or 3rd cup of stock to see if the consistency is right.  I ended up using only the milk, cream and 3 cups stock.  DELISH!

This was a great Risotto dish.  I followed the recipe exactly and found it on the overly rich side.  I would make it again, but maybe replace heavy whipping cream with whole milk.  My husband loved it and thought it was restaurant quality.

This was my first risotto, and I think it came out great, it took forever, but I think it was worth it. Following the tips from others and a touch more seasoning it was great. What I did different was I didn't use the celery, heavy cream, and substituted chicken broth for the vegtable broth. Also I used the Arborio rice, and I added 1 teaspoon of fresh oregeno

Not bad, but you dont need the milk, just a little cream at the end is nice but actually you dont even need that. I use real "arborio" rice. I taste as I go to get the right texture and not overcook. Every grain of rice should have a little texture not all soft. The creamieness of the dish will come from the starch in the rice being released as it cooks. I reduce the parmesan to 1/3 to 1/2 cup and use only fresh grated not store bought grated. It will adds too much salt and is usually 40% cellulose not just cheese.

This recipe is definately a keeper.  I have to agree with some that the directions in the recipe could be a bit more specific.  You should use Arborio rice and that isn't mentioned in the directions.  "3 small onions"???, I used quite a few green onions, and "1 1/2 cup sliced mushrooms"??? I used white mushrooms.  I also used 1/2% milk and half and half, only 4 cups of chicken stock, and only 1/4 cup of parmesan, as the rice already tasted fantastic before adding the cheese, and I felt that 1 cup of cheese would have been overkill.    The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is the previously mentioned lack of a bit more details in the recipe.  The result should get 10 stars, and now that I've made this recipe, I realize that it is open to many various variations.  Definately a keeper

Delicious recipe! We ate this by itself for dinner one night; very good for when it is cold and snowy outside! We used cream instead of whole milk altogether, and it turned out wonderful. Added a little too much stock so it took quite a long time to cook. Will definitely make again - this again is a great winter evening meal, as well as a great side dish for company.

Yum! I made this tonight and it was fabulous. I used regular long grain rice, and a little less than 4 cups of broth. It was really creamy, flavorful and my husband told me to save it in my recipe box! lol

this was really great! I used the 1 1/4 cups of half & half like others had suggested, and not the full amount of cheese since it already seemed pretty intense & creamy with all that dairy! I waited to put the parsley in like someone else had suggested to keep the nice green color of the leaves. It came out great! Everyone raved about it!

I would give this 10 stars if I could. I followed the recipe exactly. The greatest compliment I can get is when my husband takes a bite and says "This is really good".  He did just that with this recipe.  I will make this over and over.

I have to say this is by far the best recipe I have ever made off this site. I have never eaten risotto before, but o'my this is wonderful. I would give it 10 stars if I could. I used chicken broth instead of veggie(all I had on hand). I didn't use the celery, instead I added about 1/4 of a teaspoon of dried rosemary and I also used dried parsely(forgot to buy fresh). This is pure comfort food at it's finest. Thank you for a recipe that I will enjoy for many years!!

I'm giving it 4 stars b/c my family loved it - it was more of a 3 star dish for me. I left out the celery and substituted chicken broth for vegetable, but otherwise followed the recipe, and it was just very watery although I let the liquid absorb for a very long time! It was also a little too rich for my taste.

An excellent recipe.  Took out the celery (i don't like my risotto to taste like stuffing), used 4 cups chicken stock and 1 cup water, and added 1/4 parmesan cheese instead of a full cup.  I also used baby bella mushrooms because I enjoy a more "meaty" mushroom.  It came out beautifully.  Used most of the liquid--made sure to let most of the liquid evaporate before adding more.  Stir occasionally to make sure it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.

Great dish! I substituted the cream with half and half and the milk with Silk soy milk for a healthier alternative, and it tasted amazing.  I also chopped half of the mushrooms finely and only halved the other half.

This is an outstanding recipe.  My picky son who says he hates mushrooms loves this risotto.  I use shallots instead of garlic because garlic doesn't agree with me.  My bf can't stop eating it when I make it.  It is worth the effort.

A very tasty dish! I decided to add a little red pepper for a spicier flavor and also little basil and oregano for a taste of Italy. My husband and I both loved it. Oh, and I didn't have vegetable broth,so I used water instead, and it was delicious. Just wrote it down in my recipe book :)

Excellent dish.  I followed the recommendation of other users and used skim milk instead of whole, and half-and-half instead of cream.  It was still perfect.  I used quite a bit of pepper to give it some additional flavor.  My fiance loved it too!

my dinner guest and family really enjoyed this dish. i used arborio rice per other reviews. i forgot to get whipping cream or half and half (whatev you use, personal pref) and i was using skim milk, so i added another 1/2 cup. I didnt have celery on hand so i used celery salt instead, 2 cans of chicken broth, and a tbls or so of more milk by accident. :D but all in all, tasty for sure. just a fancy rice with mushroom. i recommend making big slices of mushroom incase you have picky eaters, so its easy to pick out.

This was our first time making risotto, the recipe seemed pretty easy, and it recieved great reviews.  It would have been good, but called for way too much parmesan.  The cheese was over powering.  Will make this again, but with just a few tablespoons of the parm.  And I agree with another, it makes a lot!

Wow! Whether you use plain, arborio or wild rice, all variations yield the same excellent results. I've also tried omitting the cream, just fine; omitting the butter, also just fine. My husband also likes it with some chunks of chicken breast thrown in for a quick work lunch. Add it when you add the parmesan and the heat will cook it through no problem. Thanks Sarah!!!

This was the first time I cooked risotto and I found the recipe easy to follow and the risotto was delicious and defiantly on my must cook again list. I made a few changes, I used a mixture of chicken and beef stock as suggested by some other reviews as I didn’t have any vegetable stock and while this did taste okay it tasted to “beefy” so next time I will use the vegetable stock as recommended and only 3 cups of stock was required. I left out the minced celery because I don’t like celery and other reviews suggested this gave a strange taste to the risotto. I think I would add some asparagus and chicken also next time as when served up the risotto only produced enough for 3 servings so just enough for me and my partner and will also use skim milk and low fat cream as we are health conscious. Even with out these changes the risotto was still great. A lot better than many I’ve tasted before.

This risotto is very good.  My boyfriend is giving it 4 out of 5 stars because he 'hasn't tasted a 5-star risotto yet', but he said he'd have it again.

I omitted the parsley, and parmesan cheese (I forgot), but the rest of the recipe was as written.  It was very good!  We had company over, and I didn't feel like I served sub-standard food.  They all enjoyed it, and the pot of rice was basically gone.

Absolutely divine! We loved this. The kids wouldn't touch it but that just left more for us. Followed the recipe to the letter.

I thought this was really good! My husband felt it was missing something. The only change I made was I used Chix stock instead of vegetable. I'll make it again, but follow the recipe exactly!

Excellent!  As a mid-westerner, risotto is not a common menu item in our small-town restaurants, so I don't have any professional risotto to compare it to.  But my husband and I both liked it.  I can't eat rice normally, but with all the broth added, it was a wonderful addition to my collection.  The only change I made was to add garlic and onion powder, since I didn't have an onion, and I love those to in almost anything.

Fantastic recipe! Was a big hit with me and my boyfriend. Second time round, we tried it with oriental mushrooms, and that was most yummy too :)

I have made this several times.  I replaced the vegetable broth with chicken broth and used about half a cup to a cup of cilantro instead of parsley.  It made it more fragrant.  Very delicious.

This was pretty good.  If I make it again, I will saute the mushrooms alone, keep them out of the rice for at least the first 3 liquid additions. The recipe as-is tasted too much like canned cream of mushroom soup. I did get all 5 cups of broth in without any problem (I used chicken broth).  I just had to stand and stir a lot longer than I expected.

I liked this recipe a lot, but like all risotto
recipes I've seen it called for way too much 
liquid. I used 2 cups of risotto and needed maybe
4 cups liquid all together. I used chicken broth
instead of vegtable broth because I added grilled
chicken to the risotto at then end.

Loved this recipe!  Only the 2nd time I've tried to make risotto and very happy with the results (as were my friends).  I substituted chicken broth and added more mushrooms than called for.  Didn't have a problem with the amount of broth listed, but it did take a little longer to cook than I expected.  I would definitely recommend this.
