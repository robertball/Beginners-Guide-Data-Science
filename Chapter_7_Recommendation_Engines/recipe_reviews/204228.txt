These were quite delicious, but also a bit of work. While you can buy prepared cups, these have a unique, crunchy, chewy texture and rich bread flavor. My guests really loved the mushroom ones - I also made some and kept them cold - and filled them with a little spring lettuce and chicken, grape, pecan curry salad - Both were good leftover for a few days! I made the cups ahead of time, filled the mushroom ones the day before I baked them, and filled the cold ones a few hours before the party.
