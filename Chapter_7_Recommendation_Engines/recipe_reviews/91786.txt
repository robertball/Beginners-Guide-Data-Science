I made these for Christmas dinner as an alternative to the heavy Christmas pudding. Everyone had one. Could not get frozen raspberries in syrup, so added some redcurrant jelly to sweeten. They were so good. I topped with a dollop of cream, fresh raspberries and a mint leaf.

Also could not find raspberries in sauce but made as written with plain frozen raspberries. Made my own cool whip using heavy whipping cream and my kitchenaid. Served on the side of chocolate creme brulee and it was a fantastic pairing!
