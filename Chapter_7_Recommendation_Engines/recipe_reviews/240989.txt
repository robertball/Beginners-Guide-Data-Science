A quick and tasty hummus! Not made like a traditional hummus (which usually has ingredients such as olive oil, lemon, tahini), but that makes this hummus low fat and low calorie! Bonus!   I loved the addition of sun-dried tomatoes.  I started out with 1 serrano pepper, and while I definitely could handle 2 (I love spicy foods), I think 1 is just perfect for me. For my tastes, I think 1/4 cup of garlic is way too much. Thankfully, I started with a little less than 1/8 cup and that was about at my garlic tolerance.  Next time I might just use 2-3 cloves. I did add a bit of salt to really bring out the flavors. Thanks Brannon for sharing your recipe!

Good, simple and healthy blender version without special shopping - e.g. for tahini. The SD tomatoes are a nice twist, and  I'd note my favorite store brand has some other "non-classic" varieties like roasted pepper, roasted onion, eggplant and olive, seven pepper, and garden veg for different slants to try on this platform.

This time around I added a half a teaspoon of salt and another helping of cumin and it is even better than the first time, I would say a bit richer.

I added bell peppers instead of Serrano peppers and I had to add some milk so that it would actually mix together but overall this is a good recipe
