Came out perfect the first time. Soft and gooey while still warm, then deliciously chewy the next day. I didn't have self-rising flour so I added baking powder and salt (the standard cheat). Excellent recipe; will definitely make again SOON!

I don't know if I did something wrong, I followed everything word for word??? They tasted good but 
I had to use 1/4 cup more of butter because the batter was so dry. The batter is not spreadable so be prepared to push and mold it into the pan. I would make again just to try to see if I did something wrong.

These are soo good!! Like a butter pecan brownie.  5 stars cause it's so easy to put together and because they are soo good!!  My dough was crumbly too, I just worked it together with my hands and then pressed it into the pan. Awesome Tonya!

In one word: YUM!

These are simply scrumptious.  I followed the recipe as written.  Next time I think I will use a baking sheet to achieve slightly thinner bars.  Tastes like the perfect combination of pecan pie and a blondie (vanilla brownie).

I made these yesterday and my husband took them to work this morning. He has already called me to say that 2 people at his work wanted to know how much I would charge them to make them some? They where simple to make and oh so good. It reminded me of a chewie cookie thingie my grand mother use to make.
A keeper for sure and with pecan season just a couple months away, I'm sure I will be making many more batches. Thanks for sharing the recipe with us.

This turned out horrible, but I gave it 3 stars since I might have been responsible for that!
I used all-purpose flour instead of the required self-rising flour...I don't know if this was responsible, but the top and sides were baked beautifully, but the inside was gooey and uncooked.
The batter tasted delightful so there's potential...but again it could have been my fault

Excellent recipe!  
The brown sugar/butter mixture seemed thick or dry before I added the eggs, but by the time I added the rest of the ingredients, the batter was perfect. The result is a delicious treat that is somewhere between a blondie and pecan pie.

These were ok but not a favorite for us.  I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan.  They baked up nicely to an average brownie size.  They tasted better warmed up in the microwave for about 15 seconds.

My Granddaughter made these for us.  They were very good but I forgot to tell her one thing.  I had adjusted the servings to 9 and was going to cook it in an 8" x 8".  She followed the instructions, so used the 9" X 13" pan so they are very flat but still very good.   Remember to adjust the pan size if you adjust the number servings.

I made these for a family get together.  The kids & i weren't too crazy about them, but I still gave it 4 stars because of how popular they were with the baby boomers.

I grew up eating these. they're quick'n easy to make. Just right when you need something sweet and you don't want to wait very long.  be carefull if you are making them thin.  if you don't watch it close they will over cook.  we like them on the chewie side and not the crunchy.

These were phenomenal and easy to make! I subbed homemade rising flour using AllRecipe's recipe and used walnuts instead of pecans to cut cost a little. They were great warmed up and topped with vanilla ice cream ??

Definitely delicious! I used 2tbsps extra of butter because the mix was really dry but I think I over warmed the sugar and butter. I didn't even consider working it with my hands, as another reviewer suggested, but it would have worked if I had done that :) Thanks for sharing!

I used the all recipe cheat for the self rising flour and they turned out great!  They stayed soft and chewy until they were gone several days later.  I will be using this recipe again!

I tried these for a pot luck and they were a hit. I may have baked a little too long, but they taste like pecan pie. I added them to my favorites. My husband loves them, I think next time I will bake a few mins less. Thanks for sharing.

nothing special, making it a waste of expensive pecans. might be better with a little amount of chocolate chips. I've never enjoyed blondies, so that could be part of it.

Good and interesting.  Not nearly as sweet as you would think.  More like a tea biscuit almost. My husband loved them. But he had them with coffee for breakfast, not for dessert after dinner.

These are really yummy.  I did not have any of the problems that other reviewers mentioned and  I followed the recipe exactly.  My batter spread very much like brownie batter, and my bars cooked evenly, with no underdone center.   They turned out wonderfully chewy, nutty and flavorful.  I'll make these regularly.

These are basically a pecan blondie. Not exactly what I had anticipated. Not bad, just not a "wow" for me.

WOW! I liked this a lot and told my husband to save room for this and he did not listen , however I convinced him to try and he said "wow you hit this out of theball park. I hope you have a recipe for this, anyone who likes pecans would love this." by the way it was thick but it spread and became wonderfully chewy!!!

Great recipe. Reminds me of something I ate at a family reunion. Used 1 cup of butter. Recipes turns out better when baked on a cookie sheet, baking time will be less.

Easy and delicious! The dough is crumbly, so I used my hands to press it into the pan. As it cooked, the butter and sugar melt into delicious yumminess!

I made it but changed the measurements to make them extra moist.  1.5 to 2 sticks of butter, two cups dark brown sugar, 2 to 2.5 cups of self rising flour, 3 eggs added on by one already beaten and when adding flour at a half a cup at a time folding it into the wet ingredients

I've made this recipe several times.  If the directions are followed exactly and the correct ingredients are used, they will come out just as described.  My batter has never been too dry but it is hard to spread.  I usually spread the batter as best as I can then spray my hands with Pam or Bakers Joy and use them to even it out.  30 minutes, golden brown but a little jiggly on top and it's perfectly done after it sets up for a few hours.

Came out more like a cake. great flavor just not the consistency I was looking for. I will definitely try again maybe try not cooking the butter and sugar mixture as long or not using as much flour.

Yummy! We made an 8 serving size. Added chocolate chips (50% less than pecans). I only had an 8x8 pan so baked an extra 8 minutes (since it was browning at 350 when I checked it). We loved it!

I'm sure I didn't follow each step correctly.  But for the most part it was delicious.  The inside was a lil more gooey than I would've liked but no biggie.  Next time I'll probably use a lil less sugar because it's very sweet.

Absolutely delicious! No changes. Stiff dough and finally mixed last bit of flour in with my hands. Had to bake an extra five minutes. Very rich and a definite make again.

My family loved these (even the nut hating boys.) My batter didn't seem overly thick or dry at all. My only mistake (and it was *my* mistake) was using the a size smaller pan to bake them in. It was all I had on hand so it took slightly longer for mine to cook (and resulted in a harder outside 'crust'.) I will be purchasing the correct size in the near future and will try them again (not that any of these current ones will go to waste) Thanks for the glimpse back into our childhoods, Tonya.

These are fantastic, I made them for my quilting group and had none left.  So easy.  I made them in a 9x13 pan and they came out nice and chewy and rich.  Thanks for a great recipe

These were not bad. They were VERY chewy, though, almost tough. They also weren't as sweet as I expected.

These bars have the perfect balance of salt and sweet. Incredibly easy to prepare. Once taken to a potluck I was asked to share the recipe. Needless to say there is probably another all recipes fan out there now. Thanks for sharing.

My mother and I were doing some baking for a conference this summer and tried this recipe.  It has now become a family favourite.
