I was wanting something different for breakfast. This is a nice change from oatmeal for breakfast.  Very easy to make and delicious!  I  used poppy seeds  instead of chia seeds since that is what I had on hand.

I made this for my nine year old son for breakfast.  He loved it!  A great alternative for breakfast.  Lots of protein.  I plan on trying this with a variety of fruits.
