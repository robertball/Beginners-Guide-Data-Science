This came out really really great!  3 things to note: 1) do NOT overdo the tamarind paste!  I cut the recipe in half, then used a teeny bit more than it called for, and it was too strong at first.  It's mellowed, but just be careful 2) it took 2 1/2 hours for my leg of lamb meat (cut into pieces) to get tender, not 1 1/2!   3) you will need to add salt at the end!  It doesn't call for it, but you do need it!I know that's probably common sense, but just wanted to make a note.  Enjoy!

I added some tomato paste and made this with chicken. It was just as good as chicken madras from an expensive restaurant. We simplified it a bit by adding all the spices at the same time to the chicken as it was cooking... it came out beautifully. It was so good, that we will make it regularly from now on. Thanks so much for this recipe!

This recipe really taste great.  I added 2tbl of tomatoe paste,only used an half cup of coconut milk and 2 cups of water. I also added 1tbl of flour when simmering the sauce as well as salt and pepper to taste.  I used prepard dried curry powder instead of making the curry paste as well maybe about 3tbl of it. 

Even with all of these changes this recipe cooked up very nicely.  I served it over jasmine rice

This was really good.  I used leg of lamb steaks from Trader Joe's and simmered it for about 2.5 hours.   Loved the homemade curry, the dish came out excellent.  Thank you!  Post more of your dishes please.......

I loved this dish. It turned out delicious and better than anything from a restaurant. The spices were perfect and the peppers gave nice heat.

I was a bit intimidated by all the spices, but once you start it is easy to do.  I used a left over lamb shoulder roast.  could not find dried red peppers, so I tried substituting 1/2t of powder.  sauce was slightly sweet with a little warmth.  Good recipe, but hasn't replaced my favorite take-away.  will try the recipe again.

Oh. My. GOODNESS!! This made my house smell like heaven, and was absolutely delicious! As per other reviews, I went easy on gthe tamarind, and since the instructions don't say when to add the curry leaves, I added them with the cardamom and fennel.

Funny thing about the curry leaves. HAving never made curry before, I went to an Indian grocery store and asked if they had them. "Yes." he said, and went back to his bookkeeping. "Um where are they?" "In my store." I tried not to laugh. I had no idea where to look. Smart aleck. Finally asking if he could be a bit more specific, he sent someone to show us where they were.  (In the refrigerated sectio, for those of you that don't frequent Indian grocery stroes)

Served  this over basmati rice with premade naan, mint chutney, and plain yogurt. I would have made mango salad if they were in season, but cucumber salad would have been good too.

YUM!

This was really great. It wasn't as much preparation/work as i anticipated. used beef instead of lamb and cooked it in the pressure cooker for half the time, and without the lid for half the time and it cooked much quicker. I used half coconut milk and half normal milk to make it 'lighter' and less oil and it was still very very yummy! My mum said it was like the Indian restaurant we had tried a few weeks ago. Oh and make sure to add quite a bit of salt, use some tomato paste (as a previous cook person said) and i left out the cardomoms and it was still good.

First time with curry, and it came out perfect! I substituted chicken, and added a few chopped potatoes, was delicious. Also, didn't have the whole dried chiles, so used about 2 Tbs. of chili powder- just the right amount of heat.

This is my favorite recipe I've come across on allrecipes.com and the only authentic Indian recipe I've found here as well. Most others call for 'curry powder', always a bad sign. I made this as part of an Indian feast (something like ten different dishes) and this one was by far the winner. Why haven't more people tried this one out??

I love this recipe!  I have made it several times myself and last night made it for dinner guests who loved it as well.  I do make some modifications- I add tomatoes to my curry paste and blend that all together- I use fresh ginger and fresh garlic- not pastes and add that to the curry paste as well and puree well.  I use coconut oil as we cannot tolerate ghee and I use this with beef, chicken, lentils or lamb- depending on what I have on hand.

Never made Indian Curry before but this came out very nice. Surley I will make this again. Had a little too much of something (to my taste) and I believe it was the Tamarind Paste even I had only a little teaspoon for 8 servings.

It is not as difficult as it looks.  Gathering all the ingredients was harder for me than the actually cooking but give yourself plenty of time if preparing it for company.  It is an outstanding dish and I got rave reviews at the cooking club party.  I made a double batch and placed the family stash in the freezer.  The only thing that I did not use was the curry leaves.  I had them but forgot to add.  There is so much flavor in this dish I am not sure if it could of enhanced it in anyway.  Enjoy!

This is really good, even if you don't let the flavors sit for a day or two in the fridge! I had leftovers two days later and they were awesome. But it is still really good right after cooking. There were a couple of things I didn't have - ghee, cardamom pods (used powder), and curry leaves. I had never used tamarind paste before, but I thought it really added a nice balance of sweetness/tanginess to the dish. Great recipe!

Used most of the ingredients except curry leaves.  Used curry instead. I did not follow the method at all as it looked too tedious, I just "winged it". Came out perfecto!  Wonderful flavours!  Thanks, I will be making this again.

This was super exceptional; my guests are still talking about it. I made this accompanied by chapatis and it was finger licking great!
I had no tamarind paste so I used some lemon juice (for the zesty taste) and I substituted the sugar with honey.
Thanks a mil for sharing!

This was really good and not as complicated as it may seem at first glance.  I went light on the tamarind and made my own garlic and ginger paste. Nice, complex flavors.

Pretty good, but I've had better (especially when including the prep time).  My husband and I would have preferred it a little thicker (maybe with some added yogurt) and a little less oily (and I'm not afraid of using healthy fats/oils - I used Tropical Traditions coconut oil).

This is a great recipe. Had to use mutton instead of lamb, Wonderful. Had to cook it longer but flavours were even more intense.

This is excellent. This is the 3rd time making this recipe (prior to this I had never attempted any curry...ever). I have made it with both lamb and goat with preference for the latter. The tamarind paste is definitely necessary. I also added tomato paste, a little extra salt and pepper. I haven't bought the fennel seeds and I also used a Madras spicy curry powder. The last time I added some lentils as well.  This is a great recipe for curry and it's also great to use as a base as you experiment with more ingredients. Thanks so much!

This is time consuming but totally worth it. My husband and I loved it. This was my first experience making lamb and I used lamb stew meat, which was tough. Next time I will choose a better cut of lamb. I wonder how this would be with goat?

The flavour was very nice, however I found it to be too greasy so maybe next time I would use less ghee. Also it is not as thick as what I expected. But overall a yummy dish and you can use the left over herbs and spices and make a pilau tice.

Great heat, great flavor, I would just add about 1 TBS of salt instead of 1 tsp.

A really nice curry, but not in the league of my favourite restaurant Lamb Madras. I tweaked the recipe a little as I went; Tomato Paste, Black Mustard Seeds and 4x the Curry Leaves etc.
We all have our own tastes and I found this to be a good basis to jump from in my quest to duplicate my favourite curry of all time. There is still something missing, but that is not the fault of this recipe. Cheers!!

I  am making this again because my (non-Indian) guest loved it the last time. At the last minute, I could not find tamarind paste, so I substituted chopped up dried apricots. It was a different dish, I guess, but they liked it so much, I'm trying it again tomorrow. I like to make the cubes of lamb smaller, because it is easier to divide the servings into different amounts. I serve it with brown rice. Will report again after my second time, with more exact amounts and whether it was really enough for 8 people.

I make a lot of curries and this was delicious. In my opinion the amount of tamarind is fine as its needed to cut thro the sweetness of the coconut milk. Will definate be making this again soon. Thank you for sharing

My girlfriend and I set out on a mission to cook curry for the first time last night.  We both felt like pro chef's upon first bite--the depth of flavors is amazingly tasty. As suggested by other reviewers, we added 2 tbsp of tomato paste. Also bulked it up with some red bell pepper. Only qualm was that we had purchased the curry leaves but the recipes instructions didn't include them. Regardless of that missing ingredient, the flavors were still complex. Thanks for the fantastic recipe, we will be sure to make it again!

This was fantastic. I used leftover cooked lamb, and just added it near the end. I added potatoes and boiled them with the gravy. Everyone loved it.

Wonderful recipe. Took quite a while to make, but was so worth it. I used chicken instead of lamb and it turned out really well, but I think I will make it with lamb next time to get that extra flavour. The meat was tender and juicy, and the sauce was rich and beautifully fragrant. I've never cooked Indian food before so I was a bit intimidated, but it was pretty easy to make and turned out delicious!

I LOVE this curry. I have only found one Indian restaurant that makes it this way, whenever I try it from a different restaurant it's always tomatoee. So I actually went looking for a recipe that was similar and this is it. My partner and I just had a combined birthday party and I made several dishes. Out of 50 people only 5 said this wasn't their favourite! I was really hoping for leftovers but there was none!  I served it with the naan recipe from this site and was asked by heaps of people for both recipes. Awesome, thank you so much.
