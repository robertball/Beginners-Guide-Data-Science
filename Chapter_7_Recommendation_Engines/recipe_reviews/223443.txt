Start with a good quality smoked salmon and this is just great.  I didn't take the time to whip the cream cheese but otherwise followed the directions.  Making ahead is essential to allow the flavors to blend.  I didn't have the capers so just added in a bit more fresh chives.  I shredded a bit more salmon as a garnish and this was a great addition to my appetizer table.
