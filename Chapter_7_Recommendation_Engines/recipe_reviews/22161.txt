Consider dry-frying the cumin seeds in a cast iron frying pan for several minutes before adding to the rice.  When you hear them "pop" they are ready.  Heat the peas before adding to rice.

I find that it helps to soak the rice in a bowl of water first. Also, when cooking the rice (I usually just use my rice cooker), I like to add a cinnamon stick, 2 cloves, and a couple anise seeds to give it a more traditional flavor and great aroma!

Needs salt.  Followed recipe exactly, thinking the cumin must eliminate need for salt: not! I've given the recipe 5 stars anyway, for ease, looks, and the way it WILL taste next time when I cook it with salt added.

Excellent, excellent recipe.  I didn't have cumin seeds, so I used a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin powder.  I also used chicken broth in place of the water.  It was the most delicious and savory rice I've ever had!!  I served it with chicken and veggie kabobs.  It turned out well, like a restaurant dish!  Thank you for this recipe!!

Nice and simple, but use GROUND cumin seed since the whole seed won't provide much flavor by itself.

Very nice rice. We all enjoyed the flavor of this. I added 1/2 tsp. salt. I'll use this one again. This is a dry rice and really is better with a saucy dish like curry. Thanks Kristine, this went really great with our chicken tonight.

Wow how easy can it get?! I made the rice in my rice cooker as usual and then added the cumin seeds (not ground) and frozen peas when it was done. Closed the lid and let it mesh together for a few minutes and the peas were cooked and rice flavorful.

Chopped some cilantro into it after taking it off the heat.  Wonderful base for the chick-pea curry or mango pickle (from a jar).  We triple the batch and freeze for quick lunches.

I make this all the time.  It is exactly what they serve in most Indian restaurants.  This does NOT need salt!  It's supposed to be slightly sweet due to the basmati rice.  If you're using a different kind of rice, it won't taste to way it's supposed to.  You'll lose the essential aroma of the dish.

Certainly is easy.  A little plain to eat on its own, but makes a great base for curry.  Toast the cumin seeds first in oil, then add rice and water.  Stirred in peas at the end which kept them nice and bright and spiced up the potato chickpea curry.

Per other reviews, I did toast the cumin seeds for a few mins.  I also added a little ground cumin and salt (it may not be authentic, but I thought it needed it after tasting).  Loved this with Indian Tandoori Chicken!

Cumin needs to be toasted, if making for company, ghee or oil could be used. I add the peas right in the beginning after dry roasting cumin.

Absolutely excellent!  I even hate peas and I loved this as did my husband and kids.  I used texmati rice and ground cumin.  Terrific!

Who knew?? Such a simple recipe, soo good.  Will make it time and again. Start with an excellent recipe and tweek it your way,it's still an excellent recipe. I read the reviews and add what I like after reading the reviews This time I added some dried cilantro, whole peppercorns and about  1+ tbsp butter and some salt. I'm not especially great lover of rice, however this was outstanding.  I gonna go find the leftovers right now!

Delicious!  I tried it with Jasmine rice, since I already had it, and added a couple pinches each of salt, garlic, and ground cloves.  I also used ground cumin since I didn't have whole seeds.  Went great with my chicken korma!

A couple of cardamum, a little bit less than cumin seeds, some salt. Be sure not to use basmati from the regular grocery store. Go get some from a Pakistan/Indian store. Tasty though.

For a quick, fried cumin addition (as is suggested by a reviewer), I fry the cumin in the pot before adding the rice and water.  And like many suggested, do add salt!  Saffron or turmeric may also be added with the rice for a nice color and flavor.

Very simple and easy to prepare, really liked the addition of the green peas at the end!  I only had ground cumin, so had to sub that in, but this is one of those side dishes that would be really great with some spicier entrees - alone it's a bit more plain, nonetheless quite good!  Can never go wrong with basmati!

Excellent if lacking a little extra flavor, needed an extra kick... I'll do it again w some saffron or cardemon. So much healthier than drowning rice in butter.

This really does taste like the rice I've had in middle eastern restaurants.  I used Texmati rice and the proportions were perfect (and in fact matched those given on the container).  I toasted the cumin seeds before adding them as suggested by another reviewer; I find that whole cumin seeds have a distinct, fresh flavor that ground cumin doesn't have, so I wouldn't recommend substituting ground for whole.  I was surprised at how much the cumin flavor permeated the rice!  I served it with grilled chicken, but I think it would be wonderful with something saucier, like a curry.

A pretty nice, but simple side dish. I made it to accompany the Curried Coconut Chicken recipe from this site. I made it exactly as written. This was also the first time I'd ever used cumin seeds. I've used a lot of ground cumin in Mexican recipes, and found the cumin seeds here to be a very nice taste. One problem, though; the rice developed a stuck-on layer in the bottom of the saucepan, so I wish I'd stirred it a little during cooking. Overall, though, a very nice recipe, and worth remembering for future meals.

I haven't cooked rice before, but about ten minutes in, all the water was gone. more water then 1 3/4? Also, more peas! each pea was a like a bomb of flavor next to the rice. so adding more pea would be FANTABULOUS.

I love this recipe! It takes a little tweaking and watching it to make sure the rice comes out the right texture, but  the flavor is great and it's just like my favorite indian restaurant makes  it.

I added the cumin seeds along with the rice and let them cook with it. This turned out really well. The plainness of this rice lends itself well to a spicy entree such as Aloo Phujia. With something less spicy and demanding, I would suggest adding some ground cumin as well.

Agreed.  Such a simple recipe with only a few ingredients, yet so flavorful!  I love the cumin seeds in it!

Good simple recipe.  I used brown rice- just boil longer, 35-40 minutes.  To add flavor, I used chicken stock instead of water and ground cumin instead of whole.  Went well with Chicken Papadoris and broccoli.

The flavor of cumin was overpowering and was the only thing I could taste.  The rice was bland and lacked flavor.  I will not be making this again.

I served this rice with a chickpea curry and it was the perfect addition. I cooked the rice with veggie broth instead of water to give it some more flavor, and I used 1/2 tsp of ground cumin which was all I had on hand. Easy and delicious!

It came out really nice, but a significant portion of the rice ended up stuck to the pot. Is there a way to avoid this? Am I using the wrong kind of pot? Anyway, the rice itself was really good.

Not a huge rice fan but decided to make this for father's day.  It was very good.  I used cumin powder based on another reader's reveiw and that worked all well. The rice was flavored throughout.

Decent basmati rice.  I made this using brown basmati.  After presoaking the rice for half an hour, and straining it, I added the water. 3/4 tsp ground cumin, 1/2 tsp salt, and a half Tbsp of vegetable oil.  After the rice cooked, I fluffed it and stirred in the hot, cooked peas.  Great with curry!

Excellent! I dry-fried the cumin seeds as others suggested and as my boyfriend doesn't like peas, I chopped up about 1/2 cup of Spring Onions and added them - it was great! I will make it another time with the peas for me as I know it will be even better! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a really tasty and fast rice dish!  I rinsed the rice in cold water first, and then cooked it in chicken broth with 1 tablespoon of margarine in the microwave (the easiest way to cook rice perfectly.)  I didn't have any cumin seed so I used 1/2 teaspoon of ground cumin.  I also added a little turmeric for color and flavor and garam masala to intensify the Indian flavor.   This recipe was so simple and went great with my garlic and herb chicken breasts.  I will definitely make this again!

Really good.  Let's the flavor of the rice shine through.  I added more peas though since 1/4 cup didn't seem like enough.  Also used ground cumin since I didn't have the seed.

I love basamati rice and have been making it for years. I just wanted to add a little tip I use whenever making it, even as an accompanyment to a main dish. I add 1 tbs. of butter and half dozen whole pepercorns...it adds that little extra flavor w/out tons of calories either!

Very good.  I washed the rice though, with cheese cloth and running water to get rid of some of the starch.  I roast the cumin on the stove before adding it.

Very good! Also tossed in a cinnamon stick and two cloves to replicate the rice served at my favorite Indian restaurant.  Cooked up perfectly fluffy and delicious.  Cumin seeds didn't seem to flavor it as strongly I expected, but they had been hanging around my spice cabinet for a long time.  I don't eat white rice that often, but will make an exception for this dish! Thank you for sharing!

Made by toasting the cumin seeds, added 1 cinnamon stick and a few anise seeds from another reviewer's suggestion then proceeded with the recipe.    Next time, I  will do the same thing except I will use a whole star anise pod instead of the seeds for a a bit more flavor.

I cut the cumin seed to 1/2 tsp and added 2 cups water. Perfect!  Occasionally we add mixed vegetables instead of peas.

This recipe is spot-on. My only change was to omit the cumin and add a heaping teaspoon of sweet curry powder to the water. The curry added a nice boost of both flavor and color. With or without curry (or cumin), this recipe is a keeper!

I really did not care for this recipe at all.  I thought it needed more spice, maybe an onion.  It was easy to make but it cooked in only 10 min, glad I checked it or it would have burned!

very good, simple recipe but more complex than serving plain rice.  I sometimes cook rice in chicken stock to add more flavor.  Very good.  Thank you

This was a tasty alternative than plain rice. I used chicken broth instead of water and added a dash of cinnamon. I could really taste the peas though, maybe a bit too much. I think I will put a little less next time.
