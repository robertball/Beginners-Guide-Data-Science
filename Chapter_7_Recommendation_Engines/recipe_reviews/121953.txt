As one reviewer wrote, I think this recipe could have used a little salt, some more seasoning and more zucchini. We felt that while it was good, it still had too much biscuit mix flavor and not enough zucchini. I would also suggest a 13x9 pan instead of a cake pan. We still enjoyed it.

I'm hesitant to try recipes with little or no reviews, but this one was a treasure! My family truly enjoyed this wonderful bread.. Only change made was I did not toast the almonds. PERFECT!

I think this recipe has potential, but it is missing something.  Maybe salt, maybe more zucchini, maybe more cheese, maybe onion powder, I don't know.  I agree with another reviewer, it was very biscuit-y. I liked it but don't know that I'll make it again.

Yum! This is a nice change from traditional zucchini bread. I made it for a BBQ and it was a big hit! I'm going to be making this a lot! Very easy, too. I didn't have fresh parsley & I left the almonds out, but it was still good.

Sorry, but this wasn’t very good.  I made this into muffins and got 12 big muffins and still threw some of the dough away – definitely more than 6 servings as the recipe indicates.  I thought 3 eggs sounded like a lot and it was.  These were spongy and had an unappealing texture.  Lastly, as soon as I took my first bite, I knew that these were screaming for SALT!  Had I noticed that salt wasn’t listed, I definitely would have put some in.

This is the best recipe I've found, to date, on allrecipes.com - and I've used a lot of them.  Will be making this often.  Thanks for sharing and thanks to other reviewers for modification suggestions!!
