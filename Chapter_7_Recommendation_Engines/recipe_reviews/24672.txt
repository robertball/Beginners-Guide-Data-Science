This ice cream is pretty good. Since I don't have a maker, I just mix the ingredients (usually a big batch!) and put the bowl in the freezer. I check on it every 30 minutes or so and it freezes in a few hours. It's really great, and I recommend everyone try it:)

This is really good and light tasting.  I halved the recipe and to make it taste richer I used 1 can evaporated milk and then added enough 1% milk to make 4 cups and doubled the amount of vanilla. (for the full recipe of 8 cups milk, it would be 2 tbsp instead of 1) I also added a handful strawberries that I crushed a little to the mixture just before freezing.  The next time I make this I think I will decrease the amount of sugar just a little bit because I don't like super-sweet ice cream.  But otherwise, it's really, really nice and guilt-free.  :o)

My husband was recently diagnosed as lactose intolerant and allergic to eggs.  The one thing he has missed is ice cream.  Everything I read said don't bother trying to make homemade ice cream with lactose free milk.  This recipe works great with any of the brands of lactose free milk and tastes just like the soft serve ice cream you get at restaurants.  I did find I have to use our hand crank maker but it turns out excellent in about 18 minutes.

This is the recipe I have been looking for. Most ice cream recipes taste like frozen Cool Whip to me, but this one is perfect! I use 2% Milk and a little less sugar and it's truly the only the dessert I have ever had that is low in fat, but doesn't taste that way. I use this one every time now. LOVE IT! I would give it 20 stars if I could! Thanks so much.

This is perfect!  It's a lighter ice cream.  This recipe is the reason I bought an ice cream maker.  If you like it harder just put it in the freezer for a little while.

I was very surprised with how good this was, especially since it has so few ingredients!  Of course, I added crushed Oreos to it--but that makes ANY ice cream better!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I did not like this recipe. It came out thin and icy and had little ice chunks in it. There was nothing creamy about it. It was more like a vanilla milk slushy. It is very simple to make though.

Yummy! This is an easy cheap way to make ice milk! I have been missing ice milk since it disappeared from stores in the early 90's and I love the texture and taste of homemade ice cream, so I was happy to find this recipe. I like the light sweet taste. I did cut the sugar in half, but when I make this again I will use 1 and 1/2 cups sugar because I think I cut a little TOO much out. I also used 2% milk which worked great. It is after midnight and I am making myself go to sleep because I cannot stop eating the ice milk!!!

What a fantastic and EASY recipe. I like it made with just milk rather than whipping cream-it just tastes lighter and is very refreshing on a hot day. Although no improvements are needed, I sometimes throw in a box of pudding mix-white chocolate is my favorite. I have made this with chocolate milk too. My kids love it!! 
  
*If you are watching your calories-try using fat free milk, splenda sugar blend and sugar free pudding mix.

This tasted great, and worked well. But I prefer Ice cream made with cream, it gives it that HARD ice cream texture as opposed to Snow Ice cream. this was great, refreshing, and I LOVE IT, but I am looking for something more solid. Upon attempting it a second time I replaced the Milk with Heavy cream, came out PERFECT!  Just like scooping it out of a breyers carton.

This was a delicious and easy recipe. I used ingredients I had leftover from a previous ice-cream recipe.  I cut the recipe in half to fit my machine and used the following ratio: 2 cups half and half, 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup whole milk, 1 cup sugar, and 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla.  Tastes just like vanilla ice cream should: rich, creamy, pure.

delicious!! I loved it. To make it very low calorie, and fat, use splenda instead of sugar. it still works. I used two percent milk and splenda.

Yum! I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and decreased the sugar, it wasn't missed at all.  The 2nd time I took 1cup of milk, 1 vanilla bean, sliced it opened, scraping out the inside with a spoon, stirred it in the milk, threw in the vanilla bean and microwaved it till warm.  Then dissolved the sugar in it. Then added the rest of ingredients and placed it in the fridge till cold, put it ice cream maker(I did have to cut recipe in half to fit my machine).  Tasted just like the ice cream we made when I was a kid in the old hand crank machine. Needless to say, there was none left.  And I love the little chunky ice pieces.
Just what I was looking for!  I look forward to adding strawberries, maybe a choc chip mint with vanilla bean. Thanks for sharing

Loved this recipe.  Ice Cream tasted like the snow ice cream my Grandmother made when I was a kid.  Best if served day it's made as it freezes very hard in the freezer.  I made it with Splenda sugar substitute & skim milk.  Quick, easy & tasty!!

I was glad I found this simple recipe to try out my new ice cream maker for the first time.  I didn't have any cream or sweetened condensed milk on hand that most recipes call for and didn't feel like making a trip to the store so this recipe worked out perfectly with only 3 ingredients. It wasn't very rich or creamy but it was still pretty good!

This was good, although the vanilla was a bit overpowering. I used it as a base and steeped some fresh chocolate mint in the liquid overnight, then added some chocolate chips towards the end of churning. It didn't turn out too bad. I think that, next time, I'll use half the vanilla extract and try half-and-half instead of milk...just to see how much of a difference there is.
Still, it has a good flavour for a regular vanilla icecream.

Perfect. It does taste like snow cream.  I've heard so many folks talking about making snow cream this winter (we didn't get a flake!) and I have been craving some.  I followed the directions to a T and it turned out smooth and delicious.  I could close my eyes and it was just like the snow cream Mother used to make for us.  Actually, hers was a LITTLE better, 'cause SHE made it.

I've made this recipe multiple times now. It's so quick and easy! Plus, there are so many variations to try. I like adding cinnamon! Today, however, I added raspberries by smashing them and folding them into the mixture. I use 2% milk, 1 1/2 cups sugar, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla. In the future, I may try adding pudding mix or geletin to make it a bit thicker.

It was a little runny and didn't quite freeze enough, but was relatively creamy.  I think if I make it again I'll freeze it overnight to let it set.  It has a good flavor to it.  I added some orange extract to it and it had a dreamsicle flavor to it.  :)

Great simple recipe! Hubby asks for it all the time. I think it is more like "ice milk" than "ice cream" but still yummy! I am now hunting for a chocolate one as simple...maybe use chocolate milk? Hmmm...I wonder!

I used this recipe as a base. I halved the recipe for my electric machine, using a 15 oz. can of coconut milk and enough almond milk to make 4 cups. Then I added one REALLY ripe banana and 2 T crushed pineapple (I cut the sugar back to 3/4 cup)... FANTASTIC!

I didn't have an ice cream maker, but who knew I wouldn't need one! I was shocked at how easy ice cream is to make! I also made a strawberry flavor with strawberries and made a chocolate flavor with unsweetened cocoa powder.

While this recipe was tasty and refreshing it also melted incredibly quickly and became more of a slush than an ice cream.

Simple -- just what I was looking for.  I decreased the sugar and compensated by adding a bit of Bailey's.  Delicious!

I read several of the reviews, so I knew this had the possibility of being too icy.  And then, after we had it all hooked up and spinning in the ice cream maker, I realized that I didn't have enough ice to fill the bucket like I should have!  So I was thrilled that it came out so yummy.  Of course, it isn't as creamy as other ice creams; there isn't as much cream when you use regular milk instead of whipping cream.  But this was easy easy easy, everyone in the family loved it, and we will definitely do it again very soon!

Definitely easy to make but it is too watery tasting and really is not good to eat after it has been stored due to all the ice crystals. The recipe is missing the heavy cream that is typically in the vanilla ice cream recipes that makes it smooth.

This was SO good!  I was looking for a quick and easy cool treat to make on a hot day.  This definitely hit the spot.  My kids and husband loved it.  I substitued Splenda for half of the sugar and it came out wonderful!  I will be making it again...and again...and again!

Great ice cream recipe.  I've used varying types of milk (i.e. skim, 2%, etc) depending on how healthy I feel and each time it turns out great.  You can obviously add nuts, fruits, candy, etc. to change the taste of the ice cream, which is very fun!  Thank you for this simple & tasty recipe.

Thanks to Margie for this perfectly quick, easy and affordable recipe.  Best of all, it's imple enough that everyone can put their own twist on it.  Great as-is, or add fruit, flavored extract, less sugar, more sugar, exchange a portion of the milk with 1/2 & 1/2....possibilities are endless.  Consider this a great "starter" recipe for all summertime fun treats.

Although this had great flavor, it was not creamy at all.  Very icy and almost impossible to make a pretty scoop with, it kinda just falls apart into ice flakes.  4 stars though because it does taste delicious :)

Our favorite go-to recipe. Turns out perfect every time. I've made it with coconut milk as well. Freezes great. We leave it sitting out for about five minutes and it softens up a bit.

We love this recipe! We make it with unsweetened almond milk due to dairy allergy. Super yummy! It is a tad more icy than regular hm ice cream recipes. But we cannot complain since there is no actual cream! We love adding fruit and cookies!

Yum!!!!!! Perfect ice cream recipe. I followed another review and added one can of sweet and condensed milk and it is delicious! Next time I will probably omit the sugar if I use sweet and condensed milk again, just to make it a little less sweet.  Great easy ice cream!

I halved the recipe for my Cuisinart maker and replaced 25% of the milk with heavy cream. The ice cream came out great and was delicious that evening and the next day. After that it started getting icy (a common problem with homemade ice cream in general and non-custard ices in particular). Obviously, it's not as rich as an egg-based version, but it's much easier to make. This ice cream begs for toppings and mix-ins -- we'll be trying strawberries next.

This is so easy, you get out exactly what you put in. It starts out looking and tasting like ice cream, and five minutes later you have vanilla flavored water. If you used some cream this recipe would be 100 times better I'm sure.

I don't have an ice cream maker, so I just made this in the freezer and stirred it every 15-30 minutes. It was very tasty! not as creamy as I'd like (probably because of the lack of ice cream maker), and not as "full" I think that a custard base would be better, but if you just want ice cream and don't have much on hand, this will hit the spot.

Great recipe! I don't have an ice cream machine, so I just mixed the ingredients together, put the bowl in the freezer, and waited a few hours. The result was a wonderful, refreshing, vanilla slushy. Great recipe for warm summer days!

That was amazing!!!! To give it a richer texture instead of two cups of milk I did one and a half cups of milk and half a cup of whipping cream. I also found the recipe versitile, you can substitute the vanilla extract for something else, in my case lavender syrup.

Super quick and easy to make. I followed another reviewers suggestion and used a can of evaporated milk and used 2% milk. Tastes like the ice cream I used to eat in England when I was growing up. My kids make this with minimal mess or supervisio.

Although easy to make, I have to agree with other reviewers that this recipe yields more of a vanilla slush than ice cream.  Leftovers will also freeze into a solid lump of ice.

This is super easy and very sweet and tasty.  My kids really liked it and I liked how much lower in fat and calories than regular ice cream it is (do you know the calories in whipping cream? Ack!  LOL).  I think the people who are unhappy are not following the last step of the directions-- freeze according to manufacturer directions.  It will be very watery if you serve it without freezing for at least a couple of hours!  And of course it won't be super creamy, there's not much fat.  My kids ate it right away anyway (with coconut, chopped walnuts and chocolate chips stirred in) and loved it.  We made it with whole milk since I figured using anything with less fat would probably be too watery. I also noticed that half the great reviews changed it to be made with cream or evaporated milk, which is making a totally different recipe.  This one is kind of icy but it's still quite good.  It's cheaper, healthier and easier than 95% of the ice cream recipes out there.  We plan on making it again tomorrow night.  :)

I loved this ice cream!  It has a nice texture without being too creamy or smooth and has a wonderful taste.  I'm one of those people who likes their ice cream a bit rougher.  I also love how amazingly easy this recipe is!  BUT, if you like your ice cream to be super creamy, then you won't like this recipe.

I had to try this simple recipe! I don't have an ice cream maker, so I just combined everything in a bowl, put it in the freezer, and then took it out every 30 minutes or so to beat the mixture with a hand mixer. Consistency turned out great, but unfortunately waaay to sweet for my taste :( I was thinking of throwing the entire batch out when it occurred to me to try adding some lemon juice to balance out the sugar, and what do you know, suddenly I had the most delicious lemon ice cream ever! :)

For such a simple ice cream I have to give this five stars! I was in the mood for a simple treat and I decided to buy a package of those instant milk drinks. The flavour was peanut punch. I mixed it up nice and thick, skipped the sugar as the drink already had enough sugar and still added in the vanilla. Let me say I was quite surprised at the outcome. Such a soft, light, creamy and delicious peanut flavoured ice cream! But I have to agree, if you are eating it right away it does start to melt quickly. Next time I will try this recipe as is though, I am sure it will be just as good!

I agree with some reviews, it was more like a sweet slush. It was good, but I'm looking for a creamier ice cream. I think that's the difference between this recipe and recipes that call for heavy cream and maybe boiling it all. But it's a nice, simple recipe.

Wow!  This is an excellent rich but not heavy classic no-cook, no-egg recipe.  It's the recipe I remember eating when I was a kid and we would make homemade ice cream in the big machine packing the outside with rock salt and crushed ice.  It doesn't get any better than ice cream with a 3-ingredient list.  I also substituted some half and half for the milk which made it just a bit richer and creamier.

We used to make this with my pre-school class and take to a family picnic...just add fruit or flavoring of your choice. It's so easy, tastes great, and is MUCH healthier than a lot of ice cream recipes. Love it!

Oh my word.. lol This recipe is so GOOD!!!!  I just made it today.. I did a couple of things differently.  First I halved the recipe... then I added 2 cups skim milk and 2 cups whipping cream.  I also added fresh pureed strawberries and cherries..a little cherry juice and some cut up strawberries..  It took a little longer to set.. but I am telling you.. this is not a good thing to make when you are on a diet like ME! lol  Definitely the best homemade ice cream I have come across so far!!! :)

I've made this several times now and it's so quick and easy!!  I cut it in half and it fits just right in my Kitchenaide stand mixer ice cream attachment.  I like to use heavy cream instead of milk, and let it set in the freezer overnight.  Mmmmm!  My wife likes it better than Blue Bell.

Quite addictive!  Reminded me of the sweet white topping often poured over snow cones.   I would definately reduce the amount of sugar, but would certainly make again.

Not bad at all. Great flavour and very easy to make. Not all that creamy, but still a cool, low-fat, satisfying treat. I'd still perfer ice cream or frozen yogurt though...

Excellent old fashioned recipe! To make a bit richer, my grandmother would add 1 pint half and half to the ingredients. Love the sweetness. 

For a great kids day, place 1 cup mixtures into a half pound coffee cans. Place the lidded can into a pound coffee can. Place ice and rock salt around the can and put the lid on. Tape it down so it doesn’t accidentally come off and let the kids shake and roll the cans for 30 minutes.

Be sure and wash off the half pound can before opening. Children can eat their sweet treat right from the can!

Easy with minimal ingredients.
Great simple flavor.
More icy and not as creamy as other homemade ice-cream.  (If you have the time/money to substitute some of the milk with cream and sweetened condensed milk, it would be creamier and have a better texture.)

The ice cream was good but It recommended a lot more sugar than necessary. We masked the sweetness my adding backing chocolate shavings then it tasted much better. It was more of icy consistency, but overall, it was good.

Turned our great. Added one package of sugar free instant pudding; reduced sugar to 2/3 cup. Chilled it over night, put it in the ice cream maker; added strawberry jam at the end of the process. It has less fat, less calories and sugar, no cooking. A little icy, but creamy and tasty. Very good alternative to frozen custard,

This was a delicious recipe, but it would probably get 4 stars on taste alone. However, it was so incredibly easy (and with ingredients typically on hand), it must get 5.  I couldn't resist following another reviewer's suggestion on another recipe and adding 1/4 c vanilla flavored powdered coffee creamer (I used Italian Sweet Cream flavor).  We will make this recipe many times this summer, I'm sure.

This did not freeze well for me. I left it in the ice cream maker for about 45 minutes and it never even started to thicken. I then put it into the freezer, where it turned into a giant block of ice. It was nearly impossible to scoop, but I could shave it off with a metal spoon.   The flavor was fine (like sweet, vanilla-flavored milk), but it was much too icy and watery for my taste.

I cannot believe how easy this was. It tasted great too. It wasn't quite as creamy as normal ice cream, but you can't really expect that when it uses milk and not cream. If you want something creamier just replace some or all of the milk with cream. Thanks for the recipe.

If you love going to Rita's and getting 'Cream Ice', then you will love this recipe.  We made it about 10 times this summer.  It is so easy and quick.  We added misc. ingredients to it like oreo cookies, raspberries, mini-chocolate chips.  I will definitely continue making this recipe.

So easy and it seemed like it was ready quite fast.  I followed the recipe (almost) exactly--I added just a drip or two more of vanilla extract.  The ice cream got rave reviews from everyone on our softball team--I'll be makin this again very soon.

I thought the texture was refreshing and great for a less heavy ice cream.
My husband added to much vanilla though, so don't make that mistake!

This reminds me a lot of snow ice cream.
