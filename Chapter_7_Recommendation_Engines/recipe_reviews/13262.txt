This soup was fabulous.  Even though it did take a little while to make it, it was well worth the effort.  I was a little hesitant at first to add the soy sauce, but was glad that I did, as it really added to the taste.  My husband and I both loved it.

Delicious!  A great way to use fresh veggies.  I added garlic, as well, and it tasted great.

This was very good, but a lot of work with many dirty dishes at the end.  I would suggest adding additional barley and sprinkling fresh parmesan cheese on top when serving.

This seemed a little bland, and I did not like the combination of potatoes and pasta together in one dish.

I wanted to like this soup, I really did.  Out of all the choices on this site, I zeroed in on this one and wound up being really disappointed.  Disappointed because of how labor intensive it was to make it.  Because I'm not a big fan of thyme, I reduced that amount but where's the flavor??  No other spices to rev this up past 1st gear.  I added lots more soy sauce (reduced sodium of course) and had already sauteed garlic and portabello mushrooms along with the onions.  Oh well... all my produce down the drain.  :(

This is a good recipe- lots of chopping and prep is worth it, I think, and it's not very complicated!  You might want to try adding a little garlic or garlic salt- after all, it's hard to imagine potato soup without garlic!

This soup was deeelicious! I served it a dinner party for 15 people, and it was loved by both adults and kids. Just be aware that it takes a while to make.

Excellent recipe - somewhere between creamy potato soup and minestrone. I decreased the cooking time for the pasta so it wouldn't get over done. I would recommend using butter instead of margarine. I also added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp fennel seeds. The fennel made it really delicious. I will be making this on a regular basis from now on!
