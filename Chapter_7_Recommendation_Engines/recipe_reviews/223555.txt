I just made this for dinner, and it was absolutely delicious! The hens were so succulent and the cherry sauce was just tart enough to bring all of the flavors together. Can't wait to make it again!

The cornish hens are great, but skip the sauce.  It's expensive and not any good.  Substitute regular cherry preserves for the sauce.

The tart cherry sauce really didn't cut it.  It did not thicken enough to be meaningful despite using 3 tbsp of flour.  Also, I would not go through making the rub again as it is washed away during the white wine basting.  I have made far better hens with much less effort.

I made this with chicken breasts and seasoned them as per the recipe. I did not baste with white wine. I used about a quarter cup of red wine in the cherry sauce and the remaining ingredients as listed. We enjoyed it very much and will make it again.

Hen was delicious. I would skip the sauce next time or try something different to top it with.

The cherry sauce was not well received but the Cornish hens were delicious with nice crisp skins! Our cat tried to steals carcass for himself after the meal so clearly everyone thought it was or looked delicious!

Wonderful mix of flavor.  I was worried it would be too sweet for me however it was a very nice balance of flavors.  It did make quite a bit of cherry sauce, easily enough for 4 hens.
