After converting this recipe to metric I then poured the dry ingridents into Australian measuring cups. My husband helped, so we had two people ensuring the QA process, though if it goes wrong, blame the chef, not the recipe!! or me!! 2 1/2 cups glace cherries - not chopped; 1 1/2 cups mixed citrus peel; 2 cups raisins ;1 cup currants ;1 1/4 cup sultanas (substitution for dates); 1 1/4 cup slivered almonds; 120 ml brandy; 1/2 cup flour for the dredging; 2 cups flour for the batter; 1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda (same as baking soda); 1/2 teaspoon cloves - I sub with ginger spice instead cloves too strong;1/2 teaspoon all spice - I add 1 teaspoon 1/2 teaspoon cinamon - I add one teaspoon ;1/2 teaspoon of salt; 250g butter, as I could not be bothered leaving behind the 25 grams - your choice;3 cups brown sugar; 6 eggs; 180ml treacle - same as molasses; 180ml apple juice - little tetra packs handy size to buy. Pleased double check ingredients against original recipe and for the spices please use your taste buds as some may require more. As there is heaps of batter use non stick baking paper to extend above the side of the tins, go at least 5cm as it does raise pretty high. Also from my experience it took about 3.5 hours in a fan forced oven. I based this on a 20cm round pan.

I've used this recipe for my Christmas cake for the past three years and have had nothing but compliments.  Have found using nutmeg instead of allspice gives better flavour.  Make early and dredge in brandy weekly for best results!

We are English so icing and marzipan were a must on this deliciously moist cake.  I started making it at the beginning of December and soaked the fruit in brandy for two days.  I was unable to get currants so added more raisins.  Three hours in the oven and it was cooked to perfection.  I stored it for a couple of weeks then covered it with almond paste and icing.  A ribbon around the edge, a santa, angel and christmas tree made it look seasonal.  Thank you Carol; this is my first go at making a Christmas cake (should not admit that, but it is) and I felt like Chef Ramsey when my husband said "This is so scrumptious, can I have another piece?."

Moist, rich flavourfull cake that I recieved rave reviews on. I did afew changes to the recipe..omitted the coloured cherries used about 1/2 cup of home made pureed orange rind to have a touch of orange flaviour through the cake..added (1 cup each )walnuts, pecans, brazil nuts chopped small because I do love nuts ..and I doubled the dates..Last note I found that I didn't need to bake my cakes as indicated they were ready in 2 hours

I made this cake for the first time last year. Instead of I big cake though I made five smaller cakes which made excellent presents. I love this recipe and everyone who received a cake for christmas wants another one this year.

I make this cake every year as it was a huge success the first year I attempted it. I made a few changes though, 3/4 molasses sounded too strong so i halve it and put an equal amount of summer fruit jam, i also add ginger and dried papaya and chopped karithaki (a sweet walnut, Greeks will know what i'm talking about). I also drenge it with brandy every couple of days up to icing day. Excellent recipe.

This is an incredible Christmas cake recipe. I made the cake this past November(2011). The only thing I added. After the cake had cooled, I poked holes down through the top with a chopstick & spooned brandy over the top so it ran into the holes. A week later I dribbled more brandy into the holes & then again after another week. I'm British so I know good fruit cake. Even though we usually make our fruit cakes months ahead of Christmas, this cake was excellent in just a couple of weeks. Thanks Carol for sharing this recipe. I thought my regular recipe was unbeatable but believe me when I say that your recipe will be the only one I will be using from now.

I must have done something wrong. The butter/egg mixture curdled. I had to add a LOT more flour than called for otherwise it was just a liquidy gooey mess (but with all that fruit and brandy in it, I wasn't going to give up!) It tasted okay, but was quite dry. I also used two loaf pans instead of one larger pan. WHAT did I do wrong???

This recipe used spices I really like to use in baking.  I use allspice quite a bit.  Also the molasses makes this cake unique.  I used Apple cider instead of apple juice.  I prefer to use more dried fruit instead of the glacé fruit.  I reduced the heavily sugared glacé fruit and added more dried fruit such as dried apples and apricots.  Buying a food scale has made all the difference in my baking and I ended up with 3 pounds of fruit altogether.  I am a traditionalist and wanted a recipe that reminded me of the fruit cakes I ate as a child.  The best part of baking fruit cakes is that as bakers we can make changes and it still comes out great!  Happy Holidays!

I have made this recipe now 3 years in a row.  I get compliments on it every year.  The only thing I do differently is I make the cake in 2 loaf pans.  I always have difficulty getting the larger round cakes to cook completely.  I cook the loaf pans the same amount of time indicated in the recipe and they come out great!!!
