I give this recipe 4 stars because the flavors are delicious, but it can easily be a 5 star dish by adding some changes. 

to the mixture:
1) I added a teaspoon of minced garlic to give it a more savory flavor
2) added a 1/4 cup of cream cheese (i like my ravioli really cheesy). The cream cheese perfectly complemented the pumpkin flavor
3)  I used pumpkin pie mix instead of straight pumpkin puree. 


The Sauce:

Instead of the recommended sauce, I used the remaining pumpkin pie mix to make a pumpkin sage cream sauce.  It was absolutely delicious.

Just mix in a shallow pan or skillet a 1/2 a cup of pumpkin pie mix with a cup of heavy cream.  Add 1/4 cup of romano cheese.  Chopped some sage leaves and put it into the mix.  Add pepper and salt and stir the mixture.  Let the sauce simmer for a few minutes until the sauce thickens.

Haven't tried this recipe but an easy trick to make it easier is to use wanton skins available in any grocery store instead of makeing dough from scratch.

This is an excellent recipe!  I made the following substitutions:  used a combination of homemade kefir-based ricotta-type cheese and store-bought Neufchatel to replace all the ricotta in the recipe and used tomato sauce instead of tomato paste (it's what I had).  I just didn't need to add any water to the pasta dough.

I've often made noodles from scratch before, but this was my 1st time making ravioli.  It was time-consuming, but a fun project for my 6 yo to help with.  Just make sure you dry the ravioli as directed before boiling...otherwise, you'll end up with the filling leaking out into the pasta water (like I did).

This is definitely going into my regular recipe rotation!

This recipe has inspired me to turn it into a desert using wanton wraps. Add sugar and vanilla to the punpkin mixture and deep fry. Sprinkle with powered sugar and serve warm.

Really great flavor! I am using it as an app. on Thanksgiving. It takes a little practice to make the ravioli pretty if you have never made them before. I even made the recipe non-dairy by using a little tofu 'sour cream' instead of the cheese and it was still good!

A wonderfully flavored ravioli.  I was looking for a pumpkin ravioli that held up to the flavors I wanted and this was the recipe.  This fit the bill beautifully! I have to say however, to those who gave this less than it a deserved rating simply because it took some work I have to ask " WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU THINKING?" The whole idea of making these wonderful ravioli is making them from scratch. What may I ask were you looking for?   Go to your grociers premade pasta shelves if you want to do less work, but be forewarned, 1) you won't easily find pumpkin and 2) you won't find the flavor.If you don't want to do the work to have the experience of creating something from scratch than don't rate it, but if you are not feeling lazy, go for this recipe because it is a winner!

This recipe has been repeatedly used for making pasta dough (I have yet to make the ravioli, though.).  With just a little bit more flour added to the recipe, my bread machine did all of the work in preparing this dough.  Then, I prepared it using my Kitchen aid pasta attachments to create fettucini.  Thank you so much for submitting such a great recipe.  I'll be sure to make it into ravioli in the future as well.

I LOVED IT!!! It is a FANTASTIC way to use up the pumpkin frozen after Halloween-Pumpkin is VERY nutritious, and my kids were a little leary at first because of the color, and they thought pumpkin was only for pie- but one taste and they were hooked!

Loved this pasta. It really helps to have a Cuisinart to kneed the dough, a pasta machine to roll it out (works WONDERS) and a pastry wheel. Since I have all three of these tools, this was a breeze to make. I have also made a lot of other homemade pasta. If you have never made it, give it a try but set aside some "learing time" to get used to the process. I used Mace instead of nutmeg as it is a bit warmer. I used regular canned sauce and it was yummy. Worth the work. The only thing I need to practice is not getting air into the pockets as the ravioli floats to the top then. I also had a few "blow out" while boilding. You'll want to gently simmer this to keep the ravioli pillows intact.

This was very tasty.  I substituted canned pumpkin for fresh, and therefore used more pumpkin and less ricotta cheese.  I also added some sun-dried tomatos and a small bit of roasted red pepper to the pasta dough.  I served it with an alfredo sauce I made from butter, milk, cornstarch, and parmesan cheese.  I also added about 1 tablespoon of maple syrup to the sauce, since I wanted it to be just a bit sweet.  My husband and I both loved it.  It's only 4 stars, though, because it does involve a lot of work.

This is good only for people who have a few extra hours on their hands to make something that ultimately tastes... interesting... but not really all that good.  Like a lot of things in life, I appreciated the experience, but I'll never do it again.

These were delicious!  I added on clove of crushed garlic to the filling and some freshly ground pepper and followed the rest of the directions exactly (that's why it only got four stars, not enough taste in filling without garlic and pepper).  I made my own creamy garlic and sage sauce to top it and it was fabulous!

I really enjoyed this recipe and I followed it exactly.  The dough was easy to work with and I rolled it out with a rolling pin.  The first half I made traditional square ravioli style following the directions, and the second half I used a biscuit cutter to make 2-in circles of dough and sealed them up like calzones.  This was easier, but re-rolling the extra scraps after cutting is tricky because they are very elastic and need to rest again.  I had about 1/3 cup of filling leftover at the end--my raviolis didn't seem underfilled but maybe I just rolled my dough out thicker than I should have.   I boiled the raviolis gently in small batches and took them out with a slotted spoon when they floated to the top (about 5 min or less).  Not a single one burst, and I was pretty worried that they weren't sealed very well by the looks of them.  I topped them with a plain marinara and fresh chopped parsley. My preschool age boys (who helped me make them) gobbled them up!

This was great! If you lack pasta-making experience and the proper tools, this will take a long time to do. That's okay, though!!! You have to get that experience from somewhere! Pasta gets so much easier once you've done it five or more times. The first tries are messy and not always fruitful. I do recommend a pasta roller and ravioli press. Overall, this was a tasty recipe that the whole family enjoyed! It's really not difficult once you have experience with making ravioli and the tools to do it! My 3 year old helped me mix the filling and I made it with her and my 1 year old watching. Yay!

This only works if you have a pasta machine (which I don't). I gave up on the dough after an hour because I couldn't get it rolled out. Unfortunately, I had already made the filling so I used jumbo shells and stuffed them with the pumpkin ricotta.

Very tasty.  A little tricky to roll out the pasta without a pasta machine, but with a machine this would be a breeze.  My husband was quite pleased with them.

Even though the reviews for this recipe were 1/2 and 1/2....I was hopeful.  Unfortunatly I was seriously disapointed.  It had so much potential!! But the pumpkin and ricotta are both such mild flavors it was very bland.  And, I used the wonton wrappers to save time but that idea flopped too.  Ravioli pasta is normally nice and thick, but the wonton wrappers become super thin, transparent and slimy when cooked (which is great for wonton soup, but not for pasta).  I hate wasting food but I had no choice but to throw out all the leftovers :(

This didn't really have much of a pumpkin taste at all when boiling the pasta, which kind of surprised us.  (I made it with my SIL for dinner tonight.) We didn't use the recipe for the pasta itself--just the filling--we made a basic egg pasta for the pasta.  We had to sub mozzarella for the cheese (we forgot the pasta would need filled right away and didn't have time to run to the store).  I wasn't really sure what "tender" meant in terms of the pasta, so I just winged it.  It was ready in about 15-20 minutes.  We also tried baking the ravioli--which took about 20 min in a 350 degree oven.  They turned out really crisp, like pizza bites, and we could taste the pumpkin in those.  Although the baked ones definitely need sauce when baked!--we served with spaghetti sauce, and it was good.  We knew that this would take a lot of time, and we had a lot of fun making the pasta, so we thought it was worth it.  My SIL, not the biggest fan of pumpkin, liked these.  So did my brother and the bf.  So I count it as a success.  Certainly not something I'd make every day (I'm no ravioli expert by any means and don't often have that much time) but fun when you have the time to make pasta from scratch.  Thanks for the recipe!

Used this recipe filling as is, but made simple egg noodle pasta sheets with the Kitchenaide for the ravioli.  Topped with melted butter and Parmesan cheese.  Next time I will try adding a clove of garlic and some Parmesan to the filling for a little more flavor.  But overall nice simple meal.

These were delicious. I only gave it four star because it took a lot of effort to make these. I used a pumpkin sage sauce that I had found on this website and it went well with these. I will use the sauce again but I don't have the time to make ravioli so I will not be making these again

Great recipe!  I took the advice of the first reviewer and added cream cheese and garlic to the filling mixture.  I also threw in some fresh ground ginger.  I used pumpkin pie filling rather than just pumpkin and I think that may have made it too sweet.  I think this recipe would have turned out perfectly if I had a pasta roller, because I just couldn't get the pasta thin enough.

I was surprised by how red the pasta was!  By using my ravioli maker, I had no trouble filling the pasta, and I realized that the process would take a while!  With my frozen pumpkin, there was not much pumpkin taste, so I will be using the canned variety next time.

Great variation from regular raviolis!  wasn't too crazy about the pumpkin seed cream sauce, but with another one, it'll be a bigger hit, I think!

i really like this recipe, with a few alterations. i added 1-2 cloves finely chopped garlic and chopped fresh parsely to the filling, along with some ground black pepper. i have made the dough, but it's very time consuming, so next time i will use wanton wrappers. i served just with a marinara sauce to save calories, and it was delicious

I made this by hand on Saturday night and my husband and I loved it so much that on Sunday we purchased the pasta roller for our Kitchen Aid and made it again (which was a lot easier).  I made the recipe exactly as written and it was very good.  I'll definitely be making it again and again.  There were no left overs two nights in a row!

This recipe was delicious!  I changed a few things.  In the filling i added a 1/4 cup of cream cheese, stated previously in another review. The dough was alittle "doughy", so I let the ravioli dry in the fridge before cooking them.  The sauce: in a pan,saute garlic, add the 1/2 cup pumpkin puree and 1 cup heavy cream, a dash of lemon juice, and season with salt,pepper and italian seasonings.

Concept of tomatoe past in the pasta sounded like a good idea, but when all was said and done (and there was alot of doing, having to make the ravioli from scratch), it was really kind of bland. None of my kids would eat it, and the Pumpkin seed sauce was runny. Would not spend the time making it again.

These were a lot of work, but worth it. Making homemade ravioli is not as easy as it sounds. I will tone down the nutmeg next time.  Rave reviews from my dinner guests.

I give these a 5 mainly for the dough, which my husband and I intend to use in the future with other fillings and red sauce.  However, I did think these were a tiny bit on the bland side, and found myself salting my dish during dinner.  I ended up using almost a cup and a half of ricotta and I doubled the pumpkin (1/2 cup just seemed like so little for a recipe featuring pumpkin as the main attraction).  I used a bit more salt in the filling.  For those who found this recipe too bland, I would suggest tasting everything along to way- a little extra seasoning saved the end result, in our case.  We'll make these again, possibly with some of our own changes. I served these with the suggested pumpkin seed sauce from this site. (I made lots of changes to the sauce, too).

I had never made ravioli before and this was a very simple recipe to follow. Not quite 5 stars becuase the dough was a little "doughy".

I made this using won ton wrappers instead of making my own pasta.  As per some other reviews I added a little cream cheese, some onion powder and garlic powder.  I made the pumpkin/cream/sage sauce suggested by another reviewer, only I sauteed some shallots and garlic before adding the rest of the ingredients.  We really enjoyed it!   Will definitely make this again - though only as a special treat since it's not exactly health food with that cream sauce!

This recipe was delicious! Although I may have just used it as a building block for my own raviolis, I felt that this 'as is' is also very good. I especially liked adding the tomato to the breading portion as well. I will be trying this again with butternut squash very soon! 

If you are trying these out, do not become scared of the amount of time it will take to make them, They are well worth the time.

First time making pasta from scratch, without any tools or knowledge I think it came out very good. However I'll be investing in a ravioli mold and pasta attachment for the Kitchen aide! 


Great flavor in pasta and filling, everyone loved them.

We love this recipe with a little tweek. Since Ricotta is a little on the spendy side here, I substituted cream cheese with great successs (thumbs up from 4 boys ages 10-15, they will eat seconds and request it).  Also, having a pasta maker and ravioli press helps. I had tried it many years before with out the right equipment and it was a total bust. We cook in spaghetti sauce.

I found that I did not like the nutmeg and the pumpkin in a ravioli.
I liked how the pasta it's self came out though.

I'm not a beginner cook by any means buy this recipe was a little difficult! The filling is delicious with a little more pumpkin, nutmeg and I added a little cinnamon to make it a little sweeter. I used to wonton shells and it still took a good chunk of time. Filling is yummy though!!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  My only adjustment was adding a little sugar to the filling because we like things like this on the sweeter side.  I've made the whole recipe (including the pasta) as well as taken the short cut of using won tons.  They're delicious with a little brown butter sauce and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese and pair nicely with any number of meat/main dishes.

I just finished trying to make this and I don't have a pasta maker. I was not able to roll the dough out as it was too elasticy. I did save the filling and I will stuff some shells with it. I was dissapointed at all the time and effort I spent to just have to throw it away. Maybe when I get a kitchenaid I will try again
