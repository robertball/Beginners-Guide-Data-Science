Wow!!! I’ve been wanting to make my own marshmallows but keep forgetting to find a recipe to try. This one fell into my lap and it doesn’t disappoint! Easy to make, the wait was rough but completely worth it for the end result! I love coconut and this was perfect in my hot chocolate. I’m thinking about making these as a treat for the holidays next year for sure!
