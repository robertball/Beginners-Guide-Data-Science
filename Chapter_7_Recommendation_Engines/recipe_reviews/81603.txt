I looked up this recipe because I have been told that eggplant is good for my heart, and I was looking for ways of preparing it without frying.  As far as the recipe, I thought it was not as creamy as *I* like, so I added a 1/2 cup of almond milk yogurt (I can't have dairy).  Other than that, it was ABSOLUTELY DE-LISH!  My husband doesn't like eggplant at all, and he is devouring it as I type :o)   Thank you for this recipe!

I would much rather give this recipe 4.5 instead of 4. I thought it was excellent. The process was easy, the texture was perfect and it was delicious! But I also felt that it had a little too much lemon flavor, but that's a matter of personal taste I suppose.
