I like the ratio of cheese to sugar in this one.  I used the basic idea but made some very non-traditional additions.  First, you really do  need to drain the ricotta, and I prefer whole milk for the richness.  Powdered sugar is a must, also.  But I don't like the citron, so here's where mine really veers off the beaten path.  I add vanilla powder, a spoonful or two of mascarpone cheese, a splash of really good dark rum, chopped dried cherries (tart is my preference), and chopped toasted almonds.  I drizzle my cannoli shells with dark chocolate and let that set, and then fill the shells with my ricotta mixture.  It's certainly not traditional, but in my family, these reign supreme.

I used this recipe but substituted mini chocolate chips for the citron.  I also dipped the ends in crushed pistachio nuts. No alcohol needed! These were fantastic!!

This didn't rate for me. It was very wet, lumpy and sweet. I wanted to use it to fill dark chocolate cupcakes but had to jump to plan B. Germans!! Thankfully they had some "grown up" cupcakes left! My 74 year old mother wouldn't have enjoyed cookie monster cupcakes at her birthday dinner. Still searching for that smooth canoli filling recipe.
