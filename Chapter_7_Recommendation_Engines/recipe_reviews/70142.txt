First time making eggplant ever, and this helped me get rave reviews!  I added some garlic to the reduced fat mayo, some parmesean to the seasoned bread crumbs, heated some spaghetti sauce and toasted some bread!  Add some mozzerella, and everyone had the yummiest eggplant parmesean sandwiches ever!  Even my vegetarian friend who earlier swore to me he hated eggplant.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Okay now this is GREAT eggplant!  I recieved a couple of eggplants from my local produce group and didn't know what to do with them.  All the other eggplant recipes I have tried the eggplant comes out mushy.  This is EXCELLENT!  I used lowfat mayo and seasoned my own breadcrumbs.  They came out nice and brown in the oven and not at all mushy. After they were done browning, I put a little bit of marinara and low fat mozzerella over each one and then put them under the broiler. Yummy! Thanks Pauline for a great recipe!

Easy yes, but I'd have rather it had been NOT so easy to make but ending up with something more special. Even adding Greek seasoning to the crumbs didn't redeem this from being rather boring and bland.  I think sauteeing this rather than baking it would have been a better choice, which would have given this a tasty and crisp, golden brown exterior.

Thank you for this super easy method of cooking eggplant.  The second time I made it, I made the slices about 1" thick and it seemed to give them more substance when finished.  I added garlic to the mayo and parmesan to the bread crumbs to add some flavor.  Now I just need some ideas of how to use them other than a side dish.

This was so easy and oh so yummy!! They kinda of taste like fried green tomatoes. After they came out of the oven I sprinkled cheese on them. Next time I do need to slice them a lot thicker, they shrank in the oven.

I was very excited about this recipe and I wanted to like it sooo much. BUT it just wasnt good. I was expecting a crisp crust and a soft inside, it was dry and soft throughout. I even used a previous suggestion and added a tomato, marinara sauce, and parm cheese, and it still just taste bad. I will stick to the Mississippi eggplant french fries also on this site, those are incredible!

I have tried a lot of eggplant recipes, and this one was by far the best!  It is so easy and they turned out perfect - great texture and not too loaded with oil.  I put slices of mozzarella cheese and fresh basil on mine, and dipped them in basalmic vinegar. Yum!  Thanks for a great recipe - I will never fry eggplant again!

WONDERFUL! Such a tastey and easy way to prepare eggplant, who would have thought?!?  Made this for dinner and my one year old daughter loved it!  Had some left overs the next day and baked them in the toaster oven and made a toasted eggplant sandwich with some provolone and home made garlic bread --- oh so yummy!  This is my new favorite way to prepare eggplant! Thanks for this recipe!

I have been searching for an easy alternative to frying eggplant, so I was very excited about this recipe.  It was very good as it was written, and I also layered eggplant, marinara sauce mozz & parm. cheese and threw it under the broiler for a few.  It was the easiest eggplant parmisian I've ever made! Everyone loved it and I got cudos for "slaving over a hot stove"!

I've always loved eggplant, but I didn't make it often until I found this wonderful recipe!  I add garlic powder, oregano and rosemary for extra flavor.  Thanks so much for sharing!

WOW! This is the only baked eggplant recipe my husband has ever liked. He always asks for fried eggplant. He loved this and said I can make it often, and instead of fried.   I switched it up a bit: - mixed chopped garlic, oregano and parmesan with the mayo - after dipping in the bread crumbs, I sprayed with olive oil for a crisp crust and added a dash of cayenne - Be sure to finish under the broiler for crunchiness  Serving with a sauce is optional - I liked the crispness, and my husband liked it with a swoosh of low fat alfredo sauce. Next time I'll try it with a medley of sauces - all on the side: pesto, red sauce, and alfredo. Enjoy!

I had a large eggplant, so I made half of it according to the directions and the other half with some modifications of my own. The half that matched the directions exactly came out very good but without the crispness the I like in the breadcrumbs. The half that I modified used egg instead of mayo and included a sprinkle of olive oil on top during the last 5 minutes of cooking. This half had the crispness that I prefer on the crust. All in all, very easy to make and enjoyed by all. Thanks for this simple yet yummy recipe.

Tasty. To avoid bitterness, I salted the sliced eggplant, let it sit in a colander for an hour, then rinsed & patted dry before coating it with the mayo/breadcrumb mixture.

This is a very tasty and HEALTHY alternative!  I recommend using Light Miracle Whip mixed with some Eggbeaters and coating with Panko bread crumbs seasoned with Italian seasoning and grated parm/romano cheeses. Then bake in oven as directed with maybe a minute of broiler time for a crispier finish.  Put on a dollop of Barilla marinara and some extra grated cheese and serve!  A hearty antipasto salad will complete this HEALTHY and satisfying meal!  Thanks for a great start!

I have been making this recipe for years, I replace the bread crumbs with parmesean cheese seasoned with garlic powder and paprika making this recipe low carb. I use this eggplant instead of breaded when I make make my low carb eggplant parmesean. it is very delicious.

Let me first start by saying I hate cooking!  But sometimes my husband goes away for work so I need to fend for myself.  I thought this would be easy and let me say...........It was!  And it was GREAT!  After I baked it, I took some sauce and poured it over the eggplant and then put some cheese on top and baked it again for 15 minutes.  It was so good I was sad I was eating it alone!  I will totally make this again!  As a vegetarian it's nice to have something different!  Made it with some green beans and had a yummy meal, alone :(  :P

My first attempt at eggplant and I loved it! I did use Ranch salad dressing instead of mayo because we were out and it still turned out!  I did the same thing the next night with green beans, just baked them for a shorter period of time and they were yummy too!

OMG...I just made this and it was so good that I will make it all the time! I have only liked fried eggplant up to now and have never liked it any other way! I was out of mayo (we don't use much mayo here) so I used ranch dressing instead aand added garlic powder, parsley and basil. All I had on hand was panko bread crumbs which mmade it very crispy! I drizzled olive oil on the pan and over the top of them and topped them with grated parmesan cheese! They are delish! Thanks for the recipie!

Delicious!!!  I added one thing that another person suggested, I added garlic to the mayo as well as salt and pepper.  These were so good that I ate the whole eggplant in one sitting=)

This definitely was easy and so good!  The breadcrumbs came out crunchy and the mayo made the eggplant flavorful and juicy.  I topped mine with melted mozzarella.  VERY good!  Perfect as a side with any Italian dish.  It didn't reheat very well though (just gives us an excuse to eat it all the night I make it!).

I took some other reviewers advice:  crushed a garlic clove into the mayo and added some parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs.   Sprinkled some extra parmesan on top as a garnish.  This was heavenly!  My husband said it seemed like it was deep fried and reminded him of deep fried zucchini.   Super easy recipe!

I made this with a couple tablespoons of grated parmesan added to the breadcrumbs, then topped with canned spagetti sauce and mozzarella cheese.  Fifteen minutes in the oven produced some great eggplant parmesan.  So much less fattening than frying the eggplant.

i had yet to find an eggplant i didn't like...until last night.  while this is barely edible (that's why i gave it 2 stars), the coating is very dry and flavorless and has the consistancy of sawdust.  the thought of accidently sneezing was unnerving.  i even added parmesan to the top with no new palatable results.

My Mom's a big eggplant lover so I wanted to find a recipe that she might like. I reduce the bread crumbs to 1/4, added cornmeal parmesan and a few more spices. It smelled wonderful but the eggplant was a little dry. Next time I might let the eggplant marinate for a few hours before I bread and bake it. I forgot to add that I marinated it in Italian Dressing instead of mayo.

I am not a big fan of eggplant, but I had some leftover that I used in a centerpiece and hated for them to go to waste.  My family loved this recipe!  Even my 5 year old that eats NO vegetables ate it without complaint.  The only thing I would add is some garlic to the breadcrumbs to impart more flavor without having to add any sauce.  Great recipe.

My husband and I absolutely love eggplant, and we have tried many great eggplant recipes over the years, but this one was an absolute dud!  I read all the reviews, added garlic salt and parmesan to the bread crumbs, and it was a royal mess on the aluminum foil on the cookie sheet.  As it baked all of the coating stuck to the foil and did not stick with the eggplant.  Needless to say, we ended up with tasteless, soggy eggplant.

this was good, and super easy to make. I liked that it called for mayo, instead of eggs or milk (I had none).  I spcied up the mayo with some parm cheese, garlic, pepper, italian seasoning and cayenne pepper.

I used light sour cream instead of mayonnaise.  I sliced it very thinly.  I really liked the flavor and I liked the thinnest slices the best because they tasted like chips!

this recipe turned out ok. i used miracle whip with some minced garlic mixed in because i dislike mayonnaise so much! healthier than the fried version, but still quite tasty! and it all comes out warm at the same time instead of frying some and having to eat them right away and then frying another batch, eating, and so on. would prepare again.

I was skeptical about eating eggplant, but my husband and I LOVED this recipe!  It was moist, simple, and delicious.  We followed the recipe but added some fresh rosemarry and a little garlic salt.  Yum!  Also, eggplant has only 20 calories in a cup, can't beat that!

Loved it! Very easy to make and very good, soft inside and crunchy outside. I soaked my eggplant first in salt water and I used Panko bread crumbs. I will make this again.

Made this tonight, only change was MW instead of mayo. Was okay, but a little bland. I also put parmesan cheese in with the bread crumbs. I used Italian seasoning bread crumbs too. Some garlic pepped it up, I think that one thing I did wrong with it was slicing it too thin. I will make again, but make some changes to make it less bland.

I thought this was tasty although the bread crumbs did overpower the eggplant a little. Next time I'll cut my slices thicker. 

With the leftovers the next day I sprinkled on a little mozzarella, heated them up and topped them with some chopped Roma tomato and fresh basil-made a lovely and easy lunch.

This was easy and tasty.  The pieces don't get soggy or limp as they cool, like they do if they are fried. I used crushed Ritz crackers as my seasoned bread crumbs.

These are soooo good!  I used a bit of Cavender's Greek seasoning and 1/4 cup of parmesean cheese in the bread crumb mixture before dipping the eggplant slices.  I didn' t think they would be crunchy but they were awesome!

Holy cow!  This was so good!  I used 1/2 packet of something like shake and bake for my seasoned bread crumbs.  I thought this made it taste wonderful.  My kids loved it.  I think that using real mayo is key.  I also put some olive oil on the bottom of my pan and flipped the eggplant in the middle of cooking.  I already bought several more eggplant to cook this way and have plans to put some in my garden for next year.  Thank you!!!

These were just "ok" for me, nothing spectacular.  It was more of the breading and mayo than the eggplant, which I didn't care for.  I wanted it to be more about the eggplant.

Very easy and good!

I peeled, and sliced the eggplants and then used Italian Style breadcrumbs and mixed in garlic salt, pepper and Parmesan cheese. I used light mayonnaise and used a pastry brush to lightly brush on the mayonnaise since we're not big mayo fans. I used as little as possible.

After coating in the breadcrumb mixture I sprayed the eggplant with a little bit of olive oil Pam to help the browning and crispiness. I then added some Parmesan cheese to the top after pulling out of the oven.

Even my mother in law who hates vegetables loved this.

My family is new to Eggplant, my husband and i loved this recipe but my 2 youngest not so much.  I made my own breadcrumbs so I could add spices that I wanted.  And toped the eggplant with mozzarella cheese for the last 5 min cooking. YUM!  Tasted like perfectly cooked mushrooms almost. I will definetly make this again for me and my husband.

Very good!  I agree with the other reviewers that the breadcrumbs could use some more flavor (next time I will try garlic powder, salt & pepper, Italian seasoning...).  I didn't bother peeling the eggplant, so it was even easier and it came out just fine.

This was a great recipe, but I did add garlic salt, pepper, and grated parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs so it would have more flavor. This is also a great recipe for tofu. Use the extra-firm tofu sliced 1/4 inch thin and bake it along with the eggplant. It was a good, easy vegetarian supper.

Love it.  Simple, tasty, versitile.  I always have plain breadcrumbs around and add whatever spices I want.  This time I used Italian seasoning.  In the future, I'm going to try this with some greek seasoning, I'll add parmesean, I'll spice it up with some SouthWest flavors.  I can change it up to be the perfect accompanyment to whatever style of food I happen to be making that day.  Thanks so much for such a simple, tasty way to make eggplant.

This recipe was ok.  It was very quick and super easy, but I felt that the dish overall was kind of blah.  There wasn't much flavor, and it seemed like it needed something else.  This would probably be great as like an appetizer with some marinara sauce.

This recipe is fabulous.  It was much more than I expected.  I did mix in ranch dressing with the mayo and included a lot of seasoning in the breadcrumbs but the eggplant is so moist that I would confidently serve it to anyone who says "I do not like eggplant".  Definitely a keeper.

A recipe that taste good, quick,easy,and economical to prepare. To top it off it`s a veggie. I now believe in miracles. Thanks pauline you`re a genius! I suggest combining Miracle Whip and ranch dressing.

I added garlic to the mayo and seasoned the bread crumbs although the original recipe said "seasoned"so for those who thought these were bland, you have to add seasoning to bread to help that. After I had baked one side for 20 and the other for about 10-12, because I was running out of time with company here, I transferred to a baking dish with marinara in it. I put some sliced tomatoes on top, salt & pepper, and some fresh Romana cheese (any cheese would work except cheddar). Baked about 5-10 more minutes and they were a hit! I hate mayo so I was skeptical but I'll make again!

Very simple recipe! I was skeptical about the mayonnaise, thinking it might make the eggplant taste funny but this was Deeeeelicious! It tastes just as good in dishes as a fried version does! I made a huge batch up and we almost didn't have any left for dinner because me and my husband kept stealing pieces! It tastes good even refrigerated! I froze the remainder to see how it would hold up for future meals, so hopefully it will  be just as good!

Altered it with egg and itlain dressing instead of mayo.  Used pako instead of bread crumbs.  After bakiing it, I ran it under the broiler for 4 minutes, giving it extra crunch.  A tomato sauce is imperative for a complete taste treat.

Great recipe. I am gluten intolerant so I used gluten free bread and added feta, basil, sea salt, thyme, and coriander to taste. I also substituted plain greek yogurt in place of mayo. It was fabulous.

I am compelled to rate this recipe, as I have not done this before on this web site. Though the preparation was the easiest that I have encountered with eggplant, this dish is dreadfully bland. I took the suggestions from other reviewers and seasoned the mayo, added additional basil, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper to the seasoned bread crumbs...no luck. 
What I will add is that I did not have panko bread crumbs and, perhaps, this is why it was sort of soggy.

This dish was good but not excellent by any stretch of the imagination. I also added garlic(powder)as another reviewer wrote. In addition, I added salt, pepper, chopped almonds and parmesan. I will experiment more with the idea next time.

First time making eggplant, and I found this very tasty!  Like others suggested, I put garlic powder in the mayo.  Last 5 minutes of cooking I sprinkled fresh parmesan on top.  I think 40 minutes total cooking time was a bit too long as they turned out very soft, so might cook 5-10 minutes less next time.

I first met this recipe years ago using Green Goddess dressing.  Actually, any creamy salad dressing will work...ranch, creamy italian or ceasar.  Also add some grated parmesan to the bread crumbs.  Even my young children liked it and would ask for more "meat!"

SUPER EASY! I cut the slices about 1" thick (per a prior suggestion), salted to remove any bitterness, and let it sit for about an hour before I coated it with breadcrumbs and grated parm.   I baked for 45 minutes on my Pampered Chef bar pan, so it didn't need flipping. Served with spaghetti and marinara sauce and it was quite tasty!

This was so good. I altered the recipe by using the low fat mayo and adding a little dijon mustard to brush on both sides. Also, added parmesan cheese to the bread crumbs.

I loved the idea but I'm not crazy about bread crumbs. So I crushed some Cristie* bacon dipper crackers very fine  and added some parmesan cheese..AWESOME!! My husband and VERY picker kids loved them!! They couldn't believe they were eatting eggplant.

So simple & delicious!  I too used lowfat mayo and added garlic powder, salt, pepper & a bit of finely shredded cheese  to the Panko bread crumbs (I didn't have parm. as others have indicated they added).  I also sprayed the foil lined pan with cooking spray which made flipping them easy.    After baking, I topped each slice with a teaspoon of marinara and sprinkled a bit more shredded cheese on top.  Super yummy - thank you for sharing!!

This was delicious, as advertised.  I made a couple of changes, based on reviews here. Rather than mayonnaise, I used a very light-creamy vinaigrrette.I hoped this would add some flavor. I also used panko, which was what I had in lieu of breadcrumbs.  During baking, I sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top, as suggested by some.  I also sprayed a bit of olive oil while baking, to crisp them up.Easy.  Tasty.  Crispy on the outside, moist and eggplanty on the inside!

Added garlic powder & parm cheese to crumbs. Mixed plain crumbs and panko. It was really good. I don't think I baked for as long, but did raise the temp to 400 near the end.

I did what many others had done - spiced it up abit - and also went one step further in making the meal into parmigani.  It was delicious!!!  I'm a diabetic - so am hoping I carb counted the eggplant properly.  I will bake up my eggplant like this in future - less oils - and so tasty.

This recipe is wonderful!  It turned out perfectly.  I used low fat mayo and panko breadcrumbs seasoned with garlic and cajun seasoning.  Everyone loved it, and they have already requested that I make it again soon!  We ate these with homemade marinara sauce on the side and sauteed zucchini and onions.  Thank you for a great recipe that we will make over and over!

This is great and super easy.  Eggplant, mayo, SEASONED breadcrumbs.  If you're looking for something "special" you should probably look for something without "easy" in the title.  If you are looking for a quick, easy and yummy way to cook eggplant, this is it.  You can change in a myriad of ways by adding to the breadcrumbs or the mayo.

Well it WAS easy, but it was pretty boring when it came time to eat it. Just not much to it. We added spaghetti sauce and that worked well, like an eggplant parmesean.

I have done "oven-fried" eggplant for years, but I dip the eggplant in an eggwash, then into the bread crumbs.  I then spray the eggplant just before baking with olive oil which crisps it up.  You can then turn these into mini pizzas by topping with chopped tomato and mozarella and basil.  Yummy

The first time I made this, it didn't turn out at all.  I'm not sure what I did, though it may be that I used the seedy part of the eggplant so it was really mushy.  I fried the leftovers in oil and put them on a bun that I had topped with parmesan cheese and broiled.  I added a piece of fried ham to the sandwich.  The tweak worked, they were much better!

this is by far my favorite way to prepare eggplant.  I could eat way too many when they are prepared this way.  I enjoy them simply as is right out of the oven.

Really good! I used regular mayo and added 2 cloves of garlic to the mayonaise.  I thought it might be too much garlic, but it tasted great!  I'll definitely make this again.

I do not like eggplant at all, but i decided to try this recipe thinking that all vegetable must taste good its just depends on how they are cooked.  Well i'm glad I gave it a try, this is the first time I've been able to eat eggplant with out making a face.  Today I'm eating the left over as I write this, and i've made it into a sandwhich with more mayo and ketchup on the bread and I put a slice of swiss on it.  I have to say its pretty good.

This eggplant is AWESOME!! It is so crunchy on the outside, and tender inside. Even my husband LOVES it and he usually shudders everytime I bring home an eggplant. This recipe is so easy that I have used it numerous times already!

This is my first review ever. I have struggled over the years with how to make eggplant. I have always liked it but usually tried to fry it like french fries. I grew up in Mississippi, and this was how we did it. I try to eat healthy and felt that was not a great option. It sometimes turned out soggy, too. I tried this recipe putting a little bit of minced garlic and oregano in the low fat mayonnaise and added some Parmesan cheese to the Panko Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I cut the egg plant slices about an inch thick. This was the best eggplant ever! It was soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. I also broiled it for a couple of minutes at the end to make it crispy.  My husband also loved it. He put some Balsamic Vinegar on it and thought that really enhanced the taste. I was amazed! I would have never thought to use mayonnaise.

This was the first time making eggplant for me. I tried a couple different things cooking just to see, but just as it says in the oven was best! All I had was plain panko, so I seasoned it and the mayo, as well as added parmesan to the mayo! Crunchy and cooked perfectly! I can't wait to have it again!

Delicious! I bumped the temp up to 400 after I flipped them and only cooked for another 15 minutes, just to make sure they were getting crispy but didn't burn. Whole family loved them, including three little kids!

This recipe was easy. I spiced up the mayonnaise with dill, oregano, thyme and garlic as one reviewer suggested. I sprayed the foil with cooking spray and baked the eggplant as directed. Then I layered the eggplant slices in a casserole dish with spaghetti sauce and shredded mozzarella. Baked at 375 for 35 minutes. It was great, no frying mess to deal with. Even better as leftovers!

I gave this 5 stars b/c it's easy, versatile, and really tastes good.  We love eggplant,  but frying it always is a chore. With this recipe, the result is very similar- without all the hassle.
I sliced my eggplant about 3/4 inch thick. I added garlic powder, paprika, dried Italian spices, and some salt to the mayo.  I added some parmeson to the bread crumbs.  Towards the end of the the baking time, I put a slice of mozarella on top of each eggplant round. Then I served this with spagetti and tomato sauce, and a side salad.  Everyone was very happy.

I made this this evening it was ok.  It was not crispy like I wanted, but that was ok. I did not use foil on the sheet pan I used PAM® I added parmesan cheese to the italian bread crumbs. Maybe Panko crumbs would have been better.  I sprinkled kosher salt on them right from the oven while piping hot.

Yum! My husband and I are not eggplant fans, but I had one sitting around. I tweaked it a bit by using homemade ranch dressing instead of mayonnaise, and Italian seasoned bread crumbs with some Parmesan thrown in. I sprayed the foil with spray oil, and also sprayed the tops of the eggplant before turning it. We loved it!! Thanks Pauline!!

This was easy and delicious! I used panko-style breadcrumbs and added garlic, parsley, oregano, and onion seasoning. Then I sprinkled them with a little bit of Parmesan cheese. Next time, I will try substituting the mayo for Greek yogurt to see if I can achieve a similar taste while being a bit more health conscious.

Mine took longer to cook, probably because I cut them thicker than the recipe.  Tasty and I will do it again.  Added more spices to the breading.

Made this when I had an eggplant I had to use and didn't want to fry it on the stove. It was absolutely light and crispy and so very easy.  I had other ingredients to make delicious sandwiches, with the eggplant I piled fresh mozzarella, fresh grilled red papers, homemade sauce served on fresh Italian bread.  Family loved it and I will be making it again. Does anyone have an easy method for spreading the mayo evenly on the eggplant?

I just made this and I loved it.  I must caution those who may be tempted to add seasoning to the eggplant before the mayo, don't do it.  It is seasoned perfectly with the mayo and seasoned breadcrumbs.  I love this so much I made half the eggplant I had and saved the other half for my husband that I will make him tomorrow.  If I had cooked the whole eggplant, I would have eaten the whole thing.  It is just that good and so easy and crispy from the oven.  I would never fry them to add more oil...  Thanks for sharing and I will make this again!

This was sooo good.  I can't believe such an easy recipe can be so tasty.  I used Italian breadcrumbs and light mayo.  I think the key is having well seasoned breadcrumbs.  I actually seasoned the eggplant after it was breaded and ready to go into the stove.  Tasty!

Very quick and easy.  One of the pest ways I have found of using egg plant without getting it all soggy from boiling or soaked with oil.

The whole family  loves it!!! I am new to cooking egg plant. My number one reason for not cooking this vegetable was that all the recipes seemed to take time in the kitchen, which is not where I prefer to spend my time. I followed the recipe and it was great but I made a slight variation which I am going to list under the name "BBQ egg plant" and it was preferred by my family. Thank you for the great recipe... it will become a regular part of our menu from now on.

Wouldn't make it again.  I love eggplant in almost any incarnation, but this one was my least favorite.  I added many spices, I salted it so the bitterness drains out, still really disappointed...

Delicious!  I did make a few changes, although not on purpose.  I didn't read through the instruction so I just threw in the mayo with the Italian style bread crumbs.  Then after reading the instructions I realized I was going to make some revisions.  I used a couple tablespoons of butter and paramesan, garlic, salt and pepper to taste. I spread the mixture on both sides of the eggplant, put it in the panini press for 4+ minutes and presto, easy eggplant!  I added some homemade stewed tomatoes on top and toasted bread on the side.  Thesse changes made for a great, filling meal.

Did not like this at all. They came out of the oven looking beautiful, golden brown, eggplant cooked nicely. But we did not care for the flavor of the coating.

Turned out the way it was supposed to. I don't care for much mayonnaise so this recipe really wasn't for me. It was also very oily.

This was so good. Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out brilliant. I had some slices leftover in the fridge. Put them on parchment paper (or foil), placed some shredded 4 cheese Italian blend on top and a slice of tomato and baked them at 450°F for 10 mins. So good. You could use shredded mozzarella or cheese of your choice. Fresh summer tomatoes are the best. Thanks for a fabulous recipe - and this from someone not fond of eggplant.

This is great.  I just olve it with the eggplant and tonight I also tried it using Zucchini and Panko crumbs.  Easy and it was good, too.  When doing the zucchini I found I liked the slices thin and cooked quite brown.  You can add your own seasonings to this and make it just as spicey as you choose.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out mushy on the inside and wasn't too impressed with the breading/mayo mixture on the outside. I think I'll stick to good old frying with flour & egg/milk mixture from now on. I was so disappointed because this is definitely less mess than frying but lacks texture and taste.

I was expecting so much more! I also drizzled with bals vinegar, added parm cheese, then even baked with sauce and cheese after it was complete.  I really wanted this recipe to be good, but it was very "eggplanty."

Absolutely delicious!  Even my husband enjoyed them, and he's not usually a fan of eggplant because of it's notoriously mushy consistence.

This is a simple base recipe, but I didn't enjoy eating the end result by itself. This dish is screaming for an accompanying dip or sauce, such as marinara.

This was just okay for me.  I think next time, I will just use egg white and breadcrumbs and bake the same way.  Spreading the mayo was a little time consuming and not really worth the effort in my opinion.

I didn't want to fry my eggplant and this recipe, with a little help, was great!  Added Parm and italian seasoning to the breadcrumbs.  Baked and topped with mozz and a spoonful of diced tomatoes.  Excellent alternative to fried!

I spread olive oil mayo with a pastry brush and used whole wheat bread crumbs I seasoned with oregano and basil. They came out crispy and delicious! Perfect as an appetizer or with hummus.

This was really good as a side dish . .loved the idea of additing a bit of cayenne to the mayo for that extra kick!  But the leftovers were even better!!!  Placed the eggplant slice on a toasted english muffin half, topped it with a slice of tomato, mozzarella cheese and some fresh basil.  Back in the oven to melt the cheese.  Delish!!

I never have luck making eggplant, and hence never really liked it. But I keep trying to make it and am glad I found this recipe. It came out great.  I added a little cayenne peppper to give it some kick and some parmesan cheese.  Yummy. I like that it came out soft, would be great parmesan style too.

I'm not a big fan of mayo but I am a big fan of easy yummy recipes.  I subbed out the mayo based on others comments that it wasn't too flavorful.  I replaced it with some leftover store-bought parmesan pesto dip from a recent party.  I used parmesan bread crumbs and mixed in some italian seasonings.  And based on others' ideas, I topped it with mozarella and broiled until melted for eggplant parmesan.  It was yummy, but it did turn out QUITE MUSHY.  My husband who doesnt like anything too mushy had trouble eating it.  I even cut it in 1" thick slices to try to avoid mushiness.  I might try it again but I don't know if my husband will.

My first time making Eggplant and I was pleasantly surprised. This recipe was super easy and to top it off Yummy. I changed it up a bit. I used plain Panko crumbs added garlic, parsley, parmesan cheese, pinch of salt and pepper. Baked then last 5min added some thinly sliced swiss cheese.

This was actually very tasty...I spiced up the mayo with garlic, salt and pepper and oregano, and added parmesan to the bread crumbs (i only had ranch flavored crumbs in the pantry).  Right out of the oven I sprinkled some shredded cheddar on top and had the eggplant with a garden salad topped with balsamic vinagrette...what I found was that the eggplant dipped in a bit of the vinagrette was the perfect ingredient missing!  Id do this again.

TERRIBLE...really this is the first time I have had to rate a recipe so low. So dissapointed in this recipe and we LOVE eggplants! Fried or broiled eggplants is the only way to go, IMO. It might be salvageable in an eggplant parmesan, but is an embarrasment to the eggplant to serve as is!

This was definately easy to make.  I needed to use leftover sliced eggplant in a hurry. It's not a bad recipe. Personally, I just did not particularly like the combintation of flavors. Maybe if my slices of eggplant were a little thicker or perhaps if i used a different seasoned bread crumbs (i used italian style)I would have enjoyed it more.

Delectable dish! Really really yummy. I added garlic to the mayo and herbs with seasame seeds to the bread crumbs and it was fantastic. 
Best straight from the oven though-it lost some of its crispness waiting.

Needs a little more flavor.  I would suggest pepper, garlic and salt, maybe some Italian seasoning.

This is such a good way to get a  deep-fried taste without all of the fat!  I wanted to make this the other night, but didn't have an eggplant.  So, I cut large flat pieces of zucchini and  used them instead.   Amazing!  My only complaint was that some of  the breading  came off during the baking.   It was still really really good  though!

I have never had eggplant before and decided to try it with this recipe. It was really good! I used roasted garlic bread crumbs and seasoned it with salt and pepper and it came out yummy! The only thing I will say is my seasons and the breadcrumbs I think masked the actual taste of the eggplant. But overall it was great!

I love this recipe! It is sooo easy! The eggplant stays crispy & I either dip it in ranch dressing or add it to a dish of pasta. For a little bit healthier version I use Smart Balance Mayo.

I use Panko breadcrumbs (lighter) and used low fat mayo. I seasoned well. I followed the receipe and it was OK. When I added Tomatoes and Cheese on top it was better. I will use my several other methods of cooking eggplant. And for really low fat eggplant, slice, brine, season and bake 30 - 45 min. Eggplant Chips, Yum.

UPDATED: 10/17/06 I gave this one another try. First I cut the peeled eggplant at a approx. 1 inch thick slices. I sweated the slices in a bowl of brine, (1 tsp. salt) to 1 quart of water overnight. I removed the slices from the water, rinsed them, and carefully dried them between two paper towels. To the mayonnaise I added: 1/4 minced clove of garlic, 1/8 tsp. paprika(to taste), 1/8 tsp. cayanne pepper  (to taste). Instead of bread crumbs, I used corn flake crumbs. After coating the eggplant slices with the mayonnaise mixture,  I gently patted the eggplant so the crumb topping stayed put. After baking (turned once during mid point in time), I chose to sprinkle the top with a mixture of mozzeralla and parmesan cheese, lighly until melted.
After all this work, I can only give this recipe a 2, the taste was still.....meh.

This recipe is easy and delicious. The prep is simple, just a little messy until I figured out that if I stack them,  the mayo can be spread on each side with a knife, and tongs make breading them a snap.

It was good, not super tasty but super easy as titled.  The only things I did different was use my homemade mayo and put 6 cheese Italian blend shredded cheese on top at the end and broiled it the last couple of minutes.  I served it with a Italian meatball on top of every slice.  I think next time I will use marinara to drizzle on the top

I would not make this again. Still boring after I added Italian spices, garlic powder and onion powder. Also put marinara sauce on top with Gruyere cheese and put it under the broiler for a few minutes. Still boring.

I made it exactly as written and it was just OK. I found another recipe on this site for a baked version that tastes more like the traditional. But this works for fast and easy.

I cut the eggplant thinner and those slices in half to fit in the pan and make it easier to flip after baking those first 20 minutes.  If you can find it, use Kraft Fat-Free Mayo (has a red top) - will slice the calories by at least 1/3rd... This is an awesome dish and very simple for someone who has never worked with eggplant before.  Very flavorful and healthy. If you create your own Marinara sauce, you'll save on the sodium.  Use it as a dipping sauce for the baked eggplant slices - yum!!

I salted the eggplant slices and let the extra moisture drain through a strainer for one hour.  I patted the slices dry before applying the wash and crumbs.  It was moist inside and crispy out.  Very good.

Added onion and garlic powder and oregano to the panko crumbs along with grated Parmesan. After flipping them I turned the oven up to 450. This resulted in a nice crispy crust. Pizza sauce and shredded parmesan for the last 5 min. Delicious!

As I love eggplant - had to try this recipe and as I have just gotten an air fryer, thought it would be a great way to check out a new dish and see how crispy it worked. Some changes made were: I didn't peel the egg plant but salted it once it was cut up, left it for about an hour and then patted it dry. I used gluten free bread crumbs, and instead of just mayo I used an egg mixed in with the mayo. Also used a blend of Italian spices  in the bread crumb mixture. I had to adjust the cook time on the air fryer - turned out about 7 minutes each side at 390 but they came out crispy on the outside and tender. Great for an appetizer along with an antipesto dish of tomatoes and cucumbers!

This turned out very well as an accomplishment to pasta with Marinara. I had small baby eggplant which I sliced crosswise into 3/4 inch slices. I added garlic powder to the mayonnaise and seasoned plain Panko breadcrumbs with Italian seasoning, Paprika, salt and pepper. Baked as directed on parchment rather than foil. Was crunchy outside and soft, but not overly mushy inside. I’ll do again.

I had an eggplant I needed to cook and I found this recipe. The reviews indicated to cut the rounds larger and I did. At the end of the cooking, I placed mozzarella with pizza sauce on top.  This was so so good, quick and I did not waste the eggplant. I will cook this again when I am too lazy to make eggplant parmesan.

It is easy, but very dry.  I rescued my eggplant out of the oven and lightly pan fried it to finish the recipe before both sides were brown.  Covered it with marinara sauce and fresh mozzarella.  will go back to original method.  Does anyone have a recipe for really crispy eggplant.  Been looking for that for years.

I used the dairy free mayo. instead of real mayo.  I also only buy plain bread crumbs which I make into seasoned bread crumbs by adding Italian seasoning spice and garlic powder.  This was a great recipe, easy to  make. Just keep in mind it does take a total of  40 minutes in the oven. Thanks Pauline.

What a great and easy eggplant recipe, I don't care all that much for eggplant and needed a recipe without tomatoes (dietary restrictions). But this is so yummy, I added a little Parmesan cheese and just a few red pepper flakes to the breadcrumbs because we like it hot. Also sliced it a little thicker than 1/2 inch.
Husband told me he liked it without me having to ask, and so did I. Might make eggplant more often now, definitely a keeper.

I really wanted to like this. I was skeptical about combining  mayo and eggplant & I was right to be skeptical as this dish was mushy and tasted awful.  All the spices in the world could not help this dish.  I will stick to using eggs instead of mayo.

The mayonaise is what did it for me.   They came out fantastic.  I made 4 baking sheets full of them.    Wonderful recipe & so easy to do.  I brushed them with the mayo dipped & so very good.

It does take time to coat the eggplant pieces properly, but it's worth it. My kids who otherwise turn up their noses at eggplant can't get enough. I like to serve it with a side of marinara sauce for dipping.

I read the reviews and cut one inch slices.  I did use more than 4Tbsps mayonnaise and added garlic powder, oregano, and sprinkled the tops with Parmesan cheese.  It took about 25 minutes per side, but it was delicious and I will make it again!

SO Wonderful.. Made it my meal along with some spaghetti sauce for dipping.  I seasoned panko bread crumbs with Crazy Jane's  Chunky Mixed Up Garlic Seasoning and added about 1/3 cup fresh Parmesan cheese.
 Also had Sririacha Mayo on hand and used that for half the mayo called for.

This was a wonderfully easy side dish. I peeled my eggplant and use blue cheese dressing instead of mayonnaise. I also used Panko crumbs with granulated garlic and Tuscan spices from Costco. I put parm cheese on top after turning  over.

I used Panko breadcrumbs and added parmesan cheese and a little garlic. I put marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese on a few and left the other plain. It was the best eggplant I've made.

Kind of blah. It didn't taste bad - because it didn't have much taste, period.  On the positive side, it would be a good dish to give to fussy eaters and kids who don't generally like vegetables.

I've returned to vegetarianism and always looking for creative main courses. I used my homemade gluten free coating and served I. Pasta sauce with spinach stirred in. My hubby added grilled chicken thighs to his. I will make it again, happily.

Absolutely wonderful! It really reminded me of my mom's fried eggplant but so much healthier. I only baked it for a total of 30 minutes flipping the slices over 1/2 way through. Thanks for sharing!

Very good.  Mom likes. Peel eggplant place on cookie rack.  Salt both sides and sit for 1 hour.  Blot moisture from eggplant and coat with mayo and bread crumbs. Bake as directed.

This was a pretty good base recipe. I used one eggplant following the original recipe, and one eggplant with a few adjustments. The original recipe left a lot to be desired, but is a good base recipe if you're not afraid to add a bit of flare to it. The changes I made for the second eggplant: used salad dressing rather than mayo, mixed a good amount of chopped garlic, ranch seasoning, dried tarragon, pepper and basil into the dressing. These turned out delicious!!

Fantastic for first time eggplant eaters. My 8 yr old didn't care for it but my man enjoyed it. I greased the bottom of my cookie sheet with coconut oil before baking and flipped them half way through. I used organic flax seed mayo and dashed both sides with dill and salt before dipping in crumbs. My crumbs were half Italian, half panko. Fun texture and flavor!

My 9 year old daughter and I loved this recipe.  I used panko bread crumbs and seasoned them with garlic salt, onion powder, oregano, & basil.  We found them crispy on the outside and melt in your mouth on the inside. This was the best egg plant I've had to date.  We made thin slices, maybe a quarter inch at most.  We had 4 egg plant from a food coop and my daughter asked me to make another one again for supper!

I just made this as I wanted something other than eggplant parmesan. I baked them on a cooling rack on top of a baking pan and the outside was crunchy and inside soft. I did add salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the mayo mixture and added couple pinches of French onions, crushed to bread crumbs. I didn't need to flip them since baked on rack. I added grated parmesan, asiago,and romano blend the last 20 minutes.

Based on reading other reviews I did make a few small changes...   added a little minced garlic to low fat mayo, used a non-stick pan sprayed with EVO, added a touch of parsley and oregano and some parmesan cheese to panko bread crumbs, sprayed with a little EVO and then baked as directed.  This was excellent and crispy.  I love fried eggplant but rarely make it, too much oil.  This is great alternative, my hubby also loved it, said it was his favorite of all the ways I've made eggplant.  Will make again and again!  Thanks!!

Fairly simple, although I always end up with mayonnaise on my hands. It's not the quality you would look for in a restaurant, but when roasted properly this comes out delicious nontheless, particularly if you top it with a decent red sauce. It's a good tasting easy 20 minute dinner.

Great recipe.  I didn't have mayo (who doesn't have mayo???) so used the mustard sauce that I did have.  Coated both sides, sprinkled one side with panko bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and topped with shredded parmesan cheese.  Baked at 400 for 15 or so minutes and yummy!  I did cut my eggplant in 1 inch sections.  Wonderful!!

I've been making this dish for over 40 years with one addition: before putting in hot oven sprinkle the top of each round with a good amount of Parmesan Cheese, then put in oven for 20 minutes.  After turning,  do the same but increase the oven temp to 450 degrees and cook until cheese is brown.

This has become one of my families favorites. We dress it up with spinach and cheese (mozzarella, parmesan or asiago)After it is full cooked we top it off and then put it back in the over to melt the cheese. We use two eggplants and there are never any leftovers.

Excellent- I cut my slices an inch thick because I like a meatier slice, and sprayed the tops with a bit of olive oil and put under the broiler for the last 5 minutes of cooking.

I love that it's easy, and I love that it tastes good. I've never liked eggplant before now. This will be a staple for me. Now if I can just find something to substitute the mayo, it would be on my "oh snap it's healthy" list.

Love love loved it. I just cooked it and seasoned my own breadcrumbs. I used balsamic mayo for added taste and did a light spray of olive oil when i flipped the eggplant. Made them crispy and tasty. I will cut them thicker next time. I also did a few with mozzarella and homemade marinara sauce and that too was excellent.

Incredibly easy and so good! I used light mayo and for the breading I used 2/3 seasoned breadcrumbs to 1/3 parmesan.  20mins each side... amazing! I'm thinking if you made the slices thicker this would be a fantastic idea for a vegetarian burger?

I love the ease of this recipe. We had never tried eggplant before. I will now add it to the dinner rotation! I did cook this recipe at a higher temp. 400* I didn't have to a full 20 minutes on the second side.

Use a beaten egg instead of mayonnaise and fry in a bit of cold pressed coconut or olive oil. Yummy!

Soooo good! I salted the slices as others suggested. Also added Parmesan and garlic to the bread crumb mixture. 20 min. on each side and then 10-15 min with a dollop of pasta sauce and a slice of mozzarella and everyone was in heaven!

I made this exactly as described and it was perfect. Using the (vegan) mayonnaise helped the crumbs to stick, and also added extra flavour. Next time I may experiment with using different dressing, but I'm not sure it can be improved. Soft and creamy in the middle, crispy on the outside and full of flavour. I will definitely be making this again.

Good and really easy.  I added some Italian seasoning and garlic salt.  Next time I will add parmesan to the bread crumbs. The only drawback is mine turned out a bit soggy.

Wow! This is amazing! I have had really bad luck cooking eggplant in the past, but this turned out great and was very easy. I used a very thin layer of mayonnaise and cut mine into disks instead of steaks like the recipe suggests.

I had quite an abundance of Lavender Touch eggplant this year (some were even yellow!) and didn't want them going to waste. This recipe caught my eye due to the simplicity; however, I changed it slighly.  Because I was using some yellow eggplant (not sure how ripe they were), I parboiled slices for about 3 mins, drained, then I brushed them with a mixture of mayo and Ranch dressing, shook them in a bag of Shake N' Bake, and baked them for 15 mins @ 350°on 1 side, flipped them and baked again for another 15 mins @ 375°(not sure if flipping was necessary).  Delicious!  I will freeze some in this state for whatever use later on, (i.e, Eggplant Parmesan!) without the fat of frying. This is definitely a keeper!  Thank you, Pauline!

3 or 4 stars....  yes it was easy. Also included italian seasoning and garlic spices, without measuring. Problem was it was too soft, so I didn't like the texture. I didn't want the cheese/tomato thing though.

Delicious!  This came out perfectly, I love that it's baked and not cooked in oil!  We put a generous portion of cheese on the top and our kids ate it with vigor. It cooked up soft, yet it stayed together nicely.  We didn't peel it, and it was still nice and soft.

I thought this was delicious. I'm always looking for simple recipes for dinner when I don't feel like cooking. This is it. It took minutes to prepare. I used italian breadcrumbs. I didn't change anything else and loved it!

Very tasty & easy to prepare. Almost like having chips. I did half with panko and half with regular breadcrumbs, and I found I preferred the breadcrumb version.

Loved it! I added Greek seasoning, Italian herbs, and garlic salt to the mayo and parmesan cheese to panko breadcrumbs. This was only the second time I cooked eggplant, and the consistency and flavor was perfect! I'll definitely make these again.

It was okay- a bit mushy in the middle. The taste was slightly fishy- not sure what that's about. My partner liked it, but it made her tongue numb. Won't make it again.

Made this for a meat-eater who had never tried eggplant and he was pleasantly surprised, helped us finish them off even! I served them over Spaghetti noodles with Marinara sauce, very Eggplant Parmagiana-esque!

Took a very long time to cook.  Otherwise, it tastes good. I was very skeptical about the use of mayo but it was good and you couldn't taste the mayo.  I added sauce and mozzarella cheese after browning the eggplant.

One day we did not have breadcrumbs so I used Almond Meal from Trader Joes.
Was good that way too.

We've made this recipe twice now.  I added italian seasoning and salt to the bread crumbs and served it with a bit of ranch dressing on the plate with it.  ALL of my kids ate it (ages 8,6,4,3,11 mo.)  I would recommend eating it as soon as it comes out of the oven because it tastes much better warm!  We don't eat eggplant much, but this a way we've found we really like!

These were delicious!  I added some grated parmesan/romano cheese to the bread crumbs and I added some crushed garlic to the mayo for some extra flavor.  I baked them in the oven and they turned a beautiful golden color.  We had them with some tricolor rotini and diced tomatoes and it was a huge it!  Thanks!

My husband and I really liked these!  After reading some of the reviews I decided to add a little seasoning to them since just breadcrumbs sounded a little bland.  I added garlic salt and some parmesan cheese and they were very tasty.  Will definitely make again.
