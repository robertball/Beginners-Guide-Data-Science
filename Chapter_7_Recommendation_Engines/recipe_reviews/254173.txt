These made for a nice refreshing treat on a warm summer day.  I made no changes to the recipe, nor did I feel it needs any.  They are creamier than store-bought and much better too!   Thanks for sharing your recipe, tammy74!

Very good. These came out creamy and fudgy, just like I remember pudding pops as a kid.

Thank you!!  Delicious pudding pops!  I haven't had these since I was little and they don't sell them around where I live.  I found this recipe and immediately made them and they were perfect! 
Again Thank you!

So very delicious.  I made recipe exactly as written and rated it according to that.   Even though I gave it a deserving 5 stars I may reduce the sugar a bit just to see if it would be as awesome and may save a few calories.  I will definitely make this again.  My adult granddaughter asked if I'd make these for Thanksgiving dessert and of course I said YES!  They are that good!

Easy to prepare by the kids. In the freezer by 10 and ready for afternoon snacks. They released from the ice pops molds, they have good structure, texture, and flavor. What more could we want?
