While this isn't my personal cocktail of choice, if you are a fan of sweet cocktails w/limited alcohol/punch, this is for you.  This is a spot on simple rendering of a classic slow gin fizz.  I use Diet 7-Up in lieu of club soda.  On a related note, sloe gin stains everything it comes in contact with, so use caution when preparing.
