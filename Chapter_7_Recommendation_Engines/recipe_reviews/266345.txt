This was quite good, but needed a couple of tweaks, I think.  First, it would have been good to double the graham cracker layers, as the single layer wasn't quite enough.  I used 2 cups real whipped cream with about 1/3 cup sugar added, plus 1 tub sugar-free Cool Whip, which turned out about right.  You don't need to make the cream layers very thick.  If you wanted to use all real cream, I think 3 cups would be enough, plus a generous 1/2 cup sugar.  Using all fat-free or sugar-free Cool Whip would definitely lower the calorie count on this.  You end up with 5 layers of whipped cream, 3 or strawberries, and 3 of graham crackers--at least I did.  Would have been hard to get the number of layers suggested in the recipe.  On the top I melted about 1/2 cup white chocolate chips with 1 Tbsp. butter in a plastic bag in microwave.  This didn't work too well, as the butter got too hot and melted through the plastic bag.  So, I'd suggest melting the chips and butter, plus about 1 tbsp. corn syrup in a microwave-safe bowl and then adding the melted mixture to the plastic bag and snipping off the corner to drizzle on top of the dessert.  The chocolate-butter mixture alone was a little too thick to make a pretty "drizzle".   I also finely chopped about 1/4 cup walnuts and sprinkled over all.  Made a nice, cool summer dessert.  Might try again with the changes.
