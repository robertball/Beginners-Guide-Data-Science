Exactly what I was looking for.  I had some left over puff pastry to use up.  I scaled the recipe down to 4.  I didn't do the swiss roll thing though - I rolled the pastry out to a rectangle as best I could and put the filling down one half of the pastry and then folded the empty half of the pastry over the filling and rolled up the three sides to seal.  I also brushed it with milk instead of the egg wash and sprinkled on some sugar before baking.  Yummy.

Very easy and most of my family enjoyed it. Follwed the recipe with the exception of omitting the raisins and using parchment paper instead of greasing the pan. I will definately use a little more sugar next time, double the cinnamon and include the raisins or use dried cranberries. Also, my oven temperature is accurate but at 35 minutes, although a perfect golden brown exterior, the middle of the dough was just a little under-baked.

This was delicious.  Very easy to make. I used Cortland apples and they were fine. I also substituted dried cranberries for the raisins.   I did have trouble rolling out to the stated size, so I made it a bit smaller.  I also used parchment paper to roll out on, this helped a lot to roll with the apple filling.

Great easy recipe to make.  I used the side of my grater to uniformly slice the apples.  I added a few dashes of lemon juice to the apples and about a 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts to the apple mixture.  Finished with a cinnamon glaze after the strudel cooled.  Yummy!

Bad name for anyone searching for a strudel recipe. I thought this might have soup in it! Anyway, this is very good and so quick to put together. I do think it's close to impossible to roll as per the instructions because there seems to be too much filling for the amount of pastry (which I couldn't get to 16x12). Just enclose the filling in the dough, seal and place seam side down on parchment paper.  Next time I will add a bit extra sugar, maybe an equal amount of brown sugar, and add some chopped walnuts.

Excellent! I wanted individual servings, so I cut one pastry sheet into three strips, then filled & rolled up. They came out perfect! I topped with a confectioner's sugar and milk glaze - wonderful!

Great starter recipe! I also added walnuts to mine...this recipe allows you to add whatever else you want to the apple filling w/o any difficulties. Although I did have trouble using the swiss roll method so folded in 1/2 & sealed edges. I also used sugar in the raw to sprinkle on top!

This strudel right here is a real winner.  It is as authentic as anything you could buy at a reputable bakery.  I was proud to take this to a gathering I attended.  It is very impressive and SO delicious.  I changed NOTHING in the recipe.

I usually find strudel to be dry and not sweet enough, but this was great once I doubled (and then some) the sugar.  Granny Smith apples and golden raisins were perfect. My son's pre-K class loved it!

I also used more apples than it called for. Allow 40-50 minutes for your pastry to thaw.

If you want your top to be smooth, be sure not to add apples to the top half of the pastry dough before you roll it up.

I completely changed the recipe. I cooked the apples for ten minutes with chopped pecans and sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar and milk, also some vanilla extract. If you cook the apples first let them cool before you put them on the pastry. It was great and my family loved it. It goes well with vanilla icecream or a glass of cold milk.

Very tasty and easy!  Substituted Craisins for raisins, and it was too tart with granny smiths.  Stick with raisins, or use a different apple I guess!

I have no complaints about this recipe.  I followed the recipe as written and found it to be simple to prepare and really delicious.  I served it warm, with vanilla ice cream.  My partner said he thought it was better than strudel that he ate in Germany.  I can't speak to the authenticity of the recipe, but I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for an easy apple dessert recipe.

Was good and pretty easy to make.  The ends of the pastry didn't cook all the way through.

This is the same recipe I have been using for years. Simple and easy. I slice my apples paper thin, and let them soak in a bit of lemon juice (to keep the color), 1 TB cinnamon, and about 2/3 cup of sugar for at least an hour, or overnight. This really enhanced the juiciness of the apples...it is a trick my Nana taught me when making apple pie. I toss the apples in about 2 TB flour, and I use 3 apples instead of 2 because I like a full strudel. 

Make a glaze with 2 TB butter, 1 cup powdered sugar, and about 2 TB or more as needed. Serve warm with ice cream! Yum!!!

I used this recipe and won 3rd place in the strudel contest at our local Oktoberfest.  It definitely is not authentic-but it tastes decent. I rolled the puff pastry as thin as I could get it.  Authentic strudel does not "poof" it's dough is more like a tender filo.

This was good and easy, but I didn't think it was any exceptional.  I also sprinkled some sugar over the top to give the outside a little crunch.
