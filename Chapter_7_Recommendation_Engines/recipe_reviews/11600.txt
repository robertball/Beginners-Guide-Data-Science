My grandmother emigrated from Sweden in the late 1920s. I have HER mother's recipe. Swedes do not use corn syrup, they use molasses. Americans use corn syrup. Oranges were not common in ordinary Swedish homes in the early 19th century, so skip the orange ingredients. Cut into pig shapes? Must be another American custom. Hearts, stars, ruffle-edged rounds, fir trees, sometimes reindeer are traditional shapes, but especially hearts and stars. And making a small hole off-center to permit hanging on a ribbon on the tree is very traditional.

My husband was raised on Anna's and pepparkakor was one of my two year old's first words.  We eat lots of pepparkakors at our house but this is the first time we have actually made them.  I am afraid I may have made a mistake because these were so good and we are hooked.  I used molasses instead of corn syrup, no orange zest, and I left the dough in the refrigerator for a day before cutting them out.

This recipe made a lot of cookies for me. I didn't roll them out and broke the rules! I rolled them into balls and then flattened with a cookie press dipped in sugar. I baked them for about the same length of time though and they turned out great. My Swedish grandfather might not have approved but everyone at work loved them! Fresh orange juice and fresh zest is key to these cookies.

this recipe is good! i didn't cut my cookies out, instead rolled the dough into a log, chilled it, and then cut it into thin slices to bake. i found the thinner the cookies, the nicer they were.

I love these cookies, they are just like the Orange Thins you can buy from Ikea.  However, the batter is very soft, and is best chilled for several hours before rolling, and is best rolled on a pastry cloth.

This is the exact recipe that was given to me by my Danish grandmother.  She always made these at Christmas, as did my mother.  Now I make them and they are my favorite holiday cookie.  They say Christmas to me in every way.

These are the first cookies I have ever made that weren't a starter at a grocery store.  They are so yummy! I added nutmeg, 1 tbsp. Molasses and subbed light brown sugar for the 1/2 cup white sugar!

I had to reprint the recipe, because mine left the house with one of my guests after I served these for dessert.  I used molasses instead of corn syrup because that's what I had, and it will be my new Christmas cutout recipe.

This is the exact recipe my grandma used -it is also in the "Our Swedish Heritage" section of the 1943 North. Park Covenant Church women's cookbook I inherited.  My recipe calls for syrup - I use maple syrup.  I make them for my Swedish dad, brother and friend each Christmas and they are wonderful!  Make sure your dough has time to chill or they will be impossible to roll out.  I remember trying to make for the first time by myself  when I was 20 something and it was a sticky disaster!

This recipe is easy and much more shortbread-like than what I remember from childhood.  my cookies turned out kind of crispy and soft inside.  I added red and green chocolate "buttons" to the little pepparkokor men I made with this recipe and they made nice additions to the cookies I mailed home.

Best find this Christmas!  I was looking for a homemade version of the Anna's pepparkakor cookies and I'm so glad that I tried this recipe.  The dough smells so wonderful and it was easy to roll out and cut with minimal use of flour. (I think it's easier to handle than the typical sugar cookie dough!)  The finished product tastes delicious and it's perfect for anyone that truly wants the flavor of holiday spices.

This is a nice cookie.  I didn't have the patience to do cutouts with it, so I followed another reviewer's lead to make into logs (one recipe yielded two for me) and chilled then sliced.  Didn't make for the prettiest cookie since I didn't have perfect rolls but it worked.  Reminiscent of a snickerdoodle almost to me in terms of the spices, although not quite.  The dough definitely is too soft for my liking immediately after mixing--chilling definitely seems to help.  I like softer cookies so I cut the bake time down to 6 minutes. Thanks for the recipe.

These cookies are so easy and tasty! I have made them mulitple times. They take an hour tops and they always come out looking great. I didn't have any orange zest so I used orange extract instead. Not sure if it even made a difference, they would have been great without it altogether. I frosted a few of these to make them more appealing to my family, and I bagged a bunch of them up for goodibags as well. A huge hit thanks to a great recipe!

Crisp and delicious! I thought 2 tsp of cloves would be a lot, but these were just great as is. Will definitely add these to my repertoire.

This was a featured recipe today, and since I am in the midst of my very serious seasonal baking, I had to try it.  It was great.  I followed the recipe exactly and they are beautiful and delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My mother was raised in Sweden and would fix these for us every Christmas. She would also leave the dough in the fridge for a day before cooking. These are great dunked in coffee and also milk!

These are delish!  Everytime we have a family gathering now, my mom begs me to "bring the Ikea cookies"!  Sometimes, I replace the corn syrup with maple syrup... adds a bit more of a spicy-sweet tinge.

These could be really good with some tweaking, I think.  My biggest complaint about them is that they are a nightmare to roll out.  I tried without refrigeration and it was a mess.  I put them in the fridge and then the dough was too hard.  Once I got them rolled out, they stuck to the counter, with or without flour down.  I think the temp on this recipe may be a little too high also.  May try again when I have more patience because they do have a nice flavor.

Love this recipe.  My grandmother came from Sweden and we looked forward to the tin of Pepparkakor that came in the mail every December.  I have made my grandmother's recipe many times but the smell of molasses makes me ill so it was not a pleasant experience to make them.  After experimenting with many recipes over the years that use corn syrup rather than molasses I hit upon this one a few years ago and it is now my go-to recipe.   Whereas my grandmother didn't use orange in her recipe my family really enjoys the taste mixed with the spiciness of the cloves, ginger, and cinnamon and I think my Nana would agree.  Can't wait for this batch to be rolled out, cut out and baked!

I only rated it a 4 as I did make a couple of changes. I knew I would not care for the orange flavor so substituted the orange for 1/2 c. sorghum. Also the light corn syrup for sorghum. I refrigerated the dough overnight and they rolled out beautifully. The next time I make them I will definitely add an extra tsp of each spice. Thats a personal preference of mine.

Since I didn't have ginger, I put 3 teaspoons of cinnamon in and 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice (cinnamon, ginger, cloves, nutmeg) in it instead. I also put slightly less orange juice in because I didn't have time to let it sit in the fridge for a while (as comments suggested). They were delicious and I will definitely make them again! I plan to take them to my grandparents house on Christmas. Can't wait to see what my grandpa, who is Swedish and well-versed in the culture, thinks of the taste and authenticity.

Absolutely loved it! i did use molasses instead of corn syrup, and i think the clover was VERY pronounced so i will use a tad bit less next time. This is the closest thing to REAL swedish pepparkakor, they smell amazing too!

I just made these and they turned out perfectly!  The dough was beautiful to work with, not sure why people were having problems.  I didn't refridgerate it first and it wasn't sticky at all.  I did sub molasses for the corn syrup and did 3/4 white sugar and 3/4 brown sugar.  I thought they had good flavor and consistency.  I think next time I will try them true to the original recipie just to see which I actually prefer.  Reminds me of childhood, Thanks!

I substituted the corn syrup for molasses as suggested by The Web Lion. Instead of orange zest, I used the finely-grated zest of one lemon and, instead of OJ, used 2 Tablespoons of lemon juice. Everything else about the recipe is perfect and it is definitely a 'keeper' for future Christmas baking.

This recipe was fantastic, thank you for sharing it! I tried chilling the dough, but found I was able to work with it much easier when it was closer to room temp.  I cut them in the shape of stars and sprinkled some icing sugar on top.  An awesome alternative to gingerbread at Christmas

These are my absolute favourites! What a GREAT recipe! I like to make mine a little thick so that they're chewy.

These taste great! I had the problem of the dough being too sticky even after chilling overnight. I ended up rolling the dough into small balls and flattening between my hands. My husband is hooked! Really tasty dunked in coffee.

These cookies tasted great; it's a nice orangey-clove flavor. I found the dough extremely difficult to roll out, even when chilled. And, the cookies spread when baking so it was difficult to make out the shapes anyway. I ended up just dropping globs on the cookie sheet - no one was the wiser and the great taste was worth the sticky dough.
