The receipe sauce is good for 1/2 batch. I made 2 - 17x12 deep pans with the receipe and just doubled the sauce. Added Mochi crunch.

Easy to make and so yummy. It's always a hit at the office! I use white and brown sugar and substituted the corn syrup for light honey. I also added a little bit of soy sauce.

We make this every Christmas with a few changes. We use a box each of rice, corn & wheat Chex plus a small bag of pretzels. To the sauce, we add about 25 shakes of Tabasco sauce for a little kick plus 1/4th c soy sauce. We also use cashews and peanuts. Everyone loves it. Also since Furikake is hard to find around here we get it on Amazon.

I love this!  It's hard to get local style snacks in the mainland and this just makes me happy.
