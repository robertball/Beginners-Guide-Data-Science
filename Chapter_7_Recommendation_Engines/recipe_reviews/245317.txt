This recipe is good however there are a couple of things I wanted to mention for the next person that comes along to make it. 5 onions to 10 potatoes is overkill in my mind and I like onions. With that being said 2 onions were plenty. I also only used 3 carrots out of personal preference. I wanted the potatoes to be the star. The recipe does not state to do so but you need to peel the onion carrots and potatoes prior to grating. This turned out good and if I were to make again I'd add some herbs.
