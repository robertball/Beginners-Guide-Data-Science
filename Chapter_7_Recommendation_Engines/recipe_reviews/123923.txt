This was an amazing recipe.  Although I am slightly phobic about using yeast, I found that this recipe was incredibly easy and absolutely delicious. I needed to add a half teaspoon of honey to the water to proof the yeast and sifted more powdered sugar on the cookies while still warm.  These are a definite keeper!

This is my favorite cookie for the holidays. Just a little side note. When we used to bake them years ago we had to wash the pan after every batch was baked. Today with parchment paper available to us all, it is a must.

This is an easy and quick yeast recipe.  The dough does not have to rise and is not sticky.  Everyone loves them, however they are not the sweet dough recipe that my Hungarian mother, aunts and grandmother use for nut horns.  I used ground pecans as some of us are allergic to walnuts.  I only used about half the filling that the recipe made.  I used the remaining filling to bake meringues.  Dropped them by spoonfuls onto parchment paper, baked at 200 degrees for 1 hr, turned off the oven and left them til the next morning. Crispy melt in your mouth cookies, a bonus to the nut horns.

Absolutely AMAZING! Made the recipe exactly as written and would not change a thing. They turned out perfectly. This is now my new nut horn recipe! Thanks for posting. :)

I make these exactly the same way, except I refrigerate the dough for 3-24 hours.

Although a good recipe, far too much vanilla is used.  I use no vanilla, but add to the flour the grated rind of most of one lemon.  I add the rest of the lemon rind to the nut mixture.  Also, I do not beat the egg white until stiff, but just enough for it to loosen it.  I do not spread the nut mixture on the triangle, but put a very small dollop in the middle then wrap the pastry up as directed.  If you add too much nut mixture, the cookie will burst.  Add just a little bit.

My family has been baking these for generations, although with slight variations. Instead of nut filling, we use crushed pineapples or cherries inside of them. They are so delicious and remind me of my childhood. I made them for the very first time this past Christmas, for my new family. They tasted just like I remember. Hopefully my daughter will want to carry on our tradition of the Hungarian Horns.
