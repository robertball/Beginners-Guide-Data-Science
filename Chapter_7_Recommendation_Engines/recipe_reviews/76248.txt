Everyone enjoyed the cranberry apple relish at Thanksgiving this year.  I made a mistake and cut up the apples before refrigerating the cranberries for 2-3 hours. To keep the apples from turning brown, I put them in some of the orange concentrate and it really added an orange zing to the flavor of the relish.  This is a wonderful change from the store bought cranberry products.

My family loves this, but I add mandarin orange slices, pineapple tidbits and pecans to make a great cranberry salad.

My family requests this for Thanksgiving and Christmas, every time I make turkey. They prefer this over regular cranberry sauce. Wonderful flavor!

My family was a little leery when I made this the first time but soon were asking for more. It is delicious! I made it for a church dinner and had no leftovers!

I love Cranberries but shy away from the the prepared relishes due to cost. I was surprised how easy this recipe was and How great it turned out. Can't wait to serve it to my family.

This recipe is WAY too sweet.  I want cranberries to taste like cranberries, to have some degree of tartness.  I used less Splenda than the recipe called for but it still overwhelmed any cranberry flavor.

Members of my new husband's extended family remembered this relish a year later as we were planning Thanksgiving dinner, and said "Bring that again!"  It gets rave reviews every time I make it.

I had to throw out one batch that I (foolishly) simmered in a cast-iron pot. It soaked up a strong metallic taste and was quite unpleasant. Stick with non-reactive cookware!

This is the best cranberry relish I've ever tasted.  I took it to my family Thanksgiving dinner and it was all gone at the end of the meal.  I will make this again.

I added orange zest.  It was delicious, Iit saved my thanksgiving.  I had gastric bypass surgery and I cannot tolerate sugar, and regular cranbery sauce devestated Thanksgiving 05.  thanks for the recipe.
