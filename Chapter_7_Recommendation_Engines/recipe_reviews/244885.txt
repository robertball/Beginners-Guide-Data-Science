I made this recipe tonight but made a few changes. I marinated the chicken in balsamic oil salt & pepper. Then I used angel hair pasta because we just like it better. Next time I will add more tomatoes and basil as it just wasn't enough

I made this because I had chicken and a box of spaghetti noodles. Loved it! Very easy to make one thing though I had to stir the spaghetti almost constantly but no problem I also added some chili flakes to the chicken I sautéed to give it a kick and my hubbie loved it! Def. will make again!

This recipe was easy that's for sure with only a few ingredients. However I did make quite a few adjustments. I will say if I made this again I would not do it all in one pot. I had to add more water to cook the pasta and once it did cook I had an issue with it sticking to the bottom. I think I would have rather just boiled and drained it as normal. Also I added garlic and olive oil while cooking and stirred in mozzarella as the cheese (turned into a little more of a caprese pasta). I also marinated the chicken prior to cooking. This recipe is a good springboard to start with but I think it could use a little more flavor and rely a little less on the balsamic.

This isn't good. The mix and balsamic vinegar and the cheese is...awkward. The flavors do not complement each other. I tried it before adding in the cheese and it was ok but with the cheese is just weird. It's easy to make but that's about all the good I can say about it.

This recipe was great. I made a few small changes. I used a veggie barilla pasta which I cooked as normal boiled in water. I set it aside tossed with olive oil to avoid sticking. I then in a separate pan sautéed crushed garlic in olive oil added frozen precooked grilled chicken pieces salt and pepper. Grilled until warmed through. Added balsamic vinegar and tomatoes with a few tablespoons of water. Cooked for 3-4 minutes and added basil sprinkled with fresh Parm. (Didn t have Asiago on hand). Served over the pasta. It was delicious.
