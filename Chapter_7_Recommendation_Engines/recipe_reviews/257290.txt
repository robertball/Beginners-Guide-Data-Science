2 links of sausage is vague. I used 14 ounces of kielbasa and that was perfect. My one recommendation is to use stock instead of the cube and water. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

This was a delicious, comforting soup on a cold rainy night. I used a 16 oz pkg of polish sausage.  It's hearty and filling without being too heavy.  Thank you for this recipe!

Very simple, delicious, and letâ€™s make some more.  I grated fresh nutmeg into the scrumptiousness.  I served the soup with a dollop of fat free sour cream on top And sprinkled fresh cut chives over the top.  Yum!

Turns out as a very hearty dinner which is easily freezable for another time if there is leftover. Recommendations: add a hint of Rosemary and an extra teaspoon of Marjoram for a little more kick in flavor
