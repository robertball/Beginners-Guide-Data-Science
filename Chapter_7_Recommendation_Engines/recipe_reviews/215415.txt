An "okay" pasta side dish but not nearly as good as its sophisticated name would imply.  Genuine truffle butter is intensely flavorful - this, not being the real thing, had little to none of that wonderful truffle flavor.  "Packaged Ravioli Tossed with Zucchini" is not nearly as enticing...

This was good.  I would make it again.  Not over the top insane good, but good.  Hubby liked it kids not so  much.
