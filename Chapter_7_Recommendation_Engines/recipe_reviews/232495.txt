Very good and so easy to make! Do allow these to set in the fridge for at least the time specified, as they get better that way. I wasn't sure how the flavors were gonna go together, but they were great. I decided to only cut my mushrooms in 1/2 because they were on the smaller side. We ate these as is, but they would make a great addition to a salad or on a anti-pasta platter. I will be making these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

The vinegar was overpowering, and the cider flavor just didn't go very well with these ingredients. I will try this with more of a brine next time.

This was perfect! I had tried another recipe earlier but it just didn't have the wow factor. Had sons home for hunting and they are crazy about them. I won't be looking further for a better recipe.

Good recipe! My husband is the pickle fiend in the house, and he did think it needed a bit of sweetness in the mix. I had never pickled mushrooms before and was able to make a nice batch with your recipe, thanks for sharing.

Awesome. Usually a jar of mushrooms like this costs 11$ at the grocery store. These taste even better
