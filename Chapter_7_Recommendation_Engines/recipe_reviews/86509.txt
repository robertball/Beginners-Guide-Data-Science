Oh, my!  This was sooooo good.  I thought the brown sugar sounded a little weird, but it gave the veggies just a slightly sweet carmelized flavor.  I left out the potatoes and added some onion and sliced portabella mushrooms.  I think this would work well on any assortment of veggies you prefer.

I made these for Father's Day along with grilled steak, marinated shrimp from this site, and baked potatoes - and a chocolate chip cake, my DH's favorite.  I had the leftovers the next day on a steak salad, and they were even better.  

I like the fact that this recipe makes enough for two preps, so now I've got an extra one for this weekend.  I plan on making this at least once a week!

I put the vegetables in a zip lock bag with oil and seasoning...works just like shake and bake, and gets everything evenly coated in an instant.  Also, I microwave the sweet potaoes for a minute with a little water to soften them up before grilling to a crisp. I will not grill vegetables any other way.

Made this for my husband and few friends - everyone loved it.  I added mushrooms and a little more red pepper to suit our taste and it was wonderful.

This is the best grilled veggie recipe ever!  I've also used it to broil veggies, including all the ones liststed, plus quartered onions, corn on the cob and acorn squash.  Now, when I get out all of the spices, I triple the recipe and keep the unused mixture in a ziploc baggie (with 1/2 piece of bread to keep brown sugar from compacting) for quick use again later.

Awesome recipe, I make this all the time with varying veggies, usually always including peppers and onions.  Also, you certainly don't have to use the "name brand" seasonings as listed,whatever brand you have works great.  This is one of my favorite summer side dish with a good marinated meat.  mmmmmmm!!

I made this today and it got rave reviews from my husband.  He said I would have to make it all the time from now on.  The only change I made was that I used a mix of basil, oregano and thyme instead of just basil.  The veggies I used were squash, bell pepper and onion.

We added red potato slices and onion to ours. Unfortunately no fresh asparagus, only canned so it came out somewhat mushy. Never had asparagus before, but everyone in my house loved it. Wouldn't recommend trying to grill in a burger basket though - it makes a mess!

This came out somewhat salty for us. I think it would be best to hold off on the season salt until the end or do as WHF said and use something besides garlic salt. maybe granulated, fresh or powdered garlic.

This was delicious! The addition of brown sugar mingles well with the spices and veggies making it a great BBQ side dish. I added new tiny red potatoes.  Next time I will cut the veggies a little bigger.  Everyone loved it including my pug.

i really like this recipe--the seasoning is very versatile and works with just about any vegetable. i especially like it on sweet potatoes, occasionally omitting all the other veggies the recipe calls for. or, even better..to use it on shrimp. sweet, spicy, and delicious!

This is so good - one thing I have to say is that if you love veggies, use the whole package of asparagus! I've never had sweet potatoes on the grill - they absolutely ROCK!! so use more than just one small sweet potato - and you may want to start grilling them about 5 min before the other veggies since they take a bit longer.

I make this almost every week during the summer, especially if I'm entertaining. Everyone loves it, the flavors just work really well together. I've played around with the combination of veggies and you just can't go wrong.

I was skeptical about this recipe because McCormick submitted it.  However, the vegetables are full of flavor.  Surprisingly good.

This was not bad at all, although I seemed to like it more than the rest of my family.
