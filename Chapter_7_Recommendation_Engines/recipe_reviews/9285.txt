This consistently gets rave reviews, even from people who would turn their nose up at any kind of fruitcake.  It has a great taste and a nice texture, without being tough.  I've served it with Creme Anglaise, and I've also soaked it in liquor and brought it to the table aflame in Christmas pudding tradition!  I usually use a mixture of golden and purple raisins, and I substitute pecans for the walnuts.

Fabulous Cake!  It was absolutely wonderful. The only thing I won't do next time is flour the pan - with the generous amount of non-stick cooking spray I used, it wasn't necessary. Definitely a place in my home.

I made this for a New Year's dinner party - it looked pretty made in a bundt pan , unmolded and dusted with powdered sugar. I also made a raspberry sauce and whipped cream to serve with it. This dessert is not very sweet - something I like but may disappoint some. You could compensate by making the raspberry sauce and/or the whipped cream sweeter than you normally would.

This was suprisingly good.  I baked this in an 11x7 snowflake cake pan.  It took close to 1 1/2 hours to cook through.  The cake is sticky to the touch so be careful when transferring to a cake pan.  I served with on Christmas with Brandy Butter found on this site.

Loved it.  This reminded me of a cake my grandmother would have baked.  It was good the first day, but it got better over time.

I soaked the raisins in wine, then used the same wine to make a wine sauce to serve over the top.  Instead of baking, I steamed my pudding cake for about 1/2 hour in antique Jell-o tin molds (they hold just a bit more than a poaching cup does).  Steaming needs to be done in 2 batches (making 12 servings in all).  The pudding cake was fine, but my idea of the wine sauce made it extra sweet!  I am used to very spicy plum puddings, so will add more spices like allspice, ginger, and orange peel next time!

This was okay.  I made it for a Christmas dessert.  Everyone passed on the leftovers.  It was a disappointment.

This was a great Christmas cake.  I followed the recipe exactly, and we heated some rum, poured it on, and set it in fire! Very festive, and delicious as well.

I'm on the fence with this cake; didn't love it, didn't hate it. Some of my friends thought there was too much cinnamon (it didn't bother me) & another thought it would be better if the raisins were chopped to give it a smoother texture. I enjoyed it once, but probably won't make it again.

I baked this cake for a New Years celebration with my in-laws. Everyone loved it! My husband is allergic to nuts, so I left out the walnuts, but everyone loved it! The cake was very moist and it had a unique flavor. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Like another reviewer, I had 2 c. of Italian plum puree to use, so I used that instead of the apple sauce. I also did not use whole wheat flour. I thought it turned out well enough to make it again.  It was very moist and full of flavor.

This was such an easy recipe to make and everyone really liked it. I did increase the nutmeg to a full teaspoon and added 1 tsp each of allspice and ground ginger. Otherwise I made the recipe exactly as written and the cake turned out lovely and moist. I baked it in a bundt pan and it was done after about 50 minutes. I iced the cake with a cream cheese icing flavoured with dark rum and garnished with some raspberries.
