These are amazing! The yield was much higher than what the recipe had said, so I ended up having to bake the first batch of shortbread, allow them to cool briefly, and then do the other batch of crusts. Then I baked half the cheesecakes, waited about an hour before I removed them (carefully) from the pan, and then baked the other half.   I didn't have a shot glass to push the shortbread crusts down, but the key limes I was using were just the right size, and they worked great.  Also, a few hints about the raspberry: Mix the preserves before you start adding them to the cheesecake. They'll be much easier to work with. Also, the cheesecakes look better if you use less raspberry, rather than more. Just a small drop is enough to add color and the raspberry taste.

We love these! Delicious, Fast and Easy. I thought I had shortbread cookies but didn't so I used Chocolate Wafers in place of them. The dark chocolate cookies taste great with the black raspberry preserves. The cheesecakes had been in the oven too long when I realized I had forgotten to swirl the preserves in. I just topped each one with a small spoonful and a fresh raspberry before serving. Delicious. Thanks for sharing!

I made these for a party at work.  Everyone loved them. At least one person described them as  "heaven on a plate." The raspberry compliments the key lime really well.  I made these with regular limes (couldn't find any key limes) and baked them in regular sized muffin cups.  I served them with a dollop of whipped cream, which both tasted good and hid any imperfections in the attractiveness of the raspberry swirl. I don't think you really need quite as much raspberry preserves as the recipe calls for, but other than that it is great as is.

I made the crust for this recipe according to the directions and divided it between 48 mini-muffin tins. The directions are just a little vague as it states it makes 24, but says to use 2 mini-muffin pans. My pans each hold 24. The filling seemed like way too much, so after looking at other mini cheesecake recipes and asking on the RE, I decided to make 2/3 of the filling recipe. That worked out just right. I had fresh raspberries on hand, so I cooked 6 oz with 3/4 cup sugar and 1 TBSP cornstarch. I used this in place of the preserves. Very tasty!

I enjoyed this recipe, but found it to be a little pricey to put together. Tip- Do not over cook! The tops will cave in if you cook these too long. I made these in regular sized muffin tins. I was really picky about my short bread, i only wanted "real" short bread (butter,flour,sugar) not Pecan Sandies with all the weird ingredients. This is what drove up the price of this recipe I think. Sandies would have been much cheaper. Anyways- took me 3 tries to get the cooking time on this one right. In regular muffin tins it took right about 18 Minutes. Good luck!

I used this recipe for my baby shower and it was.... AMAZING!! i loved it and so did my guests. they completely demolished them. Instead of using shortbread cookies, i used cinnamon graham crackers which gave them a little kick and this recipe does not fit mini cupcakes, they fit 24 normal cupcakes.

You can buy key lime juice in a bottle at publix. The restaurant I work in uses the same juice for our Key Lime Pie.

These were incredibly easy and turned out beautifully!  The texture was wonderful and the cheesecakes were just rich enough to be deliciously decadent but you could eat more than 2 bites.  Everyone who tried one LOVED them.  I will be making these very often. Thank you SO much for sharing the recipe it is incredible!

I scaled this recipe down for 6 servings and was able to produce eight cheesecakes from a standard muffin tin which was just what I needed for four people. Unfortunately, I was not able to find decent key limes, so had to substitute regular. I did not, however, increase the amount of juice called for to make up for that, only increasing the zest in both crust and cake by 1/4 tsp each. This resulted in a subtle but pleasing lime essence. It was just perfect. I would make these again, absolutely.

I consider myself a good cook, but not a baker - so making desserts for me are not easy or enjoyable.  This recipe was easy and they were delicious.  As other reviewers noted, there was way too much "batter" leftover.  I made 24 mini cheesecakes and 1 medium sized cheesecake.  So if you just want the mini cheesecakes, definitely cut the recipe at least in 1/2.  The cheesecakes will crack, but I think this is pretty typical for cheesecake.  Also, I used a whole package of shortbread cookies and it was too much.  Used raspberry preserves.  Key limes are "key" to this recipe - they have great flavor - kind of a pain to zest and juice because they are so small, but its well worth the trouble.

I've made a lot of cheesecakes.  This one is just mediocre & can't stand alone.  With the added lime, I think you'd have a really special combination, IF the recipe called for enough, which it doesn't --  Needs more zest, needs more juice.  I wouldn't make it again without increasing both.

This is VERY good! It comes out a bit lumpy, and I beat it in my Kitchenaid for about 7 minutes...I never really got them out. It is a great recipe though, with and without the raspberry! I made a whole cheesecake and baked it at 350 :) Thanks jessica!

Very yummy!!!!!  These have become a staple around my house.  Made them according to the recipe and they were super yummy.  My only complaint is that I wanted more of a lime flavor.  Second time I doubled the lime juice (2/3 cup) and it was perfect for me.  I top mine with a fresh raspberry or blackberry.

Make sure to mix up the raspberry, it will soften and it will be easy to spoon thin lines onto the top of the cheesecake. Take a toothpick to swirl. I disregarded the review that said a tiny bit of raspberry goes a long way and wish I hadn't! As you know when jam/jelly is heated it turns to liquid. If you put too much on there the top turns into a nasty (but tasty!) mess. Better yet, next time I will probably bake them without the raspberry, and then spoon a nice sizable dollop on top after they cool (all of mine had a little well on top where the tops sank down). And perhaps drizzle a little white chocolate on top of that! I think the lime was good but I have a feeling lemon would have been better. I will try with lemon next time. Altogether an excellent recipe though and I will make these again!

These made 48 mini muffins for me.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added a little extra key lime juice and just a touch of the raspberry preserves, more for color than flavor.  The ones with more preserves sunk in around the preserves and didn't look as pretty (but still tasted fabulous!).

Absolutely phenomenal! These are delicious; the perfect summer treat. Made in cupcake tins, they are the perfect dessert proportions, as they are very rich in flavor. My grocery store did not have raspberry preserves, so seedless blackberry did the trick. I highly recommend these easy-to-make cheesecakes to anyone who is a key lime fan!

A delicious and light dessert!  I stock up on Girl Scout Shortbread cookies just for this recipe!  They can be crushed, or for regular-cupcake size cheesecakes, one cookie fits perfectly in the bottom of a cupcake pan, no butter needed. I find key lime juice at Trader Joe's or order online from Kermit's http://www.keylimeshop.com Ever since our family trip to Key West, there's no substitute for the flavor of real key lime juice!

Delicious!  I was confused about the directions - it calls for "mini" muffin pans, but I made "standard" size with no adjustments - yielded 22, and I would have liked to fill them up more than I did.  Very, very tasty - tart with nice sweetness from the jam.  I mixed some of the jam with whipped cream to make a nice lavender-colored frosting.  Received lots of compliments!

I would say the person that could not get the lumps out, the cream cheese was not soft enough & I would think mixing it 7 min. with a large mixer would be WAY TOO LONG.  I know there are 2 size mini muffin pans, one is 12 & one is 24.

The taste and texture was great.  I agree with others that the crust doesn't need the butter.  Next time I will leave it out.

Just a little raspberry is all you need as other reviewers found.  I used simply shortbread for the crust and regular sized cupcake pan/liners.  These are definitely winners.  I wasn't sure about how to tell when they were done so I'll need to keep trying with this one : )

Absolutely loved these little cheesecake gems.  They are the perfect dessert, especially for a dinner party.  I added a little water to my jam and heated it up to make it swirl easier into the cheesecake batter.  I also used graham crumbs instead of shortbread cookies.  The flavor combination was terrific and we had no problems with them coming out of the liners perfectly! Thank you!

This is a great recipe! The quantities are right for 24 regular sized cupcakes; I made 36 mini cupcakes and still needed to bake the rest of the cheesecake mixture in a graham cracker crust I had on hand.  As mini cupcakes, they are wonderful, flavorful and pretty.  The jam may "hide" when you swirl it in, but it rises to the top as the cheesecakes bake.

This is a great recipe! I didn't have key limes, so I added the juice of a quarter of a lemon and some zest too. I did not use paper liners. I just used non-stick spray before cooking, then cooled in the refrigerator overnight.  Then I ran a sharp knife around the egde of each and put them in the freezer for about an hour. They came right out.

These are fabulous!! The flavors blend wonderfully together. They are also incredibly easy to make. Everyone that ate them loved them, even those who don't care for key lime. I'll definitely make them again.

I love this recipe! Made it last night with my mom and tried it this morning...super impressed! These are so delicious. The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because the yield is way more than 24 mini muffins. I think that's a typo...think it would be 24 regular muffin sized cheesecakes.

Easy to make, but all 24 sunk in the middle.  I'm planning on bringing these to our pot luck tomorrow and will fill in the middle with whipped cream and top with a bit of grated lime.  I have had much success making cheesecakes before and am baffled by these.

I love Key Lime so when I was looking for a dessert to serve at a baby shower for my DIL I looked no further than this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was to add an extra bit of Key lime juice.  The recipe is good as it is written.  Thanks for posting.  The cupcake size desserts were the perfect ending to a luncheon of the Tarragon-Dill grilled chicken salad also on this site.

BIG hit with the crowd we entertained.  Nice presentation (used regular red raspbery jam), perfect size serving (used regular sized cupcake liners).  Was a bit of work to squeeze the key limes so I probably won't make too often, but a nice compliment with the Mexican theme we had.  Will make again for special occasions.

These were DELICIOUS!! I got rave reviews from everyone at the Super Bowl party. There was waaaay more batter than I needed, so I ended up making a half cheesecake with the leftovers. I didn't have paper cups in the pan, but they came out just fine. You really need to have two mini cupcake pans to make this work, since they have to chill overnight before you can take them out of the pan. Overall, they're delicious and I'd recommend this recipe!!

These turned out perfect! I used blackberry preserves and made sure to mix it with some water first to make it easier to swirl. I also added slightly more zest and some coconut to the crust. This recipe won my family's dessert competition this year. Everyone loved it. Thank you Jessica!

Put it all in pre-made Graham crust and backed about 10-15 min longer.  Yum!

Made 24 EXCELLENT individual cheesecakes (standard muffin pan, not miniature). Recipe will definitely be made again. For reference, 10 oz package of shortbread cookies makes 2 cups ground crumbs.

Decadent little morsels!  Lots of work and need to be made ahead for the day you serve them, which I hadn't taken into the mix.  I was only making tartlets so I got away with putting them in the freezer for an hour before taking them out of the muffin tray and making the rest of the batch.  Everyone loved them!

Made this a few times and it's always a hit! I use seedless blackberry  preserves instead of raspberry .  I make 24 cupcake sized cheesecakes or one 9" cheesecake and modify the cooking times according to other recipes I look up (and I forgot short term memory issues sorry) I've also added a bit of crushed pecan to the shortbread. Only about 1/4 cup  or you can use your favorite  nut. Cashews I bet would be awesome with this also!
