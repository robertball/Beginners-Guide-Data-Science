This is the best recipe for butternut squash soup ever! It was a huge hit everyone loved it. The only change I made was to add about 2 tablespoons of fresh grated ginger.  Amazing!

This will be a staple in my house! I made it with pumpkin instead of butternut squash, and I added 2 tablespoons of peanut butter. It was fantastic.

Let you in on a little secret I discovered while making this soup....if you did nothing but follow the first 3 steps of this recipe, you would have a delicious side dish of butternut squash to serve with any meat.  When I tasted the squash after coming out of the oven, I could have stopped right then and there!!  But...I wanted to try this soup in it's entirety and so glad I did.  We loved it.  Except for adding some ginger and allspice I kept every thing else the same.  Thanks so much, Mint and Mangos, for a great soup/side dish (2 in 1) recipe!!

I did this in my electric pressure cooker. I first peeled and removed the seeds from the butternut squash and quartered it. I cooked it in 1 cup of chicken broth for 12 minutes and allowed to naturally release pressure.While it was doing this I sauted the onion in a frying pan with 2 tsp of butter for 3 minutes added the curry powder and continued for 1 minute then added a can of lite coconut milk and brought this to a simmer.I then added the contents of the frying pan to my pressure cooker containing the squash,added another cup of chicken broth as well as the seasonings and turned on my pressure cookerfor another 2 minutes and allowed it to naturally release pressure when the time was up.I chose not to blend it and it was delicious!!

Easy to make and delicious exactly as written (except that where I live, coconut milk comes in 14 oz cans).  The immersion blender made it a nice, smooth texture.

I thought it was really good....I added a 1/2 tsp cayenne and it brought it up to just the right level of heat, but my wife said I could have left it out.  I even got some pepitos for garnish.

This is a great dairy free recipe. It had plenty of flavor. I used chicken stock vs. vegetable and you couldn't tell the difference. I would definitely make this again!!

I baked a red Kuri squash and pureed it before I sautéed  onion, garlic, 1 chopped apple, 1 celery, thai yellow curry paste (about 1/4 cup) and 3/4 t of pumpkin pie spice and 1/4 t cayenne and a few grinds of black pepper.  Added the coconut milk last.  Delicious!

Excellent! I will be making this one over and over again. I didn't roast the butternut squash in the oven, I used the microwave instead since I didn't have an hour and don't feel like there's a big difference in taste. there only actual taste change I made is to add two tablespoons of sugar since I like my squash a little sweet. I love Panera's Autumn Squash soup, but this is even better. I served it with toasted Rosemary bread. So tasty and satisfying.

4.5 Stars. We grow butternut squash and are always looking for new ways to make it. This was great, but I think we added lots of black pepper and ground red pepper to spice it up a little.

Used 3 teaspoon red curry paste instead of yellow curry powder.
I did not add any nutmeg or pumpkin seeds.

Absolutely love this!

Very nice, and easy recipe. I only gave 4 stars, as  I used our leftover Thanksgiving squash, so it was boiled and not roasted.  I think that took away from the flavor, a bit.  (Not the fault of the recipe!)   I did add some fresh ginger and a bit of extra curry to spice it up a bit.

I made it just the way the recipe said. If I did it again I would add some ginger, I think. But I did it because I had lots of squash and wanted to try it that way. My husband didn't like it, but I didn't think he would as he doesn't really like that type of soup.

Super easy and delicious! I used frozen cooked butternut squash instead of baking my own. I put all the spices in at once when I added the squash to the milk mixture.

I love this recipe! I make it pretty often. The coconut milk is great for me since I’m lactose intolerant and the blend of spices is excellent. I also enjoy adding some ginger too.

I didn't have a big enough Butternut Squash, so I added some Red Kabocha Squash.  I pureed it in a Vitamix and this recipe made the most velvety, tasty soup.  I will definitely make again.

This soup is very flavorful and nicely spicy.  I saved a bit of work by using 2 lb of already-chunked butternut squash.  I coated the chunks with the spices/butter indicated in the recipe, and the roasting time was much shorter.  Also, lacking pepitas, we garnished with roasted sunflower seeds, and that was tasty.

This soup was amazing! First time making squash soup. I had an abundance of butternut squash from my garden this year and I am glad I decided to try this recipe! I did not add the extra nutmeg as we are not huge fans of it. I thought the amount in the pumpkin pie spice was perfect. I roasted the squash seeds and put those on top of the soup.  We had spinach, apple, onion and sharp cheddar grilled cheese with it.  Delicious!

Needs to be a bit more spicy. Also, adding  some potato would make it a bit more filling and less sweet.

I used acorn squash and chicken stock, my hubby doesn’t like nutmeg so left that out... it was yummy. The pumpkin seeds really made the dish for me

This is a great recipe.  Can add enhancements as you like, but also good as is.  I even like to add half of an apple!!!  
For a short cut, I buy the already bagged, chopped butternut squash, microwave it, and the soup is done in no time!

I made this vegan and low FODMAP with these changes:
* Coconut oil instead of butter
* Vegetable broth instead of chicken
* No onion
* I added 1/4 C lemon juice
I just roasted my squash whole for an hour, peeled/pureed it with veg broth and tossed everything together in the electric pressure cooker for an hour. YUM!

This is a rich and tasty soup. I chose to pre-microwave the squash for 9 minutes which made it easier to peel, then I followed the recipe adjusting the oven time.

This was very good!  I added some shredded carrots, (from the freezer, needed to use them up).  I also added about 3/4 tsp fresh ginger, pinch each of paprika, coriander and black pepper and a tsp.of red curry paste. Will definitely make it again!

Skipped the butter and salt at the squash baking stage, simply seasoning with the pumpkin seasoning before placing in the oven.  Followed the rest of the recipe entirely and it was excellent - a definite keeper!

This is an interesting tasting soup, quite filling too. I used coconut oil instead of butter. Thank you for the recipe.
