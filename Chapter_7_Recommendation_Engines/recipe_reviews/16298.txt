I don't know what other people are talking about when they say this dish has no flavor---I thought it was fabulous!! The steak was so tender and it smelled amazing while it was cooking. The only changes I made was to use diced tomatoes instead of crushed,and zucchini instead of the pepper, just because that's what I had on hand and they worked perfectly. I served this over egg noodles with grated cheese and even my picky toddler ate some!! Thanks Melissa for a dish I'll be making very frequently!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe!!  It turned out delicious and the beef was melt in your mouth tender (I kept it covered in foil the entire time).  Great over egg noodles and so simple to make.  Will definitely serve this to my crew on a regular basis!

Easy recipe. Great for hectic work days..just stick it in the slow cooker and then enjoy after work..
I added 1 tablespoon of each: italian seasoning, curry. and some salt. I omited the butter. And I also added carrots and green beans half way through cooking. I let it cook in the crockpot for about 6 hours on low.

I used sirloin and was impressed by the tenderness of the meat. As others have noted, the aroma as it is cooking,is wonderful! I thought it was quite flavorful and served it with jasmine rice and freshly baked crusty rolls. It was great!

This was not at all "bland and boring", as was suggested by another reviewer.  In fact, it was very good and easy to prepare.  Additionally, you can further perk it up by adding almost any variety of canned tomato.  Multiple flavors and varities are readily available at the store, so this recipe can be modified easily when you're up for a slight change of flavor.  All in all, I thought it was very good and I'll certainly make it again.

I sat a moment not really knowing if I should post this; I can't say I would make this again, but I'm glad others enjoyed it.  While it did smell delicious while it cooked and the meat was very tender, the dish was just overwhelmingly "tomato".  My family picked through for the beef, and left the rest including the sauce.  They just didn't care for it.  Sorry Melissa, but thank you for posting it.

I made this tonight for my family. It was not a hit. We did not like the texture of the beef (though it was tender) and it was bland. I never leave negative feedback but I followed the recipe exactly and it just wasn't good, even with adding Italian seasoning as one reviewer suggested. Sorry.

This recipe is excellent.  I normally do not change the recipes that I try, but I added 1 tsp. of cumin powder and 2 tbsp. of tomato paste with 1/4 cup of water for extra flavor.  It tastes very similar to a Cuban dish called ropa vieja.

I thought this recipe was "okay"...after reading reviews, I kicked it up a little.  I added mushrooms, some leftover cream of mushroom soup I had sitting in the fridge I needed to use anyway, an extra bay leaf, some garlic and seasoning salt.  I halved the tomatoes (which I kinda wish I wouldn't have b/c there was not much "sauce" when served over egg noodles).  All in all, it had good flavor, just not very exciting...I had some stew meat I needed to cook and was looking for something different, so it was GREAT in that sense ~ Thanks a bunch :)

This was just ok...and I that was with a few modifications.  I thickened the sauce, added celery salt and Montreal Steak spice, and added grated swiss cheese to the top.  I am not quite sure what it would have tasted like without the additional ingredients -- but I would think it would be very bland.  As it was, it was still not a home run.  I'd give it 3.5 but the option isn't there. Not bad, but not great.

Delicious!! Served this over rice. Needed salt, but good to let everyone salt to taste at the table. I did add a can of tomato paste, would probably drain the diced tomatoes next time to have a thicker sauce. 
Thanks for a great recipe! This one is definitely a keeper.

This was a huge hit with my family! Easy and delicious! I did mine in the slow cooker. I normally work nights and have four kids. On this particular day I worked a day shift which is from 11:30am-7/7:30pm. Knowing there was going to be homework and bed shortly after I got home, I knew BBQ'ing my sirloin steak was going to be out of the question. So I made the recipe according to the directions, except I had no bell pepper on hand and no time to run to the store for one, so I improvised a bit using a can of S&W Cuban Recipe Black Beans with onions, peppers (just a tiny hint of spicy) and cumin. And stewed tomatoes, cut up with kitchen scissors, with onion, celery and bell pepper. Sure this recipe called for a lot of onion anyway, but it was not overwhelming of one flavor. On my way home from work I picked up one bell pepper, chopped and sautéed it and threw it in the slow cooker, turned it on Hi and let it bubble for about 15mins. The rice I made in a rice steamer and I added three beef bouillon cubes and some Italian seasoning and let it cook. Served with mini crescent rolls. I DEF got kudos from the family on this meal!! Great, fabulous, FANTASTIC recipe! Thanks for sharing. You saved my butt and made my evening that much more relaxing

My husband loved this recipe although I was not as happy with it as he. I only used a fraction of the butter, perhaps that was the problem.  After tasting it and found something lacking I  added a small amount of Worcestershire sauce to pump up the flavor.

This recipe is a keeper and yummy it is! I just added a pinch of salt and pepper to taste and sprinkle some chopped onion spring. And instead of bell pepper, i used jalapeño peppers to give it a lil spice! Thanks for the recipe!

A couple changes for this: Season the steak with salt and pepper, then sear it on HIGHEST heat before putting in the oven (this will GREATLY improve the texture). A pinch of Thyme does wonders and a sprinkle of grated Romano cheese over the top before serving.

I thought this recipe was a bit bland, but my husband and 7yr. old loved it over egg noodles. I think next time I will add a few more seasonings to the dish. Overall, I would make this again.

Bland, boring and takes to long to prepare and cook.
