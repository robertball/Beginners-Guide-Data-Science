Very nice flavor and easy to make.  We made it in the oven using a meat thermometer to get it to 160 degrees and then tented it to let it sit for about 5 minutes.  Perfectly cooked and great flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

This was good but I used less Molasses (just 1/2 cup) and 1/4 c. Apple Cider Vinegar. I also didn't use 1 c. as a baste. It might be good to marinate it longer than 30 minutes- maybe an hour would be better.  The red pepper flakes made it a little too spicy in places. I will leave that out next time.

This recipe was pretty good. I would definitely suggest using less molasses and less apple cider vinegar. Probably a 1/2 cup of each, it makes a LOT of marinade. Also, try blotting the tenderloin before grilling, because the molasses has a tenancy to burn quickly. I also recommend leaving the pork a little pink in the middle, comes out much more tender and juicy.

Im sorry but I did not like this at all.  It caused a fight between my fiance and I...I thought that it was pretty funny how a Tenderloin could start an argument.

We really liked this...instead of grilling it I baked it on 375 for about 45 mins. in all of the sauce made (I cut the molasses down to 1/2 cup and 1/4 cup vinegar)  I also marinated it in the fridge for 1 1/2 days.  Sweet with a hint of spice at the end!

Made this for my parents this weekend and they absolutely loved it. I used some of the marinade for chicken yesterday and it was really good too.

Tried this marinade.  Put the tenderloin in a vacuum sealed bag with the marinade for about 18hrs.  Then I seared it in a cast iron skillet and put it in the crock pot with a bed of sliced onion, baby carrots and some cut up potatoes.  Added about 1/2 up of the marinade.  Let it go about 3 hours and it was done.  Wonderful flavor
throughout the meat, and veggies.   Will have this again soon.

This marinade does not smell so great, so I was worried, but thankfully this was good!  I didn't have 2 cups of molasses - that's really a lot!  So I used what I had left, which was 3/4 cup, along with 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar and only 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes because my 4 year old won't eat things too hot.  I marinated for about 2 1/2 hours and reserved a 1/2 cup of marindade to baste with.  I'd say you want to marinate as long as possible.  Good flavor.

Well I used strong flavor molasses because that is all I had. Will probley try again with the mild molasses. But I loved the glaze on the pork and it was fork tender and juicy!

I took someone's recommendation for using 1/2 c molasses and 1/2 cider vinegar. It still made a ton of marinade. I marinated my pork for about 24 hours. I thought the flavor was good, but it was missing something.

I followed other people's recommendation and only used 1/2 c of molasses and 1/2 c cider vinegar. I also used less ginger because I'm not a big fan. I marinaded the pork for about 24 hours and didn't baste the tenderloin when I cooked it on the BBQ. I found the molasses taste quite overpowering. It was ok, but I probably won't do this recipe again. You could probably marinade longer than 24 hours.

Tastes good, Molasses is a neat marinade. Be sure to marinade overnight! Hit with the Illuminati.

We loved this recipe, however I neglected to read the reviews before making it.  This does make a large quantity of marinade, although we heated the leftover juice and thickened it to make a sauce for the side.  The marinade does smell strong initially but it had an excellent flavor once grilled!

Made this tonight... Was great. Took advice of others reviewers and halved the recipe. Grilled to 150 degrees... Let rest until 160 degrees. Perfect. Will make again for sure... Will. Use the marinade again as well.

Very good, easy recipe. While visiting the boyfriend's relatives I had to find a grilled pork tenderloin recipe that would be pretty quick. They had all the ingredients besides honey. I subbed a little maple syrup for it. Besides that all of the ingredients stayed the same. I eyeballed the molasses and vinager to what I felt was right for the size loin I had. I don't even know how many times they said it smelled great while cooking, tasted great while eating or how amazing the meal was after we cleaned up. I'm very happy that this recipe confirmed my bf raves about my cooking to the family.

True it doesn't smell all that great but once to taste it, it's fantastic !! I make this at least once a month. It does make a large amount so I use the left over to use on chicken and even steamed Broccoli.

This was a good recipe that didn't really need a lot of changes, but my main complaint is how much of a mess it made which made it difficult to enjoy the food as much with the mess it left in my kitchen. Also wasn't big fan of having to grill the tenderloin so probably won't make this recipe again.

Everyone loved this recipe.  I added more red pepper to spice it up a little.  Thank you.
