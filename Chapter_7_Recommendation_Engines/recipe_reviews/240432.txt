I made this bread and followed the directions and it was very moist.  Not sweet enough for my taste and it was too chocolatey.  I probably won't make it again.

Bread was very good. I didn't have 2 loaf pans so I made the other half in muffins. I did add the nuts and chocolate chips

I made this as muffins and they turned out perfectly.  I finely chopped the walnuts and then mixed in semi-sweet chocolate chips and topped each muffin with this mixture before baking.  Baked at 350*F for 30 minutes.  Muffins were cake-like and had good flavor, texture and were not too sweet.
