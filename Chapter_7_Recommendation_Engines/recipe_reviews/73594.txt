I have made this many times and it always gets rave reviews, with only a few small changes: use half red wine and half balsamic, double the dressing, and cut back a little on the onion (to taste). Definitely let the tortellini marinate overnight so it really soaks up the dressing. I reserve about 1/4 cup of the dressing and drizzle over the salad before serving. Delicious!!

Really good and easy to make in advance.  I made it with balsalmic vinegar as suggested. My husband and I both agreed that more spinach, feta, and the addition of artichoke hearts, cucumbers, and grape tomatoes would make it perfect.  Also, I thought it tasted best just a few hours after marinating.  The pasta got tough by the next day.

ok..maybe I am out of the loop here - but I did not like it.  Perhaps it was the inexpensive pasta I used...I donno..but it was uneaten at my table by everyone.  I even apologized to the hubby and asked him if he wanted a sandwich.  For us  - it was soggy and too vinegary.  Did I goof??  I am not sure...but I do not see what all the fuss is about.

I love all kinds of pasta salad and couldn't stop eating this! It's easy to modify to suit your tastes or the ingredients you have on hand so I basically used this as a jump off point. I didn't include the eggs or spinach. I also used "absolutely fabulous greek/house dressing" instead. Kalamata olives (1/4 cup; sliced), red onion (only 1/4 cup), pasta, and dressing (1/4 cup) were tossed together and allowed to marinate all day. Before serving I mixed in feta (1 1/2 cup), grape tomatoes (1/2 cup; halved) and more dressing (another 1/4+ cup). Make sure to cook your pasta al dente or it will become too soft.

Very Good!  I omitted the eggs (more a time factor) and the parsley.  I did add Balsamic Vinegrette as well, with a pinch of sugar as one rater suggested.  I thought it was too lemony the 1st day, but the author was right...better 2 days later.  Great leftovers!

This has very good flavor. It tended to be a little dry so next time I will make extra dressing. I also added a handful of olives, cut down the spinach to 10 ounces and used only 2 hardboiled eggs. It still made a ton!

This was fantastic even though I omitted the eggs.  I also added a Tbsp. of brown sugar to vinegarette and substituted cilantro in place of parsley to give it a different kick.

Most definitly a "Keeper". After blending the whole salad, (minus eggs and fresh baby spinach) I put in frig to serve the next day.Make sure you double or even triple the salad dressing cause, I added more, and by the next day the "Totellini's absorbed a lot of it.,,So add "more" before serving, then "mix your fresh baby spinach in(doesn't get wilted this way)and THEN put your sliced egg quarters on top. I did add the "grape tomatoes, and depending "on their size", they might need to be "cut in half". This can get expensive to serve to a large crowd, but the "Raves" are worth it!...Stays for a few days (if you have "any left")

I love this recipe!! I added my own little twist on it though, and in my opinion, it's even better this way!!
First, I fried up about 8 peices of bacon until they were quite crispy, crumbled the strips into peices, and added them to the salad. Secondly, I added Burgundy Pearl brand olives in Caesar Parmesean flavor. The bacon and the flavored olives give the salad such a nice kick! On one occasion, I have also added diced cherry tomatoes fresh from the garden when I have them available. I also used a frenh chamapagne vinegar- SO nice! This is the perfect recipe for summer to share with friends and a cool lunchtime salad to keep in the fridge on hot days. Magnificent!

It was good.  Would of been better if the dressing/tortellini was marinated in a small bowl and then poured over the spinach instead of putting the spinach on top of it.  Good flavor combination though.

I do not like just pasta salad, but I LOVE the combination of both! Though I found it unecessary to chill for 2 hours, I put mine in the freezer for 30 minutes, shaking it every once in a while to insure it did not actually freeze! Could use a wee bit of extra dressing.

It was alright.  For me, the lemon overpowered the other flavors in the dressing.  I usually like tart flavors, but I think this was too much.  I have the ingredients to make it again, think I will try to fiddle with the dressing to make it a bit less tangy.  Looked really nice!

Super duper delicious! As per reviews: doubled the dressing but used 1/4 cup red wine vinegar and 1/4 cup balsamic; used Italian seasoning because I don't like oregano; left out eggs because I felt it's superfluous with the tortellini; added grape tomatoes and cucumber to get the Greek salad feel and let the tortellini soak in the dressing for a few hours before serving. It was a side dish that stole the spotlight!

This was a great simple side for a warm summer day.  I followed the recipe as is, though I did use slightly less olive oil) and both DH and I enjoyed it.  I did leave out the egg per personal taste (and because I'm lazy).  I was little worried about the lemon as I'm not a big citrus fan, but it works well w/out an overpowering citrusy taste.  EDIT:  I added some diced zucchini the last time I made this and it is an AWESOME addition.  This salad gets even tastier the longer the flavors meld.

I modified this recipe a bit and it was still so good that my family began eating it before I was done adding the ingredients.  I omitted the parsley and red onion and added about a half cup of snipped up sundried tomatoes to the oil and tortellini mixture..Next time, I'll add greek olives as well..

Super salad! (I did omit the boiled eggs, though.) I think next time I will try it with plain shape pasta. Thanks, Jamie, for a great recipe!

This is an amazing salad Jamie! I added crumbled bacon to the mix, skipped the salt and used white balsamic vinegar. Delicious and thank you so much!

Took this to a potluck yesterday and received many compliments. I used 3 small packages of the Barilla dried 3-cheese tortellini (cooked, of course) and chopped my onion fine. Also balsamic and red wine vinegar, and added some zest to the dressing, but omitted the parsley as it seemed a waste to buy a whole bunch of fresh parsley for only a bit needed -- figured w/the spinach and oregano, it would be "green" enough. Loved the very lemony flavor of the dressing. Also added some black olives and some bottled greek dressing just before serving, as it seemed a bit dry, since I used more tortellini than called for. Very good! Will definitely make this salad again.

My family has been making a recipe like this for years - but has always used Gazebo Room Greek Salad Dressing (available on the east coast or online).  It is always a hit!

This was a great salad! I cut the receipe in half, and it made plenty for 3 people. I definitely recommend using balsamic instead of the red wine vinagrette. I think it will give it a little more of "kick." I will definitely make this again. Thank you!

We love this salad. It makes a perfect side dish to a summer cook out. We don't add the eggs and we usually make it the day before because the longer you wait the better it tastes!

Despite the fact that my wife maintains that spinach does not belong in a Greek salad, I thought it was spectacular (she liked it too). The Greek dressing is classic, and the cheese tortellini adds a fun, interesting touch. Definitely worth the time it takes to boil eggs and cook pasta.

Very different and very nice. It did have a rich taste with so much olive oil however. I will try a different, lighter tasting dressing with this.

Delicious.  I double the marinade, reserving some to toss with the salad at serving time.  I marinade the pasta, red onions, cucumbers, black olives, and artichokes together, and layer the spinach, cherry tomatoes, feta, and chicken on top, and then refrigerate.  Then at serving time, it is a simple matter of tossing the salad with the extra dressing, and adding the eggs around the edge.

Really REALLY good.  I've been trying to find a pasta salad recipe made from scratch without bottled dressing or globs of mayo.  This one is it!  The greek dressing is delicious, and the flavours work perfectly together.  The eggs surprisingly tasted really good with the feta and greek dressing.  My only changes were based on the advise of others:  double dressing, half balsamic/red wine vinegar, and also added some olives and tomatoes.  Thanks!

I tried this for a work party and made a few changes:  added grape tomatoes, imported olives, flavored feta cheese--basil/tomatoe and herb flavor--balsalmic vinegar and the red wine vinegar, scaled down on the olive oil, sprinkled some Italian herb seasoning, a bit of fresh garlic. Bought the three-cheese tortellini and cooked it. Be sure and dry the baby spinach thoroughly with paper towels. Otherwise, it gets too soggy. It was a refreshing change. Thanks. Alison

Very tasty and easy to make.  A good alternative to the typical pasta salad.  I like the tangyness of the red wine vinegar.  All of the ingredients work well together.

I thought the salad was a bit dry, as in needing more dressing.  When I make it again, I will double the ingredients for the dressing.  I also added calamara olives and grape tomates for color.  This is a very good salad...with more dressing.

When I was making this I thought OMG this stinks, there is no way I can eat this. 
 As other reviewers said after it marinates it is AMaZING.  I took others comments and used 1/2 red wine vinegar and 1/2 balsamic vinegar, and little bit of sugar.  So so delicious!

Really, really good. We take turns bringing Monday lunch to the office and we have 2 vegetarians in the group. It can be difficult to bring something portable, that can be made ahead and filling. This was all three and my co-workers thought it was fantastic.

I made this salad for a wine tasting event & it was well recieved by the people who tasted it.  I did make a few *small* changes: 1) doubled the recipe, but still only used 1 lb of spinach, 1/2 cup onion and about 1.5 cups of feta 2) subbed garlic salt for the regular salt 3) shredded the eggs and just mixed them into the salad.  It has been sitting for 3 days now, and it is REALLY good today.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

This salad is amazing, my husband & I eat as a side or as a meal on several occasions.  I took this to a dinner party this past weekend & everyone raved about it.
Just a few changes: I prefer goat cheese instead of feta & I have added extra veggie depending on what i need to use up.  A KEEPER!

I love this salad recipe. I normally omit the eggs and I use a pesto cheese tortellini which really adds to the overall taste.

Yum! Everyone raved over this salad.  I did do two things differently. One, I added the finely chopped red onion to the dressing and let it marinate with the tortellini. Two, I used a mix of green leaf and red leaf lettuce instead of the spinach. I love spinach but I was in the mood for something different. If you have a Trader Joe's nearby buy the artisan lettuce and their cheese tortellini. Worked out perfect for me.  This was a great recipe for the week after Easter since I had many eggs already cooked.

This tasted good.  However, the first time I made it, the dressing tasted bad.  Then I noticed that my red wine vinegar had expired two months ago.  So, people, check the expiration date on your vinegar!  The next few times I made this dish it turned out fine.  But I added a lot more parsley, more eggs, and left out the feta cheese.  Thanks for sharing!

Great for a potluck.  I used a high end feta greek bottled dressing b/c I was in a hurry but was very good.  Added black olives and skipped the onion.

This recipe was delicious. I took it to a party last night and everyone loved it. I followed some of the other suggestions and used balsamic vinegar. I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent!  My husband doesn't care for tortellini, but I do and always look for ways to sneak it in.  He loved it!  I think I'll throw in some olives when I make it tonight.  It's wonderful!!!!!

Absolutely delcious!   Taking the advice of other folks, I doubled the dressing recipe, and saved half for drizzling on top as needed.  It kept well and made great lunches the next day.  Thank you for sharing, Ali!

This was pretty good and a nice change from a traditional salad. I added olives and homemade croutons for a good crunch.

Wonderful! This is definitely one of my top 10 recipes on the site.
I brought this salad to a 4th of July picnic and everyone loved it. Even the kids! I didn't change much about the dressing beside cutting the oregano to about half the amount (I'm not a fan) and adding more fresh parsley.  I also added grape tomatoes and kalmata olives to the mix
Next time I may try using just one package of torellini,adding more spinach and a few more veggies.

Like others I doubled the dressing, but ended up using only a little extra. I tossed 1 cup with the tortellini and refrigerated it, turning it over with a spatula every 30 minutes for about four hours.  I also cut way back on the spinach leaves, using about 2/3 bag. Used only four eggs and sliced them thin.  Added grape tomatoes, sliced in half.  Added a few tablespoons of the dressing at the end, but adding all would have made it swim in dressing.  Everyone loved it.  We had this as a side dish with crock pot moussaka.

We love this.  I've made it with many variations, and usually without eggs.  I've added mixed beans and green onions a few times without spinach.  You can really play with the basic recipe. Letting it sit in the fridge for a few hours is the key in addition to not overcooking the pasta.(mushy tortellini isn't very palatable)

I made this to go with grilled lemon pepper chicken breasts, and we both thought it was great. The one thing I did change was to leave out the eggs, just because I didn't feel like using any. I agree with other reviewers, this salad does still taste great after a few days in the fridge. I did find it needed a bit more dressing though, as the pasta does absorb a fair bit. I just made a little extra and kept it in the fridge so it could be added as we ate it. Wonderful!

This is awesome. Since I only cook for two, I half the spinich, egg, pasta, and onion. I double the dressing. I marinate the pasta in the dressing for a day. I save the rest of the dressing to top the salad. I also add black olives and tomato. This is a keeper! PS I do add the balsamic vinegar to the dressing like others.

The first time I made this, I definitely needed more dressing once the pasta soaked it all up.  I made additional dressing but changed to vegetable oil on the additional dressing only and it was perfect.  What a wonderful salad!  Thank you.

this salad is super and easy easy easy! i left out the onions (didn't have any) and tossed in a few grape tomatoes i had on hand.  great for summertime, with no A/C at my house i refuse to turn on the oven in summer.  this made a lot of salad but that's ok, i'll eat it up in the next few days. its THAT delish.

I have been asked for this recipe SO many times! The only thing I do differently is I add a couple tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and I don't use eggs and not quite as much spinach. But it is a cookout favorite in my family and neighborhood!

I love this salad.  I have made it several times. I've tried the balsalmic but prefer the red wine vinegar although both are good. The only suggestion I have is reduce the amount of onion; it can be a bit overwhelming. I'm sure veterans would never make this mistake but if there are any novices like me out there, be sure you really chill the tortellini. Once I was in a hurry and mixed the spinach in way too soon. The tortellini wilted the spinach and created a slimy mess!

This is a wonderful dish.  I planned  to use fresh Tortellini but had to settle for the dried instead.  I think the fresh pasta would have made it even better then it was. A fabulous brunch salad for sure!

I prepared this dish for a Father's Day barbecue.   Everyone seemed to have enjoyed it,  and the guys went back for seconds.  I found it to have just a little too much going on.  I will prepare it again upon demand.....maybe adding less dressing.

The flavor of this salad is nice (although I would maybe tone down the onion a bit next time), but there's something strange about the texture of this dish.  I ended up kind of eating the tortellini and spinach separately -- both elements tasted great with the oil/vinegar mixture, but they just didn't work well for me together.

This recipe serves more like 16! Cut in half to serve 6-8. Reserve some dressing if it's too much and add as needed. Add tomatoes and more parsley, oregano, salt and feta. Mix spinach prior to serving so that is doesn't get soggy. Great left overs.

I made this recipe for a potluck, and I knew it was a hit because at the end there was none left! Not only that, but my friend's fiance wanted the recipe, and many others raved to me about how good it was. I will definitely make it again. However, I only used 8 oz. of spinach (one pre-packaged bag). Would definitely recommend.

I halved the recipe, but kept the amount for the dressing the same, to double it.  Used 1 tbsp of dried parsley in place of 2 tbsp of fresh because that's all I had on hand.  Used half the dressing to coat the pasta, then used the other half to pour over when serving.  Unique blend of flavors - they complemented each other well.  Easy to make and deceptively filling for being a salad.  Will make this again!

A few of the flavors did not seem to complement each other very well.  I suppose the cheese in the tortellini might have "contradicted" the feta.  We were also not too keen on the actual dressing.  The vinegar flavor was a bit strong.

Excellent salad!  I added 2 Tbsp of balsamic vinegar to the dressing and let the pasta marinate in it all day.  I also reserved about 1/4 cup of dressing to pour on after I added the spinach.  The dressing is nice and tangy and compliments everything very well.  I have to say that 1 pound of spinach would have been WAY to much for me.  I used about 4 oz and it still made enough to feed the 16 people at my gathering.  Got rave reviews from everyone there!

So good!  I made a few changes.  I caramelized an entire red onion, and added that to the marinating mixture. I left out the eggs, and I added a diced cucumber and pine nuts right before I served it to add some crunch.  This makes A LOT.  I cut the recipe in half because I was only making it for three people, and I had a lot of leftovers and we usually eat a few portions of salad each.  I will make this often!
Update-- still tasted good after being in the fridge a few days.  I just added fresh spinach to it.

This looks beautiful, but the flavor wasn't something that my family liked very much.  The pasta had a slight bitter taste, and would have liked a little sauce to drizzle over the spinach and eggs.

This has become a family favorite after my sister found this recipe on the website! Goes great with a steak and some crusty bread. Last time I made extra dressing and brought the extra to the table for those who wanted more dressing.

What is Greek Salad without fresh garlic?   I added a large clove, minced to the pasta/dressing mixture when I realized something was missing; also fresh ground black pepper.  Some Greek olives would have been a great addition!

I did not like this salad at all. So bitter it made my eyes water. The vinegar and lemon is way too strong. Maybe I did something wrong but won't be making this again and wouldn't recommend it.

I thought the dressing for this salad was a little bland and too olive-oily as someone else mentioned, but I liked the combination of the tortellini and spinach and feta.  I think next time I'll just use bottled Italian dressing and add a little lemon juice.  
Also, I used dried tortellini, which is most definitely not as good as fresh.  I don't recommend it.  And I added cucumbers, as others suggested.
Thanks for a good recipe that I can tweak and make my own. :-)

This is a tough one to review. On the one hand, the spinach/onion/feta combination was, of course, delicious, and the oil/vinegar dressing complimented everything perfectly. However, I made the mistake of using Cheese & Garlic tortelloni made by Barilla - that's all I could get at the store - and they absolutely ruined it. I've never tried them before, and wouldn't recommend them to anyone (I don't know what the other flavors are like). The flavor was just horrible. We ended up picking them out, throwing them away, and topping the salad with a little shaved Parmesan. I shall give the recipe the benefit of the doubt, and give it a 4.

This salad was wonderful!  I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine, didn't include eggs, and substituted Kalamata olives for onion.  Next time I won't add the extra salt because I thought it was already salty enough with the feta cheese.

This was phenomenal!  Husband and daughter don't do tortellini, but you could make this with any sort of pasta.  I really enjoyed the dressing with the spinach.  Very VERY good!

I thought this was good, but next time I would scale back on the olive oil a little bit.  I found the dressing to be just a tad too olive-oily tasting.  But all in all, a good recipe.

A very refreshing, perfect and full salad to serve as a complete meal.  I added some diced cucumber and used balsamic, while omitting the eggs.  Lastly, I threw the red onion in with the mixture to marinate in the refrig.  It was awesome!

I thought this was gonna be great but it was okay at best, for us.  My husband wouldn't eat more than one bowl....apparantly the "texture" bothered him.  Texture wasn't an issue for me, but lack of flavor was .  Won't make again.

The flavor of this is wonderful, and it is a surprisingly filling salad.  My only suggestion is to make a little extra dressing, as the tortellini does soke up most of it while it's chilling in the fridge.  Excellent with french bread.

I just made this for a party and everyone loved it.  I wasnt too much of a fan- I thought it needed more flavor in the dressing.  But my husband ate it the next day and said it was as fresh as when I first made it.

Wait until the last minute to dress this salad, i made the mistake of adding the dressing to early and the spinach was a little soggy. It was good but no one made any comment about it so i would not make again.

This salad is the BEST! I have made it a few times for picnics and everyone loves it.  I use the basic idea of layering salad over the tortellini but I have modified the  dressing to use balsamic vinegar from another recipe allrecipes.com. Thanks for such a GREAT and unique pasta salad idea!

My husband gave it 3 stars, but the rest of us gave it 5.  When I made it, I had a potent red onion, so I didn't put in as much as the recipe called for.  The onion is an important flavor ingredient though, so next time I'd put in at least the amount called for, not matter what my onion was like.  Delicious.

Excellent! I added Marie's Spinach Salad Dressing (with Bacon) to the spinach and that made it even better.

We love this recipe!  I took it to a barbecue last summer and get requests all the time for it.  It does make a LOT - I had to split it into two bowls!

This has become a favorite in my home.  I add fresh tomatoes and toss the hot tortellini with the spinash to wilt it.  The fresh parsley is crucial.

I've used a very similar recipe for a few years now and it is always a hit! If I have no tortellini, I will sometimes use ravioli. Tortellini is better, but the ravioli will do in a pinch. Thanks for sharing!

Loved it!  I used a Good  Seasonings Italian packet for the dressing.  The flavors of egg, spinach and tortellini blend very well.  It also looks nice.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Did this salad for lunch for company today.  Cooked the pasta yesterday so I could marinate overnight, glad I did that, because it made the pasta really delicious.  I doubled the dressing as others suggested, but didn't really need it.  I just used a bit for the overnight pasta, and just a little bit more when I tossed everything together about 1 hr before serving.  I also followed others' suggestions of adding tomatoes and Kalamata olives.  Oh, and I also used fresh mozzerella, since I didn't know if my guests liked feta like me.  Everyone raved about this salad; thanks for posting!

Very easy and delicious recipe.  This is definately a keeper.  It would be perfect to bring to any spring or summer get together.  I prepared it without the egg due to allergies and without the onion. 

The only change I would make would be to leave out the feta cheese on the kid's plates.

I got as far as mixing the sauce and noodles before I realized it need to chill for two hours. I decided to make it the next day and let it sit in the refridgerator until the next day. The salad turned out awesome still. I did add some basalmic vin. before serving.I would also recommend slicing the egg thinly, because it can be overpowering. I ate this the next day for lunch. Yummy!!! Thanks for sharing---

Really delicious summery recipe. Only slight changes I made was I used 16 oz. of tortellini (because that was the size package at the store) and I used dried instead of fresh parsley. I also went with several people's recommendations and did half balsamic and half red wine vinegars. Came out awesome and I will definitely make again!

I believe the problem with this recipe is that dressing recipe is missing Dijon mustard and garlic. It also needs much more olive oil. At the least you could substitute a good bottled Greek dressing instead. Once I corrected the dressing I would rate it a 4.5

This was a nice change for dinner. I did make this a lettuce salad rather than a spinach one due to personal preferences, and I was gutted that I was out of feta. Will make again and definitely add the feta this time around.

Got the thumbs up! I added tomatoes and artichokes (instead of eggs) and served over lettuce.  However, I know mixing spinach in as stated in recipe will bring it up a notch. To keep things from being soggy or saturated, I used only half the marinade at first during refrigeration, then the rest when serving.

We thought this was a good, light, summertime meal. I used dried parsley flakes because I didn't have fresh. I doubled the dressing recipe & kept some in reserve as suggested to apply later with the spinach, which was a good idea as the pasta absorbed the dressing. I cooked the pasta about 1.5 minutes less than called for on the package so it didn't turn into mush when adding the remaining ingredients.  I only used half of the red onions called for which was plenty for us and didn't add the boiled eggs because the salad doesn't need it. We will make this again & I'll probably add additional veggies.

Very good recipe. I made sure to buy a good quality tortellini and added tomatoes and artichoke hearts. Instead of spinach, I used a bag of butter lettuce. My son loved it and I enjoyed it as well.

Very good recipe. I will try balsamic vinegar next time, but this recipe is a keeper. It does make a VERY large amount. So for only two, I will halve the ingredients. I think any greens could be used for the spinach. The cheese tortellini was wonderful! Makes a simple, healthy salad and garlic bread dinner,

OMG!!! A friend of mine made this salad a few times and each occasion I was in Tortellini Salad Heaven... I finally got the recipe and tried it for myself.. I changed it a little by not adding the eggs, and instead of the Red Vinegar I used my favorite salad dressing (Strawberry Vinaigrette), I also added walnuts, dried cranberries, and blue cheese along with the feta cheese... DeeLish!!! Will be making this often in the future.. Thanks

Great recipe.  I did leave out the onions because I am not a fan but it was delicious.  Took it to a tailgating and everyone raved.

I used a mix of spinach and Swiss chard from my garden.  I also used only about half the dressing but that is a personal taste.  I didn't have time to marinate for more than an hour but it still tasted great.  It was better the next day.

I make this all the time and it's always a hit!  The only change I make is adding more garlic and four or so ripe juicy tomatoes.  Great with a crusty bread!

Everyone loves this salad! I used dill instead of parsley and it brings out the Greek flavor so much more!

Great recipe!! You don't need to change a thing! I think fresh lemon juice is important for the flavor and I sub some of the red wine vinegar for some balsamic only because I really like it, but it's definitely not required. My friends request me to make this for parties throughout the summer.... It's a keeper.

This was VERY good.  I mixed up everything but the spinich, because I was afraid it would get soggy.  I ate the leftovers the next day with the spinich in it, and I really liked it slightly softened.  I can't wait to make this again!

This was fantastic! I left out the cheese since some family members don't care for feta, and it was still great.  I would add a little more dressing (especially for the day after left-overs)
