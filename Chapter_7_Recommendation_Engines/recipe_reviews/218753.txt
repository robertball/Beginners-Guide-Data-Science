I didn't like this combination. I cooked it for the allotted cook time, and it was still doughy when we were getting ready to eat.  I put everything back in the oven, cooked for another 18+ minutes - and it still wasn't crispy.  The dough gave the pot pie a flavor that was a little too sweet for my taste.  My husband didn't think it was too bad - I picked the veggies out and ate those.  I think I will probably try a pie crust the next time we attempt to make a pot pie.

I'm new to "cooking" and found this recipe really easy to use. Made a few adjustments as I didn't have everything exactly:

--Didn't have potatoes ready at home, so skipped the spud and just added frozen vegetables with lots of corn. 
--Surprise, surprise, also didn't have veggie broth so used beef broth instead. Added a nice flavor.
--Added Trader Joe's frozen chicken. No longer vegetarian but that's OK too. 
--Skipped the crescent roll tin and opted for the puff pastry sheet, lined a casserole dish (after spraying with olive oil spray) and popped it in for about 30-35 minutes until the top was crispy. 

Great recipe, obviously made a lot of adjustments but was fun to experiment. Highly recommend!

The only thing I wasn't really a fan of in this recipe is the thyme - next batch I'll skip it and add something else.  Otherwise, this is a good recipe to use up those random veggies in your fridge.  I used fresh broccoli and carrots, along with some canned corn I had leftover and frozen cauliflower.  (I sauteed the broccoli and carrots along with the onion and potato mixture to let them cook a bit.)  I also used plain soy milk instead of regular, in an attempt to healthy it up a little.  I will say that I screwed up and added the broth before the flour, but I dumped it all in and it came out just fine!  I also just noticed that I never even saw that I was supposed to add parmesan - I skipped that accidentally and it was still tasty!  Overall a good recipe - I especially like that I can add leftovers and make 'em a quick meal.  Also, as lunch proved today, the leftover pot pie is quite a tasty lunch on a cool autumn day!

Excellent! But I thought that 3 tablespoons of parmesan cheese was not enough. I added a little bit more.

We loved it! i only put half of the thyme leaves salt
and pepper to tast More then recommended
I used 'no chicken chicken' rather then vegetable broth, cut veggies into smaller pisces, used 6ish tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese and 
 1 (8 ounce) can PillsburyÂ® refrigerated butter crescent dinner rolls
