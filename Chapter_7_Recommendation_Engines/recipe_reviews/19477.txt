I used belgium waffle mix and just dipped them in the mix.  this was absolutely incredible!  I really love the sweet breading.  I used cornmeal on a few to see the difference, and the waffle mix was much better by far with its light sweetness.  adds the real "yesss" to this dish.  I've been eating fried oysters for years and never had em' this good.  Thank you sooo much for sharing!

I live in the Chesapeake Bay area and over the years was blessed to have loved ones and friends who fried oysters in season and I got spoiled.  They've all gone now and while I can buy them out I missed the homemade ones.  I saw this recipe and it was so simple I decided to give it a try.  WOW!!  My son and I had a pint last night for supper.  When I saw that Dorsey lives in Salisbury and he used Old Bay in the recipe I was sure he knew his stuff.  Dorsey, many thanks to you and your mom.

This gave me some of the most satisfying fried oysters I've ever had.  And it is so easy.  A huge hit on Valentine's Day.  But, I'll be using this recipe lots.  Thanks.

This fried oyster recipe is by far the best we've tried!  I'm a HUGE oyster fan and try them everywhere I go and these top most of the restaurant versions I've had!  We love that the breading is so light and crispy and it really couldn't be easier to make.  We've used this recipe many times and the oysters always turn out fantastic.  Thank you so much for such a wonderful recipe!

It's simple.. but the flavor and texture is not what I was looking for.  I fried them in hot oil.. but they were mushy at the end.  Probably a corn meal, flour and potatoe flakes mixture would have made them crispy and more to our liking.

Really liked this recipe, takes all the time and mess out of how I usually do it (crackered) and I thought they tasted much better this way. So simple to do and very flavorful.
Thanks so much for sharing, I will use this batter for lots of stuff!!

Sorry folks but on the Crunch Meter I would only give these a 2. They had about the same crispness and texture as a barely browned piece of toast. Maybe it was the levening in the pancake batter. My oil was EXACTLy he right temp and I cooked the oysters to medium brown. I was hoping for something more crunchy, maybe even like a KFC crunchy chicken piece. Eatable but don't put a smile on your face.

The only thing that this batter stuck to is the bottom of my cast iron pot.  Would not ever try this one again, and taking it out of my recipe box.  Thanks for reading.

Excellent recipe! I never would have thought to use pancake mix! I made this with 1/2 pint of oysters so I cut everything in half except the egg. I didn't have "regular" pancake mix so I used whole wheat buttermilk pancake mix. I used a scant 1/4 cup of mix then added a little more, bit by bit until I reached the desired consistency. The whole wheat mix added an extra crunch to the oysters, which was a bit like cornmeal... and very delicious. I added this one to my recipe box & will make it again!

Really good and pretty quick. The taste was a family pleaser. Will do again. Only negative remark is that recipe says to use a skillet. Mine almost burned in the pan. Next time I'll use the deep fryer.

My husband loves fried oysters and wanted them on Christmas Eve, but with everything else I had to do, I dreaded the batter-making and all.  Then I found this recipe!  Wonderful!  He loved the flavor and I loved the convenience.  (Oh, I loved the oysters, too!)  Thank you for such an easy and tasty recipe!

I served these as an appetiser before Thanksgiving dinner.
This recipe was so so easy and tasted great.  The coating was not too thick, but just right and easy to crisp up.  I doubled the recipe, cooked about 6 at a time and the trick is to add extra oil when it gets too low or too many particles built up in the pan.  I have made fried oysters many times and will only use this recipe from now on.  Thanks

I'm from Virginia, my husband is from NC, and we now live in Seattle, WA (which has some of the best oysters in the country) we have certainly have had our share of fried oysters! This recipe was the easiest I've ever tried and made a very crisp, light and tasty covering for the oyster. It also did not mask the flavor of the oyster but balanced it well with the sweet hint of the pancake mix with the spice of the Old Bay Seasoning. I am always disappointed when cornmeal or cracker batters become so heavy they separate from the oyster. This batter will thrill you as it's so easy- even a first time fryer can do it!

I had a jar of oysters left from Thanksgiving, plus I Love fried oysters! These were Terrific! I added a seasoned flour mixture to panko crumbs. I grow my own Mexican limes and they were the finishing touch on a yummy appy! Thank You Dorsey, I won't soon forget these:)) I'll be sure to buy an extra jar next year too!!

Pretty good. Easy batter to make. I used this for the ones too big to eat raw. The batter made them sweet, but still too dang big to eat once they're fried. Note to self: big oysters need a po' boy bun and some fixin's. I'll let them cook longer next time. I don't think you can easily overcook an oyster. Lots of juice!

I like mine very crispy, so after removing from the batter, I dredged them in a mixture of panko and mashed potato flakes.  Perfect!!

I live in Maryland and have had many fried oysters, good and bad, over the years. I decided to try this recipe, with one of the suggestions from another reviewer. I used Bisquick, and like the idea of the thin batter seasoned with Old Bay and using the oyster liquor rather than draining all that flavor away. To ensure some crispiness, though, I rolled the batter-coated oysters in some panko before putting them in the frying pan. Very pleased with the result - no heavy batter to fall off the oysters, nicely seasoned, good oyster flavor, and just a bit of crunch. I will use this recipe again. Oh, I added some butter to the oil which also helped the flavor.

My husband loves fried oysters and he said this was his favorite batter. Very easy. Will use it next time.

I wish I'd seen Rhonda's review before I wasted a jar of oysters. Verged on tasteless and left mushy oysters that stuck to the fry basket. However, it was simple.

These are the best oysters I have ever made. I had just about given up frying oysters at home until I found this recipe. I often don't have Old Bay, so I use Cholula, which goes perfectly with these oysters. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Total disappointment. They were just mush with no crunch to breading at all. Won't try this again.

I just finished my fried oysters BUT I did an extra step and rolled them in plain flour after taking them out of the batter....turned out so much better than the first batch which I took directly out of the batter and fried, not so good, much better with the extra step.

Great recipe! Turned out perfectly. Lightly fried without losing the integrity of the oyster. Will use this again.

My husband & I thought too much batter clung to the oysters.  I may have done something wrong, but I don't know what.  We'll keep searching for a fried oyster recipe.
