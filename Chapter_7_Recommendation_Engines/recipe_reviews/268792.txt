I made it over spaghetti noodles and it was great!! the only difference was that I ran out of heavy cream (since I had to double the recipe) so it part heavy cream and part half n' half

Loved it! Easy to prepare.   Fattening though.

The sauce was unbelievable!  The cooking method was optional.  I may try it on baked salmon.
