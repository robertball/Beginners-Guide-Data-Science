Fantastic! Made this for Thanksgiving and it was gone in minutes!  I made an Oreo crust using a whole package of cookies and 1/2 c butter.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was great.  I made for an office birthday celebration.  I could not find the chocolate wafer cookies @ my grocery store - so I used prepared chocolate pie crusts instead.  I added the butter but not the sugar.  This made a nice substitution.

This is SOOO easy!  I used Hershey Bars, but next time I think I'll try Snickers or Heath Bars.  Family and friends loved it!

I was a little suprised when i made this.  It tasted really good, and was really light.  I didn't have any left, and my non-dessert eaters went back for seconds.  I used butterfingers as the candy bar, and this was amazing after a heavy meal.
