These were awesome. I added grated onion for flavor. Next time I’m going to try jalapeño or roasted bell pepper. Big crowd pleaser and filling.

These were a hit in my household.  I only used one large Zucchini and I substituted gluten free flour and italian bread crumbs for my flour mix. 
 I added tumeric and a no salt seasoning as well for flavor.  This recipe is so versatile and it is good to tweak to your own desire.

Made to recipe, and after sampling the first few, I decided it needed sea salt ground atop once removed from pan.  Crushed garlic will be added to my next batch, and some shredded cheddar, because there can never be too much cheese.

I love parmesan on or in just about anything savory.  I used a zucchini about a foot long and that was about right .  They have a lot of moisture so you don't have a whole lot once you drain it.  These were delicious and made great appetizers.  I'll make these again.

Great recipe!  These are delicious.  Just use as much zucchini as you like.  I just "eye ball" it to determine how much to use.  It is not that hard to do.

My husband and I both loved the zucchini pancakes.  I made them twice already. Everyone should try these out. I give them a 5 star rating

Excellent and a big hit as an appetizer at my dinner party. Served them w/ a knock off of Brio's parmesan ranch dipping sauce. The batch size was perfect for four people. We could have eaten more but that would have ruined our appetites!

Honestly, while this recipe looks great, I saw the ingredients and saw the opportunity to adjust it a bit.  I also know from past experience that zucchini fritters often times don’t retain their crunchy surface.  So here are my additions:
I had some broccoli on hand so I added about 1/3 cup grated broccoli.  I thought it would add a nice subtle flavor signature.  I added,  3 cloves of minced garlic and 1 minced red onion to give me a more “savory” flavor.  Then, because I increased the veggies, I became concerned about the batter going far enough.  Therefore, to increase the batter a bit, I added a 2nd egg, 4 tablespoons of corn meal and then 2 tablespoons of stone ground corn grits to ensure the crunchiness post cooling.  I like the interior to be soft w/a crunchy crust.  I also added a about 1/2 tsp of curry. (curry is always a delicious addition to vegetables!)  I did NOT add any salt to the batter as I used fresh grated Romano cheese and ample salt to the zucchini initially to extract the water.
So basically, as I typically do, I used this recipe as a foundation from which to improvise other flavors I’ve come to love other ethnic/regional cuisines.  
They came out FANTASTIC and just as I’d hoped: soft & savory inside, subtle crispy crunch remained outside even after they cooled.  
With my additions, they didn’t need the dipping sauce, so I didn’t bother making it.

Good flavor but did not like the texture.  I think I put in too much cheese and that made it slightly chewy - I was expecting slightly crisp.  I'm sure more experienced cooks would have an easier time with a good outcome.

Mom, Dad, and two teen girls all loved this recipe.  It's pretty flavorless as it is so don't be afraid to add new flavors to fit the meal you're serving.   First time we made it, we served it with sour cream as the recipe was written and the combination is delicious!  This is a keeper!

These were awesome! I added garlic powder, 1/4 minced orange pepper, and replaced parmesan with finely shredded pepper jack. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe needs some help to make it better than just okay. The addition of 1/2 tsp each of Harissa, lemon juice,  and 1/4 tsp onion powder, and garlic powder.

Make a small patty to ensure the ingredient levels are savory. Keeping in mind, parmesan tops the fried patties.

Ensure the oil temp is a minimum of 350 degrees.  Place fried cakes on paper towels. Sprinkle the remaining parmesan upon removal of frying the patties.

The addition of applesauce with the sour cream to top the served patties will round out your taste experience.
