I have made this recipe a few different times.  The first time I made it I thought why not put the salsa on the crust like a regular pizza, but I soon found out why and that is because it makes the crust soggy, then I did it like the recipe says and it was still a little soggy.  Over all the pizza has a wonderful taste.  My daughter does not even like peppers and onions but loves the combination of the recipe and keeps asking me to make it over and over again.  I also like to just make the fajita mix and have it over lettuce with salsa and sour cream.  I would give this recipe five stars.  I hope you all enjoy this pizza just as much as my bunch did.

Filling and delish (and spicy, too)! Only thing I would suggest: simmer the salsa along with the veggies and seasonings in a pan on low heat while the pizza topped with cheese is in the oven. This way the salsa/toppings are warm when you put them on the pizza and serve!  One piece filled my boyfriend and myself up. Very cost effective dinner!
