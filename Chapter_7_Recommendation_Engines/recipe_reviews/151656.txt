This dish is what made my boyfriend REALLY love me when we first started dating... it's one of his favorite things for me to make, and it's so simple! For added flavor, I always sprinkle the chicken with Poultry Seasoning before covering it with the soup mixture, and I add a little bit of garlic powder, paprika and a dash of chili powder to the soup mixture to give it more "oomph". I almost always add shredded cheese to the top before popping it in the oven to give it some nice gooey, cheesiness.  Tastes great with roasted red potatoes!!

This is a great, delicious and easy weeknight recipe.  The only thing I did different from the original recipe was put the chicken in the pan, then poured the soup/milk mixture over it, then I put the prepared stuffing on top of the chicken.  It was great!  There were no leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe!

First off, I'm not sure  I agree with the cooking time.  Cooking at 400 for 30" made my chicken come out rubbery - I'm not sure, but I believe cooking it at 350 for 45" may be a better bet.  For presentation and ease of prep, 4 1/2 stars.  For taste - well, as others have said, not much there.  Very *heavy* meal - need to have a cold salad and/or cranberry sauce available.  My daughter (with 5 children) will love this;  for myself and my husband, well - it'd be fun to play around - I'd like to try with homemade stuffing, a nice homemade sauce or gravy, maybe add some mushrooms, or something - not sure just yet.  Many thanks for idea, though.

This was great!! I followed some of the other reviewers and seasoned the chicken first with poultry seasoning, paprika and garlic powder; put the chicken in the pan first, then the soup and topped with stuffing. I also sauteed some onion and celery and added that to the stuffing (mixed the cubes and the pieces). Also used chicken stock in place of the water and the milk. Cooked at 350 for 40 min. All suggestions of other reviewers. I also made extra stuffing 6 cups instead of 4. Everybody loved it!!! Thanks for this great idea!!

this was a very good, very easy recipe.  made it for the family last night and everyone loved it.  i used stove top stuffing mix which worked out well.  i also used the flash frozen chicken breasts and with those, it took almost an hour to bake.  but, the chicken turned out very moist. i'll make this again.

This has got to be THE most simple dish I've tried so far. All the variations come to mind when I think on making it again. Corn, Green Beans or potatoes seem like good additions. It was so simple and quick. I'll use this again soon!

I am giving this 3 stars because it was quick and easy. My family thought this recipe was very bland and tasted like something out of a can. If I ever make this recipe again I will definitely add more seasonings.

This recipe is definitely one to put together when in a pinch for time. My entire family loves it and it's pretty healthy. We used lower sodium mushroom soup. Definitely recommend it to everyone...

This tasted okay. Not enough flavor for our tastes, but I do appreciate the simplicity of the meal.  It certainly wasn't bad, but I probably won't make it again.  That shouldn't deter someone else from trying it, it just didn't suit our tastes.  Thanks though!

Yum.  I like veggies. So  On top of the stuffing, I put sauted onions,  bell peppers and celery then  put the chicken all over the stuffing and then covered it with that golden mushroom soup.

I made it with three chicken breast and I mixed all the other ingredients (except the paprika) in with the stuffing mix and spooned it over the top of the chicken.  AndI used Cream of Celery instead of mushroom soup.  50 minutes in the oven, and it was amazing.  I cut the chicken into pieces and scooped it out with the stuffing!  Very good!

I enjoyed this with the addition of a few handfuls of dried cranberries.  Those added a lot of flavor to it, otherwise it might have been too bland.  I also added a little more of both the water and the milk since my box of stuffing mix was 5 cups instead of 4.  Very easy and quick to throw together and I was able to clean up while it baked.

Very simple and satisfying dish. I did however use chicken broth in place of water and cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom. Added some poultry seasoning, a can of corn and French fried onions. Delish, my picky 4 year old devoured it. Win win in this house.

This was delicious! I read the reviews and used garlic powder and poultry seasoning on the chicken. I put the chicken in first, seasoned the chicken, topped with sliced provolone. I then added the soup mixture on top of the chicken. I also added about a teaspoon of minced garlic to the soup mixture. I sauteed onions and mushrooms and added to the stuffing mixture. I then added a few pats of butter on top of the stuffing.  Covered and baked at 350 for 40 minutes. Easy and delicious!

Great starter recipe. Only changes were using chicken stock instead of water and chicken thighs instead of breasts. Will definitely make it again.

Easy and tasty. I seasoned the chicken with more spices than the recipe called for like poultry seasoning,  salt, pepper, cayenne pepper along with the paprika.

I found the cooking time may be a problem. I know the recipe says “until done.” My chicken was very cold when I started, it took at least twice again as long. Just a warning, cook to temperature not to time. Always cook this cut of chicken to 160.
Very tasty and easy, I do sauté a little onion and celery to add to the stuffing and prefer stock to water but it’s a classic for a reason.

Everyone in my family loved this.  I am in the process of making it again and to this my family said it's been too long. Very easy and quick.

It was good, wished I seasoned the chicken up more. I did cook @ 350 for 45 mins. as someone else said on here. It is a goos quick and easy meal I have to say.

I already knew looking at the ingredients that is was lacking flavor. I added garlic powder, onion powder,  dried onion, cayenne, paprika,  sage, dried parsley,  pepper, and afew spoonfuls of sour cream to the soup mixture. It turned out great with enough flavor.

I only added cream of chicken soup (large can) and use 1/2 cup milk  and 1/2 cup water  mixed in the soup. I also cubed up the chicken breast put a little oil in the frying pan and cooked it. Then mixed cooked chicken in the soup.

Although I added extra pepper, poultry seasoning and garlic powder to the chicken, this recipe came out very bland. I read other reviews and I baked the chicken at 350 degrees for an hour. Not sure I'd make this one again.

Loved this recipe.   But like anybody a recipe unless it is a baked good can be changed.  So I love Peperadge Farm Stuffing but I like to mix the cubed and the pieces just my preference.  I also sauteed some onion and celery with the butter until softened and added chicken stock (not water) to the pot and brought to a boil.  Because I don' like cream of mushroom soup I had some Campbell's chicken gravy and added stock not milk.  And to add flavor to the chicken I sprinkled on some chicken seasoning (it is called Special    I kid you not). And I cooked it for 40 minutes just to be sure since my chicken was still a little frozen.  Was very good and I roasted some acorn squash to go with.

This recipe get's two thumbs up! My family really enjoyed it, I even caught my wife licking her plate. I came home from town and my wife was busy with her work so I made dinner. I read the other review's so I added some salt and pepper, garlic powder, peprika and cayennen to the chicken before I backed it. It was fast and easy and was enough to feed everyone. Complements all round! Thanks for the recipe, it will be used often... Michael
