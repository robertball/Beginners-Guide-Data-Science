I was skeptical I admit when I realized I was to bake this coleslaw, but the cheese and breadcrumbs only enhance the flavor and the coleslaw mixture stays crisp. My husband loved it as well, and we kept it in the fridge and reheated it a couple of times for a quick side dish.

This was wonderful. I am not supposed to eat raw veggies anymore, per doctor so was looking for something to help my coleslaw craving.  I used a different dressing on this, panko crumbs and left off the butter.. just sprayed with PAM.. Will make this very often. thanks!

We were on vacation and trying to use up all the food we had in frig. We had left over cole slaw so I followed this recipe. We did not have bread crumbs so I used a cup of grape nuts cereal and no slaw dressing so I used ranch dressing. Mixed it all up,  put in a pie plate and in the oven. Everyone had raised eyebrows thinking this was a bad idea. Not so it was delicious. Everyone went back for seconds. There was left over salmon but no coleslaw crisp!

Everything about this was perfect! For my coleslaw I put sour cream with some plain yogurt and some Hidden Valley Coleslaw sauce, mixed it together and completed the recipe that my whole family loved!

Made this tonight. Interesting concept - warm coleslaw but great idea. It was too tangy for me so would like to try with a different dressing. Hubby enjoyed it. Didn't make any changes. Overall from my family 8/10. Thanks for sharing.

Made this today.  I had some 14-oz bags (on sale) of coleslaw mix so decided to try this.  I've never seen an 8-oz bag at any of the stores in my area.  Since the bag I had was almost double, I decided to simply double all the ingredients  (the 4 servings for the  recipe as written must be quite small).  I used Cracker Barrel sharp cheddar and Panko bread crumbs.  It tasted OK but didn't wow me.  Given all the 4- and 5-star reviews, I expected to be "wowed."  Don't know if I'll make again.

It was alright..I would probably add some yogurt, in place of a little of the dressing though. My kids didn't like it at all, but we don't normally eat cabbage.
