It was a little salty so I may try again with a reduced sodium broth.

I used low salt chicken broth and white beans with no salt added.  The sodium content on this if cooked as told is 1/2 your sodium for the day!   Too much!  Added my own salt, pepper, cayenne, and cumin really adds to the flavor.

Since I do not care for cilantro, I substituted parsley.  The soup is not very flavorful, you can just taste the cayenne pepper that adds heat.  Will add a little taco sauce when serving.

This was really easy to make but the flavors just weren't there. Next time I will add some Mexican oregano and shred the chicken so it can absorb more of the flavors. This would be a quick week night meal for those with little time to spare.

This is really good and easy. I used low sodium chicken broth and added cumin too.

I made this dish for a friend who is undergoing chemo treatments. The meds have made her tastebuds overly sensitive to salty tastes, so I left out the added salt and used salt-free chicken broth. Another chemo complication is mouth sores, so I also eliminated the cayenne and green chilis, as well as the cilantro. Sounding pretty bland, right?  I made some less spicy substitutions, using cumin in place of cayenne and fresh parsley instead of cilantro. Rather than cooking raw chicken, I used a precooked rotisserie chicken for added savory flavors. The canned beans and rotisserie chicken seemed to provide plenty of salt already, so I would not add additional salt anyway when I cook this in the future. In the end, my variation was not as bland as I feared it might be. I did add a few shakes of hot sauce to my individual serving... delicious & nutritious!
