Everyone but me really loved it. I thought it was too sweet and the brownie part baked up thinner and a bit chewier than I expected based on this photo. Because I like to make my life more difficult than it has to be, in the future I'd whip my own cream for this so it isn't too sweet. Thanks for sharing!
