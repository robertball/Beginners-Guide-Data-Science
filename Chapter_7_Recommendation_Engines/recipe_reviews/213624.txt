Excellent, filling supper. I didn't have enough black beans, so I added some navy beans and a can of chick peas. I buy dry beans, so when I cooked them, I tossed in a few chopped cloves of garlic (gets the blood flowin!) left out the ham, vinegar and sorrel and it still turned out GREAT! Also substituted veggie stock for beef and butternut squash for pumpkin. great flavor combo.

I made some substitutions - 2 pkg. frozen squash instead of the pumpkin (much quicker and easier), and spinach instead of kale. Loved the flavor!

OMG! This soup is soooo good! I took it to a pot luck and everyone loved it. Even my 3 year old liked it. My husband says it will be something he looks forward to every fall. I used fire roasted tomatoes because that's all I had but if anything I think that made the soup tastier.

Very good!  I used vegetable broth and left the ham on the side for my guests.  I also added cumin and coriander like another reviewer did.  It was a hit.

I love love this soup. I never grew up eating pumpkin, kale, or beans but wanted an interesting dish I could make and eat all week. After discovering this recipe, I have made it with ham, turkey ham, and chicken. All have turned out great. However, if you make it with chicken, you will need to add more salt. As suggested, I used one large can of 100% pumpkin puree out of the cake and baking isle of the store (much simpler than cutting up a pumpkin). I also buy the bag of pre-chopped kale greens rather than buying it then having to split and cut it.I never use sorrel or vinegar...mostly because I don't have any at home.  It always turns out great. This is a healthy, hearty soup that is perfect for a cold winter day. Since it is just me at home, I freeze half of it and then put it in the refrigerator to thaw when I am ready.

Hearty, delicious fall soup. I subbed in butternut squash and red wine vinegar and omitted sorrel (since I've never even heard of it). I also added couple cups of water near the end thinking it needed more broth. I will make again and try some of the other alternatives suggested here.

Really, really good!  I used chicken broth and diced cooked chicken instead of beef broth and diced ham.  Also, it has cream sherry AND white wine vinegar, 2T of each.

This was great!  I added a little cumin and coriander and that worked well.  The squash ended up a little overcooked. I guess i left it on too long at the end, or perhaps you could wait and add the squash later. In any case it was very tasty and my man loved it.  I chose a ham with a bit of a smoky flavor.

I swapped the beef broth for chicken and used cooked turkey instead of Ham. Also didn't have sorrel or sherry vinegar and this recipe was still delicious!!! So surprised how much flavor this has with really no seasoning at all. Will definitely be making it again!!

I made with pumpkin that I softened in instapot as well as doing the black beans in the instapot. I then sauteed the onions and garlic and added the pumpkin. I basically followed the recipe with exception of using chicken broth instead of beef broth and crushed tomatoes for diced. While simmering I put in smoked ham hocks. Very nice tasting.

I used butternut squash and  bacon bits instead of the pumpkin and ham, and it was a delicious soup, quick and easy.  Next time, though, I'd like to alter it to make it a little thicker (blend some additional cooked squash?). It was a little thin for me.

I love this soup! I've made it over a half dozen times, a couple tines in large batches to can. I've tried it with the fresh pumpkin (my favorite version) and with canned pumpkin (100% pumpkin puree). Both are so delicious! I skip the sorrel (don't know where to get it), but otherwise follow the recipe as is. One of my all-time favorite soups!

I gave this recipe a try the other night and was very impressed. As someone who is not the best at cooking, this stew was surprisingly easy to make, and even though I had to make a couple of changes, it turned out wonderfully. Since I didn't have any pumpkin on hand, I substituted with butternut squash. I did however, have some canned pumpkin puree, so I added a few spoonfuls to help preserve the pumpkin flavour, which I think gave it a nice thickness. And I didn't have sorrel (can't buy it here) so I added a little bit of lemon. I'm also vegetarian, so skipped the ham, and added vegetarian broth. The only other change I made was in the tomatoes; the canned tomatoes I had on hand were italian-seasoned. 
The stew turned out very flavourful, and it's even more tasty when reheated. Excellent fall recipe. A definite keeper!

I liked this very much. Fun to make although processing a pumpkin is hard work. I need to find the tricks to doing so. But I loved the pumpkin in it. I may try butternut squash in the future. I used a smoke ham which over powered the favors of the kale and pumpkin. In the future I may use a sugar ham or a ham bone for some flavor or just use half the ham as called for. Yet I'm still enjoying the leftovers. This is a delightfully healthy stew and I certainly recommend trying  this. A nice, healthy, autumn comfort  food kind of meal! Lovely!

I loved this stew! I had already roasted and pureed my winter squash, so I used that in place of the pumpkin chunks, and used white pepper instead of black pepper. Otherwise, I followed the instructions. Fantastic flavors and it made quite a lot of stew!

Very surprised by this stew.....very good with a refreshing flavor. My first time working with a pie pumpkin and loved the experience, even if it was lots of work! No changes to the recipe. I will add this to my fall soups to get in the spirit of fall here in Naples, FL. Thanks for putting this on the allrecipes site.

Great recipe. I use the pre-packaged butternut squash from Trader Joes rather than pumpkin and I use 1 lb. of extra lean (4% fat) ground beef rather than pork so it ends up being low-fat, low calorie.

Great recipe for the fall. I went to use my Cinderella pumpkin but it was bad so I used a butternut squash and it was delicious! I also used low sodium chicken broth since I didn't have beef broth on hand. And used some kielbasa instead of ham. I will definitely make this again and again. My husband loves it!

Fantastic hearty soup, we have 5 kids and the whole family loved it, even our 11 month old!  I used chicken stock instead of beef and sausage instead of ham because that's what we had on hand. This recipe is a keeper!
