This was fast and tasted good.  I did make some changes to use what I had on hand.  I used 4 slices american cheese in place of velveeta.  I used 1 full cup of sharp cheddar cheese.  I used 1/4 cup milk in place of the cream.  And about 2 1/2 cups pasta.  This was great, just as easy to make as box mac and cheese.  More like two servings... definately not 4 unless this is a side dish.

FYI DO NOT SALT THE PASTA WATER!!!! I usually salt my water for boiling my pasta but this recipe does not need that. It reasulted in a slightly too salty dish but I know that next time it will be perfect.

This was great.  

The cheddar cheese used was medium.  The Velveeta made the dish creamy.  I did not notice a velveeta taste at all.  

The only difference was more than 2 tablespoons of heavy cream was added to desired consistency.  

I also doubled the recipe...glad I did.  

Will have to try with sharp cheese, just to see how it turns out. 

Enjoy!

HELPFUL TIPS: If you like Velveeta from the box at the store then it may be better to just buy that b/c that's what you're getting here (exactly).  I don't even think you'll get credit for making it yourself since I'd take the box over this.  I told my husband what this was called (Restaurant Style Mac & Cheese), and he said "Whose restaurant?"  lol  If you're looking for restaurant style, you may want to consider something else.  If you're in college and love your velveeta, this is it except a load more of excess cheese.  I love cheese... heck, it could be my middle name, but even with 2C of macaroni... it was too much.  Sorry!

This was awesome fresh off the stove -- so creamy and much like Boston Market Mac & Cheese -- however, it didn't warm up very well after spending the night in the fridge -- A total keeper if freshly made but not for leftovers... Thanks!!

This really is creamy and delicious. I used whole milk instead because that is all I had, and I just used as much as I needed to get the right consistency, and it worked out fine. My only advice is to make sure you use a good brand of processed cheese, it makes all the difference.

It would've been 5 stars if I would've used less processed cheese than the recipe called for---- way too cheesie, but underneath all that cheesiness is a great dish.. 
It does remind me of Boston Market or even KFC like other reviewers said!

Easier than the blue box and twice as good.  Couldn't resist adding a good dab of butter and more cream.  I served this in individual dishes topped with buttered bread crumbs and broiled until golden brown. Made even better as "Truffled Lobster Mac and Cheese" by adding white truffle butter and hefty chunks of cooked lobster meat.

Excellent. Would be just as good with less processed cheese or a good bit more macoroni, and I needed a little more cream. (used low fat half & half).

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  I used evaporated milk and regular cheddar cheese and no processed.  This was so easy!  If it got to dry I added milk.... I didn't eat as soon as I made it!  Very Good!

This was really good, as well as quick and easy.  I did increase the amount of pasta to 2 cups.  I think I will go with 2 1/2 cups next time.  Also, I increased the cream to 1/4 cup.  I agree with another reviewer that the cheddar really cuts the processed cheese taste.  We liked this much better than the recipe that comes on the box!

This was such an EASY recipe. Very good.
I didn't have processed cheese so I just used the cheddar and added a little extra cream. I also didn't add the salt, however, I did add a little bit of mustard for flavor. It was devoured!

Amazing!  I loved this Mac & Cheese.  It was easy to make but definitely better than most I've had at restaurants even.  It is heavy though, so if you are looking for a light side this is not the choice for you.  My husband does not like it, but then again he thinks that Kraft mac and cheese is the best.....

If only it tasted as good as it looked! I love creamy mac & cheese, and yes, this recipe is every bit of that, but the flavor tasted terribly processed. I had never had Velveeta until this dish so maybe the unexpected flavor threw me off. It can be whipped up quickly and I'm sure kids wouldn't be so picky about eating it. I won't be making this again.

WOW, great mac and cheese! I used 2 cups elbow macaroni, Light Velveeta(R), 1/2 and 1/2 (just eye-balled it) and no salt (didn't need it). This was too simple and soooo good! A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was so rich and creamy! Absolutely delicious! I did add at least three times the amount of cream it calls for though. Otherwise I thought it would be too stiff. Definitely a keeper!

This was good. It does remind me of Boston Market mac and cheese. I do think next time I would add some pepper. Easy and cheesy. Family loved it too.

This is just as expected.  It is easy and kids love it.  Just for a kick, I added a can of diced green chilies.  I didn't have cream so I used skim milk.

That was fast easy and good.  Perfect for my son, he doesn't like a lot of things in his mac n cheese.  One reviewer posted her husband asked what resturaunt, I think more like Boston Market type resteraunt -vs- a fine dining resturaun, which was fine with me.  It was just as fast to make as a box mix, I mean fast, great for quick dinners or surprise company.

This was good for a quick, homemade mac and cheese, but for me, it doesn't compare to a baked mac and cheese.  When I am pressed for time, I would make this again.

I used Kraft slices instead of Velveeta, and used 2 cups of macaroni and 1 cup of cheddar cheese. Overall, tasted a lot like Velveeta shells, VERY rich. Too rich for an entire standalone meal, but would make a great side dish. Not a replacement for baked mac and cheese as a standalone meal, but still pretty tasty especially considering it takes 10 minutes and is super easy.

Very delicious, creamy mac & cheese. Simple to make. When I made this I didn't have milk or cream on hand so I used sour cream. It was perfect.

Extremely cheesy and my 2 year old said it was delicious! I used sharp cheddar (cheddar overload) will use plain cheddar as the recipe states next time. Love that it was a simple stove top mac and cheese.

OMG this is the best Mac and Cheese ever! It is creamy and cheesy, but not overly so. I was asked to make it to bring to Thanksgiving dinner at my friends house and it turned out scrumptious! Thanks for the recipe!

Good premise. I made it exactly as written,  and found it wanting a bit in the flavor department. The addition of 3 Tb Parmesan and 1 Tb sour cream helped make for a cheesier flavor. Also a judicious sprinkling of salt is in order. Go easy, then taste as cheese has a lot of sodium in it to begin with and it's easy to go overboard fast. After those additions the flavor went from bland to sublime. Note that as this dish  cools or if there are any leftovers, you will want to add a Tb or two of milk before reheating and stir to blend well (more may be needed,) as the cheese will cause the sauce to tighten up.

YUM! This recipe is good and easy. I made it with Penne (all I had in the pantry).  It made a pretty presentation.  I used the heavy cream as called for; however, I did add a splash of milk to smooth out the consistany.  Will make again and and again.

I just served over 75 kids and 30 or so adults with this recipe.It was for VBS and the children ate well and complemented me.
 I boiled 25 cups macaroni, following the advice in a few other reviews I added some chopped garlic, onion powder. I used 2 6lb 10oz cans of cheese sauce I purchased at Sam's. I stirred in one can into the boiled macaroni added some milk.
I baked it the next day and then added 2/3rds of the other can of cheese to the macaroni. Also some extra milk as needed. One kid said that it was almost as good as his moms and came back for more.

Nothing like the picture. If you follow the directions, you end up with a pan of burned rock hard cheese topping in 45 minutes.  I can only imagine what would have happenend if I waited the additional 15

Ok I modified the recipe a bit since I found the last step a bit weird. I added about 1/2 cup milk to a saucepan and warmed it up with 1 cup or so of sharp cheddar and added 9 oz cream cheese instead of velveeta since that is what i had on hand. To that cheese sauce I added some garlic and onion powder to taste with black pepper and sea salt then cooked it 'til I reached  the right consistency and poured it in the pasta. The recipe would feed 4 if you used it as a side dish only and not as a main. My son loved it better then any baked mac n cheese I have tried from this site.

My husband and I liked this better than any boxed macaroni!  I did make some changes, but only because I need to go to the store and didn't have everything.  I left the processed cheese out all together because I didn't have any.  Instead I used about two cups of shredded Kraft natural sharp cheddar cheese.  I used more cream than called for too, but I didn't measure it.  After I mixed it up I put it in the oven for about 10 minutes on 400 degrees with some seasoned bread crumbs sprinkled on top.  It was very good.  I'm never buying boxed macaroni again!

Best Mac and Cheese and super easy to make.  Kids loved it.  I used a box of macaroni and 1 pounds of Velvetta instead and still kept the chedder at 1/2 cup, only because the recipe yielded 4 servings and I have six in my family.  I used a 9x13 baker and still have enough for leftovers.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This mac and cheese was rich and creamy.  I love the Gourmet Mac and Cheese at Red Robin and decided to try and make it at home.  I doubled this recipe and used it as the base mac and cheese then topped it with goat cheese, bacon, grilled chicken breast and crushed croutons.  It was pretty close to the restaurant version.  Thanks for the recipe.

We thought this was good, even my daughter who hates homemade mac and cheese (she had a second helping).  I did add more noodles and cream to make it a little less cheesy.  I will make this again.

Super easy -- as easy as pouring in a packet of chemicals, so I think I won't be doing that ever again! After the mac was cooked, drained, and back in the pan,  I added a good hunk of margarine and stirred it in and then the cream (half and half).  I didn't have any processed cheese food, so I just used shredded cheddar. Boom! Awesome. Took it to a potluck, and the dish came home empty.

I'll have to agree with others. I would buy the blue box of Mac & Cheese before I make this recipe again. Turned very globby even with the addition of 1/2 cup half & half mixed with 1/2 cup water and 2 tablespoons real butter. Will be looking for another recipe.

Quick and easy. Doubled noodles to 3 cups. Added 4 pieces low-fat yellow sliced deli cheese, 2 1/2 cups shredded mixed cheddar, 1/2 cup skim milk, salt and pepper. After mixing on stove top per other reviewer, I added mac n cheese to well greased pan and sprinkled melted butter and seasoned bread crumb mixture over top. baked at 400degrees for 10min. Very quick and easy recipe and ingredients are always at hand. Definitely better than any box kind and a great base recipe to add to what you want. Next time im going to add chicken and broccoli.

If you like alot of cheese in your macaroni, then this is for you.  But, this was too much for us.  If I make this again, I would put more cream or some milk.

My kids love this recipe! This is so simple to make. I used half and half instead of cream and added a little extra. Next time I will halve the amount of processed cheese and add extra cheddar, just a preference.

Not impressed.  I wanted to make my entire dinner from scratch, but this would have been better from the box.  Baked macaroni and cheese is always better anyway!  I am a HUGE mac and cheese fan, and I will definitly not be making this again!

This was what I like to call a poverty meal. I made this to go along with a hot dog and a can of green beans. It was the end of the month and the budget was super slim. I wasn't expecting much because it was a throw together mac and cheese. I did like the end result. I do think it tasted like the boxed kind, but it was a nice addition to a budget table!

This was very rich and cheesy. I had to add more heavy creme to make it to where I could stir it up but other than that a solid recipe. We really enjoyed this quick and easy recipe.

My 11 yeraold daughter lives on mac n cheese. She practicaly eats it everyday. When I served her this she said wow this is the best ever! She loved all the cheese in it. My husband also eats mac n cheese alot and he also said it is the best yet. I don't like mac n cheese much but after seeing there reaction I had to try it. Lets just say wow this really is good! This will be the only mac n cheese I will make.

WOW!!! This was absolutely delicious! I used Ronzoni whole grain rotini, 2% Velveeta and whole milk instead of cheese and it was PLENTY rich and with reduced fat and calories to boot! I did have to keep adding more milk to make it a little "saucier". I put it all in a casserole dish, sprinkled it with breadcrumbs and baked it off just until heated through. HUGE hit!!!!

This mac and cheese recipe is a HUGE hit in our home.  My 3yr old asks for it at least once a week.  With leftovers, that's eating it twice a week.  My husband and I like it much better than the box. We also delivered it in a dinner when we were helping some people out - they absolutely loved it too.  Said I was the best cook in town!!! :)  Thank you for sharing!

I really liked this meal. I did change a couple things though. I made this for 6 so I did a full box of elbows and a cup of cheddar chesse. I also added some cut up ham and a two cups of peas to make more of a whole meal. I would def make this again my family loved it.

Yummy!  The whole family loved it!  I loved it because I made it with whole wheat pasta and 2% processed cheese.  I also used whole milk instead of cream b/c that's what I had on hand.  Will make again...and again and again!

My son came home from college having spent $120 during finals week on pizza hut's mac and cheese with bacon. We tried this recipe and added crumbled bacon bits to mimic his new favorite dish. He loved this better than delivery and we made several pounds of it for $15. He brought a couple of pans full back to campus this week and his roommates gave it all thumbs up. Delicious!!!And easy! Its a keeper!

This recipe is good, but not great.  It is guick and easy, but takes a little too salty for me and I didn't add any salt.  I doubled the recipe and used cheddar, monterey jack, Velveeta and half and half.  It was very cheesy (loved by the kids), but almost too cheesy for the adults in my house.  I can see by the consistency that it would not reheat well tomorrow so I didn't keep the leftovers (something I hate to do).  Next time, I'll stick with the baked macaroni and cheese.

Creamy and easy. Will definitely be making this over kraft! Only modification was using american cheese slices instead of the processed cheese and also chunked up cheddar. Very good recipe!

This tastes just like the mac and chs from the kids menu at Outback steakhouse which my daughter orders everytime we go there! It so good we all usually have to have a bite or two!:) however with this recipe I definately had to add more cream. I also used Mostaccioli shells instead. Very fast and easy!!! which I always like!

This recipe is really rich (in my opinion).  I used milk instead of cream and I added extra milk to see if I could thin the sauce out some and to reduce the richness.  I would say this is a good base recipe but might need to be played around with.

This is definitely a rich dish! I have to agree with the other reviewers that it tastes very similar to Boston Market's mac-n-n-cheese. My husband LOVED this, but I found the sauce to be too thick and sticky. Next time I'll use milk instead of heavy cream.

I love the fact that this is no-bake mac n cheese. I had to double the recipe for more servings and found it to be a bit dry. I kept having to add more cream. Otherwise, the flavor was great.

I ended up using double the amount of pasta and it was still excessively cheesy. And it truly is box Mac and cheese, not restaurant. Will not make again.

This is such an easy recipe for mac + cheese ! Love it. I just use less processed cheese and more of the sharp cheddar cheese, a dab of butter, and a bit dab more of the heavy cream ! It's wonderful ! :p

I made this per instructions - but doubled everything.  That surely wasn't necessary but with a bit of Half & Half added during the reheat, it was just as good the next day.   I thought it was great as did my sister who joined me for dinner.  It was creamy, cheesy and just like mom used to make.

I used white velveta b/c that's what I had on hand.  It was amazing.  The leftovers were better than the first day it was made.

Very good! I added some parmesan, pepper, oregano, and red pepper flakes for a twist on the taste. Next time I would have added less processed cheese.

I  was trying to find a mac and cheese recipe that didn't require the oven and used up some things I had in the pantry in preparation for a cross country move.  This was  perfect!  First, it is super forgiving, quantities did not have to be exact, so I could put a little more of this, a little less of that (precisely how I like to cook).  I used a bit more pasta because I needed to cook it. I had some Colby jack cheese sticks I put in my kids lunches in the fridge so I used those along with the Velveeta instead of shredded cheese.   I added the 1/2 and 1/2 as needed to get the consistency that was right for us and then asked my 4 kids to give it a try.  All 4 LOVED it and asked me to make it again .  This is my new go to and I will experiment with different cheeses to see how the flavors change.  But this is a kid pleaser and for that I am grateful. Thank you!

Great recipe, although I had one concern with how this recipe was worded. I'm well aware that processed cheese is usually the block(liquidy) Velveeta cheese or the sliced Kraft singles and the like, but this recipe stated this processed cheese needed to be "shredded". Because of this, I bought a block of cheese and shredded myself as a substitute. 
This tasted good when it was finished, but I am *pretty* sure I made it "incorrectly". Please correct this or be more specific for people like me, lol  :)
Thanks for the recipe

I did it. It's my first time cooking ANYTHING at all. I wanted something simple, I got it! For some reason, mine looked a bit more like Lepage Glue, but I think it'll be ok for school tomorrow. I just wanted to feel like I can cook something at all!

Made this and it was very good. Definitely used more heavy cream than what was listed. I didn't measure it exactly, but just added until the cheese sauce wasn't so extremely thick. Also, it's much easier to cut up the processed cheese than try to shred it as it's super soft. For added flavor I crushed some Ritz crackers with some Cajun seasoning and put that on top of the mac and cheese before setting it in the oven for a few minutes. Really made the meal.

This is a nice recipe as a guide to easy mac n cheese. I prefer to cut down the nacho taste a bit. Here is what I do now: 2 cups dried macaroni, 1 cup shredded cheese medium cheddar, 4 oz velveeta cubed, 1/4 cup whole milk. This comes out creamy and delicious!

I have been searching for a mac and cheese recipe like this for  a while and now I've found it! I'm not a fan of all the extra creamy recipes out there this one is perfect sticky and cheesy and probably easiest to make and tastes yummy :-) :-)

i've never been a fan of baked mac and cheese, since i grew up on the box variety.  This is better than the box and just as easy to make.  I used 2% milk velveeta shredded my own sharp chedder and used whole wheat rotini pasta.  Like another reviewer i used a bit of milk instead of the cream.

This was absolutely delicious and so, so easy.  My son had two bowls full and he usually only likes the boxed kind.  I did use a whole box of elbows and ended up adding a little more cream to get to the texture that we preferred.  It was rich and creamy and the leftovers are just as good.  A definite 5 star recipe.  Thanks sal!

This is like the Kraft Mac & Cheese but without the processed cheese.  I used american cheese instead of the Velveeta.  All my kids' friends who like the blue box macaroni & cheese thought that's what they were eating..and the moms were happy b/c it wasn't what they were eating.  Thank you.

I guess I don't see this as any better then using the recipe on the box of processed cheese. I ended up adding quite a bit of milk to get it a better consistency.

Initially, this mac&chees was good.  However, the longer it was out of the pan, the longer it set up and eventually, we couldn't eat it because it was so gummy.  My mother LOVES mac&cheese and she even threw hers out.  We will not be making this again!

This was delicious and easy (I really can't stand making boxed food so I was very happy to find this recipe).  A little too heavy to have just as a main course.

This is a really simple recipe.  I doubled the pasta, but kept the same amount of cheese, and it was still too cheesy.  I definitely recommend cutting down the cheese.

Who would have thought that Velvetta cheese was the secret to a restaurant style mac and cheese recipe?  This is our favorite Mac and cheese meal.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly.  I have made it several times since and have changed it up a bit.  I use skim milk instead of the cream and depending on how 'milky' the kids' like it, I have added up to a 1/4 cup.  I also have left out the cheddar cheese only because I didn't have any and it was very good.

I've made this a lot b/c its a quick and easy mac and cheese recipe.  But it not a really good one and certainly not the best.  My problem with this recipe is it is too thick and gets too dried out too quick.  I add more milk or cream, but then I start to lose flavor.  I now just make it out of the box or make the really good off this site.  Yum.

This was really good. Leftovers turned out well too. It actually seemed to taste better and had a thicker texture.

Liked the flavor however I doubled the recipe and it turned out very sticky. I will try again with exact recipe and see if it was me or the recipe. I was looking for creamy Mac and Cheese.

I LOVE how quick this was to make. My only complaint is it was a little too thick and creamy for us, next time I believe I will use more liquid. All in all this recipe is a keeper for those nights I have very little time...or I'm less than motivated. ;)

Very good, the family didn't turn their noses up at this as they do with most Mac and Cheese recipes. I made this according to the recipe except that I doubled the cream.

This mac and cheese had such a processed taste to it, and there was just too much cheese.  If I make this again, I will increase the pasta to 2 cups uncooked and I will reverse the ratio of cheddar to processed cheese.  The positive was that it was very quick and easy to prepare!  I guess I just don't like the taste of processed cheese.

I am giving this a 5 star because my kids loved it and it was easy....no baking.  This is a very good and basic recipe.  I have tasted 5 cheese mac that is better.  If it is easy and the kids love it what more could I want?  :)

This is a very rich macaroni and cheese!  I wish I would have used a nice sharp cheddar in it to offset the flavor of the velveeta, but all I had was a mild shredded cheddar.  I don't think I'll make this too frequently, it's so rich it's something you can only eat once in a while, but very tasty.

Ok, so I LOVED this.... This is exctly how I like my mac n cheese, but my boyfriend didn't care for it much. But who can really count his judgement of it because he ONLY likes Kraft Macaroni & Cheese with the powder mix...  Thank for the recipe, will just have to make again for only myself!!

This was terrific! I made it for my boyfriend as mac and cheese is his favorite, and he loved it! I've made baked mac and cheese dishes before and this comes out so much better and creamier. I want to use 1 percent milk next time in addition to half and half versus the heavy cream. I thought the proportions of cheese were just right. Also, heats up well!! Thanks for sharing!

I can't believe I used to buy the boxed stuff. This is just as easy and far better. The exact ratio of processed and cheddar cheese doesn't seem to be very important. I use whatever I have on hand and have never been disappointed.

Delicious! I used 2 cups of macaroni and 3 tablespoons of heavy cream instead. After the dish is made, I separated the macaroni into 3 oven-safe bowls, sprinkle some cayenne pepper and shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top. Then broil them on high for a few minutes. The macaroni turned out great - beautiful color and slightly crispy at the top but creamy and cheesy as you dig into the dish.
