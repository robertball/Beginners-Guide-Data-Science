My husband & I really enjoyed this recipe. I added some staple ingredients to this German dish; dried thyme, parsley, caraway seed, bay leaf & black pepper. Also, I threw in some minced garlic & chives, and kept the potatoes. Yum, Yum... Tasted very authentic! Thx for sharing :)

This was very good although just a touch bland.  I think next time I make this I will also leave the potatoes out as somehow they end up getting lost in all that cabbage anyway.  I was amazed at how so little broth cooks up the cabbage and my husband actually liked the cabbage:)  Will defintely make this again though.

This was very good.  I did add some garlic powder and a little butter.  I do think next time I will leave out the potatoes and make them southern fried on the side.

This brought back many childhood memories.  My German Grandmother always made pork, sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, and green beans for Holiday meals.  This tasted very similar, but I don't think I'll ever be able to perfectly match the meals my Grandmother prepared. Knowing that my Grandmother was always very generous with butter and salt, I added both to this recipe.  I don't usually cook with salt , so it didn't hurt to use a little extra.  I also added some freshly ground black pepper.   This recipe is a definite keeper and I will be making it often.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was sooooo tasty!!  I had the slow cooker on for 6 hours instead and it seemed about an hour too long, so the cabbage was kind of mushy, but other wise, this was great tasting!!

This would have been very good, except 8-9 hours in the slow cooker (at least mine) was too much. It was way overcooked, but the husband loved it anyways so it gets 3 stars. Made it exactly as stated. I will try again as I have a bumper crop of cabbage this year and maybe try for only 6-7 hours.

I really enjoyed this, especially I think for the easiness factor!  I followed the instructions as written, but left out the potatoes as suggested by other reviewers.  I used turkey kielbasa and added about 1/2 cup of white wine along with the chicken stock. I baked the potatoes instead, then opened them up, buttered them with a bit of Smart Balance and served with the cabbage/kielbasa mixture.  My only complaint is that there is so much cabbage, which is fine for me, but I think hubby and the kids would have liked to have more sausage, so I'll add more next time.  Really though, no complaints... my son ate his with yellow mustard the way he does his corned beef, but I thought the wine helped out the flavor and didn't need anything else.

My husband and I enjoyed this, the kids not so much so, but that's okay! 

I didn't read the method and by the time I realized it was to be made in the crockpot I didn't have enough time so I made it on the stove top. 

I sauted the onion in a little oil, added the chopped kielbasa and 1 tbsp minced garlic, sauted for a few minutes, added a bag of coleslaw mix and 1 cup of water and sauted it until the cabbage was wilted, added a bag of Purely Potatoes and 1 more cup of water with 1 tsp vegetable Better than Boullion dissolved in it, seasoned with pepper, onion powder and garlic powder, cooked for 15 minutes covered. Sprinkled with a little dill when served.

This is a very good recipe, but a little bland for our family as written. When I made it the second time, I added garlic powder, a little dry mustard, and extra pepper, and it was great. I also frequently add sauteed mushrooms, especially baby Bellas if I can get them.

I made this last night and based on the other reviews (thank you that is why I love this site)  I did not put it in the crock pot.  I put it in a roasting pan and baked it on 300 for about an hour and a half.  Until the potatoes were done.  It came out wonderful not mushy at all.  I also added baby carrots and seasoned it w/salt, pepper an thyme.  My family thought it was wonderful.  It had great flavor.

If you are a texture person this may not be for you.  The flavor was good but it couldn't overcome the soggy texture for my family.   If we weren't such picky texture people I'm sure I could have rated it higher.

I was surprised that this had more of a stew like texture than casserole. It was good and only took 5 hours to cook. (1 high, 4 low) I had to add more spices for our taste...garlic powder, parsley and caraway.

this recipe is a favorite of mine, but instead of putting into a slow cooker, I used a iron skillet and sliced the potatoes for regular fried potatoes and cooked them until browned, then added the shredded cabbage and put the kielbasa on top of the cabbage added just a little chicken broth to make sure that the potatoes didn't burn put a lid on it and it was done in about 30 minutes.  the kielbasa flavored everything wonderfully and it was a good way to get my kids to eat something green!

We thought this was fabulous! I chunked some red skin potatoes & added salt & pepper to taste, also 2 cloves of garlic. We LOVED it! This will be a repeat!! I used polish sausage links(pre-cooked) so added them the last 2 hrs of cooking. Perfect!

Delish!! I made today with a few changes. Chopped up the cabbage, small red potatoes and kielbasa last night, and put them in the slow cooker with a 14oz can chicken broth, a small can of cream of chicken. I was concerned about it not having enough liquid so I also added a cup of water. (I'm new to cooking with cabbage.) I put the pot in the fridge, then took it out and set it on low right before leaving for work. It cooked for about 9 hrs, and although the house was a little weird smelling, the food tastes SO good! I'm definitely making this again in the near future, esp since cabbage is so cheap! Next time, I will likely add carrots cause I think that would have also been a sweet touch, and maybe a spicier sausage since my husband likes spicy. This is a winner-and it was super easy! I'm having seconds as I write this!

This was alright. I used a polish sausage (not precooked), and it was very greasy. It was also a tad bland for us.

I'm a huge fan of German food, but this did not work for me.  The flavor of the cabbage (which I normally like) and the flavor of the Kielbasa (which I also like) did not marry well together, and I was sorry I went to the trouble.  Not particularly German, either.

Very Very good!! If you dont have a head of cabbage, I substituted cole slaw mix. Worked very well. I think it was better when I made it the day before and then warmed it up. The flavors mixed together wonderfully.

I made this for my kids & grandkids last week and they loved it. The only thing they asked me to do different is leave out the onions. They are the ones that gave it 4 stars. I'll make this again for sure.

Good recipe, if you want to use potatoes(which I do) use red potatoes. They hold their shape and don't turn into mush (not that that is a bad thing). I use a little white wine too. This is similar to our family recipe for a New Years day stew that I have made for 40 years. We are polish but that is close to Germany. I serve with sour cream on the side.. just yummy! Thanks for sharing.

This was absolutely wonderful!  All I added was garlic powder, thyme and pepper - outstanding.  5 hours was all the cook time necessary in my slow cooker on low. This took me back to family picnics when I was a kid, and my aunts would make this every year. SO YUMMY! Thank you Margery!

I made this as something easy to prepare while lounging around the pool.  My husband and friends loved it!  Based on some other reviews, I added the potatoes after cooking for 5 hours so they turned out perfect.   I also added sliced carrots and green beans for color.  A definite keeper.

I've been trying to make a good cabbage meal for a long time, and this one was great. It has just the right amount of oil and moisture. Next time I'll leave the potatoes out though.

This is a great, quick & easy meal.  The only change we made was to add Worcestershire sauce...1 to 2  tbsp as to your liking.  Will make this again and again for sure.

Loved it.  Will definitely make again.  Only addition was 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes for a hint of spice.  Next time I think I'll cut down cooking time to 4 hrs. on high instead of 4 1/2 hr.

Easy peasy!

don't add salt (kielbasa adds enough)

This was extremely simple but very flavorful.  I used bagged coleslaw mix for the cabbage to save time.  I will likely add another potato and some carrots next time as well.  Whole family loved it.  Will definitely make again!

We left out the chicken broth since the kielbasa (we used 3 pkgs since 2 is never enough meat for us) kind of makes it's own broth. We also left out the potatoes thinking the texture would just be too strange for us. Since we left out the potatoes I sliced up a couple large carrots and threw those in instead. It turned out amazing! My slow cooker was too small so I split the veggies and sausage into 2 large pots on my stove-top and cooked it for a couple hours on medium low heat. My husband usually just tolerates my cabbage and kielbasa nights (I'm addicted!), but this time he actually LIKED it!! I'm SO happy with this recipe! He said we'll have to do it again! YES!!!

Really good stuff!  Easy to make, inexpensive and filling.  FYI, one whole medium head of cabbage equals approx. 8 cups shredded.  I used 5 medium-sized red potatoes, and I cut them into chunks somewhat bigger than 1/2 inch.  I also rounded out the salt to 2 tsps.  It started smelling really done after about 7 hours on low, so I went ahead and served it, and it was great!  The potatoes and cabbage held together very nicely.  I really like the way the cabbage came out tasting very similar to sauerkraut, simply by cooking it in chicken broth.

Did not like this this  Kind of blah.  Have done the same thing with sauerkraut without the chicken broth and much better.

I love all of the ingredients in this dish - but this dish itself, I did not like.  I used much less onion than the dish called for, but the onion seemed to overpower the rest of the ingredients. Definitely will not even attempt to make again.

I highly recommend this recipe for cabbage lovers. YUMMY! I made not modifications to the recipe. It was super easy to chop up and throw into the pot and was perfectly cooked after 8 hours.

Delicious and so easy to make! The cook time isn't quite as long as the recipe dictates and I would add the cabbage during the last hour of cooking, otherwise it gets so soggy it disintegrates.

Super easy, really good, cheap and it feeds an army. My whole family loves this even my one year old eats it. Make with rice and desert. Bonus it only takes one pan to cook so clean up is great. I would recommend letting the vegetables saute and brown the sausage in some spices- it gives it a better flavor.

My family ADORES this recipe and we have been making it for YEARS!  Both boys have learned how to make it to for when momma is not well enough to cook (I have lupus)...Only diff in my recipe and yours is if i do it in the crock pot i only cook for 4-hrs and if i do it in a dutch oven I cook for about 3-hrs at 300F.  Anyway, excellent recipe that has apparently been getting passed down for generations for good reason ;)

Yummmm.  Just followed all the directions.  We could not think of any way to make it better.  Glad we had nothing to compare it to.  It was very good.

This was very good. Simple comfort food that we served with biscuits.  Because of other reviews commenting on blandness and texture I added some herbs to taste and didn't cook for quite as long.  My youngest who doesn't like cabbage said he'd eat it again - high praises coming from him!

Great recipe!! I added some vinegar half way through cooking because I was trying to recreate something my mom makes, but overall, it was great when the recipe was followed.

We love this recipe.  Even my 12 year-old loves it.  I use veggie broth instead of chicken because my husband doesn't like the taste of chicken broth.
