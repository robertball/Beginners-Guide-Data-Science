This is NOT Russian Olivieh! If you want the authentic Olivieh, look in 'Russian Potato Salad' recipe. That one is pretty authentic. Just use bologna instead of hotdogs and add boiled carrots, chopped up.

This recipe was a really nice change from the traditional potato salad, and fun to decorate with olives and serve, but I had to knock off a star because it has too much mayo and not enough olives. Also, since this is best served with 'medditeranean food' I used greek olives along with green olives for an extra kick. Very good thouigh, especially on pita/ flatbread!

Pretty good.  Very easy, too.  I didn't measure the mayo, but what I used did not equal what the recipe called for.  It doesn't need that much mayo, and I added more olives.  This is good just eating on the plate--forgot the pita bread this time, but I'll eat the leftovers with pita.  Thanks

I have made this recipe many times. Everyone loves it!  I don't measure my mayo and use a soy free brand.
