This is a great and easy recipe. The first time I made it I followed the directions exactly and it came out great. I have made this a few times and tried little differences to the sauce and found sauce can be adjusted any number of ways from spicy to cheesy.

Very thick and creamy, but not much flavor. I would not add the nutmeg again.  I would, however, add garlic and onion, and more sausage.
