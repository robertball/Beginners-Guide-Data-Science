Fantastic recipe! Followed it exactly but I baked mine in the oven at 375 for 20 mins and then turned on the broiler for about 5 mins. The meat came out very juicy w/ a little char on the edges just like if it was made on the grill! Next time I might either half or completely omit the water.

This is a great recipe. I make this dish quite often and usually marinate the meat with rice wine(if you don't have it you can use red wine or beer) and a cup of grated apple or kiwi or pineapple or pear first for a couple of hours before marinating it with other ingredients. This really makes a lot of difference. It makes the meat so tender and juicy.  Koreans usually use fruit to marinate meat and this way you don't have to put too much sugar. I also season it with salt and pepper ( a pinch of salt and about a teaspoon of pepper)

These were awesome.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Used boneless ribs.  The extra thing I did was after I marinaded the ribs for 36 hours, I poured it all in a saucepan - boiled it and then cooked it slow for an hour to reduce it to a thick sauce.  Used that to glaze the ribs while they were on the grill.  DELICIOUS!

Wow. If this is Korean BBQ then American BBQ needs to learn a few things from this.

I eat korean bbq ribs all the time and my korean auntie makes this quite often at family gatherings along with all the assorted korean veggies (namool), rice, soup, etc. You don't need to grill this very long and the time called for in this recipe it approximate.  This is a very delicious when bbq'd on the grill and I can always taste a hint of the ginger and sesame oil mixed in with a little sweetness to balance the flavor. I usually serve this with hot rice, "Kongnamool," (korean soybean sprouts) and " Korean-style Seaweed Soup," all from this site. Mmmm...so tasty and fullfilling!! UPDATE:  Family loved this as always, gobbled this up in mere seconds, licking fingers and smacking lips. The meat is so juicy and tender and has a nice sweetness from the brown sugar, a hint of sesame oil, garlic and ginger. Yummo!!!

Delish! I mostly can only rate the marinade because I used a different cut of meat. Beef chuck flanken style ribs. Marinaded it for a good 6 hours. Actually thickened the marinade that was left and cooked it with some asian style veggies. Daughter and boyfriend rate it 5 stars! Me too! This is my kitchen approved!

this recipe is very tasty.  i used boneless shortribs and marinated in a ziplock bag for 2 days in the fridge and did not add water.  i did not have any green onions on hand and subbed minced yellow onion.  i also put these under the broiler and cooked to medium.  They were delicious!  i sliced the meat thin and as suggested, rolled them in romaine lettuce leaves and chili paste and ate with white rice. Yum!

this was FANTASTIC.  I followed the recipe exactly, and served as suggested - rolled in romaine lettuce leaves, with rice, browned garlic, and hot chili paste.  My husband is still talking about this meal days later, thats how I know it was a hit.  (my 3 year old also polished off the rest of the meat plain after we finished our rolls!) I just had plain old beef short ribs (bought at Wegmans) in the freezer, and found this recipe to use them in.  Its always so nice when a "new" meal turns out to be such a success!!  Thanks so much, my husband is already after me to make this again as soon as possible!  And, I will have to double the recipe next time! ;)

These were nothing short of perfect!!  Probably one of tyhe best recipe's I have ever found.  Amazing taste....better then any sauce I have ever bought.  Best part is it takes minutes to get ready, then just bbq time.  I marinated for 24 hours.  this one will be made again for sure!!!

Nice.  Too much salt for me, (I used reduced sodium soy sauce the 2nd time) and too much sugar.  (I tried it with 1/8 cup sugar the second time.)

And if you do that, reduce the salt and sugar, you can pretty much omit the water too.  The recipe does benefit from a couple of days in the fridge marinating in a ziplock bag.

This was very, very good.  We made it with boneless short ribs on the grill, and it was fantastic.  Next time I'm going to use the marinade with chicken.

Soooo good, my husband loves this. I use extra garlic and reserve some extra green onions on the side for garnish at the end. I also reduce the leftover marinade for extra dipping/drizzling sauce. Serve with sauteed spinach greens and white rice and we have a complete delicious dinner!

Only problem with this was that there wasn't enough of the ribs. Could have eaten way more.

I had been weary of using this recipe because all i Had was regular beef short ribs and they were very tough but i sliced them thin and BEAT them using my wooden hammer meat tenderizer contraption. I omitted the water and they taste better than the resteraunts. Im making rice with it to complete this perfect meal! Definitely making it again for the family.

Made per recipe, but used regular onion instead of green.  Marinaded overnight, then cooked in my crockpot.  It was really good and I received many compliments from my guests, but next time I want to at least finish them on the BBQ grill.
Served this dish with jasmine rice and green beans.

This recipe came out great!! The marinade gives it the right amount of flavor, giving you a savory taste of the marinade and beef! It uses very simple ingredients found in your kitchen. I used thin boneless ribs and also added chopped round onions and toasted sesame seeds into the marinade and soaked it overnight. The next evening i fried it on a frying pan. Once the meat was cooked, i wrapped it with lettuce and ate them in mouthfuls. So simple, but so... great tasting!!

This had such a great flavor! I basically followed the recipe except made a few changes based on other reviews and what I had on hand. I didn't have sesame oil, so I used oil from some tahini paste, an extra clove of garlic and used 1/2 cup pineapple juice and 1/4 water instead of just water. I also used pork country ribs instead of beef, only because that's just what I had. I did bake them in the oven as others suggested at 375 for about 20 min and then turned them and baked another 10 to 15 min. They were boneless and some were bigger than others so I just took out the smaller pieces and cooked the larger pieces as needed. I did follow another suggestion and boiled the marinade for a dipping sauce. I mixed some water with a little cornstarch to thicken it. I saved some left over sauce after this meal and used it to dip chicken. Really really good!!

One word...Awesome!!  These are spot on as confirmed by 2 Korean friends.  I marinated for 24 hours but would recommend longer.  One friend said he grandmother would marinate for 3 days.

Very close to the recipe I got when I lived in Hawaii. I doubled the garlic and green onion.
Very good marinade for chicken also.

My husbands favorite! We use equal parts fresh ginger and garlic, less sesame oil, increase soyu and brown sugar and omit the water. Good marinade for any kind of meat.

Instead of grilling, I threw everything in my slow cooker--marinade and all--and it made a delicious stew. I could inhale this stuff by the bowlful with some white rice!

Love it! Tastes just like a recipe for "Maui beef" I once had & lost. I use flank steak or flap meat in one large piece and grill it, then slice thin. Perfect with rice or any Asian meal. Thanks for sharing!

Super easy recipe still tastes good if you cut the marinating time down, but tastes wonderful and meat tender if you marinate overnight.

This recipe is totally awesome!! I had never cooked short ribs before, I followed this recipe only adding fresh ground pepper and a little seasoning salt on the ribs. I let them marinate for 24hrs. Since I did not have a grill I used my large George Foreman grill, which worked out great and as I took the cooked meat off the grill I put them in a glass container that was in the oven to keep them hot and crisp. I server them over rice my family really enjoyed them.

Made this recipe today with short ribs(that were thick). I made double the sauce 1 1/2 sauce in the plastic bag to marinate the other to baste(added cornstarch to thicken).  We put them  on a pan on the grill let them cook while basting then towards the end put them directly on the grill. I ran out of soy sauce so I used kikko teriyaki marinate. I only had little bit of green onions. But that didn't make a difference. I served them with mixed veggies, chicken dumplings and white rice.  My family loved it. Will definitely make again.

No luck with this recipe. Too salty. Baked and broiled per reviews. The Beef Bulgogi recipe from here is better.

So easy and delicious. I made no changes I would marinate the meat as long as possible. I made the mistake of marinated for less than an hour and did not run out very well.

Great recipe but it seems to be missing something. Maybe some apple/pear puree like the bottled marinade has.I poured the marinade into a pot and brought it to a slight boil so I could use it as dipping sauce.

Used this recipe with a 6 pound brisket that had been tenderized. Marinated for 3 days in a vacuum bag then slow cooked for 6 hours on my smoker.  Served with white rice on romaine lettuce leaves.  Rave  reviews, could have eaten 3x as much.  Great flavor

Followed the recipe but cooked ribs in oven at 375 for 25 mins and 3 mins in broiler. The family absolutely  LOVED them. This is an amazing recipe will be making these often.

I made this for an appetizer party and it was easily the star!  The marinade was quick and easy to prepare.  I opted for the baking and broiling method recommended by another user.  It also was very simple and fast to complete.  Finally, I reduced the marinade and used it as a dipping sauce.  TO DIE FOR!!

This recipe is so yummy I add just a bit of ginger and sesame seeds and marinate over night. ...i use beef short ribs their the thick cut no bone ribs meat you can buy anywhere and marinate it over night, before I cook them on a skillet I slice them thin and cook on each side just for a minute or two depending how thick you slice your meat and they are so incredibly tender it's amazing.  I had a lot of meat after I sliced it all,  bought it at costco, so I stuck the rest in a zip lock bag in the marinade into the freezer it kept well the freezer batch tasted as great as the first if not better.  Thank you for the recipe!

Wonderful and super easy recipe! I decided to bake it instead of grilling. Preheated the oven to 370 and baked each side for 12 minutes. While it was cooking I brought the rest of the sauce to a boil and then kept it on medium low heat until it turned to a thick delicious sweet and savory glaze, which was suggested in the previous review. After the ribs cooked for 24 minutes, I broiled it on low heat for a 5 min. Poured the glaze over it and it was delicious!!!!

This is a wonderful dish. I used 1/2c soy sauce only; I didn't have green onions so I grated 1/3 of regular onion for the marinade.  I also added all the juice and three slices from a can of pineapple (thanks to another reviewer)for a little sweetness. (I put the pineapple through the food processor.)  Marinated for 3 days,turning at least twice daily; barbecued about 5 minutes per side. DElishious.  Cooked up the marinade for 10 minutes to serve for extra sauce - everyone took some.  Had 2 requests for the recipe.  Am going to the store to buy more of these ribs(they're on sale right now).  I'll put them in ziplock bags with the marinade and freeze until I wish to serve them again, which won't be too far in the future.  Thank you, thank you to the recipe poster.

Marinated the ribs for 3 days as another reviewer recommended. Also upped the amount of garlic. These turned out AMAZING - so much flavor, and the meat was fall-off-the-bone tender. So good! Thanks, CC!

A good recipe. I think next time I'll make it with a little more sesame oil and less garlic (although i probably put too much garlic in the first time).
Edit: subbed 1 tsp onion powder for the green onions to great success.

Fabulous recipe. I marinated the meat for 36 hours, and made two changes to the marinade. Instead of water, use pineapple juice (the citric acid makes the meat even more tender) and add a tablespoon of grated ginger for a bit of heat and flavour. My wife and both agreed it was the best short ribs we had ever had

This was such an awesome surprise. I added a bit of ginger, some honey & mashed up some canned pear & pineapple with a bit of added juice from each into the mix. Don't care for sesame so added just a pinch of grillin' Asian sesame mix, used yellow onion & baked, then broiled as per other reviewers, also have grilled at the campsite. AMAZING Thanks for the recipe. It is now on rotation for chicken, pork butts sliced into rib style, etc. Great job!

Really easy and really good. I did make some adjustments. I added season salt, onion powder, black pepper, and red wine vinegar to the marinade. I also used the marinade once removing the ribs. I simmered it down with some chopped celery, bay leaves and minced onions and used it to drizzle on top of the finished grilled ribs. Once I drizzled the sauce, I put them in the oven covered on 350 to bake for 30 minutes and they came out very tender and full of flavor. This is a keeper. Yum.

These were good but the ribs don't get soft enough this way.  I would use the same marinade (which is the bomb) but slow cook the ribs at 325 in a tightly covered pan for 3-4 hours or use a crockpot next time. I may just use this as a stir-fry type sauce for chicken as well. Very good. UPDATE: have used as a stir-fry sauce and it's wonderful. I just thicken it with about 1/4 cup corn starch mixed with cold water. Add it a little at a time until the sauce is as thick as you like. VERY good.

Love this recipe because my son actually tried it and liked it. When he sees the short ribs at the market he now makes a request. The sauce is ideal and the meat comes out tender. Great recipe.

It tasted like the ones I had in Korean restaurants and I'm amazed it is so easy to make. I followed it exactly, marinated for three hours, and grilled it on our George Foreman grill and it turned out perfect. Thanks for the great recipe!

I had never seen or heard of this kind of ribs so couldn't wait to get them and fix them.  DH couldn't stop oohing and aaghing over them.  Only complaint he had "wasn't any leftovers"....LOL!  So next time I will have to double the recipe.  Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe.

Followed recipe except in place of water I used about a cup of fresh pineapple chunks in water. Marinated beef short ribs for 48 hours, then grilled them. They were excellent! We boiled the marinade in the microwave, then poured some over white rice. I would do the same marinade next time. And I may try it with chicken too.

We buy beef shares for meat, and it is wrapped in paper.  It said "short ribs" on the package, and that was what I searched, but I don't think I had the best kind of meat for this recipe.  I will make it again when I know what I'm working with, and I will try the idea someone had of using pineapple juice instead of water.  I will also marinate it longer (I did 3 hours).  I had to use tapioca flour to thicken the sauce for serving with sides - it wouldn't cook down in the 25 minutes I had.  The sauce was delicious on our rice.

I followed this recipe exactly,  but maybe expected too much.   I  didn't find these tender at all.  the marinade was very good,  but found the ribs way too tough for my family's liking.   Won't be making this again.

Great recipe. Did not need to alter one thing!  I marinated the short ribs for 8 hours and they were perfect.  I think marinating them longer might have made them too salty.

This recipe makes my husband fall in love with me all over again every time I make it. Instead of water I use a half cup of no-pulp orange juice, and I add about a teaspoon of ground ginger root. I also do what another user said, bake at 375 for 20 minutes and then broil for 5. Excellent!

It's definitely a recipe to try but I tweak it a little so it's not too salty. Turned out to be the best fall off the bone ribs. Thanks for recipe. For unknown reason, photo I uploaded and submitted did not take.

Super simple and super delicious! My only mistake is forgetting the kimchi to go with it! One change I would make, only for aesthetics, to add sesame seeds on top along with fresh cut green green onions :)
Oh, and I don't use a bowl, I just add all the ingredients in the bag, liquids last, then I shake it around to mix then add ribs. I also rotate the bag at some point during marinating just to make sure they all get a turn to sit at the bottom. Highly recommend for a simple yet tasty meal!

Cooked it in the crockpot. Low 6-8 hours. Super tender.Used less sugar (1/8-1/4 c.) and more garlic. Served it over rice. Very yummy! Update: made it in the pressure cooker. Doubled the recipe, added two cans of beef broth, 1 whole  onion chopped up,  1 Tbsp of ginger, lots of garlic. 40 minutes was so tender. Super quick this way!

I made this as written, marinating it overnight. I used a low sodium soy sauce, and that was still too salty but the flavor was outstanding. I don't know much about Korean food but really love the taste of this dish. The saltiness was offset by the rice I served it with but it was still too salty.  Next time, I'll decrease the soy sauce to our taste and see how it comes out. Otherwise, this one is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

I used a pureed pear to replace the brown sugar, and only added a small handful of brown sugar (since my pear wasn't as sweet as I would like). Using fruit or soda's are very common in korean cooking and I prefer it. I let it marinate overnight and cooked it the following afternoon on the grill. You should watch the meat carefully, because cooking 7 minutes on each side would have definitely burnt my meat!

Added tsp of rice vinegar and toasted sesame seeds. Used 1/2 cups instead of 3/4 cups for 1 1/2 lb short ribs.

Amazing marinade!  I didn't have short ribs, so I just sliced a round roast into matchstick sized pieces, substituted the water with coke (as someone suggested) and marinated for 24 hrs. After the 24 hrs, I placed them on a grated grill and put them on a hot bbq, stirring every minute or so until the meat was caramelized on the outside, which didn't take long.  I then served them as Korean tacos and they were devoured by the whole family, everyone absolutely loved them!

The ribs were tender and delicious, I followed the suggestion of others and tripled the sauce.  The sauce was bitter, and I don't like sweet things, so I ended up adding 1/2 cup additional brown sugar.

Such a simple and delicious weeknight meal! Added some red pepper flakes for more kick and served it up with some Jasmine rice and a crunchy asian salad on the side. The discerning mister gave it raves.

Followed the recipe as written, but baked in the oven as another review did. 375 for 30 minutes. They were very tasty but a bit salty for me. Next time I will cut back on the soy sauce, or better yet will use sodium reduced soy sauce.
Thank you for the recipe.

I am half Korean and always in search of a "go to" kalbi marinade as there are so many versions out there (including my mom's tasty marinade). After much trial and error of many recipes (including my mom's), this is now my go to kalbi marinade recipe. Even my own mom (who is an excellent cook) said that this marinade was better than hers!!  I made a couple of tweaks and have the following suggestions:
- Instead of 3/4 cup water, I used 1 cup (think another reviewer also suggested this)
- I used tons of garlic (I must use about a head of garlic)
- I peeled a kiwi and then minced it to add to the marinade. Kiwi helps tenderize the meat.
- I usually double the marinade as I made 2-3 packs of the Korean style kalbi meat and use a huge size ziploc bag to place the marinade and meat
- Definitely marinate this over night (and flip the ziploc bag to the other side in the next morning).
Great kalbi marinade!

Phenomenal recipe. The longer you marinade, the better. This tastes as good as the authentic Korean BBQ you can find in Korean communities, including Hawaii.

These are great! Like others, though, these ended up in the oven at 375 for 20 minutes and then broiled for 5 min. I took the marinade and thickened it on the stovetop with a cornstarch slurry (2tsp cornstarch to 1/4 cup water) and made a sauce for the rice and veggies. So tasty! Make sure you get good ribs though. We got cheap ones and had to pick out bone shards...

I made this exactly as written. I cooked it on the barbeque, which I think made it extra succulent. Don't use too high a heat, and do not walk away.  Between the fatty meat and sugary marinade it will burn quickly. Just excellent!

It was good (and I'm a novice cook).  I don't have a grill so I popped it in the oven for 10 minutes per side  @ 400 F...and crossed my fingers.  Both kids loved it.

Like many others, I omitted the water. I thought it was very good.  I marinated the meat overnight. I baked it in the oven at 375 for 20 min and under broiler for 5 min as another reviewer suggested. I am sure it would be better on the grill--but this was still good and I didn't have to get the grill going.

I had noticed this cut of meat (local market called them English Short Ribs but I learned through the internet it's actually Flakken) and had wondered how to prepare them.  Found this recipe and I marinated them for almost 30 hours, and other than maybe grilling them a little too long, they turned out great!  The flavor was excellent and I will definitely do this again.

Kids & hubby loved it. I Made 3 lbs of ribs  & all gone in one sitting. WOW! No leftovers! Made exactly as per the recipe. I used a high quality soya sauce that I do not find salty at all (I buy in large jars at local Asian supermarket).  This is a sweet sauce.  We grilled on the BBQ &  found it tasted best with a little char on the beef! Marinated overnight (12 hrs.) before I cooked.

Husband loved these. Could not get the ribs cut this way so used regular short ribs which take sooo long to get tender. So I braised in oven on 300 for   2 hours . Took marinade and reduced it to a syrup. Then painted on the ribs and baked for 30 more minutes. Very very good.

I used "country style beef short ribs" which were clearly not cut off of beef ribs. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Not likely to make again.

The sauce was delicious.  I bought boneless short ribs.  They were less than1/2 inch thick after I sliced them.  Marinated for 2 days.  Cooked less than 5 min. Per side on the stove top grill.  They were cooked and just pink inside.  Very tough.  I always thought short ribs were either braised or cooked low and slow.  I will not make this again with short ribs.  I will however try the sauce with skirt steak.  I think that would be a better choice of meat.  I was so disappointed this didn't work for me.   Did anyone else experience tough meat?  I would like to know as there were so many good reviews.

Tastes exactly like the best Hawaiian plate lunches and could be from any Korean place. I only cooked mine for about 8 minutes total (4 min. per side) and that was perfect. I will definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe for the marinade and marinated mine overnight.  I grilled mine until there was a light char on the edges and the meat was tender, about 5-6 minutes per side.  They were tender and flavorful.  I would have like more garlic flavor so next time I will add a couple of extra cloves.

Used the marinade on pork chops instead of ribs. It was delicious and will be added to our menu.

Follow this recipe to a tee every time and my family loves it!! It's easy and I always grill them even in fall. We frequent a Korean BBQ restaurant and this is pretty darn close if not equivalent.

Amazing taste and very easy to do.  The only thing I added was some grated ginger and more garlic to the marinade.  I also let it marinade for 2 days in the refrigerator (not planned it just worked out that way).  Also make sure you buy a well marbled flanken rib, such as from Sam's Club, to ensure your end result is tender.  After all these are still ribs and I'm sure you wouldn't expect ribs that have been grilled for 10-14 minutes to be tender???  So marbling is important.  This is a keeper and we will be making them again! Enjoy!

I made this dish for my husband who loves Kalbi. I just combined all the ingredients into a ziplock bag & massaged the bag-that was the extent of my marinade time. Poured a small layer of the marinade with the meat on a baking pan lined with parchment paper and baked it at 375 for 10 min on each side for a total of 20 min. Then broiled at 400 for 5 min each side. My husband loved it. I realized later that I forgot to add the sesame oil, but it wasn't missed.

One of my family's absolute favorite meals. I make the recipe exactly as stated and triple the recipe every time, so the four of us can have leftovers the next day :-)

My husband is Korean and he absolutely loves this recipe, the only thing I did is to add a tbsp of sesame seeds to the marinade as he requested for extra flavor, this is a staple in our home!
