I serve this biscotti every Christmas and it is a big hit.  I made a few changes: I decreased the flour to 3 cups (perfect), increased the coconut to 3/4 cup and toasted it, and used toasted pecans or almonds instead of walnuts (I like the flavor of the other two better).  One time I forgot to add the coconut extract and the coconut flavor was not nearly so pronounced.  I usually drizzle chocolate over the top for looks.  This is a really great recipe, and if you like coconut you  will fall in love.

This is a nice twist on walnut biscotti. I'd like to offer these suggestions to aid in flavor and forming: Decrease flour to 3 cups, toast the coconut til lightly browned and crunchy and increase to 1 cup, add a generous Tablespoon of Malibu rum instead of the coconut flavoring. Proceed with recipe as written.

Great recipe with changes.  Decrease flour to 2 1/2c, increase coconut to 3/4c and add 1/2c mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I use slivered almonds or macadamia nuts in place of walnuts.  I bake biscotti at least twice a month and this is the new favorite.

What did I do wrong, Carl?  My dough turned out very dry and crumbly.  
I couldn't get it to form into a log.  I ended up making little cookies out of it.

****5 star biscotti recipe.  Great tea or coffee biscuit as well.  YUMMY!  Only change was to add one cup of coconut and I lessened the flour as another reviewer suggested to 3 cups.  I did add in extra coconut extract for I like a strong coconut flavor to my cookies. Oh and I only had almonds so I used them instead of walnuts.  I dipped half of the batch in milk choc and kept half plain.  Both were more than 5 stars.  MMMMMM!  Will be using these in my Xmas cookie tins.

Yum! Yum!  Using the extract is the key to the taste in this, so don't skip the extract!  Some reviews said this was too crumbly (just add some milk to the mix, people!), but mine came out great.  I dipped some in white chocolate and others in dark--excellent!  Tip: Use a ruler to help shape the biscotti: use the flat side of a normal 12 inch ruler and "scrape" the biscotti into shape on a flat (preferably cold) countertop. This way you can tell just how thick and how flat the biscotti is; if that made any sense.

This is a very nice biscotti.  It is a little richer than biscotti made with egg only.  The butter in this recipe makes it very rich.  The coconut flavor is very subtle.  This is also quite easy to make.

Awesome biscotti! This is the first of six different kinds that I made from this site and it is my favorite out of all of them. Followed recipe as written but sub. pecans for the walnuts and toasted the coconut. Try this, it really is the best!!

Excellent recipe. Crispy and flavorful. Its a very good basic recipe in which you can sub. lemon, almond or orange extract for the coconut extract. Toast your coconut for the extra nutty coconut flavor.

These turned out fine for me...maybe a bit drier than other biscotti I've tried.  If the dough crumbles when you try to make your logs, add a bit of liquid like a drop or two of milk.

Another post indicated that the flour should be reduced while adding more coconut. I always try the recipe as written before moving on to changes others may recommend; in this case I wish I had cut the flour as these became a little gummy as I worked in the last bit of flour and then the nuts and coconut. So definitely reduce the flour to 3 cups and you'l have better results. As for the flavor, these are A++ with my family!

First time making biscotti, and I am so impressed with how these turned out! They are incredible.. Coconut flavor is just right. I did use almonds, and I think they pair perfectly with the coconut. Next time I'll take more time rolling the log, so they all come out the same size.. Mine weren't the prettiest ;) But still wonderful! This is truly a delightful and easy recipe that I'll be making all summer! (oh, and I drizzled with white chocolate, but they are great without it)

Wow! I made a few kinds of biscotti for my family, and they liked this one so much they barely touched the other kinds. Like the other reviewers said, it's a bit crumbly, but it's nothing a little milk wouldn't fix easily. Simple recipe, too. Thanks!

Very good. Although like suggested in the other reviews, I only put in 3 cups of flour and little bit more coconut than asked for.  I aslo did not add the walnuts (allergies). The dough was very dry but by adding some milk that problem was solved.  In the end, the changes were worth it!

I have tried several biscotti recipes and this one is my favorite 'base' recipe! The coconut walnut combination is yummy, but I've also deleted them and made variations:  Orange Almond, Amaretta/almonds/almond flavoring, Almond Joy (cocoa powder, coconut and almonds).  You can change it up so many ways and it's delicious every time!

VERY EASY WITH GREAT RESULTS!!  I too adjusted the recipe a bit; 3 1/8 cup flour, 3/4 cup cocunut and I used pecans because that's my favorite which I toasted together, very lightly, before adding.  It might seem like it's dry but don't give up, divide the dough in half and roll each half out on the counter with your hands and if the roll separates, simply pat it back and keep rolling gently back and forth till you have a log, The butter content will mesh it together if you're patient!!!  My 3 year old "helps" me when I'm cooking/baking and these were a perfect recipe for her to help me with.  TRY IT, I can't wait for tomorrow morning to eat them with my morning cup!!! thanks for a great recipe.

I'm sure this recipe is great as written but biscotti really lends it self to substitutions and so I did.  Followed the suggestion of other reviewers and reduced flour to 3 cups.  Used chopped almonds in place of walnuts and 3 extracts:  1/2 tsp. each of vanilla, coconut, and almond.  With addition of mini chocolate chips it's like Almond Joy biscotti!  It's easier to slice if it cools for a full 15 mins first and don't use a sawing motion when slicing - just cut straight through.

This was my very first attempt at making Biscotti and the results were a winner. I took them to the salon I work in to share and got rave reviews. I dipped the bottoms in melted white chocolate and added a little more coconut extract to the recipe. YUMMY!!!

I followed the suggestion of reducing the amount of flour to 3 cups but the dough was still a little too dry.  I added a bit more butter to bring the dough to the right consistency and the biscotti turned out just fine.  I will make this again but next time will start with 2 cups of flour and add in a bit at time until the dough is the right consistency.  Thank you for posting this recipe!  It's a keeper.

YUM!!!  Superb recipe!  I made it first by following exactly, and then made a second batch, doubling the coconut extract and adding more shredded coconut and a little less flour, as others recommended.  Much better, more coconut flavor.  Really nice texture, too!  thanks for a great recipe!

This is really good, But I added about 2tbs. of water because the first batch was a little too crumbly. I also glazed it with white chocolate which gave the cookie a full taste, so that its sufficiently tasty by itself!! YUMMY!!

Loved this recipe! The dough was crumbly for me because I was impatient and dumped all of my flour mixture into the creamed mixture at once. this would be a good reason to watch a video about making biscotti before attempting it. oops.  I packed it all together into the log shapes and they still turned out just fine. I use a pizza cutter to cut the slices with, starting at each side and meeting each cut in the middle so I don't force the side edge into breaking, if that makes sense. I've made this the original way with the coconut, but I prefer to substitute 1 tablespoon grated orange rind, 1 teaspoon vanilla and 2 tsp almond extract for an orange amaretto flavor. Next time I'll make sure to dip the bottoms in white melting bark for a nicer look because I usually end up giving half away.

This one is a KEEPER!  I love biscotti's and these were oh so good.  After reading the reviews, I added the flour a cup at a time and I ended up using only 2 cups.  Also, yes I did some changes ONLY because I use this awesome website for ideas to use what I already have on hand.  SO I used 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract, pecans instead of walnuts.

This recipe is always a hit with friends, family & co-workers.  Their yearly requests usually start just before Thanksgiving to make sure I don't forget to make THEIR treats for Christmas.  I melt white chocolate and drizzle over each piece. It really finishes it off and adds an excellent sweetness, especially when dipped in coffee.

This was the first recipe I tried for biscotti and it will be the only one I use.  I added lemon extract in an equal amount to the coconut extract for a little addition to the coconut.  I also toasted the coconut prior to adding it.  I found the dough to be very crumbly however so I added an extra egg.  The result is a great tasting coffee dunker...

Just finished making these - FAB-O. I did use less flour - somewhere between 2 1/2 and 3 cups along with a cup of toasted coconut and a little extra extract. Will be making them many times in the future for family and friends!! I've been making Cinnamon Hazelnut  recipe only using almonds and almond ext. They have always been our favorite - but I really think everyone will like these every bit as much - maybe more. I'll probably put some white chocolate (with some left over sprinkles of toasted coconut) on some of them - but they really have a nice sweet flavor already and will enjoy them plain as well. THANKS CARL!!

Definitely decrease the flour amount to 2 1/2 CUPS. I increased coconut extract to 2 tsp., increased shredded coconut to 3/4 cup and used 1 cup slivered almonds. Very good!

I made this recipe with modifications this afternoon. I should have double it. I replaced the coconut extract with strong rum, half cup roasted coconut, 1 cup chopped walnut and about one cup of chocolat chips semi sweet and cut the flour to 3 cups. I should have cut the sugar by one quarter cup because of the chocolat chips. They are a litle bit too sweet for me but excellent for the sweet tooth. I give it a 5 star

I've tried a lot of biscotti recipes, and this one is one of the best.  I used unsweetened coconut and fructose due to health issues.  The biscotti came out with a delicate coconut flavor that is astounding.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

I used "smart balance" instead of butter, cut the flour to 3 cups as suggested, and used vanilaa because I ddin't have coconut extract. They came out yummy but crumby. And the first batch I left in for 7 1/2 minutes on each side after i sliced them and they burnt. The second batch I left in for only 5 minutes per side which was better.

I baked this recipe today and used the 3 cups of flour that some reviewers suggested.  I make alot of biscotti every month.  What a disappointment this was.  They were dry and hardly spread to the normal size.  Also as cutting them, they also broke apart and crumbled.   I will stick to my other recipes and forget the coconut.   Hope everyone has better results than I did.

I read many reviews before making this biscotti and here are my suggestions.  The dough was very easy to handle with 2 1/2 C. of flour. I decreased it by 1 C. in error.  Perhaps that was the reason my biscotti was not as hard.  I toasted coconut and added almonds for my nuts.  I used Malibu Rum for flavoring, but think that next time, I would use almond or vanilla.   I baked the loaves on parchment paper and the second bake as slices did not need parchment.  I would use an egg wash on the top to make the top shiny, because these really do not need frosting.  I will use this recipe as my go to recipe as I personally like the dough and make my changes for flavoring based on what others have written.  Thanks Carl for sharing your recipe.

I wish 10 stars was an option. This would as the absolute best biscotti I've ever had. It was also my first time making it, but definitely not my last.  I'm really glad I listened to other reviews and decreased the flour a bit...just less than a half a cup. Next time, I'll decrease by just a little more than half a cup. Dry Alaskan air made this dough not quite moist enough.  They tasted great plain, but I wanted to pretty them up so I dipped the top half in white almond bark and sprinkled the tops lightly with toasted coconut. They were beautiful and made them taste like gourmet treats.

Increased baking powder to 2 tsp. , and only used 2 - 2 1/2 cups of flour.  I did this because i was following other biscotti recipes I've made that turned out really good with these measurements.

This is a quick and easy Biscotti recipe. It is yummy. I have made it twice. However in taste and texture it screams Home Made. These are not biscotti's to share outside your home with friends, there are more refined recipes on this site AllRecipes.com that you will be more proud of when sharing.

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because I followed instructions to a 'T' and wound up with crumbly dough. It was an easy fix, I just added some water to mine honestly, and it was just fine, but I'm unsure of whether it was an error on the posters' part or if anything else plays into it. I cut back by a half cup on the sugar and these turned out beautiful and semi sweet just as I'd hoped! I didn't have walnuts handy, so no walnuts were added. This could potentially be a great base recipe to work with for different flavors of biscotti like a dark chocolate dipped coconut biscotti (yum!).

A nice variation on biscotti, but I wish it was a smidgeon sweeter.  That was easily rectified by drizzling a little confectioner’s glaze on top and prettied it up too.

I made these for a church picnic and they were very well received.  I saw kids and older adults both enjoying the biscotti.  Great recipe!

This biscotti was one of the best ones I have tried.  It was rich and delicious.  I did add a little extra coconut just because I like it so much.  I also drizzled chocolate over it.  My granddaughters asked for the recipe.  Be careful as it is addicting.
