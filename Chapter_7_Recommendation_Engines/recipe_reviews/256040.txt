My family really enjoyed this dish. It had great flavor and I served it with brown rice. I had never made a curry with tomatoes and cauliflower in it before, but the Hunt's Diced Tomatoes and the fresh cauliflower really made the dish amazing. My husband is already talking about making it again. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. I do however recommend letting the lentils simmer longer at least another ten minutes before adding the coconut milk, carrots, and cauliflower. Because I followed the recipe exactly our lentils were on the crunchy side after cooking for the suggested time. We continued to cook it until the lentils had softened unfortunately the veggies were a little softer then we would have wanted. Even with slightly soft veggies it was still very tasty. It definitely had a small kick of heat, I might leave out the serrano seeds next time I make it.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This was a favorite! I used 2/3 of the can of coconut milk and didn't drain the tomatoes because I saw that too late but otherwise followed the recipe.  For our eating preferences this made 8 servings not 6.  Loved the spicy flavors so much that I ate it with just a piece of pita on the side.  Everyone else had it over rice but not necessary at all.  The cauliflower came out perfectly cooked as did the lentils.  Turns out red lentils are different and we love them.

I didn't add the peppers or peas. I did everything else and it was wonderful. I will make again, I only gave it three stars because I made changes.

This was yummy and great with naan. I used ground ginger, and split red lentils which cooked down and made the sauce, well - saucier! Will make again.

Yum, family liked! Loved having leftovers in the fridge for several days. Did not add salt during cooking so lentils didn't get mushy hooray. Flavor is awesome rich & creamy with the coconut milk. No carrots or peas. Used pearled cauliflower. Will make again.  
Made again; added dash of cloves, used green lentils (more sturdy),  steamed cut up asparagus.

This is good. I added curry 3/4 way through. You could also add spinach at the end with peas or instead of peas. You need a really deep pan for this - it makes a lot!

The taste is okay. The lentils could stand to cook a little more. Interestingly enough, the dish was quite flavorful prior to adding the coconut milk. The milk overpowered the the seasoning. If I make it again I will skip the coconut milk altogether (& the score would go up to 3 or 4).

I couldn't find serrano peppers at the grocery store, so I had to substitute jalapeno peppers instead. I did everything else according to the recipe, except i left out the carrots. This dish was far too bland without the serrano peppers, so next time I will shop around till I find them. I will also add a tablespoon of curry to give it more flavour.

This was delicious.... I did make a few modifications as I usually do. I didn’t brown the cauliflower in advance as I didn’t want it to be too soft - it was cooked perfectly. I added the juice from the tomatoes as I didn’t see that till after the fact as a few others mentioned... but think the added juice helped in cooking the lentils fully. Used Jalapeños as I couldn't find the Serrano peppers. Also used only 3/4 of the coconut milk. This was a great dish and will make it again for sure!

OK, so I had no serrano peppers, used fresh tomatoes instead of canned diced, and had to settle for regular unsweetened coconut milk from a carton instead of the canned. This was SO good I can't imagine how much better the "correct" version will be. Definitely making it again! I stirred in some nonfat plain Greek yogurt, this was just great! I may add a little more spices, but the serranos may make up next time, I will sample it first. I love cauliflower so this will be a favorite bookmarked.

I I added red curry paste to this dish.  I love the heat . If you don’t like the heat so much, reduce the Serrano peppers before adding the red curry paste. It was absolutely delicious!

Delicious. Makes enough to fill a big 4 qt pot. Followed recipe almost exactly. Used one Serrano chili ... Should have used two as recipe calls for. Cooked the lentils for 15 instead of 12 minutes. Lentils were fully cooked but not mushy; they had a nice bite. Highly recommend this.

I didn't have the problem as some others, of the lentils being crunchy. In fact, since I listened to those reviews I cooked them longer and they were a little too mushy. Also, the carrots took much longer then 10 minutes to cook. I had to double the spices since it was bland and I didn't have a pepper so I used some chili flakes. It might have been better with the pepper I don't know.  I did not use the whole can of coconut milk. As others have said, this makes a lot and I didn't even use all the cauliflower!
I may make it again but with some adjustments. Served it over rice.

Like, not love.  I was expecting more like a thai red curry taste bc of the coconut but it’s more like an Indian curry.  I roasted the cauliflower while I prepared everything else and also added chicken because my hubby thinks it’s a snack if no meat is involved.

I cooked longer than recipe and lentils and carrots were still al dente. I would def increase cooking time. I omitted the pepper and my kids LOVED this!! I had a 28oz can of tomatoes and added the whole thing to cut spicyness for the kids as well

I used all fresh ingredients and it came out perfectly. The only thing I did differntly (Just a bit impatient) is I simmered all the vegg’s in the stock then added spices (upped all the spices) and cooked lentils separately. One of my new fav’s for sure.

I followed the recipe as written, although I did forget to drain the tomatoes.  The flavors were good and the heat from the 2 peppers with seeds was not too much.  I should have used my larger saute pan as the vegetables were not cooked evenly following  the times stated in the recipe. I liked the flavor the coconut milk provided and will make this again even though my husband is not a fan of vegetarian dishes.  He did like it although he did not ask for seconds!

Really great flavors! Loved this! My only recommendation is when doing the browning of the cauliflower add some seasoning or don't brown it and cook it later in the sauce so that it picks up some other flavors.

Turns out that 2 Serrano peppers (with seeds) was iver the top of the heat chart for us.
