This is the best recipe!made changes using recipe as base.Used box of spice cake mix instead of vanilla. Added water & oil according to cake mix box. Still added vanilla pudding mix, cup of canned puree pumpkin. I always add 1/2c.sour cream to all my cake recipes makes them extra moist.Didn't add spices since I used spice cake mix. Smelled so good & gave house a wonderful fall smell. Cake was so good & extra moist! My family loved it & begged me to make another. Also, made one for church fall festival. Cake was gone in mins.Got most compliments people were fighting to make sure they got a piece before gone. Needless to say, wasn't enough to go around. Next time I"ll make sure I take 2or3 cakes.For the kids I baked 2 in tube pan. After cooling I turned 1cake out&flipped back over, 2cake I turned out ontop of 1st cake. frosted cake with orange frosting&added green lines down side, made jack-o-latern face outlined with choc. frosting & inside of eyes, nose, mouth with yellow frosting. for stem colored a ice cream cone & turned upside down placed in hole used icing to hold in place. So Cute! All moms thought I'd spent slaving hours&days on!!

Great recipe!  Everyone loved it, even people who did not like pumpkin.  Took longer than 35 min. to cook all the way through, maybe more like 45 min. but otherwise wonderful!

Wow! Totally yummy! Very moist, with a hint of spice and pumpkin. The frosting is very creamy without being too sweet. Made this for my boyfriend's birthday cake and everyone raved about how good it was without being too rich or sweet.

My daughter wanted this for her birthday. I made 2 and there wasn't a drop left. It was sooo good! There wasn't a person in the house that wasn't extremely happy with this. The house smelled so good as it was cooking =) I love pumpkin!

This was a great recipe.  Instead of using the standard 1/2 cup of water, I added some Kahlua & Vodka to the mix (1/4 cup water, 1/8 cup of Kahlua, 1/8 cup of Vodka) and it still came out moist and delicious.  Also, I made 24 cupcakes instead of a cake & baked each pan for about 20 min.  My husband hates sweets, but he enjoyed these pumpkin spice cupcakes!
