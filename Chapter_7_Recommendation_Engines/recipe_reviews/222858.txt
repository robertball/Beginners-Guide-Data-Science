I had to try it, I just had to.  I love bacon and I love popcorn, what can I say?  Usually when I make popcorn it’s because I want a healthy, light snack, so I feel guilty I made this and added quite a bit of bacon.  The bacon flavor just didn’t come through prominently enough for me, and had a greasy taste to it.  I thought it was pretty blah even with sea salt added.  Considering the cost of bacon, I will save it for BLT’s and leave it out of the popcorn.
