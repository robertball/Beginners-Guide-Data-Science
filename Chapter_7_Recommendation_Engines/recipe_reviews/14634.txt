I'm not a cook, nor am I a meatball person, but I loved this recipe. I wasn't going to finely dice up an apple, so I took a soft apple and grated it. Worked perfectly! I suggest mixing up the gravy and sugar before pouring it in. It makes stirring it easier. And it only fed 3 of us. Overall, didn't taste apple...just yumminess! Far better than those jelly meatball recipes. Served over egg noodles and substituted garlic salt. Thanks!

Very tasty meatballs.  I found this recipe, and added it to my "recipe box"... almost backed out of making it because the more I thought about it, the more leery I became at the concept of apples in beef!  I went against my feelings on this one and made it anyway...THE FAMILY LOVED IT, INCLUDING MYSELF.  Even my nine year old, who is the most picky eater in the world  ate it!  I would say this is a definate "keeper" and will be making it again

This was a good recipe.  I do suggest chopping the apples extra fine simply to be able to make the meatballs and making double the gravy.  My whole family loved it.  Thanks!

My family loved these meatballs.  Great with rice and mac salad. I made double the gravy since we like it on the rice.  The sweetness was a nice change.  I like to hear my husband say "MMMMM!  What is this???" and try to figure out the twist in a recipe, which he definately did with this one.  Looks familiar enough that the kids tried it and liked it.  Make sure to chop the apple into FINE chunks or it is a pain to shape the meatballs :o)  A+ recipe!!

Wow! These were really good. I left out the sugar. I chopped the apple and 1/4 onion (didnt have onion salt) in the food processor. I left out the egg. Everybody loved them. I will make again.

Although the meatballs  themselves were good, we found the sweet gravy too odd for our taste.   This might be better without the sugar. I added a little bit of rosemary to the meat since some reviewers thought these meatballs were bland.

I have been making these meatballs since I ran across this recipe on this site about 5 yrs ago.  My family loves them as do my coworkers when we have pitch ins. I sometimes make them with pineapple and almost always add cinnamon as well.  Thanks Christing for dreaming this up.

Everyone (even the picky one) liked this. I also grated the apple and omitted the sugar in the gravy. I will make this again since it was a nice change from other ground beef dishes.

Really, really delicious. I left out the egg only because I didn't have one and couldn't be bothered to run to the store. I was worried that they wouldn't hold together, but they did. I also shredded onion while I was shredding the apple and mixed it all together. I am not a stellar cook, so it could just have been me, but it took me an hour to make these with apple chopping, mixing, making the meatballs, browning them, and the making the gravy and simmering. It was worth it.

This recipe was easy. I used seasoned bread crumbs which added more flavor and grated the apple. It was served over egg noodles and topped with a tablespoon of sour cream....I would make again.

We loved the gravy but felt the meatballs were lacking a stronger flavor although they were still pretty good. Next time I will add more egg. I did add 1 tsp of all spice and around 1 tsp of cinnamon maybe more, did add rosemary but didn't have much. The gravy we used a brown gravy mix that MUST be doubled. Didn't have any brown sugar so I eyeballed some honey, cinnamon and a bit of dashida(korean beef stock stuff). Served with Penne and stuffing - to hubbys request. Needs to be served with pasta and some veggie with good texture(not soft). Maybe a salad or something. Will definitely make again.

I made these following the recipe exactly and they were too sweet.  I added a cup of crushed French fried onions (using four pounds of meat for a party)  and the second batch was perfect!!!!!!!!!   Very fun and easy to make.

I love the meat with apples for this time of year. I want to make this in advance for traveling. Can I freeze it in the gravy or should I wait to make the gravy when I get there?

This was a great one!  I do not make meatballs very often because I cannot seem to find a recipe the family likes enough to eat again.  This one did the trick!
