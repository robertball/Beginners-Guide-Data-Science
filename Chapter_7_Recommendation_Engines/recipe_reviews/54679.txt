These potatoes were yummy!  Here's what I did...  I scrubbed three potatoes, poked holes, and microwaved them for 5 minutes to get them started and to save time in the oven.  I put the olive oil in a baggie and rolled them around in it (careful, they were hot!), then rolled them in some kosher salt on a plate.  I used my finger to evenly distribute the salt so it wasn't too clumpy.  Then I baked the potatoes at 350 degrees for 40-45 minutes - no foil, just right on the rack.  I did put a cookie sheet underneath and I'm glad I did because it caught a bunch of oil & salt the dripped off.  When they were done, we loaded them up with butter, sour cream, and a little pepper (my hubby also added bacon bits).  They were really good!  My husband even ate the skin and he never eats the skin from baked potatoes.  I'll definitely make these again!

I think the oven temperature needs to be a little higher or the potatoes should be much smaller.  I used what I considered to be a medium potato but it was still a little firmer than I would have preferred.  It was still tasty though.  I found it to be easier to rub the potato with oil by placing it in a bag, pouring the oil in, and rubbing through the bag.  No greasy fingers that way!

Love baking potatoes this way. I usually have large potatoes so I have to bake them a long time. I usually have the oven on 350 or 400 degrees depending on how much time I have for them to bake. Baking them longer (2.5 hours or so) at 300 is great, but I usual don't have that kind of time. I coat these with the oil, and then generously sprinkle crushed sea salt and then sprinkle garlic powder on them. Of course, we love garlic, so this is yummy to us. Our family then top these a variety of ways.   Oh, I put these directly on the rack in the oven and have a drip pan on the next rack down to catch anything. This works well for me. These are so delicious!

I make baked potatoes like this all the time.  They're a huge hit.  I'd go for closer to 375 Farenheit, for about an hour, for a large baking potato, and I second the use of kosher salt.  Also, for neat presentation, prick the potato in a line lengthwise across the top of the potato with a fork after it's done, and smack the two ends together.  The potato will pop open along this line, revealing its fluffy-snow insides!  Top with cheese, sour cream, a little butter, chives, sauteed mushrooms and onions, salsa, or whatever tickles your fancy.

For those who don't want to use the oven, these bake in the microwave beautifully.  After scrubbing the skin clean, I pierce the potatoe, generously rub olive oil or canolla oil and sprinkle kosher salt and/or garlic powder all over the potatoes before placing them into the microwave on a paper towel. Then I cover them with a dry paper towel and on top of that I place a couple of wet paper towels.  Bake on high for 10 to 20 minutes depending on size and number of potatoes.
Remove top paper towels, sprinkle more salt/garlic if desired,turn potatoes over and cook another 5 to 10 minutes as needed.  The skins are always delicious, tender and crispy. I often make twice-baked or stuffed potatoes this way, with a variety of ingredients in the "stuffing".

Simply delicious!!  Poking holes in the potatoes, adding the olive oil over the skin, and sprinkling some kosher salt on top is definitely the way I'm going to make all our baked potatoes from now on (with all our typical add-ins, not what the recipe calls for)!  I always ate the skins before, but not because I thought they tasted good or anything.  However, the skins are worth eating with this recipe!!  I did change the temperature of the oven to anywhere between 350 to 400 degrees (depending if I'm making something else or what not) and they are always done in about 60 minutes.  Definitely worth trying, as I doubt you will be disappointed!!  :)

I usually microwave my potatoes just to save time, but in truth, these are so much better.  I did cheat because I used huge potatoes and microwaved for about 10 minutes then cooked in the oven.  They came out perfect. Also, I used table salt, but you really need to go with a course salt like Kosher salt.  Topped with Garlic Butter (also off this site) and sour cream.

Great recipe for classic comfort food! I haven't done this in years, as I'm so used to doing them on the grill, or cheating and doing them in the microwave! But, my husband really wanted that "old school" way of a baked potato from the oven tonight so I thought I'd indulge him. It was soooo good - especially with all the fixen's: butter, salt, pepper, bacon bits, chives, and a little sour cream! Simply perfect!

Easy.  I love baked potatoes that you get at the restaurant but I could not get the same taste with the potatoes that I did at home, until now.  I was very pleased, added butter and sour cream and I was in heaven.

Perfect Potatoes!  We like to use Sea Salt.  Tip to figure out if a potato is fully cooked:  drop it on the counter or stovetop.  If it bounces it is not done baking.  If it doesn't bounce it is ready to add your favorite toppings.  We like sour cream, and bacon in addition to the cheese and butter listed here.

It's hard to go back to any other method once you've had baked potatoes like this. A local up-scale eatery upped the ante on these by preparing a rub containing kosher salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder and a small amt of WHITE SUGAR. Rubbed over the olive oil/ butter coating and cooked at hi-temp, this creates a caramelized, very crispy shell that is fantastic for special occasions.

Loved you posted how to cook a baked potato properly. All my life I believed you had to wrap them in foil, until I visited the Potato Museum outside of Pocatello, Idaho. Foil was a decoration that restaurants added later, and will make your baker gummy inside. They suggest washing the potato well, rubbing oil or butter on the outside, and bake a med potato at 350 degrees for an hour. Test by gently squeezing the sides for give. If you're ever up that way, don't miss this awesome little museum, they have signs all over that say "FREE TATORS FOR OUTA STATERS!" and they do serve you the best baked potato you have ever experienced in your life !

It's, you know, a baked potato. But a REALLY good one. I used Kosher salt on mine and was pretty generous with the olive oil. I love the crispy skin, and the inside was pretty fluffy but not dried out. 

I had some pretty big potatoes, so I upped the temp to 385 and just let them go until they were done (per the time-honored squish-test); for me it was just under 2 hours.

My kids were all over it, too, so I guess this one's a winner!

**Added later - my sister reminded me about the baked potatoes from a steak house she served at years ago: coated in freakin' BACON GREASE, fresh ground pepper and kosher salt. They were good. I mean GOOOD. Try it if you dare.

I liked the skin on this, however, next time I will use butter flavored pam vs. the olive oil, & use just a sprinkle of salt.  The inside came out perfect, I topped it w/ cheese dipping sauce (on this site) & broccoli, mmmmmm.  Thanks CURLEEGIRLEE ;)

This is how I make my baked potatos after asking a restaurant how they get their potatos so fluffy inside.

They said the salt (I use a course salt) brings out the water in the potato - so it is fluffy.  

I do sometimes wrap in foil to bake.

The title of this recipe is perfect - it IS the perfect baked potato, especially when you do what the top reviewer suggested and nuke it first for 5 minutes, then bake at 350 for 45 minutes.  Perfect, creamy consistency.  No other way to bake a potato for me in future!

I thought a baked potato was the same regardless of how it was cooked.  This recipe changed my mind!  It flavors the whole potato.  My guests didn't know that I made them "special" but kept saying how much better they were than normal.  I had huge potatoes, so I cooked them at 300 for 2 1/2 hrs.  If they are big, start them early because you can always keep them warm in the oven.  Also, I don't like crispy skin potatoes, so I followed the instructions but wrapped them in foil individually to cook.  Awesome!

Absolutely delicious! After heating in microwave for five minutes, I poked holes in each BAKING POTATO, "greased" in a ziploc bag with olive oil, and then lightly rolled on a plate of Kosher salt. I put in a 8 x 8 greased baking dish at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Served with sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese, and bacon.

I always make my potatoes like this except instead of olive oil, I rub my potatoes with a "little" bacon grease not a lot.[ and the audience gasps ]  The skin crisps up and it tastes delicious.  I also poke holes in my taters with one of my metal skewers.  I also cook my sweet potatoes the same way.

This recipe reminded me why it is so much better to bake potatoes in the oven than in the microwave!

Also - I make these in batches when I get potatoes on sale from the store. I keep a couple in the fridge to heat up the next day or two, and I use the rest to make potato skins, twice-baked potatoes or hash browns. Potato skins can easily be frozen and cooked later if you have a small family like I do and you make too many!

I guess my potatoes were too large, but this took a lot longer than what the recipe called for.  Also, there was oil burned drips in the bottom of my oven, yuck!***  Update 10/13/12 .. this worked perfect on my medium potatoes and I put some tin foil down on the bottom, no mess, the salt was perfect.  Sorry for the bad review before, as it was my fault.

FANTASTIC!!  I made these last night for the Fiance and I to go along with our NY Strip Steak and haricot verts.  This was the first time he ate the entire potato (usually I "bake" them in the microwave)!  Scrubbed the skins first then rubbed olive oil and kosher salt on them.  350 oven for about 1 hour results in a perfect baked potato; crisp golden skin on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside!  I topped with butter, shredded cheese, crumbled bacon, sour cream, and fresh cracked pepper!  YUM!

These potatoes turned out great! It was a small mess trying to get those darned potatoes lightly coated with olive oil (First I tried a paper towel but ended up using my hands) and next time, I think I'll take MC_MA_OF_3's advise and used butter flavored Pam...I'll spray it on those guys! Ofcourse, we like our potatoes loaded so we topped them we cheese, chives, sour cream...the works! Went well with our dinner (in fact, some of the gravy from the main meal tasted well on them too!). I never added anything to the skins before...but never again will I leave them plain either! Thanks for sharing!

Yum!  Put olive oil in bag.  Pricked potatoes with fork and put in bag one at a time.  Sprinkled garlic powder and kosher salt on skin and placed right on edged cookie sheet.  I baked at 375 for 60 min and they were perfect.  Thanks for a great way to season the skin!

CURLEEGIRLEE has figured out the secret to the world's best baked potato here. There just seems to be something about rubbing the skin with olive oil... either that or I musta been really, really hungry. I also used kosher salt. Whatever, it was well worth the wait. This is now the only method we will be using for our baked spuds, and thanks!

My potatoes were apparently larger than medium size, because 90 min on 300 was definitely not enough to cook them. They were still hard. I ended up turning the oven temp up to 350 and cooking them 30 more minutes. I love the olive oil and salt, but I think the temp and cook time in this recipe should be tweaked.

TIP: Put the potato directly on the oven rack. I always bake at 400 for 1 hour. Makes the skins crispy and delicious. Kosher salt works best.

Terrific potatoes!  They were just right on the inside.  We put on an au jous-type sauce from a cube steak (quick cube steaks from food.com w/ 2 gravy pkgs and mushrooms added) recipe I made and some Bill's Blue Cheese Dressing (awesome) that we put on too.  It was so wonderful that we ate every bite, skin and all!

I know this is silly, but with all of my cooking and baking experience, I can't bake a potato to save my life! Potatoes are my least favourite vegetable... but my husband is a Brit, and this is obviously a staple for him.  He loved this recipe and I even enjoyed it! Thanks!

This is the closest to a restaurant baked potato I have evr cooked, only the skin was better!  Because my potatoes were large I turned the oven up to 375 and cooked them for 90 minutes.  Tey were fluffy and perfect inside.

I made loaded baked potatoes with butter, sour cream, cheddar cheese, pulled pork, bacon, barbeque sauce and scallions.

I never thought I'd be following a recipe to bake a potato, but I made this recipe using garlic salt instead of regular salt and I baked these at my usual temperature of 400 degrees for one hour.  I really don’t think a 300 degree oven is necessary and it takes just way too long.  I garnished these with green onion tops.

I baked them at 375 degrees for one hour, and I used corn oil instead of olive oil.  They came out great!  My family loved them.  I'll definitely be making these very often.

I have always just used aluminum foil to keep moisture inside the potato, which is very unhealthy.  I did it this way and they came out so perfect and fluffy.  My husband and I were so impressed.  I did put a pan covered in foil at the bottom of the oven to catch the drippings and boy I'm glad I did.  Messy, but so worth it.  Thanks!!!

Don't know why this works so well, but it does!  Even tastes better than grilled 'baked' potatoes.  By using smaller potatoes, if you're having a larger meal with other sides, you can greatly reduce the cooking time.  I also found that if I start the potatoes early and then wrap them in foil when they come out of the oven as I'm preparing the rest of the meal, they will retain a ton of moisture and because super moist!  If they cool off, just throw them back into the oven, wrapped in foil, for about the last ten minutes of cooking time to finish your meal.

I rubbed the potatoes with Roasted Garlic Olive Oil and used kosher salt. Loved the salt added to the skin. I microwaved the potatoes for a few minutes to get the cooking started, then put them in a plastic bag and rubbed them with the olive oil.  I roasted them at 375, because 300 seemed too low. They took an hour. We used these for our Meatless Monday dinner and  filled them with lots of goodies. I will bake potatoes this way from now on.

I think the baking time is off, but the preparation method is perfect! :) I usually just pierce and bake, but we tried with the olive oil and salt this time on the skin and it was wonderful! I bake mine (yukon golds, medium sized) at 375 for 1 hour and they come out perfect. We top ours with a little s&p, sour cream and cheddar cheese. Yum!

The perfect potato is right! I just discovered this on my own. I use sea salt and up the oven to 425 for one hour - makes a perfect crunchy skin and a beautiful, fluffy inside!  I use the large baking potatoes.  Mmmmmm - heaven !!!

Really delicious potato! Seems silly but I have gotten into the habit of nuking my potatoes and could not remember how long I needed to cook them in the oven. I microwaved for 5 min as another reveiwer suggested and baked for 45 min at 350. It was so delicious my husband ate the skin (he never does that)

This was by far the best baked potato ever! I did cheat a little though. I cooked it on HIGH for 5 minutes in the microwave. I mixed olive oil with coarse salt in a ziploc bag and mixed it all together. Then I placed the baked potato on the oven rack for 35-45 minutes on 350 degrees. Delicisio!

To cut down on the mess, put the potato in a freezer bag and oil it that way. Then place oiled potatoes on a cookie sheet and lightly sprinkle Kosher or Sea salt all over it. The salt and oil add a nice texture and flavor to the skin, why the inside stays light and fluffy. Top with your favorite combination.

This is an excellent way to bake a potato.  The flesh inside was SO tender!  I normally baked mine rubbed with olive oil and kosher salt but not at this low temp or for this long.  My skin was crisp, not overly though and like I said the insides were oh, so good!  I love the tip somegave many reviews ago about putting the potato into a plastic bag and then the oil and coating it that way, great idea thank you!!  I did cook mine at 325° as I was also slow roasting some plum tomatoes at the same time.  Thanks again!

We like our potatoes with very crispy skins.  This just barely cooked the potato and left the skin soft. We cook ours at a minimum of 450deg., for an hour. First they are rubbed in olive oil with chopped Rosemary and Kosher salt and allowed to sit around 10 minutes prior to baking. The skins are wonderfully crisp.  For special holiday dinner we add creme frache with a tablespoon of very good caviar.  Along with melted unsalted butter this is really great.

I had it in the oven for 2 hours and they were still hard! I ended up getting frustrated and sticking them in the microwave at the end.

My potatoes were HUGE, it would have taken 4 hours at 300 degrees! That's just not practical, so I took the advice of the Idaho Potato Council and cooked them at 450 degrees and it still took an hour and a half. However the salt gave the potato skins a nice taste.

Excellent baked potatoes!  I am very generous with the olive oil, rotating the potato and using a brush to coat well before baking.  I also use fresh ground sea salt... mmm, can't beat this flavor.  Sometimes I sprinkle a tad of garlic powder on prior to baking.  After baked, I usually make a cut like a cross and open the potato like a flower, add a large pat of butter, the cheddar cheese, bacon crumbles, sour cream, then salt and pepper to taste.

My family really liked this recipe.  I made a whole 5lb. bag of russett potatoes (which was a total of 10).  I put olive oil in a small bowl and used my silicone brush to put the oil on them.  Then I just salted the potatoes to my taste.  They baked a little less time than the 90 minutes (propably 10 min less).  They were great.  We really never ate baked potatoes in our house but we will now.  We just added butter and sour cream to our potatoes accordingly.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

You wouldn't think you'd need a recipe to make a baked potato, but this came out so much better than mine usually do!  It was fluffy and had crispy flavorful skin.  Very good recipe, I'll make them this way from now on.  Thanks!

It was so hot that I didn't want my oven on for 90 minutes so I nuked the potatoes for 5 minutes on each side (I didn't want to deal w/ trying to oil & salt a hot potato so I did it before I nuked them) & then cooked them at 325 for about 30 minutes. I stuffed them w/ Zesty Slow Cooker Chicken Barbecue (from this site), cheddar cheese & onions.

with the exception of the twice baked potato (also on allrecipes), this is the only way i do a baked potato now.  just cut an X on top (but not all the way) once baked and give the base a squeeze and out comes the light & fluffy potato.  then top with whatever your heart desires...

I have to disagree. There is no way a nuked spud can come out like this, not even close. This recipe is so obvious when you think about it yet I had been baking mine in foil all this time. Thanks so much. I am making some tonight to go with my MarketDay roast beef.

This is my first review & it's on something as simple as a baked potato. 
However, this is a great recipe.  
I like to eat the skins & cooked this way they are perfect.  The insides are nice & fluffy.  The timing is perfect & worth the wait.   This would be a great base recipe to use to try other variations.

My potatoes turned out great!  Loved the olive oil/salt rub.  I ended up stuffing my potatoes with grilled chicken cubes, ranch dressing, potato (used the inside of the baked potatoes), green onions, butter, and parsley with a cheese sauce topping and brocolli on the side.  They tasted wonderful.  My husband isn't a potato fan, but he raved on these.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe for baked potatoes! We had a "Potato Dinner" consisting of baked potatoes and lots of toppings. Such as cubed ham, cheese, sour cream, butter, chives, and what ever we could come up with. It was great for a change! We will have this again for sure!!!

This really was the perfect baked potato!  I didn't add the cheese, but the olive oil and salt rub made big difference.  The potato was light and fluffy.  And the potato skin was delicious.

This recipe is misleading in terms of time and temperature. The potatoes needed an additional hour at 300 degrees or the temperature needs to be increased. Every review says something to this effect.  I read the reviews on recipes which I have never heard of. Guess I should have for baked potatoes too. Frustrating that after all of these reviews, it has not been fixed.

These are the only way I make baked potatoes. I poke holes and roll the potatoes around in olive oil and salt. I use regular table salt and they come out great. I bake at 350 for one hour and they come out perfect every time. We top with cheese and sour cream or butter . Great and simple recipe

Follow the initial steps; piercing is good, to allow moisture to escape, but just do it right before they go in the oven. No need to measure olive oil - just pour some in one hand, or a folded paper towel, and rub each potato. You do not want them dripping in oil. 
Put rock salt on a flat pan - place your pierced potatoes on top of the rock salt. I prefer lining the pan with tin foil, because after baking, it's very easy to pick the foil up and put the rock salt in a container to use the next time! 
Rock salt helps draw moisture out of the potato. Use your rock salt for several batches, until it has become very dark. If you really think you need extra salt, sprinkle a tiny bit over the top of each one; most people don't need the extra salt, especially if using cheese, bacon, etc., all of which have salt in them! Instead of a 300f oven, I use a hotter temp. Forget the time schedule, as that varies with the size of potato - so with LARGE baking potatoes, for example, they may warm your house up with yummy smells, at 400f, for 1 1/2 hours! Love that! To make sure they are done, use a hot pad to gently massage your largest potato. The massaging also helps release remaining moisture from the potato. If it is soft all around, it's done! Rub off any remaining rock salt from the bottom - you do not want to eat it!! - and save for next time.
Yes, as some commenters have said, if you are really in a hurry, potatoes can be microwaved a few minutes prior to baking. But I recommend saving

This is by far the BEST way to bake a potato. I have done this every time I make them now and they are delicious. The skin is so good. Usually I eat the skin but it has never been as good as this. My husband loves them too!

I'm really surprised at how good this was. I usually grill my potatoes. I'm not much of a salt person so I used a coarse sea salt. I thought potatoes needed to be cooked at a high temp, but you've proved me wrong, we loved these. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I like for the skin of my potatoes to be crispy and with this recipe they weren't.  The skin was very soft and almost soggy.  I made these exactly as the recipe states.

You need to use bacon grease instead of olive oil. That why they call it BACON-GREASE.

Being pregnant and needing to gain weight (heathfully), I wanted to try to incorporate baked potatoes into my diet more regularly. I am of the belief that microwaving a potato is a far cry from a real baked potato, so I read countless articles online on how to make the perfect oven-baked potato. To my surprise, many recipes were drawn-out and tedious. I tried this one last night and it's perfect without being too time-consuming. I scrubbed my potatoes, rubbed them with olive oil, popped them in the oven at 350 (rather than 300) right on the rack, and they came out perfectly. Baked potatoes shouldn't be rocket science and this recipe is spot-on. Thanks!

you can microwave potatoes (w/o oil and seasonsoning - just make sure to poke holes) for about 2-3 minutes a side, then put into 425 degree preheted oven for about 20-30 minutes - no longer - to finish cooking and crisp skin.  The potato flesh is moist and tender and the skin is absolutely delicious and crunchy-crisp!  It turns out more moist using large red-skinned new potatoes!!

My husband flipped over these baked potatoes ~ he ate the skin and everything! Thanks to reviewer "Melissa B" I was able to make the most incredible baked potato in less than an hour. I also nuked for 5 minutes, rolled in olive oil and kosher salt and then baked for 40 minutes and they were awesome!

I made this recipe last night to use the baked potatoes in the Baked Potato Soup.  Just have to say the potatoes came out perfect and were the best baked potato I have ever eaten.  Thanks for sharing!!  I put each potato in a sandwich bag and drizzled the olive oil in the bag and rubbed on all sides.  It was a great way to get the olive oil on all of the potato without getting a big mess all over the place.  Will be making these baked potatoes often!!

SO GOOD.  i followed someone's advice and put the potato in the microwave for 5 minutes first, and then putting it in the oven for 40 minutes at 350 degrees. Instead of using salt I used garlic salt and it was SO GOOD, it was like eating cheesy mashed potatoes out of a large garlic french fry.

These are awesome!I followed suggestions and microwaved for 10 minutes first. Another suggestion was to put oil in baggie and shake potato in it. Then roll potato on plate with kosher salt. This worked out nicely. I also ended up baking for about 1.25 hours and they came out nice and tender.

Great basic recipe for a baked potato.  The skin gets really nice and crispy and the insides are fluffy.  I will never microwave again.  Perfect with butter, pepper and a little sour cream.

This is a pretty darn good baked potato. I admit, I usually go the easy route and nuke my potatoes. If I have time to stick them in the oven for an hour though, I will definitely make them this way. The skin was nice and crisp. I rolled the potatoes in coarse sea salt, which was perfect. I always eat my baked potatoes with shredded cheese, sour cream, and a little ranch dressing. Mmmm!

This recipe ROCKS. I use the plastic bag method of applying the olive oil and use kosher salt to coat the potatoes. We love to cut up the skin and eat it mashed up and mixed with whatever fillings we add. so that the salt is dispersed throughout the potato. My kids love to request a "baked potato bar" for dinner so they can customize their own. We serve them with  cheese, real bacon bits, sour cream, and  butter. Great for a cool day to warm you up!

These were very good. I love the idea of seasoning the potato w/ salt before cooking. It really makes the skin taste so much better. My only problem was that the skins weren't as crispy as I would like. Possibly because I partially cooked them in the microwave first to cut down on cooking time. Next time I'll do them entirely in the oven to see if it that makes a difference. Otherwise, the best recipe I've tried so far! Yum!

I am a huge lover a baked potatoe skin!  And these are perfect!  As the others have said I highly recommend you microwave them for 10 min and then preheat your oven at 400 and bake for 45ish mnutes!  The skin is perfect.  Thanks!

I made baked potatoes following this recipe with a couple modifications that another reviewer had shared. After cleaning them I put them in the microwave for 10 minutes total (I flipped them half way through), and then baked them for 40 minutes in a oven that had been preheated to 400 degrees. These were delicious, I will definitely be making these again.

Although I liked the olive oil/salt rub, these potatoes didn't turn out as crisp on the outside as I would have liked. I followed the recipe exactly and my potatoes were a medium size... so I'm unsure why mine weren't very crisp.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I usually bake my potatoes at about 425 degrees for 45-60 minutes or so, and get a nicely crispy skin and fluffy insides. From all the kudos given this recipe I thought it might be an improvement. I followed the recipe as written, but left it in the oven an extra 15 minutes because the potatoes were bigger. I found that the skin was soft instead of crispy. I cannot see adding extra calories with the oil and extra salt, to a recipe that isn't as good as I usually make. Sorry!

I have used this recipe before, and given the time it takes, this is the way I like to make my baked potatoes. I use veg. oil to coat instead of olive oil, and sea salt for the salt. Made this for Sunday lunch for my the in-laws paired with fried chicken, a green salad, and a version of Cheddar Bay Biscuits. Very good comfort food, thanks for posting!

Good recipe, a good standard, but if your potatoes have any kind of size on them, it will take longer than 90 minutes to bake at 300 degrees.

I first reviewed this in September 2006.  I've made these dozens of times since, both in the oven and on the BBQ.  Last night they were an easy and tasty addition to our romantic steak dinner.  The only change I made was now I rub the potatoes with garlic powder and salt.  One more new edit, 6 years after first trying these.  It is still the only way we bake potatoes, but after rubbing them with EVOO and sea salt, I give myself a 1 minute manicure by rubbing my hands and cuticles with that for a minute and then lightly rinse and pat dry.  It feels amazingly good.  I use the EVOO and salt on a regular basis, not just when we make these potatoes.

This is the only way I will make baked potatoes from now on.  The only thing is, your recipe didn't specify whether to use foil or not.  I did, as I was afraid the olive oil would drip off into my oven.  They still turned out perfectly.  BTW, I cooked at 350 as I was cooking a meatloaf and they were done in an hour.  Perfect, not too dry, and the skin was awesome.  Update:  I can't tell you how many people I've impressed with this recipe.  And how many times I've eaten dried out baked potatoes at other people's houses or even when going out to eat.  Trust me - once you use this recipe - you'll never go back to the old way again.  I've got my kids to love eating the skin - where all the fiber and good stuff is - with this recipe.  Just try to use uniformly sized potatoes for the best results.

I rarely - if ever - have my oven on for 90+ mins, and I certainly wouldn't have it on that long just for a potato. What I do is to prepare the spud according to the recipe, but then I microwave it on kitchen paper for 2 or 3 mins, then turn it over for another 2 or 3 mins; it cooks just enough to have a bit of 'give' but not to be soft. Then I put it in the oven along with whatever else I'm cooking. Perhaps the end result isn't 100% as good as doing it in the oven the whole time, but it's definitely a great compromise.

Until now, I've never been able to make a decent baked potato. They were either too dry, too overdone, too underdone, etc....Now that I've made this recipe, I will never bake potatoes any other way! I didn't measure the oil & salt, I just brushed the oil on one side of the potato with a pastry brush & then used my hands to coat the rest of the potato. Then, sprinkle on a little salt, rub, & voila!! The best. If you're not a potato peel eater, you soon will be!

Wow! I upped the cooking temp to 350, and cut down the time to an hour. I also added a little red pepper, black pepper, and thyme to the olive oil/salt mixture. This was definitely the perfect potato.

I must have used too big of potatoes, as they were not done.  Wish they were, though, because I wanted the result of the other reviews.

Finally, a recipe for "Baked Potatoes" that is really a recipe for baked potatoes.  It drives me crazy when I order a baked potato and it comes wrapped in foil.  A foil-wrapped potato is a STEAMED potato, not a BAKED potato. I always eat the skins and they are always crispy when baked 'naked'.  Loved this recipe.

Another good tip is to coat the potatoes with olive oil and salt and letting sit overnight.  The salt draws the moisture from the potato making it more fluffy.

I really like this recipe, I used what I thought were medium potatoes but they took about 2 hours to cook on 375 F. I also used sea salt to coat the potatoes and threw some bacon in the oven the last 15 minutes. When they were done I did as another review suggested and with a fork poked a horizontal line across the top of the potato and popped it open, it was hot and fluffy I added butter, shredded cheese, sour cream and bacon cut into bits. Delicious !

My market had HUGE baking potatoes so mine took a bit longer to bake and I overdid it just a bit but the inside was very fluffy and nice.  The outside did not get crunchy though.  Thanks!

This took about 15 min longer than stated at 300*. I only used half the salt and used kosher and wrapped these individuallly in aluminum foil before baking. Easy and tasty overall. The next time I would increase the oven to 350 and bake this along with a main dish.

My perfect baked potato: I poke holes and wrap potatoes and cook at 450 for 20 minutes and then microwave for 3 min and let rest. Tastes like a baked potato as opposed to a microwaved potato with half the cook time.

This recipe has become a staple in our house, though the potatoes needed a higher oven temp.  I bake at 400 for an hour.. and skip the cheese. These potatoes are delicious on their own.

Yummy, delicious, forget the steak house.  Bake your own at home!  The only change I made was, after preparing the potato, microwaving it on high for 5 minutes and then popping it in the oven for 45 minutes (tested with a fork to make sure it was tender).

Wonderful and easy!! Right on the rack-no foil, but did put a try underneath to catch any drippings. I might microwave the potatoes next time to cut down on baking time, but otherwise, really delicious!

Proof that delicious & satisfying need not be complicated. Easy weeknight meal that fills up the whole family! Our favorite topping - heat a can of no-salt diced tomatoes, diced green chiles, and chopped deli ham slices in a small skillet; spoon into split potatoes.  Probably don't even need any butter - YUM!

Easy and Delicious.  I opted to not use the cheddar cheese and instead just had cracked pepper, a little butter and some bacon.  Yummy!

This was great!  My husband's friends and brother were here from out of state, they just raved about the baked potatoes. Kids loved the fact that it smelled like french fries cooking.

Thank you for reminding me that potatoes in the oven really are much better than in the microwave. I put them in the microwave for 5 minutes so I could cut down on my oven time.  Baked at 350 for 45 minutes.  Excellent, light and fluffy!

This is the perfect baked potato.  I have made these tons of times, and my best advice is to follow the recipe as is.  I've played around with temp/baking time when I have time constraints, but they never come out as good as when I follow the recipe.  As some other reviewers suggest, I also coat the potatoes with the oil in a plastic bag.

This is the only way I make my baked potatoes now. I use sea salt instead of table salt, and when in a pinch, I've had equally good results cooking the potatoes on 400 for 45 minutes. I think the olive oil and the salt are what makes this recipe better than the competition.

This is the way we bake our potatoes too. The combination of the oil, salt and actual baking is what makes it a sure winner. I have in a pinch 'baked' potatoes in the microwave. But it still does not give the same texture to the fluffy insides or the baked part of the skins. On occasion we have Baked Potat Night. It is where we have large baked potatoes as a main dish along with a salad, and we have bowls of favorite toppings like butter, cheeses, sour cream, bacon, broccoli, onions, and chives to suit everyones tastes. A meal in itself.

I'm not the biggest baked potato fan, but these were good. I took reviewers' advice and microwaved for ten minutes after piercing and then added the oil and salt and baked for about 50 minutes in the oven. The potatoes were soft and creamy - loved by the family, and great for a baby too.

This recipe is awesome!  Much better than the normal way to cook them without oil/salt.  Just one word of caution, I put alum foil on the very bottom of oven (we live in Germany with TINY ovens) and the dripping oil smoked ALOT.  I was nervous, but they still turned out awesome.

Very good, but needs higher temp or longer cooking time.  I chose 350 degrees for 90 minutes. The skin was not as crispy as I would have liked.

This recipe makes a lovely baked potato with a thicker skin. I did follow other users' advice and cooked at a slightly higher temperature (about 350) for the same amount of time. Honestly, once they're cooked, they'll keep in the oven until your other dishes are ready. It keeps them hot and will finish off any 'firmness' left.

A very classic baked potato recipe. Simple and delicious. We like sour cream and chives with this too.
I also baked this recipe a little less than the 90 mins~~but I guess it all depends on the size of the spud!

Finally...the PERFECT recipe!!  I hurried the baking time by first putting medium sized potatoes (holes poked) in micro for 5 minutes as suggested.  Followed recipe, but sprinkled onion powder on top also before baking.  Baked at 350 for just over an hour.  Cut x's on top and dropped a bit of butter and cheese into the well.  Mixed with a fork and heaped fresh chives on top.  Everyone loved these...should be in every recipe box!!

The best baked potato ever! We increased the baking temperature to 325 degrees, and were so happy with the results. Butter, sour cream, and lots of freshly ground pepper made this perfect comfort food on a cold winter night. Thank you so much for this great recipe!

I really used this recipe as a reference for how long to bake a potato.  I always forget!  I didn't have as much time though so I increased the temp. to compensate.  The olive oil/salt combo on the skin didn't do much for me.....wasn't bad or anything, just tasted like a normal baked potato!  Next time I will make sure to try sea salt and see if that makes a difference.  Had all the goodies available to load it up - butter, salt, sour cream, bacon bits, shredded cheddar cheese.  Served with green bean casserole and london broil steak (excellent recipe from this website - see my review).  DELICIOUS dinner!

Who knew?!?  We used huge spuds so we had to increase temp to 350 and time to 2 hours but they were the best.  Used crushed sea salt, onion powder and garlic powder to create the delicious crispy skin - and I don't usually eat the skin.  The best by far.

Great recipe, thanks for sharing.  Faster and quicker way to bake potatoes is to follow her instructions, pierce potato, drizzle in olive oil then microwave according to your microwave.  I usually nuke 3 med. potatoes for 5 minutes, then pull them out and wrap in foil.  By the time I am done with preparing my meal, the potatoes have steamed in the foil and are ready to eat.  Same great baked taste with less wait!

My family had always made microwave baked potatoes, so this time I wanted an oven baked potato. I have to say it was delicious. I did all the seasoning the same, but because I used jumbo potatoes I cooked them at 300 temperature for 2 - 2 1/2 hours and covered with foil. Delicious, I never want a microwave potato again

This recipe didn't work for me.  I baked the potatoes for 90 minutes at 300F and they come out completly raw still.  I think you're supposed to bake the potatoe at 425F for an hour.

Perfect Baked Potato Haiku: "Hmm, what's 'medium'? Guess my potatoes were large, cuz they weren't done." Followed the recipe as written and was disappointed to find that after 90 min. at 300 deg., my potatoes were still pretty hard, so due to having the rest of dinner ready, I had to zap mine in the microwave for 5-6 min. to get them finished the rest of the way, which kinda-sorta killed the "baked" part w/ the crispy skin that I like so much. Don't get me wrong - a microwaved potato is still good once it has cheese and butter on it, but I guess this was one of those instances where I should've gone w/ my gut about how one person's medium is another's small and what-not, and gone w/ a higher temp. Still a tasty potato nonetheless!

I've been making baked potatoes like this for years. The only change is that I bake them for 1 hour at 400 degrees. As an added little tidbit, after slathering the oil and kosher salt on the potatoes, I "wash" my hands with the remaining salt and oil. The salt exfoliates and the oil smoothes my hands. After I wash the residue off, I use hand cream and my hands are smooth and soft.

Great basic recipe.  I tossed my (scrubbed) medium-to-small-ish potatoes in a gallon sized ziplock bag with a couple tablespoons olive oil and passed on the salt (mostly because Hubby isn't a fan).  I put the potatoes right on the oven rack with a large sheet of foil underneath to catch any wayward drops of oil.  I did end up turning up the heat on my oven to 350 right about halfway through the cooking time - but they ended up perfect.  The family gobbled them up.

Excellent base recipe. I used the variation tip to slice on the top and stuffed it with a combination of sour cream, milk, butter, s&p and marble cheese. My hubby loved it! Definitely a keeper! Thanks.

This is good but instead of a potato, try it with a chicken.  And instead of baking, try cutting the chicken up into pieces and frying it hot in shortening.  Do not omit the salt as it is a necessary ingredient in this baked potato recipe.  Yum yum yum.  Try the chicken with baked potato on the side

This took waaay longer then stated it would in the recipe. I even bought special "baking" potatoes. I think the oven should be up higher like 350 degrees. Overall by the time the potatoes were finally cooked it was alright. Next time i will try with different potatoes as well.

I recalculated the recipe for 4 potatoes.  You will need to extend the baking time by about 15-20 minutes, though, for more potatoes.  I put them directly on the rack with tinfoil on the lower rack (just in case).  They turned out perfect!  Tender on the inside and a good crispy flavor on the outside.

This is a recipe I use all the time now!  Especially when I have the time & foresight to bake the potatoes, but not the energy to come up with something fancy.  I followed other reviewers' advice and I increased the oven temperature to 400 degrees F, and reduced the cooking time to a little more than 60 minutes.  We eat them with just butter & freshly ground pepper on top - no cheese needed.  These are much better than in the microwave, even the skins are yummy!

I will stick with regular salt. I tried sea salt and it was too salty.

I used a liberal rub of Kosher salt and didn't bother with the cheese.  Absolutely perfect baked poato.

AOK potato. I microwaved 4 potatoes for 5 min. to hurry cooking process; baked at 400 for about 35 min. Of course, I forgot the sour cream so the fam was not so happy.

Here's what I did instead of the 1 hour and a half baking time..  I turned the oven up to 450 and poked holes in the potatoes.  (I didnt use baking potatoes.. Just ones that were longated like the baking potatoes.  Wrapped them in foil, and baked them for an hour.. Cut them in half (using potholder), and topped them with grated cheese and baking bits and had Potatoe skins.. YUMMY!!!

Awesome! I took anothers advice and poured a little EVOO into a baggie and rolled the potatos one by one and then put kosher salt on a plate and rolled them around. Cooked four medium potatos directly on the rack at 400 for 45 min. Make sure to put a cookie sheet underneath. I made garlic butter from this site. OMG! So Good!

I have made a this recipe for years. I scrub potatoes, poke holes ALL over them, rub them well with olive oil, shake in a bag using Jane's Crazy Mixed Up Seasonings (very good seasoned salt/pepper combo), then wrap each potato individually in aluminum foil. This keeps the potato moist on the inside and seals in the seasonings. Place directly on oven rack in preheated 400 degree oven for 1 hour. You will need NO additional salt/pepper/butter etc. for a healthier potato. I, however, like it well adorned and put shredded cheese, sour cream and bacon bits on top for a truly smothered and fattening baked potato. Enjoy!

Delicious is the only word for it. I rubbed my potatoes with olive oil, salt and a little Italian seasoning. Then I baked them at 375 degrees F for one hour. Splendid!

These are very easy to prepare. Two tips that I used: Olive oil--I just put some on a kitchen towel and rubbed it on the potato. Yes, it still gets on your hand, but not as much. Besides it's just oil. Other tip, I had some coarse ground sea salt. But, it wouldn't stay on the potato, so I ground it up in my Magic Bullet and that was just right.  I will rate this for taste after we eat.   We have eaten now:  This is the only way we will do baked potatoes from now on. So very good.  Our toppings were fried onions, steamed broccoli, grated cheese, butter, salt and pepper. Thanks, very excellent recipe.

This was very good. I had to use vegetable oil and i put some garlic powder in with the salt and the skins came out soooo delicious. I topped mine off with butter, sour cream, cheese and bbq brisket and it was an amazing meal.

I am giving this recipe 3 stars because the potatoes were way too firm for our taste.  I think the temp should be higher.  The skin was nice and crisp and tasty.

I can't believe my eyes! how hard can it be to bake a potato? I have a hard time considering this a "recipe". I have an even harder time believing that the author of this one came up with it on his/her own. People have been baking potatoes FOREVER.

I followed this recipe exactly, and came up with a regular ole baked potato. I know it wasnt supposed to be much more than that, but this literally tasted exactly the same as a microwaved potato that would have taken over an hour less time, and room in my oven!

The first time since we moved to the mountains (7300+ feet) that I've had a potato that cooked all the way.  Thanks!
I used sea salt. Will brush salt off next time before serving.

These baked potatoes are great!  I have made them many times.  Sometimes I bake at 400 for one hour to get a very crispy potato skin and I really love that, too!

The potato was baked well enough, but all of that salt that I rubbed on the skin was disgusting.  I'm not sure what the salt rubbing does, but definitely don't use as much salt as the recipe calls for - or even half of that.  Use your salt shaker to keep it light.

I followed a previous poster's advice and microwaved the potatoes for five minutes, then baked them at 350 for 45 minutes. I roasted a head of garlic while the potatoes were baking. Then I smashed the roasted garlic cloves and spread them on the potatoes in place of butter. It was the best baked potato I'd ever had!

These are PERFECT. I made these tonight and loved them..so did the kids. I used coarse GARLIC SALT instead of plain salt and it gave the skins nice flavor. I also raised the temp to 350. These had nice and crispy skins, with a soft and fluffy center. I will surely be making baked potatoes more often. Thanks for sharing this method with us.

Absolutely AMAZING!  Normally I microwave my potatoes to save time but I won't anymore!  I used the olive oil in the bag trick to reduce mess and then coated the potato with sea salt.  Skipped the cheese and stuck with butter, sour cream and sprinkle of pepper.  Can't wait to make these again!

This is a perfect baked potato. I followed the recipe except for the cooking temperature and time. I baked my potatoes at 350 degrees for 1 hour. They came out perfect, just as the name says.

I never knew how great a baked potato could be until I tried this easy recipe! I made four of them. One became a twice baked, one become smothered in vegetarian baked beans, and the other two were eaten as-is. All were wonderful. I did toss them in a sealable bag to oil them up and used Kosher salt on the skins. I also baked them directly on the oven rack with a pan underneath, as suggested by a previous poster. During the last 20 minutes of baking time, I placed several sides in the oven (such as the baked beans beans, corn, and green beans, in small bowls), and some garlic bread, for a complete meal.

Yummy! Don't overdo it on the salt though! This oven baked version doesn't compare to the microwave at all. The skin on these potatoes are really good so make sure that you clean them extra well!

This recipe is absolutely great, and the variation is one of my favourite snacks, really tasty and easy too!

I suggest using coarse salt like rock salt for the texture and I prefer using the type of olive oil that has some peppers in it for extra flavour.

I had these in the oven for 1 hour, but I guess they needed to cook longer. I ended up putting them in the microwave to be cooked all the way through.  I don't know how I screwed this up but I did.  Taste was still good.

The name of this recipe says it all.  I will always make my bake potatoes this way.  We used about 6 very large baking potatoes and the baking time did increase some.  The slightly crisp, salty potato skin was delicious!

I really liked this recipe with my modifications.  It's the only way I will bake potatoes from now on.  After washing, drying and piercing potatoes, I microwaved them for 5 min. each side.  Then I put the oil and salt on and threw them in a preheated 400 degree oven for about 40 minutes.  Absolutely perfect crunchy skin and soft insides.

I was skeptical about whether a 90 minute baking time was really going to create a better tasting potato.  Potatoes only take a matter of minutes to cook in a microwave oven after all.  After tasting this baked potato however, I am convinced.  It is so fluffy and delicious; it is the crowning accompaniment to a grilled steak.  I don’t know if it is the slow baking, or the use of olive oil and salt in the rub, but I have now added this to my “short-list” of best recipes!

Agree with other reviewers that 300 degrees is not enough.  I only wanted to make one so I stuck my potato in the toaster oven at 360 degrees for an hour and half and it came out perfect.  It was a small potato as well so for bigger potatoes I recommend turning it up to 400 for an hour and a half.

These are the best baked potatoes I've ever eaten! 90 minutes and the potatoes were perfect! My family loved it. Although 90 minutes was quite a stretch but I believe that it makes the potatoes just brilliant. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I will NEVER make baked potatoes any other way!  I stumbled across this recipe as I was finishing up my Thanksgiving menu.  As I was hungry and home alone, I fixed a potato according to this recipe (used kosher salt).  It is, hands down, the best baked potato I have ever eaten!  I can't say enough good things.  I'd give it 20 stars if I could.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This truly was the PERFECT baked potato...better than most restaurants!  Who knew that using olive oil could make this big of difference?  I will be making mine this way from here on out since they pretty much took center stage on my plate!  Thanks for sharing this one.

Living in Idaho, I use potatoes all the time! Tried this out to see if I could save some tin foil...worked BEAUIFULLY! I like to put the olive oil and salt and then sprinkle parmesian cheese on them before baking. Makes them a little extra tasty. GREAT RECIPE! Thanks!

very simple and very yummy. i was surprised that it tasted so good with the little amount of ingredients.
i didn't have a baking potato so i used the red skinned ones and it was fine. i had to crank up the oven a little bit more because my potato was pretty big and i didn't really feel like waiting hours for it to cook.

These were so yummy! I did 4 large potatoes at roughly 325°F for 2 hours, and they were perfect. I also substituted a 1/4 of the salt for other seasonings, like paprika and ground cumin, so the skins turned out better than any I've EVER had at a store. Sure, it takes a while, but it's definitely worth the time. A good, lazy Sunday kind of recipe! Can't wait until next weekend...

I like the perfect baked potato recipe.  I did use big potatoes and prepared them per directions but used the micro 5 minutes on each side and then popped them in the oven for 30 minutes.

Wow! Wow! Wow! Loved these! Everyone did! Got my 2 1/2 year old to eat potatoes without prying his mouth open!  Just like they would serve in a steak house! Delicious!  I put the olive oil in a ziploc bag (like another reviewer said) and sprinkled salt over top of potato. They might have been a little salty that way, next time I'll cut back a little, but it didn't stop me from eating two pototes plain.I placed a piece of aluminum foil on the rack in the oven so the oil wouldn't drip. These truly are the perfect baked potato.

This is great.  The potato turns out crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  I added bacon bits along with the cheese and butter.  Divine!!  Thanks for sharing.

Awesome! I would have never thought olive oil and seasonings would add so much to a plain baked potato. I also added a smidget of galic powder and also used this recipe as is. This recipe brings a whole new meaning to a plain baked potato.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These are very tasty, but mine weren't crispy at all. They were still delicious, though. I baked mine as suggested the first time and another time I used the microwave. They are very good in the microwave, too.

Very good.  The olive oil and salt is a nice touch, makes the outside crispy.  I don't use the butter or the cheddar, I like serving mine with cottage cheese and pepper.  Yum!

This is just like ordering a great baked potato at a restaurant.. similar to Ruth's Cris steakhouse.  You can eat the entire potato - the crusted salt is yummy on the skin!

Thank you for a great recipe!  I was looking for a little change for common food and found it.  However, I baked my potatoes at 350 degree for about 1 hour and 15 minutes (I had 8 of them and a small roast sharing the oven).  Perfect!

I used huge potatoes, so had to increase the cooking time to 2 1/2 hours.  Had to brush off much of the salt too, was too embarassed to serve with that much salt coating the outside.  But the potatoes were incredible - everyone thought they were just like the ones served in fancy restaurants.  Very tender and flavorful insides.

Zero stars. I made these and after 30 extra minutes in the oven and increasing the temperature, we had to throw them in the microwave. Exactly what I was trying to avoid. Thanks for ruining dinner...

Great recipe! After reading reviews and subsequent suggestions, I cooked at 350 to reduce baking time, and sprinkled with garlic salt then topped with sour cream, butter and Gorgonzola. Delicious!!

Second time I used this. Baked smaller at 350 for 60 minutes, larger an additional 15 minutes. Got started late so jacked the temp up a little. These are a big hit with butter, bacon and shredded cheese. Served with toast beef from slow cooker.

Good recipe, I’ve found the temperature can be higher and the time shorter based on your needs. (Something else in the oven requiring a different temperature for example)

I tried baking a russet potato for 90 minutes at 300 degrees F.  Sorry, but after baking for 90 minutes, it is still hard as a rock.  I'm disappointed because this sounded so easy to do.  Back to 375 degrees F.  for 60 minutes.  I know that works just fine.

One of the best ways to have potatoes, by far. Instead of using salt, I use garlic salt for that garlic flavor but still contains the salt it needs to help make that skin perfect. Thanks for this simple recipe! If my family could live on these, they would.

Made 40 of these for a wedding rehearsal (and family member) dinner at our home. They turned out perfectly.  Served them fresh from the oven (with a hot glove) to each guest, who grabbed toppings and a bunch of green salad, and went to the BBQ where my husband served up  steaks. These baked potatoes  were a huge hit and made feeding a large party MUCH, MUCH easier than we anticipated!!!  (much less inexpensive too)!

We have made much smaller quantities several times since with same great results. They  store well in the fridge and reheat perfectly in the microwave for a great quick  side or quick MEAL!

I left off the cheese and nuked five minutes in the microwave, as others suggested. I put Chef John's creme fraiche on it and devoured every bit. The skin was perfect, the inside  soft. I can't wait to make again.

Foolproof recipe - my potatoes came out moist and really delicious. Make sure your oven is accurate and place pan under the potatoes as they cook because the olive oil may leak out and smoke up the oven. Removing the foil toward the end does help to crisp them up and thickens skin a bit. The sour cream, chives and cheddar made them just awesome. The salt rub seasoned the potato just right.

I didn't use butter, and, yes, I will make it again.  I want to use butter next time.  I only had a soy-based butter that I thought would change the outcome.  That is until I read that it should cook like real butter.

Followed all directions but omitted butter to make it heart healthy. I also put the cheese on 1/2 of the potatoes but omitted it on the other half (someone in my home doesn’t like cheese). They turned out perfectly.

After 90 minutes the potatoes were nowhere near finished. I timed all the rest of the meal around them and everything else ended up cold. Horrible.

Fantastic!!! Made this for a group of friends and they all loved it. I used medium sized russet potatoes. I didn’t have Kosher Salt or Couarse Sea Salt so regular Table Salt has to due. I simply added butter and pepper. The outside of it was SOOOO CRISPY!!! 
Next time i’ll need to add bacon bits and sour cream.

My potatoes turned out very good, fluffy on the inside, with crisp, tasty skins. This is the best way to bake potatoes if they are going to be a side dish on their own, but you have to plan ahead, and it will tie up the oven so plan on using the stove or microwave for the rest of the meal, unless you use the bottom rack.

Perfect if you like a raw potato,  turn heat up to 400 if you want it cooked. It's very difficult to overcook, easy to undercook. My potato was inedible after I listened to this recipe.

My picky husband loved it... I'll stick with it.  Because I was making meatloaf at the same time and the temp was 350, I baked the potatoes one hour at 350.  Then I just turned the oven off and kept the potatoes in for about 40 more minutes.  They were perfect.

Go ahead and microwave them. 1.5 hours on 300 isn’t log enough or hot enough to cook a potato.

Why all the good ratings? I tried this with just above average-sized potato's and they were not even close to being done after 90 minutes. Ruined my entire dinner. You'd think it would be simple enough to do some testing  before posting a recipe here and say something like; 90 minutes for small potatoes, 120 minutes for large and 150 for extra large. Silly, really. I thought there was something special to baking them at such a low temperature, I guess I'll find out next time.

It was a good recipe, I had large potatoes so I upped the temperature to around 400 Degrees and cooked them for about 60 minutes.

NICE!
 Remember: slow cooking as suggested makes food tender.
   Microwaving, or increasing the temp to hurry cooking will make your SPUDS tougher or rubbery!

Rock hard after 90 minutes at 300 degrees F.  Maybe work for a fingerling, but a real russet is not  cooked.

Because we had these baked potatoes as our main course for dinner, I used extra large bakers.  After poking each potato several time and basting them with olive oil, I sprinkled French fry seasoned salt on them instead of regular or Kosher salt.  I laid a piece of foil on the oven grill and placed the potatoes on it (easy clean-up!), baking them for 90 minutes at 425 degrees.  The came out perfect!  we dressed them with butter, sharp cheddar cheese, broccoli, meatless chili and sour cream.  Served with a side of fresh cantaloupe, it was a feast fit for a king!

I think this might be my first review, even though I save recipes. I haven't cooked much in the past few years. I had a yearning for a stuffed baked potato to go along with my steak tonight, and I found this recipe. Microwaved potatoes just haven't done it for me.
I rubbed one potato with lemon-infused olive oil and sea salt, baked at 400 deg. for 45 minutes, then let it cool. I cut it in half (the texture was buttery!) and hollowed it out. Added medium cheddar, chopped onion, butter, kosher salt, pepper, and sour cream. I'll probably add more butter when I heat it up later. 
I won't ever bake a potato any other way. The skin will be eaten, too--it looks so yummy.

I sprayed my potato with olive oil cooking spray and sprinkled salt and a garlic & herb spice mix on it. Cooked in on a pan at 350 for 90 minutes (it was probably done after an hour but I decided to marinate the steak). It was delicious. Crispy skin (best I've ever had on a potato) with a fluffy centre. Mmmmm!

Decided to try this recipe for my twice baked potatos.  Takes more time than microwaving but I definitely liked it better.  Skins were nice and crispy!   Unless I am pressed for time, this will be my new go to method!

Used a 200g potato. Poked holes and light sprinkle of salt and pepper. Wrapped in foil and cooked for 90 minutes. Came out perfect. (no oil is needed)

ETA: I tried this with 400g potatoes and they were raw after the 90 minutes. Would definitely NOT recommend this recipe if you are using large potatoes.

I only went looking for a baked potato recipe because I forgot how long to bake them and at what temperature. Previously I have always wrapped them in foil. Never again.

This recipe is heavenly. I used EVOO and table salt, but I can't wait to try it with a course salt. 

I threw them directly on the top rack and took the advice of others by using a cookie sheet on the lower rack to catch the drips. My five kids loved them - including the middle child who "only likes french fries, not real potatoes." Super fluffy.

Only change I made ~ I did go higher heat for a shorter time. 375 for about 50 minutes. This was only because of a time crunch, and I felt my potatoes were bigger than medium.

Used this recipe for 3 middle sized and 1 small potato. They were still solid after 90 mins. Turn heat up and small one was ready after a further 30 mins but middle ones took an extra hour.... think I'll stick to my own method in future

Cooked 4 large potatoes. Scrubbed & pierced, coated with the olive oil, rolled them in kosher salt then put in a 375 degree oven for 60 minutes. The potatoes cooked perfectly.  We had 2 the first night with leftover pot roast as the topping for our dinner. The next day we had the 2 remaining potatoes with all the traditional fixings to accompany our country style ribs.

This is a great way to make baked potatoes with crispy skin. A lot of baked potato recipes just recommend time in the oven for doneness, but, if you use a probe thermometer, it's much better. A potato is done when its internal temperature is 212F or 100C.

Comes out great! Skin is nice and crispy without tasting fried, and the whole potato is flavorful. I add a bit of garlic and lime chili powder to my recipe.

For me, the best way to get not too much oil on the potatoes is to put some on your hands rub them together and then just rub that on the potato, way better than brushing.

The potatoes cooked beautifully in 1 hour, however I had to sprinkle some salt when I cut them open. I also sprinkled some grated cheese and put it back in the oven for 3 mins. Delicious!

Best baked potatoes I ever made! The only thing I changed was I baked the potatoes for 45 minutes at 400 degrees,and for 1/2 hour at 350 degrees. I baked them in the middle rack of my oven and on the bottom rack placed a pan underneath to catch any dripping of the oil on the potatoes. Crispy skin and steamy perfection! ;)

Unfortunately, I must agree with those who suggested a higher oven temperature setting. The potatoes did not bake through with these settings, and turned out quite hard. Even leaving them in an extra 20 minutes didn't do the trick.

Made this last night and turned out really well! I cooked it for about 15 minutes longer, increasing heat to 350 at the end. Nice a crisp on the outside, tender on the inside.

The technique on this is great!! To put the oil and salt on them and cook them directly on the rack in the oven with a cookie sheet below is perfect. I vary the time and temperature according to the size of my potatoes.

This is a good recipe, but the cooking temp was just too low. This works better done exactly the same, but at 350-375 depending on the size of your potatoes. I also think it could use a flip halfway through cooking so that the bottom skin doesn't get too crisp that it's tough. Turning results in a nice crust all the way around. I used the large baking potatoes. Otherwise, this is a nice simple, great tasting, recipe.

This is how baked potatoes should be done.  This bakes them instead of steaming them.  Don't just eat the inside, eat the skin too!

I baked them at 350 for about an hour last time; the olive oil and kosher salt make for a perfect skin and perfect insides! Doing again tonight and topping with chili leftovers from 4th of July. YUM.  Maybe adding some shredded cheddar and sour cream, too. Double YUM.

In my opinion it is not worth it to take any shortcuts! Any variances alter the outcome of this recipe. My husband and I make steak and baked potatoes at least once a week and I have used this recipe several times now. A couple of times I cheated and heated in the microwave to save a few minutes. I could definitely taste the difference! There are a hundred different ways you can cheat to save time but then you aren't really getting the benefit of this recipe now are you?

I love baked potatoes done this way. Just be sure to put something underneath them to catch the oil drippings.

You can't mess up this potato! After reading reviews I gave the two potatoes I had a 5 minute head start in the microwave because they were huge and I was afraid they would take forever. I upped the temp to 350 and set them directly on the upper oven rack, no foil, and they were absolutely perfect after 45 minutes! Make sure to put a pan or foil on the bottom rack to catch drips!

Were very good, however 300 degrees for 1:30 min was not enough.  Will take up temp next time.  Ended up microwaving almost 10 minutes after.

I never tried rubbing olive oil on potatoes before baking them before, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I used 2 very large russet potatoes, threw them in a Ziploc bag with olive oil and shook the bag to distribute it all over.  Then I sprinkled some salt, pepper and garlic powder on top of the potatoes, pricked them a few times with a fork, wrapped them in foil and cooked them about 2 hours at 325 degrees.  They were very yummy!!!

I like baked potatoes but the temperature and timing in this recipe make for some pretty stiff and unpleasant 'tatoes! The temperature should probably be closer to 400 for the same duration.

Saved time: Poked holes, rubbed with olive oil and salt, and put in microwave for 8 mins, turned them and did 8 more mins. Put them in over for 15 mins and they're perfect.

I made this for my family, and they all said it was the best baked potato they've ever had. The only thing I did different was I wrapped each potato in foil to keep them from drying out and they were delicious

I have always made my baked potatoes similar to this. I only cook for two, so I just put a bit of olive oil in the palm of my hand and rub each potato until just coated (shouldn't be dripping) and then sprinkle liberally with either Kosher or Sea Salt (coarse grain is a must). I bake them directly on the oven rack at 400 degrees until done. How long? That will depend on how large your potato is. I check them with a fork after 45 minutes and recheck every 15 until the fork goes in easily. I do like the idea of tossing them in a plastic bag with the olive oil if you are making more than two, but I would make sure that they are not dripping and salt only after they come out of the bag. Another key is to make sure your scrubbed potatoes are very dry before you oil them as any moisture will inhibit the crisping of the skin. I also like the idea of giving them a head start in the micro if you have large potatoes or are short on time, but they must finish in the oven to truly get that baked potato flavor. Having said that, a potato wrapped in foil, fully cooked in a micro wave or slow cooker is not a baked potato, it is a steamed potato. That is fine if you like your skins soft, but it is not a baked potato and you will not get a lovely, crispy skin.

I use vegetable oil and kosher salt. The skin is amazing on these. Barely need to salt your potato when its finished.

Absolutely loved this recipe and so did the family! I baked 6 potatoes for hour at 350° F atop an upside down muffin tin to catch drippings and did not have to turn them at all.

I was never a fan of baked potatoes and certainly didn't want to eat the skin but this changed my opinion.  My whole family loves these and have asked for them again.  The skin is great!!  I adjust my temp. As suggested by another reviewer and cooked for one hour.

The times will vary based on the size of the potato, but to get around worrying about that, just press the sides when you think they should be ready (oven mitt on, of course).  When the sides are soft, they're done. Easy-peasy.

It worked!  Had some huge bakers that would have taken just about forever to bake in the oven.  Put these in the crockpot for 4 hours and they were perfectly cooked.  Made a great baked potato bar for Super Bowl snacking!  Will make baked potatoes this way again!

I buy large bake potatoes. I wash the potatoes dry them well. Then I rub olive oil all around. I then add some spices like garlic powder, then garlic salt, onion powder kosher salt and black pepper. Once in a while I'll add powder cayenne pepper. Sometimes seasoned salt. Whatever!  Oh. Before I do the olive oil I forgot to mention I do poke holes around potatoes. I then put them on shallow baking pan. Put in oven at 400 degrees for two hours!   I live in the sierras at high elevation   Everyone loves them.  Not burnt at all. Skin is wonderful. Everyone eats the skin. Good luck on your adventures to bake a potatoe

I love bakers but I like to add vege's to mine and NO cheese because of the fat content of the cheese.I like to also load mine up and I do use a little sour cream with mine and I make it my full deal meal for the day.I also add small amounts of whatever meat I have on hand.Tonight I will grill some pork chops and have a baker on the side without all the goodies on it but I do use some spread instead of butter.

Perfect! Use an oven.Microwaves zap all the nutrients out. I baked 4 small potatoes at 350 for 60 minutes on the rack. Put a pan under to catch drips. Just give them a squeeze and if they are soft, then ready. I covered in olive oil and abodo(generously.) Yummy!

This is a great recipe; the skin is so tasty!  To cut down on roasting time I put the potatoes in the microwave for 5 minutes.  Then I roasted them 1 hour.  So yummy - thanks for sharing!

Very helpful recipe & tasty...especially with kosher or sea salt. I did have to bake my potato longer than recommended (could be my oven though). This is a great basic potato recipe.

Wonderul - soft baked potato here! I took others advice and used a bag to put my olive oil in. I added some Mrs. Dash spices. Followed the heat and cooking time exactly. Will make my bakers like this every time now!

I didn't add cheese, but used sour cream instead. This makes the perfect potato. An hour for a small potato and more for larger ones. I put them right on the rack (I have a liner underneath to catch the drippings).

BEST. BAKED POTATO. EVER. I cut down the cooking time a bit by raising the oven temp to 400 and the two big potatoes I used took less than an hour, as a result. They ended up being by far the best part of the meal, and all we added was a bit of margarine. Next time I'll throw on some chives or even some caramelized onions, but honestly it doesn't need anything. So simple, but SO GOOD!

I too microwave my potatoes for 5 min to get them started.  Then I spray with olive oil non stick spray and sprinkle with seasoned salt and garlic powder.  I have made them in an oven, but for the best potatoes, throw them on the grill until the skin just starts to turn dark then flip them mmmmmmmmmm.

Never a big fan of eating the skin, but these I couldn't stop eating it.  I did change the recipe slightly.  I used kosher salt and added brown sugar to it as well.  The potatos did take a while to bake but was well worth the wait.

This is one of my favorite ways to eat potatoes. The skin is a little more firm this way but very tasty with the olive oil and salt rub.

This is just what the name says - a perfect baked potato. I took some other reviewers' advice and microwaved the potato for 5 minutes before putting it in the oven for 30 minutes. I also took a reviewer's advice and sprayed it with olive oil Pam to save a few calories. I used sea salt as well. The outside was crispy and delicious while the inside was fluffy! Thanks.

Perfection.  I eat the ENTIRE thing!  Thanks for the recipe and thanks to the reader who supplied the tip of cutting the baking time by microwaving the potatoes for 5 minutes before popping in the oven.

Looks Good.  I haven’t tried this yet, but I wanted to make a couple of comments.  First, for the reviewer who couldn’t believe her eyes about how hard it is to bake a potato:  I was never shown how to bake a potato,  I learned from trial and many errors.  Interesting that you have only one review on this site.  For the reviewer who talked about the same results in the microwave, I’ve never had good results with the microwave.  Maybe the many microwave brands/manufacturers/styles differ, I’ve never had good luck with “baking” a potato in the microwave.  If you can’t say something positive or more constructive, don’t waste a spot with your negativity.  I’m going to try this recipe and will let you know the results.

Great idea to for the salt and oil bath before baking.  Only change I made was I baked the potato at 400 degrees for 1:15 because I use huge potatoes.

I followed the advice on Melissa_B's review of this recipe.  Finally it is nice to have a good recipe for baked potatoes that are so tender and done on the inside and the outside is kind of crispy.. love it!  Thank you!

Amazingly simple and really as great as the ratings make it.  Zapped it in the microwave to help reduce the cook time and then popped it into the oven for another 15 mins.  Turns out just as well

If you are waiting to shave some calories off, you can spray the potato with olive oil spray (instead of directly pouring oil) and you get the same great taste with less calories.  I also used sea salt and it's extra yummy this way.

The best baked potato I have ever had.  Cooked it at 325 degrees for 1 hour and 20 minutes and it turned out perfect.  Put olive oil in bag as others suggested, rolled potato in it, took it out and rolled in kosher salt, spread salt fairly evenly, put directly on rack (with drip pan beneath), after an hour and twenty felt it to make sure it was soft and perfection!  Girlfriend loved it too.

Ok, I think I can make some pretty complex dishes sometimes, but for some reason, things like baked potatoes, boiling eggs, and making rice always fail! Thank you for getting this recipe "on paper" so I can now make one more simple thing correctly! LOL

I am never microwaving my potato again! I baked at 375 for about 45 minutes and they were perfect.

Rubbing oil on the skin was a great idea. It made the skin crunchy just the way I like it!

I was really impressed with this baked potato. I've never been very good at baked potatoes, and these still didn't turn out perfectly, but most of that was probably my fault. I used 2 huge potatoes, and since I didn't have 2+ hours to bake them, I put them in the microwave for 6 minutes, and then baked at 325 for 1 hour 15 minutes. My husband said his was great, but mine was still a little firm in the middle. However, the skin was fantastic, and that was what I was looking for, as I really wanted to duplicate the potatoes my husband and I get at Outback Steakhouse. This was definately the closest I've come to that so far. So thanks for a great recipe, I'll be using it a lot from now on.

The title is correct.  I used coarse kosher salt and my own fillings, this is the way to bake a potato.

This really is the perfect baked potato every time.  I had forgotten how good a potato that is actually baked, instead of microwaved, can be!  After coating with olive oil, I like to sprinkle a generous amount of Jane's Krazy Mixed-Up Salt.  Perfect!

These potatoes were so fluffy and delicious. I followed other user’s suggestions. I scrubbed them and poked them with a fork. Then I cooked them in the microwave for 5 minutes. I added evoo and salt in a baggy and rolled the potatoes in the baggy. I then wrapped them with aluminum foil and cooked them in the oven for 45mins., turning them over half way though. They were just so good.

This is bad to say, but I've NEVER been able to make a good baked potato.  They'd usually turn out undercooked, or dried out.  This recipe was simple and the results were great.

Perfect indeed!  I used the colossal ones from Costco and baked at 350 for almost 2 hours.  I also used the ziploc bag method of tossing which was awesome.  This is the first time I even ate the skin!  Delish!  Thanks!

Outstanding - so much better then microwaving, although I'm usually short on time so do microwave for about 5 minutes, roll in oil & kosher salt and then bake at 350 for 45 minutes or so.  Having a baking sheet on the rack below the potatoes is a MUST.  Also, rub some of the salt off before serving to make it a bit less messy.

Excellent....very good.  I also usually microwave, much better taste by baking.
I did use sea salt and up'd the temp to 350!

Good recipe!

That is a long time to have the oven going, especially in the Summer!  I cut down the baking time by boiling the potato for about 15 minutes. Drain them and cover them with a sheet of foil.Then when I am ready to bake it, I follow the recipe but only have to bake it for about 20 minutes.

These were GREAT! I put medium/large potatoes in oven for 1 hour at 385F and they came out perfect.  I also followed presentation tip given by reviewer 'xenologue'.  Will make again for sure.

This really did make great baked potatoes, but given that I usually cook for those under the age of 7, I probably won't make these a lot.  Still, for special dinners, these are the way to go.  The skins are excellent!

Well you learn something new everyday.  Not sure if baking a potato this way made any difference to the actual texture of the potato but it made the skins really yummy.  Will make again.

very good, I did change a few things. I filled a dish with 1/4 cup oil (for 4 potatoes) and 1/4 tsp pepper, salt and galic powder. Rolled potatoes in oil and placed on oven rack. Baked for 90 minutes at 300

This makes the perfect baked potato.  So soft and fluffy, and I love the slighty crispy, salty skin.  Sooo good!

I used this baked potato recipe (well, the beginning of it) for making my baked potato soup.  Crisping the skin made it easier to peel them later, and then my husband got to eat the skins.  So everyone was happy, and nothing went to waste!

At the suggestion of other reviewers, I baked my medium/large potatoes directly on the rack at 400 degrees for one hour, with a drip pan placed underneath. The inside of the potato was tasty, but I prefer a crispier skin. But overall, it was good!

I also tried this.. few changes.. I marinated the potatoes in a bad of little oil the night before.. used table salt nto sea salt.. and also baked it instead for 2 hours and 350.. the last 10 minutes at 400 to get the skin crisp.. also used only 3 medium potatoes,.... and did the " treat" at the end which was sooo worth it..

So simple, so yummy.  Use course sea salt, if you can. Top with your favorite toppings.  We like to really load it up with crumbled bacon (or shredded crab meat), sour cream, chives, cheddar cheese, etc.

Perfect, soft, moist baked potato. Everyone loves these!  Great at 300 degrees so i could warm up my pre-cooked bbq ribs i bought at the same time and temp! i put them on a pan w/ foil so i didn't drip any olive oil in the stove.

The baked potatoes turned out nice but I was a little concerned about the amount of salt used. Also, the skin wasn’t as crispy as I would have liked and the inside was a little dry. I will try this again but following the suggestions made by the other reviewers.

This is MUCH better than my usual microwave baked potato! I didn't know exactly how to bake a potato in the oven before this. (pathetic, I know :) ) The olive oil and kosher salt are a nice touch. It takes a long time to make, which is the only minus, but it's worth the time.

I really liked the way that these turned out...but couldn't handle the 90 minute baking time in the oven.  I tried to make this a bit shorter by using the microwave.  I really liked the idea, but will only make again when I need to have the oven on for that long.  Thanks for the post.

After all this time, I never knew the perfect baked potato was THIS easy!  I can't say enough good things about this - I am in awe, I truly am.  Must be the olive oil does the trick. I baked 4  small to medium sized potatoes for 90 minutes at about 315 degrees. Perfect, absolutely perfect!

Probably the best baked potato that I ever ate. Of course, my youngest son wasn't crazy about it because the skin was not dry and when I told him that I rubbed seasonings and oil on them he refused to eat it (teenagers)! Little does he know that this recipe is here to stay at our house.

these baked potatoes make excellent comfort food. my idaho's were flavorful & fluffy on the inside. we didn't need the cheddar cheese, i served these with grilled pork tenderloin & gravy. thanks for the terrific recipe, curleegirlee!

Everyone loved it! Some previous posts suggest rolling the potato in salt, that may be a little too much, next time I will just sprinkle instead. Great nonetheless!

This potatoe was wonderful!!  My baked potatoes always came out dry, or undercooked.  I did as others advised and increased the cooking time. I served this for guests, and they kept commenting on how wonderful the potatoes tasted. Five stars for this recipe!!

These were good. Instead of baking them in the oven I put them into the microwave until they were done and they were quick and easy.

Always in a hurry, I have always baked my potatoes in the microwave and they have always come out bad.  This time I wanted to take my time and make a good one and this recipe helped me accomplish that.  It does take about 30 mins longer to cook than expected but as one other reviewer said..it's worth the wait.

Very easy and skin tasted great...only thing is that it takes a LOT longer than 90 minutes to cook.  I only used one large potato, but it took an extra 30 minutes at 375 degrees to cook fully.  It is worth the wait!

First baked potato I have EVER enjoyed.
PERFECT! Thank you.

I cut the top of how it was suggested, scooped out the inside, mashed it with cream cheese, butter, and green onions.  Restuffed it and popped it back in with some shredded cheese on top.

Will be making again, for years to come I AM SURE! :)

I use this at least once a week...I just throw it in the oven when I get home from work and by the time Im done w/my shower, chores, etc...I have a yummy potato waiting for me.  I do add a little more zest w/mine.  I add garlic salt, ground red pepper, a smidge of ground ginger, and season-all.  This tastes great with some of the garlic butter recipes you can find on the site.  Thanks Curleegirlee!

Wow! Just like other reviewers said this is "restaurant quality"!  Follow the others directions and cook the potato about 2 hours AT LEAST. The extra 30 minutes is well worth it. Get redy to eat your whole potato!

I can't eat baked potatoes any other way considering the skin is my favorite part!!  
The only thing that I do different is  I pour some garlic salt mixed with a little extra garlic powder (for good measure!) onto a piece of wax paper & after oiling up the 'taters, I roll my potatoes in this mixture then bake as it says.

I will never put another potato in the microwave.  This was a great, simple recipe.  I used Paula Deen's House Seasoning Mix to season them with before I put them in the oven.

Good basic recipe, you can alter it to fit your tastes.
