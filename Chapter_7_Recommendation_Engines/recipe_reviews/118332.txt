Excellent combination of flavors. I made some changes - used fresh fennel, added onions, did not use rice, upped the curry and the lemon juice.  My husband and I both loved it and couldn't get enough.

One of my all time favorites! An easy, healthy soup...subtle flavor is very unique. I typically double the fennel and curry and add slightly more rice or use barley (barley might make the soup thicker if you don't add a tad more water, but that's up to you). Sometimes I add white mushrooms in order to trick myself and others into eating them...they don't change the flavor at all. All around a versatile and delicious recipe!

I made this and found it to be very good, but a tad bland. My husband thought so too. So I added 1 tbsp. lemon juice. Still needed something, so I added 3 tbsp. sour cream and 1/4 tsp. ginger. Then we both loved it! Next time I think I'll try doubling the fennel and the curry as eiriana suggested : )

This recipe is virtually the same recipe published in Vegetarian Times perhaps 10 years ago!  In VT it was called "Carrot Soup with Cilantro" and I think the cilantro works better than the parsley.  An okay soup, but not sure I'll make it again...the curry ruined it for me.  Next time I'll omit the curry and add a little extra stock to thin it out.  I did add a dollup of sour cream on top before serving which definitely helped balance the flavors.

I made this soup just as written, and I really liked it.  My husband isn't as big of a fan.  I think it just depends on your preference.
