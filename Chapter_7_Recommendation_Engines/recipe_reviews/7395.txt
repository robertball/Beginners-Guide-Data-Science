This is an excellent creamy, easy to spread, icing.  The flavor is wonderful, not too rich or too sweet; just melt in your mouth goodness.  Definitely whip your egg whites to stiff peaks.  Recipe lacks the instruction of when to add the vanilla, but be sure to add it.  The description indicated there would be flecks of chocolate but since the receipe directs you to melt all the choclate I'm not sure how you obtain this.  I guess you could grate some in afterwards--it might make the icing even better, if that's possible.  Just what I was looking for.  Thank you!

I haven't tried this recipe yet but I plan to.  If you are having trouble with the butter separating, you need to keep beating it.  The coldness of the butter determines how long you need to mix it for.  If you are ever to make italian buttercream, you have to mix it for at least 10 minutes on high, during which it separates, and yes, does look like cottage cheese.  Eventually it comes together.  Next time try to not have your butter so cold.

i used maybe a tablespoon of the butter and it turned out like I was hoping. reminds me of the frosting I used to make when i was a kid. i can't find the recipe now, but i used a double boiler, cream of tarter and egg whites. no butter. and so, although i didn't use the boiler or the c.o.t, it turned out fairly similar. i added grated chocolate instead of melting all that. worked great. just a nice frosting for a rich chocolate cake, not too sweet or buttery, which was what i was going for.

VERY Yummy! I would agree that the recipe calls for too much butter. I left a little out b/c of the reviews, but it's still a little too buttery. Maybe try adding 1 cup and then add more to taste. Still add the chocolate at the end. Enjoy. I'm saving this one to my recipe box :)

Did not turn out at all.  Ended up with what looked like cottage cheese.  I beat it for 15 minutes and gave up.

I found this to be a little heavy on the butter flavor.  Next time I make it I will probably cut back on the butter by at least 1/2 cup and adjust from there.  It made it VERY rich.  I would likely chill it just a bit first before spreading it as well and wait until the cake is thoroughly cooled.  The butter base doesn't hold up well on something above room temperature.  Overall flavor met good reviews with the family!

I must've done something wrong, because I excpected this frosting to be "fluffier". However, to bring it to the thickness and fluffiness I desired, I just added powdered sugar. The results were fantastic!! By far, the best tasting chocolate frosting I have made! My kids couldn't get enough of it!!

I give it three stars, daughter (11) gives it four.  It's light, slightly creamy, has that little specks of chocolate like the description says.  Didn't love it, but it frosted the cake.  Tastes like diluted dark chocolate, which, of course, it basically is by adding semisweet chips.  Makes enough for a generous layer cake.

Very good flavor though my kids thought it too chocolatey (just their preference) so I will either use less chocolate next time or milk chocolate instead of semisweet.  My only problem was with using the organic sugar I have- even though I added it very slowly and in small increments my icing was kind of gritty so I am going to try it today with powdered sugar instead.

exactly what I was looking for. light and sweet with out the powder sugar after taste. I reduced the butter 1/2 c less per other review and it tasted great. You have to mix that butter until really light and flufy. It did turn into cottagecheese for a minute when I added the egg whites and butter together after a while of beating some more and adding the vanilla everything turn out fine. Thank you for posting great recipe

Light fluffy and yummy! The chocolate flavor is way above the flavor of powdered cocoa. It is a bit buttery but I noticed after the icing sat a while I tasted the chocolate more. I will definitely be using this one again and again. I put it on Banana bars. A recipe I found on this site. Yummy! Who doesn't love banana's and chocolate!

I was excited to find this recipe because I wanted to use up some of the egg whites left over when I made a yellow cake but it really did not turn out right for me. It separated as I was mixing it and didn't ever get smooth. In fact it was separating more as I was mixing it so I gave up and mixed the chocolate in before I got it smooth because it seemed like it was just getting flatter the whole time. If someone can tell me what I did wrong maybe I'll bump up my rating ;)

i used this frosting with a yellow cake and it was delicious. My dad does not like things to be too sweet and this recipe was perfect for him. Very easy.
