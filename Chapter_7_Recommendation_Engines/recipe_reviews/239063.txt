Disclaimer:  I've never had a vodka sauce, so I've nothing to compare this to.   That being said, I didn't really find this any different than a pomodoro-type sauce, which doesn't have the added calories from butter/milk.  I enjoyed this, but I can't see making it again, simply because the butter/milk didn't convey any additional richness to make it worth the extra calories.  I added some onion to the garlic and uses a heaping tsp of garlic, as opposed to "3/4 of clove".  I, too, added a pinch of crushed red pepper for a little heat.  THANKS for the recipe!

Great base to start with, that's why I rated it 5! But everyone likes to "tweek" based on personal preference. I made these additions/changes and using the seasonings included in the recipe: 1 can of tomato sauce instead of chunky tomatoes, 1 tsp fresh garlic, 1 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1 stick of butter, can of cream of mushroom soup, 1 stalk of fresh zucchini, and..not sure how much vodka lol. Served over penne pasta. Yummy!!

Very simple and easy to cook. However seems a little bland. I had to put much more salt. Also the proportion seems good for 3 servings, not 8 servings as the recipe suggested.

I put a small handful of shredded mozzarella cheese in it, while the milk  thickened the sauce. This was delicious with linguine!

I haven't tried this yet, it sounds good.  When I do try it, I'll change only one thing.  I'll pour the tomato mixture into the milk.  With no soda added to the tomatoes, it will probably curdle the milk, doesn't hurt anything, but I don't like the looks of that.
