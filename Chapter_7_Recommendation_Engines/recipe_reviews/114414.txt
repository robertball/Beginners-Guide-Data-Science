I know some people are hesitant to try recipes that have only been rated by a couple folks, but this one you must try!  The combinations of the pepper/hot and the brown sugar, along with the bitterness from the vinegar and beer...there are so many hearty flavors that truly make this delicious.  I didn't change a thing!  Thank you!

I have made this chili numerous times.  Each time I have omitted the vinegar.  I made it with a wheat beer, a light rice beer, and without beer.  It is best with light rice beer or no beer.  This chili is delicious and everyone who has tried it loves it.  It's hard to find a chili recipe without beans.  This one is fantastic!!!

Outstanding beanless chili! I ALSO USED GINGER ALE INSTEAD OF BEER!! :-) Made this as is but w/1.25 lb ground turkey, so I cut cooking time and all ingredients in half, except for chili powder which I'm glad I used less of... I recommend no more than 2 heaping tablespoons chili powder per pound, very easy to make your own to your liking- a great base is 1 tsp paprika, 2 tsp cumin, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp oregano, 2 tsp garlic powder per 1 lb meat... Anywho! I did not drain green chiles and glad I didn't :-) Served this topped w/sour cream, colby-jack & chedder cheese, over macaroni & cheese w/a side of cornbread! Thanks SO much for this recipe!

My husband and I do not like chili (neither of us eat beans, he's not big on spice, and I don't care for a ton of tomatoes), but this was surprsingly wonderful!  I subbed a 15oz can of pumpkin puree instead of tomato sauce which added some great flavor and thickend up the chili just a bit.  I also used 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of pork sausage.  I've started making batches just to freeze (in 1-2 serving portions).  My husband loves having his new fall favorite at his fingertips and I love having a quick, filling, delicious dinner option.

There is another recipe much like this on allrecipes which is WAY more labor intensive.  I LOVE this one because it has the same fantastic taste and so much less work!  I followed the recipe exactly but learning from the other recipe, I make the chili the day before and store it in the fridge overnight.  It somehow melds all the flavors together perfectly!  I suggest you make this chili and let it sit for 24 hours before you make any changes in the recipe.

This was easy to make, but I think I would omit the vinegar since the beer gives it enough balance against the brown sugar and spices.  I would also add 2 cans of kidney beans, 1 dark/1 red.  My family did like this even though the vinegar and beer gave it a definite aftertaste.

The flavor of this chili is outstanding!  I doubled the tobasco, 'cuz we like it hot!  And it was sooooo good!  I didn't drain the green chilies; figured a little more flavor couldn't hurt anything, and it didn't!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this Chili with all ingredients and amounts instructed, only difference I did was cook it in my slow cooker for 4 hours.  Was excellent!  Thank you for a great beanless recipe!

Wonderful recipe!  I did make a little change though.  I used Pink Himalayan salt and ended up almost doubling the salt & black pepper: When I start to brown my ground beef, I salt and pepper it like I was cooking a hamburger; the add onion and other ingredients as called for,  but start with about 3/4 of the salt called for then adjust to taste, after an hour of cooking all ingredients together.  I also put a bay leaf per 2 pounds of ground beef.  I didn't use the beer, but used water in it's place and it was great that way.  I also used extra lean ground beef - 93% lean, and I used about a 1/4 cup of Extra Virgin Olive Oil to brown my ground beef, onions and garlic.  When you use Olive Oil and extra lean beef you have very little grease to skim when you save the left-overs in the frig!  I used Louisiana Hot Sauce for my hot sauce, and it gave it a very nice warm after taste while not blistering you.  Of course you can load it up with various hot sauces to turn the heat up, if you like to suffer when you eat chili!  Overall, one of, if not the best chili I have eaten, PERIOD!  

01/01/2020 UPDATE:  Still my favorite Chili Recipe, and it is very Keto and Paleo diet Friendly!  A new tweak to the recipe, since I've started watching my sugar intake since my original review, I use 1 teaspoon of Stevia powder, instead of the brown sugar.  I've also switched to Avocado Oil, but Extra Virgin Olive oil is still good choice too.  I've cooked this in an Insta-Pot, and it is much quicke

SO GOOD!  Chili is a tricky thing in our house, because the kids hate beans, so I barely make it. But it's a cold night, and the ingredients are what we had at hand. Typically of how it goes down in our house with chili, I was waiting for the moans from the kids, so I really didn't think we would like this - I mean, beer and brown sugar, really? BUT WOW! that gave it a complexity in flavor REALLY worth trying. Even my picky kids LOVED it.  I did omit the hot sauce, because not everyone likes spicy, BUT who cares?! It's still delish! 

I served it on top of a bowl of rice, top off with sour cream and a sprinkle of cheese. Voila! 


Don't hesitate! Try it!

This was my first ever attempt at making chili & I must say I thought it was fairly simple to make & quite good! 
I mostly followed the recipe, with the exception of using 1 lb ground beef & 1 lb ground turkey (with the price of beef rising we've been substituting turkey where we can) & instead of simmering for 3 hours on the stove I put in the crock pot for 4 hours. I served with shredded cheese & Fritos, and made a beer bread for a side.
I generally do not eat much chili because I don't like beans, however loved this and will certainly make it again! Hubby (who loves chili w/beans) raved about it too, said "it's got great flavor". I was worried the leftovers would be too spicy to eat (heat always tends to grow once it's been reheated), but that was not the case- just as great later!
Highly recommended!

Does anyone else think that 1/3 C of Chili Powder is ENTIRELY too much?  My husband (who prides himself on loving spicy food) could not even eat it - much less myself.  I had to add more diced tomatoes, another bottle of bear, a pound of meat plus two cans of tomato paste to even make this close to edible.  It tastes great after you tone it down and I'm happy it's beanless but WHOA BABY on the chili powder AND pepper AND onion AND tabasco!

I had to make a few changes, due to personal taste and reading other reviews.  I used 1/4 c. ancho chili powder, and that was enough for us.  I subbed Mexican oregano for basil.  I used fire roasted tomatoes, and subbed water for beer and agave for sugar.  I added 1 Tbs. beef soup base instead of the hot sauce, salt and black pepper.  This makes a beefy tasting, beanless, rich chili, with a bit of heat.

Soooo good!  This was my first time making chili and this recipe seemed easy which is why I chose it.  Plus, I hate the beans normally found in chili.  I ventured from the original recipe only slightly:  added about a cup of diced green pepper (because I wanted to use it up before it went bad) and added one big can of Bush's Baked Beans and omitted the brown sugar because it is already in the baked beans.  Because I wanted to put this in my slow cooker, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and used tomato paste instead of the tomato sauce.  I browned the meat together with the onion, green pepper and garlic, drained then added to my slow cooker with all the other ingredients.  Its been simmering now for about 2 hours and it already smells and tastes delishicious!  I will serve with oyster crackers, shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream as well as some corn bread.  I'm not sure we are going to have the will power to wait 5 more hours for dinner!

Everyone of the 12 people who ate this chili loved it. Its perfect for chili dogs , chili cheese burgers, chili cheese fries or just by its self. I used an October seasonal beer. I think using a seasonal beer adds that extra little something.

Excellent.  Over the last year, I've been teaching myself to cook using recipes on allrecipes.  This is the first time I've wanted to rate and review.  I followed the directions exactly.  The result was terrific.  For the beer, I chose a quality pale ale.

Everyone in my family loved this, to make it a little healthier I added 1 pound ground turkey replacing a pound of the beef. I also used ginger ale instead of beer just because i'm expecting and would rather not use beer. (I'm sure it would be wonderful with beer too.) I also added a cayenne pepper to fulfill my spicy craving... I should have added two. Instead of making this in the pan I browned the meat and put everything in the crockpot. Wonderful idea. We got to watch the game and the chili stayed warm. I loved this recipe. I will defiantly be making this again.

Fantastic recipe, I've made it several times.  Only a few small changes to suit our family.  Instead of 2 lbs ground beef, I do half ground pork.  And instead of the diced tomatoes and the can of green chilies, we use Rotel.  Delicious!

I made it without the green chilies and beer (used beef broth instead) because I didn't have either...it was the best chili I have ever made. My family loved it, especially the next day! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

How many decades I've been making chili...and finally find a recipe that has exceptional taste! I did cut the chili powder to 2T and added a teaspoon of smoked paprika. And left out the vinegar.  I hate when people change a recipe and review it changed...but these were minor, and the core of this recipe is so super good, do try it. Yes to the light beer and to the brown sugar! With chili, there are a lot of personal adjustments one can make.  (I also threw in about a cup of mushrooms, chopped, and a fresh tomato, chopped, but it had five star flavor before those last minute additions.)

First time making this and it came out amazing. I did take Kim's recommendations and substituted 1 lb of the beef with 1 lb of pork sausage along with the pumpkin puree in for the tomato sauce. I removed the vinegar and used Sapporo beer (rice beer), thanks kandygirl. I also lessened the chili powder amount to 1/4 cup and add a bit of cinnamon due to my love of Cincinnati chili. It finished not 5 minutes ago and I couldn't have asked for a better chili. This alteration of the recipe is good for those that can't take a lot of heat but love enough of it.

I can't say enough good things about this recipe!  I've already made it twice and plan on making it again this week, most likely a double batch this time!  Soooo good.  I honestly never thought I'd find a beanless chili that I liked, but this recipe really holds it's own.  It's awesome Fall comfort food!  I substitute a package of Johnsonville Ground Sweet Italian Sausage for half of the ground beef.  Also I use water rather than beer and leave out the vinegar.  WONDERFUL WONDERFUL recipe!!!  The Italian sausage really makes it, I definitely recommend the substitution!

Was searching for a no bean chili recipe to take to a party when I ran across this.  I used MGD beer, doubled the recipe and used one can chopped chiles and one can chopped jalepenos (because that's what I had on hand) and put it in a slow cooker after the meat was done.  I was concerned at first because it made so much but, by the end of the evening, folks were literally scraping what they could from the bottom of the crock pot! They were using it as hot dog sauce, taco salad meat, any way they could think of to eat it! Everyone said this was the best chili they'd ever eaten and I agree!

This chili is amazing! I made it as written the first time and it was a bit too spicy for my kids, so the second time I omitted the chilis and then upped the brown sugar to 4 Tbsp. I browned the hamburger and cooked the onion in a skillet first and then add it and all the rest of the ingredients to a crockpot and cooked on low for at least 4 hrs.

Very good. I kept the beer (used Labatt's) and vinegar (cider rather than white) and cooked it in the crockpot on high for 3 hrs. I'm always nervous when cooking with beer but the flavor was nice and tangy - not bitter.

I searched for bean-less chili because my husband is not of fan of "regular" chili and came across this recipe. It was well received! First of all, if you're making this alone, the prep time is longer (but that could also be I'm not a wizard in the kitchen). It took me about an hour to get it all put together by myself. No big deal since I set aside time on the weekend to do it. 

I followed the recipe to the letter. Instead of simmering on the stove, I put it in a crock pot and let it simmer. We have a gas stove and I was a little paranoid of letting an open flame just sit for 3 hours. :-) 

Honestly, it tasted better the second day. I'm guessing the various flavors had a chance to really soak in.

Overall, this recipe was great and I will be making it again!

There was an odd, sweet flavor to the recipe. I don't know if it was the cumin or beer. I typically add brown sugar to recipes with tomatoes but the sweetness was not what I expected. I did not add the chili powder or Tabsco, however, as we do not like spicy foods.

The flavors were off - 1/3 c chili powder and 1 can of beer were  too strong. If I try this again, I'll start with 1/4 c chili powder and 1/2 can beer. To compensate this time, I added an additional can of tomato sauce, lime juice, more honey (which I used instead of sugar). I also added lightly cooked bacon. The flavors did come together better after I let the pot sit overnight in the fridge, though.

I loved this recipe!  I made some for a school function and this one was gone long before there was a dent in the other three crock pots of chili!  I made it with Shiner Bock beer.  It was best after simmering for hours. It took about a recipe and a half to fill the crock pot.  I couldn't find the can of green chilis, so I used a can of Rotel instead.  Yum!

Very good with minor adjustments. I omitted the hot sauce & brown sugar (figured correctly that it was sweet enough once cooked overtime), used 1/2 the salt and used fresh anaheim chilies (cooked with the onions). Family LOVED it.

I gave this chili recipe a try and really enjoyed it. My daughter has never really been a big fan of any chili recipe, but she likes this one. I had some chili leftover and used it when making chili dogs one night and they were a hit as well. It is now my "go to" chili recipe. Thank you. Oh, I left out the hot sauce. Other than that, I followed your recipe to the letter.

This is the first chili recipe I have tried and it won me over.  I hate beans, my husband loves chili so it's perfect, super easy, and makes enough that we can eat lunch and dinner on it for a couple days.  My only gripe is that it could have a little better kick to it spice wise.  Making tomorrow to keep the hubs occupied while I'm out of town for the weekend and may try adding a little extra hot sauce and peppers.  Last note, I also left out the vinegar on the advise of others reviews and it still tasted great.

I have to admit, I was pretty nervous about trying this one...the reviews were kind of all over the place. Some loved it "as is" others thought the beer and the vinegar were too much. Plus I was bummed out that very few of the reviewers commented on which beer they chose to use. In the end I chose this recipe because the list of ingredients was interesting and I was looking for something different. I'm glad I took a chance. And just so you know, I used a can of PBR (I figured a mild beer wouldn't over power the chili, like other reviewers mentioned they had run into). Also like other reviewers mentioned I threw it into the crock pot after browning the beef and adding seasonings. I kept it going for about 5 hours on low. The only changes I made were using ground turkey instead of beef and I added 1 can of pinto beans and 1 can of canellini beans. Other than that I followed the recipe. I will definitely make this again.
**I just finished my second helping and wanted to add that the beer flavor does kind of linger in your mouth a bit. I think next time I will try a better beer, still mild but step it up a notch. If it's going to linger it may as well be one I like ;-)

I was surprised how prominent the beer was in this recipe.  I thought the beer taste would cook off some; it didn't.  I added chili beans as I don't consider chili to be chili without beans.  This didn't pack a lot of flavor; and even though the description calls it hearty, I didn't consider this to be as hearty as other chilis.  It was okay though.

Needed an outstanding beans free chili recipe and couldn't find the one I usually use so I gave this a try.  I'm so glad I did.  I'm not even a beer fan and I found it delicious. I give it 4.5 stars!  Thanks so much for sharing!

A new favorite for us.  We skipped the chili peppers & hotsauce and used banana peppers so it's not too spicy for our little ones.  Loved it over rice.  Yum!

This is so delicious. I'm not a bean fan and am always looking for a good beanless recipe. I followed this exactly, and it's just perfect as is. My boyfriend who always has "helpful critiques" on pretty much anything simply stated: "This is the best chili I've ever had." I served it with some corn bread muffins and we had ourselves a great Football Sunday!

I made this chili twice both times a hit. Two suggestions. If you are going to do it in the slow cooker use tomato paste instead of sauce (too much liquid) and I thought it was a bit sweet. The second time I made it I started at 1tbsp. and taste tested it from there. Also I left out the hot sauce because my kids, 1yr and 2yrs, don't like hot food. Awesome, yummy and filling ^_^

I've been looking for a chili recipe without beans - and am SO very glad I found this!!!  Other than changing the Tabaso to 1 tbls, I made this recipe as posted.   I served it over spaghetti in a sourdough bread bowl, sprinkled with shredded cheddar & a dab of sour cream on top.   This recipe is a keeper!!!  Thanks Jenn for sharing!

We thought this was very good. My kids don't really like beans in chili so this recipe fit the bill. I prepared it exactly as printed. Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out really good I’ve been using this recipe for awhile now and it’s by far my favorite, during hunting season I add venison to it instead of beef and it works just as good the only thing with that is you don’t have to drain the fat because the fat ratio is less than beef would have! Also I added a little bit more spice but it’s all about your preference.

Great no-bean chili recipe! I used 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. ground turkey. I forgot to buy the beer and I didn't have time to run to the store so I subbed beef broth. I will try with beer next time, but it was great with broth.

This chili does not disappoint.  Based upon other reviewers I didn't use the full amount of chili powder.  I think I will next time.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it.

I followed the recipe except I used cider vinegar instead of white vinegar, 2 cans of Rotel chunky tomato & chili peppers instead of a can of chili peppers. I also added 1/2 a chopped green bell pepper with the onion and garlic.  I used PBR beer.

I decided to change it up.  I wanted to make more than the recipe so I included a large can of vegetable juice, a cup of Jack Daniels whiskey, and two cans of black beans.  If the kids like it, I’ve successfully done my job.

I made this recipe as a topping for a baked potato bar. I was looking for a thick chili without beans. I do not eat meat, so I was nervous about how this would turn out since I wouldn't be tasting it. It got really good reviews from my guests and my husband asked me to save the recipe for the future. My guests topped this with sour cream, homemade cheese sauce, and green onions. I did make one change - I omitted the beer as I had a couple guests that do not drink alcohol.

I used 1/2 of the 0.25oz chili powder container and I would nix the brown sugar. I had to kill the sweetness with the vinegar.

Did everything but the hot pepper sauce and I did a slow cooker for 4 hours.  I could hardly eat it. I question the beer I used as well?  I felt the chili pepper was a bit much for  any recipe but added it anyway and wish I hadn't added as much.  Normally I would toss the whole thing not wanting to waste more ingredients but I added another can of diced tomatoes, a can of tomato sauce and another beer  (as I read from someone else) and some pasta and I can now eat it but it's not a favorite by any means.

I've made this recipe 3 or 4 times now and it has become a real favorite during the colder months. It holds up to a lot of experimentation, which is great for me. I also really appreciate the absence of beans.

sooooo good!  Made it for a chili cook off and every last bit was gone!  I normally don't rate if I made changes, but I forgot to buy the diced green chili and was too lazy to go back to the store so I used a can of diced jalapeno that I had in cupboard, added a bit of a kick but still delish! Thanks for the great recipe, its a keeper!

Best beanless chili ever! Spicy but not too hot. Super good. I added have a tablespoon of extra brown sugar and melted cheddar on top of mine. I also used Franks red hot, instead of Tabasco. This recipe is AWESOME!

Absolutely  delicious.  Exactly the recipe I have been searching for.  I skipped the vinegar as others suggested, added some black beans (to suit my crowd) and everyone loved it.  It's a keeper!  Thank you.

Delicious! I left the vinegar out after reading a lot of the reviews. I used Busch Light beer (cheap but it's what was on hand). It didn't have a strong beer taste. Served it over Jasmine rice. Will definitely be making this again!

I added some heat. Substituted half the hamburger with dry rubbed and seared ribeye steak cubed small and a bundle of fine chopped cilantro. I also added a small amount of beans as I like beans in chili just not a lot. The base recipe is outstanding though. Highly recommend for GAME DAY!!!

I have been making this recipe for over two years now. It is delicious and I haven’t found a better chili recipe. I always double the recipe and freeze it in small portions to make chili dogs later. The only thing we do different is add chili beans to it.

I've made this recipe many times, it is my go-to for chili! It is very delicious and hearty! I think it helps to use a dark brown ale for the beer to bring good flavor.

This is a wonderful chili (No Beans) recipe! From now on this will be my go-to chili recipe.  I made it nearly as written except that I substituted 1 (15 ounce) can of pumpkin puree for the tomato sauce only because it was what I had in my pantry.  Even my pickiest eater ate a bowl and that is saying a great deal.

Per my family's preferences next time I will decrease the sugar, and I will use crushed tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes. Although I was l apprehensive  about using 1/3 cup of chili power, it was the right amount for us-- not too spicy--just right. I highly recommend this recipe!

Seemed like WAY too much chili powder - it was a bit overpowering, but the rest of the ingredient ratio was pretty good. I think I’d double the amount of tomatoes and halve the amount of chili powder if I make this again. Will probably also add corn which is a family favorite in chili. For a beanless option this is a good starting guideline but as is it’s not really a winner for me.

Followed recipe pretty close.   I added a green pepper while cooking the meat, onion and garlic.  Garlic, added about three extra cloves.  Used exact amounts of seasoning except chili seasoning was hot., skipped the tabasco. and used apple cider vinegar.  Also added two cans of chili beans.  So good!

I am a Texas girl but Chili is not my favorite. My husband loves it on a cold day and was asking me to make some. This recipe was a hit for both of us!!  I will be making this time & time again. I omitted the green chiles and added 1/2 teaspoon more cumin. The flavor is incredible. I have become a chili fan!!  Topped with a dollop of sour cream, shredded cheese and a few scallions. A side of Texas skillet cornbread. My husband is a happy man!!  This will be my go to Chili recipe from now on!

This chili is a go-to favorite in my house.  I’m very new to cooking, and I have been able to execute this recipe flawlessly many times.  My son is a picky eater, and he will even eat it with Fritos and shredded cheddar.  All the flavors combine into one of the best tasting chili recipes I have ever eaten.

I added about 1 tsp cayenne, as my kids like spicy, and it had a nice but not too overwhelming burn. I also used my instant pot, and I cooked on manual for 20 minutes, then did a quick release. I simmered for 30 minutes uncovered to allow some liquid to evaporate. I will definitely be making this again!

It was awesome! I hate beans and my boyfriend really doesn’t like chili, but we both went back for more. I cut the recipe in half since there is only two of us and that worked out perfectly. I also, as per suggestions on here, omitted the vinegar. For beer I used Bud Light Lime! Yummy. Also, Franks Red Hot for the hot sauce was a good choice.

Such a delicious recipe! I followed the recipe except that I used Mexican oregano in place of the basil and added the juice from the green chili’s as well. We will definitely be trying this recipe again :) The only suggestion I would make is that if you like your chili spicy, add more of the pepper sauce!

First chili recipe I've ever found that I love! Have made it many times now. Since I make this mainly in the fall I substitute apple cider vinegar instead on white and I use a nice pumpkin ale for the beer. My husband gets so excited whenever I make it. It is his favorite!

This recipe is fantastic as is. This is now my go to chili recipe. Everyone in my family absolutely loves it. I’ve done different things with the recipe just based on what I had on hand – without the beer for instance. The one thing I do regularly is use a pound of hamburger and half pound of pork sausage. I’ve also used ground turkey as others mentioned. We do like beans, so I usually add one can of light red kidney beans or some other chili being near the end of the cooking time.Most of the time I mix everything up and then put it in the crockpot for several hours rather than on top of the stove just so I can forget about it until dinner. We do like beans, so I usually add one can of light red kidney beans or some other bean near the end of the cooking time. You cannot go wrong with this recipe!

The only change I made was swapping the green chilies for 4 oz fresh chopped jalapeños (all seeds and white removed from the inside) we’re not a spice loving family and this was perfect! Thank you for a great bean-free chili!

Recipe is excellent!! Did a trial run for the Super Bowl, This is now our “go to” Chili! After the 3 hour cook, I needed to adjust the seasonings for my family’s personal taste. I added an extra 1/3C chili seasoning, 1Tlb Cumin, 1/2 Tlb Red Pepper flakes and 2 Tlb smoked paprika. (My spices were new and opened today). The Brown sugar gave a unique flavor however, I’ll eliminate or reduce next time. A bit too sweet for us. (I used a local brewery, “Big Boss” Porter for the beer). My husband is still raving how good the chili was!

Everyone loved it! I added a can of mild chili beans because we like beans in our chili. I agree with other postings that the beer can be omitted.

So yummy and  easy, I put all ingredients in the slow cooker for  10hrs on low.  No prep, minus the chopping of the  onion.
Definitely will be doing again!

Delicious! Was hesitant on the amount of chili powder, but it was very good! Only thing I did different was I added kidney beans and I cooked it in a crockpot. Next time I will use tomato paste instead of sauce if I cook in the crockpot again. Taste was great though!

This chili recipe was delicious! The only change I made was I added 2 squares of unsweetened chocolate and a little more cumin than it called for. Also, I only used one pound of ground beef because I didn't have two like the recipe calls for..but even with just one pound of beef, it was wonderful! Will definitely make it again.

I'll never make another chili recipe again!
I have always made my chili without beans, because, well...beans are gross (to me) - 
I made a few modifications to the recipe:
First, I made a double batch and used 2 lbs ground beef and 1 lb hot & spicy sausage and 1 lb maple sausage. I used a 1/2 cup chili powder - not on purpose, but that is the amount in a new regular sized spice container and it was just enough.  I also needed this to be gluten free and the grocery store I visited didn't have any gluten free beer, so I just used water in place of the beer.  I used apple cider vinegar because I had cleaning grade white vinegar; the apple cider worked just fine.  Everyone loved it.  I would say on a scale of 1 - 10 with 1 being extremely mild and 10 being sweating buckets, the heat factor on this is a 3.  Its just perfect.  Can't say enough about this one ! Thanks for creating it!

Excellent recipe just like it is written.  I have made it many times.  Now when I make it, I use ground sausage instead of ground hamburger, I double the diced tomatoes, and I add a can of corn.  My family enjoys it served with sour cream, shredded cheese, and cilantro.

This chili is absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe and also added beans (one can of rinsed cannellini because that's what I had on hand).  Some reviewers omitted the vinegar due to the beer in the recipe but I added both and the flavor was awesome.  Serving suggestions: Along with the shredded cheese, the family likes a dollop of sour cream and some chopped green onions.  My son likes it served over rice with corn added and shredded cheese on top. It was easy to make and I will definitely make it again!

For our tastes this was a bit too acidic.  It needed something to cut the acid.  It was nice to find a chili recipe that omits beans because my husband doesn't like them.  I ate it with sweet corn bread and that was a good accompaniment.

Excellent! A very comfortable (no sweat, no tears) and tasty heat from this traditional chili. 

Modifications:
- Made it with an IPA 
- Added 1 can of white kidney beans (it could have even used another can).
- Cooked for longer than 30 minutes with the lid off...closer to
90 minutes

It's currently simmering and it's really good. 

I had a pound of ground beef and a pound of sausage. I added a bit of beef broth for more liquid. I did not add chiles (the heartburn would kill me). I had two cans of chili ready diced tomatoes and a large can of stew tomatoes. I don't really measure my spices because I'm an idiot but apparently I did an alright job because this tastes so good. The beer, vinegar, and brown sugar freaked me out, but it's perfect. It's got a little kick to it (there is a lot of chili powder in it).

Loved how it didn't have beans - I didn't add ALL THE spices because I had children and elderly parents eating here . I added toppings of cheddar and Parmesan cheese and tortilla chips.

WE'RE IN LOVE!!! LOVED IT!!! Read through quite a few reviews first and although the reviews I read were good, I was a tad concerned or confused with the slight alterations that some people made to the recipe regarding the beer and the vinegar. I wasn't sure if I should follow the recipe exactly or try their alteration. Well....I decided to follow the recipe to the T and was glad I did! IT WAS PERFECT and DEEEELICIOUS! And even better the next day after it had time to sit and marinate in everything overnight. So delicious that my husband wants me to make a big batch for a meeting he has next week where he usually orders food out for everyone.  I wouldn't change anything with this recipe. You have to realize that everyone has different taste preferences and before you make your own alterations, try the original recipe first.  Oh, the beer I used was Miller Light.  That was another concern because the recipe doesn't tell you what type of beer to use.

This is really good chili.  I used less salt for low sodium purposes and a little less onion (mostly because I had a monster sized onion) and I also used a marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce.... It turned out great! It was loved by the husband. It even tasted like there were beans in it but no beans! This was important to us because my body does not agree with beans.... Overall it was a great recipe.

As a true Texas girl, I have made a LOT of chili in 47 years. This was my best ever! Easy to assemble, had everything in house - substituted whole tomatoes mashed for chopped; added 1/2 can of petite diced since I had 1 extra pound of venison - a few slices of candied jalapenos and VOILA! Can I just say YUM! Oh, and add a little water or broth if it is too thick!

I cut the chili powder in HALF as my family is not ones for hot spicey foods.  It was just right.  I also left out the green chilies for the same reason.  Though my family ate it,  it wasn't a fabulous recipe. I won't make it again, but maybe without the spicey hot flavor it doesn't do it justice.  I would not recommend making those adjustments, or if you do, find another flavor to replace it.

This was very good, I omitted the vinegar (because I forgot to buy it) and it was still great.  Added green pepper for some color.  It was delicious to watch football on a cold Sunday!

I decided to try this recipe for chili day at work. I was glad to find a recipe without beans since some of my co-workers prefer that. I substituted a couple of things. I used beef broth instead of beer, crushed tomatoes instead of diced tomatoes and then used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. It made the chili a bit heartier. I also left the vinegar out based on other reviews I read before making it. I also left out the hot sauce. I was initally concerned about the amount of chili powder but was pleasantly surprised at the delicious flavor. We will most likely add black beans when we make if for ourselves. I brought a little bit home from work, and we are going to use it for chili cheese dogs tonight for dinner. This recipe is a keeper!!!

I made it just like the recipe but went a little light on the vinegar and added two cans of kidney beans. It was great the day we ate it and even better two days later. We didn't like the sour cream added but would have liked cheddar cheese on it.

This was pretty great. I will admit, I usually prefer beans in my chili, but this was delicious without them, so if that's your preference, this is a good one! I used a local brewery's coffee stout, and the deep, rich flavor was a wonderful compliment.

"By the way...we can have this again.  Please." -My significant other at dinner this week, eating this chili.

Anytime he gives my cooking high praise, we both win - and this chili is a superstar!

Subs:  two 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes with chilis for both the chili peppers and tomatoes called for in the recipe.  

Adds:  half bag frozen corn, 1 cup shredded carrot, a few shakes of Tabasco Jalapeño sauce.

Topped with chunks of sharp white cheddar and a dollop of lite sour cream.  Served with cheddar croissants or Trader Joe's corn dippers (their version of scoopy Fritos).  This is MY chili, now! :D

My husband and I loved this chili and can't wait to make it again!  Very easy and no unusual ingredients. I left out the vinegar and cut out a little of the chili powder. Still spicy enough for us!

This chili was so amazing! I've been searching for a good hearty chili recipe that didn't have beans in it and this was just spot on! I invited my mom and brother to dinner when I made this and my brother is still raving about it a week later. I did add extra seasoning to it like paprika and extra cumin and chili powder. I also didn't have any Tabasco so I used banana pepper juice. It was the perfect addition to this recipe. I also used a bottle of Landshark for the beer. This recipe is definitely a keeper in my house!

Excellent combination...I didn't have any beer on hand so i substituted a strong brewed 6 oz cup of coffee.  I also mixed chipotle chili pepper in with the chili powder for a kick and smoky flavor (about a half tsp).  GREAT recipe!

I never have beer in the house so I ended up leaving that out as well as the tobasco sauce (people in my house can't eat it). I think it came out great and I think would be perfect (the way I did it) as a topper for hot dogs.

Delicious! I added chicken broth to thin and extra hot sauce. Substituted venison for sausage and Mexican oregano since I'm not a fan of basil. Best Texas style chili I've tried in a long time and I cook a new recipe of chili a minimum of 3 times a year, looking for my latest favorite. Out of years of trying new recipes, I only have 2 in permanent rotation. This version will now be my third! Great by itself or over other foods.

The first time I made it I didn't have vinegar so I used cooking wine and it was very delicious.

The 2nd time, someone convinced me to add bacon and IT IS NOT GOOD like that.  

The next time I will make it exactly as it says.

Oh, this is good! We live in southern New Mexico, so please, be prepared for some heat if you try my adjustments. I halved this recipe, added extra green chiles, like 8 ounces of fresh roasted green chile, I also added a tsp. of cayenne  and a good sprinkle of pepper flakes and served over zucchini noodles (low carbin" it) with a healthy (and I mean large) topping of jalapeno jack and cheddar.  With a salad, this was an amazing dinner!!!

I loved this recipe!  The different flavors really blended well for a unique tasting chili.  I ate a bowl of it and then realized there were no beans in it.  I've never made chili without beans, but I really liked this one!  I followed the recipe exactly but only used 4 cloves of garlic.  I used a can of Bud Light for the beer.  I will definitely make this again and recommend this recipe!

This was a really good chili recipe!  I 1/2'd the recipe since there's only 2 of us.  Per the reviews, I only did 2 heaping tablespoons of chili powder (used 1 lb meat) and 6 oz ginger ale instead of beer.  The flavor was perfect. Didn't need anything else. I did add a can of dark red kidney beans with the other canned items just for a little extra protein.  I will be using this as my staple chili recipe from now on!

Good beanless chilil. I wanted them left out to save on calories and this was hearty even without. I have to say I left out the chiles because I forgot to grab them at the store, but otherwise made as written. I did notice the flavor got better over the course of the three hour simmer so if you can, don't skimp on the cook time.

I made it and I don't eat meat but my husband and children do - they liked this a whole lot!  It's on the please make again soon list. I added a can of kidney beans only because my one kid said it isn't chili without beans. Other than that I followed the recipe.

We loved the recipe. I fixed it as is a couple of months ago except no vinegar. I think today when I make it, I'll go with 1/3 of the brown sugar-it was a tad too sweet. Tastes great served with cheese and oyster crackers.

I was looking for a beanless chili to make for family and ran across this recipe.  It is wonderful!  Everyone raved about how good it was.  I subbed 1 lb of Jimmy Dean hot sausage for a 1lb of the ground beef...just because I love the flavor of sausage in chili!  I served it with green onions, sour cream, cheese and fritos to top it with... and I will definitely make this again!

I was looking for a no-bean chili and this hit the spot. Was hoping to make something "Hormel-like" for my picky kid but ended up having only a smokier chili powder in my cabinet. Turned out great for the rest of us! I think if I take out the extra green chilies (what's in the tomato dice will be enough) and get regular chili powder this is going to be one all of us will love.

I used this for chili dogs and it went over rather well. Stuck to the recipe and used pbr to keep things classey. Some onions and Tillamook extra sharp cheddar on top seemed appropriate and helped tie everything together.

I absolutely love this recipe! I make it often and it's always a huge hit with my family. I add a 24 ounce can of spicy baked beans, some chopped bell pepper, reduce the brown sugar by half, omit the vinegar and, since i grew up eating Cincinnati chili, I added 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon. Then I pour it all into the slow cooker for 6 to 7 hours. amazing! kiddos to the poster of this awesome recipe! :-)

This chili was a hit with my family--especially with  my husband because he does not like beans! After reading a few reviews, I omitted the vinegar. Since it was my first time making it and I was taking it to a party, I didn't know if the vinegar would overpower the chili. I used Sam Adams for the beer (per suggestion of a different recipe), and Louisiana hot sauce (because that's what I had in my pantry).  I also added 1/2 the amount of chili powder at first and then added more later based on taste. (1/3 cup seemed like a lot!)
Overall, a great chili!  It had a nice sweet undertone from the beer and brown sugar, and then a slow creeping burn from the hot sauce! I definitely recommend this chili and will be making it again!

Very good, but I made some changes.  I used about 2.5 lbs of meat (ground turkey), so the 1/3 cup of chili powder worked well.  I omitted the beer entirely to make this a gluten-free dish.  I did add the vinegar, but also about a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.  I used Chipotle Tabasco (1 teaspoon) and only added about 1/2 teaspoon of Himalayan sea salt.  (I am on a low-sodium diet.)  Once it started to boil, I moved it to the Crockpot and let it simmer on high for an hour before digging in.  While eating, I let the rest continue simmering for another 2 hours.

Absolutely amazing!!! I've made this a few times .....each time is better then the next. A couple times I used 1 cup of red wine instead of beer, changed the flavor a little, but still tasted great. I highly recommend this chili recipe.

Fantastic!  This was very easy to make for a football afternoon meal.  I tasted it several times during the three hour simmering and it continued to get better as the flavors combined.  I included all the ingredients including the beer and vinegar that some folks have excluded.  The heat was just right from the chili powder using a full 1/3 cup. I also split the pot after cooking and added 1 can of kidney beans to that half. That way we had both a beanless and with beans.  Both were very good.  Topped off with Sour Cream and Sharp Cheddar.

Since I do not like beans this is my go to chili recipe.  I have used all kinds of meats in place of or in addition to ground beef including Italian sausage and various cubed steak cuts.  I also throw in shallots and red peppers. Serve with extra jalapenos, your favorite hot sauce, and sour cream.  The best.

I made this recipe tonight and it was great! I made it using all the ingredients it called for except I changed the white vinegar to apple cider vinegar, I used onion powder instead of onions (not a big onion fan), and I added a whole can of tomato paste to thicken it up a bit. Everything was so tasty! I topped it off with some cheese and sour cream! I will definitely be making this again!

Absolutely delicious chili!  Used Negra Modelo beer and added a few diced jalapeños for extra spice.  Made it the slow cooker and topped with sour cream and habanero jack cheese. It's my new favorite!  Thanks for sharing.

Really good and simple. Only thing is that it's not hearty enough. Would like an addition of beans. Regardless, strong 4 star.

I made this for my family. They raved over it! They said it was better than my home-made. Oh well, at least they loved it. I added jalapeño black beans along with Steakhouse recipe Grillin' beans to it as well & used Franks hot sauce instead of Tabasco. Nice thing about chili, is one can use whatever is in the cupboard to add a slight different spin. Turned out delicious!

I've made this half a dozen times now, and my whole family loves this chili! Not a fan of beans, so this is the perfect recipe! I have tried this recipe without the chilies when I'm not in the mood for spicy food, and it always turns out the way I want it to. Would highly recommend it to friends and family members!

I too can't stand beans, but love chili.  I found this recipe to be fantastic.  The only thing i changed was i added a few jalapenos to the green chiles.  That's simply because i personally like a little more heat.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I was skeptical but this recipe went over well so it's a keeper! I didn't add the vinegar or the brown sugar either as we prefer more savory than sweet. The kids especially like it because it is not too spicy for kids and it doesn't have beans.

We left out the chiles because I honestly never buy them ... our kids don't care for added spiciness.  We sadly have a bean allergy in the family so I need a beanless chili recipe on hand.  This one is very yummy.  I did substitute pork broth for the beer, and might take the chili powder down to 1/4c next time.  Thanks for the recipe - a good one is hard to find without beans as an ingredient!

My hubby loves this! My changes: 1# ground beef, 1# ground pork; no vinegar; 1 bay leaf; 1 can Bush's chili beans (hubby's request). BTW, I haven't told him the 'secret ingredient' is beer!

I cooked it exactly like the recipe except that I didn't let it simmer for 3 hours. I'm sure it would have been even better if I had. I have been looking for a flavorful chili recipe for awhile and love this one. I have gotten several compliments on it.

Everyone has a different idea of chili depending on wher you were raised... For me (a Midwest girl), I did not care for this at all.  That's not to say its a terrible recipe, so 3 stars.  My husband (Texas) also didn't like it very well.  I followed the directions.  I agree with the mass majority of reviewers that the vinegar AND beer should be omitted.  I only used a small Belgian lite wheat beer due to the reviews... Anyway, not every recipe is a hit!

I wasn't looking for a beanless recipe but I came across this one and it sounded like it would be flavourful and it certainly was.  I changed nothing except I added kidney beans :)  It was perfect and it got rave reviews on my ice fishing trip!!!  Thanks for sharing...I'm sure this one will become a family fave!

Fixed this for a Seahawks/Broncos Superbowl party today. Yikes! Way too sweet!  I'm trying to cook wheat free for the hubby, so used ginger ale like others had posted.  That on top of the brown sugar was way too sweet!  I must have added an extra 3-4 ounces of vinegar to counter it!  If I make this again, I'll sacrifice the wheat and use beer... and way less brown sugar!

No alcohol for this family, so went with the ginger ale alternative. This is just an amazing recipe. I always forget the simmer time, so I've had to make it in less time and it is still great!!

We make this pretty much every other week all fall and winter. My husband doesn't like beans in his chili, and this is the best beanless chili I have found. I mostly follow the recipe, except sometimes add some diced fresh peppers and 1/2 cup of canned pumpkin, then we grab a bag of fritos to complete the meal. Always make extra, since as with all chilis, this is better the next day.

Good, but too hot for our young kids.  I even cut the cumin & chilli powder in half.

I agree with other reviewers: the beer taste is far too prominent in this dish. I wish I had left out the beer or substituted ginger ale as BonAppetitBaby did. If I make this dish again, I will leave out the beer for certain.

Holy cow! I never made chili before because my husband hates beans. I made this beanless chili last night and it was amazing!! Everyone loved it! I followed the recipe with just two exceptions: I diced one jalapeno (no seeds) and added it when I cooked the meat and onions. I also replaced the one can of tomato sauce (boring!) with one can of the Hunts Manwich Bold & Spicy sloppy joe sauce. This chili was restaurant quality good! I can't wait to have leftovers for dinner tonight!! A++

I tried this recipe for the first time two weeks ago.  I have made it twice now and it looks like it will be a staple in this house.  Made exactly as written and my husband and dad both love it.  The leftovers are put away for snacks and never last long.  I make it at least once a week to keep for just that reason.  My dad just can't get enough and my husband really enjoys it, too.  Good as a fresh recipe, leftovers are better!

I had everything I needed (except beer) to make this without a special trip to the store, so decided to make it last night to have the next day.  Oh my goodness!  It is sooo good!  Since I didn't have beer, I added a can of V8 instead.  Tried it with some shredded cheddar this morning, but will try it with spaghetti or on a hotdog later.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thank you for sharing!!

This was a great chili.  I was looking for a good chili without beans. I didn't add the tomato and only used half the beer and only 2 tablespoons of brown sugar because 3 made it too sweet for my taste.  This was great and will definitely make it again.

Used dehydrated minced garlic, left out the beer and hot sauce. My husband said it was the best chili he's ever had (and he really liked chili the way I used to make it). I left half without the beans for my daughter and added a can of kidney beans and a can of black beans to ours. YUM!

Awesome Recipe!!  It is now a fan of all the girls I work with.  For a little change you could add chili beans.

This chili had a good taste, but someone must've drank the other 5 beers before eating it...way,way too spicy...way too much chili powder in it. Heartburn is only a bowl away!

I don't like chili but my family does.  Used this recipe and they loved it!!  Great for football Sunday around the house.  Served it over some cornbread with a spoonful of sour cream.
