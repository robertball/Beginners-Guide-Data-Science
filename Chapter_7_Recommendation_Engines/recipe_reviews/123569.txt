I made a few minor changes and was totally wowed. I've already been asked for the recipe. (changes were made to recipe scaled down to make 12 muffins)

Add an additional 1/8 tsp salt
change to 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar
whole wheat flour
add 1/4 tsp coconut extract
use entire bag of frozen bluberries

Adding the extra blueberries seems to have made my batter give me 18 muffins instead of 12.

Delicious!

I just made these muffins.  I searched for a recipe that used frozen blueberries as I had them on hand. I followed the recipe exactly, but did not use the ginger/sugar on top.  I did use the granulated sparkling sugar since we don't care for gingery flavors.  Hubby is in heaven on earth for the moment.  I got 12 regular and 6 jumbo muffins from this recipe.  They are moist, flavorful and hard to keep from eating one after the other :)  Even though there is just two in our household, bet I have a tough time getting many into the freezer!  Try this and enjoy!  7/28/09: I tried a recipe from a country cookbook and it did not compare to this one at all!  What a waste of time it was, but this one is the bomb!  No more new recipes for blueberry muffins at our house!

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!  This is a great recipe.  I love that you can use frozen blueberrys.  But I did just use them frozen insted of thawing them.  It still cam out great.  I noticed that when you thaw them thet burst and turn mushey(Maine high bush blueberrys). They keep their shape, that way when you bite into the muffin you eat bluberry and not blueberry bits.  The batter will be thick because its so cold.  Don't worry they turn out great.
 Again LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe.

Frozen berries really do make the best muffins, imo. These were no exception. I made a few small changes to reflect what I had on hand. I did make a half recipe of this. I used whole wheat white flour, lowfat buttermilk and because I did not have enough butter for the whole recipe so I used half melted butter, half vegetable oil. After mixing up the batter, I did add in another cup of berries. It just didn't seem like enough. These turned out so good. Moist, flavorful and just perfect. Double the berries is a must, I don't think it would have been as good with just a cup (for a half recipe=12). Five stars with the additional berries. NOTE: I always bake my muffins at 350 degrees. Just under 20 minutes was just right. Also, to prevent tough muffins or overmixed dough, wisking together the dry ingredients in one bowl and then wisking the wet ingredients together in a seperate bowl and then folding the dry into the wet until just moistened will give you better results. It always works for me but I'll tell you, it took me a long time to learn that!

This recipe was just what I was looking for. I used King Arthur flour and that made these muffins terrific. I loved the nutmeg on top. Generally, I would mix sugar with cinnamon and sprinkle on the tops. But, the nutmeg gives it a new flavor. Can't wait to make another batch this weekend.

I made these for my moms' group this morning and everyone really liked them.  A little lemon zest and fresh squeezed lemon juice gave the muffins an extra boost.

These were AWESOME!  i didn't have enough white sugar, so I substituted one cup of the white sugar for brown sugar... so half and half, white and brown.  I also added a tablespoon of lemon juice to the milk to make it like buttermilk.  They came out moist and delicious... and the nutmeg/sugar topping added a really unique and tasty touch.

All the way from Christchurch, New Zealand, I thank you for perfect blueberry muffins! :0) 
I didnt use the topping, I just dusted the tops with confectioners sugar (we here call it icing sugar!) 
I must have a very small muffin pan here though cus we got 24 muffins- I no complain though because the first batch didnt last long. Thank you!!!

I loved this recipe.  The muffins got so fat and looked just like the ones you buy from the store or Dunkin.  I did not add the extra  salt, though because the baking powder can  be pretty salty.  I would suggest sifting the baking powder and mixing VERY well with the flour.  I made this recipe twice: first time I did not sift the baking powder and it was delicious except I got one or two bites that were a little bitter tasting from baking powder.  Sifting the baking powder and mixing very well before hand did the job.  Also, I creamed the butter with one cup of brown sugar, then creamed another cup of white sugar with the eggs until it bubbled up to try and make them even fatter and lighter.  Then I mixed the eggs and sugar and creamed butter and sugar with the dry ingredients.  

THIS IS THE BEST MUFFIN RECIPE I HAVE TRIED SO FAR! With a few minor adjustments it really is close to PERFECT.

Very very good!  The secret is DON'T OVERMIX!  This batter is very thick.  Had to be careful not to break the frozen berries.  I only changed the flavorings because I'm not a huge fan of nutmeg,  Added 1 tblsp lemon juice for some zing and doubled the vanilla because I always do.  I didn't do the topping either.  I brushed the warm muffins with melted butter and sprinkled with coarse sugar.  Wonderful treat on a cool morning.  Thanks.

My son wanted blueberry muffins and I only had frozen ones.  This recipe was good, but I don't think they would have much flavor if I didn't sprinkle the tops with Cinnamon and Sugar (didn't use nutmeg).  I also added some wheat bran (about 1/4 cup) with the flour mixture to add something healthy!  Put in about 1 1/2 cups of blueberries.  Will make again with whole wheat flour.

Very Good!  The only suggestions I have is to not over mix and that the dough is stiff when putting it in the muffin tins, because of the frozen blueberries. I also would add more blueberries.

I don't rate many recipes but this turned out sooo yummy I had to say something! I too scaled it down for 12 muffins and used 1 cup ww flour and 1 cup all purpose. I also used 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white. Like other reviewers I added some cinnamon and lemon juice. The muffins had an awesome texture, not too cakey but not too light. They were sweet but the tartness of the blueberries balanced it out. Oh and I accidentally added more than 1 c of blueberries, like at least an extra 1/4! Anyways, very yummy muffins! I'll definitely be making them again!

I love this recipe and have made it numerous times.  I sub WW pastry flour for all of the flour and use raw sugar.  I also use a blend of blueberries and rasberries.  The muffins are so moist and delicious.  No one would know I made them whole grain since I chock it full of fruit (double what the recipe calls for).

Disappointed ... the muffins came out extremely dense; I didn't enjoy the texture.  I felt they were a bit bland and lacking in flavor as well.  I liked being able to use frozen blueberries directly, but I will try to incorporate frozen berries into a different recipe.  I won't be using this one again.

I made a few errors with these that turned out okay! Firstly, I totally forgot the topping. Secondly, I didn't set the timer so they overcooked to a dark brown, and they were GREAT! I was so worried they would be burnt, but they were crispy and nice on the outside, and soft and white on the inside. Wonderful! I love these muffins! Don't be afraid to cook them a little longer.

This recipe was awesome. It was a cold rainy morning when I first made theses. They filled the house with an amazing aroma! I made some changes because I had no milk. I scaled this down to half a batch and whipped unsalted butter with 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar in my kitchenaid until light and fluffy (much like the beginnings of a cookie recipe). I then beat the eggs and added those and the vanilla. Instead of using milk I used 1/2 cup mayo. After that was combined well added I about 1/4 cup lemonaid and 1 1/2 cups blueberries. I toppped them with a cinnamon brown sugar mixture. They baked for about 21 minutes and were crazy good! Perfect consistancy!

This is an excellent base recipe for muffins using frozen berries, which is just what I was looking for. I did make some alterations based on what I had on hand. Since I had frozen mixed berries as opposed to just blueberries, I used those with excellent results. I also substituted 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat pastry flour, which resulted in a more, shall we say, substantial muffin. But being someone who prefers the flavor and texture that whole wheat imparts, I was really happy with that. I also added the juice of two poor sad blood oranges that were languishing in my fruit bowl, and they added a lovely subtle sweet/tart flavor that complemented the berries perfectly. The muffins themselves baked up tall and pretty, although they did fall apart a bit when I attacked them while hot. Once they cooled, they were a lot easier to handle. I will be making this recipe with and without variations often! Thanks for posting!

These were really very simple to prepare and they turned out great!  I really would not skip the nutmeg/sugar topping because without it, I don't think these would have much of a flavor at all.  The topping really adds to the recipe.

Oh my gracious! Delicious!!

Made a couple of customizations, thus the 4 stars.
To cut fat, instead of 1 cup butter, used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce. This seemed to help with the density problem some people complained of as well.

To health it up a little, used 1/2 and 1/2 white and whole wheat flour. Was concerned that it would end up tasting "too healthy" but it's perfect.

I omitted the sugar/nutmeg topping to save a few calories, and you don't even miss it.  The top is crispy and slightly sweet anyway from the batter.

Saved as a fave!

This made 36 muffins and then some for me (w/ tin liners). Need to half it next time. I may not be able to fill them as full at high altitude, but I think either way it makes more than described.

My 2 year old and I made these for brunch yesterday - Delicious :)
I was worried about the thickness but they baked up wonderfully.
 I did NOT add the topping since we were having other sweets and I did not think they needed extra sugar.
My parents and all 4 of my kids loved these and I have already shared the recipe on facebook.
Thank you for a recipe for frozen berries

This recipe was a great find. We buy the large bag of blueberries at our local price club, and I am always trying to find ways to use them up. The muffins were buttery,rich and moist. I prefer the taste when they cool. You can better appreciate the delicate flavors. But it was hard to have any left, they are devoured right out of the oven. Next time I will bake some when no one is home.

These are amazing. To make them even healthier I used all whole-wheat flour, omitted the topping and I never use salt in any of my baking.  Also I baked them at 350 for 30 minutes.    Loved them loved them loved them :)

The muffins were good but not nearly as good as I expected them to be. I expected them to be sweeter than they actually were, in fact they were a bit bland in the spots without any blueberries. Of course this could just be because I made some changes to the recipe. I did half all purpose flour and half whole wheat. I also did brown sugar instead of regular sugar and cinnamon instead of nutmeg. Everyone else thought they were amazing though 5 stars :)

These came out tasting like store-bought blueberry muffins. And I mean that in a good way! They weren't particularly distinctive, but for me they were the platonic ideal of what "blueberry muffins" should be. I got a number of compliments on these.

Followed recipe up until the sugar/nutmeg topping.  Very good muffins.  Frozen blueberries just pop in your mouth when you bite into these muffins.  Batter is denser but good flavor.  Family and coworkers enjoyed.

I substituted half of the all purpose flour with whole wheat and the muffins turned out great!  They were a hit with all of the kids and adults at a neighborhood get together.

I thought these were very good muffins.  I only made a minor change just due to own preference...using half brown sugar and half white and not adding the topping.  Thanks much...these were so much better than the recipe I have used previously.

I have been using this recipe for at least a year.  My husband moves rigs, so I make a batch of these and ship them off to work...he shares with his co-workers and now everyone is always asking for them.  I don't change a thing, I use the original recipe and I get perfect muffins every time.

The muffins came out really dense and kind of bland.  My son loves blueberry muffins and was not a fan of these.  Followed the recipe, so I don't know what went wrong.  I might add some brown sugar and more milk next time.

Pretty good.  Skipped the topping though, course we're not nutmeg fans.  Don't know how they got 24 servings, unless they don't count one serving as one muffin.  I got quite a bit more.

Definitely best warm. The butter made them "hard" when they were cold (heated up in the microwave, they were good). This was my first attempt at blueberry muffins and I really did enjoy these. My kids loved them, too.

A quick an easy recipe. Very yummy. We make a lot of smoothies around here so I usually have a bag of frozen blueberries in the freezer. It's nice to have a recipe that uses frozen instead of fresh. I didn't adapt the recipe at all, but they did take about 30 minutes to cook. Will definitely make again!

These aren't bad, though I didn't think there was anything special about them either.  The batch made 30 muffins for me and though the muffin paper was greasy on the bottom, the muffins seemed a bit dry.

These were hard, tasteless, and truly inedible.  One reviewer commented on not overmixing, which could possibly be the problem.  But I definitely would not recommend this recipe.  There are many others that are far better.  I think the basic problem may have been too much flour. I also used Splenda, but I've never had any prior difficulty using it in bakingl

I made 12 muffins and an 8" square cake with this recipe. The muffins took less than 20 minutes to cook. We ate the cake the next day: it was wonderful!! Moist and tasty. I used about 3 cups of frozen blueberries, rather than 2.

Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!!!
--Mom here: We used mini muffin cups (24) for half the batter, they were done at 22 minutes, and big bear shapes (6) for the other half, those took 30 minutes. The batter was a little too much for all these pans. We will do this again. 
BTW my daughter is 9.

These are fantastic! I didn't have blueberries so I used the same amount of mixed frozen berries. I also added a couple squeezes of fresh lemon juice and a 1/4 tsp of the zest.

I would reduce the number of blueberries and possibly cut them into smaller pieces.  My family thought that there was too much "juice" in them which made them a bit too moist.  The batter was really tough to work with once the frozen berries were poured into it.

Often find fault with everything I make, but these muffins are easy and the best I've ever eaten. Cut recipe in half and still got 14 muffins for my efforts. Skipped the salt (butter was salted) and skimped on the white sugar and avoided the nutmeg topping. I'm thinking I ended up with a healthier muffin that way. And the taste? *****

My first attempt and it turned out very well. My fiance loved it!! The flavor was very good and quite moist. I did not put the toppings on because i didn't want to add on more calories. It wasn't a 5 star for me because i felt that it could be better. It could be a bit more moist for my taste and i just feel as though something was missing. 
Now, if anyone have any suggestions on how i can make it more moist - pls let me know. But overall- it turned out very well, very easy to make and i will use this recipe again :o)

They turned out pretty good but I did add more milk to them as the batter was pretty dry, but I did use King Arthur Whole Wheat flour.  The topping was different but tasted good.  I also halved the recipe to 12.

Delicious blueberry muffins!  I made half of the recipe and it made 17 decent size muffins.  Absolutely loved the topping, it gave them a little crispness to the muffin and a touch of sweetness.  I read that one reader added lemon zest and some juice.  I adjusted the vanilla, and used half vanilla half lemon extract.  What a lovely flavour they have.  Husband and I ate 3 each before supper!  Son popped 2  in his mouth as soon as he got in from work!  This recipe is a keeper.

My boyfriend adores these muffins.  He's told me they are his favourite of all time.  A few minor alterations: I used 1/2 marg and 1/2 butter out of convenience (I'm contemplating all marg next time, they are rich), instead of frozen blueberries alone I used Europes Best frozen fieldberry mix, I used brown sugar instead of white as a personal preference, finally I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp cinammon because we lilke those spices.

I tried this recipe and it turned out fantastic! Try to use the freshest blueberries possible for best taste. I didn't change a thing and likely will keep it this way the next time I make it. Try to eat them while they're still hot.  They're not too sweet and have just the right of amount of flavor.

These came out dry and with no flavor at all.  Hard for me to turn down anything sweet but I did with these.  Very disappointed as the recipe called for a lot of ingredients.  The sugar/nutmeg topping was pointless as it provided no flavor at all.

Awesome!  I've never made muffins before but thought I'd give it a try since I had all the ingredients on hand and my husband has a breakfast potluck at work tomorrow that he just told me about today!  The recipe is super easy to follow and resulted in delicious, moist muffins.  I only made 2 changes - I added a little more blueberries (probably a total of 2 1/2 cups) and I topped them with a sugar/cinnamon mixture instead of the sugar/nutmeg.
