This recipe tasted great! The only problem I had was with getting the "crunchy" stuff to be crunchy...I baked it in a glass baking dish first and then  moved it into a bigger shallower dish and spread it out and baked it a bit more until it looked more golden in color. After it cooled a bit I broke it into smaller pieces to cool a little more...any suggestions would be great!

Very tasty. It took a little longer for the crunchy stuff to brown. My husband loved it!
