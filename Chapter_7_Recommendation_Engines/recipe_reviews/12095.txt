We picked a lot of mulberries at a friend's house, but none of us really liked them too much. I thought putting them in a pie with something else would help, so I tried this. It is outstanding! It tastes like neither mulberries or rhubarb, and we loved it. Dicing the rhubarb is a great improvement over cutting it in big chunks the way people seem to do with strawberry rhubarb pie.
I did cut the sugar back to 3/4 c because 1 1/2 c seemed like too much for four cups of fruit. I also added a few dashes of salt.
Be prepared to spend a long time removing stems from your mulberries! I wasn't sure if it would be worthwhile, but this is probably the best pie I have ever made.

I have to say, I love rhubarb pie.  I have always found strawberry/rhubarb pie to be a little over-rated, so I wasn't too sure how mulberry/rhubarb pie would come out...I now know that mulberries are the perfect compliment to rhubarb.  This pie is not only superb, but the color is wonderful.  It's a lavender-blue.  I made two of these pies for family and they were gone in no time.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good pie!  However, on the ingredients list, you list only a "single" crust. Then it says to add a top crust.  The ingredients list should state 2 crusts. 

I had enough pie dough for one crust, so I got the whole thing together and then discovered I needed another crust.  Disappointing. But the flavor was excellent.

I just can't say enough about this pie! I made it tonight as dessert for dinner with friends and it was AMAZING! Easily the best pie I've ever had, and my family loves pie. It was just the right combination of tangy and sweet, and my friends raved about it. I think this will be a regular on the menu as long as I can get hold of mulberries and rhubarb. I did tweak it slightly. I used 2.5 cups of mulberries and about 4 cups of diced rhubarb (had a lot on hand), only 3/4 cup of brown sugar and about 1/3 cup of whole wheat flour to the filling. I let it sit for about 3 hours before filling and baking the pie. I used store bough crusts this time, but it still turned out amazing. I would gladly recommend this recipe and will be making it throughout the season! Thanks so much!

If I could give 6 stars I would...fantastic tasting pie.  I did increase the mulberries and the rhubarb by a 1/2 cup (had extra) and I added 3tbsp. of instant tapioca.  The pie wasn't runny at all.  Ab Fab!

YUMMY!! This is the best pie that I have ever made. I increased the berries and rhubarb by 1/2 cup. I used 1/2 c. sugar and 1/2 c. splenda. It was plenty sweet. I also heaped the 1/4 c flour to make sure it wasn't runny with the additional fruit. This is now a family favorite!! If you love a slightly sweet/slightly tart pie, this is the one to try.

This far surpassed what I was expecting.  It makes the purple fingers from picking and nipping worthwhile.  The combination of rhubarb and Mulberries creates the best flavor!  I freeze a pie's worth in a freezer bag and grab one out of the freezer and let it thaw in the fridge throughout the winter.  All you need then in to pour it in a crust and bake away!  Pure Heaven!

Outstanding!  

We got rhubarb from neighbors on one side and a white mulberry in our other neighbor's yard.  I don't know the first thing about rhubarb, so on a whim, I Googled "mulberry rhubarb" and whaddya know?  

I had my doubts about this recipe but thought what the heck, the fruit is free, give it a try.

The result dramatically exceeded my expectations.  The bland mulberry sweetness perfectly balances the ultratart rhubarb; proportions of both are just right.  (Threw in a few leftover blueberries too, to no ill effect).

It was so good, I'm going to ask the neighbor if I can pick more of her mulberries.

My family loved this, even though I myself don't really enjoy mulberries. We had to use up the mulberries from our yard, and we only like them in pies. This was great with the rhubarb.

What a great fruit pie! Like so many others, I had fresh rhubarb that needed to be used and mulberries dropping from the tree outside. There is something rewarding about knowing that your pie was made out of entirely fresh ingredients!

I'm not a pie baker.  I've never had a rhubarb pie and never had a mulberry anything.  Just happened to have both on hand this week from a weekly veggie box I get during the summer.  So, why not try it, huh?  Boy, I was surprised.  It's delicious!  So worth it.  I'd make it ON PURPOSE next time!

This is a very good mulberry pie. My family and I liked it, and we do not like plain mulberries alone. I think it is a wonderful recipe!

Yum! This is sooooo good. We have mulberry trees everywhere around us just growing on the sides of the country roads. I had never used them before. I soaked the mulberries in water overnite and washed them well in a colander the next morning to get all the bugs off. I will be picking and freezing all I can so we can make this again!

My mother-in-law told me she could never figure out what to do with mulberries because everything she made turned out bland.  I found this recipe and tried it.  We have a mulberry tree in the back and I grew up with quite a few of them around, too.  It turned out great.  I used about 3/4-1 cup of sugar and 1/2 cup more of both the mulberries and rhubarb.  Everybody liked it, even my mother-in-law.  We're going to keep this one and keep using it!

Thanks to the wonders of nature, a mulberry tree has grown on our property with this being the first year with fruit.  Since my husband loves rhubarb pie I thought this would be a good recipe to try.  I took it to a dinner at our neighbors and everyone loved the taste and the beautiful color.  Next time I make it I may add more rhubarb to make it a bit more tart.

This pie is really good. I'm not entirely fond of mulberries, but still really enjoyed the pie. I think raspberries would also work well with this recipe! Thanks so much for sharing Bev T.

Very, very good! I wish I had taken a photo! We had an abundance of mulberries and this was an excellent way to use them up. We paired it with a flaky whole wheat crust and ate it hot out of the oven. I bet it would be scrumptious with some vanilla ice cream!

I passed a mulberry tree as I walked through the neighborhood, and picked some mulberries. Now what to do with them. Found this recipe and gave it a try. We enjoyed it very much. I added some extra mulberries (3 c. total) and some extra rhubarb (2 1/2 c. total), and some extra sugar to compensate for the extra fruit (1 1/2 c total). It wasn't too sweet for us.

Made this in 2015, for a pie baking contest, only thing I did different was I use the pie crust from the peach sour cream pie, that's some good crust for fruit pies, still good after three days, well anyway, took 1st for mulberry/Rhubarb pie, 3rd for peach sour cream, and best of show, and I'm a 57 year old tree trimmer..and yes I have a mulberry tree, but Rhubarb I have to get frozen, it don't grow in Florida..LOL..home depot got me on that, had one for sale,,I thought cool, bought it got it home, looked it up, YUP, don't grow here..it would have been good with my 14 fruit trees.

I made one small change, I cut the sugar by 1/4 c. and put that much clover honey in it's place. Then I made the crust and took a muffin pan and put cupcake cups in each. I put down a bottom crust forming a cup and filled them with the mixture and topped with thin strips of dough in a cris-cross pattern like a regular pie. I adjusted the cooking time too by cutting back 8-10 minutes since each pie was so small. They came out WONDERFULLY!! 

I knew I like snacking on mulberries whenever I come across a tree but I never expected them to make such a FABULOUS pie. :}

My family really liked it, which was surprising because they do not enjoy rhubarb.
