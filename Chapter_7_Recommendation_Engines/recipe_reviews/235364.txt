I had to spend over $5 for the bottle of hard cider, and ended up with flavourless meat.  It was tender enough, but lacked any kind of punch.  I guess I'm used to a salty flavour instead of sweet for pork.  Wouldn't make this again, sorry .

I looked forward to this as an alternative to traditional BBQ pulled pork. I followed the recipe exactly as written, as I always do the first time to get a "baseline." I took it out of the oven and the flavors of the spice rub were good, but nothing to get excited about.
I'm very sorry to give this the lowest rating, but it just wasn't worth the cost, time and effort.
