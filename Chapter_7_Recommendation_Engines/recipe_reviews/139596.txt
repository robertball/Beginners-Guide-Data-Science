As the previous reviewer stated...bad idea in the coffee maker, so I tried my tea maker instead, not all ingredients would fit. I had to stick the brown sugar and cinnamon stick in the tea jug and let it brew out on to it. However, it would only hold 1 quart of cider at a time, hence doing this twice to fill the jug up. Best if you do it in a pan on the stove and tying the ingredients in a cheesecloth pouch. Having said that, the recipe was...at best okay. There was only hints of flavor over the apple cider. Not sure I'll make again.

I tried this recipe, only I tweaked it to suit my family.  Firstly, the coffee maker was a bad idea.  My drip basket backed up and overflowed everywhere, so I switched it to the crock pot; much better idea! Not to mention that the cider left a mess in my coffee maker. Once that was cleaned up, I switched to the crock and it was wonderful!  I didn't have any oranges, so I used dehydrated orange peel. Also, I omitted the clove & salt and used all powder spices as I didn't have the whole nutmeg or cinnamon stick.  I also increased all of the amounts of spice, because my family loves them.  I changed the sugar and used organic coconut sugar instead of the brown sugar. I mixed the sugar into the simmering crock and put the other spices into a cheesecloth and let them simmer in the crock.  Overall, this was a good reference recipe!  I gave it 3 stars because of the coffee maker idea.  That was a fiasco.
