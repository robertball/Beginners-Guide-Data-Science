I added the vanilla as other reviewers suggested but still thought the batter was missing something.  I added abt 1/2 tsp orange flavoring and that was it!  It was enough to "wake up" the cookie base and was a great compliment to the cranberry and chocolate.  I also added 1 c pecan pieces for crunch.  These freeze and travel well.

I've made 2 batches in a week. I added 2 tablespoon of vanilla and about 1 tsp of cinnamon. I made half the batch with about 1/4 cup of walnuts.They are not real sweet which I like.  They are best right out of the oven while they are still warm and the white chocolate is still melted.Ummmm!  My husband loves them as well as my 1 1/2 year old. I made half the batch without walnuts for them. I am a nut person so I think they are best with the walnuts added. I made these last night for family members and everyone raved over these cookies. They all wanted the ones with the walnuts. I got this recipe the first time from the back of the dried cranberry package. It was thrown away not knowing what a hit they would be, so I went online and found this. I'm saving it this time.

These cookies did need the added vanilla. I also used fresh cranberries, and found that cooking them for 12 minutes was too much--8 minutes was better.

I'm impressed! A very tasty combination of flavors. I added 3/4 c. pecans and 2 tsp. vanilla as others suggested, and they were great. The dough wasn't very sweet and I almost added more sugar, but after adding the white chocolate chips it was the perfect amount of sweetness. This one is unique, a keeper!

Oh my goodness are these GOOD!  But to be fair I did bake these according to the other raters suggestions.  I added vanilla, used fresh cranberries (as I had those on hand), was out of flour (or I would have used whole wheat) so I used self rising (all I had), and I did flatten out the cookies before I baked them.  I am also a nut lover, so next time I make these, and I will, I will throw in some chopped nuts.  Oh, I also got 3 1/2 dozen from this batch, maybe I made them smaller than they need be, but I didn't want them baking too close together....and I did cut back on the baking time...9-10 minutes.  Yummy!!  Please give these a try.

Very good! I subbed semi-sweet chips and used margarine, and added 2 tsp. of vanilla to each batch. I made bigger cookies (heaping spoonfuls) and doubled the recipe, and I think I came out with about 3 and a half dozen. Well received both at home and at a party I brought them to. Will probably make again, since I like the brown sugar in place of white.

Without a doubt, these are my FAVORITE cookies EVER!  I love that they use less butter and sugar than typical cookies yet in taste, you would have no idea.  As if that isn't enough the recipe actually yields exactly what it says it will.  A MUST try!

I really expected these cookies to be better, given the indgredients.  They tasted fine (not wonderful) but were kind of crumbly and lumpy-looking.  They taste better than they look though.  I was going to add some vanilla like other reviewers suggested but forgot.  That probably would have helped.  I don't think I will make these again.

Lightly sweet and very tasty.  I added a shot of vanilla to help round things out.  Like other reviewers say, these cookies are fairly lumpy and don't flatten out in the oven.  If you want a more traditional cookie shape, flatten them out by hand before baking.

Surprisingly, I did not love these.  They are a little dry.  I followed the recipe to the "t" and did not overcook them...  :-(

This is just the Ocean spray recipe. And that one isn't that great either - really not a lot of flavor and a bit dry.

I doubled the recipe. Added vanilla and cinnamon. Really needs the cinnamon, without it I thought the cookies were rather bland. I made one batch w/o cinnamon and my second with. A HUGE difference. Will make again with changes.

I really felt this cookie was too dry and cake like.  It also was pretty bland and they didn't spread at all.

If you want a moist version try using fresh cranberries. I prefer the tangy and tart of fresh cranberries with this.

I don't normally take the time write reviews, but this one deserved one. I followed this recipe and used a few of the suggestions left by other reviewers. Instead of butter I used shortening and added 2 tsp of vanilla.  I also flattened my balls of dough a bit (I used a mini ice cream scoop for the dough)  I think without the vanilla added they would not have been as good, but these came out delicious! I think vanilla was the key missing ingredient - perhaps why it got a few bad reviews.

Used fresh cranberries, 1/2 cup unsalted butter, 2 tsp. vanilla, and 1 tsp. orange extract.  I made half the batch with just the white chocolate chunks and the other half adding 1/2 cup bittersweet chocolate chunks.  Everyone who tasted them loved the ones with the dark chocolate in them the best.  Not very sweet...like a healthy bowl of oatmeal made into a cookie.  Would have no qualms eating these for breakfast.  Will use dried cranberries next time and instead of the orange, I'll use cinnamon and instead of white chocolate, I'll use the dark chocolate again.

I substituted in golden raisins for the dried cranberries ( used the same amount of raisins that were called for the cranberries). I can truthfully I can say these went quicker in my house than chocolate chip pan cookies.

These cookies are soo yummy. I made them for the first time around Christmas and brought them to my parents and in-laws. Everyone raved about them and asked for the recipe. They were such a hit that I made another batch for New Years when we had company over.

These are quite possibly the best cookies I've ever made.  They are delicious right out of the oven.  A little bit crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.  Like some reviewers, I added 1 T. vanilla, plus I used Crisco instead of butter.  I baked heaping tablespoonfuls of cookie dough for 9 minutes and they are perfect.  Will definitely make these again.

Made AS IS. Received a lot of compliments and are great holiday cookies. It is NOT a crispy cookie but more of a chewy one, especially when shaped into little balls. Definitely making it again. And again!

Like most people I had to alter this recipe a little bit. I added 1/2 cup slivered almonds, 1 tsp vanilla extract, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I feel that this recipe really does need the vanilla flavouring and cinnamon or they would be rather bland. Next time I may try adding orange extract and orange zest for a different flavour. They are not too sweet which I really like. The cranberries and white chocolate is a nice combination.

I baked them for 8 minutes and they came out perfectly golden brown and moist. I'll defiantly be making these again! :)

these cookies were pretty good. my kids are really enjoying them, but i think as other's have said, the addition of vanilla would improve the cookie's flavor.  i also found it to be a little too crunchy for my taste, but that's my personal opinion.  thanks!

Great flavor, but made a couple adjustments: used 1/3 cup Crisco and 1/3 cup butter. Cookies came out nice and round, not flat. Reduced cranberry amount to 1 cup instead of a whole 6oz bag. Would make these again.

Delicious! Added in 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla, and only used 1/2 c butter (and used a little less of the dry ingredients to compensate - but probably only left out about 1/5 c of that.)

PERFECT..YUMM :) just as others suggested, use at least 1 tsp vanilla. I also added 1 tsp almond and they were delicious! It gave them more flavor. I used 1 stick of butter and 1/4 cup shortening and everything turned out just great! Bake for 8 minutes for soft and chewy cookies

These cookies were fabulous. They have a rich flavor taste. I used quaker quick oats, because I didn't realize there was a difference. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Everyone in my family enjoyed them as well. They are really yummy in the morning with warm milk.

Got together with friends and made these with our  kids - great fun and a delicious finished product.  I added vanilla and orange extracts as suggested by other reviewers.  I also replaced half the flour with freshly ground whole wheat flour. We also flattened them prior to baking.

Great recipe. Didn't need to make any changes and it turned out very well. I did make the cookies a little larger and pressed down lightly before I put them in the oven. And, as always, watch your bake time. These cookies dry out very quickly if left in the oven too long.

Great cookie, definitely smash down before baking as it will spread very little on it's own. I'm tempted to try these again cutting slices from a refrigerated roll.

This Recipe was exactly what I was looking for. They came out PERFECT. I did use orange flavored driend cranberries, Splenda brown sugar blend which uses half as much volume than regular brown sugar and I used quick cooking oats because that is what I had on hand. I also added the 2t of vanilla that was reccommended by other users. I found that 11 minutes in my vintage oven was good for me. They came out very light and incredibly tasty! I will definately use this recipe again and I reccommend it to EVERYONE!!

Fantastic cookie!  A huge hit with adults as well as kids.  A refreshing break from Chocolate Chip cookies.  This one is a keeper.

Great recipe! Loved it! Here are the changes I made along with some help from other reviews, and my own imagination: 1) Add 2 Tsp. Cinnamon 2) Add 1/4 Cup Unsweetened Apple Sauce 3) Add 1 Cup Chopped Pecans 4) Add 1 Tbsp. Vanilla Extract 5) Bake for only 10 minutes - Turned out Great :)

I discovered this recipe on here about 10 years ago and have been making them around the holidays EVERY YEAR since then.  Almost every single person asks me for the recipe!  They are fantastic!!!  
The trick is to mix all the ingredients with your hands - that way everything really gets mixed in.

I used 1/2 tsp of almond extract, 3/4 c craisins, 1/2 cup choc chip, 1/2 c white choc chips and 1/2 c walnuts. What made this cookie great was the zest of 1/2 an orange!!!

This cookie recipe was a big hit with my family. I followed other reviews by adding 2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp orange extract, and 1 tsp cinnamon.  I also used whole wheat flour. They turned out delicious and just the right amount of sweetness.  I will definitely continue baking these for the holidays.

For my next batch I will add shredded coconut to the mix. Yum!

I admit I am not much of a cook, but I followed the recipe and added the vanilla.  They taste okay, but are very dry.  Is this how they should taste?  Perhaps I should have taken the advice of others and shortened the cooking time.

These were great however, they were a little too crunchy for my liking so I baked them for 8 minutes instead of the 10 - 12 minutes the recipe suggests.

I was underwhelmed by these cookies.  I followed the recipe and they tasted fine but between all the craisins and the white chocolate there was hardly enough oatmeal dough to hold everything together!  I had hoped for something with more oatmeal augmented by the craisins and white chocolate, not a recipe where the oatmeal is just the "glue" to hold the other stuff together.  I guess I'll keep searching.

I tried this recipe after seeing it on the back of the crasin bag and they were delightful, everyone raved about them.  The only ingredients that I changed was adding the vanilla and a splash of heavy whipped cream. I glad that I found it on allrecipe now I can increase the recipe without messing it up.

These are good, not too sweet and I like that. Great with a cup of coffee in the morning so we called them "breakfast cookies". Interesting note, this is the exact recipe that is on the back of the Craisins package. I agree that it needs vanilla, and I added chopped walnuts as well. Rounded teaspoons is too small for these cookies, rounded tablespoons worked much better.

Amazing blend of textures and flavors. I always substitute about 1/4 c whole wheat flour for white for a little more ctustiness on the outside (and a little more fiber). Walnuts also add to the flavor and taste dynamic. But the recipe is great as is. A big hit with my family and my classmates!

Great cookies! There was just something stopping these from being 5 star. Next time I will use fewer oats and add some vanilla. But VERY tasty and relatively low in calories for a cookie. A great holiday snack.

Wow, these cookies are sugary!  A little too many white chocolate chips for my liking, so probably will decrease the sugar and chips on the next batch.  Definitely a great rich cookie!  YUMMY!

These came out burned at 375, dry, and not too flavorful. I followed the directions exactly! I expected more because of the great reviews! NO WAY you bake these at 375 for 10 to 12 minutes! I was taking them out at 8 minutes and the bottoms were black. So disappointed!

YUM!  I followed others advice and added about 3/4 tsp Cinnamon and some Vanilla.  I used White Chocolate Chips and dropped the dough in round Tablespoons, not teaspoons.  Baked for exactly 10 minutes and they are amazing!  I imagination without the cinnamon and vanilla, they would be bland.

I absolutely love this recipe. Not too sweet, not too thick, just right.   The ONLY thing it needed was a tiny bit of extra oomph, so i added a small splash of vanilla, about 1 teaspoon. I advise: when baking, make the cookies a bit smaller, and do not flatten them out. Let them do their own thing in the oven, they'll come out in cute little ball-like shapes if you drop a one-teaspoon ball onto a cookie sheet. Bake for 10 minutes to avoid hardness. A tip: a butter spread such as SmartBalance made with olive oil worked much better for me than using butter after baking them a second time. The spread is softer and healthier. I thoroughly recommend these cookies and will DEFINITELY bake them again!

I read most of the reviews before I made this cookie. I added about 2 tsp of vanilla, 2 tsp of cinnamon, and about 2 tsp of orange zest. I also added abut 1 cup of chopped walnuts. I also found 10-12 minutes was too long so after the first dozen I reduced the time to 9 minutes and these cookies are awesome. I total favourite that I will make again. They are also very nice for the Christmas season. The only thing I would like to add is if you like a flatter cookie then press them to your liking. A definite cookie I will continue to make.

I modified a little bit more. I added the suggested 2tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon. Then I used 3/4 cup ap flour and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, the whole bag of nestle white chocolate morsels and I used 1/2 cup of craisins and 1/2 cup of raisins. These cookies are phenominal!

So yummy! I loved that it was jam-packed with cranberries and chunky white chocolate. I definitely had to cook with less time or they'd get overdone, about 8 minutes here. I couldn't help but add a tsp vanilla during the egg step. mmm

Its a good recipe but it needs more flavor from the original.  I would add the tsp of vanilla then 1.5tsp of cinnamon (or 1 tbsp) for more flavor, depending on preferecne.

as per some of the reviews, i added orange flv. 1/2tsp ... and it made the batter super yummy. Definately tastes great with the cranberries. I also used a cranberry trail mix with an assortment of nuts (minus the cashews) and they turned out FABULOUS !! my boyfriend REALLY enjoyed them! Mind you he eats anything. Definately a keeper of a recipe. ONLY downside is that the batter gets quite heavy with the oats and flower added, makes hard to stir in the chocolate and berries/nuts! :)

Ok, made a few changes (1tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, added 1/2 cup almond slivers and decreased cranberry/raisin mix to 3/4 cup) But this was absolutely delicious. I've been looking for a really good oatmeal cookie recipe. and I've definitely found it. Easy to make, delicious to eat. Slightly crunchy on the outside nice and soft on the inside. Originally made for the boyfriend to try them tomorrow. Might have to make another batch tomorrow as this batch is disappearing fast.

Excellent! I added some slivers of macadamia nuts just because I happen to have about a 1/2 cup left over from another recipe.  These were good, very good. I think they are a very good cookie for gifts or taking somewhere, just special.

These were really good, especially while warm.  My whole family loved them.  I did not change a thing.  I think next time I will add some vanilla extract for a little more flavor like others have suggested.  But, they are delicious like they are.

I added the vanilla as suggested, but I also added about 1 - 2 tsps of finely grated orange zest. According to my husband, that was made the cookie great.

These were nothing special IMO.  The only difference I made was to add vanilla and soak the cranberries in warm water first to plump them.  They were ok, but I won't be making them again.  To me they were lacking in flavor.

Excellent recipe.  This cookie definetly needs to be flattned before baking, i use the bottom of a drinking glass dipped in white sugar.  Also, after cooled, dip half into either white or milk chocolate and sprinkle with a few chopped nuts.  Next to taste, presentation is everything, this little attention to detail helps to create an awesome looking and tasting cookie.........

Excellent! These are some of the best cookies I've ever made. I used white-chocolate/chocolate swirl chips, instead of plain white-chocolate. Next time, I may try adding some finely chopped almonds for a little extra crunch.

I just started making these, after spending some time searching for a recipe to use ingredients I had on hand, and discovered that this is the recipe off the back of the bag of Ocean Spray Craisins.  I wonder about copyright?  Anyway, the six-ounce bag is not quite one and one-fourth cup.  That's why I looked at the bag:  to see if the measurement was given in cups.

This was very good.  Crispier and lessy greasy than I expected.  Good for anytime during the holiday season.  I substituted dried fruit bits for the cranberries (the mix included cranberries) and chocolate chips for the white chocolate. Next time I would like to try it with a little more oats.

This recipe is always a crowd favorite among my family- I’ve made it on countless occasions. They taste just as good hot out of the oven as they do a week later and are perfect with coffee or milk! Using a little bit of vanilla flavoring DOES seem to brighten up the recipe more!

Any cookie with white chocolate chips have always been a favorite of mine.  Husband liked. Makes a small batch which is sometimes good so you don't feel like you're in the kitchen half the day.

Solid Recipe, easy to follow. I personally make it without the white chocolate as it seems superfluous. I am going to make a batch tonight but add orange zest, we'll see how that goes.

The best cookies ever!  Chilled the dough in the fridge about 30 minutes to keep the cookies from spreading in the oven.  Definitely make them again!

I love this recipe!! Was so yummy and not to sweet! I added toasted coconut ( just cuz I love it) and they were delicious. I took about 4 dozen to a family gathering, couple hours later left with a couple cookies.

I, too, added 2tsp of pure vanilla. I like to plump my dried fruit, so I added 2T of orange juice to the craisins and microwaved it for 30 seconds before adding it to the batter.

I thought the recipe needed vanilla, so I read some reviews. I added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond and 3/4 tsp orange extract. Also used some baking cranberries I had on hand and Ghirardelli white chocolate chips. Great cookies, hubby loves them!

I added vanilla as suggested and pulled the cookies out slightly early (after 10 min of baking). I let them cool and then packed them up in airtight containers. They stayed soft for days. Without vanilla they would have been devoid of flavor.

Im sorry, but I do not recommend these cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly, and used the best quality ingredients. I quadrupled the recipe to give as gifts.   I tried this recipe for the first time, as I have made these cookies for years, but couldnt find my old recipe. They were very dry with no taste. My husband told me not to serve them, so I just use them to dip in my coffee.

I added vanilla and orange extract,  2tsp each, zest from one orange.  I also refrigerated the dough for 45 minutes to rest on my second batch. That made a world of difference.

These cookies taste great! With just the right amount of everything! The only recommendation I have would be to press down the cookies a bit before baking, since they down melt down in the oven very much. If you like rounder, scone-type cookies, you don’t have to do this but for the classic cookie shape I would press them down.

I've been making these cookies oh, for 35 years.  We used to call these "Princess Cookies".  But no matter what you call them, they are just to die for.  The combination of colors and flavors, especially the white chocolate, just kiss your palate.  I hope these get a revival from modern-day bakers.  These are one of the 6 varieties of cookies I make for my Christmas Cookie Tin I give out to friends and neighbors.  Thank  you for sharing.

These are a cake like cookie.  I added the vanilla and cinnamon as others had suggested.  Without those the cookie would be very bland.  I also added a royal icing drizzle for a little extra sweetness.  I will make these again with my modifications.

The texture of the cookie was perfect! I love that it was cripsy, yet not too crunchy.  That in itself should be five stars! I gave it four stars for the following reasons, I found the dough missing something, so the next batch I added vanilla and cinnamon, which improved the taste. Also, the white chocolate chips melted...boo. Therefore after some research, I found that chilling the cookie dough and making the chocolate chunks a bit bigger was the trick. Indeed it was and it made a huge  difference. I had chocolate chips!

Great recipe. Following the lead of others, I added 2 tsp of vanilla; 1 tsp cinnamon and 3/4 cup toasted pecans. Using an oven thermometer, cooked at 375’ for 9 mins. They were a hit with all.

This was a good basic cookie to build on. I added 2 tsp. vanilla,1 tsp baking powder,  1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, (cinnamon,  cloves, nutmeg, ginger),  1/2 cup unsalted sunflower seeds,  equal parts golden raisins, chopped dates and  dried cranberries instead of just cranberries. Only needed about 1/2 cup chocolate. I filled  paper lined muffin pan about 1/2  full to avoid running into each other. This made 2 dozen cookies. Baked for about 15 minutes.

It's pretty good! I added vanilla and it was definitely needed. I also pressed them down with a fork after seeing how they stay like a ball. I cooked them for exactly 10 min and it was too much. Either reduce the temp or cook for maybe 8-9min max!

Might make again with added nuts and chopped up dried cranberry instead of whole pieces, they were sort of big in my opinion.

These are great! I definitely want to try the suggestion of orange extract by Idreyer. The only large difference I made from the recipe was to add vanilla extract as I feel most cookies are naked without it. I also used cherry-juiced infused dried cranberries by ocean spray and chips instead of a bar of chocolate as my store didn't have any, and I used quick oats as it's what I had on hand. I rolled into balls and recommend to flatten them a bit if you do the same for a more spread out cookie, or do drop dough. A ball will come out too small and round.

so I did a test batch without vanilla and then added a dash of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon to compare the two batches. the first batch wasnt terrible but definitely not as good as with vanilla and cinnamon. i also added chopped pecans. delicious.

My husband and I really enjoyed these cookies.  I liked that they were made with butter and brown sugar.  I also added 2/3 cup of chopped walnuts.  They needed flattening after I used an ice cream scoop to put them on the cookie sheet.  Next time I will try using dried cherries and almond extract instead of cranberries.

I have made these several times but added my own touches. I soaked the dried cranberries in Orange juice for about an hour before adding them, and also added about 1/2 a cup of shreded sweetened coconut. a couple times I added a little glaze made from the Orange juice I drained from the cranberries and some powdered sugar. Some people call them "crack cookies" because they are so addictive.

I added 1 tsp of salt. Definitely an improvement. I also pushed them down with a fork because they are more of a clumping cookie instead of a spreading/rising cookie. This made the cranberries chewier as more was exposed and baked rather then inside.

I made these this morning to take to my neighbors as a thank you for taking care of my doggies.. I took other reviewers advice by adding a tsp of ground cinnamon and 2tsps vanilla extract. My first tray in the oven burned after 10 minutes. My second tray came out perfect at about 7 minutes, so watch them carefully!

I read the more useful reviews and adjusted the recipe by using two sticks of butter, the salt, the two teaspoons of vanilla, a few more white chocolate chips,half a cup of chopped walnuts and about another quarter cup of dried cranberries.  I baked the cookies for nine minutes and they came out splendidly!  the extra butter made the cookies moist and luscious, you cannot have too many cranberries in my opinion, and walnuts are always appropriate.  Very handy recipe, and thanks to all the cooks who went before us and made suggestions to improve the basic recipe!  Would have given it five stars, but I'm stingy with superlatives.  I reserve five stars for the chocolate chip bacon and sea salt cookies that make grown men weep and strong women gnash their teeth.

I loved them...I didn't change anything this time around but next time will try it with the whole cup of butter.  I'm not a big fan of cake type cookies prefer mine to be more crispy.  Flavor was good my husband loved them and he's hard to please.

Will be using this recipe for a cookie exchange again this year. Renamed it 'Cranberries in the Snow' and pack the flour mixture at top with more colorful ingredients at the bottom. Put crinkled up wax paper on top of ingredients to prevent shifting. I use walnuts or whatever nut is the least expensive.I also use a wax paper funnel to add ingredients to the jar. It is a WINNER for sure!

These are pretty terrific on there own however I switched it up a bit.  Instead of flour I used cake flour, the same amount as flour, it makes the cookies more chewy and I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.  I like that they don't expand out on the cookie sheet when you bake them so you can make them bigger if you want although it may take a minute or two longer! My family and friends love them and I am about to deliver some to our local police station, i'm almost certain they will like these better then donuts!

Great recipe!  I tend to leave out the chips and add vanilla and a little cinnamon.  As a nut lover, I've also added almonds.  I do say that the recipe was terrific as is as well.  They don't spread, so if you want a flatter cookie, flatten it slightly before you bake it.

I thought this was very good, and my toddler loves them. It was more "cakey" than I expected. I did make changes. I used 2 c. oatmeal and 1 c. flour. I added 2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.

These cookies are so very good.  I did add a handful of mini cinnamon chips (they were in my cupboard) just because I like the taste of cinnamon with oatmeal. But the original recipe would have been perfect as is.  I will make these again and again.

Well of course this is a lumpy bumpy cookie. Why, it's chock full of cranberries and chocolate chunks. I wasn't at all offended that the cookie doesn't flatten. I also added the flavorings (vanilla and orange). I was happy to find this recipe because I had some ingredients that I wanted to use up but this is a tasty cookie and I would make it again.

I made the following changes: 

1 cup whole wheat and 1/2 cup all purpose flour,
2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, semi-sweet chocolate chips, and dried cranberries with orange essence.

I also made the cookies much smaller. My batter yielded 45 cookies. I reduced the cooking time to 8 minutes, and then let the cookies sit for 3 minutes before moving them to the cooling rack. The result was a yummy, chewy oatmeal cookie. 

I made some without the cranberries for my husband; they were good, but definitely not as good. Next time I might use all whole wheat flour.

My rating of 5 stars is based on the alterations I made.

This recipe provides for less than an acceptable outcome as shown.  Like many others, I've had to tweak this recipe to make it something good.  More butter, vanilla extract made it moist.  The original - exactly - as shown recipe provided crumbly, dry cookies.

I think these are awesome. I do add 2 tsp of vanilla but otherwise, they are a great mix of tart and sweet. People may not like that they aren't as chewy or moist or sweet as other cookies, but I think that's why I like them. So it's just personal preference.

I'm not a white chocolate fan, but my husband loves oatmeal cookies.  Delicious!!!  The cranberries and white choc. compliment each other nicely.  Definitely will be placed on my holiday cookie list.

Oh my goodness they are great. I accidentally screwed up the butter proportion, so I ended up using 1 cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar, 2 eggs, and just a tad bit more of the oats, flour and baking soda. I also added about 2 tsp vanilla and 2 tbsp white sugar. Now I like my cookies sweet, and these were. Just how I like 'em!

Very good cookies...not too sweet, but nice combination of flavors. I added the 2 tsp. of vanilla, as others suggested, and will continue to make it that way in the future. These cookies freeze very well and when you want a treat, take a few out of the freezer, cover with a paper towel, and microwave for 25 sec and then for another 25 sec if they feel like they need it....Yummy.

These cookies are delicious! I did alter the recipe which is why I gave it a four instead of a five star rating. I added fresh cranberries instead of dried, walnuts, and a teaspoon or two of vanilla. I recommend spending the extra money to use Green and Blacks Organic White Chocolate, it is one of the best white chocolates available, but beware it is highly addictive!

Good cookie that makes me feel like I am eating healthy....cranberries, oatmeal (:  Taste is very good.  I pressed down slightly when I put them on the cookie sheet because they are thicker cookies.  I also used white chocolate chips.

This recipe was great! I love that they are simply sweet without being too much. And I took the tips from a few others and added vanilla and a splash of orange juice. It's a nice kick. Definitely saving this recipe for later. :)

These were good.  We did add some extra brown sugar and vanilla extract.  Due to the chips and cranberries, these cookies are better when they are larger.

I made these cookies for a holiday party.  The only changes I made was adding vanilla after adding the eggs and adding walnuts at the end. I also doubled the recipe so I could have more cookies!  They came out delicious.  They are light, crumbly and a great combination of flavors.  I will definitely make this again and again!

This recipe can be found word for word on the back of the Crasins package.  Its a pretty good recipe, just not an original one.  I'd suggest making them a little sweeter, they had a touch of a dry/salty taste to me.

These were quite good but seemed to be missing something in terms of flavor.  I would definitely recommend adding in some vanilla (I used 1-1/2 tsp)...and next time I will try adding some orange zest.  Otherwise the texture of these cookies was great.  Just be sure not to over-bake...mine were done after only 9 minutes.

These cookies are delicious! Just as some other users did, I added about a teaspoon of vanilla to the creamed butter and sugar, and also the zest of one orange. I used a cookie scoop to portion the dough (I think it was a one-ounce scoop). Make sure to flatten the cookies with the palm of your hand before they go into the oven because they do not flatten out much while baking.

I made these for a school bake sale and they flew off the table. I love that it's not really sweet, and that they're always moist. I substituted the white chocolate for milk chocolate and they taste just as good, if not better. They're especially good when slightly warm, 10 seconds in the microwave or 10 minutes out of the oven.
Only complaint would be that they're too small. I think 20, 25 cookies from one batch makes a better size cookie.

I added a banana, some vanilla, and substituted half of the cranberries for dried blueberries. It ended up tasting really good. I also used milk chocolate instead of white.

I found the cookies to be of a less sweet and less buttery texture than I expected and dryer than I normally find cookies.  I think the addition of vanilla mentioned in the other reviews would help.  They tasted ok but just plainer than I had been expecting.  They weren't a chewy sweet buttery cookie.
