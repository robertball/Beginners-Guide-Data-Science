6-Star Bagels, 4-Star Recipe ** Sharing Some Tips -- Read for First Time Users **  It made amazing bagels, the only problem was they weren't amazingly presentable. Here's some little tips to fill in the gaps that the recipe leaves.  - in a small bowl, microwave milk for 1:40mins, then add to yeast in your larger, mixing bowl. - dissolve the butter in the milk while its still warm, just my stirring it around. - lightly whip up the yolk (just enough to break it, and it's sac) before adding to bowl. - knead it really well ('over-knead' if you have to). - when leaving the dough to sit, cover the bowl (tin-foil or plastic wrap) and put it in your still-warm microwave to sit. - you could shape it into 12 balls, but I suspect you'd end up with mini-donut-sized bagels. 9 worked okay for me, but they were still very small. SO, unless your dough rose really, really well, I'd make about 6: this would make a usual-sized bagel. - when making the holes, poke your finger through each, but then repeat and stratch the holes to about 1.5in. When baking, the holes will close in anyway, so a larger hole now ensures you'll still have one when baked. - I didn't flatten them once they were shaped, I don't know how this affects them. - I boiled about three at a time, but remember to give them a poke as they will sometimes stick to the bottom of the pan. - line sheets with tin-foil, it bakes more evenly. - for soft bagels: bake about 15-18min, crusty ones about 20+min.  Good luck. Yummm.. :)

Easy, chewy, and taste great!  Did not make any changes to the recipe, only in the directions.  (A little trick) I let the bread rise in my microwave after I boiled some water in it for 2 min. for some heat, then left the bread in the microwave for a warm place.  Boil the bagels with 1 Tbsp. of molasses in the water for 1 min. on each side.  Make sure you grease your cookie sheet or they will stick to the pan.  I also brushed my plain bagels with the egg whites left over from the egg yolk with alittle milk.  First timer in making bagels and turned out great, my boyfriend and I both loved it.

I ended up making a few variations and creating an apple cinnamon bagel. I followed the directions for ingredients, only I added 1 cup of shredded apples and and extra 1/2 cup of flour. I did not punch a hole all the way through the bagels, but made a "well" in the center. After boiling the bagels I added a dollop of a cinnamon topping to the center well. The ingredients for the topping are as follows: 3 Tbl.softened butter, 1/2 cup packed brown sugar, 2 tsp. corn starch and 2-3 tsp. cinnamon. I also had a yield of 8 bagels that were a bit bigger than the 12 the recipe called for. They came out very tasty. No need for cream cheese with this one!

I have made these several times and they always turn out great.  I would suggest making the holes bigger and flatten them more.  I also made a batch using 1 1/4 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup of oats, and honey.  Also made a batch adding cinnamon and raisins.  These always turn out great.

This was my first batch of bagels. When I dropped them into the boiling water, they immediately floated up, so I didn't know how long should they stay in the water. I let them sit in the water until they increased by about 50%, then flipped them and then placed them on the greased backing sheet.
We had them for breakfast and they tasted like crispy homemade bread toast (which is good) but not like bagels. Maybe if I add stuff, like flavorings like onion/garlic powder or cinnamon & raison, it would taste more like a bagel? I will make again.

I wanted to use my tried and true bagel recipe from this site (bread machine bagels), but I lost my printed copy. I got on here to find it and decided to try a different bagel recipe. So many to choose from, alot of bagel recipes on this site! Anyway, I halved the recipe (except for the egg yolk) and only got 4 bagels out of this recipe. I cheated a little and used my bread machine to mix the dough. I do like the Bread Machine Bagels a bit better, thanks for letting me try different a recipe! The dough had a really nice consistency to work with. Not too sure about using an egg yolk in bagels...the texture was not as dense as I would have liked. My son loved them, however, but I think I will stick with the BMB on this site!

Easy to make and a big hit with EVERYONE who has tried them.  Even people who claim they don't like bagels rave about them.  I add a little more yeast so they are larger and we use them for hamburger buns.

This was my first attempt at making bagels and they turned out really well!  I did not need to bake them for the full 20 minutes, so I'm glad I kept an eye on them during the baking process.  Very easy.  :)  Thanks!

Really easy to make. I made a whole wheat version with 3 cups of whole wheat flour, and 3/4 cup up AP flour. They turned out great. I probably needed to make the hole in the center bigger, because they closed while cooking. Also used Almond Milk instead of regular milk.

These were awesome!  However, next time I will not flatten.  They did not rise again after flattening them.  Also I would definitely double or triple the recipe and make fewer bagels per batch.  Also, I made everything bagels by combining poppy seeds, sesame seeds, dried minced onion, dried minced garlic and pretzel salt, and dipped them in this before baking. (yuuuuum!)

5 Star Bagels, 4 Star Directions.  My bagels never sank to the bottom of the pan when boiled.  I used others' advice and let them cook for a couple of minutes on each side and then took them out.  DO NOT FLATTEN them, in my opinion, as they didn't recover and I had a couple of very flat bagels. My dough rose beautifully and I had a dozen good sized bagels.  I also think the recipe could have used a bit more salt in the dough.  Otherwise, GREAT BAGELS!

My 1st attempt at making bagels was a HUGE success.  Wonderful recipe to follow.  I did make some modification because my favorite bagel is Jalapeno and Cheese.

Recipe called for 1 1/4 cup of milk.  I did 1 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of jalapeno juice.

While I was kneading (BTW- I used my kitchen aid mixer) I incorporated 1/4 cup of diced pickled jalapenos to the dough.

I followed the recipe as instructed so after boiling; I placed bagels on a my baking sheet and topped with cheese and a few more diced jalapenos.  Baked for 20 mins.  These bagels were beautiful and outstanding flavor.

Love these!

Delicious, easy recipe, and impressive finished product. I made salt bagels, sesame bagels, and herb + salt bagels by lightly sprinkling each one after the boil. Hubby's from Brooklyn and raved over them!

These are absolutely wonderful - and my 10-yr-old and 4-yr-old both agree! I eat bagels most mornings for my on-the-go breakfast; I'm tired of the store-bought, so I tried making my own. Million times easier than I'd feared.

I highly recommend following the tips in the reviews by "etirniti" and "Mrs. Tran." (Click View All Reviews and sort reviews by Most Helpful).

My dough made 6 normal-sized bagels. I'll be making this again and again!

This is an excellent recipe. I have made a similar version for years. You can also adapt this to wrap around hot dogs (bagel dogs) and small sausages (bagel puppies). I have also used spaghetti sauce for liquid and chopped pepperoni , topped with cheese before baking for pizza bagels, and salsa for liquid, chopped jalapenos, topped with cheese for mex-bagels. The possibilities are only limited by your imagination!

These bagels are the best! Our first time baking bagels ~ very easy!  My husband & I made them together because we forgot bagels at the grocery store.  Let me tell you ~ NO more grocery store bagels.  The only thing with this recipe is we only got 8 nice sized bagels instead of 12, but that's okay.  Loved them!

These bagels were amazing! Last time, we tried one of the many recipes that uses water instead of milk. The milk must be the magic ingredient, because these were so soft and tasted wonderful.  Rather then taking them out when they rose to the top of the boiling pot (which was almost immediately), we let them boil for 2.5 min on each side, which seems to have worked well.  The longer you let them boil, the thicker the outside "shell/skin" will be.

Not only is this the first batch of bagels I've made, this is the first thing I've EVER made with yeast, and these were a success! One thing I will change for next time: I won't flatten them: They were much thinner than I wanted them to be. Having the dough rise in the microwave worked well. And, when you boil them, watch them. Take them out when they are twice as thick as they were when you put them in. I also added raisons and cinnamon- besides being flat, they are great!

These bagels came out so good! I did use King Arthur bread flour vs. the all-purpose (which I'm trying next). I also only made 8 bagels after reading the reviews and they came out a nice size. After boiling, I did dip them in sesame seeds which worked out nicely and I will continue to experiment with toppings. I used my kitchen aid mixer vs. the kneading so this was super easy and like I said, so good!! Have fun!

Wow, so delicious...I don't even know if delicious is the right word to use...this bagel recipe is a winner!!!
Thanks you, SLYFOXYLADY, for suggesting the molasses. I added 1 TBS to my boiling water but other than that I made no other substitution.
These bagels were a HUGE hit this morning for breakfast. Everyone huddle around the toaster impatiently waiting for their turn:)The outside had just the right touch of chewiness while the inside was a beautifully soft dough. Crisped so nicely when toasted!!!!

This is a great recipe.  I brushed the tops with egg white before baking for a crisp golden crust, and they turned out very well.

These turned out fantastic!  I used 1c of whole wheat flour and 2c of all purpose.  I forgot to add the egg yolk (and realized it too late) so I did not need the other 3/4c of flour.   In the water for boiling (large dutch oven) I added 1tsp salt, 1tbsp honey, 1tsp baking soda.  The salt and honey add flavour and the baking soda and honey both help with browning once they go in the oven.  Because I used a big pot of water I was able to boil 3 at a time, I put them in for a minute flipped them then another minute.  Before they went in the oven I sprinkled some with dehydrated onion and some with poppy seeds.  Yummy!

These definitely beat out anything you find in a grocery store. They are just downright good. I added 3/4 c  cheddar cheese and 1/4 c jalapenos to dough right before boiling. Let me just say "Wow!" Flaky on outside, chewing on inside. This will be a Sunday morning favorite. I can hardly wait to try other creations (cinnamon, honey, oats, garlic....)

These are awesome!  Very easy to make, and oh so delicious!  I've been making big batches of different varieties and freezing them individually in foil.  Then, when I don't have time to cook breakfast I just stick the bagel in the foil in my toaster oven,  fry up an egg, throw a little cheese on it, and it makes a super delicious, quick and easy breakfast!

Great base recipe! I turned the oven down to 375 and cooked for about 18 min. I chopped up some apples and tossed them into the dough with some cinnamon and raw sugar. Delicious and easy

My bf and I just made these and we are so impressed! Neither of us has done any yeast baking before so we were a little hesitant, but this recipe was awesome! The instructions were easy to follow; we added molasses to the boiling water as per other reviewers. It's also very versatile: I made onion cheddar bagels and his were topped with Hawaiian Red salt and oat bran. Two thumbs up!

This didn't work out very well for me. Although I followed all the directions, the dough didn't rise well enough. After a few hours and a bit of rising I went ahead and boiled them.  Don't flatten these! Keep them fairly round.  Also, be sure to bake them a bit longer than it says to, unless your bagels are quite small. Mine baked for about 30 minutes but could have used more time.

Attractive, yummy bagels on first attempt!  I listened to reviews and made a smaller number of larger bagels. Also, after the dough rose I punched it down, divided it, smashed out the air bubbles and shaped it to form "breadsticks," then  overlapped and pressed the ends together to form the bagel shape.  Have also tried honey & wheat which turned out well.  Cutting the butter down to 1 Tbsp did not alter results.

these were yummy, although mine were kind of ugly. this was my first time making bagels, so maybe i need a little more practice with shaping them. i add some golden raisins, cinnamon, nutmeg, and choc chips and used whole wheat flour. i accidentally used too much butter, so i ended up using about 4 1/4 c flour and baking about 30 mins, but they still turned out soft and tasty. this seems like a great base recipe to add your own touches to, thanks for sharing!

very easy to make.  I made these with my 2-1/2 year old son.  Instead of making them into balls we punched down the dough and used cookie cutters to make fun shaped bagels.  We made trains, flowers, and shooting stars.  I used the leftover pieces of dough to make twists.

Just made these for the third time in a week - so yummy!  My first batch didn't turn out well, but I'm glad I gave it another chance.                        

I made these exactly as written with one small addition - I brushed the egg white over the tops just before they went into the oven... this gives them a nice golden top that looks beautiful.
I made 12 bagels, as written, and they were about the size of a donut (4" diameter, 1.5" thick)... perfect size for my kids and I.               
For boiling, when I put them in the pan of water they floated on the top right away.  I boiled them for one minute on each side.  My first batch I boiled for 3 minutes on each side, and I think they becoming water-logged and didn't rise in the oven after that... they were quite flat and not pretty.                              
Tip: when letting the dough rise for an hour, I put the covered bowl in a few inches of water in my kitchen sink... stays nice and warm, and rises great.                            
Tip: after boiling, I made sure they went into the oven with the side up that was up when they were rising.  This is the smoothest side, and will look the nicest in the end.

I like how versatile this recipe is. In addition to the basic recipe, I've made honey whole wheat, cinnamon raisin, cranberry walnut and asiago cheese, and they all turned out great. I also form them into 6 or 8 bagels because I like them bigger and give them an egg wash before baking. Thanks for the great recipe!

There’s nothing like fresh bagels.  I used bread flour because bagels are usually made with high gluten flour which gives them that great chew.  These came out great.  I drained them on a paper towel before putting them on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  I also let them rise slightly before baking.  I just wish I had made the holes in the center larger when shaping them.  However, they were still wonderful.

Delicious bagels! The only issue I had was getting the dough to rise some more and kneading the dough. Other than that, the taste was fantastic and other reviews were incredibly helpful! I will make these again!

Easy, time-consuming recipe with decent results.  Store-bought bagels taste a bit better, and they don't require so much time. When I feel like making bagels again, I will be looking elsewhere for another recipe, but I'll keep this one bookmarked just in case.

These were a yummy baked good, but mine did not turn out very bagel-y.  I followed the recipe (doubled), but my bagels floated right away instead of sinking.  In the end, they were not as dense and chewy as I would have liked.  They were also too buttery and sweet.

Yummy! Easy! Seriously easy!  So so good!!  As a relocated NY'er to Texas, our family has missed bages. Not anymore :)  So good, almost as good as home but WAY better than chain named after a scientist.

These tasted really good.  My family enjoyed using them for sandwiches.  Mine were pretty flat though and like others have said, floated immediately.  I would make them again, easy enough, but I would try other recipes.

Awesome recipe. The second time I made them, I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour to make it a little bit denser. I also doubled it as my room mates can vacuum these like nobody's business.

The texture of these bagels were more like english muffins.  They tasted very good, but not what I expected.  I didn't get 12 bagels out of the dough either.

I just can't get the boiling part down.  They come out a little gummy.  Maybe, I will try again.  I just used an egg wash and skipped the boiling part for now.  They didn't come out like a bagel, more like a mix between bagel and english muffin.  Still good, but that step is crucial for bagels.

Yummy recipe. I got compliments all around. I also made some big pretzels from the dough as well and they came out great. Make them plain or toss a little cheese or an "everything" mix on the top before baking. Delish. A couple things though; mine came out a bit flat, so I suggest just skipping the "flatten" step. They also failed to sink in the water, so I let them float for a couple minutes, flipped them, and repeated.

I just made these tonight. They turned out fantastic! I followed what some other reviewers said and only made 8 bagels, but I think I should have made the 12 that the recipe calls for. They are all huge!

I have to laugh! I have been looking all over Allrecipes so I can say THANK YOU for this amazing recipe and I couldn't find the page for the life of me because the picture changed!! Anyway, I use this recipe all the time. I absolutely love it! I break off a dough ball and flatten it out and place brown sugar/cinnamon mix inside & roll it up and pinch the ends together and the taste is just delicious! My whole family & friends love these bagels. Thanks again!

I make the dough in the bread maker on the dough setting.  When it comes out, I form 8 bagels and let them rest for ten minutes.  Then I boil them for 1 minute on each side and put them on a greased cookie sheet.  I bake them for 18 minutes and they come out perfect every time!

I followed the recipe exactly except adding 3/4 cup oats and 1/4 cup honey to make them "honey oat" bagels.  These were moist and yummy.  This is a wonderful recipe, thanks!

Great recipe, but I made the following changes: I scaled the servings up to 18, and formed 12 125g beagles from the batch. I also increased the salt by an additional 1/2 otherwise they come out a little bland. You will want to stretch out the bagels during forming to almost look like giant onion rings, or they holes will close when cooking.

Pretty good recipe and very easy! My first time making bagels! I used the bread machine and just dumped everything in there. Came out nice and fluffy! Dusted half of them with salt and half with garlic powder before baking. Will make again.

This is a great base for making bagels! I always add stuff to make it my own. Who knew making great bagels were so easy. My eldest son said he didn't like them after taking a few bites then he finished that one and then ate two more...Gone in less than 24 hrs. Will make again!

More like a boiled croissant than a bagel, the flavor and texture were all wrong! Too buttery and not chewy enough.

It wasn't bad, but it wasn't a bagel.

These were pretty good for the goof I made. I didn't proof the yeast beforehand and they didn't rise. Now a plus, I added sunflower seeds and minced garlic to the dough. Then before putting in the oven topped them with caraway seeds, sesame seeds and poppy seeds with a sprinkle of sea salt and fresh ground pepper. Very yummy.

these did not turn out to my liking. maybe i should have let them rise for longer then called for both times and not of flattened them. they came out VERY flat and they taste like an english muffin. they didn't go to the bottom of the water either.. will probably not make again. pretty discouraging.

This recipe was easy and the bagels turned out yummy.  I made mini bagels because my kids like them and I ended up with 18 of them.  If I was making full size bagels I think I would only make 8.  I don't know if it was just because they were smaller but I shouldn't have flattened them either.

these were great! I even messed up the recipe by adding the whole egg instead of just the yolk and they still turned out fine. definitly will try again, and I won't make the same mistake twice! (They're good with chocolate chips, and apple cinnoman is also delicious!)

So mine didn't come out exactly perfect but I have faith in this recipe! My 5yo loved them and ate almost all of them. lol. I think I might add more yeast into the mix to make them fluffier...

My husband says these are the best bagels he has ever had.  I couldn't believe how easy they are to make.  It is almost fool-proof.

The second time I made them, I added some dried basil and snipped sundried tomatoes.  Savory and wonderful. They made fantastic sandwiches!

We have been living overseas for almost two years.  I cannot buy bagels here in Kenya and have missed them.  This recipe was fun and easy.  It makes me feel a bit closer to home!  Thanks so much for posting this one.  Can't wait to try some variations!

NOT 50 MINUTES!  read that you must wait 1 hour and add that to the 50 minute total time Rebecca lists for the accurate total time. Recipe is still going, but I bet it'll be great.  Hey the error gave me time to register on your great website and give this recipe a low rating so others wouldn't be tricked like me.

Wow! These are great!  I just tried the recipe today, and followed nearly exactly as written.  

The dough took a lot longer to rise than I excepted so I had to leave it for a few hours. 

The end product: Delicious.

Definitely looking forward to trying variations!

this recipe was really confusing.
when i went to boil the bagels, they didn't sink to the bottom to begin with.

plus the prep time was about 5 times longer than stated. =/

the bagels are in the oven right now, though. so we'll see how the product is.

These came out fantastic! I put all of the ingredients into my bread maker and used the dough setting.  Then followed the directions from punching the dough down and dividing it.  I'm so happy with the way they came out!

These did not turn out at all well - tried the microwave for helping them to rise but it didn't work too well.  The bagels as produced had no taste.

I'm making my second batch today. Making onion bagels with a bit of dried chopped onion as well as onion powder. Yesterday I made them as bagel dogs.
I needed a bit more dough for proper bagel dogs and the family wanted more.

This is a great recipe and a great base to add other flavors to. I made cinnamon raisen with a crunchy topping similar to panera's.

So fun and yummy. Pay attention to the shaping. What you boil is pretty much what you will end up with. I would make mine fuller. The kids ate a dozen in days and fresh out of the oven they were the best.

Tasted good, had nice texture, everything was going great, don't really understand why we were supposed to "Flatten" them, as they didnt end up with that really nice full look to them after they were flattened, can anyone explain why thats called for? LOL

These were really good if you do them right. I was unsure how long to boil because they floated up instantly. I also needed to add more yeast and increase bake time. I sprinkled a cinnamon sugar mixture over the top and they came out pretty good but not as thick as i'd like. I'll keep searching for an easier recipe, if there is such a thing :)

I have used another recipe from this site, for bread machine bagels (which I love), but my bread machine bit the dust so I decided to try making some from scratch and found this recipe.  The first batch was really small, but I think that I didn't let them rise enough. The second batch was excellent! Wouldn't change a thing, except the rising time (a good 2 hours- but that may be because it's so cold out right now!). My husband even asked me to make them for his office meeting this week!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

The cooking time, I've found, was off for me, I didn't need to cook them the whole time.  But I have tried several recipes and this is by FAR my favorite!  I think the milk makes a fantastic addition. :)

I just made these bagels today and it was so fun! They turned out great but could use just a little more flavor. I dissolved the yeast in milk as directed and then added everything, including flour to my bread machine and had it do the kneading and rising for me. Then I completed the rest of the instructions as directed! I will defininitely make these again! My husband was impressed:)

I made them a week ago and my family love them, here in Mexico there pretty expensive if you buy them at the store, turn out to be an economical way to enjoy bagels, I did let it raise for extra 30 minutes after baking I had store them in the frezeer until use the toaster to have a nice breakfast, today I will make more per my daugther request but I will use 1 cup whole wheat flour and boil them with brown sugar instead of white sugar.

These came out nice, soft, and fluffy that my boyfriend already ate 6 of them ...and this batch was suppose to last us for the whole week :(  Truly, this is a fantastic recipe and I'm going to be using it again and again. Going to have to make a new double-batch tomorrow anyway so that we can have bagels throughout the week.

Really easy recipe to follow and the results were great.  Thankfully the bagel size is smaller than the bakery version so it's kinder on the waistline too...obviously depending on the topping you choose!

I make this recipe all the time! I usually double it and get about 16 bagels. The only thing I add is after boiling and before putting the toppings on and baking, I brush the tops with an egg wash. Yum yum!

I used this recipe to make bagels for the first time ever and I am very happy with how they turned out!  I only made a small change and that was I used gluten free flour instead of regular all-purpose flour.  I had to use less flour because of this change and had to bake them slightly longer (about 30 mins).  I love bagels and this is definitely one of my new favorite recipes!

This was the first bagel recipe I have tried. They turned out wonderfully! I need not look any further for another one. The only complaint is that I greased my pan and they still stuck. I will definitely make this recipe over and over again!!!!
