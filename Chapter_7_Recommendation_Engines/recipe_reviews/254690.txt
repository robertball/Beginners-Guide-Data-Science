I really like hummus but have to admit being lazy and just buying it even though people have told me how easy it is to make. This was simple to make, and I followed the recipe exactly. That said, we found it to be quite bland, and the texture to be a little dry. Personally, I like my hummus to have a creamier texture. After tasting and rating it, I did add 1/8 tsp chili powder and a roasted red pepper which we really liked. I would say this is a good base for making hummus but needs additions to make it flavourful.

Awesome, cheap ingredients, and so easy! Delicious hot! We add some cayenne or chipotle powder too and offer tortilla chips as well as veggies for dipping. Take Beano with this recipe. We've made it twice since finding it in the All Recipes Magazine.

This was delicious.  It was so quick to prepare I canâ€™t see myself ever getting store-bought again.  I added a little extra salt, and  cayenne. Clearly there would be any number of slight variations to suit individual taste, but this recipe produces a fantastic base.
