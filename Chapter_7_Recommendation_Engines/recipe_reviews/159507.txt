TWO SECRETS:  To make mayonnaise come out with the right consistency, (and thus creamy taste), you MUST start with a very, very dry blender, and you must pour the oil in excruciatingly slowly.  Do these two things, and you will never, ever buy store-bought mayonnaise again!

"Miracle Whip", add 1 to 2 Tbsp. sugar.  (I don't do this, as I make my own mayonnaise for health reasons, as follows...)

HEART HEALTHY VERSION: use extra-virgin olive oil (organic if you can find it), and organic, free-range eggs.

PattyJoy, thank you so much for your tips on making this mayo!  I ended up making two batches cause it tasted so good!  I used Canola oil, less oily taste to it, and added 1 TBS sugar.  I ended up only using 1 1/4 c oil and it was getting so thick I had to stop.  The first time I was pouring the oil in by hand...very, VERY slowly, talk about a tired arm!  The second time I got smart and poked a hole through a paper cup with a toothpick and let the oil slowly drizzel out of that (I took out the little thingy on top of the blender lid and set the cup up there :)  Very good will make again!

More Tips: 1. You *must* have all ingredients at room temperature; 2. Use an immersion (stick-type) blender, if you have one. I have used my trusty Bamix since 1986 with outstanding results on this and many other recipes; 3. Be sure that the egg is the first ingredient added, followed by the vinegar (I use 1/2 red cider vinegar & 1/2 lemon juice), seasoning (I use 1/4 tsp to 1 C canola oil and the same amount of dry mustard as my mustard of choice), into a tall, narrow plastic cup (Halve the recipe for this method). Hold the blade on the bottom of the cup, turn it on to the fast speed for 20 seconds then move up & down slowly until completely mixed. Takes less than a minute, start to finish for delicious, homemade mayo! Other tips: Add finely minced chives, basil, cilantro, etc., or paprika or other spices ~ be inventive and enjoy. * * * This recipe tastes even better than Best Foods/Hellmann's mayo. We never have to buy pricey mayo. Once you try it, you may feel the same.

Makes an excellent mayo.  Couple tips:  Lemon juice for part of the vinegar really brightens it up.  Also, if you have a stick blender, put everything into a wide mouth jar, place your stick blender all the way to the bottom and turn it on.  Wait for a second until it starts to emulsify at the bottom and then slowly pull the blender towards the top.  By the time you get there, you'll have mayo right in the jar that you'll keep it in!  No more cleaning out a blender or food processor!

I used a dollop of dijon mustard instead of the dry mustard and I used olive oil. If you use the olive oil, make sure it is the very light olive oil or it will be bitter. This worked perfectly in my blender.

Homemade mayo is the best, and I have made it with several different modifications.  I use half canola, half EVOO, and have added a Dijon or whole seed type mustard with good results. Chop some dill pickles in the mayo and add a lemon herb spice and you have a great tartar sauce.  Also, I do not add oil drop by drop, I simply pour slowly out of the measuring cup which only takes a couple of minutes and have never had trouble with it emulsifying. I never purchase mayo.

I absolutely love this recipe!  I had never made my own mayonnaise before and felt like I'd discovered America when we tasted it and how fantastic it was.  Like Cheri, I poked a hole in a plastic cup and let the oil drip in slowly as I blended it.  Whipped right up with no problems.  I also use Canola oil.  Haven't bought a jar of mayonnaise since.  I want to try it with flavored vinegar for steak sandwiches, fish, etc.  I also grow my own herbs so I'm looking forward to adding some fresh parsley, basil, dill ... thanks for a great post!

This recipe was kind of a pain to make in my blender. Near the end, it got really thick and it was hard to add the oil. Taste-wise, I liked this recipe better than the Home
Made Mayonnaise, which is also on this site. It's thicker and the taste is more clear. I'll make this again, only next time I'll use the food processor. My blender is kind of a puss.

I always make my own mayonaise. I do use a tablespoon of French mustard and use lemon juice instead of vinegar. I use sunflower oil or canola oil. First I put in the eggs, the mustard, lemon juice, pepper and salt and 1 tablespoon of oil. Make sure to keep the kichen aid (how do you call the mixer with blade to be used in this recipe???)on the bottom of the tall (preferably) glass container. Keep on mixing, while you gradually pour the oil in. Never take the base of the mixer out of the mayo until the mayo is done. Keep pulling the mixer upwards while adding the oil. 
Home made is wonderful! Use if for your potato salad!

For those of you that had runny mayonnaise - DO NOT STOP ONCE YOU HAVE STARTED.  If you do, the emulsion will separate.  For those that thought it was bland - add different seasonings.  We have been making mayo in our family for over 100 years.  We use lemon juice which we think adds more flavor, the salt will balance out the sourness of the lemon juice.  We also add some tobasco - what ever amount suits your taste.  If it gets too thick before you have incorporated all the oil simply add a bit of water.  I notice that if I add the oil too quickly (when using my hand mixer) it gets thicker than when I am patient.  Expect it to take some time, 10 - 15 minutes - unless you use the immersion blender.  Don't be in a hurry especially at the beginning when you are getting the emulsion started.  And you shouldn't stir this once it is made (except for adding to your potato salad or whatever) or it will separate

I've read all of the reviews plus good old Betty Crocker, tinkered a bit and my custom mayo is this:  Using an immersion blender: an egg, a dollop of dijon mustard (1/2 t.?), a heaping 1/4 t. salt, 1 T. lemon juice, a dash of cayene pepper, 1/2 T. sugar, 1/2 cup light EVOO, 1/2 canola oil and blend!!  Start with your blades at the bottom of a quart size canning jar and blend until it starts to emulsifies and then pull your blender up slowly.  Bob's your uncle - Fanny's your aunt -you have thick, creamy homemade mayo and you'll never buy it from the store again.  If you don't have an immersion blender, a regular blender works just fine too.  It's the ingredients that make this one work without being too bland.  The two types of oil and the sugar cut the oily-ness of some of the other recipes.  With this mayo I make my own tartar sauce, 1000 Isand Dressing, etc. and my develed eggs never stick around for long!!!

Excellent! Easy. I tried this a few ways now and as written this is perfect.  The variations I tried - well lets say some worked and some didnt.  I omitted the mustard powder in one batch, and it was great.  I used corn oil in another because I was out of vegetable and that turned out very very well and added good tablespoon of garlic powder - YUM :) - but the one I tried with olive oil - well I liked it, but a few others that tried didnt.  It has to be a really good olive oil which I used and liked but unless everyone likes it, it just wont work.  Lovely recipe.  Saves a FORTUNE (has anyone noticed the price of mayo lately? WOW!)  this recipe is now my  standard mayo and I'm going to keep working on those variations.  This weekend I'm going to try it with onion - maybe a bit of onion soup mix! seems the sky is the limit here. thanks rfmommy :)

I didn't like this at all!  It was nice and creamy, but it had NO mayo flavor.  I added more salt, vinegar and lemon juice, garlic, paprika, sugar, anything to give it some flavor.  Very oily also.  I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

This was wonderful.  I didn't know mayo could taste so good.  I used it in the slaw dressing Easter and to make ham salad the next day with leftover ham.  Both wonderful.  Also good on plain ol' lunchmeat sandwiches.  I went exactly by the recipe.  I did use pasteurized eggs due to salmonella concerns.

I never in a million years would have thought the comments re: using an immulsion blender would have worked.  From start to finish, this took all of - what - 10 seconds?  maybe 15?  Halved recipe, dumped everything (oil last) in mason jar, placed blender on bottom as others recommended and TADAH!  Totally incredibly fantastic!  Thanks so much all!

Perfect, simple recipe. I will try some different vinegars and lemon juice in the future just to vary the flavor. Also interested in adding some herbs as has been suggested. I have made mayonnaise before in the blender and it was kind of a pain - took several minutes to get it uniform and then a big mess to clean up. Now I just use our stick blender (bamix) and a wide mouth jar. It really does take less than a minute to mix and no fuss. I took my eggs straight out of the fridge, and it doesn't seem to matter much ow the oil is added. Total time start to finish is less than 5 minutes. Rinse the stick, screw on the cap and you've got bottled mayo in the fridge. My family loves it.

I have been wanting to make my own mayonnaise for a while now, but never had the nerve to try it.  Now I am kicking myself for not doing this years ago!  I made the recipe without any modifications and it is great.  I use it as a base and add in additional flavorings as I am using it.  I will never go back to processed mayo.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! 
After making this several times I had to share.
I have been spending a ton on mayo ever since I decided to start making homemade ranch because it became so EXPENSIVE and UNHEALTHY. Now with a few things that I keep on hand all the time I can and do make my own in 10 minutes. It's better then any thing on the store shelf. Using the right kitchen tools and following a few simple tips makes this recipe a success.
THANK YOU for sharing :)

Try using Pasteurized Eggs to avoid salmonella. They are hard to find but I have found them at Schnuck's in Arkansas and Tennessee as well as at Central Market in Texas. I, personally, would not serve raw egg products to young children or to the elderly. (Pasteurized eggs costs more, but gives me peace of mind when serving raw or undercooked eggs).

This was very easy to make especially since I drizzled the oil slowly. I don't have a food processor so just used a regular mixer. The consistency was a lot thinner than the mayo we buy but it tasted fine. (even though I didn't have dry mustard). My problem with it was how thin it was and how soon it separated and went bad. I may try to make it again but next time will half the recipe so we'll be more likely to use it up. I was not happy about throwing out ingredients even if it was 2 weeks later.
Update: I made this again, cutting the recipe in half so we won't have to throw it away in 2 weeks. This time I beat the egg, vinegar, and salt on a high speed until it was foamy; then drizzled in the oil and it came out way thicker. Yay! Next time, I'll beat the egg on its own even longer before I add anything else.

I took other reviewers' suggestions and put the first 4 ingredients in a qt mason jar and used my immersion blender while drizzling in the oils.  I used a combination of extra light olive oil and grapeseed oil (I refuse to use canola oil since it is almost always genetically modified).  I also subbed live apple cider vinegar for the distilled white and I added in @ 1 tbsp whey from the top of a plain greek yogurt container (both the live ACV and the whey for extra probiotics).  It got super thick, much thicker than my first try at homemade mayonnaise using another recipe on this site.  I found it be be very bland and oily tasting but I think it will be fine for my purposes.  Next time I might add a bit more salt or a tiny bit of garlic.  thanks for the recipe! updated - mayo seemed to taste better after sitting longer.  It worked out well for us and I am back to make more.

Very good and simple recipe.  I have also used juice from a half of a lemon (= 2 TBS).  Very tasty! I also have tried using apple cider vinegar and added a teaspoon of garlic powder... yummy!  Will never buy mayo from the store again!

I originally made this as directed although w/EVOO; too too bitter and oily!  Dumped that batch and made another w/ 3/4 cup Smart Balance oil, 1 tsp each of lemon juice and cider vinegar, and a small squirt of yellow table mustard along w/the salt.  Placed all the ingredients in a 1-qt canning jar and used my immersion blender; made up in less than 20 seconds.  That is a great tip, BTW! So so yummy!

This mayo is amazing. I like how it uses the whole egg so there is no wastage. Have made this twice now in three weeks. Everyone adores it and we will never go back to buying supermarket mayo as there is no comparison. I use a blender the first time and then tried the stick mixer for the second batch. I found it easier to do with the stick mixer and a lot quicker.

The recipe is a good starting point from which to make your own mayonnaise.  I've tried several different recipes - all of which call for a slow drizzle of the oil.  Every time I follow a recipe, it NEVER turns out.... always ends up soupy.  For me, I use my immersion blender.  I put the egg in first, then add all of the oil.  Submerge the blender to the bottom and while keeping it firmly on the bottom, I give a couple of 1/2 to 1 second bursts.  As soon as it looks creamy, I start to slowly incorporate the rest of the oil.  Once all of the oil has been fully incorporated, I add the other ingredients.  I also add a little onion powder and paprika.  The thing that I loved about *this* recipe is the whole egg concept.

Awesome. I was so excited when it turned out so good. Olive oil flavor comes out so clear. Will try it with different variations. I am sure I will never BUY a mayo.

I use this recipe all the time. It is fast and easy to make. Tastes so much better than store bought and, since I use grape-seed oil, it is actually healthy! Grape seed oil does not leave any taste at all. Some times I add a little paprika.... :) I also exchange the lemon juice and white vinegar once in a while...depending on my mood and what I have on hand. I put everything but the oil in a wide mouth quart canning jar, use my stick blender, have the oil in a squeeze bottle with a long nozzle (so it can fit down into the jar as I am blending) and put the lid on the jar when I am done. Less mess...and that is always good! ;) I also label it with the date made....cause my life is busy and sometimes it is hard to keep track of when I made it ;)

I have always wanted to try making mayonnaise, so when I saw this recipe, I decided to give it a whirl (no pun intended).  I cut the recipe in half and used white wine vinegar, because I am out of distilled white vinegar.  Based on several reviews, I used a dollop of dijon mustard in place of the dry mustard powder.  I put all the ingredients in the clear plastic mixing/measuring cup that came with my immersion blender, immersed the blade all the way to the bottom, and let 'er rip.  Emulsification started almost immediately and the entire amount was emulsified and thickened in less than a minute.  My daughter kept trying to get me to tell her what I was making, but I made her wait until she tasted it.  She got a big grin on her face and said "YOU MADE MAYONNAISE!!"  The flavor was really good, but I think I put too much mustard in, so next time I'll use less.  I love the idea of being able to whip up fresh mayonnaise as I need it and not have all the chemicals and preservatives the store-bought stuff has, plus save money!  I don't think I'll ever buy store-bought mayonnaise again.

Make sure the egg is at ROOM TEMP!  I just put everything in a glass jar and stick my hand blender in and it whips it right up.....no need to drizzle oil drop by drop!

I use very little mayo in my diet as I try to eat low fat and simply don't really care for mayo. However, this recipe is outstanding when mayo (or salad dressing) is needed. Wonderful in tuna & egg salad, potato salad & creamy coleslaw. I use about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp freshly minced or pressed garlic, dijon mustard & minced fresh tarragon. I grow herbs in my kitchen window so will have fun experimenting with other herbs. Will also try my homemade raspberry vinegar. So many ideas & options! A big thanks to the inventor of stick blenders as nothing else emulsifies very well. :-)

Better than Hellmans!  I have not bought mayonnaise since I first made this 3 months ago and I will probably never buy mayo again.  I make a half batch at a time and use my immersion blender.  With the immersion blender I find it is not necessary to drizzle the oil in slowly and do it a quarter of a cup at a time instead.  It takes just a few minutes and it is sooooo much better than the stuff in the jar.  Even my daughter who swears she hates mayonnaise loves this!!!!

I used EVOO instead of vegetable oil and honestly, I think it tasted TERRIBLE.  I will try again with a different oil at a later date and see if it makes a difference.

Hadn't realised making mayo was so easy!!  I did find that after 1 cup of oil it was very thick so didnt bother adding much more and also tasted quite bland, so added more mustard, salt and some crushed garlic.  might do some experimenting with lemon juice and adding other flavours.

This is the basic recipe I use for mayo, and it works every single time. I've made it with all the ingredients at room temperature, and I've yanked a couple eggs out of the fridge and slopped it together, and it still works. I personally am not a fan of mayo with olive oil for things like sandwiches (my main mayo use), but it's good if you're going for more of a sauce than a condiment. Adding fresh herbs to this recipe is also good, and when the week's lunchmeat is roast beef I usually throw in some prepared horseradish and a clove of garlic. Lemon juice subbed for vinegar (and a little grated lemon rind if you're feeling fancy) really does improve the taste, but it's perfectly fine as is.

I'll never go back to store bought mayo.  Not that this tastes all that different, but because 1) Since we raise chickens for eggs I can make this for almost nothing. 2) No chemicals. 3) I can add different things to make it even tastier for the meal at hand.  What I do differently from the recipe - I put my eggs, salt, mustard, 1T vinegar, 1T lemon juice and whatever else I'm going to add (usually 1 clove of garlic and a dash of white pepper) into a wide mouth mason jar and blend with my immersion blender, then slowly add in the oil with the immersion blender running until I get to the consistency that I want (usually takes about 1-2 minutes).

So delicious!  I've never made mayo in my whole life and it was so simple!  I did add garlic, paprika, and 1 tablespoon of water (to assist with the emulsion) for additional punch.  It was FANTASTIC!  

You have to add the oil super slow until it starts coming together then you can add it a bit faster.  Added it to this potato salad recipe: Allrecipes' Red Skinned Potato Salad. So delicious, my husband loved it!  :-)  Thanks rfmommy!

Great base recipe, flavor can be adapted whichever way you want. I used garlic powder in place of the dry mustard and used roasted garlic red wine vinegar in place of the white. used canola oil, didnt seem to matter how it was added...turned out great and is awesome in my potato salad.

This recipe is FAB!  Just finished up 2 different batches.  I tried it 1st in my KitchenAid food processor and failed miserably.  It never would mix correctly but my KA only has 1 speed...SO....I grabbed a quart canning jar and dumped all but the oil in and mixed for 20 sec.  Then I poured in ALL the oil at once.  I started at the bottom on high speed.  Instantly, I saw the makings of mayonnaise!  Lifting slowly, I blended until I felt it was thick enough and was holding its own form.  The 1st batch i made was all veggie oil.  Veggie oil is 100% soybean oil and pretty bad for men so the 2nd batch I made was 1/2 Coconut oil and 1/2 Veggie oil.  The first batch tasted like store bought but the second was much more exotic.  It will be great in chocolate cake!!  I popped the top of the canning jar on and now there is NO MESS to clean up!  How much do you love that?! It's great that there is NO waste in this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm not often impressed with some of the recipes here. Even 5 star rated ones are sometimes bland and boring but a lot of people seem to like that. THIS recipe impressed me. I made the half recipe version for immersion blenders. It took 30 seconds and was delicious. I'll never buy store bought mayo again.

Love it!! I have made it 2 times now.  The first time I didn't think it was quite tany enough for my family's taste, so the second time I made it I added a capful of lemon juice in addition to the vinegar.  That made it perfect.  I will not be buying mayonnaise anymore.

I sincerely wish I had halfed this recipe, since it was my first time, it called for a lot of oil, and I didn't need very much.  I did the recipe as written, and really didn't like it.  So next, I read the other reviews in earnest to salvage it, but I'm not sure I did.  After giving it the most boring 15 minutes of my life trying to incorporate it, I still had to add more vinegar, mustard, and finally sugar to be able to stomach it. I gave it 3 stars b/c I'm pregnant and have a love/hate relationship with all food.  I might like it when I'm not pregnant anymore.

Excellent base recipe! I made aioli for crab cakes, so I cut this recipe in half (and there was still enough for 2 dip cups worth). Used white wine vinegar instead of regular white, added 2 t of garlic, juice of 1/2 a lime, and 1/3 c fresh cilantro, and blended these with the egg etc. before adding the oil. I used olive oil, and I didn't quite use as much oil as needed because I wanted the sauce thinner. It is a brilliant green, a little strong alone but on the crab cakes delicious!

This is By far the best recipe for mayo! I use a stck immersion blender, sunflower oil, if using vinegar I add about 1/4 teaspoon less, if using lemon juice 1/4 teaspoon more. Sometimes I will add two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil for flavor, also tumeric and sometimes powdered ginger. I've tried making it in a blender and a cuisinart adding oil slowly but it doesn't come out as thick as when using the immersion blender.

I just tried to make this twice. Once in my Vitamix and once in my food processor. My containers were completely dry and I poured the oil in painfully slow... But both batches were a complete waste. I have been making vegan mayo with almonds and oil for years and that's supposed to be more complicated than this.

AWESOME! Finally got my nerve up to make homemade mayo and this recipe was perfect since I have fresh eggs.  So glad I read so many reviews first, used the wide mouth mason jar and immersion blender others suggested.  Added all the ingredients with the egg being first but being a little leary I put my blender in before adding the oil.  Worked PERFECTLY!  I did 2 subs, used my homemade seasoned salt for the salt and lemon juice in place of the vinegar. I still can't believe how easy this was!  For those finding it bland, I wonder if it isn't the extra salt and sugar commercial mayo has that they were missing.  Thanks for this recipe!!

Read a few of the reviews, so you get some tips. This mayo has a milder flavor, but it is very good. Go 1/2 vinegar and 1/2 lemon for that bolder mayo taste. Also, if you are used to the commercial stuff, this might taste bland, just add more salt to taste.

For an Spanish Alioli, delicious on baguette toasts, add 2-3 cloves of garlic (cut the brown root part).

Flavorwise might be 4 to 4-1/2 stars, but since there is no waste (egg separation) I gave 5 stars.

This turned out fantastic!  I will never buy mayo again as all the ones in the stores have GMO ingredients.  Easy recipe, tastes like normal mayo.  I've made mayo in the past, but it always tasted weird.

The first time I made this the consistency was perfect as I streamed in the oil. Then I decided to kick my blender into high gear and that turned it watery. I went back to the reviews and discovered that that was a no-no. 
So, I tried again (while my family waited patiently for BLTs). This time I halved the recipe, used canola oil instead of vegetable oil (does that matter?) and turned the blender to medium and left it there while I streamed in the oil. This time the texture was perfect but I was honestly a nervous wreck that I would waste so many ingredients again!
Upon taste, it was extremely bland. I would prefer a sauce with more tang. I'm going to use it still; maybe look around the world wide web and see how I can adjust this recipe to my liking! ;)

This turns out pretty good, I use  the stick blender.  the only problem I have is it is not very thick.
How do you get it thicker?  I have tried using less oil, 1 1/2 cups insteaad of 2  and I have also tried using 3 eggs instead of 2 but still it is on the thin side.
Even so it is very good and I now do not buy mayonaise at all.

Add me to the "never going to buy mayo again" list too! I like that I control the ingredients; it's not full of chemicals & stabilizers & preservatives... not to mention it's so much cheaper! I (almost) always have everything on hand, so it's basically free mayo in 5 minutes without a trip to the store, saving time & gas (plus all those impulse purchases I'd throw in the cart). 
I used the immersion blender & quart jar trick. Unfortunately, I was all out of vinegar, so I substituted the same amount of lemon juice as suggested by others. It was great! I then added 1/8 tsp sugar - even better. I still want to try it with the original ingredients (white vinegar, no sugar), out of respect for the recipe author.

I love the reviewer who said she felt like she'd discovered America when this recipe worked for her.  If she's already discovered America, then I've found the Mississippi River!  Yesterday I tried another recipe from an old cookbook & ended up with an oily liquidy mess.  Also I used my food processor yesterday.  Today, I followed this recipe exactly (except I added 1/4 t. paprika) and used my good trusty 30 year old Osterizer AND used the toothpick-hole-in-the-paper-cup tip and voila!  Beautiful, glossy, creamy, thick, luscious mayonnaise!  Thank you so much for this recipe and thanks to all who have offered their tips - especially the toothpick tip.  Easy, easy!  Who knew?

I just made this....after thinking that nothing could taste as good as BestFood Mayo, this recipe changed my mind. I did use meyer lemon juice instead of the white vinegar, though...used extra light olive oil and also added a bit more salt. I also used my stick blender and put the ingredients into a wide mouth quart jar. Was amazed at how quickly a great tasting mayo was made. I may not buy commercial mayo again. We are trying to stay away from soy, so thank heaven for homemade mayo recipes. I'll try different oils in the future, too. Thank you for sharing your recipe!!!

I used a food processor initially, but that machine is so loud and it's so early in the morning everyone else in the house is asleep :o)  So I transferred it to my plastic immersion blender cup and completed it (added seasoning, creamed to desired consistency) there.  Easy.

The technique worked well, but I should followed the ingredient list more dutifully. I substituted extra virgin organic olive oil for the vegetable oil - NOT GOOD. Came out with a bitter aftertaste. I'll definitely try it again, but with plain vegetable oil next time.

my whole family loves it :) I don't know that I will buy mayo again :) It is perfect with vegetable oil... but note I used half veg and half olive oil and it was not as thick, it was fluffier but not as thick. My husband was impressed with the consistency of the one I did with veg oil.

This worked well, smelled like and was the consistency of store-bought mayo. The only thing I would change is next time I'll add a little less mustard, and I will, as the custom version does, add apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. I used olive oil and peanut oil combined 1/2 and 1/2. And if you really want store-bought mayo taste, you might add a pinch of sugar, my husband said he missed that. :)

Absolutely wonderful!  I ran out of store bought mayo and didn't have the time or money to purchase more.  Following this recipe I made a substitution so great that we will probably never buy more form the store again.  I used a blender and slowly added oil until it stopped blending it in. It was about 1 1/4 cups oil used.  The mayo was thick, rich, creamy, and wonderful tasting.  I look forward to adding other flavors in as suggested by others

Great mayo!  I recently ran out, and being on a strict budget, couldn't afford to buy anymore from the store.  So I had all the ingredients, and decided to make this up.  It tastes wonderful, and I'll never buy store mayo again.

Wow, this is terrific.  The taste is so fresh.  I only used 1 1/2 cups of canola oil.  It tasted a little oily, so I put about 1TBSP of sugar in it.  That made it perfect.

Update:  Now I use olive oil

OMG I never thought hommade mayonnaise could taste this good!  I used cider vinegar and prepared dijon mustard ONLY BECAUSE THATS WHAT I HAD ON HAND and desperately needed mayo on a Sunday afternoon in France where everything's closed.  I made half the recipe thinking it would still be too much.  Huge mistake, I didn't even get a chance to take a picture because it was gone in that one sitting.  Even I ate and I tend to go easy on mayo.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe, no more store bought for me.  It's our family mayo from now on.  Next time I'll follow the original recipe and take a picture!!!!!

I absolutely love it...I will never buy Mayo again...this is SO much better.  Here are all the hints and tips from all the reviews that make this recipe perfect:

...1...we use 1 extra egg...we raise our own chickens;

...2...use lemon juice instead of vinegar...or balsamic vinegar;

...3...use olive oil...it seems to emulsify easier;

...4...use a wide mouth mason jar...and an immersion blender...diminishes the mess alot;

...5...we add the spices: 1 T of dijon mustard, 1 t of onion powder, 1 t of garlic powder and 1 T of sweet pepper relish;

...6...put eggs in bottom of jar...then add spices...and insert blender all the way to the bottom, resting on the bottom of the jar;

...7...this step takes longer than you would think...can be up to 20 minutes.  Turn on blender, keeping it on the bottom of the jar...SLOWLY add oil, cover the blender and eggs, it this addition that thickens the mixture.  I just slowly pick the blender up through the oil in the mason jar...works beautifully everytime!

...8...you can then adjust spices...keep taking and trying your mayo...this is how we came up with the flavoring we like best.

This is perfect. It will be my "go to" recipe for mayonnaise. I used avocado oil, pink Himalayan salt and apple cider vinegar to increase the health benefits. I put everything except the oil in the bottom of a tall narrow mixing cup, added the oil on top. Using a Bamix style stick blender, I placed it at the bottom of the mixing container before turning it on. Then slowly bring the stick blender up. Easy and almost instant mayo.

I followed the advice of others and added some lemon juice and a little extra salt and mustard.  I used safflower oil.  Made it with my immersion blender in a tall cup and it came together fast and tastes wonderful.

I have now made this twice, with canola oil.  The first time, I went directly by the recipe, except I substituted 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice for 1 Tablespoon of vinegar.  I made it in my food processor.  I incorporated the oil using the suggestion to jam a cup with a toothpick hole in the bottom into the lid, and pouring the oil in that way.  The resulting mayonnaise had good flavor, but it was not very thick and it was greasy.

The second time, I used several suggestions I had read for thickening mayonnaise.  I added more salt (1 1/2 - 2 teaspoons) and more mustard powder (about 1 1/2 teaspoons), and I brought all ingredients to room temperature first.  I was impatient, so I put the eggs into a bowl of hot water.  They were ready in about 10 minutes.

One other change I made, for flavor only, was going to all lemon juice instead of vinegar.  We had been using Hellmann's Canola Mayo for a long time, and were accustomed to the higher amount of lemon.  I also added some salt-free seasoning, which was completely unnecessary, but I wanted to play a little.

This time, the mayo is nice and thick, with a wonderful flavor!

Too much discussion of "slowly adding oil" etc. I increase the recipe by 50% and use a 50/50 blend of canola and olive oil, add a tablespoon of sugar and a clove of garlic, use a stick blender in a quart jar to mix all the ingredients but the oil. after about 30 seconds I dump the 3 cups of oil on top and move the stick blender up and down for about 30 seconds. A perfect quart of fresh, homemade mayo every time!

Fantastic recipe! Thanks so much for posting it. I am allergic to preservatives in food, so I have to make most everything I cook. I will use this recipe from now on. I only have a blender so I used that. It worked good, but I think a food processor would be easier. I plan to get one soon. Also, used the suggestion of the plastic cup with a tiny hole poked in the bottom to drizzle the oil. Worked like a charm. Was only able to use 1-1/2 cups of oil because may got so thick. :)

Can't believe this recipe has been rated anything less than a 5. It tastes just like Best Foods! No wait. It's better! I didn't even have the egg at room temperature. It' practically idiot proof. Dump all the ingredients but the oil in a cuisinart, pour the oil into the food pusher (which has a small pinhole in the bottom just for this purpose!) and go! Lemon juice or champagne vinegar are fantastic. Half olive + canola also great. A little french sea salt. Ooh lah lah. I'll never go back to Best Foods. NEVER!

Growing up in the South, mayonnaise was added to most all sandwiches and salads. Now with all the changes in commercial mayonnaise, I was looking for one that tastes like I remembered, and this is it! I did do as some recommended, using a little lemon juice as well as vinegar, and it came out wonderfully! This is a great recipe to use as a base for other things too, dressings, sauces, etc.

The first time I tried this I ended up with a watery substance. The secret is with the immersion blender, I also used egg yolk and didn't use the whites but that wouldn't matter. I used half vinegar and half lemon juice and it taste good. I put in all of the ingredients and started the blender and then started adding oil and voila, mayo!!! For those of you that thought it was bland, spice it up!

The first time I attempted mayonnaise, I failed - miserably. I don't think I used room temp eggs and my emulsion broke, leaving me with a giant oily mess. (I used really expensive olive oil, to boot!) But this time, I followed suggestions and used an immersion blender and a squeeze bottle to slowly drip 1/2 cup of oil in (drop by drop, so... super slow) and used the slowest immersion speed at first. (Was thin and runny looking.) When I added the second half of the oil, I turned the blender up to the highest speed and steady streamed the other 1/2 cup of oil, while moving the blender up and down. It worked amazingly! The result was fluffy and wonderful! Some substitutions I made: 1T red wine vinegar and 1T fresh squeezed lemon juice. I also used safflower oil instead of vegetable. It has a very fresh flavor... and I like the fact I know exactly what's going into my condiment. ;)  This recipe is a bit on the mustardy side for me, so next time I make it, I'll use less mustard. But, this is great base recipe you can totally tweak to make different many types of mayos! Thank you, rfmommy!

Good basic recipe. I tweaked it by adding Dijon mustard instead of dry, 1T. Cider vinegar and 1 T. white, 1whole large egg and1yolk (omitted 1 white), and extra salt to my liking. I blended all ingredients in my Cuisinart food processor except oil, which needs to be added at a slow drizzle. I used canola.  You could use EVOO. I've used that to make aMediterranean version which has lemon juice and garlic (no mustard, no eggs). Try either, you'll like it as long as you add the oil properly!!!

Great recipe! Here's a helpful tip to assist with the slow pouring. I take a funnel and wrap a piece of saran wrap over the bottom end, securing  the wrap with a rubber bad. Then poke between 1 and 3 holes in it with a tack, rest it on the pour spout of my food processor and then just pour the oil in (I use olive oil) and it does the slow pour for you. I can usually only fit a cup in at a time and when it's finished I add the second cup. I also add a little extra salt.

This was great.  I used prepared mustard and used double mustard and vinegar because it tasted like oil before.  Easy to make, but took me 20mins in a blender.  I will make this recipe often.

Awesome and easy.  Never buying mayo again!  I was worried it wouldn't taste like normal mayo because it uses the whole egg; I am use to it being made with egg yolks.  I didn't have mustard powder so I added 1/2 tsp of dijon and little less vinegar since dijon has a little vinegar in it already.... turned out great.  Also added a couple chipolte peppers to a batch and made a smokey/spicey mayo=yummy

Mmmmm! Just made this when I ran out of mayo for potato salad and it made my potato salad taste even better!!! I did make it with 1 Tbsp of white vinegar and 1 Tbsp of cider vinegar. Very versatile recipe.

WOW! Halved this recipe so I could make it with my Cuisinart blender stick. Put all ingredients into the jar (no drizzling that way), as suggested by a previous reviewer. I had perfect mayo in 30 seconds! I think I may buy egg beaters next time since my 12-year-old is skeptical of eating something with raw eggs in it. Still, easy and fabulous--thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe works great, every time. I will just say it again, all ingredients MUST BE AT ROOM TEMP or it will not emulsify. I had that happen once.  Great tip with the paper cup idea!

When I made this the first time I didnt run it in the blender long enough. The second time I also took the cap off on the blender and drizzled Canola Oil as one of the other reviewers suggested and added a little bit of pepper. This is the Only Mayo we will ever use again. It is so simple and tastes so much better than store bought without all the chemicals and additives :)

Having made French style mayo for years with yolks and olive oil, I found I missed the commercial mayonnaise of my childhood that Mom used to buy in the grocery store. This recipe achieves it that taste and looks exquisitely creamy and white in the jar, probably due to the inclusion of the egg white.

Thank you for posting this recipe, rfmommy. It came in very handy. Saved me a trip to the store for only a jar of mayonaise. 
It does work well in a food processor. It was an ideal amount for me, I was in the middle of making a potato salad and realized that I didn't have any mayonaise, although I had just bought a jar a week ago. Couldn't find it and didn't want to go to the store for only mayonaise. So, I thought I'd look here for a recipe and so glad I did! I do have approximately a cup leftover for turkey salad sandwiches. :) Thanks again!

The egg whites (by not omitting them) give a lighter mayonnaise so this recipe is perfect for me.

Super easy, cheap, and tasty! I would highly recommend using a stick blender (about $20). I put everything except the oil in a tall mason jar and pulsed until just blended. Then, poured 1 cup of oil in while blending. Poured remaining oil in and blended continuously adding an up and down motion. I did that for about 2-3 minutes. Threw the lid on it and done!

I had a recipe similar to this years ago which came with my Oster blender. My recipe only used the egg yolk.  It gave variations which could be made and one was to add bleu cheese to make bleu cheese dressing.  It was much better than any store bought dressing.  Try it.

I love homemade mayo, and it´s very easy to make.  Two tips I´ve enjoyed:  1) add a small/med boiled, peeled potato to the initial ingredients to be blended, and then only use 1 cup oil.  2) add a garlic clove or a bouillion cube to the initial ingredients to be blended for a change of flavor.

I was so proud of myself. I made Mayonnaise and it was the perfect texture, just like store bought. I thought the flavour was a little bland, and would like it a little more tangy.

Had to make it twice, I used Extra Virgin Olive oil, and it was bad! I think a light olive oil would make a big difference. So the second time i used canola oil since i didn't have vegetable oil in the house, and it turned out great.  Also I just a Tupperware hand blender/chopper and it worked great.

Do as one reader suggested and add the oil excruciatingly slow.  I didn't do this on my first attempt and I ended up with a soupy yellow looking liquid that was nothing like mayonnaise at all.

OMG...this is good! I'm trying to focus on eating less processed foods and making things from scratch so I know what is in them. Making this mayo was soooo easy! They lie about the "Prep Time" and "Ready Time" though. It took me about 30 seconds to "prep" and grab everything I needed, and about 2-3 minutes with the immersion (boat motor) blender to turn this all in to mayo! It got nice and thick and it's really creamy. Delish!

I have one of those 3 cup cuisinart choppers with the oil holes in the lid and this was a breeze to make and the TASTE was amazing.  I'm never buying $5 jars of mayo again.  This is a great recipe and it saves money too.

My first time making mayo, I halved the recipe, threw it in glass pitcher and whipped it with the immersion stick and gave it a few pumps. I was amazed, this is stupid easy.

no more store bought mayo for this family! the immersion blender and a wide mouth quart sized Mason jar is the key to making this as easy and mess free as possible. 
eggs in the bottom, everything else on top, oil last. I have made it twice. the first time using half lemon juice, half apple cider vinegar. the 2nd time 2 tbsp of red wine vinegar. vegetable oil each time. both were amazing. I am going to keep trying different spice and acid variations for variety. this mayo made the shrimp salad from this site even tastier. 
starting at the bottom and blending up worked so quickly.

First time reviewing a recipe. I read the reviews and decided on 1/2 cup evoo and 1 1/2 cup vegetable oil. I also used room temperature eggs, and an onion, garlic, salt seasoning blend. The immersion blender worked amazing! I added the eggs, vinegar, and seasoning, blinded until well mixed, then slowly added in the oil, moving the immersion blender up as I went. Cooled for a couple of hours and my VERY picky husband has already said he can't wait to make a sandwich with it.

Slowly added the oil at a rate of 1 cup per minute, and it turned out awesome! Added 1/4 tsp of paprika, and 1/4 teaspoon of Garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Might add a touch of sugar next time.

I cut this recipe in half. Consistency was good but definitely needed more flavor!  In the end, the only thing I cut in half was the oil and an egg - used the quantities for the rest of the ingredients as listed or if you're making the full amount ( 2 eggs, 2 cups oil ) double the rest.

I used my immersible blender the second time I tried this and it worked beautifully!  I added all the ingredients except the oil (avocado oil for flavour and health benefits) into a large mason jar, then put in the blender and slowly poured the oil on top so it was floating on top of the egg mixture, then I started the blender and once it started to emulsify (10 seconds), I slowly pulled the blender upwards and VOILA!, mayo in less than 2 minutes. Brilliant!  The first time I tried this, I used my blender and it was a huge mess and it didn't  work!

Nice recipe -- having no Hellmans on hand I tried this -- my only problem was the oil I had on hand -- it was a "vegetable" oil and I used mostly that, and about a 4 oz of EVOO. The taste was good, but I could really sense that inexpensive oil.  100% EVOO would be a disaster flavor-wise, in my opinion.  Thanks to those who insisted on the slow slow pour of the oil.  I didn't even end up adding all 2 cups.  My VitaMix emulsified this beautifully.

Chicken and everything else chopped up for chicken salad when I realized I was out of mayo. Immediately found this and will NEVER buy mayo again.  Cheap and delicious, read the reviews so made it in a jar with an immersion blender stick and was happy as a clam.  Cannot wait to try using infused vinegars and different mustards to get my own perfect version but this one is great mayo, pure and simple!

So, I just made this and it turned out very well! Super creamy and flavorful! I did use all olive oil (to make it healthier) and that made it kinda strong and a bit bitter to me. No fault of the recipe though!! I just caution using all olive oil unless you really enjoy the flavor of olive oil. Otherwise use only partially olive oil to make it a bit healthier.

I used white wine vinegar and added 2 teaspoons of fresh squeezed lemon juice and only 1 tablespoon of the vinegar. I also used safflower oil as it is very light. Great, easy recipe!  I also found that using my immersion blender and making sure my eggs were room temperature kept my mayonnaise from not emulsifying. I now make it in the jar that I intend to keep it in.

Love this recipe. When I make it I add closer to 3/4 tsp of salt. I found that making it in a food processor is much easier than in a blender. It gets too thick for a blender to mix well. I also use about 1 tsp of yellow mustard instead of dry mustrard powder (I just didn't have any powder). Everyone that tries my mustard loves it!

This was my 2nd attempt at making mayo - I really appreciated PattyJoy's tip! Instead of a blender, I used my food processor. I also used Olive Oil including 1 T of White Truffle oil. WOW - I will never buy mayo again!

This is a great recipe if you are concerned about wasting the egg white.  I have made this recipe using all kinds of oil and my favorite is regular vegetable oil.  I would not recommend using Extra Virgin Olive Oil, as it lends to much flavor to the end result and can give your mayonnaise an almost bitter note.  Like others I have split the acid using 1 Tablespoon White Vinegar and 1 Tablespoon Lemon Juice for a nice addition to the flavor, I also added an extra 1/4 teaspoon of salt.  Also, like many others suggest, I use my immersion blender and add all the ingredients to a quart mason jar and start at the bottom and blend up.  It is amazingly effective and mess free.

It is exactly my recipe this is how I've been making mayo since I was 14.This is very cost effective as you see in my country buying a 200 gm of mayo costs over 190 bucks I find this recipe very comforting.And to be honest I never made mayo with olive or vegetable oil.As you see in our part of the world we use soy bean oil and I've been making mayo with it and to give more flavor and texture I  process whole mustard seed with my mayo and trust me it rises more flavor in your pallet.

I followed the recipe to a T. It was a decent recipe and I would make it again but maybe with a few mods. I have made other mayos that had a little bit better flavor...maybe due to the fresh lemon/lime juice in the recipe.

This mayonnaise is great.  I usually half the recipe so I can use it up quicker.  I put everything in a jar that it will be stored in.  Using an emmersion (stick) blender.  Place the blender in the bottom of the jar and turn it on.  By the time I raise the blender it's done.  I get creative and add garlic powder, chili powder or whatever suites the recipe I'm making and viola...yummy mayo without the soybean oil.  I use peanut oil

Love this recipe. Love that I'm not wasting half the eggs and the consistency is perfect.  If it's coming out to thin try to blend the other ingredients till the egg color is pale yellow then SlOOOWLY add the oil. And if you have a food processor (mine's a cuisinart) Check to see if there's a small hole in the bottom of the hollow, cup like, food pusher, sometimes you can put the oil in there and it will drip in slowly on it's own.

I used olive oil in-place of vegetable oil as suggested by one of the other reviewers on here. DO NOT DO IT! If you love yourself/your family do not do it. It was beyond horrible.  I have no doubt this recipe would have been great had I not used olive oil. I gave it 4 stars because I feel it does need lemon juice which isn't included in the original recipe.

flawless! I made as written with the addition of one tbsp of fresh lemon juice because I like mine extra tangy. Used to recommendation of another reviewer by using an immersion blender in a wide mouth jar and I was amazed at how easy it was, great it came together, and there was NO CLEANUP :) 

The first time I made this I used olive oil and it tasted very... olive-y. I would only do this if you love the taste of olive oil because it continues to be the dominate taste in the mayo. Will use something light next time. I have also thought about using rice wine vinegar next time with a light oil to make an asian inspired mayo for sushi and salads.

This is a great recipe!  As other posters advised, I used olive oil and added it very slowly, and added 1 tsp lemon juice.  Excellent basic mayo recipe!

Wow, how easy!  Used the immersion blender in a mason jar.  This was simple, not messy, and very tasty.  I can see how this recipe would lend itself to some great flavored mayonaise recipes.  Thanks for the inspiration!

Wow...why have I never made mayonnaise from scratch before?  Great, easy recipe that you can adapt to your own taste.  I even used eggbeaters egg whites and it still was amazing.

This is a great, simple recipe. I use extra virgin olive oil, and double the salt and mustard. (My family's tastes are on the spicy side.) My kids eat tons of this plain on our home made whole wheat bread.

I made this with my Cuisinart Stick Blender in 30 seconds. I put all of the ingredients in the cup that came with the blender and turned it on. Using a slight up and down motion, it was done in under a minute. I even showed a friend and now she is buying a stick blender - LOL! Since the mayo will not last as long as commercially processed mayo, I cut the recipe in half. You can add any seasoning you would like and this recipe is flexible as far as the type of oil that you would prefer.

Thank you, Thank you, Thank you....... I was out of mayo for egg salad. Followed the recipe as is with great results the first time. I did not have to use the full 2 cups of veg oil. And had to sub Dijon mustard for mustard powder. I am amazed at the big difference between this recipe and store bought I will NEVER use store bought. And thank you to all the reviews. Very helpfull.

I would have rated this higher, but no matter how slow I go or what type of mixer I use it ALWAYS WINDS UP THIN! I read all reviews and did lots of research and still just really thin, albeit, tasty mayo sauce. If there are any suggestions to help me out, I will gladly change my review but right now it stands at a 2.

Definitely use the food processor and pour the oil in slowly. For the first cup or so, I used 1 TB at a time to add the oil in and that worked. So excited to not use store bought mayo ever again!!!

Excellent recipe!  Due to a friend's allergy, I needed mayo without soybean oil, and I'm thrilled to find this one.  I used my stick blender and followed "Deedles" tips, using the 16 oz tall measuring cup (that came with the blender) and put everything in at once (eggs first, then ingredients, and oil last)... and I divided the recipe in half.  By immersing the blender to the bottom, and slowly raising it as it thickened, I made mayo (for the first time) in less than a minute.  I used spicy brown mustard, 1/2 lemon juice and 1/2 white vinegar, and canola oil.  It is delicious and I will never buy it at the store again.  Thank you rfmommy for posting, and thanks everyone for so many great tips.

Mine is... OK.  Looks perfect, but I think I goofed and used oil that I've had around for a bit - it just tastes funny, and not in a good way.  I added more sea salt (about 1 t. Sel Gris Sea Salt) and will read more reviews, because I'm going to try again with FRESHER oil, and see what happens.  Also going to get paper cups so I don't have to spend 10-15 minutes drizzling in the oil.

Excellent! I used my blendtec blender and followed the suggestion of putting the oil in a paper cup with a small hole in the bottom and placing it in the top of the blender so it would drip slowly. I will never buy mayo again.

I really don't know what happened, I tried this recipe and followed it exactly, and did not work, it never emulsified.  Tried using a mason jar and started fresh, and that didn't work either, just ended up with a frothy mess.

WOW! Great tasting and just as easy as can be. I used the suggestion substituting 1T lemon juice and 1T apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar. Using a stick blender in a one quart canning jar is super efficient. I also proclaim: "I'll never buy mayonnaise again!" Look forward to trying other seasonings for special mayo-spreads.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY and used a food processor.  I poured the oil VERY slowly and used fresh ingredients.  The oil wasn't rancid going in, but my final product tasted like rancid oil.  Not sure what went wrong, but it was a total waste!  Tried adding garlic powder and onion powder.  It added some good flavor, but you this was not to my liking.

Good and super easy! Use regular mustard, and half lime juice /vinegar. Added 1Tsp sugar and dash or pepper. The cup with a tooth pick hole works very well! I use half the recipe cause I don't need that much mayo..

I was looking for a recipe due to lemon and sugar sensitivities in my kids. This worked great! I had all the ingredients at room temperature and I didn't even have to pour the oil in slowly. I was able to get only 3/4c of oil in before it became too thick. I also threw in some paprika and an extra 1/2tbsp of vinegar. I used just a regular blender.

This really works!! I cut everything in 1/2 except the salt. Using light olive oil works fine...using extra virgin olive oil does make it quite bitter. It's so easy...I just dribble the 1st 1/4 C of oil into the beaten egg/spices with a teaspoon while beating on high with a hand mixer, then very slowly pour in the rest. Lasts 2 weeks in frig. Great recipe! Healthy and cheaper!

How neat!  Ran out of mayo and I just knew I'd be able to find a recipe here.  This would be a great "project" to involve the kids in - to watch how it comes together.  Next time, I'll decrease the amount of mustard powder, but other than that, very easy recipe!  Thank you for posting!

Great recipe.
I hate mayonnaise normally but i LOVE this one.
Very quick and easy.
I make it in half batches and just slowly poor the oil from the measuring jug and i have never had a problem.

i just made this recipe (9/22/19). I had the problem of a runny mayo, not the thick creamy mayo that I like. I went to a food blog site for help. There was a simple explaination for the runny mayonnaise. Whole eggs produce a runny product and egg yolks only produce a creamy product. So, if you like a thinner mayo, then this is the recipe for you. If you like a creamy mayo, then this recipe is not for you. I am a creamy girl myself. So, this will make for a great mayo based salad dressing!!

I used all of the suggestions made by Cathy Van de Moortele and opted for lemon juice. I made a tiny mistake by using 1/2 teaspoon of reduced sodium salt salt instead of 1/4 tsp (whoops!) but a 1 1/2 teaspoon of sugar balanced out the flavor. I also held back a bit on the oil (around 1/8 of a cup or so) just to shave a little fat.  I'm letting it chill for an hour or so before I actually use it allow the may to set. But what I tasked off my teaspoon was yummy, far superior to the store-bought stuff. Immersion blender and glass jar for the win!

it was not thick like mayo is suppose to be instead it's very runny!  Taste is ok.  I wanted to make a potato salad for our son-in-law who has Celiac Disease and store boughten has a flour source in it.  Back to the drawing board for a better recipe.

I 've read rave reviews of homemade mayo, but I've never made it before because I don't really like mayo, I prefer Miracle Whip. I am so glad I finally made this! It is awesome! I thought the original recipe was good but somewhat bland so I added a tsp. of garlic powder, a tsp of smoked paprika, a tsp of black pepper, and a tsp of red pepper (cause I like heat) WOW!!! I will never buy mayo from the store again. This has taken sandwiches to a whole new level :)

I made this with olive oil and it tastes disgusting. I don’t think my olive oil is rancid, but it tastes bitter almost as if it is.

I did this in a stand alone blender. I didn’t use room temperature eggs since I was in a pinch. However, adding the oil very gradually is key when making sure it comes out to the consistency you’re seeking.

This mayo turned out well the second time. It was too thin the first time. The second time I separated the whites and yokes and ran the first cup of oil through with whites then added the yokes. It came out thick that way. I also tried putting a hole in the bottom of a plastic cup to slowly drizzle the oil and it worked perfectly until the end. When it slowed down toward the end I poured the rest in by hand. Much easier than pouring all of it by hand slowly!

Once you do or make something like riding a bike you do not forget and can do it again this is a basic recipe but then once you succeed in using it correctly you can do it again and learn on your own.  Today after numerous attempts and runny production I succeeded and so I guess I am happy. 

Thanks

This turned out very creamy and “full”. I enjoyed the methodical process required to make mayonnaise; however, I was not fond of the flavours. Perhaps I needed a nicer quality oil or a different type of vinegar but I was missing the “yum” factor I find in a Hellman’s mayonnaise. Thanks so much!

Put all ingredients in a quart measure starting with oil. Add rest of ingredients to quart measure. Place stick blender at bottom of quart measure. The stick blender will be on top of the two eggs. Start that bad boy on high and leave it on high. Once you see your mayo start to form at the bottom tilt your stick blender to the side a little. This will suck more oil down do keep emulsifying the mayo. Slowly bring the stick blender up and watch the rest of the one minute mayo magic. Next swirl stick blender up and down to thoroughly blend everything together until nice and thick. Now here is the important part. Once done DO NOT refrigerate yet. Why? you ask. To let the vinegar do it’s work on the protein in the egg at the proper temperature. I usually set it in a warm not hot corner of the kitchen for a couple hours. I know what you are thinking AHHHHH! Salmonella. No worries folks. It won’t be in the temperature danger zone long enough to grow the beasties. Plus it’s ph also inhibits growth. This one step will make a huge difference in taste and texture. Next refrigerate for up to two weeks.

Super easy to make.  Minor tweaks: I added just a pinch more salt and a little lemon juice to give it the flavor I expect from a Hellman’s or Kraft product.

This is the first from scratch mayonnaise recipe that came out great for me!! I’ve been searching for one for a long time! I read the reviews and used half vinegar and half lemon juice and substituted Dijon mustard for the dry mustard. The immersion blender was a great and super easy tip!!Ty!!

Will never buy mayo again. Since no preservatives- make in small batches. Flavor develops in the fridge and I use limes for citrus.

I have made the mayo according to the recipe and it was good. 
When I made it a second time, I replaced the oil with avacado oil and also chose to use sea salt, a pinch of garlic powder, a pinch of paprika and a splash of lime. Wonderful! The acid of the lime juice brightens up the taste.

Despite the comments below, I heartily recommend this mayonnaise recipe. I am going to use this one forever.  It was very good. I appreciate the use of whole egg. Although I added a pinch of smoked paprika and more mustard powder, it still seemed blah compared to what i made as a kid. This is like store bought mayo, which is fine but unexpected.  The real reason for 4 stars is that I could not use the entire amount of oil. Even with much tamping, I still had 1/4 cup left over.  If it is an issue of using "up to" a certain amount of oil that should be stated. But it could be the vitamix... I'm going to try this with a food processor next to see if that makes a difference.  I don't actually care if it doesn't use all the oil, but I've made mayo a zillion times and not seen it.  Never whole egg, tho.  I will also amp three flavor up a bit with more mustard powder and paprika.

I make a half recipe at a time (because we are empty nesters and don't use a lot of mayo!) and use my trusty stick blender. Put all ingredients in a wide mouth Mason jar; place the blender at the bottom of the jar and turn on, after it begins to emulsify, slowly raise stick blender until all is fully incorporated.  I've also used lemon juice in place of the vinegar.  Easy peasy, quick and easy!  Why buy mayo at the store?

Stick blender, splash of water, used stick blender container totally dry, ingredients room temp, cider vinegar w/lemon juice to vinegar measurement, two oils definitely needed, or I will try just Safflower. I was excited to try this and only had a heavier olive oil, so as you said, it is on the bitter side, but that is easily fixed by using in a sauce, perhaps tarter with sweet pickles. Nothing, but salt as as a spice. My Vita-mix recipe uses whole eggs, but it is hit and miss for success. I hate cooking, but love healthy food. I feel I can finally go back to homemade mayo. Thank you for posting.

Makes perfect mayonnaise.  Remember all ingredients must be at room temperature.  I like this recipe particularly because there is no waste.  The flavor is fresh and mild so it is perfect as a base for potato salad dressing or slaw dressing.  I use lemon juice instead of vinegar due to the more subtle flavor.  It also makes it easier to make dressings that may require vinegar because the lemon doesn't have as sharp an edge.

This mayonnaise was rich, creamy, and delicious! This was the first time I had tried homemade mayonnaise and was concerned when I finished that the consistency was so runny. However, once refrigerated it became creamy and light. My family loves it!

I gave this recipe five stars because I like it and I think it will hold merit. I, unfortunately, used EVOO and there was a bitter after taste. I would like to try a different oil for this recipe because I think this will be the best.

made this 2 times, first time I dumped it out, tried again after reading some reviews and used my immersion blender poured oil way slower and moved the hand blender up and down and voila after a bit of time it frothed right up and was the consistency it was supposed to be!  I actually had store bought in the fridge so of course I had to compare....pretty friggin close I just added a bit more salt and its bang on!  This is great never buying mayo again!  I love making items that I  can  cross off the grocery list always way cheaper to do homemade!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is my second go at making mayonnaise and I liked this recipe better than the first.

I substituted fresh lemon juice for the vinegar (same amount), added maybe a dash more salt (I used kosher) and I reduced the oil to maybe just over a cup, my suggestion is to add it slowly and taste as you go.

I agree with the other reviews, a stick/immersion blender is almost a must and have your ingredients at room temp when you start.

First time making our own mayo and it was a interesting experience. Please read all reviews for tips and suggestions. There was some great ideas and it really helped. We used mustard powder, onion and a little garlic. Definately the salt also.

Definately add your oil in slowly. You will notice fairly quick if you are adding oil in too quickly.  Everyone will like a different taste so use your imagination. Highly recommend using the mustard powder it helps stabilize.

I used vegetable oil, others have used different kinds for various reasons.  Good luck!

We've all seen it; a rating when the recipe has been altered.  I did that, I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil (I had none).  The consistency was excellent but the flavor tasted like pure olive oil.  My mistake.  Will try again with vegetable oil.  Thanks for the recipe.

I make this all the time. I do t ever buy mayo or miracle whip any more.  I do make some changes however. I use honey Dijon mustard, I add a bit of stevia for sweetness, I put half lemon juice and half white wine vinegar, a bit of garlic, pepper, and pink Himalayan salt. I may vary different herbs depending on my mood.

This works beautifully, you'll never buy mayo again! The first time I made it I thought I was adding the oil slowly but the texture was thinner than I prefer. This time I really did add the oil EXCRUCIATINGLY slowly and it was just right. I added 1 tsp salt and 2 tsp sugar, and about 1 tsp Dijon mustard, lower measurements initially tasted too bland for me. Like another reviewer I only ended up needing 1 1/2 c oil, I used a sunflower/avocado blend and it worked/tasted great. Highly recommend!

I just have it a try.  Came out nice and creamy.. I have my own fresh eggs, I'll say it's quite tasty. Next batch I will try a variation.  I used a Ninja Blender. Was effortless.

I used canola oil instead of vegetable and added approximately a TBSP of lemon juice to the mix.  Lemon juice was a MUST.  Too bland otherwise. Turned out pretty well. Consistency was good. Would definitely make again. I am considering using olive oil (not virgin- too strong of a taste) next time...Kids are happy- typically we use the H** brand and they were fine with the homemade version.

I don't know what happened. I followed all suggestions and used exact ingredients. I would say I am an experience cook but I failed miserably with this recipe.

I want better. Easy, but not better than "Hellman's Real" in the bottle.  Still, it definitely is Mayo,  though I will keep looking.

great recipe! so easy and delicious. I didn't realise mayo could be made with whole eggs - I have been only using yolks up until now. I actually think the whole egg tastes better

Super easy! I added a clove of fresh garlic and 1 TBS of fresh thyme, used dijon mustard, lemon juice and canola oil. Came out perfect! Will definitely keep this in stock. Gonna try fresh basil next time and a bit of  Tabasco.

I added more mustard powder, and vinegar and used 1 cup Olive Oil and 1 cup Canola Oil. It came out really good.  I also made it in a stand mixer.  I will make it again.

First time making my own mayonnaise. I am surprised it came out as good as it did. Only thing I changed is that  I added some minced garlic and black pepper to the original recipe, and skipped adding the mustard ( we are all out of mustard and it's raining outside so... )


I am just praying that my mayonnaise doesn't separate , I would hate for it to go to waste since it tastes soo goood!!


I just have one question that do I have to keep the mayonnaise outside for hours before keeping it in the fridge. ( Read somewhere online that this gives the the acid time to kill the bacteria in the raw egg or some sh#t)

Hopefully eating this is won't make me sick ( not used to eating raw eggs, believe it or not)

This is a great, simple and fast recipe. After reading several reviews, I gave this a go in my Cuisinart food processor. While I did add the oil slowly, I didn't spend more that two minutes doing so. I kept a light steady stream pouring until it was all incorporated. At roughly the 5 minute mark, I wondered if it was going to solidify or, if like previous reviews, I would end up with a watery  egg and oil mess. To my surprise, it immediately came together, think of heavy cream turning to whip cream, and the result was a smooth, creamy mayo with great flavor. I did add a small amount of garlic, onion powder and lemon which worked well. I have made this several time since and experimented with different add-in's and the result has been the same, delish! I would definitely recommend this recipe and add, patience. Thanks for a great keeper!

This is amazing! I cut the recipe in half and it still worked perfectly-- 5 minutes from start to finish, with a perfectly silky mayonnaise as my final result. I used malt vinegar because that's what I had on hand, and I highly recommend it.

Never buying mayo from the store again!

I love the tip from someone else to use the stick blender and put all the ingredients in layers at once.  Oh my gosh!  I didn't think you could do that with mayonnaise.  I also needed more tang so I added more LEMON and more flavor so I added MORE SALT and for the mustard I used 2 tsp DIJON MUSTARD.  And then, because I was afraid it would be thin I added 1TBS COCONUT OIL.  superb!

That was fun! I used my stick blender as suggested, nothing slow about the process then.  I think it could a little more salt. I did use half lemon juice and half vinegar.

I am amazed! This was an easy to make mayonnaise and tastes SO rich! I used a hand held blender stick to make this mayonnaise, and it took about 8 minutes. Next time I plan on using my vitamix- which I'm sure will be even faster. No more store bought mayonnaise for me -ever again!

It turned out really well for my first time. Next time it will be even better. I added the oil a little too slow so the mixture got too thick for the blender before I added the remaining oil. I ended up stirring in the remaining oil with a spoon. This is definitely better than store bought.

This recipe came out perfectly. I was a little worried because it did not seem to be thickening at first but by time a added 1 and 1/2 cups of oil (I used light olive oil) it was coming along nicely. Added the additional 1/2 cup and it was simply divine.

Not sure why this didn't turn out, but all I got was oily liquid.  I followed the recipe (used EVOO)  and an immersion blender.  I think there is just too much oil in this recipe.  I will try it one more time using some type of vegetable oil ( and only do a half batch) because I want to give it a fair test using the original recipe as written.  Hopefully I can change my rating and not be tied to store bought mayonnaise!

I like that this used the whole egg and mustard powder. I don't like mustard and don't want to buy a container for the occasional time I make mayo. This mayonnaise doesn't have a lot of flavor, but it's a good base for adding flavor. I halved the recipe (I only needed a small amount), used 1/4 cup of garlic infused olive oil and 3/4 cup of avocado oil. The mayo came out extremely thick so I added the juice of one half of a lime. It's pretty good! Depending on what you're using this for, you may want to add cumin, paprika or other spices at the end. Play around with it, but this

Wow! I have never written a review for anything  but had to for this. I do not like mayo - I made this for my boyfriend last minute for BLTs and just tried a small amount and LOVED it! Like the bad review I read, it does not have that normal mayo taste that I can't stomach. This tastes fresh, light, creamy and just perfect! Thank you so much!

This was my first time making homemade mayo and it turned out wonderful, well I think I may have tried it about 10 years ago and failed miserably. I'm glad I read through the comments, someone said that she poked a hole in a paper cup and placed it on her food processor and let the oil drip slowly in that way. That was the greatest tip, because it trickled in slowly and the mayo was thick and tasty. I didn't have dried mustard so I used Dijon mustard (several other recipes used this) and it still worked beautifully.

I used an immersion blender to make this as a few of the reviews said to do and that worked much better than a regular blender would have, particularly when it got thick. 

It was OK. There seemed to be something missing... a zing, maybe? I added more vinegar and that helped a little, but it still didn't taste like jared or restaurant mayo. I think using the whole egg might have just made it more on the bland side.

I used the recipe with light olive oil. I used the stick blender method: put everything but the oil in the bottom of the narrow stick-blender cup container. Start blending, pour in the oil fairly quickly (less than 30 seconds) as you lift the stick blender up through the mixture to the top of the container over another minute I added a touch of granulated garlic, because I was using this for artichokes. Perfect mayonnaise consistency, with no "excruciatingly slow" step. My stick-blender container only holds 2 cups, so I couldn't quite get all  the oil in, but it didn't seem to make a difference.

I make this one all the time and I love it! I don't personally like mayo, never have. Well I didn't realize this is what mayo is supposed to taste like!! I love it! I make two variations of it. One is just as the recipe is and the other I had 2 T of sugar and 1/4 TSP of red Cayenne pepper to make a sandwich spread and we all love it. My husband is a miracle whip person and he absolutely loves my second version that I make and says it's so much better than store bought.

Cut this recipe in half for most needs
1. All ingredients must be room temperature
2. Use a n immersion blender and a tall, narrow plastic cup.   Make sure that they are completely dry.
3.   Replace vinegar with 50/50 mix of lemon juice and vinegar.    I like white wine vinegar and white vinegar. 
4. Add egg first, then half of the lemon juice/vinegar & seasoning (finely minced chives, basil, cilantro, paprika, capers, tarragon, etc).
5. Add oil very, very slowly, pref a slow drip. Hold the blade on the bottom of the cup, turn it on to the fast speed for 20 seconds then move up & down slowly until completely mixed.   Once emulsification begins, oil the rest of the oil can be added in a steadier stream, but still kind of slow.    And add  the remaining lemon juice/vinegar with the stream of oil.

I used organic eggs and organic extra virgin olive oil for a healthier version and it came out with a very strong olive oil taste (obviously). It just needs a good squirt of mustard or something to help cover the taste a bit and it's the bees' knees.

I tried it, and it failed miserably, oily, not creamy, didn't set - I found a recipe to help set it now I have to get some extra taste in it.  I will admit my eggs were cold that might have been the problem but won't try again.

So easy and tastes amazing... Much better than any store bought brand! 

The first time I made it I used the full two tbsps of red wine vinegar and a stick blender in a bowl. I could only use 1 cup of oil before the stick blender stopped working. I went on to use a whisk for another half cup of oil until I was exhausted! I didn't like how it turned out. It was too vinegary.

The second batch was perfect though. Used a blender which helped a lot. I also used a little less than one tbsp each of white wine vinegar and lemon juice. I'm not sure if I even made it to 1 1/4 cups of oil until it was thick enough. Love it!

I made 1/2 the recipe with a fresh egg from my daughters chickens and used olive oil and no mustard. It's very good.

This was my first attempt at making mayonnaise. This recipe was very good but I plan to play around with flavor. Would like it to taste close to Duke's if possible. The directions were very well stated. I used my food processer which only has low and high setting so I used the high setting and it came out great. (Tried my blender first with half recipe and it turned out runny. So then I switched to the food processer. Followed as directed with half a batch, then slowly poured in the runny mixture from blender. So I ended up making a whole batch.)

My husband loved this recipe! I have never made my own mayonnaise before, but I got a food processor for Christmas and figured I'd try it. I didn't have an issue with it being runny like some other people did. I drizzled the oil in extremely slow, like other reviewers suggested, and it came out the perfect texture.  I did add about a tablespoon of sugar for taste, however, just to suit my husband's tastes.

I make this on a regular basis. A stick blender is the best and easiest way to make it. We haven't bought mayonnaise in over a year and this practice is spreading threw my family. It works well for making home made ranch dressing.

I use this recipe regularly for potato salad. The taste is SO superior to store-bought mayo! This recipe is perfect as-is, but if you like the taste of olive oil mayo, simply sub 1/2 cup of olive oil for the vegetable oil.

I found this recipe when I was out of mayo and needed to serve sandwiches to guests. I was desperate for something I could make quickly with ingredients I already had on hand. I was amazed at this mayonnaise!!!  The consistency, color, flavor, even the amount of time it stays fresh in the fridge are all equal to or far superior to that of the store-bought variety. It is also unbelievably simple to make. I use avocado oil for a healthy fat and the recipe as-is, is perfect. But I have also added herbs for an herb mayo spread. This is a keeper!

I'm staying with my in laws in Africa and store bought mayonnaise is outrageously expensive and yucky here. I had never made mayonnaise before but decided to try it today. I didn't have mustard powder so I left that out.
The recipe worked great and was super-easy, the mayonnaise was excellent...I'm looking forward to making fancy versions with garlic etc. Thanks!

I have made my own may over the years with no great success, and have always returned to Hellman's or lately to my store brand.  Being stuck home with a hip injury, I was not able to get to the market, and wanted potato salad very badly, so I found your recipe. I shall never buy Hellman's or Kraft again.  I have an emptied pickled jar labeled PattyJoy Mayo.  Thanks for the great recipe and the knowledge that I will always have the best mayo in my refrigerator.

While this recipe looked and sounded good, I just did not care for it.  It doesn't taste anything like mayonnaise.  It did have the nice, creamy consistency of mayonnaise though.

We liked this, but it had to sit in the fridge for two days before the flavors melded together right. The second time I made it I added lemon juice and a little more salt. It was alright. I will continue to tweak it here and there until we find the right mix. But a great starter! My only complaint was that it seemed to gum up the blender and I had to stop and scrap a lot.

Tried this using Instructions from Buns review. It turned out tasty if a little thinner in consistency than store bought. Next time I'll reduce the oil abit.

Have been making this for over a year; stopped buying store bought mayo as the recipe halved takes 2 min to make.  
Thoughts: Don't use virgin olive oil because it gives a heavy taste, use canola, soy or for me corn oil works best.  NOT OPTIONAL:  Add some garlic powder and juice of a whole lemon for the whole recipe.  A little garlic powder imparts flavour without adding the garlicky taste, thats even for people who don't like garlic.
Perfect.
EDIT for people who keep failing this:  Use an immersion blender, blast for a few seconds all ingredients except oil and add oil last SLOWLY.

Easy to make. I followed the reviews that said to use a completely dry mixer & add the oil in a teeny tiny little drizzle that takes forever. I just gave it the pinkie taste. Yum. Refrigerating this to be used in a salad dressing recipe.

I used the EVOO and of course it is very Olivey and a little green tinged, but that and virgin coconut oil are the only oils i use (for health).  I don't think coconut mayo would be a hit. I will make this again.

I just finished making a batch of this recipe and it seems to have turned out pretty good. I might make some seasoning tweaks over time but the only issue I found so far is that I had trouble getting the last of the oil to mix in so I might just reduce the oil next time I make it. Oh! and I used canola oil instead of vegetable or olive as that's what I had on hand

I made this dressing this morning and used 1/3 cup evoo and the rest of the 2 cup measure using canola oil.  It tastes ok, but next time I will not use the olive oil as it is a little too heavy tasting.  Perhaps I will use coconut oil as a replacement along with the canola.  I will make this recipe again although I am not a big fan of mayo and prefer Miracle Whip, as it has more flavour and body.

This is the only recipe I use for making mayo. Sometimes I add garlic powder, salt and pepper. Other times I add some chipotle seasoning. I use an immersion blender and always get a rich delicious creamy mayo.

Thank you for this simple recipe for homemade mayo! Had I known it was this easy, I'd have made it instead of buying it all these years. I had about 2/3 cup leftover veg oil, so I used that and 1 bantam egg, 1 teaspoon white vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon white wine vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice, a little over an 1/8 teaspoon dry mustard and a little under 1/8 teaspoon salt. I used a hand blender. I have no patience, so the oil probably wasn't put in as slowly as it should have been (just a slow pour, not a drizzle), but it still came out perfect! Delicious flavor and excellent texture. Thanks again!

Great recipe. I didn't add the oil slowly enough so it didn't thicken as well as I had hoped. Added a tad more salt to taste, a pinch of sugar and another of white pepper. I've always been a Hellman's girl. Now I can make my own!

So amazing. I used olive oil and added minced garlic, and used a hand blender. Huge hit! Thank you.

Excellent recipe and easy to make. Helped me out when I was planning to make eggs salad and had no mayo. :-) I think I'll make my own from now on. Next time I might try extra virgin olive oil to make it a little healthier.

Made with Vitamix.  Awesome!  Substituted Bragg AC vinegar and EVOO.  After everythin was emulsified at medium speed, then I set it on high for a minute.  The high rpm warmed everything up and thickened the mayo. I didn't have mustard powdere on hand,  but it still tasted so good.  I will be using this recipe for my garlic aioli.

This is good recipe. Nice and simple. I did follow some of the tips in the comments, mainly about using lemon juice with the vinegar and I had to add some garlic and onion powder for flavoring since the mayo was too bland for my tastes. Other than that it was great! Will be making again.

This looks like mayonnaise, the consistency is perfect, but it has a slight bitter taste. I made another mayonnaise recipe on this site and it was bitter too. I followed these recipes to the letter, so I don't know where the bitterness is coming from.

this recipe was absolutely amazing.  i have never had homemade mayo before, and i couldnt believe how good mayo could taste.  the difference between this recipe and store bought is night and day, both in terms of texture and taste.  followed the recipe to a t, and used my kitchen aid stick blender.  i am looking forward to trying variations suggested by other reviewers in the future.  i will never, ever buy store mayo again.  thank you so much for posting.

I used 1/2 lemon juice & 1/2 apple cider vinegar for the 2 tablespoons of white vinegar and mixed with an immersion blender but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was so fun to see it change color and thicken!  I like the simple fresh taste, next time I'll probably add a touch more salt & maybe some herbs.  I can't believe how easy it was!  I'm excited to try different oils and seasonings :)

Use the lightest EV olive oil you can find, and the best freshest eggs at room temp. If you forget to take your eggs out then put in cup of hot water for just a few minutes. I believe this is very necessary to have room temp. eggs. I have made this for 3 mos. now and have added a pinch more salt and a touch of lemon juice for a more mayo flavor. I used a food processor and mix everything but the oil for a good minute or two, then I place a plastic cup with a small hole in the bottom in the hopper and let the EVOO go very very very slow for at least 15 minutes. Excellent.

I really was excited to try this recipe.  We are trying to cut out processed foods and I was anxious to ditch the store-bought stuff.  I followed this recipe exactly and, while the texture was PERFECT, the taste was not - all I could taste was oil, and my oil was fresh.  It definitely needed more salt and some more tang... the flavor, for me, was almost non-existent.  I made the recipe again only added in some lemon juice, but it still wasn't right.  This is my first attempt at homemade mayo and I have no idea how to achieve the store-bought flavor I'm used to.  Maybe a good base recipe to play around with, but I haven't found what I'm looking for yet.

Great mayo!!  Made with safflower oil and used a paper cup with a hole in it to drizzle the oil into the blender.  I think a stick blender might work better as I had to stop the blender twice to remove air pockets that were preventing the steady blending process.  I will definitely try adding garlic and different herbs/spices to this recipe -- this should be a great aioli base.  Thanks!  I don't think I'll ever buy mayo again.

Thank you for submitting this recipe. I have made it several times and it turns out well.  I found that using 1/2 teaspoon of sugar rounds out the flavor nicely but I don't always use it. It will not make it sweet at all nor does it make it taste like the popular miracle whip-just mayo.  Update-I did not have the full 2 C of oil the last time I made this so used 1/2c of EVOO to make the full 2 C  and it tasted fine. Some have said not to use all OO so I thought others would like to know it was fine. It does change the flavor but not enough to be bitter or otherwise off flavored.  I thought it was pleasant and would not hessitate to do it again.

I tried making it by hand, and it didnt turn out so well. So I threw the mix in the food processor and it thickened up in seconds.  I also added a few chipotle peppers, and this was the best mayo ever. My husband loved it.

Reading all of the other great reviews, I can't help but think I must have done something wrong. But I'm positive I followed the recipe exactly...

I used an immersion blender and made sure to add the oil slowly, and the texture is perfect. No problems with that. But the taste was really plain and a little oily. I think it needs a bit more tang, maybe, to taste like store bought mayo.

I'll try making it again, but with apple vinegar or lemon juice instead of white vinegar, and maybe real mustard instead of mustard powder.

It's a simple recipe. I used corn oil instead because that's what I had at home. I followed the tips by adding the oil in a very, very slow drizzle. However, in my first batch it was liquidy/soupy/thin. I think it was because I tried to force the full 2 cups of oil in when it was thick already. 

For my second batch, I only used 1.5 cups oils, when it was thick enough I stopped adding oil. I'm thinking because my eggs are super small so I don't need as much oil. 

Next time I'll try grapeseed oil instead since I've read it won't taste as greasy and it's healthier. Also, I'll halve the recipe to make small batches since I don't eat mayo that often. Probably completely obvious that I should have done that the first time around... but I didn't.

I love this recipe!  It is so easy and much tastier than store-bought mayo.  I tried to use canola oil instead of vegetable oil, but it came out runny every time.  I just stick to the vegetable oil.
