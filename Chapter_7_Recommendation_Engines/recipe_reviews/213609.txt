This was delicious.  Substituted 2 cans of lump crab meat for imitation and added an extra 1/2 cup of italian cheese blend with additional milk to get it the right texture.  Also, used a fat-free half and half to save on some of the calories.  So good!

I have been making a non-dairy version of this for years.  Saute sliced red onion, 1-2 serrano peppers (to taste) julienne any veg u would like, add 2 wine glasses of white wine, the juice of 1 lemon, salt & pepper and reduce to about half.  Add crab meat and a large handful of chopped herbs - coriander/basil/thyme work great.  Add cooked pasta, toss and enjoy!

I don't normally make any changes to a recipe the first time I make it , but I had some imitation crab that need to be used up, and I didn't feel like going to the shops (to much snow). Soooo I had to used evaporated milk instead of cream and had no swiss cheese so  used a bit of brie, cheddar, and goat cheese. Excellent and so easy, a keeper for sure.  Thanks for sharing will make to recipe next time.

This recipe is the bomb. I have made this several times and everyone just loves this. Easy to double for a large crowd and a splash of milk/cream to reheat in the microwave. The guys go nuts and everyone shows up for dinner when I make this-Thanks for sharing and a perfect recipe just as is.

This was absolutely delicious!  My husband doesn't normally like sea food, but he LOVED this dish.  I will definitely make it again.  Super cheap to make, too!  I doubled the recipe and it fed out family of 7 with some to spare :)

Really good!!  I had my doubts about using imitation crab, but the flavor was tremendous.  Followed the recipe to a 't', wouldn't change a thing.  Next time I'll add a spinach salad and garlic bread to the meal.

I did highly enjoy this recipe as is. I took another user's review to use fat free half and half which made such a runny sauce I would not suggest taking anyone's suggestions here and just follow the directions on this one.

I used 3 or 4  cloves of fresh garlic(minced) and vegetable bullion. I also added frozen red, green,  and yellow bell peppers(I put that in the pan first for like 3 or 4 minutes) and only 1 cup of water.  ummm...I also used a whole stick of unsalted butter(savage)!
EVERYTHING KOSHER!   
I DO IT FOR THE CULTURE!
SQUAD!
GANG! GANG!

I did this exactly by the recipe with the exception of using real crab- I loved how easy it was to make!   That being said, I just didn't get any real flavor from the sauce, just the overwhelming seafood taste.  It's nice when each element can be savored in and of itself.  I also found the sauce to be too thin to really cling to the pasta when eating.  So, I loved the ease of the recipe and I'm sure it is delightful for many people- it just wasn't the right match for us.

Made this for Valentine's day because that's what my wife wanted. Used real crab lump meat and half and half instead added tomatoes and red pepper and red onion. Used angel hair pasta instead because my wife likes it. Easy to make

Yummy.  I baked mine and thought of it as a variation on tuna casserole.  Made a roux by adding flour to the sauteed onion/butter in the pan.  Then I subbed a few ingredients due to what I had on hand.  Used 1 15 oz. can chicken broth.  Used 4 oz. cream cheese instead of the heavy cream.  Used angel  hair instead of the linguine.  Added some freshly grated parmesan and 1 cup of frozen green peas. The peas and the red edges on the krab make it pretty.  Baked for 35 minutes at 350.  Thank you to the submitter of this recipe for the inspiration.  Previously, I had only used krab in salad or quiche.

I added fresh peas at the end (blanched first). Gave it a nice crunchy layer. I get asked for this often.

This is the first recipe I have ever been inspired to review...it is a very simple and delicious recipe! The only alteration I made was adding some green pepper slices. This was tasty right after I made it and the leftovers were also yummy the next day. Thank you so much for sharing- I will definitely be making this again!

This was very good and easy. I reduced it by quite a bit and then ended up adding corn starch at the end to thicken it up. And it was still very runny for a sauce. Next time I'd use a lot less water initially so I don't have to boil so much off.
