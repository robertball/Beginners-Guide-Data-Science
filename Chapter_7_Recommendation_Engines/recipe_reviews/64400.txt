This is a 10 star recipe!  I use yellow summer squash and zucchini together and do not peel or seed either. I do find it necessary to bake it about 40 minutes total to get the cheese brown  Thanks Representin and Noreen's Mom for this great dish.

I used zucchini and yellow squash; they don't require seeding. This was only OK. Kinda bland. I added some "Pasta Sprinkle" seasoning (oregano, parsley, etc.) to boost it up some but it needs something more. I think it can be worked into something better--maybe some buttered breadcrumbs on top.

I would not waste my time on this recipe again.  It was bland and even after cooking longer in the oven, the yellow squash were not done to my taste.  It needs some spicing up or another kind of cheese.  Good luck.

Really good flavor.  I used zucchini and melted a little butter to mix with bread crumbs and sprinkled on top.  At first I thought it looked a little watery, but the flavor was very good. My family enjoyed it, something I would make again!

I made this with zucchini and summer squash and added fresh chives & tarragon for extra flavor and did it in 2 layerswith the cheese between each layer as well as on top. It came out very tasty and it was very well liked at a dinner I took it to.

Super easy and super good. I had no Swiss cheese. Only had very sharp cheddar. Took another's advice and added some fresh garlic and tarragon. Also added three dashes of cayenne pepper for a tad of heat. Result was a really good, tangy, flavor-full side dish that received rave reviews from me AND from my neighbors.

I did not have Swiss cheese the night I made this; so I used a combo of Monterrey jack and pepper jack. Added homemade breadcrumbs on top. This was a great easy, and relatively healthy side dish. Thank you/ P

A quick and tasty side dish! I followed the recipe as written, and we really enjoyed it. You could also easily switch it up a little by adding more seasonings or changing the cheese.
