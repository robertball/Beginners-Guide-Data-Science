The ricotta sauce is fabulous!  I went with another reviewer and added red sauce underneath.  Before cooking the chicken, I shook on some garlic powder, Italian seasonining, and Spike spice blend.  I sauteed fresh sliced mushrooms and diced onions with a crushed clove of garlic.  Two crushed cloves in the ricotta sauce and voila - lots of flavor!  I left out the broccoli b/c I didn't have any, but will add that next time.  DH says it's the best pizza I've made AND that it was better than our go-to pizza place.  High praise - thank you so much!

yummy and quick :-) used refrigerated pillsbury pizza dough, brushed with olive oil, and prebaked for 5 min to keep crust from getting soggy. baked the chicken, and used a half package of frozen spinach (thawed and squeezed) instead of broccoli. the ricotta cheese sauce was great and it all turned out delicious!

Very good recipe. You can mix the ricotta cheese/butter with just about any herb or spice. I used a blend of garlic powder, green peppercorns, shallots, marjoram and thyme. I also used fresh mozzarella. Use a pizza rack to avoid the crust getting soggy (the broccoli adds a bit of moisture when it thaws). Excellent recipe for a lovely weekday dinner.

This is fast and tastes great. I left out the butter and used cooked shrimp and parm cheese for toppings. Two thumbs up!

Since I cannot eat broccoli (despite my love for it), I replaced it with sliced onion and bell peppers (green, red and yellow).  It made the pizza much more colorful and tasty.  This is a fantastic recipe as long as you have a really good pizza crust.

This was easy and very good.  I grilled the chicken breast, which made it even better.  Also, I used fresh garlic instead of powder, and added some fresh herbs.  I will definately make this again.  Thanks!

This is really good and very rich.  I probably doubled or even tripled the broccoli, but I love broccoli!

Easy to make but we thought it had a bland flavor.  Perhaps it was because I used fat-free ricotta but overall I thought this could use more seasoning, although I'm not sure what I'd add.  I used minced garlic instead of garlic powder and low fat Fleishman's instead of real butter.  I also use a homemade pizza crust instead of packaged. The white sauce mixed easily and made more than enough to spread on the crust but the end result lacked flavor.

This was pretty good, but I felt like it still needed some tomato sauce.  I added fresh tomatoes and basil from my garden (YUM) and it's important to only use broccoli florets (not the stems).  I'm going to add spinach next time like a previous user to make it even healther...and a thin layer of pizza sauce beneath the ricotta.  The ricotta was good, I just might use less of it next time for a thin layer.  The mozz. on top was yummy, and the chicken, tomato (my addition) and broccoli combo was so good.  A pretty healthy pizza - I used a whole wheat crust as well.  Pretty good and will review again after I make those modifications next time.  :)

Very good and easy. Made it exactly like the recipe said to and loved it. Everyone that said it was bland must not have ever had white pizza before! It was delicious, and I'll definitely make this again.

A great way to utilize leftover ricotta cheese. Our family thought that the amount of ricotta was too much and decided that we will reduce it by about half the amount next time. The combination of the broccoli, mushrooms (we saut√©ed our own) and chicken was delicious!
