Aside from being really cute, this is a darn good deviled egg recipe. I only made 3 of the 'chicks', thinking they would be difficult to mkae but not at all! Just make sure you don't cut too close to the top of the egg or it tears up when you remove the yolk. I do think thsee would be inconvenient to eat so they are probably best used as a garnish. I used most of the filling in the typical deviled eggs, sprinkling them w/ some paprika & real bacon bits. Thansk for the recipe!

Great recipe and EXCELLENT decors (OMG they are awesome).  I did however tweaked the recipe by adding turmeric (1/8 tsp) for additional color, dash or two of red chili pepper and topped the little devils with paprika and chopped parsley.  Thank you very much for sharing this GREAT recipe.

try chilling the eggs after cooking them so they are firmer and less liable to break or fall apart. i used the olives for eyes and pimento for nose.. just a little creative slicing.

Cute idea....but not that easy to get to the end result...I love the flavor but we all agreed...don't like the shredded Parmesan cheese..I feel much better if it was grated. Now word of advice...cut the eggs in a zig zag more to the center of the egg because of the yolk. I can't tell you that it was hit and miss trying to dig out the yolk with out breaking the egg into pieces...SO I only got a few good chicks out of the whole batch and ended up boiling more. But end result they were cute, flavor was good, liked the fuse of curry in the mixture. I'd see making it again. With adjustments. Thanks though.

I did half a recipe to test this out. I found the procedure to be a little tedious. The eggs have to be cut just right for yolk to come out easily. I had to go a little lower than 1/3 down on the ones that worked. And, the filling had to be set just right to get the olives to lay correctly. I am not a fan of curry powder but used it because I thought it was meant for coloring. I think they would have been better leaving out the curry powder and parmesan cheese as it gives it a slightly odd texture. I don't normally buy stuffed green olives and couldn't find anything smaller than a 7 oz jar for the few needed, unfortunately. Of the 3 that turned out they were cute! It was fun to try but would be too much work to take to a party. My advice for success at these overall: is use the same filling you use for your favorite deviled eggs and cut the pattern slightly lower than 1/3 down and these will work out perfectly!

These turned out really cute.  However, cutting the zig zags and getting the yolks out without breaking the egg whites was not easy, and was much more time consuming than most deviled egg recipes.    Everybody oooohed and aaahed at Easter over how cute they were.

Very cute.  I made 3 test chicks to see how hard they were to make.  I ruined one.  But that was getting the shell off of the egg.  It was a little hard to get the cooked yolk out w/o splitting the egg, so I used a shrimp fork and I was more successful @ scooping out the yolk. Just too cute for words.  I am bringing these to Easter dinner.

This was so easy to make and my grandaughters loved them, even the adults were impressed. Each cute little chick turns out with a different look.  What a great touch for Easter, it looks like you really put out a special effort for such a great family gathering.

The recipe is good and makes an adorable presentation.  I did them as owls for Halloween and my coworkers were impressed.  Only change I made was leaving out the parmesan--me, an Italian--because I tried it once with the cheese and hubby didn't care for them that way.

My mom and I made these for Easter and they were very cute. We used the piece cut from the bottom of the egg - and cut smaller circles to use as eyes and colored them blue. We also used black olives.  Very festive.  Will probably use again next year.  Thanks for the cute idea!

Very good recipe, I only made one of the chicks and cut the rest of my eggs in the normal way. they tasted great and the one chick egg was placed in the center of my serving tray and worked GREAT when I placed plastic wrap over my dish, it was taller and kept the plastic from sticking to the regular eggs. From now on I will make at least one chick for the center.

I didn't have any curry so that was the only thing I didn't follow.  These eggs tasted great and everyone loved that I tried to make chicks.  It's not difficult but I'm not a professional and they looked like my 5 yr old grandson made them.

I made these chicks using the bacon cheddar deviled egg recipe and they turned out really cute. A lot of effort though. It took me almost 2 hours and I ruined 2.

I like the idea of this. I don't like a bunch of different ingredients in my Deviled Egg mixure, so I made that the way I like it, simple. But I got a HOOT out of the chicks. Didn't have green olives, so used black, and I didn't have red peppers,carrots ,palmentos, so I used chesse for the beak. This was kind of a last miniute idea. There a lot of fun. My grand kids thought they were cute also.

Very very cute. Made these for Easter '07 and the kids thought they were so fun! I'm not a deviled egg lover, so I didn't partake, but my husband thought it needed a little something more... Not sure, but will keep trying. Great idea though!

To all who had trouble cutting the eggs I have found a very simple solution that works wonders. I sliced the egg 1/3 way down from the narrow end.  Took it apart and took the yolks out.  I then used small scissors and cut the zig-zag pattern on each top.  So easy and they don't fall apart.  I also used peppercorns for the eyes and red pepper for the beak.

How cute are these little chicks??? And they are absolutely delicious too! The curry powder and the parmesan cheese add such wonderful flavor to your average deviled egg! They take some work, but worth every second. They bring a smile to your face and to your taste buds! Thank you for this creative a delightful recipe!

The eggs are very cute...but you must like curry. These were not popular with my family. In the future, I would make a traditional recipe for the egg yolks, and cute hte eggs into the chicks.

I just attempted to make these and had a really hard time getting the eggs cut out into the zig-zags - I tried it the way the recipe said and the eggs kept splitting.  I got two cute chicks and the rest were plain old deviled eggs - they are DELICIOUS though.  Love the recipe for the filling.  I'll try again when I have more time and patience.  Edited 3/23 - I was the only one who liked the curry at Easter.  I'm still giving it four stars for presentation and *I* liked them - so there.

So cute!! it's a funny way of serving those yummy deviled eggs, since you can add different ingredients to your filling. Just make sure you let them sit in the fridge for at least an hour before serving.

love the idea....didn't turn out quite as perfect as the picture however.  it wasn't terribly time consuming to make them, but i think my olives were too big, making the chicks faces look just bizarre! :)  as for the egg recipe, it was a nice change, but i think we all agreed we prefer it without the curry powder.  just the mayo, dry mustard powder, sprinkle of paprika version is what we grew up with and i think the simplicity rules in this case.  thanks for posting!

Would like to try the presentation at some point, but just made as regular deviled eggs and liked the flavor.

I made these eggs for a party where everyone who attended is a deviled egg connoisseur.  Five stars for the taste and texture of the filling, I subtracted one start because I wasted three whole eggs trying to figure out how to cut the top off just right.  I ended up cutting the top off diagonally which worked out well and allowed me enough room to remove and fill the yoke section of the hollowed egg without incident.

I will make these again.
