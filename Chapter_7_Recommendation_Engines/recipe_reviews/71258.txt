I made a vegetarian version - I omitted the tuna, added more of the artichoke and sun-dried tomatoes, and used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  I loved it, and this recipe will be one of my favorites.

A great way to serve tuna (I used canned and it sure beats the regular sandwhiches.) The lemon flavor was in good proportion to the other flavors.  Overall, a flavorful dish but a bit too much work for the outcome in my opinion.  This took me a long time to prepare.  In step three, leave more liquid than 3/4 cup; I thought the sauce was a bit too pasty.  Also note that if you use dried thyme you should use only 1/3 what is called for.  (This is the standard fresh-to-dried ratio for herbs.)

This was really good...and lent itself well to major changes.  First off, I didn't have tuna, so I used chicken instead.  I also added spinach that I cut into chiffonade.  I didn't have a fresh lemon, so just used bottled lemon juice.  Maybe next time I'll follow the recipe!

We loved this! The only change I made was to grill the tuna on my indoor grill and add 2-3 T. butter to the sauce at the end just to give it a bit of richness. We'll have this often I'm sure.

I admit it, I usually leave out the tuna and just enjoy the pasta.  It's fantastic!

Soooo good!  I used chicken breast instead of tuna (don't like tuna), used a whole onion, added mushrooms, and used a heaping 1 cup of sundried tomatoes (we love them).  I also mined some cloves of garlic and cooked with the onions.  In addition to the thyme I used some oregano, italian seaoning, rosemary, and basil about 1 tsp. each.  I love this recipe, I can't wait to make it again!

Delicious! That's all I can say for this recipe. My husband and I love spicy food so we sprinkled some chilli flakes on it and it was even more delicious.

I really liked the flavor of this dish but next time I'll decrease the amount of pasta or increase the artichoke and sun dried tomatoes.  We'll be making this again.

Excellent!  It took a little longer to reduce the sauce to an acceptable level.  Followed the recipe and it was great.

This is a nice pasta dish, but a bit time intensive and uses a lot of dishes to make.  I used ravioli instead of linguine.  I'm inclined to agree that linguine is better--as in lighter--in this, but I had ravioli I needed to use up, and it worked well with the flavors in this.  I left out the white wine and used 1/2 c extra of chicken broth to keep the same liquid amounts.  I'd have loved to use the wine but bf won't eat dishes with wine (except, oddly, chicken marsala), so I had to compromise on that.  Although the broth does look too thin before adding the pasta, once you do so, it works well enough. I used nowhere near the amount of oil called for; the artichokes and sun dried tomato added more oil and it's only necessary to slightly coat the pan with oil initially--definitely more than enough.  I did use tuna but I think it would work equally well with chicken or pork (obviously cooked longer!) or without any protein at all.  I served with salad and toasted bread and it was a substantial and filling lunch.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a really yummy meal.  I made a few changes based on the ingredients I had in my cupboard as well as personal taste.  I sauted the onions in garlic and butter before adding the thyme.  I used canned tuna instead of a tuna steak.  I added spinach instead of artichoke hearts and at the end I added feta cheese which added a creaminess to the sauce.  All in all a really tasty meal.

Quite tasty. I served this over whole wheat pasta and it was a very light hot weather meal. I used frozen artichoke hearts instead of the marianted ones and didn't use any olive oil. I do think when I reheat the leftover tonight, I'll add some shredded zucchini or spinach. It was just crying out for another veggie I think!

The artichokes in my cupboard were sadly expired so I omitted them but will definitely add them next time.  This recipe was simple and straightforward with loads of flavors.  It will definitely be made again in my house, next time WITH the artichokes.   As a vegetarian, I left out the tuna.  The dish was still delightful.

I had high hopes for this recipe. All of the ingredients sounded so good together, but it just didn't seem to really come together. There's too much liquid for one thing. Maybe if it was saucier it would have helped. I added garlic and I think adding A LOT of Parmesan would have tied the dish together, but for the cost of the fish and how sour the whole dish is, it's just not really worth it. It's too acidic. Sorry...Probably won't make this again.

This is very good. In spite of the rather fussy introduction and directions, this is a very easy dish to make. Upscale tuna helper! Thanks for the recipe!

this recipe was a great helper, i kind of just took the basics of it and went from there.  I added more of each to feed a lot and add some garlic into (i'm italian and i can't get enough of it) and used shrimp instead of tuna. it was soooo good, my whole family loved it!

I have made this once using salmon and once using grouper.  Salmon is better as it is a stronger tasting fish to work with the other ingredients.

Pretty delicious. Didn't have chicken broth so I substituted some water with a little cornstarch, seasoning salt, and a bit of extra olive oil. Turned out fine.

I added mushrooms and garlic and I cooked the tuna under the broiler.  This was a hit with my family.  I will probably thicken the sauce next time though.

I don’t think this was anything worth keeping. I made with chicken.  I would imagine it would be terrible with tuna. This recipe is too much work that doesn’t pay off at the end. Not a keeper.

I didn't have sun dried tomatoes so I added 1 can of V8 and used diced tomatoes.  Instead of the wine I used 1/2 cup of Vodka.  It was delicious!  I had enough to eat, freeze and gave some away to friends and they all loved it too.

This was amazing! Great light, tangy flavor without being too overpowering. Next time I will leave out the sun dried tomatoes, I wasn't a fan. Also, I used veggie broth instead of chicken stock. Wonderful!

This was ok.  For me it's one of those wonderful recipes that I can "wing".  I used canned tuna, Orzo pasta, added tbsp of butter after orzo added to sauce and tossed then topped with toasted pine nuts.  I sprinkled with a little parsley.  For me it needed something green. Maybe at the very end (when just off the heat) toss in some fresh spinach that way it's warm yet not wilted.

Made this but excluded the pasta.  It was "okay", but probably will not do it again.  I did kick it up a bit with garlic chile hot sauce.  That helped.

I really liked this and so did the rest of my family. Couple changes that I did was add one clove garlic and some mushrooms. I also didn't have white wine so used sherry. It was great. I actually think I would like this with tofu instead of tuna. I did use tuna steaks but they were dry as usual for tuna. I tried not to over cook the tuna but it was still dry. Next time I'll try tofu though my kids will complain. Haha.

Even more delicious than anticipated!  I added a few extra spices per other users such as basil, oregano, and minced garlic.  I also used 2 cans of albacore tuna instead of tuna steaks.  I will definitely be making this again.

I didn't have tuna on hand so I made a slightly different, more "seafoody" version of this dish. I substituted the tuna for Basa fish I had in my freezer and I added a can of baby clams at the end. Instead of the chicken broth I used the clam juice from the can, it added a much different flavour but it was so tasty! 
I didn't have fresh Thyme either but basil went awesome with it instead. Next time I'm making it with mushrooms.

I used shallots instead of onion, added garlic to the shallots in first step, added mushrooms and asparagus with artichokes and sun dried tomatoes. Was very good and substituted tuna for chicken cutlets which were very very juicy and tender. Very good will make again many times.

It was okay- but rather expensive for what you made, and honestly, not that great for what you end up paying for it and the time that you put into it.  We won't make it again.

I thought this recipe was amazing! It was one of the best things I have ever cooked :) I totally recommend this recipe :)
And also... I used canned tuna... and I am a college student
so it is easy to make and not too expensive.
I also subistuted sun dried tomatoes for mushrooms.
