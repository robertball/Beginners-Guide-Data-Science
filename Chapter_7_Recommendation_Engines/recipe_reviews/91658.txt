Used fresh pearl onions for this -- at least I think that's what they were. Cheap at produce market, pain to peel for recipe, but all worth it. This recipe is so simple and delish. Made me feel like a pro. Got great reviews. Reminded me of "Drunken Shallots" I had had at a favorite local Italian restaurant (although, I think those used a red wine reduction). Planning on making the full recipe from frozen onions for a camping trip this weekend. Such an easy snack to put out with some white bean spread (also easy and both not bad nutrition-wise). Highly recommend this recipe. Be patient with the reduction. It's worth it to let it get thick.

Very simple and delicious. I like this better than traditionally caramelized onions because it eliminates the slicing and the stirring (and the tears!). It took an extra 10 minutes in my oven to fully cook. Also, although the balsamic glaze is good, we preferred the onions without it. The glaze masked too much of the onion taste, which we love.

I made this a little differently. After reading other recipes, I sliced up onions and put them in a skillet with the sauce ingredients. When caramelized, I did what they did in the recipe for "Green Beans with Caramelized Onions" and added frozen green beans, that were thawed. Just to make it even better, when serving, I tossed in some cooked bacon pieces. Fantastic !!

Just OK for us--the sauce overpowered the mild onions.

We loved these! Although I didn't use the glaze ...I made a glazed salmon dish ( Super Grilled Salmon from this site) & used the glaze from it on the onions. It was wonderful! Thansk for another tasty recipe Pam!

I was afraid the balsamic glaze would overpower the onions but that did not happen.  In fact, the leftovers are even better the next day because the glaze mellowed out.

We didn't care for it. But will give it one more shot with out the balsalmic eventually when we are feeling brave.

This turned out nicely. I usually make a much more complicated version that takes 2 hours to make. The taste is comparable and is a lot easier. i will make this again. The key here is a really good balsamic vinegar. I used a fig balsamic for my reduction.

I tried these for Thanksgiving this year.  I used the fresh pearl onions and blanched them to peel.  Next time... frozen all the way! The family (who are adults, teens and historically not onion lovers) loved these and have asked me to make them every year from now on.

Made 1/4 of this recipe to have as a side dish for leftover meatloaf for lunch.  I think this recipe as is is quite pungent.  The balsamic is overpowering but what do you expect from the recipe.  I cannot imagine it as a full fledged side dish (like green beans) but it is a nice change of pace.  Thanks!
