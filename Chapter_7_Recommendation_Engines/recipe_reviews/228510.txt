I was bothered by the amount of calories in each muffin. So this is what I did. I took out the oil and put in Greek yogurt 5 oz.  I also used egg substitute for the eggs, and only used half of the brown sugar. I did not drain my pineapple. They turned out fantastic.You can cut the calories in half.. My husband said yummy!!!!

I only made one small change--I cut the amount of brown sugar in half. I also used homemade spiced applesauce in this recipe.  I got 12 really big muffins out of one recipe. Baked at 350*, these were done at 22 minutes. They not only smelled amazing while baking, they tasted incredible. One of the best muffins this family has had in a long time. DELICIOUS!

This is a great muffin for breakfast, filled with lots of fruit and fiber.  I followed the recipe exactly, and for me, 3/4 pound of shredded carrots yielded 2 1/2 cups.  I loved the tangy brightness of the dried cranberries.  There are lots of variations of this recipe, so it's easy to use what you have!

We really enjoyed these muffins, I did substitute the veg oil with coconut oil and did not use pecans due to allergies, I made a double batch and ended up with 36 muffins (we are happy about that) we also used unsweetened coconut and you couldn't even tell! These muffins did take 30 minutes to bake and they were a bit heavy when they were finished but we love them..... These are going to be a good quick breakfast for the kids in the morning and healthier than a bowl of cereal!

So GOOD!! I made these muffins 2 days in a row, a little different each time. Used 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour and no white flour. only one carrot, that's all we had. and only 1 teaspoon of cinnamon so it wasn't too much spice for anyone. but even with different variations, these turned out amazing both times!! The pineapple is delish. the only thing I'd really change is the time, it only took about 25 mins for ours to finish. My son learned the word "muffin" after asking for these over and over. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Wow, you gotta make these muffins.  These are the best muffins I've ever had.  Moist and addictive. I made them for my kids and ate almost all of them myself.  I added choco. chips, reduced the sugar and oil and the recipe doesn't suffer at all.

I'm on a high fiber diet and these muffins are perfect. My whole family loves them. I've made them twice. The first time I shredded the carrots myself, the second time I bought the carrots pre-shredded. They are still good with the pre-shredded carrots, but they are slightly more moist if you shred the carrots yourself. I love to see my kids eating something they enjoy that's actually healthy for them.

These rival those sold at a local bakery, fantastic breakfast muffin. I used Spleda's brown sugar blend and 1/2 the carrots (all I had) otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. They turned out terrific!  My batch turned out a little over 18 muffins ( a level ice cream scoop in each) and were done in 28 minutes.  Try this recipe, you will be a hero while sneaking some healthy food onto the table.

Love this!   I used coconut palm sugar,  a gala apple, egg beaters,  1/4 cup of pecans,  1/2 cup of cranberries and No Sugar added applesauce.  

Turned out beautifully.  I got 17 muffins.  (just shy of 1/2 cup batter per muffin).
Baked for exactly 35 min.  Heated oven to 350 for 15 min. 
With these small changes  the calories come to 236 per muffin (17 muffins)

I didn't have any flaxseed so substituted chia seeds, used pineapple pieces which gives more flavour and used only 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup of yoghurt. These will definitely be a regular in the freezer.

OH. MY. GOD. These are the best thing I've eaten in a long time!  I omitted the pineapple and added a little allspice and nutmeg, and they were done in 25 minutes.  I got 16 big muffins.

Moist, dense, and full of good for you things!  Delicious!  Makes a great mid morning snack.  I baked small muffins instead of large ones and just cut the baking time down.  I froze half of them and they were just as delicious when thawed.

I've made these several times. Always a big hit. It makes 12 VERY LARGE muffins. The first time I made them I was tempted to divide it up between 18 muffins but just loaded up the 12 instead, which gave the muffin the perfect muffin top.

A GO-TO RECIPE! My 2yr old son is picky eater but loves these muffins any time of day.  I love that it has fruits, veggie and flax seed in the recipe. I add in 1/4 cup reconstituted chia seeds for an extra nutritional punch.

This is a very good muffin. Moist, tasty and full of good things. I didn't have coconut or flax seed. No pecans so I used walnuts.I added 1/2 cup of protein powder and only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. I used 21/2 cups of grated carrot. I never add salt.Doubled the recipe and got  22 muffins. Baked for 26 minutes. Thanks for sharing this. I will make these often.

We love these muffins.  I have made a few changes so that I could make them without going shopping.  I use unsweetened coconut, substitute oat or wheat bran for the ground flax seed & use any kind of apple that I have.  And I usually get 20 muffins from this recipe.

Overall my family thought theses were good muffins.  I did make quite a few changes, but when you bake as much as I do you learn which changes you can make and still end up with an acceptable result.  I used all white whole wheat flour. 
 I only added about 1 1/2 cups of carrots that I shredded simply because that is what I had.  I finely chopped some fresh pineapple that I had in the frig, and I switched out raisins for the cranberries since my son doesn't like them.  I also didn't add nuts because none of us like them.  I followed other reviewers and cut the sugar in half since I wanted a healthier muffin.  I kept  the canola oil amount as written, but next time I might cut that in half also.  I will make these again but I didn't care for the pineapple so I will leave that out and I will try to add the full amount of carrots.  I used a regular sized 12 count muffin tin with paper liners, filled them 3/4 full and got 25 muffins total with a bake time of 24 minutes.  To sum up, these are lite,  moist, muffins that seem to be very adaptable to different add-ins.  I liked them better the next morning as they weren't as crumbly.

Wonderful recipe! My husband and I loved them. Super easy to make, and a wonderful grab-n-go morning breakfast. I only changed two things. I used 3/4 brown sugar instead of a full cup and a cup and a half of whole wheat flour. I did not use any all purpose flour. They turned out incredible. Very big muffins too! Highly recomended.

I thought these were good. I didn't have pineapple or flaxseed, and my husband is allergic to nuts, but they were still tasty. The only thing I didn't like was that they were a little too moist for me, but the flaxseed and nuts might have helped with that.

These were delicious. I probably won't make them again just because they were time-consuming. I added oatmeal for some of the flour and I think it added a lot to the texture and taste.  I made some with craisins and some without. Even though I like craisins, I liked the muffins better without them.

Halved the sugar as others suggested, subbed melted coconut oil for vegetable oil, left out pecans, and left the other ingredients the same. To make it easier I shredded half a bag of baby carrots in the food processor. I made these as mini muffins and cooked them for about 15 minutes. They were a hit with my very picky toddler and I actually feel good about him eating them! I thought they were tasty too :)

My favorite muffin recipe! I use less sugar (1/4 to 1/2 cup less). Regular sized muffins are done in 18-20 minutes. I have also subbed chia seed for the flax seed, and raisins for the cranberries, depending on what I have on hand. If I'm baking for someone who doesn't love nuts, I grind them finely with a food processor. I keep these in the freezer, and microwave one for 30 seconds for a quick breakfast. So yummy!

This is so tasty. I made a few changes. I used raisins because I don’t keep dried cranberries on hand, Splenda brown sugar blend, 1/2 cup of almond flour in place of 1/2 the all-purpose flour, I didn’t drain the pineapple, I substituted no sugar added apple butter for 1/2 the oil and I added pumpkin seeds in place of nuts because I wanted to use them up. The apple butter gave a nice hint of spice along with the cinnamon. This recipe is a keeper.

GOOD muffins. Lots of ing. in them but things usually on hand.
I did not have apple , so extra applesauce,  plus, can of crushed pineapple 14 oz. not 16 so extra oil. Just a touch. Grocery store shredded carrots just fine. Everything else the same.
I doubled,  41 muffins,,plus , does not need 35 minutes 
to bake.

These are delicious!  I cut the sugar in half and only used 1/4 cup of oil (made it up with the juice from the pineapple).  Otherwise, I went by the recipe; it made 18 regular sized muffins for me.  I'm sure I didn't use as much carrot as called for; I just shredded up a very large carrot that I had in the frig.  I will be making these often and putting them in the freezer for quick breakfasts or snacks.

I followed the directions except for carrots. I only had one large, got 1 cup. So I added more coconut. These are the best muffins I  have ever made and I am 65.I wasn't sure about the combination but should have known they would be great! Would say that the only thing I would do differently is add a little more cinnamon. Will def. make a lot!

Hubby said the best muffins I ever made! I happened to have all the ingredients already so on a early morning whim I made them. I swapped out 1 cup of flour and used 1 cup steel cut oats powdered up in a ninja to make it even healthier. OMG what a way to start the new year! I've been searching for a good recipe for these since our 100 year old bakery closed in town.

So moist and yummy. I used coconut oil equivalent instead of vegetable oil. Didn't have pineapple so I used 1 c. Canned pumpkin, lots of vitamin C there. Added 1tsp. pumpkin pie spice to the cinnamon serving. Used half cup whole wheat flour plus half cup almond meal.

This recipe is really delicious and forgiving. I always add extras like almonds, pumpkin seeds, raisins and other combos.  Also no need for doubling, it makes a large amount. But if you do double, the batter freezes well and is ready to go in the oven for the next batch.

Great recipe! Surprisingly, I had all the ingredients at hand. I made these according to the recipe. The only change was to reduce the baking time. I used the toothpick test and they were done at 25 minutes. There was too much batter for 12 muffins so I put the extra batter into two mini loaf pans.  These muffins were very moist and delicious but did not rise much. I will make them again and try to use a little baking powder to get more rise out them. Taste-wise, these were perfect.

These were delicious! Only made a few changes based on what was in my kitchen- no whole wheat flour or flax seed. I also substituted the oil with a half cup of orange juice. Yummy! I thought they were packed with flavor and very sweet. I might even cut down on the sugar next time. Definitely going to make them again- my husband and office mates LOVED them and everyone complimented on how moist and flavorful they were. Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe made 24 regular size muffins.

I substituted fruit cocktail for the pineapple but should have drained it as they were too moist. They stuck to the paper muffin liners. I would add baking powder next time as they did not rise very much at all. They were delicious however!

These are great! my husband has one with his morning coffee instead of the fatty pastries at the office.
I tweeked these by adding a scoop of unflavored protein powder, because that doesn't taste that great I increased the cinnamon, added a little more pineapple, coconut, added raisins and replaced the oil with more applesauce. I also replaced the white flour with whole wheat flour. Yummy

It's so nice to hand you child a muffin for breakfast and know you're giving him a nutritious treat. These muffins pack in the flavor. I didn't have flax seed so I used wheat germ instead. I also cut the oil even more by using 1/3 cup oil, 2/3 cup applesauce, and I omitted the nuts. 
The contributor must have jumbo muffin tins because this made me 24 regular-sized muffins.

As so many of us, I don't always have all of the ingredients on hand that the recipe calls for... So I had to improvise. I used about a half cup of agave nectar in place of the cup of brown sugar. I didn't have carrots nor an apple, so I used a whole can of crushed pineapple. (15 oz?). I added a half cup of oats for fiber /texture and just 1.5 cups of flour. I only needed to bake them at 325 for 25 minutes as agave nectar in a recipe browns more quickly. Thank you so much for this delicious morning treat!

I made these muffins and they weren't very good.  My husband didn't like them at all.  They aren't sweet enough.  I have added about 3/4 cup of sugar to see if this will improve the recipe.  I probably won't make them again.

I made these muffins today and they taste delicious. I did not have dried cranberries, instead I used dried cherries that I had in the house. Also I did not have pecans. It did not need them anyway. The muffins already has enough healthy ingredients. I am on a high fiber diet also. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These are awesome muffins. For those people who don't have peanut allergies, you should try peanut oil. I accidently used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil and the muffins were beyond yummy!!!. Gloria

This recipe made 18 regular-size muffins for me. In lieu of pecans or flax seeds, I used a cup of toasted and chopped slivered almonds and added a teaspoon of almond extract. Great!
