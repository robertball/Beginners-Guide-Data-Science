Nothing like the photo. Not what I was expecting at all. I love chili. I love tacos. I love anything creative in this vein. But this just didnâ€™t have a balanced flavor. It was far too soupy to use as a taco. I was hoping for something like the photo included. It was more like a spicy, soupy chili and I would use a different chili recipe if I was going for chili. Sorry.
