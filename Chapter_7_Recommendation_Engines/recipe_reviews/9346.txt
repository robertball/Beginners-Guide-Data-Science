Thank you for this great recipe. I continue to enjoy my leftovers! My suggestions-I think that the oreo cookie crumbs for the crust caused the crust to be gooey (probably a function of the white center). Next time I will use chocolate Teddy Grahams or another plain chocolate cookie to avoid this. Also, the recipe calls for 1 1/2 Cups of cookie crumbs to be added after 1/3 of the batter is ptu in the crust. If you read the instructions however, you should add cookie pieces. This makes a HUGE difference, because the cookie pieces (the bigger the better) are what make this cheesecake so good. It's yummy to bite into a piece of cake and get a cookie surprise. Overall, a great cheesecake. Will add to my recipe book!

Absolutely phenomenal cheesecake recipe!  I had a 9" pan, not 10", so I baked it for 55 minutes (not 45), then for 8 minutes (not 7) once sour cream was put on. I did leave out cinnamon in the crust.  I also put a large stainless steel bowl over the cheesecake once I took it out of the oven (had read that it helped maintain moisture while it cooled) till it was completely cooled. It came out perfect,and just like other reader's attested, was gobbled up by all.  I will make this over and over again.

This is a very good cheesecake..but I need help on what I did that made the cheesecake hard to slice...the chocolate topping was hard to cut through and didn't slice very well..should I have left out some chocolate?  It was very heavy on top!  Also, do you let the cheesecake cool before putting sour cream on?  It was very good and it looked good until I sliced it..Please tell me what I can do to make it easier to slice..THANKS

My husband and his co-workers said this cheesecake was "amazing!"  One even said it was the best dessert he had ever tasted.  Mine didn't look like the one in the picture.  Instead, mine was layered.  The chocolate ganache topping covered all of the top of the cheesecake, about one-quarter inch deep, and made a lovely, neat-looking (smooth) top.  Next was the sweetened sour cream layer.  The texture of the sour cream concerned me at first, because I feared the cheesecake wasn't set, but it turned out it was just the texture of the sour cream.  Even though it was initially concerning to me, everyone else thought it was fantastic, and one of the best details of the cake.  After that was the cheesecake layer, also visually interesting with the cookie pieces inside of it.  Yes, it took three hours to prepare, but made a very large cheesecake that fed quite a few guys that can really eat dessert.  Thank you for a great recipe!  Will definitely save for a special occasion!

Wow! What a great dessert! This is one of the most delicious, rich, and decadent desserts I have ever eaten!!! That said, next time I will NOT add the cinnamon. I only used half the amount the recipe called for, but it still was too obvious and clashed with the flavors of the cheesecake. Also, when adding the sour cream mixture to the top of the cheesecake, be careful not to pour it directly into the center, as I did. This results in a big gob of sour cream mixture sinking into the cheesecake. Despite this, it still turned out magnificent. The chocolate top layer covers up any imperfections, and it truly is bakery/restaurant quality.

I honestly rated this under my mom's name in 2004 but I have used this recipe many times since that time. It is very, very good but can be hard to slice depending on how long you heat the chocolate/cream/vanilla topping. It always helps to take a sharp knife, run it in hot tap water, wipe with a towel and repeat with every slice. It takes 4 8oz packages of cream cheese, please only use Philadelphia Creme Cheese for the best results. I would beat the mixture awhile to get it smooth enough. I have shared this recipe with many people and actually had a person call me for another person whose daughter only asked for this for her birthday, a college student! My son who was 6 when I rated it is now 9 1/2 and still asks for this for his own birthday cake. I had an uncle who said it was as good as the Cheesecake Factory. A good recipe for parties and anytime you want to impress anyone. Here is my original review, I still love it.

This is the FIRST recipe I got from All Recipes. The directions were very easy to follow and the cheesecake is very, very good. My picky 6 yr old loved it and I have so many more friends now and a couple extra pounds too!!

With both chocolate and sour cream frosting, this cheesecake is definitely 'decadent'.  I would, however, recommend doubling the amount of butter it calls for.  Before bringing this cake to a potluck, I chilled it overnight. The next day, I tasted the cheesecake.  It was dryer than I prefer.  But after eating a leftover slice maybe 2 days later, I was surprised that it was so unbelievably rich and creamy with just the right amount of firmness.  So if you plan on making this for someone, I would highly recommend making it days earlier to get optimal cheesecake.  100% Recommended.  =)

Yum!!!  I will definitely be making this cheesecake again! I modified part of the recipe to make it fit into a 9" springform pan.  I used 1 1/2lbs cream cheese, slightly less than 1 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup whipping cream, 1 1/2 T. flour, 3/4 t. vanilla and 3 eggs.  Some tips: Bring the cream cheese and eggs to room temperature before mixing.  Let the cheesecake stand for 5 minutes out of the oven before spreading the sour cream mixture over the top and putting in back in the oven. Leave the cheesecake in the oven for a full hour after you turn the oven off.   Let cheesecake cool completely on the counter before putting it into the fridge.

Indulgence should be enjoyable. This cake is not.

Look at the calorie content, it is completely unnecessary. I didn't notice it until I had already made it and immediately felt guilty about serving it.

I'm all for foregoing calorie counting at the holidays but this is ridiculous and, worse, not worth it.

The coarse, processed sweetness of the cookies is a poor match for the subtle, tangy sweetness of cheesecake. The topping is way too heavy and overpowers the rest of the flavors.

Use low-fat milk in this recipe instead of heavy whipping cream. The latter's just too much. For the topping try a lighter, fudge-like recipe (chocolate and marshmallow cream for example), or at the  very least, half the ingredients. It's too thick otherwise.

What I ate of it I had to dig around the cookies and topping to make it worthwhile. This was the least popular dish at my holiday meal.

I took this to a party with my closest girlfriends, and they all agreed it was good enough to serve in a restaurant, even the Cheesecake Factory! It takes me awhile to make it, but it's worth all the work. Your guests will love it!

Excellent cheescake - everyone raved about it!! The oreo cookie crust was such a nice change from the typical graham cracker crust. I also drizzled a little raspberry syrup on top at the end, to add some fruity flavor. I will definitly be making this dessert for all holidays.

I made this on Sat for a dinner party it was awesome!!! However, i was using 9.5 springfoam pan and the batter was too much I had to leave out the sourcream layer and just did the chocolate topping. Also , I added 1 more tablespoon butter to the crust. Not sure what prev reviewer was talking about regarding the crust being soggy due to the Oreos . I did not have this problem. But I also ground the oreo cookies up really small crumbs with my food processor for the crust and added the butter and sugar to that. 10 oreo = 1 cup cookie crumbs. Besides that it was awesome. I think next time I will use adjust recipe for less people so that it will fit in the pan with the sour cream layer. One final thing, give it the 8hrs to cool, I cut it at a 4.5 hrs and was good , but the next day it was 1000x better .

I'll start by saying two people said this was the best cheesecake they ever had. Another said bakery quality! I didn't add cinnamon to the crust, and I baked it a little longer, about 8 or 9 minutes so it wouldn't be soft and I also used double the butter. Instead of bringing the crust up the sides, I used whole cookies (just one cookie side, with the icing removed) and lined them up along the outside of the pan. Everything else I did to a T, the cheesecake part was a bit brown on the top, I was afraid it would be dry but it tasted perfect, quite creamy. The chocolate ganache went down the sides of my cheesecake so once I got it out of the pan the next morning, I stuck more cookie sides to the outside, they held very well to the ganache. Beware - EVERYTHING sticks to the ganache and will pull it up after it cools, at least for me. Next time I will try to spray a small amount of cooking spray on the top so it doesnt stick to whatever I'm using to cover the cheesecake. I let the cheesecake sit out for about 45 mins prior to cutting it and I had no issues at all with it being difficult to cut. I'm making this again today, and another later this week for someones birthday. This is a fool proof recipe, very easy, although it is time consuming! Best recipe yet on this site. Thanks!!!  BY THE WAY - a super easy way to get the cake out of the pan without ruining your crust, is to set it on your stove burner on low for a minute or two, it warms up the butter in the crust so it slides

Wow! My family LOVED and raved about it but honestly, I impressed myself.  This cheesecake takes some time to complete between cooking, cooling, refrigerating, etc. so you need to plan ahead and make time. But believe me, it is WELL worth it. Made a few changes based on other reviews. (1) Previous reviewer mentioned the crust was "gooey" and they thought it was b/c of the cream filling so I used 1 cup of Oreo cookies as is and a second cup w/o the filling. Then I blended the 2 cups before pressing the crumbs into the pie plate. Worked great. (2) Didn't add cinnamon to the crust. I'm not really sure I would have liked the crust as much if it had been added. (3) Another review mentioned topping the crust with a bowl when cooling to retain moisture and  prevent the crust from cracking. Worked great! (4) Filling with cookie CHUNKS not crumbs. (5) Wasn't sure about the sour cream topping but it was awesome and looks authentic. I suggest keeping this although others opted to use other toppings. (6) Generously drizzled chocolate across the top in both directions which not only looked great but provided just enough chocolate w/o taking away from the taste of the cheesecake. Therefore next time I will only make 1/2 of the chococlate suggested. My family agreed that a full topping of chocolate would have been too much. Made this last week and I'm making it again today for the other side of my family. They have GOT to taste this. WELL worth the time. Thanks for posting!  YUM!!!

Like most, I was skeptical about the sour cream layer and ran out of room. 

I'm surprised everyone is rating 5 stars when they are modifying the recipe.  Omitting the sour cream layer or reducing the recipes for the filling or crust means the recipe is not perfect.  I find it interesting that 50% of the 5-star reviews have alterations.

That being said, I did use a 9 inch pan.  I was happy with the consistency of the filling before the sour cream layer.  Like most, I was out of room but added it, and 7 minutes to bake the sour cream it a little odd to me.  Part of it was firmer and the center was gooey.  I used at most half of the ganache mixture.

I've made cheesecake before and know the basics... but I have to truly say to readers that reading all the reviews is helpful.  

Don't go by all the five star reviews and the few make-as-is claims..  Read up and remember there is a reason why reviewers are altering the recipe or reviewing 5 stars when ALTERING the recipe. 

Cake is very fluffy, sour cream comes out creamy (almost seems raw,but cream and sugar.. what to expect), way too much mixture with all ingredients (16 oz of sour cream is a regular full tub).  I would omit the sour cream and add more butter to crust, reduce filling in order to get ganache on.. and only make half of the ganache.  You can easily save $10 in preparation by not following the recipe and wasting ingredients.

Try before you bring to your parties!

Excellent, Millie Ellis - Thanks for posting it! I read every review (gak!) before deciding to do it just as written, then adjusting it later if needed. Guess what. It isn't needed! The crust needed 20 Oreo cookies (NOT "Double-Stuff"!) and the 2 Tbsp of butter, while seeming a little shy, ended up just right. I used the full tsp of cinnamon was barely noticeable and went well with the rest of the cheesecake. I used a 9" spring-form, but only poured about 3/4 of the filling batter into it, leaving about an inch of space at the top. Even that was a tad too much, as it rose substantially during cooking. There was room for only about 1/3 of the sour cream layer, which is okay by me, because I'm not really fond of it. After the final baking, the whole cake sunk a little (as evidenced by the picture). I did take the ring off before adding the gnocchi, and, since it sunk a little, I did have room for all of it. Had it not sunk a little, the gnocchi would have dribbled down the side, and that would have been fine, too. A hint when making the gnocchi to keep it from getting too hard: Heat the cream until just steaming, remove it from the heat, then whisk in the chocolate chips and vanilla. I had hoped that the cookie chunks layer would have a little crunch left, but it didn't. With the lovely, crunchy crust, I think that I will leave the cookie chunks out next time. The filling's texture was just right and the flavor was wonderful. All in all, a great cheesecake!

Great recipe!!! However, I only used a cup of sugar. Less calories but taste the same! I did ended up using 3 ts of butter though. I also recommand to use a water beth. The cake had no crack at all!!! I do not think it was necessary to have that much of chocolate on the top. Drizzling the chocolate on the top not only made it look prettier, but also had a great balance between the sweetness and the cheesecake flavor! Everyone loved the cake!

This is the first baked cheesecake I have ever attempted. I finally bought a springform pan and it baked perfectly for my first time. No issues with it sticking to the pan,the sides of the pan came right off. I made the recipe exactly as written and I highly recommend this to anyone, it was wonderful. Even the cinnamon in the crust was great so don't skip it, it helps to make this cheesecake as special as it is. Also, 2 pounds of cream cheese equals 4 packages.

WONDERFUL! I used two pre-made graham cracker pie crusts (since I had them on hand) and cooked it a few min less and they BOTH turned out AWESOME! I did have a bit of all the mixtures left, but no biggie. They really did taste store bought. A KEEPER!!

Good recipe, but be prepared for something extremely rich and "intense". I used oreo cookie crumbs for both the crust and the filling. I could personally do without the cinnamon, or the sour cream layer.

So yummy!  Made this for Christmas gifts for friends!!  I read reviews about to add the cinnamon or not, I added the cinnamon on the first one. But after sampling a tiny bit, I could see why people said to leave it out.  It doesn't make it taste bad, just really doesn't compliment the cheesecake...it was just kind of there.  So dropped it for the rest of them I made. I did use 20 Oreo's with the filling AND 3TBSP butter for the crust.  But I did use my hand-cranked food processor to chop them...worked wonderfully and not soggy! I did let my cheesecake sit in the fridge for 2 days before giving them out because it does make the flavor much better as it sits.  It does take a bit of time to make, but well worth every minute!!!

I loved this cheesecake! I didn't do the sour cream top cause it was getting late and I needed to finish up. YUMMY! Will make again. I will up the flour to about 1/4cup to make it thicker. Thanks for the awesome recipe. (also I didnt use the cinn or brown sugar in the crust and it turned out perfectly)

very decadent cheesecake. I love the sour cream topping and will incorporate this into other cheesecake recipes. This deserves more than 5 stars, I could not leave it in the oven to cool as I had a chicken roasting. I took out the cheesecake, set a glass bowl over the top and let it cool for 1 hour, I release the spring form pan and let chill in the fridge, then poured on the chocolate topping (made 1/2 batch) was the perfect amount to spread on cake, full batch could cover the sides as well

This was very good and very easy.  My only "complaint".....way too much filling (both w/the cream cheese mixture and the sour cream one).  I could have easily made two pies w/the the extra stuff.  I used oreo cookies for the crust and left the cookies in the middle fairly large at the suggestion of another user.  Several people complimented the cake and said it was the best they had ever had!!!  Will definitely be making this again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was the hit of the party!  I couldn't believe all of the wonderful comments!  I used the mini oreo cookies in the middle of the cheesecake and just crushed chocolate animal crackers for the crust.  I was worried that it wasn't set when I took it out of the oven to cool but it did set overnight.

I made this for the first time for neighborhood cook-off and won first place ribbon among all desserts.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly.  I grated semi sweet chocolate  bakers bars on a cheese grater to garnish over the chocolate ganache.  For the crust, I used chocolate sandwich cookies with chocolate filling, but used only the cookie part for the crust along with the brown sugar and butter.  For the filling, I quartered the whole cookies to layer in.  The sour cream layer adds a perfect counter to all the sweetness.  At least a dozen people asked for the recipe.

This is a great recipe, though I suggest using a tad bit more cinnamon and vanilla than is recommended. Pecans go great on top.

If you don't have a springform pan, you can do what I did - cut a circle out of parchement paper to put on the base of the pan, so it won't stick. Then, just slide a fork around the edges to loosen it, flip it onto a plate, and flip it right-side-up from there onto a serving platter.

Bon appetite!

Excellent!  Skip the cinnamon.  In my opinion it's better without.  I've had it both ways, and I think it's too overpowering in the crust, and distracts from the delicate cookie/cheesecake flavor.
A new favorite that got overwhelmingly rave reviews.  Everyone said it was the best cheesecake they had ever had.

This was alot of steps but  very very good cheesecake.  A few mishaps, I had 9 inch pan so I had little room after the main filling and realizing.  So the choclate ganache on top was put on lightly and actually turned out to be just perfect.  Will definatley make again. TY!

Excellent! I read most of the reviews and decided to leave the cinnamon in the crust and then when making it I forgot to add it. I will however try to remember to put it in next time I make this cheesecake. As far as the crust, I did not find it mushy as others did. I did not however add the 1/4 cup brown sugar to the crust. Oreo cookies are sweet enough without adding more sugar to them. I did add about 8 more cookies though and an extra tbsp. of butter. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup rather than the 1 1/4 cup in the recipe. My cookies were in nice big chunks inside the cheesecake. When I pulled the cheesecake out of the oven and before adding the sour cream layer which I also reduced the sugar to about half, I did let the cheesecake rest about 5 minutes before putting it back in the oven for the additional 7 minutes. I turned off the oven and left the cheesecake in the oven for 1 hour rather that a 1/2 hour, then I cracked the door and left it in the oven until just about room temp. Then I refrigerated the cheesecake and when it was nice and firm the next day I topped it with the chocolate topping. I did use about half of what was required, just enough to cover the top. After the chocolate was cold and firm on the top I removed the outer ring and cut it into 16 peices with a fishing line to ensure nice neat slices that could be easily removed. Everyone oooed and aaaed and several people asked for the recipe. Make sure you start this several days in advance.

As many have said- very decadent.  It was indeed too much for my 9 inch pan so I left off the sour cream layer.  Still incredible.  I shan't eat for a week.

This was a wonderful cheesecake.  I made it for my husband's birthday and we both loved it.  Because there were only 2 of us eating it I halfed the recipie and used a smaller pan (I think it was either a 6" or 7" springform pan).  I did the same cooking times and it turned out fine.

This was the best cheesecake I have made myself.  I only made a few minor changes and everyone thought that it turned out great.  I used the cinnamon and did not think it was too strong as some others have.  I doubled the amount of butter in the crust. I added handful of extra cookie crumbs for the crust to get a good thick solid crust.  When cooking I put a casserole dish full of water on the bottom rack to help avoid any possible browning, not sure if it was really necessary or not but I have had cheesecakes come out brown on top before so I always do this now.  If you are not a big chocolate fan I would suggest drizzling the chocolate on instead of using a solid layer but I was extremely happy with this recipe.

This is probably one of the BEST cheesecakes I have ever tasted!
I changed a few things though;
I left the cinnamon out of the crust, and to the batter I added about a 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, and over the stove I mixed together 1/3 cup whipped cream with 1/3 cup unsweetened chocolate chips, which I also added to the batter.
Also, for the topping, I left out the sour cream part completely, and I used half the whipped cream to melt with unsweetened chocolate chips, and the other half to melt with white chocolate chips.  After they both cooled, I poured the darker chocolate mixture over the top of the cake, and followed it with the white chocolate, which I marbled together with the dark with the convex side of a spoon.  Ontop of that, I poured on some of that butterscotch stuff that comes in a can and that's clear, smoothed it over the topping, and was done. Also, I don't think it makes a difference whether the cake is warm or not when you put the topping on.  I've made this numerous times and either way it's turned out well. 

This cake is great!

yum! i used a lot more than 2 cups of cookie crumbs for the crust, because i wanted it to go up the sides a bit, and left out the cinnamon. this was a huge hit! ive never made cheesecake before, and it might have had a huge crack or something but the sour cream and chocolate toppings covered up any mistakes :) the chocolate top was fabulous. thanks so much!

This is the BEST cheesecake I have made to date. Scrumptious! One caution: if you use a 9" springform pan like I did, it will likely overflow a little bit, losing some of that yummy filling. I left both the cinnamon and the brown sugar out of the crust - the cookies are sweet enough. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this Chocolate Cookie cheesecake quite a few times now, each time the only change I made is I skipped the cinnamon, each and every time this cake was a HUGE SUCCESS!!! Everyone loved it, even the people who claimed they don't like cheesecakes. True, it is very decadent, and you should cut the slices thin in order to eat the whole slice, but that is far from a downfall in my book. Thank you for the recipe I am asked and begged to make again and again!

This was my 1st go at making a cheesecake- it was perfect! I didn't use all the sour cream mixture b/c I wanted to leave enough room in the top of the pan for the chocolate topping.  Turns out the cake kind of deflated after a bit so there would have been room for the topping afterall.  Next time I will use all the sour cream mixture.  I cut the cinnamon in half and would do the same as it seemed like just the right hint of cinnamon.  Be sure to use cookies that are just broken up and not completely crushed for the middle layer.

Really, how can you go wrong with a recipe like this?  It wasn't the most beautiful cheesecake I ever made (assumingly b/c of the weighty additions to the batter and top,) but it was scrumptious.

This was great!!!  Used a 9" springform pan. For the crust, I used oreos with the cream scraped out, crushed and added about 6T butter instead of the 2T in the recipe b/c otherwise the crust wouldn't hold it's form.  Used mini oreos for the center layer.  Baked the cheesecake for 55 minutes b/c of my pan size.   Also, I only used about 1/2 of the sour cream mixture on top and 1/2 of the melted chocolate on top since my pan was smaller. It was fabulous and froze well after baking it since I didn't need it for my holiday party for another week.  Pulled it out to thaw in the fridge the day before my party.  Everyone wanted the recipe and thought it had been bought at the Cheesecake Factory!

Wonderful! It cracked when I made it and the sour cream covered it super good! I even Burnt the crust! LOL and everyone at husbands potluck said it was amazing. Didn't even notice the burnt taste ha. Can't wait to try the not burned version. Thanks for the recipe.

This was the most delicious cheesecake I have made in a long while. I made two of them in the same week. One for my husband's office Thanksgiving luncheon and one for the family. Most people were amazed that I had made this and thought it was store bought. I will definitely make this again!

Def need to increase baking time.  I baked for 95 minutes and let it sit in the oven for the 30 minutes on top of that.  I don't know what it was but it took forever.

Wow!  You only need to serve about a square inch to your guests with this one!  Rich and delicious.  I wouldn't change anything.  Just make sure you have a tall cake pan to bake it in so it doesn't spill over the top.

Thank you for this, it is AMAZING! This was the best homemade cheesecake I've ever had and made! I would say that it even competes with The Cheesecake Factory's cheesecakes! I opted out of making the crust myself and instead bought the already made Oreo cookie crust sold in supermarkets. It cut the prep time and really was one less thing i had to do. Thank you again, this has been added to my book!

Not bad. I'm not sure why the photo of this recipe doesn't show the layers of the real thing. To a previous reviewer: the cheesecake must cool 8 hours and then sit on the counter for 1 hr. This helps soften the chocolate layer and makes it easier to cut..

This cheesecake is fabulous! After reading the reviews I decided to cut the chocolate ganache layer by 50%. I used 3 cups of cookie crumbs and 3 Tbs. of butter for the crust and omitted the cinnamon. Other than that I followed the recipe. I always leave my cheesecakes in the oven to cool for 2 hours before removing them to cool on the counter. I made a white chocolate ganache and drizzled it over the top of the cheesecake as well. Delicious...thanks for this awesome recipe Millie.

Great tasting cheesecake.  I used chocolate Teddy Grahams, doubled the butter and omitted the cinnamon.  Crust was perfect.  No problems with the ganache but cheesecake was difficult to get out of the pan.  It was so moist that when I went to remove the ring pieces were sticking to the sides.  Had same problem while slicing.  Next time I'll try adding 1/3 cup cornstarch with the flour to try to get it firmer.  Great recipe, wonderful flavor!  I try at least 2 cheesecake recipes a week and this one is going into my favorites!

This cheesecake was excellent.  Lots of work, but well worth it.  I recommend giving it an extra day to set beyond what is recommended in the recipe -- it was even better the second day!

I followed the cooking directions rather than my instincts...and it was not done in the center...the best part was the crust because of the cinnamon.

Warning... this recipe will NOT fit into a 9-inch springform pan!  I read through several reviews and it seemed like many people used a 9-inch without a problem.  Not so!  After baking the cheesecake alone had risen to the top of the pan... so I had hardly any room for the sour cream layer.  I was able to gingerly spread about half of it on.  After it baked and cooled, there was no way I could fit the chocolate ganache layer, so I popped it out of the pan and poured the ganache over the whole cake... it covered the whole top and sides and puddled around the bottom.  Needless to say this cheesecake tastes amazing, and even mine didn't look half bad... Next time I will omit the brown sugar from the crust along with the cinnamon, it doesn't need either.

My hubby loves cheesecake and chocolate so I decided to bake him this cheesecake for his birthday.  I dont have a springform pan so I used two 8 inch round cake pans instead.  I left out the sugar and cinnamon in the crust and it was perfect.  Very rich and oh so sinfull.  My sister in law works for the company that manufactures all the cheesecakes for the Cheesecake factory and brings some by every so often.  My husband said it tasted like some of the cakes she brings!

This is the best dessert I have made to date.  I made it for my mother-in-law's birthday.  She LOVED it.  Everyone said it was wonderful.  It is time consuming to make but for a very special occasion I will make it again.

My husband requested this for his birthday.  I had never made a cheesecake before, so I had no idea that it would take so long to make (it took me 3 hours from start to finish).  But I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out great!  The long prep time was worth it - it looked and tasted great, and got rave reviews from the birthday boy and the rest of the family.

Oh Yes!!!  Perfection!!! Refridgerated for 2 days prior to eating and their was no problem cutting, cookies had softened. Needs 1 full pack of oeros for recipe.  2 rows for bottom in order to completely cover 10" springform, and remaining row in the cheesecake layer.

This is the best cheesecake recipe I have used. I made a mint chocolate version at Christmas. All I did was add peppermint extract in the cheese mix, as well as some green food colouring. I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, and it came out fantastic. It was minty, but not too over powering, with a slight green colour to it. The chocolate on top got just hard enough to cut and eat but still smooth and melt in your mouth!

The directions made far too much filling to fit into my standard sized spring-form pan, so I had to cut back on the cream cheese and egg. Next time I think I will also leave off the sour cream part of the recipe, as I don't really think it added anything but a few more calories. And I also found the cinnamon in the crust to be a bit weird, though some of my guests really loved it.

I was all excited to make this for Christmas ... disappointed. The crust had a burnt taste to it, I should have listened to the other reviews and not used oreos with the cream center crushed up, I'm pretty sure that's what the problem was. I didn't add the cinnamon since so many people were against it and I didn't think it was necessary ... no regrets there. I bought a 10" pan and everything fit and stacked well. What I wasn't a fan of was the cheesecake filling itself, it was a little ... not a lot but a little, dry. Giving it more the New York Cheesecake taste which I am not a fan of. I prefer creamier, silkier, smoother ... which I think the cheesecakes that add 1 less bar of cream cheese and sour cream instead of whipping cream give. I won't make this again ... I really didn't find it to be anything special.

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would!  I made it exactly as directed and it turned out great!  I will say that it did taste better the second day.  So next time I make it I will make sure to do it a day before I need it.

Oh my goodness this cheesecake was sooooooo good!!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe except that I added a couple of handfuls of chocolate chips to the batter which only added to the decadence.  Also, I found that the cookie crumb crust was too loose, (I had crumbs everywhere when I sliced it) it could use a couple more tablespoons of butter to bind it.  A lot of people complained of the sour cream layer but I have to tell you that the layer of sour cream cut the sweetness of the chocolate top and gave it a wonderful zing that really worked.  Not an everyday kind of cake, but a real keeper for those very special occasions.  I give it two thumbs up and will make it again for sure!

This was just excellent. I made it for my husband for Valentine's day and he has raved about it for a whole week. He even posted about it on facebook (which he never does). I was worried about the sour cream layer but it tasted great! I will add more cookies to the filling next time and omit the cinnamon.

This recipe was delicious, the only suggestion I would make would be not to precook the cookie crust; just cook everything together at once. I also used everything Fat Free, Reduced Fat, Splenda instead of Sugar, Egg Beaters instead of Eggs, so it does take a little longer to cook, but just be patient it's worth cutting the calories for this decadent dessert!!!

I had to size it down because my pan is only 8 inches. Pretty good recipe, but I did change some things. I used milk instead of heavy whipping cream, and I skipped the sour cream layer and  the chocolate layer. These just seemed to make it too rich, so instead I crumbled more cookie chunks on top and drizzled a little bit of caramel. I was going to drizzle a little chocolate on top, but didn't have any. However, I did use about 1 TBL of dutch cocoa and marbled it into the cheesecake. It was a hit!!! And it was a great way to use up some of the chocolate cookies we had left from a party.
Thanks for the idea!

very rich and tall! The cake goes all the way up to the rim of the springform pan. It's a very decadent cheesecake which I'd probably make once a year.

Wow, is this great or what??!  Made this for my Christmas dessert and everyone enjoyed it.  Very, very rich, so as some suggested I didn't cut big pieces (which was fine with me because I brought the leftovers home and ate them throughout the week!!)  I followed this recipe as directed, since this was my first time making a cheesecake.  I wouldn't change a thing!

I am not anywhere close to being an accomplished chef, but decided for some reason to make this cheesecake for Christmas eve this year.  It took a while, but OH. MY. GOD is it worth it!  Hands down the best cheesecake I've ever tasted.  Anywhere.  Puts the cheesecake factory to shame and I LOVE that place.  I have never tasted something so decadent in my life.  Truly unbelieveable.

I made this cheesecake twice the first time i follwed the recipe accept i left out the second layer with the sour cream i didn't have enough room but it turned out pretty good the chocolate layer is a little too much it makes it way too sweet and i would recommend using milk chocolate rather than semi sweet. The second time i made it , it was waaaay better i used grahm cracker crumbs for the crust and used vanilla oreo cookies instead of chocoloate i also used a very thin layer of chocolate on top and put the second layer with the sour cream it was excellent i highly recommend trying it this way it was very good!!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it was gone before I could get a piece...the pumpkin pies just sitting there, forlorn.  So I made another one, the next day...I managed a piece that time, but my family had eaten all 16 pieces by the end of the day!!    I've made another since then, for my son's bake-sale fundraiser for Boy Scouts, and last night I bought 3 9 inch springform pans ($6 each at Ross) and I'm going to bake the cheesecakes then give them - in the pans- wrapped up in pretty saran wrap and bows with the recipe attached for my kid's teachers.  This will be a BIG hit, I know :)  You don't need to change a thing...but if you want to use the granache topping from the Bailey's Irish Cream cheesecake on this site instead, it will only make it that much better.  Or, if you like mint and it's during the holidays, take advantage of the Mint Oreos on sale and use those for a special taste.  I would give this 6 stars if it would let me

This is a great recipe! I have now made it two times and it tastes great each time. The only thing is mine does crack but when you add the sour cream layer and then the chocolate layer you never see a thing! :)

I followed this recipe almost exactly as directed, except I used a water bath as I always do. I admit I was on the fence about the sour cream layer, and decided to follow the recipe. If you are not sure if you want to try it, or you're scared, just do it - it adds more visually than taste-wise. Like others, I felt the chocolate layer was a bit much. I used dark choc. chips. Next time I will probably cut the amount of choc. down to a 1/4 of the recommended amount and just put a light, thin layer on top. The dark choc. was excellent (just too much), and I'll likely do that again. The crust was perfect. My only complaint is that the middle ended up not quite done. I let the cake cook in the oven for an extra 7 minutes due to the water bath, then turned it off and let sit as directed. When I pulled it out, it had the typical appearance of a properly set cheesecake and I was happy -but 2 days later (I always find cheesecake is better if it can sit for a full day) when I cut into it, the very center was almost pie-like. It was still delicious, but I was disappointed. So I would recommend cooking a bit longer than the recipe advises - maybe even 15 minutes. In fact, I will likely cook a full hour and fifteen and skip the sit inside the oven bit. Aside from that minor detail (and let me assure you we had no problem eating the entire cake!), it was a nice diversion from the traditional NY style cakes I typically make. I will def. make this again with some minor adjustments.

I made this for my daughters birthday & it was "WONDERFUL" I made it exactly like the recipe called for...the only problem I had was after the oven was turned off for the 30 min when i took it out it wasn't quite done so i just turned the oven back on to 175 for 10 min and it was perfect! My daughter called this morning and said she got up in the middle of night to have another piece! thanks  it was GREAT!!!

Loved, loved, loved this cheesecake (as did my guests:)  Here's what happened when I made it...followed the directions exactly until I got to the sour cream layer.  I couldn't put this on because my pan wasn't big enough.  This makes a TON of cheesecake filling.  I did use the gnache layer but I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  This filling is the best I've come across yet!  Thanks for the recipe...I'll be making this again.

Very nice cheesecake! What I did different however was lessen the sugar to 3/4 of a cup (don't like cheesecake to be too sweet), and added sour cream in the mixture (not on top)...(I also used 3 packages of cream cheese, not sure if it's the same amount stated!) turned out AMAZING! ALSO, I HIGHLY suggest that you put foil around the springform pan and place it in another roasting pan with boiling water filled to about half of the cake (Bain Marie)...VERY important, it really helps so that it doesn't overcook and burn on top.

A fantastic recipe!  I have made this several times and it has always turned out well.  I have co-opted suggestions from other reviews, such as leaving out the cinnamon.  I have made the crust from both sandwich cookies and chocolate graham cookies and they were both good.  I prefer the consistancy of the graham crust personally.  The last time I made this cheesecake I went to make the sour cream layer and found I didn't have enough sour cream left in my refrigerator, so I left it and the chocolate topping off and the cheesecake was still great and everyone at my party loved it.  This also made it much easier to cut.

Wow! This is an incredible recipe. Perfect cheesecake flavor comes through. I loved the balance and complexity with the different layers and flavors. I used one package of Oreos for this (including a few for garnish on top).

This cheesecake is absolutely one of the best I've ever made.  For the crust, I took out the 'whites' of the Oreos and just crushed the chocolate wafers.  But I followed the recipe exactly and it produced a luscious, creamy, decadent cheesecake that tastes absolutely phenomenal.  Definitely a keeper!

Yum! This was the first time I had ever made a cheesecake, and it was one of the most delectible desserts I have ever eaten. It was rich and creamy, and I followed the recipe exactly.  Also, I entered this cheesecake in a bakeoff at my university, and it won 2nd out of 11 entries. There were lots of "oohs" and "ahhs". I would definitely make again. I added shaved dark chocolate on the top, and it was fabulous!!! Thank you, Millie, for this wonderful recipe!

Responding to Wendy. It says 2 lbs. So that would be four(4) 8 oz. packs of cream cheese. I'm looking forward to trying this one later. I'm about to cook my wife a Praline Cheesecake I found on another site.

Excellent cheesecake and not too difficult to make.  I used the best ingredients possible, which made the cheesecake extremely expensive.  However, all the raves I received made the price very worthwhile.

This cheesecake was SO rich and delicious.  It was very time consuming, but well worth it.  Next time, I will make a few changes however.  I won't add nearly as much cinnamon.  Maybe only as little as 1/4 a tsp.  Also, I'll make a dark chocolate ganache instead of semi sweet, just personal preference.  And I'll be sure to freeze the cake before i try to remove it from the springform.  The edges were a little ruined when I tried to remove it even after 12 hours of refridgeration!  Overall, this cheesecake is one you will be remembered by, and definitely one to go into your permanent recipe book.

This Cheesecake was amazing!  I have made this for work and EVERYONE on nightcrew loved it.  Said it was the best they ever had.  My family and friends all said that it was great!  I thought the crust was perfect just enough spices, but not so much that it was overpowering.

I decided to enter this recipe into my school's annual spring fling dessert contest.  I followed the hints:  no cinnamon, I put a pan of water on a separate shelf under my cheesecake in the oven, and I added strawberries and caramel over the top to decorate.  I never got to taste the cake, so I wasn't sure whether it was any good.  However, when I showed up at the end of the event, every last bite of the cheesecake was gone!  I won 2nd place and have had students, teachers, and parents asking for the recipe.  Apparently, it was a great hit.  I'll have to make it again so that I can finally try it. :)

This is the best cheesecake! I thought that 45 minutes wasn't long enough so i baked it for 5o and it overcooked (cracked and was golden brown). Once I put on the toping though, no one could tell the difference. It was beautiful. The flavour of the toping was a great addition to the cake . You are missing out if you don't add it. Also, be sure to let the cake cool entirely before you put it in the fridge  . I liked this one better than "supreme cheesecake."

Wow!  This is a great recipe.  It was the first time I attempted a homemade cheesecake and it turned out great.  Make this one and don't change a thing about the recipe!

I bought this into work and received rave reviews.  I modified it somewhat by skipping the full top chocolate layer and instead just drizzled the chocolate over the cake (it seems a full layer may overpower it too much and make the top too "heavy") I also used a water bath to avoid the common mishaps of overbaking and cracks.

The is BY FAR the best cheesecake I've ever had. It's time consuming, but it comes out perfect EVERY TIME. I wish I could give it 10 stars, but 5 will have to do! :)

The cheesecake looked and tasted great! I put Oreo halves and white chocolate chips on top. -- However, mine was a bit soft in the middle but the top burnt a bit and i ended up cutting it off. I had a dish of water underneath it while baking and I also added more sugar and vanilla to the sour cream so it tasted just like vanilla yogurt. -- If I were to make it again I would lower the temperature and bake for a bit longer. I would also cut the yogurt layer in half and make less chocolate.

We made the recipe as directed and it is so over the top rich we could hardly eat it.  The chocolate on the top could be omitted because it really overpowers the taste of the cheesecake itself.

So good, although a pain to make, she had fun with it and followed the directions to a T and it was AMAZING.

I am not sure where I went wrong. I think maybe I under baked it. I baked it until the center was set, with a very very slight jiggle to it. It looked beautiful, but when I cut into it the center was very soft. The flavor was great just much softer than I would have liked. I prefer my cheesecake to be firm. I may try this one more time and bake it for a little longer. I follwed the recipe as written other than I baked it in a water bath.

Oh... My... Lord...  I normally mess up Cheesecake's... over bake or the texture is grainy...  But this one... this beautiful cheesecake... is amazing...  I skipped the cinnamon (I don't like it in chocolate crumb bases... but if I make a gram cracker base, it's going in) and followed everything else to a T.  And it was delicious... HUGE.. and delicious... It didn't last the night at my sister's Birthday party...  DECADENTLY WONDERFUL!

I wish I had never made this amazing cheesecake -- now every hostess for every party we attend has asked me to make one!  It is a fantastic recipe, but I did skip the cinnamon to avoid too many contrasting flavors.  I also replaced the vanilla extract with Kahlua -- tastes great!

I would personally give this 4 stars as I did not care for the sour cream layer but everyone else absolutely loved this cheesecake and did not believe that I made it, thought it came from a fancy bakery.  So I am torn the next time I make it, I would like to leave that layer off but that would probably disappoint everyone but me.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing.

This was the first cheesecake I have ever made - and it worked perfectly!!!  I followed the recipe exactly. I was nervous at first that it was undercooked, but it firmed up perfectly. I decorated it with 16 oreo halves -one on each slice and cut it with fishing line as someone suggested. The fishing line was AWESOME and made perfectly sliced pieces that were easy to lift off with a cake server. It is rich, so slim slices are a must!

This cake was amazing. I made it almost exactly as written and everthing was fine. Only thing different for me was (1) I used a 9 in pan instead of 10. (2) I divided the oreos for the crust using half with cream and half without and (3) I only used half of the cinnamon. After baking it, it was really late so (4) I refrigerated it and did the chocolate topping the next day. Then, I let it sit in the frig for another day after that. I had no problem with there being to much filling and had plenty of room for the chocolate too....maybe it helped letting the cake settle and fall a little. Next time I think I may leave out the cinnamon and maybe only do plain oreo's for crust. The crust was the only part that didnt totally knock my socks off. With that said, this was a total show stopper and my guests were totally impressed!!! Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly except for the sour-cream glaze near the end of baking. My friends were amazed with this cake!  I used graham cracker crust and found that 2 Tbsp of butter wasn't enough to hold the crust together (was crumbly but still good).  During baking, cracks formed on the top, but easily hidden by using the chocolate topping.  Beautiful recipe!

I quite like this cheesecake.  It's a lot of work but I think it's worth it.  It's not overly sweet either, which is nice.  I'm not crazy about the sour cream layer on the top of the cake.  I think I would skip that next time and just put the ganache on top.  Otherwise good cake and probably will make again.

This cake was brilliant! I didn't change anything deliberately, but I forgot to add the brown sugar to the base. It came out great, so it was ok.  Whoever said you could bake this in a 9" must have a very very tall cake tin, as I tried it and found that I couldn't possibly fit the batter in. I left about 2" on the top for the sour cream mix but realised that the cake rose and cracked. I baked it for around 50 mins in my fan assisted oven. Let it cool for quite a bit, waiting for it to go down so I have room for the sour cream. I only managed to fit in a very thin layer. The cracking didn't matter since the sour cream evened everything out. I baked it for another 10 mins, then turned off the oven and left it in for another 30 mins. Then I let it cool for a bit before putting the cake in the fridge with a stainless steel bowl to cover it. I had massive trouble getting the ganache topping, I must have heated the cream too fast and it all curdled. I just melted some dark chocolate instead and poured it over. Next time I will do it the known way of heating cream and adding it to the chocolate rather than putting it in the pan altogether. The cake itself was eaten a day after and it was very very yummy, everyone was pleased. Will bake again but in a 10" and maybe use a waterbath to prevent cracking.

Excellent.  I do not have a spring form pan so I used cupcake pan.  Sprayed the pan, and then firmly pressed the crust to the bottom and up around the sides. Baked 5 min, as recipe states. Added cheese cake mixture as stated, with the cookie chunks. I filled the cups nearly to the top.   Cut down initial cook time to 20 to 25 min. added sour cream mixture and cooked the remaining time (in full).  They puffed up a bit (before sour cream) but when I took them out and mixed the sour cream they "settled and firmed" enough for me to add the sour cream mix in a thin layer. They came out PERFECT. I was worried that they would stick to the pan, but they did not.  Once they were cool, I used a sharp knife around the perimeter of each cake. Then added gnache and put them in the fridge until the next day.  LOOKED and TASTED wonderful. :)

I only had a 9inch pan, so i did not have room for the sour cream layer. I still added the chocolate layer. It was fantastic! I can't wait to make it again with the sour cream layer this time. I had people coming by just for desert.

I followed the recipie exactly (except I left out the cinnamon in the crust) and it turned out perfect and delicious. I made it for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day and I was so nervouse that it wouldn't turn out. I shouldn't have worried. It exceeded my expectations. I'm a very beginner cook so if I can make this anyone can! I would suggest reading the directions several times ahead of time so you have clear idea of what you'll be doing. That helped me out a lot! I think this will become my standard company dessert.

This is a wonderful recipe. I generally don't use the sour cream topping. I add extra butter to the crust, which helps a lot. I also use a water bath while baking to prevent cracking, and allow the cake to refridgerate at least one day before serving.

Great with the following adjustments: Needs 4 tbsp butter in the crust, half the sour cream layers ingredients (I think that layer is too thick with the current proportions).

Made this for my husband for Christmas and it turned out very nice and rich.  Can only eat a small slice at a time so had to give away quite alot.  :) Didn't make the sour cream topping and next time will add more oreo cookies to the batter, didn't seem to be enough in there.  Excellent, rich cheesecake.

You really should read the reviews before making this. I omitted the cinn. for the crust. My first thought was cinnamon on chocolate! The filling was too much. I poured the filling to the edge of the crust and had some left over. I did not use the sour cream b/c I wanted to use the chocolate sauce. The cake turned out beautifully but was very rich with the cookie crust and crumbs and chocolate sauce. I will make this again but will leave out crumbs and chocolate sauce.

It was perfect, my family enjoyed it very much. The sour cream surprisingly made the cake, it gave it a smooth texture. Although it took a lot of time to make because of the different layers, it is certainly worth it.   However, I would add less chocolate whipping icing on top next time, I thought that was a little too much. But overall, it was fantastic!

I omitted the cinnamon in the crust. I used a 10' pan. However, when it came time to add the sour cream layer, I had no room, so I omitted it. I added the melted chocolate layer, just pouring it on top. I served it the next day to coworkers. It was a big hit. Very soft and creamy cheesecake.

I made this for a party, along with the Caramel Macchiato cheesecake also from this sity. I cut this recipe in half and used a smaller springform (maybe 7.5inches?). It was perfect! I cut the chocolate layer in half (quarter of the original) and it was plenty. Let the cream almost boil then add the chocolate and stir just until mixed. It turned out really creamy and soft. Wonderful cheesecake!! Half the guests preferred this one and half preferred the other one, but everyone said they were both fantastic. I will definately make this again with no changes!! Thank you!!!

A lot of work but very good and worth it.. I wouldn't cut back on the filling if you are using a 10 inch springform..I did last time and it came out paper thin.. I would also use 3 tbsp. of butter instead of 2.. But i would half the amount for the ganache topping.. Also, for a little decorative touch you can drizzle caramel topping in the ganache before it cools..  Yum!

Very pretty and delicious.  I will try making the ganache next time by bringing about 1/3 C cream just to a boil and then pouring over 1 C chocoalate chips- better consistency and less ganache as I felt there was too much.  Plan several hours to get this one made, but worth it if you're a cheesecake lover!

I made this recipe two nights ago, unveiled the creation last night and tried it.  I didn't have time to decorate it, so the picture is the "raw deal", but still nice.  I have my grandmother's cheesecake recipe that has been in the family for years and next time I'll use that recipe instead.  I did like the chocolate cookie crust and the ganache on the top.  Next time I'll only put the cookie crust on the bottom of the pan rather than half-way up the sides and I won't make as much of the cheesecake filling as the cake is at least 4" high and very rich.  Nice recipe and I will definitely try it again with the changes. Thanks for sharing!

Topping was horrible, too much. The only good part was the plain cheesecake part (which I can do on my own). The rest was not good. Will not make again.

I made this for my Dad's birthday and we all loved it.  It's super rich so I'd suggest starting with small slices.  It is the toughest cheesecake I've ever made, but well worth the time and effort.  It looked beautiful on the cake platter.  Looked and tasted just like Cheesecake Factory.  Delish!

First time I made this, I made 2...one for a party and one for my husband.  I don't eat cheesecake due to the richness, but I bake them regularly for my cheesecake loving husband. I used Teddy Grahms, as another person suggested.  They were a huge hit among both groups of people, and the recipe was asked for by many at the party. Be warned, though!  Many people could only eat a small sliver due to the richness!

Absolutely Amazing! The only change I made was to leave out the cinnamon. I have noticed on other reviews that it was hard to slice because of the chocolate layer. I didn't have this problem and think that it probably has to do with how long you cook it. I heated it up constantly stirring until just melted. It turned out perfect and was a huge hit.

All I could say was OMG.  It was a lot of work, but it was very much WORTH IT!  I made my own "low fat" recipe in which I used fat free sour cream, fat free cream cheese, substituted splenda for the sugar, and denied the last bit of chocolate on top.  It was still fabulous with the reduced fat oreos and smart balance light butter :) Don't forget to use eggbeaters instead of the real thing!  Cheesecake is part of my diet once again - I LOVE IT!

We thought this cheesecake was just *okay*. Considering how expensive all the ingredients are and the amount of time that it took to prepare it i was expecting something more decadent. I made it exactly as the original recipe calls for. And it was good..just not great.

I made this for my sister and although I have no idea what it ended up tasting like, she said it was great.  I give it five stars for that reason.  I had trouble getting the sour cream layer on because there just wasn't any room and most of it ended up going to the center.  I would recommend a 10 inch springform (I used a 9) and maybe cut the sour cream mixer in half. Also, I used chocolate Teddy Grahams for the crust and in the cake itself.

Most awesome cheesecake, served it up to 16 guests 
and everyone thought it was awesome, "you really made this from scratch??"" Followed directions as were stated.  For chocolate cookies I used regular 
OREO's.  One stated "the best cheese cake I ever had"  This one is a keeper.

Amazing cheesecake recipe! I made this for my sister's bridal shower and everyone went crazy for it. It is by far the best cheesecake I have tried. The sour cream topping is a must, simply delicious!!!

My daughter chose this cake for her 5th birthday cake and she loved it.  Mom and dad did too.  The layers are attractive and make it very interesting to eat as they all taste a little different.  We'll definitely be making this again.

I made mini cheesecakes and they tasted really good, so I'm giving 5 stars.
A couple of little problems though, there were little cracks in the tops, and I think it might be because I put my crushed Oreos in way too close to the surface, like 2/3 up instead of 1/3 up. It seemed to crack above the lumps.
But the tasty ganache covered that up anyway. Also the bases were soggy and really not crunchy, I don't know why. I used McVities digestive biscuits.

Are there more than 5 stars for a recipe. This is the best recipe I have made from this site. Truly tastes as good, if not better, than Cheesecake Factory, and costs a lot less. 

I made one for a friend's party using a 9 inch pan and used some of the extra batter to make three small ones for us. They all turned out perfect. The ganache really makes it professional looking and adds so much. 

I did not take the cream out of the cookies, just put them in my Kitchen Aid blender on chop. I have never made such an easy cookie crust. 

I will make it again soon!

This is a fool proof cheescake. If you can follow directions then this WILL turn out perfect!! You can always tweak it if you have personal preferences but you do not need to. Put layers on gently and evenly, I did as another reviewer stated and clumped the sour layer in the middle and it disrupted the bottom layer. Each time I seal up the springform pan, and put directly into the freezer. When I need it I take it out the night before. I have made this 4 times since I first tried it for Christmas. I put decorated frosting flowers on top the first time. Today i drizzled carmel on top. But you do not need to add anything. This will be one of my all time keepers.

This was a great cheescake. My boyfriend, who hates cheesecake, absolutely LOVES this recipe. It takes a LONG time to make, but it makes a TON. If you are craving cheesecake, and make this, be sure you have plenty of people to give it away to.
A few tips: there is not enough butter for the crust. Be liberal with it. If not, your crust will come out crumbly and not good at all. Make sure your cream cheese is softened. But it out on the counter for 15-20 minutes. It will make blending it a lot easier.

Excellent recipe!! I baked this for my sister in-laws birthday and everyone loved it. However, I went with my own judgement and didn't add the cinnamon to the crust because I was a bit weary of the combination. I took the creme out of the middle of the cookies for the crust. Instead of crushing the extra cookies that went into the filling, I just roughly chopped them so that I could get nice chunks of cookies throughout. A 9 inch springform pan is fine if that is the only pan that is on hand, but if you have a 10 inch, use it. Using the 9 inch pan, the sour cream topping hardly fit on top due to the rising, but I made it work!! Loved this recipe, full of flavor and just decadent. Oh, and I just sprinkled the chocolate topping across the cake and it looked beautiful!!

My daughter and I made this for Mother's Day and can I just say Awesome!!  We used Oreos for the crust (since my grocery didn't have Oreo crumbs we used actual cookies) and blended all the removed cream filling into the batter.  The cookies made a fantastic crust, but for the 2c of crumbs we ended up using 1stick butter rather than 2tbsp.  We used a combination of chocolate and regular double stuffed Oreos for the cookie chunks within the batter and did 2 layers instead of 1.  Finished cake had a great consistency, not too dense, and the chocolate, which we added prior to leaving the house, stayed room temp which made it firm, not runny or hard. We garnished with a circle of alternated double stuffed Oreos for a great presentation.  My daughter called it "Chocolate Cookie Cheesecake with a Touch of Genius" and it definitely lived up to the label. Will definitely do again, family loved it!

I wasn't sure about putting sour cream on top of a cheesecake, but it works! I took this to a family gathering and my in-laws went crazy. The hostess actually insisted on keeping the pan so she could finish it off. Definitely worth all the ingredients and time.

I can only rate by presentation, as I made this and gave it as a gift. I used a 9" springform pan and only altered the recipe by "chopping" Oreos w/ a knife,so the layer would be chunky instead of finer curmbs. Oh, and I added that oreo layer after "half" of the batter not 1/3 as suggested. It looked amazing.

Delicious. Creamy, not too "cakey" or dense, but plenty, plenty rich and decadent! My husband got an itch to make a cheesecake -- his first -- and this was the recipe. It really turned out great. One thing for next time, we will probably use more butter (maybe half again as much, or even double it?) in the crust to have it hold together a little better. Also, the Pampered Chef springform pan is NOT big enough for this recipe. We made a little extra crust, distributed the extra batter among muffin cups and baked them separately.

This was a fantastic recipe.  We made for my mom for Mother's Day and everyone loved it!  I read one review about the cinnamon, so I only used 1/2 tsp. and it was not overpowering.  The only problem that I had was that the center did not set and I am not quite certain why, but it did not change the taste at all.  The next time I make it I think that I will add more cookies to the center layer.  Thank you for a great recipe that I know I will definitely make again.

My son requests this every year for his Birthday cake! The only difference on my recipe is the chocolate ganache topping.  Mine calls for 1/3 cup whipping cream and 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips also 1 tsp. vanilla extract.  The cooking time varies a bit on mine as well.  baking at 325 for 12 min for the crust then 1 hr and 15 min @ 325 for the cheesecake then 7 min @ 325 for the sourcream topping and turning off the oven but leaving it in for 45 min.  I have one in the oven now, as tomorrow is his BD!

This cheesecake is both elegant and fun, it's got quite the character.    This is one of the best cheesecake recipes I have come across.  Even without all the cookie hype, the "cheesecake" recipe is excellent, it's exactly the creamy texture I prefer. I don't normally use flour and whipping cream in the filling.  I am quite impressed!  One thing, however, I would change is to leave off the chocolate topping. I don't think the two chocolate tastes blend well together.  This topping is elegant and would compliment a regular ol cheesecake recipe rather than one packed with so much cookie fun.  I would like to see the topping resembling the crust; crumbled chocolate sandwich cookies (without the cream of course) baked right on top the cheesecake . This cheesecake is STILL 5 stars, to me.  I plan on putting this recipe on the list of desserts I give as gifts.  Imagine this at your door unexpectedly!

This was outstanding.  Based on reviews that shared there wasn't enough room in the pan I reduced the sour cream mixture by half.  Wish I didn't do that. If you use the pan size called for you'll have plenty of room. I also used the cream in the cookies for the crust AND I used the cinnamon.  The only thing I'd add more of is the crushed cookie. This was A WOW!

As stated in another review it does take some time to make, however the results are well worth the time, especially for a special occasion.  I first made it for my sister's birthday in Novermber and everyone raved about it.  My father said that it was the best dessert that he has ever had. I made it again today for my mother in law and sister in law's birthdays.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Like some other reviews, I did use more than 2 cups of cookie in the crust, and more than called for in the center, however unlike some I did keep the cinnamon and think it made it distinctive and added to the overall flavor.  I did change from regular oreos to the oreos with the chocolate filling and think this made it even more decadent.

Its definitely good. The center is softer than it should be, but its probably due to my oven and not the recipe. Hard to cut a clean piece!

A couple weeks back I made this for our ladies luncheon. Last week I was asked if I would make again for our weekly potluck so the husbands could also enjoy the delectable treat. Easy to make, but I did find that since I live in an RV that I had to increase from 350 to 375 and make sure that my oven thermometer was working properly so the cheese cake would bake without the cookie crust burning.

Very good cake. Not 5 star because it is very sweet and most of the people that had it were only able to take it in small slices, although all of them took some home. Ecerybody really liked it just very rich.

This cheesecake was amazing!!  The only mistake I made was in using a 9 inch springform pan.  It almost overflowed and there wasn't enough room to put the ganache topping on.  Definitely use a bigger springform pan!

After serving this cake at a birthday party, i was told it was "incredible".  I completely agree, its delicious.  I omitted the cinnamon from the recipe, it was really unnecessary.  I also dont think the layer of sour cream was needed.  I will omit that next time to save calories/money.  The cake is definitely best the next day, but not for much longer after that.  I will be making this recipe for thanksgiving instead of my usual apple pie!

WOW the best cheesecake ever, I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. I made this for dessert for xmas dinner and everyone raved about it. I read that some people were having trouble with the cookies being gooey in the crust so to prevent this I chopped the cookies for the crust in the food processor and it worked perfectly. Will make this one time and time again.

Truly exceptional. My family cannot get enough of this. I will echo another poster that said it is important to remember to put the cookie crumbs in between the layers of the cheesecake as it makes such a great difference.  Also I too only had a 9inch spring form pan but baked it for 50 minutes and it was perfect.  Finally, I suggest allowing it to chill in the refrigerator at least 6 hours as it tastes even better the longer it chills.  Amazing cake!!!!

Definitely very rich.  We cut big pieces and I actually couldn't finish it all!  I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and forgot to put in the cinnamon, but that was ok.  Didn't change a thing otherwise.  I wasn't sure if it was not cooked all the way or if it was the sour cream layer that "sunk" into the center, but the center was very cream.  I wasn't able to let it cool on the counter since I made it rather late, so maybe it was from putting it directly into the fridge after only 10-15 min. of cool time?  But it tasted very good and we all enjoyed it for our Christmas Day dessert.

I made this exactly as written. OMG, it was fabulous. My sister commented that it was restaurant quality. Except for making a complete mess while crushing the oreo's for the crust, this wasn't a very difficult recipe. Looking at the ingredient list was a bit overwhelming, but it wasn't too bad, and well worth the trouble. Yum.

I should have baked cheesecake just a little longer.  Was not set up in the middle but tasted great.  Followed instructions but used a 9 inch pan.  On the rim of the pan I put a folded three inch strip of foil around the pan so I could add all of the layers and it worked out.

AMAZING!!!   Made this for the first time for Thanksgiving with the in-laws without trying it out first...risky, but SUCCESS!! This is a bit time-consuming, but make sure to layer the ingredients as specified.  If you accidentally crack the cheesecake while baking, the sour cream layer definitely covers it up! Make sure to use more chocolate chips than called for to have a thicker ganache on the top... mine was a bit runny and I even added extra chocolate chips.  Definitely takes the suggested amount of time to set up... put in the freezer if you need to expedite the process.   My family and in-laws are already asking me to bake another one of these. It doesn't last long and is definitely restaurant quality!!!

Really good- I don't like cheese cake, but my BF does and he loved it!  I cut the recipe in half and made mine into cup cakes- it worked out really well. My 1st attempt wasnt as pretty as the other photos, but next time Im going to try to make them prettier =)

This was the best cheesecake I have EVER made. I made one for work and it got outstanding reviews. So of course I had to make it for the inlaws, and they were thrilled with it! You really do have to be careful when spooning out the second layer of cheesecake over the broken oreo pieces if you dump it all in the middle then the oreo layer will be displaced and won't look as pretty when you cut up the pieces. And also, use the actual box of chocolate crumbs for the crust, it works a lot better than trying to smush up the cookies your self. This is so good that i'm making it for work again today!

This was FANTASTIC! I added extra cookies to the middle layer and separated the ones I used for the crust so I didn't have the cream in the crust (just used the half w/o cream).

Great recipe. I love cheesecake and I have made many different recipes which always get raving reviews. But this one tops all recipes I made. It is absolutely divine. I followed the recipe, but I did use more cookies for both the base and the layer in between. Thank you for  a real keeper.

Unreal!!  Everyone loved it.  I think I put on about 5lbs, but well worth it.  My roomate wants me to make these cheesecakes at his wedding now even after going to the pros'.  He is very picky and rated this desert to be in his "top 5" of alltime.  I used a thin layer of brownie mix and baked it until set (30-40min) for the bottom crust and crushed double stuff Oreo in the middle of the cheesecake.  I would do everything the same except less semisweet chocolate chips because it makes the cheesecake a little too rich for my taste, but maybe that's the only thing keeping me from eating it all in one sitting.

Taste was great.  I would probably put on less chocolate topping.  It was under cooked, but it is probably an issue with my oven.

This was the best cheesecake I have ever had!  The only thing I did different than the recipe was to break up the cookies for the layer in the cheesecake, into thirds rather than crushing them.  I will definitely make this again!!  I make my husband a cheesecake every year for his birthday and this has definitely been his favorite!!

WOW.  After making this cheesecake, I have had coworkers, neighbors, and relatives all approach me on separate occasions encouraging me to start my own dessert company.  Tastes better than cheesecake from a gourmet restaurant!  No changes necessary, though rather than pouring in 1/3 of the batter and then addng the cookie pieces, I would pour in 2/3 batter first.  Delicous recipe!

This was amazing! It was time consuming, but really very simple and difficult to mess up. I did need to add more butter to the crust, however, because as is it wasn't moist enough to stick to the side. When I told my boyfriend about the cinnamon in the crust, he said he thought it be weird but he ended up loving it. Will definitely do again!

I've made this a few times and it has come out great!  I cut the recipe by a fourth to fit into a 9 inch pan.  I also find it useful to pour nearly all the batter to the pan before adding the cookie pieces.  It seems to keep them in suspension slightly better.

This was the best cheesecake I have ever made! Everyone who tried it loved it. just a warning though.... this is very chocolatey cheesecake(a plus for me) and this recipe makes a 4 lb cheesecake which is huge so make sure you have some help eating it!

This is the most amazing cheesecake I have ever made or eaten. I don't ever take more than a bite of any dessert but I actually ate two (big) bites of this. One of my daughters-in-law is a real cheesecake expert and I have no hesitation sending the recipe to her.

I made this for my Husbands Birthday, he LOVES cheesecake!!! I didn't have the right kind of pan so I used a ready made cookie crust and changed the recipe for fewer servings. The only problem I had was the chocolate was so runny that I couldn't drizzle it, I ended up making it a thin layer on top with cookies as the border.  I definitely will make this again!! Thanks

Excellent cheesecake.  I've made it twice.  Once I followed the directions to a T and it was fabulous.  One time I tried to alter it a little and used chocolate graham crackers instead of the oreos for the crust.  The crust ended up being too thick to allow me to put the sour cream layer on at the end.  It still tasted great, but I would follow the directions and not change a thing!

This cheesecake is phenomenal. This was my first time making cheesecake, but I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out PERFECTLY. The results got rave reviews from everyone who sampled it, even one guy who hates cheesecake.

Each year my church (which has almost 1,000 members) has a chocoalte festival where people bring all things chocolate and they are judged, awards given and then we all enjoy. This recipe won me the grand prize! I made some changes suggested by another review (Kerri). I left out the cinnamon. I also added cocoa powder, cream and melted chocolate to the batter. I skipped the sour cream and marbled the top with dark and white chocolate ganache. This was the best chocolate cheesecake i've every had. I had people compare it to restaurant quality.

what a great dessert!! very easy to make, very pretty to look at. i had read that there were issues cutting the cake after the chocolate was put on. i waited a day for the cake to set, then put the chocolate on the top and cut right away.  my first cheesecake that i "baked" and it turned out perfect.

Fantastic. Everyone loved it. I needed more time to break mine all the way through, and ran short on cooling/refridgeration time but even though the middle was more pudding-like it still tasted wonderful and I loved how the botom looks like one big oreo.  I will omit the cinnamon next time. Definitely will make again and again.

This is the first baked cheesecake I've made and it's so amazing! I made it exactly as the recipe said and am so pleased with it! I haven't had a cheesecake this good in a long long time. It's rich, creamy, sweet, decadent, tastes like it cost $20 or more at the store. I love how it has layers and I wouldn't change anything about it. It did take quite awhile to make but was so worth it. And it makes a huge cake also, I used a 10 inch springform pan and it went right up to the top of it!

Cake tastes good.  But recipe makes way too much batter for pan so I had to leave sour cream layer out even though I bought the ingredients and prepared it. Sides are messy looking so I decided to cover the whole cake with ganache. Recipe made too much ganache by the way. I had to bake it much longer than directions, about 15-20 mins more. The recipe was hugely time consuming and problematic.  I topped the cake with white chrysanthemum blooms and leaves and entered it in a chocolate challenge contest.  Guess who won first place?! It was difficult but in the end, rewarding. Cake disappeared in 5 minutes!

Turned out fantastic - more of a fluffy cheesecake as opposed to a “dense” heavy cheesecake.  Very decadent and a hit with our party.

It was delicious although I forgot to add the cinnamon to the cookie crust no one knew it. I'm giving FOUR stars because the directions say it takes 1.5 hrs prep/cook time but it took me 3 hours to complete! I thought I was being efficient by mixing items while the cake was baking, etc.  but I don't think the recipe includes cool times in the total time which was deceiving for me to make this on a work night. It's a delicious cheesecake just be sure you allot yourself enough time to make it from start to finish.

Lovely recipe! I omitted the cinnamon in the crust (not my thing) and tossed in some extra butter recommended from other reviews. Due to only having a 9inch pan and not a 10 inch, I ended up halving the sour cream layer, so definitely pay attention to the size of your pan (I knew mine was smaller than called for going in).  I think next time I'll also reduce the amount of ganache on top. I love ganache, but cheesecake is so rich that this much ganache puts it just over the edge of too much.

I made this almost exactly the way the recipe reads but I used chocolate graham crackers instead of cookies and I also omitted the cinnamon from the crust. We had it for dessert on Fathers Day and everyone loved it! Because it’s so thick you can probably serve about 12 people with a nice size slice, especially since it’s so rich. I had to travel with it to the dinner so I left it in the spring form until we served it and placed it in a cooler to keep it cold. I will definitely revisit this recipe again and again.

It was just okay. It really didn’t taste like Oreos, even though I put extra in. And the sour cream layer is odd and adds absolutely nothing to the cake. It’s just unnecessary and out of place. The ganache layer was too thick and added too much bitterness. A different ganache recipe might have been better, or left off altogether as it clashed with the sweet creaminess of the cheesecake.

I have made this several times with my kids.  What a simple easy to make quality dessert that looks and taste amazing!  My kids like to play with the filling and use different cookies from time to time.  They also use whatever crust we have in house whether it be graham crackers or animal cracker crumbs.  No fuss! No water bath!  Who cares if there's a crack, you're topping it anyway.  If your hating on this recipe your an Idiot!  Make it an Enjoy !!!

Wow.  This was a lot of work, and I thought it would be a one time deal, but once I tasted it, I decided it was totally worth the effort.  I will, however, no longer complain about  a professionally made cheesecake being too expensive!  I left out the cinnamon in the crust, and used 3T butter.  The butter dripped from the pan during baking, so I need to put  a cookie sheet under it next time.  10 Oreos = 1 cup.  I have a 9" pan, so I used a small pan for some overflow ingredients.  I used low fat cream cheese, and just bought 1 cup whipping cream (used skim milk to make up the extra 1/3 cup needed for the ganache).  Kept cookies in chunks for in the cake, and used food processor to do the crust.  I forgot to add the vanilla to the ganache, but it was not missed.

This recipe is not very informative with the directions so there is definitely a bit of trial and error but overall the ingredient combination/ proportion seemed ok. Next time i would leave out the cinnamon, that completely ruined the crust for me.

An awesome cheesecake that everyone loved. If you only have a 9" pan, adjusting the servings to 12 instead of 14 works out well, but remember that it only adjusts the measurements at the top and not in the text of the recipe.

I made this yesterday for a Christmas Eve party.  It was a huge success.  I highly recommend this if you really want to impress at your next potluck.  Only chance I made was only using 1/2 tsp of cinnamon in the crust.

This cheesecake is always a favorite for my family.  They look for it each holiday.  I would suggest lowering the amount of cinnamon that you add to the crust.  I only use about a half teaspoon.  It's awesome!

Wish I read all the reviews prior to baking.  All was going well until the sour cream layer...when that was put on the uncooked cheesecake oozed out everywhere.  After reading some reviews I saw many increased cooking time or omitted the sour cream layer, hoping for the best...

This turned out to be the best cheesecake I ever made. I made this for a Christmas party at my job and I almost didn’t get any. I have been asked to make this again because as one person states, “it blew his socks off!”

Made this for a NYE party and it was a hit! The video instructions say to use chocolate graham crackers or other similar cookie for the crust - NOT Oreos or other cookies w filling. I did this and it turned out delicious! Bigger cookie (Oreo) chunks in the middle layer were yummy. The only addition was that I added 1 t of instant expresso powder to the chocolate ganache layering top which gave it a slightly darker & delicious finish. Great recipe & very decadent. Oh, and as other reviewers said, wait an hour or so for the cheesecake to cool and it will settle down an inch in the pan so you have room to pour the chocolate on top.

The cake didn't bake for me. I was hoping for the cake to get stiff after baking it in the oven for over an hour, but even after that he was still all liquid. I did everything right, following the original recipe and I was really disappointed with the result I got. Even though my friends liked it, it was the worst cake that I have ever made. But no offense, maybe I have made some mistakes.

Good, but great with a couple modifications. The top chocolate layer is overpowering and took over the flavor of the cheesecake (too much of a good thing). I would instead recommend not making the top layer and serving with chocolate topping (people can add as much or little as they like). I also didn't make the sour cream layer as the cake seemed to be too much (too many ingredients and too sweet). It's fantastic with the crust, cheesecake layer with cookie pieces in between! I also don't add cinnamon but that's personal preference. Will make again!

Totally worth the calories. Make sure you scrape the creme from the cookies used for the crust.  I also left out the cinnamon-it seemed out of place.

I LOVE this dessert. It is very rich, and I make it with neufachtel cream cheese! I have made it in a springform pan, divided the recipe into 2 pie pans, and even made it in mason jars in an oven bath. Every time it has been a hit and delicious! I like to make it on mason jars bc it makes 6-8 pint size jars and it freezes very well that way. My husband's friends brought their pie pans back and requested a refill. My father in law asked my mother in law to get the recipe because it is the best dessert he has ever had. My mom ate her mason jar in one sitting... I don't know how she did that because it is RICH! This is a family&friends favorite and going in the front page of my dessert cookbook! The only things I do differently are 1) I use neufachtel cream cheese as I already mentioned and 2) I do omit the cinnamon in the crust as others have suggested. It doesn't go well with the other flavors IMO.

Unfortunately, although I have made many different cheesecakes before, this one didn't turn out for me. Followed the instructions to the letter after printing out the recipe. After baking for 45 at 350, I proceeded to add the sour cream topping, but it all sunk into the middle of the cake! Put it back in the oven as the middle must not have been set at all, so don't know how I goofed up. Any body help for next time? Thanks a bunch. Been baking for 35 years, this has never happened before.  Bummer.

This is what we make every year for Christmas and if I didn't bring it, I'd be in big trouble. I tried to cheat and use store made Oreo pie crust. Don't do it. Just leave out the cinnamon and make it yourself. The chocolate topping is a little too stiff, so cut out a few of the chips when melting. This is a super rich and delicious cheesecake!

This is fantastic. I'm always leery of recipes that have steps after a certain number of minutes (versus conditions - my oven always seems to require longer). I followed this recipe exactly as written, and it turned out great. I did have to wait until the next day to add the ganache, because the pan was too full when the cheesecake was hot.  I highly recommend!

I made this as specified for my husband for Father's Day. No substitutes or alterations. It was perfect in every way and was quite a hit with the entire family. Not a real cheesecake fan normally, but this one totally rocks the cheesecake world! I even converted some not-a-cheesecake-fan co-workers. New family favorite for special occasions. Well worth the time and effort.

This was my first time doing a cheese cake and everyone loved it. The thing is that I wish I've put less whipping cream for the chocolate syrup. It took really long for at least half to dry but it still tasted great.

I made a regular cheesecake without any chocolate, just add the topping from sweat potatoes cheesecake recipe. Sugar, butter and walnuts. It was amazing. It was my mother in law birthday and I made this cake first time in my life. My mother and father in law can not stop eating it. Love it! It will be my special recipe

I followed this recipe and I was not disappointed at all. It was a true hit at my family party! Although the process is long, it is well worth the wait. The two layers of cookie crumbs plus the chocolate ganache at the top really take the cheesecake to the next level. I will definitely be baking it again!

I made this with low fat cream cheese and in a 9-inch springform pan. I didn't quite use 2 lbs of cream cheese which was probably good because of the pan size. Couldn't add all of the sour cream mixture either. However, in the end it was very good and enjoyed by all.

Amazing cheesecake! Definitely worth the wait. I wouldn't make it though unless you're serving at least 6 people. I made it for me and and my boyfriend for his birthday because he LOVES cheesecake and we had leftovers for 2+ weeks. Delicious though. The topping was a little lumpy, but still delicious.

I have never made cheesecake before. This turned out looking like I brought it home form the Cheesecake Factory. On top of it, it was AMAZING!! I did add a chocolate ganache to it because it was for my dad's birthday and he loves chocolate, and I would alter the crust a bit. Don't pack it down into the pan as much as it says, the crust was a little too rock hard.

this is my 1st cheesecake in 10 years(the one ten years ago was terrible). i follow the recipe accordingly, except for cutting down a bit of the sugar, as my family prefer less sweet cakes. and i omitted the sour cream layer as i dont have any at the moment. and it turn out beautifully, and the taste is amazing. im kinda proud of myself. oh, i do add more butter for the crust as suggested by some reviewers, and use waterbath, which i think makes the cake looks more like store bought. dont be intimidated by the waterbath, it does help make the cake not crack. this recipe is a keeper.

This is a fair amount of work but tasted great the anticipation of waiting for it to cool was exciting.  I ended letting it cool overnight before putting the chocolate top on and that worked out

I thought it was excellent and a lot of fun to make. I am not sure I really like the consistency of the sour cream topping. I may leave it out next time or maybe try adding chocolate mouse in it's place. Other than that it is fabulous. I will definitely be making this again.

2 rows of oreos was 3 1/2 cups. used 4 cr cheese, 1 cup sugar, 4 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla. baked 55 minutes with water bath underneath. 60 minutes too long maybe. no cinnamon. whole chunks of oreo in middle layer. no chocolate sauce on top. for minis-use whole cookies as crust. maybe drizzle melted chocolate over top and top with cool whip.

This was definately a great tasting cheesecake, but it had a lot of steps to it and it took a good part of a day to make. If I made it again I might omit the sour cream layer. I followed the recipe exactly how it was printed.

Combining cheesecake and Oreos into one dessert is a genius idea if I've ever heard one.  I did what one person suggested and left bigger chunks for the cookies in the middle, which I think was a great switch.  Also, needed more cookies for the crust.  Melted choc chips, put in a plastic bag with a tiny piece of the corner cut off to drizzle on top (thought it would be too chocolately otherwise) and it was so tasty!  My friend requested it as her new official birthday cake :)

Made this one twice over the holidays and got rave reviews both times.  Second time, though, I had run out of Oreos, so I used some homemade ginger cookies in the filling portion and it actually was even better than all Oreos.

This recipe is fabulous and so easy!  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out soo perfect.  Everyone ranted and raved over it.  Its extremely rich and decadent--a small sliver will do but it will keep you coming back for more.  It also looks beautiful.

This recipe is great! Everyone that had it raved and loved it. I only changed three things in the recipe per some other reviews: I took out the cream filling in the oreos before crushing the cookies to make the crust, I added the creme filling from the oreos to the cheesecake batter, and I didn't add cinnamon to the crust. The recipe was easy to follow and even my husband who doesn't like cheesecake, liked this!

I can not tell you how many people ask me to make this recipe for them.  Our house has probably had this cheesecake at least 20 times in the past year!  Definetly one of our favorites!

Being a novice cook, especially for desserts, I was worried about prepareing this.  It was particularily easy and the most delicious cheesecake I have ever had.

Definitely have to try this one.

I made this for my brother, cheesecake is his favorite dessert, it was loved by all and was quickly eaten up, I will definitely make this again, just as is, would also be good just with the crust and cheesecake,,,well worth the effort

Great recipe, first time I made it, it went so fast I didn't even get to taste it!!   So I had to make it again...makes a beautiful presentation too.  Don't be scared off by the several step prep...it's easy, just follow the steps...even for a beginner.  I also left out the cinnimon, thought it would be a little overkill....This ones a winner TRY IT.

I took this to a gathering with friends.  Most said it was delicious, but I thought it was entirely too rich.

This cheesecake is so decadent and delicious that you will need to serve it in small servings or else it will fill you up too quickly! Also, the chocolate ganache layer on top is very thick so I would recommend cutting it in half.

I liked the cheesecake allot. But I made the mistake of cooking it a too small pan, other than that it was great. But next time I might not add the sour cream or chocolate glaze topping, The cheesecake itself was enough.
