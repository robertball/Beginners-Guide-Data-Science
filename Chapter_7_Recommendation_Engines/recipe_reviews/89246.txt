This recipe has to find more cooks!  I had a plain sirloin pork roast that i was cooking and wanted to do something different.  since there was no bone, I wanted there to be some juice for it to be moist.  Oh my goodness, is this the best!  I had no time to do the bacon part so skipped that, I had no tomatoe paste so used extra tomatoe sauce and used dried parsley instead of fresh, otherwise followed directions exactly.  my picky 9 yr old loved it as did myself and my husband.  This is a fabulous way to prepare pork and I recommend it for anyone who reads these, do not be shy that only 10 people have rated this!!

This is an amazing meal! I used a slow cooker instead of the oven, added 3/4 t rosemary, an onion and a little more wine than what the recipe showed. Unbelievably tender and tasty!!! I cut the roast with a wooden spoon! I wished I had added more carrots because they were just as amazing!

I used this recipe as a guide to make red wine boneless pork chops.  I skipped the bacon drippings, butter, bay leaf and carrots.  I cooked the mushrooms in half a cup of red wine until they were soft and then put them in a bowl along with another cup of red wine, the garlic, parsley, 1/4 tsp salt, pepper, tomato paste, and sugar.  I then browned the chops in a little bit of olive oil and poured the mixture over them.  Cooked it all on medium low heat for about 20-30 minutes.  The chops were extremely tender and flavorful.  I was really impressed how the red wine tenderized the meat.  Iâ€™ll have to try it with a roast some time.  Thanks!

This pork roast was fantastic. I followed the recipe and the roast was very tender and flavorful. The gravy was very rich and tasty, and the bacon grease adds so much flavor. Everyone raved about it and I will definitely make it again!

I made this recipe adding a bit more of wine and it was absolutely delicious, even for a non experienced cooker as I am this was almost perfect!

I would leave the pork marinating for some time or maybe cook slower to make the pork absorb the sauce better

This was very good - cooked perfectly - the wine/mushroom sauce was yummy - I used a hearty burgundy wine and it was really good over rice.

As others have said, don't let the number of raters scare you off, this is AMAZING!!!!!  My husband usually doesn't like roasts (odd, I know) but he raved over this and can't wait until I make it again.  I made one small change because we didn't have tomato paste on hand.  I used ketchup instead and omitted the sugar. (figured it was in the ketchup)  YUM, excellent recipe thanks for sharing.

I have made this recipe twice now to fantastic results.  I used a Beaujolais that paired wonderfully with the pork.  I also used a bone in roast that created a "sweeter" taste to the meat.  The pan sauce created a wonderful rich gravy that everyone loved.  I increase the amount of mushrooms as they cook down quite a bit and the vegetables were just a popular as the roast.

I made this for dinner last night and my boyfriend is still talking about how great it was this morning! I used a slow cooker with a 2.5lb roast, cooking it for 6 hours (adding mushrooms at the beginning rather than waiting until the end of cooking). The meat was very tender, juicy and flavorful. I cut up a couple pieces of the bacon after frying and added them to the sauce. The only red wine I had was a shiraz, which worked just fine. I also used cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end, and we served it over spaetzle noodles along with a freshly baked Light Oat Bread (found on this site). We will definitely be making this again and again!

I made this recipe in the slowcooker and it was absolutely delicious, extremely flavorful. I added some rosemary, thyme, oregano, honey (instead of sugar), and a little bit of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Poured it all over sliced mushrooms, carrots, onions, baby butterball potatoes, garlic, shallots and the pork -- cooked on low for about 7 hours (3-4 hours on high). Served with a side of parmesan polenta. Perfect!

This was wonderful!  I substituted dried parsley for fresh and, like another reviewer, I did not have tomato paste on hand so I added some chopped slightly overripe tomatoes.  The meat was fork tender and the flavor was wonderful. A definite keeper!

Used 1/2 jar of tomato sauce instead of tomato paste and skipped the bacon drippings bc we didn't have any bacon... Topped it on chicken and baked it for about 45 mins at 350. SO GOOD!!! My guy hates wine, but LOVED this sauce. Will definitely make this again.

FABULOUS!!!  This was great!  I used sun-dried tomato paste for the paste and cooked pork in bacon grease seasoned with garlic salt.  I also added some bacon chunks to sauce.  AWESOME!  Served with homemade mashed potatoes - - - a keeper!!!!

Quite good, but I only added 1 tablespoon of butter and probably shouldn't have added that because there was quite a bit of grease, so 4 stars are given because 1/4 cup of butter plus the bacon grease would have been wayyy too much, in my opinion.  Served over egg noodles.  Made with a $4 cabernet wine and would like to try again with a somewhat sweeter wine. Now...how do I get the pan clean?  :)

Absolutely delicious!  The vegetables and sauce really complimented the pork well.  My husband said it was worthy of a fine restaurant.  I'll be adding this to my menu the next time my mother-in-law comes over!

Sorry, but I don't know what all the fuss is about. I followed the directions totally, but my roast was still pink after the time stated. Perhaps my pan was too big, but the juices were barely enough to cover the bottom after about one hour, so I needed to add more liquid to keep from burning. The best part about this was the carrots. I will not be making this again.

This was pretty good... the sauce was very flavorful, I loved the combination of mushrooms and wine with the seasonings... I wasn't too sure about the combination of tomato paste + carrots and the rest... but I loved that part of it...unfortunately the roast was a tad dry.  I sliced up the leftovers and heated in the sauce which I supplemented with a cup of beef bouillon because I wanted more of the meat submerged and that seemed to tenderize it a little.  I would be tempted to try this as a beef dish.

YUMMY !!!!  this was VERY GOOD!  the only thing I did different was cook the mushroom on top of the stove in some of the pan drippings (they would have been too dried out otherwise). I will definitely make this again (well, I kind of have to since my dh told me to make it again next Sunday !)!   Good with plain old mashed potatoes and green beans.

I tried this. It was ok, but not great! If I ever made it again, I would probably use less tomato paste. Good, but not great!

Promised my 26 yr. old steaks for his birthday but made this instead.  It was a major hit with everyone at dinner - my presentation was a bit different as I diced the carrots (I think it was prettier as the mushrooms were most the focus).  It was very pretty, aromatic, moist and delicious.  It will definitely make the favorites rotation.

I made this recipe last week and I'm still telling family and friends about it.  It was so good, my family and I wanted to lick the plate clean.  I added one step to the recipe and that was making a gravy from the juice of the roast after it was cooked. I used cornstarch to thicken and poured the gravy over the slices of roast. Beautiful.

Made this 2 nights ago and was so disappointed that I wasted 2 hours for the most bland pork i ever had. I really thought that the garlic, sugar, herbs, and of course the wine, would really get soaked up in to the meat making it both sweet and rich...but I was wrong...it was bland! My boyfriend loved it though-of all the 4 pork chops I made he will end up eating 3 because I cannot bare to eat another piece.

We love this recipe.  I added an extrat clove or two of garlic and half a cup more of wine.  It makes great leftover sandwiches and adding some flour makes a great thick gravy.

We absolutely loved the flavor of Red Wine Pork! I made a couple substitutions because I was lacking ingredients: no butter, dried parsley, a couple tablespoons sun dried tomato pesto instead of tomato paste, and tawny port wine (no sugar - figured it was already sweet). Yum! Will definitely make it again!

This is my first time ever reviewing a recipe on this site, but I just HAD to, because I can't say enough how wonderful this was!! We did a 4 lb pork sirloin roast and adjusted cooking time accordingly. The only other change we made was that we used dry parsley instead of fresh. For the wine, we used Merlot. Won-der-ful!!!! Insanely tender. The sauce thickened up nicely with corn starch for a very tasty gravy. Even my picky kids loved it!! This will become a favorite at our house.

This was an "oh-my-gosh" dish. I served it with noodles, but the family got bread to soak up the juice, it was that good. I was worried that the salt was too much but it cooked into the meat and was perfect. The recipe didn't say whether to cover the meat or not when cooking, so I covered it with foil for the first part of cooking, then left it off after I put the mushrooms in. Came out better than expected. I highly recommend this dish.

This was the best pork loin to ever come from my oven. The only change I made was the addition of some chopped, fresh rosemary. This will be part of my regular repertoire of main dishes. Wonderful!

I changed things up to make do with what I had on hand.  I had 1" thick chops, so I coated them with a mixture of flour, salt and pepper.  I used olive oil rather than bacon drippings, to brown the chops on all sides. (I did all this in a cast iron skillet.)  After browning the chops I removed them to a plate, and made the sauce.  I used a very sweet (dessert) wine, so I eliminated the need to add the sugar.  I also substituted dried parsley for fresh.  I had some canned mushrooms here (which was disappointing; I would have preferred fresh).  None the less, I drained them and made them the last addition to the sauce, before adding the chops back in and spooning sauce over them.  I popped the skillet in the oven for 30 minutes.  In hind sight, I would have only popped them in for 20-25 minutes.  Overall, this rendition of the recipes was quite good!

We did not care for this at all.  I made it for a dinner party and NO ONE enjoyed it.  It just had no flavor at all.  The sauce helped a tad - a waste of money and time.

Great basic recipe but made it even better with a few additions/changes. Added onions and some peppers to the carrots and sauteed them for a while with the garlic and butter before adding the wine (2 cups). Also added a cup of beef broth and full small can of tomato paste. This resulted in a lot more sauce and veggies with a great basic tomato/wine taste.

I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and I loved it (our five-year old wasn't as enthusiastic).  I had some leftovers for lunch at the office - it smelled so good that a couple of my co-workers asked for the recipe.  I think it's a great dish for adults but maybe not too kid-friendly (unless your kid enjoys the flavour of red wine).

My husband made this for our at home date. This is the best thing I have EVER tasted. He used La Vielle Ferme red wine which was like $8. Don't know if that matters. Seriously, I want this every night for the rest of my life.

Kudos to Harriet!  I was looking for a recipe on this site for a pork roast that didn't involved BBQ sauce.  This one was excellent (!) and my husband told me to be sure and save it.  I followed the recipe for the most part; added some chopped potatoes and apples when I put in the carrots because I need to eat more vegetables/fruit.  Used an Argentinian Malbec as my red wine, plus a little water so I would have plenty of au jus.  Don't replace the bacon grease or butter as they create the wonderful flavor in this dish.

Absolutely delicious and the family all loved it! As a matter of preference, I don't typically use sugar when I am cooking if I can avoid it, so I added an onion (which has its own natural sweetness instead). I also decided to roast potatoes in the roasting pan with the carrots and pork, which were wonderfully delicious with that scrumptious sauce that is given above. You may want to consider allowing for a little more sauce if you put potatoes as they absorb a good bit of the sauce.

Very easy! I ended up adding more carrots (just used baby carrots) and onions.  I melted the butter with the garlic and threw all of it in a ziploc bag in the fridge for about 4 hours.  Then I poured it in a crockpot and let it cook on high for a few hours.  The pork was so tender!  My 5-year-old had three servings!

I made this in my new pressure cooker since I wanted to try it out.  I added a lot more carrots and garlic than called for and also added onion and celery.  I sauteed the mushrooms in the bacon grease since I don't care for boiled mushrooms. I omitted the tomato paste as I didn't have any but I can see how it would add to the complexity of the flavor.  The flavor of the cooking liquid didn't get into the meat very much at all but I might try marinating the roast next time.  The veggies, on the other hand, were absolutely delicious.  DOn't be afraid to use lots and lots of carrots since they are delightful - I added 5 large carrots and I think next time I'd add more!

3.5 Stars: I liked this more than anyone else in my house.  The meat did not pick up a lot of flavor.  IF I make it again, I will marinate it overnight. The carrots did not get done, either. I did not use mushrooms.

Very, very tasty! The sauce is amazing. I made this with a butt roast (shoulder) which was a mistake as it needed to slow cook for hours. Next time I will make with a roast cut. I also agree with the other reviewer who said to add more carrots...you can easily double or triple the number of carrots. I did not dice mine as the recipe says, just sliced into chunks.  Really delicious!

Made this tonight for dinner and it was horrible. I don't know if I had a bad piece of meat or what, but it was just nothing special at all. I don't know what all the other reviewers did differently, I mean I followed the recipe exact. Just bad luck.

Fantastic recipe!  I followed it exactly and it tasted wonderful.  I did have to cook the roast for about 2 hours in the oven instead of 1 1/2 but the sauce and flavor were fantastic.  And it was really easy to make as well.  Will definitely make this again.

This was very good!  I used shortening instead of bacon drippings because that's what I had available.  Also I added more vegetables - doubled the carrots, added onion and potatoes.  I used a super cheap pinot noir for the wine.  It was delicious!  Even the picky 3-year-old cleaned his plate.

Wow!  I made this tonight and we loved it!  The only changes I made were to use four peeled whole carrots instead of diced and I added three tablespoons of fresh thyme.  I threw in some fingerling potatoes halfway through the cooking time. This reminds me of a hunter chicken recipe that I've made for years.  Thanks so much for sharing!! A definite keeper.

I used a pork loin roast.  I added extra mushrooms, added the bacon used to render the bacon fat, served it all with gnocci...absolutely delicious & super tender!  We could literally cut it with a fork.  My hubby & I both ate two servings & were stuffed.  Will be making again & again.

The pork turned out very nice, but it was generally too bland for my taste.

Yum! Yum! Yum! This turned out terrific!  Very moist and tender.  I didn't have any red wine so I used sherry.  I also didn't have mushrooms so I just left them out.  I cooked it with a cover although it didn't say to do so.  Next time, I'll use foil as the lid got really dirty,  Definately a keeper and I am not a big meat eater.  I may use a variation of the recipe just for the carrots sometimes too.
