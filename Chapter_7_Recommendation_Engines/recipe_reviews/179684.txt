Have made this twice now, both times with broccoli instead of asparagus. I recommend adding as much as double the sauce.

very good and easy to make.. and suprisingly not bad for you since I used fat free cream cheese. But I did have to double the cream cheese and broth we like to have more sauce and I substituted the Penne and used Bow Tie past instead. And added red pepper just to spice it up a bit more.  Yum!!

This was tasty.  I changed up the vegetables a bit to use what I had in the fridge; green pepper, mushrooms, zucchini, green onions, tomatoes, and spinach.  I also cooked the chicken and veggies in some oil instead of salad dressing as I had a dry italian pack and just added it in as I cooked them.  The only other thing I did different was to add a dash or two of Worcestershire.  Overall a very yummy, simple dish.

I didn't have all the veggies called for so I used some frozen peas and carrots instead. It still turned out really good. I like it both hot and cold!

I love the idea of this recipe, especially the vegetables and the cream cheese base. But for some reason, my sauce came out too watery - I wonder if this was a common thing amongst other recipe makers or maybe I didn't let it simmer long enough. Anyway, the only things I changed was added a small vine tomato (will probably use roma or cherry tomatoes next time around), and used a green pepper instead of red. It was an interesting taste.

This was like Chicken Helper with a twist.  I liked the semi-unusual flavor!  We were out of pasta so I used long-grain white rice and the only fresh veggies (although they're actually a fruit) I had on hand were yellow squash and zucchini.  I also used extra italian dressing and did not have any "light," "low-sodium," or "calorie-wise" ingredients. It was yummy!

It was yummy and simple.  I chopped up the veggies the night before.  Didn't use asparagus, instead used celery and mushrooms.  I headed up Italian Garlic Marinade & oil and saut√©ed the chicken with some onion before adding the veggies.  Finally, I added just some fresh nutmeg to season since the marinade with seasoned/salty enough.

Just tried this for the first time. Family was happy. Kids loved it. My veggies were white onions, mushrooms, & red bell pepper cut into small pieces so kids wouldn't notice. Also, I had to add more cream cheese for extra sauce & one table soon of flour for a thicker sauce.

This has become a go-to dinner for me. I'm not shy with the Italian dressing. Sometimes I switch it up and shred the chicken instead of cubing it.

This was pretty good. I doubled the sauce but also had extra vegetable in the pasta. I added some shredded carrot and subbed yellow pepper for red. I also used fake crab instead of chicken. I used full fat ingredients. I will make this again.

AN OVERALL DELIGHT...This was the 1st dish I decided to make since joining the site. I found it to be quite tasty and my children who are normally picky eaters asked for seconds. the portion size was awesome, enough for seconds and left overs for lunch the next day. I did alter the recipe just a pinch by using garden rotini pasta (the kids love the colors) and doubling the milk.

This was such a good mix of flavors and didn't feel so bad eating it with the veggies. I used whole wheat pasta instead. Doubled the broth and cream cheese which didn't thicken enough.  So I pulled four ladles full of the sauce and mixed it separately in a bowl with flower making sure all the lumps were whisked out before re-adding it back to the pasta. I then simmered the pasta  on low for another 3 to 5 minutes to cook the flower. That correction made the sauce perfect.

I really liked this recipe,I used all the same incredients and it tasted fantastic, the only thing is that I would try to make the sauce a little bit thicker next time, but definitely going to add this to my favorites list.

I enjoyed this recipe and would recommend giving it a try.  It could use just a little spice though.  I'll throw in some pepper flake or season salt next time.  Also, I used bow tie vs penne pasta.

This was a great recipe to incorporate some veggies I needed to use up. I took other reviewers advice and doubled the sauce and glad I did. I also added some red pepper flakes for a little kick but still fealt the dish could use a bite more seasoning. With a little tweaking this is a keeper.

We really liked this recipe - it was quick & easy, and very tasty.  I omitted the asparagus (not in season and what store had was pitiful looking) and just doubled up on the zucchini.  I also added about 1 tbsp of basil paste as well.
