I thought this Bloody Mary was AMAZING, but then again nothing is too spicy for me! I left out the carrot, bell pepper, and mint. Franks Red Hot is the BEST for bloody Marys. Only thing I added was a dash of Lawry's Seasoned Salt and a pickle wedge(with a splash of pickle juice). I DO NOT recommend this if you are watching your sodium!

I made a Virgin Mary with this recipe by omitting the vodka. Excellent, spicy hot and refreshing!

Delicious! I'm not a big fan of Horseradish, so I omitted that, but followed the recipe otherwise. I will never make a Bloody Mary any other way...Thanks for sharing!

I was quite surprised at how good this tasted!  My husband omitted the horseradish and the "garnishes" but it was great!  I'm not a big fan of most drinks, but I actually liked this. :D

Excellent!  I love Bloody Mary's and this is a full body drink recipe.  I'm not sure if the carrot, cellery and olives are garnish or not, but if they are to add taste I wonder if there is a substitute if not then they add a nice look to it!  Thanks for sharing this one.

Absolutely perfect. A bloody mary isn't complete for me without the horseradish. I combined this recipe with the Wild River Bloody Mary recipe on this site. I made the Wild River mix the night before, then prepared with the rest of the ingredients as written in this recipe in the morning. Delish!

Perfect! I love a spicy bloody mary. For another layer of spice I add a pinch of wasabi powder, the secret ingredient from a bar I once worked at. Also, for the hot sauce I use cholula, my favorite.

This uses my favorite ingredients for a Bloody Mary! I didn't have spicy V8, so I used regular. I added Old Bay, lemon pepper and a bit more Red Hot & horseradish. Didn't use all the garnishes, just the olives, why waste the space in the glass! ;)

This is how I make mine. Only I use half V8 and half Hot and Spicy V8 with some olive juice.I also use 3 queen olives, celery seed,garnish with cracked black pepper. Everyone loves them! Also good without the vodka.

I had to tweak this a lot to get it where I wanted it. Added more horseradish, some olive juice...etc. honestly had to change so much I lost track. Good starting point recipe but def not amazing.
