My mother used to make a sauce like this for pancake syrup.  It was my favorite syrup as a kid.  I'm happy to have found the recipe again.  This sauce has many uses. We used it over pancakes. I added ginger to leftover sauce and cooked with carrots for orange-ginger carrots. (very yummy!) I also used leftover sauce with red pepper flakes for orange-spicy chicken.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a delicious sauce with a number of uses as the previous reviewer stated: pancake and waffle syrup, ice cream topping, over pound and angel food cake, in fowl recipes such as Duck Ala Orange, etc. I cut the butter by 2T and it was still yummy. Thickens as it cools. Thanks Ann.

I made this to go with the Basic Crepes recipe from this website and drizzled it over banana slice-filled crepes, and then topped with sliced strawberries.  It was very good.  I was thinking it might be useable with chicken, so thanks to the other reviewers for your ideas and thanks, Ann, for sharing your recipe.

This sauce was a great compliment to my vanilla crepes and whipped cream.  Almost tasted like eating a creamsicle!  I put the left over sauce in a canning jar and refrigerated it. I used it a few days later, it was great!

I can't give this recipe 5 stars because I didn't have the frozen juice concentrate.  HOWEVER, I did have fresh tangelos that were fresh picked from my parents tree in Florida and that made all the difference.  The taste was soooo good!!! My sauce was filled with orange pulp and was thin but sweet!

I agree that this sauce is a little too sweet.  I made it to drizzle on top of scones, but found it too overpowering.  It becomes as thick as paste in the fridge, and when reheated separates.  Probably quite good on ice cream, however.

This was perfect after I made some changes: I used OJ rather than concentrate, 1/3 c sugar, 2 tbsp. butter, 1/4 c honey, and 1 tsp. cornstarch. This produced a sauce that wasn't too sweet, and was nice and velvety. Before these changes, it was much too sweet and a bit thin.

I made this sauce with orange-mango juice for a fun, tropical twist for crepes. It was good, but my husband could tell from the taste that it was made from a juice concentrate, and didn't like that about it.

I doubled this, but really didn't need to....it made enough...but now I have a large mason jar of it in the fridge and tonight I will make orange chicken with it...  The sauce is amazing...I didn't have concentrate so I fresh squeezed about a cup or 2 of fresh OJ and it worked great...its a thin sauce so for the chicken tonight I will thicken it with corn startch and a little soy sauce to make it more of a dinner sauce!

Tastes okay, but gets hard way too quickly to even bother serving to people.  I won't make it again.

My dad described it as tasting like orange marmalade. used regular orange juice with a heaping tablespoon of orange zest. Drizzled over dried shortcake and heated in microwave- shortcake was as good as new!

I avoid using corn syrups and would replace it in this recipe with a smaller amount of cane sugar or honey.

Very good. Very "orangey". The picture featured with the recipe looks kind of grainy, but the sauce is perfectly smooth and pours very well. Thumbs up!

I thought this was very good. I used the exact ingredients;however, I cut the recipe in half as it does make a lot. I used the sauce over Barbarella's German Pancake recipe, which I also got from this site.

REally liked this recipe but had to reduce the amount of sugar to 4 tbsp, replaced the corn syrup with 2tbs maple syrup, reduce butter by half and boiled it longer (15min) to reduce. Added zest of orange
