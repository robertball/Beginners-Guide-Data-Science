The trick to making this work is before putting it on the plastic wrap, is letting it set up a bit in the fridge  - maybe 5 or 6 minutes... I tried it twice EXACTLY like te recipe called for, and the chocolate was just too loose to roll. So, it dawned onme to try a few minutes in the fridge first, and voila!

I made this for my boyfriend who loves very dark chocolate. He took one bite and said "this is some serious chocolate".  He loves the soft smooth dark chocolate.

The taste is spot on with just the right amount of heat!!!  I could not however get the chocolate to set.  I tried twice.  I had to pour each batch into a pan and leave in the refrigerator over night.   I rolled them into truffles and even had to put the pan back into the refrigerator during the process as well as before coating with cocoa powder.

It is pretty good, but you need to add a teaspoon of wax to make the chocolates stay together. But the rest is pretty good ^^

I made this today for my husband for Valentineâ€™s Day. It was my first time making it and it turned out great! It was true that it was in a rather soft form when I tried to roll it up at first. I tried lifting the plastic wrap up on both long sides to help shape it better before rolling it up and that helped. It set up well in the fridge and in less than an hour, I was able to finish making it. The cocoa powder gives it a velvety texture on the outside with the inside being rich and silky smooth, the way dark chocolate should be!

Awesome.  Thank you, Chef John, for the recipe and the helpful video.  

Made as written except I wrapped the chocolate in parchment paper.  I left it in the fridge overnight and it was VERY easy to work with the next day.

The next time I made 4 batches with different flavors for gifts, but only had time to refrigerate them a few hours. The chocolate was too gooey to cut and had to be shaped.  Very time consuming, and I lost a lot of precious chocolate due to the sticky mess, but the effort was still worth the delicious results.

Love the recipe and will make them again - just a day ahead so they firm up.  FAST, EASY, and DELICIOUS when done like the video.

Not being a ice fan, my husband would not have appreciated the pepper part. They were excellent all the same. I'll have o make them for myself and friends, experimenting with pepper and other spices. Thank you!!!!
