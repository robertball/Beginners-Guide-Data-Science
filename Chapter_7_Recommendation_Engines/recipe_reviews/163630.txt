This was delicious! I quickly sauteed my asparagus. and I had no bouillon so I added a splash of chicken stock to the water (didn't really notice any difference in flavor from a regular poached egg, though).  I also used pepperjack cheese.  Very tasty and satisfying breakfast.

this was sooo much better than it sounded!! my sweety doesn't care for asparagus so he wilted spinach for under the eggs and used a plain yogurt with chives as a dressing over a toasted pumpernickel with the wilted spinach that was wilted in olive oil, volcanic sea salt from hawaii & a touch of fresh minced garlic! absolutely delicious!!

This recipe is easy.  I thought it needed something additional though so I made Hollandaise sauce to put on top.

This is a typical Italian lunch. We used Parmigiano Reggiano instead of cheddar. Thank you for the recipe.

Is is very good! The only thing I changed was to roast the asparagus with portabella mushrooms and olive oil for 15 minutes at 400•. healthy, simple, and delicious. Perfect.

Delicious.  I used sesame crackers instead of bread (watching my carbs), and a combination of chedder and shredded parmesan.  Also, I cooked the eggs a little bit longer so that the egg yolk turned hard, and I could thus easily eat just the egg whites.  Didn't have boullion, so I seasoned the water with salt, pepper and garlic powder.

This was delicious and easy- I sautéed my asparagus in extra virgin olive oil, salt and pepper for a couple minutes and spread soft havarti cheese instead of butter and it was just amazing! I've never poached an egg before, and was surprised at how easy it was- I was advised beforehand to add a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of any white vinegar to the simmering water before adding the eggs, which helps keep the whites together. It worked great, I will be making this again!

I made this for brunch and my fiance and I really like it.  I used Ezekiel bread, Swiss cheese and simply steamed the asparagus.  We of course dashed hot sauce over it before eating it.  Luxurious and healthy meal!  I will make it again! Yum!
