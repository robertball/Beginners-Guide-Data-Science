The really was delicious.  I made it last night--it was super easy and so creamy. I used light sour cream. The recommendation to top it with mozzarella and cover baked were good calls.  My kids were a bit skeptical of the spinach, but ate it anyways!!  You've gotta try it.

I made this for a church function, serving 100 people.  They loved it, and it couldn't be any easier. I follwed it exactly.  I assembled it a day ahead:  added some water to the pan before I baked it; kept the pan covered while I baked it.  It took a little longer because of the quantity and the fact that it was cold.  We have filed this recipe with the rest that our women's group use over and over.

Very good but not as creamy as I would have liked.  But to be fair, I think I used too much pasta (I don't always measure and didn't have the pasta in a box but a baggie).  It probably deserves a 5 star.  It did make TONS and is good and fairly inexpensive for college students and anyone.  Will half recipe next time and use less pasta to achieve the creaminess we desired.

This is real comfort food! I browned some ground beef with onions and garlic and mixed it in with the rest of the ingredients before baking for a great one dish supper. Penne pasta was good. It makes a TON though, halving the recipe made enough for my husband and I plus plenty leftover. I think it's even better warmed over the next day! I have also made it with browned Italian Sausage added to the mixture and it's very tasty! I like to top with a little mozarella also.

This was quite good..made a ton! Anxious to see how it is leftover.  Not as good as the Baked Ziti recipe but not everything can be THAT good! And this recipe got my spinach hating hubby and child to eat it. Will definitely make again.

This is a tasty recipe - I spiced it up w/italian seasonings for more flavor as the recipe doesn't call for any particular spices. The tin foil suggestion is a good one. I also used a creamy vodka red sauce in lieu of the traditional tomato & cream the recipe calls for - it makes it that much easier!

It’s creamy, warm, colorful, and soft. It’s also bland.  Perfect for picky eaters (who also happen to like spinach).  As others suggested, you may want to add a pound of Italian sausage to give it more appeal.

Excellent flavour, family loved it, and I only used condensed tomato soup instead of spaghetti sauce as I cannot handle a lot of spice.  I will use this recipe again.

This was a reallllly delicious dish that everyone wasted no time in devouring.  Very easy to prepare and uses ingredients commonly on hand around the house.  I added to the recipe by tossing the cooked pasta with olive oil, sprinking some oregano, and topping it off with lots of mozarella cheese.  Using the right pasta sauce will add a lot of flavor to the dish.  Best of all, this is one pasta dish that still tastes great the day after not dry or bland as leftover pasta usually does.

I'm not a huge fan of spinach, and I thought this recipe definitely had way too much.  I didn't think this dish was flavorful enough.  Will not be making again.

This was excellent!!  Sooo quick and easy, and delicious.  It was a great new taste to a baked pasta dish.  I printed this recipe 6 months ago and just made it last night, and now I'm mad it too me so long to try.  I think some mozz cheese on top and using tin foil was perfect, otherwise I didn't change/add anything and it was great.  I did make it 1/2 size though, and even that was enough for 2 meals for my husband and me.  A definate keeper!!

This was probably the easiest recipe to follow. Dinner was ready in no time. Everybody enjoyed it,including my mother who insisted on getting the recipe. The only changes that I made were to just add some of my fave spices and decrease the cheese. But overall good.

Not very original, but decent comfort food.  It is easy, inexpensive, and tasty.  I have taken this to several potluck lunches and not taken home  leftovers.  I usually add a pound of browned ground beef or sausage.  Shredde mozzerela is also good melted on top.

My family of six LOVED this recipe.  My children ages 13, 7, 5 & 3 all wanted seconds.  No one even complained about having to eat spinach.  Plus this recipe is so easy.  This will definitely become a new family favorite in our home.

This was pretty good, very quick and easy to make, and livened up just plain old pasta.  I added sauteed onions, garlic, mushrooms, and orange peppers.

Great recipe... My VERY picky kids loved it.  It will be a regular recipe in our house!  I used low fat sour cream, and substituted broccoli for the spinach.  Very quick and easy.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

Meh.  Mine didn't turn out creamy, which was a disappointment.  I used whole wheat penne, added some minced garlic, sprinkled with mozzarella and covered with foil.  This tasted OK but nothing special for us.

This was delicious!  I followed a suggestion by another reviewer and added sauteed onions and a ground beef substitute (I'm vegetarian) and used whole wheat rotini.  It was delicious -- the sauteed onions really made a difference!  Everyone loved it and this will definitely become one of my regular dishes to make.

I made 2 changes. First I added 1 pound hamburger meat and second I used a little less that the 16 oz. pkg of pasta. My family liked it and it was easy to make! Thanks for sharing.

I really liked this recipe. It was very easy and tasted very good. I did not give it four stars because it turned out a little dry.  I think I just need to adda a bit more sauce. I will definitely be making this again when I am short on time.

Very yummy!!  I was looking for a different recipe and this popped up on the front page.  It was simple to put together and tasted fabulous.  I liked having the spinach in it, gave it a nice color, flavor and texture.  Sprinkled the top with cheddar cheese before popping in the oven.  The picky non-spinach liking kids agreed the spinach didn't gross them out.  Will make this again for sure!

This was a really good recipe, but it was made better by adding italian seasoning, red bell pepper, sweet yellow onion and zucchini quartered and sliced. I baked in a casserole with mozzarella and foil over the top. Thanks for the starter!

I give this recipe 5 stars overall, my fiance gives it 3 (so we compromised and it rated it with four stars).  Very easy to make, and visually appealing.  I loved it - the flavor was really nice.  I'll make it again, but next time I'm going to try making only half.  The recipe as written makes a lot.

A small tip:  when baking the pasta in the oven, be sure to cover with tin foil so the pasta does not dry out.  Also, sprinkle shredded cheese on top to melt while baking.  Very good and filling.

This recipe was so simple to make! My husband loved it. He said it tasted like restaurant quality good. I thought it was pretty good for the simplicity of the recipe. I used Classico brand Spicy Tomato and Pesto spaghetti sauce (it was left over from last weeks spaghetti). Also, I sprinkled some of the parmesan cheese on top and I halved the noodles, the spaghetti sauce (all I had left), and the spinach...so same amt of sour cream and extra cheese. Yum!

This recipe was good...not great. But I did try to make it light so in all fairness I may have compromised the taste. I used whole wheat pasta instead of regular and I also sauteed the spinach with some onion and garlic. I also used 1/2cup of light sour cream instead of 1 cup and found it plenty creamy. I will definitely make it again as a quick easy meal.

Absolutely wonderful!  Made it exactly per recipe.  SOOO simple and soooo good.

Almost tastes like a stuffed manicoti.  Loved by this family!  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you for sharing.

I thought that this recipe was really quick and easy.  I deleted the spinach and added hamberger.  I also covered it with mozzarella chesse.  It's a keeper.

This is a fine recipe, but it didn't impress me.  I guess it's a good way to get picky kids and husbands to eat spinach, but I like plain pasta with spaghetti sauce better than this.  I ate it according to the recipe (with some extra sauce), and I added sausage for my husband's serving.  He wouldn't eat it without the sausage.

I think this is an excellent basic recipe for nights when you want something slightly different.  The key is using a good, flavorful pasta sauce (and real parmesan!); since the spices are going to be muted by all the sour cream, you'll want to use something that can really stand up for itself.  I also added hot Italian turkey sausage, about 1/4 cup of light cream (because we had it in the fridge, and so many people complained that the dish dried out), and baked it covered.  I sprinkled just a bit of mozzarella and more parmesan across the top, but I think it could have done without just as well.

Baking and cooking with pasta recipes for years....but I was very disappointed in this recipe.  I made it for Easter and it was not nearly as good as I thought it would be.  Sorry! I won't be making it again.

It was good. I made it with italian sausage, mozza cheese and rose sauce as opposed to tomato sauce. The sausage really helped give it a bite. The cheese might have been a bit too much. I would serve this again. I also think I used too much spinach (a whole container)

Wow. This dish was incredible. I didn't change a thing with the recipe. The only advise i have is to use the garden vegetable prego spaghetti sauce. It was oh so yummy.

This recipe is very basic and as suggested by many of the other reviewers, there are several things you can do to bring this dish to life.  Keeping to the simple theme, adding a can of diced tomatoes would do wonders to balance the flavors already present in this dish, as well as improve the texture and increase moisture

This is a really easy dish for college students!  My friend and I were starving and looking for something easy
to make and this was definitely it.  We didn't have any ingredients, so we went to Wal-Mart and bought everything
we needed for exactly 12.96.  Plus, you'll have so much left over you can eat at it for the better part of the week.
I doubt you'll be disappointed in any part of this dish, but especially taste and ease.  Go for it!

This recipe is very tasty and very easy to make.  I added grated mozza cheese on top and basil to the sauce.  Putting tin foil on top is a great idea as well
