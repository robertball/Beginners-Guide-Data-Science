I made a partial batch of this to see if it matched the cashew butter I've been buying.  It's close!  I did have to add a little more oil than called for, but that was just a personal option because it was probably good enough as written.  Thank you, Tony Carriere!  I'm happy to see how easy it was to make this!

Loved it. It's also good if you roast the cashews first, but as written, this is fantastic! Thank you for the recipe.

Make sure you have a good food processor and patience. I kept adding more oil because it wasn't smooth enough. Don't do that, cause then it will turn too oily.
