I was looking for a recipe with the ingredients listed, as I feel the yolks in the dressing makes for a great flavor.  I changed the following:  less sugar (about 3/4C).  Less vinegar (1/2C).  No milk. added 1/2 cup buttermilk ranch dressing.  I also used a difefrent macaroni shape. I refrigerated it for 4 hours before serving for the flavors to meld. I served it to guests and they loved it.

Made this for a picnic this afternoon.  Cut way backon vinegar and added to mustard.  Also added chopped Chives, green onion, chopped tomato, and some chopped broccoli I had in fridge.  I think you could add any fresh garden produce that you would like.  Cukes would be very good in this.

I have made enough macaroni salads to know there is a problem with the dressing ingredients.  With that in mind, I made this recipe as we like the combination of the other ingredients.  My changes were to cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup, and to add equal parts of milk and vinegar, but only enough to achieve the consistency I was looking for.  As written it would have been a 1 star - but adjusting the dressing, it was a 4 star for us.  **One note - in the submitters write-up, they suggest hard boiling the eggs with the macaroni.  That should never be done because of germs that might be on the outer egg shell.  Be safe and boil them in a separate pan.

This was just way too sweet! I was lucky to be able to drain the pasta in a colander and most of the sugary dressing came off.  I ended up adding a little more mayonnaise and some white vinegar to balance out the overly sweet taste.  Sorry, this just didn't work for us :(

Did not add all of the sugar, but the blended yolk was a great idea.

I honestly did not like this recipe at all. I made it by following the exact ingredients and instructions, too sweet and too sour.
