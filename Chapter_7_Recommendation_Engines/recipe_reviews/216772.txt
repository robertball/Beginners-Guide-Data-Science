This was a very good and versitile recipe. I made it twice in a week. First time I used lg lima beans, a smoked turkey leg and chopped up plum tomatoes turned out great. I shared it with my friends and family. Second time was because my daughter's boyfriend & mother-in-law brought home a ham bone from Easter and ask that I make them some soup like I made the first time. Everyone loved it. Thank your mom for sharing and thank you for posting it. Im sure I will be making it for years to come. YUMMY =]

I used leftover spiral glazed ham, did not include the celery and used canned beans ... and it was fast AND delicious!  All of this spices (which I happened to have had on hand) created a very tasty soup!

My family LOVED this recipe! This one for sure is a KEEPER! I will be making this again and again. The recipe is very interchangeable if you don't have all the ingredients that are listed.

Excellent soup!  I pressure cooked the beans and ham hock then threw the rest in the slow cooker on LOW for about 6 hours.  Added pasta in the last 1/2 hour or so.  It was savory and delicious and even better the 2nd day!  Will definitely make this again.  Even the bean soup critics at my house LOVED it!

Olive oil provides wonderful flavor and is very good for you.  Most italian soups I have seen, including bean soups have olive oil as well as recipes from many other countries.  Awesome soup!

Everyone loved this soup even my one yr old and 3 yr old! I didn't make this recipe in a pressure cooker, but it was easy to adapt. Otherwise, didn't change a thing and soup was awesome!

It was delicious only I omitted the olive oil. Never ever heard of using olive oil in bean soup (or any other soups)

Great flavor, the beans cooked perfectly. For our family it was too tomatoey for our liking (reminiscent of campbells tomato soup but with fresh ingredients and flavors). Good recipe, thanks for sharing.

I had soaked my beans overnight so I had no need to boil them first. I had no celery but had everything else. I threw it ALL in the pressure cooker including all the tomato (I used large can of sauce).  I did use chunks of a ham cut up, but no ham bone.  It all went in the pressure cooker.  It was very good!  I'd make it like this again!

Did not have tomato puree, so I used spaghetti sauce I had in fridge.  Otherwise I used ingredients listed.  This soup is full of flavor and was immensely enjoyed by all.

I'm not a bean fan. I ate 3 bowls of this. I had no brown sugar and molasses after I got started, so I used BBQ sauce and a dash of worshershire  sauce. If you have kids that fight you on eating beans at least give this a try.

Was scouring the web looking for a tomato based soup and I stumbled on this and was elated. I had my Christmas Ham Bone and every other ingredient in my pantry. I made it to recipe except entirely in the pressure cooker. OMG it was so yummy and I loved the rich broth. I will make this everytime I have a Ham Bone and probably even when I don't Great recipe!

I don't have a pressure cooker so I had to adjust the recipe somewhat to make sure the beans were cooked. I have made this many times and love it. I like that it is somewhat sweet...and if you want more ham flavor , add diced ham to it, a great use for leftovers.

This was a great soup.  I don't have a pressure cooker so I used a can of pinto beans and cooked it for several hours on the stove.  It's a very versatile recipe that can be tweaked.  I may add a few diced potatoes next time.  Tastes even better the next day!

REALLY GOOD was the rating from my picky eater.  I used canned beans and the crock pot, however, followed the rest of the recipe.

Made according to directions except for using no pressure cooker and 2 ham hocks, I did not like it although I had been hankering for something that sounds like this.  It was too sweet and too tomatoey for me.  Even with the extra ham hock, I couldn't taste the ham.  If you want something that reminds you of a ketchupy meatloaf this might do.   Out of 4 diners, we had three votes for 2-stars and one for 4.  Now she has three lunches.

I didn't have a pressure cooker so I made this in the crockpot, which of course took much longer, but I anticipated that and I didn't use the last 5 cups of water because there was no need. I thought it was too sweet. My husband even commented on it and added parmesan to his bowl. I don't think I'll be making this again.
