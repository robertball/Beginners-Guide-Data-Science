I only did half  the recipe with coconut yoghurt - for breakfast - and kept me going till lunch... deffinitely a go-to esp. when in hurry - was quick n easy to whizz up! Also high fat yoghurt such as coconut yoghurt keeps you fuller for longer and is low in carbs!!!

This was a very good smoothie, rather thick even after doubling the water. I used a frozen banana and it was sweet enough on its own without having to add a packet of Truvia. Which I normally do with other smoothies. Very satisfying and filling.
