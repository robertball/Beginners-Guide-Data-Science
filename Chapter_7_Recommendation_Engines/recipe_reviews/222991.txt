yum.. just snarfed one of these down for dinner.. Tasty. I admit I made a change.. I didn't fry the bread. I LOVE the fried bread, but my stomach cannot afford the calories. I sparayed a pan with cookign spary, and cooked it on the stovetop.. It got nice and crunchy. It got a few puffy bubbles too.  Only thing I'd do differnet next time is add a dash of salt to the dough..

I am from Oklahoma where every event involves Indian tacos. I made these last night and my family said it was the best ones they had ever ate. The fry bread is awesome. Even had it for desert just add honey and butter makes a great desert.

I'm white and my husband is native.  We've had these often.  I always joke about making "white-man's fry bread."  I just use thawed frozen bread dough.  Grab a little ball of it, stretch it out and fry it up.  Quick and easy.

The meat sauce - I winged it.  Used chili beans -they worked great.  And used my canned salsa for all of the tomotoes... and used my own taco seasoning blend... but the star of this is the dough!  Wow so good and easy.   Definitely will be a staple in our house.  BTW 2 cups self rising flour = 2 cups flour, 2 2/3 baking powder, 2/3 tsp of salt.

I'm giving this a 5 star because I cannot give it a 4. for flavor.  BUT... since it gave me such a great flash-back to many wonderful moments in the past, this recipe quickly wins back that half-point.

I had to make this... Not bad at all.  I think the ranch-style beans is what brought this recipe to the top of the pile of other recipes I have tried. (Funny, but I never considered this as the missing ingredient...) I used Penzey's Bold Taco seasoning for the first time, too. The flavors were definitely there, but I do prefer the Indian tacos in which the dough is a yeast-raised dough. Somehow, that seems to fry up even better!  Probably because it makes this entire dish taste like a fabulously wonderful, savory donut. (I use all-purpose flour rather than self-rising, add sugar to make a slightly sweet dough, and used peanut oil or good ol' lard to deep-fry 'em all up!)

My next favorite version of this recipe is just the deep-fried dough (yeast-raised!) smothered with a dried wild blueberry sauce (Standing Rock Tribe, Sioux Nation of the Dakotas). That was served on Thursdays when I was working at For Yates, ND.

Thank you very much, Melanie2008, for bringing back such wonderful memories of great food as well as great fellowship.

I wish there was a place to ask questions without posting a rating. I've never heard of ranch style beans - what kind of beans are they?  Black beans or baked beans? This recipe sounds delicious.

Made this recipe for my husband since he loves Indian tacos and they were a hit with him. He can be kinda picky but they were perfect the first time I tried making them. I used crisco instead of the oil for frying. I also didn't have self rising flour so I made my own out of regular flour, salt and baking powder. Also didn't put tomatoes in while cooking we like them raw with the crunch in tact. We put sour cream on top with lettuce and cheese and all the fixings. Mmm very delicious recipe!!

Haven't tried it yet, but fully intend to. Tammy M, there are beans in a can labeled RANCH STYLE BEANS. They are usually w/ the beans, on the top shelf where you really have to look for them. I find them at our local Kroger and Publix.

I've made these for Many many years. I was taught by a wonder and beautiful Native American (Choctaw) she taught me to make it with yeast bread. Takes a lot longer but has a sweeter taste goes great with the chili seasoning and ranch style beans. Worth the extra time.

Made this last night and it was very good. The kids asked for second helpings! Because we have kids, I made it a little less spicy by using mild chili seasoning instead of spicy.

I am one of the people that hate it when people rate a recipe and are like, "Well I subbed fat free everything and it was horrible." or "It called for pineapple but I only had radishes."  

I did make a TON of changes.  My husband was craving this from some random Indian fest years ago so I gave it a shot.

As written the recipe was pretty bland for my tastes.  BUT that may have been because I could not find the Ranch Style Beans.  I used pinto beans instead and they were a very good addition.

I also way upped the spices.  (Part of that is probably because I didn't have the Ranch Style Beans.)  Added brown sugar, Paprika, salt, cumin, quite a bit of black pepper, and onion and garlic powders to the filling.

But I'm giving this a 5 anyway.  :-D  It turned out delicious.  I would have never been able to pull this off without the original recipe.  My husband is 1/2 Native American and he had mentioned this a few times.  

Oh!  I did throw a pinch of salt in the fry bread.  

Thank you for sharing!!

Wow!  I had a completely different idea when I saw this recipe.  What if you made it smaller, and coated it with cinnamon and sugar.  Then topped it with ice cream?  AMAZING!  Made the batch half size, and still got 6 servings out of it.  As soon as it came off the oil, I dabbed it on a paper towel.  Then I covered it like a churro and put ice cream and served it hot with cold ice cream.  Allowed party guests to cover the ice cream with home made Ghiradelli chocolate fondue sauce.  Recipe works better than expected!

I have been looking for a recipe since I moved to Texas from N.M. but didn't know what they called it. I made this last night with taco meat - charro beans-lettuce - cheese and pica de gallo, my boyfriend loved it! He ate 4 plus half of mine. I used smaller portions for us 2 so don't be scared if the batter doesn't look right, it should be plenty sticker and covered in flour.

Easy & tasty fry bread. Added a pinch of salt, otherwise followed recipe. Used cooking spray on hands while patting to size to keep the dough from sticking. Very easy & good.

Wasn't bad in any way... But very "plain"... Would like to try rolling the bread to make it real thin ... Maybe more chalupa like.
