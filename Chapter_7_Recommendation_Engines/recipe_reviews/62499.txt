This is a really good recipe.  Not to argue too much with PickyCook (and I do appreciate the feedback), but you REALLY have to watch the mayonnaise.  2 teaspoons is really the absolute most you should put in it.  A dab is better.

Also, something else I've noticed - make SURE you use a good quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Since that's the only flavoring, you'll notice the quality.

And lastly - it's good to make a day or two in advance.  The flavors get more depth as the salad "ages".  I made a batch the night before for a cookout, and it was good, but then I ate some left overs the day *after* the cookout and it was just a lot better.

Anyway, I think I may add bacon next time.  I hope other people try this and offer feedback.

I am from Schwabenland in Germany and grew up on this potato salad. In this potato salad there is no mayonnaise or eggs in it.

following the directions exactly, i found this recipe to be bland, unattractive and had a very "mayonnaisey" taste to it, even though you didn't use much mayonnaise. maybe add scallions?

This was awful! I followed the recipe exactly. The balsamic vinegar makes it turn a brownish color and the end product does not look very appetizing. I was very disappointed. Now that I wasted my time making this today, I now have buy some store made potato salad to take to my potluck event today!

Very good. I omitted the mayo, and add more egg and a few dill pickles.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It is very different from the "normal" potato salad. The first time I made this, we tried it warm (i'm so impatient!) My husband liked it best warm. But I thought it was better the next day at room temp. My favorite thing about this recipe is not worrying about keeping it chilled during a cookout or picnic!

This is just like they make it in Swabish Gumund! Such a treat. I had lost my recipe and was pleasantly surprised to find this one. Be sure to use white balsamic vinegar so you don't discolor your beautiful potatoes. Leave out the mayonnaise. I prefer salt in my food, so add it to taste.

The flavors didn't blend well, family wouldn't eat it. It sat in the fridge and went to waste.
