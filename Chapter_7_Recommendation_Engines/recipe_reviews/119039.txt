Squeezing the juice from lemons and oranges, then mixing with sugar and water, is hardly anything extraordinary. Simmering the zest in a sugar syrup, on the other hand, is. This extra step really intensifies the citrus flavor! And unlike another, similar, recipe on this site, the zest is strained out. Bits of zest floating around in my drink didn't appeal to me. This was so much better than the "easy" way and worth the extra effort. In addition, the measurements of all ingredients was perfect, just the right amount of citrus and sweetness. The aroma in my kitchen as this was simmering (and long after I might add) was an added plus!

I followed the recipe exactly using fresh-squeezed orange and lemon juices. As written this recipe is just too sweet. It is not really lemonade, since there is so much orange juice and very little lemon juice to speak of. If I make this again I will cut down on the sugar and increase the lemon juice.

I followed the advice of Pam-3BoysMama and used fresh squeezed juices in this recipe. I also used Splenda. I found it WAY too sweet, but my boys loved it. For myself, I would cut the sweet down to about half next time and perhaps add a little more lemon juice. Good base recipe.

I've made this twice.  The first time, I made exactly as written.  The second time around, I was pressed for time and didn't bother with the zest.  I didn't think it tasted significantly different.  I also increased the amount of lemon juice to about 1/2 cup and the amount of water to about 5 cups (but I like my lemonade on the watery side - I even sometimes fill my glass halfway with water before pouring the lemonade to cut back on the sweetness and calories).  Overall, very refreshing!

Oh I truly loved this - I added about a half cup lemon juice vs the recommended 1/4 cup just to give it more zing ... wonderful!

The lemon & orange are a great combination in this drink. To save time I didn't bother letting the mixture cool to room temperature, I just poured it into a large plastic jug and continued with the recipe. I also used room temperature water rather than cold. I think it's too sweet as it is, so I use 5 cups of water rather than 3 and it's perfect. The second time I made it, I added Â½ cup of seedless passionfruit pulp (my mum's idea) and it tasted great! :o)
