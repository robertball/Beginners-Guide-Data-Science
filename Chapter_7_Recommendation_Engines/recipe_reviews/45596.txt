This was an excellent side dish.  It was easy to prepare and was fast.  I used dried basil since fresh was not available.  I didn't have Zinfadel, so I added water.  It was good.  I think a good provolone cheese would be good also.

Although this smelled pretty good fresh out of the oven, once I tasted it, I was really reluctant to serve it up. The basil/wine/raisin combination doesn't work at all, and all the Worcestershire sauce does is added an unpleasant aftertaste. Thanks anyway.

Perhaps I did something wrong, or perhaps the recipe was just not to my taste.  It was too sweet for me (even after omitting the raisins), and just not a pleasing combo.

If you enjoy your grilled cheese sandwiches dipped into tomato soup, you'll love this. I used chix broth instead of wine. I look forward to having this again.

I used fresh tomatoes because I had a lot of garden tomatoes. I also used dried basil. Next time I may use something other than raisins, maybe tomatoes,

I really like the overall flavor of this.
I used like a month old ciabatta bread, so it was very hard and crispy. I added about a cup of milk to help soften the bread, in fear that it would be baked even harder. It turned out good. For next time, I think I might add a little more raisin, and maybe some sausage? or prochiutto?

we had the tomato bread pudding with sirloin steak and it was very good..might just need a bit more juice...probably should have not drained the cans of tomatoes. Will add some juice if we use it again but did like the flavor.

We loved it! Someone drank the leftover wine that I had intended for this, so I substituted dark rum. Yum! Next time, I'll toss all the ingredients in a large bowl, then place them in the baking dish.
