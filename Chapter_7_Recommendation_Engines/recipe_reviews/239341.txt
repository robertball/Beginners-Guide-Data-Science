I made these for a family reunion recently and they were a huge hit! Very easy to prepare and assemble. The only change I made was to sprinkle a little garlic powder into the cream cheese mixture, gave it a little more flavor. Will absolutely make again and thanks for sharing!

Made for a party and seemed to be a hit. Next time will add some candied walnuts for a little crunch. Thank you

This is a terrific finger food. It will not last long at a party. I used the garlic powder on the cream cheese and instead of cranberries, I used chunky style cranberry sauce. Yum!

Add a couple squirts of raspberry vinaigrette salad dressing. It compliments the cranberries.

I made it with what I had on hand--deli chicken.  Did not slice into appetizer-sized pieces; just left it whole for kids' school lunches.  We all loved it!

I needed to make some finger food for a funeral luncheon and decided to try these.  They taste great but are time consuming to make.  I always have a problem rolling roll-ups tight, and I hate wasting the ends.  I think I would use the same filling but make sandwiches on whole wheat bread if I were to make these again.

I made this as a wrap, not an appetizer. I only put cream cheese on half and it was just the right amount. I used spinach tortillas too.

I only used about half of the cream cheese called for, and it worked out great.

I did not care for it!!  I thought maybe the combo would taste good, but it was a boring appetizer.

Delicious and easy to service a crowd.  I added garlic power to the cream cheese and chopped walnuts for a bit of texture.

I took this to a party and they were a huge hit.  I thought it would be great to maybe add some chopped nuts to the wrap also.  Will try that next time.
