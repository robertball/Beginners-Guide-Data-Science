I was going to make this for our Easter brunch but decided at the last minute not to because I am use to coffee cakes with a crumb topping, so was afraid to make, thought it wouldn't be good enough. BOY WAS I WRONG! I made this today to test on the family and it is delish! I halved this recipe and added 1/2 chopped apple, my applesauce also had cinnamon in it. Baked in a 8x8 bake dish and cook time was the same. It is so moist and flavorful! Perfect size for the 4 of us. These cinamon chips are fantastic! Everything I put them in tastes great! I can eat them out of the bag!! Thanks Hershey's for another winner!!!

I made this cake just the way the recipe stated.  It was awful.  No one in my house liked it.  I ended up throwing the entire thing in the garbage disposal.  Won't make this again.

Loved this Coffeecake!  Made it this weekend, used cinnamon applesauce-about 1 cup.  Didn't have pecans or walnuts, so I added an extra 1/2 cup mini cinnamon chips-which are available at a local Amish bulk food store.  Will make again, whole family enjoyed several pieces each and guys at hubby's work gobbled up the remaining 4 pieces the next day for coffee break.

Simple & so yummy!  Delicious warm or room temperature.  So happy to find cinnamon baking chips (acme markets website) & try these recipes!  I did substitute shortening (plus 6 tsp. water) for the butter & used chunky applesauce in place of regular.  I made a simple streusel to sprinkle on top before baking (1 cup dark brown sugar, 1 1/2 tbsp. flour, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 1/2 tbsp. softened butter-mix until crumbly).  It was so delicious & smells incredible!  A perfect way to please co-workers!

My love for cinnamon, in particular the hersheys cinnamon chips, my family rallied around the oven to make this cake for my birthday this past weekend. I was pleased with their result and highly recommend this wonderful and easy recipe (if they can follow it...it must be easy...hehe)! We didn't bother with the glaze, just served with vanilla ice cream. This cake warmed me up even though my birthday falls in one of the bleakest months in MN...but was still a good birthday none-the-less! Thanks again Hersheys!

This was pretty good.  I wanted more of an apple cinnamon taste but the applesauce isn't very noticable.  Probably if I use a chunky textured or cinnamon flavored applesauce it would be better.  Also, since there are only 2 of us, I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan.  It was still plenty.

This coffeecake is ideal - easy and tasty!  With recipes like this, there's no reason to eat store bought coffeecakes again!  In fact, this recipe made Entenmann's products seem positively dry in comparison!

If you like cinnamon, this is the cake for you!  Very easy to make, and turned out moist and wonderful.  I used homestyle applesauce with brown sugar and cinnamon, and it tasted great.  I didn't bother with the glaze, since I wanted something I could pack in my son's lunch.  Frankly, I don't think it needs it, since the glaze might make it a tad too sweet.  After tasting it, my husband declared, 'I'm so glad I married you!' I guess this one's a keeper.

This was a yummy receipe.  Very easy to make and a nice change from all the chocolate cakes I tend to make.  It is true that this receipe is on the back of the cinnamon chips bag which made it even easier to remember. :)  My 2 year old nephew who isn't a sweets kind of kid loved this receipe!!

I made this for Christmas morning since it is our family traditional to have coffee cake for breakfast on Christmas.  I had to subsitute berry flavored applesauce for regular since I didn't realize that I was out of the regular until that morning.  This did not seem to effect the flavor.  The cake was moist and great!

I thought it was too rich, but only 2 of the 10 who ended up consuming the entire cake thought that! This is a keeper recipe and if you only remember the cin. chips part while shopping, the recipe is on the back of the bag!!

I made this in a bundt pan and just watched it for doneness.  This was a tasty recipe that my husband and I both enjoyed.  It was good, and I would recommend it, but I don't think I'll make it again right away.  I'd like to try out other apple quick breads before I declare this my favorite.

OH DEAR! This was a GREAT recipe! I couldn't find Cinnamon Chips in my local supermarket, so I used Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chips instead. I can't wait to try it with Cinnamon! This was wonderful! It was light and tasty. I highly recommend it to warm up any morning!

I've now tried it with the Cinnamon Chips and really thought that the Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chips were a better combination, for me personally. With Cinnamon chips, it tasted like a true coffeecake. With PB & Chocolate Chips, it tasted sinfully wonderful!

This cake is very moist and delicious. I used the chunky applesauce and a little more than what the recipe calls for. The cinnamon chips are great and make for a nice change.

This was a really yummy cake that myself and coworkers all enjoyed!  
However, I did make the following additions, and without them, this may not have been as good: I added a diced apple, and a streusal to the top made of brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, and butter.  I will make this again!

Baking time for this recipe in a bundt pan IS INCORRECT!  Excellent flavor but absolute disaster with raw center when baked for 40 minutes!

This was a quick, delicious & moist breakfast cake perfect for weekends with enough left over to last several days. (P.S. I used cinnamon applesauce instead of plain for extra cinnamon flavor!)

If I could give this 2.5 stars, I would. It took me longer than 35 minutes to bake, about 45 minutes. Don't know why. I did not glaze it, just ate plain. I like the cinnamon chips a lot, but the cake is just okay. It's pretty moist, but it's just not a 5 star recipe.

this recipe was so good.  i took advice from other reviewers and used chunky applesauce, and a streusel topping.  it was so delicious, i have been wanting another, but cannot find any cinnamon chips anywhere?  i got the last bag.

This got my husband to eat breakfast. As others suggested I used chunky applesauce and added cinnamon & a dash of nutmeg to the batter.  Next time I will cut back, slightly on the cinnamon chips. Tried without a topping, to bland. I glazed with powdered sugar, milk & vanilla. Next time I will try the streusel.

I took this too a meeting and people were asking if they could take some home and have a copy of the recipe too!  This was quick AND easy and has won a spot in my recipe book.

It was very good!  I would give it 5 stars for taste!  It is easy but is a "from scratch" type recipe that will take a few minutes and leave a few dishes in the sink.

This was very good.  Could hardly stop eating it.  I served it with chunky applesauce on the side as I did not use the frosting.

This is soooooo good!  I had my daughter fly from MI to FL with the chips, just to be able to try it.  No HERSHEY'S Cinnamon Chips found here.  I will beg Publix to get the product.  The best thing about this recipe is...it does not dry out!

Very easy to put together and it tastes like you worked all day!  The texture was excellent and it really is a crowd pleaser.  I served it as a desert after a rich meal and it was just right- not too sweet - a great ending to a dinner.
