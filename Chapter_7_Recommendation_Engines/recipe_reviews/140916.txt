Some people may rate this a lot higher but my wife, who I made this for, is not one for "girly-girl drinks," which are typically sweet and syrupy as this one turned out to be. If you like a sweeter drink with a lot of power behind it, this is definitely good.  On the down side, it tastes a lot like Frangelico on the rocks. My wife and I like little mini martinis or cordials - this would definitely be 5-stars if it was served as one of those.  As a full martini, however, Naples thought it was too sweet and rich - better in a lesser amount as an after dinner cordial (in a cordial glass).

Of course I love this drink, I submitted it. Yes it's strong, but most martini's are supposed to be. That is why they cost so much. Also, Starbucks makes an excellent Coffee Liquer, that could replace the Kalhua... still either way, Cheers!!!!!

Thansk to Princess Antz review, I knew to serve this after dinner...thanks Princess! ;o) I used Stoli Vanilla, Frangelico & Patron XO Cafe (a coffee flavored tequila that is fantastic!). I enjoyed this a lot but it made hubby shudder. LOL Be warned...these are tasty but potent. Thansk for the recipe Darlene O!

Made the first as directed. Awesome! Second one added 1/12 half n half to cut the potency. Still delish :)

This was just OK. You have to be in the right mood for this drink. I found the Kahlua / Coffee flavour overpowered the taste which is fine for an after dinner type drink but a bit too rich for any other time of the day.

Absolutely delicious - I've also had this on the rocks with cream as more of an after dinner drink.  Either way I LOVE IT!
