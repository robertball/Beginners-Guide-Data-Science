I've used this recipe quite a number of times and have experimented with many different rums.  The best is actually a combination of two different kinds.  For the cake, use Bicardi Dark/Select or Myers.  For the glaze, use Appleton Estates.  

If you can't find Appleton Estates, use the Bicardi or Myers, but the Appleton really makes the glaze sweeter and almost tangy - it's strong without completely overwhelming the flavour.  Captain Morgan's is also good for the cake, but I wouldn't recommend it for the glaze.  Both Captain and Bicardi tend to be too heavy of a flavour while in the glaze, while Myers is exceptionally weak.

Also, some other tips: MAKE SURE YOU SIFT YOUR CAKE MIX/PUDDING!  They clump really easily.  Also, as others have said, use the Pillsbury since it already has the pudding mix.  Use milk instead of water - fat free milk works best, honestly.  When you're ready to glaze, poke holes into the top of the cake with a toothpick, pour half the glaze in the pant and re-insert the cake.  Poke holes into the bottom of the cake and pour the remaining glaze over it.  Let it sit for an hour or two, upside down, and then flip it over onto a plate and let it sit for a few hours to a day before serving.  Personally, I just leave it in the pan on the plate, as it keeps it moist and detracts people from "picking" at it!

Absolutely delicious!!  I followed the recipe exactly as to ingredients.  I did add one twist, which I do with all glazed bundt cakes, have for over 50 years.  I use a wooden skewer to poke 30 to 40 holes in the top and all sides of the cake.  I then apply the glaze liberally with a 1 inch paint brush, used only for cooking, and repeat the process about 3 times.  This way, some of the glaze penetrates the cake, adding flavor and moisture.  I will definetly make this again.

I make this cake several times a year, and I get numerous request for it...
I make it as the recipe states.  It is easy and delicious.  The only thing you need to watch is the glaze.  Make sure the burner is off when you add the alcohol, and you need to realize that the glaze mixture is going to "bubble up" when you add the alcohol to it.  

I start the glaze when I take the cake out of the oven.  I let the cake sit in the pan while I am making the glaze.  Once the glaze is ready, I remove the cake from the pan, pour half the glaze in the bottom of the pan, and then I carefully put the cake back in the pan making sure I line the ridges up.  I then poke holes all over the cake with a butter knife, I then pour the remaining glaze onto the cake (don't let it go over the hole).  Let it stand for 10 minutes or so, then carefully flip the cake over onto your serving dish -- DO NOT REFRIGERATE

These are great to make as a mini cake and give out as gifts, especially to people at work.  Divide the batter between 12 mini fluted pans and bake for 20 minutes.  The only thing that I do different with the batter is I use milk instead of water and fold the nuts into the batter before dividing.  I also put all of the batter into a gallon size bag and cut a corner to squeeze it out into the individual pans, which really cuts down on the mess and makes it easier to divide evenly.  Once glazed and cooled, place on a cupcake liner and place in a small gift bag.  The liner helps in getting the cake out of the bag.

I have been eating this rum cake practically all my life, my mom has made it as long as I can remember.  And now, it's my husband's favorite.  We make it slightly different, pecans instead of walnuts, white rum instead of dark.  Immediately after removing from oven we pierce it all over (the bottom) with a meat fork and pour the glaze over and let it sit in the pan until cool.  Since you are only piercing the bottom, it is not evident when you turn it out on a plate.  I also make these as gifts in the small "disposable" aluminum pans you can get at the store.  It makes about 5 small cakes.

This was very good and super moist!! The only thing I'll do differently next time is use about half the amount of nuts as the recipe calls for.. my hubby and I both agreed that the nuts were a little too much. 
Also, there seems to be some confusion with previous reviewers over the sugar used for the glaze. The recipe (and most other rum glaze recipes) calls for GRANULATED, also known as WHITE sugar.  I would not recommend using powdered sugar as a reviewer mistakenly posted was the proper sugar to use.

This is the same cake recipe I've been making for years and it always comes out great.  
To make the cake better and easier to glaze, first spray the bundt pan with nonstick spray, sprinkle in chopped pecans (better than walnuts in my opinion) and then dust the pan with white sugar.

After baking, let stand for 10 minutes in the pan and then use a skewer to poke holes all over the cake.  Pour on warm glaze and then keep the cake in the pan until completely cool so that the glaze will be absorbed.  Then it's a "piece of cake" to unmold it - it will come right out of the pan onto the serving plate!

This recipe is very similar to another rum cake I have made a few times, but this came out the best ever.  I use coconut rum, and I don't notice a huge coconut flavor at all, it's just the rum I like to use.  (And because I don't like a strong alcohol taste, I put the rum in the glaze for the last minute of cooking).  Also, as far as the glaze, here is what I do.  After the cake cools in the pan for about ten minutes, I take a spatula and loosen it from the sides and from the center (bundt pan).  Then I pour the hot glaze around the edges and it goes right down the sides and soaks into the bottom (which will be the top) and the sides of the cake.  I also pour some around the inner ring and then a little along the top (which will be the bottom).  I let it sit about 30 minutes then invert it.  Perfect that way.  Other than that, recipe followed exactly.

This one's a keeper.  I did the coconut variation that another reviewer suggested.  I used Bacardi CoCo rum, coconut pudding, and instead of 1 cup of nuts I used 1/2 cup coconut and 1/2 cup pecans.  The tip on putting the cake back in the pan to soak up the glaze is GENIUS!  YUM!!!

Very easy to make.  DEFINITELY recommend letting it sit for a couple of days before eating as the flavor significantly improved with age.  Use a shish-ka-bob skewer or chopstick to poke holes in cake to let the glaze penetrate the interior of the cake.  I used a smaller tool which proved insufficient as glaze remained in top & bottom 1/2-inch of the cake.

I made this exactly as written with one minor substitution. I used coconut rum. Delicious! It was so easy that I made several to sell at a bake sale. They went quickly and the next week, I had all three "buyers" ask me for the recipe. Thank you! UPDATE: I have made this several times since to give as gifts and have tweaked it a bit, based on other reviewer's comments. I used milk instead of the water and I boiled my rum in the glaze mix. And yesterday I tried it with a chocolate cake mix, chocolate pudding, coffee instead of the water in both the cake mix and the glaze, and Kahula, which was AWESOME!!! I might try Irish Cream sometime as well. Thanks again!

The recipe is perfect as are the instructions to prepare it. However, as is typical with a yellow cake mix, not even a cup of good rum could disguise that cake mix taste. I use doctored up cake mix recipes frequently, but only if the result doesn't advertise that I've done so!

Made this for my boss' birthday.  Absolutely perfect.  We were all a little buzzed by 9am.  I think I probably added extra rum.  You know how it goes when you bake with liquor... one shot for the recipe, two shots for the baker.  Thank you very much for a great recipe.  Very (hiccup) enjoyable! :)

Greetings everyone, I love the cake, but like some, I made a few changes.  I like a rich cake, so I used a butter cake mix, pecans, whole organic milk for the 1/2 cup of water, butter for the 1/2 cup of oil and Captain Morgan's Parrot Bay Coconut Rum.  For the glaze, I used fresh lemon and lime juice for the 1/4 cup of water, brown sugar and the Captain Morgan's Parrot Bay Coconut Rum.  I also did the whole poke holes into the top of the cake with a toothpick, pour half the glaze in the pan and re-insert the cake. Poke holes into the bottom of the cake and pour the remaining glaze over it. Let it sit for an hour or two, upside down, and then flip it over onto a plate and let it sit for a few hours to a day before serving.  I even left the pan on the plate, as it keeps it moist and detracts people from "picking" at it thing, but it did not work, because every time my Mother would walk pass, she would lift the pan to take a look, so the pan is removed.  *If you think the glaze is too runny and too much, try blending it until it reach a thickness or you may reduce the rum to 1/3 or 1/4 cup.  You may also substitute 1 3/4 cup packed powdered sugar for the 1 cup of sugar(don't cook, just melt the butter and add the other ingredients).  *One more thing, if you can't eat nuts and would like crunch on top of the cake, you can use graham cracker crumbs.  ENJOY!

Fantastic!  I read many reviews and made the following common changes, and it came out perfect:
For the cake:
(1) Use milk instead of water in the cake mix.
(2) Used pecans instead of walnuts.
(3) Baked for 50 minutes instead of 60.
(4) Sifted the cake and pudding mix together.

For the glaze:
(1) Used 1/2 amount of rum to eliminate the "alcohol" taste.
(2) Boiled the glaze for a couple of minutes after adding rum to also help eliminate alcohol taste.

My family is definitely looking forward to eating this again soon.

Used 3 oz pkg. Cook & Serve vanilla pudding, not instant and didn't add anything else to recipe.
For a sharper rum flavor in cake, mix in rum last- after other wet ingredients (water, oil, eggs) already beaten in to dry ingredients. For a weaker rum flavor in cake, mix 1/2 c. rum with the 1/2 c. water before beating in to dry ingredients. Similarly, to decrease the alcohol in the glaze, cook the 1/2 c. of rum on low heat in a separate pan while water, butter, and sugar mixture cook- then add rum as specified. Used Gosling's Black Seal rum for both the cake and glaze and really like the flavor - great dark rum that doesn't leave lingering alcohol or cough syrup like flavors/smells. Also agree with other bakers in letting cake cool in pan for about ten minutes then pouring glaze in to let soak for an hour or so. My mother is a cookbook author so I was quite happy to learn that this is an easy recipe she likes and has baked for our family :) Cake gets better every day it sits!

What could I possibly add that hasn't already been said? Dynamite flavor, moist texture makes this irresistible! The rum can't be discerned in the cake, so it depends entirely on the glaze. If you like the alcohol to shine through, just dump in the rum at the very end. If you like a more subtle alcoholic flavor, simmer for 2 minutes more after adding the rum. Either way, EL YUMMO MUCHO!!!!! BTW, I like to make a chocolate variation as follows: use a chocolate cake mix and chocolate pudding mix in place of the yellow cake and vanilla pudding. For the glaze, melt 1 stick of butter in a small saucepan. Add 1 cup sugar, 1 cup whipping or heavy cream, 1/3 cup cocoa (strained to remove lumps,) 1 Tb rum. Bring to a light boil and keep it at that boil for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in  1 Tb instant coffee granules and 1 tsp vanilla. If you want more alcohol flavor, add 1-2 Tb of extra rum when the sauce is finished. I call this "Hot Buttered Rum Sauce" and it keeps well in the fridge for a couple of weeks (if it lasts that long.) Super over ice cream, too. Update 8/08: Baked in two 9" layer pans, then split to make 4 layers. The layers were done in about 32 minutes, and they were very easy to split accurately with virtually no "crumbing." I did put the layers in the freezer for an hour before splitting.

My husband loves this cake.  The only changes I make are to add the nuts into the mix and as another reviewer suggested sprinkle the pan with a cinnamon sugar mixture.  This cake is a winner!

This was truly an AWESOME cake...I made it for the first time and someone at work paid me to make another one for his birthday!!! I actually followed the recipe exactly, except for the glaze. Glaze: 1 stick of real butter (softened), 2 cup packed dark brown sugar, 1/3 cup heavy whipping cream, 1tbl of vanilla extract and 1/2 cup of rum....FANTASTIC!!! Add all ingredients for the glaze into a saucepan and cook until sugar is dissolved. Poke holes in bottom of the cake to pour the glaze in. Flip cake and add the rest of the glaze to the bottom of the bunt pan. Insert cake again and let it sit (overnight) Then  serve the next day...whoolah, magic!

This cake exceeded my expectations....I used Meyer's dark rum and this expensive rum was money well spent. I also basted the cake 3 more times with straight rum 48 hrs preceeding before I served it. Did it have a kick to it?  You bet it did, but served with whipped cream and coffee, it is the ultimate cold weather dessert, yummy! Thanks for a wonderful holiday recipe.

Awesome!!  The first time I made this cake I went to get the rum out and fount out that all my rum was in a jar soaking maraschino cherries for chocolate covered cherries. So I used bourbon for both cake and glaze - it was outstanding!  I make it exactly as written but use the bourbon; I've made it several times and everyone loves it.  My only addition and it's one I do to every bundt cake I make is this: I use oil to grease the bundt pan, then "flour" it with cinnamon-sugar and then put a layer of finely chopped pecans on bottom of pan (which will end up on top).  This makes a crispy sort of crust to any bundt cake I make!  Thanks for sharing this recipe which has become my signature cake!! I'm going to try it with chocolate cake mix and pudding and perhaps scotch.  The plan is to get mini-bundt pans and make these for Christmas gifts!

Delish!!! Resist the urge to eat this until the next day or you will end up with a mouthful of strong rum flavor as my impatient husband did! A couple of tips I followed from someone who has made this cake many times before: 1. mix the nuts with a couple tablespoons of melted butter to help them stick to the cake better. 2. if using a cake mix that has pudding already added, you can use three eggs instead of four. I also followed the technique of applying the glaze by putting the cake back into the pan with glaze on the top and bottom. Cake came out super moist and yummy. Can't wait to make this again!!!

This is my favorite recipe and easy to change.  I make it with amaretto, kahlua, creme de cacao, cointreau, which ever flavor of liquor you like for the occasion works well. I also use a 9x13 pan and top it with delicious butter cream frosting which is flavored with the same liquor and sprinkle with nuts.  Super delicious and all will ask for the recipe.

So good and I followed instructions to a T and DID NOT think the rum was too strong at all.  In fact I wish it had more of a rum taste to the cake - next time i will add more to the cake and use candied pecans in place of walnuts. I used Captian Morgans Tatoo rum for cake and topping.  I could see how using a cheap white rum may not be good though.  A recipe is only going to be as good as the ingredients you put in! Just follow everyones tips as far as taking the cake out, pouring 1/2 the rum mix in the pan, put cake back in, poke holes, then pour the rest over and let sit for a few hours, flip and keep the cover on until serving. Thank you for making me look like I could cook!!!! Oh-how cool WOULD it be if you could catch a buzz from a cake lol don't worry about cooking off the liquor!! Cheers!!!

OH-MY-GAWD. The rum cake was divine! There is absolutely no way you can foil this recipe. I followed the recommendations of some of the reviewers here: 1/2 the prescribed rum, granulated sugar, cooked the rum into the glaze (vs adding it after cooking), no instant pudding (since pillsbury yellow cake mix has it already), 3 eggs, Tanduay Dark Rhum (only rum we have here in the Philippines). Didn't have nuts on hand though. Simply DIVINE! Bought the Bundt pan just for this, and wasn't disappointed!

This is the classic Bacardi Rum cake, not an original recipe. It makes an excellent cake as written but it will stick to the pan if you don't use a nonstick pan that has been sprayed with Pam or a silicone pan.  Pour the glaze over the cake right after it comes out of the oven and it soaks right in and then invert onto cake dish. I made it once when I had run out of regular rum so I used 151 rum in the glaze instead and it had a ton of residual alcohol left. You need to use regular rum which is 80 proof or your guests will be smashed in 2 slices because 151 leaves WAY too much alcohol behind.  There's also residual alcohol in the glaze with regular 80 proof rum so this is NOT A CAKE FOR CHILDREN OR UNDER-21 people.

This cake is delicious and moist.  I substitute banana pudding mix for the vanilla and combined Captain Morgan's spiced rum with Malibu coconut rum and call it Banana Colada cake.  I also coat the greased pan with cinnamon and sugar instead of flour, gives it a nice crunch on the outside.  A definite keeper.

I've been making this same cake for at least 20 years. I've always left it in the pan, poked holes in the cake, and poured the glaze in - it fills the bundt pan but absorbs pretty quickly. My recipe calls for pecans, but it's otherwise the same.

I've always made it a few days ahead of serving. Those that complain about the overwhelming rum taste are probably eating it real soon after preparing. This cake is a must for for my annual winter parties for several reasons. First, it tastes incredible and is super moist. Second, I can make it 2 or 3 days ahead without loss of quality. I store it on a plate, covered only by the Bundt pan, and it will stay fresh for 10 days - if it lasts that long.

This is one of the best and easiest desserts I have ever made....almost everyone had seconds! One lady that doesn't drink often, got goosebumps on her arms because of the strong rum taste.   I sliced up some ripe peaches and sauteed them w/ a tablespoon of butter and a small handful of brown sugar. Once they started to to get soft, I put them on the bottom of the pan with the cake mix on top to bake. So yummy!!!

Very good, I just tweaked it to my personal taste...  I added 1/2 cup shredded coconut to the batter, used coconut rum and coconut cream pudding mix.  It was a big hit!!

We made this rum cake several times in a period of one week, trying different variations each time. Adding chocolate chips results in a nicely balanced taste, but the best results were yielded by adding Captain Morgan's Parrot Bay Coconut Rum instead of the dark rum in both the cake and glaze. We omitted the nuts, as most of our family are not big nut lovers. This made a golden coconut rum cake and was very tasty INDEED! It was a hit with the whole family, and seemed to get BETTER as the day went by. Overall it is the moistest cake I have ever seen and tasted. Very Majestic!

This is my ALL TIME favorite cake recipe.  If you want to WOW a crowd and have them say "OMG, this is AWESOME," then this is the cake for you.  I've made this at least 6 times and each time, everyone says it is the BEST cake they've ever had, and they continue to tell me how good it was even weeks after they've had it.  What I like is that it is very moist (thanks to the butter), it has the taste of rum, but it is not soaking in rum.  It is also a slightly unique cake and not a standard chocolate or vanilla flavor.  I followed other people's recommendations to poke holes on the top and bottom of the cake once it is baked, pour 1/3 of the rum/butter liquid in the bottom of the bundt pan, and re-insert the cake for 15 minutes to soak up the liquid.  When you flip the cake out of the bundt pan, I put it on a baking rack that is inside/on top of a large cookie sheet so the cookie sheet captures the liquid run off and doesn't mess up your counter top.

An outstanding recipe. Mine came out looking just like the photo. What's unusual about this recipe is that the texture of the finished product is so like a pound cake--but its foundation is a humble cake mix! I followed the reviews and let the cake sit overnight before serving. It's light/sweet/rich texture is divine. I changed only one thing: no quality cake is made with oil. I melted a stick of butter (=1/2 cup liquid) and used that instead of oil. This recipe is definitely a keeper, elegant enough to serve to company. Thank you for sharing.

This cake was ridiculously awesome!!!! I user Cruzan® Dark Rum, I passed on the nuts, and I used light brown sugar instead of white sugar in the glaze. I poked holes in the bottom of the cake and spooned on the glaze. I also removed the cake, poured glaze in the bundt pan, and reinserted the cake to soak up the goodness.

HOW TO AVOID BOX MIX TASTE:
Replace the cake mix/eggs/oil/water with the "One - Two - Three - Four Cake II" recipe from this site. (You'll need to halve that recipe.) I still added the box of pudding, at the same time I added the flour. Use cake flour and not A/P! Add the rum just before you fold in the egg whites. 
Its extra work but worth it. 
Otherwise followed this as directed, using Malibu Coconut Rum. Yum! I made mini-bundts and am aging one of them. Cant wait to taste in a few days.

I first made this cake according to the recipe and it was great but the taste of rum was overpowering. I made it again and for the glaze I used a bit less rum and one cup of butter instead of half a cup. It was absolutely beautiful.

Ick....what is going on here?  I used Meyers Dark Rum as others suggested and while the cake did turn out beautiful, the flavor of the rum was so overwhelming that I threw the entire thing away.  Gross!!!!!!!  I am so confused as to all all of the 5 star ratings. Guess it's just wether or not you enjoy such a overwhelming, eye-watering rum flavor.

Excellent recipe!  I like how easy this recipe is to make.  I substituted pecans for walnuts which I like better.  I also accidentally boiled the glaze a little too long, but it didn't really hurt anything.

I made this cake yesterday, as written, with the exception that I used sliced almonds instead of walnuts. It was sooooo good!!! Today I made another one and used coconut pudding instead of vanilla, used pineapple juice instead of water in the cake and glaze and I put pineapples and shredded coconut in bottom of the pan along with the almonds, then poured the batter over it. The first time I ever "ate" a pina colada!! And it was awesome!! Thanks for the recipe. This will be made over and over again with many different variations. Someone else mentioned using chocolate cake and chocolate pudding and using Kahlua for the liquor...I think I'll try that one next!

Great recipe! I will definitely make it again. Here are the things I would change though. First of all, I would let the cake sit overnight before eating it. This will allow the rum to soak thoroughly and it won't feel like you are "eating" rum. The alcohol flavor is extremely strong if you try the cake shortly after making it. Next, I would cook the rum in the glaze instead of stirring it in after taking the glaze off the heat. That should decrease the alcohol flavor as well. Lastly, I would go with 3 eggs instead of 4 to decrease the amount of cholesterol. We all loved the cake when we tried it the next day! Thanks for the recipe!

This is the exact recipe I've been using for years.  The only thing that I do different is when I take the cake out of the oven, I IMMEDIATELY pour the hot glaze mixture over the top of the cake while it is still in the pan.  This way it settles the cake and soaks in all of that rum goodness.  Wait 30 minutes before inverting onto your serving plate. It's always better the next day!

Thank you for this recipe!!!  My husband and I went to Grand Caymans Island last summer and purchased rum cakes for almost $15 each.  This rum cake tastes just like the ones we had in the Caymans :)  (I used Captain Morgan's Parrot Bay Coconut Rum.)  One of our favorite rum cakes was a Chocolate/Banana.  Next time I am going to use chocolate cake mix, banana pudding mix & banana rum.

I omitted the water and doubled the rum in the mix.  I also doubled the rum in the glaze! I  poked holes in the cooled cake then poured half the glaze in the bundt pan put the cake back in the pan and poured the rest of the glaze over it.

I have used this recipe many times and it's wonderful. What I started doing was trying different liquors. Last one I made was a Butter Pecan cake with Praline Pecan liquor. Absolutely amazing!!  This recipe lends itself to experimentation.

You can easily make variations to this cake by using different flavors of cake mix, pudding & yum.  Some of my favorites:
-spice cake mix, vanilla pudding, spiced rum & add 1 cup diced apples to batter
-chocolate cake mix, choc pudding & raspberry or strawberry flavored rum - use choc. chips instead of nuts & garnish with fresh fruit
-strawberry cake mix, cheesecake pudding & strawberry rum

I've been using this recipe for years and will continue to for many more.  This cake always comes out perfect and is my most requested dessert to bring anywhere.  I never use the glaze, too me it is too sweet and takes away the great flavor of the cake, but that's me. Today I decided to make it with pumpkin instant pudding and coconut rum.  Fabulous! I'm glad I bought a couple of boxes of the pumpkin instant pudding mix when it was available which is only in Oct. and Nov. Can't wait to try other flavors! :)

We've been making this recipe for years and it's always a great hit at gatherings.  Like Jackie, many family members request it for their special 'b-day' cake.
Note:  Serve with a dollop of fresh whipped cream and/or a side of French vanilla ice cream.
Option: For those not so keen on the nuts... you can make it without.  I've also replaced with a little coconut (w/sprinkle of brown sugar) as the topping. (i.e. bottom of pan.

New twist:  Just tried a different twist - made individual cupcakes (foil lined cupcake shells) with a little drizzle of the sauce for each (3-tsps each)... wow, what a cupcake!

This is really good!  I don't care for walnuts so I used pecans (only 1/2c), great flavor and I really like the crunch on top.  I took the suggestion of spraying my pan and then sugar coating it instead of using flour - love how that came out.  Also subbed 1/2c melted butter for the oil.  While cooling the cake for 10 mins, I made the glaze (decreased by 1/4).  Turned the cake out and put about 1/3 of the glaze into the pan, then reinserted the cake.  Used a table knife to poke holes into the bottom of cake and slowly poured the rest of the glaze all over the bottom.  Covered it and left it overnight to absorb.  Good stuff indeed!

This is FABULOUS!  I have made this recipe several times EVERY YEAR!  I recommend experimenting with the jello pudding.  I use banana cream, and it's divine!  It tastes just like the Tortuga Rum Cakes you pay $15+ for... This recipe is a WINNER in my book!

Such a simple recipe and delicious!    I made two custom versions: Chocolate (just used chocolate cake mix and chocolate pudding mix) and Key Lime (I added 3TSBP keylime juice to batter, and 4 TBSP keylime juice to the glaze along w/ the rum). Key lime version was especially good!

EXCELLENT!! I will not make this cake again because I ate almost half of it. I used pecans instead of walnuts. To me, this is one of the best and easiest cakes to make. I decided to use 1/4 cup of rum instead of a 1/2 cup of rum, it came out perfect. I will make this for holidays. Again, EXCELLENT!!!

My family has loved this recipe for over 29 years.  About 15 years ago I didn't have any rum and didn't really want to spend the money for good rum so I experimented and found you can use 1 teaspoon rum extract and water to equal the liquid measurement called for.  i.e. 1/2 cup water plus 1 teaspoon rum extract.  No one has ever noticed the difference...plus you save money.

Well where do I begin, if you are not a  drinker you may think twice before making this cake. I followed the direction exactly. And while the cake was baking it smelled really great and I could not wait to try. Well when the cake was done I began making the glaze I did as other reviewers I poured half the glaze in the pan reinserted my cake then poured remaining over cake, I ate a slice around 9:30pm later after I had gone to bed around 3:30 am I awoke feeling like I had been out drinking all night, While I  don't drink now I use to and this was what it felt like when you have had to much to drink, (A HANGOVER). I mean I was really sick to my stomach, and all I could tasted while gettting sick was the rum. Needless to say I will NEVER!!!! MAKE THIS AGAIN, wait let me be fair I would never make this again with out cutting the rum down to maybe a capful for the glaze, that is if I can think about rum cake without feeling sick, because right now I can't. I am so sorry to be so blunt, but this was my true experience. Thanks anyway for the recipe
3/21/07 UPDATE!!!!. I TOOK THIS CAKE TO WORK AND LET ME SAY EVERYONE LOVED IT, ONE GUY OFFERED ME MONEY TO MAKE HIM ONE. I GUESS IT'S A MATTER OF TASTE. THOUGH SOME DID THINK I HAD USED A WHOLE BOTTLE OF RUM, THEY STILL SAID IT WAS GOOD. OH WELL!!!!.

Excellent....I have made this cake numerous times using a couple of types of rum.  I advise using "top shelf" rum.  A cheaper rum seems to leave an aftertaste that the premium rum doesn't.

Holy cow! This is insanely good. I used Spice Cake mix and added additional cinnamon, nutmeg and all spice. Definitely followed others advice about letting cake absorb overnight, poking holes in cake. Did I mentioned I added golden raisins to the batter? Love this recipe: make this!

This cake was very moist just like the rum cakes I've been used too eating.  However, I like rum cakes with a richer butter flavor which I think this recipe lacked so I'm thinking that the next time I'm making this, I'll put 1/2 cup melted butter to the batter.  I also like the idea of brushing the glaze over the top and sides of the cake instead of pouring and reinserting the cake in the pan because I find that the glaze doesn't spread evenly inside the cake...there are parts that has too much rum taste while other parts are just cake and no rum.  Also, when I inverted the cake I noticed that the walnuts could not be seen anymore as they got embedded too much inside the batter.  It may be a good idea to reserve some of the nuts to press on top during glazing so they will be visible and more pleasing to look at.  Lastly, my cake baked for 45-50 mins instead of the suggested 60 mins at 325 so it's really a good idea to start checking the doneness of the cake around this time.

For those of you fortunate enough to have a Trader Joes' in your area, I used the TJ's Meyer Lemon Cake & Baking Mix because that was all I had on hand. It's a 16 oz. cake mix but worked fine in this recipe. Also, instead of water I used Coconut Milk and I ended up using Appleton Estates Rum for both the glaze and the cake. I think I now know the difference between using granulated sugar and powdered sugar. Use granulated sugar to get a clear, glossy glaze, one poster may have used the powdered sugar which will give you a more thick white glaze. I prefer granulated. This was a HIT. I also poured half the glaze on the bottom of the bundt pan and poked holes all over, top, bottom and sides, like a crazy woman! The cake turned out perfectly infused with a combination of flavors of lemon, rum, and a hint of coconut which ended up being a very nice and light rum cake perfect for Spring.

Very good!  I used clear rum.  Also the walnuts were the perfect nut!  ***UPDATE** (one year later) This is my second time making this cake.  This time I used Puerto Rican Bacardi Rum (they were out of dark) and I didn't clearly read the directions and boiled the rum with the rest of the glaze ingredients.  I'm glad I did since it seemed to boil out some of the alcohol.  It didn't taste as "alcohol-y" as it did last year.

Very tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly this first time.  The only thing I will change next time I make it is to 3/4 cup rum and 1/4 cup water in the cake part in order to have more rum flavor in the cake itself.
Also, I had more than enough glaze.  I poked several holes in the cake right out of the oven, and spooned half of the glaze over the cake.  I let cool for 30 minutes, inverted to a cake plate and then spooned the rest of the glaze.  All this glaze tended to make the bottom of the cake soggy with rum--actually not a bad thing.
The next time, I am going to cut all of the ingredients in the glaze in 1/2, except the sugar.  I will be using confectioners sugar instead of granulated.

This cake was very easy to make and very good taste. The only thing I would do different is cut down on the Rum, when I was making it I was concern about the cup of rum in one cake. I thought it would be strong in taste and smell of rum and it is. I planned to make it many more times but less Rum.

DELICIOUS! 
First time I made this, I added the rum to the glaze AFTER as the recipe calls for and it tasted too boozy. Second time I made this, I cooked the rum into the glaze and "Wahlah!" I have used this method ever since. When using a bundt pan, I found that brushing it with Crisco (veg shortening) instead of using Pam (cooking spray) and liberally flouring it, made this cake just fall right out of the pan...there's no need to run a spatula along the sides to loosen the cake, just give it a little shake. After removing the cake from the oven, using a skewer to puncture the cake allowed me to puncture it all the way through. While keeping the cake in the pan, I first glazed the sides, then the middle and let it sit for 15 minutes. Then I added the remainder of the glaze and let it sit for another 15 minutes saving just a little for touch-ups when I flipped it over onto a dish. Think of it as basting a turkey. I agree with the other ratings that the longer it sits the better it tastes (overnight is ideal). 
Substitutes I have used: 
Butter instead of oil in the mix-
Milk instead of water in the mix-
Orange juice instead of water in the glaze-
Raw sugar instead of white sugar in the glaze-
Pecans instead of walnuts-
Añejo rum in  the mix-
Myers rum in the glaze-
All substitutions I have formed (mainly because I didn't have the exact ingredients) have only made this one of the most versatile recipes I have ever used. Everyone loves this cake!!!

I have been making this rum cake for over 35 years. I too prick holes in it and pour the rum glaze by the tablespoonful over the cooled cake. The longer you let it sit the better it tastes. Was a favorite back then is a favorite now and will always be a favorite.

Great recipe! Been making it for 3 years now.  It has become a staple at family gatherings throughout the year.  I make a few adjustments: buttermilk instead of water, softened butter in place of the oil, and a mixture of dark rum and coconut rum.  I do follow the suggestion to remove cake from pan, pour 1/2 the glaze in the bottom, poke holes in the cake (using kebob skewers), and then place the cake back in the pan.

This cake is very good, but I agree with another reviewer that the yellow cake mix base is very evident (which, as it's made with a mix, makes sense, but it's still good to know that this isn't a magical recipe that makes that go away).  I used pecans instead of walnuts and thought it added a very nice, tasty, texture-y crunch to the cake - I definitely would add nuts.  I took the advice of others and poked holes in both sides and let the cake sit in the yummy drizzle for a bit before turning it back onto a cake plate.  If you're at altitude, I would watch the time - I think I could have taken this out 5-10 minutes sooner and it would have been a bit more moist.  The rum taste is only overwhelming at the very beginning - I found that it tasted perfect after about 10 hours.

I did not care for this recipe. That awful chemical aftertaste of the instant pudding,
Between the oil ,butter, and pudding it was a soggy
mess. There is a very good recipe for rum cake in the book "All Cakes Considered" Do the extra work and make a cake with quality ingredients, not some fast food version of a cake.

Been making this rum cake for some time now. I use Bacardi Gold Rum, and after baking, invert onto a plate. I let it cool then add the glaze. When adding the glaze I insert a sharp knife, give a little twist and pour in some glaze. Then I procede to do that over the entire top of the cake. Gives it a nice drizzle down the sides and allows the glaze to go into the center of the cake. Very moist. Enjoy.

This cake was perfect.  I made it exactly as the recipe said.  I did however use a pilsbury vanilla cake box which already has pudding so I didn't add the extra pudding.  I cooked it exactly for 60 minutes and it was perfect.  I also did what others suggested and poured the glaze into the bundt pan then reinserted the cake to let it soak for an hour.  It was much faster than brushing it on.

Love this cake! But I usually let the cake sit for a couple of days before serving it so the strong alcohol taste can dissipate. The only thing I don't like about this cake is the calories! Gotta be very careful about the serving size. ;)

This cake is really good, but a bit on the sweet side. I think next time I will use the coconut variation, that sounds delicious!

Wow!  I was so proud to serve this!  I went "Tropical" by using pineapple cake mix, and using chopped pecans + shredded coconut in lieu of the walnuts.  I followed other suggestions of using milk instead of water in the batter, and pouring 1/2 of sauce in bundt pan & putting the cake back in, then the other 1/2 of sauce on the "bottom".  Poked the surfaces with a fork first.  Also, for the sauce - I added the rum with 3 minutes left to boil, but could still smell the raw alcohol, so let it go an extra minute (I was taking this to a church dinner). The flavor was wonderful & obviously not "boozy".  It was a HUGE hit with everyone!!  I look forward to trying more variations.

Pretty good recipe.  Am a Bacardi girl, but I used Appleton Estates Jamaican Rum (never had it before...very smooth tasting), used a stick of Smart Balance Buttery Taste instead of butter, greased and coated the bundt pan with granulated sugar, used 1-1/2 small 2 oz. packs of chopped pecans (still a little much for me, 1 would do), poked holes with a metal skewer, poured 1/2 of the rum liquid in the pan, put the cake back and poured the rest over the top and sides.  Baked for 45 minutes at 325 and it came out just right.  The only misstep was that I added the ingredients for the rum sauce all at once in the pan to cook on the stove, but it still seemed ok.  I will make again, but will probably poke the cake up a little better so it can soak up the rum sauce more evenly.  The cake looked very pretty.  This was very quick and easy to put together.  A great semi-scratch cake.

The cake: Bacardi Select & Betty Crocker's Yellow cake mix w/pudding. 
The glaze: Appleton Jamaica Rum Special & honey instead of sugar. 
Final product: This tasted like a rum flavored pancake drizzled w/rum flavored syrup like Mrs. Butterworth's.  
To all who bake this cake, read everything mentioned about adding rum to the glaze. Use a large saucepan for the glaze. It didn't take long for the honey & butter to overflow from my small saucepan once these 2 ingredients had gotten hot enough, even after lowering the heat. When removing the saucepan from the heat & adding the rum, it started to overflow again like it was back on the stove! The alcohol in the rum has a low heating point for it to do something like this, so be careful with this step! 
I had more than enough glaze for the cake. I punctured the cake everywhere it was exposed. I removed the cake from the pan, filled the pan with 1/2 of the glaze, replaced the cake & poured the rest of the glaze on top of it. Walnuts, pecans, both are great choices for nuts. Next time, I'll mix the nuts in the batter - the nuts absorbed all the alcohol in the glaze & tasted pretty strong. I'll lessen the honey a tad next time. Great cake w/a glass of milk or coffee!
4/29/2011: Whoever recommended waiting 2 days or more after baking this cake before you eat it was so right! 
(I waited a day.) I will not change a thing about how I made this cake! The more time passed, I was left w/an absolutely scrumptious cake! It lasted a week!:-)

Very moist, very rich flavor. We loved it! I did not have plain vanilla pudding mix, so I used french vanilla pudding mix and it still tasted wonderful. You really can't go wrong with this recipe!

Perfect and easy. Loved it!! Also used less (a little more than 1/4 cup) rum and a little more butter in the glaze. Will definitely make again... probably for New Years!

I start the glaze when I take the cake out of the oven. I let the cake sit in the pan while I am making the glaze. Once the glaze is ready, I remove the cake from the pan, pour half the glaze in the bottom of the pan, and then I carefully put the cake back in the pan making sure I line the ridges up. I then poke holes all over the cake with a butter knife, I then pour the remaining glaze onto the cake (don't let it go over the hole). Let it stand for 10 minutes or so, then carefully flip the cake over onto your serving dish -- DO NOT REFRIGERATE  That advice came courtesy of another allrecipes.com cook. Everything else I did as instructed. This cake is ALWAYS a hit..

Five stars.  Best cake ever.  It is requested for all work pot luck events and family get-togethers as well.  The only thing I change is that I cook ot 53 minutes and I use butter in the batter and 1/4 cup of rum instead of 1/2 cup.  I put the butter in the batter by mistake one time and I loved how much more moist it made the cake so I use every time now.

Great recipe. I have never tried the Tortuga rum cake, but I guess this is as good as it gets. I used the butter yellow cake mix with the included pudding and Myers's Dark Rum for the cake and Malibu Coconut Rum for the glaze. I also caramelized my walnuts and added raisins that have been soaked for at least 3 hours in the rum (folded into the batter). The cake needs to be refrigerated overnight for the glaze to harden. Otherwise, the cake'd be too mushy. The time also allows the rum to mellowed out a little. But the end result's just awesome. All the rum cake recipes here are pretty similar. Modify if need to, to your taste. I think adding the rum soaked raisins and caramelized the walnuts with white or yellow sugar adds a lot of dimension to an already great recipe. Thank you for sharing------ 1) Use dark rum like Myers' or Tortuga Gold. 2) Half cup of rum for the cake is just right. But use flavored rum like Malibu Coconut rum for glaze if you find the regular rum is too strong for your taste. 3) Make the glaze per recipe. Don't cook it too long or use corn syrup to thicken it. The cake will absorb everything and the glaze will harden to the right consistency after refrigerated overnight. This step is very important. 4) Use all the glaze. It won't be too much.  5) Take the cake out. Pour 1/3 of the glaze into the pan. Put the cake back in and brush the rest of the glaze onto the cake. Just let it drips down the cake.  6) Caramelized the nuts. You will like it!

Moist, delicious, and super strong. This one is definitely for grown-ups only. The "glaze" is not the icing-like hardened sugary layer I had imagined, but more like a syrup that takes the cake to the next level. I used Duncan Hines Butter Yellow mix and plain Bacardi rum I had on hand; skipped the nuts b/c my brother is allergic, though toasted nuts would have complemented the rum flavor and balanced the alcohol.  Per reviewer suggestions, I poured half the glaze into the bundt pan, poked a bunch of holes all over the cake using a slim metal chopstick, reinverted, poured the rest of the glaze onto the upside-down cake, and let it sit until it was ready to serve (about 2 hours). Brilliant. I also substituted crushed pineapple (in juice, *not* syrup, which would have been too sweet) for the water.

Made this for Mothers Day, and it was a hit! I baked this for about 50 minutes, let it cool for 10 minutes before flipping it out on a cookie sheet. I then prepared the glaze. I poured the rum in after cooking, but let it sit for about 5 minutes. During that time I poked holes all over the cake. I then poured half the mixture into the bunt pan and then added the cake back and poured the rest of the glaze on the bottom of the cake. I let the cake sit in the fridge for about 36 hours before I took it out and let it get to room temp before serving. It was a huge hit needless to say. I used Capt. Morgans Spiced Rum.

I did not use the nuts and it is yummy even without them.

Okay guys i tryed a little i will admit i made 2 cupcakes out of the batter just to see what it tasted like.And i must say this was really good i see why the people always want a rum cake every week.The macadamian nuts makes itr so good.But i really think it's the glazed that set this cake off.You can just eat the glazed by itself.So here i am again making two more cakes for someone for friday.So i will add the milk instead of water butter instead of oil a little,and 1 Tsp of vanilla extract or maybe i will add 1 tsp of  each almond extract and vanilla extract.

This recipe is awesome!  I made it for a gathering of friends as well as a family picnic.  The cake received rave reviews.  I used Bacardi rum because that is all I had and it was fine.  For the glaze, once I took the pot off the stove, I let the butter/sugar mixture cool for one minute before I very gradually added the rum.  This made for a perfect consistency.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Can I give it 6 stars? OMG. Hands down the best cake I've ever made. We just got back from Grand Cayman where they make the rum cakes, and unfortunately my husband is allergic to nuts so he couldn't eat any there. But my goal was to find a fabulous recipe once we got home so he could experience the goodness that is RUM CAKE. I used Meyers dark rum,substituted milk for water and omitted the walnuts. We devoured it in less than 12 hours. THE GLAZE is the bomb, and if you can stand it make a double batch of glaze and soak the cake in a big bowl of it, turning it over a couple times. It's truly an insanely wonderful recipe. It tastes like a giant donut with booze in it ! :) Thank you so much for sharing this, we LOVE LOVE LOVE it :)

Oh my gosh!!!  This is the best cake ever!  I made it for Thanksgiving at my in-laws and it was gone before any other dessert.  Everyone loved it - even my husband who doesn't like most cakes.  The only thing I will do differently in the future is mix the nuts into the cake.  Otherwise, no changes needed.

To the reviewer who prefers a "wet cake". Remove cake from pan, pour some of the glaze into pan, reinsert cake, poke a few holes in cake, pour on remaining glaze. Let the cake sit and absorb glaze, flip it onto a plate. This is a great cake regardless of how you choose to prepare it.

Really good. I've made this about 4 times now over the past few weeks, and that's saying a lot for a non-cake-making person! I think the best one, though, was when I made it in mini muffin tins as I wanted individual bites for a Christmas party. Baking time was shortened to about 10-12 minutes, and best in a light pan (dark pans make the bottoms too dark, tops too light). I made it a few times with regular dark rum, then upped it a bit with Meyers rum. Thought it'd be too much, but it gave it just the right punch and flavor. Also added coconut to the batter...one time toasted, one time not, didn't taste a difference, so don't waste your time toasting it. For the mini cakes, I used the same technique as suggested initially (pour glaze into the cake pan) and brushed the tops. Wow...they got soaked! Made them taste like the Baba au Rhums that I remember as a kid...rum-soaked and delish. You might wanna keep 'em away from the kids, although my 15-year-old thinks they're illicit treasures! Thanks so much for something I'll make often!

Grabe!  Now I won't buy those expensive rum cake slices in pattisseries.  I now know how to make one that's as pretty and delicious as well.  The tip on glazing is really fantastic.  Rum is absorbed pretty well doing this technique.  Just don't forget to do some pricking on the cake!

I have made this recipe for 40 years. It was originally published in the 70s or early 80s by Bacardi and was known as the Bacardi rum cake. I too make it was Myer's rum because it's much smoother. This, however, is not an original recipe for rum cake and credit should be given to Bacardi. I still have the original recipe card that we got from the liquor store!

A friend of mine has been making her "secret recipe rum cake" for years.  I tried this recipe three years ago so I could make one myself  It was absolutely amazing!  I use Captain Morgan Spiced Rum and it is a HIT any time I make this :-)

My preference is to substitute the vegetable oil with coconut oil.

Have made this cake several times and it always turns out great. I just tried a variation that was awesome. I used Malibu Caribbean Rum with coconut liqueur and added 3/4 C of coconut to the cake. I also used the Pillsbury cake mix with pudding and still added the vanilla pudding. Instead of walnuts I used pecans. This was the moistest and most flavor able rum cake I have made.

I decided to make this cake for a family gathering, but as I started mixing the batter I realised the bottle of rum I thought I had wasn't there....in a panic I noticed a bottle of Amaretto...so out of desparation thats what I grabbed...it was delicious!! I just switched out the walnuts for some almonds to match the flavor and it came out perfect! Might even prefer it to the rum lol

I made this Rum cake the day before Christmas Eve and it was a hit sensation with my family.  I followed the recipe except that I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts and I added a tsp of vanilla to the glaze. I can honestly say that I have never had such a moist cake.  I followed the advice of some of the reviewers and used a skewer to poke holes in the cake while it was still in the bundt pan for half the glaze. The glaze just soaked right in. The other half of the glaze, I carefully poured into the sides of the pan to stream down the sides of the cake.  It worked out great.  I inverted the cake in its dish but kept the cake in the bundt pan until we were ready for it. It kept the moisture locked in. I highly recommend this recipe.  It will be a hit for anyone that appreciates a delicious rum cake.

Amazing cake. However, instead of rum, I like to use Amaretto liquer . This gives it an Italian feel. It is usually gone in 1 hour from when I bring it out at parties!

Made this for my husband's birthday. First time making rum cake. I'm not fond of rum cake but I can't stay away from it! So good and moist. I used puerto rican rum because that's what I had. Didn't use nuts. Used carving fork to poke holes in bottom of cake. The glaze didn't go all the way through but it doesn't really matter bc the cake is sooo 
moist! However I will try chop stix next time as another review suggested. Others commented that the cake tastes better with age... IT'S TRUE! Made it two days ago and it's even better today!  Will make again!  Yum!  
Ps I only used 1/2 the rum for the glaze bc I didn't want it to be too overpowering, glad i did.

Strong!  Beware all the alcohol won't soak in because there is just too much.  Delicious cake but cut back on the liquor in the glaze.

This is THE BEST rum cake recipe, and I don't like rum! It is perfect as written. Last year I made mini bundt cakes as gifts. I mixed half coconut rum half dark rum. Even better than the original. Everyone loved them and has requested them again this year. I found that when I made the mini's I needed to make a little extra sauce. They also freeze nicely so you can make these ahead of time to make the holidays less stressful.

I have made this recipe for years, I didn't get it from this site, but everyone always loves it. At parties, I always get compliments and requests for the recipe. My only change is that I use about 1/2 the amount of pecans. Also make sure to boil the glaze for 5 minutes or else it will be sugary/grainy when you pour over the cake.

When I started making this cake quite a few years ago I had a neighbour who used to go nuts over it and I swear she could smell it before it cooled.  Excellent cake and I always used dark rum.  
Did try golden but not as good.

Cake was amazing! Very import to grease and flour the the center part of the bundt pan too.. or else you end up with parts of a rum cake instead of a whole one :) I thought the glaze was a little strong for my taste, I will try again with a little less rum in the glaze, and I'll grease and flour the entire pan.

I have used this recipe for many years.  It is simple, delicious and no fail.  Sometimes I use lemon pudding along with fresh lemon juice and/or lemon extract.  I substitute orange liqueur instead of the rum. I have also used coconut extract and coconut rum, very tasty! If you want to use pecans, place one whole pecan in each bottom ridge and very carefully pour in batter. Makes it pretty.  I prefer to pour the glaze around the inside and outside edges of the bundt pan before removing the cake.  Soaks in wonderfuly and still creates a glazed appearance on the whole cake.

My mom used to make this cake all the time too.  I'm so happy that I used the suggestion of someone else and substituted coconut milk for the water in the cake.  It turned out fantastic.  Also, the idea of taking the cake out of the pan, adding half of the glaze to the pan and returning the cake to soak in the glaze is good advice.  That way after you pour the other half of the glaze on top of the cake, it gets fully saturated all over.  I used Captain Morgan spiced rum.

Very simple recipe to make - very tasty.  Didn't realize we were out of rum, so tried it with Goldschlager cinnamon schnapps.  Also used brown sugar in the glaze since I wasn't sticking completely to the recipe, and because I didn't have the full amount of schnapps left for the glaze.  Still, it came out fine - though I don't think anyone will see the little gold flakes from the schnapps.

I have been making this cake for about 2 years now.  I get rave reviews everytime and its so easy!  It tastes like a Tortuga cake to me:)    MAKE SURE: 1. you use the baking PAM or Bakers spray (with flour) to coat your pan 2. let it cool completely before turning it out of the pan. (I only say this because I have had awful mishaps when i first started with the above two!)  Quick tips:  -save some of the glaze to put on top -poke holes to ensure it gets in the cake -use different flavors of pudding.  Pistachio and banana are very nice (think of totuga rum cakes!) -works well in mini bundt too -keep airtight -makes a great gift!

Excellent and super moist!  I made this with coconut rum instead because we do not like dark rum and it tastes unbelievable!  Used a cake pan instead of a bundt pan, the bundt pan can make the cake to crunchy on the outside.  Its my go to cake recipe, not just for the holidays

This was DELICIOUS!  I halved the rum in the glaze and then wish I hadn't.  We wanted more rum flavor. Guess we like our drink. :-)  Do make sure that your cake mix doesn't already have pudding in the mix prior to buying since the recipe calls for pudding.  I used pecans as well and followed another reviewers advice to turn the cake out of the pan, pour some glaze on the bottom of the pan and lay the cake back down in it. I also glazed the other side after poking holes all over the cake.  I turned it upside down in the pan on my cake plate and let it rest for hours before uncovering it.  It was one of the best cakes I've ever had!

Love this cake, comes out perfect every time. A neighbor makes it every Christmas for a local farmers market and sells a whole one for about $20+ dollars and or a large slice for $5 ea. Asked once for recipe but she said it was her sisters so she could not share it. It then took me less than 5 minutes to locate it online. Now I re-produce it for about $3 and get to eat as much as I want and share the recipe with everyone! Thanks allrecipes, Jackie Smith and the world of the internet. I also have friends in Florida that make it using chocolate cake mix and pudding versions all year round!

This is fantastic!  I put a little shredded coconut and brown sugar in the bottom of the bundt pan.  I also poured half the batter in the pan, then added a thin layer of brown sugar, and topped with the remaining batter.  It's even better the second day.  I only used 1/4 cup of rum in the glaze, instead of 1/2 cup.  It's potent, but Mmmm Mmmm goooood!

Excellent recipe!! Made it for Christmas and everyone LOVED it! Very moist- used walnuts but next time I'll use pecans. I refrigerated it for 2 days- didn't hurt it a bit. Also used wooden skewers to make holes in the top to let the glaze soak in- made lots of holes- worked well! Thanks for the great new favorite!!

WOOOOW!  Followed cake and rum glaze to the "T"!  Poked holes in the cake after cooling for ten minutes as recommended by others, and then poured rum glaze over.  Allow to soak in and transfer to a plate.  I made a glaze with approx one cup of powdered sugar, couple tablespoons of water, tablespoon of rum, drop of almond extract, and enough corn syrup to thicken and harden when drizzled onto cake.  Yummy!!!

I made this last night for a girls' night.  I prefer a milder rum flavor to my cake, so if you like to eat cake that tastes like you're drinking straight rum, don't read this review!  :) After baking the cake, I realized I was a little late on time, so was kind of rushed finishing this up.  Thus I only used about 1/2 of the glaze on the cake since I was brushing it on, and if you like a lighter flavor of rum on yours, that may be the way to go.  I also cut the amount of rum to 1/4 cup in the glaze to tone it down a bit.  It was still extremely moist and everyone loved it and the milder flavor.  I loved the amount of nuts, and might even increase it or put them into the batter, as my husband kept walking by and picking the top off the cake (the glazed nuts) the second day it was around.

My husband & aunt totally loved this cake!  I baked the cake the day before we served it and it was still pretty strong.  Still loved it though!  I used coconut milk in place of water in both the cake and the glaze.  I used Myers rum for the cake and vanilla rum for the glaze.  I also tried the glazing technique that everybody comments on and that worked really well.  Actually, after I reinserted the cake and poured the last 1/2 of glaze on, I let it cool for a couple of hours and then wrapped the whole pan in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge.  Took it out an hour or two before we served it the next day.  Aunt and husband have requested for their b-days!  Many thanks for the fab recipe!!!

This was amazing and so easy to make.  Really liked the suggestion of putting half the glaze in the  bunt cake pan, putting the cake back in and then pouring the rest of the glaze over the cake.  It worked great, just remember to poke lots of holes in the cake before you put back in the pan.  I can't wait to try different versions of this reciepe, next time I think I'll try coconut rum.  YUM:)

I have made this cake for about ten yrs.  A few years ago I started making mini loaves to give as Christmas gifts.  This Recipe make 6 mini loaf pans. I poke holes in a slightly cooled cake while still in the pan and then the pour warm glaze,  I usually cover them and let sit over night.

I can not say enough good praises for this cake. Unfortunately today I ran out of rum, and substitued Baileys Irish Cream. It was even better. You must give this a try. As always a receipe is only a guide and use what you have and like. I am thrilled. Thanks to you for something for me to follow.

O...M...G.  I LOVED THIS.  I had to use white/clear rum though instead of dark because our local grocery store didn't have any!  I also used French Vanilla pudding by accident and it was still delicious.  Now this is KEY: I did what somebody else suggested and kept the cake in the pan while pouring the glaze around the edges and on the inside edge as well.  The cake soaked it all up evenly all the way around it.  I kept it in there for a couple of hours, flipped it right side up onto a plate and WOW!!!  SO MOIST!!!  So, instead of 'painting' on the glaze, pour it in the pan!  SOO MUCH BETTER!

OMG!!!!  This is the best cake I have ever made.  Moist, rich, I made a couple of changes just because it was what I had on hand.  Used cocanut cream pudding, 1/2 t. of vanilla in the cake, and Malibu carribean coconut flavored rum in the cake & galze. Wow everyone loves it, I made it yesterday and it will probably be gone today.  A MUST MAKE CAKE. enjoy

Loved the cake. I've made it several times over the year. 

Some variations I've tried that came out great. I used coconut cake mix, with coconut pudding mix and Malibu coconut rum in cake and glaze. Came out great.

I used orange cake mix, with vanilla pudding mix and tropical Malibu rum. Came out great.

I tried substituting malibu coconut rum in cake and glaze with no other changes. Came out great.

Never tried using the regular recipe as of yet. Will try one day I suppose. 

Overall, this is a wonderful recipe that you can do amazing things with. Love it!

I made this when my boyfriends parents came in to town. I used the Meyers dark rum and followed the recipe as written. i loved the cake, but my boyfriend and his parents all htought the rum was too strong (I guess I'm a lush!)  I'll admit it was strong in the glaze since you add the rum AFTER you've cooked it, so the alcohol doesnt really evaporate. The next time I make it I might add the rum and let the glaze cook a little bit longer after that.   I was definitely a help to take the cake out, pour half the glaze in the pan, and then put the cake back in. Nice and moist!

I thought this was SOOOO good, and so did everyone else.  I used applesauce in place of butter in the mix to cut back on the fat a little... but I made up for it by adding a rum chocolate glaze (melt over low heat stirring constantly 4oz. bittersweet chocolate with 2tbsp. butter, remove from heat and add 1 tbsp. corn syrup and 2 tbsp. rum... just drip on to cake).  I used spiced rum (Capt. Morgans) in the cake, and a delicious vanilla rum in the glaze.  Personally, I didn't find the rum overwhelming, I thought it was just right.  I also followed others advice and took the cake out, poured half the glaze in the pan, put the cake back, and poured the rest on top (the bottom of the cake).  Enjoy!

This is an excellent, easy and moist cake. I served it at a ladies luncheon and everyone loved it. I actually followed the recipe exact besides adding a little extra rum. I'm sure you can alter it without any dissatisfaction!

ALWAYS A HIT - TO DIE FOR! I have made this cake so many times now I can't count.  Family, co-workers, potluck. I've never seen one person not finish their piece and most get more!   I don't change a single thing and it is awesome. 
I was worried the first time about pouring 1/2 the sauce in the pan and re-inserting the cake but tried it anyway and it worked out perfectly. I poke holes in the top with a  skewer and spoon the other half of the sauce over the cake (while its in the pan soaking up from the bottom) All of the rum was soaks up within an hour.  Easy!  *Tip - be sure not to let it sit in the pan too long  with sauce or it will start to really cool off and stick to the pan. An hour is usually enough.
Some reviews say the rum is too strong but I disagree. I don't like to drink rum but find the cake to be just right. It is Even better  the second day. Serving it warm with vanilla ice cream is sinfully delicious!
Don't be scared, this is a first time hit!

Really nice. I removed the baked cake from the pan, added the glaze to the pan and put the cake back into the pan. The glaze covered more surface and the cake absorbed every drop.

This was a huge hit over the holidays - especially given the accolades were from Italians who literally grew up on rum cake!  The cake was simple to make (I followed the recipe exactly), but I did have trouble with the glaze at first.  I over-cooked it thinking it had to get thick like an icing.  So I tried again and stopped cooking after 5 minutes and added the rum - it was perfect!  I used Myers Dark Rum - everyone loved it!!

This rum cake has been a traditon in our family for as long as I can remember.  Not for the faint of heart. My brother calls this D.U.I. cake, ha ha.  The only thing I do differently is that I don't use all of the batter, I like the cake to stay level in the pan and not puff up over the pan, it just makes for better presentation. Also, I use a meat marinade injector, that I only use for cakes, to get half of the rum glaze into the cake before removing it from the pan.  Then after I get the cake out of the pan I brush on the remaining glaze.

yes the texture was great andit was very appealing but I couldnt believe how strong the rum taste was in the cake! maybe if only half the glaze was used it would have been ok- my guests opted for the fresh  cut fruit instead. I will definitely not be making this again!!

I decided to make another cake and try a new way with the glaze. What I did was add the rum with the other mixtures.  I stirred while it boiled for about 3 mintues and then I took the cake out of the pan and drizzled over the top of the cake. BEAUTIFUL GLAZE!  If I had of put this in the pan to soak it wouldn't have been pretty at all, as it would have just stuck the cake to the pan like glue. This way you get a real yummy glaze that you drizzle. Tasty and pretty is hard to beat! I hope this helps others. Also, I think if you want that "soak" instead of a glaze, all you have to do is heat the glaze ingredients together and then soak as described. 
PS For the second cake I used pineapple mix, banana pudding, and coconut rum. FAB.

How yummy this was! Only change I made was to double the glaze and while the cake was still hot and in the pan, I took a skewer and make little holes all over the cake. I poured half of the glaze in the holes while it cooled a bit in the pan. Then I inverted the cake and poured the rest of the glaze over it. I only had light rum but it still tasted great! Thanks Jackie for sharing such a yummy recipe!

this was exactly the moist and aromatic rum cake i was looking for. the nuts adds an elegant touch. one suggestion, use jamaican dark rum instead of puerto rican rum, it won't have a bitter aftertaste.thanks for sharing.

SCRUMPTIOUS!!!  This was the first rum cake I've ever made and I don't think I'll ever have to search for another recipe.  I made this cake for a small group and it was raved over!  Several people got seconds, and my family finished it off that evening.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband and I never eat cake, but I had recently found out that he enjoys an occasional piece of rum cake. I had never made one before and when I found Jackie's recipe with all these rave reviews, I made it according to the directions.  It is delicious and we ate the entire cake (by ourselves) in just two days.  I then made a chocolate rum cake, by just changing the cake and pudding mixes to chocolate...again DELICIOUS.  Last night I made a pineapple/coconut rum cake.  I used  a pineapple cake mix and coconut flavoring.  EXCELLENT.  All three cakes have been made from Saturday to Thursday.  I probably had not made three cakes in five years before I found this recipe!! Thank you, Jackie, for a great recipe.  P.S.  I was in a quandry as to the type of rum to use..so I used Myers Dark Rum in all three cakes.  Thanks again.

Wow! What a cake! Its easy, simple, and delicious. I make this cake once a year during Christmas time for my boyfriend's father, who absolutely LOVES rum. I go all out and use his favorite Bacardi light rum brand, and basically substitute all of the liquid used in the recipe with rum (i.e., rum instead of water). And the glaze... I add even more rum! He slices this cake into 12 slices and puts it in the freezer (it doesn't freeze, it has so much rum in it) so he can have a slice every month until the next time I make the cake. Except this past year he asked me to make it again for his birthday, because his wife and kids started eating the cake too, it was so delicious (they don't even like rum that much!). Moist, wonderful, and simple. What more could you ask out of a cake? :) Great job, Jackie!

Wonderful rum cake.  I poked holes with a bamboo skewer to make sure the glaze got into the cake.  Poured half of it over the cake while still in the pan.  After it absorbed that, I removed from the pan, poked holes in the top and poured the rest onto the cake.  I didn't serve it until the next day, and I think that "aging" intensified the flavor.

Excellent !  I didn’t modify the recipe.  Dark rum was used and I did not reduce amount as reviewers suggests.  And I did not “boil out the rum “ in the glaze  as others suggested.  It is a RUM cake.  It was needed on purpose!  I didn’t sift the cake mix.  The only good suggest was to poke the holes.  Excellent cake. Simple.  Don’t over think the cake.

This is a  great recipe. Having made it many times, every time it's delicious. I would like to add one suggestion. Sometimes it's hard to find a non-pudding cake mix ( except Duncan Hines) You can use a cake with pudding mix if you follow some simple changes...Omit instant pudding mix,use 3 eggs instead of 4, and 1/3 cup oil instead of 1/2.  This suggestion comes directly from Bacardi, and it works every time..Enjoy

I used the suggestions here. I used 1/2 cup coconut oil for the oil. I used Pillsberry yellow cake mix which said pudding added and also used the vanilla pudding. I used Malibu spiced rum with coconut liquor. There was no a strong alcohol taste which I liked. I added a quarter cup of coconut to the walnuts on the bottom of the cake and I folded in about 3/4 cup of coconut to the cake mixture. It only took 45 minutes to cook. I did what someone else suggestion. I let it cool in the bundt pan. I make the mixture for the sauce. I poked holes in the top of the cake, poured in half the mixture in the bottom of the bundt pan and then, put the cake back in the pan. I poked holes in the bottom of the cake and poured the remaining mixture on the bottom and around the sides and let it sit overnight. I left it in the pan while we traveled several hours the next day. This made if very easy to travel with. It was my son's 21st birthday and he requested a rum cake.

This recipe was wonderful.  I only had about half as much sugar for this recipe.  I substituted brown sugar and liked it so much that I think I will do it again!  Also, I substituted pecans, because I prefer them to the nuts in the recipe.  It was a huge hit at work.

This cake is good and pretty easy to make. The only issue I have with it is that it calls for too much glaze. I would say half the glaze portion would be plenty. Also, I saw one comment saying, do not refrigerate and I disagree. I put mine in the fridge last night and cut a piece this morning and it was perfect! Keeps it fresher and I personally like rum cake cold. Very moist and the rum is pretty strong...keep that in mind.

OMG, I've made about 6 of these so far!  This cake is everyone's favorite.  I made one three days ago and sent with my husband who works in NY (we live in FL), and tonight I made two, one of which will be FedEx'd to a colleague in Seattle.  This rum cake is awesome.  I add 1/2 c of milk to the posted recipe, to make it super moist.

I love rum cake. I have to say I had a problem with the cake falling too much and in a weird pattern after being removed from the oven. I think it tastes good and i do not have an issue with the amount of rum. Has anyone had the same problem with the cake falling? is it due to not mixing the pudding and cake mix enough?? Any feedback would be awesome!

OMG! This is the most wonderful thing ever!!! I also removed the cake from the pan and put half the sauce in the bottom. Stick holes in the top of the cake and replace in Pan (this took me a minute to plan but is easiest to use 2 plates to invert then match up and slide off). Stick holes in the bottom of the cake after replacing in pan. I can't tell you how great this is!!!!

I have made this recipe for years. A little tip about the glaze ... pour the hot glaze over cake in pan as soon as you take it out of the oven. You will see that all of the glaze will be absorbed into the hot cake. There is no need to poke holes or anything like that - the cake absorbs all of the liquid.

I have made this rum cake serveral times and always get rave reviews. I use Capint Morgan's Spiced Rum and I like to poke holes in the cake with a skewer before brushing the glaze on. Take the time to use a brush and really soak the cake in the glaze. There will still be plenty pooled on the serving dish but it's always better if the cake is moistened well with the glaze.

Super moist and delicious!  I have made it twice so far with substitutions.  I used chocolate cake/ pudding mix and banana rum the first time.  It was literally gone in an afternoon.  Everyone loved it!  The second time I added 1/2 cup mango puree to the batter, used pecans instead of walnuts and used mango rum.  It too came out beautifully and was devoured.  Next time I am making key lime and will replace the water with key lime juice; also, I got Parrot Bay Key Lime Rum just for the cake.  This is a great recipe that allows many variations.  I will be making a lot of these for Christmas this year.

Wow and Wow!  My new edible Christmas gift for neighbors and friends.  I made them in little, muffin sized, bundt shapes.  Taste better after they sit a few days but don't cover them too tightly or they will get a little soggy.  Nummy!

This cake was gone by the end of the night!!!! A must try....I used Malibu coconut rum.. Makes a difference

Made this for a friend's birthday and had to divide up remainder so others could take some home.  Didn't sift the cake mix, but may try that next time.  I honestly don't think it needs any changes as good the way it is.  I am going to try using coconut rum next time just to see if it makes any difference.  Yummy recipe

Made several of these as holiday gifts--received excellent reviews and requests for more! Then on New Year's Day, we had leftover champagne, I made this recipe exactly only substituted the rum with champagne. Again, EVERYONE loved it! Another twist I tried--chocolate cake, chocolate pudding, and Bailey's. The glaze was a bit thick, but was delicious nonetheless.

Wow!!! This is great everyone raved on the cake :O)
I used spiced rum instead of dark rum, and powdered sugar instead of regular sugar, also used unsweetened applesauce instead of oil.  Suggest using Wilton's cake release to spray pan, won't leave flour on your cake.  Also poked holes in top of cake for icing to soak into.
I definately will be making this again. Very Yummy

Delicious! I changed a couple of things to personalize it tho,  instead of flouring the greased pan, I used pumpkin pie spice mixed with sugar and substituted Captain Morgan spiced rum for the dark rum.

Awesome cake!  It was gone in one day!  However, I would definitely cut the rum back in the glaze to 1/4 cup.  I love the rum flavor but it was a bit much to share with my family!

I was asked to make an imitation rum cake and used this recipe. Turned out beautifully-huge crowd pleaser. I used 3 tsp of rum extract per 1/2 cup of rum. Recommend for non-drinkers!

Delicious!! Excellent recipe. I made it exactly as the recipe was written. I can't wait to make smaller versions to give as gifts during the holidays. The cake really is the best after a day or two. LOVE IT!!!

I won a baking contest with this recipe! The only thing I substituted was Alce of Cakes cake mix instead of the regular box of cake mix. I think that helped to add to the "lightness" of the cake. This cake was really good and very easy to make. :)

I made this for my dad for Father's Day.  He's extremely difficult to cook for because he is hyper critical...he LOVED this cake!  He didn't have a single bad thing to say and just raved and raved about it.  He loved how light and moist it is and how delicate yet flavorful the rum is.  He said it was the best cake he's had in 40 years!  My mom was totally jealous!  My dad had three slices that night and requested I make it again for his birthday after a few bites of his first.  This is a home run dessert!  I did pour the sauce into the bunt mold and then put the cake back in to soak it up.  After about 1 minutes I drained what wasn't absorbed, poked holes in the bottom of the cake, and poured the sauce back over it to absorb.  SO good!

Great recipe. I made it for Christmas and I already have people asking if I am going to make it again this year. I used pecans instead of walnuts, and I added a teaspoon of nutmeg, a teaspoon of cinnamon and 3 table spoons of brown sugar.

YUMMY! Made this as the dessert portion of my all girls supper club.  I was rushing to get it finished so I forced it our of the bundt pan and it fell apart a bit.  But the show must go on so I placed it on the serving platter and toted it to the hostesses house.  After dinner, I was about to slice and serve and realized all the little broken pieces were gone.  Turns out some of the ladies were nibbling on it as an appetizer.  Needless to say, there was none left by the end of the evening.  Will definitely make again but will grease pan with more shortening (i used sparingly before) and will allow more time for it to cool before dumping onto platter.

I really love doctoring cake mixes, so I have some experience doing it, and this was a great recipe.  I actually tried it twice. The first time I used a package of cake with the pudding already in it.  I used a little less rum than the recipe called for, maybe 3/4 cup total? - Captain Morgan's Spiced - because it was all I had.  It was DELICIOUS that time!  The second time I followed the recipe exactly using the pudding separate from the cake, and Myers Rum.  I found the rum too overpowering that time - in both the cake and the glaze.  Next time I'll go the easy and watered down version. :)  Really very good though!  Very flexible recipe that you can make your own!

I served this as a Christmas dessert and everyone loved it. HOWEVER, I felt like it wasn't moist enough.  Next time I think I will have a little warm simple syrup (maple honey perhaps) so one can drizzle it on top?
Update:  I used substituted the water with milk as others recommended...boom!  Moist cake!  Love this recipe!!

This cake is so wonderful that my grandmother asked for the recipe!  I've made it a few times and have found that spiced rum really creates a nice toasty flavor.  It's a total diet killer, but I reined it in by only using half of the glaze, maybe a little less, and I really don't think the flavor suffered for it.  Make sure when you buy your ingredients that you get the large package of pudding mix.  I grabbed a small one, and then one more to have on hand, and found out when I got home I needed both (oops).  Great recipe - it got rave reviews from everyone.  Also comes out nice with chocolate cake and pudding mix.

If I could rate this more than 5 stars I would.  Make it a few days ahead and keep pouring the icing on it.  I used spiced rum.  delicious.

This is a delicious, moist, rummy cake - my favourite! I did use the tips the other reviewers (take cake out of pan after baked, and fill pan with half the glaze, etc)and all in all, I would rate it 4.5  BUT, I make the cake again in the same week for the same group of 10 people, as they requested it. AND, they liked the 2nd one better. Why? I use the same changes BUT I also added 1 cup of walnuts in the actual cake batter, and I substituted the vanilla pudding for butterscotch pudding. DELICIOUS, and 5 stars!!

I was CRAVING rum cake and this recipe hit the spot!  Except I got a little buzz from one piece!  I will do as someone else suggested.  First, use Appleton Rum in the glaze versus Bacardi and add the Rum to the glaze for the last minute of boiling.  That should do the trick.  Also, I only used about 1/4 cup of walnuts and it was perfect for me.  Overall it was PERFECTLY DELICIOUS....and very pretty :)  I will never use another rum cake recipe!!  UPDATED SUGGESTION:  This cake gets better and better as the days go on.  If you are making it for something special, make it a few days in advance.  It is to die for!!!

Rum overkill!!!! My husband and I cannot even eat the case beyond the first slice. I made the cake exactly per the recipe. Do yourself a favor and skim the rum in the glaze and ruduce the amount of glaze by half. The only good thing about the cake is that it's super moist in the center.

I'd never had rum cake but thought it sounded good.  The rum taste is so overwhelming. and I even used a quarter cup less than the recipe called for.  There were thirty people at Christmas and we all agreed it was way too rummy.

I had never baked a cake before and this cake made me look like a pro.  Everyone loved it.  I myself could not believe how moist and delicious this came out.  Followed the recipe word for word even doing the glaze trick.  I would not use anything other that Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum for this.  Just terrific!

Holy Cow!  This is fantastic!  My first attempt at rum cake, and it was a huge success.  I've never had such a moist cake before.  I used Cap'n Morgans and pecans, since that's what I had on hand.  I also doubled the glaze and cooked the rum in it to void the alcohol.  I'm going to make this again for a pot luck at work this week!  Yummy!  Update: I have made this several times now, and have found it best to let the glaze sit for about 10 minutes to really blow off the alcohol taste.  Of course, if you want the taste, go for it;)

Great recipe, everyone loved it!! I used banana flavored pudding as someone suggested, not sure it added much banana flavor though.  Next time (oh yes, there will be a next time very soon) I will try pineapple flavored pudding, and include crushed pineapple in the glaze.  Thanks for this recipe.  Oh, one more thing, for the glaze preparation.  After adding the rum, allow the hot glaze to sit for about 5-10 minutes to allow the ethanol to evaporate off.  The top of my cake had a distinct "shot of rum" flavor that might be too much for some guests or kids.

This is one fabulous cake that everyone requests come holiday time. I like to use vanilla rum and add a splash of almond extract to the cake mix. I also use chopped pecans instead of the walnuts. I let the cake cool in the pan, poke holes in it with a BBQ skewer and invert it. I brush the glaze on, pour a bit of glaze in the pan and pop it back in. Then I pour the remaining glaze on top of the cake and I make sure to let some drizzle down the inside of the pan. I always make it the night before I'm going somewhere and take it in the pan. I then invert it once I get there and take my pan home with me.

I made this recently for Thanksgiving.  Now, I usually shy away from recipies that take shortcuts like pre made cake mixes, but I figured that on top of all the other thanksgiving preparations, I could cut a corner here--and wow, was it worth it.  What a great recipie.  I did make a change or two though... I used 2/3 cup of buttermilk insead of water in the cake batter, and I added lemon zest to the glaze... WONDERFUL!  The tangy buttermilk and the lemon are perfect for each other!  I am going to try a more traditional recipie where you actually make custard and home made cake batter and combine the two... we'll see how they compare.

YUMMY - This recipe seems to be very forgiving, as all I had on hand were a golden butter cake box mix and butterscotch instant pudding (instead of vanilla) and I received raving reviews.  Strangers at a friends' Southern Living party "HAD" to find out who made that cake and try to get the recipe  :-)  I also doubled the glaze ingredients (except rum), boiled my glaze for just a minute after adding the rum to soften the flavor, took the cake out of the pan added about 1/4 of the glaze to the pan then put the cake back in and poured the rest of the glaze over the cake and let it cool completely before turning out on a serving plate.  This will definitely get made again!

I've made this cake exact to the recipe.  I get requests to make it for special occasions all the time.  Today, I'm making one for my mother for Mother's day, it's the only thing she asked for.  

Follow the instructions.  I didn't even do what other folks recommended.  Just make sure you take the glaze off the burner before slowly adding the rum (which will sizzle) and stir frequently.  

Phenom!  No fancy tricks.  Just follow the recipe as stated.

Delicious!! I did as one reviewer suggested and sifted the yellow cake mix and pudding to ensure that the batter would be clump free and the cake would turn out fluffy. I also substituted 1/2 C. Skim milk instead of 1/2 C. water into the cake batter. I used a dark rum I bought while I was in the Dominican, and it was a-mazing! My cake only took 40 minutes to bake, so make sure you watch yours while it's in the oven. I also used a long wood skewer to poke holes all over so the rum sauce would seep in. It turned out beautifully!

I made this into a banana rum cake.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I used butter pecan cake mix instead of the yellow cake mix.  For each of the 1/2 cups of rum, I used banana rum.  I used all the other ingredients as directed in the recipe.  I did boil the glaze mixture to cook out the alcohol.  I made this 3 days in advance so all the flavors could blend well.  Every time we have our group over, they request this cake.  I am more than glad to cook it because it is EXCELLENT!

WOW!!  This was great, I made this by request for a friend's surprise 50th birthday.  It was a huge hit.  I wish I could have let it sit for a day but it was wonderful anyway.  I made it with Meyer's Rum and sliced almonds (it was what I had on hand) and everyone raved about the cake.  Thank you for sharing!!!

This is a great cake! I added a little cinnamon and ginger for that extra special homemade touch. Also I used Meyers Rum and decreased it a little. I followed previous reviewer’s tips on poking holes in the cake and reinserting it in the pan. The longer it sits the deeper the flavor gets. Everyone at out Thanksgiving dinner complimented this cake and asked "what’s in it". Thanks for the post!!!

Well, I suggest if you don't like rum to avoid making a rum cake because this truly is a rum cake. I actually enjoyed mixing the ingredients together. It was like bringing all of the secrets of the islands to our oven! I just licked the last little piece off of the plate! Thank you for this wonderful rum cake that joyfully tastes like rum cake!

Love this cake! All I had was a small package (1 oz) of sugar free/fat free butterscotch pudding and it turned out delicious!  The key to reducing the alchoholy flavor in the icing is adding the rum and letting it simmer for a minute or two. It cooks all of the alcohol out and leaves the yummy flavor of the rum. Great cake! I will definitely make it again!

Oh man, this is such a big hit.  I made this the first time with Bacardi thinking rum is rum, but the second time around I used Appleton and it made a difference!  Definitely pour half the glaze in the pan and then put the cake back in and let it soak.  The longer you let it soak, the better!  I might even increase the glaze next time.  Will make for the rest of my life!

This is unbelieveable awesome. The taste is killer...however, I had a hard time getting the glaze to soak into the cake..I like my rum cakes "wet" into the top and the glaze only stuck to the outside. I both brushed the first few layers on then put it into the pan with the rest and let it soak. Next time I'll poke holes to drizzle in..but the taste was PERFECT! Great recipe!

Very good rum cake, it does, however need at least 36 hours to set and mellow in flavor.  I think it's best after 48, but could be just me.  Wonderful flavor.

I wanted to try this cake right away but all we had in the house was a clear-colored banana rum.  So I said, "what the hey," and tried it, and it came out fabulous.  The hint of sweet banana flavor mixed with the rum really packed a punch.  I recommend 1/3 cup of this kind of rum to be used in the glaze. Wrap it up tightly or you'll be eating it all day long!

This rum cake is wonderful.  I have made it so many times and it has become my signature cake.  I was just looking through my recipie box and noticed I had never rated it.  The only tweak to the recipie is to use powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar for the glaze and always use the Duncan Hines brand yellow cake mix.  I also love it because the rum is not overpowering, the cake is not saturated like commercial brands.  It is just moist enough.  My friends and family love it and it has never gone uneaten.

I love this cake. I always bring it to work - we all call it happy cake (sometimes I put a bit more rum) I found it easier to, instead of brushing the rum mixtures over the cake, to take the cake out of the pan fill it with the miz and then put the cake pack into the bundt and kind of roll it on its edges for a little while so it gets the side too. JUST DON'T LEAVE the cake upside down overnight it gets too soggy

This is our family's designated "special occasion" cake.  I love holidays just for this cake!  Make exactly as the recipe states, no additions, leave nothing out. I have to give it all away or I'll eat the whole thing myself!

My family has been making this cake for years.  Very yummy and satisfying.  Tip:  We poke holes in the bottom of the cake while it is still warm(use a cake tester) and pour the glaze over the  cake.  Wait until the glaze is absorbed before turning out of the pan.  Delicious!

This was loved by everyone!  The rum I used was Myers dark rum.  I thought the bottom of the cake was a bit strong, but others said it was wonderful!  It was served with vanilla ice cream.  I also only used half of the glaze, because I didn't want the cake to get soggy.  Wonderful recipe!

Awesome cake!!!  I changed it up a little to make it a coconut rum cake.  Instead of walnuts in the beginning, I used shredded coconut.  Instead of vanilla pudding, I used coconut pudding, and instead of regular rum, I used Malibu (cocnut flavored rum).  It turned out EXCELLENT!  Just like the cake that Tortuga makes in Grand Cayman.

A hit at my office. I used less rum as many other reviewers suggested about 1/2 what the recipe called for.  I used part parrot bay coconut rum and part dark.  I also did not have a yellow cake mix so I used french vanilla instead and it worked out fine!!

This was great. I made it 4x in one week to bring to give as gifts and bring to a party. As for the one I brought to the party, I tossed a pint of rasberries and black berries in a 1/4 cup of sugar and refrigerated it for about 30 minutes. I then took the berry mixture and filled the center of the cake with it. I also garnished the sides with some strawberries. It was wonderful. The fruit was a great compliment to the cake.

This recipe was a cinch to make.  Baker's Secret is a great non stick shortcut to use instead of using shortening and flour seprately for your bundit pan.  The cake baked perfectly.  I used Bacardi Select for the rum.  The correct sugar for the glaze is granulated white sugar, just like the recipe says, not confectioner's sugar.  I thought there was a bit too much glaze, but other than that everything went perfect.  Thanks for the super recipe.

We travel to the carribean several times a year. This cake is awesome! Better than any island bought cake.  I have made this many times for my husband.  It is one of his most favorite.  I have also made this for both his office and my office, inaddition to baking it for some important customers (I am in outside sales) It always receives rave reviews and never any leftovers. I have tried many different rums and now I usually use Bermuda Black Seal rum for the straight forward rum cake.  Found it to be better than any other (including Bacardi, Myers, etc.) But for a change/ feature flavor, you can try one of the many flavored rums (banana, coconut, vanilla, etc) Try replacing the water with pineapple juice and using coconut flavored rum instead of dark rum. Makes a much better Pina Colada cake than the one listed on this site! I have also used chocolate cake and chocolate pudding. Also, cook the rum in the glaze for a minute or so. It will warm you all the way down.
Thanks for sharing, Jackie!

Very good, if you REALLY like rum.  I will lay off the rum a little next time I make it though.  A bit too strong for us, but good all the same.

This is the BEST rum cake recipe that I have ever made! I have people beg me to make this! It is AWESOME. One word of caution, the smell of the sauce is quite strong while cooking. Use caution. :)

I thought the rum glaze was too intense...next time I'll add the rum while the glaze is boiling to cook some of the alcohol out.  HOWEVER, I made this to take into work and everyone went nuts over it!!!  More cake was demanded so I guess I'll have to make rum cake again to take to the Christmas party!

I was looking for something different to serve to my guests and discovered this ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS rum cake.  If you like Rum Cake, this is DEFINITELY a cake for you.  Make sure you follow the authors advice and pour half of the glaze back into the pan, re-invert the cake and pour the rest of the glaze over the cake.

Yes, I sprinkled greased pan with cinnamon sugar, used 1/2 pecans and walnuts, used buttermilk in batter, not water, boiled the rum in glaze, didn't add later..it became a better consistency  that way .  I know what people meant when they said it tasted like yellow cake mix..I agree...BUT...I experimented with it....and found if you don't serve it for AT LEAST 2 DAYS, or even longer, after making...it has a whole better taste.....no longer the " yellow cake mix" taste! More like " butter rum" ....Yum!

I absolutely love this cake. I had been looking for a rum cake recipe and found this one. I followed the recipe to the letter I just used gold rum and dark brown sugar instead of regular sugar. I loved the previous idea of pouring half of the glaze in the bottom of the pan and placing the cake back in after poking holes with a toothpick. I then poke holes in the bottom of the cake, poured the rest of the glaze on and then for an added twist I added about 1/4 cup more of the gold rum. I leave it to sit over night after I invert it and place it on a serving plate and place it in cake box. It comes out so moist and delicious I've gotten several requests to make this cake for birthday parties. I love to bake and I'm adding this cake to my recipe box.

Brought this to Christmas Eve dinner with friends and they looovvvved it! 
I used Captain Morgans Rum (though I'm not too sure how much of a difference it makes),  I also used white cake mix instead of yellow, so that it's not so obvious that I used cake mix.  
Very delicious with the nuts and very nice golden look when it comes out :) 
Tasted it and  the cake was leaning on the too sweet side, so I added blackberries around the rim and in the middle of the bundt which added a lovely garnish and provided the perfect balance of tart that this needed!!

delicious!  the variations  I made:
-instead of vanilla I used butterscotch instant pudding
-I used a yellow buttermilk cake recipe instead of box cake mix
-real butter instead of veggie oil
-pecan bits instead of walnut

I took the advice of another poster and slit holes In the bottom of the cake while it is  reinserted Into the pan for the glazing part.....so moist and flavorful.

This was AMAZING!  I followed the suggestion to use Myers Dark Rum for the cake and Appleton's for the glaze.  Let it sit for a day and that's about all you'll see of it!

I know this recipe as Puerto Rican rum cake. I've made it lots of times and it's a winner. To me it needs more rum sauce but I make it as is. If you've ever had the Tortuga Rum Cake (YUMMY) I think it has less rum than that one. I've had Irish whiskey cake and to me that has a lot of liquor but oh so good!

After I bake it I leave in pan poke holes and pour most of the sauce in the holes so it CAN BE ABSORBED IN THE CAKE.   Once cooled I flip it onto plate and pour the rest on top. Delish

Ps. I used butter instead of oil.

Although I loved this recipe the folks at work felt the rum was way too strong. It's a matter of preference and not for the faint of heart or for kids since there is definitely a kick with all of the rum.

By far my absolute favorite cake. Forget chocolate or buttercream or anything else, I want this cake! So moist and delicious. And it just gets better with age (a few days anyway). I used a light Bacardi rum and left off the walnuts, it comes out perfect.

I've made this recipe a few times with several variations by changing the cake mix, pudding mix, and the alcohol.  So far I've made yellow pumpkin Kahlua, chocolate Kahlua and coconut lime.  I bake in cupcake pans for about 22 minutes, cool, and put the glaze into the pan before putting them back in to soak.  After taking back out, they are almost saturated, but they do dry to a sticky coating and are delicious!  It does have a decent kick from the glaze, so it's definitely not for the kiddos.

I just made this didn't have a bunt pan so I ended up making the best cup cakes out of this world. I made this for Valentines Day for my brother and I because we are both born on Valentines Day, 7 yr's apart. I know that my boyfriend is going to love these since his favorite thing to do is eat sweets. I give this 5 stars I would give 10 stars if I could thank you for the recipe I will be making this more often in the winter since I'm the baker in the family since we have no more parents or grandparents around. Can't wait to give my brother his present he is the best brother has been a gift to me since he was born.

Delicious!

Kirkland Spiced Rum: Added 1/8 cup extra rum to both batter and glaze.

Jello-O Banana Cream Instant Pudding: Substituted for a more tropical flavor.

Glaze Process: Poked holes into top of cake with skewer, poured glaze into empty bunt pan, then flipped cake back into pan for 10 minutes to soak up glaze. Much less messy than pouring glaze onto right side up cake.

My family and I love this recipe so much that I made three cakes in the past two weeks. (Obviously I have a big family, two sides;we like the combination of rum with sweet).  Although after reading the reviews I made some minor adjustments based on some of the suggestions, which was to remove cake from pan glaze then replace in pan and continue to glaze. The flavor was rich and the cake was moist. Just the way we like it! Thank you to all who provided their feedback, both positive and constructive. : )

My go to cake recipe now...love it. I used toasted pecans instead of walnuts and a Butter cake mix instead of yellow. 
I used a bakers spray on the pan and then sprinkled sugar inside the pan prior to adding the mix. I also added a little more butter in the glaze. Like others, I poked the bottom of the cake with a metal skewer and then poured a little over half the glaze on it. I let it sit for about 10 minutes then inverted the cake onto a plate, poured the remaining glaze over the cake and put it in the frig. Delish! I am going to make this cake many, many more times :)

Have been making this cake for ages. I do have questions now. The nuts always seem to stick to the bottom of the pan. Anyone else have this problem? Then I tried to use Pam cooking spray instead of butter to grease the pan-huge mistake -had to almost scrape them out of the Bundt pan. Also when I do the glaze I leave the cake in the pan and pour the glaze into the pan then turn it out when it is cool. Maybe this is why the nuts stick? This recipe is fabulous.Lastly this year I bought smaller Bundt pans-1 packaged cake mix was enough for 2 of the pans-so each recipe made 2 cakes. I wrapped them up and gave them as gifts. I would love to send them by mail to people and see that someone wrote they did mail them and they got there fine. How do you mail them? I assume in a tin of some kind?

Then i let this cake cool until i made the syrup , pouring in the bottom, and let sitting for 1 hr , then flipped over and poked holes and poured remaining syrup on top of cake , let sit at least 24 hr's before eating .

This is a great recipe. I brought it on a multi- family vacation. Young adults were sneaking into our house to get some. One even asked me if I would just give him the rest of it behind everyone else's back! Haha.

I have used allrecipes.com for about 3 years now and this is the 1st time I have given a review...but this recipe deserved it!  The cake is "the most delicious cake I've ever had" by many friends and family.  Only modifications..I used GLAZED pecans, I spread butter and dusted sugar the bundt pan.  I used Spiced 100 proof rum (because the higher the proof the smoother the taste).  I used Golden Butter cake mix and french vanilla pudding mix.  I used an onion holder "poker" and made many holes in the cake after taking out of oven.  I left it in pan and drizzled glaze all over and covered with foil and let soak in overnight.  Next day sliced and served.  Even better served warmed up with butter pecan (or bourbon pecan praline Haagen Das) ice cream.  You may want to cut back on the rum in the glaze a little if you don't like rum(:

The cake turned out very well! The glaze was great, too, but I think next time I am going to use a little less rum, like maybe third of a cup of rum and two thirds cup of water, because it was really strong. I guess it could be the rum I have. We're not very knowledgeable about alcohol, so we just asked at the liquor store what kind they recommended for cooking with.

Huge hit with all who tried it. Substituted toasted pecans for the walnuts. Used Pyrat dark rum. I love the idea of poking holes in the top/bottom so the glaze can seep down inside. Super easy and came out perfectly. This recipe is a keeper! For people who don't love the strong flavor of the rum glaze, add the rum before it's done cooking so the alcohol burns off a bit. You can also leave the rum out of the glaze and make a rum-flavored whipped cream to accompany for those who appreciate a nice rum flare.

Made this last week - I used Captain Morgan rum in both the cake and the glaze, because its what I had on hand. I used pecans because I like them better and had no walnuts. I also used coconut cream pudding mix instead of vanilla, and in the glaze I used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. I baked it for 50 minutes - more would have dried it out. The glaze was absorbed within an hour. Putting the cake back into the pan was the charm. My husband and I LOVED this cake - it was gone in 2 days! Great recipe - is good as it is yet yields easily to changes.

Simple to make. Simpler than I would have guessed!
Tastes delicious
Lots of helpful reviews - read them and take their advice
(fat free milk instead of water, rum brands, cake brands, pudding brands)

Deeee-lish! I cut the glaze in 1/2 the 2nd time I made it. The full amount is way too much unless you want the cake to weigh 10lbs :-)

I made this cake for my stepmom's birthday, at her request. I'm not one who typically bakes a cake from a boxed mix but I've go to tell you, this went over extremely well with the group who devoured it. I used pecans instead of walnuts (stepmom's request) and used Captain Morgan spiced rum which was just fine in this. Very moist and flavorful cake!

Everyone loves this cake! Do make it with milk instead of water. I omit the nuts. To make additional glaze I melt an additional 1/4 cup butter, then add in 1/4 cup more rum and 1/2 cup powdered sugar. It is absolutely perfect, amazingly yummy, and great for breakfast! The idea of putting the cake back in the pan to soak up the glaze is genius.  Add bananas and banana rum for a banana rum cake!

I made this cake exactly as stated in the recipe.  After the cake was done I let it cool for 10-15 minutes then removed it from the pan.  I poked about 40-50 holes in the top of the cake with a metal skewer and spooned on some glaze.  Then I poured glaze into the bundt pan and replaced the cake.  Then I poked 40-50 holes in the bottom of the cake and spooned the rest of the glaze on.  I let it sit in the pan for a few hours then removed it onto my cake plate.  I made the cake about 36 hours ahead of time and by the the time we went to eat it after Christmas dinner the rum flavor had mellowed quite a bit.  There are some complaints in the reviews about the cake being too "rummy" but I think this can be solved by NOT digging into the cake immediately after making it.  I also made homemade whipped cream with vanilla, and a pinch of cinnamon, ginger, and allspice to serve with it.

Outstanding recipe! This is the first rum cake I've ever made and it turned out great. I followed the recipe to the letter this time but next time I make it I'm going to add German Chocolate icing to the batter and use a Parrot Bay Rum glaze

The cake turned out fantastic! I used Betty Crocker yellow mix which has pudding mix in it but I still added the pudding mix anyways. I added some crushed walnuts in the batter like others suggested. Now I am addicted to it. I am doing the chocolate version right this minute. Hope it will turn out good as well :)

I searched the stores and could not find 18.5 oz. cake mix.  So I went ahead and used the smaller quantity available, and it didn't seem to make any difference.  Or maybe I don't know what I missed!  I guess it's another case of less product for the same money.

One of the best cakes I've ever had! Amazing flavour! I added 1/2 cup milk instead of the water, and I didn't wait for the cake to cool before I added the rum glaze.  I just left the cake in the pan and poked holes in the cake with the end of a chopstick, and poured the glaze over top. Worked perfectly. I'm making another as I write this review!
I covered the cake with a cream cheese frosting. Fantastic!!!

I used Pineapple Rum for this recipe and skipped the nuts and it turned out incredible!! No need to keep looking for recipes, I'm perfectly happy with how this turned out, I'm sure I'll make this again. At first I thought there would be too much glaze but I think it could even stand a bit more than the recipe calls for. I'd recommend pouring the glaze over the bottom of the cake while it's still in the pan and let it soak for 45 mins or so.

Wow-great, EASY recipe! I omitted the nuts as I wasn't sure if everyone could eat them and used Coconut Rum for subtle flavor. I did cook the glaze with the rum for 1 minute so it didn't taste too much like alcohol. Everyone loved it!!

This is my first time baking with booze where the booze actually makes it into the batter -- and I must say it went really well!

I used Captain Morgan's Tattoo rum, which smelled incredible. It also gave it a lot of warmth and sweetness. It's definitely a mixer rum, which is why I picked it. Plus, who can resist the Captain? He's a pretty charming, good looking pirate!

Overall, it turned out great!!! I would definitely make this again, and I probably will. Though, the only note I'd make is to cut the glaze recipe in half, because that's all I needed to really soak into the cake.

this is the best ever.  We are non drinkers so I got the rum from a neighbor and took them over part of the cake.  They said best ever and last night brought me a whole brand new bottle and asked for more rum cake.  This is a cake you can not stop eating and not sure how long it will last as ours is eaten so fast but it stays moist until the last bite at our house.

Have made some similar recipes before but this one is simply the BEST we have ever had.  Moist, lots of sauce; I served it with rum flavoured whipped cream.  Cake came out beautifully thanks to the walnuts in the pan.  Divine! (And easy!)

Have made this one several times each year, for years...occasionally try a different version, but always come back to this one.  My family and friends love the original version.... (me too!)

Cake fell apart and the rum taste was too strong - may try again, but doubt it.

Awesome moist, must make again recipe!!!  Family and friends raved over this cake.  I'm not a drinker and could only sample a pinch and it was very moist and "rummy".  Will definitely recommend to make again.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.

I made this once with Baccardi dark rum and the strong alcohol flavor didn’t mellow. I didnt add the rum to the boiling glaze quickly so perhaps the temp wasn’t high enough to cook some of the alcohol off. This is a favorite recipe in our family so new rums are being experimented with and ensuring recipe is followed to the T.

it was good but way way to moist for my liking and to much rum, it could have been the type I used and I only used one type since that all I had, but I would say for any one else making this for the first time, use a very mild rum for the glaze and I would cut it down for what it calls for

Absolutely fabulous! My favorite is coconut rum, but any rum is good, and I've tried them all. This cake is even better the next day. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

This cake was easy to make. In addition to the rum glace, I also added a rum frosting consisting of icing sugar, milk, vanilla, and rum.  I found the rum glaze to give the cake too much of an alcoholic taste.  Next time I would add the rum to the glaze while it was still cooking to cook off the alcohol.

Even though I got great raves from the cake, I was not as impressed with this cake compared to other bundt cakes from this site.

I have to rate this 5 stars simply because it is the exact same recipe as the Irish Cream Bundt cake (except with rum). Both are delicious

This cake is very moist and delicious.  I plan on making this for all family events.  In the future may add a little less rum to glaze, rum is very overpowering.  Otherwise tastes exactly like Caribbean rum cakes.

Delicious!!!! This was my second cake within a week. I made one for a family gathering and they at it all so I made another one for work and they loved it. Just make sure you let the topping boil until it becomes a thick syrup (I learned this with the 2nd cake). Yummy

Oh my goodness!!  This is so easy and so good!!  I made 15 of these this year for Christmas gifts!  I used the technique others suggested for glazing by putting glaze in the pan and putting the cake back in the pan then inverting.  I was not totally pleased with this method.  The very top of the cake gets very soggy.  I probably will not do that again.  I made mine without nuts because they were gifts and not aware of food allergies I opted to omit.  Still wonderful!

I have been making this cake for a few years and now at Christmas I make about twenty cakes for friends of mine. I use Malabu rum in batter and Bacardi rum in glaze. I do not use a 1/2 a cup in the glaze. Depends on your taste.Everyone raves about this cake.

I added 1tbsp of vanilla extract to the batter for a stronger vanilla flavor, but otherwise stuck with the instructions --- the cake turned out phenomenal. Moist, rummy, and absolutely delicious.

This has become my husband's favorite cake. Maybe even favorite desert. We both like that, because the rum in the glaze doesn't get cooked, it's especially rummy. I wouldn't change a thing.

let me start by saying that i'm rating the glaze, not the cake.  i wanted to make a cake from scratch so i made the cream cheese pound cake recipe from this site.  i followed the directions for the butter rum glaze to a tee.  at first i was worried that the rum taste was going to be far too strong but after a day it had really mellowed out and the cake was AMAZING.  melt-in-your-month goodness!

Absolutely FANTASTIC.  I tried this on a whim since I needed to bring something to a "Caribbean" theme party.  It was gone before I could even have a piece myself.  I've made it quit a few times since and have never brought home leftovers.  I did as others suggested and simply tipped the cake out, put the glaze in the bottom of my pan and then put the cake back in to soak up all the glaze.  HOWEVER, one thing I would recommend is recoating your pan with butter before doing this.  I use a nice, non-stick bundt pan and it still sticks.  Definitely make this one day in advance since the flavors are ever so much better the next day.  I also have also made the glaze lighter by using half the required alcohol.

Well, the reviews were correct! This is an absolutely AWESOME recipe. Made two for a get together, one with Captain Morgan's Private Stock, the other with Sailor Jerry Spiced Navy Rum. Everyone went crazy over this cake! On day one, the Private Stock was definitely the best, the Sailor Jerry was really strong. On day two, the Sailor Jerry had mellowed, and the Private Stock had mellowed TOO much. so now I know what to make ahead, and what to use if I'm serving it that day. I have found it bakes up with the best texture and flavor if you use Jello pudding mix and Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe butter recipe cake mix. Thank you sooo much for sharing this recipe with the world!

I used Captain Morgan for both the cake and the glaze and it turned out perfectly. Rave reviews the three times I've made it so far!

I don't normally like rum cake but wanted to make one for my husband who does like it.  THIS WAS GREAT!  I even enjoyed it.  This will be a Christmas tradition from now on in my home.  I didn't have dark rum on hand, but did have the bacardi, and it was still GREAT!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was excellent.  I used Myers's Original Dark Rum.  It seemed like there was too much glaze and I didn't quite use it all, but next time I would definitely use all of it.  It would not have been too much.  Really delicious.

This was incredibly delicious.  I made it for my husband's birthday using pecans instead of walnuts and Captain Morgan.  I poked the top with a skewer to help absorb all of the glaze.  It was devoured!

Unbelievably moist! The texture and flavors combine wonderfully to produce a great-tasting cake. I used milk instead of water, as others suggested. I wish I would've thought of the half-used coconut milk I had in the fridge, that would have been fun to try. I added walnuts, which give it great flavor and a little extra oomph to this cake...I recommend adding them. --Based on others reviews and personal preference, I boiled the rum for the glaze. It would've been MUCH too potent without doing this, in my opinion. There is no lack of rum flavor in this cake... boiling the rum took some of the bite or edge off that would've made this cake hard to enjoy. Otherwise, FAB! Give it a shot!

Very yummy cake... But I would definitely make it and let it sit for approx 2 days (if you have the willpower) so the flavors can meld. Super easy as well to make. I have made the cake twice, once for my husband and then the other for my little sister's 21st birthday! I can't wait to make another one. This time I will use the nuts I didn't have the first time... Thanks so much for the post! Happy Baking!

I've had this in my Recipe Box for a long time and finally made it yesterday. This was incredible!!!  So moist, so delicious!  The only change that I'll make next time is to add more walnuts. I will definitely make this again!

sorry, but we didnt care for this.  if your not really a rum lover, you more than likely wont like this cake.  it has a lot of rum in it and the smell is powerful.  for the rum in the cake i used myers rum and for the glaze i used appleton (as suggested by lindsay w).  i let the glaze soak in for a few hours.  seems like the recipe made a lot of glaze - if i had liked it and wanted to make it again, i wouldnt add the entire amount of glaze.  but other than that the cake turned out very nice looking.

I have been making this exact recipe for 4 years and love it every time.  Each time I make it at least a week or more ahead of the planned party and have had wonderful results with freezing it and then defrosting the day or day before the party to serve to my guests. I wrap the cake in two to three tight layers of plastic wrap once it has had enough time to soak up all the glaze and cool completely.  Very flavorful and always moist!

Delicious! I made this after my husband bought a seriously overpriced Tortuga Rum cake on Amazon.  This is just as yummy.  I'm still not 100% sold on adding walnuts, but the coconut variations that others have mentioned sound worth a try.  Definitely let this one sit in the fridge for a day or so before digging in. It's worth the wait!

Awesome!  I used Appleton Rum from my honeymoon in Jamaica.  It definitely gave the cake a kick.  My coworkers wondered if it was legal to eat at work!

I had to try this recipe because I had never had rum cake before. It is a simple enough recipe and sounds delicious. I didn't care for it. I'm sure the recipe is wonderful but I had to rate it honestly. It wasn't enough to make me a believer.

Awesome! I used spiced rum and brown sugar instead. I took the cake out, then poured the glaze into the pan, put the cake back in to soak. I took this cake to a party and it was the only thing gone at the end of the night! It was easy to make and I'll make it again for sure!

OH MY GOD!!!! This is AMAZING.  I followed the suggestion of removing the cake from the pan, pouring 1/2 of the glaze in th pan, reinserting the cake and then pouring the rest of the glaze over the cake.  I let it soak in overnight. I also used Captain Morgan spiced rum. YUMMY!!!  I made this for a holiday potluck and every single person who ate it asked (more like begged) for the recipe. Try it - you won't be sorry! A permanent addition to my favorite recipes list!!!!

This is a excellent recipe.  I made it for my holiday boutique and got rave reviews.  I will definitely make this again.  I used Bacardi Dark Rum with both the cake and the glaze.  Just a side note, I found this recipe in my Mom's old recipe box that came from my Aunt.  I wish I had know about this recipe before, I would have been making long before now!

Thanks!

My cake is in the oven as we speak and I'm worried.  I got white cake mix instead of yellow......will report back weather or not this is a tragedy. *UPDATE* Cake came out fantastic!!  Co-workers loved it.  They were picking at the crumbs left on the empty plate!  I keep getting comments as to when I am making it again...which will be soon!!

This cake was delicious! Very moist.. I used Bacardi Rum (Gold) and it was perfect. My 15 year old daughter wanted this for her birthday cake which I thought was a strange request. The first day I made it was rather strong, but as the cake set it had the best flavor. I froze some of the cake and will update later how it was later...

This recipe is my first Rum Cake. I have quite few experience of Rum though.
I made this for my friend's birthday cake request. (Happy Birthday, Jay!) Since I had to bring this cake to my work, I boiled glaze after adding rum also.
When I brought this to cookout in other occasion, I did not boil rum. The flavor of rum was stronger this time.
The second time I made this, I made extra glaze. I boiled it down ticker and put it on the top of the cake. This added more sweetness and looked better.

I loved this.  I really really did.  Let me make a suggestion to take this from impressive to positively extraordinary.  Serve these with bananas foster (look the recipe up on this site) and vanilla ice cream.  It will take it from 5 stars to 1000.

Wow Wow WOW!!!!! This cake is so delicious....I can't believe it comes from a box! I followed other suggestions of subbing milk for water in the cake, and also sifting cake mix & pudding together. Great suggestions! I used Captain Morgan Tattoo (which is a spiced rum) and it was fabulous! I made this cake twice in one weekend (for girls night and for a neighborhood party) and what little was left over, I had for breakfast! :) The second cake I made, I ran out of rum for the glaze, so I just used rum flavoring and it was still tasty. I took the cake out of the pan and poured half the glaze in the bottom of the pan and then put the cake back in..poked holes in the cake with a wooden chopstick and poured the rest of the glaze on. Got lots of compliments on the cakes. Just make sure you bake the cake completely or it will be so moist that you'll have problems getting it out of the pan. I need to go buy more rum just so I can make this cake again!!

The actual 'cake' is amazing, and maybe I didn't read far enough into the reviews, but there should a fair warning that the glaze is not for everyone.  All the reviews I read raved about the glaze, and it's my own fault for putting it on the cake, but as much as I love rum I found the glaze unbearable and the cake was wasted because I couldn't stand the glaze and neither could my family.  I had actually had a small piece of the cake before I glazed it and it was outstanding.  So this is just to let others know that the glaze might not be for you, taste it before you put it on the cake :)

I think this is the Bacardi Cookbook recipe - I've been making it for more than 20 years, and love it.  I always use dark rum, unsalted butter, pecans instead of walnuts (don't like them much), and when the cake mix is beating, I let it go for at least 5 minutes.  Every holiday season I'm asked if I'm bringing this cake - everyone loves it.

This was so delish.  I made this for Father's Day and everyone devoured it.  Next time I will halve the rum b/c it was a bit too strong, but it still got rave reviews.  Also, I thought the glaze was a bit too runny.  So, next time, instead of brushing the glaze on, I might just put half of it in the bundt pan, reinsert the cake, and pour the rest of the glaze on the bottom.

I made this cake yesterday using Appleton Estates V/X Rum, and milk instead of water in the batter. This cake is an abosolute winner, and it's a snap to make. I poked several holes (used a chopstick)in the top and bottom of the cake as suggested by others. I then poured half the glaze into the cake pan,reinserted the cake, then poured the remaining glaze over the bottom and sides of the cake. I let it sit for 2 hours before removing it from the pan, and enjoying a piece.

I just want to say that this recipe was great. I didn't have any walnuts at home so  I substituted coconut and it came out awesome!

This is as good, if not better than other rum cakes I have had. I used 1/4 cup canola oil, 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce. I don't think it hurt the flavor any.  I used spiced rum in cake, and reg. Bacardi in glaze.  Love the spiced rum in cake, I think Bacardi's is to strong for glaze, but don't want to buy another bottle of rum just for cake glaze! I will surely make this again, though. Oh, be sure your glaze is warm when brushing/pouring onto cake.  I had some left about an hour later, put it on the cake, and there it sat, globbed on top of the cake, not soaking in like it should (my own silly mistake, I know).

I haven't taken this cake out of the oven yet but I had to come write a review anyway. I have been standing in the kitchen just inhaling for the last 45 minutes because I can't get over how amazing this smells! I used caramel cake mix and butterscotch pudding with Bacardi Select dark rum. My dad will be lucky if this lasts til his birthday tomorrow! Either way, I'll update this post to say how great it tastes. :)

I used Bacardi Select rum. It was ok, but I wish I would have used Appleton's for the glaze. Don't get me wrong, the cake is still out of this world. I took the advice of others and poked holes in the top and bottom of the cake, then poured half the glaze into the bottom of the bundt pan and poured the rest on top. The cake itself is moist and divine. I will definitely make again, just with different rum next time.

I love rum. I drink it often. I also love cake. I thought this would be a great mix. I was wrong. I could not not get over the "booze" taste. I guess i will just stick Morgan Cokes and Birthday cake.

Extremely simple to make.  I used Captain Morgans spiced rum, because it's my favorite rum.  Came out wonderful.  The glaze is so good i am only slightly embarrassed to admit i licked the spoon.  I poked a holes all over the cake with a skewer.  then poured half the glaze into the bunt pan and then put the cake back into the pan, then poked holes in the bottom and side and poured the rest of the glaze on top.  I let it sit for about 5 minutes then inverted into my cake stand.  It did drip a but but looked great.  I also put CHOCOLATE CHIPS in the cake and drizzled melted dark chocolate on top in thin stripes once the glaze dried.  It just gives it another level of flavor.

note to self:  use only three eggs if cake mix has pudding included.  bake 45-50 minutes only so "crust" won't be too crisp.  use less rum in glaze if only for home, but add more if for outside... or just know who you're making it forr.

Good & easy to make.We found it a bit too "rummy" for our taste. I might use a bit less next time.

I absolutely love this cake. I've used it many times and everyone always asks for the recipe. It's in fact the closest rum cake to the one I brought back from the Caribbean. My favorite combination is the Devil's food chocolate cake mix and the chocolate fudge pudding mix.  Poking the holes with a barbeque skewer really helps the rum run through the cake. Every so often, I also turn the cake pan sideways to evenly distribute the rum. I've even made mini rum cakes by using a muffin pan instead of the bundt cake pan. Thanks again for this wonderful recipe.

this was a very soft and moist cake. 
i only had light rum on hand, so i added a dash of allspice and 2 tsp of vanilla to the batter, following the advice of another reviewer. i also omitted the nuts and one egg yolk.
next time, i'll add more rum to the cake to give it a stronger flavor.
for those looking to halve the recipe, baking for 40 min should be enough.

This beats any rum cake I've had in the past.  I made two cakes, one with Captin Morgan's in the cake and Bicardi Gold in the glaze and the other with Gold in the cake and Appleton in the glaze.  Both were great...couldn't go wrong with either.

This is the ONLY cake my husband will eat. We all love it! For those that plan to eat it right when it is done, the rum flavor will be a bit strong so use less in the glaze. It is best to make this recipe as is and wait to eat it the next day when there isn't a strong aftertaste. Thanks for sharing!

this was the moistest cake I have ever had. Everyone loved it. The only thing I did different was accidently added the rum to the glaze ingredients. I put 1/2 into the cake pan, put the cake back in and poured the rest over the cake and let it sit. OMG! so good. Thanks for sharing.

AKA the "Uh-uh Cake". A crowd pleaser and sure-fire aphrodisiac. 

Followed the recipe with only a couple of alterations. Used milk instead of water for the cake -- for a creamier taste/texture. Also, cut in some Starbucks Liqueur for the glaze.

This wasn't quite as good as I had hoped from all the reviews but with a little tweaking I am sure it will be great. I think next time I will make a cake from scratch instead of using cake mix as I  thought there was a strange aftertaste also even before the glaze was used. In my experience this always seems to occur when pudding mix is used. The glaze however was delicious (I thought not enough rum flavour, hubby thought too much...we'll compromise!) and once I get a better cake base I think this will easily earn 5 stars.

I have made this several times now. Everyone loves it. THe only change I make is in the glaze. I cut the recipe in half. You can still taste the extra rum and it gives the cake a nice sheen. What this does is change the texture of the cake. YOu get a nice moist cake that isn't soaked. I don't like mushy cakes so this works for me.

I pricked the top & sides of the cake with a toothpick before reinserting it into the pan.  I pricked the bottom with a skewer.  The glaze was absorbed within an hour.  Very moist & easy. This went over well at a family luau party.  Sent the recipe home with a guest.  The rum flavor is strong.

I took this to a family get-together.  Everyone loved it but suggested maybe cut back on the rum alittle.  You could smell the rum when you walked past the cake.  Next time, I will use 1/2 cup of rum total in place of the 1 cup total.  It was very good but a little too rummy.

I really loved this recipe, I found just making this cake to be theraputic, the smells and all. I recently bought a bunt cake pan and this was the first cake mix I did with it. So far so good. I would highly recommend this recipe.

I made this for a Mother's Day brunch and got rave reviews!  I used a white cake mix (no yellow on hand) and for the glaze, I used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar.  I did as other reviewers suggested and after letting the cake cool for a few minutes outside the pan, I put it back in the bundt pan, poked holes in the bottom and then poured the glaze over the bottom of the cake.  I will now do this with all bundt cakes that have a glaze!  On a whim, I soaked several handfuls of fresh raspberries in rum for about 10 minutes and then placed them around the edges of the cake, once inverted.  Not only was it a pretty garnish, the berries were quite complimentary to the cake.

I halved the rum (used Bacardi dark) in the glaze and the cake, and it was perfect.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts and made it the night before.  It was yummy the next day for our New Year's lunch.

This cake is fabulous.  I only left out the walnuts, and made the rest of the recipe exactly as written.  We used Appleton dark rum.  My husband said it's the cake he wants for his next birthday.  I'll definately make this recipe again.

This cake is awesome.  I actually only had butter cake mix, and it worked just as well.  Simply Delicious!  Everyone wanted to take the cake home.

Update 12/17/15 - I used the yellow cake mix and still got great reviews on the cake.  I toned down the rum in the glaze, but not in the cake.  Still the best!

I made this cake for the fun of it.  I held back a bit on the nuts and wish I hadn't.  I took half to my parents house and 2-3 days later they are still talking about how good it was.  Very good, EASY recipe.  Thank you.

I should have followed Jackie's suggestion about putting on the glaze. I had trouble getting mine to soak in when I brushed it on. It is still a very tasty cake and easy to put together, and I'm sure it would have been better had the glaze saturated it more.

I love this cake.  My family loves this cake.  It is such a huge hit!!  I've only changed it slightly.  I use coconut pudding mix, sprinkle some coconut throughout the cake mix, and half way thru glazing I layer some coconut on top (no walnuts).  I've actually had people tell me it is so good I should sell it.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I can't believe I've taken this long to rate this recipe, oversight I guess. But, this cake is wonderful! I've taken it to work for the past 3 yrs for our annual holiday luncheon. My co-workers love it!

This recipe is soooo EASY and the taste is out of this world!!!  It's great warmed up and served with vanilla ice cream and tastes just as good alone with a cup of coffee or big glass of milk.  My husband loved this recipe and couldnt keep out of the cake.  I poured half the glaze back into the bundt pan and then reinserted the cake and poured the rest on, as suggested, it worked great.  The cake looks and tastes great and is easy to make, can't ask for more then that!!!  Thanks!

I made this for my boyfriend's 23rd birthday and we both absolutely loved it. I only used half the glaze because I didn't want the taste to be too strong. It still tasted fantastic.

I disagree with most of the reviews on this one.  I thought this cake was so-so.  I made it for a family gathering, the rum flavor was VERY strong and I had a hard time with the glaze.  I wouldn't make this one again.

This cake was wonderful! I used pecans instead of walnuts this time. I think either nut would be great. My dad said that this is one of the best cakes he has ever had! Thanks!

This was the best rum cake ever.  I eliminated the walnuts so everyone can enjoy...just in case someone was allergic.  The technique on glazing the cake was terrific.  It was moist and super delicious.

A nice cake. I used Kamora, as I didn't have any rum. I also omitted the glaze & just drizzled about 1/2c Kamora over the cooled cake & let it soak in. It's a nice base cake & I think one could have fun experimenting with different liquors & cake flavor combinations.

Oh my gosh!!  This is AWESOME!!!  I have searched for so long to find a moist and flavorful rum cake like this one!  I made this for company tonight and my family couldn't keep their hands off.  The four of us ate half of it!!  Including my 4-year-old and 13-year-old!  I figured it would be too strong for the younger one but she loved it.  I used Butter Recipe cake mix and French Vanilla pudding since that's what I had on hand.  I also tried the suggested glazing method by dumping half the glaze in the bundt pan and re-inserting the cake.  It worked well for me (though I did have a nervous moment where I was afraid the cake was going to break apart.  But it did great!)  Try this one if you enjoy rum cake!!  It's a sure winner!!

This was a great recipe!  I used a butter-recipe cake mix, used egg whites instead of whole eggs, and also used coconut rum since it was all we had.  It was delicious!  Over half of it was gone within the day, and it only got better over the next few days.  Definitely worth it and very, very easy to make!  The tip on glazing worked great, though I helped it out by poking holes in the top and sides of my cake with a knife.

This recipe is EXCELLENT!  After reading some complaints that the cake was too strong, I reduced the rum for the glaze to 1/3 cup.  This is an easy recipe, and I'm very pleased with the result.  The flavor and texture are amazing.  I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent!  I made this cake last night and let it sit in the bundt pan to soak in the glaze overnight.  Easiest cake I ever made and came out perfect. Goes great with a strong cup of coffee.  Thanks for sharing!!!

My mom has made this recipe for years and it is delicious!  However, we use a chocolate devil's food cake mix and chocolate pudding.  If you love chocolate - this is incredible.  Just pour the glaze down the sides of the bundt pan when it first comes out of the oven.  Sprinkle powdered sugar on top for presentation.

The first time I made this, I didn't have a bundt pan, so I used two 9" pans.  Although it turned out just 'OK', I refused to rate this until I made it right.  I bought the bundt pan and did it exactly to recipe, and it just came out AWESOME!  I will make this again and again.  Thank you!

This cake is AWESOME!!! I took it to my Mom's 85th Birthday, and she loved it so much that she kept it to herself! It is rich and oooohh so delish!!! Rather than measuring out the 5 Tbls. of Rum, I add 1/3 cup, that is just a little extra. Try it, you'll love it!!

What a cake!!  I can't believe all the negative reviews as I followed the directions to the letter and could not have asked for a better result.  The cake was moist but certainly not soggy.  The rum glaze was easy to make and delicious.  Thanks so much for the tip about pouring the glaze into the pan and reinserting the cake, how easy is that?  Everyone loved this cake and most had seconds.  I will be making it again.

Very good... this cake also keeps well, without drying out.  I loved the suggestion to glaze it by pouring half the glaze in the bundt pan, and re-inserting the freshly baked cake... yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!!!

I asked my co worker whant kind of cake she wanted for her birthday. Her reply was a Rum Cake. I have found several excellent recipes her at allrecipes. com. This Golden Rum cake was one of the best that I found. The suggestion to glaze the cake in the pan really worked out good. I  will be making this cake for many holidays to come. Thank You Jackie

I have made this recipe many times over the past year.  I usually make it with Chocolate or Devil's Food cake mix and chocolate pudding.  Where ever I take the rum cake someone always says "Wow! You made this!" or "Oh, I thought this came from the bakery"  Thanks for the AWESOME recipe!

This is an awesome recipe. The cake melts in your mouth. I brought it to a party and barely even got a piece. The host told me that she hid a piece so she could have it the next day. I've been asked to bring it to a dessert wedding reception.

This is the best cake I've ever had. I first tried it about 15 years ago and then when I stumbled upon this recipe, I got my boyfriend to make it for me for my birthday and now he's hooked on it as well. He's made it many times over the past few months when we've had company over and impressed both his family and mine. There hasn't been anyone yet that hasn't liked it.

This recipe is so easy.  I made nine cakes over the holidays.  Everyone loves it and it stays moist for days.  The easiest way to apply the rum glaze is to pour half the mixture into the cleaned bundt pan and reinsert the cake.  Pour the remaining glaze over the bottom of the cake.

I tried this recipe with coconut rum for a different twist.  Instead of using nuts, I toasted coconut flakes and garnished around the cake.  This is the easiest and best-tasting rum cake I've ever made!

This is a delicious cake, and very easy!  I made it for a Hawaiian luau-themed party and it was a huge hit! (And the suggestion to pour the glaze into the bundt pan was very helpful, too.)

This cake was delicious and easy to make except I mistakenly used granulated sugar instead of confection sugar.  The recipe called for white sugar not powder sugar.

It makes me laugh at how many people cut up the recipe based on they can taste the cake mix. If you don't like that sort of thing then don't make this recipe. I love this recipe and have been making it for a few years now. I always add a cup of vanilla yogurt or sour cream to the mix, it makes the cake super moist.

I have made it with several rums and my all time favorite rum is Appleton's, hands down it makes it sooooooo much better. I made it with Amaretto as a gift and my friend said it was amazing! 

I made it last year for our church, omitted the rum and added coconut extract, and used brown sugar in he glaze, sprinkled coconut flakes over the top. it was still amazing.

I have never put nuts on top but always use cinnamon sugar in the batter.

Can't wait to try Irish cream!

Very good recipe, I do recommend a few teaspoons of butter rum and vanilla in the cake and syrup. I also doubled the rum and cut out the water for more rum flavor (from the cake and glaze, water makes the glaze way to runny, they need to remove that from the glaze ingredients). I also recommend a dark spiced rum like kraken or Gosling's. Make plenty of glaze, toward the end of the bake I remove it, poke holes in the bottom with a knife and pour the glaze in, let it finish cooking, then repeat on the top after its cooled and out of the pan. I've made tons of rum cakes but this is my go to, with my own personal modifications of course lol Its my boyfriend's favorite, its actually his birthday cake every year and the left overs are brought to Christmas, were everyone fights over it lol

Read through other reviews and here is what I did... exchanged the water in the cake for almond/coconut milk, used 1/2 C coconut and 1/2 C Chopped Pecans instead of 1C Walnuts,  I buttered and used cinnamon sugar to coat the pan, and switched out butter for oil in the cake batter. I left the cake in the pan and poked holes with a chopstick for glazing. Turned out on to cake holder after an hour and brushed the top with the last bit of glaze. I used Goslings rum because that is the dark rum currently on hand. Haven’t cut it yet but it looks great so I am assuming it tastes as good as it appears. I LOVE rum so I can hardly wait.

This turned out fantastic! My husband almost never reacts much to food... one meal is about like another in his estimation...  but when he bit into this, his eyes popped and he announced that he wouldn't be sharing it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Its simple and turnout well. I use  Betty Crocker Super Moist French Vanilla Cake mix which already had pudding in it. For the glaze I use Myers which has nice aroma and shining. The best is to wait few hours before cutting the cake, but it was lovey to have it while warm too :)

This cake is always a great success. I make it often for my sis in law. This time however I used butterscotch pudding instead of vanilla and I think it’s just as good. I use oakheart spiced rum for the cake and the butter toffee rum glaze. I will never search for another recipe because it’s just so good. I also use shaved almonds instead of walnuts.

Looked beautiful but I didn't enjoy the flavor. I used a natural Pillsbury cake mix, I should have made my own cake batter. The pudding mix (jello- the most natural one they had) gave it a weird texture. It wasn't what I was expecting.

OMG....this was ABSOLUTELY delicious!!!! I agree with another reviewer, shift the cake mix and pudding mix to remove the lumps...I will definitely do that next time.  This is truly a must keep recipe.  My nephew took half the cake home...LOL.  Thanks for the great recipe...and it is so easy to make!

I made a whole bunch of these for Christmas appreciation gifts. They came out great but I do have a suggestions. Replace water with whole milk. Also, instead of brushing the glaze on the cake, pour about 1/2 or 3/4 of the glaze back into the pan you baked it in (wipe it out first) and then pour the reminder over the bottom of the cake. Let it soak in for at least 30 minutes. All of it will absorb into the cake instead of just running down the sides. I used a skewer to poke some holes in the cake first to ensure the glaze actually went into the cake. These also mellow with age, the rum can be a bit strong on day one and two. I think it's best 3 to 4 days after baking, maybe even longer.

This is a family favourite recipe with the few changes I made.  I substituted yellow cake mix with Butter Pecan Cake mix and I used Butterscotch instant pudding instead of vanilla.  This gives the cake a very rich flavour.  I leave the cake in the pan after its finished cooking and poke holes in the bottom.  Then simply pour sugar glaze over the cake while still in the pan.  I let it sit over night and its perfect.

This cake is awesome and easy to make.  I made the cake with the following changes. Milk instead of water and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I baked the cake for 50 mins. I did used dark rum ( Old Sam) which is what was recommended in the recipie .... not much use making a rum cake if you can't taste the rum! As others recommended I left the cake in the pan to cool for roughly 10 mins and poked it full of holes using a skewer.  I then spooned the rum sauce over the cake and left it to absorb for about 20 mins.  A point worth mentioning is you shouldn't boil the sauce once you have added the rum because this causes the alcohol to evaporate and that would definitely affect the flavour.

I made this exactly as the recipe states only replaced rum with rumchata (it was all I had) it was FABULOUS!!! I used the tip from one of the reviewers to remove the cake and place half of the icing on the pan and then return the cake to the pan. Brilliant! This will be a new favorite for me. Loved it so much I am making it again to take to a party tomorrow. Thanks for posting!!

This cake did not have as much rum flavor in it as I had anticipated.  Rum was just right.  I do think that depending on the cake mix you use it might need to be a little sweeter.  Next time I will use brown sugar in the glaze so I get a more caramel flavor and save some glaze to put over the top to make it nice and shiny after inverting onto serving platter.  Also will probably try dusting the cake pan with cinnamon sugar instead of flour.

This is a wonderful recipe and just as good as the tortuga rum cakes. Spiced rum and coconut rum make great variations. Only issue is it is almost impossible to find 18.25 oz cake mixes anymore. I found a great cake mix substitute recipe and it is even better since it lacks that box cake taste. http://www.food.com/recipe/homemade-yellow-cake-mix-subtitute-18-25oz-betty-crocker-box-472383

I made this cake exactly like the recipe, but added pineapple 
& coconut I put in a food processor & added to the mix.
It was wonderful! Great for a tropical or summer themed party.

Definitely follow the suggestion to put 1/2 the glaze in the pan, reinsert the cake and pour the rest over. Turns out great!

I found the rum flavor to be overwhelming in this cake with an unpleasant aftertaste. I suppose less rum could be used, but it already tastes like nothing more than the boxed cake mix that it is.  Personally I like yellow cake mixes, so I thought I would like this.  But it didn't quite work for me.  My husband liked it better than I did, but not enough for me to make it again.

This recipe is DA BOMB!  It is Bacardi's recipe and I have been making this for over 35 years!  I have made, literally hundreds of them and I can tell you, from experience, there is NO REASON to change this recipe!  It is simply fool proof and your friends are gonna love this!

I mix all the cake ingredients together but add just a touch more rum to it, then on the glaze, when I add the rum last, I always add a little more to that too. Then, of course like all cooks learn to do, is taste to see if it's good enough. I keep adding more rum to the glaze until just enough that it doesn't taste like an overkill. Then, what I use is an turkey injector and inject the rum glaze in the cake on the bottom first, then flip it up right, and inject the sides and the inside. Let me tell you, I get so many requests for this, I end up making 9 cakes a year for Christmas. OH, the rest of the glaze, I use a silicone brush and brush onto the rest of the cake real good. It's so so good.

I have been making this cake for years.  Suggestion:  After you've made the glaze and while the cake is still in the pan, poke holes in the bottom of the cake (I use a shish kabob skewer).  Then use a spoon to drizzle the glaze over the cake and down the sides.  Then turn the cake out onto a plate.  DELICIOUS.

We just got home from our honeymoon in Jamaica and I was dying to use the rum we brought back to make a rum cake.  This was so moist and delicious!!  I used Appleton Special rum.  After removing the cake, I put half of the glaze into the bottom for the pan and inverted the cake back into the pan. I poked holes into the bottom of the cake and then poured the remaining glaze into the cake letting it sit and absorb all the liquid before turning it back over on my cake platter.

It was a hit. A minor change by a reviewer's suggestion; milk, instead of water. I left out nuts because I didn't have them.

This came out delicious my family raved about this Christmas dessert and we are not drinking people, but the rum brought out all the flavors so well in the cake.  The only thing I did a little differently is rather than take the cake out of the bunt pan to glaze it I left it in poured the butter rum sauce in and allowed it to soak. My toughest critics loved it !!!

Wonderful!  First time I made this I followed the directions exactly.  It was too much rum flavor.  This time I added the rum to the glaze during the last 2 minutes of cooking.  This helped to burn off the alcohol flavor, but still left plenty of rum flavor.

This was a big hit at my house today. First time making a rum cake. Only two changes that I made. I used all white Calico Jack Coconut Rum. Feel comfortable using the full cup as it is a delicate rum. I also put HALF of the chopped pecans on the bottom & I mixed the other HALF into the batter. We loved it. Thanks for great recipe.

My go-to recipe, a crowd pleaser.  Only change is that we add the rum after removing the glaze from the heat since most of our friends love the extra 'kick'  Shh, don't tell them my secret ;)

I can't believe that I've NEVER rated this recipe, SCRUMPTIOUS.  I do substitute PECANS for the walnuts (I'm from South Carolina and pecans reign!).   Once the cake is baked I remove the it from the bundt pan (while warm however cool enough to handle), add the glaze into the bundt pan,  and seat the cake back into the bundt pan placed on a wire rack to cool.  Great recipe which I used many times with rave reviews from all!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. He loves run and coconut and he's not an eater of traditional birthday cake so thought he'd love it. Definitely will make this again. I didn't have the pudding mix so added some coconut oil, about 1/2 cup. I also used half dark and half white rums and some fresh coconut flakes. I didn't have a traditional bundt pan so made due as I could. Didn't matter, the cake was amazing. So moist and the glaze makes it so decadent. Amazingly yummy!

Great base to use as base for piña colada cake minus the walnuts. Poke holes throughout when cooled. Poor sweetened and cream of coconut to soak cake. Cover with large can drained crushed pineapple then cool whip and sprinkle with toasted coconut.

I really enjoyed this cake, but only one guest said it was a little too strong - I did not think it was strong, I could barely taste the rum.  I followed other users reviews and put half of the walnuts in the cake mix, the other half on top.  I was also worried about the strong taste, so I used 1/2 dark rum 1/2 coconut rum in both the cake mix and on top. I think next time I'll use all dark in the cake (since it cooks out) and all lighter rum on top.  I would make this again.

**I made this a second time using dark rum in the cake and light coconut rum on the cake, and added coconut inside the cake.  It was okay.  My husband still said it was way to strong on the rum flavor, but I enjoyed it.

This recipe is bomb! Its super easy, after a few times making it you don't even need to read directions anymore. I'm not a fan of rum cake, in fact never tried it until I found this recipe to make one for a friend for holidays. Super yummy and its gorgeous when placed on a cherry red charger plate. Many many many thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a lovely, rich, and impressive cake to make!! I was a bit sceptical about using a cake mix as an ingredient, but it seems to be in the recipe for a reason and I will definitely make this again. I like that you can use different rums and am looking forward to trying out some variations, but I used Goslings black rum from Bermuda for both the cake and the glaze this time. I followed some suggestions from other reviews and poked holes in the cake right before glazing it. I also only used half the walnuts which was fine. The walnuts really add a nice flavour and texture that compliments the booziness of the cake!

I love this recipe and have made it for several years. I use a mini fluted pan (courtesy Pampered Chef) and cook for about 35 min. When it's done, I give it as gifts to my staff. Since it's at work I use rum emulsion instead of the real stuff for the glaze (still real rum in the cake). It's always a hit!

this is a wonderful recipe.  I've made it many times always using spiced rum.  some people don't care for the nuts so I spread only 1/2 of pan with nuts so everyone is happy.  I've also made it using chocolate cake mix and chocolate pudding.  it's delish either way. the last one I made it for thanksgiving I was told it was a little strong.  next time I will try with a little less rum.  thank you for sharing your recipe.

Great recipe. I took the advice and removed the  cake from the pan and poured half the glaze in the bottom of the pan. I poked holes all over the cake then carefully put the cake back in the pan. I poured the remaining glaze over the cake. I let it cool in the pan before flipping it out onto the cake plate. Great idea! I will definitely make it again.

This is a good recipe but I have found that when it comes time to add the glaze I generally use more rum, using both white and dark rum, and a little less sugar.  I have sometimes doubled the recipe for the glaze, pouring one part into the bottom as directed and then a second over the top after I flip the pan.

My whole family loves this recipe; we've been having it for years at Christmas but it has become the favourite for birthdays as well.  I cook all of the rum in the glaze to burn off the alcohol so that my 6 and 9 year old can have it, they love it!  I pour most of the glaze into the bundt pan and replace the cake and the pour some glaze over the bottom...all of the glaze soaks in this way.

The cake was good, but I was not a fan of the glaze (it was almost bitter). The rum cake aficionados in my family said it was great, though! Very moist and with the perfect amount of walnuts.

I used Captain Morgan Spiced Rum in the batter and Appleton Estate's Special in the glaze.  We thought the rum was overpowering, would use less in the glaze next time.

This cake is phenomenal.  Moist, rummy, delicious.  I only use Captain Morgan Spiced Rum. Also try subbing limoncello for the rum and lemon juice for the water in the cake, and limoncello for the rum in the glaze, using lemon cake mix and pudding....outta sight!!  In the rum version, I add a sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter and to the lemon version I add zest of one lemon. Everyone loves this easy to make cake that looks like you fussed.

I love this.  Putting the cake back in the pan with the rum sauce really is brilliant.  That said some of my family find the sauce overpowering...just a caution if you will serving this to anyone who might not appreciate the flavor.
I have made this twice...the 2nd time I used butterscotch pudding and mixed in a cup of butterscotch chips.  It was good but honestly the cake is already great as is.  So while it was fun to experiment. I will probably stick with the recipe as written from now on.

Loved it! I used Whalers Vanilla Rum and tried it with a Devils Chocolate cake mix and instant chocolate pudding mix. Very Good! It is quite boozy so cut back on the rum in the glaze if you don't want it too boozy but we like it just the way it is. (or add it earlier and cook some of it out). Make sure you use a good quality rum. Don't substitute the butter in the glaze- its a butter rum glaze for a reason. Make the glaze while the cake bakes - then cool the glaze a bit before adding the rum to it so it doesn't evaporate the alcohol. The authors tip about pouring the glaze into the Bundt pan then reinserting the cake works awesome. This would also be fantastic with a dollop of fresh whipped cream. Tastes even better the next day - not AS boozy after it sits for a day.

Bundt is the best, but I have also made this in a 9X13 and as cupcakes. The cupcakes were messy, and I probably won't do that again. This is sooooo good the next day and the day after that. A true crowd pleaser every time. I use Matasalem Rum which is so smooth and what makes my cake better than yours! No offense.

This cake is one of the best. It is so moist and flavorful, the longer it stays, the better it is.

This was delicious, but I'm pretty sure every slice had at least a shot of rum in it. The liquor didn't really burn off, which made for a strong rum flavor and a higher alcohol content than expected.

I love this recipe...I have been using it for years for special occasions. A couple of suggestions. Light rum works just as well as dark. AND to make glazing the cake EASY -- as soon as it comes out of the oven, pour the glaze over it while it is still in the bundt pan. Let it cool for one hour, then invert onto plate. The cake will soak in the glaze while it cools, and you don't have to try pouring it on after you take it out of pan. Works very well.

This is a keeper!  It wasn't too wet and not too much rum.  It was a perfect recipe.  I did leave off the nuts because of fickle eaters.

Amazing! Most of the time I forget to put the walnuts in because I'm so excited to make it! Everyone asks me for the recipe but, I have yet to share it. I'd rather them go on thinking I worked so hard to make this cake! I use any kind of rum for the cake part and a more expensive rum for the glaze. It does make a difference for the flavor.

Great recipe! I used 1/4 of a cup of rum for the glaze and it was still too much. I would recommend making it a day ahead so the rum can soak through the cake before serving.

My grandmother requested something "rummy" for Christmas Eve so I made this cake.  It was a HUGE hit, literally had family members fighting over it.  I used Bacardi Oakheart rum, was very good.  I heard once don't cook with alcohol you aren't you won't drink.  Will definitely make again.

OMG! I doubled the rum sauce & poked holes in the top of the cake with a fork before applying the sauce. Also let it sit for a few hours after I drenched it in sweet rum butteryness. It was perfect!

I ran out of white sugar, so I used brown sugar instead and I can't imagine it could've been any better! The brown sugar formed a prailine/caramel type glaze that was amazing! I think I will make more glaze next time because as long as you're saturating it with butter and sugar, you might as well go all the way!

Love this recipe.  Easy and yummy.  I've made 3 already for the holidays.  The secret is using a good rum.  Don't buy the cheap stuff.  You'll be disappointed.  I use pecans instead of walnuts

The cake was very good although the rum syrup has too strong a rum taste for me. I didn't have the lighter rum so I used the same dark rum that I used for the cake. Next time I'll try with a lighter rum and probably less syrup. I didn't use any nuts either and didn't really miss them.

Couldn't tell it came from a box!  I also used Bacardi Gold because I couldn't afford the $$ to get the Myer's Dark Rum this time, but next time I will!

Loved it! I made it around Christmas time for a family get together. Initially, I thought it was way too strong (I like to eat cake as soon as it comes out of the oven- when still warm). However, after letting it sit for a day, it turned out, that it was not too strong at all. I just needed to give the alcohol time to set. After the cake sits, the flavor of the rum (I used Costa Rican rum) remains, but the sharpness of the alcohol disappears. Will definitely make this again! It was moist and wonderful and everyone loved it! Just remember to make at least a day before you want to serve it!

Amazing cake!  Very moist and yummy with a rum kick.  I used only half the amount of glaze in the recipe, and I thought that was plenty.  My husband, who usually only likes chocolate desserts kept sneaking into the kitchen to get another serving:)

Perfect!  We omitted the walnuts, used French Vanilla pudding, and a 9x13 pan since my Bundt pan is mysteriously missing.  So, so, sooooooo good!!!

I have made this recipe for years, its. a favorite with my family. The one thing I use for the top of the cake to put the glaze on is a meat injector, it really works great.  Also inject the bottom of the cake after cooled for 10-15 minutes before turning it onto a plate.

I stuck to the recipe, and used Captain Morgan for the cake and plain Bacardi for the glaze.  It came out great, and everyone loved it!

Delicious cake, which I modified as follows: 7 egg whites (instead of 4 whole eggs, to lower fat), light rum (did not have dark), 1/4 cup chopped pecans (not a lot of nut fans in the house).  As one reviewer noted, this cake (unrefrigerated) tastes just a good 2-3 days later.  Everyone loved it!

Cake turned out moist and looked really pretty. However, the flavor of the rum was too strong. I couldn't even eat the first cake I made. I'm not very familiar to rum so I just went off of reviews. I used a dark rum. The second cake only had two cap fulls of rum in the glaze and it was perfect!

The Rum Cake came out perfectly and was a hit! Instead of a regular bunt pan I used a Fleur De Lis mold and I opted to use pecans instead of walnuts.  Also, I recommend brushing on the glaze rather than pouring the mixture over the cake while its still in the pan(which some recipes urge).  It made the cake taste more even and less mushy.

I have used this same recipe for about 10 years. The only thing I do differently is that I use the darkest chocolate cake you can buy. Makes such a difference. My son is stationed in Japan and emailed me wanting me to make one and send it to him. Always a winner at my house!

This cake is fantastic.  I am a fan of coconut rum.  If you substitute coconut rum, it adds a layer of tropical sweetness that is delicious.  I only had sugar free instant pudding and it worked fine.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts because I live in Texas and we always have pecans, again delicious!!

Yum.  Rave reviews from the boyfriend.  It has a strong rum flavor, but that's how he likes it.  Otherwise, cut back on the rum in the glaze a little bit.

This is the easiest and best cake ever! I've never had one complaint yet. Perfect! I do change it up sometimes and do a coconut version with coconut cake mix, pudding mix and coconut rum, coconut flakes as decoration but the base recipe remains the same. Pretty much error proof!

I just made this for my sister-in-law's birthday (she's a rum lover  ;)  We thought it was great, and pretty easy - would definitely make again!  (But have to remember to try the trick noted to soak up more of the glaze - too much of mine went to waste...)

Everyone raved about this cake.  Everyone loved it, it is really really delicious.  Next time I will chop the nuts a little more.  It seemed like a lot of glaze going on the cake, but it was perfect.  People said it tasted like rum cakes that you buy in the Caribbean.  Will make this many more times.

Delicious, but next time I would leave the cake in the Bundt pan while pouring the alcohol glaze over it, to allow it to soak in more thoroughly.  I would definitely make this cake again!

Add a quick icing of rum and powdered sugar, and it's even that much better!  Quite a hit, even with my tea-totaler friends.

This cake was AMAZING.  It's not a typical box cake.  The lady at the liquor store informed me that the darker the rum, the sweeter it is because it contains more molasses.  So definitely go for a dark rum.  I boiled the glaze with the rum in it because I'm not a fan of the alcohol taste.  It was very strong rum flavour as it was and probably would've been very overpowering if I didn't do this.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts.  I wish I would've tried the method of pouring half the glaze in the pan and putting the cake back in to absorb the glaze because doing it the regular way was very tedious and messy.  I would definitely make this again, people were raving over it!

It was a rum overload for me. OMG..was I supposed to use rum flavoring? I used meyers rum and I was toasted after one small slice.  Overall the cake was good, just too much rum and I followed the directions.

Great recipe.  Be careful, not all brands of instant pudding come in 3.4 ounce packages.  You want to use the four serving size (the small box).  Thanks Jackie.

People at work and home loved it! Instead of 1/2 cup and another 1/2 cup RUM for syrup, I put 1/4 cup for cake, and 1/4 cup for the syrup... turned out great! Not too bitter, and you can still taste the rum flavor. Will make one for my cousin's farewell party. Thank you for sharing!

Made this for a friend who was having a get-together and wanted to serve a rum cake. He gave it rave reviews and told me it was a huge hit with his wife and all their guests. I'm not a "box cake" baker and having never made a rum cake in my life I was nervous about how this recipe would turn out but I should not have been.  Though I did not taste it myself, I'm confident this is a good recipe as it got absolute rave reviews!

I made this recipie with a french vanilla cake mix instead of a yellow cake mix and i used spiced rum instead of regular rum... i made it for my small group girls and since i didnt want to be overwhelmed before the party i made it the day before and covered it with tin foil... it was still moist even the next day... i was shocked!!! imagine what it would be like having it the same day... or even still warm... YUM!!!

I made 2 of these to take to 2 different parties. No one loved them. all said TOO much Rum in the glaze. SUPER moist! will make again with different glaze. Poking holes in the cake and putting it back in the pan to soak up glaze works well. I will use pineapple glaze next time.

I followed a suggestion in another review and used the Appletons Rum for the glaze since it is a bit sweeter.  It turned out absolutely delicious!  I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

Excellent!  Easy to make this moist yummy rummy cake.  I was a little skeptical about pouring 1/2 the glaze in the pan and reinserting the cooled cake but it worked great!  No need to poke holes or pour slowly.  Made it for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  This one goes in my recipe box!

I just made this cake today and it is EXCELLENT! The cake was so flavorful, moist, and delicious. Everyone wanted to take some home and my mother wants me to make one for her Christmas party at her job next month. Just a note you dont have to use all of the butter rum glaze I would have the butter rum glaze recipe.

I made this recently for my grandson's birthday party and no, I didn't serve this to the kids.  It was a big hit too!  I have to share my spin on it though.  I poked holes like people suggested, used white rum for the cake and I used coconut rum for the glaze.  It turned out yummy yummy.  Easy peasey too.

I served this at our end of year BBQ, and for my dad's 75th birthday, and it was a great hit.My guests and family loved it. I didn't brush all the glaze on, as I was afraid it may be too much, so used a little more than half and added some confectioner's suger to make a white glaze and drizzled it over the top and sides. This will be a keeper in my house. I was actually asked to make another one this week. Thank you for a great recipe.

Deeee-licious. I made this for a party and everyone loved it. Many people had seconds. The only change I made was to include only a splash of rum in the glaze. I used appleton rum in both the batter and the glaze. I made the cake two days before the party and stored it in the fridge in a cake tupperware. I already put this recipe in my recipe book.

Amazing, unbelievably great tasting cake! I used pecans, fat free milk instead of water in the glaze, Bicardi rum in the batter and Whalers Vanilla Rum in the glaze...this cake won't last over two days..  Do I have to share it with my family?

Excellent!  I did not have instant pudding, but had sugar free cook and serve, so I used that.  Rum is strong, but I know it will be better tomorrow if I can leave it alone that long!

I followed the recipe for the most part, except I left out the nuts and boiled the rum with the glaze (didn't want it to be too strong since it was going to be eaten hours after baking).  It was plenty rummy... but much better (less alcohol-y) when I had it for breakfast today. Can't wait to make it again with some of the variations posted by other reviewers!  For the rum, I used Sailor Jerry Spiced Navy Rum.

I've made this cake several times and everytime I get rave reviews. I've tried lemon flavored rum with yellow cake, rasberry rum w/chocolate cake. It's always a hit. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this cake for a Thanksgiving luncheon at a senior citizens function and they insisted that I make it again for Christmas. Their biggest complaint was there wasn't enough rum!

This cake is rumtastic. Probably the first time I've preferred a cake the second day.  I used about half the amount of glaze and thought it was sufficient.  Make sure you let the glaze soak in. The first day all I tasted was rum, but the 2nd day you got the blend of rum with butter and other yummy cake flavors.

OMG, FABULOUS is all I can say!  This was SO good.  I omitted the nuts (personal preference) and used Appleton Estates dark rum.  Definitely full of rum flavor (which I love)!  It was quite strong the first day but mellowed after that.  This cake was so moist!  I used the submitter's advice about pouring half the glaze into the pan and re-inserting the cake.  Once I did that, I poked holes in the bottom of the cake and poured on the rest of the glaze.  So easy and so good!  Thanks for sharing!  Yum!

This is a great recipe, very hard to mess up. I substituted peacans for walnuts and it made them taste like pralines. Also, i boiled out the rum in the glaze.

AMAZING! I just made this for a little family get together and everyone said it was their new favorite dessert! I followed the recipe exactly, the only thing I did differently was I made mini bundts instead of one big one and they turned out fabulous! They were so buttery and ooey gooey! YUM! Thanks!!

Very yummy.  I ran out of the dark rum and had to pull out the Bacardi 151, but the boys loved it even more.  Simple and good.

This cake is really good.  I made it when my sisters their husbands and children/grandchildren visited and everyone asked for the recipe.  For the most part I followed the recipe exactly as is except for a few minor changes....  1.  I only had Captain Morgan Tatoo (dark rum) on hand, so thats what I used.  It is incredibly flavorful.      2.  Eliminated the nuts......I don't like nuts but no one missed the nuts.     3.  I replaced the run called for in the glaze with Orange Juice since I am allergic to alcohol (unless its cooked off).       Again, a fantastic cake.  It is definitely a keeper in my house.  Will be making it again.

I have made this several times- and it works every time.  I have used spiced rum with the yellow cake mix and it is wonderful.  I used Kahlua with dark chocolate cake mix and it was also wonderful.  So easy.

I was talking with our friends about our Jamaican Wedding-moon and the rum cake we had as a wedding cake, so I found myself really wanting some rum cake. I wound up making this with golden rum because it was cheaper. The cake was incredibly moist and delicious and my friend called the glaze "spectacular." I will definitely make this again, though next time, I think I'll try spiced rum. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I usually dont' leave reviews but this cake was wonderful.  Put half the glaze in the bottom of the bundt pan and put cake back in to soak as suggested by other reviewers.  Will be making again.

Very easy and a real crowd-pleaser!  It bakes for me in about 35 minutes- make sure you don't overbake it, since that dries out any cake.  I use Capt. Morgan's rum, which gives a nice flavor, although I might try the coconut rum as others have suggested.  I used coconut milk (canned) instead of water and that added a nice touch of additional richness, but wasn't a must-do.  I had to send this recipe out to everyone at a potluck I just brought it to.  Yum!

I made mini rum bundt cakes tonight.  They look superb. the only change that I had to make was in the glaze. I only had
1/4 c. of bicardi rum left so I added 1/4
malibu rum to it.  They smell delicious. Will update my review once I get a chance to taste it.  Thanks for the easy to follow recipe.*Update* Tasted these yesterday,(NY-EVE) and thought it was just ok. tasted again today, NY day and it tasted better.  So I agree with other posters, the longer they sit the better they get.

I made this cake last night and some members of family tried it.  They ate the entire thing and so I had to make another one!  I also made some changes to the recipe by using butter and milk instead of water and oil.  I added pure vanilla flavor as well.  This recipe is definitely a winner!!

I made this cake last night for today's Christmas potluck at work and it was a total hit.  It was super moist and the flavor was amazing.  I did put the last 1/2 cup of rum with the sugar water to burn off some of the alcohol of the rum.  I also did what one member suggested which was to pour in 1/2 of the glaze in the pan, put the cake back in the then pour in the rest.  It did make it easier but the top of the cake ended up being a bit too "rummy", so I won't be doing that next time.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and it was great.

This turned out great.  I mistakenly took my glaze of before it had boiled for 5 minutes even after I had added the rum and boiled for about a minute or two.  I definitely noticed the difference.  Next time I'll add the rum and boil the glaze for the entire 5 minutes.  I'll also remove the cake from the pan after about 2 hours rather then allowing the cake to stay in the pan overnight.  I like the look of the cake that only marinates for two hours.

I have been using this recipe for a couple of years now.  The only difference between mine and this one is that the one I have came from Bacardi. I usually use Captain Morgan's spiced rum, but either way you make it, it always turns out fantastic!

Perfect!!!  And I mistakenly used cooked pudding powder.  It was still amazing.  I did the rest exactly according to recipe.  I will make this again and again, very easy and very impressive!  Love it!!

Outstanding cake!  I made this for a birthday at work and it was devoured. Several asked for the recipe.  I used Captain Morgan in the cake and Cruzan Rum Cream on the glaze. It's creamier and not as strong as straight rum.  I didn't alter anything except it only needs about 45 minutes to bake. I poured half the glaze into the pan and reinserted the cake for about 30 minutes then pulled it out and it dripped perfect. I made the cake again for Thanksgiving and left it in the pan to long and the glaze sealed it in the pan so don't make that mistake!  Delicious!  Highly recommend it.

Perfect for the holidays - tastes even better a day or two after you make it! Super moist. Thanks to Lindsay for the advice on the rum - right on! As she advised, I used Bicardi Select for the cake and Appleton Estates for the glaze.

This cake was so good, it is the best rum cake recipe that I have ever made. I didn't change anything I followed the recipe as instructed. I made it for Thanksgiving dinner along with three other of my family favorites and I was told that I have to make two rum cakes for Christmas dinner.

I've made this for years- but have used nuts and maraschino cherry pieces (for color)- and a butter cake mix instead of yellow. The easiest way to glaze: remove from oven and immediately drench with glaze while in the pan. Glaze will soak into cake. Cool for 30 minutes and invert onto plate. All glaze will be soaked up. If you grease/flour the pan, the cake will come out without sticking.

This was a great recipe. I had never had, much less made a rum cake before so I have nothing to compare it to other than comparing it to 'cake' in general.  It was very moist and had a great flavor - I used Bacardi Gold.  I took it to a Thanksgiving party and everyone loved it.  When you put half of the rum sauce in the pan and re-insert the cake, be sure to only let it sit for a little while and then turn it over so that the rum soaks in and makes its way through the cake.  I made the mistake of leaving the cake upside down in the pan overnight and then turning it over a couple of hours before serving, which made the top of the cake VERY rum-soaked (but not soggy) - much like a shot of straight rum.

This is the first time I've ever baked something that looked professional! Very pretty cake and tasty as hell. I followed the recipe pretty much as written, only cutting the walnuts in half and adding some vanilla extract to the glaze. I also added the rum to the glaze about one minute before removing from the stove. I used dark Bacardi in both the batter and the glaze. It just came out so perfect--moist, flavorful and gorgeous!

Incredibly delicious. Traveling through the Caribbean, I have tasted many rum cakes, and this is the best. So easy to make. I did add one teaspoon of pure vanilla extract to the the rum glaze, other than that I followed the recipe to a tee. I used Myers Dark Rum for the cake and glaze. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

AUTHENTIC!  I travel to the caribbean frequently, and this is EXACTLY like what you buy on the islands.  WARNING:  The glaze is alcohol!  This should not be served to children or at work!  And deleting the rum or glaze means you are really not making rum cake.  To each your own, but as is--this recipe is perfect!  (To make Gluten-free use, use GF cake mix and Jello Brand or Royal pudding mix).  I haven't tried the chocolate version, but this is also sold in the islands.

So good. And easy.  The only rum I had on hand was Barcardi 151, so I used a quarter cup for the glaze.  Definitely take the other reviewers' advice about using the pan to glaze the cake.

This Cake ROCKED!!! I have never made a bundt cake before so I was a little nervous.  I was a little confused about the 4 eggs as the cake mix already called for eggs so I didn't put it in, my cake shrank after it cooled but it still came out awesome. Next time I will add the four eggs and see if thats what it was. this recipe is great because its adjustable.

This is a very moist cake!  I followed the popular modifications and suggestions on which types of run to use, but it was a bit too strong for my tastes, so next time I think I'll use the light run through-and-through.  Other than that, fantastic!

This is a very delicious cake.  I was hoping for some kind of thick caramel glaze, but decided to trust the recipe. The glaze did thicken a bit when it cooled, but I loved that it was thin enough to penetrate the cake and make a rich gooey crust that was to die for.
The cake is perfectly moist.  I wouldn't change a thing.

Very good recipe and does not have that "boxy" taste.  I never use water in my box-cake batters. Depending on the cake, I use sprite, ginger ale, orange juice, milk or buttermilk.  For this one, I used ginger ale. Also added a little vanilla flavor and used almond slivers in place of the walnuts. 

Also, this was for a family dinner with a caribbean theme and kids were there, so I didn't want to overuse the rum.  I added less than a 1/2 cup.  I just added it to taste...no big deal!

Definitely a keeper!

This was a big hit this Christmas!  We made small, holiday themed cakes for gifts and they received rave reviews.  I must admit I kept one for myself - and almost wished I'd kept all of them after I tasted it.  Soooooo good.  The best rum cake I've ever eaten.

I loved this recipe!  The cake came out moist and very rummy.  I added an extra 1 tsp rum extract and 1 tsp butter extract.  I used Barcardi Gold rum as well.  I have also made the cake with chocolate cake mix.  The chocolate and rum together are wonderful.

I made this cake last night.  It was ready and in the oven in no time.  It smelled so wonderful.  I took the cake out at 60 minutes and it was cooked perfectly.  Made the glaze while it was cooling.  I glazed it at least 10 times.  It tasted like something professionally made.  I took half to work, rave reviews. Shared with neighbors, there is one slice left for my mom.  She better hurry or it might be gone.  Best cake I have ever baked.

I had all kinds of problems making this cake and it still turned out great. First my walnuts were expired so I didnt have those, then I went to pour my oil and I only had a quarter cup (if that) so I had to substitute applesauce, finally I couldn't find my bundt pan so I had to refrigerate the batter while I was out. Still came out moist and delicious. Very strong rum flavor, I used myers cause thats what I have.

This is a great recipe.  Very tasty.  I used captain morgan and instant bananna pudding as it was all I had and it turned out wonderfully.  Next time, the only thing I will do differnet is make more of the rum sauce for more coverage.  Great recipe!

During a recent move all my recipes were stolen.  I've never been able to find one to replace my rum cake.  This is very close, however, I also added one cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  It creates a very nice additon.

This is a really good recipe and the walnuts were a nice added touch.  I don't usually like walnuts but these kind of carmelize after they're cooked and the glaze in poured on top.  Very good.  I also used a dark chocolate cake mix with banana pudding and it was even better tasting.

Just like the Rum Cake in the Caribbeans. I made it in a regular size bundt pan and then made another batch in the miniture bundt pans.  It made one dozen and it came out excellent.  I gave it as gifts. When you use the miniture pans, it only takes about 30 minutes to cook.  I also took them out and put the rum in the pan and replaced the cake back in the pan.  I then poke holes with a toothpick and poured more rum on top.  I wish I had made the miniture ones earlier. I would have gave more of the cake as gifts, they were excellent and looked good.  Thanks for the recipe. This is definately a keeper. Oh also better the next day or two.  Some how the alcohol doesn't seem so intense.

This is the Bacardi Famous Rum Cake and I have made it for years!  I use Barcardi Light Rum for the cake and glaze and it works great!!  It is a delicious and moist cake; everyone loves it.  I always bake them at Christmas time!

This is a super moist cake! I did make a change...instead of using walnuts, I used toasted almonds and then instead of adding rum to the glaze,I added 1 1/2 tsp. of almond extract.  YUMMY!! 
Next time I am going to add 1 C. of sweetened coconut and use coconut rum. Then I will just use a regular glaze, no flavors or rum.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I got rave reviews at my work's Christmas Party with this cake.  People kept complementing my cooking abilities.  Little do they know that I'd be in trouble without AR and great recipes such as this one.  I love rum, so I made it as written.  I didn't want to reduce it in any way.  I still wouldn't.  Thank you so much for the recipe Jackie!

One of my all time favorite cakes. It never goes wrong. I sometimes add some run to the glaze, instead of water. This is for adults only. 

You can also change up the nuts. I've used almonds, hazel nuts, walnuts. Whatever is on hand.

Excellent and super easy!!  Next time I plan to use Capt. Morgans Spiced Rum and use some spices in the cake for a Spiced Rum Cake.  This was a hit at the potluck.  The rum flavor was very much there but not over powering like some Rum cakes can be.  There is also a coconut flavored rum that I plan to try for a pina colada rum cake.  I will use a touch of coconut extract in the cake for that one.

Very good! I made this for my husband's birthday as he is an avid Captain Morgan's Fan. I followed previous recommendations and used the Pillsbury cake mix with the pudding included and  cut down to 3 eggs and 1/3 cup oil as well as followed the  submitter's suggestion on glazing. The cake turned out nice and moist, however it wasn't as "rumm-y" as my husband and I were hoping. Next time I think I'm going to make this cake up a few days earlier and really let it soak in the glaze, plus I'm going to up the rum a little and see how that works out.

Excellent.  I took the advice of poking holes in the cake for it to absorb the glaze.  I also added 1/4 cup of Myers rum instead of 1/2 cup while it was still on the heat to burn off some of the alcohol taste.  One thing I will probably do differently is leave enough glaze to drizzle on top after the cake has absorb the initial batch.  I like a light flaky glaze on my rum cake

I made this rum cake for Christmas, but without the walnuts.  My family complimented me on the very simple and rich tasting rum cake.  It's hard to find a good recipe that is simple and moist.  I will definitely make this again.

Rum Cake Update: Take it easy on the glaze. I'd use half unless you want it to be super (and I mean drunk status) potent.

Excellent. I turned this into "Chocolate Rum Cake" by using chocolate cake mix and used rum from Costa Rica. It was SO good at the bridal shower I hosted yesterday. I made it the night before so it would have more flavor. Let me tell you, the piece I had for breakfast this morning was excellent!

A good to very good cake but I was hoping it would be excellent. I do not rate recipes 5 stars unless they are truly exceptional. Recipe produces true results and followed suggestions from other reviewers. I liked the quantity of rum and the flavor of the qlaze. The cake part was lacking (to me).

My Gosh, this was GREAT!  I used Bacardi Gold and it was "perfect"... just enough Rum for me (I like Rum) and just enuf for my hubby (who doesn't like Rum)... although I added the glaze too fast and had a broken cake in some parts, but that didn't deter us a bit from eating half of it last night! The "soggy" parts were the "best" parts!!!  And I also used 1/2c. of walnuts, just fine! Next time, I will try the candied pecans....

I made this recipe for a friends bridal shower. Everyone loved it and people were fighting over who would have the last slice to take home.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe is use peacons instead of walnuts (my friend is allergic) and it still came out wonderful.  What I recommend is after you let the cake cool for ten minutes, remove from the pan and then place it back in pan so when I brush on the glaze I don't lose any of it. The glaze collects at the bottom of the pan which ends up being the top of the cake.

This turned out very well. We used a top notch rum in this, and it showed, but really a good name brand dark rum would have been just as good.

So easy that you feel a little guilty for not working harder.  I make it a day ahead, and like to experiment with different flavors or rum.

This cake was amazing.  However, if you don't like a strong rum flavor, this isn't the cake for you.  I didn't add the nuts, as i don't care for them, but the cake was still awesome.  Thanks for a great recipe.

We made this cake for a family birthday party and it was very much enjoyed. However, we included some add-ons that I would recommend. We put whip cream in the middle mixing in blueberries and strawberries. Then more blueberries around the base. Also, we followed the above recommendation and used Captain Morgan in the cake mix and Bacardi for the glaze. I highly recommend this recipe.

I added a dash of cloves and allspice, along with a tablespoon of vanilla since I didn't have dark rum.  The taste turned out most yummy, but it fell to pieces getting the cake out of the pan, even after cooling for 15 minutes.  I served it with the rum sauce and a bit of whipped cream, and my husband thought it was very well flavored.  I would have given it 5 stars if it would have come out of the pan in one piece.

This is a great cake! I suggest using Bacardi dark rum (por supuesto!)In fact-Bacardi put out a recipe similiar to this. I garnished mine with marachino cherries....Do not be afraid to use all the rum! I poked holes in the cake so that the rum would absorb.

This is a fabulous recipe just as it is.  

Funny story:  the first time I made it I forgot to add the eggs (don't ask).  Obviously, the cake did not set up.  Although I would NOT recommend leaving the eggs out, the end result was still so yummy that we put it in bowls and served it over ice cream . . . looked like cobbler and was still delicious!  HA, who would've guessed!

I made this cake for Christmas and everyone LOVED it!! I agree about having to much glaze...you really only need about half. I'm making it again for a party tomorrow. This is a definite keeper.

We used pecans instead of walnuts.  I was also a little skeptical that the rum would over power the cake and glaze but decided to try the recipe as written.  Boy am I glad I did.  It was delicious!  I followed one reviewer suggestion and added ½ c of sweetened shredded coconut to the batter which we all really loved.  I only made ½ the amount of glaze the recipe called for which we found to be plenty.  I was sorry there wasn’t much left to have with coffee the next morning.  This recipe is a keeper, for sure.

well... I read the reviews and I was afraid of too strong a rum taste.  So I boiled half the rum with the sugar, and added the rest after the glaze was cooked.  After tasting the cake, I decided I must be a lush because I think it definitely needed more rum flavor.  Everyone else thought it was great.  Next time, I will follow the directions.  Thanks for sharing

This turned out very moist! The nuts are a great compliment to the rum flavor. I wasn't sure about using the entire glaze topping (looked like it might be too much), but I did and it was perfect. I think this is actually better the next day, as the rum flavors seem to set better with the rest of the ingredients. Is great to serve with vanilla ice cream!!

Tasty, moist and sweet.  Doubled the rum in the glaze.  As one reviewer suggested, I poked holes all over cake before I took it out of it's pan and poured all of glaze on it.  Let it cool and whenI flipped it out it came out perfect!  Thanks for sharing such an easy recipe...!

This cake is AWESOME. This is my first attempt at making rum cake and it turned out perfect. The thly thing I changed was to use Southern Comfort instead of rum because it was a treat for my boyfriend who LOVES So Co. Thank you SO much for this great recipe!!

This cake is devine! The cake I made was darker, I thought because of the rum made it cook up darker but regardless the cake was moist and yummy! People raved about this cake.

Loved this recipe for it's simplicity.  I made it for a dessert faire held by my son's band.  It was a hit!  I made the glaze with the rum added with the ingredients 'cause I didn't want too much alcohol at a school event.  However, I forgot about the glaze when the doorbell rang -- when I got back it was thick and caramelly.  I used it anyway and it was actually what everyone loved! I'm going to make it again but watch the glaze carefully because I, too, love wet rum cake. Thanks for the recipe -- I can't wait to try it with Spiced rum.

WOW! I took this to our last tailgate and seven people finished the whole thing! This is by far the best rum cake I've ever had! I was really surprised. I come from a "from-scratch family" and have never used a cake mix before in the 20 years I've been baking. I just didn't have the time to do it from scratch this time though, and am happy about it because I would have never known how wonderful this cake is! Who would have guessed-sometimes a mix can be better than homemade!

Wowee. This cake is rock 'em sock 'em delicious. I left out the nuts, and was sure to get the right size vanilla pudding... What a treat, and so moist! It's almost like eating pancakes or something... 
absolutely wonderful. 
(We made ours with Myers and it turned out great!!) Enjoy!

Fabulous!  I, too, will halve the glaze next time, as it was too potent and a tad soggy.  I served it with vanilla ice cream.  YUM!  Changes I made: I used 1/3 cup pecans instead of walnuts, Duncan Hines devil's food cake, and Jello chocolate pudding.

I actually found this recipe in a Bacardi Rum recipe booklet from the liquor store - I logged on here to see if there was a similar recipe and read the reviews before making it.  Turned out great - I used Captain Morgan's spiced rum and I only used half the glaze as I didn't want it soaked too much - if I know the cake will be eaten in one sitting I will use more but to have the cake last a few days I found it best to use half so as not to have a soggy cake to serve up to people.  This is so easy as well - anything involving a cake mix is usually a no brainer.

This is wonderful and easy.  The use of cake mix is a welcome time-saver, but the cake doesn't have the artificial flavor that cake mix gives many other recipes.  Definetly a keeper!

i tried different brand's of rum with this cake - i prefer to use the generic/inexpensive rum because it has less alcohol and the flavor is just right (especially for non drinkers).  if you like rum, try meyer's rum (most of my fellows thought this was way too strong.)

I made this for mother's day and it was a huge hit.  Not only is it easy, but everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe to a T and utilized the tip about reinserting the cake back into the bundt cake form to absorb the rum glaze.  It worked like a charm.  I will definitely be making this again.

EXCELLENT! Pouring the glaze in the pan and putting the cake back in it really made it great. I made it with Captain Morgan's Spiced rum. I have some chocolate ameretto rum now that I want to try it with. 5 stars all the way!

This delicious cake has become a holiday tradition at my house.  The kids don't care for the rum flavor, but the adults rave!  I add chocolate chips to the batter before baking.

This was perfect for New Year's party! Easy to make with the cake mix and pudding, and yet different. I will make this again however I will experiment with coconut or pecans, the walnuts were a little bitter to my taste.

I made this for a birthday party and everyone raved about it.  I omitted the nuts and replaced the oil with applesauce and nobody was the wiser.  I only used about 1/2 the sauce.  This cake was fabulous!

I made this recipe yesterday for friends and family and it was excellent.  I had saw reviews that the rum was to much and I reduced the amount but I will follow exactly next time. It could have used more rum. Even though I used less rum this cake was loved by everyone. EXCELLENT!!!!

I just came back from the Cayman Islands with a craving for rum cake, especially after having all the different types on the island.  I can honestly say that this version tops any rum cake I had on the island!  I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't use any nuts.  I also used skewers to poke holes in the bottom of the cake  to drizzle the sauce.   The first day it tasted great, but the next two days were even better.  Make this one a day ahead!

I've made two of these in the last three days and both of them lasted for about 30 seconds!  A wonderful recipe, reminds me of the Tortuga Rum Cakes I bought in the Cayman Islands a few weeks ago, but for nowhere near the cost!  I used Appleton Estates V/X Rum, and as far as I'm concerned, it turned out better than the cakes I brought back from my cruise!  Putting the glaze in the bundt pan is a really neat trick, too.

I brought this cake to work during the holidays and people are still asking me for the recipe. I used Bacardi Gold rum and it wasn't overpowering at all, very buttery... thank you for submitting this Jackie.

Unbelievably delicious.  I used Bacardi Select - the better the rum, the better the glaze and overall flavor of the cake.

Wow!!!  This cake was such a big hit!  SO easy to make, too.  I decreased the rum in the glaze to 1/4 cup, and it was still super boozie!  I think for next time, I will decrease it to 1/8 cup, as lots of folks don't like such a powerful alcohol taste (even though I do!).  Definitely don't serve this cake to kids.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Sorry to be the oddball, but the rum flavor was MUCH too overwhelming for me, so overwhelming that the cake needed to be thrown away-I could not stomach more than a bite or two. I love rum, but this was just too much. Other than that, it was a good cake- can probably be saved if I had reduced the rum in the glaze- perhaps 1/4 cup or less. The amount of rum in the cake seemed ok- it was the glaze that really killed it. :o( So yes, I will try again, but will certainly reduce the rum!

I have been making this cake for years but never thought to pour some of the glaze back in the pan and let it soak. This makes so much sense now instead of just pouring it on top. From now on, this is how I am going to do it. This is a mainstay on my holiday table and I have given many of these as presents. Very, very good.

I made this once before, but it turned out to be a big sloppy mess.  Turns out it was my own fault for not following the glaze directions.  I put it the rum with all of the other ingredients, then brought it to a boil.  Bleh!  This time it turned out beautifully.  I'm one of those people that drinks those fru-fru drinks with the umbrella(and about 1 teaspoon of alcohol), so I cut my rum in half.  Delicious!

I made the Coconut version for the 4th of July (a day early after reading all of the "too rummy" reviews).  No one at our party drinks much but everyone LOVED the cake.  There was no alcohol taste whatsoever.  I will DEFINITELY make it again. Thanks for a GREAT cake!

This was so good.  I took the submitter's advice and poured half of the glaze into the pan and the rest on top of the cake.  I poked small holes in the cake with an ice pick so the glaze would run through.  I also decreased the amount of rum in the glaze to 1/4 cup...didn't want to make anyone too happy!  Loved the chopped nuts in this.  Thanks for sharing Jackie.

Whoever commented that this tastes like the rum cake purchased in the Caymen Islands, the Tortuga Rum Cake, was absolutely right!  I loved it then, and I love this recipe.  I used the Malibu coconut flavored rum, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for sharing!  The entire family loves it!

I didn't cook the rum in the glaze as suggested by others, thinking that I like the taste of rum, and whoa, this was like drinking directly from the bottle.  Recipe needs a lot of tweaking.  The glaze shouldn't require that much butter considering the yellow cake is pretty flavorful by itself.

Amazing!!!! I don't bake much and was very nervous. But this one came out absolutely fabulous. Moist, delicious. I did boil the rum for the glaze and also re-inserted the cake in the pan. Soaked thru really well. I would refrigerating over night.

Awesome cake!  I have been looking for this recipe ever since I had rum cake in the Bahamas.  Thanks for sharing this one.

I did not have a dark rum so I used Malibu coconut rum...sooo good!! The cake turned out very moist, my whole family enjoyed it. I will make this over and over again. Next time I may try using coconut pudding.

I used 'pudding in the mix' cake mix, and this turned out nice and moist. It was pretty sweet with the glaze, and since I did as others suggested and boiled the rum with the glaze, I couldn't taste it at all. I'd say to throw it in about halfway through so you get at least some of the rum flaver, but not overpowering. It didn't go as fast as the boston cream pie at the party, but people liked it.

I just made this cake today and my family loved it.  It was so incredibly easy.  I am not a cook and I have never made glaze so I was a litte nervous but it came out great.  My husband is on his third piece already.  Also don't worry it may look like its too much glaze but its not.  I used white rum and it was great.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have made this several times and modified the recipe to suit my taste.  Once I used coconut extract and shredded coconut in the cake and extract again in the glaze.   I have used a butter recipe cake mix instead of yellow too. Both good. Thanks for the recipe.

Fantastic! I made this with chocolate "pudding in the mix" cake and omitted the instant pudding. 

Also left out the nuts, and cooked rum with the rest of the glaze. 

Got rave reviews but some said it wasn't rummy enough! So I will try stirring the rum in after the glaze-cooking next time.

I'm not a big fan of rum cake, but people truly love this cake.  Everyone that has a taste of this wants me to make one just for them.  It was too easy to make!

amazing! Lots of rum in the glaze, though. If you are serving to people who don't like alcohol, drizzle it over rather than soaking it upside down. Or soak it the day before; the flavor is a little less strong the next day.

This is the BEST rum cake I've made so far, after trying several recipes from this site.  What makes this one better is the increased amount of glaze.  That makes it richer and more decadent, but hey, that is what dessert is for, right?  I served this at a family gathering and everyone went nuts over it.

This was awesome!! Very moist, very flavorful. I will definately make it again!  Next time I intend to split it in half & add a custard with mini chocolate chips for the filling. I think its perfect without the filling too but I am going to try it a new way next time for my mother's Birthday cake. She is going to love it! Thanks for sharing!

I guess that I am the only one that thought this was way too strong!  However, the cake was very moist.  I will stick to the same recipe with the Bailey's Irish Creme instead.

fabulous- got rave reviews when served on Easter. Served with fresh strawberries and whipped cream! The only thing I would do is add more nuts. Also, I used light rum as thats all I had on hand but for a richer color would try the dark rum next time. Thanks so much for this yummy recipe.

This cake is the best! I used a cake mix with pudding in the mix so I omitted the vanilla pudding mix. I also decreased the eggs to 3 and the oil to 1/3 cup. It still came out moist and wonderful. This is a definite crowd pleaser.

Not only is this a moist and delicious cake,it was so easy to make too. I really like the walnuts on top. The only thing I did different was use light rum instead of dark just because we had it on hand and it was still good. Thanks for sharing. I will definately take this to share with the girls at work.

Wonderful! My picky family ate this up at Christmas. The glaze is incredible--very buttery and good. Do put the glaze in the pan and put the cake back it. It's hard to get all the glaze absorbed by just brushing it over.

It's good, soft and with texture. It is delicious and kind of easy to make. It's even better than the rum cakes I have in Jamaica. Even my pain in the butt hubby loves it as well and believe me, it's not an easy task to satisfy his appetite!

This may honestly become my absolute favorite dessert!  It was so rich and unbelievably good!  My husband had two huge slices and he is not much of a cake eater.  I served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Absolutely fabulous!  Tastes best the next day after glaze has fully soaked into the cake.  The suggestion to remove cake from pan, pour 1/2 of glaze into pan and then re-insert cake is the best!

I made this for the first time for Christmas Eve.  It was the ONLY cake for 3 that was eaten in it's entirity! I loved it- my family loved it and said it has to be on the menu for Christmas Eve from now on. I tried the glazing method of putting half back in the pan and it worked out great.  Give it a try!  It's definately the best!

This was the BEST! I made 5 during the holidays for different family/friend parties. EVERYONE raved and had seconds. Once I followed directions and glazed when it was still warm. Was worried as I thought it would turn out mushy- it didn't. Next time I glazed when it was cooled and it turned out to be more of a crunchy clear glaze which was festive looking. You can also put 1/2 the glaze on if you think it's too much and it still is very good. Great recipe!

This recipe is the very best. It's quick and easy. It's a hit everytime I make it. I make a Rum Sauce (warmed) to dibble over it as I serve it and homemade Whip Cream. This makes this cake to Die For! --OHMNA

Five stars!  Delicious and easy to prepare.  The tip about glazing is very helpful.  However, be sure and let it stay inverted for an adequate period of time to soak up all that good glaze.  My husband was in a hurry for a piece and I turned it too soon.  Ended up with glaze running out on the countertop!  This cake is hard to beat.

I will admit that I was skeptical about trying a cake with alcohol in the receipe, BUT my family and I enjoyed this cake a great deal.  I found that the cake tasted better after it sat for 1-2 days.  I would  highly reccommend it to any of you who might be considering it!  I will be making another one very soon.

This was wonderful!!!  It was very moist with just the  right amount of rum.  I am glad I read the reviews because I would have used granular sugar instead of white sugar (powered sugar).  I  will definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks!

This is wonderful.  I don't dare go to football tailgate party without it.  I've made 5 so far, 1 every weekend for the past 5 weeks.  Someone usually volunteers to clean up the plate with their finger, can't let any rum go to waste!

It was the best rum cake I've ever had!  Very moist, fluffy, and tasted excellent.  I have no complaints.  It was even quick and simple to prepare.  All my guests had seconds; even I did.

I've been using this recipe for years.  A easier version would be to use a box of yellow cake mix with pudding in the mix, and omit the instant pudding.  Use 3 eggs instead of 4 eggs, 1/3 cup of oil instead of 1/2 cup of oil.

WOW!!  This recipe was so easy and so good.  There goes the diet today!  I think I messed up the glaze though. I think I didn't boil it long enough. It really didn't matter though it was great.

I substituted pecans for walnuts, as I'm allergic to walnuts.  My husband said the cake was even better than the one my grandmother makes and sends to my mother every Christmas.  I thought that was a real compliment, as my grandmother is an excellent cook, and my husband always looks forward to her rum cake each year!

Great recipe. I don't own a Bundt pan, so I made it in a regular cake pan. The glaze makes tons so I do coats throughout the day as I pass by the kitchen until it's all used. Husband and friends gave it a thumbs up!

The cake was very good; however, everyone in my family thought the sauce was way too strong.  The flavor did mellow a bit after it had sit for a day.

I made this recipe to substitute for the rum cake I missed during the holidays.  The recipe was simple enough to quickly finish it without a lot of fuss. I used a cake mix that has pudding mix in it so I didn’t add the package of pudding. I soaked the nuts in rum before putting them in the bottom of the cake pan. I also added a tablespoon of sugar to the nuts (to candy them) before putting them in the cake pan. I followed the rest of the recipe as stated. This caked isn’t as good as the homemade cake I missed during the holidays but it’s okay.

Cut down to 1/3 instead of 1/2 cup of rum so it wasn’t as strong. Used real butter in place of oil.

Made with the Pillsbury gluten free yellow cake mix.  Cooked 40 min.  Let set 10 and then poured glaze into pan with cake still in.  Waited another 10 minutes then inverted onto cake stand.  Finished pouring glaze over top.

It is excellent. I will say I did not have vegetable oil, and rather than fight sunday before Christmas grocery traffic I substituted 2/3c of butter and the cake was fluffy and delicious. Just throwing this option out there in case you don’t have the oil like me.

Amazing! I followed another users advice and greased  and sugared the pan instead of flour, and poked holes into in while still in the pan and then poured the glaze over it. I’ve already made 3 for the holidays! Used a gluten free cake mix and was just as good??

I have made this cake many times and use different flavored rum. Everyone loves the cake. Sometimes I will substitute more rum for water. Doesn't matter how I make it everyone goes wild about the cake, or maybe it's the rum?

Easy and excellent.  If you have children eating it you can use rum extract instead of  regular  rum.

I used coconut rum and instead of walnuts used pecans and coconut on the bottom of the pan. I ran a knife threw the mix a bit before baking. My daughter and i love how it came out.

This is a cake all my family and friends request, it is over the top delicious!

I prepared the cake as instructed and it's so easy.

The only change I made is I use a baker needle to inject the glaze in the cake instead of the skewer.

It was so good I made it for thanksgiving it was a great hit . The only thing I did not like is that the Recipe wanted you to spray down the bunt pan and flour  it I Recommend you not do it there was Flour covering all the walnuts when I flipped it over I had to Gently scrape the flour off but other then that it was really good .

I found this recipe almost ten years ago and it is my go to recipe for rum cake. My family looks forward to it every year and I use this recipe to “gift” for all of the families on my husband’s side. I’ve probably made it more times but it’s too many to count. I always pour the glaze into the pan as directed and let it soak for a bit. Works like a charm. I’ve always preferred pecans so that is my only substitution.

I've made this recipe for years - it is the Bacardi Rum recipe for rum cake.  Unfortunately, cake mixes are no longer 18.25 oz., they are 15.25 oz which has impacted the way the cake turns out.  I've found several recipes online to make cake mix from scratch, which you can add to this recipe.  It helps to once again make the greatest rum cake ever!

I made this cake this weekend just to taste out to see if I wanted to make it for Thanksgiving and honey I must say it  was a hit. I made it Friday night and by Saturday night it was gone.  For me next time  I would add pecans and I will not leave it in oven for full 60 min. Mine turned out a little browner than i like but my folks did not care. I added cinnamon  and vanilla flavoring and 2 mashed bananas to the batter. I am making it again.

I love this cake!  It's easy and turns out very moist and delicious!  My friend liked it so much she asked me to make it for her birthday, almost a year after I made it the first time- it's that memorable!

Regarding the glaze, I followed the advice of pouring half of it into the Bundt pan after the cake has been removed, putting the cake back in, and then pouring the rest of the glaze on.  I let it sit about 10 minutes before turning it back out onto the serving platter.  I think this process helps even out the glaze so you're not getting pockets of rum.  However, if the rum taste is still too strong for you, you can always use less glaze.

Wonderful recipe, I didn't have any dark rum so I substituted it with some chocolate covered pretzel flavored vodka I had on hand. I also added coconut to the batter. One of the reviewers ideal of sprinkling the pan with a cinnamon and sugar mix was awesome too. I made the cake Saturday and by Sunday morning half the cake was gone mostly by my husband, he says I'm so evil.

Love Love this recipe! Followed the recipe except for a couple of changes. I add milk in place of water. I used Bacardi White Rum instead of dark rum. I made them in the Mini Bundt Cake Pans (6in). Cooked for about 45 to 50 minutes. Poked holes in the cake while still in Cake pan an poured half the glaze on. Cooled completely in pan. Turned the cakes on parchment paper and added remaining glaze. Let stand until Glaze completely absorbed.

This is my very favorite cake recipe. I make this cake for special occasions with friends and family. I did not have rum on hand so I used flavored rum (artificial, no alcohol) and it is just as good as the butter rum cakes with real rum.

This is almost exactly my grandma's  rum cake recipe that she would make every year. I LOVE it. I was having trouble reading her old handwritten recipe and found this to save the day!!

I just poured the glaze on with the cake still in the pan after poking some holes in. It soaks in fine and it faster then brushing it on. I messed up a little and didn't measure the glaze exactly, but thankfully it still worked out. My grandma's recipe says it's even better if you make a day or two ahead of time and store in an airtight container. I didn't do that, but it is so moist it does last for days and is good each day.

I had been wanting to make a rum cake for some time, but was looking for the "right" recipe.  I finally made it to take to a small (7 family members present) family reunion.  The cake disappeared in about a day and a half, and I've had requests to bring it to every reunion from now on!  I have a class reunion committee meeting coming up this weekend, and I've been asked to bring one there!  I made the cake according to instructions, except for the amount of rum in the glaze....  I added a couple of extra ounces to give it a little more kick.  I also made the cake about 3 days ahead of time, and stored it in the refrigerator, wrapping it in plastic wrap, so the rum glaze had time to penetrate the cake.  I used Bacardi Gold 80 proof rum.

Another hit!!!! After making it for the first time, I’m already getting request for thanksgiving and sooner! It’s taste amazing and that’s with me accidentally putting too much rum in the batter but it still came out great I just put less rum in the glace.

I made these in individual bundt pans! Turned out cute and was nice for serving. I do recommend poking holes in the cake and then drizzling glaze - much better rum taste throughout the cake !

I made it a couple times. I usually use milk when I make cakes & since I’m lactose I can’t have any. But I people that tried it loved it. This time I used Tippy Cow Orange Cream Rum & made it like a Orange Creamsicle Rum Cake. With orange zest in it instead of nuts, & put some rum in vanilla frosting to drizzle over it after the after the rum glaze. It smells good. I just need a Guinea pig to try it.

I used mini chocolate chips instead of walnuts (nuts don't belong in dessert, in my opinion).  I also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the glaze.  I used Vanilla Gold Shipwreck Rum.  Holy cow!  The glaze might be the most delicious thing I ever tasted.  AMAZING!  Wish I'd read the reviews that suggested leaving it in the pan while the cake absorbs the glaze.  Next time I will try that.  I did use a skewer to poke holes, and then brushed the glaze back up and into the cake, which I had placed on wax paper so as not to lose any glaze.  It did all absorb, although I think next time I'l try leaving it in the cake pan until it absorbs.   Can't wait to try this cake!  (Some reviewers say to refrigerate, and others say not to, so I'm not sure what to do with it overnight.)

I have been making this same recipe for years and it is wonderful.  I, too, pour most the glaze in the bundt pan, replace the cake in it, and pour the rest over the top and let it sit for a while.  So much easier than to keep adding glaze after you take it out of the pan.
The best tip is if you can wait 2-3 days to eat it, the glaze is absorbed all through the cake and is even better and moister.  The only problem is no one wants to wait.

I’ve made this cake and this type of cake several times.  This one is so delicious with a berry compote spooned on each serving.  My family’s favorite is to substitute Bailey’s Irish Cream (or a cheaper brand ??) for the rum - nothing else needed.  I too remove from bundt pan and put about half the glaze in the pan then return cake to bundt pan, poking holes then slowly pouring the remaining glaze over the cake.  Letting it ‘soak’ for 5-10 minutes then turning onto the serving plate before it cools too much so the glaze hasn’t hardened.  Really great cake!! Thanks for submitting!!

The cake was very moist & delicious.  My glaze never got very thick and I even cooked it a little longer than indicated in the directions.  It was still very delicious.  I put a layter of nuts & glaze on the cake tray & then placed the cake on that layer.  I also poked holes in the cake before pouring the glaze over it so it would soak into the cake more.  I highly recommend this recipe.  It was both super simple to make and delicious!

We go to St. Thomas every year and I bring back different flavored rums.  I use this as my basic recipe and improvise depending on the flavor I want.  Yesterday, I used lemon blueberry rum, lemon pudding, and added blueberries.  No nuts. It was delicious!

I didn't make this, but I asked my mother for rum cake for my last birthday and she used this recipe. It is AMAZING. INCREDIBLE. The glaze is pretty lethal, so if any changes were to be made at all, you could cut the uncooked rum down to half.

It was very good, nice and moist.  I did put half the glaze in the pan and place the cake back in to absorb it after using toothpicks on top and bottom to let it soak in better.  I also added a pinch of cinnamon.  I think the walnuts could be lessened to half a cup or omitted altogether if walnuts are not desired.  It was the first rum cake I have ever made and it was awesome.

Delicious! I used pecans instead of walnuts, and followed the suggestion to put half the glaze in the pan and return the Bundt cake to soak while puncturing the bottom and pouring on the rest of the glaze. Watching the video was also helpful!

Delicious! Only thing I did differently than recipe is after letting it cool for 10 min, I popped cake out, poured some of the glaze into pan, put cake back in, then poked lots of holes in bottom of cake and poured remaining glaze and let set until completely cooled. Super tasty recipe!

The trick of removing cake from pan, pouring half the glaze in pan and reinserting cake before poking holes and spooning remaining glaze over the bottom was GENIUS! Worked like a dream!! Made entire cake moist and rummy. Best rum cake I’ve ever made! The only one you’ll ever need! WooHoo!

This is  my favorite allrecipes recipe of all time!  Cake comes out perfect every time and is a crowd pleaser!  I follow the recipe completely except I am a little more generous with the crushed walnuts and instead of just brushing the glaze on at the end, I poke holes in the bottom of the cake (before I turn it out of the bundt pan) and pour the glaze.  I let it sit and soak and then I turn the cake out.  I always save some glaze to brush on top though.

Delicious.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I made this the day before serving.  We actually thought the leftovers were just as good or maybe even better the second day.  Stayed super moist.  Depending on my time, I would not be at all afraid to make this cake 2 days prior to a party.  
I did remove the cake from the pan after 10 minutes and let it cool more while making the glaze.  I put half of the glaze in the pan, reinserted the cake then poured the rest of the glaze over the top.  I kept the cake in the pan  (covered after it cooled completely) until the next day.  
Everyone loved this cake.  Thanks for the recipe.

It’s great considering how EASY it is. I didn’t have rum and it’s a Sunday so I had to use what I had in hand, Jack Daniels whiskey cider. Not sure how munch it changed the flavor but I really like this cake! I will definitely make it again. I had a slice tonight and plan to take the rest to work as a NYE treat

I have made this nearly every year the last 5 years.  It’s always a hit.  If sticky glaze isn’t your thing I’ve made it without and it’s still good. Also I use pecans on the top and bottom since I don’t like walnuts.

Make sure you add the glaze as soon as possible to avoid it hardening and not absorbing into the cake.  Very tasty and moist cake otherwise!

I love cooking and I don't like to bake. But I made this because it's a box cake and box pudding and I love rum cake. My husband Raves about it. It's a no-brainer... get a pretty fleur de lis bundt pan and voila, life of the party....recommend turning out the cake onto a rack and pouring the glaze into the bundt pan and replacing the cake into the pan (it won't fall apart) for hours to let it soak up the liquid...the rum, really.  This cake is magnificent and fun and a great presentation.  I'll try to add a photo after it's  soaked.

I made it as the reicpe recommends, but remove it from the oven at 50  minutes and then let it sit and continue cooking for 10 before applying the glaze. It stays more moist and is still baking in the pan on the stove.  Also, have considered using Malibu Rum on the cake glaze?  Anyone ever try that? looking for advice... I usually use Myers Dark for both the cake and the glazee. Many thanks.

Love love love this recipe!  This is hands-down the best rum cake I have ever had! Every time I make it it gets rave reviews and is always requested to bring the holiday gathering. Iuse almonds instead of walnuts but otherwise would not change a thing.

Very good as written, however I have also made it with some tweaks.  I combined batters for yellow cake and pound cake to make it more dense.  I also grate some orange zest into the batter and a little in the glaze.  Pecans instead of walnuts.  These additions took it from very good to WOW.

My family and I loved this recipe! I made this for my fiance's birthday. The rum glaze creates a wonderfully crisp, sugary crust on the outside of the cake, and it's really not overly boozy as others have claimed. I would suggest they use a darker and lower-proof rum if this is too much for them to handle. Next time I may leave out the pudding and see if the glaze soaks all the way in. There was a very obvious line where it stopped soaking into the cake, only about 1/2 - 3/4 of an inch down in. Otherwise a perfect crum cake! Yum!

I made this  cake exactly as the recipe  goes for a co-worker's birthday and people couldn't stop talking about how good it was. I used the suggestion from another reviewer to poke holes in the cake while still in the pan and pour the glaze that way. Worked like a charm.  Very easy to make, too.

I made this for a party and everyone loved it! It looks amazing and tastes just as good. I changed nothing about the recipe. I jabbed a spoon in the bottom and let the glaze soak for about 2 hours. I would make it exactly the same.

Made this, and it is delicious.  However, the glass is too rummy for our taste.  I did add chopped, chunked Apple in the bottom of the bundt pan with butter and brown sugar instead of the walnuts.  Definitely will be making again

Simple recipe. I didn’t take it out of the pan and soaked it overnight in the rum sauce. In the morning the whole cake was soaked and tasted delicious. I did have to keep watch because it says to bake for 60 minutes, 50 minutes was almost burning it so I’m going to eye it with 40-45 minutes next time. It didn’t burn thankfully.

Made this *multiple* times, and it is an amazing recipe, truly. I printed the recipe originally in late 2011, and it has debuted at Thanksgiving, whole hosting dinner with friends, and has been requested directly by the misses.

This cake was A-Ma-Zing!!! I used the recommendation given in the "most helpful review" and used 2 types of rum: Appleton & Captain Morgan. It was De-Lish!!! I got rave reviews from guests and will definately make it again.  In fact, I'm making it on Friday for a girl's night/birthday celebration!! Can't wait!! Definately try this recipe....you'll be glad you did!!!

Delicious and seriously rummy rum cake - recipe perfect as written. I did poke holes throughout the cake with a skewer before glazing for even better absorption.  Pouring half of the glaze in the bundt pan and carefully placing cake back in it as suggested at the top of the recipe worked wonderfully.  I will definitely make it again!

I made this cake for my Husband's Birthday -  He is not even a cake person but says this is his favorite by far and he ate a few pieces.  We had a few people at his party that also do not usually eat any cake, and they each ate their entire piece.  I used the Pillsbury mix but since they come in 15.25oz boxes now, I had to add an extra 3 ounces of a homemade cake mix (or you could just get another box of Pillsbury mix and take 3 ounces from it).  Since Pillsbury already adds the pudding mix I was able to omit that ingredient.  I used pecans instead of walnuts because it's what I already had on hand.  For the Rum, I took the advice from the "most helpful positive review" (by Lindsay W) for this cake and used 2 different rums.  For the cake, I used Captain Morgan and for the glaze I used Appleton Estates --- DELICIOUS.  I had a piece today (day after making) and it is even better -- Next time I will make a day ahead of time and keep it refrigerated.  Keeping the cake chilled makes it refreshing, especially for mid-July.

I made this recipe but I changed some things.  I used light rum instead of dark it seemed to give it more kick.  Also,  I leave out the nuts because of my allergy and the last time I made the recipe my glaze was not as thick as I would have liked it.

I searched high and low for a "from scratch" rum cake and I kept finding variations of this recipe, so I dubiously gave it a shot. I was not disappointed! Amazing flavor and easy to change up  by swapping the rum you use! I have made this recipe twice now, both times making 2 cakes at a time (4 cakes total.) Per other reviewers suggestions and my personal preferences I made the following changes: swapped pecans for walnuts,  whole milk for water in the cake, and melted butter for oil in the cake. These changes do make the batter very thick, but gives the cake a wonderful flavor and texture. With these changes my cakes were done in 45 min. I agree with the current top reviewer that using different rums in the cake and glaze is ideal. To help balance out the sweetness of the cake I like a really dark rum (Kraken Black Spiced Rum) and something a little more mild  for the glaze (George Bowman Dark Caribbean Rum.)  Also recommend adding a small pinch of sea salt to the glaze while it is boiling. I didn't brush the glaze over, I carefully flipped the cakes onto a cooling rack (after I let them cool while making the glaze) then poked them all over with a wooden skewer. I poured just under half the glaze in the bottom of the pan, them put them back in their pans, skewered the bottoms of the cakes then slowly drizzled the rest of the glaze. Much easier to make them travel this way too, just throw plastic wrap over and you're set! I will make this again and again, thanks for the recip

I have made this a few times, but never posted a review. It always came out quite well. I have used a regular bundt pan, but tried a mini bundt pan. If you use the mini pan, fill each one half way, and you'll probably need to two mini pans, which would allow you to potentially up to 12 mini cakes. Cooking time would be about 20-25 minutes for if you do this. Looking forward to trying different spirits with this. The rums I have used are Gosling's Black Seal, Captain Morgan, and Diplomatico Reserva Exclusiva, which is my favorite sipper (and it was what I had in the cabinet). It produced the best flavor.

This came out great! The only change I made was less walnuts than what the recipe called for. I also poked holes in the bottom of the cake with skewers and poured the glaze over the holes while it was still warm. Everyone really enjoyed and I'll definitely make it again!

Didn't use the nuts as I used this as a King Came for Mardi
Gras.  Colored some of the batter green and some batter purple. Drizzled white icing with colored sugars.  Served at a large party and it was a great hit.  
A keeper.

Somebody gave me a similar recipe but instead of water using milk. This time I followed this recipe and used water I actually like this better. Also, nuts give me acne so I skipped those.  I make rum cake all tne time so using this recipe going forward. Thank you!!

Very strong rum flavor. Would benefit greatly from some spices like allspice, cinnamon, mace, and ginger to balance it out.

Excellent recipe and cake.  The only changes I made were pecans instead of walnuts and I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the glaze after I took it off the heat.

Excellent !!   I made 3" bundt cakes for Chhristmas gifts and they were raved about.  My husband brought home a Golden Rum instead of dark rum and it was  very good.   Can't wait to make it with dark rum also.

I have used this basic recipe for years, my favorite change up is to use Captain Morgan Spiced Rum with 3/4 cup each chopped pecans and maraschino cherries to the batter instead of the nuts for the top. I never thought of putting half the glaze into the pan and placing the cake back into it... will try that this year for the holiday gifts  I make.

The cake was very moist, the alcohol was just a slight taste.  Poking holes in the top knocks off a lot of the walnuts,  so I places holes on the outside and inside about 1 inch from the top and made 2 cakes. One following directions and the other a spiced rum with a chocolate mix and pudding. Both were a hit. A little doctoring up can make a good change.

Absolutely delicious. I did find there was too much glaze. I kept brushing it on but still only used about half the amount. Did anyone else feel the same way?

I made it for a pot luck dinner, with a couple changes.  I used the Betty Crocker spice cake mix and the Jello brand pumpkin spice pudding.  I used Goslings Gold rum (newer, but very good flavor) and also made a bit more rum syrup than called for.  I had to add it a bit at a time so it wouldn't overflow, and really soaked the cake.  Everyone who tried it RAVED about how good it was.

This recipe is delicious! I've made it several times and each time it was a hit. One time I used pecans instead of walnuts and coconut rum because it's what I had on hand at the time and they both came out great!

The cake part was perfect. It may have even needed more rum but when I poured the glaze into the pan and then put the cake back in it was to wet on the top when I took it back out. You could really taste the rum in the top.

I read many of the reviews, and incorporated the suggestions into my creation last weekend. Using walnuts and pecans, Myers Dark rum and 2% milk in the cake, sifting the cake and pudding mixes, using J. Wray (Appleton) Jamaican Gold rum in the glaze, and poking holes with toothpicks before glazing and reinserting the cake into the pan. Clearly, there are people who LOVE this recipe so much, that this is TRULY TE ULTIMATE RUM CAKE EVER! Many thanks to all those who have reviewed and shared their suggestions, it was the best "wedding" cake ever!!

This is my husband's new favorite! It reminds us of our vacation to the Caribbean! I wouldn't change a thing. The tip to pour 1/2 the rum glaze into the bottom of the bundt pan and then put the cake back in is great. I would recommend poking holes into the top of the cake before doing this to help the glaze soak in.

I made this and it was excellent! The only mistake I made, was to listen to one of the reviews. She said to use pan spray and granulated sugar in place of flour! Wrong! It did not come out easily , in fact it stuck to the pan! Next time I will stick to the original recipe. I can't give it 5 stars until I make it again according to the recipe.

I made this cake for an office party, with several adjustments, and everyone loved it.  

The changes that I made were:

1)  I didn't make a bundt cake.  I made it in a rectangular cake pan, sprinkled the walnuts on top, baked the cake, then pricked the cake all over with a skewer after it was done and poured the glaze over it.  Then I let it soak in for a few hours.  I did not invert the cake, but served it straight from the pan. 
2)  I started with a pineapple Ducan Hines cake mix to make a  pineapple-rum cake.
3)  I replaced the water in both the cake and the glaze with pineapple juice (from the can of pineapples) and replaced the white sugar with brown sugar.  
4)  For the glaze, I melted the butter and brown sugar in a pan, then added the pineapple juice, rum, and crushed  pineapple.  I cooked it on the stove for a few minutes on low heat to evaporate the alcohol, cook the pineapple, and thicken the sauce a little.  Note, I added the rum during the cooking process for the glaze, not at the end.  Next time, I might try making the glaze with pineapple jam instead of fresh pineapple, or blending the finished glaze, for a smoother finish.  
-------  I guess it's different enough to almost make it a new recipe, but I was inspired by this one, and  I know that, even without the pineapple, this recipe makes an awesome cake.

I used milk instead of the water and I topped it with confectioners sugar to make it stand out a but more in terms of decor. I also did not use any nuts because my husband is allergic.

I make this all the time - I've even made it non-alcoholic (for bringing into work) by using fruit juice in the cake and glaze rather than rum.  My go-to is to use coconut rum, coconut pudding, and (unsweetened) dried coconut for the top - everyone goes crazy for it!  One main tip is that I found that the box mixes I use are actually less than 18.25 oz , making it as written, without supplementing the mix, results in much too moist a cake, and it always breaks coming out of the bundt pan (but still tastes great).  I finally wised up and now weigh the mix, adding enough all-purpose flour to get to 18.25oz.  Everything else I keep the same, and it does the trick - the cake is still moist and delicious, but it holds together much better! I like to let the rum soak into the cake for at least 24 hours before serving.

I will definitely make this again. I had been waiting on my grandmother's recipe because it was a family specialty. But this tastes just like when my family makes it. I made 50% more glaze because I remembered it sitting in glaze when I was younger. So I converted the glaze ingredients to 150% and used glazing tips from the author and some of the other reviews. Additionally, I slowly added the rum to the fresh glaze to avoid an overbearing taste, the ratio seemed a bit much but it came out fine with that caution. And do remove it from the burner before adding rum, as I read in another review, it does bubble even after removed.  I poked holes with a meat fork ( because I don't have any formal toothpicks) on the bottom and sizes before removing the cake once it was done and poured some glaze in the sides and on the bottom and let it absorb for a few minutes. Then I removed the cake poured glaze into the pan and re-inserted the cake. That, by far was the most difficult part as, every other step was straight forward. I then poured the remaining glaze on the bottom and let it sit for an hour with a pie tin over top to keep in moisture and others away while it marinated. I removed it onto a somewhat deepened platter for any drippng glaze to be absorbed into the bottom of the cake. It tasted like happier times. Thanks for bringing good memories to the present. I plan to share this golden moment with the people in my life as an adult by making more of these wonderful Golden Rum Cakes

It was way too dense.  Just horrible.  Plus the rum was way too strong.  I did not like this at all.  Tasted it and threw it out.  Thank Gods I made it in advance as a test before I took it to a party.  I ended up bringing something else instead.

This cake came out so good and was so easy. I followed the recipe, but I did remove the cake from the pan, put in half the glaze reinserted cake pored the remainder of glaze and left it soak over night"with Malibu rum" Removed to a cake stand and sprinkled powdered sugar. It was beautiful and delicious!

I mixed cake and pudding mix the way recipe directions said to except for baking cakes in mini size and using bacardi light for a get together. They became the perfect mouthful and star of the gathering by far.

Made it several times -- it's an asked for favorite with family and friends.  Replace the water with heavy whipping cream makes the cake denser along with the calorie count.  I also line the bunt pan with foil and then pour the rum glaze in the bunt pan right out of the oven before placing the cake on a plate -- this allows the rum glaze to soak into the cake evenly instead of just at the bottom of the cake -- foil is a must if you don't want the cake to stick and split  to the sides of the bunt pan-- although no one seems to care what the cake looks like, it gets eaten pretty quickly.  I read that others have poke holes for the glaze that's a great idea.  I use Bacardi Rum.

I didn't have a yellow cake mix or dark rum, so I used what I had on hand: a Devil's Food mix & Malibu coconut rum. It was AMAZING!! Definitely adding this to my list of go-to cake recipes!

Did not add the pudding mix and it turned out great, just had to bake it a little longer. It's definitely better a day or two after.

I absolutely loved this cake and served it to my appreciative family on Christmas day.  They adored it! 
I made a mistake that turned out to be delicious.  I accidentally combined the stick of butter into the cake batter.  When I went to do the glaze, I realized my error.  So I got another stick of butter to use for that.  I was worried, but it turned out great!  I'll make sure to do it again.  Everyone agreed it was the best cake EVER!

This is truly a RUM cake and delicious!  I made it for company on Christmas Eve, and it was a big hit.  Good served with a dollop of whipped cream on the side or just as is.  I sifted the cake mix and pudding together before adding the other ingredients, and the result was a feather-light cake but still brimming with delicious rum taste.  I followed the suggestion to take the cake from the pan, pour half the glaze in and reinsert the cake before pouring the rest of the glaze on.  I poked holes with a wooden skewer all over the cake but the glaze was absorbed so quickly, I could have probably skipped that step.  Before serving, I paraded the cake around the table so that everyone could smell the fabulous aroma!  I will definitely make this cake again!

Excellent cake! Super moist. I did reduce the amount of rum slightly to 1/3 cup in cake and a 1/4 cup in glaze. Even with the reduction you could still taste the rum in both cake and glaze.

I just made this cake today and it is currently soaking up the glaze so I can't rate this yet.  What I wanted to comment on was this -- the ingredient list mentions 1/4 cup of rum to be put in the glaze but no where in the recipe does it indicate to add this.  It only mentions that to make the glaze, bring the butter, water and sugar to a boil.  I actually went and found a different Rum Cake recipe to verify that rum actually goes in the cake as well as in the glaze.

I make several of these every Christmas to give as gifts and one for the family.  Always get lots of compliments.  If people only knew how easy they are to prepare.  Sometimes I use dark rum, sometimes spiced rum, sometimes golden rum.  All with great results.

This recipe has served me well for the past few years. I always use this as the basis of my rum cakes.  This year, I used pineapple rum in the cake and in the glaze  and added crushed pineapple to the cake. YUMMMMMMMYYYYY!

I poured my batter into 4 small loaves. I cooked it at 325 degrees for 40 minutes before the toothpick came out clean. Perfect for small gifts for the Holidays! It was delicious and had so many compliments on this Rum Cake. Don't change anything, perfect as is!

I was hesitant about this recipe because I never use cake mixes, but went ahead because of the glowing ratings. This is  moist and wonderful! I brought it to work and it was gone in less than 45 minutes. Everyone raved about the moistness.

I did use only half the glaze and it was plenty.  I saved the other half and will make another cake for home.

This turned out very good.  I used crushed pecans for the nuts and added an additional stick of butter to the topping recipe.  Oh and I also added a 1/4 tsp. of vanilla to the topping recipe mix. My wife said I need to start selling these as it tasted so good.

I didn't change a thing about this recipe. I did use spiced rum.  I made this for my hubby's birthday and he loved it. It's even better next day with coffee when all that yummy rum sauce has saturated into the cake!

I've made this Rum cake several times! Once the cake comes out of oven I let it cool on a rack and then I make my glaze, I keep the cake in the pan upside down, Polk holes and pour my glaze on and once the glaze is soaked up in cake I flip it over and place a plate. This recipe is one of the BEST! Thank you AllRecipes.

This is my family's favorite dessert - I make it for all of our family get togethers.  I don't use the nuts (due to allergies) and add either dried cranberries or chocolate chips to the batter before baking.

Have made it twice now for a couple of parties. People loved it and asked for the recipe. Sifted the cake and pudding mixes as per comments and used Bacardi gold (what I had around the house). The best part is where the glaze has gotten through. Need to figure out how to get the glaze to soak all the way through. Even with the suggestion to upend the cake back into the pan with half the glaze, still doesn't quite get through. Will try skewering more holes in the cake this time.

Most definitely I will make this again. This was easy and tasted absolutely sensational!! For the rum I used Appleton Estate VX for both cake and glaze!! With 8 ppl, the entire cake was finished. On a hot summers day, my hubby added vanilla ice cream! Crazy delicious!! Thank you so much!!!

This is a popular cake for just a bout every occasion, and has always been a hit. It isn't as heavy as a fully frosted cake, which makes it a good choice even in the summer. The recipe I usually use is almost exactly the same as this one, the exception being  that this one has the excellent tip about  pouring half the glaze into the bundt pan and putting the cake back in. Excellent tip!

Began to follow the recipe but discovered I had no rum. What I did have was Calico Jack Pineapple Coconut flavored rum. What a great substitution! Best flavor ever.  You might think too sweet? Never

Loved the recipe. Made it for Mother's Day. I think I that a total of  one cup of dark rum for this recipe is a tad much. For me it left a slight bitter aftertaste.  Next time, I will try to use a lighter rum. I feel that the dark rum is too overpowering for me. Overall, my family loved it.

It was my first time making this cake and I was surprised that it was so simple to make. I followed the advice of others and left the cake in the pan, poked holes in the bottom, and poured the glaze over the sides of the cake as well. It was nice that everything was contained in the pan so there was not much mess. I brought it to a party and everyone loved it. Actually, people asked to take it home! Will definitely be making this again for my next gathering!

Made this cake for a bake sale.  I only had Black Seal (BDA) rum and saturated it.  Only made one and the people at the bake sale were fighting over the cake.  Will make it again.  Great recipe.

Great recipe! The cake always turns out moist and soft, and the rum glaze is to die for. All time favorite cake recipe! We added a little sprinkle of chopped pecans to the batter and it was even better!

I made this for a co-worker who challenged me to make it. I made this vegan and gluten free, so, it wasn't as big as all of the others pictured. It looked like the runt of the litter, but beautiful! I hope she likes it. Being for south Florida, I used Barbancourt, Five Star Haitian Rhum.

An all time favorite in my family.  I got this recipe from my parent's neighbor about 30 years ago and have been making it ever since.  

One change in the recipe I have,  put the nuts on the cake last, just before baking rather than in the pan before the batter.  That way when you pour the rum glaze on, then flip the cake onto a plate, the nuts are crunchy and glazed (delish) and are under the cake.  I love the texture of the crunchy nuts with the moist soft cake.

Changes to cut about 200 calories per serving according to MFP.  1). Used sugar free vanilla pudding mix. 2) replaced the oil used in cake with unsweetened apple sauce 3) replaced sugar with Truvia blend sugar for the glaze.  Although the "glaze" wasn't shiny, but it tasted just as good.  I didn't have a bundt pan so I used a 9x13 pan.  Baked it for about 35 min.  Great cake.  Thank you for the recipe.

I had buttermilk to use up so I used it instead of water., and I used Pillsbury w/pudding in mix, so I omitted the pudding, and I used pecans instead of walnuts. I used Meyer's Dark Rum.

I have made this cake many times and I love it.  I use a spiced rum in the cake batter and a peach flavored rum for the glaze. This cake lasts less than a week in my house. Just follow the directions and it will come out great.

I made this and gave a buddy half of it, now I'm getting requests to cook more, only thing I did different was using a 9x13 instead of a bundt pan!! I also used light rum, montego bay, instead of dark and butter yellow cake mix...SO good!!!!

I made this using Captain Morgan Tattoo rum. Flavor was great, though I cut the sugar in the glaze in half to compensate for the sweeter rum. The texture of the cake was a bit too fluffy-soft for my taste. I think I'll stick with a firmer cake base. Was a good, easy, and fast recipe though. (fast aside from baking time. But great with my knee troubles.)

This recipe is just right. I did not change a thing. I used pecans instead of walnuts. I was told Myers dark rum was  really good so that's what I used. :)  I made it for the first time  for  our daughter in laws mom, it's her favorite. I tried the Minnie bundts  and she loved them!  Today I made the 10' bundt . Taste great!  I did cool 10 minutes. Turned it out  and put some rum glaze in the bottom of the pan, put the cake back in then pocked the bottom of the cake and used the rest of the glaze. When it all sunk in I put out onto the plate.????

This cake is very good, moist and I will make again. It does have the box mix favor, but that didn't bother us. Made without nuts because we don't like and butter in place of oil and milk in place of water, because that's what I do with box mixes. I used Myers Dark Rum and it tasted terrific. Next time I will poke holes on the top to get more glaze in the cake. My cake mix had pudding in it.  Would like to make with coconut rum.

I loved this rum cake recipe, and I made it especially magical.  In place of the 1/2 cup vegetable oil and 1/2 butter, I substituted a stick of butter and 2/3 cups of virgin coconut oil, that I had put in a slow cooker with 1/8 ounce of good-quality marijuana for about 14 hours.  I strained this "cannibutter" and used it in place of the butter and oil.  I used Myers rum as my rum in the recipe.  I served the cake warm with Hagen Dazs pineapple coconut ice cream and it was to die for!!

This cake is awesome! The only thing I will do differently next time is use a better rum.  I just used a generic one from the grocery. Still delicious, but thinking a better rum will give stronger and better flavor.

A Gluten Free Option!
Thanks for a delicious cake recipe!
I made this cake gluten free and it turned out really well.  I made two substitutions: I exchanged the traditional yellow cake mix with the King Arthur Flour Brand GF Yellow Cake Mix (22 ounce size) AND I substituted the instant vanilla pudding for the sugar free version (1.0 - 1.5 ounce size).  Everything else remained the same in the cake preparation.  I baked the cake for approximately 72 minutes (or until the internal temperature read 200 degrees).  I made a substitution when preparing the glaze, using a cup-for-cup white sugar substitute (the store's brand of Splenda) in place of the white sugar.  
While the cake rose so beautifully in the oven, after taking it out and allowing it to cool for the 10 minutes, it did deflate, but not too badly!  Because of the "shrinkage," the cake pulled away from the pan, allowing me to leave the cake in the pan (inverted), where I poured 1/3 to 1/2 of the glaze around the edges of the cake.  It took about an hour for the cake to absorb the glaze, and the remainder of the glaze I served alongside the cake for those who wanted more.  YUMMY!

My two cents is wait at least 12-24hrs after glazing to enjoy the cake.  When freshly glazed (especially using the inverting-in-pan method suggested by the author), you get a very heavy concentration of very sugary rum at the top which detracts from the rest of the flavors.  When we enjoyed the cake on days 2-5, everyone LOVED it as the rum had distributed itself well throughout the entire cake!

I had been waiting for the holidays to make a rum cake with some this  Banana Vanilla Rum I bought while I was in St. Martin a few months back. Now, the only problem will be how I can go back on vacation to get more rum for next year!! Thanks to many of the suggestions, this turned out awesome! I added milk instead of water, made mini bundt cakes and threw in some toasted coconut with the walnuts. My husband loved it and said it was better than his mother's! That's a big a deal because we both love her rum cake.

Loved by everyone!! Noone could keep their hands off it. 

My only recommendation is the glaze doesn't really need the 1/4 cup of water. I could of screwed up the glaze too though. It came out good just a little more watery than I would of liked. The cake itself was phenomenal.

I've made this recipe before to ovations but now that one of the family has celiacs I decided to do a gluten free box cake. Added the pudding (both sifted together) and because my bundt cake mold has pine trees as its shape, I added the pecans to base of the cake-after spraying the mold, I poured in the cake mix and finally the nuts. Everyone loved it...was nervous  the gluten free cake would be too mealy but the rum really soaked evenly thru the cake! Now it's a must for every Christmas Eve!

I haven't had rum cake since a teenager and was feeling nostalgic so I searched and found this recipe.  Easy to make, although, I didn't add the 1/2 c rum to the batter. I also only used half the butter the glaze calls for and a mix of coconut and light rum. I took the advice to add glaze to pan and return cake. Then I poked a few holes in the bottom and added the rest. Allowed to stand for 15 or 20 mins and returned to plate. Be prepared for some glaze to spill when plating. The cake is super moist and delicious!!!

I rarely use cake mixes, but I've been making this recipe for years and it's always a hit.  I've made it exactly as written, but more commonly I reduce the amount of rum in the glaze and boil it to reduce the alcohol content.  We like the rum flavor without the extra alcohol from our cake! Usually, I make rum whipped cream (whipping cream, sugar, and rum all whipped together) to served on the side, which is my family's favorite way to eat this.  I've made it with many different types of rum, but typically use light in the cake and either dark or coconut for the glaze.  Overall, it's very easy and quite good.

I've made this several times and it was a big hit.  I found that the cake will drain forming a puddle beneath it if using all of the glaze.  I put some of the glaze in a dish to pour on individual servings after warming.

I have made this cake many times over the years.  My family and co-workers love it!  I make it in a 9 x 13 pan that way more of the rum syrup absorbs into the cake making the whole cake moist and filled with rum!!

I've made this now twice, great recipe. I only adjusted the glaze as I found it a little strong the first time. So instead of 1/2 cup, I made it 1/4 cup. Plus instead of the dark rum, I've used the Malibu coconut flavoured rum.

This was one of the best things I have baked in a while! The only thing I did was add a teaspoon of vanilla, and use a little less nuts than it asked for. Otherwise I did everything exactly the same. Everyone loved the cake. I will be making this again no doubt.

Very good!!  I used an Aldi brand cake mix, skipped the vanilla pudding mix, and substituted melted butter for the oil.  I also used a little over half a cup of rum in the cake and added milk (instead of water) to make a full cup of liquid.

Excellent!  Used shortening on pan and dusted with sugar. Used Sailor Jerry Spiced Rum.  Poked holes while still in the pan.  Ran a knife along outside and center.  Poured glaze on and let it sit for about 10 minutes before taking out of pan.  Came out beautiful and delicious.  It's a keeper!

Love this recipe, it is quick and easy I get many repete request for this cake. I change it up a bit from time to time, I use triple sec in the cake, I also add real vanilla and use white cake instead of yellow. For the glaze I change it up as well I have used many different liquors tonight is used raspberry vodka. It is amazing! Do not be afraid change it up....experiment. Last but not least I cover the top with confectioners sugar. Yummmmm.

I adapted this recipe tonight in an attempt to use up odds and ends in my kitchen and I'm VERY happy with the results.  I used a spice cake mix instead of a yellow one and I substituted Brandy for the Rum.  It turned out moist and perfect!

I've made this cake a number of times it's always been a classic favorite, but today instead ofa yellow cake and vanilla pudding, I used a French vanilla cake mix with French vanilla pudding,  plus I put a splash of vanilla extract into the  glaze and it turned out better than ever.

I made this cake today, WOW, a real keeper.  I used Appleton Estates Rum, and loved it, wouldn't use anything else.  I did add cherries to the top with the walnuts  just a different look I was after.  I also poked holes in the bottom and poured gently and slowly over about 10 minutes the sauce into the bottom if the cake, then inverted the cake onto a plate and poured the sauce over the top.  I did keep some aside so I could add it to the cut slices when served.  I WILL make this cake at Christmas time and give away as presents, a true keeper

OMG it is the best.  I used pecans instead of walnuts only because I prefer the taste and I do that with all recipes that call for walnuts.

I liked the recipe because my mom used to make this for me when I was younger but I think the recipe could of turned out better if I had remembered to poke holes in the cake for the glaze to run through. It still turned out good though.

I have used this recipe or one similar for years, I learned from my mom who got it from the Bicardi's web site.  However, mom tweeked it quite a bit, she used the butter recipe cake mix DH or BC and of course she used butter and milk instead of oil and water.  It is the best cake I also used the Bicardi's or Captain Morgan's spiced rum which gives you a different flavor.

I found this in 2008 & my husband has asked me every year since to make at least one around Thanksgiving. I use a cake mix with pudding in the mix (and still add the little box). I do have to omit the walnuts, but I did try macadamia nuts once in place and it was great! Wonderful with or without nuts!

Has anyone experienced  their cake shrinking about 10 min after taking it out of the oven? I looked this up online and I saw that it happens when you use Duncan  Hines box mix only. I'm trying it again today with Pillsbury  to see how it comes out

Excellent!  I always follow the recipe first and then make changes on the second attempt if I feel they're needed.  I had a bit of trouble getting the cake to absorb all of the glaze and I will follow some of the suggestions about that next time but I think the recipe is great as it is.  I used Myers Dark Rum for both the cake and glaze and I might try a different rum for the glaze next time just to see how the contrast would work.

I have made this cake twice now. The first time I made a mistake and put two boxes of pudding in instead of one. this time around I made the recipe with just one and I actually think I like it better with two... Both times the cake was moist and delicious so no complaints here. This is an excellent recipe

I have made this cake several times now and just bought more rum today to make more. Everyone loves it. By adding the glaze the way you suggested; it soaked it up like a sponge!!! The only thing was that the nuts don't seem to show up like they did in your picture. Thanks for sharing.

Way too much rum people! I think a third of the amount in the glaze would totally suffice. I was disappointed that all I could taste was rum, not cake.

Wonder and moist. Very easy too. I used rum extract for the glaze because I ran out of rum but have made it both ways. It is just a great cake and tastes great either way. I also did not have a bundt pan so I used a ceramic serving bowl. It was beautiful! I don't think you can go wrong with this one!

This recipe is delicious! I kept with the water instead of using milk because I have a very lactose intolerant family, so I try to cut back on as much dairy as I can. I also made a few changes, used coconut pudding instead of the vanilla pudding and I used Myers dark rum for the cake and glaze. Neither of the changes effected the flavor and everyone agreed it was the best they had ever had.

I used pineapple cake mix, coconut pudding, Goslings black rum, skim milk instead of water, and 3/4 granulated sugar 1/4 light brown sugar. Like some others I mixed in the rum about a minute early with the glaze to burn off some of the alcohol. Also put a dash of vanilla in the batter and the glaze. Turned up great. 

Will try it with yellow, lemon, and coconut cake.

Only goes this cake is amazing not one you want to make all the time though because it is far from being at all good for you...everyone always loves it though... I used lite rum because that is all I had and it still turned out great.... Next time I will follow the advice of the other reviewers and poke holes in the cake pour half the glaze in the pan and let it soak in... Great recipe thanks

My cake didn't soak up all the glaze.  I think next time I'll poke some holes in it.  It's awesome with vanilla ice cream!

OH MAN! This was fantastic! I poured the glaze on the underside of the hot cake (after pricking with a skewer) as others have suggested, and added a little straight rum to the top once it was cooled and flipped. Perfect amount of rum flavor!

So good! I made it the day b/f our Christmas party and the smell was wonderful!!! Reminds me so much of the little rum cakes you can pick up in Grand Cayman (our honeymoon). The cake was gone!!! So yummy-I will definitely make this again.

I didn't get to taste this cake. My husband brought it in to his office, and there were no leftovers for him to bring home to me! Based on that, I'd say it was a hit. It smelled delicious and looked beautiful. The downside was the last part of making it. I didn't pour it into the bundt pan, as recommended, and it took a very long time for me to pour the glaze/sauce over the cake and let it soak in. Next time, I will try pouring into the bundt pan to soak.

WOW! The best cake I've ever tasted! Cook the rum w/ the glaze ingredients. Cooks the alcohol out but leaves the flavor.  This cake is insanely delicious.

This recipe was very good. I used Bacardi Dark Rum for the cake and Appleton Estates for the glaze (as another user suggested) and that worked very well. I poked holes in it with a skewer and did the whole pour half the glaze in the bundt pan flip it over and pour other half on top. Maybe I did something wrong, but I wish the glaze had penetrated more evenly throughout the cake. Cake was delicious, received many compliments.

Cake came out great, received good reviews from family.  I made this cake without the nuts and glaze as I was trying to make a cake to look like a donut with white frosting and sprinkles.  Very yummy, moist and easy.  Will use again, and again.

I made this cake for 4th of July.  Used others comments and used the Barcadi 8 year in the cake.  For the glaze, I used half of the Bacardi that I put in the pan, and half vanilla rum that I added after heating the glaze.  7 adults devoured this thing within a couple of hours.  Great tip on using the Bundt pan to soak up the glaze.

I followed others' suggestions for adding coconut , selecting rums for batter and sauce, and pan "bottom" soaking technique.  Came out incredibly moist and flavorful, but just too boozy for us.    Next time I will cut rum in half for sauce and simply pour over top of cake (after poking holes in top) while in bundt pan.   I am also going to experiment with baking this as a pinapple upside down-coconut-rum cake (adding brown sugar and nuts and pineapple slices on bottom of pan)   I think it will be more to our taste.

This is the best Rum Cake I have ever had!! I have made this for several different occasions and every time has received great compliments! I cherish this recipe!! I love taste the day after it has been made! I took the advice and poured the glaze into the bundt pan then placed the cake back in it to absorb the glaze!!! SOOOOOOOOO YUMMY!!!

Wow! Dee-licious! Everyone loved this rum cake, and I will definitely be making this again! (Especially now that I have a huge bottle of rum with barely a dent from this recipe!) The morning after the glazing, and the am of the event, I thought the finished product looked kinda funny, like an enormous glazed doughnut.. So I just sprinkled a little white sugar over it to make it look pretty and plopped it onto a plate over some green Easter grass (it was for an Easter celebration.) It was a hit and my boyfriend had two slices of the leftovers, which there was not much left.. We had a wide array of Easter desserts to pick from that day =)

Came out delicious!  Two changes I made (I had to improvise with what I had on hand).  I used white rum and a small drop of almond extract in place of the rum in the glaze (this was personal preference).  Really moist and delicious cake.  Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome! The cake was very moist when I followed the recipe exactly. However, I wanted to reduce oil and sugar, and it was less moist but perfectly fine. I actually liked it better that way.   Sometimes, I substituted water by milk (as other reviewers suggested), and it was not much different.. so to me, milk or water.. doesn't matter.   Also, a friend of mine actually ate this cake with toasted almond ice cream and liked it a lot. You guys can try that. I've never tried it, so I have no comments for that. ;)  I have made this cake many times now because everybody loved it and kept requesting for more. I think it's a great recipe to bring to a family/ friend gathering...

Took this cake to work and it was a huge hit, especially with the guys.  The rum in the glaze was a bit strong for my taste and I only used about half the amount of glaze.  I substituted pecans for the walnuts.  I will try making the glaze with 1/4 c. rum next time.

Awesome cake! Was moist and delicious! Used hardly any walnuts because we just don't really care for them. Used Bacardi Select for both the cake and glaze. Will definitely make again and again!

I am rating this cake without having been able to taste it.  I made it for my husband to take to work, but he assured me that it was so delicious.  I guess his having to eat 3 pieces (even though he is cutting down) speaks for itself!!!  I did make a few changes.  Used Pecans instead of walnuts, used 1/2 cup of milk instead of water, applesauce instead of the oil and used white rum instead of dark.  Other than the applesauce which I always use instead of oil, the other changes were simply made due to my own pantry stock.

I make this every Christmas and always get compliments!  It is a wonderful recipe and not all of the glaze needs to be used to make a great cake.  I often use just half the amount of the glaze and it still has a nice rum flavor.

I tried the butterscotch pudding variation and it is wonderful! I only boiled the glaze for about 3 minutes and it seemed to be the right consistency. Also, I only had 1/2 c of walnuts on hand, so I used 1/2 c of chopped pecans as well. Turned out great!

Not quite what I wanted.  I like to pour the sauce in the bundt pan before inverting but the cake collapsed.  Maybe the recipe, maybe me but I never had that happen before.

Perfect. I will use this recipe every time I make a rum cake. It's rummy but not too much. I used coconut rum and pudding mix, but I won't next time. Can't notice any coconut flavor. Also didn't risk messing up the cake by flipping it out of the pan to pour some glaze in, then putting it back in the pan. Instead, I used a bamboo skewer to poke deep holes all over, then poured the glaze over the cake. The cake soaked up all the glaze. I let it sit for 2 days before serving as some reviewers recommended. So glad I did. Thanks for sharing this very impressive recipe.

THIS IS THE BEST CAKE EVER!  It's a holiday favorite for us, but my husband also requests it for his birthday in April.  It's even better the second day when the rum soaks in.  SOOOO YUMMY!!!  "You know what this cake needs?  BOOZE."  -Jim Gaffigan  :-)

This cake was great! The only thing I did differently was use white Jamaican rum in the batter,and for the glaze I used a dark Jamaican brandy. But absolutely no changes required, this was super moist,tasty,and the hit at any occasion.

So moist and delicious.  I'm personally not a big fan of rum but I do love rumcake.  So this recipe ended up a bit too strong with the 1/2 cup of rum in the topping.  Next time I'll try to make some kind of sugar glaze to replace the topping as the cake itself was delicious

What a heavenly cake! I brought this cake to my office and they all love it! They keep asking me to bring another, and another...  Glad to know this recipe.  I also love the glazing idea of Ms. Jackie Smith, pour half of the glaze to the bundt pan, reinsert cake back to bundt, and pour the remaining glaze over the cake.  Her idea saves a lot of time.

Maybe a little less rum....its fairly strong and due to all the moisture, it won't last long.

There is only one word for this rum cake....fantastic!  It had such great flavor and we ate almost all of it in one setting!  The only downfall my cake had was because of me.  I'm not used to my oven yet and I overcooked it a bit.  It was dry but I poked holes in it for the glaze to soak into.  It didn't work all that well, but I will cook it again for the right amount of time for my oven, and I KNOW it will be out of this world.  Kudos to the cook who posted this lovely recipe!

I've made this recipe so many times!  I've always used Bacardi dark rum.  My friends can't get enough of this cake.  We love rum and I've added more than what the recipe calls for. It never lasts more than a day.  I've done as the others suggested.  Poke holes in the bottom of the cake and pour the glaze in.  Let it soak and turn out and soak the cake some more!

Yum.  Used 151 in the batter and regular white rum for the glaze.  It packs a wallop, and is delicious!

I made this yesterday and it turned out wonderfully! I changed out the walnuts for pecans since my mother in law is allergic but followed the recipe to the letter.

I just made this again today. I doubled the recipe: one in a bundt pan and 12 in mini bundt pans.  I baked the minis for 17-20 minutes. I've made this for the last 2 years now and always used light rum because that's all I had.  It's just fantastic.  I used dark pans and had to lower the temp to 300.  The first time I made it, I forgot to lower the temp and didn't watch the cake too closely, so the cake was a little dry, but now, I think or rather, hope, I've mastered it.  Thank you so much for a delicious recipe.

Fantastic cake.  I did like some of the other reviewers and pour half of the glaze in the pan and replace the cake (after I gave it a good once or twice over with a toothpick).  I also reduced the walnuts by half and it was perfect.  I had no problems leaving the cake in the pan overnight--it came out intact and looking beautiful.

Great recipe...I made it for the holidays and everyone loved it. The icing is so good that I accidently spilled some on the table while I was pouring it over the cake and my husband and I were scooping it up with our fingers!

Wonderful cake! Sent it to my sister for Christmas and instructed her to save for when our parents arrived.  She called and said it would be lucky if there were any left by the time they arrived.

My husbands favorite cake is rum cake so I was a little worried since this was the first time I ever made it.  OMG!  He took one bite and said this was the best cake he ever had by far.  I have also been informed it is to become a holiday staple (Thanksgiveing, Christmas, Easter, his birthday, etc.).  I used Bacardi select rum and thought the flavor was perfect and I also reduced the amounbt of walnuts as other reviewers suggested.  Thanks so much for the great, easy recipe!  Definitely a keeper!

I loved this recipe. I used rum extract instead of rum adding butter to the mix and an extra 1/2 cup of water to the glaze with 2 tbsp of rum extract in the mix and in the glaze. I also used the same recipe but I swapped lemon extract for the rum extract and it was also great. The cake was moist and really pretty. Thanks, this is my new favorite cake to make. It was so easy.

This is simply the best. For a little fun, I used Captain Morgan spiced rum.  Put a little Captain in your bundt cake!!!!  You will have Uncle Dave swinging from the crow's nest. No thick dark rum for this kid, let the Captain spice it up.

Nice and rummy.  I followed the advice of others and used milk instead of water.  I used Bacardi Select for both cake and glaze. and poured glaze into bundt pan and inverted.  This seemed a little wet, but I don't mind drinking my cake.

Never had a rum cake before, not even a huge rum fan - but tried this recipe based on the reviews. 
DELICIOUS. 
I made it with variations recommended here (Sift dry ingredients, sub milk for water).  I used Appleton's rum for both cake and glaze. Turned out perfect.  Only issue I will need to watch next time is that I set the timer for the full 60 minutes; checked it at 57 and it was a bit dark.  Still tastes wonderful, and is moist as ever, just a bit darker than I would like - so I'll be more vigilant of watching more closely during the baking. 
All in all - new favorite cake... will definitely make again.

I made two of these for the Holidays.  It was awesome.  Everyone loved it. I then made it again for my co-workers and they raved about it.  I must admit that I put a little more rum than the receipe called for.

This was a great recipe! I used slivered almonds. My only complaints are that it is quite crumbly and has an extremely strong rum taste. I generally love rum ;) but this was strong even for me. I may cut back on the rum and add some almond extract, but overall this was a yummy recipe. My family all seemed to really enjoy it!

The cake itself was delicious, but I also did not care for the glaze. It was gooey, messy to work with, and was heavy with rum flavor. Putting the glaze on  made the cake sticky and added too much rum flavor. If I make this cake again, I will not be making the glaze.

Really good. I tried the lighter rum and found myself wishing it were rummier. Good texture and flavor overall. Good but not knock your socks off great-although some people at my party really loved it.

Fantastic.  I used coconut rum that was 50 proof.  Still turned out great.  I just added two good handfuls of coconut to the batter.  Baked for 50 min and it was great.  Took another's advice and poured 1/2 the glaze into bottom of pan and put cake (with holes poked in top) back down.  Then put more glaze on the bottom (more holes poked).  I then make a vanilla glaze and poured over the top after it cooled.  Just really really good.

OMG!  This is a wonderful recipe.  Everyone loved it! I used Appleton's Estate Rum for the cake and the icing.  My husband, who is a big chocolate fan, says this is one of his top favorites.

I made this for my brother's 21st birthday.  Strong rum flavor, so you may want to add a bit less to the cake batter itself.  The glaze is what gives it the five stars!

I just made this cake last night to bring to work. It was very easy to make and super moist. I got rave reviews over it and definetely the most moist cake I have ever made. I used Appletone Estates Rum as others have mentioned and it gave it a little exta added oomph. I am not a nut person at all, but they were a great addition. Great cake. I will make this many more times. Thanks for sharing!

TOTALLY AWESOME!  Was the moistest cake I've ever made.  I usually don't have a lot of luck with bundt cakes, but this one was so easy.  A GREAT and easy cake to make that everyone will think you slaved for hours over!

i followed the receipe exactly and the cake came out perfect!  it was moist, not too sweet, with just enough rum to make everyone smile.  i used the Appleton Estates (which I found at Jewel) and i did like the sweeter taste.  i followed other reviewers' advice and let the cake cool, removed it from the cake pan, filled the bottom with some of the glaze, then realigned the cake in the pan.  i let it sit for about an hour and when it was time for dessert, the cake had darkened to a beautiful brown and smelled wonderful.  everyone loved it.  thank you!

This cake is great, I have made it several times and it's always a hit.  I followed the suggestions of others and poked holes in the cake and poured most of the rum mixture over the cake while it was still in the pan.  Then I turned the cake onto a plate and poured the rest over the top.  I put the cake back in the pan, covered the pan with a plate and let the rum mixture soak into the cake for a couple of hours.  It was great, really moist.

Proceed with caution - you will want to eat this entire cake yourself! My first rum cake and so so easy! I left out the walnuts (don't care for nuts) and didn't miss anything. Plus it was so fun to make. I love pouring on the rum and watching the cake start to turn golden brown. I took the advice of one reviewer and poked holes in the top of the cake so the rum would absorb well. Worked perfectly and looked professional. Wish it wasn't gone already....

Made this recipe for a lunch with my girlfriends.  Modified the recipe following one reviewer's suggestions of using Appleton Estates rum for the glaze, and I also used coconut cream pudding instead of vanilla.  Poured glaze into bundt pan (after removing cake) and replaced cake, then basted bottom.  VERY tasty!

I chose this recipe based on what was in my pantry so I had to substitue alot! I am sure the original recipe is much better than the one I made. I didn't have instant pudding so I used the recipe for Homemade Vanilla Pudding and didn't put the water in the cake batter to help make up for using actual pudding instead of pudding mix. I used pecans instead of walnuts. And I had bourbon so I used that instead of rum. We ate it hot out of the oven and the bourbon was REALLY strong!! But I had some the next day after letting it sit overnight in the refridgerator and it was much better. I probably shouldn't put the full amount of bourbon. It would probably be better with 1/4 cup for the glaze. I also don't have a bundt pan so I used a 13x9 and cut the time back to about 30 min. The way I made this wasn't ideal but I wanted to assure anyone who needs to substitute like I had to, this will still be really good!!

So moist and delicious. I sprinkled some shopped walnuts in the bottom of the bundt pan before pouring in the batter. MMMMMMM, so good.

Didn't have a Yellow cake mix so used white and then used white chocolate pudding pack. Came out pretty good. For me though it tasted better a day or two AFTER putting rum glaze on top then trying to eat it that night. Will make again.

I made this cake for friends as a Christmas present and I couldnt stop eating the shavings I cut off the bottom to make the cake sit flat!  I soaked the spare pieces in the glaze and it was simply divine!  Great presentation in a decorative bundt pan, especially with the nuts on top!  Definitely try this recipe its great!

Oh this is definitely good cake!!! I'm not a fan of rum at all but gave it a try. I let it sit a couple of days for all the alcohol to evaporate and was it ever MMM-MMM good!!! I took Tahna's advice on soaking the cake rather than basting and it was all so easy. I let the cake sit at room temperature. It is a moist and flavorful cake! Definitely a regular from now on! Thanks Jackie! =:)

It definitely didn't taste like cake mix, which is a plus.  I used Appleton Estate for the rum in the cake and glaze and followed the recipe exactly. The butter rum glaze was a bit strong as the rum wasn't cooked into the glaze. Next time, I'll use rum extract of something similar to get rid of the alcoholic bite. A hardcore rum cake baker said that this was amazing anyway.

Excellent cake, but I did make some changes.  Instead of walnuts, I used pecans and in the glaze, I didn't put any rum (already had a major rum taste as it is), instead I put a few tsp's of vanilla.  Came out great!  :)

I dont know what went wrong. I followed the recipe exactly. The pecans on the bottom burnt to crisp, so i had to remove the whole top of the cake. Maybe it was the pan i used (my grandmothers).
The texture is great and i agree that its taste much better the next day.
I was a little dissapointed with the whole experience.I was hoping for a cake similar to the picture posted.
I wonder would it be better with a pound cake batter instead. I think I will try it again, because I am no quitter.
I will try a differnt pan or try a cream cheese pound cake batter.

This recipe is exactly like my Nana's. I make this every Christmas. The cake is so moist, it's even better the next day when the glaze really gets absorbed. A wonderful recipe!

This was the first recipe that I followed step by step and did not have any problems with, even down to the baking time.  My husband shared with his coworkers and they all loved it!

This is my second attempt at a rum cake. I must say, this is truly a keeper.  The cake was supermoist.  It did fall apart a bit when I tried to take it out so that I could add the glaze.  I will definitely make again real soon:)

My friend made this for me as a birthday cake. She used raspberry rum and double the pecans! It was soooo good - moist and delicious! I don't know how long it can keep at room temperature, but it kept getting better and better till the fifth day, when it was all gone. :)

Too much rum. I followed it step by step by what the recipie said, and I usually never do that. Not bad considering. I would add less rum and less walnuts to it though.

I made this cake for my boyfriend (who absolutely loves rum) and it turned out great! His only complaint was that there was a bit of an after taste - next time, I won't use quite as much rum in the glaze. Overall, great though and fairly easy to make !

Loved this cake! I am not a fan of rum cake, but this one is delicious! I used half the glaze, which was plenty, and glazed it as suggested by reinserting the cake back into the pan. Thank you!

I love this cake.  I make it all the time for friends birthdays and any other get together.  I don't use the nuts and I also poke holes in the bottom of the cake and brush some of the glaze on before I take it out of the pan.  I also will make the cake a few days before eating it then it is not as strong.

Very Rummy tasting! Used Meyers Dark Rum for the cake and glaze and it turned out just fine. I used the poke holes and soak method, which really helped the cake to absorb the glaze. It was truly delicious!

Very good recipe! Husband loved the cake, even though I'm not to big on cake.Very moist,color was lovely and the nuts added texture. Although i could not eat more than one piece, i was planning on doing some driving(do not drink and drive).The rum really added some ufffffff!My husband ate piece after piece and had a headache afterwards. This is really the cake that you take to a party. Will make again.

Awesome recipe! My husband and sons (ages 16, 13 and 8) LOVED it!   It was very moist and had just the right hint of rum flavor.  The only changes I made were to boil the 1/2 cup of rum for the glaze for a couple of minutes as some reviewers suggested instead of adding it to the end and I omitted the nuts due to personal preference.  It came out PERFECT.  Will DEFINITELY make this one again.  Oh, and adding the glaze to the pan after turning out the cake and then poking holes in the bottom to pour the rest of the glaze over worked like a charm!!

This cake is so good.  The same recipe was on my box of "butter pecan" cake mix, so I used that instead of the yellow cake, I also did not add the nuts.  I did not make the glaze; I'm sure it would be even better if I had.

I'm 76 years old, is was my first effort EVER at baking, and I couldn't have picked a better one to start with. It's a total winner!  Rummy is right. Delicious, easy, and if you make a little extra of the glaze and heat it up and pour a bit on each slice of cake as you serve it, you'll receive sighs of delight from your family and friends.  Thanks you Jackie Smith wherever you are and Thank you all recipes.

This was so buttery and delicious. I didn't have a bundt pan, so I put it in two separate bread pans, and it turned out wonderfully! I plan on taking this to my next dinner party.

I am giving this 4 stars only because the rum glaze was quite strong.  People seemed to like the cake, but I think if I cut back a bit on the rum, it will be taste a little better.

I made this to have an extra cake on Christmas.  Everyone loved it.  I love that it actually still tasted like Rum.  I would use 1/2 the amount of walnuts next time.  Also, there was WAY too much glaze.  I would cut that at least in half.  I only used less that half or my cake would have been soaked.

Read several reviews and followed suggestions: ie, use milk instead of water in cake.  Used toasted pecans in my buttered Bundt pan, 'dusted' with sugar.  Used 1/4 c of rum in cooking the glaze and then added the 2nd 1/4 cup of rum.  Not too rummy.  Very moist and tasty.  The only thing is I had purchased my Rum before I found the recipe, so I used Bacardi light Rum and since I have no idea about Rum other than to bake with it, I don't know if the light is milder or what.  ANYHOO!  It is good and a definite repeat and a keeper.

The best thing about this cake is the ease b/c it starts w/a box mix.  Love that!!!  Two things I need... some idea of how long to cook the glaze b/c it never really "glazed" on my finished cake.  The other, some idea of how u get a hot cake back in the pan w/the glaze.  I never worked that out and the cake was no where near as saturated w/the rum glaze as I had hoped.  It was a nice moist cake tho, but the rum part was hit and miss.  I'll do better next time.  I used a Wilton Bavarian cake pan, so it was quite stunning, but small cake.

Just fixed this for Christmas weekend.  Hope it lasts even till tomorrow, it is so good, can't stop eating it. Used a regular tube pan since I don't have a good bundt pan.  Turned out perfect.  Did as others suggested-put glaze on the top before getting it out of the pan, let soak in, then inverted on plate, finished glazing it.  Better than regular pound cake anyday!

Never made rum cake before and this was a breeze.  I did cut rum in glaze to 1/4 cup and was still really strong. Also poured glaze down the sides of the cake pan then on the bottom and let sit for several hours. Added vanilla and cinnamon to batter.  Coworkers raved about it. Will make again but will reduce rum some more.

YUMMM is all that I have to say!  This recipe was delicious!  If you love rum cake then you will love this.  I did as other users recommended and took the cake out of the pan added some of the rum syrup and put the cake back in the pan to soak up the juices.The only changes that I made were that I added vanilla extract to the cake mix as well as the syrup mixture.  I actually made this for a bake sale at work.  (Sold each piece for 1.50 and sold out I might add).  Some commented that it was a very strong rum taste.  But I like it that way.  This recipe is not for a non-drinker so beware!  But if you love rum cake, then you will love this recipe!

I made this for my family--my dad is allergic to walnuts, so I substituted pecans.  Also, I used coconut flavored pudding instead of vanilla. The cake was absolutely amazing--my brother thought it was even better than the ones we bought from the Cayman Islands!

Absolutely terrific. For the person who ask, it freeze well too! Although, I made the mistake of trying to make muffin batches out of it the second time around and left it in the oven too long. Came out on the spongy side... but I'm sure that was completely my fault.

This cake was so good. I added a little more rum to the cake. I made it last night and it is almost gone! I tasted it a little to soon at first I think. You should let it sit for a couple of hours before you serve it to let all the flavors from the glaze seep in.If you don't, the rum taste is a bit overwhelming. I'm glad I went to try it again!

Given the fact that I only make cakes from scratch, I LOVED this recipe.  Great Rum flavor.  Nice glaze.  Easy to make.  My husband gave it the thumbs up.

Very yummy, very moist, very flavorable.  The only change I made was using Bicardi Superior and only 1/3 cup in the glaze, and it turned out fantastic.

I made this cake last night... and trust me I'm not a baker and it came out fabulous.  I used Bacardi Superior (I think that is what it's called - it's darker then their Gold) and pecans as other reviewers suggested.  I also used a Betty Crocker Super Moist Yellow cake mix and a generic instant pudding (surprisingly there was no Jell-O brand vanilla). I used the authors method of applying the glaze... 

The cake was super moist and had a very nice rum flavor.  I have not tried it since last night, so I can't say how it'll taste today, but I brought into work and I expect rave reviews.  This is so easy to make...  Great to take to any get together or party.

This cake was super rummmy tasting, but everybody loved it. I got asked for the recipe from a few people. My husband who isn't a big cake eater loved it and wanted me to make more. I took Jackie's advice how to glaze it at the top of the recipe. It worked out great.

This recipe is almost exactly like the one my aunt is famous for.  However, I use pecans for a sweeter flavor.  Also, pour the hot glaze over the hot cake while it's still in the pan.  Allow it to sit in the pan for 30 minutes and then invert to a serving plate. Sooooooooooooo good.

This cake is really good.  I only use 1/2 of the rum in both the cake and glaze.  If not I thought the rum was too overpowering. Thanks for the great recipie! I make it every Christmas.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and my family went wild over it.  Several people requested it as their Christmas gift!  I used a coconut cake mix and coconut flavored pudding, but besides that, followed the recipe exactly.  You will not be disappointed in this cake!

As I sit here typing, I am currently baking another cake!  I made the first one two days ago -using pineapple cake mix and Bacardi dark rum.  It was yummy!  I split the mix into two 6" pans and made one without nuts.  I didn't have walnuts so I used crushed peanuts - not the best idea.  I used the recommended glazing method for the nut cake and just brushed the glaze onto the one without.  At first the rum taste was so strong on the "dipped" one, that I had to go lie down after  constantly tasting the glaze as I poured. But by the next morning the rum flavor had fused with the cakes and they were both delicious. My family couldn't stop snacking on them these past two days and they are now all gone!  I am doing it again right now, but only I used chocolate cake and WALNUTS!  It smells divine, and I can't wait to get at it!  Great recipe!

I've made this cake several times and it has always gotten rave reviews from family and friends.  I do cook the rum for the glaze for one minute before putting it on the cake.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

Should have read the previous reviews and cooked the rum with the glaze.  I made the recipe exactly, and the rum flavor was overwhelming!  Still, the recipe overall is great; just needs a bit of tweaking.

OK this one is AMAZING!  I swear and I have never been good at baking and this one made me look like a pro!  I just baked my second, only this time I wanted to see how it would be if I substituted spiced cake mix for the yellow cake mix.  A small piece just "happened" to fall off the bottom and it tasted very good.

I have been making this recipe for years. Very moist, delicious and easy. I made a few substitutions. I used Malibu Rum for an interesting twist. I baked them in 6 small loaf pans for easy gift giving. Topped them with a chocolate glaze (4oz semi-sweet chocolate & 1 tsp of shortning melted),shredded coconut and a cherry for presentation. Will continue to make for years to come.

Followed recipe as is, except I decided to use banana rum, instead of dark rum. My company went, well, "bananas" over it!  The rum flavor was just right for us, not overpowering as some have suggested.  Also, the whole presentation with the glaze and walnuts looked like I bought it at a fancy bakery...  I'm gonna try Malibu rum and toasted coconuts (instead of walnuts) next time!
Thanks, Jackie!

This cake came out pretty good. I thought I wouldn't like the nuts in the bottom but I was wrong about that. I cooked the rum with the glaze and I put the cake in the fridge for two days before cutting it. I will surely be making this cake again and again. Thanks a bunch!

This turned out perfectly.  I followed directions exactly except I cooked the glaze first.  Added the rum, brushed on the first time and then recooked glaze.  This gave it enough of a rum taste but it was not as overpowering as some readers suggested.  It was a beautiful presentation and I enjoyed serving it but not as much as the guests enjoyed eating it I think.

I have made this recipe for years - but I too used pecans instead of walnuts.  I always get raves when I make it.  However, I could never get the glaze just right.  Thanks so much for that tip!

I made two of these on Saturday morning, one for myself and one for my mom. We both loved it. my kids ate a piece and said it was a little strong for their taste. I went out to run some errands for a party I was having and when I got back, most of the guests were already there telling how delicious the cake was and three people asked for the recipe. (little did they know it was not intended for the party!) But I had a little bit left over and I stuck it in the fridge. The next day the kids and I ate it and it was even better. They said they could not taste the alcohol so strongly by the next day. It was really good and I plan to make it again.

This is a GREAT cake.  I added an extra glaze on top that I made with 1 cup of powdered sugar, 1 tbsp melted butter, 1 tbsp rum and water (enough to make this runny) which I then poured over the cake and spread evenly.  Too much rum for the kids though, but that just leaves more for ME!
