I was out of dressing and had some avocados I needed to use, so I found this recipe! I didn't have a few of the items so I substituted mayo for sour cream, red wine vinegar for lemon juice, and feta cheese for cottage cheese. The only problem I ran into was it wasn't creamy enough for the blender to blend so I added a little bit of water and milk (if I'd have thought of it first I just would've added milk). I just finished my salad, it was deelicious!!

I used Feta cheese instead of Blue Cheese for this and chopped a bit of an onion instead of using onion salt. This was good, but at first the consistency was more that of a dip no matter how much I blended it, so I had to add milk.   I tasted it after adding a tiny bit, and decided that I would use it as a dip after all, instead of a dressing because I didn't think it'd taste good on my regular garden salad.  Would be great for a taco salad, though!

I found this recipe too thick to blend in a blender...I added some vanilla yogurt to thin it down and it was still too thick for salad dressing.  The flavor was ok.  I will probably not make this again.

I like avocados and I like blue cheese.  But I was disappointed with the recipe because I felt that the taste of the blue cheese completely overpowered the avocado. I'm glad I just sprinkled the blue cheese on my salad because I enjoyed the remaining dressing much better as a dip with tortilla chips.  I'd make this again in dip form without the blue cheese.

Fabulous dressing! I did decrease the blue cheese to 1/4 of a cup, but only since I knew some of my kids don't like blue cheese much. They gobbled this dressing right up! So delicious! I added a few TBSP of milk to thin it a bit, but this dressing is also delicious without any changes. Thank you!

Excellent recipe!  Left out the cottage cheese because we don't keep it around and I didn't want to buy a whole pint just for this recipe.  We didn't miss it as the recipe still turned out amazing.  The one thing I found though was that "makes 8 servings" is very true.  Perhaps even 10.  I wasn't paying attention to that and had way too much left over for just 4 people.  My bad.

I was looking for a regular blue cheese dressing recipe because I didn't want the ready-made dressing and I came across this recipe.  Since I'm trying to eat more healthy, I thought I give this a try especially because avocado is an ingredient.  I really like this dressing.  The only con to this dressing is that it's a little too thick particularly when it was in the blender.  I added a little milk to liquify the mixture.
