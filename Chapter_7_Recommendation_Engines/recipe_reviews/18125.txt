This recipe did not work out very well for me.  It seemed like there was way too much flour called for - I had a hard time working it all in and in the end the rolls were pretty tough and heavy.

These are good. Next time I will increase the sugar to 1/3 cup. I think the extra sweetness will make them even better. It was a cold morning so I let these rise in an oven preheated to 200 degrees then left the oven door adjar for a little while. They rose beautifully.

It never said to add sugar in with yeast mixture and I  almost didn't catch it so if you could just edit it that would be great. i love that you can keep it in the fridge for a long time and it seems to have a good consistency.

As others have noted, the instructions missed the step of adding one tablespoon of sugar to the water and yeast. 

I recommend cutting the amount of salt in half, as a tablespoon made mine extremely salty.

These were super easy and turned out great. I only wish there was a note about how many rolls you were supposed to get or how to cut the dough into equal sizes, how far apart to put on greased pan. I was able to make some assumptions, and they ended up turning out great texture and flavor.
