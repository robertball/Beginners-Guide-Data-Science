This recipe was delicious.  I followed the directions and I made some changes to the ingredients that were required, it still turned out great. I omitted the chocolate chips and it was AWESOME!

this is a GREAT dessert recipe.  i made it and my boyfriend couldn't believe it was homemade.  it was my first true baking experience and a complete success.  i had requests from friends and family to make another and another.  my mother even requested one for her birthday instead of a cake.  a definite try for holidays or special occasions!

This is defreakinglicious!! Rich, it is, but really good! I made this for Thanksgiving dinner along with 2 pumpkin pies. This was a winner. The only problem I had was the filling over flowed and really made a mess. I used a 9" deep dish crust as stated. This is why I rated this with 4 stars. For taste it has earned 5 stars! I came across this recipe the day before Thanksgiving and just had to try it. Will make it again but will use an even bigger pie plate.

This pie was really good. My husband ate the whole pie by himself. It's also very good with butter scotch chips. I recomend it to anyone who likes pecan pie and cheese cake.

This pie is worth the effort and calories! Very rich. I subsituted almond extract for vanilla, as I often do in recipes.

I followed the recipe exactly - my husband hated this pie! As pretty as it was the taste was simply bad. The combination of cream cheese and corn syrup seemed exotic but tasted as it sounds.

This is an incredible pie. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone liked it better than any other pie. I omitted the choc chips and next time I will add an egg to the pecan pie mixture, but overall perfection!!

I had this pie in the oven for a total of 60 minutes and it still did not set. Every time I would take it out, thinking it was done, it would still be runny. I thought the flavors were good, but my husband said it was ruined with the chocolate chips. We will stick with traditional pecan pies.

Easy to make, not very sweet, maybe I should not have used the Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips. Probably will not make again.

Taste was pretty good but it just didn't look very good once it was cut into.  Make sure you chill the pie (preferably overnight) to ensure it sets all the way. I cut into this after being in the frig for six hours and it was somewhat runny. Perhaps this was the issue!

ok, I am one of those people that changes the recipe, but I didn't have any pecan so I substituted toasted chopped almonds and almond extract for the vanilla.  Oh my, I could have died and gone to heaven.  My family was happy cause now they want this AND pecan pie for the holidays.

I am well know for my pecan pies.  My father-in-law asked me to make a chocolate pecan one for him.  In doing so I came across this recipe.  I tried it.  I will not make it again.  My family did not like it.

This is how I've always made mine, except without the chocolate.  I'll have to try it with the addition of chocolate!
