Just picked purple hulls are the best. If you live in the south you can get them at local farmers market, road side stand or friend/family garden. Fresh tender baby okra pods are best. I leave out the sugar, baking soda and sub ham for bacon. Occasionally add some chopped onion to pot and top with chopped fresh ripe tomatoes/green tomato relish. Server with hot, buttermilk  cornbread(stone ground white cornmeal) and fried chicken or pork chops. Comfort food from childhood.

I alternated by leaving out the sugar and waited until the last 10 minutes to add the okra. I like mine to still be whole and with a little firmness. The smaller the okra the better. Goes well with pork loin, pork chops and cornbread!

Awesome flavor. Did not use okra, otherwise I followed the recipe. Fresh peas rule!

Almost gave it four stars because I only put a teaspoon of sugar in them and they were plenty sweet enough.  I didn't get to my greenhouse yesterday to pick my okra, so today they were 8 and 9 inches long.  They grow so fast here that they were still tender and flavorful so I used them.  This is my new favorite side dish.  My 96 year old father who compares all my cooking to his mom's said, "Hey, these are really good." and came back for seconds.  That's like winning the Pillsbury Cook-off.

I used fresh purple hull peas from my garden.  I also use more sugar, like 1/8 cup. This is VERY good.  I use Tony's more spice for the seasoning.  At times, I use a drop or two of liquid smoke.

I've had purple hull peas before and didn't like them. My in laws planted a huge garden this year and have a bumper crop of them. With much encouragement, I picked a mess and prepared them using this recipe, no changes. Yes, you guessed it, I love them! My mother -in-law is tickled pink, she didn't want to be the only one harvesting this crop! Thanks for the recipe:))

Used fresh purple hull peas bought at the farmers market. Followed the receipe exactly, except left out the okra - don't like slimy okra!  Peas were fantastic and yummy!  Served with cornbread, grilled pork loin roast, fried okra and fried tomatoes....yummy summertime vege dinner!

These are good, but need much more salt.  I used Splenda instead of sugar.

I did not put any okra in. I don't like it so the beans were great.

These were FANTASTIC!  I used fresh purple hull peas from the Farmer's Market and some leftover grilled chicken sausage (cut into pieces) in place of the bacon, as we didn't have any bacon.  I will definitely try with bacon next time - can't imagine how yummy that will be!   I only had to cook these for about 1 hour and 15 minutes (maybe because they were fresh?)  They came out perfect.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I didn't have any okra, and the only changes I made was doubling the sugar and soda.  Can you say DEE-LISH-US!  A very fresh tasting, slightly sweet dish that melted in our mouths.

I don't even like peas and this was delicious. I did not add okra but followed the recipe! Okra would have been a little too much for me. It was not visually appealing but the flavor was great.

Turned out really well. Next time I will skip the okra, I do not think it added anything to the dish.

I really liked these peas. I cut the recipe in half and used frozen whole okra just to see if the okra imparted some type of extra flavor. At the end I couldn't tell that the okra added anything, so next time I will omit it. The cooking time was only 1 hour. Definitely a keeper of a recipe!

These are delicious, the only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that the second time I made them, I used the okra. It ruined the peas for us, because of slime factor.

These were good.  I think though I am going to not put as much okra in next time.
