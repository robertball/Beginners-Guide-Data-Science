This recipes sounds really good and I was thinking of making it, but how many cups/lbs of tomatoes is equal to the 35 tomatoes.  Thanks

This is a sweet and spicy recipe.  I like it but need ideas on how to use it in other recipes.  I used 1/4 Tsp crushed red peppers because I didn't have any hot peppers.  Plenty of heat for me. I basically cut the recipe in half and made it a bit healthier by using Stevia & Sea salt.  Very tasty recipe.

This is very similar to an 100 year old recipe my Mom used to make, and I lost it.  Hers called for a few more green peppers, and another spice or two, but this is so close, I'm so glad I found this.  I made exactly as written, and I think this is wonderful.  I know people have their own tastes, but if you are going to make real chili sauce, go out and get what you need.  Dried ingredients aren't the same.  We use this on burgers, hot dogs, liverwurst, in meat loaf, and on top too.  My brother puts it on just about everything.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

Reminds me of my Grandmothers recipe I helped her make with fresh tomatoes from her garden when I was a child.  Wonderful with fresh cooked purple hull peas or baked in a meat loaf.
If you will blanch the tomatoes in boiling water for about a minute and then put in iced water, the tomatoe skin just slides off.

I still have my mother and grandmother's similar recipe for an English-style chili sauce that wasn't spicy. It calls for: a peck of tomatoes, peeled and cut fine; 2 quarts of onions (measured, I suspect, after peeling and quartering) ground in a (manual) meat grinder; 6 red or green bell peppers, also ground; 4 cups brown sugar; 4 tsp. salt; 3 heaping tsp. ground cinnamon; 1½ tsp. ground nutmeg; ½ box mixed whole spice (which would be about half of a 1.5 ounce jar of today's McCormick pickling spice) tied into cheesecloth; 1 scant tsp. ground black pepper; 1 cup cider vinegar. Cook 3 hours, very slowly, stirring often. To be canned in sterile jars. The end of August or early September is the recommended season (tomato season in the northern U.S.). Were I to make it these days, I think I'd reduce the brown sugar to 1 cup, and grind some seeded jalapenos and/or serranos into the mix. (I laugh now at the "scant tsp." of black pepper. So timid!)

When I was a kid my grandmother made chili sauce that was incredible. She passed away many years ago and I thought the recipe was gone forever. I tried this and from what I can remember it tasted exactly the same! I am so excited! Thank you for this recipe!

I returned from a vacation to a garden full of ripe tomatoes and wanted to do something different with them.  Based on reviews, I tried this Fresh Tomato Chili Sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Not sure what I expected, but I find it oddly sweet.   I am eager to try it in a recipe (meatloaf or chili soup) to see how it is when combined with other ingredients.   My husband loves it!  Once I've had a chance to try it in a recipe, I will edit my review.

We had excess tomatoes and sweet not so hot chilies (almost like small capsicum in flavour) from our garden. Found this recipe and it is amazing! Ours is not so hot as we didn’t add anything but our home grown chilies or rather capsicums (peppers) but it has an amazing fresh concentrated flavour of the tomatoes and chilies! Definitely will make it again.

Frost came early. What to do with a bazillion pulled tomatoes? So I made three gallons of juice and reserved a gallon for chili sauce. Followed recipe close but cut sugar in half. It still had plenty of sweet. Kind of knocks your head back like Frank's sauce but much better. Cooked for some hours to reduce. A gallon seems a good amount to start as I had no idea how much 35 tomatoes was. Besides all my tomatoes were different sizes and types.

Recipe was fantastic. We skimmed off as much liquid as we could during the cooking process as a personal preference for a thicker sauce. We canned it in 500ml jars and it made 5 jars. Seems like a lot of work for the amount you get but its worth it. If you like it hotter feel free to add more chillies. I know some folks found it a bit sweet, i think thats just a preference. Im not a sweets person myself but felt there was a great balance here. A great tangy zip. We follows the directions precisely.

Not enough ingredients.  There's no depth of flavor. Everything is masked by the 3 jalapeños.

Just finished making the Chili Sauce.  I had been looking for this for a few years and so happy to have found this one.  I's sure the recipe is fabulous as is, but because I didn't have all ingredients this called for, I made a few substitutions.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used 10 reg. cans of diced tomatoes.  I used  1/2 teas. ground cayenne pepper instead of the fresh chili peppers and added a couple of shakes of chili powder.  Last but not least I only had 1 red bell pepper on hand so added green peppers.  When almost ready to finish cooking I noticed that it wasn't as thick as I wanted so added 2 cans of tomato paste.  I have it in the caner right now, but did a taste test before.  It is delish!!  Thanks so much Jan for this recipe.  Next year I hope to make it from scratch.  :)  However, this was really easy.  I ended up with 7 pints of sauce.
