I used turkey sausage and lowfat milk. It wasn't as good as the "real-deal" would have been, I would guess. But was still very good and healthier. Loved using the evaporated milk, as it is so handy and has a richer flavor, IMO, than the lowfat milk we usually use.

Made a similar recipe once before and it turned out too salty. So for this recipe I used the lowest sodium sausage I could find and did not add any salt.  Turned out great. Not salty, at all.

This is the real deal! It turned out perfectly, even though I've never made sausage gravy before. Very hearty- a great comfort food.

My husband loves sausage gravy! I never make it because of the saturated fat content. Of so many receipes listed I chose this one as no butter or heavy milk. WOW! How delicious! A big hit here. I did add 1/2 tsp. of fresh ground pepper & used a low-fat sausage.  I will pass this one on & use again. Thankyou.

This is a easy recipe with great turn out. I love going out for breakfast but with 3 small boys I can eat this at home instead. I make no changes at all and it always turns out great.

This was good and easy, but I still prefer the recipe from Bob Evan's website.

This is a wonderful recipe.  My kids loved it.  The gravy is so rich  without adding any butter or oil. I also used low fat sausage and fat free evaporated milk.

My boyfriend and I love this recipe.  It is so easy to make!  I keep the ingredients on hand for a quick Sunday brunch.  We like to use spicy sausage and we decreased the flour to 5 tablespoons.

I used ground turkey that I spiced up to taste like breakfast sausage. I was kind of worried about the evaporated milk and the water but it turned out okay. I did not add the extra salt. There was one thing missing from this recipe and that's fat to brown the flour in. After I browned the meat, I drained it and then melted a couple tablespoons of butter in the hot skillet, then added the flour. I did not need all six tablespoons of flour. I think I still prefer using all milk instead of watered down evaporated milk. Even so, we ate all of this--no leftovers. My husband didn't even say anything about the turkey sausage!
