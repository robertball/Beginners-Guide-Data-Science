This was great. Instead of 3/4ths of beef and pork i just went with an even 1 lb of each. Tasty.

Daughter made it because she had to take a Bulgarian food for a school project.  Now it’s part of our family dinner rotation! Delicious

I used gluten-free flour and it was super yummy! I baked it 30 minutes and it wasn’t fully baked, but it was oooey goooey good!
