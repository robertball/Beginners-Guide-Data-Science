Ground Beef & Chopped Cabbage Haiku: "Reduced for 1 lb., (and used one can tomatoes.) Needs more seasoning."Gotta say that for the ease of prep (and I used a bag of coleslaw mix for the cabbage, making this even easier!) this was nice, comfort food. Had a bite while it was simmering and ended up adding probably 1/2 tsp. more Italian seasoning, along w/ 1/4 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. celery seed, and heavy s&p, as it was a bit lacking in flavor department. (We usually eat our cabbage moosh-mosh dishes w/ kielbasa rather than ground beef, which gives it more flavor, so this just kinda needed a kick. The other kick we gave it was some Sriracha sauce at the table.) Makes a ton, even though I dropped the meat to a pound and the tomatoes to one can, but the leftovers were equally as good, and I imagine that it would also freeze well too.

This was a satisfying meal, nothing fancy, but just good, old-fashioned, home-cooked food.  I did find it a bit little weak on flavor, so I did add more seasoning.  Enjoyed, and thanks for sharing your recipe.

12-4-2017  ~ I’ve turned out some pretty good things in the kitchen strictly with the purpose in mind of using limited ingredients at hand.  This was the case here.  I suppose I’m unusual for routinely going back and forth from our homes in Wisconsin and in Naples, FL with boxes of produce cleared out from the fridge that I don’t want to waste.  The particular head of cabbage I used for this dish today made the journey here twice, and I was determined NOT to pack it in a suitcase for the third time!  I started out by sautéing a few strips of chopped bacon, then cooked the onions in the bacon fat.  This, I knew, would add another dimension of flavor.  Not a fan of “Italian seasoning,” I seasoned it up with a couple of cloves of fresh minced garlic rather than garlic powder (had the garlic in the suitcase too), basil, oregano, Worcestershire sauce, and Montreal Steak Seasoning - and a couple extra globs of butter didn’t hurt either.  I added fresh mushrooms (yep, brought down here with me in the suitcase).  I eliminated the red pepper flakes, the added bite not being necessary for me.  This is simple, home cooked comfort food, good as is, but there’s nothing wrong with embellishing it a bit. I found this “Suitcase Supper” quite pleasant and very satisfying. Note:  Ideally I think this would be even better with the addition of some rice, but since I restrict carbs I restrained myself from that enticing option.

I made several changes! Instead of ground beef I used  ground chicken and "hot chicken" sausage, which gave this dish more flavor  and zip! Along with that I used one can each of hot and medium "Rotel" and one can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce! Also Kosher salt and pepper to taste! Everything else was as called for. Many comments on this recipe mentioned it being a little bland but with my changes it was excellent!

This was delicious. I don't measure my seasonings and I just add whatever seems will taste good. With that said I used thyme and herbs de Provence, black pepper and herbed salt along with Worcestershire sauce,  garlic, red and sweet onion, ground turkey instead of beef, shredded carrots, eggplant that I had leftover, cabbage, Rotel tomatoes with green chilies, a can of stewed tomatoes AND a can of white beans. We splashed on some hot sauce at the table and it was fantastic. Would make again and again.

I subbed 1 8oz can of tomato paste and a 6oz can of tomato sauce for the 15oz can of tomato sauce. When all done added two cups of cooked rice, let it simmer for 10 more minutes to absorb some of the liquid and it was ready. Very tasty. Also, I forgot to mention. I used 1lb ground  beef 8oz of Italian sausage for extra flavor.

very good and easy.  I had read the reviews so I made adjustments to add flavor.  I added: 1 beef bouillon cube, paprika, celery salt and red pepper.  It was a crowd pleaser.  Thanks for sharing :)

I really enjoy this dish! I’ve made it several times now, followed tips from others... more seasoning needed. I used 2T fresh minced garlic, 1T kosher salt, 1T Italian seasoning, 2t crushed red pepper. Also added 1t better than bouillon beef broth (blended in 1/4c hot water) to beef after browned.

I was thinking of making cabbage rolls this evening but remembered I had this recipe in my favs.  So glad, too because it was super easy and quick to make.  Just want to say that I am glad there are reviews that show what people do differently because it really helps to cater to the different tastes in my family.  So, on that note... I added mild Italian sausage with ground chicken and I use real garlic instead of the powder.  Added some shredded carrots and followed the rest of the recipe.  I love the idea of rice, but hubby doesn't, so I made that on the side for whoever wanted to add it.  I don't usually measure my seasonings, I add to taste and it turned out delicious.  Will definitely be making this again!

I made this tonight, but failed to read the other reviews - big mistake!  Even though I accidentally added extra Italian seasoning, it was very bland and the sauce was thin and watery.  I was expecting a thicker savory sauce.  I think maybe there should have been two cans of tomato sauce with one can of tomatoes, and maybe some tomato paste.  With the leftovers, I'm going to add some rice to thicken up the sauce and maybe some Worchestershire sauce, smoked paprika and more garlic to see if that helps.  I'd really thought this would be more like stuffed cabbage, but sauce is just way too watery and flavorless - it leaves an unappealing watery puddle when you spoon it over rice.  Sorry I couldn't be as generous as the other reviewers, who apparently rated it based on their improvements.

So yummy! Great option for me and my family since I don't have to add rice or noodles for myself. I ate it alone and the kids and husband ate it over egg noodles. Just the right amount of kick from the chili flakes. I recommend lean ground beef and half the tomatoes in the recipe. I also doubled the garlic powder because I love the stuff.

Delicious!  I used red cabbage,  so it generally looks more appealing. They say, you eat with your eyes first. I also added more seasoning.

Very easy to make. I only used 1 can of diced tomatoes (actually by mistake) and it turned out great. Great and filling for a meal without lots of carbs.

I didn't use red pepper but I did use sausage instead of ground beef. I used 1.5 bags of red cabbage and only 8oz of tomato sauce. I should have drained the tomatoes because it was soupy. My husband really liked it but I thought it was too sweet. I had to double the Italian seasoning and definitely use s &p or it'll be too bland.

I’ve been making this recipe for quite sometime.  It’s filling, easy, and the family loves it.  Made it by the recipe the first time I cooked this and everybody said it needed “something” - too bland.  I use lots of different seasonings depending on my mood.  Mexican is our favorite- cumin, cilantro, chili powder,  lots of garlic and at least one can of Rotel tomatoes. I like mine over cornbread with a side of hot buttered cornbread! Any way you spice it up is good!

It was great. I had some frozen cabbage from my summer harvest. I like rice in my casserole so I added 1 cup of rice and some extra liquid. I used broth but tomato juice would have also worked.

A great idea.  Cooked up very quickly.  I did add more spices, as per other reviews:  1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/2 tsp celery seed, 3/4 tsp Italian Seasoning.  I did not add the diced tomatoes, just the tomato sauce, and only 1 lb of beef.  I also added a lot of mushrooms, like 6 large white mushrooms, and increased the oil (avocado oil).  Paired it with a yam for a fairly Paleo dinner.  I got rave reviews!  I expected to have to let the liquid reduce for a long time, but I did not.  It was juicy, but there was not really any extra liquid.

I'm giving four stars, but with my adjustments it was a total five. I used three fresh tomatoes that I diced myself and I added a can of stewed tomatoes hat I had along with the tomato sauce. I used seasoning on hand and a squirt or two of sriracha... on top of rice it taste just like stuffed cabbage. Even my three old devoured it.

Big Change for this recipe is one of the main ingredients: the Meat. Use half Italian sausage (the sweet kind, Johnson is preferred) half ground beef. Personally I use the ground beef from the natural food store. It tastes better. If I am going to cook the result might as well be as tasty as possible.

For me, this recipe was good as is but I can never help "punching it up"

So... I added the following:
To the onion/meat mixture:
1/4-1/2 c red wine
1/2 t fennel seeds
1/2 t anchovy paste (no fishy taste, just some umpf)!
After adding cabbage:
1 c water
1 t vegetable bullion 
1/2 c uncooked rice

Served with grated cheese (your choice).
It was a very hearty meal and quite delicious.

I doubled the seasonings, added worcestire sauce, Montreal steak seasoning and about a cup of better than beef broth. At the end a pinch of sugar to nip the acid. Served over rice for the carb eaters in the house. Hearty and perfect on a cold eve. Easy to make after work too.  Next time I'm going to omit the sauce for a couple of ounces of tom paste

I made half a recipe because it is only the two of us and leftovers can be an issue.  My husband loved this!!  Easy to make and store.  Great use for the cabbage we grew in the garden.

It was like eating a stuffed cabbage in casserole form. We are going to try a little more Italian seasoning next time. Easy to make, but cover pan when simmering so the cabbage can steam.

I did not change it except added a little more red pepper flakes because I like a little heat. But there is so much you could add if you wanted to.

I followed recipe as directed. Was to much for just me so I shared it with family.  Family ate it but did not want to have it again.  I myself liked it.  Next day tried it with a package of  beef Ramen noodles and enjoyed it even more.  Will try it again but will need to try to lessen the  recipe

I added Kosher salt and doubled the spices. Also, I sauteed the onions with fresh garlic. It's very good and quite comforting. Great use of the cabbage. My husband enjoyed it even though he hates cabbage.

I made this the other night, and it was a very hearty, comfort food type dish. I am not one that likes a lot of hot, spicy or bold flavor, but  as others said, there wasn't much flavor, even though I added lots of garlic, oregano and lots of pepper and some salt.  I liked this recipe and will make it again, but with much, much more seasoning.  I strongly suggest you read the reviews of others and consider adding some of the flavor enhancing seasonings suggested.

Only three stars-according to the directions, what is the cabbage supposed to simmer in? The ground beef grease,  the tomato sauce and juice from the canned tomatoes? Still not enough liquid. I made this cooking the cabbage separately from all other ingredients, then putting the beef mixture in with the cabbage and letting it simmer to meld the flavors for a few minutes. (And who would want to eat greasy cabbage?!)

loved this. made it with chopped cabbage because that's what I had...and dumped in a lot of hot sauce...which not everyone could handle.

used only 1 lb ground beef (for the calories) and it was fine.

This was exceptional! I did read the reviews and did a few suggestions. As far as the seasonings, I added some that were suggested and some that were not. When all was put together, I did add about a half a box of beef broth. This made it more like a soup which I wanted. As for those mentioning using rice, wasn’t necessary for me. I imagine the leftovers will be even better. Wonderful dinner.........

This is excellent!  The first time I made it, I only had half a small cabbage and some leftover sauerkraut, so I put them in it.  I loved the bit of sourness that the kraut gave it.  The second time I made it I had all the ingredients and it turned out excellent again, so slygusa, you made a wonderful dish.  Thank you.

I don’t normally leave reviews but this time I had to write something. When I made this I did make modifications but only and I repeat only because this is what I had in my house to use. Are used 1 pound of hamburger and instead of regular tomato sauce are used a seven and three-quarter ounce can of hot tomato sauce and I illuminated the red pepper flakes. This recipe is awesome.  I will definitely be making it again.

I made this one easy by just buying a bag of coleslaw mix instead of chopping up a head of cabbage, cut out some prep time, Plus it adds carrots in the mix!

I will definitely make this again.  It was very quick and easy to make.  I served it over white rice.  Many reviews mentioned that theirs came out bland, so I used heaping measurements of the dry ingredients.  Then, just added a pinch of salt to my bowl once it was served.  I enjoyed the red pepper flakes.  It gave it just a slight kick.

I ran out of red pepper flakes. It was too bland so I added Habanero sauce, diced green chiles, additional garlic and italian seasoning. Turned out really good once I spiced it up.

Easy to make, common ingredients, low calorie. Taste wasn’t extraordinary, but I did eat it all.

I make this using lean ground turkey instead of beef for a healthier version. (The flavor is no different, but my Dr loves the difference in my cholesterol levels!). Instead of diced tomatoes I use stewed tomatoes, and dice them myself. The flavor is delicious! I use double the garlic powder, and Italian seasoning as well, and very little salt, maybe a teaspoon. Then let it simmer for an hour for the flavors to marry. I portion into 6 servings instead of 10, freeze it and take it to work for my supper!

Loved it with some changes. As suggested, I increased the seasoning (after tasting it and finding it dull):  I tripled the garlic and Italian seasoning, added celery seed and a bit more pepper flakes. I also used fresh garlic.  I used close to twice as much cabbage and a bit more tomato (plus a dab of tomato paste to thicken it); unlike some of the reviewers I prefer vegetable-heavy main dishes.   With those changes, yum!  I served it over brown rice.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I loved the flavor.  My only recommendation would be to use a half a head of cabbage or to double the meat.  The cabbage vs. beef ratio seemed way off and it seemed more like beef flavored cabbage instead of having the two of them co-star.  Other than that, I’d highly recommend if you’re looking for some simple home cooked comfort food.

My husband said make again right after eating it. I followed recipe. Cut recipe in half. And read some reviews about the flavor. I didn't add more than it called for, but personally felt it could've maybe used more garlic or salt, otherwise pretty good. Reminded me of stuffed cabbage minus the rice. It was a hearty and healthy meal you can feel good about feeding your family.

I have to say, this is pretty dang good.  HOWever...I did season as recommended by other reviewers.  I doubled the Italian Seasoning and added more garlic powder and crushed red pepper.  As well, I added at least a teaspoon of sweet paprika and a few shakes of smoked paprika and added a half tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.  AND...I used ground turkey which tasted great...and less than the called for amount of cabbage.  As I eyeballed it, it seemed like I'd have WAY too much cabbage with a whole small one.  I also added a little chicken stock to the onions as they were cooking.   Overall, my husband was very pleasantly surprised by this one as was I.  I'd definitely make it again.  Super easy and a great way to use up some cabbage if you have some laying around in the fridge.  OH, and I used all the called for tomatoes and sauce and didn't find it to be too little or too much.  I thought it was perfect.  : )  Enjoy!

I did make a few changes, so I don't feel I can review it fairly. I cut the recipe in half, did not add the tomato soup. I added 2 cups beef broth and 1 cup uncooked rice. I also doubled or more up on the spices.

I made this with 1.25 lbs of ground turkey and followed the rest of the directions exactly. I liked it! But I can see why some reviewers needed more flavor, the good thing is, you can easily tweak this to your tastes. You can add beans or a variety of vegetables and it'll still be good. I threw in some shredded chicken (my people need lots of protein) and additional spices, it was delicious. I can imagine a little andouille sausage or smoked sausage would be delicious as well. It makes a large amount and depending on what you do to it, is petty healthy. It easy and versatile.

It was very good! I read the reviews and used about 2x Italian seasoning, 2 cloves of garlic, one can of diced tomatoes and 1/2 jar of spaghetti sauce. It was much less liquid-y than I think it was supposed to be, but was very tasty! My husband thought it was a great replacement for pasta, as the taste was similar, and was very filling and satisfying. Will make again. (4 stars because I modified a bit - very good!!)

Made this tonight, it was just okay. Hubby wasn't a fan at all. I added more spices as per other reviews. Was very watery so served it over rice. It's bland even with extra spices and hot sauce. If I make it again I will really have to come up with a plan to vamp it up.

Good concept but needed additional seasoning as some of the other reviewers noted.  I added Franks Red Hot Sauce, smoked paprika,  and was definitely heavy handed on the salt, pepper, garlic powder & Italian seasonings.

It's easy to make.  Per other reviews, I doubled the Italian seasoning, used fresh minced garlic, instead of the garlic powder, but I felt that the red pepper  seasoning over powered the dish.  Something is missing in this recipe.  Next time, maybe, I'll try using beef broth as others suggested.

I only used 1 can diced tomatoes, eliminated the red pepper, and added onion soup packet, 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar and a couple tablespoons brown sugar.  It was great and tasted just like the stuffed cabbage my family loves but without the rice.  Definitely a recipe I will keep.

I made this a couple days ago and it was not the greatest. Some suggestions I have are to use as much fresh ingredients as possible i.e. Tomatoes. Add celery for that missing sweetness and some vegetable broth would be helpful. It was better the second day though.

I will definitely make this again.  I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef, used one can of  tomatoes instead of two and added beef bouillon.  This turned out very tasty.  I choose not to pair mine with rice or pasta, it was perfect without the extra.

This is an amazing recipe.  I read the reviews and followed all the suggestions such as additional spices, rotel, rice, and beef bouillon.  It turned out fantastic and will make again.  As someone suggested, you can put anything you have in the kitchen in it!  Highly recommend for a cold weather meal.  Thank you for sharing!

I just changed the ground beef to ground turkey.  I used 1# turkey and 8oz chicken breakfast cooked links. Depending on cabbage size, it may thicken too much. Just add a little water, a pinch more salt to taste. Great with rye, sour dough bread. Am making again!

This was excellent, with some changes. I did increase the seasonings in the recipe and added a few additional ones. It makes a large amount.

Everyone loves this. Like an open faced stuffed cabbage. Used lots of extra spices, garlic, one can of tomato(fire roasted), leftover kielbasa. I served it over rice but next time I'll cook the rice in the same pot. Lots of extra liquid, great for sopping up with bread. Thanks

I browned the beef with the red pepper flakes, added carrots, 11.5oz v8 juice, my diced tomato already had Iliana seasoning and a cup of un cooked rice. I also used fresh garlic and a stir fry seasoning.
