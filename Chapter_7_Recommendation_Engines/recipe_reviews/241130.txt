I loved it with 2 small changes. I added 2 cloves of garlic and simmered the kale mixture for about 10 minutes before adding the beans so that the beans didn't break down too much, but the kale was tender. Delicious!

Made it with a few slight changes.  I used low sodium chicken broth and low sodium vegetable broth split evenly.  I browned the kielbasa with a few spices and then added the broth and simmered for about 20 minutes.  At that time I added the beans without draining and then the the onions and then the kale.  Simmered for 20 more minutes.  Served but forgot Parmesan cheese.  Still awesome.  Definitely have to make this again.

This is wonderful! I added some cooked crumbled bacon to the original recipe, just because I had it. Use low sodium chicken broth. My kids didn't mind the Kale. They loved this! This will be a regular menu item!

My husband made this soup but used a slow cooker instead.  It tastes phenomenal, is super healthy, and doesn't require expensive or difficult to find ingredients!

I added 4 baby red potatoes, and seasoned it with Thyme, Rosemary and red pepper flakes from my spice rack! I added the beans in the last 10 minutes. Every spoonful is flavorful! I also used low sodium chicken broth, which was plenty salty. Great way to use up kale!

It seemed a little bland, so I added about 15 oz of tomato sauce while it was cooking, and some elbow macaroni at the end.  Then it was delicious!  I cooked the beans for 1.5 hours like he said then combined the ingredients and put it in the slow cooker all day.

Super easy, flavorful, healthy meal. Used turkey kielbasa. Added garlic, 1/2 can of leftover diced tomatoes and some leftover arugula. (Waste not, want not). Delicious!

We love this soup with homemade rolls to dip!  I sear the  kielbasa in my cast iron skillet (without oil) until it's browned and crispy, then add it last.  I also sometimes add pasta (small macaroni) or tortellini to it for a heavier meal AND fresh chopped cherry tomatoes.  Very good!

Great basic recipe that was quick and easy to assemble and a perfect way to get greens into the diet.   Just a few modifications:  I used a 12oz package of kielbasa links and a pre-chopped, pre-washed 10 oz bag of kale, and about double the broth to allow for the larger amount of kale.  I also took a tip from another reviewer and let the kale cook longer before adding the beans. I'd recommend using low or no-salt broths as the kielbasa was quite salty already, so I added a couple of diced potatoes to offset the salt.

Surprisingly, the kids liked it. They'd probably like it more if I added more beans.

Excellent soup! Being of Polish descent, this caught my eye. I really enjoyed this with the kale (usually it's cabbage). Not wanting the kale tough, I simmered it (bite-sized pieces) in half low-sodium chicken broth and half vegetable broth for about 30 min. I browned the chopped, skinless kielbasa and added it to the kale, along with an undrained can of cannellini beans. I didn't have scallions on hand, so I gave a few good shakes of onion powder, as well as garlic powder.  Then I simmered on very low for about 15 min. The topping of parmesan cheese really sends it over the top. I did change the method slightly, but  I know I got the same delicious product in the end.
