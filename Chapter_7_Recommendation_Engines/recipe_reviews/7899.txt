This is an amazing recipe!!! I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13" pan and only took about 35 minutes to bake. I used six very ripe large bananas and I think that was just right. Great recipe! Thanks

I just finished baking this recipe. I chose it because I had some bananas to use up and the oatmeal adds some extra fiber that banana bread doesn't have. I used a cupcake pan with paper liners instead of the 8x8 pan and it made 12 cupcakes. They were done after baking about 27 minutes. They are SO moist and tasty, the banana flavor shines! The oatmeal adds an amazing soft texture. The only change I made to the recipe was to add about a tablespoon of flour to the oatmeal topping mixture in hope of avoiding the "too loose" issues other reviewers mentioned. My topping held together pretty well, so maybe it worked. The texture is like a homestyle "snack cake" cake, not an elegant bakery type of cake. Plan to eat this up right away, it doesn't keep very well at all.

What a wonderful way to use ripe bananas! I was looking for a recipe to introduce more oats into my diet and this is great!  Like others stated, I used 3 medium ripe bananas, added 1 tsp cinnamon to the cake batter, and 1T flour to the topping.  Next time I may try making muffins.  Now I'm waiting for my bananas to become very ripe so I can make this again!

My friend and I made this cake for something sweet yet healthy, and it turned out perfect!  We baked it for 35 minutes, and it was the perfect moisture and texture.  The oats and brown sugar taste great in this cake, and it's very easy to make.

I doubled the recipe and baked in my Pampered Chef square baker. ( I use nothing but stones to cook and everything turns out awesome ) I read all the reviews about the topping being crumbly, so I put 1/2 the batter in the pan, put the topping and then the rest of the batter to contain it within the cake.  Very good.

I love banana bread, so I fully expected to enjoy this cake.  But... it really just wasn't that great.  I found it to be on the dry side, and didn't care for the addition of the oats (although the banana oat bread from this site is delicious).  So, I guess that I will stick to making breads from my over ripe bananas.

LOVED this recipe.  Turned out perfectly and it is so easy to make.  I took it to work this morning and it is gone (30 min into the work day).  The only modification I made was to use pecans instead of walnuts.  This is a keeper.  Oh, and as per the other reviewers this is delicious warm out of the oven, but even better the next day.

It's yummy! I doubled my recipe for the banana batter and baked it on a 9x13x2 pan for added height (2 inches). The crumb topping is delicious. I used cashew nuts instead of walnuts and it came out fine. I will be baking this again and again. Thanks Carol.

I was a little unsure about this one but it turned out great. The banana flavor worked well as the foundation for this bread, and the crumb topping worked out fine.

My family loved this. It's wholesome, can be whipped together quickly, and very versatile - can be breakfast, brunch, snack or dessert. And it's even nice enough for company. I actually thought the crumbly top looked pretty falling onto the plate. But be sure to use a very ripe banana for good flavor.

Great banana bread! Moist & fluffy with a nice banana flavor and a crispy topping. I made into(12)muffins, baking for 25 minutes due to two previous reviews. Turned out a few minutes over-cooked (a little too brown). All our ovens vary, so I will try 20 minutes & keep checking next time. Also, I was trying to hide the fact that I put oatmeal (which a family member dislikes) in banana bread, so... I subbed flour for the oats on the top. That "streusel" topping worked great also. What a good way to use up too-ripe bananas & add oats to our sweets!

This was a hit! I've been itching to make this for a week and finally got to make it! Awesome! Guests gobbled this up! This baked for 30 mins.. glad I was watching!
I didn't make the crumb topping, as I wanted frosting. I found "banana butter icing" recipe on this site which paired perfect for me.

I just made this for my family and it was delicious and so, so moist with a nice crunchy topping. My husband actually likes to scrape the pan and leaves no crumblies behind. Had to cook longer since I used a glass pyrex instead of cake pan but turned out great.

I made this cake into muffins. I'll have to make it again because I didn't let the butter and sugar cream long enough. It was still tasty though and we really liked the crumb topping. Next time I think I'll put nuts inside the cake too because they kept falling off the top.

The baking time was way too long...I only baked for about 30 minutes and it was a little over-baked. I added cinnamon to the batter and flour to the topping. The finished product tasted very good, but it was extremely crumbly (hence the name "crumb cake," I know, but I was not a fan of that much crumble. I probably won't make this again.

Very tasty - like banana bread with a sweet kick from the topping. I think I'd use less oats for the topping the next time I make it. Maybe 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 - seemed to be a bit much as it "crumbled" a bit. But the flavor is great. I took it to a brunch party and everyone wanted the recipe.

Good overall texture.  Topping butter should not be melted all the way to provide better topping consistancy.  This recipe would also make very good muffins.

This was pretty good. A little dryer than I had hoped, so I guess I overbaked, even though I baked it in my notoriously slow oven the minimum amount of time called for. The topping could use a little more butter, I think, as it is quite dry. Thanks!

For the people complaining that this recipe lacked in flavor, I have some ideas:  Use REAL butter, GOOD vanilla, and BROWN bananas... the more ripe your bananas, the better.  This is a very good, moist cake with a crumbly top.  Reminded me of a coffee cake style.  I used whole wheat flour, and had to add about 1/4 cup applesauce as my bananas only made 3/4 cup.

This was delicious - the family raved on Mother's Day!  I doubled and made in a 9x13 pan, baking 50 minutes.  My only change was using 3 egg whites rather than whole eggs.  Will make again & will eat with coffee next time!  Was delicious with milk!

Yummy banana cake! I added 1-1/2 or 2 tablespoons of flour to the topping, more cinnamon and about 1 tablespoon of canola oil. I patted the topping down lightly. For the cake, I followed the directions, only I don't mash the bananas, just drop the chunks of banana into cake batter, beat it in my stand mixer. I used 3 bananas, didn't measure them. Good flavor. Next time I will make it with quick oats.

This is a really great recipe.  I added 1TBLS flour to the topping as recommended, and it helped everything stay together.  I subbed whole wheat flour for 1/4 of the regular flour -- It ups the health factor and adds to the nutty flavor.  I may use this as my apple cake/muffin recipe by replacing the banana with chopped apples.  Thank you!

Too heavy to be a cake.  Not dense enough to be bread.  The texture made very unclean cuts.  It wasn't bad, just not what I expected or wanted. On the other hand, my thirteen year old son (who doesn't like "raw" bananas or oats too much said to keep the recipe.  I topped with chocolate frosting instead.  Years (literally) later: I tried to oat topping on another recipe & wasn't too impressed.  It did the job, but wasn't memorable.

Yummy! I have made this several times. We now can't wait to have left over bananas for it. I have to purchase extra on purpose. My husband devours this stuff. I went ahead and used white whole wheat flour since the oatmeal already makes it quite hardy. I think people are thrown off by the name. It does not really have a 'cake' texture. I use a little extra banana. It then has a very strong banana flavor. I also decrease the sugar due to the extra bananas adding sweetness. Moist and flavorful! Thank you for sharing!

The cake is great! I used a bigger baking pan so shortened the baking time. Also, I used 3 large bananas and will use 4-5 next time. Other than that, people told me it was the best cake they had ever eaten!

I've made this two times in as many days and it's gone again.  The second time I used stage 2 banana baby food (because it's a little coarser) for the bananas and it was just a good as the first!!!

This is a good alternative to banana bread when your bananas ripen too quickly.  It's especially good when served warm with a little ice cream on the side.

Delicious alternative to banana nut bread! My family loved it, especially when we added a sweetened dairy component to the top. Highly recommend (just with a bit of ice cream or whipped cream)!

I made this exactly as written, but substituted pecans for the walnuts. Very, very good. A dense cake. Kind of like a banana coffee cake. Crumb topping is delicious!

I chose this recipe because I wanted something that was more like a snack cake or banana bread than a typical 2-layer risen cake. I followed the recipe exactly, down to making sure the ingredients were scraped evenly across the top of measuring cups and spoons. My baking powder was not out of date. I sifted the flour. I live at sea level so I should not have to adjust the recipe as I used to have to do when I lived at 6,000 ft. I expected this to be dense but moist only it was hard and dry. I checked the cake at 35 min and it wasn't done so I gave it 5 more minutes (it was then done) and took it out. It was not overly brown on the bottom or sides so I know it didn't overcook. Cooled it on a rack. Luckily I didn't make this for guests because I'm a really good cook and I would have been embarrassed. Am glad it was only a 8x8 size and not 13x9. My family isn't even eating it. Wish I could give it the same reviews as others.

I tried to fix this cake by sprinkling it with some powdered sugar like the crumb cakes at the store. However, that did not work. The cake still just tasted like a dense, dry, barely sweet banana muffin. I made it because I had some leftover bananas. Either way I didn't want it to go to waste. And, I ended up resorting to making a banana frosting from on here to give the cake some flavor. That helped to get some of this cake eaten but the rest got tossed still. Just not a good cake.

it was okay, i have had much better banana cake. The topping was very dry and fell off, so if i make this again, and that is a big IF, i will not make the topping.

Delicious! It was much lighter and fluffier than traditional banana bread. My only complaint was that it was a little on the sweet side with both the sweet cake and crumb topping. Great way to use up bananas and oatmeal (things I always seem to have lying around!).

These were amazing!  Did as others suggested and baked them as muffins for 27 minutes.  Used the topping from To Die For Blueberry Muffins from this site and my entire family loved them.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very moist and tasty. I used pecans instead of walnuts since I had some already chopped. My bananas didn't make quite one cup, so I added a little unsweetened applesauce. This may have upped the baking time (mine took 54 min.).

Great cake! I turned this in to a chocolate banana cake by adding 1/3 cup coco powder, and then 1/3 cup white sugar (to make up for the bitterness of the coco.) Turned our great. Very flavourful, and nice taxture. :)

I didn't measure the bananas, but I used three medium.  I think I would put at least one more banana in, or some banana extract.  I think it should have baked 5-10 minutes less, but maybe that's my oven.  The topping was a little loose, but most of it stayed on the cake.  Could have used a little more cinnamon too.  Overall though, it was good and I really like the oatmeal idea.  I will make it again with my above-mentioned modifications.  Thank you Carol!

This cake was really excellent!  The oatmeal (I used Irish oatmeal) added a great texture to the cake itself and was delicious in the crumb topping.  The moistness of this cake also is wonderful.

This recipe is outrageous, the texture is not you typical cake because of the oatmeal which makes it a little crunchie. I made it in a loaf pan and ate almost the entire cake in a few days except for the few pieces I brought to work and and whoever tasted it wanted the recipe. Thank you

After reading some of the negative reviews I concluded that those are bakers that don't know how to tweek and adjust.  Added a little butter to the crumb topping, took out some of the oatmeal in the topping as well. I made sure that the bananas were very ripe and baked it only for thirty minutes.  And this is truly one of the best cakes we have ever eaten!  Less butter, more oatmeal, forty to forty five minutes in the oven, less ripe bananas and maybe it wouldn't have been.  But with a little tweeking to suit your own tastes and it was perfect!!!!

This is a really good coffee cake! We are trying to cut back on our sugar intake, so for the cake, I used 1/3c brown sugar and 1/3c Stevia and for the topping, I cut the brown sugar to a little less than 1/4c and added 2tsp cinnamon and 1/4tsp nutmeg.  Everyone loved it. I will be making this again.

I made this in a muffin version for brunch at a friend's house.  Against my tendency to add in random things and not measure when baking, I mostly stuck to the recipe this time.  However, I did add in maybe a half cup of bourbon.  I tasted the muffin that night and it was OK, but by the next morning for brunch, the flavors had melded together so well.  So, I would highly recommend cooking this the night before you plan to eat them, and if you are able to add in some bourbon, it really adds another layer to the flavor.  Enjoy!!

Great Recipe! I cooked it up really quick in my oven while waiting for my dinner to finish cooking (ughhh casseroles take so long to cook...) and ate nearly half the cake batter while baking and then ate the other when it came out xD my kids loved it, and so did my mother in law!! (Can you believe it? I pleased her. THE UNACCOMPLISHABLE TASK!!) 

Since valentines is so close(February 11, 2014 today!!!) I made half the batch like the recipe specifies, poured it into the pan, then made the other half using red food dye and pouring that on top of the the rest of the batter. It came out with three colored layers!! It was wonderful!!

This is great.  I used dark brown sugar as it was all I had.  I also doubled the recipe and baked in a 9 by 13 glass dish.  Baked for 45 minutes and it came out nice and moist except that the areas touching the dish were a bit overdone.  But I am not the best when it comes to baking cakes and breads and this happens to me a lot.   Mine came out dark in color, most likely because of the dark brown sugar.  Tastes delicious.

So easy.  So good.   Use softened butter instead of melted to make the topping.  Sprinkle it on the batter, then kind of softly pat it a bit before baking.  It won't be quite so messy.   You will love this delicious little cake!  Thanks, Carol, 
 for sharing the recipe.

the only reason this is a 4 star is because I dont like banana bread, although this version of banana bread was much less tough than others I have tried.

Wonderful flavor and very moist. I chopped the nuts but forgot to add to topping but was great anyway. I baked a little less time because I used a dark pan and it began to get to brown. Will make again for sure. I liked the fact it was only 8X8.

I always try the recipe as written first, and this one didn't disappoint -the cake was very moist, and very tasty. Next time I make this I might add some walnuts to the cake & maybe a teensy bit more spice to the topping, but that's just me -it's very good as it is. Thank you for sharing!

Baked this a couple of days ago, it was delicious.  Perfect for a snack, not too sweet, kids and hubby liked it too.  I really like the oatmeal topping, and love the pecans.  I think the only thing I'll do next time is add some more pecans :)
Thank you for this tasty, easy recipe.

Very good...I took advise of other reviewers and added flour to the crumb topping, and made them into muffins. I esp love the oatmeal texture.

I took this to work and everyone loved it! I too, added a tsp of flour to the topping like the other reviewers said and it held together nicely. I found that this needed to be baked longer than said on the recipe...I had a very wet middle but no one seemed to mind! Very yummy, easy, and a little different than just plain 'ol banana bread! Thanks for the recipe.

This crumb cake was absolutely delicious. I used 4 bananas and didn't really measure how many cups that was, but it turned out perfect! I also used grape nuts instead of walnuts on the topping due to nut allergies in our home. That added just the right amount of crunch to keep the texture of the cake true to the recipe. This recipe is going into heavy rotation in my kitchen.

My family and I really liked this recipe.  I doubled it and added a cup of blueberries, subbed applesauce for half of the butter, added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp ground cloves and baked in a 9x13 pan.  Like everyone else said, it is better the next day as it gets more moist upon sitting.  For best banana flavour, you must use really, really ripe (almost black) bananas.

This was SO good! While making it, the batter looked a little funny and I wasn't so sure about it, but I followed the directions to a T and it was Wonderful! It only took about 35 minutes to cook in my oven. My husband is a banana bread freak, he's threatened to dump me if he doesn't have his banana bread once a week or so...and he said this recipe was Better than my awesome banana bread recipe that he loves.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Easy and tasty cake!  I replaced the butter in the cake batter with canola oil and used a soft, oil-based margarine for the topping. I made this recipe because I always seem to have really ripe bananas sitting on my kitchen counter and needed an alternative to banana bread.

Yummy and wholesome!  I replaced 1/4 cup flour with whole wheat flour and added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the batter.  I then drizzled the cake with a glaze.  I only used 2 bananas and it turned out moist and flavorful.  I'm not sure I like the oats in the topping (a little too chewy and crumbly), so next time I might leave them out and add a little flour instead.

I was tired of my plain old banana bread,so I tried this recipe,and my husband can't get enough of it! It's a great use for those overly ripened bananas.I did make a few healthy adjustments though. I used applesauce instead of butter. And I also added some flaxseed in the cake and in the topping. And I used oat flour instead of white flour.

I made this recipe with one change and that was to leave out the walnuts (no one in my family likes them). I think it's a very average cake.  It's not bad by any means, it's just ok.  It IS very easy and quick to put together and it's a good way to use up extra bananas. Something different than banana bread.  It's not very sweet and the oats definitely add a chewiness and heartiness to the cake.  The cake part of it might actually be better with the smaller cut instant oats but the crumb topping is good as is. I doubled the cake & topping recipe and put it in a 13x9 inch pan and I would have preferred more of the crumb topping. The cinnamon is a must - it would be extremely boring without it (maybe even a bit of cinnamon in the cake part?). It almost feels somewhat "healthy" eating this because it's not actually a high amount of sugar for as much batter as it makes and of course the oats are good for you. One thing though - it's not a very attractive cake even though I know it's a coffee cake sort of cake.  It's average.

Had some bananas heading south so decided to try something other than my usual banana bread recipe... wasn't impressed.  :o(  Sorry.  I guess after reading the reviews my expectations exceeded the actual results.  I ended up scraping off the topping (it was what rated the three *'s), sprinkled it over vanilla ice cream, and drizzled with caramel syrup - the family liked that!

Delicious. We loved this! I didn't have walnuts, so I used pecans, and I forgot about the oats on the topping, but it turned out really well anyway. Without the oats on the topping, it actually cooked into the cake a bit which was really good!

This was a wonderful recipe. I used vegetable oil instead of butter because, for me, it makes for a more moist cake. That was really the only change I made, other than taking the user suggestion of adding 1 Tbls. of flour to the topping mixture. Like others, I made these into muffins (cooked for about 29 minutes) instead of a single cake. The flavor was great and they were moist and very banana-y. I had a ton of topping--almost, but not quite, too much and it stayed on my muffins just fine. This recipe might replace plain ole' banana bread in my house!

This recipe was just ok.  I took the advice of one of the other readers and made this into muffins.  I left them in the oven for 27 minutes and they turned out too dry.  I don't know if I left them in too long or they needed something else for more moisture.  The crumb topping was actually very good.  I don't think I will make them again.

I didn't have any bananas, so I used 1 cup of applesauce instead. Because the applesauce was more liquidy, I used a full cup of flour. It turned out great! Very oaty and hearty. Makes a great breakfast treat!

My husband loved this.  Especially the crumb topping.  Next time, may make in an 8x12 pan to increase the ratio of crumb to cake.  Yummy!  Also - served with fresh whipped cream for a light topping.

I had four ripe bananas, so I used all of them, which was more than the recipe called for, but this was great!  I also took other users tips and added 1Tbsp flour to the topping.  We ate this for breakfast!  Yummy!

A very tasty banana cake, not outrageously divine or anything, but rather moist and delicious.  I really liked the oats, they gave it a nice bit of crunch and texture.  Next time I'll make them as muffins perhaps.  Very good.

Very tasty.  Great way to use up old bananas.  I really like the oatmeal/banana flavors together.  I think I could have eaten the whole pan myself.  Mine was done cooking at about 30 minutes and I had to cover it at about 20 minutes so that it would not get to brown.

Wowie, zowie! What a yummy cake. I served it for breakfast as a coffee cake. Substituting shortening for butter (because it's what I had on hand) it still turned out incredible! Thank you.

This cake was terrific!! I added about 1/2 cup more banana (mostly because I had only 1 left and wanted to get rid of it) but other than that, I followed the recipe as written. Very moist and great flavor! This didn't last long at my house!!

I added 1 tsp cinnamon to the batter and baked for 40 minutes. Very dry, might be the kind of cake to eat warm with ice cream. Cooled off not so great. won't make this again. :(

This was awesome!  My husband took one bite and said "now this is good!".  It's super moist and the oatmeal gives a wonderful texture.  The one thing I didn't get was the crumb topping. It wasn't as much a crumble as it was a paste.  This may be because I didn't use the nuts. I just blotted it onto the batter and it sort of melted into the cake and made cratters but we loved it anyway.  I will definately make this again.

Omitted nuts due to my kid's allergies -- still turned out great!  Moist cake and crumbly topping.  Thanks for other feedback.  Mine was done in 35 mins.  Five more mins would have burned it.

Not a bad cake, but a bit boring.  It turned out well....wasn't dry etc. (Will be good with coffee tommorrow morning.)  However, it didn't knock my socks off.  Maybe I'm just tired of banana cakes and breads.

This was a big hit with my family!  Everyone gave it a thumbs up and all wanted the recipe.  I used very ripe bananas and increased the bananas to 1 1/2 cups.  I will have to make it again soon as we finished it in one sitting!

This recipe sounded good, but I was a little disappointed.  The topping is very crumbly, and the banana taste did not come through as much as I would have liked.  Riper bananas might have helped.

Very good. I took this to a potluck so I doubled recipe. Adults and children both liked it. I would add applesauce ISO so much butter to  make it moister. I added a simple milk and confectioners sugar icing on top of the crumb topping, which was really yummy.

It had a very moist and perfect texture. Im personally not a big fan of bananas but in this dish banana s were what starred. I avoided making the glaze as i lacked ingredients. The oats were nice and crunchy.

I Followed The recipe otherwise. For the Topping i Added the Tbsp Of flour. They came out Great!

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make!
Only had an issue with the time for baking. Took me an hour and the crumb topping dried out because of that. It does add a lovely crunch to the cake, though, and I substituted almonds for walnuts cause I didn't have any walnuts. Overall, very satisfied. This is the first banana cake I've ever made!

Very good snack cake! I prepared this as written and then baked in my 8x8 Pyrex dish. I reduced the heat to 325 and it was ready in approx. 42 min.

Followed recipe as written.  Made 6 jumbo muffins instead of a cake. Good tasting, but the texture is kind of chewy and unpleasant. Won't make it again.

I too doubled the recipe and baked in a 13x9 pan.  Wonderful recipe just as written!  Coffee cake/banana bread/cake all in one.  I drizzled a little bit of icing over the top, more for aesthetics than need.  I will make this again for brunch to dessert!

Easy enough, very tasty.  I added 1 cup of raisins to the batter, 1/2 cup of coconut to the topping and baked them as muffins (12 good sized).  They freeze great and 15 seconds on high in the microwave and they taste like fresh baked.  Easy to take to work for breakfast or mid-morning snack.

Absolutely delicious!  This cake is so moist and reminds me of a combination of a banana cake and an oatmeal cake. I did substitute Truvia for the sugar (only because I can't have regular sugar) and since I had three blackish-skin colored bananas, I threw all three in. The cake was so moist and delicious and lasted for several days without drying out. I did not change anything else; followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the aforementioned items. Truly a wonderful tasting cake and so delicious warm with a cup of coffee!  If you like either banana or oatmeal cake, you will love this!!

What baker doesn't make changes? More bananas, less butter in equal parts. Added apple pie spice to the batter as well as the struesel. I don't like walnuts, never use them; used pecans. Really a good, moist, dense cake. Next time I might use peanut butter instead of butter, with chopped peanuts in the struesel. Oh, and the batter fit nicely into a 10" cast iron skillet. Isn't baking fun?

I used about a cup and a 1/3 of very ripe banana (about 3 good sized) in a Ninja blender.  What I did for the oats is:  about 3/4c of oats lightly chopped in food processor.  1/4 c of oats that I made into flour. Then the 1/3c whole oats. It makes a great blend for this cake. Take the time to cream the butter/sugar well. I also refuse to use "imitation" vanilla. Madagascar Bourbon vanilla...makes a big difference in taste.  I also doubled all the crumb topping  with the exception of the oats. And omitted the walnuts due to being allergic. Very light moist cake.

I loved it and so did my husband. But my daughter and her hubby didn't like it at all. They didn't like the texture. I don't even think there was anything wrong with the texture. But some people have issues with texture.

I used 1/2 cup wheat flour + 1/4 all purpose, then used a flax substitute for the eggs because I was out. The taste is amazing and it's incredibly moist, but the texture is probably crumblier than if I'd used real eggs. 
I'd actually cut back on the crumb topping--it's bordering on too much sugar for me. But based on the other reviews, this is probably just because I don't have much of a sweet tooth. Anyway, I'd still highly recommend!

This was pretty good.  The topping was extremely crumbly, so I added a little vanilla glaze drizzle on top.  Doubled the recipe and made it in a 13 x 9 pan.

My family didn't like it as a "cake". I made it in muffin pans and called it breakfast muffins and was asked to make it on a regular basis. Amazing when you change the name and mindset :) I've added blueberries since and it just added to the great flavor. I'm putting this in my muffin category!

A delicious moist banana cake with a crunchy oatmeal topping.  DH really enjoyed it; DS thought it was just ok.  I thought it was a tasty way to use up over-ripe bananas.  I made it exactly as written, no changes needed.

Wonderful recipe, I was looking for a good cake recipe to use up 3 browning bananas I had, but wanted something that didn't need frosting. The crumb topping on this is great, I didn't use walnuts because some family members don't like nuts, but it's still really good. Very rich and moist. I used the small changes I read here, the 1 tsp of cinnamon in the batter and 1 Tbsp of flour in the topping. I highly recommend!

I made this delicious cake last night and it was amazing!  I imagine with all the oats in this cake, it's somewhat healthy and loaded with fiber!  What a great way to get some additional fiber in you and your kids' diet - esp. with a picky 5 yr old who detests oatmeal.  I followed the recipe to the letter but just left out the nuts since my son is allergic.  I used Quaker quick cook oatmeal, and doubled the recipe and baked in a 13x9 pan and packed the next day in both my 10 and 5 yr old son's lunches, and sent extras so they can give to their teachers.  This recipe is the BOMB the next day as per what other reviewers said!  In my opinion, the key is to use over-ripe bananas - and i mean over-ripe! the peel is brown and feels almost mushy inside!  You want all those natural sugars to come through in this cake, which will give you an amazing banana taste!  This is key to making any banana bread/cake recipe.  Also make sure you cream butter/sugar until fluffy!  It lends a more fluffy moist cake!  Don't skip out on the topping, it's so yummy and great with coffee the next day!  I can go on and on....this recipe is a keeper for sure!  Thanks for sharing Carol!

Followed the recipe exactly, and would not change a thing.   It is a very moist and tasty cake.  It is a keeper for sure.   The only thing next time I will double it and use a 9x13 only because the 8x8 will probably not last the evening.

a great cake not too sweet and not over powered by banana, I didn't have a 8x8 cake tin so I used 10x11 so it was thinner about 1.5" (cooked) so I only cooked for about 25mins  I also added a large spoon of peanut butter to the melted butter before I mixed into the oats as I had no walnuts but it was delicious

This was just okay for me. With all the 4 and 5 star reviews, I was expecting something phenomenal, but this didn't live up to the hype for me.

The family rated a four cause it was slightly dry....but overall pretty tasty. Loved the fact of all the oat-y goodness. Will try again! Thanks!

I followed other people's suggestions about incorporating some of the topping into the dough on the surface. Otherwise there would've been too much loose crumb topping. Good flavor combination - I loved using oatmeal with the banana.

Very good.  I used rolled oats which I wouldn't do again.  I read about adding flour to the topping which I would do next time.  Double batch didn't take very long to bake.  We had it as breakfast and dessert.

This uses a large amount of bananas, unlike most banana cake recipes, so it's good for using up the spotted ones that seem to pile up in the fruit bowl.  The kids loved it, raved on it in fact!

We Love this recipe! I doubled it and used 6 bananas as others suggested. I've gotten so many requests for this recipe. You can use walnuts or pecans. I like to eat it the next day after.

Excellent snacking cake.  Came out great. Will make again. The only revision was to accomodate for Denver's altitude.  Making the second time, I didn't want the crumb topping so I made a cinnamon syrup from another cake recipe on this  site poking holes in the cake for the syrup to penetrate the cake.  Liked it even better without the crumb topping.

Very nice breakfast style cake and a terrific use for ripe bananas. I added the cinnamon to the dry ingredients of the batter and the 1 Tablespoon of flour to the crumb mixture as suggested. It had great flavor and my guests enjoyed it. Thank you!

The cake part is pretty good. For those who didn't enjoy the topping.... Leave it off and drizzle a glaze made with brown sugar, vanilla and a tiny amount of water. This glaze goes crunchy when it sets and is to die for! :)

this cake was delicious! i made it low fat though...used applesauce in the cake in stead of the butter. i used whole wheat and white flour.i used egg whites instead of whole eggs. i also added about a 1/3 cup or so of ground flax seed. i will be making this again! oh, and i used dark brown sugar which gave it such a great flavor!

I just finished making this cake..worked out really well! I made a few changes: I baked it in a loaf pan, so I had to make the recipe one and a half times, so that the cake was the appropriate size (and then adjusted the timing accordingly). I also added the tbsp of flour to the crumb topping that others suggested. It worked out really really well, super moist! I'm taking it to a bake sale, I think it's going to sell very fast :)

I love banana bread, but was tired of the same ol' thing, plus I'm moving soon and wanted to get rid of some ingredients I had lying around.  Almost miraculously, I found this recipe.  I followed it exactly to a "t" except for substituting one half of the butter for applesauce.  The cake smelled delicious, was immensely moist, banana-bread like, and since I let the crumb topping sit a bit before sticking in the oven, I didn't have the problem of it falling off (plus I used those mini quick oats).  The presentation was gorgeous, my boyfriend loved it, and I'm sure the other people we will share it with today will enjoy it as well.  Thanks!

Love this recipe and very easy. I only made one minor change, added a little more butter to the crumb topping. It seems to give it a little more binding while cutting into it.

Yummy, light, rather healthy, too! Tasty with strawberries.  I like whole wheat, so I used that.  Great made in muffin tins, time takes ~28 min. I subst. coconut oil instead of butter (I did use margarine in topping); subst. nuts & coconut for some of the oats in cake; used 1 tsp cinnamon on top. Think I'd like next time to add cinammon in cake, too. Or 1/8 tsp nutmeg, or allspice, just for a different taste.

I wasn't very impressed.  This was easy enough o prepare and the texture was pretty good- moist and fluffy- but the flavor was just so-so and the crumb topping was such a pain in the neck.  Most of the flavor seemed to be in the crumbs, but it was next to impossible to keep any of the topping on the cake while serving. Doubtful if I'll ever make it again.

This cake was pretty good. It had a really nice banana flavor, but it was kind of dense. I thought it was going to be a bit fluffier.I would probably make it again if I didn't know what else to make for dessert.

I turned this into a muffin recipe and am glad I did because I can't see this being a cake. The flavor is good (I added about 1/2 t of banana flavoring since I only had 2 bananas) and the cake had a very pleasant texture to it, but it really seems more like a muffin rather than a cake recipe. I added about 1/2 c of applesauce to the batter as I only had 2 bananas, and omitted the nuts. Tasted, looked, and smelled great.

This cake was surprisingly moist and I just love the heartiness that the oats add to it.  This is definitely not something I'd make often, but something worth trying at least once...It was a bit too heavy for our tastes...and even a little bit too "oatey".

This is a great coffee cake if cut in small pieces.  The oatmeal makes it a little on the heavy side.  Flavors were great!

This turned out very nice! It was very moist and not too sweet at all! I also LOVED the fact that there is no oil in this cake :)

This cake was good and really easy to fix. My guests enjoyed it.  I served it warm and added a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

This is healthier than my regular banana cake.  I liked the idea of oats in the cake, it was a nice change.  I will keep this recipe.

Hi, Carol, I am a teenager who recently really got into cooking, except everything I cooked came out tasting like burn toast, so I decided to try and make your cake. To say the least, it not only came out tasting wonderful, but my family cannot get a enough of it. They are always begging me to make it. Thanks Carol, for making cook something that didn't taste like burn toast.

Excellent texture and flavor - a real keeper.  I did not use nuts (my daughters request).  Did not measure bananas - just put 3 avg sized bananas in mixer bowl and mashed them up with the beater.

I changed this to low cholesterol, low fat by substituting low fat plain yogurt for the oleo and using eggbeaters in place of real eggs in cake batter

Topping was a little loose. We love this and I have made it several times now. It is even better the next day! I really like the texture of the oatmeal.
