I got this recipe about 20 years ago from my mother-in-law.  I always make it for summer get-togethers.  Lately I have been substituting pre-cooked bacon (it's so easy-just heat in the microwave until crispy).  I recommend serving the dressing on the side.  That way you can refrigerate any left-overs without the spinach getting soggy.

I made this for a party and it turned out fabulous!!!  Everyone loved it and thought it had such a wonderfully tangy dressing.  I had to substitute salad greens for spinach because I happened to make it during the spinach scare, but it was still excellent... I plan on making it again soon.  It does make too much dressing though, so next time I'll scale it down. You can use the recipe conversion on this site to scale down the number of servings from 8 to 6 and use that for the dressing but keep the other ingredients the same.  Thats what I plan on doing.

The version I've been making for years mixes the dressing in the blender with some onion and then adds a grated boiled egg.  And everywhere I take it, everyone raves.  My husband's complaint is that I don't make it just for us at home.

my husband, who is not a fan of salad, loved this one.  the flavor combination is so different and good.  maybe, there is just a bit too much dressing but that would be my only criticism.  i will definitely make and serve this one again.

Overwhelming dressing, suggest you make it on the side and add it as needed.

Yes, you certainly have had that recipe for over 30 years because so have I!  It is a delicious salad, albeit I would prefer a bit less dressing than what it calls for.  I would probably put on 3/4's of what they suggest and use the balance for something else.  I will have to to make it again, for sure.  Thanks for the memories.

One of the BEST salads I've ever had, and I've had quite a few.  The bacon and boiled egg give this recipe a little more substance than most salads.  I added strawberries once and tomatoes the second time.  Both worked well!  GREAT!

I have had this recipe for 30+ years as well.  I would not change a thing!  We always serve the dressing on the side, which allows those who prefer it a little on the lighter side to achieve their taste preferences!  The only problem that we have ever had is that my husband and son like to swipe the crispy bacon off the top, so I always add extra so there is plenty to go around!  This salad has been requested every year for every family picnic, Christmas and NY event!  DELICIOUS!

This is a delicious salad.  You can't go wrong with bacon and spinach.  It makes enough dressing that we have enough for two salads. My husband is not a salad fan either and he has requested this one!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious!  A big hit at my Salad Club at school/work!  Will definitely keep this recipe handy for future use.  The dressing is delicious!

Thank you for sharing this! My rating is based on the dressing alone because I feel the salad can be whatever you want and it would still taste great. We used mixed spinach greens, tomatoes and red onion. I did add the bacon on top and although I cooked the eggs, I was busy and forgot to add them! I will definately make this again! (BTW.. my kids won't touch raw mushrooms so even if I had them, I would not have added them).

Excellent taste but definitely do not pour the dressing on top.  Let everyone pour their own dressing...it can be too much for some.
