I usually share my cookies with my neighbors and they were not thrilled at all with this recipe-the cookies tasted very bland.  The dough tasted very good but after being baked they didn't taste like the dough.

They were just ok.  A little boring and the honey overpowered the peanut butter.  

Update:  If you let them sit for a day, the honey mellows out yet they stay really soft.  They are actually quite good.

I usually don't bake anything at my house because we usually don't eat a lot of sweets. They just go bad. But I made these cookies and the next day they were gone! I was really surprised.

The dough tasted good but when I cooked them, they had absolutely no flavor.  The recipe I used to use didn't call for honey...this may be the problem.  I wouldn't suggest trying this recipe.

Note to myself: read reviews before trying something new... I did not care for this at all. Nothing like traditional peanut butter cookies! I thought it was going to be good, because of the honey... but it isn't at all.

these cookies were easy to make but the dough was way to sticky to work by hand so i used a pastry bag to put the cookies on the pan. also, the hubby says not enough peanut butter flavor.

Very good...finally a cookie recipe that used ingredients that i REALLY had around, so that i could make them at 11:30 at night (a craving!)  My husband, who hates peanut butter (european), loved these cookies.

These didn't seem to taste very peanut buttery but were good. The dough had a great consistency to it, it was great for rolling out and cutting shapes out. The girlfriend o meter tells me more peanut butter would be required on a future attempt with these but otherwise they were good.

These cookies were not sugary enough and sticky.So I added about a cup of sugar. And instead of making the dough in to a cookie type, I just put the dough in a big cooking sheet so the dough could be half of inch thick. After 15 min on 350 ', I cut the dough on squares and it was fabulous.

Tried this recipe and like other reviews..it is VERY BLAND..after my husband taste tested the first ones out of the oven I decided to add more peanut butter (about 1/2 cup) and they tasted much better! Otherwise, the recipe is easy and I like using the honey instead of so much sugar like other recipes.

I just made these today. They have way to much flour in them and are Cake like. Im going to have to recommend less flour & more peanut butter, they didnt have much taste at all.

As others have also reviewed... the final batter was too sticky/thin to be formed into balls.  I chose to pour it in a brownie pan and bake it this way. The end result, bland, dry.  I agree that the honey is probably what messes with the consistancy.  I'm sticking with brown sugar!

They tasted really bland, didn't have much of a peanut butter flavor, and had too much flour. It was alright but I don't think I will make this recipe again.

I agree with a lot of the other reviewers. The first batch I made of these was very bland. I didn't even put as much honey in as the recipe called for. I only put in 1/3 cup instead of 2/3 cups, and I supplemented more sugar in its place. The batter tasted good, but once it was baked, it was pretty much flavorless, except for a strong honey taste. So I added another cup of sugar and a bunch more peanut butter to the remaining batter. That batch tastes better, but the honey is still very powerful, so they don't really taste like peanut butter cookies (which is what I was craving). I think using brown sugar would be better! But considering I didn't have any brown sugar on hand, this was an OK alternative.

I added a little extra peanut butter - crunchy at that - and they still turned out bland.  Nothing to write home about, and I'll try another recipe next time.

I usually share what I bake... Not this one.  These are dry, bland, and not what I grew up cooking.  The honey was different which may be what is wrong with this recipe.  I'm going to search for my grandmother's recipe because those actually rise and spread.  These DO NOT.  I also had to turn my oven 15 degrees lower and reduce the time.  I do not recomment this recipe.

They are good!:) I really liked them!I enjoyed they! If you want to change the recipe than do what I did! Instead of baking sheets use tin foil! Also don't use honey and add a little more sugar!:p

These cookies ended up VERY bland and dry, trying to save something that was first too thin and sticky. When I mixed all the ingredients together and tried to roll them into a ball, the mixture just stuck to my hands and spread ALL over - it was extremely sticky - I'm guessing it may have been all the honey. I thought that I had done something wrong and re-read the ingredients and directions over and over, but I hadn't. - I ended up having to add more flour to get a better texture and, of course, coating my hands in flour, but in the end - that made them very bland and dry. They mainly just tasted like honey and flour - I couldn't taste any PB. If something is going to have over 200 calories - it BETTER taste good and my peanut butter cookie rocks were not. As an FYI - I bake all the time, I am experienced at baking cookies. But, I'm at a loss w/this one.

I haven't even eaten them yet! I'm in my kitchen, and they're in the oven. But the batter was delish and I'm pretty confident. I just added a pinch of cinnamon!

Excellent cookies...these were a big hit! They stay nice and soft, too. I used crunchy organic peanut butter. 1 batch made 36 cookies.

Not very peanut buttery. Smelt like peanut butter, but didn't taste it enough for a hardcore peanut butter lover.  Others I shared them with loved them.  I used chocolate chips to add some flavour.

I liked the taste of the batter...I thought the warm cookies were 'so-so', but after they had cooled and sat in the cookie jar for a few days, these just kept getting better!  I say, leave them alone and let them age for at least a day before you eat them.

The recipe just needed to tell how much vanila to use.  I think it needs a little more peanutbutter flavor and it'd be perfect.  Excellent for a quick fix on a cookie craving.

I made these because I had nothing better to do and I'm 18 so I saw the bad comments about how it tasted bland so I put extra peanut butter and a banana and it fix the un balance of the favors

The only change i made was to use fresh, natural honey. The recipe certainly could not be rolled into balls. It was very very soft, almost like icing. So I couldn't use the fork method either. I test baked a few first to see if they would spread, using a #24 scoop. They kept their shape for not being pressed flat, ending up about 2 inches diameter. I tried one after 15 min out of the oven, not that impressed, so I waited until the next day to try them. They are ok. A very subtle peanut butter flavour, texture is much like gingerbread. I probably would not make these again.

This recipe was a lifesaver !  We were in the middle of nowhere in a hunting cabin with limited ingredients and the closest store over an hour away!   I had everything on hand to make these and they turned out great!!  I made them a bit smaller to make more (this recipe made 4 dz small cookies).   Thank you so much!!

I was disappointed in these cookies.  Not traditional peanut butter cookies; not flavorful and were more cakelike.  Maybe more peanut butter would improve the taste?

I just used this recipe a moment ago. I was very disappointed with the outcome of this recipe. The cookies were extremely bland. I love sweet cookies.  These were so tasteless.  I didn't realize the ratio of sugar to the flour or I would've added a lot more sugar.  I just sprinkled sugar on them but I don't know that it's going to help. I don't think I'll be sending this treat to the neighbors. The texture and consistency of the cookie was good. This recipe is like ordering a pizza but all you get is the crust!

These cookies were so easy to make and are delicious! I am a horrible baker and wanted a recipe that wasn't too difficult. This was it! My family gobbled them down and we'll definitely make them again!

these cookies were not my favorite. I thought that they could be a little more sweet this may sound weird but after I took them out of the oven I drizzled some hershey's chocolate syrup and ithought it made these cookies much better with the heshey's syrup I give them a 4!!!!!

I give this recipe 3 stars because although VERY quick and easy to make, they were also bland.  Hubby and I (both big peanut-butter fans) were expecting much more of a PB taste than we got.  However, I just cooked them tonight, and will save the rest until tomorrow to see if they get more flavorful, as has been suggested.

15 minutes was way too long for these little guys...after the first batch came out black on the bottom, I reduced the heat to 325 and only cooked for 12 minutes.  They seemed to look better, anyway.  I'm not sure what it is, but these cookies taste like they're missing something.

This was a good cookie recipe. It was really easy to make. At first I thought the cookies would be too sweet because of all the honey but it(the honey)was actually very well blended with the peanut butter.

Could be a little bit sweeter, and will sprinkle with powdered sugar after baking next time. Also need to know how much vanilla to use.
