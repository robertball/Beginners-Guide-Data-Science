I made this to add to fudge, and it worked wonderfully!  The texture was wonderful and the taste was so similar to the jarred stuff.  I followed another review and added less vanilla, but thought it was too strong of a powdered sugar taste without the full measure of vanilla.  I also beat it for about 7 minutes before adding the powdered sugar, and it was perfect!  Thank you for a great recipe!  I would use it in a heartbeat again.

YUM!  I have never made marshmallow creme before.  I do believe I should have mixed it a little longer but it was perfect for spooning over our favorite ice cream.  Hubby was really impressed!  I will be making this again but I will cut back on the vanilla extract, personal preference.  Thanks for sharing moaa, you have a winner here!!

This is a good, easy recipe. A tip if you didn't plan for the egg to get to room temperature ahead of time is to place the egg in warm (not hot) water for 5 minutes. This method worked perfectly for me more than once. I did as other reviewers recommended and blended high for 7 minutes followed by the addition of 3/4 cup confectioners sugar. The sugar amount initially confused me because, but I found it worked with the sugar spooned into the measuring cup. Also, I agree with the one reviewer that found the vanilla extract amount in the original recipe to be a bit much. I think it may depend on the quality or freshness of your extract perhaps? Mine was just opened. In any case, I began putting in 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract at a time when blending and found that 3/4 tsp was perfect.

easy, made this today as part of my holiday gifts & to use instead of frosting on mini muffins. took the advise of friend who questioned using raw egg white & bought pasteurized egg whites in containers from grocery store. came out great, found that if you waited little while before handling it was not as sticky. put in small jelly jars, only draw back is that it needs to be refrigerated.

I made this with dried egg white powder  to use in a fudge recipe, and it worked perfectly. I keep dried egg whites in my pantry. Not only are dried egg whites completely safe to use in uncooked recipes, they whip up faster and higher than fresh and save the hassle of using leftover egg yolks. Pasteurized egg whites do not whip up as well as fresh egg whites (which whip up second-best after powdered dried egg whites). Be sure to bring egg whites to room temperature, and wipe out the mixing bowl with lemon juice or vinegar so that it's absolutely grease-free. Always use glass  or metal bowls to whisk egg  whites.  Add a little bit of something acidic (cream of tartar, a few drops of lemon juice) to help the egg whites to whisk up high and fluffy.

this didn't work at all for me.Added an extra 2 minutes mixing and it never once doubled in size. kept mixing, but still nothing happened, so I figured that was as big as it would get and added the powdered sugar. added the vanilla once it was mixed and turned my mixer off. it was runny and tasted like don't glaze. won't be trying this again.

Super fast, delicious, and fun to make. Also very easy. It yielded 2.5 cups for me and I ended up whipping the egg mixture for closer to 7 minutes. It came out really tasty for ice cream and grilled fluffernutters. I probably won't buy it from stores ever again. Thanks for the recipe!

Same thing.. maybe it was because the whites were too cold.. but I suspect that maybe they forgot to add a stabilizer for the egg whites (cream of tartar).
Might try again using that to see if the results vary.

I made this a few weeks ago with granulated sugar (since I didn’t have confectioners sugar) & I put it in the blender so that the sugar could become thinner & it was DELICIOUS! I listened to what everyone else said & put less vanilla extract. However this time, I made it with the confectioners sugar & I just don’t find that it tastes the same! I think the sugar really makes a big difference. It’s still really good, but not AS good & I had to put more vanilla extract this time. So for others who try this recipe, I would tell you to try with regular sugar, blend the granulated sugar so that it becomes thinner & mix that in! Of course though the texture is a little different! With regular sugar you’ll feel the mini lumps & with the confectioners you won’t. I just found it so delicious though! I put some on graham cookies with 3-4 chocolate chips & popped it in the microwave & it was DELICIOUS!

Good and easy.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I didn't have any light corn syrup so had to use a darker one, which I happened to have on hand.  It still came out white but I can taste it the stronger syrup.  However, that's my fault and I'm not going to down rate the recipe because of something I elected to do.  I went ahead because I needed the creme for another recipe - I'm glad not to have to go the store.  Thanks to the poster for this recipe. I will be using it again.

I substituted the corn syrup and sugar to a couple of teaspoons of Molasses and a little salt and mixed and mixed. It turned into a fluffy meringue type of mixture. Very good!!

I made this today, It turned out perfect.  It was my first time making my own I usually buy it.  I added butter flavoring instead of vanilla as I only had the brown and didn't want it to turn it to off white.  It tastes great and is nice and thick. Followed the instructions almost exactly, Did beat a little longer before I added the sugar.  Also I took the eggs right out of the fridge, no need for room temp if you have a good mixer.
TIP:  I always test it with a fork and make sure there are strong peaks before I add sugar.

My family and friends love this! It is not hard to make and will last in the fridge for a couple weeks. We have used this on ice cream, brownies, cakes and fruit. My only issue is I do not want to use corn syrup ever and I have to go against my conscience to make.... I would love to know if anyone has found a substitute that they liked and worked well in this recipe.

Yum yum!!  I cut the vanilla to 1 teaspoon, however.  2 1/4 t. seemed a bit much, but adjust it to your individual taste.

This is a great recipe.  We were out of Marshmallow and I had a hankering for a hot fudge sundae. I used a little less sugar so that it wouldn't get too thick and it turned out perfectly. I will never buy store bought for sundaes again.

I've been making homemade marshmallows for years without any failures but, of course, I have to cook the syrup mixture. So when I saw this "no cook" marshmallow creme recipe I had to try it. Total flop. Followed the recipe & instructions exactly, & it's still runny. Tastes fine, but more of a runny sauce. Not marshmallow creme for sure. I'll stick to the cooked versions from now on.

Wow!!! I was skeptical about this no cook recipe but with so few ingredients needed I figured what the heck. I put my egg in hot water for a few minutes to be sure it was warm enough, that is key. The whites  and corn syrup whipped up in about 3 minutes with my kitchen aid. My kids were mesmerized at the process. Then I added the other ingredients and wowsa! After we all tasted it I dropped in a block of softened cream cheese and made the best fruit dip ever. This is a keeper for sure.

Outstanding!!! Better replacement for the store bought stuff. This fluff is so good I can eat it right from the jar! We’ve used it with peanut butter sandwiches, as an ice cream topper, and as a layer cake filling. This is real thick, and difficult to spread. Froze cake layers, then put large mound in the center and spread outward with frosting spatula. We make this recipe easily once a month.

Texture was amazing, but recipe is way too sweet. I used two egg whites, which made it fluffier. I put the two refrigerated eggs in a bowl of lukewarm water for about an hour. I will have to tame the sweetness down with another batch with no sugar. I would say no more than 2 tablespoons of confectioners sugar for this recipe.

This recipe is wonderful. I had a fear of the egg white since I use fresh eggs (straight out from underneath my girls),  but no problems. I doubled the recipe thinking a single would not be enough...Wrong! Going to pipe it into a cake and enjoy!

I did this in a glass bowl, can't imagine it working in plastic. Thank you for this recipe! I needed Fluff for a recipe but forgot to get it at the store and didn't want to go back out. This stuff worked perfectly.

I absolutely adore this recipe! I was using marshmallow fluff as frosting for some s'mores cupcakes I made, but I ran out. I had to find a substitute quick. It took a while to find the perfect recipe as I had no cream of tartar. When I finally found this, I was ecstatic! I read a few reviews and went along with the egg in warm water trick; it worked perfectly! I also used the water bottle method for separating the yolks and whites. Anyways, I followed the recipe exactly. Everything was going great, until I realized I only had regular vanilla. I wasn't too happy since I feared the off-color vanilla would ruin the bright white of the fluff. Luckily for me, though, the opposite happened! I was so surprised to find out that the vanilla I used did not affect the color of the treat at all! I guess it depends on what brand you're using, but if you don't have any clear vanilla on hand, try using regular; It might just work! Thanks so much for the recipe! I know I'll never buy marshmallow fluff from the store again!

I’ve never made marshmallow crepe before - but I sure will make this again! It’s much better than store bought - and very easy to make. I followed the recipe but used 2 teas. Pure vanilla. Next time I’ll cut the salt to 1/8 teaspoon. Thank you All Recipes.

Excellent recipe!  Worked perfectly the first time.  I added two tablespoons of organic brewed coffee at the same time as the flavoring and made them coffee flavored.  Yum!!

Yumm. Made recipe exactly as stated. Turned out delicious! I whipped my egg white mixture till medium peaks, then folded in the powdered sugar and vanilla. This cream is a great blank canvas for other flavors. Instead of all vanilla, next time I’ll try peppermint or maple! Mmm

I didn't like this one.  It tasted like corn syrup despite my adding more vanilla to it.

This recipe was super easy, I made the marshmallow cream to go in frosting, and it turned out beautifully.  We needed to color the frosting, and it held up very well. I will definitely use this recipe again.

It's a great recipe! It turned out great, and tastes amazing! You do not have to beat with an electric mixer,  you can just use a whisk. It was a little runny,  so I added more powdered sugar, and that helped a lot. Love this recipe!

I added a 1/4 tsp of almond extract and about 1.5tsp of vanilla. Perfect! If you want it a tad thinner for dipping fruit easier, add a splash of milk!

Used this recipe as a base, used a small bit of nutmeg as suggested by another viewer and after mixing all, added orange juice until it was just a bit thinner. The taste was awesome!!! The recipe as is, before nutmeg and oj, for me resembled Fluff, which in and of itself is wonderful but not what I wanted for my fruit dip. Thanks for a great recipe and a great base for my fruit dip.

Excellent recipe. Made as is and it was great. Also made with brown sugar and loved that too.  Next time, I might add some creamed cream cheese at the very end.

Made it for frosting a brownie with some chocolate frosting to create a swirl effect. It whips up very quickly though it must be at high speed before you see much volume increase. Added a quarter cup more icing sugar to make it thicker. Definitely better than the store bought stuff.

I have made this recipe a couple of times now.  I double it easily as it doesn't last very long around here. We actually like it better than the store bought stuff because it is made with all natural ingredients and no preservatives.  Also I can adjust the amount of sugar I add to it.

I needed marshmallow cream for a recipe and found this gem of a recipe. I always have these ingredients on hand and this was so very easy to make. I won't have to remember buying marshmallow cream ever again.

Really Good! Just made a little too much than what I needed. ???? It doubled while mixing it, making WAY too much. Easy to fix though!! ????
