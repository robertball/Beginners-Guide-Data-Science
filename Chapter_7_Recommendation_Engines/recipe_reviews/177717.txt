Good basic, Italian bean stew recipe. I was surprised the directions didn't mention soaking the beans first, but perhaps it was assuming you'd know that.  I soaked 16 oz. of mixed beans (pinto and gr. northern) overnight, and added a can of red kidney beans when I drained the beans in the AM.  10 c. of broth would have been too much for a stew; I used about 7 1/2 cups.  I also added 1 med. chopped onion, 1 minced clove of garlic, some chopped fresh mushrooms, and 1/2 tsp. dried basil.  Yummy with fresh Italian bread on the side!

This soup is wonderful and very easy! I used dry pinto beans and dry baby lima beans and soaked them 8 hrs. I threw the soaked beans, the sausage (I used chicken sausage), 3 chopped carrots, 2 chopped stalks of celery (for a little extra veggies), the sun dried tomatoes and chicken broth in a pot and cooked it. (I actually used my pressure cooker and it was done in 10 mins.) When it was done I added a can of kidney beans, drained. The flavor was amazing and I didn't add anything extra.

My hubby and I thought this was pretty good.  I wasn't really that crazy about the sundried tomatoes in it.  They have a sweet taste to them that we thought didn't really go with it.  We both agreed that if we make this again that diced toms would work better.  I did add a pretty large head of chopped kale about 20 minutes before it was done.  Thanks for the post.

this was a great staple type recipe to get started. I used red kidney beans brown beans and green broad beans, I also added a couple dashes of sage, a splash of EV Olive oil and a dash of oregano to give it some smokey depth. I was quite delighted with the end result - I will use this again! mmm- perfect for the change of summer into fall in canada!

Very good. I didn't have pinto beans, so I used black, navy, and kidney beans. Other than that, cooked it right to the recipe. It's a great stew. very hearty, very tasty.

This is a fantastic recipe. I used far too many beans so mine took FOREVER. I did have to soak them overnight and even then they weren't anywhere near soft enough to cook - even all day. I cooked for five hours on high and then another three or four. I did add the sausage, but then ham and some leftover chicken. I added onion in addition to the other vegetables. I found that 16 ounces of chicken broth was more than enough. I used the loose pork sausage instead of the kind in the casing - and boy is it spicy. An outstanding recipe.

This was really enjoyable. I tried making a mixed bean soup recipe before and it didn't turn out so great so I was glad to find this recipe. I used a 15 beans mix I had and it was lovely, great flavor.

I never cooked anything with beans before. I got this recipe in an email from Swansons. They say nothing about soaking the beans. After slow cooking this all day, we're having soup and grilled cheese for dinner.
