I love homemade soups on cold days. This soup is not only quick and easy but also full of flavor. I made it with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving instead of chicken and it was excellent. Enjoyed by all!

This soup is deceptively simple as many wonderful recipes often are.  I am an experienced cook but was looking for something really quick yet hearty to make with gnocchi.  I came upon this recipe and decided it was perfect and instead of tweaking it like I usually do, I actually decided to make it exactly as directed. I enjoy gnocchi cooked longer, past actually being done  so it's fluffier and this was the perfect vehicle to do that.  I just made this tonight for my daughter and myself and we both thoroughly enjoyed it and finished every last drop!

This soup tastes wonderful and  is quick and easy when you have some leftover chicken that you want to use.  The only problem with the recipe is that the gnocchi is typically sold in one pound containers.  The one and a quarter cup of gnocchi is less than the pound that I had to buy.  Unless you have an idea of what to do with the remaining gnocchi, I would up the servings to best fit the one pound of gnocchi you will need to buy.

The only change I made was to substitute chicken stock for the water.  I doubled the recipe which made LOTS of soup - too much for us.  My husband is diabetic and the soup sent his blood sugar into orbit.  We couldn't understand why, so I did a little internet research.  Turns out that the longer vegetables are cooked, the more glucose they release.  I had simmered my soup for about an hour.  When I make this again, I will cook the vegetables separately and add them just before serving the soup.  Thank you for an easy and delicious recipe.

I found this while looking for great tasting soup on a cold winters day. I adjusted it just a bit by adding mushrooms, smoked sausage, and spinach. It is so yummy!!!! Served it with telera rolls.

Forgot to rate this - yummy soup I used hominy instead of corn and my grilled chicken was spicy so those spices made the soup taste great

Delicious soup! I sauteed my chicken with some garlic, then added in the green onions and cooked all through. I added remaining ingredients in stages (I used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes because that is what I had). Everyone enjoyed very much.

I found it a little bitter, though I substituted peas for the corn to reduce the starch level a bit. Maybe corn would have sweetened it up.

I used Johnsonville Three Cheese Italian Chicken Sausage in place of the chopped chicken because I thought it would be a nice change-up in the soup.  The flavor profile of the chicken sausage was perfect with the other flavors in the soup.   I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes that gave it a subtle heat in the background.  It was very hearty and perfect on a chilly Fall night.   It had a touch too much thyme for my family's taste, but, that is an easy fix.  The gnocchi was a nice change from the typical pasta that is usually found in soup.   I would make again with a few minor changes.  Thanks for the recipe!
