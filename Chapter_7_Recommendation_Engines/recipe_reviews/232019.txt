Excellent. Was a big hit in my house. Used a bit too much cheese, but will use proper amt next time. Fast, simple and good!

My husband hates casseroles, but was blown away on the taste of this dish.  I wrote down this recipe to share with our sons.  They do most of the cooking in their homes and I know that they will enjoy this dish very much!!!

This was delicious.  Was afraid of not enough flavor so I added 2 tsp of chicken bullion.   Grandson who is 24 loved it.  Next time I will add more broccoli, cause we love it.

Like anything, I take a recipe and do what I can with it with whatever I have on hand. I used frozen broccoli (steamed In the bag) and butter not Country Crock. Sorry Country Crock. Also I seasoned my chicken tenders (instead of breasts) when I cooked them. I didn't have panko so used Italian bread crumbs. AND, I used cheddar, marble jack, and two other cheeses I had on hand - Irish kerrygold  Dubliner and a flavored cheese with garlic. ALL my ingredients came from ALDI, including the cheese. Honestly it turned out delicious. I eat low carb, so 1/4 bread crumbs was perfect for me.

This recipe is tasty but I must remember to keep the broccoli covered in sauce. I don't like the flavour of roasted broccoli.

Very delicious, had to make my own panko bread crumbs last minute, but after reading reviews I also crushed some french's fried onions into the mixture, I also blanched my chicken with seasonings in order to step by the reviews of blandness.. Overall great casserole!!

I listened to other comments about this being bland so I added Italian seasoning and garlic powder and cut back on the onion powder. The family loved it!

this recipe is very, very good. I seasoned and boiled 2 pieces of chicken breast (about a pound) and later proceeded as the recipe called except for adjusting the salt to my taste as I cook with little salt. My husband loved it very much and is definitely a keeper! At the moment I did not have Panko at home but used plain flavor bread crumbs instead and it came out good. Just keep an eye a lot closer, because the casserole may dry out faster when using bread crumbs for the topping.

This was good. I just used broccoli and left out the peppers. Used unsweetened almond milk and added a little extra flour. Threw in onion powder and garlic powder, dried minced onions, celery salt and some thyme for seasonings. Instead of panko I put a can of crescent rolls on top instead and then the cheese.

I used a diced onion in place of powder. Sauteed all fresh vegetables and the chicken in olive oil and garlic while seasoning generously.  Then I followed the rest of the  recipe. Will make again and again.

I added some spice (garlic, salt, a bit of nutmeg, and white pepper). I followed the recipe in terms of cooking time & temperature and mixing the flour with the milk, etc. The sauce was too thin for my taste and it was still a little on the bland side after adding seasoning. Next time, I'm going to make a cheese sauce on the stove the way I would for broccoli cheddar soup, add chicken & veggies, put it in a casserole dish, and bake with a nice crumble topping.

I loved it, but my man didn't.  I made a mistake but it was still good(I forgot to put the milk/flour along with the other stuff on the stove), so I poured it on top on the dish.  I chose not to put the butter with the bread crumbs, I didn't think it was necessary.  I will make this again for sure!

Really good!  I'm glad I added spices to it though. I seasoned it with garlic, Italian spices, black pepper and salt and used Italian panko crumbs instead if plain. I also use frozen broccoli and cauliflower because it's what I had on hand.  Served it with rice and got rave reviews even from my 5 year old!

I would make this one again. I did season the veggies and chicken and made recipe with shredded Monterey Jack (not low fat) and real butter. My calorie count was 525 per serving with my ingredients. Like that it is simple, quick and fairly low carb. Good recipe!

I was worried from reading the reviews that it would come out bland but quite the opposite. There was no instruction on how to cook the chicken so I fried it in some butter and minced garlic with some salt and pepper. That could have made the difference I'm not sure. I also added pepper when sautéing my vegetables. Came out really good, I'm definitely making this again. Good way to get my kiddos to eat their broccoli.
