This dip was awesome.  It tasted like a nutty version of hummus.  I saved time by buying unsalted, pre-roasted sunflower seeds from the bulk food store.  The first time I made it as is, and I thought the raw onion was too strong.  Next time, I left out the onion, and substituted the water for olive oil for more flavour.  It was awesome!

This was great.  I found it needed a touch more lemon juice and a small clove of garlic extra.  I have also added a little black pepper from time to time.  BUt it is great, i use it where I work to make snacks for the employees..thanks Sue, great job!!!

I found my mixture to be a bit dry so I added Maple yogurt to the mixture.  This spread is yummy and can be doubled as a dip.

My adult daughter's a vegan, so I'm trying to get with the program, but this recipe epitomizes why I have often had issues with vegetarian/vegan cuisine.  I disagree with the reviewer who said it had too much bite.  It's very bland and paste-like.  I'm really going to think about how I might tweak it if I were to make it again.  Certainly more celery and onion, as well as other fresh veggies to give it the texture and flavor good vegan/vegetarian food can have!

I like this! I had almost forgotten to add the lemon juice, then saw it sitting on the counter as I was sticking the spread in the refrigerator, so quickly added it.  That is what really makes the spread work!  I loved the chopped celery and onions with the smoother other ingredients.  Thanks!

With a good bit of tweaking this came closer to 5 stars, but the combination of raw onion and that much lemon created such a bite that I had to spend a lot of time adjusting the flavors.  I ended up adding olive oil and plain yogurt to get it more the consistency of hummus, and it was great.  Loved the nuttiness of the sunflower seeds, so it was a great change of pace!

I love sunflower seeds so I decided to make this.  The outcome was ok, but a few things.  I felt that the recipe was not clear on some things.  For instance, do you use unsalted or salted sunflower seeds?  If you do use salted, as I did, it will become too salty.  I wish I had tasted the paste and added the soy sauce ONLY if necessary.  On the celery stalk, do you use the celery including the leaves?  I omitted the leaves out until the end to see if I would need to add it in.  It did need the whole celery WITH the leaves, maybe even a bit more.  I felt the paste needed more lemon juice than called for, maybe even a full cup.  This may be due to the recipe being too salty though.

I love it! On toast this is so good. I didn't have any celery so I added some leek instead and extra garlic. I'll be making this again and again.

Bland.  The flavor is entirely unmemorable.  I won't be making this again.

Hubby did not care for this recipe.  Awkward combination of flavors and textures  between hummus and peanut butter.

I came here to get some simple and practical recipes. This one is a big hit! I'll use it as a veggie dip, and on sandwiches for my hubby.
I halved the recipe and forgot the water, but did put a splash of olive oil. I'll play with it next time. I might add some extra lemon, and maybe some cilantro.
This is a winner!
