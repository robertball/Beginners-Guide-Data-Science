I did not have all the ingredients - I used long grain rice in place of red rice and horseradish sauce in place of the horseradish.  I had fresh beets from my garden and was excited to try them - This recipe didn't disappoint.  I went easy on the dressing and stored the remainder - I've been able to add additional rice, beans, beets, etc. and more sauce as needed.  Very flavorful summer salad.  Thanks!

I made this basically as is with a couple of substitutions with what I had on hand: brown rice, garbanzo beans, and green onions. Colorful and delicious!

I was surprised how tasty red rice is, the beets, radishes and kidney beans keep with the color scheme and taste great together. I will make this again, I substituted horseradish mustard for the Dijon mustard and the horseradish.  The volume of cooked rice is more than what is needed.

I am giving this 4 stars because my husband really liked it.  It is a very healthy salad, but I just didn't like it.  I followed directions to a T on this with no modifications.  It was too much red for me.  It was a ton of work too, and just didn't wow me after all of the prep work it required. I am not a lazy cook either.   Off to make something that has the wow factor for both of us:) I will leave this one to the folks who seem to enjoy it.

The amount of horseradish seemed a bit much, so I cut that in half. I added garbanzo beans because the picture had them. This was an excellent salad. (I didn't have red rice - I used white). I will definitely make this regularly.
