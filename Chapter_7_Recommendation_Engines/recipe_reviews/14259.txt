This is sooo good!  It always gets rave reviews.  I like to add the dressing just before serving, because it does tend to get soggy.

I bring this salad to every potluck I go to and everyone always asks for the recipe. I sometimes alter the recipe to make it different, by adding a little sesame oil and using different vegetables. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

Good.  However, I think that you could definitely let the flavors meld together longer with the sauce than just the 1 hour before.  Also, I added water chestnuts and omitted bean sprouts- which was a good call for our family.  Lastly, I would add more garlic to the sauce, lessen the amount of celery and green onions- since those two veggies somewhat overpour the dish.  But other than that it's a very tasty rice dish.  Will definitely try again with a few changes.

I omitted the spinach and upped the rice to 1c. When I added the oil/soy sauce/garlic mix-even with all the veggies/rice-it was too salty and oily for me. I then cooked another cup of rice..let cool and then added it.  This gave it a neat effect b/c the soy sauce mix had already "darkened" the rice I had mixed in and the addition of the new white rice gave it a neat look.  Now, with the 2c cooked rice, it was much less salty and I was able to enjoy it better.  However, not my favorite salad recipe, but still a nice idea and change from the norm. Thanks Teri.

Simple and delicious.  I used white and wild rice instead of just white.  A new classic!

My husband just stated that this is his new favorite salad. I made this exactly as printed, except I didn't add bean sprouts (couldn't get them) and I shortchanged the vegetable oil so that I could add 1 Tbsp. sesame oil. I found it a little salty. Next time, I'll either use less soy sauce and add a touch of rice vinegar, or I'll use kecap asin, which is very similar to soy sauce, but has a touch of sweetness.

Absolutely delicious!  I served it with grilled tuna steaks and sourdough, it was a total hit.  Everyone had additional helpings and kept commenting how yummy it was!

I made this for a women's luncheon.  Everyone asked me for the recipe.  Not only is it delicious and healthy, it's also a nice change from your average green salad or pasta salad.

Lots of chopping, but it is worth it!  I don't have very good luck cooking rice that is not Minute Rice but even though my rice got clumpy, it separated out nicely once in the salad.  Very refreshing summer fare!

I made this salad with wild rice rather than white - it's healthier and makes a better presentation at a party. I wasn't that dazzled by the taste - the flavoring is almost purely that of soy sauce. Maybe a dash of sesame oil and a little sugar would have helped. At any rate my guests liked it and three asked for the recipe. However, I'm still looking for a more complex group of flavors.

This was OK.  I did use brown rice instead of white rice though.  We ate it but my husband thought it was a little oily.  Even after my husband's comment, I added just a LITTLE toasted sesame oil for flavor, as I thought it needed a little zip.

Great salad! This recipe is perfect the way it's written. It was colorful. The soft and crunchy items went well together. The soy sauce dressing complimented the salad ingredients. Excellent!

I was looking for recipes that have lots of vegetable yet not cooked. And this is the perfect one. 

I replaced vegetable oil with 1/4 of sesame oil and 3/4 of olive or flexseed oil. (people who doesn't like sesame oil should not do this at home)
And it was great! crunch and feeling pretty healthy afterward!

This is the PERFECT potluck or cookout recipe.  It is pretty, tastes wonderful, and doesn't have to be kept hot or cold.  It is wonderful at room temperature.  I made a few adjustments.  I only used 1 green onion and 1 stalk of celery.  I couldn't find fresh bean sprouts so I used a generous handful of canned bean sprouts.  For the spinach, I used 1/2 bunch, coarsely chopped.  For the garlic, I smashed one large clove then minced it.  I took this salad to a cookout last night and came home with an empty bowl.  I will definitely make this again.

This is delicious, but I think next time I'll tone down the soy sauce a little bit. I also added the juice of one small lime to the dressing to add a little acid to the salad.

Good.  I'll make again, but it wasn't great.  Next time, I'll try to up the heat a bit as I thought it could use some pepper flakes or something.  Nice change, though.

We loved this.  Even my sisters asked me to make this again during their 10 days stay.  We used left over cooked Japanese short grain rice which is stickier than longer grain rice.  So we washed it with water to separate and also wash off some stickiness.  It turned out great and my sisters took back home the recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

There was something off.  I'm living out of the country, so some ingredients were a bit different.  We did put a bit of sesame oil in... and maybe our Spinach wasn't spinach.  I gave this 3 stars to keep it neutral to give the benefit of the doubt.  We couldn't even eat this it was so bad.  Though, my 1 year old loved it (but then again she likes to eat the dirt on the playground).

This recipe was a nice change from the normal rice side dish.  I did half the oil & soy sauce, added some rice vinegar and crushed red pepper flakes for kicks.  It was very good.

This is a very good salad. After reading that some said this needed more time to meld the flavors, but gets too soggy, I mixed everything together the night before EXCEPT the spinach leaves and cashews. I added the last two items the next morning before taking this for a lunch potluck. I might try using 1/4 of sesame oil and 1/4 of olive oil, to give it more flavor. It did seem to have a little too much oil after sitting. I think I might try adding chicken too.

this is a crowd pleaser!  i prepared this for a meat-eating crowd and despite the veggie-ness of it they still loved it thanks to the nice flavor.  it is an easy dish to bring to a gathering because it requires no warming up...and taking valuable oven space.  :)

Yummy, my guests loved it.  I used brown rice instead of white, ommitted the spinach and added chopped carrot.  For the dressing, I used my standby Oriental dressing recipe from the "Oriental Cold Noodle Salad" recipe on this site (adding in 2 TBS of chopped fresh ginger)  Excellent, Healthy and really tasty!

Great salad.  I made per recipe, except omitted Spinach and Bean Sprouts.  Used only 1/4" cup each of soy and oil.  Next time I will add the cashews just before serving, as they got soggy.

This was a perfect sidedish - it got rid of many of my leftover bits and pieces hanging around the fridge.  I modified it slightly to fit what I had but it was still quite good.  :-)

Great salad! Took it to a party last night and everyone loved it. I did make some changes based on our families preferences. I omitted the celery, green pepper, and bean sprouts. I used low sodium soy sauce and added about 1/2 tsp. sesame oil to the dressing. I added twice as much red pepper,  1/2 small can water chestnuts, a few pea pods, and a small can of mandarin oranges. I used only about 3/4 of the dressing - which was plenty for us. I loved the spinach and cashews in this salad. The kids even loved this salad! I will definitely make it again!

I am totally going to make this again!  The changes I made were very minimal: 1) omitted the red pepper and just used an entire green pepper 2) only used about 1/2 cup green onions 3) subbed brown for white rice & upped the amount to 1 cup 4) added in some white pepper and extra garlic powder to the dressing.  I made the salad the day before our deck party and mixed up the dressing in a seperate bowl & let it sit overnight so everything could get to know each other - added it in about an hour before serving it.  Went over very well and alot of people liked that it was "different".  Thanks for sharing!  :)

Exactly what I was looking for as a guidline to a favorite recipe that I once had. I'm not a fan of people who review that didn't follow the exact recipe first...but I had to. This recipe is great, because as long as you somewhat follow portion sizes of vegetables, you can add whatever you want, and the sauce is great. I put peas, celery, onions (or gr.onions), peanuts, mushrooms, and shrimp. mmmmm

This is excellent!  So fresh and yummy tasting.  I reduced the oil a bit, and the soya sauce could stand to be increased slightly, but obviously this is to my taste.  I paired it with Fabulous Beef Tenderloin from this site, and it was a wonderful summer meal.  Thanks for sharing!

I found this light and perfect for the holiday table; I added citrus, ginger, and sesame to dressing. Well done and heart-healthy.

I loved the combination of vegetables and rice, though the spinach does tend to get slimy quite quickly.  I'll be making this salad again, though I'll try to tweak the dressing to give it a bit more oomf.  Adding raisins and gingerroot sounds like a good idea.

One of the best and unusual salads I have tried, a great change of pace! I do use sesame oil rather than vegetable oil, some celery seed and added plenty of raisins--this adds the sweetness and complexity that it needs. Let the dressing sit on the salad for about an hour before serving--it will make the mushrooms and rice much tastier.

Used half light olive oil and half sesame oil. Great combo of veggies...good way to use up bean sprouts that go bad so quickly!

I made this with quinoa, and it was delicious. I love the combination of cashews and mushrooms, and the veggies give the salad a great texture. I omitted the celery, used about half the green onions, and increased the parsley to about 1/3 cup. I also used half the amount of (olive) oil, and I drizzled in some toasted sesame oil. Next time, I'll add a touch of fresh ginger and some water chestnuts, and I'll sub hijiki for half of the spinach, for even more of an Asian flair. This would also be good with shredded cabbage and cilantro--the possibilities are endless!

I read the reviews and suggestions before trying it and did find that halving the oil was a good idea. To spice up the dressing, which I spread before serving, I crushed some ginger, added twice the garlic and a dash of cayenne. It greatly helped, but I only gave it four stars because I feel it's still missing something. When I figure it out, I'll post back. Otherwise, still a good solid recipe in which some vegies are interchangeable.

Fabulous! I took the leftovers to a girls night out the next day - I liked it better the first day but my "chef" friend and ask for the recipe. Even my kids liked this one. I added more veggies than it calls for - but it's so hard to measure and I'm not going to all the trouble of chopping without using. I used a good bit more spinach, but I love it and it's so good for you. I also used lite soy. Thanks for a new family favorite.

I just thought this was OK, but one of my guests particularly loved it.  I used brown rice instead of white, left out the spinach and halved the amount of soy sauce and quartered the amount of oil as it just seemed too much.  It just didn't do it for me...sorry.

I could eat this every day! I cut the oil to 1/4 cup using mostly olive oil then sesame oil to fill to the top. And added lots of extra minced garlic. It was even better when I had some leftover baked chicken thighs to chop up and add.

I've made this salad quite a few times and get rave reviews. It's always nice for a change. I'm never one to follow a recipe exactly and it's easy to change up if you want to.

I simply love this salad! 
For more "deliciousness", add some Thompson raisins ;)
