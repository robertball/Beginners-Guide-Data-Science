Oh-my-gosh, YUM! AND healthy! I took the advice from previous posters’ suggestions and added chopped onion and fresh shrooms.  Also, I didn’t have white kidney beans on hand, so I used red ones.  I have one suggestion (and I only add this because of the folks who have previously given low ratings and negative comments): This is a big boy/girl dish.  If you are looking for an alternative to Sloppy Joes or Buffalo Wings, this may not be the recipe for you.

Delicious!  I added a some a chopped shallot to the garlic, and then my fiance came along and decided he wanted onions so I added some and let caramelize a little before adding the balsamic vinegar.  I also used frozen spinach because thats what I had on hand.  I served it over brown rice.  I will definitely be making this again.

I was impressed by the flavor in this.  I wasn't expecting much, but this was a nice surprise.  I used frozen spinach and added onions.  Easy and uniquely delicious.  This will be a regular for us.  Even my toddlers ate the spinach mix!

In the oil I put in sliced mushrooms and some sweet onion slices. I seasoned the chicken. The recipes is so easy to follow. I made sure to wash the beans and 7oz of spinach. It was so delicious and I paired it with Ratatouille.

Made this for a weeknight meal and it was both quick and delicious. All my family liked it. Followed recipe but selected smaller white beans instead of kidney beans and cut back vinegar to 1/3 cup. Even the leftovers were gobbled up. I will make again for sure.

My fiancée and I have been trying to eat healthier and this was a good change of pace dish, although we made some alterations due to the ingredients we had available.  The first major change is that I didn't cook the chicken as directed.  I have a DIY immersion circulator and had a previously cooked/chilled bag of chicken breasts (2 hours @ 141 F) seasoned with creole seasoning, so I used that.  I heated up the pan with grapeseed oil, added the chicken (preheated for 20 min @ 130 F), put foil over the top, then put a heavy weight on top to "power sear" the breasts for 45 seconds on each side.  I followed the rest of the recipe as directed, except I added shallots, used butter beans (large white lima beans) instead of cannellini, and added a 14.5 oz can of artichoke hearts that I drained, rinsed and quartered.  Let me tell you:  The artichoke hearts were such a fantastic addition that I couldn't imagine doing this dish another way.  I also thought the butter beans went perfect as well.  Overall, I would cook this dish again in a heart beat.

I followed the instructions exactly and thought this was horrible... The chicken had no flavor and the look of the dish is totally unappealing. Will not even attempt to make again...

My Motto: recipes are a guideline.  You must be familiar with your own tastes when tackling a recipe. We pre-seasoned our chicken to our liking than cooked as directed. Midway through, we sampled the sauce and determined it needed a little more salt and added some beef stock to thin it out. I loved the beans and spinach cooked in the dish. Its a great base to a recipe and pairs wonderfully with rice.

Yum.  First time  I made it thought it was delicious...but the chicken needed to be seasoned.. Second time around I cooked the chicken in chopped onion, garlic and a little salt and pepper..made a BIG difference..also I simmered the chicken longer in the balsamic vinegar and soup mix. Second time around, perfection. Served with whole grain rice pilaf. YUM!

Unfortunately, this was not good at all. I followed the recipe exactly and no one in my family enjoyed it. The vinegar was too strong and the it looked very unappetizing. Trying to remove it from my recipe box :-/

This was a good, easy dish.  I followed the recipe exactly as I wanted to be fair when reviewing.  I think next time I will try it with onions based on other reviews and I like to see how many different ways I can use a recipe.  May try it with Marsala as well instead of Balsamic.

Not for me.  I think it would be better to hold off on adding in the beans and spinach to the pan.  Instead serve the chicken over uncooked spinach and rinsed can beans.

Delicious! I altered slightly only because I did not have the correct soup in the house and used Cream of Celery soup and did brown about 1/2 a large onion first.  I also added a small amount of a grated italian cheese mixture on top as a garnish since it is very brown-looking  but it really tasted good on it! My very fussy son tasted it and did not gag (which means he liked it!).

This is not one of our favorite dishes.  It wasn't awful but I think the vingear was a little pronounced for my taste.  Maybe if I try it again I will use 1/4 cup vinegar.

Thank You...for sharing this recipe. My first entree with balsamic vinegar. Of the NINE poor reviews: they either don't like balsamic vinegar-or did not use a high quality balsamic vinegar.  I would not change a thing.

This was okay.  It had an odd taste.  It would have been better with more vegetables (I did use 10 oz spinach instead of 7).

This was pretty good.  I followed the recipe pretty much except I didn't have quite the amount of spinach needed ( this may have made the difference).  I tried to offset my shortage of spinach by adding roasted red peppers which added a little bit of flavor, but overall this was a nice change of pace.

I'm not sure if it was the Golden Mushroom soup (as I have never had it before) but there was a weird tangyness to the sauce, which I really didn't like. The chicken was pretty bland. I served this over brown rice (which was probably the best part!) Not inedible but won't make again.

I stayed true to the recipe but the entire family did not want this again. We didn't think the beans went well with it at all. The chicken didn't have much flavor. If I attempted to do this recipe at all again. I would marinate the chicken awhile before hand in the garlic and vinegar and maybe replace beans with a nut, possibly cashews which would let a sweetness in. The only thing we liked was the spinach part which went well with our white rice.

This is pretty good! I did season the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder before browning it in the olive oil. I also only had regular cream of mushroom and added about 1/4 cup beef broth to make it "golden". I used less spinach too, I think... Just added it to the pan until it looked like enough for me. This is definitely for people who love balsamic as the taste of vinegar comes through quite strongly! I'd debated making this without the mushroom soup, but I like the thick sauce it made and honestly it didn't taste like soup at all. I let it cook about ten minutes after adding the chicken back to the pan and it was nice and moist.

This was a great easy weeknight meal.  I made as written with the exception of a can of water.  The sauce had a gel-like consistency, and I preferred it to be more like a gravey.  My whole family enjoyed it.

Not sure how I feel about this dish. Not a whole lot of flavor. I wish I had sauteed some onion as other reviewers did. I also used healthy request regular cream of mushroom soup so maybe that has made it less tasty. I did season the chicken with garlic and onion powder, however. I used a 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar and should have used a 1/3rd like the recipe called for, I did not find the balsamic vinegar overpowering at all. I think the golden cream of mushroom soup might be key and if I cook this again I won't  substitute because the color otherwise is not that appealing.

Thought this was very good. Used chicken tenderloin instead of breast.  Also, used a good quality balsamic - it makes a difference.  Served over white rice and everyone loved it.

I had high hopes for this, but the flavor was just ok.  The bland chicken was masked by the sauce, but the overall look of the dish was unappetizing.  I couldn't even get my children, who are usually adventurous eaters, to try it.

Great! I didn't have cannellini beans in the pantry, so used a can of no sodium black beans.  Used heart healthy cream of mushroom soup to also keep the sodium down.  Added onion to garlic/oil as suggested by another review.  Also sprinkled some jerk seasoning and red bell/garlic seasoning combo on the chicken.  Yum!

Very good. I only had regular (not Golden) cream of mushroom soup, and I marinated the chicken beforehand in a mix of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Strongly recommend serving with a twisted or bowtie pasta. Next time I may try sprinkling some pine nuts over it.

This was great.  After reading the reviews, I was afraid I would find it bland since I didn't add onion or shallots, but it was very good as is.  I only added salt and pepper to the chicken before cooking and, as others recomended, added a 1/2 cup of water to the sauce--after adding the soup, it was very thick.  I served the chicken with orzo.  Next time I will use a couple more pieces of chicken; I had a lot more sauce/spinach mixture than chicken.  Easy, healthy, and tasty.  A perfect dinner.

I followed other suggestions and added onion, I also added coriander, rosemary, basil, and a little crushed red pepper. I used 1/4 cup balsamic, and 1/4 cup white wine. I was out of beans, so I reduced the sauce and served over linguine noodles.

What a wonderful dish.  I did add onion and mushrooms to the garlic.  I cut the balsamic vinegar with chicken broth, probably half and half because I know my husband doesn't like much vinegar.  He loved it and he's not fond of any chicken breast meal.  A great recipe and it leaves room for you to add your own touches.

I made this tonight for dinner, but changed a few things: First, I cut the chicken up into pieces to quicken the cooking time. Next, I used Cream of Mushroom soup because it was what I had. I also omitted the beans and served it all over pasta. I thought it was great, but the vinegar taste was a little too overwhelming. After adding a little extra heaping spoonfuls of soup, it evened out and everything tasted great. 

Easy and delicious. Healthy too if you use low-fat soup!

Pretty good.  I only used 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar because that's all I had and it was almost too much.  Other than that it is again for my family.

This was okay, the balsamic was too strong for me. Served over orzo.

the taste was ok but just a little weird to me.  my kids seemed to like it.  I think I'll try it with chicken stock instead of mushroom soup next time.

I was please with how easy this meal was to make, and it really is a whole meal. You don't need anything else to go with it! My two toddlers seemed to like it, and finished their plates. The chicken was quite tender. For me, the flavors were a little strange. It was alright, but not one of my favorites.

Really liked this. Did not make any changes and don't think it needed any. Would go good with pork chops too. I would add some mushrooms next time.

Enjoyed this but made a few changes.  Cut back the balsamic vinegar to 1/4 cup and added 1 can of water (sauce was way too thick).  Also, simmered the chicken in sauce for 30 min. before adding beans and spinach to enhance flavor.

Although this is not the most attractive dish, the taste was excellent!  If you are not a balsamic vinegar person, you may not like this - but I thought it was very good.  I did add some seasoning to the chicken and doubled the garlic, otherwise followed the recipe to a T.  This is great recipe for a low-carb dieter...lots of protein!  It was fast too.  Perfect for a week-day meal.

very tasty....to truly coat the chicken you must have small chicken breasts.  I bought 3 large ones and had to improvise with the liquid in order to cover all the meat.

I really liked this recipe. But only used 1/4 cup of balsamic. I was cooking for guests and their children so I didn't want it to be too strong. It has a nice flavor, but you obviously need to like balsamic to enjoy it. I also seasoned my chicken before pan frying.

This really was easy to make and my picky husband enjoyed it. I didn't have Golden Mushroom soup so used Cream of Mushroom soup with an additional 1/2 cup of beef broth. I also added fresh mushrooms. Easy & yummy. Would make again.

This was actually really good.  I was skeptical as I was cooking it and I didn't have to alter a few things, cooking wise but it turned out awesome.  I used Healthy request mushroom soup to cut out the MSG.  I also cut the vinegar back to 1/4 cup.  It was great.

This was absolutely delicious. Once everything was cooked as is, we covered, turned it on low, and let all the flavors blend for a few hours...the house smelled extraordinary, and the flavor was out of this world. Would absolutely make again.

Easy, quick and very tasty! I left out the white beans, added red peppers, feta cheese and a generous sprinkling of Italian seasoning. Also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned soup (we strive for low sodium meals). We will be making this again. :)

This recipe was pretty good.  I had pre tenderized (seasoned) chicken and put black pepper and salt as I pan fried it.  I added a little extra balsamic vinegar and served it on top of spaghetti.  The recipe is good as is for balsamic vinegar but with the spaghetti a little extra vinegar made the meal.

Easily the BEST recipe I've gotten from this site in a really, really long time! Sorry, but I didn't have any Campbell's golden mushroom soup available! I didn't have any mushrooms either, but I followed a recipe for a type of broth similar to their soup. I used about a cup of beef broth, maybe a tablespoon of tomato paste, a little bit of red wine, and a little sprinkling of garlic powder. It was awhile ago that I made this so I don't remember if I added any other spices. I had to cook it longer in order to cook out the alcohol, and I added the spinach at the last minute. I actually let it sit too long so the spinach overcooked and got all swampy-looking and gross, so make sure to serve this immediately!

I gave it 5 stars for a weeknight meal! I served it for a friend, cooked the chicken to the reciped but added salt and pepper to taste. I used onlyh half a can of cream of mushroom and that really adds a nice thickness to the sauce. Other things I did to doctor it up was adding onions, fresh mushrooms, lots of garlic in addition to the spinach. I served with a side of asparagus. It was tasty and quick to prepare. Delish!

This is soooo delicous and easy to make...I will make this again and again...My hubby loved it and it is healthy to boot..We are into eating healthy and this was great...The only simple change was I cooked my spinach in its own garlic in a seperate pan and then served.

I thought this was delicious. I really liked the vinegar flavor. I pretty much followed the recipe except I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, onion & garlic powder. I also added a small onion with the garlic. I served it with some brown rice. Will definitely make again.

This is a great week night dinner.  I substituted no salt chicken broth for the mushroom soup to accommodate a low sodium diet.  I also added 1 tsp of rosemary, and seasoned the chicken breasts with pepper and a little salt.  I put the baby spinach on top of the chicken after it was fully cooked, and gave it just another minute to cook with the lid on, otherwise the spinach would have been way over cooked.

I love all the ingredients this recipe has in it but it was boring. It needs seasoning!! I added thyme and poultry seasoning, used 1/4 cup WHITE balsamic vinegar so it wouldn't look ugly, added onions and mushrooms. I won't make this again.
