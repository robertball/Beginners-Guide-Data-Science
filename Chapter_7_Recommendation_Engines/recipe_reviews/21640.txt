I was hoping for a chili taste but less spicy for the kids.Tasted like manwich sloppy joes with beans. Very sweet and even my kids who like sweet didn't like it. Will not be making again. Sorry.

I used this because I had all these ingredients. I love making chili & trying new recipes. This is VERY easy & my husband absolutely loved it. He talked about it 3 different times! Yes it is sweet because of the chili sauce but it is very good. I only used 1 pound of beef- extra lean of course! Thanks for submitting!

I made this recipe at the daycare I work for and everyone LOVED it! Even I liked it and I don't usually like chili. Terrific recipe!

This wasn't a bad chili recipe but it's sorta an adult thing. My kids hate chili and wouldn't go near the stuff. Thanks anyway.

I enjoyed this recipe! I used yellow peppers in place of green. For serving I added grated marbled cheese, a dollop of sour cream and smashed tortilla chips. I would make this again especially for a potluck. Stick it in a slow cooker on warm and let guests dress it up however they like. Green onions, tortilla bread, tortilla chips, grated cheese, sour cream and some diced avocado, for topping! 
Thank you for sharing!
