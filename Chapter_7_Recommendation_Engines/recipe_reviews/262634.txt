Pretty good and very filling! I used roast salted pumpkin seeds instead of raw because that’s what I had on hand. I maybe would add some Splenda to up the sweetness or perhaps a small amount of dried fruit like cranberries or cherries. I would probably halve the recipe next time, because it was very filling and was a lot of food for breakfast for me. I did follow the layering, but that probably wasn’t necessary.

I thought this was excellent.  I preferred to eat it warm, but like that it was all ready for me when I woke up in the morning.  The only thing I did differently was I skipped the pumpkin seeds because I had forgotten about them.

Very healthy and tasty breakfast. I am lactose intolerant so I had to omit the milk and yogurt and used almond  or soy milk ( whichever one i had) instead.  I made enough so I could finish a whole can of pumpkin and  has enough for a  week. I omitted the maple syrup and  added raisins.
