This weekend is Russian easter. My family (Grandmother and her sisters) traditionally go to church and get their babka's blessed on Saturday. My great aunt used to make them, but since she has passed, no one kept the tradition until this year, a couple of weeks ago I "tested" this recipe out after looking around and sure enough, Grandma approved and said tasted JUST like her sisters...So now I'm stuck making them all day today and tomorrow!! We do it in coffee cans, no liner just greased, and we do not add raisins. We ice it with powdered sugar, corn syrup and a little water and add sprinkles for the kids.

This recipe is wonderful. Very light. If you like Babka, you will like this. Follow step by step and you will have success.  Just like my moms, except she put on a sugary top which I love. Does anyone know how to add that to this recipe?

Wonderful!  It is almost identical to the recipe my Ukrainian Baba (grandmother) use to make.  I like a few more raisins, but the flavor is delicious.  Also, as a warning to the Babka uninitiated...NEVER try to use a mixer (even a heavy duty stand mixer), you will burn out your motor because this is a very thick, sticky dough.

I have made this Babka twice now... away from my grandmother's traditional recipie which no one knows.  I followed this exactly the first time, the second time I added more raisins.  Both times I ended up with three separate loaves - one baked in an angel food cake pan, and two in regular bread pans.  They all turned out wonderful; however, turns out a little on the dry side and not sure how to correct it.

Authentic recipe!  This babka tastes just like the kind you buy at a Polish bakery.

I found the bread to be a little to dry.  It was also heavy.  Flavor was good, next time I will cut back on the lemon zest.  I will try bread flour instead of the all porpuse flour to see if it lightens it up.  May try cutting out second rise.

This was good, my first babka.  Too much work to make on any regular basis.  I also think it should be refridgerated, after only two days (wrapped) it tasted like it may have gone bad.  Must be the eggs.

This babka recipe leaves out a key ingredient---sugar.  Although the recipe does call for sugar in the yeast/water/milk mixture--there is no sugar in the bread/dough part of the recipe.
The babka tasted horrible--like biting into a yeast cake.  I do not understand how  you received any positive reviews.

This was pretty good but it did not have the flavour I was used to from the babka my Mum made. It was also not as light and airy. After looking over the recipe again it seems to me that it could use additional sugar with the eggs and egg yolks and could also use some salt. 
I will make again with these changes and hopefully this will improve the texture and flavour.
