There wasn't enough seasoning or butter to get everything all covered. I think this could have been good had there been more butter/seasoning.

Halloween Party Mix Haiku: "The ratio's off. (There's too much rice cereal.) Flavor's kinda 'meh.'") I love snack mixes, making them, mixing them, sniggling bites of them, so I was happy to try a new one out, but this one disappointed me, mostly b/c there was so much Rice Chex, and the flavor didn't really adhere to the ingredients. I followed it exactly, and did enjoy having the opportunity to have my young daughter measure, pour, and stir, but the seasoning didn't seem to thoroughly coat all the items, so it was more like eating dry Chex w/ a few random goodies tossed in.

I agree with the others, not enough oil to coat the product.  I have made it more like the chex mix with 2-3 of their flavors (versus only rice).  I do like the added goldfish and pumpkin seeds.  Instead of butter though (I have done both) I like to add melted bacon grease.  It gives it a great flavor!

This one is perfect, you can add any variety of things to this & it's always great. I have added 2 kinds of Chex, Kix, Cheerios & the flavor is always excellent, it's very addicting!
