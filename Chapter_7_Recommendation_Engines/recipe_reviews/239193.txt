Go to Chef John's broccoli recipe and cut the stalks as he advises.  They are all equal size, no matter the size of the floweret, so they all get done at the same time.  10 minutes seems too quick to me.  You definitely need the browning which gives awesome flavor.

I pressed the garlic, then combined it with all the other seasonings in the olive oil before tossing with the broccoli, so everything would be evenly distributed.  The florets were turning brown at 10 minutes, so I removed from the oven and sampled.  There was still some "tooth" to it, so I stopped cooking then.  Though I did appreciate the sweetness of the caramelization, I really enjoy plain steamed broccoli.  If you are looking for a change, this may do the trick for you.

After reading the reviews, I lowered the heat a bit, and added the garlic after 8-10 minutes.   Very good!

Garlic Roasted Broccoli Haiku: "'Char' is the best part. Garlic was a little done. Maybe drop the temp?" I think in the end we'll always prefer a simple steamed broccoli w/ butter, salt, and a lemon squeeze, but roasting is a nice change, and we squabble over the pieces that are the brownest b/c they're the best. But w/ this recipe, where some pieces were browned nicely at 20 min., others remained squishy, and the garlic was a little burny. Maybe a lower temperature and stirring more frequently would even everything out. Ohh, I had a lonely squash that needed to be eaten, so I added slices of that too, nothing remarkable, just yellow alongside the green broccoli, and we ate it w/ mashed potatoes and AR's "Mark's Surprise Meatloaf."

Itâ€™s an ok recipe but I absolutely hate the smell and taste of burnt garlic. If you want to add in the garlic, I advise keeping it out of the oven and cooking it ahead of time in a bit of oil in a pan and reserving until the broccoli is finished cooking in the oven.

Very good. Good simple, healthy dish with common ingredients. I turned the broccoli twice during baking and lowered the temp. just a little and cooked 5 min longer. Thanks FPD

I am not normally a major broccoli fan, but I can't get enough of this! Roasting the broccoli is a perfect way to eat broccoli. It's not raw and it's not mushy cooked. Crisp is just right!

This was tasty, but my garlic burnt just as the broccoli was charring. I will watch more carefully next time I make this.

After tossing with olive oil, toss lightly with flour and/or sugar as well. It gives it a nice browned flavor. Even my vegetable-hating 7-year-old really liked it.

Easy and delicious! I've also been using a mix of broccoli and cauliflower and it is equally as tasty.

Very easy and tasty recipe. To accommodate our taste, I increased  garlic cloves to 5 and increased cooking time to 20 minutes. End result, perfection!

Steamed broccoli is just plain yuck, but roasted broccoli is divine! (Clearly, your perspective on this recipe depends on which side of the divide you stand!) I prefer no onion powder at all. Another amazing flavor alternative is to use chopped fresh ginger instead of, or in addition to, the garlic.

Good recipe. I substituted the onion powder with other onion seasoning that I had on hand. I also put more garlic and olive oil than it called for. 
Tip: 
Put all ingredients into a large plastic bag and shake so that all of the broccoli is evenly coated.

I made a few tweaks due to ingredient/time constraints, but this is a simply delicious roasted broccoli recipe.  I didn't have fresh broccoli, so I "par-steamed" a frozen steamable bag of florets and then used paper toweling to remove the excess moisture.  I mixed the sliced garlic, broccoli, olive oil, and spices right on my baking sheet to save dirtying another bowl.  As my broccoli was already par steamed (and the rest of dinner was done) I finished "roasting" by "broiling" for a few minutes to add some color.  This is a super simple and versatile recipe.  THANKS for the recipe!

I liked it way more than the rest of the family, unfortunately (still can't believe they prefer plain ole steamed broccoli!) I found that after 10 minutes, the heads were done perfectly but the stems were still quite tough. By the time the stems were done, the heads were rather mushy. Next time, I'll either remove more of the stem, or, most likely, I'll just reduce the temp and cook them a bit longer. Oh, and a bit more sliced garlic wouldn't hurt either. Anyway, I really liked it. Thanks!
