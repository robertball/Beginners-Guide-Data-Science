The mushrooms are to die for! My guests raved about this one. I would suggest cooking on low longer for more tender meat. Don't skip on the wine and butter!

Excellent! Skipped the mushrooms and shallots because my husband doesn't like them. Worchestershire sauce stunk up the house horribly and I was afraid the brisket was going to be disgusting. But it could not have been better!! Incredibly tender and flavorful. Can't wait to make it again!

Wow!  I followed the recipe exactly except I cooked it in a crock pot for 24 hours on low instead of a dutch oven and it was AMAZING!  The taste was sensational!  The meat just melted in your mouth!  It took some prep work but it was well worth it!  My husband couldn't believe the brisket shrunk so much.  It really didn't that much.  I grazed a bit when it was almost done. lol.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thank you so much for sharing!

OMG this was AMAZING!  I was being a cost-effective shopper and bought a 12.18 pound Brisket - mistake!  Had to brown it in the Dutch oven which was close to impossible b/c it was so big.  But we did it.  I was afraid of using so much Worcestershire.  It just felt weird to dump so much in but I followed the recipe to the T.  Double of course.  OMGoodness!  It was amazing.  Falling apart when we tried to cut it or move it so we just lifted the rack and hoped it didn't fall apart completely.  Success.  It was ridiculous.  Thank goodness I used a ton of mushrooms and 2 large shallots b/c the mushroom mixture is soooo yummy.  Can't rave enough.  Will buy a smaller one next time.  Thank goodness I had a huge Dutch oven or we would have been in trouble.  The Au Jus is also amazing.  Saved a large portion and skimmed off the fat this AM and you don't need to do anything to it but drizzle over the meat and your homemade mashed potatoes (but of course) 10 thumbs up.  My new staple.  I have no doubt it will be a hit at a party.  The only change is - I used butter.  I don't know when I last bought margarine more than 20 years ago for sure. Thanks for the GREAT recipe!

I used this recipe with a slow cooker instead of a dutch oven.  It turned out great.  Instead of a 5lb beef brisket, I bought one that was around  2.5 lb and halved all the ingredients.  I set the slow cooker to low and cooked it for 6 hours.

Great recipe.  Thanks.

made this in the crock pot for passover and it was beyond delicious. i followed everything to the letter except omitted the cayenne pepper. after i sauteed the mushroom and shallots, used the same pan to sear and brown the meat, 5 min per side as suggested adding the worcester sauce. put the meat into the crock pot and then added the remaining liquid ingredients and boiled this down to about half of what i started with. (got scared when i tasted this and found it to be really spicy! not to fear, though, the final product wasn't spicy at all) i added this liquid to the meat in the crockpot, topped it with the mushrooms and butter/margarine and set the meat on low and cooked for 10-11 hours. it was stunningly simple and so delicious that everyone took seconds and thirds.

Wow, I just pulled this out of the oven and took my first bite, and couldn't even wait until after dinner to write my review. This brisket is the most delicious, perfectly seasoned, tender and sensational beef recipe I think a I have ever cooked. I used butter instead of margarine, and had no wine, so was forced to use grape juice instead, and it still turned out remarkable. There's no need to think twice before trying this recipe - it's fantastic!

Absolutely wonderful!  I was looking for a good brisket recipe, and so far, this one definitely takes the cake!  The kick from the cayenne made the meat just a hint spicy, which I prefer, and the mushrooms and onions were absolutely fabulous with the meat.  I ended up making a little too much sauce, so instead of drippings, I had more like a bit of soup.  Turned it into homemade gravy, and it was so good over potatoes and with the meat!  I will definitely be making this one again.

Too salty, and too much cayenne for my family. It was SUPER tender and moist though. I might try it again, but will definitely need to tweak the recipe.

Perfect savory brisket. I used extra mushrooms and shallots and whisked some of the cooking broth with tomato sauce for a more clingy topping. Served with roasted potatoes and french cut green beans - amazing.

Easy to make, so tender it falls apart on your plate!!  Actual flavor of the meat was a little bland, but that may be the cut, or that this is the first time I've ever cooked a brisket!  Will definitely make again for next Hanukkah.  Husband and babies loved it!!

This dish was so delicious that I am compelled to write my first review after many years of enjoying the recipes from allrecipes.com  Some friends of mine were talking about cooking a brisket so I thought I would try one as well. One of the things that surprised me was the 5 hour cooking time! I followed the recipe pretty much as is, but substituted onion for the shallots and used bouillon cubes for the beef broth.  As others suggested, I served it with mashed potatoes and steamed green beans - the sauce was a perfect complement.

This was a fantastic recipe - used it for Christmas Day!

We cooked it in the slow cooker for 14 hours and it was soft, fall apart, tasty goodness!   
Omitted the mushrooms and shallots as people who don't like them and it was STILL amazing! 
Highly recommend a try!  
We also left the spice mix on for a few hours to sink into the meet instead of adding straight away and cooking - flavoursome and delicious! Can't wait to cook it again with the mushrooms and shallots - great recipe!

This recipe is awesome. I've made it a few times and it's always good. If you don't want as much spice kick down the cayenne some.  I have also added bell pepper in there once mainly because I needed to use it before it went bad and it tastes just as good.
 If you don't have red wine use 2TBSP red wine  vinegar. And you should still have enough liquid. If not use a little bit of x-tra broth or water.

This is a great meal for company!  And the mushroom gravy is fantastic.  It makes a lot of gravy, so I froze the leftover and used it for hot roast beef sandwiches and several other things.  My daughter-in-law asked for the recipe, and everyone loved it.  This is definitely a keeper.

This will now be my go to recipe for brisket. Very good!  I was worried about the amount of Worcestershire in the recipe, but I stuck to what it called for and it came out great.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone and would not change a thing.  The hardest part about making this recipe is smelling it all day and not digging into it before it is done!

This was fun to make and we loved smelling it cooking all afternoon!  I made a 3 lb. brisket and it was a little dry.  I had to use foil to cover it so maybe that is why.  The juice was amazing and I will make it again!  Perhaps I can cook it longer at a lower temperature to get the moist result I was hoping for.  Served it with roasted rosemary potatoes on the grill, peas and french bread.

I liked the flavors a lot, and the cayenne spiced it up just right, but did think it was too salty --- I will probably cut the salt in half at least, maybe more.  Otherwise the meat came out great --- moist and really flavorful.  Will definitely try again!

My hubby and I have never cooked a brisket before and used this recipe for a Friendsgiving Party where we hosted for a group of 20.  We bought an 11.5 lb brisket that I halved.  We doubled the recipe except for the Cayenne for people who could be sensitive to spice.  We  cooked it in two slow cookers for 9 hours using the last half hour to let the brisket rest while we thickened the sauce for the gravy........WOWZA!  It was truly a heat!!!  The meat was really good and tender, and the gravy was  awesome.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.   We would definitely make it again!

The taste of the juice it’s cooked in is surprisingly flavorful. It’s only me and my boyfriend here so I used a 3lb beef brisket which was good enough for us and left over for the next day! I felt it would need a few tweaks so this is how I changed it and it was perfect for us: extra garlic gloves! I felt 1 clove for all of that meat wasn’t enough flavor so I added 2 more and minced it. I omitted the cayenne since my bf hates spice. I did not add the entire 16oz beef broth since I was cooking less meat. I added a whole extra box of mushrooms. Mushrooms wilt and disappear so if you like mushrooms and would like to have some with your meat, I strongly advise you to add way more mushrooms!

Awesome!  I was tight on time so I skipped using the rack.  Next time I may cut back on the cayenne pepper for the kids, although my husband loved it the way it was.  Definitely putting this one in the rotation!

I am surprised this recipe does not have more reviews because it's brilliant. We loved it and I will make it again next week. But I made some changes and will make further changes next time. First I used a normal oven proof dish with foil and it worked great. Second, I reduced the salt to less than half the amount. Next time, the sauce is just too much for me so I think it's enough with half the sauce amount for the 5 pounds of meat and I won't put any Cayenne because i dont think the recipe needs the heat from it. ANyway in general it was a great recipe, thanks a lot :)

First time around I followed the recipe to a T except that I halved it for a 2.5 lb brisket and used a crockpot on low for 7 hours. The beef came out fabulously, but the vegetables absorbed far too much of the Worcestershire-heavy sauce and were subsumed by it disagreeably. As there will definitely be a next time, I will adjust the amount Worcestershire for the beef and sauté the mushrooms by themselves. The results of this recipe were largely as good as I had hoped, however. Glad I came across it.

The beef was spectacular. Hubby and I both agreed that it was the best brisket we’d ever had.  I personally though the mushrooms had too much Worcestershire flavor. Next time, I’ll cook them separately and add them at the end.  I was a bit nervous about all that Worcestershire sauce, as most recipes barely call for a tsp, and this one was using an entire bottle, but on the beef, it was truly amazing. I can’t wait to make it again.

I plan to make this recipe for 15 people coming to Easter dinner.  We followed the recipe to a T, except we omitted the ceyene pepper and didn't use a rack.   Oh, I also thickened the sauce with 4 Tbsp of cornstarch.  The sauce nearly covered the 5 lbs. roast when we put it in the oven. The roast finished an hour early.  It was too spicy for our family.  My husband wouldn't touch the gravy because of the spice.  I am going to try skipping the pepper and watering down the Lea & Perrins.  Otherwise, it was incredibly moist and tender; truly we pulled it apart with a fork.  The mushrooms were amazing.

I made this for a rainy day Sunday brunch and it turned out amazing! I made it in the crock pot (10 hours on low), rather than the oven and I added a bit more garlic as we like garlic a lot. We couldn't get enough of this brisquet! Truly finger licking good.

I'll make it again.  It was excellent.  will use less worchester and substitute 1 cup bold coffee with one of the 4 cups beef broth.

No changes, but a bit too spicy.  Next time I will cut back on the cayenne pepper.  I will try it again.

I followed the recipe except I used a 3lb brisket, and cooked it in the crock pot for 9 hours.  It was tender, and delicious!

This was soooo good! I followed the recipe except cut everything in half, as my brisket was only 2.5 lbs. instead of the oven, I used a crockpot and it was great! The only thing I will change next time is cut down the amount of hot spice! I will definitely keep this recipe!

I didn't have any mushrooms or shallots at the time so I skipped the mushrooms altogether and substituted yellow onion for the shallots. I also used a crock pot for roasting. The results were outstanding and I will definitely make again.

I made this recipe; first time cooking a brisket!  It came out so juicy and tender!  Used a pre-packaged gravy mix,  dried onion flakes and fresh mushrooms. It was spectacular! Will definitely make this again & again & again!

This came out really good the way I made it but this recipe,  as it is, is not great. I recommend real butter or bacon grease.

followed exactly, did taste really good just too much sauce and it needed to be thickened. my pan was too shallow and some sauce spilled over into the oven2.5 inch lip. Even with that there still was tone of sauce.

I am actually planning on making this tonight and had a question - if I don't have a rack to put in my Dutch oven, would this be ok if the meat sat in the sauce? Since a lot of people have cooked it in a slow cooker, I assume it wuld work but wanted to see if anyone else has cooked it in the oven with the meat inside the pot, with all the other ingredients. Thanks!
