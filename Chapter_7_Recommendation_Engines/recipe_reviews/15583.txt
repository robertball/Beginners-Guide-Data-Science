My mom used to make these every Christmas. The flavor will be even better if you use lard instead of vegetable oil for frying. Cmon you're frying these anyway no time to think about "healthy". Truly the flavor will notch up two levels.

I was looking for a recipe that my grandma used to make. This suited the bill perfectly. Because I was testing this and had no idea of what they looked like yet I whipped up the batch as quickly as possible and then only cut the dough into strips and didn't make bowties. I also tried some cookie cutter ones they came out ok but I liked the strips better bc they puffed a bit when frying. It tasted similar to a funnel cake without the doughy part.....more like a crispy funnel cake. Since we don't usually have alcohol in the house I used Rum Extract in place of the rum or brandy...I believe you could sub ANY extract in place of that rum/brandy according to your tastes. I bet it would be great with almond extract or ginger extract...I can't wait to try it. This took me less than an hour to make. I still have a bunch of dough to finish up but for two plates it took less than an hour.
