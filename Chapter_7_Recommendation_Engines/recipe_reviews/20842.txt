Easy lemonade recipe.  Very tart though.  I would recommend using more sugar. 3/4 or 1 full cup.

This took too many steps to make and was too tart because of too much lemon juice.

I very much enjoyed this recipe. I love lemonade in general. I did have to add more lemons and sugar, but mostly because I enjoy a more strong lemon taste. Very easy!

I used only lemons and found this to be way too bitter.  I read in another recipe that salt might help, but it didn't noticeably improve the taste.  Maybe the trick is to use oranges and limes, but I'm not anxious to try this one again.

This lemonade was quick and easy but not enough lemon for me.  I felt like I was drinking lemon flavor kool-aid with a lemon added.

Pretty good, just when you're making it on TV, make sure the pitcher is big enough to hold ALL the lemonade, lol. BIG Mistake.

This lemonade was very weak- it needed both more lemons and more sugar.  I added about 1/4 cup extra lemon juice, and it was still weak.  Used all fresh lemons from a friend's tree.

Okay. I added 1 1/4 cup of sugar instead of 1/2 a cup. It will probably taste better when its totally cold.

I'm not really sure why anyone would think this was alot of steps. My kids have been begging me all summer to make lemonade & I have always said no because I was afraid it would be difficult & messy with 3 little ones. This was surprisingly easy & delicious! We did add a bit more sugar, but you can adjust to your personal liking. Thanks for sharing, we will make this often!

Pretty good! It reminded me of powdered instant, which is weird since I followed the recipe. Light, not too sweet, not too tart. I used Santa Cruz bottled lemon juice, which makes it super easy. It went fast!

This was really good. I'd never made lemonade before. I recommend using more sugar than it calls for. Next time, maybe I'll add a little OJ to change it up.

This is the perfect lemonade!  It wasn't too sweet, which I liked, but it wasn't too tart.  I only made about two servings, so I didn't measure out the ingredients.  I used the juice of 1 and 1/2 lemons and roughly 1/2 cup sugar and 3/4 cup water.  Delicious!

this was okay.  it barely had any lemon flavor and not enough sugar.  upped the quantities to 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of lemon juice and that was better.

I have a favorite lemonade on this site, but I wanted to try a new one. I didn't care for the ratio of lemon juice to water on this recipe. I prefer half as much water as called for. I did use a no sugar substitute, but that made no difference in the watery taste of the lemonade.

I tried developing an easy sugar free lemonade but could never get the ratios right.  I have to admit I didn't make this as it was described but I did use the ratios.  I used 3/4 cup bottled lemon juice and 1/2 cup measure for measure artificial sweetener.  I just pored everything into a jug and mixed it. No heating.  Thank you for giving me the ratios for a refreshing, cool, crisp lemonade.

I put about 1 cup lemon juice (squeezed myself) and 1 cup sugar and filled container (with sugar & juice already in it) TO two quarts... (So 2 qt. total) and it was nice..  Chilling now; I think the whole heating water may've been just to ensure the sugar and water mixed well... Me, I just stirred it for a while.
:-)
Like someone else said, (and I agree, even with minor adjustments I made) "not too tart not too sweet"... and once chilled, I'm sure it'll be "on point"..

Perfect! I was craving a glass of lemonade and this hit the spot! I just dissolved the sugar in one cup of hot tap water, added the lemon juice and a little less than three cups more water. Put on the lid to the jug I was making it in, shook and pored over crushed ice. Yummy!  Sweet and tangy enough for my taste.

I made this for guests having a meeting at my house. And they all loved  it and requested it for the next meeting.  I followed the recipe and feel it turned out perfect, not too sweet. I thought my guests would think it was not sweet enough but they thought it was perfect.
