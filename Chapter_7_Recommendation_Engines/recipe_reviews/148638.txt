I almost didn't try this - I'm not a huge canned green bean fan.  But I read through pages and pages of side dishes, and this is the only recipe that called out to me.  I was very pleasantly surprised!  The flavor is much more complex that one would expect from the rather simple ingredient list.  But a warning - I read through recipe reviews on here and see people deviating from the recipe to try to "lighten" it up.  So - please don't try to omit the bacon and its grease!  Baco's and canola oil just isn't going to cut it.  (To be fair I should add, I deviated from the recipe and simmered this for about an extra 10 minutes - the meatloaf I had in the oven wasn't done yet and I didn't want the beans to get cold...)

I made these green beans for my wedding and cannot tell you how many people have asked for the recipe or wondered where I got the green beans from!!  They are easy to make (out of a can) and wonderful tasting!!

This recipe was great.  I made it as written the first time, and the second time I made changes.  I sauted 1 diced medium onion in just a little bit of the bacon grease after the bacon was removed.  Instead of the diced tomatoes, I used  1/2 a can of tomato puree.  I thought it had a more consistant tomato flavor than with chunks of tomato.  It turned out great!  I will be using this recipe frequently.

These green beans were really, really delicious!  I used fresh green beans and tomatoes, and added a little white balsamic vinegar to the mix.  Went really well with our italian inspired meatloaf.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Jennalaine.

Although I haven't made this yet, I've had it, and it's great! My neighbor used to make it for all our potluck get togethers and everyone LOVED it. I always meant to get the recipe from her, but never did, then I moved away suddenly and I've been looking for something simillar ever since. I'm so happy I found this! It's great comfort food and works nicely in a crock pot with fresh beans (add salt!) which is what she did when they were available.

This was good, but a little odd.  I used frozen beans, which I sauteed with the onions, instead of canned.  I reduced the sugar to 1 tbs. because I don't like a sugary taste.  I also used turkey bacon, which I don't recommend--it just didn't taste right!

Great but please substitute fresh cut beans for can, cut sugar in half or eliminate....no reason to make it so sweet; (They won't use brown sugar in Italy).

This was just the right amount of sweetness. A great way to put a new spin on plain old green beans.

Delicious recipe! I reduced the brown sugar by half and it was still sweet enough. I also used fresh green beans and just covered them and let them cook until they were tender. This is a definite repeat dish.

Okay.  I read another review which indicated that they had used zucchini.  And guess what?  I have zucchini by the bushel full right now.  So me thinks, why not.  It was yummy.  I followed all of the rest of the recipe, except cooked the zucchini with the onions and garlic, then added the tomatoes and herbs.  It was just yummy.  The brown sugar adds a nice sweetness to the dish.  I loved it and will definitely make again.

I made this as a side dish for a small party - people were surprised at how good beans can be. I did add a bit more brown sugar though...

I made this recipe because of the reviews and was skeptical about the brown sugar addition but it was fabulous.  I made it the first time with canned beans and then again on Christmas with fresh beans I steamed. Both were tasty but I like the fresh beans better.  I doubled the recipe when I made it with the fresh green beans using about 3 lbs, doubled all the other ingredients except the brown sugar. Only used about 1 1/2 of the sugar amount. Heard several comments on Christmas about how good the beans were!

This is OUTSTANDING!!  I steamed fresh green beans as I had them in the fridge, then prepared per recipe. I did cut the brown sugar to 2 T. and it was just the right amount of sweetness.

This sweet dish goes great with roast.  My picky husband even liked it!!  You dont expect the sweetness, but it, along with the bacon & onions is great!!  This is a keeper.

Awesome recipe, the bacon tastes great with this recipe. I used fresh green beans, and since the tomatoes already have basil & oregano I didn't add the extra herbs. I will definitely make this again, thanks.

It was okay. It was too sweet. I cannot say it was good till the last drop. I would cut out some of the brown sugar, not because it is more calories.

I was sceptical but these beans were awesome. I used fresh garden beans and just boiled them to soften them up and then followed the recipe exactly. I think you could just make the sauce for this and skip the beans and add it to pasta.

These green beans were pretty good from coming from a can. I didnt have bacon but planned to use real bacon bits. I realized after beginning the recipe I only had about a teaspoon of them left. So, I cooked them with a tablespoon of grapeseed oil about 30 seconds. Then added the green onion and garlic and cooked another 30 seconds to 1 minute. The green onion I had were large, so I just used two. For the Italian tomatoes I pureed a can of stewed tomatoes with about 1/4 teaspoon of Italian seasoning, in my Vitamix on low. I then added the rest of the ingredients, but only did about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and it was plenty. Served with mashed potatoes and meatloaf. ty

It is very similar to a green bean & tomato recipe my mother had years ago.

I served this for Christmas dinner, and it was a hit. I decreased the brown sugar slightly, and increased the bacon slightly. I made it as directed then transferred it to a crockpot, and it was wonderful.

These were fantastic!  My husband kept eating them saying he could eat the entire dish.  Only change I made was after  I combined all ingredients, I baked them in the oven for about 30 min until hot.  Will definitely be making these again

I think these are too sweet (3 stars) but my husband has more of a sweet tooth and thinks they're great (5 stars).  As written, the recipe is pretty sweet, so reduce or omit sugar unless that's what you want!

My husband raved about these! Next time I will try frozen or fresh green beans since I don't like all of the salt in canned. And I will try fresh herbs since I grow those. I will definitely fix these again!

Hubby really liked these. I did use fresh green beans & may try using a can, but don't think it'd be as good. (personal taste)  I do think we'll use half the brown sugar as I thought it was a little to sweet.

I thought these were great, but my family did not care for them.  I do think the brown sugar could be reduced and they would still be good.  I used pre-cooked bacon and just used a little vegetable oil instead of bacon grease. It was quicker.

Desperate to liven up up green beans I gave this recipe a shot. It was great and my two friends eating dinner with me asked for the recipe. Her toddler even liked it!  Will make again.

Loved this recipe and since I'm not a fan of canned green beans, I used frozen and started boiling them until they became soft.  The receipe adds that little extra touch to make a plain green beans stand out.

Very good, but I halved the sugar (and it was still a bit sweet - however if you add a splash of vinegar, you get a nice sweet and tangy sauce) and I did use fresh green beans cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces.  Since I used fresh, I let them stew for a good half hour.  One of my favorite green bean dishes!

Sweet Italian Green Beans. I doubled this recipe and I personally need a little less diced tomatoes. I will adjust the dried oregano and dried basil to taste.  Great recipe!

I liked the concept of this recipe, forgive me I made changes that made it my own.  Fresh green beans and tomatoes, never canned! Added mushrooms and various Italian spices with only a tsp. of brown sugar.  So good!  It went well with my Italian meatloaf and yellow potatoes.

AWESOME! I had swiss steak last night and wanted something that would compliment my dinner. Due to the tomatoes in the swiss steak I tried something different. Instead of the tomatoes I added a can of tomatoes and for an added twist I used maple bacon. Very unique and tasty combination of flavors. Wonderful dinner. Husband loved it!

This was great!!  My husband doesn't like green beans but I made this last night and he asked for more.  I did change its a bit cause I didn't have everything and was not going to go to the store.  I used garlic powder and onion powder, didn't drain the green beans and didn't add the tomatoes or bacon.  It turned out really good!!

Absolutely delicious.  Lazy me, I just got a package of REAL bacon bits from the salad dressing isle and used a couple tablespoons - heated it when I cooked the green onions.  A real time saver and tasted great.
