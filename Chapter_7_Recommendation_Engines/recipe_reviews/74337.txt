I make this all the time. People love it. It tastes like Summer. Please note that it calls for red BELL pepper. Too bad most can't find Jicama. It's there to add crunch, contrast of color and a bit of sweetness. I sometimes add just a handful of black beans to the salsa for color. Fresh corn cooked about 3-4 minutes in boiling water, not canned. People comment on the "beautiful salsa" every time. I don't use much cayenne since many can't handle hot. BUT, I take a base of sour cream, leftover cilantro, lime juice, salt, 1/2 a jalapeno, a little oil and chili powder and blend in blender. Not hot at all. Put it squirt bottle and guests can add to tacos if they like. OR take half that sauce for mild lovers and leave half to throw in a chipotle, more jalapeno, cayenne or whatever you think will be good for the spicy lovers.  I also cook my fish (tilapia) on a cast iron griddle (flat side) on the grill. Get it good and hot and cook about 2-3 mins per side. Comes out with a slightly blackened crust with all the juices sealed in. I marinate the fish in just lime juice, olive oil and some chili powder. I use flour tortillas. They hold up well.  I'm telling you, this is the way to go with this recipe.

Excellent! ~ These tacos are sooo good. I can't wait to make 'em again. But, here's the only thing...the recipe for the spices makes waaaay too much. So, cut it at least in half (you'll still probably have too much left over). We reduced the amount of the red pepper as well and they were still too firey for our (spicy) taste. The salsa mixture is wonderful (although I couldn't finD jicama in our store). We didn't fnd the salsa dry at all because the sour cream adds a creamy taste. Toss the tortillas on the grill for a bit. YUM! This one's a keeper! :)

Delish!  I blackened the corn in a skillet (no oil or water) and added diced avocado.  This was so very good!  Enjoy!

Not bad at all. Tilapia is great for people who aren't crazy about fish because it is so mild, you almost don't even know it's there. Because the salsa was a little bit bland, Husband topped the tacos with a little medium Pace salsa. Oh, I also learned an important lesson about corn tortillas tonight - when the recipe says to use two, you really do need to use two. I made the first taco with one, and it ended up disintegrating on to the counter... Good recipe though. Thanks!

INCREDIBLE!  Only changes were I cooked the corn tortillas in 2 Tablespoons oil to make them hold together, and that worked well.  I also used Alaskan Halibut.  We like spicy, and we were not dissapointed!  I also cooked the corn as another member had suggested.  As we would say when we haul in a nice Halibut, "It's a keeper!" I will make this again and again!

I LOVE spicy food but this was way too much cayanne papper.  I should have cut it back to about half of what is called for.  
I used canned corn nibblets but did not cook the corn first.  BIG MISTAKE.  The recipe doesnt tell you to cook the corn but I should have figured it out.  Cook the Corn first!  The salsa is the best part of the dish.  Magnificent!  But the fish is so-so.  I couldnt find the jicama at the market.  So I rated it 4 because of my own errors but I will make it again the right way and we will see....

I sprinkled the spices too liberally, my husband thought this way too hot.  I loved it as is, but next time I'll make it a bit less hot.  I did not use sour cream, but I had guacamole that I put on instead.  I used flour tortillas because I like them better.  There was plenty of corn salsa (no jicama could be found, I added a bit of tomato), so I am making this again tonight.  I loved it, just be careful on the spices if others are spice-sensitive!

Yum! Great light meal with lots of flavor. I didn't think I would like the corn salsa on it but that really made the entire taco.

Awesome, awesome, awesome.  Everyone I serve this to asks me for the recipe.  I always follow another reviewer's advice and put sour cream, cilantro, lime juice, salt, jalapeno, and cayenne into my food processor, blend it up, and serve it along side.  Most of my guests just mix it into their salsa.  I also like to dredge the fish in cornmeal before cooking them for a little crunch.  Best fish taco EVER!

I was excited to get home and try this recipe.  The seasoning for the fish was super.  I didn't make the salsa so I can't comment on it but instead I filled up the tortilla with the fish, shredded lettuce, tomato and a spicy yogurt/sour cream sauce.

This is the most delicious fish taco recipe ever. Even my kiddos love it. I didn't change anything at all, followed the recipe exactly, and it's wonderful. It's one of our new family favorites. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, we wanted to try fish tacos for a long time but didn't like most of the recipes, this one is PERFECT!

Another great idea, unfortunately written. I bought the ingredients for this recipe without reading the amounts called for (my bad), but was able to adjust them as I made it. An inexperienced cook following this recipe is going to end up with incredibly salty fish that will burn their face off. Even changing the tablespoons to teaspoons is going to be HOT, so I would suggest just seasoning the fish to your taste. The salsa is full of great textures, colors, and flavors, but is bland as written; salt and cumin helped make it a great contrast to the fish. In the end, we enjoyed these very much, but I can only recommend title - and can only assume that all the great ratings came from people that did not follow this recipe as written. Sorry!

This is a keeper!  It is spicy, I may cut back on the spices but my husband loved it the way it was.  I have been looking for a great salsa recipe and found it in this recipe, the corn salsa is awesome.

Wow...I totally disregarded the amounts of cayenne, salt, etc. I think it's a typo because that is WAY too much of both for this amount of fish. Maybe it's supposed to be teaspoons? Anyway, the salsa was fabulous and so fresh tasting. Wonderful foil to the spicy fish. Lots of sour cream, the salsa, fresh corn tortillas slightly warmed - fish taco heaven! Thank you!

Absolutely loved it. The best fish tacos I've ever eaten. They are way, way too hot the way the recipe states. I made them exact and then just scraped most of the spices away from the fish after they were cooked. I'm making again tonight and I plan to sprinkle the spices very, very lightly. And, I'll just scrape away if it's too much. The salsa is to die for--I'll be making that all summer long. I still give 5 stars, because it's a super easy modification.

Omitted the jicama because I didn't have it. I also made a jalepeno sour cream sauce instead of just plopping sour cream on them. Delicious!!

I was a little intimated about making fish tacos but the corn and red bell pepper topping was delicious! I did not have jicama or red onion so I just omitted those. The warm corn tortilla and the cool sour cream topping hit the right spot! It was a very easy dinner and I'll be using this in the future.

I made this with salmon because that was the fish I had on hand. It was very good. The amount of cayenne just terrified me so I cut back to one tablespoon and it was more than enough. I substituted diced tomato for the red pepper in the salsa but added a few shakes of red pepper flakes. Whole wheat tortillas rounded out this very tasty meal. Thanks for the recipe

I have never had fish tacos before, but my husband and I love mexican so we couldn't wait to taste it. PHENOMENAL! It is very spicy, so if you have children BEWARE! I recommend having CHOLULA mexican hot sauce with it. It really accentuates the flavor. And, if you've never tried Jicama (this was my first time) it's a good healthy snack :)

Overall the recipe is good, but the seasonings are a little too much.  Very salty and too much cayenne pepper.  I recommend reducing the amount of seasoning you make and sprinkling it lightly.

This was very good, I made a few adjustments, the amount of cayenne pepper was way more than we like and we like moderately spicy foods.  The corn tortillas were too dry tasting so we had our second taco with flour tortillas, much better ( the corn tortillas you can get in places with very fresh tortillas would probably be fine, our stores only carry fresh for 30+ days tortillas).  My husband loved the salsa, but we felt it was a little dry, will probably add a little fresh diced, seeded tomato to it next time.  Good combination otherwise

Fantastic!! This is one of those recipes that deserves more than 5 stars. The fish has quite a kick, but that corn salsa follows right after and cools it down. The salsa is KILLER. Only change I made was to add cumin and garlic powder to the fish. Make sure you serve it with lime wedges so everyone can squeeze more juice on their tacos. I'll make again. Thanks :)

This was delicious!  I made some adjustments - no jicama, extra cilantro, less cayanne.   Great!  Really fast & easy as well.  I don't have a grill, so I used a Le Crueset grill pan & it turned out fine.  Like another reviewer said, I would use flour tortilla next time, because I don't think my grocery's corn are that fresh.

This was our first attempt at fish tacos.  They were good enough to convince us to try fish tacos again, but probably not with this recipe.

The corn salsa is so good it changed my life!  I serve this dish with every topping in a different bowl so everyone can assemble their taco to their taste.  The colors are lovely and the taste is fantastic. Really, really good=:)

We fixed these tacos for a group of friends who gather at our house on Friday nights for fellowship and food.  THEY WERE GREAT.  Our friends were still raving about them on Sunday morning when we met for breakfast.  We did follow some of the recommendations that suggested cutting back on the cayenne pepper for those who like less spicy food.  We had the "hot" fish and the not so "hot" fish.  We will definitely make these again.

Super yummy! I would definitely use less cayenne pepper and onions than the recipe called for though, we made it with half and it still had a kick! Definitely really good and an exciting dish!

Really amazing - I added cumin and honey and used seeded cucumber in place of jicama. The salsa goes perfectly with "Fish Tacos Ultimo" if you're looking to change up the spices for your tilapia.

My husband and I are trying to include more fish in our diet.  He is a fish fan, I am not.  Usually I only rate recipes if I stuck to the original recipe, but felt that this one needed another rave review even with the modifications I made.  I used frozen corn (just ran it under tap water to defrost - didn't cook it), 1/2 cup yellow onion (it's what I had), skipped the jicama (couldn't find any), skipped the cilantro altogether (can't stand it), and used bottled lemon juice (didn't have a lime). I stirred the sour cream right into the "salsa" (didn't read the directions right) and added a bit of fresh ground pepper.   I used Tony Cachere's cajun seasoning in place of the cayenne pepper as the seasoning for the fish.  I brushed with olive oil and then LIBERALLY coated the fish with the seasoning.  It was JUST the right amount of "fiery" spice.   To be such a simple recipe, this was fantastic. I ate two tacos myself which is saying a lot for someone who is so anti-fish like I am.  I usually take one bite of a fish recipe, gag,  and leave the rest for my husband and teenagers to consume.   The corn "salsa" added just the right amount of crunch and the freshness of the ingredients paired nicely with the fish. I am DEFINITELY going to put this in the regular rotation.

These tacos are amazing! We just melt cheese on the corn tortillas...in the oven on broil. They soften up and then you don't have to mess with the oil...less time consuming. You have to try these...they belong on a mobile taco truck!

soooo amazing.  I marinate the fish in lime juice, olive oil and chili powder for about 30 minutes before grilling in a cast iron pan (blackened tilapia filets taste so yummy for this!)  I also use a can of Mexican corn and add cilantro, chopped tomato and avocado and lime juice when I don't have all the fresh veggies on hand.  Obviously fresh beats canned, but still works great!

These were DELICIOUS!  I didn't use any jicama in the salsa but did add some black beans and it was soooo good.  However, I would definitely suggest cutting back to about half on the spices for the fish.  I had a lot left over.  Also, I would reduce the proportion of cayenne pepper - SUPER spicy.  We also added white rice to the tacos, which helped with the spice.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was wonderful! Read thru the reviews and based on others experience, decreased the cayenne pepper to 1/2 tsp which was plenty for my gf and I! I also didn't have any jicama, so I diced 2 Granny Smith apples and the salsa was just terrific! My gf has requested it again for tomorrow! Thx for a wonderful recipe!!

Scrumptious recipe! I didn't use salt but did add black beans and scallions to the crunchy corn salsa as well as melted shredded cheese (mexican blend) to the tortilla. I also sautéed the fish in a little butter instead of olive oil and just added the cayenne and black pepper while sautéing, and it stuck just fine. Yum!

I didn't use the jicama, but the salsa still tasted great.  The combinations of spices for the fish were good, but I think next time I will use a little less of it.  My husband and I love spicy food, but this was a bit much.  Also, we used hard taco shells instead of soft.

I think this would have been a great meal, except we didn't cut down on the amount of cayenne pepper it said to use, and unfortunately the fish was just too spicy for our taste.  I would definetly cut down on the spices.  My son loved the jicama in the salsa though, and he ate several spoonfulls of just that!

This is an excellent recipe.  I made it with mahi-mahi.  I processed the jicama, the onion, and the pepper in the food processor, which made the salsa nice and moist.  It made a ton of the stuff...good thing we really liked it!

These were super good. I agree with some of the other comments that there is too much seasoning. I only used half of what it called for and still had a ton left over. Also I added black beans. I would make these again for sure.

This recipe was delicious. I did not use any salt and it turned out great. I also made a cilantro lime sour cream and topped with avocado. The jicama really makes the salsa unique (in a good way)!

My husband and I don't normally eat fish but we thought we would try this out because it looked too good! I used a cajun spice blend instead of the cayanne and I added black beans and used green onions instead of red. We're definitely going to be adding this to our regular menu!

As others have mentioned, this recipe was fantastic with a slight adjustment to the spices. We only used a pinch of salt and a slightly larger pinch of cayenne pepper. No need to use oil to cook the tortillas  if you throw them on the griddle, and they were crispy enough that they held together with just one rather than two. We omitted the sour cream in favor of guacamole and added a little pepper jack cheese to the tortillas while they were on the griddle. Great recipe, this will definitely enter the regular week rotation!

THESE WERE AMAZING!  Some changes I made: Used 1 chopped tomato instead of jicama, omitted the red bell pepper, added a chopped serrano pepper to the salsa, added a chopped avocado to teh salsa and added more cayenne pepper.  The balance of the cool sour cream with the spicy fish is perfect.  I will definitely be making these again.

I used a different fish recipe for this but used the corn salsa from this recipe.  It was very tasty.  I used fiesta corn but couldn't find the jicama.

We like spicy fish, so this was perfect.  We loved the salsa and the fresh healthy taste of this fish taco recipe.  We will definately make this again.

This was the best tilapia I have had.  However, the corn salsa needs a tomato base.

This dish came out way too spicy for my family. Next time I will not season the fish and use the veggie combo to season the tacos.

After having this recipe saved for some time, I finally made it...and it was INCREDIBLE!  Instead of grilling the fish, I just seared for a few min on the stove in a pan with a little EVOO.  I warmed the tortillas in the oven to make them crispy and topped with the salsa, a bit of sour cream and a squeeze of lime juice!  Very light, refreshing and satisfying. We had some salsa left over, which I plan on using later this week for some steak fajitas we are making.  I highly recommend this!

I have been looking for a fish taco recipe and have had no success until now. The jicama really adds a lot to this dish so definitely make the extra effort to get it if you can (whole foods has it). The crunch and blend of ingredients in the salsa is great! Also, I only used half the salt, pepper, and cayenne. I think next time i'll make it just a little spicier. We also added guacamole as a topping too which was great combined with the other ingredients. Will definitely make over and over again!

What a delicious recipe!!!  The only thing I did different was cheating and used blackened seasoning for the rub mainly for ease and love of that seasoning.  The corn salsa is wonderful!  I also made Beso Guacamole from Eva Longoria's recipes! And had rice and asparagus as sides?  No leftovers and we will be making this again for certain!

You can substitute the jimaca with water chestnuts.  They have the same flavor and texture that the jimaca adds to the dish and are more readily available to a lot more people.

Loved these. Great flavor for the fish. Wasn't too spicy because I reduced the cayenne down. Kids loved it too. The salsa was ok, a little bland but overall great recipe. Will definately be using again.

Loved these fish tacos!  They sounded delicious from the recipe and did not disappoint!!  Did not use jicama, but substituted black beans.  Could also add diced tomatoes and avocado.  Also used chili powder instead of the cayenne pepper.  Loved every bite and can't wait to make these again!

Giving these 5 stars despite the fact that they were too spicy for me.  I am a wimp.  I left out the jicama (couldn't find it at the grocery) and I grilled mine on a tabletop grill.  Next time, I will cut WAY back on the spices and grill them outdoors.  The pepper nearly asphyxiated me!  Haha.  But these ARE delicious.  The salsa was phenomenal, and the coolness and sweetness of the salsa complements the spiciness of the fish perfectly.  Will definitely make them again, with less "heat."

This is really good for a very quick meal... I had everything to make this except the jicama so I left that out. I may try and add that in the next time I make this. Also instead of making the cayenne/salt mixture, I just sprinkled each side of the filets with Tony Chachere's. This is a really good recipe. Someone mentioned that their corn tortilla broke when they only used 1. If you warm them up either in the microwave or with oil on the stove, they will be more pliable and less likely to break.

If I could give these 10 stars, I would. They were amazing! Made my eyes water whle the fish was cooking it was so spicy! Please try to find the jicama, it adds sooooo much to this dish! It really gives it a cool, sweet crunch. Fresh corn is best, although the canned corn wasn't bad at all. Will be making this weekly!

My family and I thought this was pretty good. Based on other reviews, I used granny smith apple in place of the jicama, which I couldn't find and we all thought that was a really nice touch. I also reduced the seasoning. Turned out I should have used even less salt, but a little more cayenne. I also tossed in avocado for the salsa and it was great. A few tweaks and this could easily be a 5-star.

These were good but to us not great.  I used mahi mahi instead of tilapia but I dont' think that took away from the dish.  The "salsa" was good, but we just felt like it was missing something.

Have to give 4 stars the way it is written.  Prepared it as written first time and liked it.  Decided to use Chef Prudhomme's Blackened Redfish spice instead of mixing the spices in the recipe.  Not only did it take less time, but the flavor was really great!  I love the corn salsa.  I added black beans and it was perfect.

I couldn't find Tilapia at the grocery store so I substituted it with Orange Roughy. I rubbed a thin layer of the spices directly on both sides of the fish, then grilled it in a pan coated with olive oil and butter. I also made some basmati rice with butter and cilantro. My family loved this recipe -- I had one comment that it was better than Chipotle.

These were really good but...  DO NOT COOK IN DOORS WITH A GRILL PAN.  I had to open every window in the house,(March in NY, we were very cold!)   my husband and I were coughing up a lung.  I had to shut the door to my kids rooms so they would not choke! I went to 3 different supermarket/fruit stores to find Jimica and I really don't think it added flavor to the corn salsa, it did add crunch but that is about it.  I will make these again but only in the summer when we can BBQ the fish!  They were very hot and I cut the cayenne pepper down to a tablespoon.

Loved this dish.  I did cut back on the spices.  I also added diced tomatoes and a can of black beans to the salsa.  Yummy!  The salsa was colorful and great with tortilla chips as well.  I plan on making this dish again soon.

Yes, I know I should have realized that when it said fiery, it would be hot. But holy hannah, I cut the cayenne to 1 tsp., pepper and salt to 1/2 tsp each and it still almost took our heads off.(to those who can eat it that hot, hats off to you) Still it was fabulous, and you HAVE to make the corn salsa with it. I doulbed corn (no jicama) and chopped up a avacado. My kids loved it, the oldest even loved the heat, youngest not so much and my husband ate it sans the salsa or avacado. With a little tweaking for our "tender midwest" palate, I will definatly make this again.

Fabulous recipe!!  I am not a fan of cilantro (smells like dish soap to me!) but the salsa is great with the fish.  My husband, sister-in-law and brother-in-law, who are Mexican loved the flavor of the fish and the salsa. I used Red Snapper and Cod and Red Snapper was out favorite.  Next time I will try Halibut.  Thanks for the recipe.

When I made this, I decided to just buy corn salsa instead of make it. I don't know how much of a difference it made, but this recipe wasn't very good. It's main problem was that it was waaaay too salty. Perhaps the recipe means 2 teaspoons of salt, not 2 tablespoons.

This is a great recipe for other 'wild caught fish'. The corn salsa is great!

Great twist on tacos with salsa, I'll definitely make again. Based on other reviews I reduced the red pepper, but I think I cut it too much So I'll adjust it up a bit next time. I reduced the salt by half - the amount listed is way too much!  I also couldn't find jicama so I subbed water chestnuts with wonderful results. The salsa definitely makes this dish!

I am a big fan of spice and find that most recipes are too mild. This did not disappoint! I sprinkled the cayenne mixture liberally, and while the fish alone was too spicy for even my taste the sour cream and corn salsa balanced it really nicely. Did not have the jicama but the salsa was delicious without it.

As it was just a little too hot for my partner's palate, next time I'll probably toss in a jalapeno into the salsa and sparingly use some cajun spice on the tilapia. 

Simple, fast, very fresh tasting, and easy to make.

Delish!  Couldn't find Jicama because I live in the middle of nowhere, so I used apple instead; added a nice sweetness and crunch to the corn salsa.  
Only thing:  make sure you ventilate your kitchen.  The amount of cayenne pepper cooking in hot oil made me cough like crazy and created a great deal of smoke.

I made this last night for my family.  We all agreed it was way to hot for our taste.  The flavor of the fish and the salsa seemed to be covered up by the cayenne pepper and cumin.  I will try this again with much less cayenne and no cumin.  Over all it was not my favorite but such a pretty dish to put before my family.  I just loved the use of color and texture.  I would recommend but play with the heat a bit if you have a soft pallet like me.

This was pretty amazing! I would have given it  5 STARS but this was VERY spicy and I only used 1/2 the amount of cayenne pepper!!  I added a little onion powder and garlic powder and it was very, very good!! Will definitely make again!!! Even my kids loved it!!!

Great! Just the right amount of spice! The sweet from the corn and jicama are an awesome combination with the spicy fish.  This has become a family favorite.

Loved the salsa! Great recipe, one of my favorites, is make again for sure! Easy to do, used my food processor to help cut up things. Couldn't find a jicama so used some white onion.

Best fish tacos ever!!!! Don't skip on using the jicama - that is the best part! What's also great about this recipe is you can use the 'toppings' for other things, like salads or chicken.

I love this recipe! I have been trying all sorts of fish taco recipes to use with tilapia, and this is by far the best... And agreed by both husband and kids. That being said, I had to change it a little because of the ingredients I had on hand.  I substituted blanched cauliflower for the jicama (blanched the corn too FYI), green onions for the red (almost used white onion, but I like a little extra bite).  I also added about 1/2 tsp of chili powder to the salsa.  The salsa was a great vegetable for the meal! As for the fish, I lightly seasoned with seasoning salt and cayenne pepper (probably about 3/4 tsp). I couldn't imagine using all that cayenne called for, but I might add a little more next time, at least to mine and my husband's fish... Kids liked it with less spice.  Overall big Yum!

This was the first time I had ever had fish tacos. They were AMAZING! Really simple to make. Instead of red bell pepper, I chopped up some fresh tomato. Skipped the jicama since I didn't have it. I pretty much eyeballed everything. I can't wait to make this again!

The only thing I did was decrease the amount of salt and used half of the cayenne pepper. I also added a slice of guacamole. The salsa was delicious. I didn't even need the sour cream.  I will definitely make it again.

Loved them! Not being deep fried, they were so much healthier than the fish taco recipe I was using. Two tablespoons of cayenne pepper seemed like a lot so I cut down on it to suit our tastes.

This was GREAT! The jicama gave a great crunch to the corn salsa. I used thawed frozen corn for time consideration and the salsa was still wonderful. Additionally, I just pan fried the talapia (1 tblsp olive oil heated over med-high heat, put in talapia, sprinkled side facing up with seasoning made in this recipe, cooked 3-4 min, flipped over, sprinkled the other side with seasoning, another 3-4 min or until fish flaked with a fork, then drizzled 1 tblsp melted butter over cooked talapia & it's ready to serve!!). This will definitely be in the meal rotation. Once cutting of veggies is done, this is a quick meal. Served with yellow rice and chips, guac, & hot salsa.  P.s. If you aren't fond of spicy meals, reduce the cayenne pepper as this made the fish quite spicy....was perfect for me!

Used what I had in the house which did NOT include jicama but i did have pears, so used that instead.  Used a whole red pepper instead of 1/2 a cup.  Accidentally put chipotle in the mix instead of cayenne...so added the cayenne too. We like it hot at our house, but I kind of eyeballed the cayenne after putting in the chipotle so I may have used a little less. Even my 12 year old boy liked them:-) Will make this again~!

Yummy!!! I made some changes - marinated the fish in zesty lime salad dressing mixed with olive oil (Kraft?), mixed non-fat greek yogurt with jalepeno's, cilantro, and chile powder in the blender for some kick.  We ate them the first night and I felt like it was missing something.  The second night I added some fresh mango to the salsa - out of this world!!!  I made extra salsa and I'm going to cut up more mango and throw on top of lettuce with some of the yogurt sauce to take for lunch tomorrow. Hubbie skipped the mango and added cheese to his.

Yum (but WOW were these ever S-P-I-C-Y!!!)! My hubs and I enjoy heavily spiced foods, but even he commented that these would knock anyone's socks off lol. :) Having said this, I'd change nothing. Simply put, you either enjoy spice or you don't. If not, skip this recipe in favor of one that better suits your tastes. The spiciness of the fish combined with the fresh salsa is what makes this recipe unique. If you alter ANYTHING, you won't appreciate this for what it is (but that's just my opinion). NOTE: If you can find jicama, DON'T SKIP IT!!! It is ever so slightly sweet and as many others have noted, adds a nice contrast / crunch to the salsa. I also strongly suggest that you GRILL your corn, allow it to cool slightly and then gently cut the kernels off the cobb. There's just something about slightly charred, grilled corn that says summer is here and this is the perfect use for it. Other than halving this and adding a touch more lime juice / pinch of salt to the salsa, I made no significant changes. I will however reduce the amount of cilantro next time (a cup's worth was a tad overpowering, IMHO). A squirt of sour cream and fresh lime were refreshing touches and are a MUST even for us folks who easily tolerate heat. Thanks SO much for sharing your recipe with the AR community, Louise. I'm sad that I waited so long to give this a try! :-)

We thought this was very flavorful and fresh tasting!  Much healthier than a fried fish taco.   The jicama gave the relish a nice crunch with just a touch of sweetness.  The only thing I would adjust is the seasoning on the fish.  We love spice, but 2 tbsp of cayenne is a lot!  I just sprinkled the seasoning on the fish until lightly coated and it was plenty spicy.

Really good!  I followed some of the advice and used Tony Cachere's cajun seasoning on the fish instead of the cayene and pepper.  I also added a drizzle of olive oil to the salsa, used parsley instead of cilantro (what I had), subbed green apple for jicama (wasn't available at my store), added a dash of cayenne to the salsa, and squeezed a little bit of lime juice over the fish before I cooked it.  I cooked it on the stovetop using a grill pan.

FIRE AND LIME! oh my gosh GROSS all you could taste was FIRE AND LIME! juice of a lime is way too much for the salsa, and 2 Tbsp of cayenne is way too much for the spice-mix... listen, I love my tang and my spice, but this was like eating lime juice and cayenne, you could not taste anything else... just FIRE AND LIME! If I ever make these again, I'm changing EVERYTHING!

This is a great recipe. I didn't have jicama so I used a crunchy apple. I am not a fan of cilantro, so I used parsley instead. Whether with my changes or keeping the recipe the same, try it. It is so good.

No complaints here! The salsa was really good, and I never had jicama before. I'm glad it was in this, as it gave the tacos a really nice crunch, as promised in the recipe title. Very simple and very delish!

Made it exactly as specified. THE BEST fish tacos I've ever had, restaurant, home, or otherwise. Doubled the salsa, and with the leftovers added jalepenos and tomatoes to go with chips later. YUM!

This was soooo good! I only had dried cilantro and I only used 2 tsp of cayenne pepper & it was still very spicy. I did find the Jicama at Walmart superstore and this with the lime juice is what really sets this off! I ALWAYS deepfry my corn tortillas in olive oil, I can't eat them just warmed up! So it was cruncy & mind blowing! I ran out of Tilapia and used catfish, it was still great!

I add a mango to the salsa and sometimes fresh diced tomatoes.  I usually leave out the jicama as it is hard to find in my area, but with the mango- it is delicious.  My roommates love when I make this!

The spices listed made me nervous so I used blackened seasoning instead.  It only had 1/8 tsp of red pepper. I brushed with melted butter then added the seasoning.  I cooked in a pan for 3 mins each side on med high.  The only thing I would change is use regular tortillas next time.  I used white corn tortillas and 2 of them was too much and didn't taste great or stay together well.  I used 3 servings and made 4 tacos.  Loved the salsa.  Top with sour cream.

Very Good!  I made a couple of changes based off of available ingredients.  Substituted black beans for jicama, lemon for the lime, and chili powder for the cayenne pepper.  They turned out excellent!  
I also love the colors and plate appeal.  We will most definitely have this again!

This was amazing!  


The first time I made this the fish was too spicy for our tastes.  The second time I used Cajun seasoning on the fish instead of the rub in the recipe.  It was the perfect heat.

The Salsa is wonderful:  Fresh and fruity tasting.  Both times I made the salsa in the morning and let the flavors get acquainted.  This does make a lot of the salsa.  The second time I halved the ingredients and had just the right amount for us.

The salsa was dry; the fish was bland.  I didn't use as much cayenne as called for because my family doesn't like it too spicy.  This had interesting texture (I also added avacado and some tomatoes to the mix as others have suggested.)  But I think I would not make it again.

My husband loved this; I liked it very much. Too much cayenne pepper for my taste. I think it overpowered the other flavors too much. Will definitely make again, but with less cayenne (and I only used half this time) and maybe add some cumin for more flavor. The salsa was wonderful. I added some black beans and we liked it very much. Also, I added avocado to the tacos and it was perfect!

I decided to make this last night for the first time. I have always heard about how good fish tacos are but these are amazing. My dad and brother who thought the idea was weird were actually amazed. Everyone came back for seconds. My five year old didn't like them, but I will be making these again soon.

These were excellent!!! It is the first fish recipe I've made that my husband liked and then ate the remaining filet alone after finishing 2 tacos! I loved the salsa as well! I did reduced the spices using only half the reccomended amount of cayenne, keeping the salt and pepper the same and I added a tbs of cumin because I love the flavor. I hate to wight a review after I've modified, but I think when it comes to spices you sometimes have to adjust to your liking. I think its a shame for the people that can't find jicama because it truly MAKES the salsa. It adds the perfect crunch and while its flavor is so mild you don't miss out on all the other flavors. Excellent, excellent recipe! Thank you for sharing this!

Delicious corn salsa recipe! I used the marinade recipe from Grilled Fish Tacos with Chipotle Lime Dressing to spice up the fish a bit, but the salsa is wonderful. You can also make the salsa with a can of Lime & Cilantro Ro-Tel to spice it up and add tomato flavor if you desire.

WAAAAY too salty.... the only thing I could taste.  And I only used 1/2 of the salt!  Also too much black/cayenne pepper... but not nearly as bad as the salt.  Start at 1/8 of the seasoning?  Just lightly season to taste?  Salsa was nice as is.  Next time, I'll add some black beans.  I grilled my tortillas after the fish, which turned out nice.  Salvageable recipe... and could be really nice.  BUT NOT WITH SPICE LEVELS LISTED.

Easy and delish. The corn salsa was a hit..ppl were eating just the salsa and I almost ran out before the fish was grilled. 

I made the corn salsa the night before. Make sure you don't just juice but actually ZEST the limes. It gives the salsa an extra refreshing and tangy kick!

I haven't made fish in a while, but wanted to start incorporating it into my diet more.  This was a really good recipe and easy to put together.  I used bottled lime juice and omitted the sour cream and jicama.  I added diced avacados as well. I also heated the corn tortilla in a dry pan (no oil) where it made them slightly crispy.  I will definitely make this again.

Very good - but agree with the comment that is it too much salt - other than that it was amazing.  Now what to make with the jicama left over....

this was the first fish tacos that i have ever had and i may just add this to my reg. menu. I used the salt and pepper to my taste, which should always be done because everyone doesn't have the same salt and pepper levels, and the fish came out good. however next times i will add more cayenne pepper.

Excellent! A little spicy with the cayenne pepper but the sour cream and corn salsa contrast the heat nicely. I found jicama at the store, it added a nice crunchy texture to the corn salsa. I will definatley make this again, in fact I plan to make it tomorrow for my parents!

These were good.  I used 1/2 the spices like other suggested (even though I like super-spicy food, I didn't want to overpower the fish) and toped them with finely shreded cabbage.  I didn't have jicama so I used a granny smith apple - it was a great choice!  The condiment recipes make a lot... I suggest halving it.

SO GOOD!  I added a whole granny smith apple to the salsa in place of the Jicama and found that this is the secret ingredient!  the sweetness/ tartness really made the entire meal!  Like everyone has said, halve the spice amount and add with caution.  I also grilled some potato wedges along with the fish and added them to the tacos as well.  Love this recipe!!

This was wonderful and so easy!  I used 1 cup of corn, 6 green onions, 1 cup of chopped tomatoes and 1/2 small can of diced jalapenos with 1 lime squeezed over it.  I sauteed this mixture over the stove while I broiled the fish in the oven.  Served with black beans and mexican rice.  Delicious!

I omitted the cayenne pepper and substituted 1tsp chili powder reduced salt to 3/4 tsp and reduced blk pepper to 1/4 tsp. Really happy w/ the results. Crunchy salsa added just the right flavor and texture. It was my 1st time having  Jicama. Very mild flavor the crunch complimented the corn .  My family enjoyed the tacos & I would make them again.

These were not a hit in our house. I should have realized that the cayenne was going to make the dish too spicy for our tastes. It's a time consuming recipe (lots of chopping, etc.) and the results weren't as good as I'd hoped. Especially was disappointed in the salsa. It was very dry. There's another fish taco recipe on this site that we like better. Tilapia is our fish of choice for tacos.

Excellent!  VERY SPICY (and we generally like spicy)!  I cut the cayenne pepper in about 1/2, but would recommend reducing to about 1/4-1/3, next time.  I didn't have jicama, but I added black beans (about the same amt. as the corn).  A KEEPER!!!!

These were delicious, summery, and somewhat spicy.  Just what I was looking for.  Pretty healthy too- i cooked the fish on the stove with fat free spay- worked fine.  Im looking forward to making these again- perfect!

I usually don't review a recipe that I tweak way beyond the original but this was such a great recipe I just had to. I grilled three ears of fresh corn till crisp tender. I sauteed the onion and red pepper in some olive oil till tender then added the corn. Used the juice and zest of one lime and added some red pepper flakes. Grilled the Tilapia for about 8 mins and added sour cream, tomatoes and some mexican mixed cheese. DELICIOUS! thank you!

I'd actually give this 3-1/2 stars if I could.  We followed the seasoning part of this recipe to the letter. The fish was so ungodly hot it ruined the flavor of everything it came in contact with! Now, I like spice. My dh LOVES spice, to the point he likes to add habaneros to alot of his meat merinades, so it isn't that we can't take the heat. There is just way too much of it. The salsa, on the other hand was fantastic. I actually added some cucumber since I couldn't get jicama, and I added some black beans & diced tomatoes since I had them on hand. The salsa was the saving grace of this recipe and is the only reason we will be making this again- without the spices on the fish. We can add our own flavor to the salso to add heat and still actually get the flavor of the fish.

I was excited to try jicama for the first time.  I was disappointed in this recipe, and I think it was mostly because of the flavor of the jicama in the salsa.  Now that I think about it, many reviewers mentioned that they couldn't find jicama in the store and omitted it.  I think this recipe would be much better without it.  The tacos were also a little dry.  I will keep searching for the perfect fish taco recipe.

Yum! This recipe was a bit labor-intensive but the flavors were very nice. I reduced the cayenne on the fish and used flour tortillas because I prefer them over corn tortillas. I also reduced the red onion, added chopped scallions and extra lime juice to the corn salsa. Also heated the corn on the advice of another reviewer. The jicama added a very nice crunch and the flavor was very mild, almost like a water chestnut. I think a chopped cucumber would be a nice substitute if you can't find jicama at your store. The tilapia came out great broiled with butter instead of olive oil. I also added some home-made guacamole and fresh lettuce and wrapped it all up together in the flour tortillas. Served these tacos with rice and pinto beans. Might be good with shrimp or chicken too!

Fresh, fresh, fresh! Even two days later, the leftover salsa pops in your mouth. I had to substitute water chestnuts for the jicama as the one I bought must've been in the store shelf too long. Loved the spice on the fish, gave it a nice zing. Rather than topping it with sour cream, I drizzled the sauce from Breese823's Fish Tacos over it, adding a combination of jalapeno and red thai chili peppers but no cayenne (didn't want to make it TOO hot!), greek yogurt and fresh dill that I had growing like crazy. That, coupled with the salsa and a small handful of coleslaw mix on each taco, and you had a winner. I think I'm going to do the same thing this weekend for a bbq, but mix the grilled, cooled fish with the salsa as a salad, then offer Scoop tortilla chips on the side along with the sauce to drizzle. Definitely different!

Super GOOD! Made these tonight for my son and his wife and they were yummy. The salsa is excellent, but fresh corn isn't always available ... even in California. When it isn't, I substitute Birdseye Ultimate Southwest Blend (a mix of corn, black beans, mild poblano peppers, and onions) for the corn. I don't even defrost if I have a few hours before serving. I also use tilipia or snapper cut into fairly large chunks. I marinate them for 1/2 hour in 2 Tbsp olive oil and about 1/3 cup lemon juice. Just before panfrying, I remove the fish to a gallon-sized plastic bag, add the seasonings (only HALF the salt) and shake well. Works out great. Love this recipe.

I wouldn't reccomend tilapia, it's such a cheap fish. Ahi, ono (wahoo), or hamachi (yellowtail) are much better choices.

I really liked this recipe--it was light and refeshing.  The reason I am only giving it 3 stars is my husband and family really disliked it.  I guess the word "taco" threw them off.  I think it would make a wonderful summer meal!  Won't make again though because I will be the only one eating!

I made this last night and it was delicious!  Everybody liked it.  However, after reading some reviews, I cut the cayanne pepper waaay back- from 2 tablespoons to 1/2 tablespoon, and it was still wayyy to spicey!  Next time I'll probably use about a quarter teaspoon of it.  Overall though, great recipe.  I couldn't find the jicama, but the salsa was super tasty anyways! I'll definatly make this again!

These were great!  Perfect spice level and lots of flavor.  I've been looking for the perfect fish taco recipe and have finally found it.  I did make a few alterations.  The store was out of jicama, so I just ommitted it.  I added 1 avocado and some diced tomatos just for fun and did not add any sour cream.

Even better than the fish tacos that I had in San Diego! I put some Co-Jack cheese on the filets before topping them with the salsa.

My family really liked this one.  We used low carb wheat tortillas since we are not a big fan of corn.  I only used half the cayenne and it was plenty hot for us!

Based on recipe itself, I would have given 3 stars, but I took heed from others and cut back on the cayenne pepper. It was still very spicy hot. The corn salsa was wonderful and overall, I really liked the recipe, but dang, is it ever hot....and I like fairly spicy stuff.  I didn't change it up too much, other than not using cilantro because family members hate it and using half the amount of cayenne.  Put light sour cream on it and, if I had any on hand, I would have added avocado bites to the corn salsa. Oh, and I also blackened the corn first as others suggested, just a preference, though.

My husband and I loved this recipe! Delicious flavours so easy to make. I omitted the corn and used the spices to taste vs following the recipe exactly. I added some fresh chopped mango and peach to really bring out this summer salsa so amazing!! I used snapper instead of tilapia but it was all good! Def making this again:)

I cook the salsa and use water chestnuts instead of jicama because it's easier and more convenient. I still get the same crunch.

We have made these twice now.  Careful - it is very spicy which we happen to like in our house.  I served it with mango salsa instead of the corn salsa in the recipe.

Loved these and will definitely make them again. The salsa was delicious, I have never used jicama before but it added a nice crunch and contrasted well with the lime juice.

Super yummy dish with tons of flavor. I didn't use a lot of spice and it still turned out well. The corn mix is a must it is what takes this dish to a whole other level. I loved the crunch and freshness this dish offers.

I thought these were good but I did reduce the seasonings from tablespoons to teaspoons. It just seemed like too much for the amount of fish I was making (3 pieces of tilapia). I didn't know what jicama was or where to find it so I just left that out of the corn salsa. I really enjoyed the salsa and the tilapia was seasoned well. I didn't bother grilling or baking. I just browned the pieces in a little oil in the skillet. Took 10 minutes at most. Quick, easy and delish!

very good! we cooked our corn salsa on stove top and was awesome. Brought all the flavors together. ALSO be careful with the Cheyenne pepper (we rubbed ours with it and was a little too spicey)

Loved these, especially the corn salsa. I made it waaay too spicy though, so I'll definitely have to tone it down next time.

WAYYY too much salt and spice. Use about 1/4 of the salt and 1/2 of the pepper and it would be great.

I was slightly hesitant with this one b/c I had never had the jicama before.  Other reviews who had described it as a cross between a potato and a water chestnut were correct.  All of the ingredients together were a perfect blend.  One review stated they added a jalapeno, cilantro, garlic, and salt to the sour cream as like a sauce and that paired with this salsa was PERFECT!  After eating this with fish, I even ventured off and used it as an actual salsa with tortilla chips and then the next day with taco meat and Spanish rice.  This is definitely a multi-functional (healthy) recipe and I will be making it again. Oh, and please remember to use red BELL peppers, not red spicy peppers.  This was not a hot salsa at all, it was very mild.

We like spicy, but the measurements for the seasoning seemed WAY off, so I halved them, and the tacos, even with gobs of sour cream, were hot enough to make us sniffle and sweat. The salsa is really good, and I have a ton of it leftover to eat with chips. Great way to serve my least favorite fish though - I'll make these again if I have tillapia in the house.

If I would have changed the recipe like so many reviews said, I think it would have been delicious. However, I followed the recipe exactly and I think my mouth is burning off! I like spicy food, almost everything I cook is spicy, but wow! Waaaay too much! The salsa was delicious and did help to cool it down but not enough for how much cayenne I put on the fish!

Very tasty, will keep for the future.  Lot of prep work in chopping which I am very slow at.  Since I think we have some extra spicy cayenne in our house I only used 2 tsp. I also got the salt back to 1 Tbsp.  This was the first time I had a bad reaction to the cayenne floating around so I will be buying some normal pepper soon.  We cooked the fish for about 3 min per side on a grill pan on the stove top.  I should've turned on the fan before I put the fish on because the cayenne pepper had us all coughing.

I didn't have red pepper, so I substituted with green.  We had lots of jicama which I normally don't eat, but in the salsa it was really good. I didn't use any sour cream since I didn't have any, but it was still very good.

Yum! These tacos are sooo good. I can't wait to make 'em again. But, the recipe for the spices makes waaaay too much. So, cut it at least in half (you'll still probably have too much left over. I was wondering how the salsa mixture would taste wit the fish cuz it's different but it turned out amazing together!!! The only thing I changed was blending up a jalapeno, a little homemade salsa and sea salt together and mixed in into the sour cream to give it more of a kick. Toss the tortillas on the grill for a bit. Different and amazing! Definitely a keeper!

I just finished making these! They were super good. I didn't use a lot of the cayenne pepper because it Is extremely spicy. I made pica de gallo also. No jicama or red pepper but it was still very good and flavorful. We just used the pica de gallo & corn for topping & a little shredded mozzarella cheese. We fried flour shells with olive oil because corn shells always seem dry. This is the first time I've ever made FISH and it will not be the last.

This is a great receipe, the salsa is a must. I made a couple of changes due to what I have I hand. For the fish, I combine pepper and cayene and olive oil and brushed it onto the fish and pan fried it until fish flaked. For the salsa, I use whatever peppers were growing in garden: red and green peppers, jalepeno, and cayene. Combine it with cilantro and red onion and yellow onion and corn. I wasn't sure about the lime juice but it is a key ingredient. Depending on how much cayene pepper you use, sour cream is a great side to have to mellow out the spice. Its a prety quick receipe to make as long as you have two people working on it (the chopping takes awhile)

This recipe is amazing! In the years I've been making this I've still never been able to get my hands on jicama, but I like to add a can of black beans and throw sliced avocado on top. Also, depending on the crowd sometimes ill beer batter the fish till its nice and crispy!

We really enjoyed this recipe! I added avocado and next time I will be adding tomatoes as well as a little lemon. It almost didn't need the tortilla. I ate this without it and it was just as good, plus you get to see all the gorgeous colors this salsa creates. I had never used jicama before and I am hooked! I love it! Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty.  I grilled the peppers and onion.  Did not have jicama or cilantro, but it still tasted great.  The fish was a little too spicy for me.  I will make again but will use less cayenne pepper in the seasoning.

The salsa mixture is delicious but the spices are way too much. I think next time I will just sprinkle salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper instead of using tablespoons.

This was my first attempt at fish tacos. I couldn't find jicama at my grocery store, but the end result seemed fine without it. I am a fan of spicy, flavorful foods, but be certain the word Fiery is appropriate. You will need a large, nice cold drink to accompany this dinner. My husband and adult daughter liked this recipe and said they would like to have it again. The veggie salsa is wonderful! Tip: Some pieces of fish were much spicier than others. When brushing the fish filets with olive oil and spices be sure to apply evenly. I didn't even use all my spice mix. I should have saved the remainder for next time I cook this.

The only thing I would change in this recipe is the spice and how much jicama used. I would half the spice and lightly sprinkle, it was way hotter then expected! Also, there was too much jicama - would use half a cup next time. Other than that, very good!

My dad and I made these exactly as the recipe states. For those who thought the seasoning was spicy, we made the seasoning mix as stated, but did a light sprinkle over the fish. It wasn't too spicy when paired with the corn salsa. We will definitely be making these again.

These are great fish tacos! I made it exactly as stated, except I adjusted it for 2 people. I also add a pinch of Old Bay to the cayenne pepper mix. We like spice! I think you could substitute any other variety of fish, but the tilapia is good because it is so light. Thanks for the recipe.

I would highly recommend Jenn's Catfish Sandwich Sauce with this instead of the sour cream. We added black beans, and used frozen corn in the veggie salsa, which worked out well. Marinating the white fish in olive oil, chili powder and lime juice was lovely. Thank you for the advice rhooster! I made my non fish eating husband chicken tacos with the same spice blend sprinkled during cooking and it was again excellent. Do take the time to consider a chipotle mayo instead of the sour cream, the veggie salsa compliments it well.

Super yummy recipe. Do not use that much salt. I always add salt to my taste, so please do this as well. 2tbsp's is uncalled for unless you are serving a dozen people! The seasoning is a little simple and can be overly spicy for some. I also just use an oil and lemon with oregano type marinade with a bit of cayenne and this comes out delicious. 

If you want, you can also add some chopped fresh cilantro and lime juice to the sour cream a few hours earlier and it will have a nice flavor. 

I also pan fry soft shells and place them hanging down through the oven wrack and this cuts down on fat in place of crunchy shells.

The fish was tasty but too salty and a little too spicy, though I enjoy spicy foods. I added a tomato based salsa to mine to make the tacos more flavorful. Also, I would recommend flour tortillas. Corn is better for dishes that are baked as it falls apart easily.

I really liked this; I made it for a New Years Eve supper for my family on the go. I will say I used only 1 tsp of cayenne which my son and I thought was perfect; my husband and daughter felt it was too hot, so we will back down to about 3/4 tablespoons next time. I also placed whole unshucked ears of corn in microwave for 2 minutes before shaving kernels off.

This was so tasty. A must try and healthy the whole family liked and wanted seconds.I didn't use all the spices based on past reviews. We baked them instead of grilling.  Next time we will throw in tomatoes and double the salsa to eat with tostidos.

Didn't do the corn salsa, I always use the white sauce from "Fish 
Tacos/BREESE823", but I did use the spices from this recipe for the fish.  WAAAAAAYYYYY too much salt (maybe a typo and should be 2 teaspoons). 1/2 it at the least.  Cayenne amount is really hot, but if you like it that way keep it otherwise decrease that amount too.  But other than that the rub is a keeper for the fish.

My daughter found a new veggie she will eat... though still not the fish.  My son said it tastes like onion and won't touch it.  My husband and I enjoyed this, but it does overwhelm the fish (good thing in my case).

I had some jicama I wasn't sure what to do with and came across this recipe.  I only made the salsa which turned out nicely- fresh and healthy. Using fresh corn makes all the difference.  I had leftover grilled Seabass (fantastic recipe on this site, try it) I used for the tacos.  Very light and delicious.  I am not a huge fan of jicama but in this recipe it's not at all offensive!  I will make the salsa again as a salad.

Used Chicken and marinated in chipotle marinade.  The chipotle gave it a nice kick, and I omitted the cayenne called for in the recipe. Sauteed the chicken in a bit of EVOO for several minutes and used them.  Combo of spicy chicken, sour cream and fresh salsa was AMAZING.  Made a lot of salsa though, so either cut it in half next time or double chicken recipe.  

Also made a second night with tilapia fillets and used chipotle seasoning- GREAT!!

Very tasty recipe, but even withholding a bit of heat from the very beginning, this was HOT HOT HOT as written. And we like hot. It also makes a TON of the corn salsa, so next time I will probably halve that and halve the salt/chili powder.  If you lightly pan-fry the corn tortillas they won't break apart as easily and you can get away with only using one.

Delicious :) I'm not one to like fish but I'm trying to add it into my diet and  it was soo tasty.  I changed the cayenne pepper to mexican chilli powder and added cheese as a topping. I think I found my go to fish dish!

So good.  I've used this recipe 3 times now and have not made many changes other than trying the fish in 1 inch chunks instead of on the grill.  The corn salsa is unreal with the lime.  Thanks.

This recipe was a hit!  Lots of non-fish lovers at the table tonight, but everyone was mm-mming and asking for seconds.  Just topped with some red chili sauce and shredded colby jack.  Definitely making again!

These are great fish tacos. I used Halibut instead, just because I dont like tilapia. And plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream, for less calories and fat. My husband had no clue! And he loved them! So did my 4 year old daughter. I will make these again for sure and would gladly serve them when we have friends over.

This is WAY TO SPICEY! Those words have NEVER come out of my fiance's mouth, but they did today. I used half the recommended amount of cayenne and it is still all I could taste. I am willing to try it again but I seriously recommend maybe using 1/3 the amount of cayenne they tell you to.

The jicama adds the perfect crunch.  These were AmAzInG!  I also added black beans and corn to the salsa. A slice of avacado.  No cayenne on the little one's fish - just oil.  YUM

We loved the salsa, but the fiery fish was simply overpowering -- and I cut the cayenne in half!  We like spicy, but the flavors need to be in harmony -- this was not.  The corn salsa is very different and was super delicious, and I will remake this with well-seasoned fish -- but to rate the recipe as-is, it only gets 3 stars in my book.

My husband LOVES this.  Its a little hot for the kids and me so I have backed down the cayenne to 1 tablespoon.  I shared the recipe with my sister and she has been making it often too.  I always have flour tortillas on hand so mostly use those but have used the corn too.  Great either way.

Very good. I think that next time I make it I won't use quite so much cilantro. I did like how the coolness of the salsa blends well with the fiery fish but even being a cilantro person I think it was just a bit much. Other than that great take on fish tacos!

Pretty good! Loved it with thecorn tortillas but I wish I wouldn't have used so much lime juice-took away from the mixed flavors of everything!

Wow! This is so spicy at least for me.  I loved it but wow its hot.  The fresh salsa is great, I would reduce the ceyenne pepper by one tablespoon next time to kill some of the spice.

Quick and easy to make but WAY too much spice. I only used half the seasoning mixture and the cayenne had everyone in the house coughing before we even tasted it. I think this would be better with less seasoning and will try it again.

Sooo good. We loved it! the spice on the fish goes perfect with the fresh salsa. I couldn't find jicama and it tasted fine without it. I made a slaw with lime juice red pepper flakes and a little salt and pepper and that was also great on the fish. Thanks for a great recipe.

The crunchy salsa was fantastic.  I found jicama and that definitely was where most of the crunch comes from.  The combination of veggies was perfect.  I cut all the corn from the cob, steamed in some water in the microwave then shocked it with ice.  That way the ingredients stayed cold.  I'm not rating this five stars because it was entirely too spicy.  I halved all the spices and sprinkled the fish with my hands.  I love me some spicy food, but it was just too much.  Maybe too much black pepper?  I keep sneezing uncontrollably.  So definitely will keep the crunchy salsa but will need to dramatically tone down the spiciness.

Easy and authentic Mexican flavor! We just returned from Cozumel and wanted fresh ingredients and big flavor like we had on the island... This hit the spot. And my first time working with jicama, it added a great texture.

I absolutely loved this fresh salsa, I added some purple cabbage that gave it just a little extra color and flavor! I switched up the recipe as well using shrimp and fresh mahi tuna. I also added my  own blend of seasoning, Cajun spice and Mc Cormics fiery 5 pepper seasoning. This is a definitely a new favorite of mine!

Very good.  I used half of the cayenne pepper, still pretty spicy.  I also made the sauce from a previous poster: sour cream, cilantro, lime juice, jalapeno.  Will make again.

I have tried different recipes but this one wins hands down.  My family loves them and not everyone is a fish eater!  The jicama/corn salsa is the best and it compliments the tilapia perfectly. I never have left overs.

I knew this dish was great when my picky-eater fiancé asked me to make him one. He loves spicy and this dish fit the need! I tried it with cheese. Stick with the sour cream, it tastes much better.

I made this last night and wow was it delicious.  The salsa with the jicama was excellent...what a great flavor the jicama adds.  Definitely try to find some if you can.  It was abit on the spicy side so if you dont like a lot of spice, reduce the cayenne pepper.  I made it with haddock and broiled it in the oven...I love haddock, but I think it was a little bit too much for this dish.  next time I will try the tilapia.

This was really good and easy, but a little "too fiery" if you ask me.  Cutting the cayenne next time, but will be making this repeatedly.

I thought this was a great recipe, but will need to modify it next time. Here's the rundown...

1) For our household, we need to cut back on the cayenne to half or less and find something else to create the flavor (can't discredit the original recipe for this, it does say 'fiery' right in the title!). 

2) WAY too much salt. It was the salt, not the cayenne that made the fish nearly inedible. We'll cut it to about 2 tsp. instead of 2 Tbsp. 

3) Couldn't find a jicama at the store, so we used a golden delicious apple we had lying around.  It worked great to provide the sweet and crunch needed. The salsa was AWESOME!

4) We used white corn hardshell taco shells (pre-packaged) and they worked well.

I loved the recipe and will continue to modify and perfect for our needs.  It's definitely making its way into our rotation!

This recipe is AMAZING! The crunchy salsa is PERFECT! I sometimes add a little more lime juice, and per the suggestions of others use red peppers and black beans instead of jimaca. Absolutely delicious and SUPER easy!

I made this tonight and got rave reviews. I had always loathed the idea of fish tacos...dont know why, maybe I pictured a fish - head still on sticking out of a hard taco shell... Anyhow, this recipe was great and very quick and easy to prepare. We'll definitely put it into our dinner rotation.

Very good!  Jicama added a nice crunch, but wasn't necessary for flavour.

Ah-Mazing!  This might be the best thing I have made all year.  My hubby and I ate it all up in record time.  I put some avocado slices on it and used flour tortillas as that is what I had.

These were very good, and different than most of the tilapia recipes I've tried. I did tone down the spices because I'm a wimp, and used flour tortillas because I like them better than corn, but other than that, I followed the recipe.

This was FANTASTIC. I've never made fish tacos before and I was low on ingredients, so I picked this recipe when browsing. I didn't have the jicama or red bell pepper, but it didn't matter at all! I also used a white onion since I didn't have a red one in the house. I read another review that recommended warming the tortillas on the grill. I can't stress enough what a perfect tip that was. It made for a smoky, delicious flavor! I will say that my husband thought they were a little too spicy for his liking, but he still loved the flavor. I'll cut the cayenne by half next time I make these for his sake -- and there will definitely be a next time. Soon!

I like medium hot, but this was too much cayenne and was very salty.  I am glad that I only did one side of the fish.  Next time I will sprinkle each spice individually over the fish instead of using the large measurements. After doing one side I still had half left over. The corn salsa was very good but I will cut the serving in half next time.

This is a wonderful recipe.  My husband loved it.  I thought the salsa was so tasty.  I am a vegetarian and I just ate the salsa with a little lettuce, cheese and crema on the tortilla.  Yum!

All I can say is wow!  These were better than any fish taco I've had in a restaurant.  The only things I changed were, I only used 1 tbl. spoon of salt. 2 sounded like way too much.  Also I did not have jicama.  Be warned the fish truly in fiery.  If you do not like spicy you should tone the spices down.

Wow, talk about a flavorful dish! I especially loved the corn salsa. I think the jicama is really what put it over the top for me. Plus, it's so simple yet impressive! The only thing I would do different next time is decrease the cayenne pepper used to season the fish by half the amount called for or more because it is waaay too spicy for my taste as written in the recipe (although that's expected from the title of this recipe!). So if you don't like super spicy food, BEWARE and reduce the amount of cayenne pepper!!!

Very yummy, easy dinner! I just baked the fish at 450 for 10 minutes, as our grill was out of propane. This will be perfect in warm weather when I need a quick dinner that still impresses with complex flavors.

These fish tacos were really tasty!  The tangy jicama salsa really makes them great.  I oven-fried the fish instead of grilling.  Dilute some mayo with a little water until yougurty.  Add spices.  Dip fish in seasoned mayo and then Panko breadcrumbs.  Bake on a lightly oiled baking sheet at 500 degrees for ~ 10 minutes.

I also added black beans to the salsa and sauteed the corn and beans first.  I could not locate jicama but will continue to look for it for the next time I make this recipe.

I made this dish for my hubbys b-day, this was one of the best fish taco recipes I have tried. I did change a few things...I used 1 tabl. cayenne pepper, which still turned out very spicy, I might go with a teaspoon next time. Also I used 1 tea. salt, instead of 2 tabl. and 1 tea. fresh ground pepper. Also I'm not a huge fan of corn tortillas, instead I used 6" flour tortillas! Other than that, its a great recipe, a keeper, and a great way to get the kiddos to eat fish! Thanks for sharing=)

OMG!! These were out of this world! We love spicy so these were perfect. I did change the salsa a bit. I do not like bell peppers so I left them out. I replaced the jicama (couldn't find it) with cucumber as another reader suggested and added chopped avocado. It was very refreshing. I thought about adding some chopped mango to it next time. This truly deserves all 5 stars!!

Excellent! I halved the recipe, but I think next time I'll make half the amount of salsa since I have ton left over. Also, instead of grilling I steamed the fish and then sprinkled it with cayenne, salt and lemon pepper. Super yummy! :)

This is a great recipe.  We enjoyed it quite a bit.  I do agree with other reviewers about the recipe for the sprinkle being too much.  I used all of it and we couldn't believe how strong it was.  We had to take some fish out to make it okay for us to eat.  Next time, I would only use 1/4 to 1/3 of the recipe.  The salsa was excellent, I couldn't believe how good it was since it only has lime and cilantro leaves to taste it with.  I found jicama in my not so ethnic grocery store in a section where they sell fresh hot peppers instead of other produce section.  I also used multi grain flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas.  Yummy, definitely will be a repeat.

These were quite good.  I made them as written, but it was really HOT. Now, I love all things hot, but this one even had my eyes watering.  I will be making this recipe again since it was so delicious and easy but I'll reduce the cayenne to 2 tsp instead of tablespoons.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I LOVED this!!! Having said that, it is very hot. A bit too hot for my family. If you prefer less spicy, cut the cayenne in half. Can't fault the recipe though, the word "Fiery" is in the name of the recipe. Made a slight change... I don't care for raw onion, so I put the salsa in a skillet for about 6-8 minutes to soften them, then chilled the salsa afterward.

Overall this recipe is very delicious. It has a wide variety of tastes that all work great together. My wife and I made this and loved it. We didn't care much for the corn tortillas and instead served it with the fish over a bed of the salsa and some out-of-the-box Spanish rice with a dollop of sour cream on the side. Anyone not familiar with jicamas should be aware that they have a fruity and apple-like taste and texture, which we found just a tad too fruity with the lime juice. We followed another person's suggestion and added some pinto and black beans to the salsa which we highly recommend. Overall it was very good but be sure to tweak the salsa and the seasoning to your liking.

This was an EXCELLENT dinner! Loved the heat of the fish, contrasting with the crunchy corn salsa. My only change was that I only used 2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper, not tablespoons. It was definitely hot enough for us! This is a great dinner, easy to prepare, not much clean up. We will definitely have this again soon.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe so much we had it two nights in a row.  Couple of things we did differently, no jicama (could not find any at our local grocer) and 1 T of salt instead of 2. Second night, my husband added black beans to the corn salsa.  Very tasty meal!

This was really good.  It was extremely spicy, more than I'd want on a weekly basis, but for every once in awhile it was amazing.  Never had jicama before, but it really worked in this.

This was delicious!  I changed the salsa a bit b/c I didn't have jicama and red pepper so I used black beans and diced tomatoes instead and it was very good.  I love jicama and will honour the original recipe the next time I make it (our grocer ran out of jicama last time).  I also didn't make it too spicy and used mahi mahi instead.  It's a very flexible recipe which is always nice!  Thanks for sharing!

This turned out really good.  I did it a little bit different.  I used a cup of taco sauce with the corn, cilantro.I also baked the fish.

I really liked this recipe, I too reduced the cayenne pepper and salt and am glad I did because it was plenty spicy an salty without the full amount. The salsa is excellent and if you want to cut down on carbs, it makes an excellent side dish for the fish. I pan fried my fish in olive oil and served the tacos with chihuahua cheese, guacamole and sour cream on corn tortillas. Delicioso!

This was delicious, will definitely make again. I added diced avocado to the corn salsa. It is really spicy though but I love spice in my food so it was good for me, but for those of you who can't handle spicy I suggest you add a small amount of the cayenne pepper.

AMAZING!!  While I'm not a huge fish-eater, I absolutely LOVED this meal!  It was light, yet hearty and had just enough spice!  I made a few changes to the original recipe:  I used shredded cabbage instead of jicama and left out the lime zest (I simply used the fresh lime juice).  I also pan-cooked the fish intead of grilling- and it was perfect!!!  I wish I could have given it 6 stars!

It was a little too "fiery" for us and next time I'll halve the amount of cayenne.  I also couldn't find jicama and substituted cabbage.  These were nice and light and will definitely be served over and over.

I've always waited for my Fiance to come downstairs for dinner.  Not the night I made these tacos!  As soon as I walked in the door, I yelled to him and started making my first taco.  Eat was delish!  My mouth was on fire, but we love super spicy food.  Can't wait to eat all the Thanksgiving turkey so we can have tacos again!

This was great and super easy.  Flour tortillas are fine but corn tortillas complement the flavor in the fish a little better.

The salsa was lovely to look at, but was a little bland.  I think cooking the corn and adding black beans would be great, as was suggested. We adjusted the seasoning considerably and it was still plenty hot!  The salsa takes a while to prepare, so we might not make this very often, but it is a very yummy fish taco.

This is my favorite fish taco recipe.  I think it is outstanding! I find it spicy, but i love the flavor it gives the fish.  The only change I make is using flour tortillas instead of corn, just because it I prefer them.

This was not what I expected at all... the salsa had too much onion, I would definitely cut it down a lot next time... It also wasn't very hot or juicy.  I think I would add a jalepeno and maybe a tomato next time...

I guessed this would be WAY too spicy and made the following changes: Substitute chili powder instead of cayenne, add 1/2 tsp cayenne, use 1/2 Tbsp pepper.  When grilling fish, I placed aluminum on grill, cooked on medium/low and did NOT flip fish as they became too flaky and would have fallen apart.  I also grilled some sliced chicken breasts with the same olive oil and spice mix for the non fish eaters in the family, and the chicken tasted equally good with these spices.  Had to slice chicken breast into thin chunks a bit smaller than frozen chicken tenders so they would cook at the same rate as the fish.  This was soo yummy!

I give it 4.5 really--the fish, although I love spicy, could have had some extra spices blended in to give it some extra dimension. I would add a blend of cumin, coriander with some chili pepper instead of so much cayenne. My guests thought it was too spicy but loved the salsa. I will make again with above changes.

Excellent! Cut back the seasonings. BBQ'd the Tilapia, added garlic, a little olive oil to salsa, added avocado on the side. Don't forget the paper plate trick, if your tortillas fall apart, a small flexable 4" or 6" paper plate (not styrofoam) folded in half or a 9" folded in forths make a great taco holder while you are eating them.

Absolutely Fabulous! I made this last night for an impromptu BBQ we had at our house.  I made the Fiery fish as stated in the recipe and I sprinkled some Cajun seasoning (Not hot at all) on some pounded out chicken.  The kids had the chicken tacos and the adults had the fiery fish!! EVERYONE was very pleased!!  The only change that I made was that I added a little bit of Red wine vinegar to the Corn salsa.  It added a bit more acidity to it.  I’m sure that I could have just added more lime juice but I figured that I’d experiment.  It was a HIT!  I didn’t even make any sides or anything….these alone were perfect!

wow!!! when they say fiery they aint kiddin!!! very good recipe for the lover of spicy foods. my husband absolutely devoured these tacos. i did spray the fish with pam cooking spray and added a seafood spice mixture (store bought) and then proceeded with the recipe as followed. the cayenne pepper gives it that nice blackened cajun look and taste after grilling on the bbq. try these . you will like.

I stumbled across this recipe while looking for a shrimp taco recipe and decided to use this and substitute shrimp in for the fish.  Luckily, it was a good decision, because this recipe is fabulous!  I didn't use jicama (because like others I could not find any at my grocery store) and marinated the shrimp in half of the lime juice and lime zest along with the spices and cut down the cayenne pepper to my family's taste (my husband does not like hot).  Additionally, I didn't add the sour cream directly to the corn salsa because I thought the salsa would keep better for the next day if the salsa and sour cream were added to the taco separately.  Other than those changes (which are mostly just for our personal tastes) this recipe was a hit!  We only made enough for one meal but my husband still asked for it the next night.  Thank you for this recipe, I will be using it for many diners to come!

These were tasty.  My husband went out to Long Beach for work and tried fish tacos and really enjoyed them.  He's not the biggest fan of slaw though so I've been looking for a recipe without.  The corn/jicama salsa is an excellent substitution-adds a nice, cool crunch and would also be excellent served over grilled chicken.  I would however suggest going a little easy on the cayenne rub. I love spicy food, but this made my eyes water and nose run! Will definately make theses again and again.

Wow!! Super easy and delicious! I modified the recipe based on previous reviews of the fish being too spicy. The only seasoning I used was Tony Chachere's Creole seasoning and the fish was just right. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This was really simple.  I baked the fish because my grill is out of service in February.  The corn salsa is great.  I wish I had some sour cream, that would have been really good, I think.

Way too spicy for me.  I'll make it again, but I'll reduce the cayenne pepper.  I will also probably add flour to make the fish crispy.

The fish was really spicy and dry the way the recipe calls to make it.  I would use less spice, and salt.  Certianly not the best fish taco recipe I've made.

I think the spice on the fish is just too fiery.  My husband and I love spicy food, but this was just too much red pepper. I'll make again but cut way back on the red pepper.  The salsa is excellent and I will definitely make that again.

This was delicious!  My husband and I loved it!!  We then served it to friends who also agreed.  I eyeballed the spices, but we love hot stuff so it was perfect.  So fun and colorful!!  We used talapia and are making again tonight.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

The Crunchy Corn Salsa really makes this receipe.  But beware....I love spicy foods, the spicier the better but the 2 tbl. cayenne pepper and 1 tbl. black pepper is way to over powering.  Cut this in half.  ALso, I used salmon instead of tilapia and it was delicious.

I loved the idea of this recipe, which is why I gave it 4 stars, but I changed the "corn salsa" since others thought it was bland.  I made my own: corn, green peppers, and onions sauteed in olive oil and then seasoned with chili powder, lime juice, and salt and pepper).  They were great served with chopped fresh tomatoes and onions--definitely something I will make again and again.

I loved these tacos.  Just enough spice.  The corn salsa...tasted so fresh.  I just added sour cream and yum.  I didn't change a thing.  I used warm corn tortillas and I haven't had better.

Very nice meal, and so quick!  I loved the relish and used the leftovers on my salad the next day.  I can't comment on the fish to much, i didn't follow the spice recipe at all.  I mixed up some of my best spices for spicy fish and threw them on. 

I will make this again cause everyone loved it.

I followed the recipe with a few minor changes and I used tilapia.  The taste was OK, I didnt think it had much flavor and I used extra red pepper.

Wow!  This was H-O-T!  I used ONE TEASPOON for 3/4 lb of Tilapia and it was fiery enough.  My lime disappeared so I can't truly review the salsa; however, I added cream cheese to the corn mixture and it was the perfect complement to the fiery fish (omit red onion if adding softened cream cheese).  I will definately make fish again - it was insanely delicious wrapped up in a warm whole wheat tortilla.

I live in the southwest and these were not what we would consider "fiery" around here, but they were GREAT.  For more "fire," however, I added a finely chopped jalapeno to the salsa, as well as some garlic powder and two chopped tomoatoes.  It was terrific--like a Mexican salad.  We virtually inhaled 2 pounds of Tilapia (made a bit more, as I had extra salsa, given the added ingredients) amongst four people!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe; I should add that it totally eclipsed another fish taco recipe (battered cod with cabbage type topping) from this site, which we previously thought was great.  Until now! :-)

This was soooo salty!  I don't know if 2 tablespoons is a typo or if they really love salt.  If I make this again I probably wouldn't use any salt at all.  The corn salsa was great.  I used cabbage instead of jicama.

This was really good, but soooooo spicy. I had to wash some of them off the fish before cooking, & the spices were so strong and in the air that everyone who came into the kitchen started coughing! But they all liked the flavor! I'll make it again but will go easy on the spices. We liked the salsa, & I also added some shredded lettuce & a bit of cheese.

This recipe was wonderful! I'm not really fond of fish, but this was a winner.  Not too spicy as you might think from all the pepper in it.  The salsa is so different from anything I have ever made.  We loved it.
I will diefinetely make this one again.

These were excellent and a welcome change from the ordinary.  Next time I will try grilled shrimp.  If you have never used cayanne pepper before, touch a very small bit on your tounge to gague how spicy to make them.

This was amazing!  Nice way to have a healthy dinner that my kids will devour.  My 14 year old daughter loved this so much she asked that her Dad leave her some leftovers so she would could take in her lunch to school.  So easy and has a ton of flavor!  I did just a pinch of cayenne as I can't handle stuff too spicy.  I omitted the sour cream too to make it healthier.  I also only salt & peppered to taste (Tablespoons seemed excessive!)  None of these omissions affected the taste--it was still amazing!  Next time I will double the recipe as it makes a great salsa for tortilla chips.  For those having trouble finding jicama, Try Walmart, which was the only place that I could find it.  It really is essential in making this recipe seem fresh.

This was so easy and DELICIOUS!!! The only differences I made were: 1) instead of using sour cream I drizzled a little bit of Sriracha Mayo on them and 2) used canned corn which I grilled and let me say this was bomb.

I had extra pieces of baked Cajun flounder and jazzed it up with this salsa! The texture/ flavor of this salsa was a pleasant surprise! I will definitely make this again and again!

This turned out better than I anticipated. Don't forget to double-up the tortillas when serving and don't skip the jicama! I found it without problem in the local grocery store.

Added salt to salsa and subbed prawns sautéed in butter, garlic and about half of the dry spice mix.  EXCELLENT!

Very easy and filling.  Added fresh avocado slices. Made a perfect summer time dinner option. Next time I might consider browning the corn for a few minutes on the skillet to give it an extra kick of flavor.

Delicious for the third time.  I agree that half of the Cayenne, Pepper and Salt is adequate.  Cooking the corn to brown/blacken in stove top fry pan gave it a nicer sweet crisp taste...  Avocado is a must.  Great recipe that we love.

Fabulous and I love spice!  Too hot for my daughter though, so for a family’s diverse palate I’d dial down the spice a bit next time.

Our family recently switched to a Mediterranean diet and this was one of the recipes  I made first.  The whole family loved it! I couldn't find jicamas so I substituted with green apples, which added a nice crunch and sweetness to the dish.  I didn't skimp on the cayenne pepper, but only used a pinch of salt.
Definitely will be a staple in our family menu.

HOLY MOLY, this is spicy.  I made the salsa, loved it.  Overall, the way it was written...I would give it a five if the measurements were accurate.  If you follow the recipe without any modifications, the fish is inedible.  I cut the spices down by half and even that was a bit much.  I also paired it with the "sauce" from the other fish taco recipe on here and avocado.  I ended up broiling the fish for 3-4 mins per side.  I'll be making this again with less spices!

I would like to make a few suggestions based on reviews.  Fresh corn right off the cob is sweet and worth trying if you haven't ever eaten raw corn.  It makes a fantastic salsa.  But if you not inclined to used fresh raw, grilling it really brings out the sweetness and in lieu of that, pan frying  in a small amount of butter is good, too.
Also, note that the author of this recipe says to mix up the spices and season to taste.  Use what you need and store the spice mix until the next use.  Plenty of chefs, Paul Prudhomme and Emril to name two, have spicy cajun recipes that suggest making larger than necessary spice blends that can be stored.  So use your best judgement on the spicing.

I did not have jimaca,  and I really combined some of another recipe on this site call Spicy Fish Tacos with Fresh Lime Sauce. I made a little of two toppings. From this I roasted the corn and diced red bell pepper after coating with Olive oil on a cookie sheet. stirring often till done. Then mixed in some chopped cilantro salt and pepper and lime juice. Then with some left over slaw, I added chopped cilantro and lime juice. My slaw recipe is sweet so add sugar if yours is not, then covered the fish with taco seasoning and seared them in a iron skillet. Chopped the fish up in chunks with a fork, and mixed a little of each topping in the taco added a dab of sour cream and Salsa.  They were good and roasting the corn and bell pepper in the oven gave it good flavor and snap. Other half gave it 4 stars lol, I will be making again.

These are really quite delicious, and pretty quick to make too. I didn't use jicama (didn't have it) or cilantro (don't like it), but it's still delicious. I used whiting in place of tilapia also. This has just the right amount of spice, and then sweet from the corn; add in the fresh lime juice, and the flavor combo is just perfect! I also topped them with some avocado and tomato; and I highly recommend adding that as well!

Most of the reviews stated the spices were too much, I reduced the amount of spice and found it to be too tame for us.  Not "fiery" at all.  I blackened the fish (pollock) and cooked it in the oven using a cast iron skillet, it's wintertime and the grill's in in the garage.  I think the fish could use a crunchy coating and plan to dredge in panko crumbs the next time.  We found using 1 tortilla to be adequate, 2 tortillas caused it to be too bready.  We did enjoy the salsa, although I couldn't find jicama in our local stores.  Rachael Ray suggests that a green apple is a good substitute.  I only had a red delicious apple, and I used a bit of that.  I made the flavored sour cream other reviewers spoke about using cilantro, jalapeno, lime juice, cumin, salt, oil and chili powder.  I refrigerated the salsa and the sour cream 1-2 hours prior to the meal to allow the flavors to meld.  Spanish rice and a side salad finished out the meal.  I would make this again using more spice next time.

These were good, but thought fish lacked flavor.  I was pretty careful with the cayenne which may have been my problem.  We add some taco sauce directly to the fish after it was in the tortilla which helped.  Salsa was good.

The only change that I made was using cod instead of tilapia.  My husband said it was a keeper.  The corn salsa is so refreshing and such a great accompaniment to the spicy fish.

Awesome recipe for fish tacos! This will be my go to fish taco for grilled or baked fish, as others have pointed out the seasonings can be adjusted, I preferred mine as the recipe called for and prepared additional plain fish for those to season as they will! I seared the Cod fillets in a cast iron skillet, then broiled for at least 10 minutes, and kept an eye on the skillet. Then added black beans to the corn salsa to compliment the finished fish. Excellent meal, thank you!

Made this last night for supper. The seasoning is over the top HOT, and I like heat, so mind the amount you use..too much OMG smoking HOT and far too salty...ICK! Halve the cayenne, pepper and 1 tsp of salt is more than enough, IMO. I substituted greek yogurt for sour cream which put the fire out. The corn salsa with the crunchy jicama was great too, this recipe just needs tweaking for spices and I will try it again...MODIFIED.

I didn't make this recipe exactly; but used it as a base to make it work for my family's likes and allergies.  Changes I made (impt note: I doubled the recipe for my brood size):  I fried the fish (kids won't eat grilled).  Added the spice ingredients in the same measurements as described to about 3 cups of flour, dunked the fish in an egg/fat free half-and-half wash and the seasoned flour and and fried them for about 3 min on each side in about 3 TBS of olive oil - just enough to get the flour wet.  For the corn salsa, I roasted 2 cans of corn on med/high heat w/ 1 TBS Olive Oil in a cast iron pan.   Instead of cilantro (allergy), I substituted for 1/2 the amount of flat leaf parsley, squeezed in 4 limes (omitted zest) and mixed in 3 packets of sweetener to offset the bitter taste of the parsley.  Mixed it in w/ the veggies.   Everyone loved them.   Even w/ my changes, I could tell that the original recipe would be 5-star b/c it's all about the corn salsa baby!  The crunchiness of the veggies, especially adding in the jicama, just took fish tacos to another delightful place.  I can see where grilling the fish w/ the recipe spice amounts could be very hot, but she did name it "fiery".  Blending the spices with the flour and frying took away some of the heat.

I loved the corn salsa, and would give that a 5 star rating, but wasn't wild about the fish seasoning.  I used cod fillets, and felt the seasoning way overpowered the cod.  I made the recipe as written.  I will definitely make the salsa again, but probably not the fish.  I had left overs of the salsa, so served it with tortilla chips - delicious!

This is a winner meal and will be added to our normal rotation.  The salsa is amazing for such simple ingredients:  light, fresh, crunchy, and the perfect topping to the fiery fish.  The only thing I changed was to roast the corn and it added so nicely to the salsa' s flavor!  Amazing summer meal!

Absolutely delicious! Whatever you do, do not listen to your husband and add jalapeños to the salsa. The fish is seasoned perfectly and spicy enough. Certain bites that had jalapeños was too much.

My family loves this dish but I do alter the seasoning proportions. I like things hot but i would cut the cayenne fir the fish seasoning mix in half - even less if you cant stand the heat. On the salsa i've used the jicama but sometimes i cant find it and i now substitute a diced apple. Fuji apples work nice to add a slightly sweet, crunchy offset the other flavors. I usually dice a fresh, seeded jalapeño for the salsa and add a pinch if salt, pepper and cayenne. Awesome with tilapia or any favorite fish. We we on vacation recently and used fresh mahi mahi and it was fantastic.

DO NOT ADD AS MUCH SEASONING AS THEY ARE SAYING!!!! OMG my mouth was burning and I used LESS than half of the seasoning recommended. It was also a lot of cilantro to the point that it was overpowering

Delicious!  I seasoned crappie fillets and fried in a skillet (with 2Tbs of olive oil) and added black beans (rinsed and drained) to the corn salsa.  This one is a keeper!

Great tacos!  Instead of salt and pepper I used taco seasoning (recipe from this website). I sprinkled the fish generously   and continued as per the recipe.   Since jicama is very hard to find in Poland I simply used a diced cucumber in the salsa.

Easy to make and a nice, light meal. I added a clove of minced garlic and some red pepper flakes to the salsa to kick up the heat, but it was pretty good even before those additions. Will make again!

So good. Made as is except with half the salt and half the cayenne pepper. Still was a bit salty. And cooked on the stove instead of the grill. Came out great. For a lower calorie option it would also be great as a filet with the corn salsa, without the tortilla and the sour cream.

I made this with shrimp instead of fish, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly and we LOVED it.  The only change I will make next time is to decrease the amount of corn in the salsa.

I've impressed even the pickiest,  refuse to eat fish taco eaters with this recipe. I also make the 'Lick the spoon cilantro jalapeno aioli' sauce (found on this site) to go over top and it takes these to the next level of deliciousness. If you can't find the jicama for the relish, substitute with daicon and/or radishes (I typically use both).  Going to try tonight with using chili powder and a little cumin in place of the cayenne pepper because there are several in my house that just can't do spice.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe!  I turned the salt, pepper, and Cheyenne pepper measurements to tsp instead of tablespoons and it tasted great.  I also added avocados to the salsa which added flavor.  Instead of using sour cream I used plain Greek yogurt to make it a little healthier.  Will definitely make it again.

followed rhooster's recommendations but I would cut way back on the cayenne pepper, then it would be perfect

Delish! Don't need a grill grate, can simply pan fry the fish in olive or canola oil.  I added jalapeño to the salsa which gave it a delicious kick.  The jicama is key to giving the salsa the perfect crunch and sweetness! Definitely boil your corn in a little sugar water and cut it off the stalk-DO NOT use canned corn. FINALLY, instead of sour cream (this cheapens the dish), finish the tacos with some fresh made guac and a little cotija cheese!  Cheers!

Used the corn salsa part of this recipe with blackened fish seasoning also found on allrecipes along with a green chile sour cream. The jicama in the salsa gave a great crisp and the sweetness of the corn balanced a spicy fish. Would like to have a bit more seasoning or maybe some red wine vinegar to add to the flavor but overall its a good topping for multiple things I imagine.

amazingly fresh. I've made this several times. I substitute fresh parsley vs the cilantro and use less of onion. This allows the red pepper and jicama to stand out more.  Basa is also a great fish for this recipe. great dish to make especially on the cold months - tastes like Summer!

Made it with green bell pepper and red pepper flakes - very bright flavor.  Next time will use red BELL pepper, too.
Remember to put flakier fish, like cod, on tin foil

These are amazing! But even for us Texans, it was spicy! Like burn-your-tongue but you can't stop eating because they're so delicious spicy. Next time I'll use a little less cayenne. The veggies and sour cream balanced the burn, and also made it very fresh and summery. I added avocado, because I can't imagine a fish taco without one, and used green onions instead of red based on preference. Great healthy dinner, good enough for company.

I don't eat tilapia so substituted cod but any mild fish would do I'm sure.  I tried warming the tortillas but they fell apart with the ingredients.  So I tried frying them to make shells and that worked the best for me. Thanks, Louise

The corn salsa is great but the fish ends up being a little bland. Not necessarily the recipe's fault. I might recommend trying a different type of fish.

I love these fish tacos! Packed with flavors! This is one of my all time favorite recipes. The salsa is so good, we eat the leftovers with corn chips. I'm so spoiled now that I don't order fish tacos in restaurants, I make this recipe!

The combination of flavors here is amazing! I didn't have jicama or cilantro, but everything else blended perfectly. I'm not a fan of spicy, but I still added about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and it was a good kick. Overall, love the recipe.

I modified this recipe beyond recognition because it was raining, and I couldn't access the grill. I also didn't have the right spices, and I threw out the limes before zesting them. STILL, I loved the tacos, and the flavors were balanced...somehow.

I've never had any luck grilling tilapia (sticks to the grate and falls apart when I try to turn it), so I did mine in a non-stick skillet, but wow, it was good. To those who are complaining it's too spicy, you don't have to use all the spice mix at once! The recipe says "to taste," which will vary by individual. "Add spice to taste" in my house means that my husband's portion gets none and my portion gets double. I like spicy food.

I didn't use the jicima or the cilantro, but added yellow and orange peppers to the salsa. It was delicious! I marinated the fish in basalmic as well, which I think helped keep the moisture on the grill. Definitely recommend this one!

Delicious! I did cut the cayenne pepper amount in half though. It's plenty spicy and less cayenne gives it more of a warm heat, instead of a punch

Easy and tasty! Absolutely try this recipe as original ,then change items out to your liking. I've made this quite a few times. I stick with the basics of this recipe but I change the ingredients occasionally  depending on who I'm feeding,  what I have in fridge and how many people are eating. I have used a breaded frozen haddock filet. I still brush the fish with the spicy oil marinade then I bake it in the oven per box directions. One piece of fish and two tortilla shells is all I need for a dinner for one. I have also used fresh steak, chicken, pork and shrimp in the marinade and BBQ and/or baked. As well I've used any leftovers that's been warmed up in a pan with fresh marinade. I prep other 'taco' type ingredients my family and friends may like, they can add to their own tastes. I love the versatility of these. I also find this easy to travel with for camping and pot lucks, suits all the fussy eaters in the crowd.

WOW! My husband and I just ate this and it is SO yummy! I love the crunchy texture in the salsa, plus it makes for a colorful and impressive looking dish. We added chili powder to the fish spices and cut back on the cayenne (mostly because I was afraid it would be a little too hot). Came out great! Thank you for this recipe! Definitely restaurant quality!

These were pretty good.  You have to make the corn salsa.  As simple as it all seems, all the flavors just marry so well together.  I think you need the red pepper spice on it in order for it to work for you so don't eliminate it and don't be afraid of it because the salsa will soften the spicyness.

I LOVE fish tacos,  I usually substitute plain greek yogurt for the sour cream, and I like to add black beans to the salsa.  the jicama is a great addition, it gives a sweet crunch to the salsa!  Excellent rendition!

This recipe overall was very tasty. I bought a jicama (which is not cheap), and I thought it tasted awful. It had a very bitter after taste, which leads me to believe it was overly ripe. I followed everyone's suggestion, and cut down on the spices. I used a tablespoon of cayenne, teaspoon of pepper and a half teaspoon of salt. The fish didnt seem to have a lot of flavor, but the salsa and sour cream added enough flavor to make up for the fish. Cant wait to have leftovers tonight!

These were great and very simple to make. The only thing i did different was to omit the onion, because I know it,s blasphemy but the only food in this world I cant stand is onions. My boyfriend also loved this recipe even though he didn't think he would.

Absolutely wonderful - I've never used jicama before and it is fabulous in the salsa.  I use frozen corn - no need to thaw - just make the salsa a couple of hours in advance and  the frozen corn will thaw in the fridge while the flavors meld. Julianne the left over jimaca and use it in salads or as a dipping veg.  I heat a cast-iron grill pan on the grill and get it extremely hot before adding the fish.

Like the corn salsa and seasoning on the fish but it has way too much salt and I love salt! That has to be a typo in the recipe.

I am giving this a 3 because there is WAY to much salt in this. I cut it in half and it was still to much!!!!! It would be great with that change, also I mixed some cilantro, lime juice, S&P, chili powder, oil, and sour cream to top it with and that was awesome. The salsa is great as well, very refreshing.

Warning!!! Do not use indoor grill unless you use  a range hood fan.  I didn't think about the fumes from the cayenne pepper becoming homemade Pepper Spray!  I had to open the doors and windows to get some fresh air.  After the air cleared, we thoroughly enjoyed the fish tacos.  The salsa was very light and fresh tasting...I followed the advice of another reviewer and substituted Granny Smith apple for the jicama and the sweetness helped cool the heat of the other ingredients.  I'll definitely serve this again!

I loved this recipe.  I could not find Jicama as it does not grow easily in our area.  I loved the corn salsa.  I would not add as much salt in the future but the rest of the spice was awesome.  I will definately be making this again.

This was a great recipe--I have two growing boys and they absolutely loved it. I made the white sauce (also from this site) to go along with it. I will say that the corn tortillas fell apart a bit so I will probably try using flour next time and I will also double the recipe because everyone wanted seconds and we barely had enough. :)

The corn salsa was awesome!  The amount of cayenne pepper was way too spicy (and we love spicy food).  I also halved the amount of salt and it was perfect.  Next time, I'll put about a teaspoon of cayenne pepper (just sprinkle some on top of the fish).

Instead of cooking the fish the way the recipe recommended, I breaded and fried it. I also added avocado and sour cream to the corn mix. Declicious!

These tacos are awesome. So delicious. I do have to second what another reviewer said however, the rub recipe makes far too much -- really, you can halve it. Also, don't go crazy with coating your fish - the first time I made this I about killed my guests with the heat. It's definitely not for the faint of heart.  The salsa recipe also makes too much but that's fine by my man. We stored it away and he had it as snack with tortilla chips. Much healthier in my opinion than store bought stuff that's full of preservatives.   Also, as a note: I added some homemade guacamole (2 avocados, lime juice, salt, and cilantro mashed together) to cool down the fire from the fish which worked pretty well.

I followed the recipe using half the cayenne and half the salt and it was still a bit too spicy and way too salty!  The salsa was all right but still pretty bland... it's missing something.  Sadly, my favorite part of the dinner was the taco shells!

I gave it only 4 stars since I've made the tilapia using this recipe and have found that it is not very flavorful. This time I used the fish marinade from 'Grilled Fish Tacos with Chipotle-Lime Dressing' recipe on this site and made the corn salsa from this recipe to serve with it which was great. I added in 1/2 of a jalapeno as well as two cloves of garlic, minced. Very good! By combining the two recipes, it makes for very flavorful fish tacos!

Made this tonight! DEEEEEELISH!!!! I almost chopped the end of my thumb off cutting into the jimaca...so be careful if you've never cooked w/that before. It's much harder to slice thru than potatoes!  Next time I cook this, I will use HALF THE SALT.  Other than that, it was very, very yummy!

Sprinkled each seasoning directly on the fish.  Used much less than recipe called for. I prefer flour tortillas.  Added black beans to the corn mixture.  Mixed a little tomato salsa in my sour cream. Wonderful...my husband and I both loved it, healthy, too.

These are the BEST fish tacos I have ever eaten!!! Not only do they taste AMAZING but they are a healthy, guilt free meal. My only suggestion would be to invest in a food chopper if you don't already have one for this recipe, it will save you lots of time. Otherwise, very easy and very delicious meal!

Very good and lite. The corn salsa is beautiful...so colorful and it smells great because of the cilantro. I did use whet tortillas and fat free sour cream which is possibly why I felt this recipe needed a little somthing. It is wonderful but next time I think I'll add Cajun spices and a ranch, jalapeno, cilantro dressing made in blender. A great lite dinner or lunch. I will be making this one again. Hubby liked it and he is a meat and potato kinda guy.

You may want to cut the cayenne to your tastes.  We prefer flour tortillas to corn tortillas.  Rubbing some lime on the tortilla and then squeezing the lime over the taco once assembled really takes these tacos to the next level!

I have made this twice.  The first time I stuck to the recipe and the fish came out SUPER spicy.  There was almost too much seasoning, and the fish couldn't really shine.  The second time I made this recipe, I cut the fish seasoning in half, and it came out MUCH better.  The corn salsa was also very tasty.  Make sure you use the jicama because it makes a difference.

This was awesome! Made slaw from this site "ramen coleslaw" to go on tacos instead of just cabbage and made the white sauce from "fish tacos" also cooked the corn salsa a bit on the stove! I never tried fish tacos but I have learned not to hate something til u try it ovr 24 years of age BC b4 that I wouldn't try stuff BC kids didn't eat it :) finding out I like a lot of stuff I didn't use to!

Wonderful! I liked it more than i anticipated. The salsa was a must! No need to use all the cayenne pepper. I used 3/4 of the original amount.

These were awesum... I omitted the jicama and red onion and doubled the seasoning. I cooked in the olive oil, sprinkeled w/seasoning, then flipped and sprinkled again. Before removing from the pan, I diced the fish into bite size pieces. Great recipe! My husband said it was better than Chipotle. Koodos to you!

These were great! I scaled it to 4 and used whole grain flour tortillas since that's what I had. While grilling I kept sprinkling with spices, which put a nice crust on the fist and definitely made it "fiery"! Next time I might bread in flour or breadcrumbs and panfry it to make it crunchier. The salsa tasted great, don't skip the cilantro! Will make again, thanks!

VERY delicious!  Everyone I've served it for has been dubious at first and in love after the first taco.  I don't mix the seasoning, though - just sprinkle each filet with salt, black pepper, and cayenne to taste.  Works out better for me that way.  I personally prefer flour tortillas, but it's good with the corn too.

I got smart the second time I made this and reduced the cayenne pepper to 1 tablespoon. We love spicy foods but couldn't taste anything but the pepper with 2 tablespoons. Otherwise it's a great recipe.

The corn salsa was the only good thing about this recipe.  I only put 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper for 4pieces of fish and it was still too hot.  My boyfriend that loves anything hot and spicey couldn't even eat it.

I used 8 8oz fillets of tilapia but kept the seasoning at the original amount. It was so salty we could barely eat it after scraping the seasoning off! I questioned it when I looked at it, but did it anyway given the high reviews. We'll definitely make it again, but with maybe a teaspoon of salt instead of the 2 TABLESPOONS it calls off.

Used grilled tuna instead of tilapia and added about 1T Cholula to the sour cream for a more gourmet appearance and taste (yes, we like things h-o-t)!!  Also added drained black beans to the corn/onion/pepper/cilantro mixture and used more lime juice than called for (all this should be done "to taste" anyway). I almost filled up on sampling the wonderful corn concoction (which is very similar to a corn salad I already make) before the fish was finished on the grill! Yummy. As a whole, this is an excellent recipe -- pretty and tasty enough for company-- and I will definitely add it to my summer grilling rotation.

an excellent blend of flavors and textures.  I love the contrast of the sweet and fresh corn salsa with the stinging peppered fish.

We really enjoyed this, and I'm not a fan of fish.  The spices were perfect, but the corn salsa was at a disadvantage because I also made Black Bean and Corn Salsa II, which was a huge hit.  Everyone preferred that over the salsa in this recipe.  Still excellent alternative to boring tacos, I'll do it again.

I only give this 4 stars because it calls for too much salt and cayenne pepper. But otherwise...awesome!! The fresh salsa is great. I live in an apartment so can't grill. I just broiled the fish instead and it turned out really well.

These tacos were DELICIOUS!!! I did make a few changes though. After reading some of the reviews I also decided to use flour tortillas and they tasted much better. The corn tortillas made the tacos taste dry. I also added shredded cabbage to my tacos. I will def be making these again soon!

I substituted black beans for the jicama and ancho chili powder for the cayenne.  I followed the advice of one reviewer and used less spice.  Next time I'll use more.  The fresh salsa is the real key.  It's easy to substitute different vegetables, but use the lime and cilantro for that great fresh salsa taste.

I don't have alot of experience cooking with fish so I was leery at first, but this eas really easy to do, and it tasted great! The only thing I would do is add some lime juice to help carry on the flavor of the corn salsa.

Note: You do NOT need to cover the entire fish with the pepper...just sprinkle it on. My husband and I LOVE really spicy foods, but our mouths were on fire! A little less would have made this dish great :)

Oh my goodness! I made this for my roommates and they absolutely loved it. It makes a lot of food so we had leftovers for a bit. I felt like I ate this everyday for a week and I never got tired of it. It's so refreshing. Only problem is, watch out for the cayenne pepper. As I was cooking with it, the whole house was coughing there heads off. It was very spicy! I didn't change anything from the recipe though. It was amazing!

These tacos were great! I used mahi-mahi instead of tilapia because I like mahi better. I couldn't find jicama at our grocery store, so I added a couple of jalapenos instead. Also, I served with flour tortillas and guacamole on the side. This is a keeper!

Excellent recipe! I was a little skeptical because I'm not a huge fan of red bell peppers but it didn't matter.  We loved it!  I can hardly ever please my kids at dinner but with this recipe 3 out of 4 kids loved it.  That might not even be a fair assessment as I know he was busy dreaming of the "candy bar pie" we were having for dessert : ) Anyway-- it was wonderful, even in the midde of winter, made in a pan on the stove.  The nice thing about this is I really don't think you can mess this up.  Its very easy and versatile.  Thank you!!!!

Take the advise of "rhooster" and it's a 5 star.  Her spicy sour cream sauce really makes these tacos outstanding.

The crunchy corn salsa really made these tacos. I've never had jicama before but let me tell you it's delicious. I make them all the time now. and often use this recipe when entertaining. Only things different I do is add some black beans and use frozen corn, by the time you go to eat it the corn is defrosted and makes it nice, cool and refreshing! Thanks so much for this recipe!!

I just made this tonight and it was delish! I added black beans to the salsa and cooked the fish in a pan with a bit of olive oil and some chopped serrano pepper which i must say added to the heat. i did cut the cayenne and salt back to 1 tablespoon each as i only had 3 good sized pieces of talapia. i would totally make this again.

this was very good except that it was way too hot. the cayenne pepper overpowered the wonderful taste of the corn salsa. (which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars) I'll make it again but next time maybe I'll leave out the pepper rub for the fish (cayenne pepper, black pepper and salt) and just use lemon pepper. but it was delicious!

I have seen recipes for fish tacos many times and have skipped past them thinking "maybe not". I am so pleased I did not make that mistake with this recipe!  This was also my first experience using jicama in a recipe; I typically will eliminate an ingredient I am not familiar with. Again, glad I didn't make that mistake either. The spice rub on the fish is the perfect compliment to this simple, slightly sweet fresh salsa/relish. My husband and I also found this meal was especially filling, not having late evening hunger pangs. We did substitute whole wheat, high fiber tortilla wraps for the corn.  Be careful w/ the fish rub. Too much is not for the faint of heart. Thank you for this terrific recipe, it is one we shall have many times over and share w/ firnds and family.

This was so good that I made it TWICE in one week. The first time I forgot CORN and it was still delicious. The jicama makes the salsa so try very hard to find it!     My fiance isn't crazy about fish so the 2nd time I made it with chicken seasoned with Mrs. Dash's Fiesta Lime seasoning. It was a HUGE hit... he said it was the best taco he'd ever had in his life. :)    Both times I added black beans and avocado. YUM!

Very tasty.  I made them non-fiery by omitting the cayenne pepper.  Nice flavors and nice texture with the jicama.  A little shredded cheese on top is recommended.

I used catfish instead of tilapia to make it more tex-mexy.  Great! Like other reviewers, I cut it down on the heat. I was unable to get jicama from my grocery store.  I used an apple instead and it came out better than I ever would have expected!

I modified this recipe and it still turned out excellent.  I went to 3 stores and couldn't find jicama (I think it's out of season) so I substituted 1 can of chopped water chestnuts (which I diced).  Instead of cayenne pepper I used 1 TBSP (not 2) of Jamaican hot pepper.  This was delish!

These were very good, thanks for the recipe.  I used far less of the seasoning due to complaints from others that it's too much and too spicy and I did not use jicama. I mixed the sour cream with the juice of half a lime and added garlic powder and chipotle cayenne. Very tasty. Thanks.

Very easy and oh so good!  My girls don't like raw onions, so we added mango to the salsa instead.  My 4-year old thought they were great!  Corn tortillas are a must.

We love fish tacos and these turned out real good, we did some changes broiled the fish instead of grilling "it's too col to grill in the winter" and then used a sauce recommended by one of reviewers that was very good. The Salsa is very bland so next time we'll have to figure out how to give it more flavor, but all to all this has potential!!

This stuff is great.  Absolutely the best fish tacos I've had.  I've tried mixing it up with other species of fish but the tilapia seems to work the best - probably because it grills easy and breaks into nice strips.  The only thing I would suggest changing is the corn preparation.  After grilling it, perhaps it would be good to simmer the cut kernels in a pan with some habanero and honey to get that sweet and spicy taste.  Nevertheless, AWESOME recipe.

Couldn't find jicama so I substituted for 1/2 a cup of fresh diced jalepeno peppers. Used regular flour tortilla b/c that's what I prefer. Pretty good!

This was amazing!  I halfed the cheyenne and black peppers as well as the salt.  I also added some rinsed black beans to the salsa as another reviewer recommended.  Lastly, I was a ding-a-ling and used my wrought iron skillet to cook it on the stove top.  Duh...I almost "died" from the peppery smoke.  Next time I'll put the skillet on the grill to get the crispy outside of the fish.  Be sure not to overcook the fish; 3 minutes per side was perfect!  My 16 year old son who never eats fish...LOVED it!  This will definetly be a staple in our house.   ___________________ This time I doubled the fish as the salsa goes a long way.  Be careful to just sprinkle the spices on the fish.  I grilled the fish on the grill in a wrought iron skillet.  AMAZING!

This was my first attempt at making any kind of fish tacos. Along with a lot of other reviewers, I couldn't find jicama so I just left that out. The tacos were great although we didn't think the fish was spicy enough so we added jalapenos to our tacos. (I probably didn't use enough cayenne pepper?) I really liked these, my bf is used to more authentic tacos but he still  gave them a thumbs up.

This is for the salsa only.  I marinade my fish in something I had at home.   The salsa is great. And I took the suggestion of another memeber who added black beans to the salsa.  I also added one jalapeno.

Overall, I thought these were very good. I omitted the jicama because I couldn't find it and I still thought the corn salsa tasted great. I halved the cayenne pepper because of other reviews, and added a little bit of old bay. I thought it was a bit too spicy still, but my boyfriend thought it was perfect. Will be making these again!

One of the best fish tacos I have ever tasted!  Easy to make for home or company.  Don't use large tortillas the smaller flour tortillas are awesome with this recipe.  Add a dollop of spicy sour cream to make a richer flavor and brings out the fish.

Awesome!    I scaled down the recipe for 4 servings. Also, instead of grilling, I broiled on High, 3 minutes on each side. Used sea salt, and it was WAY too much. Next time I will cut it in half. Other than that, this was fantastic and we will be making it again and again and again!

This was really good!  I'd never had jicama before and was pleasantly surprised!  I added a can of rinsed and drained black beans and a diced tomato.  This made SO much salsa!!  I would halve the salsa recipe or double the fish!  Make sure you dice the veggies to about 1/4" or less.  I didn't and it was very chunky salsa.  Also don't cube the fish!  It basically disintegrated and we had salsa topped with fish flakes... :)

Great tacos! To the salsa I added a large tomato and a small can of black beans and to the fish I added cumin, as suggested by another reviewer. Find the jicama! It's an awesome, fresh addition. Wonderful tacos with just a little kick. Will make again.

The spices were a little bit too much on the fish.  The fish gets 3 stars.  The corn salsa was great and it gets 5 stars!!  This recipes gets an average of 4 stars.

These were delicious! The corn salsa was so good. I used a can of corn which I cooked on a skillet for a few minutes first.

This recipe was just great.  A double recipe was plenty to feed 10 hungry people.  We used a spicy lime marinade because we were short on spices and it still turned out great.

Wonderful, even the kids loved it. The second time I made this I added a can of rinsed red beans and a can of diced tomatoes with a little olive oil to the salsa. I did this because the red onion I used was so overpowering I had to try and kill some of the bite. As it turned out I think it made the salsa even better.

I am giving only a 4 altough I would give only a 3 t the fish because the spices hide the taste of the fish. I used fresh wild halibut and it could have been mush and we could not have tasted the stuff. We all liked the corn salsa, and I think that next time I will reverse the spiciness. I will grill the fish with just the oilve oil, salt and a bit of lemon juice, and I will add to the salsa some chopped jalapenos and cayenne pepper to make is spicy, but still flavorful.  The corn salsa gets a 5, ant that is the reason I gave it a 4.

This was okay for me. My husband loved it! I didn't have any jicama on hand so I can't account for the salsa with it but I thought it was very good. A little too juicy for my taste. I would recommend cooking the fillets on a broiler instead of a skillet or grill. On a grill, tends to fall apart, in the skillet it keeps a little too much moisture in it.

These fish tacos are phenomenal! My husband finished his second taco and asked when we were going to have them again. I had to bake the fish since we had a horrendous thunder storm this evening, and I was unable to start the grill. The corn salsa was so refreshing, and the fish had a great heat. I did use a dill sour cream sauce (leftovers from Hudson's Tilapia from this site) rather than plain sour cream. I can't wait to make, and enjoy these again!

These tacos were great! My husband & I loved them but as expected our 5 yr old thought they were too hot. I let the fish marinate in 2 tbs olive oil and 1/3 lime juice for 45 min prior to grilling. Didn't have jicama, but the salsa was still delicious. This recipe is definitely SPICY!! I think we used a quarter of the cayenne/salt/pepper mix and that was plenty. Next time I will definitely cut down on the spices. We will be sure to have these again though- very tasty!

Yummm is all I can say- the jimaca really makes the salsa. I made the salsa a few hours earlier and added a little extra lime- so good. The fish was perfect- a little spicy just the way I love it! thanks for sharing- going into our rotation for sure!

I love spicy food (and I mean it when I say spicy) - but this was a little overkill. The flavors were wonderful, but the spice overshadowed all other flavor. Cut the cayenne pepper down and then it should be excellent.

I change this quite a bit by beer battering my fish but I think it deserves 5 stars for the salsa alone.  My husband was not too keen on the idea of fish tacos but changed his mind after one bite!  We will be having this again soon.

Very good, yet not "the Best".  I didn't think it was spicy enough, I think I'll make it again and substitute the cayenne pepper for chipotle powder instead.  The corn salsa was awesome, even though jicama is hard to find this time of year and I had to leave it out, it was still fantastic.  Also I added an Anaheim pepper for color/flavor.
A definite 'make this again', with a couple of minor tweaks.

I've made this twice now.  The Corn Salsa really makes this dish, however I have yet to use jicama.

There is too much seasoning for my preference.  I cut the cayenne in half the first time and it was still too overpowering.  This time I cut the cayenne some more and only used half the salt.  Turned out just how I like it.  For the 6 fillets I used:

1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon ground black pepper
1 tablespoon salt

I added some diced Mango as a topping, which turned out to be yummy!

I usually just bake fish with various marinades or seasonings, so this was a great alternative to the usual.  Plus it's a good way to lighten up traditional tacos.

This was one of those healthy dishes that tasted a bit too healthy. I didn't like the salsa very much but the fish was good, although quite plain without the salsa.

This is a great recipe!  I'm assuming you can use all different types of fish (whatever is available).  We used mahi mahi.  Instead of measuring out the spices for the fish I just sprinkled them on (eyeballing it) and it turned out to be a great flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was HOT!!!  My husband even had a hard time with eating this one and he loves HOT food!  I could only eat 1/2 of my taco and had to get some milk to tame the fire in my mouth.  Overall, though we did enjoy it. Next time I will lessen both the cayenne pepper and salt.  He really liked the crunchy corn salsa (minus the cilantro)

We had a lot of fun with this recipe.  I only put in 2/3 of the cayenne that the recipe called for and that was more than plenty.  Was is it about grilling fish that is so much fun?

This was such a good recipe!  My husband loved everything about it.  He liked the kick the spices added to the fish (we used Tilapia)and he liked the corn salsa.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe had excellent flavor but even though I cut the spices in half, it was still too overpowering and made us not be able to enjoy the flavor of the fish as much. I used halibut. Will probably make again but use less spice.

This was excellent! I've had tilapia in restaurants, but it's always been smothered with sauce--this recipe really let the flavor of the fish come through. I took other reviewers' advice and used half the cayenne and black pepper. Plus, I didn't actually make tacos--I just served the fish with the salsa on top. I can see how this would make delicious tacos, though.

My husband LOVED these and I thought they were pretty good - but it's possible that I'm not a big fish taco fan, these being the first I've ever had. Husband said it's one of the best meals I've ever made and he's hoping I make them regularly from now on. I reduced the red pepper and added black beans to the salsa.  Made them with the Easy Spanish Rice and Banana Chimichangas (sooo yummy) also from this website for a great Cinco de Mayo meal.

The salsa makes this recipe!  I made the salsa a day ahead so the flavors could meld.  Also added some chopped tomato to the salsa for even more flavor.  I seasoned the fish to my family's taste with Cajun/Creole seasoning.  May try adding a little chili powder to the fish next time for some extra zip.
