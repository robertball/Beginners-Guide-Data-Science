This is the real deal; simply delicious. The spaghetti is folded into the egg/guanciale mixture without heat, far from the heat source. After draining the spaghetti, I usually toss it in the pan that I used to cook the guanciale. This gives it some extra flavor. Make sure you top it with extra black pepper to make it "carbonara" (carbon colored). Thank you for the recipe.

Great simple recipe. Don't forget to reserve 1 cup of the pasta water to mix in with everything. That starchy water will give it a nice creamy texture and keep it from being overly sticky.

This was great with a few additions.  I added quite a bit of extra pasta water and it was still a tad dry. Next time Iâ€™ll add pasta water, a bit of cream, and perhaps another egg.

I used bacon and I added a quarter cup of cream and a cup of peas. Turned out great.

One of our favorites.  You can hit it with a little of the hot dishwater, and/or hit it with a bit more cheese to loosen or tighten it.  sorry I meant the pasta water - we call it dishwater lol anyway the guanciale really makes it - you can do it with pancetta or prosciutto or whatever you have, but the cheek meat is the apotheosis of taste.
Peace and Love, JR&L

Delicious! I didn't have guanciale, so I used prosciutto and it was still good. Highly recommend!

This was as good as any I've eaten in Italy. I love Romano cheese so I added about 1/4 cup more than recipe called for. I tossed the pasta in the drippings from the meat before adding eggs and cheese, and no salt was added at all. Seasoning was just perfect. Delizioso!

I liked the lightness of this dish which is how I believe they make it in Italy- without all the gloppy sauce Americans use! It was still plenty rich.
I added some broccoli Rabe for some bitter green balance.
