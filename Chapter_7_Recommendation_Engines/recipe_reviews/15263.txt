These cookies were very easy to make but I wasn't very impressed with the final product.  The batter was crumbly and it was hard to get a nice shaped cookie.  I had left over peanut butter chips in the bottom of the bowl that I didn't have enough cookie batter to mix with.  The cookies tasted OK right out of the oven but after they're cooled they're little rocks.  Definitely not cookies your can freeze.

Made these for a cookie exchange at work. Most people loved them (peanut butter chips did not agree with everyone). But they were fast and easy and very tasty. An alternative would be to add coconut or nuts instead of the PB chips for a less sweet taste.

I've been making these cookies for close to twenty years when I frist saw the recipe in a newspaper article in Hints From Heloise.  One difference was to use 1/2 cup of oil instead of the 2/3 cup shortening.  I use all diifferent kinds of cake mixes and also different flavored chips but only about a cup instead of two cups.  Sometimes I use nuts or crushed peppermints or M & M candies.  The choices are endless with this recipe.  But the Devil's Food Peanut Butter Chip cookie is one of the BEST!

I just made these cookies last week. This is a simple recipe, with simple results. I used chocolate chips instead of peanut butter. They came out perfect. There is nothing bad tasting obout these cookies, just nothing spectacular. If you are looking for something with some "oomp" in it, this is not the recipe.

I did enjoy these cookies & they were super-easy to make.  My mother has a book of recipes that use cake-mixes as a base, so the concept was not new to me...

The baking time did need to be fiddled with a bit.  First tray that went into the oven was 10 minutes, bottoms a little dark, & the chips were browned on top.  Second tray...9 minutes...basically the same look.  Tried the last tray @ 7 minutes & they were perfect...middles were a little un-done, but the next day they were still soft & delicious.

I thought this recipe sounded good, but was sorely disappointed.  I made them for my usual Christmas basket giveaways to friends and relatives, and will now actually have to throw them away.  They came out of the oven absolutely perfect, and I tried one while it was still warm...heavenly, BUT, once the cookies had cooled completely, they were dry and crisp and hard.  The only way to eat them now is to zap them in the microwave for 15 or 20 seconds.  Definitely not going into my Christmas baskets.

These cookies came out perfect! I followed the recipe exactly which I usually don't do. I did notice the first batch did almost burn. So, I recommened 8-9 mins max! And.. they do taste fine after cooled. Easy, fast, and simple! Great for kids!

For a really good cake mix cookie, try the chocolate fudge cookie recipe under cake mix recipes. Very good...soft cookies, not too sweet even though I used peanut butter chips.

These are awesome cookies! I have been making them for about 6 years and they are always a hit. I have even given out the recipe because people love them so much. I have ever had any problems with the cookies being hard or burnt....

My family can't get enough of these cookies.  Everytime they see I have made them I get some good hugs.  I follow the recipe exactly and the most important step is to remove and place on a cool pan to prevent them from over-cooking.

I found them easy to make but they had no flavor and we burnt them when following the directions so if u make them u need to lower temp and cooking time.

I've made these twice and have received good reviews both times.  I have modified the recipe with good results by substituting lemon cake mix & chocolate chips and also spice cake mix & chocolate/caramel chips.  The original reciped and modified recipe cookies are good, but won't win any ribbons at the fair!  The baking temp. should be reduced to 350 and bake time to 7-8 minutes for best results.

These cookies are terrible.  Who wants a cookie that only tastes good 5 minutes out of the oven and then proceeds to become as dry and brittle as a cracker?  I baked these to give away as Christmas cookies and ended up throwing away the entire batch for fear that my friends would think I was a bad baker.  Don't bother.

This recipe doesn't specify if you should add the ingredients that the cake mix calls for as well as the ingredients in the recipe.  I wasn't sure so I only used the ingredients from this recipe.  I hope I did something wrong because these cookies were very blah!  My 2 year old wouldn't even eat them.

These cookies had a good taste but I like a much chewier cookie. These seemed dry and crumbly. 10 minutes was too long to bake--I burnt the first batch then cut down to 8 minutes.

I overcooked the first batch.  They tasted burned, but didn't look it because
of their dark color.  Luckily, it is a big recipe and after I figured out that 10
minutes was exactly right in my oven, there were still plenty of great cookies
left!

These were easy enough, but all I had was German Chocolate cake mix. They came out so bland and had very little chocolate flavor. I'm not sure if my rating is fair based on that, but I suggest using the darkest, richest cake mix you can find. The next day they are a little dry. I have made the cake mix cookies that call for oil and I think they are better.

I came on here looking for a cookie that I could make using things I already had at the house and saw this recipe, tried it, now I can't stop making them. They're so easy to just whip up real quick and everyone loves them. You can also substitute the peanut butter chips for other things you like, I found that the baking Reese's peanut butter cups taste really great in these. Overall it's a fantastic recipe that everyone should try.

This recipe was very easy to make, but still not worth the effort.  I first thought that there were too many peanut butter chips in the recipe because I ended up with a ton of unused chips in my mixing bowl that I had to just stick in the tops of the cookies.  But, after tasting the finished product, I realized that the cookies were extremely plain and dull tasting unless you had a bunch of peanut butter in each bite.  I liked the cake-like texture(but I did not taste them again after they cooled).  This was not a bad recipe, just not a good one.  Would be ideal if you like bland food.

Excellent cookies. What a wonderful idea, using a cake mix. I have been baking cookies and cakes for years but never thought of this. Anyhow, I made them using chocolate chips and I had to cook them for about 15 minutes (we like our cookies BIG). My four year old son and I loved them. Now we are waiting to see what the rest of the family thinks. Bravo. A keeper for sure!

I was a little worried that increasing this recipe wouldn't work but I have to tell you it worked perfectly!  The cookies were light and fluffy and everyone at my cookie exchange loved them.  I will definetly make these again they are easy and delicious!!  Jennifer Lofquist

These cookies were awesome.  I reduced baking time to Approx 8 minutes, they looked undercooked when removed from the oven, but once cooled were soft and chewy.  Also, at first it seemed as if there were too many peanut butter chips, but I used every single one.  I also added a dash of salt to the cookies.

All my friends were super impressed with the cookies and even mentioned I should open a cookie shop:)  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I have to admit... when I saw the consistancy of these cookies in the bowl I was a little worried by the lumpiness. But much to my surprise they came out great out of the oven! Thanks!

These cookies had a great consistency. I did add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt to give them some taste, but otherwise they were much better than I expected them to be.

This recipe was very disappointing.  The cookies didn't have much flavor. The bottom of the cookies always burned even when I varied the baking time.

WOW!!!!! Easy, Cheap, and Yummy!!!!! I would rate these cookies a 10 star if I could. I made with chocolate chips because that is what I had in the pantry. I didn't use two cups choc chips, only 3/4 - one cup. Even better to make it cheaper :) and not overly rich in taste.

These are great!  I make them a lot...for a quick and easy cookie.  I've varied the recipe using different kinds of chips...we like butterscotch a lot..and chocolate chocolate is my sister's favorite.

One word of caution...you cannot tell when these devil's are cooked due to their dark colour and I have burned a batch on more than one occasion.  10 minutes is all you need for these!

I nicknamed these cookies "Spawn of Satan" because 1) the Devils food and 2) i almost burned my house down while baking them! Is that a sign?!? anyway, I love these cookies because they are very light, and most of mine came out bite sized so they make a good snack! They are very chocolaty and good!

I make these every year, the are specifically requested by EVERYONE that is on my Christmas Cookie Gift List.  A bit hit with the kids as well.  I highly recommend this cookie.  It is simple to make, but make a double batch or you will be doing it again very soon :)

Made these for people at work.  They LOVED them.  The cookies were not hard at all.  In fact, they were 'brownie-like'.  Will make them again!!!  Note: only got 3 dozen out of the recipe.  I would double it next time.

This recipe is great!  I made these cookies for a YMCA bake-sale and the kids loved them!  Make sure you check them often towards the end of baking; my last batch got burnt on the bottom, but the kids ate them anyway!
