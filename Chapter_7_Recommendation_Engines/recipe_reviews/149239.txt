This is so easy and my kids can even make this own their own. If you use whole wheat pasta it gives it more texture, which is better, and 1/2 the processed cheese and 1/2 shredded whatever you like tastes great!!! Excellent recipe.

I am giving this a four because I don't think the serving size was correct.  I had to add a lot more processed cheese to make it not so dry.  My dad, the homemade mac and cheese lover seemed to like it, and the kids loved it.

The few weeks prior to Christmas, especially when I'm traveling,  is a time when I welcome fast, easy recipes, but I still want a good meal.  Mixing up some Velveeta with cooked noodles is a no-brainer, really, but it was a real inspiration and time-saver for me tonight.  Skipping the steps of a roux and/or a period of time in the oven simplified this macaroni and cheese, and in my opinion didn't really compromise it.  In all fairness, however, I couldn't resist adding a good blob of butter and a couple tablespoons of Vermont Cheese Powder (King Arthur Flour's).  This was so convincing compared to the "real deal" that Hubs didn't even know the difference - and had I not cooked it myself, I'm not sure I would have either. It just goes to show you that a dish being labor intensive doesn't necessarily make it that much better - if at all.

This is soooooo easy and flavorful. I have made it just as the recipe says and I have made it several times. I haven't made box macaroni & cheese since I found this recipe. My inlaws says it's delicious and my father in law isn't easily impressed! So I would say it's a keeper. Thanks for the alternative to box kraft mac & cheese. This is fresh and very creamy, more like a home cooked dish rather than the prepared foods taste of the box stuff! Thanks from a working mom!

We really enjoyed this mac & cheese.  I liked that it had the same creamy consistency of the boxed mac & cheese with the cheese packet (not the powdered cheese), but that it wasn't as salty. I didn't use exact measurements, I sorta just winged it but I used these ingredients and followed the recipe loosely, except that I added about 3 Tbsp unsalted butter to the cooked noodles, cheese and milk.  Also, I used penne rigate noodles, and that worked great, that shape is easier to pick up with a fork than elbow noodles sometimes.  Super easy and I will definitely continue to make this regularly!

Great recipe but tmake it even EASIER put cheese and milk through processor no need to heat on stove forever. Mix in a dish and put in oven for 20-30 min.also I changed it to make an awesome adult dish. Using 8oz. of cheese and 1 pound of macaroni I added a can of Rottel tomatoes & green chiles ( comes in mild, medium or hot) 1/4 cup parmesean cheese and I cut up 2 packages of imitation crab. mixed together and bake.    You can top with shredded cheddar and/or bread crumbs. super fast. and OMG soooo good.

Simple, quick, easy - and all my kids love it (hubby included!) What more can I ask for? It is yummier than boxed mac n cheese, and almost simpler too! I'm not really a fan of processed cheese, but my husband & girls love the stuff. This is basically melted processed cheese with noodles, so if you like kraft singles, you will love this :) 
I think next time I will add a little bit of butter to the noodles like other reviewers suggested. This this recipe will work with any shape noodles (we like wacky mac!)

Easy peasy.  I had a craving and very little food in the fridge.  I was able to whip this up very quickly.  And it is the perfect amount for a small dinner and then munchies tomorrow.  I added about a cup of drained salsa just to add a little extra flavour.

This is the mac n cheese I was raised on, my son was raised on, and my grandsons are being raised on. I give a nod to progress by nuking the cheese and milk in the serving bowl while the pasta cooks, and use extra milk because I prefer mine a little more creamy. Otherwise, why change over 50 years of cheesy, creamy perfection?

This was simple and yummy! I used some odd and end cheeses that I had to use up, just eyeballing everything to taste. Really good, and something I will make over and over! Thanks for sharing. :)

My kudos to Ann for giving us weights rather than volume measurements.  Since I didn't have elbows, I had to use shells (gasp), but everything else was exactly the same, and I could not be more pleased with the result.  Ahhhh, the joys of comfort food.

When I make this recipe, I use thin spagetti and add butter to it. This would probably bring it up to a 5 pointer. Just trying to help.

Love this! I took advise of others and added a couple of table spoons of butter and cheddar for a 1/4 of the amount of cheese it called for.  I don't think the serving size is accurate though...I double the recipe and it fed 4....I suspected this and that is why I doubled it but thought others might benefit from reading.  Definitely will make again, and again!  Thank you :)

Ugh! This recipe was baaaad. It tasted so "processed". You are better off finding a different recipe, or just buying the box. I should of known when it said "processed cheese food"

I used to work at a pizza place that made this exact recipe minus the pepper and penne was used instead of elbow noodles. You can melt the milk and processed cheese in the microwave. I did however try it at home with 2% processed cheese and low fat milk and have to admit the full fat version with whole milk & regular processed cheese is much yummier. This dish is addicting especially when you realize just how easy it is.

Super easy. I've been doing this for years when I need a quick mac n cheese. I usually add any bits and pieces of shredded cheese I have laying around in the fridge. I don't measure anything just kind of eyeball it. Yum.

Really good and creamy and super easy.  Best served immediately, as the creaminess quickly goes away as it cools.  Might try adding more milk next time.

Tasted like the boxed Mac n cheese with   Velveeta (not the powdered kind).  It was okay...nothing great.  Still can’t beat the real old fashioned Mac n cheese made with extra sharp cheddar.  Easy & quick, but wouldn’t make again.

I used a can of evaporated milk, one 4oz. cube of velveeta cut into pieces, 1.5 cups of shredded mexican blend cheese.  heated the milk to a simmer, added the cheeses until sauce became smooth an velvety.  added onion powder, garlic  powder, lawry's season salt, black pepper and dry mustard.  Also used cavatappi pasta, its what I had on hand.  Yummy!!!  
leftovers were solid, but put in a saucepan with a 1/4 cup of milk to re-heat  and was the same as the day I made it.  Yummy!!!

It was very creamy and had a nice, mild flavor.  Perfect for picky eaters.  I added butter and will add shredded sharp cheddar next time to add some umph.

If I had known I could have made this by scratch, I’d have never fed my kids that stuff in the box! My grandson practically ate the whole recipe!

This recipe is quick and easy. Great replacement for boxed mac 'n cheese found in grocery stores, as it takes about the same time to make.

I made this recipe with elbow mac and garlic pepper.  I would suggest adding more noodles. The 6 serving size barley made a bowl. made enough for 2 small children though.

I needed a super easy Mac and cheese for a potluck and went with this one even thought I dont love using processed cheese, I figured it would be easiest to reheat for the potluck.  Tasted great, added butter to the noodles and will omit pepper next time.  My husband says I have to make it again, so so much for my qualms with fake cheese! :-)
