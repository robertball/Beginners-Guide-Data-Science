LOVED this dish. Can't give it 5 stars because of the needed modifications but I would give it 5 stars with the following changes. I seasoned the chicken breasts with a little salt pepper and garlic powder. I added 1 clove of fresh minced garlic to the green pepper mix. I also used curry PASTE versus powder. I used 1 tbsp because I love curry but less would be good also especially if you don't like a lot of spice. Paste adds a lot of flavor. Curry paste can be found at most grocery stores in the ethnic food section or for a lot less money at an Asian market if you have one nearby.

This is a pretty good basic recipe ( although it could use some salt). However I'm thinking I'll add cashews next time and some more interesting spices/herbs - think ground coriander seed cilantro etc.

Excellent recipe! I used two rather large chicken breasts and doubled the sauce to good effect. Added garlic (thanks to previous reviewers!) and used rice vinegar instead of cider. I may also have added additional curry powder (I don't measure very accurately sometimes) because we like it spicy. I'll continue to play with this recipe but the family was happy with my first try!

I made this as is and like another user said it was missing some salt. I added some garlic salt and it was delicious. As a side I used the middle eastern rice with black beans and chickpeas recipe from this site. This is a keeper.

Made this last night for the 1st time. Doubled all but the peppers so we could have left overs. Deboned chicken leg quarters and used them as it was all I had on hand. boiled the bones with a touch of onion and garlic to use for the stock. Used more curry than called for a mix of red curry paste and powdered curry. Had it on the coconut rice from this site as others suggested. IT WAS AMAZING! Will make again!

This is a great dish! You can definitely play around with the ratio of veggies/mango to chicken to your liking. (Since mangos are in season right now I doubled the mango and used half the peppers.) I also doubled the sauce because my husband likes to put the extra sauce over his rice- but it isn't necessary to do that. Thanks for posting this one!

Shazam! I just got done with this dish and it was delish. I didn't do it in the skillet but instead in a pressure cooker (I just got one last week and love it). The chicken came out wonderfully the mango and curry played off of each other very well and the overall taste was awesome. Definitely on my list of make again! Maybe even next time for more than just me and the wifey...

This was a great recipe to start from. I followed other reviews and added garlic with the onions more curry powder salt and some dried coriander. Used and entire onion. I don't like using cornstarch so I added 1/3 can of coconut milk instead and it was amazing. Oh and I also used chicken thighs Served over rice.

i just finished making this and haven't tasted it yet (except a small piece of pepper that i snuck which was good:)). it smells amazing and the colors are so pretty together. it was super easy to make and the only small change i made was to add one clove of garlic (it was a small one so im sure it didnt make that much of a difference). i cant wait to go eat it as soon as my bro comes home!

Great recipe. I only had canned mangoes on hand and I cooked the chicken first in the mango juice then followed the rest of the recipe. It was so yummy so glad I doubled the recipe!

I used some of the other suggestions salt and peppered the chicken added garlic added baby corn carrots and waterchestnuts and I still had to make loads of modifications to even make it edible. It was not good and it took much longer than 20 minutes to prep. We served it over coconut rice and still my kids didn't like it. I will not attempt this one again. Could not even tast the curry even though I used double the amount called for. Yuck.

This was delicious spice warm and filling with just the right amount of tang. I was a bit nervous that my husband would not like it due to the amount ot curry but not only did he like it he went back for seconds! The only thing that I will do differnt next time (oh yes - there will be a next time!) is add cashews. I served it with yellow saffron rice.

EXCELLENT!!! I usually stick to the recipe exactly on the first go however this time I made a few small modifications. First I doubled the recipe I then cooked the chicken with some minced garlic I did not have a green pepper so I used two red bells. I added one fresh sliced carrot and several fresh button mushrooms (quartered). I stuck to the sauce exactly and truly this dish was wonderful. The flavor was awesome and the colors were so pleasing to the eye. It was wonderful to eat and enjoy!

Mmmm! I don't know if I've ever had a chicken dish like this before so it was very exotic and delicious. Already can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow:) It seemed a little lacking in flavour to me so I increased the curry and sugar but couldn't put my finger on what else to add. I also let it simmer for a while after putting it all together to let the flavours go together and that was a good call. I used 1 normal red pepper in place of the bell peppers called for and love it.

This would taste better had I used ripened sweet mango...I did not deduct a star off for that. I thought it was a very good dish and my husband liked it. I used green curry paste but a very small amount...maybe 1/3 of a tsp since it was so strong and spicy. I also seasoned the chicken before hand with a little salt pepper fresh chopped garlic and olive oil. I will be definitely making this one again

Not bad. My husband really enjoyed this recipe. I found it to be too sweet for my liking. I would reduce the sugar and add more curry next time. other then that is was good. It was great over coconut rice that I found on this site!! It was very pretty and colorful!

Made this recipe almost exactly as written only added garlic with veggies and sub d rice wine vinegar for the apple cider vinegar. The end result was delicious but it was a lot of food. I doubled the recipe since I was cooking for 3 and should have stuck to the original I would have had plenty of food. Also do not cook the onion until translucent only until soft or they will overcook while the peppers cook

Good flavor though I might kick up the curry powder and soy sauce for more flavor. Also I used one pound of chicken and less onion and red pepper and still found the ratio of meat to vegetable to be a bit low so adjust accordingly. But overall a delicious recipe!

Delicious. I doubled-up on the sauce and substituted gluten-free flour for the cornstarch due to food allergies. I think next time I will also double the mango. I love mangoes.:)

I liked it ok but I made a new batch & used more Soy Sauce as well as some boneless chicken thigh (dark meat). I used about 3 Tbsp panang curry paste in addition to the indian curry powder I also added a little Orange juice as well as more mango. I also mixed brown onion with red onion & scallions. Note: I am in Thailand now (Mar-June) is mango season there are 2 types of mangos here the light yellow colored sweet softer mangos and the green more sour mangos I prefer the sweet but a person may want to try a mixture of both.

We love this but find we like it with more curry and it usually needs more corn flour to thicken. Also needed salt, but those are really to our taste. . We’ve also enjoyed it with other added veggies such as carrots or zucchini. We like to top it with peanuts and shredded coconut, too.

Read most of reviews and tweaked it to making it very yummy. Cooked minced garlic in peanut oil (wok) added chicken. Setted aside then used curry paste instead of powder doubled ginger water chestnuts. All on bed of coconut rice! My 8 yr old loved it.

I made this last night and we really enjoyed it. Like other reviewers I added minced garlic and doubled the sauce. The only change I made was I used a diced Anaheim pepper instead of the green pepper as that is what I had on hand. It added some extra heat. Served it over basmati rice. Delicious!

Delicious and simple.  I brined my chicken and added salt and black pepper before I cooked it.   I added minced garlic in with the onion, andI also added a few sprinkles of red pepper flakes for a bit of heat.  It was great, but I can see adding a fresh jalapeño, or habanero too.

I followed the recipe exactly but I doubled the sauce because my family loves a lot of sauce for the rice. This was truly an amazing dish one that I will make often!

Very good - I didn't have peppers so used celery and zucchini - still good. I would likely use more curry powder next time

My husband and I enjoyed this and will make it again but agreed that it will need some modifications next time. We thought it needed a little more "kick". There's a mango dish very similar to this at a restaurant we love and it's much spicier so we're excited to have a recipe that we can build on and hopefully achieve that same taste at home. I will be adding more curry plus cayenne and/or red pepper flakes to the next go-round. Will also add a little more ginger powder. My husband thought the chicken itself lacked flavor so I'll take another reviewer's advice to salt and pepper the chicken when cooking it next time. Will also try adding garlic because we're the kind of people who think you can never have too much of it. Also I didn't have a red bell pepper and only about 1/3 of a green one so I threw that in but my husband isn't a huge fan of them so we decided it would be just as good without them. Will probably make a bit more sauce next time as well to put on the rice we have with it. Overall I'm excited to have found something different to add to our regular menu that's also very easy to make. Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

I followed the addition of other reviewers and used orange peppers since that was what I had. Very good over wide rice noodles.

At last!!! I have been looking for a mild and full of flavor asian dish similar to some of the Thai restaurants I enjoy. This has those flavors. Forgot to add mango. I used half the curry. Did add a full container of sliced mushrooms. We loved it. Served with zucchini noodles and quinoa. Will make it again with mango. Will also use this sauce and veggie recipe as a basic recipe for many different dishes.

I let the kids rate this and it gets a 4. We tried it as written this time. What I will do differently next time is: add more curry add some garlic and some more ginger the next time....I am glad the kids liked it It is a colourful dish easy to make tastey and healthy.

This is one of the best dishes I have made off this site. I didn’t have fresh ginger given the circumstances in grocery stores so I used dried which worked fine and added a garlic clove from what other reviewers had for suggestions.   This recipe will be a keeper!

I found this curry to be pretty sweet. I drastically reduced the brown sugar, however in all fairness I used canned apricots, which saved me a trip to the store for a mango. Other than being a bit sweet, it was very good. I also threw in a few mushrooms and used thighs rather than breasts.

Tasty! I had lots of mango so I doubled the mango and halved the pepper. I used curry paste as someone suggested. I'd love to try it with a hotter pepper or more curry / Indian chili powder. It was kind of a sweet and sour taste which I'd like to bring up a notch. Enjoyed it with coconut rice. Everyone loved it.

Loved it- mine tasted a little smokey because I used some home-made chicken stock that had paprika in it and I threw in some okra because it was in my freezer and I thought this dish could use some more veggies. The color combination is very pleasing and the taste is superb!

This was amazingly delicious. I doubled the recipe because I had a large whole chicken breast. I had no cider vinegar so I used rice wine vinegar (all I had). Also I had no fresh ginger so I had to use powdered instead. And added some Tumeric just because. I served it over homemade curried rice. Simply AWESOME!

It's a good start but needs way more curry powder (I added two extra table spoons) and chicken stock (I added an extra 1.5 cups). Also could use a little more heat. Mine turned out quite bland.

My husband and I really enjoyed it. I did change it a bit. I seasoned the chicken with salt pepper and garlic powder. I added more curry by 1 teaspoon. And I used different veggies (carrots and celery). It was very good. Husband said he would eat it again for sure which is a nice nod. He did add more cayenne pepper because he really likes things hot. Overall definitely a good option when you have some fresh mango lying around!

Great recipe! When I cook stir-fries I always toss the chicken pieces with 1 tbs of cornstarch and 1 tbs of soysauce and let it sit while I chop the veggies. It tenderizes the meat and the makes the chicken brown very nicely in the pan. This also adds some saltiness to the chicken. I also substituted 1.5 tsp of red curry paste for the curry powder and added 1 minced garlic clove and 1 chopped red chili pepper (seeded). It was delish! Next time I will add 1 tbs of fish sauce to the chicken stock mixture for just a tad more flavor and salt.

Will absolutely make again. Not a recipe follower per se but with only two in the house now (empty nesters) I have got to start following recipes for two. This is a winner. Easy to prepare colorful and tasty. Served with Jasmine Rice but will do as others have suggested and try making with coconut rice and add chopped cashews for texture next time around.

This is a fantastic start to a recipe. I made a couple of changes based on what I had on-hand in my spice cupboard and what was in my fridge. Here's what I did: I followed Meg's (May 4) version and doubled the sauce. Instead of adding a second cup of chicken broth I added 1 cup of coconut milk. I also used curry paste (probably more than what the recipe calls for) and I added about 1/3 cup of coconut milk to the rice so that we had coconut rice (thanks Dutch for the idea!). The result is slightly more naughty than the original but it was really tasty! My husband and son raved about it and I was very happy with the results.

Pretty blah. My husband ate one serving. I didn't want more, either. We gave the leftovers to a neighbor who will eat anything.
