I have searched for the perfect biscuit recipe for years and this is it! The biscuits turn out as huge and light and fluffy as they look in the picture. Everyone in my family loved them and commented how good they were. I will definitely make these biscuits again!

5 stars for sure! I have been experimenting with the right biscuit recipe for years. My search is over! These biscuits have the right flavor and moistness. I end up using about double the amount of seltzer water.

Heather Snell thank you for posting this recipe. This recipe was awesome! I did not change anything. I was unsure of finding the seltzer water. I've never looked for it. I bought the S.Pellegrino sparkling water because that is considered seltzer water. I very much appreciated the detailed instructions about folding turning and flattening. Months ago I had watched something similar done on The Great British Baking Master Class episode. I tried to find a YouTube video on that step but the biscuit videos I watched did not mention or show that step. I've never made homemade biscuits before and was thrilled with the results. Tonight I ate a half biscuit plain. (I would have eaten the other half but I also made Dark Chocolate Marbled Banana Bread with Greek Yogurt. ) The biscuit was good tasting and was not greasy. Tomorrow I will put strawberries on a biscuit. I do not think the recipe needs more or less sugar. Biscuits may be my next potluck item. They do not need to be refrigerated. I could also take butter and jam. How easy is that?

There are many variations on recipes for biscuits some use milk or cream or buttermilk this one yogurt. I made this one so I could use up a good amt of Greek yogurt I had left over and I hate to waste good food. It worked out great. I even followed the fold and turn method described here for kneading I think it made it very flaky and had many layers. I cut them out at about 3/4" thick not 1/2" thick to be sure they'd rise high. I made some that night to eat and the others I froze. A few nights later I baked them from frozen adding extra baking time. They were just as delish. Good for make ahead meals. I will cut back a bit on the sugar next time. If you want to make these for dessert as a strawberry shortcake add more sugar. But bc it's savory I thought a bit less sugar was better for my taste. All in all a great flaky biscuit.
