Hubs never came across a banana bar he didn't like, including this one.  This is a classic banana bar recipe, but its distinction is with the browned butter frosting which I thought was a nice complement.  Great taste, lovely frosting, but I prefer mixing up the batter using the traditional creaming method - cream the sugar and butter well, add the eggs and vanilla, and finally the bananas. Add the flour mixture alternately in thirds with the sour cream beginning and ending with the flour.  A second helping for Hubs after supper?  I'd call these a hit!

I am the submitter of this recipe.  I think the personal recipe version has better instructions.  Here's a link to it:  http://allrecipes.com/personalrecipe/63791412/banana-bread-bars-with-brown-butter-frosting/detail.aspx  BTW, his recipe is great without the frosting.

These deserve more than five stars. I cut the recipe in half and baked them in an 11x7 glass baking dish for the same time given. Otherwise, I made no changes. I like that these are actually "bars" that you can cut and eat out of hand, unlike other "banana bar" recipes here that are more like cake and require a fork and plate. The frosting is incredible...don't leave it out!! I cooked the butter for exactly 3 minutes on medium heat and it was perfectly browned. Our new official banana dessert here. Thank you:)

I used an 18 x 13 jelly roll pan and had no problems with batter spilling over the sides.  I reduced the bake time to accommodate the pan size.   My bananas were completely black which gave theses bars a very good banana flavor with just the right sweetness.  We like nuts so I doubled the amount called for in the batter and also chopped some to top the frosting.  These bars are very moist and delicious.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks, Allie.

I have made this recipe twice, with rave reviews!  Of course, anything with browned butter frosting on it is ok in my book. :-) I used black walnuts from the tree in our yard (so yummy) and parchment paper in the pan to easily lift bars out to cool, before icing.

These bars are really, really good. I followed the recipe with the exception of using a 8x11 glass dish. They took about 45 minutes to cook . They are so moist and full of flavour and I know that I will be making these again and again. Thanks AllieGeekPi for this wonderful recipe.

I helped my kids make these for their Super Bowl party.  While they were moist and delicious, I thought they were a little too sweet once the frosting was added. Next time, I would use a smaller pan, so the bars would be thicker, and then halve the frosting.  They'd be good with just a dusting of powdered sugar, too.

These bars were absolutely moist and delicious. I didn't make the frosting because they were so scrumptious on their own.  If their was a rating for 10 stars, this would definitely rate as such.

Halved recipe and baked in 7" x 11" as another reviewer suggested.  Turned out perfect, these are not too rich and I like that the frosting makes just the right amount - not too much.

SO GOOD!  This recipe is definitely an addition to my print out recipe book as I know I will make it again and again.  Hubby must have told me at least 3 times "This is sooo good!  Save this one"!  I followed the recipe with the exception of skipping the walnuts as Hubby can't have them.  I added them to the top for me.  I loved the addition of brown butter frosting.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, AllieGeekPi!

This is super yummy! But don't do what I did; use real butter in the frosting!  I used margarine and it  was meh, but butter would have rocked it hardcore (wished I had used butter) otherwise made exactly as stated. The bars were so moist and delicious, 5 star good!

I have made this recipe many many times. I’ve used 1/2amounts and made in the smaller jelly roll pan. I’ve even used cream cheese in the frosting. It never fails never dry. Always a hit at home or as a take away. It’s now regular go to when bananas get away from me and get a lil extra ripe...even overripe. Make it you won’t be disappointed!

The bread portion of this recipe turned out great but once I added the frosting it was WAY over powering and I could not taste any banana. I had to scrape all the frosting off so I could eat it. If you like an incredibly rich and heavy butter cream try the recipe but even then I’d recommend halfing the frosting and altering it to more of a glaze or do a lighter cream cheese frosting.

Moist and delicious! I halved the recipe, using a 9x9" pan, and it was perfect using only 17 minutes of bake time. I had plain Greek yogurt that needed to be used, so I replaced the sour cream with that. I combined all using the method of creaming the butter and sugar, then adding the eggs, bananas, yogurt and vanilla and then the combined dry ingredients. I have never made a frosting using browned butter before. I did halve it another time because I only wanted a small amount. It seemed very thin, so I added MORE confect sugar, but this was a BIG mistake. It hardened up, like sugared-fudge. Tasted good, but not what I wanted in consistency. Anyway, this is SO good, it would be fine even without the frosting or just a dusting of confect sugar. Great recipe AllieGeekPi, and thanks!

This recipe is so wonderful and delicious.  Super moist, so tasty and the browned butter frosting is the prefect topping.  Followed the directions exactly and the bars were prefect.  Will be making these bars a lot.

I used to make banana bread at least every other month but since finding this recipe, my husband asks for this super moist delicious banana bread bars all the time.  I make no changes other than sometimes omitting the nuts- Its a keeper!

This has got to be THE BEST banana bread I’ve ever eaten. The only thing I changed was I substituted banana yogurt for the sour cream to give it even more banana flavor. With the brown butter frosting these banana bars didn’t stand a chance. They were gone in a day! My husband even requested these again and he’s not a sweets eater.

This recipe was awesome! The moist and dense texture was just what I was hoping for. I didn't have a jelly roll pan so I used a 9x11 dish and upped the bake time to 45 min as other reviewers suggested. I also had a bunch of blue berries I needed to use so I tossed them in as well and skipped the frosting just to cut some calories. This recipe will definitely be in my baking rotation from now on! Thank you!

This is one of the best things that I have ever tasted, hands-down. I made this because I had some leftover bananas.  I went through a bunch of recipes. And found this one. It looked interesting. I didn't change a thing. 
It's so good that  I had to give a bunch of it away,  otherwise I would've eaten it all. you can't imagine how that brown butter frosting Tastes. unbelievable! I did add pecans. Heavenly!!

This is the best banana cake ever!  It's so moist with the sour cream in it.  I do make two changes, however.  I like a thicker cake so I use a 13 X 9 pan.  I also add about 3 oz of cream cheese in the frosting, which accents the brown butter quite well.  I always get rave reviews on it.

Excellent!  I put it in a 13x19" jelly roll pan and doubled the frosting to cover it all.  Don't skip out on the frosting.  It rocks.

This is really good. Followed recipe exactly except didn't add nuts since my kids wouldn't eat it. Great consistency- between like a cake and a bar. Frosting required extra milk since it was very thick, but after adding 2 tablespoons extra, was perfect. Will make again.

Great recipe! I did mine with Bob's Redmill Gluten Free flour-you can't tell. It's moist and delicious. Also instead of 1.5 cups of white sugar I did 1 cup white sugar and half a cup light brown sugar. Also I did what another reviewer did-creamed the butter and sugar and added the other wet ingredients. I slowly mixed in the dry ones and added the sour cream last. I did no frosting and they are so flavorful and have a great level of sweetness. You don't have to do the frosting.

I brought it to work and my office girls loved it.. Some asked for the recipe. And many people loved the frosting. I halved the frosting and I baked it in a cake pan.Frosting was a perfect amount for me. and next time I make it I will omit the frosting. I think it would be great without it

Allie has a winner with this recipe!  I made this for our November Girls Night Out group, and they loved them!  The personal recipe calls for this to be baked in a 13x9 pan, and the published recipe calls for a 15x10 jelly roll pan.  I used the jelly roll pan, but it was an inch or two, too short.  My cake started going over the side of the pan and a small portion went on the oven floor - ugh.  The bake time of 27 minutes was perfect in my oven.  The end results were a nice, moist, dessert that cut very nicely.  The brown butter frosting is delicious.  It is the first time I've made frosting like this.  Loved it....and I will be making this dessert again.  Thanks Allie for sharing your recipe.

Delicious! Instead of the jelly roll pan I used my 11 X 13 cake pan to make it more cake like and baked for 40 minutes. Will definitely make again.

I think this is the best tasting banana cake/bar on this site.  I am partial to cream cheese frosting, so I do use that with this cake.

The brown butter frosting amps up the banana bread bars to the next level! I used a regular, rectangular pan (not as big as the recipe said) and it worked perfectly. Follow the recipe exactly in terms of measurements and ingredients and you will end up with an amazing dessert that you will want to share with everyone!

Regarding the frosting only.  I made the dessert with a cake recipe from my aunt because of having all the ingredients on hand and my family loves that recipe.  I used the frosting recipe instead of my usual purchased cream cheese frosting.  My daughter caught her husband having some (he seldom eats desserts) and he said it was like cocaine and he couldn't leave it alone.

I followed the recipe for the bars to the letter, minus the optional nuts - only because I didn't have any on hand at the time.  For the frosting I found that it was way to dry and stiff to mix (definitely would not have spread), so I added a few extra Tbs of milk and it thinned out to the consistency of peanut butter.  After it set on the bars for an hour so it firmed up again but it was fine.  The bars were very good, but the frosting was overly sweet in my opinion.  I cut them into 1.5" x 3" bars and that's about as much as I could handle with the frosting.  If the frosting was a little less sweet I would have given 5 stars, but it just felt a little too sweet for me.

I made these today. I am so glad that others had commented about reducing the powdered sugar in the frosting. I thought 4 cups would have been way too sweet, and it would have been. I reduced the powdered sugar by half and put in 2 tsp of vanilla instead of 1 1/2 tsp. I also didn’t have walnuts so I used pecans instead. I also had to increase the bake time by 5 minutes. Delicious! I also lined the bottom of the pan with parchment paper. It was the right call. I will make this again.

I made this today with my 2- 3/4 year old granddaughter - it was fun letting her mash bananas, pour in ingredients, & frost the finished product!  We left out the walnuts, but the final result was sooòo moist & delicious. Looking forward to finding our next baking project here.

My boyfriend and I love banana bread, found this recipe and thought I would give it a try.  It is fabulous.  I only changed a couple things,  made it with 2 cups of bananas(because when I mashed the ripened bananas that's what it came out to be), made it in a 13x9 glass pan, and cooked it for 42 minutes instead of the 27 mins. that it  was originally.  This is a very easy recipe and anyone can make it.  Also they taste just as good without the frosting as they do with it.

I made this for a St. Patrick party before our Bible study. added a drop of green food coloring and 1/2c of shredded zucchini! I did not have sour cream, so used 3/4 c of Ricotta cheese.  first time making brown butter frosting.  It was a huge hit with our Pastor and the whole group! Will definitely make this again!

I have made this recipe many times and it never disappoints and so easy!  My son does not even like bananas, but loves this cake!  It’s been a family favorite since the first time I made it!

I make this, just as written and it is  fabulous! I found it, one time I was looking for something besides banana bread to make using overripe bananas. Everyone loves it and are delightfully surprised by the brown butter frosting. THIS one is a definite keeper!!!

The most amazing cake!  I'm not sure I would do the icing the same though. I love the brown butter flavor (always a fan) but maybe use cream cheese somehow instead of so much sugar. Best banana cake ever!

Tasty goodness. Well-liked by everyone. Banana bread is moist and delicious, and the brown sugar frosting accentuates the goodness. Used a 9" x 13" pan which produced roughly 3/4" tall bread {27 minutes baking time was still right for this sized pan}. 1-3/4 cups of mashed bananas equaled about 4.5 bananas. A minor change was to add an extra splash of milk to the frosting to loosen it up and make more spreadable. A great dessert for a get together since many people like it.

I made this recipe as is.  Very quick and easy.  The frosting is way too sweet for my taste (I don't have a sweet tooth), although my husband just loves it.  Also, the frosting gets really hard, almost like a candy topping.  I will make it again and next time, add a bit of cream cheese to the frosting to soften it up.  Possibly, reduce the amount of sugar as well.  But the cake itself is unbelievably good.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Will definitely made again.

This was exceptionally good!! I was looking for a recipe to utilize an abundance of bananas I had. Didn't know my family would go crazy for it. Lol. I'm gonna make it again on Friday for my bingo buddies, but I'm gonna try making it into cupcakes.

This was a big success. When I saw the recipe, it reminded me of the entenmann’s banana cake which I loved as a child so I decided to make it. It was much better than I thought. I didn’t realize how many bananas were needed for the recipe so I fell a little short. I had some coconut flakes in the house so I decided to add a little to the recipe and to make up for the missing banana. If you like coconut, I highly recommend adding some, although I’m sure it’s great without it, based on all the other reviews. I will make this again for sure.

Moist and delicious. The brown butter frosting is amazing and makes these banana bread bars irresistible !
I halved the recipe baking in a 8x11 pan for 25 minutes.

These bars came out amazing, super moist cake and the frosting was to die for. I think I waited a bit too long to frost it while I was letting  family take a taste, so the frosting didnt spread as well.  Overall great recipe

I’m only rating the frosting because I realized that I forgot the sour cream when I was at the store. Smh. 
The frosting is quite delightful.  I love the nuttiness from browning the butter. I think I’ll be using this on cake from now on.  A winner in my book.

Frosting recipe tasted great, but needed about 41/2 tbsp of milk. At 3 tbsp the frosting was very clumpy and dry. My first attempt so I followed the instructions exactly. Overall the recipe for the bars was very good.

These are devoured in no time at my house. Such a great twist on banana bread. My son prefers these over a chocolate brownie any day of the week.

Super moist and excellent banana flavor! Do NOT skip browning the butter for the icing......gives the bars so much great flavor. 
I make these often and everyone asks for the recipe after eating them.

My family loved it very rich and delicious!!! I made the cake just as the recipe called for. The Frosting I made was                                           • 1 cup butter.                                                                     • 3 cups powder sugar                                                                   •3 tablespoons eggnog.                                                           •vanilla extract

OMG these bars really are worth all the hype! I halved the recipe and baked in a metal 9"x9" pan for approx. 20 minutes. Definitely will be making again when I have over-ripe bananas.

The frosting was way too sweet for my personal taste, but the brownies are soooo amazing that I’m still giving a 5 star rating. And I feel like 5 stars isn’t enough.

These are great! I used about half the frosting because it is so rich and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter and pecans instead of walnuts. You could even add a little rum or rum extract instead of vanilla.

Very good!   I followed the recipe exactly for the bread.  For the frosting, I put 2 cups conf. sugar instead of 4 and drizzled it over the top for a thin glaze.  It gives it a nice sweetness but not too much.  I made it last night and it is better this morning.  Thank you for the recipe!  Will make again

I doubled the recipe for the bars but not the frosting, and just baked it in a 9x13 inch cake pan. I had to bake it for quite a bit longer because it was so thick, but it turned out amazing! It is so soft and chewy and the frosting has a lovely sweet and buttery flavor the compliments the "cake" perfectly. It deserves way more than five stars. Will defiantly make the again soon.

Just made this to take to a girls night dinner tonight and I couldn't be more pleased.  I have already eaten all the corners.  I made a half recipe in 9in square pan and baked for 25min.  My only change was using cream for the milk in the icing.  The browned butter icing is the perfect compliment to the banana flavor.  Perfecto.  Hope they don't notice this missing corners.

Very good bread/cake, but I might cut the frosting a bit next time.  It was very sweet and a bit thick.  Took to a potluck and it was a hit though so I guess everyone else didn't think it was too sweet.  I left the walnuts out of the cake itself but sprinkled some on top of the frosting.  A definite "will make again" recipe.  Oh, I also made it in a 9 x 13 cake pan so it took about 45 mins total to bake.

Would probably cut down on the sugar next time - it made our teeth twinge a little - but otherwise the best banana bars we've ever tasted! Definitely a keeper, especially with the easy and delicious frosting.

This was delicious. The only thing is after a day or two of sitting at room temp it became tough. For the frosting I just used a jar of betty crocker vanilla frosting which I added to it 3 tsp of banana extract. Sprinkles some crushed walnut on top of it and it was very very yummy.

These are moist and delicious. I did have trouble making the frosting, wish instructions were a little more detailed, but it was more than likely an error on my part. I have not had a lot of success in this area of baking. It was a real fine line between being a frosting and a pliable candy coating of some sort, at least for me. Mine turned out like the latter, lol. Still, the taste was delicious. Will make again and try the frosting one more time. Thanks, Allie
