Hi,  I am the submitter of this recipe and I noticed that this was not posted exactly as I had submitted it, this could effect the flavor.  When you put the chicken back in the cooker pour the duck sauce over it and follow directions. After the chicken is cooked, remove it and boil the sauce until it is thick and syrupy.

This was absolutely DELICIOUS!  The only reason I didn't give it FIVE stars was because I was swearing I'd never make it again when I was in the browning-the-chicken step.  That oil pops like crazy, and the pressure cooker is deep, so you have to get your hand down in there to turn it, which leads to burns.  I discovered using a flat spatula (pancake flipper type) was easier since it has a longer handle, and you can quickly loosen the chicken pieces from the bottom of the pan.  I might consider doing the browning in a skillet first, then transferring everything to the pressure cooker.

Besides that technicality, it was AMAZING.  My kids and husband ate it all and practically licked the plate.  

Thanks for a great recipe!

I was skeptical but desparate for a pressure cooker chicken recipe. It was great. I used dried ginger the first time because it was all that I had on hand. I added extra honey. As suggested, added the preserves, etc while the chicken was cooking. However, next time, I will double the sauce mix. Serve with rice. It is great!

An absolute phenom!  I use my pressure cooker only 3 or four times a year, but now I'll use it more.  This recipe is no doubt one of my top ten best meals ever.  Excellent!

This is awesome. My family raved over this. The chicken was soooo tender and moist and the sauce just took it to another level. Extremely easy. Will definitely be making this often.

Very good and Very easy... Make sure to atleast double the sauce, perhaps even triple it and be sure to cook the chicken in the sauce. Then thicken it after the chicken is done.

This is delicious! so easy, too. We all loved it. I followed the directions that DEBMCE4 added, adding the duck sauce before pressure cooking. I think it is really important to crisp up the chicken in the first step.

It was amazing!!!  The sauce was on the sweet side, so I added a little soy sauce and cayenne pepper to salt and spice it up. I also only used skinless/boneless chicken breast. Everyone fought for the leftovers the next day.

This review is for those using a pressure cooker for the first time.  This was the first pressure cooker recipe that I used at it turned out great!  The only catch is that you have to brown the meat first, but this is the case w/ many pressure cooker dishes.  Consider wearing an oven mitten to protect your arm from the popping grease.  Because I used chx breast and wings, I could have browned them quicker in a separate skillet.  But, if you're just using the pieces from a whole chx according to the recipe, just use the pressure cooker.  Hope this helps!

Cooked as written except doubled the sauce recipe and poured the sauce over the browned chicken before cooking in the pressure cooker. The flavors were wonderful and the chicken was tender and juicy. My husband and I both agreed that the skin and bone on the chicked did not add anything to the dish and browned boneless, skinless chicken breasts would be just as good. I will try that next time. A great go to pressure cooker dish...I fixed it on a day when it was 102 degrees outside. The kitchen stayed cool and we  had a wonderful meal in a matter of minutes. Served over brown rice. Oh, I had to add some cornstarch to the juices as it still wasn't thickening after 10 minutes of simmering in the cooker on the brown mode.

Very bland.  Too soupy.  I had to boil off 1 - 1.5 cups of the water after releasing pressure.  It is missing something, but I don't know what it is.

This couldn't be easier or more delicious. I have a little 8 year old who doesn't bother to eat unless something really, really appeals to her. Getting enough nutritious food into her is an on-going challenge.Tonight she had finished her serving of chicken before I could sit down to start to eat! She has already had seconds and asked if there is more because she might want some before bed! It's a real hit with all four of us and I know I'll make it again and again. I did use the submitter's suggestions from her review and put all the sauce ingredients in before bringing it to pressure. Thanks, DEBMCE4, you have given us an easy, economical new family favorite!

Easy, excellent recipe. I browned the chicken in a pan instead of in the pressure cooker, and I also made the duck sauce in a  separate pan.
DH loved it- will make again. thank you for a great recipe!

Can't speak for the chicken but I made the duck sauce, exactly as directed, and it came out excellent. Used it as a dipping sauce for no-fry crab rangoons found on this site. Awesome!

This was the first recipe I tried in my new electric pressure cooker, and I learned a few things. Instead of browning the chicken in the cooker, next time I'll do that in a non-stick pan. While the chicken was cooking, I made the sauce in a sauce pan. Yes, I added two pans to the clean-up, but it's easier than using the cooker for these tasks, especially for browning.

The sauce was great; I doubled but should have tripled it. I think the chicken itself was bland, so maybe next time I'll double the seasoning, too.

In my electric cooker, which doesn't reach 15 psi, I chose 13 minutes and that worked out fine.

I was disappointed in this recipe, UNTIL I read the addendum by the person who posted it. This would fix everything that was wrong with the chicken as I made it. It was too bland and boiled.... and again this would've made all the difference. The next time I'll read the reviews before I make something!. It was my first pressure cooker recipe, and I'm eager to try again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I am using an electric pressure cooker and found that the chicken was slightly underdone after eight minutes.  I put the chicken back in and used the saute setting for a few minutes and that got it up to the right temperature.

I've been toying with my new pressure cooker since Christmas, and this is the first thing that I've made that's been a hit.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Not too hard and tasty sauce. Used a bone in chicken leg (on sale this week) and cooked it for 2 extra mins. Followed authors follow up and cooked sauce under pressure. Used apricot jam (100%fruit) and ginger powder. Would make this again.

Dish was excellent.  Might recommend dropping cook time on chicken down 1 minute, but Duck Sauce was incredible.  Thanks for the great dish!

This was a big hit!  Everyone loved the sauce and I could not believe how easy it was to make this.

This is so easy and delicious!  I used agave sweetener instead of the honey and powdered ginger and it worked great.

I was out of  apricot jam or preserves so I substituted Major Grey's Mango Chutney.  I forgot to put the chutney on when I pressure cooked this.  I thinned it just a bit then added it as a sauce right before serving.  It was wonderful.

I seasoned one breast for my father who is on a strict low sodium diet (under 1500 mgs. per day)  and he loved it too.

this is so easy and absolutely delicious, so much so that it's hard to believe it takes me less than 15 minutes to make it including defrosting the duck in the microwave, which is faster than my rice cooker cooks rice. It takes longer to let the sauce thicken than to cook the whole thing. Patience is not my middle name.
Tweaked it to what i had in the kitchen and apart from using duck instead of chicken i used cider vinegar, apple juice, marmalade, honey, tarragon, cloves, star anise, peppercorns instead. Also added dried apricots.  Not quite the same, but still very delicious.

The chicken was tender but not as good as I had hoped it would be. Husband wasn't crazy about it either.
