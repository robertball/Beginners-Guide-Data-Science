I have been doing this for years as a motorhome tour leader.  Two suggestions; first, use only heavy-duty quart-size freezer bags. Cheaper bags will open up and ruin the omelet. Second, use a straw to suck all the air out of the bag after mixing the ingredients or just lay the bag against a sharp corner of a table with the egg mixture below the edge and the top of the bag flat on the table top. Press out the air and seal. Use whatever ingredients you like but crumbled bacon or sausage is my favorite. If you do a three-egg omelet, increase the cooking time to 15 minutes.

This was great for camping. My kids and I were in charge of breakfast for about 20 people. We had chopped everything at home. Then one of the kids wrote the names of everyone on the bags. This turned out cute because he was only seven we wouldn't tell him how to spell anyon's name so he had to guess how to spell names and it was funny to see what he came up with. Everyone threw in what they wanted. The kids shook the bags for everyone. Then we (adult supervision is a must with the hot boiling water) cooked them in a huge pot of water. The bigger the pot, the better. Using a big pot helps to keep the bags from hitting the sides of the pot and melting. We gently stirred them around too, which helped. We served them with a bunch of quick breads we cooked ahead at home and fresh fruit. They were a huge hit and the kids really felt like they were contributing to the group effort. The best guage for time was to pull the bag out and give it a little squeeze to see if it was firm enough.

Quick tip for those concerned about melting the bags- drop a plastic colander in your pot for easy, no splash drop ins and removal.

I was browsing recipes, looking for something for dinner that used what I had on hand and didn't take much effort...I found this recipe, and suddenly making dinner went from boring to fun!  There's something "mad scientist" about this recipe and the fact that it makes a decent omelette with little fuss or cleanup is a bonus.  I used quart Zip-loc freezer bags and shoved them into large tumblers to hold them upright while I broke the eggs into them.

I just finished doing 2 of these omelets.  Both of the bags broke in the boiling water.  I used good quality zip lock bags and ended up with a watery mess!!

Ecelent!!!and if i could go higher on the stars i would! First I mashed two eggs like it said but when it said like ham and stuff i just added balony and extra cheese. then insted of just letting it sit in the pot and letting it melt to the sides i put a shiskabob skewer through the top and it just hung into the water. IT WAS THE BEST OMELET I'VE EVER TASTED!!!!!! (i did this all by myself its so easy!) Everyone should try this!!!

I loved this recipe!  We made it at a family gathering and it was a hit.  One tip, write names on the zip lock bags with permanent markers before cooking because after cooking they all look the same.

I have been worried about the leaching of carcinogens from plastic into the food supply, but according to the ziploc website  Ziploc bags are NOT made with BPA (bisphenol A) and they are dioxin free. They don't suggest the bags should be used, but I see no harm in doing this once or twice. It is a real crowd pleaser!

I have had this around for years and it gets a 5 for me on fun, ease, AND clean-up.  Great for camping trips (take all fillings in separate bags) and when kiddos sleep over.  I do use only heavy duty qt size freezer bags.  When making with kids I let them add all their own stuff and do the squishing.  I just add fillings to the cracked eggs in the bag and squish everything together at once! (I also label each persons with a sharpie)

This worked perfect for a crowed of 52 campers.
  Others may have listed these tips also but here are mine:
 1- besure to use freezer bags
 2- quart size are fine if only using 2 eggs but it really is better with the gallon size
 3- the bags with the little slide closers are a little risky, we prefer the plain, press and seal kind
 4- put very little cheese or salsa in the bag, they may change the consistancy, save those items to top it off after it's cooked
 5- you already know but, you can use the omelet ingredients that you prefer
 6- dump out of bag right onto a flour tortilla.
  Everything seems to taste better when you're camping, but these were really great.

This turned out great.  We're definitely making it for teh big family reunion next month.  I would suggest using less cheese because it seems to come out a little more crumbly when you put in a lot of cheese.  Don't worry, it'll come out hot enough to sprinkle cheese on it so the cheese melts. :)

Am giving huge words of caution here regarding using plastic for cooking in boiling water just in case no one else has said something about it here: You must use plastic food bags that clearly state they are approved for boiling not only because of melting points but also because of BPA and other chemicals leaching into the food! There have been several studies regarding this and the FDA requires manufacturers to follow safety standards in order to represent the bags are 'boilable'! Use the same precautions when using plastic for microwaving and baking! With that being said, I love this easy recipe ;-)

Absoutely the best!! I even premixed the eggs and some ingredients at home; vacumn-sealed them in the heavy duty bags vacumn-seal bags(leaving room for expansion); FROZE them; then took them camping. Boiled them up and it was a HIT!!!

Hey!  It works!  Very tasty!  It's not your normal traditional omelet, but how could anyone not like it with all those optional ingredients?  I served with home-fried tortillas, torn in eighths.

I used this recipe many times until I read that the bags are not meant for boiling. Very good recipe, but for anyone who cares about their health I would not use these bags. Wait until Ziploc comes out with boil bags.

There was a question about checking with the manufacturer about the safety of cooking with bags. The Ziploc's web site gives similar recipes using their Ziploc® brand Zip 'n Steam® Microwave Cooking Bags. Whatever you use, use microwave safe bags.

I could not believe how these turned out! We did this with all the members of our family on Christmas morning. We're turning into quite a large family these days, and everyone got to pick what "toppings" they wanted in their omelet. Suited everyone's different tastes and was a lot of fun!

We did add a touch of milk to each bag (maybe 2-3 TBSP) to make the eggs slightly fluffier.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!  I made this for the county fair and got and Honorable Mention!!  This is the easiest recipe ever!  I always put the bag in a mug or cup and fold the top over the sides of the mug or cup and that makes it easier to crack the eggs!  I made this for dinner one night for my family and my moms friend!  They all loved it! The only thing was, we didn't have any shredded cheese only the proccessed cheese squares so I cut them up into little pieces and everyone still like them!  I put 1 piece in each omelet.

A caveat: please search online for safe BOILABLE bags. This is a FANTASTIC dish for camping.  We love to eat actual food on our camp trips but hate cleaning up afterwards.  With this recipe we just chopped the veggies straight into the bag and ate from the bag as well.  Perfect!

Had students in a "survival cooking" class do this as a make-ahead breakfast lab.  Provided different types of filling ingredients and let each student "customize" his/her individual omelet.  Be sure to use a quart-size freezer bag--those without the zipper pulls work best.  Kids enjoyed them!

This is the BEST recipe.  Great if you have kids or husband who doesn't eat certain foods -- you can customize every omelet.  And no frying -- so 0 fat!  A couple of hints: (1) cheese is a must, and (2) don't use more than 2 eggs per bag; the eggs won't cook through and will be runny.

Scrambled 2 large eggs, chopped ham, sliced green onion, shredded cheese, chopped red pepper, diced jalapeno pepper, skim milk and broccoli.  You can put anything into these bags to make the perfect omelet and clean up is a snap.

I've seen this recipe many times before and have tried it and one important thing seems to have been forgotten - use freezer ziplocs as they are stronger and will not break with boiling. Also, every time I have made this I have found the omelettes to be ready in less than the 13 minutes specified, so keep an eye on them and when they seem solid, they are done as overcooked eggs are nasty rubbery things to be avoided.

Can't believe how good these came out!  My husband was sceptical, but thought these were great. Thanks so much for an easy, timesaving, wonderful recipe!
Forgot to also say that this cooks perfectly when you use a quart size Ziplock freezer bag (you can also put names on the bags, but be sure to face them in different directions because the print transfers to the bag next to it.)

Omelets came out perfectly cooked after 13 minutes. Used quart size freezer bags and did not experience any problems with melting or bags breaking. The omelets rolled right out of the bag. Will definitely make again!

My bag melted, the eggs were rubbery and tasted like plastic. Disaster of a recipe all around. I'll stick to real omelets, thanks.

Neat and easy. Its a lot easier to beat the eggs in a bowl first and then pour them in the bag. That's the only way I've ever done it.

This is a great way to cook an omelette.  My family has such a good time mixing their own concoction. People are so impressed when I share this recipe.  So versatile and flexible I can't wait to have a brunch and serve it to guests.

It's great. I'm 17 year old student, taking Foods and Wellness in HS. We made in this class and they came out good and also tasted good. It's easy recipe and good for a quick breakfast.

We have made these too many times to count and love them!!!!  A bunch of us girls got together at the lake and everybody brought a different ingredient.  We put names on the baggies with permanent marker (BTW do not try the quart bags)and had everybody make their own omelet.  We fed 18 people for breakfast, with not much prep or clean up and that's pretty good when you're camping! ps-we found that jumbo eggs work the best, if I use large eggs I reduce the cooking time by 1-2 minutes.

These were so much fun to make!  I made omelets for everyone in my family and they were ready all at the same time!  Brilliant idea!  My picky husband prefers the flavor of a traditional pan fried omelet, but he thought these were good.  These would be so good wrapped in a tortilla because they are already perfectly shaped for a breakfast burrito!

Wow, what an easy omelet! I used a cheapo zipper bag without problems. I added the eggs, marble cheddar cheese, dill and garlic cheese, and dried onions. I let it boil for around 10 minutes on medium high heat. I will be making these when we go camping in July! I know everyone will love having their own customized omelets!

These were awesome.  We made them on a camping trip, even though the family was skeptical.  Everyone filled their own pouches, using a sharpie we marked our names on the bags, and voile! breakfast.  Thanks for the post.  We will definitely be using this one again!

VERY clever idea!  I particularly liked that there was no mess and I didn't have to add any fat to cook the eggs.  As for getting the eggs into the bag, I simply opened the bag in a glass measuring cup.  That held it open while I put in the ingredients.

We have been making these for years and often for early tailgating. Put out a table of ingredients, have people write their order, write their name on a qt. freezer bag, add ingredients, cook, and serve.

If you try this at high altitude the "exactly 13 minutes" isn't long enough, the eggs will be runny on the inside.  I'm guessing 17 minutes in Denver is more like it.

Use freezer strength bags, veggies work best but precooked ham, bacon works well too.  My family loves these with cheese, onion and bell pepper.  No added fat makes these nutritious omelets and very tasty, plus 11 year old can cook these in a hot pot, with easy clean up.

The first time I ever heard of this I couldn't believe it until I tried it.  And it works!  They're quite good.  Been making these for quite a while and they're great for when you're on the go. You can add anything you like in your regular omelets! Be sure to get all the air out of the bag before boiling.

This worked out perfectly. I was pleasantly surprised how well this turne out. Don't expect it to be exactly an omelet in the traditional sense but it still works nicely. I put onions & mushrooms in it and topped it with cheese after it was done.

I made this for mu husband and I boiled it for only 11 minutes as another user suggested. Well, it was delicious but I should have cooked it longer because it was a little runny inside. That's probably my fault since I used a quart size bag as I didnt have any freezer bags on hand. All in all it had a great flavor, I sprinkled salt and pepper, I cooked some sausage and then added onions and peppers to the pan at the last minute. I took the sausage and crumbled it and poured it and the onions and peppers in the bag with the egg mixture with some cheese. Very good flavor.

This was just pure genius. I'll be sure to make this for my boyfriend. I tried this with just salt and pepper, then when the eggs were done, wrapped them in a slice of smoked turkey breast from the deli and then wrapped a tortilla around it. Wonderful!

This was easy and delicious.  Used quart sized freezer zip lock bags.  Added shrimp, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, and cheddar cheese.  You can easily prepare the rest of breakfast without worrying about watching the eggs.  Will make again.

We do something similar on our camping trips. The kids love it as they get to 'make' their own eggs! Use whatever ingredients you like, just don't put too much in the baggies.

For the reviewer who said that Ziploc does not recommend cooking in their bags---there's a recipe from their website. I think it's fine to cook in the ziploc bags after all.

I had tried this a couple years ago and the omelet turned out blue; apparently the brand name freezer bag I used had a blue tinge to it, which I hadn't noticed.  Tried it again this morning in prep for family Easter breakfast.  I used two jumbo eggs.  After 13 minutes, the eggs were still runny so I resealed and put it back in the boiling water for three more minutes.  Rolled it onto a plate and sprinkled a little cheddar cheese on top.  My son ate it and said it tasted like a "regular" omelet, but he and dh were laughing that it took much longer to cook than the standard method if you're only making one.  This will make a nice 'omelet bar' for our large family gathering. Thanks!

I only added finely chopped onions and shredded sharp cheddar cheese and it was great!  My 14 month old really liked it :-)

I just made this for my husband and he loved it. No pans, no mess, no fat, so I loved it too! Only had cheap bags, so I double bagged and it worked fine. What a great no fuss breakfast. Thanks.

Great recipe!  I just made these with my nephew (10 yrs old) for a big family group.  It was fun to do and everyone had their food ready at the same time.  We let everyone choose their own ingredients.  A good choice was pre-cooked breakfast sausage links that we chopped up.  I would definitely recommend using the FREEZER bags....We used the Hefty brand, but I wouldn't think the brand would matter.  The freezer variety is heavier....I saw some concern about the bags breaking....We had no issues.  We served them with tortillas and taco sauce/salsa.  Everyone loved them!

All I have to say is, " Oh My Gosh!!" These are awesome.  I used gallon plastic bags from ALDI's and had no problems with them melting open.  Also took my peppers and onions and cooked them in the quart size bags in the pot of boiling water for the omelets as I was getting everything together.  Great recipe!!   Already called my mom and gave her the recipe to try. Can't wait to try it camping this summer!!!  Thanx definitly a KEEPER!!

Absolutely amazing. Sure the omelet is a slightly firm but that in no way detracts from the flavour, or the presentation.
I had a breakfast meeting for 13 at my house - I assembled all the ingredients: beaten egg (2 eggs per), chopped pepper, sauted mushrooms, sauted onions, grated cheese, bags with names already with on them, and a big pot of boiling water.  I gave everyone instructions as they came in.  Everybody was suitable amazed with the results.  Delicious and fun.  
I also served cinnamon rolls, and hash browns.

I LOVED THESE EGGS!  At first I was unsure of it, but I made them anyway.  I didn't add cheese, but added pepper, pickle seasoning, and hot salt.  Came out to the perfect dryness, and tasted like the perfect scrambled eggs!  Next time, I'll make toast.  Beware though, the bag started to melt up top, so I had to cut it open!

Neat idea, but I just didn't like the texture or the taste of this omelette. I might try it again with only ham, cheese, and mushrooms. Just wasn't as good as I hoped it would be.

We do this all the time while camping. Be sure that the bags do not touch the side of the pot, and use freezer bags. We normally wrap them into a tortilla after they have cooked and are ready for eating.

OK...even despite one major flaw in this recipe, I am giving it 5 stars. My family loved it!!! So yummy!!! The problem came in boiling them or maybe the bags we used. We used Glad sandwich bags, which seemed great for individuality, however, I think the pot we used may have been too small, because the bags broke :o( I will follow the recipe exactly next time and be sure to use a  really big pot and the freezer bags suggested! Excellent!!!!

These are GREAT! my sister gave me the recipe after attending a bridal shower they were served at. I made them for a large family breakfast and everyone got their own bag with the eggs in it and added what they wished. I wrote each persons name on the bag with perm. marker. While they are cooking I could get all the other breakfast stuff together and evryone could set down to a hot fresh omlet at once. How else can you make 8 omlets at one time. These are very fluffy and taste and look great!!!

This is the second time we tried this recipe and it was great both times.  The omelets came out light and fluffy.  We each got to choose what we wanted in our omelettes. And in opposition to a previous poster, ours were beautiful to look at!  We used a quart size freezer bag.  The eggs rolled right out. The kids (6 & 8) love to make their own omelets.  It is a great "learning" to cook recipe.

This is a simple way to make omelets.  I used 2 eggs, a spicy cheese, mushrooms, green onions, turkey bacon and a little salsa.  They were spicy and wonderful, I will make them again

I would never do this unless I wanted to give my family cancer!! When you heat plastic bags like that, you release the toxic plasticizers into the food. 
Not so smart! A little convenience is not worth your health.

This is the craziest and most fun way to make eggs! Ziploc does state "bags are not designed to withstand boiling temperatures" however, it did work perfectly fine.  I used a gallon size Ziploc for 6 eggs and various additions (ham, cheese, seasonings) including adding 1/4 cup of cottage cheese for a more quiche like texture.  I added the bag just as the water started to lightly boil then let it boil on medium-high heat for about 25 minutes.  I used tongs to remove the bag and feel the eggs for doneness.  I did also use one of the heavy paper clips to clip the bag top together so it wouldn't rub against the sides.  My cookware is very good and non-stick so no clue if worse cookware makes a difference.  If so, try the other reviewers suggestion of heavy duty quart size bags.  Definitely try this!

We call these campfire omelets. We use genuine Zip-Lok 1 quart freezer bags with the double zipper and have had no leaks. Anyway, the only essential ingredients are the eggs. Throw in whatever is in the fridge. Leftover pizza toppings are a favorite source of ingredients. Everybody gets to pick what goes into their omelet.

Since the omelet is one solid chunk, it can easily be wrapped in a tortilla with other fillings to make a great breakfast burrito. If you've made a fat omelet, you can slice it lengthwise for two breakfast burritos.

This recipe was just okay. Nothing exciting like I expected after reading the first 3 reviews. I made them this morning for breakfast for me and my boyfriend and the eggs had the consistency of microwave eggs once I took them out of the bag. Removing them from the bag was a challenge as half of the eggs omelette thing stuck to the ziplock bag. The flavor was fine but I just couldn't get over the rubbery texture of the egg. I'll pass.

It works!  Didn't make the "omelet" with the ingredients as directed, just chopped some cauliflower and broccoli and threw it in with the eggs.  Ingredients sound good.. think the whole idea of cooking in the bag is 5 stars..no butter and no mess..think this is the way to go!  I do love eggs in butter though!

I share the plastic contaminate concerns of other readers.  I already had Pyrex ramekins I've not used in years, so tried using these,  lightly oiled, directly from freezer and setting them in shallow boiling water etc.  Works out just as well but you will have the additional clean up of the ramekins.  I have not tried a double boiler with the Pyrex ramekins, but this would be easier than fussing with sitting the dishes into shallow boiling water.  Remember to always use  FREEZER TO OVEN SAFE dishes.

We have made these for years.  They are great for camping trips as everyone can customize from ingredients we usually have with us anyway.  Boil a big pot of water over the campfire and write names on each ziplock to avoid confussion.  Easy clean up and kids love them!

taste-great! technique-needed improvement. we used a large pot over the campfire.  the problem was that if the gallon sized ziploc bag touched the bottom or side of the pot it would melt. there was a lot of excess bag, we decided this would be best with SANDWICH size bags in the future, may prevent bag-burn-through!

I've been using this for a while for making breakfasts for my family.  One trick I've learned about the bags, I do use the Ziploc snack sized ones, I just do one boil for about 8 minutes, take the bag out of the water, let it rest for about 10-15 minutes, and then boil again for another 6 minutes.  This is for 2 egg omeletes.  I usually make ham/cheese for my wife, and sausage/cheese/spinach for my self.  I also usually use fill a 1/3 cup twice for each bag.  each 1/3 is about 1 egg's worth.

I used the Ziploc Quart Freezer Bags and had no problems. This was super easy & great tasting! Definitely a keeper and the added plus is there is hardly any clean up! Thanks for a GREAT recipe!!!

This sounded a little odd to me when I first saw it, but I'm so glad that I gave it a shot!!! This is the easiest recipe, and the results are wonderful. I used a coffee mug to hold open the bag as some others had suggested, used three egg whites instead of the two whole eggs, and then just threw in what I had in the fridge which included: some baby tomatoes, one clove crushed garlic, red pepper, some broccoli, a sprinkle of dried oregano, and a little parmesan cheese. When it was cooked, I spread some Salsa on a whole wheat wrap, and rolled the omelet up in it. Yum ;o)

I just made these a few minutes ago and omg they were so easy and tasty!! I didn't have all the "optional" ingredients so i made mine with green onions, cheese and bacon (salt&pepp too). I have always been a failure at making eggs lol but this method is fool proof. I used cheapo dollar store brand baggies and i had no problems with it busting. Also, my eggs usually get cold by the time the biscuits are done but you can just turn the heat off and leave them in the warm water and they stay warm as long as u need. definitely a keeper!

Thanks for posting. We like making these when camping and I forgot the cooking time. As for the concern with the plastic bags........ this is not something I would feed my family weekly but if you are having it on occasion I don't think the plastic is going to hurt you when heated.

Had to try it. The idea seemed a little creepy to me - and I disagree with reviewers that think these are pretty - but they ARE good AND easy. I used a gallon bag and my omelet broke in the center from the bag bending as it boiled, but otherwise worked like a charm. My boys had me make their omelets the usual way - but I bet younger kids would be totally impressed. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this idea was so stupid, that it couldn't work.  Boy, was I wrong! I had egg on my face!  It is much easier than the traditional omelet and it is lower in calories because you don't need butter to fry in the pan. This is one of best ideas and recipes, I've come across.

WHAT A HIT! ITS EASY,PLEASES MY PICKEY EATER AND MY DARING! ONE HAD PEPPARONI,TOMATOES AND HAM. ANOTHER HAD HAM AND CHEESE, AND ONE EVEN HAD TURKEY ONIONS,MUSHROOMS AND CHEESE.HUBBY HAD A LIL BIT OF IT ALL! WAY GOOD AND SUPER EASY!

This was crazy, but easy and wonderful. I beat the eggs in bowl and then diveded them into the frezer bags. My family had so much fun putting in their own ingredients. My kids now ask for "bag eggs" all the time. Great Recipe!

This recipe was ok.  The idea of it was pretty cool with each person able to make their own.  However, my family did not really care for the texture and there was something lacking in the taste.  I would not make this recipe again because our family prefers the more traditional taste of omelets.

I was a bit skeptical about cooking eggs in a bag...but these turned out better than regular omelettes! They were very fluffy and light. I didn't have a freezer bag, so I triple bagged it with sandwhich bags. Be sure the move the bag around so it doesn't touch the pot for a long time, otherwise, it could melt.

This is the easiest omelet I have ever made. Preparation is a snap.  Just put it all in a ziplock bag, shake it up real good and put it in the fridge until you're ready to cook it.  Boil the water, drop the bag in and a few minutes later, you have a great omelet cooked just right.  It slides out of the bag perfectly.  The kids really enjoyed shaking their own omelet bag too.

I boiled mine for at least 13 minutes and it was a watery mess. it's difficult to tell when completely cooked and once you open the bag and try scoop out it's kinda too late.

A few tips: You must remove all the air from your heavy duty quart sized freezer bag or it will burst. Do not let the bags touch the sides of the pot or you will have a soupy mess. If you use extra large eggs cook 2 minutes longer, add an additional 4 minutes for 3 extra large eggs. I hope these tips help. 
I make a batch up with different things in them then place them in the fridge for the work week. My favorite is spinach mushroom garlic and cream cheese.

Have made these for years. You must use the freezer ziploc bags though. I made 16 of these the night before a brunch (I took orders from each of the guests and wrote their name on the bag).  Served with a variety of toppings, a large fruit plate and toasted bagels. It was such a big hit.

I made this for the first time tonight.  It's quick and easy to do.  And it's delicious too!  I will suggest to use the small quart sized freezer bags.  They fit in the pot better.

I was not fond of the texture, it was different than pan frying. My daughter loved it. Overall it was a fun recipe to try. I will help my daughter make this again.

I've been using this method at tailgate parties for years. I've never had a bag bust or melt. We have large groups so we prep all the meats and veggies in advance and let everyone pick their favorites. We usually have a small griddle going with hash-browns. No complaints yet!

This recipe sounded so crazy, I had to try it. Sautéed a few sliced portabellas in shallots, chopped up some broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, red onion (for color), used extra sharp cheddar and some cream cheese, boiled the bags for the recommended 13 minutes - PERFECT!!!

We have done this for many years. Never had a bag break.  Always used the heavy freezer type zip bag.  Maybe those whose bags broke, put too much in them.  One group we belong to does 30-40 bags 10 at a time in large pots.  This along with some hashbrowns and muffins or pancakes make a great fun group breakfast.

This is my favorite fat free breakfast! I have done for many years but as I have no stove I have used freezer strength [small for just one - me] placed upright with open about 1/2 inch in take-away container base with about 1/2 inch water and 2 mins in microwave. By the time I get it onto my plate the heat has 'sft cooked' eggs and melted the cheese.

ten years ago at my job a guy I worked with said his wife found this recipe and told me about it, he thought it was funny,i went home and tried it, made it for dinner, I loved it, nice and fluffy, I did learn something from this recipe, I always mixed everything in a bowl then poured into bag, one less dish to wash, if you can't boil water you can make this, so easy.

I can't believe I've never heard of this before. I used chunks of bacon instead. I used 4 Ziploc baggies and a plastic strainer, like someone else suggested, and cooked it a couple of minutes longer.  Once the water was boiling, I dropped the baggies and then turned the temp down to halfway and put a lid on top.  The strainer worked awesome and none of the bags broke.  I think that this was the best omelet I have ever had!

Been doin these for large family gatherings for years.  You can not beat the ease, everybody gets exactly what they like since they make their own, and clean up is a breeze (cutting board, knife and large pot).  Note, the larger the crowd the larger the pot needs to be, you do not want to put too many bags in and kill the boil.
Enjot and I know you will....

I personally have used this for many years. Recently, I started serving a breakfast at the Anerican Legion Post where I belong. The people put their names and table number on the bag. They put in whatever ingredants they want and the bag is delivered to me. I put in the eggs and write the time the bag comes out of the water on the bag. I served over 50 people last month and expect many more this month. An easy money maker for your club.

This was actually really fun to make! I never imagined using a ziplock bag to make an omelet! The salsa was a wonderful addition and I used turkey bacon due to availability. I topped with shredded pepper jack cheese also. Great recipe!

This is hilarious that I found this on here. My mom has been making these for years. She calls them "prison omelets" because she learned how to make them from a friend that went to prison. I'm actually not that big of a fan of them, but they are easy to make and don't taste bad. But I'd still rather stick to my good old fashioned way to make omelets. I just got a kick out of seeing this on here.

This is a great recipe. Very easy and fun for kids to make with assistance. However, DO NOT USE CHEAP BAGS!!! Goodness what a mess! You have to use ziploc freezer bags. If you don't, don't waste your time because you will have an AWFUL mess on your hands. The cheap bags split on the sides and can't withstand the boiling water. I had to finish mine in the oven the 1st time. The 2nd, with the right bags it turned out perfect. And you can customize for each person's tastes. I made these because I'm terrible at making regular omelets.

Like others, I was skeptical of this recipe.  I just tried it now, (followed it to the letter) and it was fantastic!  Used heavy duty quart size freezer bags, with no breakage.  Next time I might play around with different ingredients (eggbeaters, etc.)  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe - it's so easy, economical, versatile and, oh yeah, YUMMY!

This is a GREAT recipe!  I was at a brunch with 20 people and we were all able to sit down and eat at the same time.  Definitely use freezer strength quart size bags, and of course writing your name is important to keep them straight.

We make these alot and is perfect when feeding a crowd.  You must use the freezer quart sized bags.  We have everyone label their bag with a permanent marker and they create their own omelet with the ingredients we set out including cheese, cooked meats (ham, sausage, bacon) vegetables (peppers, onions)and toppings such as salsa and sour cream etc.  These turn out to be perfectly fluffy omelets.

These were awesome, they looked absolutely beautiful. Came out of the bag perfectly. I mixed my two eggs and all the ingredients in a bowl first, then poured into the bag. I did some with 3 eggs and cooked them about 20 minutes and they were perfect. YUM!!

I don't know why, but this didn't work out for me. After 13 minutes I put the omelet on a plate and the middle was not done! I didn't even add all the suggested items either. I had to put the omelet in a skillet to finish cooking. I'm giving the recipe 3 stars because I was able to save the dish and my hubby liked it, but I won't do it in a bag again.

Excellent recipe.  My family enjoyed adding their own ingredients after I sauteed each separately.(mushrooms, grn. peppers, onions) Cut knotches in the top of baggie above zip line, so each person knows who's omelet is who's.

My kids loved trying this, adding the ingredients and mixing them up by kneading the bags.  It would have made 5 stars, except one bag hit the side, melted, and I lost half the contents.  Otherwise, this is a fun and easy recipe.  Bonus-clean up is throwing the bag away! Easy a repeat recipe.

I was very skeptical of this, but thought it would be worthwhile trying for camping.  I put out bowls of different omelette fixings, such as peppers, tomatoes, bacon, cheese, shrimp, onion, etc.  15 pepople put their names on a bag and made their own personal omelettes.  They were unbelievably good!  They came out looking like a professionally rolled omelet.  Everyone raved about them, there wasn't a scrap of food left on the plates.  I'm sure this will be a camping staple from now on.  Fun and delicious and a little bit quirky...what more could you ask for?

This is simple and tasty. There is no clean up. There are also so many ways you can make these omelets. My daughter added pepperoni, onion, green pepper, cheese and then topped it off with leftover spag. sauce. I also cooked sausage made gravy and topped mine that way also added raw shredded potatoes. The possibilities are endless.

What a neat concept!  I tried these for my husband and I, and we both loved them.  I did make one mistake in adding a 3rd egg, which hindered having it cook completely, but that is my fault.  

We shared this recipe with friends and we plan on trying it on one of our many camping trips!!

Our bags did not hold up to the boiling water; by the time the 13 minutes were done, the bags were in pieces and the omelets were floating. It was a bit tricky to fish them out, but they still tasted pretty good.

Well, this omelet sure isn't pretty (maybe because the bag I used was quite small, and therefore the omelet was a bit scrunched up), but it really does not get any quicker and easier preparation-wise! I also used 3 regular sandwich bags and closed them with a small chip bag clip. I made ours with cheese, onion, mushrooms and some diced spicy summer sausage. Delicious! Thanks, maryann!

I tried this recipe using the small amount of options I had: frozen chopped veggies (carrots, peas, corn & beans) and the eggs. The eggs turned out a bit too tough and rubbery in some bits. But all around it was good, filling and healthy. Easy to make too. The only thing I had troubles with was getting the eggs into the bags, anyone have any tips? PS, it tasted good served with mustard.

Used a reusable sous vide bag..tasted great, but did not slide out and look like an omelet and was not totally cooked..had to zap in microwave.maybe beating the eggs first made a difference.

Great recipe! My eggs were a little overcooked at 13 minutes, but I think it was because I added way less ingredients to the eggs than listed in the recipe.

So now I will not have to bring an omelette pan when camping.  I tried this recipe, 2 eggs, cheese, sliced ham and a splash of milk.  I made 3 of them, cooked for 13 minutes and they were perfect!  No muss, no fuss!

I wasn't sure the onions would cook in such a short time but they did. The addition of salsa was smart -- it added some nice seasoning to the omelet.

A word of warning (or learn from my fail!), use quality bags that have the press-together seal and not the slider. The slider seal will come apart in the hot water.

I've always wanted to try making an omelet like this. It was fun and interesting to try. It had too much cheese for me, but that's personal preference. Mine came out a little undone, runny in the middle. It could have used at least 30 more seconds. Otherwise, it cooked up and slid right out of the bag nicely.

I’m so glad this recipe is so forgiving of changes. I do not eat ham, but love bacon. I cut two strips of bacon up and sautéed them along with some vegetables. I put half into the omelet, the other half I saved for garnish. This is a unique way to cook for multiple people with multiple likes/dislikes.

This is such a cool and easy way to make an omelette. My husband prefers breakfast sausage, so we subbed Smithfield sausage instead. We also added the salsa in with the eggs instead of on top. Tastes so good! Definitely a keeper!

These were surprisingly good. I wasn't expecting much flavor, but was impressed with how they turned out. Very easy to customize to your own tastes and perfect for a crowd. I used a quart sized freezer bag, as a large bag (gallon) would have made a very long skinny looking omelet. These would also be good to whip up the night before and cook quickly in the morning.

I have heard of people making omelets like this for years, and I was excited to try for myself. I believe the key is getting as much air out of the bag as possible. Each of mine had a little air in there and the bags would float with one side up, so I maneuvered them around to make sure they cooked evenly. Ours cooked perfectly in 13 minutes - we had two with ham, mushrooms, peppers onions & salsa and one with just ham and cheese. Granted, it is so easy to make a regular omelet, but with this method, we could all sit down and eat at the same time instead of just one person getting theirs every few minutes! We will definitely be making these again.

I was really curious about this recipe and can report back that it does work. I followed another reviewers suggestion and used a quart size freezer ziplock bag and used a straw to remove all of the air. I made the recipe as written adding orange bell pepper and onion. The only thing I would change is to cook the eggs another couple minutes because ours came out a bit runny.

I made this omelet using ham, cheese, mushrooms, red bell pepper, and onion.  At first I was a little afraid because the quart size Ziploc started wrinkling up as if to melt, but it held up just fine.  I think my omelet was a little runny because of the mushrooms, but I took it out after about 15 minutes in the boiling water.  It was delicious!  I would definitely make this again!  Thank you so much, Smithfield!!

Start boiling the water before you prep the omelets, if you’re not making a lot and using few ingredients.

LOVE this idea for girls' weekend trips or group breakfasts.  Cooking times vary depending on # of eggs and other ingredients.  I found that if you take it out of the water bath, mash it around while in the bag, then return to the water, you will have a more evenly cooked omelet, though it won't be as "pretty".

I've made these several times.  It's great so everyone gets their own without babysitting a pan on the stove.  Write names with a sharpie on the bag and everyone gets exactly what they want.  I often have my kids add their own ingredients to the eggs in their own bag to make my life easier.

Freezer bags are needed, I use name brand ones just to be safe.  There are several quality brands to pick from. Don't use standard zip bags, they arent heavy enough to withstand the heat from the boiling water during the cooking process.

I made this the last day of our camping trip.  I used all our leftovers from breakfast and dinners before adding some shredded cheese.  I found I needed to cook it longer.  Then the boiling water was perfect for washing up the dishes.  Less mess on pack up day.

Because I can't eat cheese the recipe just peaked my interest and I just had to try it.  I added lots of veggie, some ham and salsa.  My husband raved about it.   Although we had no guests, it's still a great idea because there were no pans to wash.

The first time I read the recipe I was a bit skeptical, but now that I tried it I can't believe how amazing it tastes!

I wonder how this omelet would taste if I used quail eggs. A quail egg omelette sounds just magical!

super easy to do!  The best thing is that all omelettes are ready at the same time.  People selected what they wanted as fillings (onions, bell pepper, salsa, chopped ham, salsa, etc.) and then squished the ingredients together.  I love this message - also low in fat.  You must use ZIP LOCK FREEZER BAGS.

I tried this for the first time today. I have family coming in over the next month and thought this would be a great morning exercise we all could enjoy, building our own omelets. This works perfectly! Should be fun with the family. I am planning on setting up "Stations" where you build your own.

This has become my family's Christmas breakfast tradition. Get the fillings ready the night before, everyone chooses what they want, and a family of picky eaters is satisfied. As an addition, I make a big batch of crepes. The ladies eat them with sliced fruit and whipped cream. The guys wrap them around their omelettes and call them French breakfast burritos.

I've never been a huge fan of egg. I'm just getting into it now. This was the first egg recipe I tried and it came out amazing!!! I'll definitely be making more of this in the future. I only added cheese and kale, I can't wait to try more ingredients!

Made these a our cabin where clean up can be challenging without running water. The kids had a blast picking what to put in their bags. They turned out nice and fluffy. This will certainly be a go to breakfast for us. With our food saver we were able to make them at home and pack them in the cooler all ready to go with no worries of leakage.  Great recipe!

The 13 minutes didn't cook the inside of my omelette. Good thing i saw that before i rolled it out of the bag. I managed to turn it around in the bag so the previous top was on bottom and back into the water it went.

Omelet in a bag was very good except for the fact that I had to finish each one in the microwave because the center never got firm.

This is the easy way to make an Omelet and does away with the fat from frying. With my big pot I can cook 4 at a time.

I used a quart-size bag per others' recommendations, and I found I needed to boil it for 15 mins. rather than 13.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly ... it is a fabulous & easy way to make an omelet (which I could never do in a pan to save my life!).

This is basically cooking omelets sous vide-style without controlling the water temperature.  I would definitely recommend using BPA-free freezer bags (like Ziplock).  Thinner sandwich bags are likely to break open in the water bath.  The easiest way to remove the air from the bag is to place the ingredients into the bag and seal all but one corner of the bag.  Then, place most of the bag in the water bath, being sure everything below the zip-line is covered by water. That will force out all of the air left in the bag.  Seal the last corner at that point.  Most importantly, I would keep my water bath at a temperature below boiling.  When I prepare sous vide omelettes, I keep the temperature at 165ºF and cook for 20 minutes and they come out perfectly.  If you don't have a thermometer to help with maintaining a steady water temperature, I would recommend  cooking at a slow simmer, where a couple little streams of bubbles are rising, but most of the water is still (the water will be around 170–195ºF), or a simmer, where you'll have small to medium bubbles breaking the surface all across the pot (the water should be about 195–212ºF).  I would bump up the time accordingly -- to about 20 minutes with a slow simmer or 15-18 with a simmer.  I think these changes will alleviate some of the problems people are having.

We saw this recipe on tips for camping type site. It didn't work for us. It was real neat to see the eggs cook up and roll out of the bag, but it took way longer than 13 min and they still weren't completely cooked inside.

Made this with a group of teens in a cooking class. It got a two thumbs up from everyone plus it was fun to put together. My only caveat - don't crowd the pot because they take longer to cook. I will definitely be making these again, and according to the kids, so will they!

I've use this receipt a lot since I cant make an omelet using the regular method if my life depended upon it.  Its easy and allows for lots of variations and its fast. Highly recommended to those who cant do it the regular way.

I am a horrible cook and tried this. It worked somewhat, I had cheap bags and two of the three split at the bottom, not a huge big deal it happened toward the end. I was worried about this, so I was trying to keep the bag off the sides of the pot and off the bottom in the beginning. But in the end, I made breakfast without the smoke detectors going off and it was edible. My husband was proud.

I am the only one who can eat eggs, hubby and kids have allergy to eggs. I love this, no mess no added fat,  I would not use dollar store bags as the quality is questionable. I used 2 eggs, diced ham, onion powder wee touch of salt and  fresh ground pepper mixed in a bowl than pored  in a zip loc steamer bag, tasted great, no melting of the bag, I moved the bag now and then to be sure. Will make again.

I was really impressed with this . Mine took a bit longer because it wasn't quite cooked through . I turned it over in the pan and it was done in a few minutes  . I would recommend turning the bag over in the pan halfway through cooking time . Thank you  for sharing  .

The flavor is good but is necessary avoid the tomatoes in the recipe because drop a lot of water into the pocket. I definitive will do it again, next time a will put the cheese over the pocket when i finish(the cheese change the consistency, make it watery messy look).

I made this wonderful Omelette but didn't add mushrooms.  I used red pepper instead of green and I felt it looked more attractive.  I will be doing this recipe again as it was a big hit in our home.  I cooked it for 15 minutes instead of the 13 minutes as suggested.

I just did this yesterday for the first time. It worked perfectly! I cooked about eight bags in a large spaghetti pot for 13 minutes, worked like a charm. The only thing I didn't do was squeeze the air out of it, apparently I overlooked that step.

I used quart ziplock freezer bags, no breakage.

These turned out beautifully. I used regular sandwich sized ziplocks, and then wrapped the final result in a tortilla and made breakfast burritos out of them for the kids for breakfast! No muss, no fuss, and didn't have to clean a pan!

I love this and make them ahead on Sunday's for the week.  I use sandwich bags but whisk the eggs before putting them into the bag.  I also just use spinach, tomatoes...you can use whatever veggies you like.  

I leave them in the bag and put them in the fridge.  I grab one in the morning and put it in a "to go" container.  I top it with Salsa.  

Also, I have never had a bag tear open.  

Love this recipe!  I was doing eggs in a muffin tin and the clean up was the pits.  No clean up with these!  Perfect for me!!!

I made this and it's pretty easy. It tasted different than a normal omelette. Maybe the boiling changes they taste, or maybe it's the bag. Plus it came out looking nice but crumbled apart when I tried to eat it. So it was more like scrambled egg. I would use this recipe camping but for at home my frying pan works a lot better.

Very tasty, very easy, and customizable. I had five eggs and split it among three people. Works with any toppings.

Following instructions, the eggs were underdone.  Adding 2 minutes to the cooking time fixed that!  (My altitude is 4600 feet)

Thank you so much for this idea!  Combinations are endless, and clean up is so easy.  Made today, as written, and it's just great.  Will be a staple in our menu planning.

My mind is blown, I cant believe how well this works. I make a lot of omelets and eggs in general so I was a bit skeptical when I saw this but, was I ever wrong to be. I put chopped turkey, black pepper, cheese, and Sriracha sauce in my omelet bag. Then when I rolled the finished omelet out I was impressed that it was even whole. Even though the real thing to be surprised by was the perfect consistency not to mention the amazing  taste. It is the perfect way to  make an omelet.

Worked great, definitely use freezer bags. The salsa I used made the omelet to watery. Add the salsa after it's done cooking.

Easy and mess free, just remember use freezer zip lock bag and keep the water just at a low boiling. I found 15 minutes was best. Its a great way to make away from home, camping or on the road.  Also no oil so it has less fat. Much like a hard boiled egg.

My husband and I made this for dinner tonight. It was very simple and very versatile. One thing to note if you use extra large eggs, add on 3 minutes or so of cooking time. We can't wait to make this again.

I'm eating this now, maybe 14 or 15 mins?  But tasted good with pre-sautéed mushrooms and then jalapeno ketchup.  will do again and possibly change it up a little.

So simple and so healthy (read: no frying pan or butter)! And yummy - I deconstructed a sandwich because I wanted to use the fixins' in the omelet. :)  I posted a link to this recipe at my LifeWithASD FB page because this is an *excellent* and awesomely easy meal for our young adults with Autism to prepare themselves. Thank you Thank you!!

I made this yesterday for my husband and myself.  I followed the recipe and didn't make any variations.  It was great!  I'll definitely make it again.  It was fun and easy, plop it in the water and read the paper.  No fuss, no muss.

Loved this.  This is the only way I will ever make another omelet.  For ingredients I used: egg beaters, ham, Italian cheese blend, spinach, tomatoes, scallions, salt & pepper.

I followed others advice and used Hefty quart sized freezer bags.  I also flipped the bags completely over halfway through the cooking.  Since the elevation we're at is 5,472 ft above sea level, I increased the cooking time an extra 3 minutes.  This was fabulous!

This is such an amazing idea! I made three omelets this morning  at one time, and they all came out perfectly. I used my own ingredients (smoke house cheddar with onions, tomatoes, sausage and onions), but the method is what blows my mind. It is so simple and satisfying. My family loved it!

I will definitely make it again.  One word of warning though; I used egg beaters and when I rolled the omelet onto a plate it broke open and spilled a lot of uncooked egg mixture onto the plate.  13 min. Doesn't do it for egg beaters, 15 min. Works.

We have done this for years tailgating and rallies. Two suggestions: Spray the inside of the freezer bags with Pam before anything is put into the bag and use a Sharpie pen to have everyone write their name on their customized omelet. Have a buffet of fixings set up and everyone can have the omelet of their choice!

This is a fantastic recipe & I have been making it for years. Definitely use quart size freezer bags only. You may cook as many bags as will fit in the pot.  It's great to have all the omelets come out at one time and everyone eats together. Write the initials or names on the bags. You can put in whatever you would like: different meats, cheeses, veggies, spices. Whatever anyone wants in an omelet. My husband prefers Velveeta (it melts nicely), bacon, onions & peppers. I also add a bit of milk to his eggs to make them creamier. I serve it with toasted English muffins and fruit. It's great fun for the little ones to help as well!

I did this for a family reunion. The night before, I had each family member put their choice of filling in the bags and write their name on the outside of the bag. I only use name brand Ziplock freezer quart bags (not one bag broke ). Next morning to pots of water boiling had everyone fed at the same time. :) Served with toast!

I've been making this recipe for years.  It's especially great for large groups.  I do this in an assembly line.  I mark each bag with the persons name, put the eggs in the bags, line up all the ingredients, then each person can make their own combination.

The only complaint I would have about the recipe is the time.  I've never had one "well-done" under 30 minutes.  And the more you make in one pot, the longer it seems to take.  So allow yourself plenty of time.

Be sure to use 1 quart freezer bags.  Another trick is to use a skewer through the top of the bags to hold them upright.  Just be sure the egg mixture is totally submerged.

Serve with sour cream or salsa (or both).  Yum!!

I used a Seal-a-Meal bag because it seemed less likely to leak and because I know the plastic in them is supposed to be safe for heating food.  The use of other bags with heat seems questionable to me.  I reduced the cheese by half and omitted the salsa.  I made just one to test the recipe, and I'll definitely do it the next time we have a large number of people to feed.   If we take special orders I will try marking initials on each bag with permanent markers.

We make these and freeze them for camping trips. We prefer to use the seal a meal bags instead of freezer bags, less tendency to surprise open when boiling.

We have 4 of us that play cards every Sunday during the cold months.  We do this one often because it is easy and we make each one to our own tastes.  We use the freezer bags with the label spot on them for each of our names.  2 of us can't eat raw onion, so I cook the onions and mushrooms in a little olive oil before hand, also chop up a little bacon and cook it ahead of time.  Everybody puts their own bag together so you get just what you want.   A wonderful idea.

I have making these for years.  Especially good when entertaining overnight guests.  Guests can choose ingredients.  Be sure to use freezer ziplock bags and write names on bags.

Great for making for those with different schedules. Can you freeze for later? I'm going away and would love to have this option for my family while I'm gone.

Scouters do this all the time!  I don't think we've gone camping yet without having this for breakfast.  It's easy, customize-able and just plain yummy!  I don't think I'd do it at home, but maybe if I had a house full of people, just for fun.  One thing we do is about halfway through the cooking time, we pull them out and squish them a bit to get the raw and cooked mixed up, so it cooks more evenly.   

Two things - 1) be sure to use a marker to put names on the bags, so everyone gets their own back! and 2) be sure to squeeze out as much air as possible.  If not, this will clearly demonstrate how air expands when heated: maybe good for a physics demo; bad for breakfast, when bags explode, releasing eggs into the water.

Not quite a good as in a frying pan.  But works very well for large groups with picky eaters.  Young people really like being able to select their own ingredients.

Sounds truly insane but if you have house guests it's a bunch of fun. Folks who've not seen it before are amazed at how good they come out.
You'll see other reviews STRONGLY suggest using freezer grade bags.
Before starting use a Sharpie marker to put the "cook's" name on it!!!

Great for large groups. Hostess doesn't have to be cooking while everyone else is eating. Kids love it. Ditto the use of heavy duty freezer bags and eliminating excess air. I usually just leave a tiny opening, then squeeze out the air on top and seal. If you're cooking more than 2-3, boil longer and put names on the bags with Sharpie markers.

This is the only way we make omelet's now.  Moist and delicious!  We actually sauté our veggies and cook the meat before we add to the bag.  I think it helps with the cooking process. We have also used a splash of milk,  smokey links, Sausage and seasoned with salt and pepper.

I've been making eggs in a bag for years as a Girl Scout leader. Tip: DON'T put the cheese in until after the eggs are cooked. The fat in the cheese causes the bags to melt. Also, it must be freezer bags, not just plain zip lock storage bags. Also, no need to even use a plate, eat it right out of the bag!

I too use this recipe when camping or having lots of people over for breakfast and still want a yummy omelette. Everyone can eat at once and still have ingredients of their choice. We set out many different ingredients including potatoes, feta cheese, peppers and pre-cooked sausage. Fresh mushrooms can make it a bit watery so precook them or use dried. 
 I then have my guest write their name on the baggie.  Don't forget to let the air out of your baggie or it will pop and you will have a mess.  I seal the bag just to the end and rub the baggie over the edge of a counter so get the air out. Then seal.Also, the trick to the baggie not melting is to use a large enough pot of boiling water to not let the baggie lay over the top of the pan or to touch the side of the pan for too long.

Amazing recipe, I've spent many days scrubbing pans from failed omelet attempts, so this has really saved me a lot of frustration. I also love just how easy it is to make multiples at once.

Love this recipe! Thanks for the exact time because I'm always iffy on that. I use this a lot and put in whatever ingredients I have in the fridge that sounds good for the day. FYI - these don't look very big, but don't add more eggs! They seems to grown in the bag as you cook them. And to Sue, you definitely need to use freezer bags vs. sandwich bags. They are thicker and don't melt. Just be very careful to keep them off the side of the pan above the water line while cooking.

I have used this recipe for a long time. It's great for slumber parties, company, holidays and even morning bridal or baby showers. Everyone can choose their own ingredients from ham to sausage or bacon. I chop different vegetables according to what everyone likes and we have an omelet bar! These are good with muffins, biscuits or banana bread which you can make ahead for a hearty and filling meal!

We do this camping with our family.  We have found, however, it is best to add the salsa after cooking.  We write names on the bags and then crack the eggs into the bag the night before.  Doesn't matter if everyone doesn't eat at the same time - they can cook their meal when they are ready for it.  Very little mess and cleanup!  :)

Just so simple and the end result is more pleasing to look at than what I ever end up with when making omelets.  One of the test baglets I wrapped in a warm tortilla - awesome.  Put 2 cooked strips of bacon in the bag with the egg, the eggs cooked around them, nice suprise.

Although this was definitely easy, and would be great for campers, you do have to compromise on taste (IMHO). I only made one, and I mixed the eggs before putting in the bags, otherwise follwed directions. After about 7 minutes, it definitely looked done, so I panicked and took it out of the pot. It did slide easily out of the bag, but was for the most part overcooked by quite a bit - and this was at 7 minutes! But the results may have been different if there had been more servings in the pot. If I ever have to make omelets for a large number of people I MAY try this again, but I really doubt it, as the difference in taste is too noticeable.

I have been making these for years.  What I do when making for a crowd, I put all the ingredients (not only the ones listed in this recipe, use your imagination)in separate bowls and hand each guest a heavy duty zip lock bag.  The then they add the eggs and squish the bag and then walk arund the table and add whatever ingredients they desire.  Write their names on the outside of the bag with an indelable marker and add them to the boiling water.  After 13 minutes have them roll theirs onto a plate.  It's great for a crowd and everyone gets to eat at the same time.

The results are great, but this combination of ingredients and process would be much-better described as 'scrambled eggs' than an omelet. A proper omelet has a filling of separately-cooked whatever put in after the eggs are cooked.

I have done this for years on camping trips. You don't need to worry about broken eggs in a carton. Just boil the water on the fire in the morning and you are all set.

This is awesome! I couldn't get an om let to form, I always end up with a scramble and was worried the inside wouldn't be cooked if it did actually come out. I just saw this and made it, super easy and good! What a friggin great idea haha. TThanks for sharing!

I have used this for a family camping trip also.  Even the fussy eaters loved it and even wanted another one!  I have never had a bag break or leak.  I think half the fun is in choosing what you want to add.

Love it!
Kids love making their own concoction and taking the adult "orders" for custom omelettes.
Sue ... FREEZER BAGS.   Food storage bags are not as thick and they will melt!

We made this recipe in high school as a grade for a nutritional and wellness class.we added a tablespoon of milk to the egg mixture though,also if you cut your omlette in half,after taking it out of the pot,and it's runny just put it in the microwave for 15 minutes.to keep our bags from melting we held our bags in the water and held the top of the bags with tongs.

I heard of this before from a friend. We make these when we go camping. Cut all the add-ins up at home and pack them in separate containers or zip locks bags and store in your cooler. Quick easy breaky while camping with minimal dishes. Especially if you use paper plates.

I learned this from a friend of mine while camping 4 years ago.  There are always about 15 or so people so they all chip in preparing the ingredients and everyone gets 2 bags of personalized omelets with their name written on them.  I have done this at home also just for something different and always delicious.  Definitely great for large crowds!

I've been using this method for camping for many years. At home before going, I shred cheese, chop onions, mushrooms, olives, peppers, ham, etc. Anything that your family or friends that will be there, like in their omeletes. I put those ingredients in either heavy duty freezer bags or small plastic containers. When its time to make breakfast I put on a huge pot of water to boil. Then everyone gets their own heavy duty freezer bag and uses a permanent  marker to write their name on their bag. They put 2 or three eggs in the bag and squish it up to mix it, then add whichever of the ingredients they want in their omelete, adding salt/pepper if desired. Squish it around a bit more, sqeeze out the air and drop the bag into the pot of boiling water. We tend to cook them longer than required because we don't want to find uncooked egg in the center. Or you could use the gallon sized bags instead of the quart sized since they allow the mixture to spread out more and thus, cook more quickly. This is the best way to keep from having to stand over the camp stove cooking individual omelets for all those loved ones!

First time commenting on a recipe! I LOVED it!! Followed it to the tee and it turned out wonderful! I was nervous at first because I didn't have the expensive freezer bag, just the regular 1 gallon bag and it worked great! No melting, no leaking, no mess! Husband loved it too! This is now a Sunday morning breakfast favorite!

I used this recipe when we had some guest staying for the weekend. It was convenient and easy for everyone to make an omelet they liked. I added some additional add-ins for variety and everyone loved the idea and loved the omelet that this recipe makes.

I've been making these for years, I love it! This is an easy way to make an omelete, just throw whatever you want in the bag and boil. No mess. The omelete's just roll out of the bag and are really fluffy. You do have to make sure you are using good, strong bags otherwise they will come apart.

We made these when a relative was staying at my home. He showed me how, and it is really easy! The eggs even get mixed in the bag. When done the omelet becomes a really nice puffy rectangle shape, and we had put all sorts of toppings in them. For ease we used a steamer in the pot and the packages were in the water but they were not completely submerged. The good thing about this recipe is that everyone can make their own omelet the way they want, once all of the toppings are chopped. And, many bags will fit in a pot at a time.

I think the most important thing here is the concept, because obviously everyone is going to make the omelette to their own tastes :) I think this is a fantastic idea! and so so tasty, also a good remedy as I can never manage to flip an omelette well when I make one in the pan.. but this works perfectly! I've made it twice so far and have had no problems with bags breaking.. I place the first omelette in a freezer bag and shake and tie it and then place the second in a zip lock bag :)

I made this last night and didn't have the best luck with it. Although I think it was probably my own fault. After I made it I looked back and saw it said two eggs and I had thought it was three. Well I used two whole eggs and two egg whites in mine.  I used a heavy duty freezer bag and it held up fine other than at one point for some reason the zipper part of the bag would no longer stay closed which was a problem with keeping water out of the omelet as you could imagine.   At the end of the 13 minutes the outsides were done and the middle was not. Again this was probably because I used too much egg. However there was another problem. The egg that was done, well much of it anyway, was stuck to the bag.  So I'll have to try it again with just the two eggs because it's a good idea when you have a bigger family like mine with different tastes. Plus I like it because you don't have to use oil. It does take quite awhile though. Not really sure how long it takes to make an omelet normally but this seemed to take far longer.

Texture was different than a normal omelet.  So what we did is we only boiled it for 11 minutes and it turned out much better.  The second time we did add a little more cheese to it!  Besides that we will definately make this again.  Easy and Fun.
