This recipe caught my eye because I wanted to make a breakfast casserole but I was out of bread... :)  I excluded mushrooms and substituted broccoli for the green bell pepper and I used 4 eggs instead of 2.  It smelled delicious cooking!!! and tasted great too.  I will be using this recipe again.

I also keyed in on this recipe since I wanted to do a bake with sausage and eggs. It was pretty good, though I made quite a few changes, using 3/4 lb pork sausage, no pepper/mushroom/garlic, 4 eggs and closer to 1/2 cup milk, an entire batch of Betty Crocker 3-cheese biscuit mix that I had already stirred up before I saw this recipe, and mozz. and sharp cheddar both stirred into the egg mixture. I baked at 400 for half an hour then covered with foil and baked for an additional 15 min at 375. I will make again though with more sharp cheddar because it needs more edge.

This was a hit with my family, although I changed it up a bit. I didn't have spicy sausage, so used the bulk maple turkey sausage (from the Rootcellar)and didn't have mushrooms. I used a yellow pepper as I didn't have a green one. Added some spinach on the top before adding the cheese. Made my own biscuit mix from a recipe from this site and used Monterey Jack cheese. It was so good I would make it again, but maybe with different ingredients to have a different meal.

I thought this was pretty good. I didn't have peppers or mushrooms, but I added some spinach to the top and it tasted nice. It turned out a little soggy though, and the cheese topping just kind of peeled away as its own layer, so I had a hard time eating it in the same bite as the rest of the pie.
