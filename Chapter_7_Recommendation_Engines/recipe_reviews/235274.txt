This was incredible. I am on a gluten free, sugar free diet so I used Stevia in the Raw instead of sugar. You could not tell there wasn't sugar in it. My husband wanted MORE!  I have two more ramekins and hope they will cook up okay after a night in the fridge. I am finding it easy to substitute Stevia in the Raw 1:1 in any of the recipes I've tried since I starting cooking sugar-free.

These were really tasty, I made them for me and sister one night as a light dinner with a bit of salad.  I followed the recipe exactly, and everything was going swimmingly until as I folded in the egg whites I couldn't help but feel that something had gone wrong.  After I had put the mix into ramekins and into the oven I realised I had forgotten to add the apple to the soufflé batter (oops).  It didn't seem to hurt as they rose beautifully and we just poked a hole in the center when they were done and tipped the apple in (it was piping hot so it warmed up the apple).  All in all I think this recipe is a stunner.

made it as breakfast when i got off work early for me and my girlfriend. She had one word - 'Yummy!' The sweetness is a nice counter point to the cheese and eggs, with a light apple note. Though I did omit the salt and eyed the other spices. Bad habit of mine. Definitely going to save and make again!

Delicious. Made this for me and my toddler( a picky little gourmet) this morning and we both loved it. Will have to make it again.

I've made souffles enough times that I don't really need a recipe, but I was having a "senior moment" today and couldn't remember how long to bake, and at what temp.  This recipe looked good, and I knew I could substitute my lonely potato and a handful of spinach (pre-cooked) for the apple. I adjusted the seasoning to suit my personal preference, and used a souffle dish (buttered, then sprinkled with Parm) instead of ramekins, but followed the recipe otherwise.  One of the best souffles I've ever made.  Thanks for posting this good, customizable recipe!

I want to give this 5 stars, but it didn't come out perfectly for me. It's probably my fault. I usually cook with a butter substitute to keep things low fat. I imagine if I had used regular butter this would have come out perfectly. Even with my substitution it was still pretty good; the flavors were still nice. I would recommend making this but sticking to the ingredients as written.

While the directions and the video were easy to follow I just did not really enjoy the souffle. It tasted funny.

My first soufflé EVER and it turned out fabulous.  Beautiful presentation and easy directions. Will make again, after all, who does not like compliments on their cooking?
