This is fast and easy recipe that's good, too. You will have enough mixture left over for 2 more packages of crescent rolls. It makes a ton. I used carrots, broccoli, zucchini, green onions, and black olives for my veggies. I also added some shredded cheddar cheese as the final topping. It turned out good.

Great! I made this for a playdate. The moms loved it. I got the veggies from the salad bar at our grocery store the day before and then chopped them up. It ended up being cheaper, and I had tons of veggies to choose from.

This was amazing, I didn't use all of the ranch mixture on it because it looked so much but I wish I had.  I used broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and radishes.  Yummy!

This is a terrific recipe!  You may want to buy an extra roll of crescent dough as there's plenty of "sauce."  It's a keeper!

I think this is a great recipe.  I added some garlic powder, pepper and salt to the ranch mix, and it received rave reviews.  Put some shredded cheese over the creamy base, and it's even more dreamy.  It's a lot of work chopping the veggies, but worth it.  I put the recipe inside fillo dough cups, and the ladies at the Bible study thought they were in heaven!

I also top with salsa (you choose the heat) right before serving. It gives it a great flavor. I got this recipe at a Pampered Chef show a while back and lost it. I am glad I found it here!!

This really is the best way to make vegetable pizza.  I used an extra half package of cream cheese though, because it was too tangy.  I used a food processor to shred up cauliflower, broccoli and carrots.  It ground them into a kind of crunchy power-it was neat.  Then I sprinkled the top with shredded cheddar cheese.  Good stuff!

do not use all the dressing--way too much.   Flavor of the dressing is pretty boring and too mayonnaisie.  Only a few pieces were eaten.  No one went for seconds.  No one asked for the recipe.  If you try this only use a little sauce and lots of veggies.  But the crust didn't even taste good very long.

i couldn't find a vegetarian style ranch mix(most contain anchovies which are labeled under natural ingredient)so this wasn't the best choice for a vegetarian such as myself but the family(non vegetarians)ate it and thought it was edible. lol they are very hard critics but they also said they would have rather bought a frozen vege(rennet less  cheese, and veggie for me)pizza.

Make sure to add shredded cheese on the top like the photo chows, recipe does not call for it but is really good with it on there.

This was a great recipe.  It did make a lot of dressing.  I like my veggie pizza light on the dressing so I ended up using four tubes of crecent rolls for one recipe of dressing.  It was great though!  I somehow managed to come home from the store with no brocolli so I used shredded carrotts, chopped red pepper, chopped green onions, shredded cheeze, and fresh parsley.  It was fantastic and was a hit at work and at my evening get together.

I origionally had this recipie out of a Pampered Cheff book, lost that one and found this one.  It was amazing, everyone raved over it.  Super easy to make ahead of time and did really well in the fridge.  My son (3) who is a very picky eater even had seconds.

I'm so glad this recipe was posted.  I loved this at picnics growing up in the Midwest and had been looking for a recipe.  To make it a little healthier I used light sour cream, light Miracle Whip, and light cream cheese and the spread was still rich!  I will try fat-free sour cream next time.  Also the ingredients were rather expensive where I live.  Does anyone know of a cheaper alternative to the 2 packages of cresent roll dough?

This is a recipe I had tried before but couldn't find, so I was glad it was on this site.  Along with some of the standard vegetables, I added chopped water chestnuts for the crunch and sliced black olives for the contrast.  I sprinkled some shredded cheddar over the whole thing.  I had a lot of cream cheese mixture left over too, but I decided to use that as a dip for another day. We had it for a small New Year's Eve get together and the hostess informed me that I was not going to get to take any of it home.  Her husband just loved it.

Someone asked if there's an alternative for the crescent crust.  I use schwebel's wheat flat bread.  I do bake the flatbread until it's crispy.  I let it cool and proceed as recipe follows.

You can pretty much guarantee that anything with a crescent roll crust is gonna be heeeeYUMMY!  This was no exception.  The ranchy-sour creamy sauce was good just as a dip by itself if you have leftover.  Get creative w/your veggies.  I just threw broccoli, cauli, and carrots in my handy chopper and...presto!  Very easy.  Try it!  Just like the stuff they sell in the deli.  =)

I used pizza crust instead of cresant rolls because that's all I had on hand and it was great.  Used broccoli, carrots, cauliflower and onions as the veggies.  Chopped them all up fine with my chopper.  Everyone at the get-together raved about it and wanted the recipe.  The onions didn't taste so good the next day though.  I also added cheddar cheese to the top.

this recipe is Great.  It gives you great latitude to throw whatever vegetable toppings that you wish onboard.  and the fact that it is freeze till serve makes this recipe real easy to transport to the beach in a cooler or even to throw in the freezer ready for the evening ahead of time.  Great Recipe, solid flavors, heavily recommend this recipe.

Good for a light snack or to serve as an appetizer.  Not hearty enough for a meal.  Cresent roll crust made this good.  A little too many vegetables on the topping.
