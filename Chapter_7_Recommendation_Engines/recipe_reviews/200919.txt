This is a great way to grill zucchini.  We've always added a little olive oil to the butter, garlic, parsley mixture.  I just cut the zucchini in half and lightly score it then rub the butter mixture into it and grill.  The grill marks come out nice. After it's off the grill sprinkle with parmesan and let it melt.  If you put parmesan on during grilling it gets messy and may burn.  If you want to avoid all that just put it all in a foil packet.

This was soooo yummy!!! I cooked in the oven under broil and it turned out great but I had to add a little salt which made it perfect! It was hard to do the butter on the bottom skin side of slices - next time I think I'll just spray my sheet with non-stick and put the butter and cheese on one side. Ty for such a great dish!

These were fantastic!  Admittedly, I didn't really measure anything, just eyeballed it, as we are camping and I'm kinda lazy!  I mixed everything, brushed it on the zucchini spears, and slapped them on the grill (ok, Mr. LTH did the last part).  They were simple & delightful.  These will def be on the menu frequently at the LTH house.  TY, angie, for an awesome side dish!!!  (Photo on the way)

This is a terrific recipe!  I've made this a few times now for company and people always ask for the recipe and are excited to learn a new way to cook zucchini, especially for the grill.  I've taken the advice of some other commenters and used part olive oil, part butter, instead of all butter. I cut the zucchini lengthwise into four pieces; placed the zucchini strips on the grill, curved side up where appropriate.  I used a basting brush to coat the top side with the butter/garlic/parsley marinate.  After about 5 minutes I flipped the zucchini strips, basted the other side, and sprinkled with parmesan.  4 or 5 minutes later, theyâ€™re ready to come off the grill, looking gorgeous and tasting delicious.  I highly suggest adding this recipe to your grilling repertoire.

Nice, simple side dish requiring little effort and few ingredients.  I thought the amounts of butter and Parmesan a little too generous, however, so I just adjusted the amounts to taste.  Salt not in order because of the Parmesan, but pepper definitely is.  Hubs doesn't care for Parmesan, so he left it off his and I have to say I actually prefered his, without the cheese!

I'm doing weight watchers and I'm desperate for healthy good-tasting sides. I didn't have any parsley so I went with butter, minced garlic, salt, and the cheap sawdust-style parmesan. SO GOOOOD! can't imagine how good it would be with the right ingredients. Make this!

With no indication of how long these should go under the broiler, it's easy to end up with burnt cheese and underdone zucchini. Maybe try to include the instructions instead of just alluding to them.

Soooo good! I used both zucchini and yellow squash and both were good but I did prefer the zucchini. Made exactly as recipe described and added the parmesean cheese the final couple of minutes just to melt. No way to turn them, I was afraid all the 'good stuff' would fall off. Try this you won't be disappointed.

This recipe was wonderful. I use 4 or 5 TB of butter, a spin of olive oil and a spin of sesame oil. To this I added some sesame seeds and dry parsley, salt and pepper.  I put about  1/2 cup of grated Parmesan cheese and 1/4 to 1/3 c of Panko Breadcrumbs.  
     I used 2 zucchini, sliced off the ends and then sliced them in half lengthwise. I sliced a small portion off the skin side to both level the pieces and also to open up to the meat. I dried the squash with paper towels, and scooped out the center seeds and pithy part, and salted generously (this is a bland veggie and needs the salt even using the Parm.  I scored the skin side, and basted with the butter lightly on both sides. I put it flesh side down on the grill for 4 or 5 minutes, basted and flipped.  Then I filled the cavity  with the remaining butter mixture and filled with the Parmesan/Panko.  I grilled for another 8 minutes.
     Then I put them on a foil covered cookie sheet and put under the broiler for about 3 or 4 minutes, til the cheese was a beautiful crisp golden brown.
     We enjoyed this with Filet Mignon, and it was just perfect, not to filling but not needing anything else.
     In spite of salting as well as I did I will probably add a bit more next time, and there will definitely be a next time! Delightful way to enjoy summer's bounty of Zucchini.

This is a very simple and tasty recipe for zucchini! I didn't make it quite right (my dad does the grilling, and he used indirect heat, so they didn't get any grill marks) but it was still very tasty. I also spread the butter mixture on one side of the zucchini slices instead of both; I wasn't quite sure how to spread it on the curved skin side! Even with these changes, the zucchini lovers in my house enjoyed this dish, but we all thought it could use just a tad more of something...but we weren't quite sure what. All in all, it is a very simple and satisfying dish. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Baked these in the oven, 350 for 10 or 15 minutes. Just sliced a large zucchini into rounds and enjoyed immensely. Will be making these again for sure!

Great summer (or fall, if you are like me and still have zucchini to use up) side dish.  I did use the broiler to make this, and it worked just fine.  The garlic and parmesan add great flavor to the zucchini, but I would cut back on the butter a little.  Ours seemed to be a little too wet and oily, even after baking.  I am looking forward to trying this on the grill next summer.

Love this recipe, but I did change things a little bit.  Putting the cheese right on my grill was a bit intimidating and sounded messy.  I ended up putting the zucchini slices in a zip lock bag and then adding enough olive oil to coat the slices.  I then added the garlic to the bag and it coated everything nicely.  I created a tray out of aluminum foil, sprayed it with non-stick and layered the zucchini and cheese.  Came out simply devine!  YUM!!!

Love this!  First had it when my sister made it on her grill--delicious.  And, I noticed another reviewer remarked that they thought this recipe, while very good, was "missing something."  Well here it is: my sister heats up a little marinara sauce and serves in a bowl with a spoon for everyone to drizzle over the zucchini as they desire--fabulous touch!

Oh how I love this recipe! I use a zip lock bag and throw everything in to marinate then shake before placing on the grill. I don't know if I can ever tell my taste buds that it is time to try a different grilled vegetable recipe.

What a quick and easy recipe. I sliced the zucchini length wise into four slices. Once on the grill, I brushed on the melted butter, then sprinkled with garlic powder and parsley flakes. My family really enjoyed this dish, although they preferred it without the cheese.

These came out wonderful. I made them in the oven because I'm not good with a bbq grill. I did cook in microwave to the tender stage before placing ingredients on top and putting in oven. We loved the flavor these had.

This is a FABULOUS way to grill zucchini - so good we're having it again tonight for the second night in a row.  Super easy and the butter mixture doesn't just fall off the way that you think it will.

I cut the zucchini lengthwise and then scored the skin topping with the butter mixture.  I then placed the zucchini pulp side down on the grill till it had nice grill marks before turning over.  At this time the butter mixture had incorporated nicely into the scored skin side.  Once turned over I topped with the remaining butter mixture and then topped with parmesan cheese.

Absolutely delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe.  Not only has it become a "regular" it has sparked me to grill more vegetables right on the grill.  Have done broccoli and cauliflower and last night grilled baby carrots glazed in a mixture of balsamic vinaigrette and honey - again delicious!  Tonight will try grilling corn on the cob.

Very tasty.  Grilled on both sides and then put the parm/butter mixture on it and let it melt in.  Will be doing this one again!

My word, was this GOOD!  My husband, who is not a zucchini fan, gobbled it up and said how good it was.  Super easy, super yummy!  Going into our regular rotation.  Served it with our spaghetti and turkey meatballs tonight...talk about a filling meal!

My Husband & I loved this. I did what someone else suggested. I grilled the zucchini with the garlic, butter & parsley alone. When it was finished I added the parmesan cheese. Too bad I forgot the picture! I will definitely be making this again.

fabulous, just need to figure out how to make the parm stick to the zucchini instead of melting off and turning into a crispy puddle around it!

Love this recipe, didn't change anything the first time and it was great.  So happy for a new zucchini recipe. I have never been a big fan but this one changed all that for me.  Tweaked a bit on second try (olive oil, salt, and a seasoning mixture) to make it  more to our own tastes and even more delish.  Thank You Angie

I thought these tasted pretty good. I am one to just like the taste of zucchini without a bunch of added flavors, but wanted to try something different. I used whipped dairy butter to save some fat/cal and used half the amount of dried parsley for the fresh. I don't have a grill handy so I stuck it in the oven with some chicken I had cooking at 375. I baked them for about 40 minutes. At first bite I didn't know what to think, but after they came to room temperature they were delicious.

Will definitely make again! Very easy & all I added was garlic salt. Slicing the zucchini (like you would a cucumber) sped up the cooking process and I used a grill pan to keep anything from falling through...which would have been tragic!

I made these zucchini as "boats," scooping out the middle and filling it. I mixed the cheese with the butter, garlic, and parsley and added a little bit of mayo to make a paste then filled the boats before grilling. Very good.

I made this as written except I increased the garlic to 3 cloves, pressed and omitted the parsley as we are not fans.  Even though we like zucchini, neither myself nor my husband thought it was anything out of the ordinary.  In spite of the additional garlic, it was just okay.  Not much flavor and fairly limp.  Next time I think I may decrease the butter and marinate the zuccchini in a balsamic vinegar marinade first to see if that increases the flavor intrigue.

I had to pop mine in the microwave for a minute as they weren't quite tender enough after taking them off the grill, but that's probably my fault. Excellent flavor and will definitely make again.

Good recipe to use up zucchini. I added one fresh basil leaf and 2 mint leaves just because I grew some this year and wanted to use it. I did use part butter and part olive oil just because all butter might have burned on my grill.

Good recipe. I liked the flavor but the zucchini was to soft for my preference. I think next time I will just broil rather than grill. I grilled on my george forman grill and the butter did melt away. After I grilled it I broiled until cheese was slightly brown.

This is extremely delicious, very easy to make, and a nice twist on how to prepare zucchini. I don't have a grill so I broiled it instead. It turned out perfectly. My son doesn't usually try new things, especially vegetables, but he loved it. I will be making this again.

Loved this!  Since we were not grilling tonight.I baked this with my chicken dish.  I should have broiled it as the submitter suggested because the cheese did not brown, but it was still very good!  Hubby liked it too, and he is tired of the home grown zucchini!  :)  Will definitely make again.

Oh wow, this is very good. Not sure if it's healthy after adding the butter and cheese but it's delicious. I mixed my 3 tbsp butter with the garlic and some onion powder along with regular parmesan (didn't have fresh). Cut both sides of Zucc's so would lie flat. Scored one side. Started with scored side down and grilled (med heat) for about 8 minutes. Turned them over and grilled for about 4 minutes. Then slowly removed each one and added my butter mixture. Cooked for about 3 minutes then added a small slice of swiss cheese on top of each. Cooked for another 3 minutes and removed from heat. Family loved these. My son asked that I cook Zucchini like this every time!

This was pretty good but didn't seem to have a lot of flavor.  I added a little salt and that seemed to help.  I think maybe a bit more seasoning next time.

I brought this to a BBQ and it was the first thing to go. I eye-balled everything to my liking and added salt and pepper on top.

We seriously loved this.  Our mini zucchini got 4 slices, and I kinda ate 3 before my man noticed :(.  Used dried parsley with no problems, as well as parmigiano reggiano, but I'm sure that the bottled stuff would work just as well ;).

Excellent way to serve zucchini and summer squash!  Easily done in the oven, in addition to the grill.  I substituted olive oil for the butter, still great.

Simple and wonderful!  Nothing says summer more than some fresh, grilled veggies!  We loved these, did a mixture of a bit of butter and olive oil to spread on.  I only spread the mixture on the one side as I didn't want to lose any yummy topping during grilling!  GREAT!

I took this recipe as a really good starting idea.  I rubbed all sides of my zucchini wedges with olive oil, sprinkled on freshly minced garlic, freshly ground black pepper, and parmesan cheese.  Placed on the grill and it's fabulous!  Be careful to not overcook these, they turn rather mushy but still tasty!

I put my zucchini in a foil packet on the grill and it came out so-so.  It would probably be better straight on the rack.

These were very good!  So easy!  The only thing I might do differently is season the zucchini with a little salt or maybe even garlic salt before putting on the butter/garlic mix, because I felt that once you got past the topping the zucchini was a little bland.  That is probably just a personal preference.

Very nice!  I halved my zucchini instead of slicing them, and probably used a lot less parmesan than called for.  Hubs grilled them for about 15 minutes over indirect heat, which left them crisp-tender the way we like them.  The parmesan had melted, but hadn't browned, so I slipped them under the broiler for about 1-2 minutes and they browned up beautifully!  I do think they needed a bit of salt and pepper to heighten the flavor.   For those having difficulty spreading the butter on, be sure to blot the cut sides of the zucchini with a paper towel absorbing as much moisture as possible.  The butter will adhere better and spread much more easily.

I love zuchinni and had high hopes for this. The flavor was good, but I thought it ended up way too greasy from the butter. I think next time, I'll cut that way back. The garlic and parm were great though!

Instead of spreading the butter mixture on both sides, I only spread it on the cut side, then laid them out on a baking sheet and broiled them for about 8 minutes.  I don't bake zucchini enough to know when they're done, so although they were a success, I wasn't sure they were cooked all the way through (they were still a little stiff), so next time, I may bake them for about 10 minutes first, and then broil them for a few minutes.  They were VERY good, all four of my picky eaters had seconds, and my husband was delighted.  I will definitely be making these again.  Thanks for the great recipe Angie!

One tablespoon of parsley is not nearly enough for my family (nor two cloves of garlic). But as I had very little parsley I added half again as much fresh oregano. We had lots of scallions so I chopped up some of them too. My husband prefers olive oil so I used only a little butter.  I had whole mushrooms to use up so added those.  Nothing but changes to this wonderful recipe!  I was too tired to fire up the BBQ so broiled the veggies instead.  My husband was very impressed. And that is despite the fact that I totally forgot the parmesan!  I was so tired and in such a rush.  It is good to know that it's great even without.  Can't wait to try it with the cheese.  Great recipe for stimulating creative juices.  (Needs a little S&P.)

I had a large zuchinni. I sliced 3/8 slices at a slight angle to make them oval. Whole family loved it with mesquite briquets. I will try this recipe in my smoker next. New favorite at my house.

Followed recipe as is...found it very difficult to spread butter, parsley and garlic on zucchini...most everything slid off while on the grill, and therefore really didn't flavor the zucchini.

I love this recipe.  It was a great way to spice up the usually grilled veggie night.   The only problem I had with this recipe was that cutting the zucchini as it recommends could be quite dangerous and I recommend cutting them in circle pieces versus...halfing them length wise and then cutting the lengths in 3 flat pieces or 3 triangel pieces.

Delish! I made this and everyone at the party was very impressed. Weeks before this, I had to bread the zucchini with Italian breading and added some parmesan cheese to give it a kick. I peeled the skin off the zucchini first before breading it and cooked it with butter and the taste was amazing.

This tasted nice but I would make a few changes next time as I found it a bit watery and very slippery to pick up and eat. I don't have a bbq so I used the kitchen grill (US = broiler). 1 - I would wash the courgette before I sliced it, not after (I'm not very good at this cooking thing...) 2 - I would make thinner slices, my courgette was pretty big and fat so my slices were quite thick and I think this is why it was watery. 3 - I would blot the slices or maybe put them under the grill for a minute to dry them out a bit. 4 - I would not oil the underside because the butter dripped down there anyway which aided in cooking that side. 5 - I would peel a strip down the side of the courgette so that the outside slices lie flat. If you are using the kitchen grill these need a much longer cooking time. I cooked them on high heat without the cheese for about 10 mins until they were sizzling, then added the cheese and continued to grill until it was browned.

This was excellent.  It fits with our low-carb diet great.  We like to throw this on the grill along with our entrÃ©e.  Very tasty.

I love the simplicity of this recipe. By using quality ingredients (like good cheese and flat leaf parsley...also known as Italian parsley) this wonderful side dish is just as memorable as the star of the plate ! The only thing I suggest is that you grill the top, flat side of the zucchini first (where the cheese is going to go). To give them grill marks and that delicious grilled flavor on both sides. Plus it help heat up the surface of the zucchini to melt the cheese. Then flip and add the cheese. Yum !!

This recipe is fabulous!  My husband fell in love with it the first time I made it for him and now we keep fresh zucchini on hand at all times.  He wants this as a side about 3 times a week!  So easy to make especially if you substitute the garlic, butter, and and parsley with Garlic & Herb SautÃ© Express cubes which you can find near the butter at your grocery store.   Mmmmmmm......

Made this in the oven, did not use butter instead I used olive oil spray and  also added a small amount of feta  cheese to each one.  My husband who doesn't care for zucchini loved it!

we cut the zucchini in rounds instead of lengthwise.  came out good but the cheese got a little too burned on the top.  still tasted great though - would prob lower heat next time.

This was awesome.  I actually ate this on a night that the family was having Chili dogs with homemade chili.  I am really trying to be conscience of what I'm eating for the next 30 days;(going into the holidays)no sugars, processed foods, beef, etc.  You know all the good foods that causes the belly budge! I prepared this on the George Foreman Grill, just as good. Got lots of zucchini, I will be trying some other recipes I've saved.  But I will definitely be doing this one repeatedly.

We eat zucchini 2-3 nights a week when in season.  This is the first time we tried grilling them and absolutely love the taste.  Our finicky son stopped by for supper the other night and he loved them too.  I prefer them sliced 3/8" or 1/4".  We never remember to put the cheese on to melt it so we just shake it on at the table.  Yum Yum!

I didn't have any parsley so left that out, but garlic butter is always delicious.  I sprinkled some course ground salt and cajun seasonings on top of the zucchini before adding the parmesan and broiled for 7 minutes.  It was a big hit at dinner - Delicious!!

I chose to broil the zucchini since we had just had a snow storm.  The recipe was quick and easy and the flavor was good.  The zucchini was a little soft for my liking though.  Perhaps I should have cooked them a little longer.   I will definitely try these again on the grill.

AWESOME recipe!!! We were blessed with an abundance of zuchinni in our garden this summer, and I was so glad to find another way to use them! Very tasty, and a quick addition to any meal, since most of the time I cheated and used garlic powder, Kraft parmesan cheese, and dried parsley.

I didn't have fresh parsley or parmesan cheese on hand so I used dried parsley and pre-grated parmesan and did them under the broiler and wow! Fantastic recipe and an amazing way to cook zucchini :)  Will definitely be making this again!

Easy to make and it is nice that you can prep it early.  Be careful about cooking it more than about 8 minutes; the underside will burn without you being able to realize it.  Very tasty, but next time I'll broil it at 450 in the oven.

Absolutely delicious!!!  My family loved these.  Our grill has some "hot spots" so cooked them uncovered on foil.  Super easy - added this one to my recipe box.

This zucchini was delicious, but we used asiago cheese instead of parmesan.  We let the asiago cheese get just a little crispy.

This is WONDERFUL! This was mt first time having grilled zucchini & I am HOOKED! I left out the parsley because my kids are super picky, & added a bit of Garlic Salt instead of the Garlic Cloves. Thank you for this WONDERFUL recipe.

Good recipe, definately needed to add some salt and I think they are better left in halves instead of quarters, the butter mixture stays on better. Will make it again.

Delicious! I subbed basil for the parsley.  I had some butter mixture left over so I used that on some fish I was grilling, topping with parmesan also.  Really liked this one a lot!

Very tasty!  I didn't pay strict attention to the measurements, preferring to eyeball it it.  I also added a touch of olive oil.  I didn't bother spreading the concoction onto the bottoms, only putting it on top.  I placed them on foil and broiled them for 10 mins, but 12 mins might be better next time.  Fantastic!  We only recently added zucchini to our diet and I'm excited to have a tasty, quick, and easy way to prepare it!

This is a super easy and yummy to make zucchini.  I use unsalted butter and add a little salt to the mixture.  I've always used the broiler so I only spread the butter on one side and top with shredded cheese.  There is no need to bake before broiling, just set the rack about 6 inches from the flame and cook for 8 to 10 minutes.  Be sure to leave the oven door cracked open.

Awesome way to use the abundance of zucchini during the summer!  Quick easy and so tasty!  I just made 4 slices for myself for a light lunch with some bread - awesome!  I used country crock light instead of butter and cut down the Parmesan a bit and only had parsley in a jar, and just baked it at 350 for 10 minutes and then broiled for 8min and it was still GREAT.  Perfect for spicing up boring microwaved zucc.  Thanks AngieItaliano!

I really liked this recipe.  It was easy to prepare and to grill.  I think the next time I might pop it briefly under a broiler to crisp up the top just a little.  Otherwise, a nice alternative way to serve zucchini.

My grill had run out of gas before putting them on, so I put put them on a pan and baked in my oven.  Used a little less melted butter and since my zucchini were small, I just cut in half rather than wedges.  My husband will eat almost anything but this got rave comments and he said he'd like to see this on the menu again very soon.  I'm sure the grill would have added an even deeper flavor.  With this being so super easy to do, his wish will be granted next week!

Very good and easy.  Like that you don't have to turn the zucchini on the grill.  Next time  I will use fresh grated parmesan though.

Scrumptious. My husband said it would beat any restaurant. I cut mine into thicker strips - 4 per zucchini. That was perfect. As a result, did take longer than 8 minutes on grill, but it was easy to tell when cooked by lifting up on spatula. Loved it! Will plant more zucchini next year just because of this recipe.

I didn't feel like firing up the grill so instead I set the over to 350 and cooked the recipe for about 12 minutes. The zucchini was still very juicy and the seasoning was amazing. We will cook this again in the near future for sure.

Made this tonight.  No grill handy, so baked (as suggested by a helpful reviewer) at 350 for 11 minutes then about 2-3 minutes under the broiler.  I also did not use the parmesan cheese, as the chicken thighs and mexican rice that accompanied the meal were rich enough.  Husband said "Give that a zucchini recipe a 5 star rating!".  I would prepare the zucchini the exact same way, but WITH the parmesan IF the protein were lean and starch was less carb heavy.

I did change it up a bit. Instead of adding olive oil like others suggested, I added 2 tablespoons of softened cream cheese and left out the parsley. Mixed all the ingredients together. I scored on one side and brushed both sides with butter. Grilled the non-scored side for approximately 10 minutes, flipped over, smeared the cheese mix on top, and grilled for another 5 minutes. Delish!

I wish this recipe would've stated how thick to cut the zucchini... ours were about half inch (it was a big zucchini) and took a good 15min or more to cook... it ended up good regardless. I didn't put it directly on the grill, I used tinfoil as a "tray". next time ill cut thinner slices.

Loved this recipe. The only change I made (because I didn't have parsley on hand) was to grind Italian herbs on top of the Parmesan cheese. It was delicious and I will definitely be making this again!

Oh my goodness! We loved this. I waited to add Parmesan cheese until the last couple minutes of cooking time. Bring on the Zucchinis!

Made it just as directed but did put the zucchini on heavy duty aluminum foil and it was perfect!  Cooked it on medium on the the grill for 8 minutes.  A keeper!

I did use the aluminum foil on the grill or it would have leaked and flamed all over.  use cheese last as it will get crispy too quickly.  everyone loved the taste.  I  did add sea salt for a touch more flavor.

Made this fresh & easy dish just as recipe said. Awesome! Definite keeper for zucchini dishes. Cooked on foil on grill at medium heat with lid closed for exactly 8 minutes. Perfect! Paired this with a romaine & tomato balsamic salad & stuffed hot peppers with sausage. Lit a few candles. Perfect date night dinner on the deck for my guy!

Considering all the good reviews, I was surprised at how poor this turned out. I followed the recipe exactly. First problem was spreading the butter mixture on the skin side of the zucchini doesn't really work. After 8 minutes on the grill, the top side was still raw. But the underside was burned. So I flipped them to cook the top but the parmesan cheese just burned on that side. What a mess.

I like the tip from one reviewer who slices the skin off on the curved side,Grills easier and the butter mixture goes on easier.Used my cuisinart elec grill so no turning.Also salted a little before brushing on butter mixture
 :) Delicious!

This was just ok.  I expected a little more flavour.  Maybe if the spices weren't mixed with the butter.  I did add cheese at the end to make sure it stayed on the zucchini.  Sorry. Just wasn't our thing.

Truly amazing.  I used 2 medium yellow squash, sliced 1/4 inch thick.  Used 1 TBL light butter and reduced the amount of cheese since I am on WW to 1 TBL + 1 tsp cheese (was 2 pts total for 2 servings). I patted the squash then spread out the light butter and topped with cheese.  Kept all other measurements the same.  Broiled.  Will make again and again.

Good recipe.  Great use of zucchini.  My hubby dislikes parmesan so I top some with Panko bread crumbs instead of parmesan.  He likes them, too!

i needed an idea for the rest of the mexican squash i had so i used this recipe.. 2 T of veg oil in place of the butter, 2 t of garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, mistakenly only used 1/4 c of parm but it still came out good.. didn't have fresh parsley so used 1 t of dried oregano instead.. it was very tasty.. would like to see how it would come out with the full amount of cheese and parsely.. ty for the recipe as a starter

Excellent!  I used a combination of zucchini and summer squash, added some red bell pepper slivers and slivered shallots.  Broiled it for 2 or 3 minutes at the end to brown it.

Surprisingly good.  I made this while I was remodeling my kitchen so I was using the BBQ for everything and had to get creative.  I still make this even with my kitchen finished.

Really good...only suggestion is to be sure to grill for more than 8 mins. unless you like the zucchini to be a little crunchy.

Love it! It was easy, quick & delicious.  Great summer recipe. Used all my garlic yesterday to make garlic butter that I ALWAYS keep in the fridge so used that instead.

These were a hit.  I fixed in the oven because I had chicken going, and finished off under the broiler.  Will definitely make these again.  Thank you for sharing.

I had one zucchini left from my garden and wanted to try a new recipe. This was pretty good. I just added salt and pepper to taste.

We really liked these! I did need to add a little salt to bring the flavors out more though, but other than that, this was delicious and will be made many times! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a great recipe!  I LOVE zucchini and am always looking for new ways to prepare it.  I also make it this way with goat chese instead of parmesean sometimes.  I love it both ways!

Just adding salt and pepper and only putting a little of the mixture on each zucchini and broiling it worked perfectly - very nice presentation too!

Well... these tasted really good but I couldn't get the butter mixture to stay on the zucchinis, it won't stick when I was brushing it on and then it seemed to melt right off as the zucchinis were cooking. They had good flavor but I think I may have done something wrong while preparing them.

It's -30 right now so obviously I won't be doing any grilling.  I was able to broil this in the oven with no problems.  It was delicious, even my fussy eaters devoured it!

It was okay.  Maybe I didn't grill it right but there was too much of a smokey BBQ taste to it.  I thought it took away from the flavor.  Maybe I will try it again in the oven on broil.

Delicious! Followed another reviewer's suggestions: scooped a little bit out, filled the gap with the butter/garlic/parsley mixture, then cooked on the grill and added parmesan before serving. Will definitely make it again!

I have tried just about every recipe that I can find using zucchini and this one is my favorite.  I did this slightly differently after reading the reviews.  I made a paste of the garlic & salt to add to the softened butter & pplied it only to the tops.  I didn't use fresh parmesan but I think it would've been even better!

I really like zucchini but my family does not. I have been trying to find a recipe that the family would love, and this was it. My teenage daughter who is not a fan of this vegetable nor my husband, had seconds. Really, who doesn't like cheese and garlic! Thanks this recipe was a hit!

Very bland for our taste, I followed it exactly but it just did not work for us.
