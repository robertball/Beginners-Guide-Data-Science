The goose is crispy skinned, bursting with flavor and the sauce, rich & thick, is outstanding! The last time I made it, I marinated the cherries in the port wine first, then cooked them according to the directions listed.  Yum!  I've also subbed with strawberries too.  Just FYI, I wouldn't try to feed more than 4 people with a goose this size.

I made this recipe as stated, other than omitting the green onions and using a duck in lieu of a goose. I did not like the sauce as much as I'd hoped to... The soy sauce just gave it an odd taste, but my hubby-to-be loved it. I did marinate the cherries in the port wine for about an hour. Since I wasn't a fan of the sauce, I squeezed some of the cooked lemon and orange onto my portions, which made it good enough for me.

There's something about a crispy, fatty goose (or duck) and fruit.  It's the perfect combo.  The richness of the goose is mellowed with the sweet tart cherries. We served it with wild rice and roasted roots for Christmas. Super good.  Couldn't find port in my house so I used sherry and pinot noir (which we served with it too).  Totally perfect.
