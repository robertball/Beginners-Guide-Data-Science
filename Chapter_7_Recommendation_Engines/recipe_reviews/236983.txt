Yummy! This was so easy & we LOVED it! It's very similar to a recipe we've done in a casserole dish for years. I swirled a little caramel sauce on top, honestly, just to make it pretty, but everyone thought it added a very nice compliment to the chocolate. This is a keeper! Thanks, sjryan! Youre Mom's a genius!

Just made two for Thanksgiving and they were yummy! I used the Hersheys dark chocolate pudding mix and real whipped cream instead of cool whip. Only problem, the white cream cheese layer somehow disappeared! Not sure if it just blended with the chocolate layer or what! First time it has happened to me making a double layer desert! Next tim I will chill it before adding the pudding layer.

This pie is the best chocolate pie I have ever tried! The cream cheese layer adds so much flavor to this recipe. I used the smaller pie crust and it made 2 pies and left a little in the bowl for my kids to gobble up. I will definately make this again.

This is such a great recipe! I have probably made it 20 times now. I do mix it up with different types of pudding. I have used lemon, white chocolate, butterscotch, vanilla and banana. All amazing!

Tonight I am mixing one box of chocolate with one box of banana pudding :)

Thanks for sharing = )

Loved the flavourful boost the cream cheese layer gave this! Only change was I made a chocolate cookie crumb crust and used real whipped cream on top. Also made a second pie at the same time but with butterscotch pudding instead...that one was great too. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

A+, family favorite! The only deviation from the recipe was adding brownie crumbles between layers and on top! Excellent dessert!

I made this for Thanksgiving & everyone loved it so much I had several requests to make it for Christmas too! Best chocolate pie I've ever tasted, hands down! I use smaller pie pans so this recipe always makes 2 pies for me plus I cut down on the whip cream some, it's a lot.. but definitely highly recommend this!

It was ok, nothing to rave about.  The day after making it, I noticed a pink discoloration beginning on the cool whip. Not sure what caused this- the chocolate pudding perhaps? Made it look in appetizing to me.

Very easy and very good. I had some mascarpone I needed to use so substituted that for cream cheese. My pie dish wasn't deep enough, so had pudding leftover but that was ok. Grated a Hershey's chocolate bar on top!

I made this as the recipe calls but found out it doesn't fit well into a 9 inch pie plate. You could almost cut the recipe in half. Otherwise it was great. My grand kids loved it!

Great pie!  I used a graham cracker crust, made extra thick.  the cream cheese layer was a great addition.  I usually make home made whipped cream but did not have time. Used the extra creamy cool whip and it was delicious!

Delicious pie.  I did not change anything.  The next  time I make it I will use a smaller pie crust and use Keebler's graham cracker pie crust instead of a knock off.

This is SO easy and SO good! ! Iced cream cakes used to be our bday cake "go to" but now I get requests every year for puddin' pie instead! We mix up the toppings. Health crumbles are our go to but you honestly can't ruin this pie. Delish!!

This was an amazing pie!!! By far the favorite at my house and it was super easy to make. I did end up with almost 2 pies worth of ingredients though... so careful when you put it in your pie crust!!!!

Yum! A tasty twist to an old family favorite of chocolate pudding pie. I used coconut whipped cream and coconut milk and it turned out great! Thanks for the recipe. :-)

This was a really easy recipe with a beautiful result.  My husband loved this pie. Going to make for this Holiday.
