This was awesome and soooo easy.  I, too, definitely recommend the foil (I used the foil sheets with the holes for grilling).  I also brushed a good amount of sauce inside the fish to get the flavor all over.  My husband went wild for this one.

I think this is just about the best salmon I've eaten.  I didn't change the ingredients at all.  I did however use a salmon filet rather than a whole salmon as that is just too much for us unless we have company.  I don't think it would matter what cut of fish you used as long as you don't over cook it.  I put the filet in one of those fish holders for the bbq since it sticks to the grill.  Dipping the cooked fish in the leftover sauce is a good idea.  I have yet to find one person who doesn't like this recipe and I've made it quite a few times now. The sauce is so rich and yummy - come to think of it, I'm going to make it for dinner tonight! Thanks for a good one!  PS  I bet this sauce would make the most delicious chicken wings.

Alright taste.  I prefer my salmon to be baked with lots of onions and lemon.  Depends on your taste I suppose.  The smoked flavoring is quite nice though.

I just finished grilling this on our Weber. The results were good, but we thought the glaze was a bit light on flavor. We then began dipping the salmon into the leftover glaze. YUM! So we would suggest leaving a bit of the glaze on the side to pour over the salmon just before serving, our have it ready as a dipping sauce. Very tasty that way. Thanks for the recipe!

I put this in foil with the sauce and cooked it on the BBQ.  This was GREAT!  I served this at my daughters birthday party.  I have had several requests from people that I make it for them again.  It was the best.  Not fishy!

I cooked the fish on the grill but I used foil. It prevented the fish from falling apart and it kept the sauce from sticking to the grill. The taste was still great !

My family and I loved this!  We are trying to add more fish to our diet, but was tired of just broiling it.  I let it marinate for a couple of hours, then grilled it on heavy duty foil.  If you don't it will stick and fall apart.  The kids really liked it too.  Great way to do Salmon.  Doesn't taste fishy at all.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the best Salmon I have ever made. I followed the recipe exactly with some minor tweaks of my own.(sorry didn't write it down,added a little of this & that)  I am well known for making my BBQ smoked salmon, but I had over the top compliments on this one i made for our sons graduation. Everybody loved it. Will for sure be making more often. 10x easier to prep & cook compared to my original famous salmon.

Sweet and sour all at once.  I used the ingredients as a marinade and baked in the oven instead of on the grill. I will make again, but will use the marinade also for veggies or for rice.

very simple for a hot evening! My family thought it had a tint of teriyaki flavor to it.  Also it's easy t reduce the portions.

We've made this on our weber grill many times, guess I just never rated it, easy and quick, sometimes I also add T. low sodium soy in lieu of liquid smoke.

This was very different from any other way I have ever prepared salmon.  It was kind of like a teriyaki glaze, but a bit sweeter.  I enjoyed it very much and will make it again.  I made two filets -- one for dinner last night and crumbled the other one into a salad for my lunch today.  Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful alternative to dill and tartar. I added 1/2 part melted butter to 1/2 part honey. Grilled on heavy duty foil sprayed with garlic flavored olive oil for easier clean up. Thanks Jim!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  It is very simple and full of flavour.  I would suggest that you use heavy duty foil paper when grilling this on the BBQ, it prevents the salmon from falling apart.  Great light selection on any occasion.

A bit on the sweet side...it overwhelms the natural taste of the salmon. But I can see how some people would enjoy this.

very delicious alternative to garlic, lemon and dill.  I also used slotted foil to BBQ, for fear of the fish sticking to the grill. We still basted and flipped, the foil was only covering the fish loosly. (and parts of the fish did stick to the foil, so it could have been a disaster on the grill! We also saved some sauce for dipping. Thanks for the recipe!

I just got up from the dinner table after eating this.  It is OK....I made it in the foil like a couple of the others had suggested, but I think throwing it on the grill without the foil would have been way better.  I think the sugar would have cramelized and it would of had a better taste.  Doing it in the foil just left a runny sauce.

This was quick and delicious!  We use a Weber BBQ and instead of putting the meat directly on the grill, we use heavy duty aluminum foil.  Baste the salmon and then pour enough sauce so the fish is laying in it.  Be careful that the coals are not too hot or your sauce will carmelize too much and burn.  Enjoy!

We live in the land of abundant salmon and this is one of our favorite recipes.  We add some minced garlic on top before cooking.  Yum!

I thought that this was just allright, it definitely was sweet but I didnt think that it had much tang. I will stick to the firecracker salmon recipe from this site.

Maybe it was the fresh sockeye salmon my son had caught earlier that day, but this is one of the best salmon recipes I've tried.  My husband doesn't even like fish, but he loved this recipe (said it wasn't "fishy" at all). Easy and delicious - this is definitely one I will make again.

I was disappointed...my sauce burnt on the grill and my salmon crumbled all over the place.  I had a mess.  What parts didn't burn had a great flavor tho!  I'll try again. (I used foil on my grill too.)

Saying something is too sweet isn't usually something I do, but this was too sweet.  There was no other flavor except sweetness.  I thought the liquid smoke would add some flavor, but it really didn't, and I added a bit more than a dash because I liked the flavor of it so much.  I also grilled it, and it still only had a sweet and bland taste.  If you like sweet you might like this, though.

This was just a bit sweet for us.  I will try again with 1/2 the amounts of brown sugar and honey, replace the apple cider vinegar with soy sauce.  The recipe as is does need salt added for our taste but if I use soy sauce it will probably provide enough salt in itself.

Apparently I am not the best salmon cook.  This was as bland as ever.  My husband hated it the kids wouldn't touch it and I only ate it because I don't like to waste food.  It has a decent sweet flavor, but not enough *ooomph*.

LOVED this salmon!! I will definitely add this to my favorite BBQ recipes. I marinated the salmon maybe 20 minutes, but next time I'll let the sauce marinate longer to make sure I get the most flavor in.. Can't wait to make it again for guests! MMMMmmm

I prefer the lighter flavor that this recipe allows, with the flavors of the salmon being just slightly topped by the "BBQ". However, my husband prefers more of the BBQ and smoky flavor, so I simply marinated half of the salmon overnight for him. Such a simple and very tasty recipe!!

Not bad, although the American sweet tooth taste and a whole cup of sugar and half of honey made me baulk a bit. Too bad liquid smoke is not easily available in EU. It is not exactly banned, but hard to find.  One can, of course use the traditional alder chips within a foil wrap for the smoked aroma.  As for me, this simple recipe seemed to be a good base to try something of my own. Starting with a heavy molass brown sugar chunk that had just about petrified. Tried cheese grater.. nah. Resorted to heavy weapons and had a melee with a lump of sugar versus a butcher's mallet on the balcony in 20 below zero centigrade. That taught the bastich.  Then stuck to the recipe pretty much as is, but I added a few handfuls of almond slivers, some champignon slices, and a hefty pinch of chili powder to cut the sweetness a bit.  The additions don't really make it any more complicated, and take under a minute. At least everyone liked it. Including the cat, which is certainly a recommendation.

I had a bunch of not the best quality salmon I used this on and it was a big hit. I cannot wait to try it on some good fish. It is a bit expensive (the honey) so I halved the recipe and it works fine. I'm not a huge fan of liquid smoke so I either omit it or use less than the recipe calls for.

First off, I had to readjust the servings since there are only two of us (ever tried to do an 1/8 of a dash??)  I used just a fresh filet of sockeye salmon and the results were excellent and the recipe couldn't be easier.  My husband kept saying "this is good, this is really good!" and I whole heartedly agree so this is going in the "definitely do again" list.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it!  I made a double batch of the marinade which I added a couple drops of Liquid Smoke into.    half was used to marinate the salmon for a little over 2 hours, and other half I boiled in a sauce pan and used some to baste the salmon during the grilling and also serve with it as a dipping sauce.  The salmon turned out moist, delicious and I had no problems with sticking. My 5 year old liked it and my husband, who only likes his salmon blackened, said it was good and would like for me to make it again.  By the way, the next day I made a simple salad with the left over salmon, romaine, garlic croutons, tomatoes and a little Parmesan, and used the marinade as dressing - so good!

Awesome recipe, very easy.  Save some sauce for spooning (not dipping) on the salmon at the table.  Will definately make it again.

I'm a vegetarian, so when I made this dish for my bf I couldn't taste it and, instead, relied only on the ingredients and instructions listed.  He LOVED it!!  That makes it a winner in my book.  :)

Quick and easy AND very tasty.  I did not use liquid smoke, instead I substituted a little Chipotle Chili powder; still gave it a great smokey taste with a tiny tingle.  Instead of a whole salmon, I just used individual portions (cut and frozen from a fresh fillet).

It was excellent! I used agave nectar instead of honey and used some of the sauce for dipping.  I will definitely make it again soon.

Very Salmon!  I added more than a sprinkle of liquid smoke and baked it!  It turned out to be great!  Suggestion, before cooking add a little salt to give it an enhanced taste.

It didn't have much flavor and didn't really do anything for the salmon.

Didn't find it too sweet and like the dish. Increased the vinegar a little to cut down on the sweetness. Key is always to buy the best possible salmon.

Okay glaze.  WAY too much sauce as per the directions. Looks nice when it's done but hardly life changing flavor wise.  Recommend cooking without foil, flesh side down, gradual heat.  Flip onto skin side to finish - skin comes off nicely as you remove. Would wrap in foil to finish while you plate veggies etc.

I really didn't care for this. From all the good reviews I thought it would have tasted better. The apple cider vinegar really stood out and so did the brown sugar and honey, which, to me, gave it a sickly sweet and bitter taste. My boyfriend didn't like how it still had a strong fish flavor. My boyfriend and I followed the recipe exactly, and we both turned away. It could possible have potential, especially if you balance the ingredients A LOT better, but we probably wont try this again to find out. We ended up brushing the salmon with Sony's Sweet BBQ Sauce and it tasted a lot better.

I cooked this for my sister and I and we both enjoyed this dish.  I used a salmon filet and tilapia fillets since I had no beef or chicken thawed out and since I wanted a quick and easy dinner (I didn’t have enough of one type of fish to feed both of us either, so I had to mix and match).  The tilapia was okay with this sauce, but the salmon was better by far.  Also, since I don’t have a grill, I baked the fish for around 14 minutes.  I’m sure the salmon would be phenomenal when wrapped in foil and cooked on the grill.  I’ll be sure to give it a try whenever I acquire one.  :)

I made this recipe as-is.  The salmon was great but there as a tonne of glaze left over, and we had a fairly sizeable salmon fillet to cook.  I think I'd half the recipe next time.  Hubby said, "Let's do this one again." :0)

This is my family's favorite recipe for salmon. It converted my hubby who wasn't a fan of salmon prior to eating it like this. This glaze, plus method of cooking takes away that fishy taste of salmon that so many people don't care for. It's not overly powerful or sweet either. I just half or even quarter the recipe sometimes to fit the amount of fish I have. I use my George Foreman indoor grill with the lid up, following the grilling instructions to a T.

I love this recipe - it is so simple! It was my first time ever making Salmon and it came out perfect! I halved the recipe and grilled two appx 1/2lb mignons (instead of a whole fillet as there is just two of us) on tin foil as suggested.  I did not need to adjust the cooking time as the time detailed in the recipe did the trick!

Because I never have time to wait for the sauce to cool down, I started poaching the salmon in the hot sauce.  I coat a bread pan with non-stick spray, add the salmon (skinned side down and in filet portions), the freshly prepared sauce and bake at 325 for about 20 minutes, until just flaky.  Usually the recipe above is enough to cover three-four portions in the bread pan.  My kids love it this way and it is easier clean up than the grilling method.
