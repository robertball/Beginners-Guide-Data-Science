I made this last night but modified the recipe as follows: instead of tomato juice, I used diced tomatos with the juice; I did not use the sherry; I added 1 tsp basil and and 1 tsp oregano.  I mixed together a cup of Parmesan Cheese and 1/2 breadcrumbs and sprinkled it on top when the dish was finished.  It made a nice topping and added extra flavor.  It was delicious!

My husband took one look and said, "Oh, we're having Hamburger Helper." Not what I want to hear when I've made something from scratch. Unfortunately, it tasted like Hamburger Helper too. The sherry gave it a little bit of an odd flavor though.

Was looking for something to make when i was almost completely out of groceries. SO mine got made with 8oz of tomato paste and just the 1 cup of water needed to melt the bouillon cubes. I did have sherry but had to use celery seed, instead of celery salt and real mayonnaise instead of sour cream.....surprisingly it was quite good....texture was nice and thik and the whole family gobbled it down...Dont get me wrong, i wouldnt fix it for company but it was very nice alternative for low grocery day.

This is a great tasting and easy weekday meal.  I did use V8, and added in extra Worcestshire sauce, but I didn't use the sherry.  I also eliminated the water and replaced it with more beef stock.  For those who like to cut back on the fat, make sure to drain the meat before adding in the rest of the ingredients because this isn't noted in the directions.  This is a favorite at my house and I have made it again and again. There are never any leftovers.

This is a wonderful dish for a busy night and the whole family enjoys it.  It was a bit watery, but still quite tasty.  I am making it for the second time tonight and am going to go a little heavier on the stock and sherry to give it more flavor.

I love all the comments about Hamburger Helper.  Where did you think Hamburger Helper came from?  Serious generation gap thing here, lol!  I can still hear my mother saying she wasn't going to pay good money for that boxed stuff when she could make better hamburger skillet herself.  That said, I really liked this.  I did make a couple of changes. I added 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and used V8 because that's what I had in the house; no tomato juice.  I also had no sherry, and didn't substitute anything. Oh, and I used butter not margerine. I'm looking forward to making it as written next time when I have the right ingredients.

I had mixed reviews from the family. Husband was so-so, kids didn't like it, but I loved it! However, I found it to be very soupy. Maybe I did something wrong but I would probably cut out the water and/or add some more pasta. I just saved the extra sauce for another time. I also put some grated Romano on top - delicious! Since I had roast beef on hand, I used that instead of ground beef and I would do that again. Not sure I would like it with hamburger. Anyway - it was very good.

My family liked this and I followed the recipe to a t. There was a little too much liquid so I would leave out a little water as others suggested. Was a fast and easy meal.

I've never tried Hamburger Helper, so I can't comment on that. However, I just got up from the table after trying this recipe and it was simply delicious. As recommended below, I didn't use water, but used a total of 2 cups of tomato juice and 2 cups of beef broth (didn't have any beef stock handy). I think that using the water would dilute the wonderful blend of flavors. We don't do celery, so I didn't put in the celery salt, but added 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon garlic granules. Also, I used ziti for the pasta (that's what I had on hand) and it was done in about 25 minutes. The sour cream and sherry at the end gave it a very smooth and sophisticated flavor and the parsley adds a little freshness. With those changes, this becomes a 5-star rated quickie dish. This one goes into the ranch's cooking binders! Thanks!

This was a huge hit with my family!  My 14 year old son absolutely loved it.  I used V-8 juice instead of tomato and lowfat sour cream.  Will definately make it again and again.

My husband & I thought this dish was REALLY GREAT! We put ours in bread bowls and that was good. I also used 2 cups of pasta, and less parsley, only 1/2 cup. YUMMY!

It definitely needs alot of tweaking.  Followed some of the others advice and omitted water but increased beef broth to 2 cups and added garlic powder, basil, oregano and salt.

I rarely stick to a recipe exactly but I do with this one.  I make it a lot during the cold fall and winter months and it's never failed to please.  Tonight we had it with a side caesar salad and a couple glasses of red wine. It's a household favorite.  Thank you!

I really loved this! I made slight changes based on reviews; I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of tomato juice. I used 2c beef broth instead of water. I used 1tbsp worcestershire; 1/4c wine; added basil & oregano. Just about everything else the same as written - and I did top with Parmesan & bread crumbs.  It was rather unique and delicious - thanks!!

The only ones in my house that liked this were the dogs. I found it to be very bland, even after adding some garlic to try and kick up some flavor. For all the comments about Hamburger Helper, I would prefer the box stuff to this. I did however find that the noodles came out perfectly cooked, and had wonderful texture to them. Just too bland of a dish for our liking. I won't be making this again.

My husband and son loved this.  I modified a bit by substituting the tomato juice with one can of Italian stewed tomatoes undrained, omitted the sherry and water and instead increased beef broth to 1 1/2 C.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used a mix of parmesan cheese  and italian bread crumbs over top at finish. Good and hearty for a cool fall night!  (and no leftovers due to them cleaning their plates more than once). I made this for only three and would definitely use more hamburger or even double to whole recipe to feed more than three...

There are endless ways this recipe could be adapted to suit individual tastes. There was way too much liquid - I would cut out a cup of water. And with the fat from the beef, there's no need for the margarine.

Everyone packed this for lunch the next day! Some suggestions from others: Drain meat before mixing in the sauce. Use beef broth instead of water. Double worchestire sauce. Add some oregano and garlic salt.

I don't measure...so mine was a little fluid, so I just simmered longer to thicken.  Nice last-minute, low- on-groceries meal.  And yeah...kinda Hamburger Helper-like.

this was pretty good for what it was.  i used more tomato juice and beef stock  instead of the water and i garlic salted and cajun seasoned it pretty well.  it  was better than hamburger helper which is what most of the reviews compare it to.

So I've already reviewed this once.  Just wanted to say that I add two carrots, two zucchinis, and a red pepper (all diced) to my mince.  An easy way to get kids (and my husband) to eat veggies.

It was as described - hearty. It was a good simple dish that was a hit with my husband and kids. I did beef up the tomato flavour which I think helped.

This was ok.  My husband nailed it when he said it tasted like Hamburger Helper.  It was decent and I'm glad I tried it- but I wouldn't go out of my way to make again.

I was skeptical, but it turned out really well. I did make a few changes though because of others' complaints about blandness.  I didn't use any water--all beef stock instead.  I also used more worcestershire sauce and added salt and pepper.  To up the nutritional content, I used about half the pasta and added 1/2 cup pearl barley, and no sherry.  It was really good and homey tasting.

I had no tomato sauce so used ketchup. That made it a little sweet but still good. Next time.

This was pretty good, with a few modifications. Like several other reviewers, I used a can of diced tomatoes with the juice instead of plain tomato juice, ditched the water for a bit extra beef stock, and didn't use sherry. I added a bit of garlic salt to the meat and onions while they were cooking (and also ditched the margarine, the grease was enough for the onions to cook in), and also made sure to drain the excess fat so it wouldn't get greasy later. I also left out the celery salt and pepper and instead added in some oregano, dill weed, and basil to the sauce mix, along with a bit extra worcestershire sauce. Like others, I initially had sauce that was still too watery after the sour cream was added, so I turned up the heat to boil some of the excess away (be sure to stir often if you try this, it will attempt to stick), and then turned it back down to low heat and let it thicken while I made a salad and some garlic rolls. By the time I was done with those (about 7-8 minutes) it had thickened nicely, with no excess watery sauce. I will most likely make this again.

My family thought this was great. After looking at other reviews I added about a tsp of garlic powder and after tasting it after adding the sour cream and sherry I added a tsp more of sherry. Thanks for the recipe PETEZOE

I really loved this! All I added to the recipe was a tsp each of basil and oregano. Another cook said it was basically hamburger helper, and maybe it's because I'm a college student, but I love it either way! Even fried up some zucchini with it and it was yum!

I first had this recipe when staying with a friend. I made a note of it so I could look it up (had to make sure it was THIS recipe!) and make it for my family. We love it. I've made it with some substitutions because I didn't have all the ingredients, and I've made it according to the directions (except I always use butter!). It's always turned out well. Sometimes I have a hard time getting my family to eat leftovers but I never have an issue with this recipe.

My family enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have tomato juice so I used 1 small can tomato sauce and 1-1/2 cans beef broth. I left out the water. At the end I added some of the Mexican blend cheese. An easy recipe on a busy night.  Thanks

My entire family enjoyed this quick and hearty meal and it was put on the "make again" list. I followed the recommendations of others and added 1 tsp cumin and one tsp celery seed. I used 1 1/2 cups beef stock and 1 1/2 cups V8 juice (no water) and did not have any issue with excess sauce. I used two chopped zucchinis instead of celery to sneak some healthy veggies in for my kids. Great tasting quick meal!

This was pretty good, but nothing super exciting. I'll make it again sometime, but I won't go out of my way.

Super easy to make!!  I cooked the pasta, browned the onions & hamburger & combined all ingrediants in my crock pot.  I added crushed saltines & parmesean, italian seasoning with a tsp. of melted butter to put on top.

An ok basic recipe for a homemade hamburger helper type dinner, but I found that I needed to do a LOT of doctoring up to the recipe.
I used a can of diced tomatoes for the tomato juice, ground turkey for the ground beef, whole wheat spiral noodles for the regular pasta, beef broth for the beef stock, 1 green pepper chopped instead of the celery stalk, light sour cream for regular sour cream, didn't add the sherry and added about 1 Tsp of cumin, season all, and 2 Tsp of garlic powder.  I also had to add about 1/2 Tbps of cornstarch in the last 10 mins of cooking because it looked way too watery.
I perfer and trust making my own versions (so I can control the fat and sodium better) of packaged meals like hamburger helper so this worked for me.  But if you want to save time I'd go for the packaged helper meal cause this recipe isn't anything special.

A good start for a great meal.  The original recipe is a bit soupy but I added some flour to make it heavier.  I also added red and yellow bell peppers and mushrooms and it turned out great.

Yuck! I thought this would be a nice filling meal for the family, but no one could choke down more than a few bites. We all filled up on bread instead!

flavor was ok, I added peas and carrots and added more beef stock instead of water, otherwise followed the recipe.  Nothing spectacular but for a quick weeknight meal this one will be made again.

I like anything you can make in one skillet and this was very easy to make. I used some ziti instead of rotini, which took longer to cook.  The sour cream and sherry are what really make this good. Next time I will double for more leftovers.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I used V-8 juice instead of reg. tomato juice and I used garlic powder and salt instead of celery salt.  Definately will put this on my regular recipe rotation!

It's good. I used 1 can diced tomato and 1 can beef broth instead of water. I didn't have celery salt, parsley and sherry so I didn't use them. I added 1 tsp oregano and 1 tsp basil to the mixture, and 2 cups of pasta. Not bad! Thank you for a simple yet tasty recipe.

I really liked the recipe, though I made a few changes. I cut out the margarine, water, parsley, sherry and sour cream. I substituted the tomato juice for a can of diced tomato's, onions and green peppers (capsicum). 1/2 cup of beef stock for 1 and 1/2 cups of vegetable stock. 1/2 cup of pasta for 2 cups of pasta.
My husband really liked it and said that it was one of the best meals that I've made to date. I really enjoyed the meal too : )

I tried all the suggestions to boost the flavor of this dish, but it just didn't work for me.  I even added tomato sauce instead of tomato juice.  Way too bland for us.

This was really good and flavorful, but as soon as it was finished, I realized that I just made homemade hamburger helper.
