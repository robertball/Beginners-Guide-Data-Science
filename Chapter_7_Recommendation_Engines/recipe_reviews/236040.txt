These would be great for a brunch or even for a breakfast on the go.  The bake time is a little long and I would suggest adding salt and pepper to the egg mixture.  I use center cut bacon and instead of microwaving it I partially cooked it in a skillet, crisping up just one side.  The bacon was still flexible and just the right length to circle the muffin tins.  I put just a little of the filling into each cup and baked for about 4 minutes so the top of the egg was just starting to set and then added the remaining toppings - this way they didn't all sink to the bottom.  At 15 minutes they were puffed and set.  I turned off the oven, topped with a little cheese and just left them in the off oven to melt the cheese.  They came out of the muffin pans very easily and clean up was minimal.  Easy to customize to use whatever you have and like.  Green onions would be a great addition.  Thanks for a great breakfast.

I have been making these for a while now. I lov that they are so versatile. Differences though: I put the bacon on a baker's rack on a cookie sheet and bake them at 400 for about ten minutes. Once cooled and blotted I line the muffin tins. We have topped the eggs with tomato, feta, cheddar, onion, pepperoncini, hashed browns, sausage... anything you can think of! The whole family loves them.

Very versatile my kids are a little picky so was able to customize each muffin between peppers and what not using swiss cheese on a couple as well . Did season my eggs with salt, pepper and old bay before adding and also used an extra half slice of bacon on the bottom (did the skillet method as well). Agree on the bake time is a little long so need to watch in latter stages but mine came out fluffy and kids gave a thumbs up.

Comment on the bacon issue. You can use the pre-cooked bacon that Costco sells.  I use this bacon for many recipes that bacon can be used. These would save time; you wouldn't have to worry about under cooked bacon or cooking it first.  Some of the toppings can be added to the pre cooked egg mixture like an omelet saving time again.

I love the versatility of this recipe.  To resolve all issues with the bacon, I use pancetta to line the muffin tins.  No need to prepare them first like the bacon and the muffins pop right out of their cups.  It is delicious.  I make these on the weekends and carry them to work for lunch/brunch.

This recipe was good, although the bacon was not cooked as well done as my family likes. I like that you can change the recipe and add different ingredients as to what your own family likes.

Unsure if I would make these again, they stuck to the pan and were alittle too greasy. Found the bacon was not cooked enough. However overall did taste good.

Delicious! Super easy to make and super easy to alter to whatever your preferences are. I used feta and roasted peppers on some and others with cheddar and chives. I did cook the bacon a bit before lining the baking tin but only because I prefer my bacon extra crispy. That extra step was well worth it in the long run but certainly not necessary.

I followed the suggestions of others and cooked the bacon in the oven at 400 for about 10 mins first.  I decided to use 12 eggs instead of 10 and ended up with an eggy mess on my muffin pan - stick to the recipe for # of eggs!!  That being said, hubby loves these although I found them a little salty for my taste, will cut the salt in half for the next batch.

Delicious! Will definitely make this again! I didn't have any veggies on hand so i added garlic powder,  onion powder,  season salt, pepper, and small amount of mozzarella to the egg mixture instead. Turned out great!

I bake bacon and freeze it so when I need bacon I pull out the slices I need, microwave to heat up & it's very pliable. This recipe is great as written. You could also crumble bacon and add with other ingredients. Good job cbauer10!

These were wonderful.  So simple and perfect for Sunday brunch.  I used turkey bacon and microwaved it for about 1:30-2:00 minutes before lining the muffin tins, and when mixing the eggs and milk I just threw everything in with them (salt, pepper, shredded cheddar, chopped onions and chopped parsley).  I baked as instructed for 20 minutes and they came out perfect.  The bacon was just right, the eggs were light and moist and fluffy but cooked all the way through, the mix-ins were incorporated perfectly.  Wouldn't change a thing.  Excellent recipe.  Thank you so much for a lovely new way to prepare breakfast!

Next time I will try the ingredients listed. Because bridal party had special dietary needs I used turkey bacon, beat 10 eggs with heavy whipping cream, sautéed onions in butter with thyme and margerum to spoon into eggs, tore 3 leaves of fresh spinache and stuck inside center, sprinkled grated Swiss ontop.

I baked the bacon for 10 minutes, then laid it around the edge of muffin pan. On top of that a slice of deli ham was placed into cup thus creating a cup for the egg mixture. Worked nicely. Filled with onion, jalapeño, and mushrooms and Parmesan cheese. Topped with Cheddar.

These were really popular at a Christmas Eve brunch. Will make again for sure. Because I didn't read the instructions as carefully as I should have (hey, I'm a guy!), I included all of the ingredients in all of the muffins. But they were really good and they disappeared off the plate at the brunch.

Made this on Fathers Day, but left out the jalapeño and roasted red pepper, since I have finicky eaters that don't like spicy. HUGE HIT with the family. Will make this one of my go-to special breakfast recipes. Super easy to make too. Next time I'll make 1/2 of them with the jalapeño and red pepper, the other 1/2 without.

Great recipe, but consider skipping any more salt as there's probably enough in the bacon and cheese. Made this recipe with only 8 eggs and still had extra I couldn't fill into the muffin cups.

Added salsa to the eggs instead of the other? ingredients. Bacon was very salty so omitted salt and pepper. Sharp white cheddar on top, excellent!

I made a few slight changes. I diced a ham steak and put it on bottom of each cup, added shredded old cheese and finely chopped spring onions. Topped with egg mix. Very tasty!

This was a great hit. I made this using thick cut bacon that I cooked for about 10-15 mins before adding the other ingredients. I cut the bacon in half so I had more pieces. I layed then in the bottom so that a little was sticking above the eggs which helped picking them out of the pan.  

I did I leave out the cheese because we are gluten free and dairy free.  Leaving out the cheese did not take away from the overall aspect of the muffin. 

I added spinach and a little sautéed onions. 

I will make it again.  The kids requested a little more crisp to the bacon next time, but the bacon was cooked through.

Turned out great! NOTE: Put another baking pan underneath the muffin cup pan, the eggs will rise and spill over into bottom of oven if you do not.  I added diced red onion, red pepper and baby spinach to these and they are fantastic. This increased the cook time by approx 10-15min but it is worth the wait. All happy belly's!

This is similar to a breakfast casserole I make, but I love the individual servings! I mixed all my ingredients together before placing them in the muffin pan and after they were done, placed them in a zip lock bag. Now all I have to do is pop 1 or 2 in the microwave with a little added cheese on top, heat em up and then I add sour cream on top of that! YUM!!!

4 stars because the bacon was not cooked well at all.  I will def have to fry it in the skillet 1st next time before adding it to the muffin tin. I used a Jumbo 6 muffin tin, used 8 eggs (cause my mixing bowl was just a regular bowl and it was  getting full to spilling over) and the rest of the recipe was exactly as called for.  However I added all the ingredients to the mixing bowl (except the cheese) and ladled it into muffin tin and it filled them perfectly.  Cooked for 20 mins, added the cheddar cheese and put back in the oven for 5 min's.  They were a lil greasy, but real good (minus the bacon part)

I made these for my family but did not eat because I am vegetarian. They liked them a lot but it was a lot of time because I cooked the bacon first. They liked these and had no complaints but I will probably just make scrambled eggs next time.

This was awesome. AND easy. I followed the recipe with egg and milk quantities. I cooked the bacon in the oven as others did - at 400 for 10 minutes. I added other omelet items - tomato, leftover bacon, jalapeno and green pepper right in the egg mixture. Great recipe!

This is a great idea. I used yellow and red peppers with a little onion. The bacon I grabbed unfortunately was thin cut (didn't realize it) but the next time I definitely will make sure I use the thicker kind. I was going to freeze some of these for a quick breafast but I can't stop eating them.  Thanks for the great idea.

Very tasty.  Used regular red pepper instead of roasted (because that is what I had) and no jalapeno, because did not have any at the moment.  Added the onion and red pepper directly to the egg mix and it was delicious.  Loved it.  Will definitely make this again. Oh yes, I precooked the bacon as others had suggested and I was glad that I did this.

Great recipe!  Added chopped up spinach to the egg mixture and diced tomatoes on top.  Will cook bacon a little longer first as other reviewers have suggested.  Thanks so much for this one!  Definitely a keeper !!!

I think that this recipe tasted great! I'm in a culinary class at school and I had to make this for my final project. One thing that I changed was not use the different types of peppers because I did not like them all. I think that it took a little longer then what the recipe called but overall, the taste was yummy.
