I have been making a similar recipe for years called Angel Food Delight.  I only make it about 4 hours in advance but it is also just as good made at the last minute. I use store bought angel food cake, chocolate fudge sauce, 8 oz. thawed whipped topping, [mix the sauce and whipped topping together in a bowl] and any crunchy candy Plus peanut M&Ms. I put the candy into a baggie and smash it into bits with a jar [spagetti sauce or whatever]. In a seperate baggie I add any nuts I have around, usually almonds, and smash those up or use my nut chopper. I split the cake horizontally in 3 layers, frost with topping mix & candy between layers, frost the sides, inside, & top, crumble candy over all. Last crumble chopped nuts over all.  I have never failed with this dessert, it's always a Big Hit.

I hollowed out my angel food cake and added SKOR toffee bits and mini chocolate chips to the whipped cream. I frosted the top with remaining whipped cream and added crushed Skor candy bars to the top. YUMMY!!!

i give it a 2.5 but my friends gave it a 4.5 so i'm averaging with the 3! it was a little bit boring for me, although the filling/icing was yummy.  my friends thought it was very wonderful, and that was most important!  i made it about 20 hours before i needed to serve it so the flavors could blend, but i don't think it tasted much different than it did last night.  it was VERY sweet.  i used 6 heath bars and fat free cool whip, and store bought angel food cake.

What a bit of nostalgia this is and how pleasant to bump into this dessert that I would have otherwise forgotten about! This is so reminiscent of the kinds of dessert recipes that made the rounds during the '70s (like Pistachio Cake, Cream Cheese Crescent Squares, layered pudding and cream cheese "tortes,"  Banana Split Cake, etc. - I've got a million of 'em!).  I haven't made this in ages but I relied upon this quick, sweet treat many times during those years and it was a hit everywhere it went! I can still picture it and still "taste" it in my mind!  Don't be put off by its simplicity - this is delicious and angelic looking, like a fluffy cloud, and can almost be forgiven for its use of Cool Whip,  which also was all the rage in the '70s!  It IS possible to have a beautiful and delicious dessert that's bound to please everybody in just a matter of minutes!

Very good! I made three desserts for a large family get-together and this one was gone first. Got asked for the recipe as well so that's always a good sign. Really simple to make and impressed everyone. Would make this one again.
