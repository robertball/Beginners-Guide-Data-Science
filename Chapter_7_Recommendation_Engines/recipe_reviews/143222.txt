This was yummy. I used focaccia bread and swiss cheese  instead and added some sundried tomatoes. Thanks for this recipe!

Didn't think any of these flavors tasted good together. Won't try this again. Came out too moist from the water in the mushroom and the olives were just not  good at all with mushroom.

This was pretty good but I didn't like the olives on it, next time I will leave them off.

I enjoyed this sandwich, it was more filling then I expected and I enjoyed the textures. If you like olives or rye bread, this would be worth it to try
