I think this was just okay. I had half of a watermelon in the fridge and this was a simple enough salad to make for lunch.  I made this subbing 1/2 packet of Stevia for the Sweet 'n Low.  I followed the rest of the recipe, as listed, reducing by one half.  I think next time I will try the salad with less balsamic vinegar, or by subbing apple cider vinegar.   I had to add quite a bit of salt to my serving to enhance the flavor.  Overall, it was a refreshing change from the usual tomato-cucumber-onion salad.

This is very good. The flavors are spot on. Just make sure you use a good quality balsamic that isn't too old!! I have added a few fresh herbs from my garden on occasion for a different twist. Either way, a lovely way to bring some fresh juicy flavors to any meal of the day!
