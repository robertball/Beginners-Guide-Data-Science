The first time we made this it was pretty good, but subsequent times, we did not like it.  My husband and I LOVE mole, but this recipe just doesn't cut it.  We will have to keep looking for a winner.  A big plus though is how quick this recipe is.

!Que bueno!   My husband is a huge fan of mole.  I've tried several recipes, but none were a hit with him or compared with restaurant moles.  He LOVES this recipe. The only changes I would make next time would be to cut the amount of almonds in half and 1 less TBS of chili pepper flakes.  I baked the chicken with the sauce (instead of doing it in the microwave) and served it over sticky white rice.
This is a huge time saver from the recipes that take hours to prepare...and we like the taste of this one MUCH better.
Thank you!!

I simmered the sauce on the stove and sliced the chicken and fried it till just cooked. Turned out very well. Not exactly the strong chocolate mole I love from Mexico, but close, and much faster. Satisfied my craving for mole that night, and all ingredients were on hand in the pantry.

No matter what recipe I come across, theres always going to be a missing ingredient. I didn't have bay leaves, ground cloves,chicken broth,anise seed,dried red chile pepper, sesame seeds, slivered almonds,Mexican chocolate nor white bread, and so I had to improvise with the stuff I did have: soup base, water, chile powder: varies how hot you want it, 2 t. sesame seed oil, 6 to 8 whole cloves, and 50g semi sweet chocolate, and 1 T. chili flakes,3 sugar cubes, and salt, and remaining ingredients listed for this recipe. I cooked it on a stove in a good size pan. I made it for my hasband and he loves it so much I made it the following day. Thank You for this recipe.

I did not like this recipe. I like thin saucy mole and this is chunky and thick. It tasted like a mash of different flavors and never united for me.

this was nice. My first time to make mole. It was a little too spicy (hot) and I'm not afraid of heat,next time i'll just keep adding slowly till a get a heat I can handle.I also added 2 TBS more chocolate ( I used hershey's baking choc.It's not the same but I had no options).In our home we added a little peanut butter. Gives it a nice taste and is soposed to bring the heat down. I just like the over all flavor it gives. Thanks for posting.

I decided to make this recipe in a saucepan rather than the microwave, mostly because my casserole dish is too large to fit in my microwave. I changed the proportions of some of the ingredients, as well. I added extra tomato sauce, and doubled most of the recipe (made for 7 people rather than 4). It was my first attempt at a mole sauce, so overall I am very pleased. Thanks for the recipe!

I just needed the sauce part. I don't care for mole but made it for family. I liked that I could update spices (add cumin seed, a few spoons of Verdi sauce, 3 cubes sugar, sans  almond & reduced chocolate. I had chipotle peppers in fridge, along with a few drips & drops of Sirracha. I took advice from other reviews and finished with a sauce that even I enjoyed.  Served over tamales.
