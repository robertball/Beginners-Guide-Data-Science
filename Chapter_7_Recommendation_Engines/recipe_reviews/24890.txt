I've been making this dressing at home for about 1.5 years and it is the best Bleu Cheese dressing I have ever had. I don't even like getting Bleu Cheese dressing at restaurants anymore because most are such a disappointment compared to this recipe.  If you use the recipe exactly as listed you get a very thick, almost dip-like, consistency which is very good on both salads and as a vegetable dip.  If you like your dressing a little thinner, just add some milk and mix well.  The dressing is alway more thin-like when first made but thickens up as it sits in the refrigerator.  This is the most beloved recipe I have found on Allrecipes.com.

This dressing got several comments at our Thanksgiving dinner.  I used 8 oz. of blue cheese instead of the 6 oz. called for.  The consistency was a little thick, so next time I make this I will probably add a little milk.  A fabulous Roquefort dressing however, one of the best I've ever had.

very good.  However will you people stop calling it blue cheese.  This is sheep milk roquefort!  Blue cheese in the USA is cows milk cheese...NOT THE SAME THING.  Thanks to the Cheese Wars with France most of us were bereft of Roquefort Cheese for many years.  Someone thought that they could switch to blue cheese. This dressing proves that you cannot. It is true Roquefort dressing that I grew up with.  Good show.

This dressing is exactly what I was looking for.  I added a tablespoon of Worcester sauce  and lemon juice because I tend to like my dressing a bit on the tangy side. Also if you are in a pinch and don't have time to refrigerate to allow time for the flavors to meld, simply add the dressing into the blender and add some Roquefort/blue cheese and blend away, then you can also add more crumbles and whisk to desired chunkiness.  This adds the cheese flavor immediately that you would otherwise get with time in the fridge.

I was SO happy to find my beloved ROQUEFORT dressing recipe!!! There is a BIG difference between ROQUEFORT and Bleu cheese! They are NOT the same. Bleu cheese is cheaper than Roquefort (if you can believe that!) As far as I know, this is why most restaurants stopped making the REAL Roquefort. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Roquefort, and really miss it. This is a wonderful recipe! THANK YOU SO MUCH Rumba. Now I can have my Roquefort and eat it too!!! :)

This was very good but did not outdo my favorite.  I only added about 4 oz of bleu cheese.  The 6 oz would of been way too strong for me.  This was too thick - I had to add about 1/4 C buttermilk to get the consistancy I wanted. Thanks for the recipe Rumba.

Very good!  My first try at making home-made blue cheese dressing, and it makes me wish I'd made up a batch of hot wings to go with them!  As another reviewer mentioned, it is more dip like - so for what I used on my salad I just thinned out a bit with milk.  I used low-fat mayo and light sour cream, and my container of blue cheese (not roquefort, just regular blue cheese) was only 4 oz.   It was perfect for me, but I know others probably prefer it cheesier.  Thanks for sharing!!!!

Very good recipe.  I used white wine vinegar instead of plain white and I reduced the amount of cheese to 4 oz.  It was still a little thick so I added a little milk.  Served this with Thanksgiving dinner and everyone seemed to like it.

This recipe is great. I used blue cheese (I didn't look up the recipe until after I bought the cheese)and left out the salt and celery salt.  It was still great - just fyi for those on a low sodium diet.

This recipe deserves 10 stars! Excellent taste and so easy to make!  I didn't have Roquefort, so I just used regular blue cheese and it was delish! Was a little thick for my preference so I added a tbsp of milk. I like to spread a tsp of this dressing on my hamburger - YUM!

This was awesome.  I love Roquefort and needed a dip to replace the nasty stuff that came with a big vegetable platter.  Have been using it on sandwiches and salads since.

Very good! I did not find this too thick at all, in fact, mine was a bit on the thin side, not sure why, but it was still good. Easy and flavorful...a keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is outstanding! I probably shouldn't rate it (according to the purists) because I had to substitute based on what I had on hand, but regardless, the result was exceptional and got raves. I used white wine vinegar because I was out of regular (used it all for cleaning,) used kosher salt because I didn't have any celery salt and used Gorgonzola because I couldn't find Roquefort at my grocery store in the amount of time I was willing to spend looking. I am as excited as it's possible to get about a dressing with this one!

Loved it! I made it using sheep's milk Roquefort and goat's milk yogurt instead of sour cream and it turned out perfectly!  I also used a white balsamic vinegar this time... I think next time I want to try using champagne vinegar instead.  I suspect it should go really well with the other flavors.

Outstanding! Creamy, funky, and deliciously salty - exactly what you would expect. Made as written. Next time I might add just a hint of dill, but it certainly doesn't need any tweaking.  So simple and straightforward.

After searching several stores to find Roquefort cheese, I made this dressing as a gift for a friend who kept talking about Roquefort dressing and how she couldn’t find any anywhere. She loved it!! Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Oh my, does this take me back! This was my father's favorite dressing, and mine as well.  Tastes like the Roquefort dressing made at the "Red Eagle" in Oklahoma City - back in the day! What a memory - will be making this again!!

The first time I made this I used the white vinegar and did not care for it (I never use vinegar in dressings of any kind) but the second time I tried apple cider vinegar and liked it better.  However, since I really prefer it without the vinegar, I make it without any vinegar and like it better.  

As many reviewers have stated, ROQUERFORT AND BLUE/BLEU CHEESE ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT CHEESES.  If you are calling blue cheese Roquefort, you may as well call Gorgonzola cheese Roquefort!    Both have blue veins and both blue cheese and Gorgonzola are made from cow's milk.  Roquefort is only made in the Village of Roquefort, France and is made from sheep's milk.  

Thanks for the recipe.  It is (minus the vinegar) exactly the way my mother made Roquefort when I was growing up and the way I have made it for the past 50 years.

I absolutely loved how this turned out... i substituted one pint of sour cream for 1 cup of sour cream and 3/4 cup of mayonnaise instead of 1/2 cup and then added 1/4 of a cup of buttermilk to equal out the original pint size  sour cream

Use good Roquefort cheese.  Mmmm!  Pure deliciousness.  Takes me back to my grandma making this for family meals.
