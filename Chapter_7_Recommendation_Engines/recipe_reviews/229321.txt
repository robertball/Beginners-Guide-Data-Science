I hate when people change the recipe but I'm going to be one of those people because I used what I had in my pantry and fridge. I used full fat everything, subbed swiss cheese and used fried onions ( the kind in the can) to top. Used the basic recipe to make. Very good! Had leftover chicken to use up and this was a great jumping off recipe. Thanks so much, hubby says thanks too!

This was the best chicken and mushroom casserole i have made so far, but i made a few changes. I doubled the recipe, but did not double the amount of chicken (i don't like a lot of meat in casseroles personally),  did not double the cheese or croutons either to save on calories. I used cream of mushroom soup because the fat free version is sold in the big cans, which are much cheaper than the small cans, but they did not sell the fat free cream of chicken soup in the big cans. I used a combination of low fat sharp cheddar, low fat smoked gouda and 2% milk Velveeta cheeses instead of cheddar cheese to save on calories. I think you could use pretty much any cheese you have on hand or skip the cheese altogether and it would still be great. I mixed a half cup of the cheese mixture into the casserole and sprinkled a half cup on top with about a quarter cup of seasoned croutons i smashed with a rolling pin in a Ziploc bag. I also replaced a little less than half a cup of chicken broth with white wine which added a wonderful flavour, and i halved the seasoned salt and added maybe half a teaspoon to a teaspoon of old bay seasoning. I also used  brown rice  because it's healthier and caramelized a couple cloves of garlic with the onion and mushrooms.  It turned out amazingly!  I'll definitely be  making this again!

I made this and the kids loved it.  My son already declared that he wanted it for his birthday dinner.  That's how good it was.  I modified it a bit by using farro instead of rice and cream of mushroom soup.  I have never had my kids go so crazy over anything I've made before.

Hi Everyone - I'm the original submitter.  I just want to add a note on the seasoned salt as I don't use a tablespoon in my own recipe either.   That was one of several little tweaks Allrecipes made before publishing.   My own recipe calls for a much more conservative TEAspoon of seasoned salt.  Thanks!

Great recipe!  I always like to add something green to a casserole, slip in a veggie, so this time had green peas on the shelf.  Delicious.  Next time will try with broccali or asparagus.  Everything else I followed as written.

Thought it was a great casserole! I had to use more liquid in the rice, but it turned out nicely. I also substituted 'Top The Tator' for the sour cream. It added an extra little kick.

I changed this recipe up a bit. I made homemade cream of celery soup, and by doing this I didn't need to add the milk or the 1/2 of chicken broth because the cream of celery had enough liquid. So I did Greek yogurt in place of sour cream and the homemade cream of celery mixed with the rice and chicken and I also added a bag of frozen broccoli and then I added all the seasonings that I prefer. I also added more cheese than instructed and baked at 375 instead of 350, as it got done better this way. Great recipe!

So good. I made a few changes based on what i had on hand, first i used one small can of mushrooms and added some minced garlic,(cooked in butter not olive oil.) also i left out the cheese and croutons simply because i did not have any and i forgot to put in the season salt. My super pickey daughter loved it (after i picked out the big chuncks of mushrooms.) My husband also liked it, we both felt however that in need a little spice. (due to the season salt) We just added a little hot sauce to our portion and it was perfect. I don't think it needed the cheese or the crutons.  I will making this again.

Really delicious. Have been looking for a good chicken casserole recipe. I found this one and gave it a shot. I increased the amount of rice, chicken, cream of chicken soup and sour cream due to the amount of people in my family. Thought the dish might wind up being too liquidy or rich, but it wasn't. The liquids do cook out to help solidify the casserole. It also did not taste overly rich. The cheese and crushed croutons on top are a very nice touch. Would highly recommend this to anyone who likes chicken and rice. If you have a picky eater who you don't think will like the other ingredients, don't worry. The veggies and creams blend in with the taste very well.

I used all full calorie versions of the soups - doubled the recipe and cooked my chicken in a little olive oil and then added the onions.  I also only had Chicken with Herbs soup on hand so i used that - also Cream of Mushroom, as I doubled the recipe and put in a 9x13 pan.  I used some extra seasonings that I keep on hand.  My family liked it.  Don't let the photo scare you - it tastes a lot better than that photo looks

Comfort food!  Made it exactly as recipe calls....was very good!  I plan on adding this to a regular quick meal!  With minute rice, it only took me about 30 minutes to throw it together.  I used left over chicken to speed things up as well.

My family loved this recipe...after a couple of rescues. First, the recipe does not call for enough liquid for the rice to become tender, after it obsorbed the 1 1/4 c of liquid I added another 3/4 cup. Second, the amount of seasoning salt seemed high so I used half. They loved it and for the first time in a long time all the leftovers were eaten!

I made two individual casseroles for hubs and me. I did away with the cream of chicken soup,simply because I hate cream of soup in a can. I added 1/2 brick of cream cheese,1/3 cup of hot water with 1/2 teaspoon of chicken flavor Better than Boulion as a replacement. Full fat ingredients for the rest
and replaced my casserole with califlower rice,and used brown rice for hubs casserole. I used crushed salad croutons for the topping,for his and for mine left it out. Comfort food at its best!

The question was - what can I make with the left over barbequed chicken?  Tired of chicken pot pie so tried this.  It was excellent and super easy to make.  I did not have the fat free soup so used what I had.  Will try the fat free next time.

Really good! We loved it! The only thing I will change next time is a lot less seasoning salt. I will use 1/2 a tablespoon instead of a whole one. It was perfect comfort food just a little too salty.

I changed it based on reviews, or i would give it 5 stars. 
I used brown rice with some seasoned chicken broth. 
Subbed carrots for the mushrooms. 
Added a packet of lipton onion soup mix. 
Topped with Frenchs onions instead of croutons. 
So good, the husband asked me to print it out for the recipe book!

This was the only recipe for chicken and rice that was spot on. I modified it just a tiny bit by adding some celery and Mc Cormick chicken seasoning and topped it with quarters of biscuits in a can. Very good and tasty.

Yum! I made without mushrooms since my son doesn't like them and it was still great. I utilized rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and my rice cooker for the rice and it was wonderful. Great comfort food with good flavor.

As someone who looks for meals to make for myself I was itching to try a new casserole, this fit the bill. The amount of work is a little daunting but the results speak for themselves!
WORD OF WARNING:
Don't use a full tablespoon of salt, you'd be insane to want to do that. I used less than a full tablespoon and it was STILL so salty. Do not make this recipe with over half a tablespoon (1 1/2 teaspoons is more than enough, seriously)

I made this mostly the way the receipe stated except I only added  1tsp of seasoning salt, I sauted in butter instead of olive oil, and I added a small can of chopped green chillies. The croutons really added to the taste and we loved the bit of crunch. It was great and my husband loved it too. Yum!

I added noodles to it as my husband loves them in things like this. I also used yogurt in place of sour cream. Next time I will cut down on the rice and use more noodles. I put fried onions on top of the cheese; which can be cut to a 1/2 cup.

This creamy chicken rice casserole hit the spot especially during the cold spell we had this week. I couldn’t keep my husband out of it. This will definitely be a mainstay for our family.  File under comfort foods..

Loved it! I think I will reduce the seasoned salt next time. The rice to liquid ratio was a bit off, so I adjusted it using my rice cooking instructions.

Really tasty!! Left out the seasoning salt and the croutons on top. Used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken because that is what I had and was out of rice, so used quinoa instead! Will make again!! Thanks!

This was not a bad recipe, but not one I'll probably make again.  I thought it was a little bland and needed something extra that I couldn't put my finger on.  I also didn't love the sour cream, I would've rather doubled the cream of chicken soup.

We loved this!  My picky teenager asked for seconds and even for leftovers the next day!  That is worth a 1000 stars!  

I added fresh broccoli to the dish and served it with baby carrots.

Very good.  I used butter instead of olive oil and a whole cup of milk because I do not like this type of dish to be the least bit dry.  But it's very good.  Kids loved it and had enough for another night!

Huge success and my husband and nephew had seconds. I added fresh spinach with the mushrooms. This is a recipe that you can add things and it works out fine.

Really good! My husband is a chef and he liked it! I chunked the chicken as I don’t like the shredded texture. I also added garlic. Highly recommend seasoning and baking your own chicken to add to this recipe! I baked chicken breast and seasoned with rosemary garlic, lawreys, salt and pepper.

I’m eating it as I write this...YUMMY! I could have cravings for this. I was looking for something to do with leftover chicken, rice and broccoli, Voila! This was perfect and quick on a weeknight. Hubby and I finished the whole tray. It was a little runny, not sure why as I followed the recipe but it set up a little after sitting, didn’t matter anyway. Thank you, will definitely make again

I made this just as it said. I had prepared not to, but I had all the ingredients handy so it worked out. I may have used more mushrooms. Tasted good. My rice burned a bit on the bottom at that 20 minutes but I should have checked it before. Because of this, I used a little less rice than it stated. Still creamy and good. I would make it again.

This was delicious!  I doubled the recipe and baked in 9X13 dish.  I only had a couple of variations.  My husband does not like mushrooms so I had to sneak them in using a can of cream of mushroom along with cream of chicken.  I also added garlic in with onions to sauté.  For topping, I used leftover cheddar Chex mix and potato chip crumbs along with Colby jack shredded cheese mix.  It turned out great!

This casserole is delicious! It's very similar to something my mom made when I was a kid, but kicked up a notch. I did make some changes just based on what I had available....  used instant rice  (I did have to use .5 cup more than the recipe calls for),  evaporated milk instead of regular milk, I didn't top with cheese, and I didn't have any croutons so I crushed up some everything bagel Ritz crackers and it was DELICIOUS!  Highlighly reccomend. This is a good recipe which you can adjust to your liking, I bet it would be good with some veggies added as well.  I will be making again!

I will definitely make this one again! A hit with everyone in the house. I made a few changes to suit my family's tastes. First, I used full fat everything (eeks!), and used brown rice. I almost doubled the broth overall between the two stages, which was perfect. I used one TSP vs. 1 TBSP of seasoning salt as per other's suggestions. I topped with crushed crackers vs. croutons because that's what I had. I used broccoli instead of mushrooms due to preference. It was wonderful and faster than most casseroles to prepare.  I pulled this off on a weeknight without any advance prep. Thanks for the great recipe!

Definitely a keeper, kids and hubby loved it. Will be my new go to recipe for leftover chicken, so easy and usually have all ingredients on hand! Made it a second time but doubled recipe, did one can cream of chicken and one can cream of celery. Made a butter and cracker topping was amazing!

I have been making this recipe for over a year now with a few small variations based on personal preference. I sautéed the onions, left out the mushrooms, and used cream of mushroom soup. It’s a family favorite!

I am giving this a 3 star because my husband liked it!  Unfortunately, I could only eat a few bites! Will not make again!
I don't know if subbing coconut milk for the sour cream was the reason. We never have sour cream in the kitchen as I have a dairy allergy. So even the can soup could have been part of why I didn't like this casserole.

Super delicious!! We are gluten/dairy intolerant so used almond milk and used cashew cream cheese instead of sour cream, and added some cream of mushroom. Made it stove top (no cheese or croutons) came out spectacular..will definitely make again!!

Very good! I don’t care for mushrooms so they were omitted. I had instant rice so didn’t have to wait long for it to be done. Also used sea salt and crushed fried onions on top. Will definitely make again.

This casserole was soooooo warming after a very cold winter day! Thick and hearty! I used big, fresh, sliced mushrooms, and cut my onions a little chunky! I burned most of the rice, so there wasn’t much rice. Glad I kept the mushrooms and onions chunky for texture! Was delicious!!!!

Really great flavor. I doubled the recipe because we have teenagers in the house. I used gluten free toasted bread in place of the croutons and it was delicious. I put butter and all purpose seasoning on the toasted bread before I cut it up into little chunks. I will make this again.

For such a simple dish, this was surprisingly good. Used wild rice (what I had on hand) and skipped mushrooms due to picky kids but used mushroom soup. Added crispy onions on top as some recommended.

I love this recipe. Besides being a new family favorite, it’s been a great one to bring to any family who has someone in the hospital or is going through loss. We have brought it to so many families, my husband started calling it my “bereavement casserole.” My toddler grandsons eat it up for lunch when they are here too!

I’ve made this recipe many, many times and my family has always loved it. This is the first time I can remember it calling for a tablespoon of Lawry’s seasoned salt, and the only thing I can think of is the recipe owner was given an incentive to include that because it was way too much and the soul completely over powered the dish. My recommendation is to leave that out because without it this is a super yummy dish and is our family’s go to busy weekend / weekday night dinner

Well, like others I decided to use what I had - no cream soup, but I had most is a can of evaporated milk left from another recipe, so I subbed that in mixed with 1 T flour and 1 T butter. Kids ate it up and i didn’t hear any grumbling which is a major win at my house!

I made the recipe exactly as written except I made homemade croutons, used 1 1/2 C of broth for the rice, and used full fat everything (sour cream, soup, cheese). If a classic,comforting chicken casserole is what you're after, this is it. I served it with broccoli on the side and it was a great Sunday night meal.

So good! This recipe is on my go-to list now. For a little less work, I made rice in rice cooker with chicken broth and eye-balled how much to put into casserole. Also used 4oz can of mushrooms and waited to mix in after onions cooked. Can't imagine my changes affected recipe much. 5 stars :)

Left out croutons and garlic butter
Added garlic powder and a can of cream of mushroom soup. It was gone in a hurry.

Very good base for this casserole.  I sauteed onion, celery and garlic in butter, in a separate pan cooked 2 cubed chicken breasts with 1/4 tsp oregano, basil, onion salt and garlic powder and added to onion mixture, I also steamed broccoli and carrots and added to onion mixture as well. I used regular cream of chicken soup and sour cream, not fat free, omitted the seasoning salt because I didn't have any (but seasoning from chicken was great). Seemed runny to me, but the rice soaked up the access fluid during baking and texture was perfect. My husband really enjoyed this recipe, would be great with ham instead of chicken as well! The cheese and croutons were a perfect topping!

I made it and it was delicious.  I didn't put the cheese on top because that seemed superfluous.   I highly recommend it.  I appreciate the use of low fat ingredients since Im doing Weight Watchers.

I followed the recipe -almost-(I sautéed the mushrooms in a dried onion blend and olive oil which was delicious!). I was looking for a recipe I could make the night before and reheat. Just held off on putting cheese and croutons on it and heated it for 30 minutes until bubbling around the edges and THEN put the cheese and croutons on & baked for 10 more min. Easy recipe. Made for good leftovers too.

Soooo good and so easy! My picky daughter had 2 helpings! Nobody in my house like mushrooms so I omitted them.  I used 1.5 cups chicken broth and 1 cup minute rice.  It was done in 5 minutes.  I sautéed a tablespoon of minced garlic in with the onion fit about 5 minutes.  I used leftover grilled chicken and wanted to use it up.  I cubed 2 cups of chicken. Added rest of ingredients plus a handful of cheddar cheese.  I felt that for our taste it was a little too creamy so I threw in the pot 1/2 cup uncooked minute rice, hoping that the excess creaminess would cook the rice. You know what? It did!! It came out perfect!!  It was soooo good! Definitely on our rotation!

Very good.  My only recommendation is to use less seasoned salt.  This is a very salty dish.  You could at least cut it in half.  I did have to sub some things only because I didn't have what I needed.  Used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken soup.  Added broccoli just to have more veggies.  And I didn't have enough sour cream, so I also used some leftover ricotta cheese and fat free cream cheese.  It sounds like I changed a lot, but I didn't really.  Again, very good flavor and consistency.  I'd just use less salt.  Thanks for sharing!

This was a good Monday night dinner for our family.  I was rushed and screwed up a couple of things - didn't put chicken broth in the rice water,  and used cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken soup.  I did add the broth that was called for at the end, and put in a pod (?) of Knorr's Homestyle Chicken Stock to make up for it.  Also used full fat sour cream and half a bag of frozen peas instead of mushrooms (didn't have any).  Since I only had a few croutons left, I added an extra sprinkle of Italian bread crumbs.  This recipe seems pretty versatile and I'm sure you could substitute quite a few things and it would still be good!

I didn't have the Cr. of Chicken soup so I made my own using bouillon in my own white sauce.  I left off the cheese and didn't use the milk.  I thought it would make it too runny.  I used Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute and a bit of salt and it turned out great!  Oh and i didn't have mushrooms so I substituted slightly steamed broccoli that was cut very fine.   It was gooood!

Really enjoyed this casserole.  I left out the mushrooms, only because I don't like - used full fat version of everything except the cream of chicken soup.  I was very worried about so much seasoned salt, but it added great flavor and wasn't too salty.  It also sounded a bit bland, but it turned out to be very flavorful!  Thanks - got great reviews!!

Super easy and fantastic.  Followed recipe exactly (except I add a little turmeric (for health benefits) and I've made it twice now.  This recipe is very versatile. You could add peas, carrots, broccoli, asparagus, or any other variety of blanched, caramelized, or roasted vegetables for added health and taste benefits.

Made this a couple weeks ago when I was suffering from an upset stomach for several days and was looking for something that would have some protein but still be gentle on my stomach. This recipe definitely fits the bill! I used celery salt instead of seasoned salt and replaced the garlic croutons with buttermilk biscuits (from a tube), and it turned out tasty without causing further upset. It's definitely not as spicy as what I would normally make, but for sick-person food, it was a welcome respite from applesauce and pretzels!

This was much better than expected!  I used a whole Costco rotisserie chicken, a large can of cream of chicken soup, about 6 cups of leftover rice and left out the mushrooms.  Tasty and easy casserole.

Very yummy in my tummy! Kids loved it! 
I did not sub ingredients, but I did sub a process. I cooked my chicken in my casserole pan, used the drippings for the rice and did not clean out the pan. This way I didn't have to grease it.

A friend made this for us, and I asked for the recipe.  It made an ordinary Chicken and Rice Casserole taste great!  Will definitely make this!

Nice comfort recipe.  Needed to use up some chicken from a roasted chick and thought this sounded good.  It was!  No changes except for topping.  Used Italian bread crumbs moistened with a little melted butter.  Delish!

This is truly a comfort food.  I was looking for a dish to use my leftover rotisserie chicken and found this.  I pretty much kept to the recipe.  I didn't use any fat-free items, everything else was the same.  For the season salt, I used my Everglades Seasoning.  I will make again.  I think it would be great for a pot luck!

Made this doubled so I could share with a neighbor who was recovering from surgery. My husband loved it. I spiced it up a bit with a small can of mild green chilies & some garlic salt. Used about half of seasoning salt

We loved it. Definitely a keeper in the recipe box. I made it basically as written. I didn't have any mushrooms. Per a previous reviewer, I decreased the season salt by half and used old bay for the other half tablespoon. I also used full fat everything because that is what I had. This will be my new go to chicken casserole.

Quick and easy.  I was in a hurry and my local grocery had Purdue Short Cuts carved chicken breast on special.  I used 2 9oz packages of this in place of the shredded chicken.  I would also cut back a bit on the seasoned salt.  I sauteed the croutons in butter and garlic before topping the casserole with them.  After all I am a firm believer that there is no such thing as too much garlic!

At first when I saw what it looked like I thought yuk!!!But when I tasted it wow loved it!It said to shred the chicken well I cooked 3 chicken fillets and cut it thin.It said 1 cup sour cream-I used maybe 1/2 cup of it.For the croutons-I left it whole instead of crushing them.No matter how you did it -it turned out yummy alltogether.Oh yea for the broth-I mixed it with vegetable and beef broth as well as the chicken broth.Its a keeper!!!
