I made this Strawberry Pound Cake for a dinner party tonight. All the guest raved about it. I will make again. Also, may try other seasonal fruits. Thinking fresh cherries would also be good.

I followed this recipe as is. The cake itself is lovely. It’s dense and  mildly sweet. I love the flavor the cream cheese adds. I did have to bake it an additional 10 minutes to get it cooked through. The strawberries turned to mush in the cake. Which I expected baking strawberries in a dessert. I would try this again with the cake recipe base and substitute the strawberries for peaches or blueberries. I think one of those would hold up better in this type of cake.

I was looking for a “holiday” pound cake, so I adapted this one with 2 cups of chopped fresh cranberries.  I ended up cooking it for 75 minutes.  It still looked under-cooked after I sliced it, but upon tasting it that wasn’t the case.   It was very good, but  almost too dense.

Very easy. I used regular cream cheese. I did puree the berries so they were smooth with some chunks. I like weighing fruits and 14 ounces berries without the green stem gave me the 2 cups I used. So basically buy a pound and use the container minus any waste.

This was a fail for me. Made it exactly as the recipe said. The cake was very dense and texture weird. Will not make again.

The outside of the cake was done but the inside was uncooked batter. I currently have an electric stove and I have had gas stoves all of my life, this is my first time trying a cake in this stove. I will try it again tomorrow, if things dont work out I'm getting rid of this stove!

RIch and delicious!  Be careful not to overbake. Made according to the directions exactly and one hour in the oven was not quite enough from the toothpick test. Added an additional 6 mins.  My oven is old and probably not the best!  Made a glaze of 1/4 cup cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter (both very soft) and about 1 cup powdered sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Added a little milk to thin to the glaze consistency.   This is a good recipe! Will definitely make again.

The flavor was fantastic. I did muddle the strawberries which turned my cake pink which is fine but very different from the picture. Not sure if they were super juicy or what but I also had a very dense top to the bundt cake that almost looked uncooked despite a clean tester. I’m pretty sure that was me, though rather than the recipe. Maybe next time I will slice them as someone else suggested. I also used 1 cup of butter (the extra 2tsp seemed a bit silly) and full fat cream cheese (maybe that has something to do with things?) because believe it or not my store didn’t have non fat cream cheese.
