This came out quite runny for me. It would be too runny to use for a dip even after I added a full pound of cocktail shrimp from the seafood counter. Maybe it depends on the size of your lemon. I used it as a salad dressing over lettuce wedges. To add a little more body to it, I put in some mayonnaise. For a dip I'd probably use  cream cheese to stiffen it up a bit so it would stick to things. The flavor is similar to Thousand Island dressing.

This would be a good addition to a relish tray and was a nice change of pace for a salad dressing.
