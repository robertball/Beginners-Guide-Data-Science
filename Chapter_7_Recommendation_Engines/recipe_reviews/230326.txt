Made this last night and it was great! I think next time, I'll serve it over fettucine instead of the gnocchi since that's the what my fiance asked to try.

This was great!  I used TJs Genova Pesto and TJs Gnocchi. The pesto was only 7oz but it still seemed like plenty. I did not have chicken broth so used some veggie broth. I also had to top it with a sprinkling of pre-shredded Mozz. since I did not have fresh available. 

I will absolutely make again. It was so quick and easy and delicious!

I made this tonight for dinner. I was a little nervous about adding cheeses to the pesto. (I didn't have mozzarella so I used Colby Jack.) I gave it to my husband, who is picky about his gnocchi, and as soon as he took a bite he was hooked. Very fast, very easy. I will make this again.

I made it as the recipe states, except I added the gnocchi directly into the pan with the chicken and pesto after it was cooked. It is simple, flavorful, and generally excellent. Thank you for a great recipe.

This dish was very simple to make - thank you for sharing the recipe! We found ours to be very, very salty. Before adding salt to season chicken and cook gnocci, you would be well-served to check the salt content on your pesto jar. I used Trader Joe's pesto and I went to look at the salt content when our dish turned out so salty - it has 840mg (35%) of salt! I looked at another jar of pesto I had in the pantry and it only contains 310mg (13%) salt. Had I used the other brand, I'm sure this dish would have been simple and great!

Loved this recipe. I used my homemade pesto with this. Very easy. Really no way to go wrong with pesto sauce and gnocchi!

Made this for the first time, always looking for something new to do with chicken.  I cooked chicken & added pesto following the recipe but then put the gnocchi in the same pan as the chicken & pesto, put mozzarella cheese on top & broiled till browned.  My husband loved it!

I admit I made some changes but not really changing the basic flavor profile.  First, I only used 1/2 the jar of pesto because the Barilla brand I had was *really* salty.  It turned out just right.  Second, I didn't have mozzarella balls, so I used a pre-shredded Italian cheese blend that included mozzarella, parmesan, and asiago.  Mixed the chicken and gnocchi as described, mixed in the cheese.  Then I transferred to a casserole dish, topped with a little more of the shredded cheese and a sprinkling of Parmesan.  Broiled it until the top was golden.  Perfect!

Excellent recipe.  I sauteed onion and baby portabella mushrooms with the chicken.  Though, this recipe is only as good as the pesto as that's the main flavorâ€¦ mine was just so, so -- wish I had bought a better variety than juts using my jarred pantry version.

I just finished making it. I only made one serving, for myself, and it was DELICIOUS! I like mozzarella so I used 6 small balls when I combined everything in one pot. Otherwise, the recipe was the as is. I'm not sure if it matters, but all of the ingredients were purchased at a gourmet supermarket. There is a difference in taste when in comes to the meat. Will be making again!

It was edible, heating the pesto absolutely spoiled its taste. Also, the mozzarella didn't add anything to the recipe but calories. I will not try it again.

Yum!  This is so simple, especially if you forget to read the recipe and think it calls for already cooked chicken.  Which is, of course, what I did, but that made it even faster.  Very delicious, easy, and a great idea.  Thanks for the recipe!
