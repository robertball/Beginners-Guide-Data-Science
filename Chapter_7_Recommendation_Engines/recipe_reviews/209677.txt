I just made this dish for dinner tonight. Let me say, I was not expecting a lot because of the noodles in the Knorr Pasta Sides. But let me tell you, it turned out AWESOME! I used Fajita Chicken. Will definitely make again.

We thought this was very good. The recipe is on the back of the Knorr package. The only change I made was instead of frozen vegetables I chopped fresh: one carrot, one celery stalk and one small head of broccoli. I used grilled, shredded chicken and topped the dish with fresh ground black pepper. A definite keeper!

Quick & easy, a couple changes I made were to use canned chicken breast and instead of pasta mix, I used a chicken flavored rice mix.

Not for us.  It was not chicken pot-pie at all.

This was easy, but I wasn't sure about the taste.  I think it was the seasoning in the noodle packet that seemed "off" to me.  I don't know that I would make this again.

I had left over roasted chicken and my husband loves pot pies, so I thought I'd try this.  My grocery was out of Knorr pasta side-chicken, so I purchased Knorr turkey gravy and added ramen noodles.  I also used 12oz of flaky biscuits.  I was impressed at how easily this pie was cut into wedges and removed from the pie plate.  I will definitely make this again.

A hit with my husband, but a 'miss' for me.  Did not like the whole noodle thing. Would prefer a bit creamier (like a medium white sauce).
