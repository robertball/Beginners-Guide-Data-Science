I made some changes to this and I think that is why we liked it so much.  I read that people had trouble getting the pecans to stick, so I ground them fairly fine in the food processor, and then mixed them with preseasoned breadcrumbs.  This stayed on the chicken nicely and you still got the taste of the pecans.  I browned them on the stove top as directed, but then placed them under the broiler to finish them up.  This kept the breading from getting soggy.

Wanted something different for chicken breasts This was IT!. I seasoned the chicken breasts with Montreal Chicken Spice and Garlic Powder before adding the other ing. Turned out wonderfull. You must use a food prosessor or chopper for the pecans. That way they have no trouble staying on the chicken. Do not use high heat or the pecan will burn. Cooked in no time and was tender and moist. My 91 year old Mother said it was devine. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

Delicious dish! My family enjoyed it and my son said it was the best chicken he'd ever had.  I might salt the chicken breasts before coating them with the maple syrup. I also pounded them between waxed paper to make them thin & even.

Flavorful!  I've made a similar meal using honey.  The REAL maple syrup adds a nice smokey flavor.  I add fresh herbs with the pecan mix.  Brown chicken in a skillet then place in the oven for 12 minutes at 350ยบ.  Finishing in the oven makes the chicken extra tender and toasty.

Instead of frying in the pan I baked the chicken at 350 for 20-25 minutes and it was awesome and a lot fewer calories.

I put my pecans thru my food processor to get them really fine and added some garlic and onion powders. Didn't want the chicken to be overly sweet, so I lightly brushed them. I also used the thin breasts which allowed them to cook thru. Once cooked, I removed the meat, added a bit of flour and wine to the pan which made a nice light sauce. Thanks Rhonda!

EXCELLENT!  I needed a recipe for a pan-fried chicken, and I happened to have some pecans on hand.  I always read the comments first, so I knew to boil the 6 chicken breasts first, and I chopped the pecans almost to a powder!  The chicken was still warm when I placed it in a large ziploc bag with extra maple syrup, so I threw it into the freezer for a few minutes before coating it for frying (I wish the maple syrup was a bit thicker, may have to work on that).  I used a little butter and olive oil to fry it (that's my oil of preference).  It was absolutely delicious!!  Served with (slightly-over)-roasted sweet potatoes -- marvelous together.  Highly recommend to all!

This was really good, but the breading tended to fall off in the pan (the 2nd time I made this, using finer chopped pecans helped!).  I made it lower in fat by using only 1 Tbl. of oil and 1/2 Tbl. butter.  I preferred honey to maple syrup, and I didn't bother measuring it (just brush-coated both sides of the chicken breasts).  I made served this cut up on top of a salad that had romaine lettuce, tangerine slices, celery, toasted pecans, dried cranberries, and cranberry vinaigrette (dressing recipe called "Green Salad with Cranberry Vinaigrette" from this site).  I, too, had problems getting the chicken done without burning the breading.  I just cooked it for 20 minutes on low heat, then popped it in the microwave for 4 minutes afterward - it still stayed juicy.  The 2nd time I made this, I cooked it in the pan until golden, then transferred to a glass baking dish, covered it in foil, and baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  Perfect!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I can't say enough about this chicken, my family absolutely raved about it and they are very picky.
A friend of mine tried it and said it was the best chicken recipe he had ever tasted.  Wonderful!

I love this dish. It has such great flavor and is a much healthier and tasty alternative to fried chicken. I changed the recipe up a bit, however, and used eggs and maple syrup to coat the chicken first. I also used Pecan Meal (ground pecans) instead of whole nuts and it stuck so well that I had no use of the flour! I used basil, salt, and pepper for seasoning, and I broiled it first then quickly fried it for taste.

An absolute favorite, but instead of stove top frying the entire time, I baked it at 375 for 20 minutes to finish it up for fear of turning the crust too dark.  Also I made sure to generously salt it after to give it that salty sweet touch...WOW!

Loved the flavors!  I used honey instead of syrup and added 1 TBSP of crushed red pepper flakes for a sweet and spicy kick, wonderful!  Had trouble keeping the coating on the chicken so will try an egg wash next time.  Baking in the oven seems like a lower fat method, will try that too!  Loved, loved, loved this recipe!

The flavors (and previous reviews) involved make this sound like a tantalizing recipe, but I found the end result to be a little disappointing.  The chicken tastes more like faux fried chicken, and with the price of pecans (and the high fat content), I'd advise prepping the real deal if you have the time.

My family really loved this, which is shocking as they don't usually like nuts in their food.  I did make some simple adjustments, just to make it a little (and I mean little) bit more healthy.  I used a teflon electric pan so I could cut down a little on the butter and oil and I used olive oil.  I butterflied the chicken breasts so I could make sure they got done before I burnt the outside.  (I still wasn't sure if they were done enough so I put them in the oven for about 15 min at 325)  I also ground the pecans, and used lite pancake syrup.  I just used a BBQ brush to just paint on the syrup then layed them in the nuts to bread.  My family now is asking for these all the time.  They did look a little burnt, but they weren't if the flavor is any indication.  Rhonda, thanks for the great recipe.  Your the best!

I have made this twice now and the trick is too blend the four, pecans, and salt in a food processor.  The pecans get coated perfectly in the flour and the nuts stay on the chicken much more than chopping the pecans and mixing them by had later.  Otherwise the recipe is amazing and my entire family loves it

Something more interesting than most chicken recipes. I tweaked it to enhance the flavors and make a sauce.  I used the food processor like most of the other reviewers. I also added the flour to the nut mixture in the food processor to mix it up. I also added around 2 TBSP of brown sugar. I marinated the chicken in the syrup for about 2 hrs so it enhanced the flavor. Using the pan i just browned the crust and put the chicken in the oven at 350 until it was done. once the chicken was done i took it out of the pan and deglazed the pan with white wine (should be a sweet wine or brandy). I used about a cup. I let the wine reduce to about 2 TBSP then added chicken stock about 4 cups and about 2 TBSP of brown sugar. I reduced that to half. If more sauce is needed add more stock and reduce again. The color of the sauce should be a beautiful brown. Then add a small slice of butter with the heat off. Once butter is incorporated taste and season with salt. Then strain through a chinos, if you dont have one then use cheese cloth.

Absolutely wonderful way to prepare good old chicken breasts!  Loved it and plan to make it for company.  Don't know if kids would like it or not.  My guess is yes.  Not only will I make this frequently but I will pass the recipe along.  Thanks!  SHARON

We made this exactly as written and I do recommend using real maple syrup. Although it was dicey, we did manage to get the chicken done without burning the pecans, however I will more finely grind the pecans next time as recommended by other reviewers. I served it with baked sweet potatoes and a couple of leftover veggies for a quick, easy weeknight dinner. Easy, delicious, and made with pantry staples. Definately a repeat.

This was excellent!  I made a few changes based on other reviews...I seasoned pounded chicken with garlic salt.  Placed pecans, panko breadcrumbs, a pat of butter, and flour in food processor.  I patted mixture on chicken that I brushed with maple syrup.  Right before I placed in oven I drizzled syrup over pecan breaded chicken and then baked for 20 minutes at 450 and then another 15 minutes at 325.  It turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe.

Awful recipe, the chicken ended up burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. Nuts got burnt, maple syrup because disgusting. Would not recommend this recipe at all.

I just served this dish for 20 people, and it was a hit. The blend of the pecan breading with the maple syrup, allowed this dish to be juicy and not too sweet. I double the breading, and rolled the chicked in the breading 2 times. The chicken can quickley burn in the pan, so after I browned the chicken, I placed the chicken in the oven, at 350 degrees for about 20minutes to finish the cooking process.

Very tasty.  Take care to crush the nuts pretty fine or they don't stick as well to the meat.

My wife and I loved this chicken.  I used maple syrup and did not have a problem with the coating staying on the chicken.  By cooking on a medium heat setting the coating cooked to a golden brown and did not burn.  I suspect honey would be a problem because of the high sugar content and when heated it thins to the consistancy of water.  We will have this chicken again.

This recipe is a keeper! My husband likes chicken breasts flattened, so I did this prior to cooking. I drizzled some additional maple syrup on the chicken breasts while cooking. With rice and baked butternut squash as side dishes--yummm!

I made this fabuous chicken recipe tonight for dinner. My husband and I both loved it. I made just a couple of small changes. I salted and peppered the chicken breasts before putting them in the syrup. I used pancake syrup because in our small community we do not have access to real maple syrup and they tasted just fine. I also ground the pecans in my food processor and they stuck to the chicken just fine. I browned the chicken on low heat until lightly browned and finished them off in a 350 degree oven and they were moist and tender and the color was beautiful. My husband requested that I make them again and again. Next time I think I will try them cut up in a salad.I will also make chicken strips for my grandchildren. These are good enough for company! Just be patient and brown them carefully and you will be satisfied with this great recipe!

I thought this recipe was great!  I used the pancake syrup I had, and it was fine.  Medium heat should be on the lower side and I blended the pecans in my coffee grinder and added a little garlic powder. When it was brown enough, I put in 350 degree oven for a few more minutes.  For good health, I sprinkled a few chia seeds on top and some ground flax seeds.  Easy does it on the seeds!

I used agave instead of maple syrup because my DH and I are both diabetic and I was concerned that trying to use sugar free maple syrup would result in off-flavors from the artificial sweeteners used.  I used plain dried breadcrumbs in place of the flour and finely chipped the pecans in the food processor. It turned out perfectly.

Ground the pecans, mixed them w/ panko and flour and used a combination of pan-frying and baking. The pecans clung to the chicken fairly well but some of the coating got too dark and some fell away. I'll definitely make this again, adding more spices to the maple syrup to enhance the flavor.

Very easy and nice flavor.  I soaked the breasts in buttermilk for a few hours for extra tenderness.   Will make again.

I used walnuts, because that is what I had, and next time I will grind them finer to get them to stick better. I also brined the chicken breasts for a half an hour first, which helps keep them nice and juicy.

To cut down on fat, I baked the chicken breasts. I didn't have maple syrup, so I substituted using honey. The pecans got a little burnt, but still had lots of flavor. I will make this again, thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was delicious!  Cook on Medium/Low heat so you don't burn the chicken and I covered the pan for the last 5 minutes so breasts would stay juicy!  Is sweet, so needs pairing with something a little spicy for a side dish.  My husband loved it, I'll make it again!

Mmmmm, delicious, and very moist. I followed the suggestion of using bread crumbs. I ground the pecans in the food processor & mixed them with Panko bread crumbs. The breading still fell off when I fried it, turning it ever so carefully. I tried adding a bit of flour to the mixture with it to see if that would help.....it didn't. I think you need to add something into the syrup to make the mixture stick better. I used Grade B Pure Maple Syrup. Any suggestions? I am not a cook!

I did not read the reviews, just make it. there is so much information left out. My chicken was not done and the breading was black. I should have known because browning nuts is tricky and they can burn fast. It was a struggle to just keep them from burning and I was on medium. Wish I had known to grind the pecans fine and oven cook the rest of the way. Chicken was not done and I had to scrape off the burned nut mix.

My family LOVED this recipe. I grounded the pecans pretty fine so they stuck to the chicken pretty well. I also added about a teaspoon of garlic salt and a teaspoon of onion flakes to the pecan/flour mixture. I seasoned the chicken with Monetery Chicken Seasoning. Also, I butterflied the chicken breasts, fried them until golden, then baked them in a glass dish at 350 for 15 minutes. The chicken was tender, juicy and the flavors layered really well. Will definitely make again. Served with mashed potatoes and chicken gravy.

I loved this chicken! I used Naturally Fresh Salad Topping Roasted and Glazed Pecan Pieces that I chopped as fine as possible to better stick to the chicken. I have never reviewed a recipe here before, but was inspired by how delicious this chicken was.

This was a HUGE hit with my family!  My two 9-year olds absolutely loved it and my husband did too.  Interesting because normally my husband wouldn't be crazy about a sweeter recipe.  I pounded 3 chicken breasts very thin then cut them in half to get 6 pieces of meat.  Fried in olive oil and butter.  Warmed to serve later in the oven and made a gravy with the drippings in the pan.  Great meal and will definitely serve again very soon!

I liked this and would try it again.  I was in a hurry so I didn't pan fry instead I baked them on a sheet at 400 from 10 min or so each side.  Next time I would take the time to pan fry and chop my nuts a little finer.

It sounded like such a good idea!  What a mess!  I realized long before I even turned on the burner that medium heat was too high, even after turning the heat down, the coating did nothing but fall off and burn in the fry pan.  I might try this again, but with several different variations.

This is just delicious! But very rich though.  I split the breasts so they would be thin for frying.  This is important because if too thick, the nuts will burn before the chicken is cooked.  I also chopped the nuts finely in the food processor.  The mixture sticks better to the chicken this way.  I served it with the Winter fruit Salad with lemon poppyseed dressing.  It was a great mix!

What a great taste.  Even my husband who hates when I try new recipes loved it.  I did use my processor to chop the pecans pretty fine and I added about 1/3 sleeve of Ritz crackers to them.  I also beat an egg with about 1/2 cup maple syrup to help the nuts adhere.  By pounding the chicken thin I had no problem with them not being done.

This recipe was amazing!  The maple syrup gives the chicken a sweet flavor.  Instead of brushing it on the chicken, I put the chicken in a plastic bag, squirted the syrup over it, and set it in the fridge for about 10 minutes.  The pecans also take on a toasted flavor when cooked with the chicken, and I had a little trouble getting them to stick.  So I sprinkled them on top of the chicken while it was cooking.  Great recipe!

Very tasty and interesting. Don't be shy with the maple syrup. I dipped the chicken instead of brushing the syrup on and the pecan breading had no trouble staying on the chicken during cooking.

This recipe is excellent! We didn't have any real maple syrup, so we used 1/2 honey and 1/2 pancake syrup to make up for the maple syrup.  I like to make this and cut it up into salads.

Good, quick, easy & simple ingredients you usually have.  Not quite as good as I thought it would be, but still tasty.  I think I'll use more nuts next time, more finely ground. Be careful not to use too high a fire because of the syrup.  My first piece was a little dark, but I turned down the fire before the 2nd went in. I would make it again though.

We really really liked this.  I know it was good because I'm a dipping sauce person especially for stuff like "plain chicken breasts".  I had my honey mustard ready to go and did not want to use it because it masked the delicious flavor of this chicken!  I used almonds rather than pecans because that is what I had.  I chopped them and then put them in the food processor with 1 1/2 T of flour, 1 1/2 T bread crumbs, 1 t of garlic salt, 1 t of minced onion flakes and 1 t of red pepper flakes and ground it until it was very very fine.  I let the chicken breasts soak in the maple syrup while I was doing all that and then coated them.  I browned them on the stove for about 3 minutes per side and then cooked them at 350 for 15 minutes.  So crunchy, so moist, so good!!

It was very good but I would suggest using chicken breast filets. The size of chicken breasts is so large that it takes an extended period of time and then I had to place it in the microwave for 2 minutes to complete the cooking.

This was ok.  My chicken was a little dry but that might have been my fault,  Good flavor though!

Made this for Dinner last night & it was great!  Made absolutely no changes to the recipe, chicken was moist and the "breading" turned out crunchy.  Next time though I will chop the pecans a little finer than I did this time and make just a little more of the breading as the last breast was a little thin on it.  Definitely a keeper and a great fall dish.

I liked this recipe, good flavor. I baked chicken on rack until thoroughly cooked, then placed in skillet with cooking spray to crisp it more. Served with cornbread. Next time I might used salted pecans to give it more a sweet n salty flavor. You do need to chop nuts finely in processor, sticks fine.

Tasty breading and a nice change of pace for breaded chicken, however, I had a super difficult time actually keeping the breading on the chicken hence only 4 stars! I am just a beginner, so I will heed suggestions on how to get the topping to stick and definitely try again.  Once that's taken care of its a 5 star, super easy dish all the way!

really nice alternative to my usual southern style fried chicken.  Try to get the pecans chopped up pretty fine so they stick well.  Very tasty!

This was great! 4 adults and 4 kids (under 5) all enjoyed it.  I pounded the chicken so that it was thin and cooked more quickly and evenly.  I didn't have pecans, so I used walnuts - I'm sure the pecans are good and will use next time I make this recipe. I also used less butter (about a Tbsp) and there was not problem with sticking to my pan.  Enjoy! This is a new "regular" at our house.

Nice taste, but the pecans would not stay on the chicken.  Also, the pecans burned after 15 minutes of the cooking, but the chicken was still not cooked thoroughly.  Next time I would boil/steam the chicken breast before sauteeing - may actually reduce the amount of oil needed.

We liked it. It was SUPER JUICY. I was hoping it might be a little sweeter, though. Only changes were that I baked it - and that was fine - and I used mixed ground nuts because I forgot to buy pecans... so I used a mix of almonds, peanuts, and walnuts.

I thought this was exceptional! Hubby thought it was too sweet but it may be because I forgot the salt. I baked it instead of frying. This would also be an awesome way to prepare pork chops!

Awesome!!  I used seaoned salt instead of regular.  I threw all the ingrersients in the food processor along with some garlic powder.  I let the chicken sit coated in the syrup for a couple hours in the fridge.  I did not use real syrup and it still turned out great.  Great chicken and very easy!!

My husband and I loved this however, I did modify based on the reviews.  I added panko bread crumbs to my pecans, I put pecans in the food processsor and also added granulated garlic.  I didn't have real maple syrup so I used pancake syrup and honey and also beat an egg into it to make sure the pecans adhered to the chicken.  I browned the chicken on medium heat then finished  in the oven at 375 for 25 min.   Thanks for the awesome recipe.  Little more work than I usually like since i have 2 little ones but will definately make again.

The recipe says to used chopped pecans, but they need to be very small in order to not fall off while cooking. Instead of chopping, use the food processor or blender to grind them. Otherwise this was a tasty recipe.

This recipe is very easy, but I was hoping for a little more.  The leftovers tasted much better the next day, so maybe the chicken just needed a little more time to absorb the maple syrup?  I gave it 4 stars because it really is simple but very showy on a plate- it just needs a little more boost of flavor.

This recipe was great! I did season the chicken with salt and pepper. I also added garlic and onion powder to the pecan mix. I browned the chicken a finished it off in the oven on 350 for about 15 minutes, and in the end I brushed it with a little more maple syrup. IT WAS FANTASTIC!!!!

Really tasty! I chopped the pecans finely too. It is easy to get them too dark when cooking though, don't leave unattended or it can burn.

This was so simple and so delicious! Only thing I didn't do well enough was to chop the pecans fine enough... it was still great, but I think the coating would have stayed on better if the nuts were chopped finer.

People are complaining about the chicken not getting cooked. I always boil my chicken for a few minutes before doing anything else. Just a simple idea, doesn't take any more time, boil chick while fixing up other stuff. and it does not take away from flavor at all.

I LOVED this chicken. I used Walnuts but suspect it would taste even better with pecans. I was dubious about nuts on chicken but it was excellent. I found that it cooks very fast so thin chicken would be best. Can't wait to make it again!

Really enjoyed this. Will make it again. Think it would go well with wild rice as the side dish. Also, I made a couple of breasts without the nuts, just soaked in the maple syrup, which the kids liked better.

As others suggested, I used the food processor for the pecans and added a handful of pretzels instead of using flour and salt. YUM! A little extra maple syrup drizzled over the top and it was delicious. This has been added to the rotation!

This was was way too bland and the flavor of the pecans and chicken didn't meld together. Some reviewers noted that they added spices before the pecans but I don't know if that would even be enough to save it.

This is delish!  I used a packaged ground pecan and flax seed coating mix, melted some butter and olive oil in the pan in the oven before putting in the chicken and baked until done.  Wonderful!

Love pecans and maple but this recipe was a bit of a fail for me. The nut flavour was there, but the maple seemed to be lost.  Still a great idea! thanks Rhoda McIntosh

Delicious.  I baked mine instead of frying it at 375 for 25 min and it came out perfect.  Just the right level of sweet and salty, and the pecan breading locked in all the moisture.

My husband said we need to have this again soon! We are on low carb diets so I used almond flour and Splenda syrup. I also sprinkled some Montreal Chicken seasoning on the chicken before cooking.

Like others, it was difficult to keep the pecan crust on the chicken. Next time I'd sautรฉe the chicken until brown and then finish in the oven.

I only used honey, salt and crushed pecans and baked the chicken instead of frying it (350 for 20-25 minutes). It was so delicious and pretty healthy without the added oil, butter and flour. Simple and delicious!

Very good. I actually fried it in coconut oil to make it a little healthier. No butter or oil, only healthy coconut oil which gave it a good flavor.  I really pressed the chicken into the pecan mixture which helped it from falling off like others said.  I also used very finely chopped pecans that I bought at a health food store. I will definitely make this again!

A favorite in my house! I pound the chicken breasts between two sheets of wax paper. I like them thin so that they cook quickly and stay moist; also, I think this helps with portion control since the flattened breasts look larger. I grind the pecans finely in my little mini chopper. Then, I combine the pecans with the flour and salt. I brush the chicken with lite syrup (tastes just as great as the high-calorie stuff) and coat it with the pecan/flour mixture. Brown on the stovetop for a few minutes in a little olive oil, then pop into the oven at 350 for about 30 minutes. Easy and delicious!!

Yummy, moist and tasty.  Don't worry not too sweet.  I used ground almonds instead of pecans and it was still great.  We'll be making this many more times in the future!

I found this dish delicious!  I altered a little. I used pancake syrup (it's what I had) and added some molasses to help it stick.  It' worked great!  I read many reviews in this so I also used a lower heat!  The pecans are best when crushed almost fine and I added bread crumbs and garlic powder.  It was great!!  I will definitely make this again!

This is an awesome, quick dish. Like the others, I crushed the pecans (used handy cooking rock) and I also mixed in some seasoned breadcrumbs.  Since the cooking time is quite short, I actually let the chicken sit in the maple syrup for a bit while I prepared the potatoes and veggies. Prior to soaking, I also added some salt & garlic pepper to the chicken. Kids & Hubby loved it.  Nice substitute for fried chicken.

SO. SO. SO. Good, every bite = AMAZING!

This was absolutely delicious. I wouldn't have thought about brushing it with the maple syrup, but wow was it good.  I also added some liquid smoke to the syrup to give it a smokier flavor.  I ground up the pecans to a very fine texture and had no problems with it sticking (also added bread crumbs and flour).  I only pan fried it for a little to make it slightly brown and then I put it in the over to cook thoroughly.  Really a great recipe - served with beans and corn.  Can't wait to make it again.

Overall, this was a fantastic recipe! I loved the flavor and my boyfriend put it in his top favorites. The only thing I would mention is that mine turned out a bit greasy from frying it. Next time I will just bake it instead of frying. But will definately add it to my rotation!

I made this the other day. Grounded up the pecans in foodprocessor so they would be small and not fall off. I was not impressed with this recipe. I served this with baked sweet potato and fresh steam broccoli . I followed recipe exactly, was hoping for something with a little more flavor. The husband loved me eeh not so much. Prob wont make again.

This is my family's favorite chicken dish! I added one more ingredient that makes this recipe even more delicious. I added 2 tbs of orange marmalade to the maple syrup mixture. The marmalade gave it a little tartness, which was great with the sweetness from the maple syrup and it also helped the pecans to stay in place on the chicken. Loved it!!

Tasty! Be careful to have the heat low enough or else your pecans will burn. It might have worked better as chicken strips, or with very thin chicken breasts.

Oh man was this good!  I was flying around the kitchen in a real hurry to get dinner ready after work.  My food processor had just been washed and wasn't dry enough... The pecans picked up the moisture and wouldn't grind down.  I added extra flour and everything seemed ok.  I baked in the oven at 425 degrees for a short time as the chicken was pounded out very thin.  Most of the pecans fell of but the flavor was fantastic!!!  I sprinkled the fallen pecans on at the end.

Wonderful idea!!  Used boneless pork loin chops because that is what we had on hand - they were quite thick and frozen, which I thawed IN the maple syrup and left in the syrup for another hour or so to marinate somewhat.  Then put pecans in food processor until finely ground and patted firmly into the chops. Browned in a mix of butter and grapeseed oil and then placed in 325 degree oven for an hour or so to insure they were completely cooked and in an attempt to tenderize.  Great flavor - didn't add any other seasoning (a rarity for us) and reasonably tender too.  Thanks for a great idea - will use on chicken breasts (or thighs!) next.

Just WONDERFUL!  Served it over salad and EVERYONE loved! Cooked it as directions said..bought the pecans that were chopped for cookies and used thin sliced chicken breasts, had NO problem with the pecans falling off, or the pecans burning, due to the thin chicken!  Wonderful!

I made this at work for my fellow firefighters. Two of the fellas liked it one of them said it was okay.  Myself and my officer didnt care for it. I followed the directions to the last word.  
If I was going to make it again, which Im not.  I would pound the chicken out a little flatter.  Whole breast took to long to cook through leading to a longer cooking time then expected.  Besides that the presentation was good and this may be a dish that is an aquired taste...

I think what went wrong was that I used chopped pecans and they really should be finely ground. They just fell off the chicken in the skillet and burned before the chicken was fully cooked.  I was left with chicken breasts in a pile of burned chopped pecans. The maple syrup flavor was good though. I think I'll try this again with finely ground pecans instead of chopped.

This was pretty good.  I mixed 1/4 cup honey and egg to dip the chicken in before dipping in the pecan/flour mixture.  I also took others' suggestions and boiled the chicken before frying.  I cut the cooked chicken into strips and added to the Strawberry Spinach Salad I from this site.  Made an excellent dinner salad.

I had a slight problem with the pecans not sticking as well, but that was probably because they weren't chopped fine enough.  There was also some slight burning like the others mentioned.  The taste was quite good though!

Ya know how people say "it tastes like chicken"? This had a seriously unique flavor. I made it as written but only used 3 breasts. Delicious and simple. Next time though I want to substitute PBFit for the flour.

This is one of the best dishes I've made in months.  Based off of the feedback of others, I put pecan chips into a food processor so they were more finely chopped, added 2 Tbsp of italian breadcrumbs, and broiled the finished product for about 1 min for a better texture

Very good and easy!  A few changes were made only because I am a Weight Watcher participant and tried to keep calories down.  I used Lite Syrup, didn't brown the chicken but coated it lightly with the pecans that I crushed finely and placed in oven for 23 minutes at 350 degrees.  I also added a few of my own seasonings to the chicken before breading it with the pecans.  It was excellent!

I made changes.

As the chicken was thawing, I looked down at the bottom of my kitchen shelf and saw the jar of pecans.  I googled "chicken & pecans."   Here I am.   I didn't want to dirty my blender for such a small task - the little amount of pecans.  So I used my KRUPS "coffee" grinder - with the spinning blade that is useless for coffee.  It had the remains of spices that I ground for the last time I made Mexican hot chocolate - all spice, cloves, nutmeg, etc .   I thought the pecans needed something to tangy them up.

So I put some ground whole all spice into the grinder.   And I put very little dash of cloves (probably a mistake).  Ground them with the pecans.  It formed a moist paste.  I did the usual chicken prep - salt, pepper, and flour.  Then a little coat of the pecan mixture.  Into a pan with butter and a little oil.  Drizzled a little Maple syrup on it. (Next time I think I'm going to use honey.)   Medium heat for a couple of minutes on each side.  Then coated the chicken with the remaining pecan mixture, and since  I didn't want to burn the pecans, I put it into the into the oven at 350.  Didn't need much time in the oven before it reached the requisite 165 degrees.  It came out very moist.  I think the searing in the pan and the final cooking in the oven works best for this dish.  It came out funky good - something like an Indian chef cooking Indonesian food while tripping on LSD might make.   The taste sensation was difficult to describe.

I look forward to m

I normally would not give a recipe five stars unless I followed it exactly. In this case, I forgot to brush the chicken with maple syrup so I added a drizzle at the end of the cooking process. Even with the error, my husband and I loved it.  He said it was a keeper.  I will definitely make it again.

First time writing a review. I tried this recipe last night, and it was a huge hit. I did expand on it by brining the chicken for 2 hours ahead of time (brine: 4 cups hot water, ยผ cup kosher salt, ยผ cup brown sugar, and 12 peppercorns - chill brine solution before using). I then put the chicken breasts in my low temperature smoker for an hour using pecan wood chips. I then followed the recipe pretty much as written except I omitted the salt from the breaking because of the brining. I did follow others' suggestions and put the pecans and flour in the food processor. I also only browned the breasts stovetop and finished them off in the oven. As others say, use pure maple syrup rather than pancake syrup. Great flavor and came out very moist. The pecan smoke was an added bonus - A woodsy, buttery flavor that offset some of the sweetness from the maple syrup.

made this for my roommates and I, and i must say this is such an easy recipe anf it tastes VERY good. I browned the outside a little more so I could get more crunch and it came out awesome. Also used a little bit of bread crumbs and sliced almond as well as honey mixed with the syrup. grrat recipe and not bad for a first time using this app.

I substituted brown sugar & maple flavoring for the maple syrup, since I didn't have any, omitted the salt, & sprinkled the chicken with garlic powder & just a dash of Chipotle seasoning. I didn't run the pecans through my processor as some suggested, just chopped them up as fine as possible. After I lightly browned the chicken in butter & pecan oil, I transferred it to a rack on a baking dish, put what pecans hadn't stuck on top, & finished them up in a 350 oven.  My daughter, 2yo grandson, & I all loved it! Will definitely make again.

We loved this. Some friends of ours gave us maple syrup from Maine. I coated my butterflied chicken with syrup. I put 1/2 cup of pecans and 1/2 macadamia nuts in my little chopper w 3 Tbsp of wondra and some  dried parsley.  Chopped pecan fine macadamia nut not as fine. 
I Coated the chicken in it along with salt and put in frig till ready to fry in butter and olive oil in my cast iron pan. Cast iron makes everything so good!  Finished off in toaster oven at 350. 
Had asparagus cooked in same pan and some mushroom risotto. What a meal!  Thank you!

This is a really delicious recipe and great use of pecan meal. I sliced the chicken breast fairly thin, parboiled it before coating. Also, used honey mustard rather than maple syrup. Keeping in my recipe file.

Great recipe! I added some fresh chopped garlic towards the end of cooking it, smelt amazing! Sliced up the chicken, let it cool and added it on top of a mixed salad that had strawberries and apple in it. Will make again.

I gave this 5 stars because we are always looking for a quick and delicious chicken recipe. It is difficult for the flour/nut mixture to stick to the chicken but it works. Everyone in the family enjoyed it. Thank you for the recipe!

I tried this recipe last night. I was bored of how I have been making chicken breast! This recipe was AWESOME!! My husband raved about it!! I adapted it just a bit by pounding out my chicken breast because they were not evenly sized. I also per other reviews ran my pecans thru a mini food processor with the flour and salt. My last adaptation was to bake it rather than trying to fry it. It seemed similar to a recipe I make with bread crumbs, so I thought it would be easier. I baked it 10 mins on each side. They were pretty thin (for Chicken breast) and it didn't take too long. If I hadn't pounded them out I think I would have done 15 per side or until 160 degrees. I think the best part about pounding them thinner, and not over cooking they were very moist and tender!! Enjoy!

This recipe was great!  I used some hot sauce and an egg along with the maple syrup.  I added garlic and onion powder to the pecans.  I didn't have enough pecans so I added cashews and ground all of them up and combined it with bread crumbs.  Browned it in the skillet then into the oven at 400 for about 30 minutes.  The chicken came out moist and flavorful!  Will definitely serve this again.

Delicious! I used blue cornmeal instead of flour due to dietary restrictions and added a sweet potato to the lunch. I put the pecans and drippings that had fallen off the chicken on the sweet potato and I'll tell ya, I wanted to lick the pan it was so good!

If pan frying you definently need to cut breasts in half or pound chicken out before cooking otherwise does not get cooked in center without burning nuts. Once I fixed this they were very good and would recommend making family loved it.

The whole family enjoyed this very much.  I listened to another reviewer and used MOntreal Steak Seasoning but we all agreed that it detracted from the maple/pecan flavors.  The strong pepper in the Montreal was to much.  Next time I would cook as written.

I cook for 5 big eaters so to speed the process along I browned in the pan and finished in the oven - worked well.  I also tried cooking some only in the oven and that worked well, too.  A very different texture and color but nice in it's own way.

not a fan. the chicken was moist but I didn't care for the flavor of the breading. I pan fried it and then finished in the oven, so the topping stayed on.

This recipe sure did please this Texas Girl.  Pecan encrusted?  check.  Maple Syrup... you had me at hello!  I did put my pecans through a food processor to get them fine like others suggested.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing.  My husband and I were very pleased.

I would have to agree with a lot of other reviews that it is very difficult to get the crust to stick.  I ground my pecans down to be like small gravel and it didn't stick and ended up burning in the pan.  Next time, I would definitely cook the chicken breasts in the oven for 25-30 minutes at 350 and then do the pecan crust in a pan afterwards.

The recipe was good, but I think a few tweaks are needed.   First of all, use real maple syrup.   We only had some pancake syrup around and it was really too thick to work easily with while coating the chicken.    I think I'm going to use my food processor and grind the pecans finer.   This should make a more even coating.   All in all, the chicken smelled wonderful while cooking and tasted very good.

My favorite way to cook chicken.  I browned the chicken on the stove, then finished it in the oven so the pecans wouldn't burn.  The chicken was so moist and flavorful... an absolutely awesome recipe.

I find it quite interesting that people found this recipe delicious. I found that the maple syrup with the chicken was an absolutely awful combination. I baked my chicken (crushed my pecans by putting them in a plastic bag and banging on them with a wooden spoon, so I didn't have a problem with not having them fine enough), and then made a sauce by using the juices from the baking dish and reducing that in a skillet with some red wine and chicken bouillon. I actually thought that made a quite delicious combination and really counteracted the overly sweet maple syrup. Would absolutely not eat the chicken without it, however. I would make this again, however (I really liked the chicken and the pecans), but will skip out on the syrup, I think.

One word - Heaven!!  Made this exactly as written and it was divine.  I did finely chop the pecans using my hand-held chopper, and had no problem getting the pecan/flour mixture to stick to the chicken.  If you have thin or split-chicken breasts 12-15 minutes of cooking time is sufficient, but if they are full and thick, you'll probably need 20 minutes or more.  If that's the case, keep it med-low and slow, so as not to burn the pecans, and you might need to add a little more butter and oil to the pan as they cook.  Wow, was this good! Thanks, Rhonda!

I followed the comments and seasoned my chicken before coating and I also popped it in the oven after pan frying. The pecans had trouble sticking but it could be because I used a little extra oil to fry them. Overall the flavor was plain so I sprinkled brown sugar on top and it made it very good!

I found this recipe today and it sounded so good I couldn't resist trying it. I didn't have any chicken breast, but used thighs instead.
Deboned them and followed recipe making sure to crush the pecans fine. 
I did however did 15 minutes in the fry pan and finished off with 15 minutes in the oven. They are definately lip-smacking good. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe. I am planning on having company after church on Sunday and will definately serve this dish.

I have used a variation of this recipe for about 10 years. Until about 4-5 years ago, pecans were available in 3 ounce packs for $!. I would add one pack to each shake n bake pouch. It made the shake n bake go a lot farther, and, I thought it really added to the flavor. My picky husband actually identified the pecans in the coating, and, now he won't eat pork (or chicken) any other way. I think I will try the maple syrup next time, sounds like an interesting twist.

The recipe was great. I followed the wriiten cooking instructions to a tee, which I normally don't do. It was fantastic.  I also added a bit of Old Bay seasoning garlic sea salt to the chicken and cooled in olive oil.

Thanks

Thought this meal was great!  I took my time cooking the chicken on the stove then placed in the oven as others recommended!  Yummy!  My hubby doesn't like sweet dinners so he wasn't too impressed. My son LOVED this meal!

Couldn't believe how good this was and so easy!  The chicken was incredibly moist and tender when cooked 15 minutes.  I used olive oil rather than Vegetable oil because I like it better and I believe it is very important to use real maple syrup rather than pancake syrup.  
Chop the pecans as fine as possible.

This was AMAZING! I cooked 7 (smaller) pieces of chicken and they are GONE and we're still craving more. The only change I made was using honey instead of syrup.

This is great! I added garlic powder, like some people recommended, and I think next time I'll add a little less because I think it overpowered the nuts and maple syrup a bit. I'll definitely make this again, though! Also, I used walnuts instead of pecans, because they were what I had on hand.

This dish brought the words "oh my" and mumbles of "yummy" from my whole family, even my 3-year old.  I did get a comment from my s.o. of "this is not on the weight watcher recipe page," but hey, it was delicious! 
I also ground the pecans, used some Beau Monde seasoning, and finished off with 15 minutes at 350 in the oven, as the chicken breasts were fairly thick.
Will most definitely make this one a regular menu item.

I thought it was great; hubby thought it 'so-so' said he would eat it again. I really liked the crunchiness of the pecans and the maple syrup added just a little extra flavor.

Very tasty. I cut the breast into chicken tender sized pieces, dipped them in the maple syrup, then the breading, fried them up real quick n a pan. I paired it with diced tomatoes and mozzarella cheese marienated in baslamic and basil vinergarette served over fresh sping mix salad, and fresh hot bread bun. Hubby Liked it also.   Oh only difference was I had a can of mixed nuts that i wanted to use up so I used that instread of pecans only, skipped the salt.

This was really easy to scale down to one serving. I had some frozen raw shelled pecans from a farmer's market trip and I think using them raw is what made it crisp up so well without even slightly burning. I served it up with some of my mom's squash caserole and canned italian green beens. All together took me about 20 minutes total from prep to plate. Very yummy!

This was excellent!  To speed up the process I pulsed the pecans in the food processor and pounded the chicken thin for faster cooking time.  Thinner chicken breasts also prevent the breading from burning.   After chicken is cooked,  I recommend deglazing the pan with broth/water and pouring it over the dish.  We ate this with wild rice and peas with sauteed shallots, yum!

I loved the taste of the pecans, and like others on here I processed them.  I decided though after reading reviews that it was a little bland that I should kick it up a notch.  I experimented by adding a little ginger and cumin, I also used honey instead of maple syrup.  It turned out pretty good, was an interesting eastern flavor with a bit of sweetness!

Browned on the stove 3-4 mintues then finished in the oven 15 minutes on 350. Just not out taste--not enough sweet to give it that nice salty/sweet combo.

I followed the recipe to the tee, although I did add in some bread crumbs.  I had to turn down the heat med/low.  Even though it burned a little bit I really enjoyed this chicken.  Reminded me of Macadamia nut encrusted halibut.

This is a great dish, will have again for sure! We browned the chicken in the skillet then placed on a foil covered cookie sheet in the oven at 400 degrees for another 10 min due to the chicken we piked being so thick. In the end, it was amazing!

Followed the reviews and chopped pecans with my food chopper with a bit of seasoned bread crumbs.  Also added a bit of garlic salt and black pepper.  Browned in cast iron for 10 minutes, then in a 350 oven until meat thermometer said done.  Really excellent considering how fast and easy it is.  Would be good with wild rice, fresh crusty bread and a nice red wine!  ..... Update:  after two days in the fridge, the pecans turned the chicken purple.  Which was probably a sign I shouldn't be eating two-day old chicken anyway.  Just FYI.

This was a great chicken recipe. I cut the chicken breast into thin slices and grounded the pecans very small. The only thing I didn't like was it was a little soggy. Otherwise, it was great.

I really liked this chicken and it was so easy to make. I think the next time i make it I will try a little honey on the chicken instead of the maple syurp to give it more of a sweeter taste. Thanks for sharing

Easy and delicious recipe. I pounded and boiled the chicken and finely chopped up the pecans. Definitely would make this again.

This recipe was okay. Nothing special, but not fantastic or bad. I might try it again with some modifications.

Sweet and simple.  :)  I crushed my pecans in a quart sized baggie with the bottom of my measuring cup- I had no problem keeping the nuts on. I also had to bake to finish cooking since my meat was thick.

I made this recipe for my husband and my daughters in-laws. They all just loved it. The fater-in-law said you could also drizzle the chicken with a little of the maple syrup just before serving. I might try that next time. Iwill definitely make this recipe again.

Very nice.  Moist and juicy on the inside crunchy slight sweetness on the outside.  I agree this would also be great sliced on a salad.

These are AWESOME!  So EASY!  I will make these again.  Served with a tomato/basil pesto pasta side dish and garlic bread.

Not bad, not good. If you want these flavors go ahead and make some fried chicken with maple sugar covered pecans for dessert. At least, that's what I'd rather do.

This was a very good recipe. I followed some of the other suggestions to boil the chicken first and I had no problems with it being undercooked. I also added about a tsp of garlic powder. Even my 5 year old was asking for seconds! Thanks!

Great Recipe!  We added a little bit of garlic but other than that we followed the recipe and it was fabulous!

Great alternative to regular breaded chicken! Followed other users suggestions and boiled chicken first while I was preparing everything else. Thanks for the recipe!

This was so fantastic. My husband and I are big fans of O'Charley's Pecan Chicken Salad and this tasted so much like it! I made several changes: I sliced the chicken breasts into thin strips and breaded them individually. The pecans didn't stick as well to the strips but they topped off our salad beautifully. I also didn't have flour and used breadcrumbs instead. I dashed some garlic powder, saffron and parsley (I was feeling adventurous). It turned out to be a really good and easy meal. Thanks for sharing this recipe - it's a keeper!

This is excellent and an easy dish to make.  My husband, who is a really, really fussy eater loved it.
