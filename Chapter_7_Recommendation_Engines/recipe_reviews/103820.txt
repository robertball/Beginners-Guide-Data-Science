Yum!!! I mixed all the ingredients (I added garlic) together and then put the solid portion of the mixture into the filets and poured the remaining (mostly liquid) over the top and let it pool around the fish and then bbq'd it on low.  Turned out awesome. I think the key is to use the freshest fish possible.

DELICIOUS!

I don't have a BBQ so I baked the trout in the oven instead. We like our fish very well done... almost crispy. So I baked it for 20 minutes at 350F and then I broiled it for about another 8 minutes.

I also followed the suggestions made here and added some fresh garlic.

We loved this recipe and we will definitely be enjoying it again soon.

This is a nice light, quick recipe for trout. I followed this exactly, and I think it turned out very good, but this is not a recipe with a lot of bold flavors. You definitely get to appreciate the flavor of the trout. I didn't seem to notice the flavor of the wine at all, although the texture of the fish was wonderful. This can be baked in the oven at 400 degrees 20 minutes, I made this twice, once on the grill too. Thanks, I will use this again (:

Great base...I added 2 cloves fresh minced garlic and did not use parsley.  My husband said it was the best trout he'd ever had!  I also used fresh lemon juice and fresh trout.

3 1/2 stars: I followed the advice of others here & sprinkled garlic powder on the fillets after the liquid addition.  BTW: the recipe isn't written all that clearly: we melted butter, added the lemon juice & wine to that butter, mixed, and then trickled over the fish before garlic powder (next time I'll use garlic SALT instead), freshly ground salt & pepper & parsley .  I needed to use a lot more foil than was described--but it worked out quite well, boiling brilliantly when I opened to check the fish at 15 min.  My husband loved it; the kids ate all that was served to them; I thought it was OK, but tasted more like FISH than flavor.  Our fish had been defrosted from our freezer (bought fresh), so I'd try this again FRESH from the store (& with garlic salt or fresh garlic), b/c it was only that little edge away from a 4-star in my opinion.  Easy.

Recently tried this recipe with trout we caught in the Gulf; the wine kept everything most, the lemon juice was a great accent but like other reviewers, I missed the garlic...will make again, w/garlic!

Very simple, moist and delicious. I added minced garlic to mine and, in addition to the (fresh) lemon juice, I added sliced lemon to the cavity. I wrapped my large rainbow trout in foil and baked it in the oven at 375 for about 40 minutes - doneness completely depends on the thickness of the fish, bake/grill until opaque in middle and fish flakes easily with fork. Very very delicious!

Loved it but can't give it 5 stars because I changed...added plenty of fresh chopped garlic to the butter and microwaved the two together to melt before pouring on fish.
Dill would be good too and yes, plenty of fresh ground pepper!
Yum, moist and tender.

Excellent!! Much, much neater and tastier than laying the fish right on the grill. Only modification my hubby, the grill master, made was to add minced garlic. We will be using this reciped from now on.

I am not a huge fan of Trout but got some from the neighbor and used this recipe.  I added garlic as others suggested and I baked in the oven.

I used this recipe on Steelhead (which is just trout that's spent time in saltwater).  The flavors were light and subtle so the fish was the real focus.  I used a Pinot Grigio wine and baked it in the oven instead at 450 degrees F for 15 minutes.  Healthy and simple to make.

We have made this recipe several times, using fresh caught river trout, or frozen river trout, and each time it is a winner!  Mild, tender, not fishy tasting....what's not to love!  Of course it's better if you test a little of the white wine first!

Wonderful. The fish was divine. I decided to add broccoli and shitakes to the packet - that was a mistake - they absorbed all the wine and the flavore was overwhelming. The fish as cooked in the recipe, however, was perfect.

This was delicious and very easy. I added chopped garlic and didn't have any parsley, but didn't feel I was missing anything. The fish was very moist and juicy.

Got mixed reviews here.  Hubby didn't like it.  Two of us thought it was fairly good.  (I am not a huge trout fan beause of the bones.  I had a bone stuck on the top of my mouth as  kid...still gun-shy!)  We still all preferred our trout pan fried.  Added some garlic powder which gave it more flavor.

I didn't like this recipe at all. The fish was very moist but had little flavour, I even added dill, but I wouldn't make this again.

This recipe was fantastic. I also marinated the fish in the white wine, melted butter and lemon juice sauce for 30 minutes before adding to the grill. Then I also brushed the remaining sauce while grilling.

Was nice and moist but not a lot of flavor.  Missing something somehow - some other spice.
Still enjoyed it!
