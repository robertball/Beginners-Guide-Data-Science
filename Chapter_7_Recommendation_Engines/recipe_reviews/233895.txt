Good, but I would add more kiwi until an inch away from the end of peanut butter.

Strange combination of flavors... peanut butter and kiwi.  I wasn't enjoying that (using Smucker's all natural peanut butter), though I did like the addition of cream cheese.

I had one for breakfast one morning, and it was delicious! I thought that I would need more than just one wrap, but it was quite filling! I will definitely use this recipe again!
