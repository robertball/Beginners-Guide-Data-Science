This is some really good stuff!!  I didn't use the cereal puffs or corn chips since they weren't in my pantry, so I worked with what I had onhand.  I used 3 regular sized bags microwave popcorn, 2 cups holiday shaped pretzels, about a cup roasted peanuts, and 1.5 pounds (the whole package) vanilla almond bark.  To mix, I turned the lid to my round cake taker/keeper upside down and dumped everything into it and it worked perfectly.  Mixed with a large wooden spoon, then poured everything onto parchment paper to dry.  Couldn't be easier and absolutely delicious!  Thanks so much for a great recipe!  :o)  UPDATE 12/1/08:  For the kids at church, I leave out the peanuts and use M&Ms instead.  We've made this by the tons for VBS and other kid functions and they LOVE it!!

YUM! This is really good--a perfect mix of salty and sweet.  I only used 1 bag of popcorn, as the biggest bowl I had was already overflowing. It still came out just fine.  And a second person is definitely helpful, although next time I make this, I think I will divide the ingredients between 2 bowls to manage it easier.

I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe! It's amazing - I made it for a baby shower and it disappeared! Beware, it makes A LOT and you will be asked for the recipe! One change I tried was to add food coloring to the almond bark (pink for the baby shower) and it turned out very nice.

I've been making this popcorn for years.  I try different concoctions all the time.  Sometimes I just use the popcorn and almond bark with no other ingredients.  My favorite way now is popcorn, almond bark, coconut and chopped macadamia nuts.  It might even be good with dried cranberries thrown into the mix.  Yum! Yum!

This was awesome, and so easy!  I don't really like Kix or Fritos, so I used popcorn, pretzels, M&Ms, rice Chex, and almonds.   Couldn't find "confectioners' coating", but plain white chocolate chips worked just fine.   Since I didn't have an assistant, I poured the chocolate with one hand while using tongs to toss the mix with the other hand, and that seemed to work pretty well.   Great recipe!

I used this as a base recipe and WOW! This stuff is amazing. I used white almond bark, dried cranberries, chopped macadamia nuts, pretzel sticks, and milk chocolate M&Ms. It is so addictive! I made it to package for Christmas goodies, but I better make another batch for myself or else I'm going to eat the gifts!

Super yummy recipe... hits the salty/sweet craving perfectly.

A couple notes:

1- The vanilla confectioner's coating is a seasonal thing... couldn't find in 3 grocery stores (and I refused to use the White Chocolate); so I substituted in premium white chips.  In making half the recipe, one 12 oz. package of the white chips worked perfectly.

2-I used whole almonds, just a preference... liked it fine. 

3-For anyone confused on getting butter-free popcorn, be assured you can still get plain, no butter SALTED popcorn in the bag and this works great... or you could go old style and make your own on the stove!

Enjoy!

This is some good stuff!  It's such an easy snack to make and everyone likes to eat it.  At Christmas, I've made it just with the popcorn and Christmas sprinkles--we put it in cellphane bags tied with pretty ribbon and call it white chocolate popcorn then.  The kids love to give it out as gifts.  Anyway, great recipe.  You can tailor it to suit your own tastes (and budget) very easily.

Super duper yummy!  A hit with all my friends and family.  I followed the recipe exactly except for I used more almond bark than the recipe called for to make it extra sweet.  Looks very pretty as a gift in a Christmas tin. Thanks!

Made this for Christmas.  Got rave reviews from everyone.  Very addictive, very easy and very inexpensive to make (I bought all store brand ingredients).  
I used all the measurements from the recipe except that I used the whole almond bark package which is 1 pound 8 oz. instead of just 1 pound.  YUMMY!

Sounded great & the online reviews were glowing. I was sold with "never have leftovers". But... I had leftovers - practically the entire batch. Eleven teens barely touched this.  Some girls ate it when I prompted late in the night.  Anybody who said they liked it got a full bag to take home with 'em.

Here's my twist:  I used 2 bags Natural, Salted popcorn, 1 bag dried cranberries, 1 bag goldfish pretzels, 4 cups of Kix (whole pecans or almonds would be a nice addition if serving adults).  I mixed all ingredients into a brown paper grocery bag.  Instead of almond bark, I melted one 14 oz. bag of Wilton candy melts.  It was the perfect amount of chocolate about about a fifth of the cost.  Pour as directed.  Perfect taste and makes a ton!

I love this stuff!  I add pecans and craisins or raisins.  I've used kettel corn and it's much better cause the popcorn holds better. For an easier mix, I dump some of the stuff in a brown paper bag, add some of the melted almond bark and shake, shake, shake.  Pour in a bowl.   Dump more stuff, almond bark, and shake, shake, shake.  Repeat until all gone. Always a hit at parties.

good recipe! I popped my own popcorn instead of using the microwave kind.  And I used peanuts instead of almonds.  Very versatile recipe!

This was tasty and even though I had a ridiculous amount, it all got eaten. I used half vanilla & half dark chocolate flavored conf. coating. The only thing I would change would be to omit the Fritos...they were an odd texture & flavor.

This was really good.  I took it to a scrapbook party, and everyone asked me for the recipe.  I toasted the almonds to bring out their flavor.   I used a turkey roasting pan to stir everything in and used a rubber spatula.  It worked out great.  Just one tip, make sure you pick out the unpopped corn kernals before putting the popcorn in.  They can hide really easy and be really hard to bite down on.

This stuff is GOOD! I made a half batch and used a few substitutes from what I had in the cupboards... 1/3c. popping corn kernels, popped, 2c. Kix, 1c. Life cereal, 1/2c. peanuts, crushed, 1c. pretzel twists, broken up, 1/2 lb vanilla almond bark. My preschooler was able to help me with all the dry ingredients, too. It has a light tasting popcorn ball flavor and a good salty/sweet balance (so my husband will love it!) It is still cooling but I just can't stop eating! The half batch was perfect for a family with two small kids. Will definitely be adding this to the recipe box!

I have made three batches if this stuff and it keeps disappearing.  It is so good!  I have made it as written and also substituting rice chex for half of the kix, and added cheese-its to one batch.  Perfect combination of sweet and salty!

Really good! I added some dried sweetened cranberries for some color and sweetness as well as drizzled chocolate flavored bark while it was cooling down.  Made beautiful holiday gifts (in cello bags) that I received many compliments on.  Thanks for a great recipe!

SO DELICIOUS!!  My brother-in-law (who is very picky and doesn't ever say anything) wanted me to make some just for him!  I halved the recipe to mix it, which made it a lot easier to stir.  This is so good, you must make the whole recipe, though!  My kids devoured it, too!

This is so yummy! Just a note: don't be a dummy like me and dump the bag of popcorn into the bowl, or you will have popcorn kernels in your mix! It seems to be more manageable to cut this recipe in half just for the shear size it is all together. Awesome!

Excellent & addicting.  I didn't use fritos... but everything else.  Everyone loved it & although it seems to make a ton... it all went!  My word of advice.  Make sure you don't "dump" the popcorn.... I made that mistake & had to try to pick out all the kernels.  Giant pain.  Once they are in... big chance they will get stuck in the melted coating & someone will bite down on it.  (I had to "warn" my family!!)

I used captain crunch in this for a lot of extra color! Also, instead of almond slivers, which was $5 for a 2 ounce bag at the store, I substituted for candied pecans. After I laid the popcorn out to harden, I drizzled some dark chocolate all over the pan to create a great striped effect. This is a wonderful recipe, which is highly flexible for just about what ever sweet and salty snacks you want to put in it - definitely great for parties (and sweet tooth's)

Made this for a baby shower. I too made the coating pink as suggested in someone elses review. Everybody devoured it.  All comments from my guests were positive and many wanted the recipe. I will make it again in a few weeks for my nieces graduation party. Next time I might use whole almonds. pecans might be good too!

Made for a Labor Day cookout and it was devoured by the adults before the kids could even get their hands on it - and before dinner was served! It is a keeper. I did not have the cereal on hand, so just used the fritos, pretzels, peanuts, and popcorn. This could easily be adapted to anyones tastes and is YUM!

I make this every year for our annual Oscar party.  One batch fills the largest bowl I own and I always think "they won't eat it all this year"  but it is always all gone... and I make a lot of other good food for this party.  One year I gave it out in popcorn bags as favors.    I wear gloves to toss everything together with my hands, I don't use the cereal,  and a helper to pour the coating chocolate in is a good tip.  I also pop the popcorn from scratch adding some salt while it's hot.    My friend calls it addictive marshmallow popcorn stuff.

The concept of this recipe is great. It's very addicting! This recipe would have made too much, so I revised it....

1 bag of popcorn
2 cups of pretzel sticks
1 cup of salted peanuts
1 cup of peanut butter m&m's
1/2 cup of chocolate m&m's
2 cups of rice chex
1/2 package of white almond bark

I also used a brown paper bag to mix it all. Very easy. Will make again!

This recipe is delicious. The only thing I did different was substituting red and green peanut M&M's for the slivered almonds as I was making it for Christmas and thought it would look more festive. I also melted my chocolate in a double boiler...just my own preference. It's a wonderful combination of sweet, salty and crunchy! Love it!

So addicting!  I wasn't sure about the corn chips, but they were very good in the mix.  I've tried this twice.  Once following the recipe, and the second time I used popcorn, pretzels, cheerios, chex cereal and peanuts.  Both ways were delicious.

So simple, yet so good!  I made this to take along on a family outing.  It makes a lot but went quickly! I left out the corn chips, as per others' suggestions, and glad I did. I added craisins and white chocolate bits, and may add a little more pretzel and a little less cereal next time.  I will definitely be making this again, very soon!

I love this popcorn.  I make it at Christmas time and add green and red sugar.  I also add melted chocolate bark on top before I cover it.  At Halloween, I add orange and black sugar.  And just red sugar at Valentines Day.  I usually leave out the Kix cereal and almonds.

This was great-- The things I used were:  white chocolate chips, tortilla chips, Snyder of Hanovers peanut butter sandwich pretzels, and peanuts.   I only used 1 bag of popcorn and just eyed the appropriate amounts of everything.  It was great.

This is delicious!  I made this to bring to a party Saturday night . . . I hope there's some left on Saturday, because I can't stop eating it!  I oculdn't find almond bark/confectioner's coating, so used ghirradelli white chocolate chips.  YUM!

Yum! You need a really big bowl for this recipe because it makes a lot. You can add anything to it. I added a couple tbsp peanut butter to the melted coating and some rese's pieces.

My grandma sent me this is a Christmas goodie package. Although in hers, she just used the popcorn, Kix, Fritos, and confectioner's sugar. She used buttered popcorn as well. She had vacuumed sealed the bag and while it only took 6 days to get to me, the popcorn had gotten a little soft in travel. Other than that, it was pretty tasty. I was somewhat reminded of kettle corn.

I thought 2 bags of popcorn would be too much and it actually was for the big bowl I used.  All I had to do was divide the mixture up before adding the almond bark.  It made alot, but I was able to pass it around at work and take it to a friend's house for movie night! This stuff was so easy to make! Just wish it was easy on the calories!  :-)  Oh, and I used the pretzel sqares instead of sticks--same thing.

Next time I'll add in some yogurt covered almonds & fruit, that would be good. As would be some small pretzel knots too. And maybe a drizzle of caramel for a chewy flavor...lol.

I made this for my family to munch on at Christmas.  I initially did not like the combination of flavors at all but thought I would wait to see what everyone else thought.  Out of 13 people only one liked it so I sent it home with her.  I don't recommend this one,

This is delicious!  I added the whole package of almond/candy bark.  I also sprinkled a large package of M&Ms on the mixture after I spread it on the wax paper (the coating is cooler then, and won't melt the M&Ms).  Be careful....this is very addictive!
