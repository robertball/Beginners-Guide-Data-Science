Great recipe!  I followed it exactly and it turned out just right.  I had to cook them for 16 minutes, so check what works with your own oven.  The centre needs to be set.  I think this recipe would be yummy without cheese too.

I've avoided making souffles previously, since they looked complicated. This one was definitely easy, tasty, and impressive looking! I used gruyere, and it was subtle and good, but a bit overpowered by the lemon zest. 
For my 2nd batch I'm not using sugar and only 1/2 tsp zest. Yes, we liked the 2nd batch better.

I've made a few chef John recipes and haven't failed yet. I've never made souffes before, but this recipe sounded simple so i gave it a try. They turned out pretty good, i understand the "texture" thing now. I cooked it for 13min and it was still raw, so i popped back in the oven and watched it until it looked golden.

So I didn't have any cheddar... I used Swiss (don't do that), I didn't have any lemon.... I used a lime (don't do that). Other then my 2 mistakes, this was a good recipe and I'll be trying it in the future with better ingredients

I have never made a souffle before, but these were sure tasty! I doubled the recipe and my ramekins were only 4 oz. I did cut the amount of lemon zest, for which I was glad - the souffles were just the right amount of lemony. Will make this again!

Super easy, very tasty, great texture! I didn't have lemon but didn't miss it. The only alteration is make would be much less vanilla. It was way too overpowering.

Only thing I didn't add was the lemon zest due to not having lemons and the souffles still came out great!

Followed the recipe exactly and it came out beautifully. I've never had a souffle before and this was very easy to make. I will make it again and probably try different cheeses.
