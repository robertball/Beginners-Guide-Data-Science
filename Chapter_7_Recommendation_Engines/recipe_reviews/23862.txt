Normally I prefer everything fresh but in this particular recipe I thought chopped can tomatoes would work better and have more flavor so that is what I used. I liked this recipe and I liked that the lettuce kept some of its crunch. The flour almost gave it that bread taste and this really did taste like a BLT. I think it needed salt but that was the only thing I added. Good soup!
