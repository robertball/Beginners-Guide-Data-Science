OH. MY. GOD!!! So, I don't measure ingredients ever. I just go by my own personal measuring system, but I stayed within the limits of this recipe and I nearly ate half of the sauce before I even refrigerated it! Hahaha... I've never wanted to attempt to make this because I've had it at tons of Greek restaurants and it was ALWAYS phenomenal. This is by far one of the best tzatziki sauces I've ever had. And I made it! *doing happy dance*

Excellent recipe!!  The only thing I do different, and it works well, when I grate my cucumber I use 4 layers of papper towel and absorb the moisture out of the cucumber in this way.  The mint and real greek yoghurt is what makes this recipe!!  We are such big fans at home, we use it on everything.  I make a fresh batch every week, and sometimes 2.  I can't believe I'm only the 2nd person testing and at least rating this recipe from Chef John. You must try it!!

I am a first timer to this recipe, but because chief John is at the helm and the fact that I love him and would follow him anywhere I took the plunge. As  usual an excellent and fun recipe. It will become a frequent dish at my house.
Thank you so much for sharing chief John, take care and God bless.

I made this exact, only substituting almost a full tablespoon of dried dill weed for the fresh and I omitted the mint only because I didn't have any. I made this early in the morning so it could chill in the fridge all day. Not ashamed at all to admit I ate the whole thing with Stacy's Pita Chips. We'll...........kind of. But it was absolutely delicious.

I am a hero to my family in the kitchen because of this recipe.  I followed it to a "T" the first batch but really didn't care much for the cayenne pepper, it wasn't bad but not the best and just like Chef John said make it your own feel free to change it up to your likening. The next batch was out of this world good!!! The trick is to really, really dry the cucumber and add the lemon and salt a little at a time to your likening. Thanks Chef John great job! I love your videos!

I have made other Tzatziki sauces and this is by far the WORST. It had an over powering garlic taste, a very spicy aftertaste because of the cayenne pepper(I wouldn't use it), and it was too sour from too much lemon and I only used half as much as it asked for.

Just made this. I used English cucumbers, unpeeled for a little more color. I also zested the lemon to add a little more zing & pressed the garlic. I like Fage 5% Greek Yogurt, it adds more richness & better mouth feel. Just have to wait for the flavors to meld, but I know this one will be a winner.

Chef John is a delight to watch in his video.  I really wanted to love his recipe too,  but it had a terribly sour aftertaste.  After letting it sit, I tried adding sugar, salt, even blue cheese to bring out a richer flavor, but nothing could cover up that taste.   Having had tzatziki sauce many times, including in Greece, it did not compare.

Eh, a little too lemony for me. The cuke flavor just didn't dominate, nor did the mint or dill. I'll tell you what saved this. I made it again using dill pickle juice instead of the lemon (straight from the pickle jar). Much better!

So some say this is the authentic tzatiki sauce, well it's not what my family is use too so while it was ok it was different. I followed the recipe exactly. The difference was it was to tangy sour. The greek yogurt just overwhelmed the whole dish. We couldn't taste the mint at all.  I let it rest in the fridge overnight but it only made the aftertaste more sour tasting. Think I will try another recipe for this sauce to compare.

I will never buy tzatziki sauce from the store again! This recipe is delicious and very easy, as long as you can plan ahead and let it chill for a few hours. I swapped the cayenne pepper for paprika and used three quarters yogurt, one quarter sour cream. Also, I used the nonfat store brand yogurt from my local supermarket, and it turned out great. I can't get enough of this stuff when I go to Greek restaurants, and was always disappointed with anything I found at the supermarket. This recipe solves that! Thanks again Chef John!

My husband and I really loved this sauce.  The kids thought the garlic was a bit overpowering. So, now I make the recipe with a little less garlic to start with, scoop half of the sauce into another bowl, and add extra garlic to the original bowl.  That way the kids get what they want, and the adults can enjoy it, too.  Great recipe!

Tried this recipe and mine turned out a tad too lemony. I take full responsibility though for not tasting as I went along. I will be making this again, but with less lemon.

So good and so easy!! Made it exactly to the recipe and would not change anything except perhaps halving it as it made a LOT for just me and my husband (however, it all got eaten)... Thanks for another awesome recipe!!!

Love it! The longer it sits to marinate the better. Didn't really use exact measurements, just eye balled everything and tasted along the way. My Greek family will be impressed when I make this for family get-togethers.

I made this as directed but it was extremely tart and very garlicly.  I've had this many times and did everything as directed including squeezing the heck out of the cucumbers!  Nothing like the thick and creamy tzatziki I get at Mythlos. Chef John must not get the same garlic I get at my store because 4 cloves was TOO much!  And how do you mellow the tanginess of the yogurt?

This sauce is excellent.  Once you start eating it, you can't get enough of it.  And it definitely is better the second day. I followed the recipe exactly and it tastes very authentic.

Chef John does not specify which Greek yogurt to use.  I've made this a few times and it is consistently better if you use the full fat yogurt.  I think the fat content smooths out that unpleasant, sour,  almost chalky element.  Take caution with the garlic and lemon....not all are the same.  Always add gradually, tasting all along the way, to find what proportions suit your palate.

This was amazing! My mother is lactose intolerant so for her I prepared some with mayonnaise instead of yogurt. It turned out great as well. This is very Simple to prepare and will definitely become a staple condiment in my house.

This is fantastic!  I followed the recipe except I left out the mint, just don't like it.  The texture is thick and creamy and it tastes wonderful.  I already ate half of it, and I need the rest for the falafel I"m making tomorrow!  Thank you Chef John for another great recipe :-)

Thank you Chef John!!  It was requested that I serve lamb breast for dinner.  I thought couscous and tzatziki sauce on the side and found this a wonderfully simple recipe.  The only problem was I had no Greek Yogurt left and no way to get to the store to purchase any.  Thus I had to use light sour cream.  It was delicious(I can't wait to make this with the Greek Yogurt!!)

I was just looking for a measurement guide, as I've made tzatziki before, but couldn't remember the specifics. One thing I did remember is that I like the version with both dill and mint so much better than either one alone. I did follow the recipe to the teaspoon, though. I think that's a wise way to start before messing around with it, so you know which direction to step in. Next time I will make 2 changes because of my family's tastes and what we use the sauce for. I will use a teaspoon of lemon zest instead of lemon juice to keep it thicker. And I will use only 3 cloves of garlic. Mine was a little too potent. This is the recipe I will save and share forever, though.

This was fabulous!!! Grate Cucumber and let Greek yogurt drain, how long depends on your liking I let mine drain over night and make it in the morning. This was when I add all ingredients to yogurt it has time to sit and marinate and Oh boy it’s so Good!! Made it one time and hubby went wild now it’s a RePita!!! Thank you Chef John!

I made this exactly as written. Excellent sauce. Just as good as you'd get in the most authentic Greek restaurant. The longer it sits, the better the flavors come together. Paired it with a Gyro style turkey burger on pita. Definitely will make again.

Great recipe.  Easy and adaptable.  I will be making again, probably sooner rather than later.  Was a little shy on yogurt so made up the difference with 1/2 cup of sour cream and it worked out just fine.  Grating the cuke and squeezing out the liquid (which I then diluted with water and a couple of ice cubes for a tasty drink ... waste not)  is a great strategy.  The small amount that is left today is still very creamy.  My sister said it was the best tzatziki she has ever had.  Seasoning and chopped herb amounts were perfect for us.  Just watch the amount of lemon juice.  Half a lemon might be a bit too much if the lemon is large or really juicy.  Four hours in the fridge to set up was perfect.  Served with grilled rib lamb chops, baked red potatoes, greek salad and naan.  Perfect!!

Very good! I did add about half a cup of sour cream to it to tone it down a bit. I had a little too much garlic in it for me so next time I'm going to try half garlic and half a cucumber. I let it sit in the fridge over night and it was great! I also left out the mint.

I didn't have fresh mint so omitted it and used dry dill instead since it was all I had at hand. The flavor was good combined with greek style  chicken recipe from this site and chef johns pita bread recipe. You have to use it right away because it becomes watery if refrigerated for more than 24 hrs.

This is by far the best tzatziki recipe ever. Absolutely delish. Will never use my other recipe (which was good). I used the dill....didn't have mint but if i did, i would've used it. Used everything else as stated. Thanks chef John for a great recipe as always.

Great sauce but I think grating the cucumber left slimy string like chunks and there was a bit too much lemon juice.

I try to make recipes as written before adjusting, even if I am skeptical about certain ingredients.  In this case, I was worried about the amount of garlic but I gave it a shot anyways.  It was definitely too much for me, but I could see how garlic lovers or those used to cuisines heavy with garlic would really enjoy this recipe.  
I used the juice of half of a small lemon and it was the perfect amount, in my opinion.  The taste was there, but faint.
The whole milk Greek yogurt in an amount around 16 oz. was hard to find in my small town store so when I found the only real option, it was expensive.  I am glad I splurged, but it will be a long while before I try again.

Perfect. This recipe is easy and comes together quickly, other than the wait time to draw out the cucumber juice. The herbs are well worth the trip to the store if you don't have them available. Without tzatziki sauce, gyros would not be the same. This is a must have, and it's so easy, why not? I used this recipe for American Gyros and Chef John's Pita Bread, both prepared from the allrecipes website. My family loved it all.

Delicious!  I cut back on the garlic the second time because it is very strong.

I recommend using Fage brand yogurt because it’s the least watery. I’ve made this a few times in the last 2 months since discovering it.

Very good. My first attempt was a bit too heavy on the garlic. It may have been me, not the recipe. But like all of Chef John's recipes, totally worthwhile. I'd make it again!

My family and I like it chunkier with less shreds.  I did both , as he says this is traditional Greek, we are and it isn't.  But it has wonderful flavor and so very easy to prepare.  I loved his humor.

Well,,, one of the worst things I ever tasted. It really is just raw garlic yogurt. Not for me. Nothing, nothing like what you get in a restaurant. I used Fage yogurt not fake stuff.

Followed exactly and loved it! I purchased 2% Fage, which gave it a really smooth texture. Definitely let it sit for 3+ hours.

I was looking for a Tzatziki recipe that did not use oil and Chef John’s did the trick!  This is an excellent, bright sauce for gyros or really any dish.  I made it per directions only without mint (I didn’t have any).  I can’t wait to make another batch with the mint.

Thank you, Chef John!!! You made another culinary masterpiece - easy, healthy and tremendously delicious.

Recently I made very similar recipe:

You know we as private chefs apply our creativity and try everything:-)

Thanks again and I am waiting for new inspirational recipes from the Grand Master.

I made it and it was great but it needs to be mentioned to buy the Greek yogurt so you don't need to strain it and get all the water out. I did add feta cheese to it which gave it a little more taste. Otherwise great recipe.

Really good! I used full fat coconut milk (1 can) instead of the yogurt to make it dairy free. I added a bit of mayo to make it a little less watery. I also put it all in a food processor because I don't like the sauce to have chunks. It was very tasty.

As usual, chef John does not disappoint! Dude you are my hero and my go to if I want to learn to make anything. I didn’t have mint on hand but has everything else. I never measure unless I’m baking so I’m sure my measurement we off but I tweaked spices to taste and BAM! Deliciousness. THATS what plain Greek yogurt is for! I think would be great on salmon!  If it’s a chef John recipe, no need to change a thing!

Oh my gosh so good! We had fun making this, kids helped. When we got to the part of sprinkling a little salt on the cucumber  to draw out more water - here came the why question, "Why does the salt make the water come out?" One of our kiddos did a quick search and we learned about osmosis! Back to the recipe, to strain out the cucumber we used coffee filters, they didn't break through all the squeezing it got. All in all an easy recipe to follow and tasted just like the real thing!

This is one of those recipes that I didn’t truly enjoy the first time around but I’m looking forward to making it again. Next time around I’ll put in half the garlic called for and I think it’ll be delicious. I thought the garlic overpowered the other wonderful flavors.

This was the best tzatziki I've ever had!  Mine was a little too garlicky but I am thinking it is because my garlic cloves were pretty large (I love garlic) but I think it was a little overpowering.  Next time I will use either smaller cloves or less cloves to adjust.

Great tzatziki, perfect with pita and grilled chicken or falafel. 
Added 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne .
Will make it again and again.

Cut the garlic down to 1/4 of recommended amount and was OK but the lemon! Oh no, way too much lemon and i LOVE LEMON. I am a lemon fanatic, love love sour stuff but that is too much.

LOVE this recipe!!  I make this in combination with SnappySpoon's Spanikopita recipe.  I did leave out the cayenne since I can't handle spice. My family loves it!!  Very easy to make and the flavor is amazing!

There are times when a good sauce is just so darn good, you must have more, now, and it's something you'll be craving again the next day. This is not one of those sauces. Made as written, this sauce just got over complicated, over done, and over the creamy, cool, refreshing, clean, craveable condiment that it might be. 
I love tzatziki with grilled meats. This sauce on my meats tasted like a competition. It was not great with falafel, either. I did not try this as a dip. I might have liked it better.

I loved this.  I had never eaten Tzatziki before, but it seemed interesting.  Wow, I couldn't wait for it to chill, I had to eat some then.  I took a piece of whole grain bread and spread the Tzatziki on it.  Then I put some fresh mozzarella and topped that with some roasted red pepper.  Those were just things that seemed good together and it was.  The only thing I did different was to use much more cayenne (I love the heat).  Thank you Chef John, I knew if it was your recipe it would be good.

Yum. Goes perfect with Greek Spinach Feta Turkey Burger. Best with fresh lemon and fresh dill BUT dry/bottle subs are fine. Old dried dill does not taste good in anything.

This was WAY better than the tzatziki I've had at any Greek restaurant, and it was really easy! I like the idea of grating the cucumbers because my husband doesn't really like them. He loved this tzatziki. We ate it on Chef John's falafel. It was a great combination!

I love this sauce made with this recipe! Ive used it in place of mayo on sandwiches, as a dressing in chick peas and orzo salads and  as a condiment on meats; always fresh, flavorful and yet to serve it and not be complimented or requested for the recipe!  Thanks for sharing this gem.

Rave reviews from my husband on this one. I chose to leave out the cayenne. Had to use dried dill and mint in adjusted proportions for using dried herbs because my grocery store was out of the fresh option. Still tasted great! Will definitely be making this again in the future.

This is actually a 5 but since  I altered just a bit, I  rated it a 4.  I combined Molly's Mouthwatering Tzatzki recipe from this site with Chef Johns - they are similar but Chef John adds more flavors.  Instead of 2 cups Greek (make sure it's Greek) yogurt, I used 1.5 cups, 1/2 cup of Sour Cream, 1/4 Cup of Mayo.  Also, 4 cloves of garlic is correct.  I started out with 2 (easier to add then take away) but ended up using 4.  Also used about 3 TBSP of fresh dill and no mint (don't like it).  The cayenne pepper adds a nice depth.  Everyone loved it - will definitely make again.

That was annoying. I was reviewing this and my review just sent in the middle of me typing. Anyway, this make a lot and we use it on falafel, as a veggie & pita chip dip, and as a salad dressing. Very good and it’s become a staple at my house.

The hubby and family loves it.  Served it with greek turkey burgers and pita chips. Given this was my first foray into Tzatziki,   I appreciated Chef John's video instructions to highlighting the key points to making it successful. I made it per recipe.

I liked it, but the Greek yogurt I used made it oddly sweet. Maybe this would be better with sour cream.

This was fantastic sauce with the Greek Lemon Chicken and Potato Bake. Just be careful with the size of your lemon! I ended up with too much lemon juice in it and had to add more cucumber and yogurt. But it was so very good. Even my cucumber hating husband asked for seconds of the sauce for left-overs the next day when I forgot to put it out.

Just my choice, but I didn't put as much cayenne in it. This time I made it with parsley, instead of dill, which makes a nice alternative.

Subbed roasted garlic for raw garlic to cut the powerful nature.  Let the yogurt sit in a paper towel, inside a colander, inside a bowl to draw out some extra moisture (~45m in fridge).   It is DELICIOUS!

I liked this recipe, but I feel like it is missing something.  I will make it a few more times to see what it is that I am missing.

I made this for the first time about a month ago and now my husband wants me to make it every week. We LOVE it.  I followed the recipe, except a little less garlic.

I actually added more garlic because I love garlic.  I used lime juice instead of lemon, and it still tasted good.  It was just a little bit spicier than expected, and I might make it less spicy next time.

I LOVE THIS!  It’s always been one of my all time favorite sauces, but being able to always have it at home whenever I want is the best.  I dont use the Cayenne and go heavier on the garlic and dill.  Ive made 5 times so far

I followed the suggestion to add sour cream, added about 1/4 cup and was very happy with the results.  I served this as a dip with pita chips and received compliments from a friend who is an excellent cook.  Will definitely make this again!

Really good. I only used dill with no mint. I used three large garlic cloves and found it too strong; and I'm a garlic lover! I suggest you only use two large garlic cloves. I served mine with Souvlaki band Pita bread.

WHOA! That's alot of garlic. And I love garlic. I used half the garlic in recipe and it's absolutely wonderful. My family loves it. Chef John is one of my personal heroes.

Very, very yummy! Will definitely make again... but next time I'll double the cucumbers & half the dill. Just a personal taste preference.

It was absolutely delicious! My sister-in-law, who had never had it before, couldn't stop eating it. It accompanied the Greek chicken and potatoes sheet pan recipe also on the site. Easy and delicious dinner that went down a treat!

I Usually buy this from the  Middle Eastern Guy at the farmers market.   Love it, proud of myself for trying new recipes every week and saved some money.   

I also made Chef John's baba gahoush and loved it too.

It hurts to give it only 3 stars because I really love Chef John's recipes but I had to.  It wasn't the worst but it was far from the best sauce I've had.  Something was missing and I can't put my finger on it.  My family liked it well enough but I thought it was just Ok.  I don't know if it was the use of Greek yogurt but it was just meh.  I'll try it again later on in the year.
