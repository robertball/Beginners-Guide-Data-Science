Today is the third time I have made this pie. I wish I had come and reread the reviews before making this morning. The last two times my pie has marbled and I think that letting the cream cheese chill in the pie crust until very set is a GREAT idea. Also, pouring the top layer on extra careful would definately help. I just wanted to see if anyone else had this problem. OKAY...as far as everything else goes, I LOVE this pie. I double the streusal layer and today I added about 2 tablespoons of flour to pumpkin mixture to help it set a little better. This seems to do the trick as I am usually baking this pie WAY longer than recipe says. I would just plan on leaving the foil on at least an extra 15 minutes so, your crust doesn't burn if you need to contine baking pie.

This was very good!! I read about other people's problems with the layers marbling, so I put my cream cheese mixture in the pie shell and in the freezer for 40 minutes. Then I slowly poured the pumpkin over it. Result? Two perfectly separated layers with zero mixing!!

OH.  MY.  GOSH.  I was making this pie and thinking,  "This is a dangerous pie.  I am frightened of this pie."  And I was right.  Wow it was great.  I used a slightly larger pan, and I'm glad I did, because it would not have fit in a 9" pie pan.  mmmmmmmm.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year!  Instead of using a regular pie crust I made one with gingersnaps and used a springform pan.  It was Wonderful!!

Wonderful!!!  The only change I did was after making the pie dough and forming it in the pie plate, I refrigerated it while preparing the 1st layer.  Then instead of chilling the cream cheese mixture I then pour it into the cold prepared dough then chilled for about 20 min.  Pour your pumpkin mixture in slowly to not disrupt the 1st layer.  Got SUPER reviews from everyone!

This was very good, like everyone says. I made no changes to the pie portion, but doubled the pecan topping part for more coverage (I used a big old pie pan.) Chilling the cheesecake layer for 30 min once it is in the pie shell worked great- no marbling. Baked up evenly, set perfectly. Really impressive pie that isn't actually difficult to make. Served w/bourbon whipped cream at a potluck- won best dessert! Thanks!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year.  My sis-in-law says I'm to bring it every year from now on! I made mine in a deep-dish pie plate so I cooked it a bit longer during each step. I refrigerated the cream cheese layer in the pie shell for at least 1 hr before adding the pumpking layer & the layers remained separate.  I too doubled the streusel layer, but there was some leftover over since my pie plate has a smaller diameter.  Will definitely make again & again & again...

Great recipe! I made it with just a couple of changes. I used Splenda for my diabetic husband.  They now have a blend of brown sugar which is delicious! I used 4oz. more of cheese to help set the layer.  The flavor was fantastic, and the layers turned out picture perfect.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Be warned - this pie is dangerous!  Once you start eating it, you can't stop!  Everyone is already requesting I make it again next year.  I am glad I followed everyone's suggestions to chill the cheese layer and double the streusel layer, because that is exactly what I did.  Other than that, the only change I made was using pumpkin pie spice instead of just nutmeg.

I think the pie flavors are great! I wish I would have came in and read the reviews before making it. I made two for Thanksgiving and my family absolutely loved it! I had the problem with the layers mixing and next time I will probably freeze the cream cheese for a bit before putting in the pumpkin layer. Also doubling the pecan topping is a good idea. I also substituted the Neufandler (sp?) Cheese for cream cheese which has a third of the fat of normal cream cheese. My first pumpkin pie and cheese cake. Mine didn't overflow but it looked like it was going to burst out of the pan. I did have to bake it longer. I do believe that the high altitude had something to do with that. Definately worth a try! :)

I didn't like the flavor of the cheesecake layer.  It was more of a custard in texture than a cheesecake.  I think next time I'll try this with my own cheesecake on the bottom.

Excellent recipe. I didn't have any problems with excess pumpkin mixture - but I did use a 10" shell. Also - I opted for a graham cracker crumb rather then pastry shell. It was a much nicer compliment to the cheesecake layer I think.

This is a great pie to bring to holiday gatherings - and easily satisfies many cravings for cheesecake, pumpkin and pecan pies.

Also - I did bake for about 30 minutes longer than the recipe called for - as it just didn't even come close to setting up in 50 minutes. That may be down to the fact I used a larger shell. Either way - took 1hr 20 min to bake.

Yummy!!! I am a pumpkin pie fanatic...always make a traditional pie, and look for other variations as as secondary pie...this was it this year and what a great pick! Made exactly per recipe...only thing I might try is flavoring the cheesecake layer next time. Only because I don't like traditional cheesecake "taste," totally a personal preference. Thank you for a great recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe and I thank Marbalet for posting it for all to enjoy. For those who say that it takes much longer to cook, try to increase the cream cheese slightly and decrease the evaporated milk to 3/4 cup.   I found that this makes it set much faster and it is still creamy.  I chilled everything after each layer.  Delicious!

Absolutely de-liscious!!! Only problem I had was that mine marbled as well.  I even chilled the cheese layer for an hour in the chilled pie shell....hmmm I'll have to try something different next time...maybe more cream cheese would make it thicker.  It is so so so good though that it didn't matter as it was gone before anyone could notice!

My daughter baked this pie for a pumpkin pie contest at her middle school. It was judged the winner by both the teachers and 4 classes of 7th grade students.
Our family loved it as well.

Absolutely sensational! I ran out of vanilla and used _maple_ extract, and WOW. Also, even though I slowly spooned the pumpkin layer onto the cheesecake layer, it still marbled; but the effect was really quite pretty. If one really wanted to keep the layers seperate, perhaps refrigerating the cheesecake layer longer would help. Overall, a new holiday favorite. I will be looking for excuses to make this. Thank you, Holly!

This pie was very good!  I don't know if I did something wrong or not...but the cream cheese layer rose to the top and the pumpkin mixture was on the bottom!  Either way, it was delicious!

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe.  I too, let the cheesecake filling chill in the pie shell for about 25 minutes and then added the pumpkin.  I then had to bake for about 50 minutes, and I added the streusel--a double recipe of it.  The pie cut perfectly and eveyone loved it.  I will make this every year from now on.

EXCELLENT pumpkin pie!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the streusel topping: I used 1 tbs. flour, 1 tbs. crushed gingersnap crumbs, 1 tbs. brown sugar, and cut in 1 tbs. cold butter.  We love the combination of cheesecake and pie in one.

I made the recipe exactly as it says but doubled the streusel, because I wanted a generous crunchy topping. It turned out perfect! There is just the right balance of pumpkin, cheesecake and streusel. The baking time was right on and I had no problem with the layers mixing together. My husband liked the fact that the pie wasn't overly sweet. I served the pie with fresh whipped cream. Yum!

This pie never fails to get rave reviews and is always requested for holidays...  I've been making it now for a few years, and have one cooking right now, actually.  I use a deep dish pie shell and freeze the cheese layer like others until it's firm set so the layers don't mix.  I make more topping depending on the coverage I get over the top, and any extra pumpkin filling goes into a dish and bakes up like a custard alongside the pie for us to snack on at home.  I never liked pumpkin pie until I made it this way.  Update:  Couldn't get a deep dish shell this year, so I made a crust and baked this in a springform pan and it was wonderful...  All the filling fit this time!  This will be my preferred method now.

This was really good!  I took others' advice and doubled the topping ingredients.  I didn't have any problem with the cream cheese marbling with the pumpkin layer; I refrigerated the cream cheese for 30 minutes and then poured it into the pie crust and put it into the freezer for about 20 minutes.  It got rave reviews from everyone who would try it (several non-pumpkin pies eaters around the tables who wouldn't try it)  Their loss!

I have never made cheesecake before and must admit that I was intimidated by this recipe.  I was interested in making it for thanksgiving but baked a practice one and used my co-workers as guinea pigs :-)  They loved it and I did too!  Not too sweet at all...it was great.  I did add a bit of pumpkin pie spice to the cheesecake layer just to tie the flavors together.  I also don't like nuts in baked goods, so left out those and it was still wonderful.  Since it was a practice run I used a store bought graham cracker pie shell, the 10 inch one.  The pumpkin layer still didn't fit in, I had a bit left over, no worries.  I did put the cheesecake layer in the shell and into the freezer for 45 mins and my layers did not swirl.  I will be making this for thanksgiving...I can't wait to show it off to my family!

We had this pie tonight and I was not as impressed as I had expected to be. All the layers just blended together and none of them really "Wow"-ed me. My guests all said it was good, but I doubt I will make it again. It was good, it just wasn't awesome.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving, and it was such a hit that there were no leftovers!  I am making this again this year for a get together with friends, and these guys have never tried this....I can't wait!  This pie is SO good that you can eat it year round....I might have to make more than one this year so I can keep one at home!

Fancier than your basic pumpkin pie and worth the extra effort. I've made this with and without the pecans and both ways it's been great. It presents well too. People look at it wide eyed and just know it's rich and delicious!

This did not turn out at all like I expected. Should have done a tester pie before taking it to Thanksgiving dinner. It still tasted good. But, the cream cheese layer never set and combined with the pumpkin layer. Also, had to use about a stick of butter with the pecans in order for it to spread over the top. 2 tablespoons is nothing to disolve 2 tablespoons of sugar. Probably would not make again.

This pie had an excellent taste, but like another reviewer I had a hard time keeping the cream cheese layer from mixing with the pumpkin layer.  It looked like it was supposed to be mixed though, and still tasted great.  Big hit at Thanksgiving.

This is a fantastic recipe! I poured my pumpkin in a little too fast and I ended up with a wonderful marbled effect.  The topping really sets the whole thing off.  Will definitely be taking to Thanksgiving dinner at the in-laws. Thanks!

This is one of the best pumpkin pie recipes that I have ever made.  I have been asked for the recipe by many friends.  My son-in-law is always asking when I will be making it again.  The cheesecake layer adds something very special to the pumpkin custard and the streusel topping is a fantastic bonus.  DELICIOUSE!  submitted by:  Doris

Next time I'll add a bit more spice. I put the cream cheese mixture in the pie crust and refrigerated it while I mixed up the other two. Came out just right.

Spectacular!  Everyone loved this pie.  The only change I would make is to take other's advice and freeze the cream cheese layer before adding the pumpkin mixture.  Increasing the streusel topping, as suggested by some, would be overkill in my opinion.  This was nicely balanced to appreciate all the flavors.  This will be a staple on our holiday table.

Soooo good, I made this with 3 our pies and everyone wanted to try this one and not the other pies. I doubled the top layer as suggested and it worked out well. Recipe could probably make two pies as I had left over amounts which helped to make a pumkin pie

This pie was gone in a flash -- my kids raved about it, and my picky three year old ate it and he's not a fan of pumpkin pie.  I left off the pecans because the kids won't eat nuts, but the pie came out perfectly and the recipe didn't need any changes.  Thanks!

WOW! This pie is amazing!  It definitely beats the traditional pumpkin.  I did put it in the fridge to let the 1st layer set a bit.  I spooned the 2nd layer on and it didn't marble at all.  It took a bit longer to bake (maybe 20 mins or so). I also doubled the streusal layer.

This pie was terrific!!!  I always bring 1 pumpkin, 1 pecan pie (grandma's texas recipe), and 1 fruit pie to Christmas and Thanksgiving.  I was told for this Christmas to drop the pecan pie, because this pie takes care of both pies, with NO leftovers (bummer).

This came out wonderful, even better the next day.  I probably served it before it completely set, but it had a wonderful flavor....of course, I add a little spiced rum to my pumpkin puree for a little kick.  Wonderful!

Very good pie.  It's a great blend of flavors.  Next time I think I'd increase the amount of streusel topping to get better coverage on the top.

Pretty good!  Liked the cheesecake part and the topping, only thing I would do differently is use my own recipe for the pumpkin filling, oh and I also made my own crust.  Had this at thanksgiving this year and went over quite well.  Thanks!

Such a great receipe!  I followed the suggestion of a couple other people and allowed the cream cheese filling to chill in the fridge for one hour instead of 30 minutes.  It's the best recipe ever!

This was my 1st time making Thanksgiving dinner, and my husband and I loved this pie! I went upscale on every dish, and this version of pumkin pie will not disappoint! It was fabulous. Very rich, but fabulous! I have never been crazy about pumpkin pie, but I knew my husband loved it so I thought that the cheesecake layer would make this something we both would like. Boy am I glad I tried it. My husband devoured it and swore it was the best pumpkin pie he had ever eaten. I served it a few hours after dinner with coffee and Haagen Daaz vanilla ice cream. Yummy! Bravo Holly!

Let me first say I'm not normally a pie person...for that matter I'm not much of a sweets person.  But in the spirit of Thanksgiving I wanted to make something special for our dessert.  I kinda wanted a regular pumpkin pie, but my boyfriend wanted a pecan pie and he also likes cheesecake.  So, when I came across this recipe I thought it was just made for us.  I can not put into words how much I LOOOOOVED this pie!!!  This was the second pie I've ever made.  The first was made immediately before this one and was a simple pumpkin pie that was going to be donated.  I took the advice of other reviews and slowly scooped the pumpkin mixture on top of the cheesecake layer, and it turned out perfect.  This just might be the dessert that will turn me into a sweet tooth.  In fact, I'm eating a piece of it right now and can't wait to get another helping ;)

I followed this recipe to a T, and it turned out perfect.  Even the baking times were exactly right.  After reading the other reviews, I used a 1/4 measuring cup to gradually spoon the pumpkin layer onto the cream cheese layer - none of it mixed, and I got three distinct layers that looked beautiful when cut.  Excellent recipe!

I've made this pie about 20 times, and it's such a hit with guests that I have not made any other pies in quite a while! Here's my tips for making it even better:
The crust: I use the deluxe flaky crust recipe from the Pie and Pastry Bible, but I use 3x the salt stated in the recipe.
The cheesecake layer: I don't modify this at all.
The pumpkin layer: In addition to the cinnamon and nutmeg, I also add one teaspoon of ginger to mine. Otherwise, no other modifications. After roasting and pureeing the pumpkin, I strain the puree to remove as much water as possible.
The pecan streusel layer: I use about twice as much as the recipe states, and I have a secret ingredient I started using a few pies ago that really sets it off. Chopped bacon! Each one of my pies has 4 strips (not the thick kind) of cooked bacon finely chopped into the streusel mix. I'm guessing after some of you try this, you might even want to use more bacon!

How to keep the layers separate: Chill the cheesecake layer in the crust before adding the pumpkin mixture. I usually have mine in the freezer for a while. When adding the pumpkin mixture, pour slowly over the back of a serving spoon. Obviously it should not be warm, however, there's no need to refrigerate it (you can though).
The cook time: I find the cook time to be about right for a somewhat shallow pie. If using deeper glassware, you will need to cook longer, and at a lower temperature to avoid overcooking the crust.
The prep time is a lot longer than stat

I am making this pie for the 6th time & have learned to make a few small changes that improved an almost perfect pie. First, as others commented, you have to chill the cream cheese layer in the fridge or freezer for a half hour prior to adding the pumpkin in order to get a nice layered effect. I also recommend doubling the strudel or you will not have enough to cover the top of the pie nicely. I found the cream cheese layer to be pretty tasteless so I added a about 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice & a bit of fine orange zest to the cream cheese mixture. It did not overwhelm the pumpkin layer & the brightness of the orange zest complemented the other flavors nicely. Lastly, all of the flavors in this pie improve greatly if you make it a day ahead. The 1st time I tried this recipe, I baked it in the AM and served it that evening. It was good and all my guests liked it. The next day we had another slice that evening & everyone noticed that it had so much more flavor. An extra day let the flavors shine through and I like being able to make it ahead knowing it only gets better with time. This pie is everyone's favorite & I no longer have to make a cheese cake & a pumpkin pie to satisfy everyone dessert wish at Thanksgiving time.

this is a wonderful pie -  my daughter has made it twice this year! i would give it five stars, but i really want the pecan topping to be more like glazed pecans (like the top of a pecan pie), and less like a crumble.

I'm not usually  pumpkin pie fan, but I made this for a friend and it is one of our all-time fav recipes. I always double and make two. I also double the pecan topping for each pie, add 2 Tbs. flour to pumpkin, and bake a little longer than suggested.  Amazing Recipe!

This was really, really good!!  I did make more, thicker cheesecake layer, as per other reviews, and cooled it as well before the pumpkin layer.  I found the pumpkin to be quite runny, but it turned out awesome, and doubled the streusal, as that is what the recipe and the picture are.  The recipe even made enough for 3 eight inch pies, as that is all I have.  Will definitely be making again and again!!

I made a few changes I used a graham carcker crust in a springform pan. I also soubled the crumble recipe and used 3T of oats instead of the nuts. I also added a little ginger to the pumpkin mix. turned out great.  next time I will double the cheese mixture for a fuller bottom layer.

I made this for Thanksgiving and the family loved it so much they requested it at Christmas. The cooking time does need to be adjusted. My pie was in the oven about 25 minutes longer than the recommended cooking time. I also put the pie in the freezer for about 45 minutes before I poured in the pumpkin layer. I serve it with Pumpkin ice cream.

DELICIOUS! Made this for Thanksgiving and it was well received by everyone. I highly recommend that this pie is served as chilled as possible for best taste and texture. Also, Be careful with the layering because it's very easy to end up with more cheese than pumpkin if your pan is at all shallow. Other than that, the previous tips to chill the cheese portion and double the streusel are right on the money. Thanks for a great pie!

EVERYONE LOVED THIS!  Somehow the pecans didn't cut it for everybody though - I made 2, one with and one without.  Everyone agreed the filling was superb (and that's even with my authentic non cream cheese cheesecake made with ricotta & eggs sitting on the table)

I had a lot of problems with the struesel topping. I'm not sure if the butter should be softened at all. I normally make struesel by cutting up pieces of butter straight from the fridge, then mixing with my hands. Other than that, the pie was delicious! No burnt crusts, and not too rich.

Really good pie.  I would recommend adding a little more sugar to the cream cheese mixture, my husband said it was a little sour.  I also doubled the pecan topping and that went over well with my guests.

OMG!! This is a really great pie! We all were disappointed when this was gone! Just one tip though...regarding the struesel topping...make sure you have blended the butter through out the sugar mixture. That way it ALL melts and you dont have any sugar just standing there.

I really wanted to like this recipe, especially after all the rave reviews, but my first attempt wasn't a success. The three layers were each tasty on their own, but even though I placed the cream cheese mixture/pie shell in the freezer for 40 minutes, it rose to the top of the pie while cooking. It wasn't a marbleized effect, just messy looking. The pecan topping covered it nicely, though. I added .25t maple extract along w/ the vanilla for the cc layer and cinnamon to the topping as others suggested, and it was very good. I did have leftover pumpkin but I just made a smaller pie w/ it so no biggie (and I followed the Libby recipe--this one seems a little bland). 

I guess I just expected more of a "wow" factor for the extra work involved.  Also, I think this is meant to be served after chilling to set it. I will try this again because the pictures look so impressive and as I say, the layers are tasty, but since mine blended together it was just too much going on taste-wise.

I was never a huge fan of pumpkin pie during the holidays - this is a FABULOUS alternative and so easy to make. It will be appearing at all Thanksgiving meals from now on!!  (I did have an issue with the marbling, but will try out the suggestions to eliminate that - either way it's still yummy!)

I'm digging this pie pretty hard. I went the route of chilling the cheesecake layer for an hour then freezing that layer in the crust for another half our or so. it came out perfectly. also, adding  2T of flour (as suggested by an earlier post) was key. i'm using this pie as my birthday cake so i'm stoked it came out well :) thanks for this recipe!!

I did get a little mixing even though I poured the cheesecake mixture over a frozen pie crust and left that in the freezer.  The pecan topping though hid any imperfections.  The taste was really great, although next time I think I'll add some cinnamon to the topping.

Part of my cream cheese mixture rose to the surface of the pie, but I think that was just human error and not the recipe.  The topping covered up the mistake nicely, so you almost couldn't tell.  Next time I will chill or freeze the cream cheese longer (until very stiff) and pour the pumpkin in more carefully.  All in all it was a very tasty pie.

Originally made this for my hubby, who loves cheesecake but isn't a huge fan of traditional pumpkin pie...it was a hit!  Have since made it for 2 holiday gatherings, and am ALWAYS asked for the recipe.  A bit of work, but SOOO worth it.  Thanks for sharing!

This pumpkin pie was great...even people who did not care for pumpkin pie in the past gobbled it up. The only problem I had was that there was too much pumpkin mixture for the 9" pie shell (store bought) so next time I will make 2 pies. I had taken the advise of one of the reviews and scooped the pumpkin pie mixture onto the cream cheese slowly and it worked like a charm, it did not mix into the cream cheese layer. Will be serving this on again & again!!

After having pretty much sworn off pumpkin pie (had a few too many store-bought ones growing up), I made this and I was impressed!! Cheesecake and pumpkin pie all in one... does it *get* any better??

I didn't have any problems with the two layers mixing, and the streusel layer is the thing that takes this from a really good pie to a really great pie! Definitely making this again!!

This was the first of my four Thanksgiving pies to disappear--to rave reviews. I was skeptical at first, the pumpkin mixture seemed too runny, but it baked up wonderfully. The streusel is an elegant touch. I added an extra tablespoon each of flour and brown sugar to give it a little more body, and it came out perfectly. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This was amazingly good! My husband said I’m only allowed to make this pumpkin pie ever again. I did double the topping based on reviewer feedback. Thank you!

Delicious! I could definitely taste the cheesecake and it was interesting, but paired well! I tweaked a few things including adding 2 tablespoons of flour to the pumpkin mix, as well as 2 more eggs if you really want to firm it up. I would also freeze the cream cheese mix after setting it into the pie crust until it is solid enough to marble.  I would also double the amount of cream cheese mix and double the streusel layer. I also had to get two 9 inch pie crusts and make 2 pies, as all of this could not fit in one pan. Overall it was very delicious and I would make this again with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream to top!

This pie is absolutely amazing and i got so many comments on it. I did find that I had to cook it 20 minutes longer then the recipe called for but it was worth the wait. i did add double the topping. I did have the problem of the bottom two marbling.

This is a fantastic pie and I will definitely be making it again! The only changes I made was after I put the cream cheese layer in the crust was to refrigerate it while I made the pumpkin filling. I was tempted to marble it intentionally.... maybe next time! :)

Now this is a sweet little pie! We all loved it. After making and adding the cheesecake mixture, I stuck in the pan in the  freezer for about 40 minutes. Then adding the pumpkin layer stayed nice and separate. We love pumpkin pie – – but this a new favorite!   Streusel on the top was like icing on the cake!   And what is pumpkin pie without a little whipped  cream?  Now you've got the cherry on top! Delightful!    All simple to make and so so tasty! Thank you for a really great recipe! (Btw,  The cherry was a metaphor – – but you can add one if you'd like! ) ????

I used a Keebler 2 extra slices graham crust (10") & it was full to the top & perfect. I doubled the pecan mixture on top (1 small bag = double the amount of pecans), but it isn't necessary. I served mine warm (was out of town until just before dinner) & it was really good, but I imagine it would be much better out of the fridge the day after.

My review is only on the streusel topping. Don't make the mistake I did and use "softened" butter.  The streusel was not crumbly, but too wet.  It was placed on the cheesecake in clumps and it was sooooo ugly!  However, it did taste good.  I will go with what I know and use cold butter next time.

Nice change from regular pumpkin pie. After reading the reviews I was very concerned about the recipe being bland. I used 1 tsp vanilla and added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the cheesecake layer. For the pumpkin layer I had too much filling, next time 1 cup pumpkin and 3/4 cup evaporated milk, I used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice in the filling. For the pecan topping I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. To ensure defined layers, I gently spooned the pumpkin mixture on top the cheesecake layer. Mine baked in 60 minutes total, I then turned off the oven and let it sit for another 15 minutes, refrigerated overnight and served with whipped cream. Really tasty!

I apologize - I try NEVER to rate a recipe without trying it just as it is written.  However, I did not this time.  I was just looking for a jumping off point.  
Used my usual pumpkin pie filling recipe (had a lot of extra - baked in a small dish for my kids who never eat the crust anyway).  Made the cream cheese layer as described.  Put into dish as so: 1/2 of pumpkin mixture, then dabs of 1/2 the cream cheese mixture and swirled them together.  Then the other 1/2 of the pumpkin mixture, dabbed with the remainder of cream cheese mixture and swirled together again.  Did not make the streusel layer.  Delicious and beautiful.

Soooo yummy. Got wonderful raves when I made it for thanksgiving dinner!  Definitely cool the cheesecake layer before adding the pumpkin layer. I did double the pecan layer. I also baked it in a store bought graham cracker crust. And used 1/3 less fat cream cheese. So good!

Love this pie! This year, I left off the pecan topping, but I have made it as directed in the past.  Really good both ways!  I prepare the cheesecake layer the night before and leave it in the freezer.  Never had a problem with the layers mixing.  Not sure about the people who say to double the bottom layer...it takes up half the pie as written.  Filled the pumpkin layer to the brim, and still had a cup or so left over.

I used to make homemade pumpkin pies and my family loved them. Then I started making the double layer and they no longer liked the regular pie. Last year I made this pie and my family no longer wants the double layer pie they only want this pie. It is delicious.

YUM! My husband said this was the best pie he has ever tried! I doubble the recipe to make two pies, and one of my pies sank in the middle under the pecan streusel and the other did not. I'm not sure why that happened. I think that was my error and not the recipe. This is going to be my official pumpie pie recipe. I think it's amazing :)

This was pretty good, but I thought the cheesecake layer was overpowered by the other layers.  I might increase the cheesecake layer next time. Overall, a good pie that looks like it was a lot of work (it's really not though!).

I was a little nervous making this pie, as I'm not a huge fan of pumpkin pie, but this is the pie I will be making from now on.  It was delicious!  I refrigerated the cheesecake layer for about an hour in the pie crust and my layers stayed separate.  Also, I doubled the topping ingredients and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy, however I really couldn't taste the cream cheese over the pumpkin, so it was just like a normal pumpkin pie to me.  However I did do as other reviewers recomended and once I put the cream cheese layer in, I popped it in the freezer.  It created a BEAUTIFUL result.  WARNING:  This will make one VERY full pie dish, I ended up using making two pies out of this recipie and it turned out perfect.

wow, this pie was GREAT. not too sweet, not too rich, just perfect. i had people who didn't like nuts or the usual pumpkin pie who loved this. i made a few adjustments....i added a little pumpkin pie spice to cheesecake layer, and also to pumpkin layer, and...wait, all three layers! As suggested, i added 2T flour to pumpkin layer, and I also doubled the pecan topping, but next time i will not double the flour in it, it didn't seem to "melt" as well when baked....but it still tasted fantastic. This recipe is now my favorite, and i can't wait to have an excuse to make it again! Oh, and there was alot of pumpkin filling left, even though i used a deep dish pan, so i used it and extra pie dough to make a small pumpkin tartlet on the side.

This pie was very good.  Everyone loved it but me.  However, I am not a pumpkin pie fan at all.  So to say I liked this pie is a big deal.  I will plan to mix the layers next time I make it and see how it turns out.

This is the best recipe of all the Paradise Pumpkin Pies on this site.  The only thing I do differently is add one full cup of chopped pecans to topping instead of the 1/2 cup.

I loved this pie and will make again!  I followed earlier suggestions and made a double batch of the topping and added the 2 tablespoons of flour to the pumpkin mix.  I also added a teaspoon of pumpkin spice, just because I like the extra flavor.  It came out well and everyone who tried it liked it and asked for the recipe.

I hate pumkin pie but I adore cheesecake, so I hoped the layering affect would meet somewhere in the middle for me. With a small scoop of vanilla ice cream, and the pie still warm... it still was too pumpkiny. I think the recipe is fine, its just my taste buds that are off!

Made this last night and, while it came out well, it didn't especailly "wow" me. Overall, the cheesecake layer didn't have any taste of its own and if blindfolded, I don't think you could tell that you weren't eating a regular pumpkin pie. Like others, I found that it had too much filling for just one pie, and that it required about another 10 minutes of baking to finish it off. The crumbles on top were a nice touch and could be added to any pumpkin pie recipe.

This made far too much of the pumpkin mixture.  I poured most of it in, and while cooking, it overflowed in the oven.  I had to take the pie out and actually dump some of the mix down the sink.
I cooked it for waaaay longer than called for, and the toothpick was NEVER clean.  I cooked it a ridiculously long time.  I couldn't keep it in the oven any longer, or else the bottom of the crust would have burned.  The pie was still jiggly when I took it out.
It got firmer while in the fridge, but the pie layer still wasn't a great texture.  
I made double the streusel recipe, and the amount was perfect.
My husband thought it was pretty good.  
If I hadn't had such a pain in the  cooking it (and cleaning up after it), I might have given it a better rating.

A really refreshing change to the old favorite, but continues with an exciting combination of a cheesecake-like layer with struesel topping.

So good. I've made it for a couple events and even when I "messed it up" (put things in out of order) it was REALLY good.

O my goodness! This pie was my first attempt at a pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving this year and it was a hit! It is truly heavenly, and the smell while it is baking is what memories are made of!

This is the best non-traditional pumpkin pie I've tasted in a long time.  Easy to make, but a little time consuming BUT so worth the wait!!!  I even used fresh pumpkin instead of the can stuff.  Thank you for sharing a wonderful recipe! This is a definite for the Holidays!

I made this for a Thanksgiving pie contest and won the GRAND Prize. It is wonderful and everyone loved it.
