My boyfriend loved this!  I was a bit skeptical because it looked too easy, but I was pleasantly surprised.  Added chopped onion, garlic powder, salt and pepper while browning the meat, and added about four dashes of chili powder after adding all the other ingredients. This is a perfect recipe for someone who is busy; it is simple, fast and delicious!

This is a great recipe and I was right along with the skeptics who said they were too leery of anything this easy.  Amazing flavor and less than 5 minutes mixing time with another 5 to heat through.  Don't be too wary to give this one a try!

I just made this for supper and we loved it. I served it without any liquid (there was quite a lot in the pan, so I drained it out), over tostitos chips and topped with shredded cheeses. Delicious and so quick and easy to make.

My family loved this.  I added 3 tablespoons of sour cream and a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce.  Also put some cheddar cheese, dollop of sour cream and chives on top, because our little one likes to "make food pretty".

This was basically just another Chili recipe with minestrone soup.  Was not bad by no means, but will not make again, as I already have a Chili recipe.

This was the quickest meal I've ever cooked, and it tastes great!  I had some cooked frozen beef in the freezer, so the entire meal was ready in 5 minutes.  I'll be definitely be this stew again!  *I didn't have minstrone soup on hand, so I tried Italian Style instead.  I don't know if it makes a difference, but it was good!

Sorry, but we found this only okay.  I think the minestrone soup in it was weird.

I took this to our church potluck and served over rice -- so quick, easy, and affordable.  And by using organic soup and tomatoes, it's not even that bad for us!

Instead of tomatoes, I use 1 can of mild Rotel  and 1 regular Rotel. For some reason it tastes better with Campbell's Minestone Soup than other brands.
We put it in a crock pot (after browning the meat) and serve it the first day of camping trips so people arriving at different times get a hot meal.

I LOVE this recipe! It is sooo simple but soooo yummy!  I usually half the recipe so I guess mine is just 1x4, but it still makes a lot and it is delish! Very good on a cold day. Thanks for sharing!

I loved it because it was super easy to make a great time saver. But I found it lacked something. Maybe next time I'll add some spices. Overall it was good.

Sounded too easy..but tried it and got pretty good feedback from the family.  I didn't use as many beans as the recipe called for and added corn, sour cream, & Mexican-blend cheese.  It's not what you'd cook for the president, but awesome for rainy days when you don't want to spend hours making dinner! Flavor was suprisingly good because of the minestrone.

Fast and Easy. Great recipe if you are trying to get away from making chili.
