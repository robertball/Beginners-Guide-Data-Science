Very tasty and authentic. I didn't have a small scoop so I used a butter knife and gently twisted the tip into the zucchini and it cored it out perfectly. I had to use more tomato soup and stewed tomatoes (plus I added water to make the sauce more liquid to cover all the zucchini in the pot) also I brought the sauce to a slight boil before I added the zucchini. Otherwise perfect!

This is a good base recipe for Lebanese Koosa, however, there's 2 big things missing:  dried crushed mint and Lebanese yogurt (Leban).  Allll Lebanese I know eat this with Leban on top and generously sprinkle crushed dried mint on top.  With these two additions, which are essential, it's very good.

Mix the spices, rice and meat with tomato sauce and stuff the zucchini with it.
Add water instead of tomato sauce to cook the Zucchini.
The inside of the zucchini That was removed can be added to the left over mixture of rice meat and tomato sauce and cooked on low medium to make rice Zucchini a la libanaise, another dish!

I loved them. My family (more importantly) loved them as well.  I did not use canned soup, but my homemade tomato soup, since I try to avoid canned foods as much possible. My son, who is not to excited about Middle Eastern foods in general, (he thinks they are too bland) even liked them. This is something I will make again.
