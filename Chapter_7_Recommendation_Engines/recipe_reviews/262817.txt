Hubby and I are so excited to have found this recipe!  I did an ingredient search for ground beef and Greek yogurt- half jokingly- because that was pretty much what we had in our fridge and I was desperate to not ruin a Saturday with a trip to the grocery store so.... had leftover buns for bread crumbs and was able to whip up this recipe and it was fantastic!  We used veggie broth instead of beef and made a meatloaf instead of meatballs.  Used rice flour for the sauce.  Everything turned out so good!  I don’t even really like meatloaf but this is DEFINITELY something I’ll make again.  Thanks Allrecipes!

I was searching for a recipe to use up some of the fresh mint from my garden.  I mixed the recipe for the meatballs exactly as written, however since I didn’t have couscous or broth I formed the meat into patties and served them to be eaten as sandwiches in pita bread with tzatziki sauce and fresh spinach.  Also, I chose to broil them instead of baking. I think this tasted pretty good, was quick to put together, and I would make again.

I loved this recipe. I did make some changes. I used 1/2 veal and 1/2 ground round. I also added 1 teaspoon of cilantro as well as 2 cloves of garlic rather than powder. I made the meatballs somewhat larger because I only got 24 instead of the amount they said. As for the gravy: I did not feel it was flavorful enough for the recipe. I added a teaspoon of thyme and oregano, salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoon of garlic powder. However, this is a keeper!
