I made this by sauteeing a chopped onion, a handful of chopped mushrooms, half a yellow pepper and 2 cloves of garlic; I added a can of tomatoes, 2/3 can of tomato sauce, salt and pepper and some Italian seasoning. I simmered the sauce until the onions were tender (about 20 mins), then added 1/2 pound of cubed cod (which I had marinated over-night in lemon juice and black pepper). I heated it all until the fish was cooked (about 20 mins again), and served it over pasta with a little grated cheese on top. Delicious! Thanks for the inspiration.

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I made it two times and both times it just tasted way too much like cinnamon soup. The first time I accidently used Dutch cinnamon and thought if regular ground cinnamon was used it would be better, but it didn't change the flavor much. It's just only edible and seems like it's going to be good when you first take a bite, but then it goes bland. I tried adding italian seasonings, more worcestershire sauce, more paprika and some dried red chilis, but nothing seemed to help improve the flavor.

I was disappointed because the reviews seemed good, but my husband says this recipe gets a thumbs down. Quite strange coming from him because he generally likes everything that I make.
Won't be making again. Sorry.

Love this recipe.  I've made it three times in the past four months.  Great for the odd piece of fish that you just found in the freezer;-))  This one's easy to make, and a favorite in our house.

Very exotic recipe. My husband was a bit wary, but he had two helpings. I followed all the directions except I substituted halibut for the cod and did not use the amount of pepper listed. Whoa! I love black pepper and even I thought that was alot. The stew was already spicy enough. Also, this took alot longer to prepare than 5 minutes (between rinsing the fresh herbs and all the chopping) I would make this again though. Definitely warms you up.

With tweaking this is a five star stew.  My husband says it's his new favorite.  I used 1 lb white fish and 1/2 lb scallops, which was very tasty.  Also added sugar and cayenne to round out the flavors.  Substitute broth for water and/or use boullion for flavor.  Also added celery with leaves for more texture.  Next time might add kale.  Recommend cooking the pasta or other starch seperately, since it absorbs the liquid when refrigerated and gets mushy.

Wow!  What a terrific recipe. We used 1T dried parsley & 1 ½ T Italian seasoning (in place of fresh herbs).  We also used vegetable stock instead of water (which was a huge flavor boost).  The cinnamon was the surprise ingredient (we only used ½ tsp. – which I’ll stick with – any more & it would be overpowering).  We didn’t add the fish until 5 minutes before serving.  5 +++

I made the recipe exactly as written but used one cup of orzo instead of the pasta and added onb box of frozen peas to make a scrumptious, thick and hearty one dish meal.  Next time I might try frozen mixed veggies.

This stew is fabulous! I was looking for something unusual to serve the family on Friday during Lent, and sick of making either fried or baked fish.

This stew is scrumptious, and I love that it combines flavors in a way I've never dreamed (cinnamon/paprika/worcestershire). I used 2 tsp dried parsley and 1-1/4 tsp dried cilantro, however, as that is what I had on hand. 

By the way, DH is notoriously NOT adventurous with food (meat and potatoes only!) and he thought it was wonderful.

Fabulous! We all devowered the soup. I hesitated putting cinnamon in the recipe, but it enhanced the flavor without tasting like a "sweet". Thank you for submitting this recipe.

LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this!  This stew was fairly easy to make and super delicious.  I was a little nervous with the inclusion of cinnamon and paprika in the recipe but it added a yummy richness to the stew.  The only changes I made were using 1c. of clam stock in place of one of the cups of water that was called for (just because I had it in my pantry) and I did only add 1tbsp of pepper at the end instead of 2 tbsp. as I was serving it to my family and I knew the kids wouldn't touch it if it was too spicy.  The pasta I chose was 3oz. of orzo and this was a great complement to the dish as well.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I think it would be great served as a course for a holiday dinner or to serve for company on a chilly evening.  I also loved that this stew is hearty yet pretty healthy as well.

Made it almost exactly except used fresh diced tomatoes. Very easy to make and healthy, but the flavor was missing something.

This was delicious! My wife and daughter loved this, and it reminded us of the Thai classic, fried fish with homemade tomato and chili sauce. 

I made it with tilapia, which is very north African, and the earthy freshwater taste came through the spicy stew well. 

I also used a small cinnamon stick instead of the powder. I would recommend this for all stews and curries which use cinnamon, because you can take it out when you feel that the stew has enough cinnamon flavour.

Instead of putting pasta in the stew, I served it spooned over couscous with mint, almonds and red onion. A real keeper!

As most of us do I changed this recipe a little bit...Oh I know, daring!
I used two packets of fresh 'seafood herbs' from Wholefoods instead of the Parsley and Cilantro.
I used chicken stock instead of water and floured the diced fish.
I really cooked the sauce down for about an 1hr or so. This made the flavour nice and rich. 
My husband was impressed and I was too! It really is a lovely winter warmer without using cream and heavy ingredients. 
A Snuggie for your belly.

Loved this recipe! Easy to make. My husband wasn't too sure about the cinnamon, but we really liked it. NO leftovers, so that's always a good sign. Paired really well with Potato rolls!!

Yum!! This was really delicious! I kept the seasonings the same, but changed the fish around a bit. I used 3/4 lbs haddock, 1/4 lb scallops and 1/4 lb shrimp to make it a seafood stew. I didn't add pasta and didn't miss it one bit! I loved it, it's going to be great to eat on Friday during Lent. Anyways, thanks for the recipe!! I will make this again and again!

I love the cinnamon in this soup - gave it a unique and refreshing taste. My husband and I were eating it, commenting on how healthy it was when I realized that forgot the pasta!  (It was still good!)  So I cooked up some white rice and served the soup over a nice mound of rice.  Seems like rice is a better fit with this recipe.  We put a dollop of sour cream on top, which was really good.  I didn't have cod, so I substituted tilapia, which worked well.  My only beef with this soup is that it seemed like the broth was missing something.  Maybe a little thickness... maybe use stock instead of water?

This recipe tasted great!  Shared it with neighbors and friends.  The fish taste does not take over the stew - which is great, because I am not big on fish and this was my first fish stew/soup.    A note - when warming up the leftovers, add water.  The pasta absorbed a lot of it overnight.

This was really good.  I made a couple minor adjustments - I only used half the cinnamon and I just added the black pepper to taste, which ended up being much less than the recipe called for but I didn't measure.  I would keep both those changes when making this again.  I also added some bay scallops, but they just got lost in the recipe and I wouldn't bother next time.  Instead I would up the cod (I did use cod but I think halibut, snapper or even salmon would also work well) to 2lbs.  Other than that, I thought it was great, and if the cinnamon is a little too exotic for you just leave it out (although I liked it).  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as stated, except I halfed the cinnamon as per other reviews, used diced tomatoes, and used whiting I had. This turned out very tasty, and I'll definately make it again. A nice healthy, warm soup on a cold day. Just be careful with the pepper. I used about  1 and 2/3 cups of rotini pasta- good for this recipe.

Because I forgot to buy the Worcestershire sauce I improvised and used Kraft's Hickory smoke BBQ sauce instead. Just a generous squirt. Also, I skipped the cinnamon as I thought it would make this dish a bit sweet. Used a green bell pepper and 2 small smashed green chili instead of paprika. Rice was a nice filler instead of the pasta. Great base recipe

Smells great on the stove, and tastes wonderful! Not your run-of-the-mill flavor combo which makes it a great change of pace. We used sole and salmon, and seasoned salt instead of paprika because I found out too late that I didn't have any. We'll definitely make this again!

Made the recipe as listed and found it bland and boring. I would cut the cinnamon in half, add less water, and try to spice it up more if I made it again.

While I enjoyed the heartiness of this stew, I found it very bland. As per the other reviews, I halved the cinnamon and used half fresh tomatoes and half crushed. I also used fresh cilantro and dried parsley and added some shrimp along with cod. I would recommend adding something extra to give the broth some flavour, perhaps a bouillon cube or something like that..it just has no flavour.

So Yummy!  My husband who never eats left overs, eat this for three nights straight!  My grocery store didn't have halibut so I used bass and it was so tender!
Yum!

Flavor is very good but only used 3 cups of water. 1 Tbsp of black pepper turned out to be a little too much for some people. I would start with 1/2 of that next time. I also added the pasta at the same time as the fish as fish cooks easily.

Sorry, but this was just awful.  The only thing that would improve the recipe would be to leave the fish out entirely.

This recipe was awesome! I went with the changes others had recommended and added a few of my own. When I went to the store they didn't have cod so I tried halibut which worked well. My husband has diabetes so I left out the pasta and added 1/2 cup of whole grain rice and half a cabbage chopped up. The flavor was incredible. Will definitely make this again. A winner!

This was a great soup we all loved it and I didn't change a thing. It would make a great base for almost anything that you might want to add to it. I'm going to try it again with other seafood and maybe some veggies.

This was great - I would decrease the amount of cinnamon by about half.  But otherwise a huge hit at my house!

The idea of a fish or seafood stew does not usually appeal to me but this was a really good tasty and hearty stew.

Very good. I didn't have any of the fresh herbs available, so I added 2 t dried oregano, 1 t dried thyme, 1 t cumin, dash red pepper. Worked quite well! Used tilapia rather than cod which also was tasty. Will make again!

Tried this recipe yesterday, making a few adjustments.
I added slightly less water, 2 cups instead of 6.  It would have made it to watery otherwise.
Followed everything else apart from the last ingredient - 1 tablespoon black pepper.  I think this may be a type error, perhaps they meant 1 teaspoon.  This I added.

Overall result - Excellent, not watery and not overheated with too much pepper, still very peppery so next time would add half a teaspoon. Added cooked penne to bulk it up.
It was full of flavour, great recipe.

It was a very good meal for a dreary, cool afternoon.  I followed everything to the "T".  Found that, for our taste, the cilantro was a bit overbearing and adding the cinnamon gave it a rather spicy taste.  I think I would cut the cilantro in half and maybe not put the cinnamon in the next time.  All in all, however, hubby and I enjoyed a nice, warm lunch on a cloudy, cool day.

I rarely cook fish and this recipe was delicious. However, I deleted the cinnamon completely and added about a tablespoon of hot chili sauce.  I also cut the black pepper in half. This is a tremendously fast, easy, and inexpensive stew that I will surely make again.

This was awesome! The only changes I made were adding some diced yellow peppers with the onion and garlic, one 14 oz. can diced tom. and one 14 oz can tom sauce. I also tossed in a bay leaf and substituted some shrimp along with the fish. Oh, and I let it simmer longer.

Awesome easy recipe, if you don’t have fresh onion or parsley dry will do.

The only thing I did different was used half a teaspoon cinnamon and didn't pepper the pot. I just peppered my bowl to taste.

This recipe was definitely something different for me and the family. All in all, I think it was worth it. We took some suggestions from above. Sauteed the onions, garlic, some mushrooms, some yellow pepper, cilantro, and the crushed tomatoes on low heat for about 20 minutes. Added in some salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Then added the cod, added the pasta, Worcestershire sauce, and paprika. Omitted the cinnamon. Turned out great. Thanks for sharing.
