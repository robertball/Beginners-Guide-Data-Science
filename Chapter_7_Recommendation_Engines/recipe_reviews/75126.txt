This was good. Next time I will cook the onions a bit first since they were too crunchy for my taste. Also, there is no need for all of the steps in layering the mixing. I coated the zucchini and then just added all the rest together. Next time also, I will add more zucchini and maybe one less egg...a little too eggy. and don't be afraid to add some more garlic and cayenne...makes it super tasty. With a few changes, this is a very delicious and special way to do zucchini.

I've made this so many times as a side dish or a finger food cold (cut into squares).  It is always a hit. Recipe should read '3 cups of grated zucchini'. A  half cup of veggie oil is better then all that butter, too. And 1 tsp of oregano would improve the flavor more.  After adding everything I use my mixer to mix things up and spoon into a butter 9x13 glass pan for 30 mins at 350 deg.  It's a never fail for me...this was my Mom's recipe from her Mother :o) .

This was tasty, but an bit on the greasy side. I'd recommend cutting back on the butter. Otherwise, this is a nice side dish as is.

Our family loved this one.  Evidently, my zucchini was smaller that those intended by the author, though, becuase I used an 11x7 baking dish, and it came out just right.  I also doubled the amount of both cheeses.  I found out mid-prep that I'd used up all my fresh parsley, so I threw in a little fresh cilantro, dried parsley and lemon zest.  I'll definitely do it again, but use the fresh parsley.  I also chose to reduce the amount of butter to 2T, and simply stirred in the softened butter, rather than fussing with melting it.  With the additional cheese, I found that it needed to go about 40-45 minutes in the oven.  We all agreed that the brown edges were the best part, and the middle wasn't soggy at all.  What a great way to use end-of-season zucchini bounty!

We absolutely LOVED this! I tweaked the recipe a little. I substituted water for some of the butter and I used more cheese and maybe a little more zucchini than it called for. It turned out like a delicious rich-yet-not-too-dense quiche. YUM!

I just did not like this recipe at all.  I was disappointed because I love zucchini and was looking forward to trying this.  I served it with fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy and hardly anyone ate this zucchini recipe.  I think it was the biscuit mix in it that I just didn't like.

If I could, I would do 3 1/2 stars for this recipe.  It was okay for our dinner (I added chicken per the submitter's suggestion), but I don't think I will make it again.  I felt the texture was a little too eggy and there was too much oregano for me.  When I made this, I shredded my zucchini and used cheddar cheese.

I have brought this to several family gatherings.  Everyone peers at it cautiously and waits for someone else to dig into it.  By the end of the day, there are no leftovers to take home!  It is fail-proof, in my opinion.  Decadent, but still a good way to sneak in veggies!

This recipe was good, but in my opinion, not amazing.  My 2-year-old son liked it, which was a plus.  I would decrease the butter next time, it was too buttery.  Also, I used a homemade biscuit mix, so maybe my results would have been better with regular old Bisquick.

Served this last nite at a meeting and it was a hit.  I used both mozzarella and cheddar cheese, I didn't measure just sprinkled in.

I served it with dinner, but I think it's better as a brunch dish.  Nice alternative use of zucchini.

This was okay.  Mine turned out more like a quiche than a bread, though, which I like but my husband doesn't, which meant I had to come up with a new side dish at the last minute.  Since zucchini varies so widely in size, it is helpful when recipes are specific.  I have zucchini that are 4 inches long and some that are 12-18 inches long!  I picked 3 medium for this recipe, which I think would have been about 2-1/2 cups.  I don't know, from the way it turned out, whether I had too much or not enough.  I'll stick with my zucchini and tomato recipe for side dishes.

This was an alright recipe. I used 2 really big zucchini, sliced. I stuck to the recipe pretty close but I used 3 eggs, that's all I had, and garlic powder. The flavors were alright. Nothing spectacular. And it took 45 minutes to cook, not 30. I probably won't make it again.

So delicious, but very rich. I use half butter and half olive oil. I think you could reduce the butter as well.

Tried this dish because the other reviws were good and really enjoyed it.  As others suggested I cut the butter in half and used one less egg.

This was very easy to make and oh so good to eat.Mine also came out more like a custard though.I too think it's because it didn't state the size for the zucchini's.I just used 1 large one and that might've been the problem.I also had to cook it more than it said.But overall,it was a hit,I'll definitely be making it again.Next time I think I might add mushrooms.

The taste on this recipe was really good.  However, the consistancy on mine was more like a custard and not at all firm.  The recipe does not say what size the zucchini should be.  Perhaps the ones from my garden were too large and added too much moisture.  I will give it another try though.  
Thanks for sharing!

Husband loved it--I thought it was good, but like another review, thought about brunch (not hamburgers).  Will make again when I have TONS of zucchini.

I've made this multiple times.  I usually use a smaller pan than suggested, so it needs to cook longer than 30 minutes.  I always add at least 2 Tbs. of sugar.  Other than that, I fix the recipe exactly as shown.  My family loves this dish!

What an easy and tasty recipe.  My family love me making this.  A great use for our large amounts of zucchini this summer.  I do add some breakfast sausage and or  polish sausage cut up in chunks.  This is going to be one of our summer favs.
