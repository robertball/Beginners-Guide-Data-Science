The recipe was good, not great.  The main reason I give it 3 starts and not 5 is because all of the flavors and textures become one-note after cooking them all together.  If I made it again, I'd use this recipe as the taco "meat" and then add fresh tomatoes and lettuce to the taco shell to get the freshness it needs.  Recommend adding the avocado, sour cream and salsa at the end as suggested in the recipe for the same reason.

Forgot to review these when I made them. Really tasty. I did add the leeks and liked them a lot in this dish

I just made this a little while ago and we haven't even sat to eat it yet but it's a hit based on the fact that my boyfriend is scooping it out by the spoonful.  I had 1 sweet potato and no carrots but I added corn and a jalapeno.  I spiced it even more so ( we like heat) and added water/lime juice as it cooked.
I'm vegan so I left the cheese out.  It's perfect and will make again.

I had a similar dish at a restaurant and this was my attempt to recreate it. It was delicious and had tons of flavor. This was y first time cooking leeks, and after watching a You Tube video I realized it was very easy. They're similar to green onions...nothing to be afraid of! It did get dry by the time I added the sweet potato mixture, so I added some water every 4-5 minutes or so and that did the trick. I will definitely make again! I'm going to look for a sauce recipe that will complement these.

Great option for a veg recipe!! It tasted great with a perfect amount of spices. The only problem was it seemed a little dry, but pico de gallo and guacamole helps with that!

Delicious. Made the recipe just as written, except we warmed the tortillas in the microwave rather than the pan.

We will definitely be having these again. I made a few changes: cooked the spices in with the carrots and potatoes to give them more flavor.  Added 2 cloves of garlic and a habanero pepper for added flavor and heat (we like things spicy). Substituted a yam for the sweet potato since that's what I had on hand, and served them on a flour tortilla rather than a hard taco shelf because that's what my husband wanted.  Topped them off with some lettuce, tomato and a little shredded cheddar. And then I added a vegan green chile "sour cream" sauce. 

Green Chili Sour Cream

    1 cup Cashews (unroasted, unsalted)
    1/4 cup Hot water
    2 tsp Apple Cider Vinegar
    2 tsp Lemon Juice
    1/2 tsp Salt
    1/2 tsp Red Wine Vinegar
    4 whole Green Chiles (peeled and chopped)

Soak the cashews for at least a half-hour and then put all these ingredients in a blender. Delicious!

These were so tasty! I recommend adding a bit of water until you get the level of moisture that you prefer and adding some garlic or garlic powder. Perfect recipe for meatless Monday!

LOVE IT - Made this last night did not take a photo because I used one purple carrot and everything changed colors. 

I am not a fan of black beans but everyone else likes them so I used it. I like my tacos a bit spicer so I added some homemade salsa and that made them Fab-u-lous for me. Like anything you cook you have to make it yours. SO we opted not to spread the quacamole on the tortillas but dolp it on to our tacos. P.S. we also pan toasted our corn tortillas for a bit more texture and authenticity.

These tacos are fantastic. I was skeptical of the sweet potato, for no reason, they really made the dish!  This will become a staple recipe in our home.

The time it took to make this was totally worth it.  But, the leftovers were great in school lunches or after-school snacks. I packed them separately and daughter warmed them up at school (high school) - I sent along some guac and salsa & (flour) tortillas.  Big thumbs up!

These tacos were amazing - so tasty and full of flavour! We didn't have any leeks or carrots, so made them without which wasn't a problem - they were still really yummy. We can't wait to eat these again next weekend!

This recipe was fine but the proportions seemed a little off. I had way too much filling, and I think the cumin and chile powder should have been reduced. I also would have liked about twice as much avocado.

I did not have carrots the first time I made this so I used sweet potato both cubed and the other half shredded.  I also added a can of drained, rinsed sweet corn.  These were great tasting and super easy to make.   I will be making this again and again.

This was really good. I did not add the leeks, but I'll try it next time. I served it on hard taco shells topped with salsa, chopped tomatoes, cilantro, avocados and sour cream. Was super!

This was pretty good but I would put in less cumin.  It got dry while cooking during last stage....so I added some hot water and fresh lime juice to moisten it up.  Important to put all condiments on.  Pretty darn good and healthy!

The sweet potatoes and carrots make this dish way too sweet. Corn would maybe be a better choice than carrots, and leave out the sweet potatoes ..because it already has regular potatoes for texture. Plus I had never used leeks before, I had to ask a clerk at the store for help buying it lol, and then watch a youtube video on how to clean and cut them. Basically, the toppings make this dish. If you add tons of salsa, avocado, cheese, hot sauce, etc...then it drowns out the sweetness. Oh, and the cook times I think are too generous.

I made these twice and they were superb both times. I didn't have the suggested cheese, so I substituted an Italian cheese mixture the first time and extra sharp cheddar the second time. Panela would also work well. Apart from the necessary cheese substitution, I followed the recipe to the letter, and it was a great success. Definitely use the leeks. Also be sure to use freshly squeezed lime juice - the zing it adds is well worth it.

Try these!  They're terrific, and the nutrition is through the roof.    Don't leave out the leeks!
My salsa had gone bad, so I made guacamole with the avocados, adding canned tomatoes, onion and garlic powders, chili powder, a little sugar,  hot sauce, lemon juice, and salt to taste.   I had parsley I wanted to use up, so no cilantro.  I did not have any lime juice.  I made no other changes.    

A caution:  I broke my food processor attachment shredding the sweet potatoes.   Be careful!

My whole family loved this!   It was an oopsie moment when I burnt the meat and needed a substitute.  I made this 1 day ahead and kept it refrigerated to take camping.  We made pudgie pies using tortillas and a pudgie pie maker.  We topped with sour cream, mashed avocado, shredded cheese and lettuce.This also makes a great breakfast burrito with melted cheese if there are leftovers!  The only changes during the cooking process was adding a few tablespoons of water with the sweet potato as it was getting quite dry.  I also used the taco seasoning 1 from this sight.  A definite keeper!

Just made this and it's fantastic! I cut the cumin in half and added all the seasonings in with the oil and carrots, as putting the seasoning in early allows the flavors to get stronger.

Very tasty, and my meat loving husband said he didn't miss the meat! The shredded sweet potato adds a meaty texture and the sweetness balances out the spice. Highly recommended!
