These spread like crazy and are very delicate cookies.  I use Silpat mats for my cookie sheets and I'd recommend them for these cookies if nothing else.  I had to be extremely careful when taking them off the cookie sheet.  They are also very thin but chewy when all is said and done--can't speak to how they hold up day in and day out, since I just made them today.  However, I imagine they crisp up pretty quickly.  I used a small cookie scoop and was able to fit 9 on a sheet but spaced them out pretty well.  You need to with these.  I also cut the spices by about 1/2--I only used 1 tbsp cinnamon, 1/2 tbs of the other spices and am glad I did. I'm convinced the full amounts would've been too much.  I also baked for 9 minutes and allowed to cool on the pan for a few minutes before taking them off.  Thanks for the recipe!

It's a shame this cookie has not been made and reviewed more often.  I have made them several times now, not changing the recipe at all. People! You don't know what you're missing! These are delicious!

I subbed in half a cup of WW flour, and used butter instead of margarine. I found that sticking to the 12 minute mark tended to have the best results, although they're forgiving a little bit in either direction. Nice depth of flavour. Chewy/bit crunchy. Nice cookie.
