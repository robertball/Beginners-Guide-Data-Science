This was an okay recipe. Not sure I'd make it again. Wasn't crazy about the flavor the parmesan cheese gave it nor the basil. I did not use peas in it as I felt it had enough starch with the pasta. Would recommend trying it with broccoli instead.

Any leftover cooked chicken meat can be used and any method of cooking the chicken works too, saute, baked, grilled, etc.

My son said It was good not great-I agree. It was simple to make but was bland- I added extra everything for more flavor. Don't think I will make again.

I sauteed diced zucchini & shredded carrots for about 4 minutes, and let them cool and added them to the mix.  Very good.

I made this recipe exact, only throwing in a good amount of halved cherry tomatoes and I used reduced fat sour cream/mayonnaise. This is good but it could be better. Next time, I'll add more spices to the dressing. The amounts of everything else is perfect. The longer this sits, the better it gets. Excellent lunch pasta salad.

This recipe was awesome! All the flavors melded together wonderfully after sitting in the fridge for a bit. I made a pound of rotini and basically doubled the rest. My teenage son had most of it eaten up by that night. Will definitely be making again.
