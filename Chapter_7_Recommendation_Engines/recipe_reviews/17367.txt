This is a great recipe.  I loved it as is, but my husband hated the bone-in chicken.  I tried it again with boneless chicken and reduced cooking time by about five minutes and it turned out great too.

GREAT...I USED BONELESS CHICKEN BREASTS INSTEAD OF BONE-IN. INSTEAD OF TWO TABLESPOONS OLIVE OIL I USED FAT FREE ITALIAN DRESSING...I WILL BE MAKING THESE AGAIN.

This is a good, simple recipe.  I was worried my picky 6 year old would turn his nose up at it, but actually went back for seconds.  Winner in my book.  There is nothing fancy about this recipe that will make you go "wow" but you know, not every dinner needs to be a "wow" one.  I'll make this again no doubt.

This was really good.  I used low fat italian dressing rather than the olive oil.  I also marinated it for about an hour and I thought the chicken was very flavorful.

This was okay. I used breast tenders instead of bone in chicken. The flavor didn't pack the punch for which I was hoping. My fiance liked it, though, and he rarely likes anything.

Very basic recipe so I added some white wine for more flavor.  Keep basting and then use the sauce for a gravy.

I like but my husband did not. 15 minutes on each side was just a tiny bit too long for the chicken breast halves we used.

Delicious! As other reviewers stated, I used Italian dressing instead of plain oil to add to the dry dressing. I used boneless chicken tenders and added mushrooms, red pepper slices and chopped onion on top of the chicken. Next time, I will marinate for an hour before placing in oven. I will make this again.

Not bad, nice flavor on outside of chicken, bland on inside. I did add some white wine to the chicken added a nice flavor.

I dredged the breasts in flour, dipped them in beaten eggs, and breaded them in Italian-style bread crumbs before putting them into the pan. Then, I poured the dressing mixture over them. I also doubled the amount of the dressing mixture. When I turned the breasts over, I placed a dab of butter over each piece. Came out tasty, but nothing mindblowing. I'll make it again, nice and easy.

excellent taste: not too much, not too little. Easy. I cooked chicken legs. Needed full 50 minutes to cook through. Served with broccoli and steamed, long-grain brown rice.

This is a good, simple recipe for a baked chicken breast. I made just two chicken breasts, but used the full recipe for the dressing mixture since they were quite large.  I lifted the skin and smeared some of the dressing underneath. The chicken was very flavorful and moist with a nicely crisp skin.

This was pretty bland and it took about 10 minutes more to bake than written.  I may try this again but use boneless skinless chicken breasts and marinate them overnight in the mixture.  I wouldn't make it again as written, sorry.

Very tasty and easy to prepare.  I used thighs and drumsticks instead of breasts, and increased the number of servings to 50.  I will be serving this in the future.

Juicy and yummy. Used skinless boneless chicken breasts and added a splash of wine (as suggested by other reviewers). I was concerned about it being too salty so didn't use all of the sauce. Turned out very nice.

A family favorite, thank you for this recipe.  People that don't like saltiness should steer away from this one though b/c it is quite salty.

This was great tasting chicken though I thought the flavor would have gone deeper into the chicken. The oily broth from the chicken is great to baste it with, helped keep it moiste.

My family loved it. I thought the flavor was a little overpowering. Maybe next time I will just do the usual and marinate it in Italian dressing. Not bad,OK for a fast easy entree.

I had an entire chicken, that was cut-up. I wanted enough of the seasoning so I increased water to 4 Tablespoons and the oil to 3 Tablespoons. It also made it thin enough to brush it on. I brushed some under the skin and then baked as directed.

My husband lived it.

Pretty good recipe, and very easy to make!   It doesn't get much easier than this!   Wished I'd slashed my breasts, not mine, but the chickens, to get more flavor inside.   The breasts I had were ginormous.  I think I will do again and try on the grill for added flavor.  

Thanks for the recipe!

I made the recipe using boneless chicken thighs, and the meal was delicious. I'm definitely putting this recipe in rotation with the rest of my favorites.

Used boneless, skinless, and it came out great. Used leftovers for Nachos. I am needing seriously uncomplicated recipes and this fits the bill and tastes good, too.

This was really great! I made it exactly as is except I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I served it over pasta with a salad and garlic toast. Delicious!
