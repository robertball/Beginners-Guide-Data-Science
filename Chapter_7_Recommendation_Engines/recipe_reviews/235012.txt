I used flavored sauce in this recipe and its a good thing I did or it wouldn't have had any flavor at all! Sorry to be blunt but there just wasn't enough of anything in this. This would probably be good if you put it all together and baked it as a regular meatloaf. It would still need some herbs & spices and more onions to flavor it. This is a good place to start!
