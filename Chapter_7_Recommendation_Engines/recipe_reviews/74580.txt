This was delicious among a beautiful presentation.  My hubbie tasted it and looked at me and said "On a scale on 1-5, babe this is a 10!"  I have to admit I did alter the recipe... alot, but this was such a great base.  First off, I butterflied my meat for easier rolling and more tender meat.  Then I marinated my meat for 6 hours in "Puerto Rican Garlic Marinade" from this site.  Since it had the garlic in the marinade, I omitted it from the filling and fried the onions before adding them.  I used the whole package of spinach and it came out perfect!  We had my hubbie's best friend over for dinner and all you heard were "Mmmm's" and praises through dinner.  I served it with "garlicky summer squash" from this site, and I made a parsley-herb rice.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This recipe is awesome!  Pounding, piercing, and a long marinating time make this the most savory, tender flank steak I've ever eaten.  The filling is delicious, and the pinwheel presentation makes this a great dish for company.

We really liked this as is, but I can see many other posibilities. I sliced my steak in half and then beat. Did not have all night to marinate, but several hours produced good flavour. It made two rolls and they cooked in 40 minutes. Would like a sauce to serve with it. Anyone have any ideas?

This is wonderful. I used fresh baby spinach leaves instead of frozen and Parmesan cheese instead of Feta.  Great with mashed potatoes.

Great recipe.  My changes:  Didn't use onion or salt in filling (forgot onion, but it wasn't missed).  I used 5-6 cloves of garlic that I had roasted in olive oil for the spread instead of raw garlic.  A little more work, but the smell of roasted garlic throughout the house is a wonderful hint of the dish to come.

Then to cook I grilled it over high heat on all sides (maybe 10 minutes total) to sear.  Then turned off one side of the gas burners, moved the steak to the "cool" side of the grill and left the other side running fairly hot with the lid closed.  Checked with instant read thermometer until temp hit 120-125 for medium rare.  Let it rest 10 minutes.

This served four of us, three slices each, with a few end pieces left...which didn't last!  We all were sorry there wasn't any more.  Easy, easy dish to make and it looks nice!

Unbelievable.  Didn't know something that looks and tastes so great could be this simple.  As others have noted, cooking time may be a little shorter than indicated.

One thing I added that gave it a little something extra was sun-dried tomatoes.  I also substituted gorgonzola for the feta for personnal preference.

I dont know how this could get any bad reviews. This was awesome! I did not use flank steak though, I used breakfast steaks at my local grocery store because they were sliced really thin.  I made individual pinwheels vs. a roll and slicing it. Delicious!

This is great with a couple really simple changes. I butterfly the meat and after marinating it cover it with a thin layer of cream cheese. I also use fresh spinach and add chopped mushrooms which I sauted along withe the onions and garlic and spread that atop the cream cheese. This is so delicious and looks so impressive. Perfect when company is coming.

WOW! Awesome marinade. I will use it for shish kabobs on the grill next time. Meat was juicy, flavorful and great leftover.   I second the recommendation to saute the onions before, unless you like them crunchy. I left out the bread crumbs because those often make things soggy when stuffed inside meat. Glad I did! The garlic, spinach and feta don't need to be toned down.  Since I only had 3 hours to marinate, I put the meat in the baking dish and poured the leftover mix all over the meat before putting it in the oven. I basted twice during the 50-min. cooking time and the meat came out delicious.   Mix the filling (sans breadcrumbs) when making the marinade and store it while the meat soaks. Cooking when you get home from work is then a snap - fill, roll, bake!

I made this for Christmas dinner and my family raved over it.  I pounded the steaks a little thinner than instructed, probably about 1/4 inch.  Also I took the leftover marinade, boiled it and then thickened it into a gravy.  I doubled the recipe there still were no leftovers.  My husband said that it tasted like a gourmet restaurant.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

I made three of these. The first one per the menu, the second with the addition of a few stips of uncooked bacon to keep it moist, the third with the bacon and some mushrooms. All very good.

Really good! The marinade makes this recipe. I'll be using it for other purposes as well! I didn't use the full amounts of any of the stuffing ingrediants, it wouldn't have been able to roll it! Next time I would use fresh garlic. Just eyeball it. I also used lemon garlic flavored feta cheese, which was good. But, unless your a huge feta lover...just a thin layer will do. Thanks!

Amazing. The marinade alone is really good. I would grill flank steak with this marinade without all the extras if I didn't have the time or energy for the whole production. My only change and I think an important one, is the cooking time. My oven tends to be hotter and I cooked it only for 25 minutes and it was perfect. 1 hour would have ruined it. So I would suggest people check the temperature throughout.

Lots of flavor! It was a bit frustrating trying to roll it up, I think my steak was only about a pound. Despite using a meat mallet to flatten, there wasn't as much to wrap around the yummy insides. I had to tie it was regular twine (how many of you really have kitchen twine?) The marinade really made a difference.

I love this recipe because people come over and they think that it was very hard work when really it is very simple!  I have made this several ways, first using the ingredients  listed here and also with whatever sounded good/ I had in my fridge.  My favorite variation is with whole green chilies stuffed with cream cheese and then wrapped in the flank steak.  Its great in the crockpot with a whole jar of green salsa on top cooked on high for 3-4 hours.  Served with the cooked sauce as gravy.  Any variation of this is great though!

Excellent recipe.  I used gruyere cheese, which was the one I had on hand, and the rest of the ingredients.  Steak was tender, sliced nicely and it looked great.  I served it with white rice and pink beans and a romaine and cucumber salad with olive oil and wine vinegar.  Will definitely try again.

My husband LOVED it. I am a little harder on myself. It defiantly had a beautiful presentation. My husband was so excited about how it looked he took a picture. 

My stuffing came out dry and didn't stick together. It tasted very good, perhaps I got rid of too much liquid from the spinach making it too dry. I will defiantly try to perfect this recipe and try it again

Rave review for this one.  Everyone loved it.  Something came up and my steak marinated for 2-3 days, WOW was it good.  I did add some swiss chard to the filling because I had it on hand.

Absolutely incredible!  Very tender and flavorful.  A bit of work when you are a working mom of three kids, but it was well worth it.  My 3-year old says this is his new favorite meal!

Possibly I marinated too long?  The soy and worschestershire sauce marinade was a little overwhelming, may make again but would readjust amts.

Yummie.  We did this for a pool party, so I wrapped my completed rolls in heavy foil and we did it on the grill.  We grilled it in the foil packets for most of the time, then unwrapped them towards the end and put them directly on the grill for the rest of the cooking.  I can't really give times because we did 4 of these at 2 pound steaks each, but we did them on medium heat and I think they took about an hour or so all together.  The guests raved about them...as did my dad...and he's extremely picky about meat and flavorings.  My onions didn't get crunchy, but I did them in my electric chopper, so they were very fine.  I used the bread crumbs and I think it gave them a little bulk so things weren't too mushy during slicing and the layers held their shape beautifully.  Easy to do and delicious!

This was yummy. It had a lot of flavor, however, my meat turned out very dry, prehaps you should cover the flanks with foil during baking.

This was an easy to prepare dish that looks like you worked all day on.  I was only able to marinade for 4 hours and that was fine.  My cooking time was much less (35 min.) than the recipe.  Check yours when you think in might be half way done.  I will be making it again soon.

This was a great foundation for this cut of meat. I made a few changes, some based on previous reviews, and others to accommodate my own tastes.  First I made fairly deep diagonal cuts on both sides of the meat, to shorten the fibers and marinaded it using a dry marinade mix, extra virgin olive oil, red wine vinegar, and worcestershire sauce, and water. I let that soak for 24 hours. Then I smeared a generous portion of dijon mustard across the inside surface, followed by green onions, nearly a whole box of frozen spinach, 4 slivered garlic cloves, and thinly sliced feta cheese vs. crumbles. I secured it length-wise with one long shishkabob skewer. I also seared the outside in hot skillet prior to baking it. I baked until the inside reached 140 deg. and let it sit for 10 minutes.  After slicing I served it with au jus and sauteed portobello mushroom caps. It was a slice of heaven I tell you!

OH MY!!! I made these for dinner tonight and it turned out fabulously! I followed the directions to a tee, and I am just floored by the flavor. Next time, tho, I won't add the salt to the crushed clove of garlic because there is definitely enough salt from the soy and worcestershire sauce.

My hubby and I love this meal.  We sometimes substitute whole mushrooms and shallots instead of spinach.  Great with a side of mashed potatoes!

OMG!  This was DELICIOUS!!!!
I didn't really change the recipe but did have to substitute some things.  In the marinade, I didn't have any lemon juice but figured it was just an acid to act as a tenderizer, so used apple cider vinegar instead.  I did use 2 cloves of garlic when I made the paste (we love garlic) and opted for fresh spinach instead of frozen.  Had no feta, so used parmesan/ romano/ asiago blend. 

I HIGHLY recommend cooking this in a cast iron skillet.  It seared the bottom of the steak and made it that much better. 

Fantastic!

I served this with steamed broccoli and homemade mac-n-cheese.

This was excellent!  I marinated the steak in the morning and cooked it for dinner- YUM!  The meat was very tender and flavorful.  I had never cooked with Feta cheese before and had quite the dilema at the deli counter choosing- ended up with Greek Feta because they said it was very mild. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I let the meat marinate overnight and used twice the spinach.  It was great!  It's important to roll it up in the right direction.

Very very good. Next time I will marinate the meat for 48 hours. It's a great way to cook a cheaper cut of meat. I used gorgonzola, forgot the breadcrumbs. I didn't sautee the onions as others suggested, don't think it matters. Fiance kept saying 'this is sooo good!' I will make this again.

I've always wanted to try this and it was a success. Maybe it was the feta I used, but it did come out a bit too salty. Also, the flank needs to be VERY THIN in order for it to roll up effectively. Very hearty, and the leftovers were awesome.

I really like this recipe.  My husband calls it "Fru-Fru" so I'm giving it 4 stars intstead of 5.  However the second time I tried it I got a large flank steak and cut it vertically into two slabs.  I then tenderized both and made one of the slabs into pinwheels as per the recipe.  For the second one I took the marinade, soaked some sliced fresh mushrooms in it for a few hours, and then chopped them up a bit in my mini-food processor.  I then used that as the filling for the second half of the flank steak and rolled it into a pinwheel.  My husband LOVED it that way.  I grilled both on the gas grill with a grilling pan so the cheese and mushroom pieces wouldn't fall into my gas grill.  Both versions were really yummy!

WOW!!! This was great. I have seen steak pinwheels on TV before, but had never tried it until now. The feta cheese really makes the dish as well!  I did modify the recipe a little; I put just a small amount of sesame oil into the marinade. Also, the first time I made this I didn’t have any bread crumbs so I used crushed up Caesar salad flavored croutons, and it gave it a really great flavor. My husband even said this was one of the best dishes I’ve ever made him! It was so good I’m making it again tonight :)

This was awesome.  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and red wine vinegar since I didn't have any red wine on hand.  The only problem was that the steak was still too thick even after pounding so the pinwheel had a hard time staying together.  Next time I might slice the steak lengthwise and make two rolls.  My husband said it was gourmet!

Really good.  I sauteed the onions and garlic first in a little olive oil.   Toothpicks didn't work so well.  Next time I will use my small metal kabob skewers or kitchen twine.  I also will cook a little less since we prefer med, this was more on the med/well side.  Thanks for the recipe, I will definately make again.

Very good. I marinated overnight and meat was very tender and good. I didn't have to pound the meat at all. Flank steak is pretty thin to begin with.

I would suggest using fresh spinach though. The frozen spinach always has an off taste.

Next time I'm going to add some bacon bits and sauted mushrooms.

I had to use very thinly sliced top loin because they didn't have flank steak at the grocery store. I also used swiss cheese in place of the feta. The result was outstanding! My husband wants to make the steak again tonight, marinated and stir-fried with veggies. SO SO SO Good! And SO SO SO Easy!Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome!  The marinate gives the steak great flavor!  I didn't marinate it over night only about 6 hours. I also changed the cook time 22 minutes on bake, then about 10 minutes under the broiler to get a nice caramelization on top. came out a perfect med-rare!

This  is a fantastic, company worthy recipe prepared as stated. Second time I made it, I did use reduced sodium soy sauce and  omitted the salt when mashing the garlic.  Just my preference to reducing the salt  which was a little too much  for my taste. I find that people will always reach for extra salt and pepper if they want That little extra. Reducing the salt gives everyone a choice. By the way, these pinwheels freeze exceptionally well and are available to pull out for a quick dinner or for an impressive meal for unexpected guests. Thanks for sharing it with us!

Didn't go over well.  Be careful with garlic...I used too much.  I think provolone or parmesan would be better ...feta turned out too salty.  Fresh baby spinach was very good though.  Marinade good too

Okay, I changed a few things but my husband literally keeps going after the leftovers and saying, "I HAVE THE BEST WIFE EVER!" 

I used venison instead of beef which was great! Iadded 5 cloves of garlic, no Worcestershire and dried mustard instead of wet to the marinade. For the stuffing, I used fresh spinach, scallions and blue cheese instead of feta. It was OUTSTANDING!

My husband and I really liked it. I cooked it for 45 minutes and it came out perfect. I really loved the flavor and ingredients, but I can't give it 5 stars because the meat was a little tough. Overall, I would definitely make it again.

Delish!  I loved the marinade and the filling.  Instead of trying to flatten the entire steak, I split it in half after I marinated it (I didn't slit it) , and then I flattened it to even it out a bit.  It made two nice-sized rolls, and it was easy to work with.  I didn't have frozen spinach, so I used fresh.  I browned some bacon, and then I sauted the onions a bit to take th edge off.   Then I took it off the heat, stirred in the spinach and bread crumbs.  I browned the rolls before I put them in the oven; it made a nice, "crispy" brown outisde.  Then I reduced the marinade to make a sauce, too.  My ENTIRE family, including a two and a seven year-old loved it, too.

With other ratings, I thought this would turn out better.  Could be that I didn't pound the meat enough because it was tough.

This was very good, although next time I will saute the onions before putting them on the steak as I didn't really like the crunch they gave. The marinade is great!

This was alright. I didn't have garlic cloves, so I sprinkled garlic powder on the steak before putting on onions, bread crumbs etc.  It was just too strong on the flavors (too much garlic), and my husband took two bites and that was it for him.

I think I chose a bad piece of meat, because it was tough.  That's not the recipe's fault, it's mine.  I absolutely LOVED the marinade.  I use it for many other pieces of meat now.  I also loved the filling of the steak.  Next time I might speak to a butcher or something... I've never been good with steak.

My picky family loved this.  I pounded the daylights out of the meat first with a marble rolling pin, and then marinated it for 48 hours.  I also used tomato basil feta instead of plain.  One thing I would do different next time, is to cut off the membrane covering the meat.

this one is a repeat for sure.  I only had time to marinate for 8 hrs.  The meat was very tender (for flank steak) and we could cut it with a fork.  I doubled the garlic and used a whole 10 ounce package of spinach (thawed and well drained).

I'm not sure what went wrong with this recipe.  The time that it said to cook...and the degrees...seemed a little rare for my tastes....but by the time it was cooked it seemed really tough and I couldn't seem to keep the "pinwheels" from coming undone and falling apart.  I wondered if maybe I pounded the meat too much in the beginning?....anyway...it was such a disaster I probably will not attempt this one again.

The marinade for this is very good!  I would have given it 5 stars, however, I didn't care for the dried breadcrumbs.  They got soggy and didn't blend, in taste, too well with the feta and spinach.  I will make again, however omit the breadcrumbs.

Awesome.  My 'must eat healthy' man loved it.  It was easy to prepare and had great flavors.  The marinade was tasty and the steak moist.

After reading the reviews on this dish, I couldn't wait to try it.  I was a little disappointed with it.  I followed the directions perfectly and had purchased thinly sliced flank steak to use for the recipe.  The steak was tender at first but as the meal continued, it became slightly tougher.  The flavors were very strong which I normally like but it was a bit overwhelming and by the middle of the meal we felt we had enough.  If I were to make the recipe again, I would choose a different cut of meat...perhaps new york strip thinly sliced.

WOW!  I don't rate recipes from here, but even my husband said I needed to rate this one a 5!  I put Cream cheese instead of Feta and it was great!  My husband said this was the best meat I've ever made and I need to make it for his mother when she comes to visit.  thanks for such a great recipe!

This was a great dinner, and a wonderful marinade that I've used for other meats also.  I used herbed cream cheese instead of feta and the kids ate every bite, not noticing the spinach rolled in!!  Good way to get kids to eat spinach!

I halved the marinade ingredients because the flank steak weighed a little less than a pound. I marinated it overnight, which seemed too long as the meat seemed to "cook ." I dont have a meat mallet, so I butterflied the steak by laying it sideways and carefully slicing in half. I should have followed my instincts and used a hammer + waxed paper, because it was still too thick to be easily rolled. So ... don't skip this step. Adding salt to the garlic to make a  paste was unnecessary, it's already got salt from the soy sauce The breadcrumbs didn't add anything;  I'd skip them next time. I used fresh spinach leaves, which made it harder to roll. Frozen or lightly sauteed would be better. It did not slice up into beautiful pinwheels, that was my fault! All my b****ing aside, this tasted pretty good! Give It a whirl.

Like a few folks, I modified this. I butterflied the flank, pounded it a little thinner.  Roasted cloves of garlic and mixed that with olive oil and salt to make a paste. Spread that along the steak and added spinach leaves and fresh mozzarella slices.  Rolled it up, tied some twine around the disks to keep their shape and grilled it for 5 mins on each side.  so as not to lose the cheese, I placed foil down first. We let it rest for about five minutes. Probably should have waited 10 but we were so hungry!! It was nummy!

We found this to be very sour and bitter.  Maybe better on the grill but lacking by oven roasting.

I served this at a dinner party and it was wonderful! Everyone loved it and of course, that pleased me!
The only changes I made in the recipe were adding a strip of bacon to the outside of the pinwheel roll, sautéing the onions and roasting my garlic. We used fresh spinach. Someone said theirs was dry, so did this as a precaution. I kept tabs on the internal temp and pulled it out at 145. It was perfectly cooked and that was at the 50 minute mark. I did double the recipe so had two side be side in a baking dish.
I beat the steak quite a while to make it thin and also made my slits in the meat before marinating. I had no problem rolling mine and they were stuffed with cheese and spinach! Tied each roll with kitchen string. Very tender and flavorful. We marinated almost 24 hours.
We loved the flavor! I served it with garlic mashed potatoes, a salad and a green bean dish.

Made this with my always hungry teenage son.  Used gluten free Italian bread crumbs so celiacs could eat it.   It was absolutely delicious.  I showed the butcher the recipe on my phone, and He sliced dhe flank steak into two very thin layers and I believe he put it through a tenderizer.  He showed me to lay the two pieces  end to end  overlapping a bit so we could roll from the bottom layer.  We marinaded it in a ziplock rolled up like he said so that we could just unroll it the  next day on the pan. He gave us some twine.  Fun easy cooking project.  We used more spinach than advised and goat feta.  Soooooooo good.  Not a crumb left.  I wish I could eat it again now!

I confess that I have never made, or purchased flank steak until I saw this recipe, so I was curious, bought some flank steak at Costco and marinated the steak exactly as the recipe called for, but only for about 6 hours.  The only thing different I did was to place about 8 cloves of garlic and 2 tblsp of olive oil in a measuring cup and microwaved it for 1 min. and then mashed real good before spreading it on the flank steak.  I sprinkled a little bit of Goya Adobo (my all time favorite seasoning) over the spinach and then added Kirkland (from Costco) Oven-dried Orgnanic Roma Tomatoes over the spinach and sprinkled generously the feta cheese over that, rolled it up, secured it with tooth picks and baked it for about 50 min.  OMG! my husband, who God Bless him eats anything I put in front of him, had that look in his eyes, like many years ago, when it wasn't the food he adored, said "this is awesome!, OMG this is so good! what else I can I tell you folks, it was a great night!

A huge hit! Made two rolls and changed one a bit for those who don't care for feta - mozzarella instead.  Also added chopped onions and mushrooms on top of fresh spinach.  They all love it and are asking to have it again soon!

This was fantastic!  I used venison, and the marinade took away the gamey flavor.  YUM!

this is excellent. The marinade ROCKS...I even made this marinade for shrimp and we grilled them I just added a bit of brown sugar, A-mazing!!! OK, If you have picky eaters like I have, forget the feta. Use the 'italian blend' shredded cheese instead. WOW it's good!!!  I also add ROASTED red peppers! We absolutely LOVE this !!! They are incredible when grilled!

THIS IS AMAZING!!! My boyfriend said it was the most delicious meal he's ever had. There's so much flavor in every bite, and the steak is so juicy and delicious. It tastes like a fancy, restaurant quality meal but it is surprisingly easy to make. Try it. Rolling it can be tricky, so be sure to pound out the steak really thin and try not to overstuff it. Also, kitchen twine and a meat thermometer are a must... I baked it at 425F for about 50 minutes and it came out perfectly medium well!

I have made these a couple of times, they are easy and look fantastic when done.  Definately a good recipe to use when you want to impress someone and not make a huge effort.

Absolutely yum. Did a mod version because I didn't have all ingredients. I marinated overnight in Soy, Worchestire sauce, A1, onion powder and garlic powder. Stuffed with sliced garlic (about 5 cloves), onion, spinach, bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, fresh basil and bacon. So yum! Huge hit with fam! Will def. be making again! Thanks!

The flavor was delicious, but the meat was dry, even though I reduced cook time to 50 min. Will decrease the cook time even more next time.

We served these to a guest and they were fantastic.  I had to beat the shenanigans out of the flank steak, so much that my kitchen was shaking.  I strongly suggest that activity after a long day at work, exhilarating, truly.

Excellent. A lot of flavor. I poured a little extra marinade over before cooking. Used fresh spinach and Italian bread crumbs.

This was a little bit of a challenge for me, but when I make it again, I'm sure I'll do fine.  The marinade was great!  I just had a hard time rolling all of that filling.  I also don't think it has to be cooked so long - check it often.  My presentation was off, but it was delicious and I will definately make it again!

Great recipe! I made this for a cocktail party and it got rave reviews! I did not make a paste with the garlic, instead I minced it and spread it on the meat. I used Parmesan cheese instead of Feta. I also cut into thinner pinwheels since it was for a cocktail party but can't wait to make it for dinner one night!

Great recipe - my sons girlfriend, who is not a spinach fan requestes this steak on a regular basis.  It is a tasty easy dish with great flavor - Since I found it hard to roll the steak - I just layed it flat in a 13x9 pan and placed the filling on top then baked it in the oven for about 30 minutes - easy and tasty

This was a big hit.  I didn't use bread crumbs (completely forgot them) but it was still amazing.  I will be making this over and over again.  I did NOT add salt, and I don't think it needed any.  It was perfect the way it was.  Thanks!

I followed exactly as written and it was amazing..definately restaurant quality! Make sure you pound it thin enough..I didnt so It could have been better but that was my fault.This steak..was just bursting with flavor!! Also, dont skip the bread crumb it really added nice flavor and texture

Excellent, very tender.  I decided not to use bread crumbs since wasn't sure how that would add to the flavor, but otherwise followed recipe exactly.  After 1 hour of cooking, meat was medium.  Nice presentation.  Make sure you let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing.

Delicious and pretty!  My husband LOVED this and suggested it be my next meal for company!  I substituted one small zucchini for the spinach.  I grated the zucchini and squeezed it dry with paper towels.  I also put about 1/4 of the bread crumbs, feta, and garlic across the top of the roll prior to sliding it into the oven.  This was a very easy recipe to follow!

FANTASTIC-- I added a little fresh basil to the marinade, and added a small amount of riccota cheese to the spinach/feta mixture to keep it together a little better... and it was WONDERFUL.

I gave this a 5 even though I didn't use the whole recipe. I just used the marinade only......It was AWESOME and so tender with only a 7-8 hr marinade. I grilled it, then sliced it and made quesadillas with Mexican Blend cheese....Oh so YUMMY.

Fantastic...need I say more. I did, however, only use the marinade portion of this recipe as I was short on ingredients and time. So delicious though. Definitely will make again and next time as the whole recipe.

this is FANTASTIC! my children, who don't normally like eating meat, can't get enough and its wonderful for company.  i have even made several at a time (marinade is enough for 2-3x the steaks) and frozen them to cook later, just defrost and cook normally.  i do put in less bread crumbs, more garlic, and more spinach.

I made a few changes, but it still turned out delicious.  Instead of bread crumbs and feta, I used finely minced, sauteed mushrooms.  I also did not put additional garlic on the flank steak, since the marinade seemed garlicky enough already.  This was soooooo yummy!

This was really easy to prepare, and made a fancy presentation for a special dinner.  I made it on short notice, so the steak only marinated for about 4 hours.  It was still good, although the flavors tasted a bit sharp.  We had leftovers the next day and it was even better.

So easy to make! I rarely try a new recipe at a dinner party, but this seemed to have a beautiful presentation as well as good flavors. I purchased thinly sliced steaks so I didn't have to do any pounding, used fresh spinach, spread the steaks with roasted garlic and added pine nuts. Turned out wonderfully! Will definitly make again. I liked the addition of sun dried tomatoes that another reviewer mentioned. It would add beautiful color and some acidity.

This receipe is excellent. Very delicious! I added a layer of mushrooms and served the dish with a creamy mushroom sauce (just had some mushrooms in my fridge that I needed to use!) and it worked out very nicely. The marinade made the meat very tender and gave it a great flavor. The presentation is beautiful. Thanks!

Disappointed.  Steak was way overcooked even though I took it out early.  Flavors did not blend together as expected.  Probably will not make again.

Delicious! The only thing I will change the next time I make this is to reduce the amount of stuffing. It was a bit difficult to roll. Other than that, perfect!

Pretty good! Next time I would probably use a little less filling, because I like feta cheese, but sometimes it can be overpowering. Otherwise, great recipe! I served this with roasted red potatoes and asparagus. Thanks!

This recipe was okay. I found this cut of meat to be very tough even after marinating for 24 hours. I added fresh mushrooms and garlic to the filling. My family rated this one about 3 stars. If I make again I will try it with a better cut of meat and blue cheese instead of the feta for more flavor.

OMG!! This recipe is G R E A T!! The steak was very tender. I did do one thing different, though. I marinated the steak for only 2 hours. This was plenty. Everything turned out superb. I will definately make this dish again & again.

Thank you so much for sharing this great dish.  It is one of my favorite dishes, I will be making many more times.  I had to use fresh cooked broccoli, mozzarella and fetta because that's all I had on hand, and I omitted the wine, but it was still wonderful.  Thank you again.

I made this dish for my parents and my boyfriend and they were very impressed by the presentation and taste.

I only made a few changes to the recipe. First, I marinated the steak in a store bought Italian Steak marinade since I was running low on time and couldn't buy some of the ingredients for this marinade. I also added mushrooms to the filling and sauteed them with the onions before rolling them into the steak.

Great recipe though, with most things in my pantry. Served it with roasted red potatoes and greenbeans for a great complete meal. Definitely will make this again.

Very tasty!  The entire family enjoyed this dish.  I made the marinade as directed.  We didn’t have any feta cheese on hand so I substituted ricotta cheese mixed with various spices we had in the cupboard (fried garlic, fried red onion, pepper, fresh thyme, dash of cayenne pepper)  I will make this again.  The steak didn’t flatten out very much so this was almost more of a stuffed flank steak than a roll-up.  That didn’t affect the flavor.  This recipe is a great base so that you can use the ingredients you have in the house if you don’t have exactly what is called for!

This was ok/good, but I think the presentation is more impressive than the dish itself. I liked the flavor of the meat, but was not wild about the stuffing inside. And while the marinade was good, it's not as good as A1 New York Steakhouse Style Marinade... I would rather just marinate it and grill it... much better, and easier too. We ate it and it was good, but i won't make it again, just not good enough.

The breadcrumb, spinach & cheese filling was divine!  The marinated meat however wasn't so good. It was too salty and a bit tough. Will use the filling again but not the marinade.

This recipe was interesting, but had some issues for me.  It had way too much garlic for our taste, will cut in half on next preparation.  The frozen spinach just made it meh, will switch to fresh next time.  Will also cook a little longer, the cheese and spinach didn't meld together well and just crumbled out.  Was fun to make, will definitely try again with the above changes.

I absolutely loved this   Preparation was very simple. My family raves about it. I’ll be cooking this again for sure! What I loved the most was that I had all of the ingredients already.

I added mushrooms because I always do, BUT the biggest hint I would give anyone making this recipe is to butterfly the Flank Steak.  You want it really thin, pounding it down did not flatten it enough to really make a pinwheel.

Great way to prepare flank steak! The steak was tender, and the filling was extremely flavorful. I wasn't sure about the garlic paste process (how do you use the blunt end of a knife without putting your hand on the sharp side?), but there was plenty of garlic flavor from just spreading crushed/chopped garlic on the steak. I mistakenly used 1/4 cup lemon juice instead of 1 tbsp in the marinade, and it still turned out fine :) Looking forward to making this again!

I used spiced bread crumbs, so I left out the Italian seasoning.  The filling was very good.  I think the cooking time is too long.  My steak was well done.  I tried to check the temperature of the meat, but I may not have gotten a good reading with the filling.  I'll try it again.

We used the flank steak and while flavorful found it chewy.  Think would probably be better with better cut of meat.

This is one of our favorite recipes!  I've made it a number of times, so simple and such fabulous flavors.  The best part is that for just two people, we are able to have two dinners from this recipe. I just got done making the marinade for dinner tomorrow, can't wait!

I think this is the best dish I ever made.  So tender, delicious, and elegant.  Truly amazing.  I roasted some small potatoes, cut up, alongside the meat roll.  Also, I simmered the marinade and served the meat au jus.

This is an easy dish that looks difficult and like you spent hours on it! I made a couple of changes.....I used 3/4 cup dales sauce in place of the 1/4 soy, 1/4 worcestershire, 1/4 red wine, keeping the rest of the marinade as originally written. I also pounded out the flank steak with a mallet to tenderize before adding it to the marinade. Everyone in my family enjoyed the meal, a recipe I will be preparing again!

Wonderful recipe!  I am usually disappointed with flank steak, but we pounded and pierced before marinating and it made all the difference.  The flavors are wonderful and it makes a nice presentation.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  My husband and children (ages 16, 14 and 12) love it. I altered a few things - I sautéed fresh spinach and then chopped it, I sautéed the onion for about 4 minutes in cooking spray so it was tender and I only added 2 tablespoons of bread crumbs.  I also added about a teaspoon of roasted red chili paste because I had it in my refrigerator and I thought it would add more depth of flavor.  Because you need to marinate the steak overnight it requires some planning but it is absolutely worth it.  Enjoy!

Did anyone pound these to make the steak easier to roll? I loved the flavor but had a hard time slicing and keeping it "pretty" to serve without the stuffing falling out. I wondered if pounding it thinner would help.

After pounding and poking, I marinated a flank steak for 30 hours in exact ingredients per recipe.   The marinade did nothing to tenderize the meat. While it looked absolutely beautiful out of the oven after slicing through (I posted on FB!) the steak was so tough, I couldn't get past it (didn't over cook it; was beautifully pink and 145 per recipe.)  The steak came from my local family- owned supermarket where I buy all my meat as the butcher shop there is reliably good with their product.  Had this steak been more tender, I would have bumped this recipe to 4 stars.  Don't think the extra effort is worth it unless you want to impress company with the aesthetics.

I really liked this recipe.  I followed it to the letter with the exception of 2 things......I didn't cook it as long as it called for because my family likes their steak around medium.  In addition, I used fresh baby spinach as well.  AWESOME.  This is my second attempt....honestly pound your steak and let it marinate.  Makes a world of difference!

This was terrific even though I was only able to marinate  for 30 minutes! I also didn't use flank steak (some sort of meat recall) so I used a thinly pounded flat round tip. Again, fantastic, and thanks!

Followed recipe but skipped the garlic spread and added mushrooms and spinach. Marinade is as good as everyone raves about!

Make sure you use thin flank steak, the steak I used was a little too thick and a little tough, a thinner steak would have made it much better

Very yummy! I didn't have a chance to marinate for as long as it said, but it still tasted great. I also made a few changes to accomodate 1) my lack of ingredients and 2) my guests diet preferences. 

I used cheddar cheese over goat cheese and used a mix of peppers and asparagus instead of onions. Still very enjoyable!

This dish was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly as it was the first time I had made it, and it turned out great.  I will make it again, but will probably substitute mushrooms for the breadcrumbs.  Overall this is a very good recipe.

I followed the receipe and marinated the meat for 18 hours and it was still very chewy and downright tough in places. The taste was good, so the next time i will brown rolled up meat in my Dutch Oven and cook it on top of the stove for at least 2 to 3 hours, round steak would do just as well for this dish.

I followed the recipe and my husband thought the dish was great.  I didn’t like the marinade. Will make this again, but use my own marinade.

It was pretty good, but I thought of a few changes that might make it better. The onions and garlic in the stuffing were a bit sharp so sautéing them before hand might be a good idea.  Also my family found the sweetness of the worcestershire sauce in the marinade a bit strange for the taste buds, so a different marinade could be the cure.  I think that I will make it again with a few changes.

WOW! This turned out a lot better than expected; the entire family was raving about this dish. I didn't realize it was an overnight marinade thing until I had everything in the bag, but I marinated it for just 10 minutes and it still ended up tasting fantastic! I also left out the bread crumbs and added thinly sliced mushrooms. Next time I will marinate it overnight to get the full effect of the recipe. It's a definite keeper.

This dish was absolutely amazing!!!  Because of a schedule change I ended up marinating it for 2 days not one and it was great.  I substituted gorganzola for the feta (personal preference) and it turned out great.  This will become a regular feature to our weekly meals.

All I could here during dinner were yum's and chewing, absolutely delicious!  Changes I made:  I didn't use the marinade, I cheated and used A-1 Steakhouse marinade instead.  I also used 1 shallot instead of the chopped onion, added mushrooms, and forgot to add the bread crumbs.  Great recipe, will definately make this one again!  Thanks!

I made a few changes to this recipe, but it came out FANTASTIC! My boyfriend said this was the best steak he has ever had.
I used blue cheese instead of feta, and i left out the onions, b/c we both dislike them. I also put the filling on top of the steak instead of rolling it. 
All in all this was an excellent recipe, that i know i will make again and again.

First rate!  Had to make changes (of course!); I used fresh spinach that I sauteed until wilted, shredded Gruyere and no onions (husband hates them).  I don't think I flattened the steak enough, because I wasn't really able to create a "pinwheel," but it roasted up nice & juicy and the filling was great.  Can't wait to make it again with feta!  Thanks!

This was very tasty and made an excellent presentation for my dinner party.  I did make a few changes.  I used a garlic and herb cream cheese in place of the garlic and feta cheese.  I also just realized that I forgot the bread crumbs, which I will use next time, but certainly weren't missed!  Will definitely make again!  Thanks.
