The submitter suggested using coconut water which I thought I had, but didn't, I did have Silk Coconut Milk and that's what I used. I liked it but if I make it again I will leave out the broccoli.

Not very tasty but effective I think.  I’d recommend small intake like a small mason jar.   Might be looking for another recipe that tastes better but this has to be healthy.   Don’t use if you are on the run because you’ll have to poop about a half hour after consuming FYI

We really loved this one and I don't like spinach but couldn't even taste it. This is great starter green smoothie!!
