This was a very poor approximation of pumpkin pie in my opinion, largely due to the texture of the ricotta.  A similar, but far better, recipe that is also South Beach-okay is the Mocha Ricotta Creme also on this site.

This recipe is very good. I used it in phase one.  Not sure if I should have but topped it w/ a dollup of fat free cool whip. Then it really gave it that pumpkin pie taste.

Instead of using all the spices they recommended I just used the premade pumpkin pie spice. Much tastier and easier. I would also recommend doing like the recipe says and using low fat ricotta becuse the fat free leave a little bit of a film. Otherwise a really good treat

This was delicious!  Tasted just like pumpkin pie.  Next time I will reduce the amount of ginger, but very good otherwise.  My favorite of all the versions of the ricotta creme desserts by far.

Ewww!! This was not good. There was too much ginger and it burned the inside of your mouth after you swallowed each bite. I made it for some friends (also doing the South Beach diet) and we all took one bite and refused to eat any more. Needless to say we had Jell-O instead.

Tasted pretty good as a substitute to pumpkin pie during Phase I.  I also thought it was good with fat-free cool whip on top.

I love this dessert for fall.  To avoid that funny texture of part-skim ricotta, I make sure to use a high-quality ricotta.  It's pricier of course but makes for a much smoother ricotta creme.

I don't think I can give ANY of the ricotta desserts 5 stars, but this was pretty darn good...used pumpkin pie spice instead of the others, an extra dash of cinnamon, and a bit more splenda...plus I used the food processor to make it as creamy as possible (that is one tough task!!)
But it IS nice to have a sweet treat you don't have to feel guilty about...

I doubled the recipe and added about 1/3c sugar instead of sugar substitute and used it as a filling with the basic crepes recipe.  We all loved it and plan to keep it in regullar rotation for breakfast.  Thanks!

Since being on the South Beach Diet for a week now, this is the best thing I have eaten so far. I took one bite and it tasted like pumpkin pie... even though there's no pumpkin! Delicious!!! I'll definitely have it again tomorrow!

There's only so much you can do with Ricotta cheese for a dessert and like it.  This I had to say was very good.  I did add a pinch of all-spice.  Delicious especially for a South Beach healthy dessert recipe.

What a delicious idea.  I used fat free ricotta, pumpkin pie spice, vanilla extract, and Splenda.  I like my plain, but for my family I put it in mini graham crusts.

Ok, this recipe doesn't look that tempting, but I assure you, if you try it, you'll want to eat as dessert every day! I loved it!
