Very similiar to my recipe. I add 11/2 TBSP. of lemon juice for added flavor. Makes the cream cheese flavor pop. I also bake mine in a true cheese cake pan at 350* for 1 hour, then shut off the oven and leave it sit in the oven for an added hour. If you put a pan of water in the bottome of the oven your cake won't crack. Leave it sit on the counter until it comes to room temperature then put in the fridge. Better if made at least one day in advance for all of the flavors to come to together. You'll also see a real cheesescake texture the next day. I serve mine with assorted pie fillings on top. I made mine and gave it to ,my doctor after some extensive surgery. He thought it tasted better than the one his family makes in their bakery in Westchester N.Y. Now it's an annual ritual, when I have my annual exam he gets his cheesecake.

This is one of my favorite recipes for guests, & my kids all ask for it as their birthday cakes. I even brought it to a birthday party at a big Italian restaurant and had the staff asking for more! I make this using a 10" springform pan & it comes out high, dense & YUMMY!!! I've never used a waterbath for my cheesecakes. I've always stuck by the - cool it in the oven for several hours - method & never have a cracking problem. Using room temp. ingredients is also a must. They are easier to blend, blend smoother, and bake more evenly.

One of the best cheesecakes we've ever had. Instead of layering sliced strawberries on top, I made a homemade strawberry topping out of frozen strawberries (Supreme Strawberry Topping, which is also on this site). This was very simple, it really didn't talk more than a half hour to make, not including bake time. My husband is still talking about this cheesecake.

This was my first cheesecake ever and it was a breeze!  I baked it for 50 minutes then an extra 10 with the topping.

I received a ton of compliments including "this is better than my mother's" and "its the best cheesecake i've ever had".  

I let it cool in the oven for a while then put it in the fridge. There was one crack, but an assortment of berries covered it up and the texture was perfect.

I also used a 9" springform pan and that worked out just fine.

Made this cheesecake and it is the best. My hubby requests this everytime he  comes home on leave! I see many people have problems with cracking, the advise I received from a chef friend of mine worked after the first disaster! His advise was not to overbeat the eggs, when it says just until blended follow this direction to the "T" and I have made it dozens of times and never had an issue since. Though I have to say I am a water bath follower, I think if you are new to this recipe this procedure helps to ensure a perfect cheesecake. I have an old gas oven that will suck the mositure out of anything I put in it and this method keeps the interior nice and moist with no dryness. Highly recommend this recipe.

100% ... EXCELLENT .... A+  I removed a few steps and made a Revised Recipe: Ingredients •	1 cup sugar •	4 (8 ounce) packages PHILADELPHIA Cream Cheese, softened  •	1 teaspoon vanilla •	1 cup Sour Cream •	4 eggs  Directions 1.	BEAT cream cheese, 1 cup sugar and 1 tsp. of the vanilla in large bowl with electric mixer on medium speed until well blended. 2.	Add 1 cup of the sour cream; mix well. 3.	Add eggs, one at a time, beating on low speed after each addition just until blended. 4.	Pour over crust.  5.	BAKE 40 min. or until center is almost set on 350 degrees.  SUPER DELISH! Great texture, Great taste, Great cheesecake. I purchased a graham cracker crust and a shortbread crust and lined the bottom with pecans :O) Topped one with cherries, another with blueberries, another with strawberries and I drizzled chocoalte sauce on the fourth and swirled before baking! Still making them for friends 2 weeks after Thanksgiving.

Very good!  I had different reactions.  One of my brothers said it was nothing special that it  tasted as it  is supposed to taste (whatever that means!) and my other brother said it was really, really good and then took more than half of the pie home! I give it 5 stars because I liked it! Thanks!

I was in need of a recipe for cheesecake without the springform pan and this one was EXCELLENT.  Creamy texture.  The sour cream on top made it that much better.  I was afraid it wouldnt "unmold" from the foil but it did perfectly (i left in fridge overnight).

This is always a pleaser at all our family get togethers. Everyone says it's restaurant quality or better! ;) I've made it exactly as directed the only glitch I have found is that the baking temp & time might be off. It takes a lot longer to bake at 325, I end up having to turn it up to 350 half way through bake time. So from now on I'll just start at 350 and keep a close eye on it.  I've cut it into squares and added fruit, pie fillings or chocolate drizzle. I've also made it round with berries mixed in glaze on top. Super simple to make and delicious!

All in all, it was very tasty but nothing extra special.  Next time I will add a little lemon zest as it needed a little oomph to the filling.  I baked it in the 9x13 pan as directed but I thought a thicker cheesecake would be more satisfying (aka use a smaller pan-9”-10” springform).   And I might try doubling the sour cream portion as the sour cream flavor was too subtle.  I added a blackberry whiskey sauce for mild added sweetness.

Good recipe. Easy to make but I did get big cracks. I cooked it in 9" springform pan. Next time I will try a water bath and hope for the best. But very yummy and smooth. My husband loved it!

This was an easy to follow recipe, I had to adjust the cooking time, but it was really good.  The taste is thick and rich, really good.  I will be adding a little more sugar the NEXT time I cook this!  Thanks for the great recipe!!
