We usually don't like onion soup mix (it can be a little too strong flavor and salty) but it works great in this recipe. We BBQ grilled and we liked the flavor a lot! I skipped adding the salt.I think the 1/2 c water (not only to hydrate the dry soup mix) added important moisture that helps bind the meat together, so I would not skip that.
  Also, FYI, we think it is important to use a quality ground turkey.We like "Turkey Store" "Jennie O" extra lean brand. It doesn't seem to have that odd after-taste that some do. We will definitely make turkey burgers this way again and again. Great simple recipe Krickett!

We liked these a lot. Just the "kick" for plain turkey. I had read others' reviews first, so I omitted the salt. First I mixed the water, onion soup mix and pepper, then mixed the ground Jennie O turkey in it, and let it sit for about 10 minutes. Lacking the motivation/energy to put the burgers (l lb. made 5 4-oz. patties) on the Weber, I made them on my George Foreman grill: 8 minutes at 300 degrees (my GF lets me set the temperature separately for each half of the grill). They were done to perfection. We'll have this again and again.

Excellent recipe.  I omitted the salt as the soup mix was salty enough. I mixed the water, soup mix and pepper together and soaked the turkey patties in the mixture for 10 minutes.  Then I grilled them on a stovetop grill pan, making sure some of the onions from the soup mix stayed on the burgers.  They were delicious.

Never tried turkey burgers before and am very glad I finally did!  I took some tips from a few other reviews and omitted the salt (soup mix salty enough) and I patted them in breadcrumbs and fried on stove in a touch of olive oil.  Everyone had seconds - no leftovers :). Thank you Krickett!

I don't usually care for turkey burgers, but I thought I'd give this a try.  I used onion & mushroom soup and cooked the burgers on the stove along with some mushrooms.
It was delicious!  I will definitely make this again :)

This recipe was wonderful and easy to make. My husband loved it! I had made a switch to turkey instead of the usual ground beef for a healthy alternative and he was surprised to find out that turkey can be so delicious! I alter the recipe just a tad, I left out the salt since the soup mix was salty as is, I added 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and 2 Tbs. garlic powder since my husband is a garlic freak.  This has now become our usual dish to make. Thumbs Up!

I left out the water and the salt, as there is enough salt in the onion soup mix.  I added 1 Tbsp. of lite soy sauce and a little garlic powder and let the patties rest for a half hour after making them.  These went great on multi-grain rolls.

Sorry, but I thought these were terrible.  Even the addition of fresh parsley and some breadcrumbs plus lots of ketchup, mustard and pickles couldn't save these "burgers".

These were really good and moist.  They are what they are - turkey burgers with onion flavor.  But husband really enjoyed and they were very moist!  We ate them plain with some cheese and ketchup, as well as in flour tortillas.  A good recipe for the first-time turley griller, like us!

too much water, Only use 1/4 cup, and only needs 1/2 of the Lipton soup mix per pound, please don't add anymore salt. After you mix the soup mix into the meat, you should allow it to rest for 30 mins, so that the dehydrated onions will soak up some water.

This recipe is delicious. I left out the salt as many suggested. I also used chicken stock in place of water. I mixed it all together and let it sit for 20 minutes before shaping into patties and grilling. These were so great and moist.  The children and hubby loved them. I'll make them many more times!

FANTASTIC!!! Made these tonight and we loved them!! Like other reviewers-- kept everything as is but omitted the salt and pepper (the onion soup mix had everything and more). Also added two small handfuls of Italian breadcrumbs. I used extra lean ground turkey and served on whole wheat hamburger buns with fat free miracle whip, honey mustard, ketchup, tomatoes, red leaf lettuce, caramelized onions and grilled red peppers. YUMMMMY!  Thanks a bunch!!

I liked it but I thought that there was too much onion flavor. I would either use just a half of the envelope or even a quarter of it.

Wonderful Taste!  Used cheap turkey meat but still tasted great.  No salt added based off other reviews.  When water was mixed in it seemed as if the burgers were too soft and may fall through the grates on grill but final product was moist and still remained as a burger shape.  Will make again.

I used this recipe on ground beef instead of turkey and made a few other changes.  I used only half of the onion soup mix, omitted the salt, added a dash of cayenne, and added 3 T of milk instead of the water.  It was very delicious.  My picky husband even enjoyed this one.  Next time I think I will make these into meatballs....yummy.

Amazing! I made these for my stepdaughters who can be quite picky with their food and they absolutely loved it! It was quite messy to make into patties, but totally worth it. I put less water and I added some Heinz57 sauce and some steak spices which gave it a tasteful kick!

This was my 2nd attempt at turkey burgers, and I did not care for the flavor in this one at all.  I am not sure why people like this particular variation, as it was not pleasant for anybody in my household.  I will keep looking.

My picky 4 yr old ate them but my husband who will eat anything said they were terrible and I have to agree.  The onion mix overpowered.  Perhaps use only half the mix?

These were really good.  I did however not add the salt as the other reviews suggested and I would say depending on your turkey watch the water.  I will be serveing these on small buns with cranberry sauce on the bottom and some stuffing on top.

This was so simple and so delicious!
I followed the advice of some other reviewers not to add any more salt (because packaged soup mixes tend to be very salty already).  I will probably reduce the amount of water next time, though - the patties came out a bit too wet and didn't "travel" well (from plate to spatula to grill, or to freezer bag when I was trying to freeze the extras!).  
Thanks for the recipe, Krickett!

This was a great recipe and so simple.  My kids actually asked me to make it again some time, even my 4 year old! The only thing I did differently was to lightly roll the patties in bread crump and I pan fried them instead of grilling them. Everybody had to have seconds!!

I made them just as recipe directed including salt.  Grilled them on a preheated gas grill at medium heat for 7 minutes a side.  Smothered them in sauteed poblanos and onions with melted smoked gouda.  They were delicious and moist and not overly salty.  Thanks, Krickett!!

I added sauteed onions, mushrooms, garlic powder, and omitted salt per other's reviews.  We have now been eating these burgers 3 weekends in a row cuz my husband keeps requesting them.  Use them for all get togethers.  Everyone loves them.

I loved this recipe! The patties turned out perfectly, although it doesn't really taste like a typical hamburger but still delish! My fiance doesn't like onions much so he didn't like all that much. I however loved it :)

I just have to write a review - these were the BEST turkey burger - No - BURGERS I have ever had. They were so moist and flavorful - just DELCIIOUS. They were a big hit in my household for everyone. I only used half a package of onion soup mix and found that to be the PERFECT amount. Wonderful!

this is a very simple yet tasty recipe.  I did make a few changes to it.  I decided to omit the salt being that the dry soup mix was already seasoned.  I didnt have onion soup so i used what i had which was beefy onion.  I also added half a poblano pepper, half of a small onion (both diced), and 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper to one pound of ground turkey.  I mixed it all in a bowl and sectioned it off to make 4 patties.  I pan seared them 5 min each side.  They were delish!!!! I will make again and again and again.  Maybe next time i will post a picture.  They got eaten up before i could even take a picture.

I tweaked this recipe too much to give it a 5 star rating as stated.  I didn't have soup mix so I used 2 tsps. dried ranch dressing mix, 2 tsp. A1,  1 tsp. worcheshire sauce, 1 tsp. minced garlic, 1/4 cup seasoned bread crumbs and a small amount of roasted red pepper juice from the jar.  I did cut back on the water to 1/4 cup.  This burger was so MOIST!  I've tried many burger recipes from this site and this one is the BEST with my additions (guess my tastebuds really liked the flavor)!  I only had 2 hamburger buns so I let the kids have them.  This was so good tasting I didn't use any bread or ketchup or ranch dressing.  I still can't get over how really moist it turned out.  I did cook in the skillet on med. low heat for 12 minutes total because of the thickness of the burger.  I got 5 total burgers.  My kids skipped the baked fries II recipe I made to have ANOTHER burger!  Will definately make this one a lot this summer on the grill.

Very good Turkey Burger. Even my husband prefered them over the regular ground beef burgers. I cooked them in a fryin' pan but I can't wait to try them on the BBQ grill. I'd add a lil less water then what is recommended but all in all they're the Best!!  Two Thumbs Up!!

This was really great! We loved the flavor and I am adding this to our regular recipe rotation.  I did make a few changes as suggested by other reviewers.  I mixed the water with the soup mix and two fresh minced garlic cloves and let it sit for 10 minutes. I then added the turkey and pepper but instead of salt I used a little Lawry's seasoning and plain breadcrumbs. I added breadcrumbs until the mixture was thick enough to form patties. I then let the patties sit in the fridge for about 30 minutes.  I grilled them on a George Forman for about 10-15 minutes.  They were fabulous and got rave reviews from my husband!

These were okay.  I used half an envelope, 3T, dry onion soup mix & let them plump up in a quarter cup of milk.  I also added half cup or so shredded cheddar.  No pepper or salt.  As another recipe with turkey I tried, you can tell there's dry soup mix in it.  Not a bad thing, but pretty obvious.  No raves, just okays.  :)

I used only about 1/3 of the onion soup packet and they were wonderful...and next time am just going to use dehydrated onions that have been rehydrated in the 1/2 cup water.

My husband was not excited when I served him turkey burgers, he's really a meat and potatoes kind of guy-when he took his first bite he said it was delicious and if I cooked "healthy" foods like that more often, he could definitely get on board!

I added the whole package of onion soup and had to throw out the burgers, they were so salty we couldn'g eat them.  I made them again with chopped onion and then dipped the burgers in chopped walnuts and pan fried them in a little olive oil and butter and then topped them with a red roasted pepper - delish

Nice and easy recipe with great results. I also skipped the salt, and added two diced cloves of garlic. The water really helps the burgers stay moist. Served with fresh veggies and a cannelinni bean salad. Perfect!

The taste on these was great.  I loved them and so did my two year old.  I gave them a three because they were toooo goopy with the added water.  It was so bad that I ended up having to put bread in the mix just to be able to shape them.  Next time I make them I will just leave out the water.

This is a huge hit at my house.  I omit the salt, add some Italian seasoned bread crumbs to "firm it up,", a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce, and a little garlic powder...then put them on the George Foreman.  We like them better than "regular" burgers. :) Thanks for the great recipe!

I gave my husband a charcoal grill for father's day, and this was the inaugural recipe! We both really enjoyed the flavor and texture of these burgers. I did eliminate the salt, reduce the water, and add some soy sauce. We'll definitely do these again!

I was really nervous about trying this recipe. I had worked with ground turkety before and had struggled to find recipes that weren't bland. This recipe solved that problem!

Not only did they smell wonderful as they were cooking, they tasted amazing! 

I read the reviews and decided to omit salt and added about a 1/4 Italian breadcrumbs to keep the turkey together. 

Not only will I make this again, it will definitely be a consistent fixture at my house!

Boy was I surprised at how well I liked these- my family too! I used ground turkey breast meat & omitted salt. Like another reviewer, I dipped them in seasoned bread crumbs (3 T.) & pan fried in olive oil.( 1/4 cup )( I also mixed the water & seasonings & let them sit for 10 minutes. Then mixed in turkey, formed into patties, & put in the fridge for 30 min. or so.) We are trying low carb so we didn't use buns. Just ate them with a fork!! Again- better than I expected, easy, & low carb!!!

this came out surprisingly good for being so simple.. i agree with Mark Farmer about only using half the packet of onion soup mix and no salt.. it would have been  way too salty otherwise.. i used a combo of ground turkey and pork totalling a little over 1.5 lbs.. i used Onion Soup Mix (recipe on this site) as a base and came up with the following ingredient amounts: 2 T dried minced onion, 2 T beef bouillon, 3/4 t onion powder, 3/4 t black pepper, and 1/4 c water.. it was perfect.. ty for the start of a 5* recipe

Quite salty, but an interesting flavor. I used pepperjack cheese (low-fat), mustard, pickles, and a creamy horseradish product.

This was great, even the kids liked it. When I first mixed the meat with the soup mix and water I wasn't sure how it would turn out because it looked pretty mushy, but after baking them for around 20 minutes at 350 they looked, and tasted, great!

It helps you to form the patties without the turkey sticking to your hands if you put oil on your hands before handling the turkey

This was a fantastic recipe! However, the burgers turned out somewhat salty for us, even leaving out the extra salt. We did not have a grill top and cooked it in a cast iron skillet, which worked very well.
Overall delicious recipe, would recommend!

I made this EXACTLY as listed and it came out fantastic.  So simple yet so flavorful.  I was concerned the first time because the mixture appeared to be to much liquid to hold the patties together but to my surprise they held together.  A slice of American cheese, slice of onion and tomato, pickles and a small mix of ketchup and mayo topped my burger and it was awesome.

The first time I made these I followed the recipe as written and they were good.  The second time I made these I used Lipton Savory Garlic and Herb dry soup mix (instead of the onion mix), added some Dijon mustard to the meat mixture, omitted the salt, and added unseasoned bread crumbs.  We then grilled them on a charcoal grill until done and they were WONDERFUL.  Topped with lettuce and tomato.  The Savory Herb and Garlic dry soup mix was an excellent compliment to the turkey.

This was a simple but quite good recipe - thank you. I made a homemade onion mix from this site, scaled because I used 3lbs of turkey meat. Did not add salt, because there is enough in the mix, and I didn't even use a half cup water with my 3lbs - I think there is too much water in this recipe. I added everything together, and just added a little water at a time to make sure it did not get too soggy to form patties. I made these on a Cuisinart Griddler and they were done in about 8-9 minutes using as a contact grill. MY KIDS LOVED LOVED LOVED these burgers, and I was surprised because there was a quite the onion taste, but they are begging for more - so I will use definitely again. Thank you!

These were awesome, whole family loved them, I doubled the amount but had to pour half the water out as it was tooooo liquidy, but once again these were brilliant, agree though that you do not need the salt, the soup mix had plenty in it. Thanks

This recipe calls for way too much water and you do not need to add any salt, the onion mix makes it salty enough.  I made the recipe with the water recommended and the meat was so soggy it was impossible to grill.  I had to run to the store to buy more meat to add to the recipe.  Not fun.  Also...the onion mix makes the taste overwhelming and way too salty.    I had to run to the store and buy two more lbs of ground turkey to try and dilute the taste with no luck.

I thought it was OK, but my family didn't :-( In reality, the taste of the onion soup mix is a bit overwhelming and that's all we could taste. We won't be making this one again.

Excellent.  I left out the salt as the soup mix is salty enough.  Next time I will try reducing the water to 1/3 cup.

Pretty good... I love onions, but it's a pretty oniony flavor... a bit to much.  Would rather have a grilled onion on the buger... but I would make it again if I had alla the ingredients in a pinch.

I wasn't impressed with these burgers. I love onion but with these there was just too much onion flavor.  I might try it again using only half the soup packet.

Fabulous!! It's nice to look at all 4 kids with smiles on their faces and clean plates.  I also left out the salt, added bread crumbs and garlic powder.  I doubled this recipe and then took the rest of the mixture and made turkey meatballs.  They were a HUGE hit also.  Thanks for the great recipe.

My kids loved this recipe.  I started following the directions but because I did not read the reviews, I added the full amount of water which was way too much.  I ended up putting in dry bread crumbs to give it more of a texture and then I added garlic.  It turned out really good.  Thanks

This is the first time I made turkey burgers. I read the reviews for this recipe and modified it according to others' recommendations. I added soy sauce, cayenne pepper, ginger paste, garlic powder, scallions, pepper, salt, and of course that packet of powdered onion soup. It was OUT OF THIS WORLD! It was so delicious, juicy, and just yum yum yum! My husband enjoyed it as well and I will be making these again soon for sure!

This was ok. I thought it was overspiced for my taste. The turkey burgers make a huge 4 burger recipe. I think next time I will flatten the turkey meat to make 8 instead of 4 thick ones.

Turned out great. I agree with another reviewer that 1/2c water is probably too much for this recipe. Next time [yes there will be a next time :)], I'll put a tad less water. Also I mixed all the wet ingredients together with the onion soup mix before adding it to the ground turkey.

Very tasty. I will make it again.

I thought these were really good - I didn't seem to have a problem with the water like everyone else, but then I kind of left most of it in the bottom of the bowl.  I made mine "Red Robin" style with cheese, guacamole and pico - YUM! will definitely make again.

I cooked the turkey burgers on our Foreman Grill and they were delicious!  They get a husband's two thumbs up!  So fast and easy.  I decided not to add salt to the recipe and I used about 1.25 pounds of turkey.  I'll definetly make these again!

Great recipe...made a few changes though.  Cut the salt out and used half the onion soup mix...added soy sauce and worcestershire.  Also, used 1 cup italian bread crumbs which gave it an extra boost of flavor that was missing when we used regular bread crumbs.

Great, the only thing I'd change is the water.  Mine fell apart on the grill so next time I'll hold off adding the water until the end and only add a little if need be.

Really, really delicious!  They cook so well on the Foreman grill...a hint--they're terrific with the Basil Fries (recipe also on this site), which are also low fat and taste great!

I am curious that these recipes don't indicate if the calories is for just the patty even though I am sure it is. The pictures I'm guessing is for a suggested way to eat it.

Made these several times. The first time I used just regular ground turkey and they were a mushy mess. Recipe should really say a pound of ground (white) turkey. It's a heartier consistency and they hold up well with the water (I use a little less than the half cup). We love them so much. 
   Hope this helps for anyone else.

I made this exactly as the recipe said to make it. I felt the onion soup mix was a little strong. I'm going to try it again using Ranch, and see if that's a lighter flavoring that doesn't overpower the turkey meat.

Really good.  Never knew to add water, but a great idea to keep it from drying out.  Made it too runny to make on the grill for me, but it cooked really well in a pan.

I was in a rush and needed a quick turkey burger , so, I thought I would give this a try.  I should've gone with my instinct and not used a full 1/2 cup of water because it was mushy and I couldn't get it to hold together.  I added a little panko to the mixture to soak up some of the liquid.  After it was cooked it was moist and tender, , but, I wasn't crazy about the flavor.

Made this last night and hubby and I both loved it added a couple of slices of bacon some soy sauce and mushrooms when I was mincing the turkey and served with cheese, onion rings and cranberry sauce (instead of relish). Yum will definitely make again.

Very good, left out the salt and it was delicious.  My husband usually cooks the turkey burgers but he had surgery so I have all cooking duty and was looking for something different.  Turkey tends to be blah, but the soup made this very very good and my husband loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

I tried this and it was delicious!!! I did old bay instead of salt and added a small amount of some shredded fresh extra sharp cheddar cheese. I Also put a slice of yellow sharp cheddar cheese on the burger with raw onion and a slice of tomato!! Yum yum!! Thanks for the recipe!

Wow...my first time making turkey burgers and the family LOVED it! The only mix I had was an "onion mushroom" mix and that worked great with the salt and pepper.  Served it up on some wheat buns, tomato, avacodo, spinach, ketchup and mustard.  Had some grilled squash on the side...I can get used to this eating healthy stuff! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Awesome burgers! The only thing I would change is lessen the water to 1/4 cup. Half a cup. The mixture was impossible to form into patties and wanted to slip through the grate. Added half pound more turkey and was more manageable. Made 5 decent burgers that tasted great!

My mom made these and brought one over for me when I was recovering from surgery. I found the flavor to be pretty good, because I really like onion. She said that the amount of water made the meat difficult to work with and ended up covering the patties with panko. We froze them to make them easier to cook (I took mine out of the freezer several hours before cooking, but it was still firm). They did not fall apart. Overall, they were pretty good and did not disappoint, but we've had better.

For someone who has never made or eaten a turkey burger before, this recipe turned out to be very good. I followed everyone's reviews and cut the salt. I would suggest only 1/4 cup water because mine turned out to be a bit too wet. Definitely let them sit for at least 20 minutes before cooking to allow the onion soup mix to absorb the water. Add some lettuce, tomato, and honey mustard and a whole grain bun and this is a healthy, tasty dinner.

Good recipe- I also add about 2 tsp Worchestershire Sauce and 1 tsp Kitchen Bouquet- darkens the appearance of the meat to look more like a hamburger so can be more kid friendly. Must serve
with sesame seed rolls- yum!

We added a few things - to thw whole recipe we added worcheshire sauce (8 shakes), a pound of half cooked bacon (I know - defeats the purpose of turkey but still better than adding bacon to ground beef!), mozzerella cheese (1/4 cup, 1/4 tbspn garlic and wine seasoning (from the Melting Pot).  We halved the recipe and put 4 tablespoons of bbq sauce in and cooked.  We like the bbq better, but both were good!

This was the first time I tried turkey burgers.  Delicious!  Can't wait to make them again.  I used 2 lbs meat & 1 packet though.  I didn't want to overpower with flavor.

I have never tried turkey burgers before, or for that matter ground turkey.  I didn't like the consistency of the meat. Like biting into a processed turkey roll (I used Jenny-O lean turkey). Although the flavor was OK, overall I didn't care for them. One out of four in the house (my 22-year old son) did like them, but I would not make them again.

Very tasty and light recipe.  The onion/mushroom mix I used went well with the turkey meat.  I also mixed in some parmesan cheese and then put a slice of swiss cheese at the top.  Came out great!

Great way to season up ground turkey.  Added a little oregano for some Mediterranean (Greek) flair.

Love this burger!   I took other reviewers advice, omitting the water and using onion mushroom soup instead.  I also used only 1/2 the packet.  The next time I make them, I will add a little more of the soup mix.   Paired with cranberry sauce, small potatoes, and green beans, it tasted like Thanskgiving!

Not a bad recipe. The meat was very watery and I had concerns about it staying together on the grill. Added bread crumbs (I eyeballed it...maybe 3/4 cup) and 1 egg. It still was pretty mushy but held together ok. Recipe seemed a little bland for my taste so I added 2 cloves of garlic and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Also added avocado on the burger as a topping.   Will make again but likely will use fresh diced sauteed onions instead of the mix and water due to the consistency issue.

I tried this burger, and I put them on a outdoor grill. Very tasty and not dried out. The soup that I used was the mushroom onion mix, and I did not use salt. Very tasty , just grilled corn and a sweet potatoe, and had a jug of sun tea!!!! Delicious all the way.

As a newbie chef this recipe was super easy to make and very yummy! I used my George Foreman to grill and it still came out really well.  Like the others, I did not add the salt and I'm very glad I didn't.  The onion soup mix is more than enough.

Very simple and very good. I followed a reviewer's suggestion and mixed the soup mix and water together first and omitted the salt. I just ate the pattys with ketchup on them and they were yum yum.

Great recipe.  Very easy - and I had all of the ingredients on hand so it made it quick and easy!  I don't think you need quite so much water, though.  I also added more seasoning (italian seasoning, garlic powder, etc).  So tasty!

Awesome flavor - I would give the flavor a 5, but...  I haven't ever had turkey burgers before, and I cannot stand the texture.  Maybe if I made them smaller it would be better.

This is as good as Money!!! I have tried them several times now and they are excellent! My 2nd try, I used garlic powder instead of salt. Excellent! Also eliminated the water since they were already very moist so I added 1/2 cup bread crumbs. Very good! My last time I found I didn't have any onion soup mix, so I added 1 package of Pork stuffing mix and bread crumbs. No salt, no pepper. Very very good. I cooked them on the Foreman grille for 13 minutes. Doesn't get any better than this! Thank you Krickett

I read the other reviews and I didn't add any salt. However the burgers were still SUPER salty. I would cut down on the onion soup mix for 1lb ground turkey!

These were great!  I DID make them a little thinner, thereby making 8 patties instead of 4 and omitted the salt (soup mix had enough).  Very tasty, and my husband agrees!

this is a good starting point for turkey burgers... I added fresh garlic, parsley, green onion, grill seasoning rather than salt, crushed red pepper and a small amount of bread crumbs to the recipe...  everyone enjoyed enough to have 2nds and 3rds..

I think I might just not be the turkey burger type, but I tried these looking for something different to serve my family.  We couldn't even eat them.   We like new things but this one was NOT a keeper.  Sorry!
