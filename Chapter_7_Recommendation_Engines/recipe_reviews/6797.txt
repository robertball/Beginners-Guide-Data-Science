This is definitely a very simple recipe for biscuits!  I have made these biscuits 2 ways: with shortening or with butter/margerine.  When I used the shortening, it made the biscuits flaky, but when I made it with the butter/margerine it made the biscuits softer.  All in all, this is a GREAT recipe and my husband loves them everytime I make them.  This is a keeper!

This is a great recipe!  My husband loves these.  I make up the recipe as is but I make the biscuits twice as big so we can make breakfast sandwiches.  I have used different types of butter/oil that I've had on hand.  I works well with vegetable oil and it makes them flaky.  When I use shortning or butter, it makes them more fluffy.  I usually add 1/2 teasp. more of baking powder when I am making big ones.  It helps to keep them from being so heavy.

This recipe is excellent. It's very easy to make and doesn't take a lot of time. The only change I made was doubling the amount of baking powder. The biscuits turned out really fluffly and made an excellent addition to the meal. They even tasted great the next day.

I've been up since 4:30 this morning and figured what the hay...I'll try to make biscuits for breakfast.  My mom used to make the best biscuits in the whole world.  Well, these are almost as great and "stupid" easy to make.  They take very little time to make.  I didn't have any shortening so I used butter instead...worked out great.  I brushed the tops with melted butter also.  They rose up real nice.

Next time I'm going to try with the shortening.  I'll let you know how that goes.

I gave this recipe a 5 star rating because they are easy to make and taste great, they came out crusty on the outside with a soft inside, yum.  The only thing I changed was that I didn't dip them in melted shortening.  Overall, they were a hit at my Thanksgiving table.

I had no problems with this recipe! The biscuits were light and fluffy, and were wonderfully crisp on the outside. I personally prefer lighter biscuits, so I reduced the baking time by one minute, and they came out perfectly. I had some leftover feta in the fridge, so I mixed some of it into one of the biscuits, and that also turned out well. I definitely recommend this recipe! Quick and delicious

Very good! This made a perfect dough. Very easy to work with and the taste was perfection! Thanks! PS reduced salt to 1/2 tsp. and used margarine instead of shortening.

Easy to make, but pan is extremely hot.  So don't let kids touch it, or take it out of the oven.  (The heat goes through most hotmittens) Doesn't take long to make and is easy to clean-up after.  Tastes like buttermilk biscits.

im in culinary school and instead of dipping them in the shortening we grade the shortening with a cheese grader and mix it into the dough so when it bakes it has an even amount of shortening and it comes out moist and another good thing is to add chesse and if u want to make red lobster bisciuts but dont have the money just take some garlic fresh or powder doesnt matter a decent amount of putter a chop up some parsely, melt it in a pot let it cool and get a little hard and as soon as they come out the oven take a pastry brush annd brush the mixture over the top so the butter mixture melts and you have your red lobster cheese biscuits  dont be stingy with the cheese either

While not my favorite biscuit (I tend to prefer buttermilk biscuits) this is a decent biscuit nonetheless. Not that I had any problem using shortening, but I used butter instead - mainly because I already conveniently had a 5 T. stick cut in the fridge. Grating that with a box grater into the flour mixture made this come together lickety-split. I did find I had to add a little extra milk to make the dough come together. I did not dip the biscuits in melted shortening. Rather, I brushed them with melted butter once they were hot out of the oven. Both butter and the right amount of salt resulted in good flavor, and I really loved the sort of crispy/crunchy bottoms. Nice and soft, but perhaps not as fluffy as they could have been.

Exactly what I was looking for! No-screwing-around plain old breakfast biscuits... and really good ones, at that. Hey, I love an orange-scented twice-sifted fancy-pants gourmet biscuit as much as the next girl, but sometimes you just have to get back to the basics - and this is it. I made these half an hour ago, and they have been eaten with just butter, whipped honey-margarine, grape jelly, actual honey, and with a sausage patty for a sandwich... all delicious. They are light, fluffy, soft inside and just awesome. I made mine with unsalted butter (and left the salt as written, but probably should have increased a tad), 1 full Tbsp of baking powder, and did not dip the biscuits AND! I didn't realize we were out of milk, so I used a powdered buttermilk product with water per their instructions. These were perfectly done at just 13 minutes, so check at 10 and then watch closely - biscuits turn color very rapidly at the end. FYI, these were not the layered flaky style of biscuit, although I did knead at least 20 turns. I'll try the butter-flavored shortening sometime to see what that does differently. Give these a try!! Now get off my computer so I can go eat more biscuits. :D

Very good easy recipe.  My changes were to use butter and I used my hands to flatten into a rectangle and cut with a pizza cutter instead of rolling it out.  Thanks for a good recipe!

I have been looking for a recipe that was like my moms because she lost it I find the best way to make sure they come out big and fluffy is once you put in milk mix just until it for into dough then not to roll it out just use you hand I have had very good luck with this. love this recipe

Perfect title since these are the same biscuits MY mom used to make! I followed recipe to the tee except I didn't dip in the melted shortening. 
For some variety, add 3/4 cup grated old cheddar cheese, 1 tsp dried parsley, 1/4 tsp italian herb mix, 1/2 tsp crushed rosemary. Bake as usual. OR: add 1/2 cup raisins, 1/3 cup white sugar & 1 tbsp ground cinnamon. So good & thanks!

Quick & easy recipe for biscuits.  They were fantastic w/dinner.  The next morning we used the left over biscuits to make ham & egg biscuits.  My baking powder had expired so they didn't rise very much.  But they were still great none the less.

I have been making this recipe for years and it remains our favorite biscuit recipe, I know it by memory. Sometimes I sub the milk with buttermilk, they come out so tender and moist. Also brush the tops with melted butter. Tip: If you dont have buttermilk on hand just add 1 TBS. of white vinegar to regular milk and let sit for about 5 min. you cant taste the vinegar and the biscuits are delicious also if the tops dont brown put under the broiler for a couple of minutes keeping a close eye on them,just enough for a slight brown top.

I am not sure what I did wrong here, and I'm sure it's not the recipe, but my biscuits turned out very flat. They tasted really good though. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to make the biscuits rise?

There is only one thing that I would do differently. If you can get it, use pastry flour. NEVER use all purpose flour. If you can't get pastry flour, use half bread flour and half cake flour. You will find that you will get a better bisquit.

I made these exactly as directed and cut the recipe in to 16 bicuits.  They would up more like cookies but tasted perfect.  To get them to the "biscuit" size that I knew my guests would be expecting I actually double the recipe and made a dozen biscuits out of it.  They were perfect.  Moist, flakey, delicious and easy, and reheated extremely well the next day.  Thank you!

Lovely little biscuit, rises high and is flaky as sin. I can't get these on the table fast enough for my lot, they eat them two handed. If your lucky enough to have a few left over ( not likely in any case), try it with a thick slice of tomato covered in mayonnaisse with a bit of salt and pepper. Makes for an amazing light lunch or tea

I followed the recipe exactly (rare for me!), just finished eating dinner, they were perfect! The first one I poured chicken fricassee over, held up to the weight fine. The second one I had butter and grape jelly on.  It was firm but fluffy.  Raised nicely. I increased the recipe by half, made 8 biscuits, used a large cutter. The trick with these is not to knead them too much or too hard.  It was a little gooey when I took the batter from the bowl to the flour covered area on the counter. I let them sit for about 5 minutes before putting in the oven.

This recipe was quick and easy.  I followed someone's suggestion to drop it by the spoonful on the cookie sheet instead of rolling it.  It was a really wet dough, so I would've had trouble rolling it anyway w/o working the dough too much.  I used margarine instead of shortening, and brushed melted margarine on top before baking.  They were a hit, and next time I'll vary it up a bit with spices, cheeses, or maybe bacon bits.  This makes a great template to play around with.  Thanks!

My daughter and I had a craving for biscuits late one night, but I didn't feel like the whole rolling/cutting them out. Made these up and just dropped them by tablespoons on pan. Very quick and yummy, super easy. Writing this review is making me want to go cook some now!

Very good biscuits :) i had no problem with mine rising. I didnt have baking powder so i used 1/4 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp cream of tartar per tsp of baking powder in the recipe. I also added 1/4 cup of sugar to the recipe, and brushed the tops with melted margarine before baking. Yummy ;)

Great! I made these in my food processor and increased the baking powder to about 1 tablespoon. I also haven't found these to make more than one dozen biscuits, but I like mine on the larger side! I also usually substitute out 1/2 cup of the flour for whole wheat because it gives a great taste/texture to the biscuits.

These were very good. Followed the recipe, but used butter instead of the shortening, dropped them instead of rolling and cutting, and didn't bother with brushing the tops with anything.  Still a very tasty basic biscuit.  I used less than 3/4C milk... so don't just dump in the full amount and figure it's right. Will use again, might try subbing some wheat flour in.  Yumm-o!

These were really fast and easy to fix. No kneading required which is always a plus. I didn't care for the flavor though, it seemed like something was missing. I used butter flavor crisco, but I don't think it made much difference than if I had used plain. I got 8 biscuits from this. These were good with Bill's Sausage Gravy over the top.

These biscuits came out great...very flaky just like a biscuit should be. Even my husband said this one was a keeper! I followed the recipe as is except I replaced the shortening with butter to reduce trans fat. Will definitely make again and again!

This is an easy and very good recipe, have used it several times now already. I started using butter instead of shortening. Double or triple the recipe and cut them thick to make them soft and able to be split and buttered if you like.

You can cut the circles out with a round cookie cutter, or even the top of a round cup as I did a few times when I had no cutters :)

Tried this last night to surprise the family with some fresh biscuits for the morning. They came out so good I'm on my second batch! We love "melt in your mouth" biscuits and that's exactly what we got. Only variation I made was based on other reviews - I added 1 tablespoon sugar for sweetness. Very easy recipe worth trying!

Excellent if you're looking for those "bisquick" style biscuits!  The "makes 2-3 dozen" is WAY off though.  I get 8 normal sized biscuits (using a small juice glass as my cookie cutter, making about a 2.5" biscuit).

Followed recipe exactly with one exception- I used 1 tablespoon of baking powder instead of the 2 1/2 teaspoons. Not a drastic change but read that the more baking soda the more they would rise. Super easy and quick to make. Now we can have biscuits and gravy many more mornings!

2 stars because they were light and fluffy...but I must b doing something wrong. I used the 2 tsp of baking powder, and that's all I could taste. They looked wonderful and the dog loved them, but my family said no go....if anyone has ideas what I did wrong I would love to know. I thought it was just not mixed well bit every darn one of them tasted equally nasty, like I was licking the baking powder can

These were quick and easy.  And they were very light.  But I do agree with another reviewer, they don't have much flavor, except a hint of baking powder flavor. 

I made a half batch, with butter.  If I try them again, I will try making them with shortening, since that is what the recipe calls for.  If they have more flavor, I will update the review and rating since that would validate the recipe as written.

As others noted, there is no way a full batch could yield 24 biscuits.  With the half batch, I got only 7, and my biscuits were relatively small.

Also, I agree they probably need more baking powder, as mine rose some but nothing like what is shown in the photo.  But since they already have a hint of that baking powder flavor, I would be worried how they would taste with more baking powder.

Extremely easy, extremely tasty for as quick as they are to make! Reminds me of my Grandma's, with the exception of using shortening instead of the lard that she used.  These are very tasty with butter and honey or butter and syrup!

These are very simple, and very tasty!  I make these vegan by adding soy milk in lieu of regular milk, which adds a nice nutty flavor.

These biscuits WERE very tasty, however they definitely did NOT make 2-3 dozen. I got about 8 biscuits out of the recipe, and my biscuits were not that large. I would recommend doubling the recipe AT LEAST if you want 2 dozen. The other change I made was to lightly brush the tops with melted butter instead of dipping them; dipping is not necessary. These were very easy, very simple biscuits. I made biscuits and then I also made a batch as mini shortcakes for strawberry shortcake. Delicious!

I followed this down to the letter, handled the dough as lightly and as little as possible.  Was not impressed at all with the light yellow somewhat flaky hockey pucks that I wound up with. Some of the pictures (the yellow-hockey puck pics...look like mine.  The biscuits in the original photo look GREAT!    I want THAT recipe! won't make these again.

I made these biscuits for my sausage gravy and they were perfect. These biscuits were quick and easy to make and with having 4 kids one of which is only 6 mos i dont have a lot of time to cook so it was wonderful to be able to make homemade biscuits without it being an all day process. They tasted great, were light and fluffy and went great with my sausage gravy. I will definatly make these again many times. I brushed the top with milk before baking but other then that i followed the recipe.

These biscuits are fabulous! I make them all the time. They're great as a meal compliment or just eating cold with a bit of jam for a snack. Even my British in-laws love them with sausage gravy for breakfast!

5 T equals just about 1/3 C so that is what I used.  I brushed the tops with butter before baking them at 475 degrees.

This was a REALLY EASY recipe but the biscuits weren't as fluffy as i thought they would be. They were a little hard too. I used regular shortening so they were bland. I'd recommend using butter-flavored shortening.

Excellent taste - even though I usually prefer to cook and bake with butter, I definitely recommend using butter flavored shortening; it makes all the difference in the world for flakiness and taste. My advice is to not roll the dough too thin. To achieve the flaky layers, the unbaked dough really should be rather thick.

I liked the recipe, the ratio seems to be correct. The only thing I didn't like was that the amount the recipe is supposed to make isn't accurate. I halved the recipe the first time, and I got 5 biscuits out of it, that's not even half a dozen. So, if I had wanted to make enough for a family with more than just myself and my husband, I would have had a surprise.

Excellent! I have also used chilled bacon grease I save for pie crusts. I used 1/2 bacon grease and 1/2 Crisco. MMMMM good  nice variation. The Biscuit browns much better than when using just butter/margarine to top. It also adds that needed touch of "flavor", that I noticed some reviewers said was the only missing puzzle piece.
These were much like the Biscuits that Gram made, using the bacon grease incorporated.

I love this recipe! My hubby and kids love it too! They come out with a beautiful crusty outside and wonderful inside. I've made these multiple times, and like varying the recipe by adding a little garlic powder sometimes. As has been said in other reviews, do not overwork the dough or you will end up with hockey pucks.

I've made this recipe dozens of times and they always turn out perfect. The only thing I changed was using butter over shortening for extra flavor. The only thing I dislike is it doesn't yield very many, I usually need to double the recipe in order to get at least a dozen.

I am not a fan of this recipe. They didn't puff up AT ALL and they burnt to a crisp after only 8 mins at that temp. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a disaster... Turned out more like crackers than biscuits... I'll keep looking for the perfect biscuit recipe.

One of the few things I'm lousy at making is baking powder bicuits, or at least until now.  These biscuits are light and flaky - everything a baking powder biscuit should be.  Now my DH can't brag about how much better his biscuits are than mine!  Thank you for the recipe.

I was writing a report for a Criminal Justice class for my highschool when i came upon this recipe. I immediately got up and made them within 20 minutes. They are absolutely delicious! I subbed shortening for butter. Works just as good. I would go easy on the salt and not dip in shortening afterwards. Absolutely amazing! Thank you so much for making a long night of paper writing a great snack time!

I tryed this recipe and the biscuits came out flat as pancakes. I don't know why, I followed the directions exactly and they came out flat. I'm going to try increasing the baking powder next time.

I hate to leave a bad review but I just made 2 batches of these and neither of them rose well at all.  I thought the first was a fluke, so i tried again.  The only thing I did differently was to double the batch both times.  I did everything else exactly as the recipe stated.  Really wish these would have worked out.

This is a great recipe.  I never rolled them out, I just pull off bits and flatten them (sort of) with my hands.  This is also an excellent if you add some finely chopped FRESH rosemary.  You don't need a lot, maybe 1/2 tsp.

Here in the south we make bigger biscuits apparently. I can't imagine getting 24 biscuits out of this recipe. I got 7. And sometimes I use butter; sometime lard or shortening. Both work wonderfully. I do recommend using a whole tablespoon of baking powder (at least) though because they do not rise well with only the amount in this recipe. And key words...don't overwork the dough! Yummy biscuits plain or great with honey or butter and jelly!

I prepared these biscuits for the first time this morning for visitors and my sister in law said they were the best biscuits she has ever had in her life!  I am keeping this one!

This is only my 2nd time ever attempting to make homemade biscuits. And I have to say, this recipe really didn't make me want to re-try it. The biscuits came out flat and it certainly did not yeild 2-3 dozens, which after I tasted them, I was very happy it only made 12-13 biscuits. And that was rolling it thin. Maybe that's why they came out flat. I don't know. The taste was just "okay". Still looking for a recipe close to "Mama's".

This was pretty good.  I think it overcooked on the bottom a little bit.  So, I think it would have been better to either turn the temperature down a little bit or sprayed the pan before putting them on.  But, overall they were good.

These are the biscuits I remember having as a kid. I was sad when I lost the recipe that won me 1st place in the 4H biscuit competition, but these are easier to make and definitely hit all the same high notes. I use butter instead of shortening.

I didn't really love this recipe. They came out flat and fairly tasteless. The ones we ate right away with butter and jam were not bad but I wont make this recipe again.

I made these today and expected them to turn out like the pictures, unfortunately they were much flatter. They tasted excellent but not very high.  Could it be because I didn't have whole milk? and had to use skim? I was careful not to handle the dough too much as my mom told me that was the secret to making good biscuits.

I wanted a quick and easy biscuit recipe for the creamed chipped beef my husband was begging for.  This really fit the bill!  I made them as written aside from brushing butter on the tops instead of the shortening.  I think maybe they would have had a richer taste if I'd used the butter flavored shortening in the mix, but I only had regular and they still were tasty.  They cooked up perfectly in 12 mins and were nice and flaky.  I didn't get a lot of biscuits out of the mix, but I got 9 good sized ones, which was fine for our dinner.  I will definitely be making these again very soon.

I added a 1/2 cup of white sugar to this recipe for a sweeter dessert-type biscuit.  I also reduced the oven temperature from 450 to 400.  These were simple and came out great!

My husband said these were some of the best biscuits he has had (I made them the last two nights to go with our dinner). I doubled the recipe, and it yielded about a dozen standard-sized biscuits. Instead of dipping them in melted shortening, I brushed melted butter on the tops, and it worked nicely.

Excellent recipe! Simple and customizable. I made a batch following the recipe as is and then I made a batch using butter instead of shortening. Both were perfect. I'm going to try making a batch using heavy cream and sugar for shortcake next. Thanks for an awesome recipe.

These are good. I followed one of the reviewer's suggestion, doubled the amount of baking powder, but they didn't turn out to be bigger. I was expecting big biscuits. But they turned out good anyway.

Very yummy!  I used grated butter instead of oil, and half whole wheat flour. I mixed in a tablespoon of Cheese, Chives and Bacon dip mix, then brushed on butter and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.  This is better than my usual biscuit recipe for sure!  Thanks!

These were great! I doubled the recipe, but when it came to the part "DIP IN MELTED SHORTENING" I almost died. I brushed a little melted margerine on the tops because the thought of the whole thing dripping in lard didn't sound appealing.They turned out awesome and tasted great.

I would like to know how you're supposed to get 24 biscuits out of this recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly and was able to get 12 very thin biscuits.  I cut them with a 2 1/2" cutter and hoped they'd rise a little during baking.  Not really.  My biscuits look like miniature pancakes.  Next time I make these I will double the recipe.

I added a little extra liquid because the dough came out a little dry at first. I was dubious about the cooking time of 12-15 minutes at such a high heat, but it turned out to be quite accurate. Not quite buttermilk biscuits, but good if you don't have buttermilk or the ingredients for a substitute on hand.

Mmmm!  These biscuits are delicious!
The texture is wonderful.  We liked ours with butter, then preserves, jam, or honey on top... it was very hard to stop at just one biscuit!  
I think dipping them in shortening made them extra special.  
I will be keeping this nice recipe! :-)

I tried 2 biscuit recipes from this site today and didn't like this one as well as "tea biscuit" recipe.  These seemed dry and I rolled to thin, should have rolled to 1/2 inch.  A GREAT suggestion by a reviewer I tried was wetting the counter and placing plastic wrap on it to roll the dough out.  This really cut down on the flour mess, just pulled up plastic and threw away! Thick recipe was quick to prepare but not enough flavor.

EXCELLENT...a very moist and tender biscuit.  Be careful not to over-handle the dough or they will be tough and dry.  I patted them to the desired thickness, cut biscuits very close together, and repeated x1.  The bit of left over dough I threw away to avoid dry, tough biscuits.  I also made a batch with rice milk for my allergic son, they weren't nearly as good.  Stick with the butter flavored Crisco and milk.  THEY WERE YUMMY!

These were not what I expected - however, when I went out and bought some since I didn't care for these, my husband had me do a blind taste test, and I really liked the flavor of these more than the store bought ones, but appearance wise, they are not up to par.  I used butter instead of of shortening, and I did not dip them.  Not sure if I will make the effort to try again or will just buy them.

Thanks for a great, easy, basic recipe - that doesn't use mountains of baking soda! I always bake with at least part whole wheat pastry flour. I used half that, and half all purpose. Also used butter. Will try margerine next time, so see if the texture changes. Whole wheat makes a denser biscuit (with more flavor), but these were still soft enough to be good. I melted a couple tablespoons of butter and brushed it on rather than dipping.

Not a big fan of these biscuits.  I used the butter flavored Crisco and they just weren't that tasty.  Maybe I did something wrong ... I might try them again using butter.

These were good but not great.  I'm from the south and it's just hard to match some of the biscuits around here.  These were fairly flat but had a nice crispness to them.  Not quite sure I'd dip them in shortening again.

This recipe was simple, and the buscuits turned at light and fluffy even at 7,000 ft.  I did not adjust the recipe at all, and found the flavor bland.  Next time I'll try buttermilk and make them a little thicker.  A great base recipe to work with!

It's a great recipe, they were light. A great recipe and is easy to make.  The next time I'm going to try the recipe with buttermilk. I tried making them with buttermilk, it didn't come out as good.  They also freeze real well. Thanks for such a good recipe.

either there isn't enough baking powder in the recipe or it doesn't scale well because they didn't rise much. I didn't roll them but lightly pressed the dough.  The taste was good and texture perfect. btw, my baking powder was new.

Tasted good. Mine didn’t rise very well so will use more baking powder next time. This recipe made 11 normal sized biscuits for me using exact measurements.

It was very dry so I added about 3 tbsp of milk. Would have been 5 stars but it was too dry. The final product was too dry and too salty. I’d revise the recipe to increase milk to one cup and reduce salt to 1/2 tsp salt.

I followed recipe “closely”, got late start on breakfast, I added A bit more (up to 1/4 c) milk (almond milk) and dropped by spoonful in iron skillet rather than roll. Due to salt restrictions, didn’t add and they were tasty.

This is almost exactly the recipe my dad makes. He learned it as a family tradition and never wrote down a recipe. We followed this recipe together and the only variation he made was to add more shortening since the flour seemed too dry. As usual with this kind of cooking, I couldn't tell you how much we added - probably about 2 more tablespoons. We just added it until it looked right.

The biscuits turned out just like Dad's. Wonderful for biscuits and gravy, bacon and eggs, or with jam.

I substituted the shortening with corn oil using just under 5 Tbsp, mix all dry ingredients, add oil til crumbly, fold in milk til all dry ingredients are wet. Pat out on floured board, fold two times, cut, bake. I will it again.

Already did a review, but wanted to say also that I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 real lard (my own rendered lard)  in the biscuits with the melted butter for dipping! Will make this recipes many many times!!

I made these exactly as written and divided the dough into 24 equal sized biscuits that I cooked for exactly 12 minutes.  A little too salty for my taste and I think that this would work better with fewer, larger biscuits.

Excellent simple recipie! It totally saved me during Thanksgiving! I made Turkey gravy to go with them. I've never made biscuits (or gravy) from scratch before. I may add some cheese and garlic next time like Red Lobsters biscuits. Oh and these came out really buttery which was a super plus! Well, there goes my diet...totally worth it! (Lol).

I doubled it but mmmmm nummy these are good!! I would add a little less baking powder because I could taste it in the biscuit but that might be because doubling can mess with the end product. I also used butter.  Easy, quick delish!

made these for my husband, as a topping on a casserole like his grandma used to make, as well as a couple biscuits left over for testing ;)  the verdict was he hasnt had a biscuit that good in over 40 years since his grandma was alive,  will be made again for sure!  he loved it.  Used crisco for the shortening and it was just gorgeous

Been making these for years. When I have to go gluten free 11 years ago it took sometime to get to hem right but I converted these to gf. The changes I made are 2 cup flour = 1 1/3 c of gluten free flour mixture (I use King Arthur Gluten Free Flour or Bob's Redmill 1 to 1 gluten free flour) and 2/3 cup starch (I usual combine 1/3 c corn starch and 1/3 c tapioca starch). The baking powder needs to be gluten free as well (Rumford, Clabber Girl or Bakewell or other).   Let dough sit for 20 minutes. When rolling out keep in mind  these will not rise much so I leave dough thicker. Bake as usual and enjoy.

Do NOT believe the rating! I followed the recipe to the letter, did not over mix my dough and they still did not rise. The were basically flavorless, will not be making these again. Change the name to Flying Saucer Dog Biscuits and you've got a winner!

I love this recipe. I have always struggled with biscuits, but these come out perfect every time. They also work amazingly with whole wheat flour without having to split it with white flour.

I've made this recipe a couple times now, and it's always so wonderful. With butter, gravy, or cream cheese, these biscuits are incredible.

Very easy; I followed the recipe exactly and got very good, plain, baking powder biscuits, which is exactly what I wanted. My baking powder was old, so they didn't rise much, but the flavor was good. I'm going to try again with new baking powder. Also, I used regular (not butter-flavored) shortening, and I froze the shortening before cutting it into the flour mixture. It rolled out very well.

Beware! The pan was hot when I took it out of the 450 degree oven after 10 minutes. Yikes. Who'd have thunk it?  I had to send kids next door to prevent them from touching or being traumatized by the heat. Duh...
BTW great recipe. Didn't change a thing. And even if I had I wouldn't be rude enough to say so. Just tell the family to leave when you remove the pan and have your local fire department on speed dial. Lol

Great biscuits. I used butter instead of shortening. They turned out beautifully. Light and soft on the inside and perfectly crunchy on the outside.

My husband is a pastor and the first Saturday of the month is the Men's Prayer Breakfast and he brings these biscuits. I put the dry ingredients in the food processor the night before and he adds the butter and milk in the morning. Perfect!!!

The only thing we changed about this recipe was substituting shortening for real butter, and it is AMAZING! These biscuits get compliments from everyone, and they are perfect with chunky sea salt sprinkled ontop right after baking ;) many thanks to your mom for these buttery, melt-in-your-mouth delicious pockets of love from heaven!

I used unsalted butter instead of shortening and used bread flour. Also by mistake put 2 tbsp of baking powder in them . they came out light and fluffy. However next time I make them I will shorten the cooking time. I also left out the salt because of being on a low sodium diet.

I really liked these biscuits. They were quick and very easy to make.  I only made one substitution and that was butter instead of shortening.  I rolled my dough about 1/2" thick and they just about doubled in height, so they weren't terribly tall, but they tasted very good.  I will definitely make them again!

The only change I made was I used vegetable oil instead of shortening to roll the biscuits in because that's what my mom always used. The recipe taste fine but depending on your oven you may want to lower the temperature when baking because at 450 in my oven the biscuits barely rose and almost burned on the bottom. Otherwise it was easy to make and tasted good.

Tender biscuits just like mom's! Fabulously easy. My baking powder was a bit old and I couldn't find my biscuit cutter so I used a drinking glass, but these still came out great.

Very simple and fast, but very bland.

I had mine with nutella and milk, but were still quite stiff.

I have made these before. The only thing I found is that if you are making shortcakes increase the milk to a full cup so you can make drop biscuits. Thank you for the share. I had lost my family recipe and it is a comfort to know I can find those recipes here!

They taste great and was very easy to make.  I just added a little more baking powder and shortening than called for. The only thing is they didn't rise much.

Great recipe; I used soft & unsalted butter, 5 teaspoons as asked in the original directions, I also added 2 teaspoons of EVOO, & I added just an extra teaspoon of Baking Powder; overalls they were both flaky, but sturdy, and very soft. I also used them for breakfast sandwiches!

Quick and easy. No way this recipe makes 24 decent sized biscuits, though. I halved it and could barely get six 2 1/2 inch biscuits rolled to 1/4 inch thickness which baked to the thickness and crispness of big cookies. Next time, I'll use the entire recipe  to make 8-10 thicker, fluffier ones. As for flavor - they're biscuits! How much flavor can flour, shortening and milk (or even buttermilk) have?

Perfect biscuits- just like my mom's.  I also made them into hot pockets ---  roll out thin add cooked chicken and cheese fold and pink closed then fried in olive oil --  I suppose you could also bake. they came out great fried.

I had been bored last night and decided to make something, after about half an hour I found this recipe. This recipe is easy and delicious in the outcome. I had accidentally put in 2  3/4 c then I kept adding flour until it was as stiff as it could be. After they came out of the oven I dipped the tops of them in to melted butter. This recipe is amazing and it's very flexible.

My biscuits came out flat. So what did I do wrong? One reviewer stated not to overwork the dough. Maybe I did.  Otherwise I will make again and see if that works.

Flavorless.  Did not rise well, and I baked at 450 as writtten, but I think I should have stayed with 425.  Not light and fluffy.

Super easy to remember (I liked that a lot!) And they come out perfect. I have made these over and over--sometimes I use buttermilk, sometimes I sour the milk with lemon or
 vinegar. I have added- garlic, cheese, crumbled bacon, whatever and they never fail.

Mine came out very flaky... the recipe only made 11 (3 inch diameter) biscuits.  I used butter....  I did not overwork the dough (very important), rolled out about 1/2 in thick, scraps just squeezed together and then cut as well.  Will make these again!!

I doubled the recipe, instead od doubling the shortening I only added what this recipe required   then equal amounts of butter. I spooned melted butter over the top after cutting them out. They were great.

I made the recipe as-is. Didn't turn out so well for me. I think next time I'll try vegetable oil and at least double the baking powder and salt. They were a little bland.

The problem I found with this recipe is twofold. First, there is no way to get 2 dozen biscuits - I managed 8 half inch thick by 2 inch diameter biscuits. Second, there was nothing but 2 crusts. I followed this recipe to the letter. I was making breakfast and couldn't find my mom's recipe so I used this one. It was first and last time to use this recipe.

Boyfriend really loved the taste of these. Paired it with Sausage Gravy and it was a hit. They didn't rise as well as I thought they would so I believe I will add extra baking powder next time, but flavor wise it was AWESOME!!

Just made a half recipe. Next time I will increase the baking powder so that they will look like the picture.  This is a good basic recipe. It is not full of flavor, it isn't supposed to be, these are basic.  You need to either use butter or butter flavoring extract for that. Subbing buttermilk would add flavor too.  Make sure your baking powder is FRESH, don't knead the dough much if at all. You don't need to roll them out, you can pat with clean, flour-dusted hands hands. This is one to learn by heart!

Made these today to take to a friend. Ate two right of the oven, and would have eaten the rest if I hadn't t already committed to giving them away. Absolutely great. Crunchy on the outside, soft and flaky on the inside. I used butter instead of shortening. Highly recommend.

I really thought they were very bland and dry.  I wish I had some helpful tips to make these better, but I don't.

My 16 year old son decided he wanted to make biscuits for the first time today. I have never had success with home made biscuits but I decided to give it a try with him.  We picked this recipe because it looked to have the highest ratings yet fairly simply.  As we have a big family, we doubled the recipe.  Based on other reviews we increased the teaspoons of baking powder to 8 for 4 cups of flour.  We upped the salt to 1 teaspoon (or 2 total). I also added a pinch of baking soda like 1/8 teaspoon and 1/4 cup of sugar.  I had no vegetable shortening so I used half lard and half butter. The mix was too dry so we had to add a tad more milk just so it would come together.  Still to dry to roll out so we just pressed down and cut out.  We forgot to dip in shortening but there was plenty of oil in them.
I have never seen biscuits rise up this beautifully before.  The whole family was amazed.  Seriously the best looking biscuits I have ever seen.
Taste wise they were the best tasting biscuits I have ever made but not the best I have eaten.  That may be due to my substitutions.  I think I could have left out the baking soda and maybe a bit too much salt.  However once we added syrup and or jelly they were absolutely perfect.

This recipe reminds me exactly of the ones I grew up eating. They are not the same as the southern biscuits that some may be used to. I made a few modifications: 50-50 Whole wheat and white flour, and used only butter instead of shortening. I'm also too lazy to dip them in melted butter/shortening, so I didn't. A lot of reviewers comment that they don't rise enough, this is probably true! I live at 6000 feet and based on other people's concerns of lack of rise, I didn't reduce the baking powder as I normally do when adjusting for altitude. These come out perfect at high altitude without adjustment!

Good. I had to add a little extra milk to form the dough...and the biscuits were slightly salty, so I would cut the salt a touch.

These were good. Fluffy and did rise well. Like many of the other postings i found these to have very little flavor. if I do make these again Ill turn them into a garlic and cheese biscuit.:) Happy baking all and good luck on the quest to finding the perfect biscuit.

My husband brought home raspberries,, his favorite, for shortcakes..  he did this a week ago and I made biscuits for the first time in a long time.. I used to use Bakewell cream but didn't have any, so found a recipe on line and made baking powder ones. sort of flat..  so I bought new baking powder,, Today he  found this recipe and I tried it,, after they were in the oven I read some reviews.. Oh no..are they going to be good or not..   THEY WERE GREAT!  No way do you get the dozen or more.. but I did get 8 normal size biscuits that had at least doubled their height, they were light, moist and flakey.. my only substitution was butter on top prior to baking.. and I always have added two TB of sugar for desserts.. Next time I will do the double batch so we have some left!

This is a nice basic Baking Powder biscuit recipe. I modified it slightly by increasing the Baking powder to 1 TBL, substituting salted butter for 2 of the TBL of shortening, using 1/4 cup of 1/2 & 1/2 and 1/2 cup of nonfat milk, soured with 1 TBL of white vinegar. I used a 3 inch biscuit cutter and got 8 nice biscuits, which I brushed with melted butter instead of dipping in shortening. They rose nicely. Perhaps not the very lightest of biscuits, but easy, satisfying and very tasty with butter or homemade jam.

I used butter instead of shortening- for flavor. I was craving my old HS home ec style cinnamon biscuits. I added 2 T Sugar, 1 t. cinnamon (guessing as I don't really measure) with powder sugar icing. They hit the spot, though not as light as I was hoping for.

I'm one of the flat people.  After they came out flat I tested the baking pwdr with vinegar and got a solid reaction, so I'm not sure what went wrong.   I don't know that it matters for anything, but I found the aftertaste surprisingly salty  Others talk about adding more baking pwdr -  even to doubling it - but in mine, it was just below the threshold of tasting "chemical-ly" from the existing amount.  I'll make these again because of such positive feedback from others.  But I'll sour the milk with 1t of vinegar for 5min prior to adding it to the (mostly) dry ingredients' bowl.  That should get a good CO2 rise going that will be sustained or enhanced by the oven spring (hopefully).

I used 5 tablespoons of melted margarine instead of shortening. I also used 1 cup of buttermilk instead of regular milk because when I use the buttermilk they are more flavorful and fluffier.

Easy and delicious for biscuits and gravy!  For those of you who say the biscuits wouldn't rise, make sure you're using FRESH baking powder!  My biscuits were at least 2" high, light, and fluffy.  I also used softened butter instead of shortening and regular salt instead of Kosher.

Very tasty biscuits. Though they didn't turn out as fluffy as I would have liked. Instead of dipping in shortening, I spread melted butter over the tops prior to baking.

I made these with butter instead of shortening.  They turned out well and were similar to pre-packaged mixes I've used (ie: Bisquick).   It was my first time making biscuits from scratch, and these were pretty easy.  I did them as drop biscuits, but next time I'll roll them to make them prettier. :)  Thanks!

The best from scratch biscuit I've made so far, but not 5 star gold. I'm going to try improving my methods, like placing the biscuits closer together while baking, and barely handling the dough. No hockey pucks yet!

I messed up somewhere along the lines in making these, probably due to the lack of proper measuring spoons etc. so the didn't rise up like the should but they still tasted like baking powder biscuits.

Turned out great even though I use butter instead of shortening. ( I also substituted part of the flour with whole wheat (about half) to up the fiber content.

I didn't dip them in melted butter or whatever, like I should have, but they were fabulous! I made them for Easter in the shape of bunnies, and there were none left the next day!

I like this recipe.  It turned out very good, the biscuits were very fluffy, and they were excellent with honey and butter.

These biscuits came out tough and dry for me.  They were lacking salt and flavor overall.  I used the butter flavored crisco as suggested, but they just were not that good.  They were too wet using the ingredients as measured which may have caused me to over work the dough.  Not worth making again without significant rework.
