The kids liked it. I added dried cranberries and raspberry vinaigrette for a bit more flavor for my husband and I. Good summer salad.

Having ham left over from Easter I made this salad. I used only ham not chicken and served it on a bed of fresh spinach with fresh pineapple cubes sliced grapes dried cranberries and blue cheese dressing. It was excellent and a fast fix.

Living in Costa Rica I needed to change the recipe a bit: Instead of ham I used a cooked pork chop. Also used 2 types of lettuce to liven things up a bit. Didnt have any grapes on hand. Chunked up a couple of slices of pineapple and tried to puree them in my blender - no go so added a couple of cherry tomatoes and about 1/8c apple Juice. The result was AMAZING! Even hubby who is not a big fan of salads LOVED this one - last week we ate in 3 days in a row! Thank you both very much for the inspiration!
