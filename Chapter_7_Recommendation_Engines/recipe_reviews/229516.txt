This is a wonderfully delicious recipe. I love making casseroles and this will be one of my top favorites.
 The changes I made were I used beef broth in pace of the water and used cooked noodles in place of uncooked. ( Have had way too many times when the uncooked noodles or rice not get completely cooked in the oven. )   But other than those 2 little adjustments the tastes are wonderful.  To anyone who reads this make sure you DO NOT substitute powdered onion or garlic, always use fresh.

The noodles were not cooked evenly.  It tasted a lot like Hamburger Helper.  My husband liked it.  I couldn't stand the smell, the look, or the taste of it.  I would definitely suggest cooking the noodles before baking.

I really liked the casserole, but it did come out better since I didn't use the tomato sauce or cheddar cheese, I used Montery Jack instead

Wonderful! Hubby and son loved it! And they can both be hard to please. It goes without out saying that this will be a regular dish. I added sliced black olives and some red chili powder. I will likely always add olives if I have them and may or may not add the chili powder. (my guys like spice).

Worked great with Tinkyada Brown Rice Spirals with Rice Bran to make it gluten free. These noodles cooked perfectly as directed. The only diced tomatoes I had were Rotel mild with green chilies, which gave it a nice little kick.

Really good.  I cooked the noodles and left out the canned mushrooms.  Why would anyone use canned mushrooms?  I would have tossed in some fresh ones, but was out of them.  Next time I will put them in with the onions and ground beef. I also used the low sodium version of Brown Gravy.

Loved it! And the kids loved it! I haven't even gotten a complaint about the mushrooms...! And I followed the recipe except I used two 8 oz cans tomato sauce and one 14 oz can diced tomatoes with basil oregano and garlic. Will make again!

The only change I made was too use fresh herbs instead of dried, and I added fresh rosemary cuz I had some to use up. It was really good! I was healing from my teeth extractions, and this was a good soft food that did require chewing so I could eat it.

I didnâ€™t add mushrooms. And the diced tomatoes I had were flavored with basil, oregano, & garlic. But I added the spices in the recipe too. I used beef bouillon dissolved in water instead of plain water. I did cook my noodles before hand too after reading some reviews. It was really good.

Delicious. I do not have a lot of time for cooking and was getting tired of the 5 or 6 recipes I already had for ground beef. Everyone loved it and it is now going to join the rotation. Hoping to add a couple more but a great recipe for a family.

Made as directed.  Turned out mushy.  The cheese flavors were overpowering.  Would not make this again.

I made this and was surprised how much my family liked it! I didn't bother measuring the diced tomatoes or the tomato sauce I just added the whole. I also didn't have an onion so I added onion powder. I did cook my noodles ahead of time per some other reviews. Will make again.

Made for the first time and followed the recipe almost verbatim. I added some pasta sauce that I had left over  from the night before. Perhaps an additional 4 oz. to the recipe,  because I prefer things to being more moist than dry. Very happy with the results. Nice fun easy dish that everyone enjoyed. Thank you for sharing. will make again for sure.

Very good recipe,  I've made this several times and I love it. My personal favorite is to use Alfredo sauce and ground turkey; skip the American cheese and just add a 1/2 cup of mozzarella for binding.

Very Good Recipe.  Better than hamburger helper, but very similar.  My kids and husband loved this recipe.

we liked this dish very much. it's very simple and fast. I gave it 5 stars because I actually was missing a few ingredients and I substituted a lot and it still turned out pretty yummy.
I used cubed stew beef because that's what I had on hand instead of ground beef. I used whole tomatoes in a can and just squished them instead of using tomato sauce and diced tomatoes. I also didn't have any cheeses except about half a cup of shredded cheddar.
I did cut down on the noodles because I felt like it was a lot and I also cooked them a little beforehand per a previous review saying the noodles might be undercooked.
will probably make again, but I think I prefer it as a topping for the noodles, instead of casserole.

My daughter comes out of her room and says, "yeah hamburger helper".  This is glorified hamburger helper.  Not bad, not great.  Made on the stove top, cut the noodles in half; way too many.

I loved this! I didn't have oregano, I think I would cook the noodles before since the ends sticking out got hard when cooking in the oven, I used an entire can of petite diced tomatoes, and I put the oven on 375.
