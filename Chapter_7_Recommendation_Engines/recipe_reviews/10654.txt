So easy. My 6 year old helped me make these with ease. We only had white chocolate chips but next time I will definately use dark chocolate. Great recipe.

They are very yummy and I made them as is written. Next time I think I will cream the butter peanut butter and sugar first. Then add the eggs corn syrup vanilla and baking soda and so on. This just seems more logical since mixing the thick peanut butter and butter into the liquidy eggs was a bit awkward.

Very easy and incredibly tasty. I used Splenda to reduce the sugar and now the cookies are a new favorite.

These are so delicious been looking for an oatmeal cookie-type recipe with choc chips and no raisins. Didn't have semisweet choc so used half milk choc and half dark choc. Also I only put 6 on a tray rather than the usual 12 as they do spread (like cow pies do!) Had to cook for about 11 1/2 minutes.

My family enjoys these cookies very much. I didn't change anything in the recipe. They are moist and chewy with a delightful melding of flavors from the peanut butter chocolate oats and brown sugar. They are awesome right out of the oven. I also experimented with adding a little unsweetened cocoa powder and a bit of extra sugar so that the color looked more like "authentic" cow pies. My 11 year-old got a kick out of that.

I made this recipe for the 1st time yesterday. My husband declared these his "favorite a man's cookie. It has everything in it we like". For him to say that means a lot! The only thing I changed is I put 4c of oats and 1/2c ground flax seed. I used crunchy peanut butter the only kind in our house. They're great warm from the oven or pop a cooled one in the microwave...with a glass of milk. Yum!

I use maple syrup instead of corn syrup and after trying these with raisins and choc. chips we decided we liked the raisin version better. We don't put in nuts. These are really easy to make keep well and are always popular with kids and adults.

My son is allergic to peanuts. I used this recipe and a jar of chocolate soynut butter. I also subbed 3/4 cup flaxmeal for 1/4 cup of the butter omitted the corn syrup reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup of each added roasted salted soy nuts and used Enjoy Life allergen free mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. I cooked them for 11-12 minutes and flattened some with a fork while cooling them. VERY tasty. Excellent for allergy sufferers. Next time I make them I will try using the Golden Peabutter to replace the peanut butter. I think I will reduce the sugar used next time more since they were still plenty sweet probably because the soynut butter is sweetened already. Raisins will make there way into this too. Great base allowing for many variations based on tastes and dietary needs.

My god this recipe is good! I was searching for a gluten-free recipe for a friend and this fit the bill nicely. I threw in a dabble of Trex (UK equivalent of Crisco) to keep them nice and fluffy after baking and lemme tell ya--these things flew out of the tin at work! I'll totally be making these again.

I was having a craving for oatmeal cookies and found this recipe. The cookies were awesome! I used a 2T cookie scoop and they turned out crisp on the outside and gooey on the inside. I followed the recipe and used butterscotch chips. My husband friends and co-workers really liked them. I will be making them again!

A very nice cookie. I made a 1/2 batch with no problem. I used chocolate peanut butter and they had a nice cow pie color. I thought they could use even more peanut butter so I mixed in another scoop of regular Jif to the last tray of cookies.These came out the best moist and a bit more puffy than the others. If I make these again I will increase the peanut butter by about 1/4 of a cup. I used a bit less sugar than called for as I find most recipes are too sweet. I like that this recipe is a flourless cookie but uses oatmeal to make it a bit healthier. Wonderful when warm.

Great recipe. Used Stevia and splenda brown sugar to keep calories down. Also used Agave nectar instead of corn syrup along with dark chocolate chips. Used the entire jar of organic pb (18oz) which was just a little over 1 1/2 cups in measuring. Cookies went 12 minutes and were wonderful. Will definitely make again.

These were incredibly easy to make - a great one to do with my 3- and 8-year-old nieces. They are very moist and chewy as well. My husband said the flavor reminded him of Nutter Butters - but with chocolate and better texture.

These were really good! I baked them longer than the recipe called for because my husband likes crispy cookies. He is a celiac and I had a bag of gluten-free oats so I was tickled to find this recipe! Thank you!

I thought I would try this recipe because I am always looking for something that may taste good that is gluten free. I have 2 grandsons that are on a gluten free diet and gluten free food is not always the best tasting. Well these were wonderful! I didn't even make other cookies for the other kids. All the kids were running out the door with handfuls of these yummy morsels. They were soft and chewy heck I loved them. I made a double batch (holy cow pies don't do this unless you want to eat lots of them) the kids and adults ate every last one of them in just a few days. This halloween I am going make these cookies and popcorn balls. Everything will be gluten free taste great and noone will feel left out. THANKS!!!!!

This recipe was easy and yummy!!!! I just assumed there was flour in the recipe until I started to bake them. Boy was I surprised. I missed one ingredient(baking soda) but they still turned out amazing! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe. by the way why is it called cow pies???? It looks nothing like a cow pattie. i should know I live on a dairy farm. lol

Hm... I guess I had some technical difficulties with these? They did not spread like cow pies:( so I had to pat them down a bit. Also after 10 minutes they seemed nowhere near done. Maybe I made them too big ( 3" diameter)? They needed to cook at least 13 minutes and were still raw-ish in the middle. However they are super yummy and maybe by tomorrow they'll have set up a bit.

This was a great recipe! I was craving chocolate peanut butter and oats but wasn't in the mood for no bake cookies. I came on here and did the ingredient search and found this recipe. It completely satisfied my craving! I made the recipe as is except that I scaled it down to 32 servings to meet the need of the amount of ingredients that I had on hand. My two- year old also enjoyed these cookies. Thanks for a great recipe and giving us something to do on a day we were stuck inside with below zero temperatures!

Pretty good cookie easy to make. I accidentally mixed out of order beating up the eggs and softened butter together first but it didn't have any adverse effect on the end product. I did have to cook these longer than ten minutes only because the ten-minute cookies weren't holding together very well. Cooling gave them some better structure but the batches done for 14 and 16 minutes were much firmer with the 16 minute cookies haying a little "toasted oat" flavor to them. They were nowhere near burning from the extra time in the oven so all in all this seems like a very forgiving recipe for those of us who aren't kitchen wizards.:)
