hands down better than any sauce you can throw on a steak...KEY to Bearnaise sauce is letting the egg yolks come to room temp before throwing them in the blender.. Temper the eggs with the wine mixture then hit it with the hot butter.. make sure that blender is on high while adding the hot mixtures so the eggs don't cook. i also use vermouth instead of white wine.

I wanted a béarnaise sauce to serve with grilled sirloin for this evening's dinner, but this didn't work out well with steak, the flavor profile just wasn't right.  It certainly thickened up beautifully and was easy enough to make, but lacked that richness and depth of flavor that you expect from a béarnaise sauce. Also, it was a little too lemon-y, and I thought it could have used more tarragon.  You can buy pasteurized eggs specifically for recipes like this calling for raw egg yolks, and I typically buy them half a dozen at at time (they're more expensive). Not a total disappointment for us because I think this would be good on steamed asparagus, instead of hollandaise, and even on a poached egg.  For our tastes, the good is that I'll probably occasionally sub this for hollandaise on some food, but the bad is it didn't work on grilled beef.  Sorry Bridgetclarke for a mediocre review.

The easiest Bernaise I've ever made! I've done the double boiler route in the past and the sauce breaks 4 out of 5 times. This method lead to a perfect sauce every time.

This is a follow up to my 5 star review of before.  For you cooks who didn't like the method, many yrs. ago I learned to make Hollandaise from a Betty Crocker cookbook (1952 version).  It has never failed, but is time-consuming.  You start by putting the egg yolks & lemon juice in a heavy sauce pan (no double boiler).  Add half the cold butter and cook on very low heat, stirring constantly.  Then, after that butter is melted, add the 2nd half of butter (must be right out of frig) and again stir constantly until melted.  The idea is you are cooking the eggs slowly so they don't curdle.  I have NEVER had this sauce breakdown using this method.  Hope this helps some of you wonderful cooks:)

I didn't have white wine so I used champagne. I cut the lemon juice in half. It was awesome!

This method in the blender is the bomb!!  For years I've struggled to make this sauce on the stove...many a tearful failure.  Using the blender completely removes the risk of the sauce 'breaking'.  Fabulous!

Easy recipe to follow.  Did not care for taste.  It looked like Bearnaise sauce but did not taste like it.  It did not compliment the steak flavor at all.

This sauce turned out absolutely perfectly.  I had to substitute onion power for the dried minced onion, but otherwise was able to follow 100%.  I used unsalted butter.  Easy, breezy.  Great on steak!

The flavor is pretty fantastic! I really did like the lemony flavor but those that do not, use less lemon. I rated this 4 stars only because it was way to runny and I had to use a double boiler which I was trying to avoid. I did not have tarragon so substituted fresh thyme. Double boiler for about 5-10 minutes and then it thickened up perfectly! I would use this recipe again but using boiler.
