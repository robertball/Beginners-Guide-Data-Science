This was really, really good.  I made it for my daughter's 22nd birthday  (per her request) and it didn't disappoint.  I doubled the whipped topping "icing" - I actually think you could do even more cause it makes it really feel light and fresh.  I would also recommend to get 2 cans of the cherry pie filling.  By the time I got to the top of the cake  there wasn't enough of it visually for my liking.  Overall a yummy cake that I will certainly make again.

I made it for a Christmas present for a neighbour. OMG it was fantastic, now everyone wants one. It was the first time I had made a layer cake. Of course I had to try a difficult one. It's important to cool the cake and then chill (I left it overnight) before cutting and filling. The cake is rich and moist, real whipped cream makes it .  It is time consuming, but worth it. Be prepared and it'll be Great.

I made this for my husbands birthday and our guests loved it. They all loved how moist the cake was and asked for additional slices to go. The only thing I did different was doubled the icing to put on the sides of the cake.

Yep! Pretty much heaven. I made this for work. I needed it to travel well, so I did not put the cherry pie filling in or on it. I took the cherries separately and had people spoon it on to their slices of cake. They liked this because they could put as much or as little as they wanted. I also didn't want to take the time to pipe the icing on the cake and I don't like the way whipping cream looks when it is used like a frosting. So I shaved an ounce of semi-sweet chocolate on top of it. It worked out beautifully.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I also doubled the whip cream to cover the cake plus I bought a 500ml container of whipping cream, so I used the whole thing. The cake was really good, a few things I would change if I make it again is omit the chocolate chips. They make the cake "crunchy and I prefer a plain cake. I let the cake sit for about 4 hours and the pieces fell apart next time I would refrigerate over night so it settles really well.

This cake was great.  I did make changes that my family loved.  I doubled the icing like the other reviewers suggested and added some vanilla to the icing.  I used a mix of sour cherries, sweet cherries and maraschino cherries (all canned)in the batter, in between the layers and on top.  I used extra cherry juice in the batter and added a few Tb of sour cream.  I used the left over Cherry juice and combined with pectin and cherries to make a gel for the middle layers.  After adding the cherries on top I melted chocolate and drizzled over the cherry top and down the sides.  It was moist, tasty and beautiful.

Double the frosting and use a pastry bag to spread the whip cream on top to make a nice presentation

No changes. Everybody loved it even those who are not crazy about chocolate. Holiday dessert for sure.
