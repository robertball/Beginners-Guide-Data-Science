This salad had a light, refreshing (and interesting) taste.  The blood oranges aren't very sweet, so the combination isn't as startling as you'd think.  It would work as a side dish for a savory meal.

I did not like this recipe. I tried it because I love avocado and blood oranges. They did not pair well together.
