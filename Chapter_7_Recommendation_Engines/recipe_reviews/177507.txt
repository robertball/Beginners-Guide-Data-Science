Oh my goodness, I haven't seen this recipe in ages!  This dip was "all that" in the '70s -  we all made it and it seemed to make an appearance at every get together.  The novelty finally wore off and it was put to rest - but now it's resurfaced and just might start making the rounds again.  One CRITICAL ingredient missing, however - add a can of shrimp!  (And maybe add the hot sauce "to taste")

I make this dip all the time for parties. The only thing I do different is I leave out the celery and I use green onion. serve warm in a bread bowl with extra bread around it. My friends and family love,love this dip. Try it warm you will love it too.

I honestly can't remember how I ever got introduced to this recipe...but when I tried it I loved it. AND it reminded me of something I'd tasted and enjoyed in my childhood. When I make it I omit the celery (never have it on hand) and the hot sauce (not a spicey person) and it's still DELICIOUS. I like it chilled, better than warmed as some people have mentioned, but make sure to try it both ways!

It's okay. We liked it but probably will not make it again.

I've never used hot sauce, but do stir in a can of rinsed and drained tiny shrimp. We eat it with small pretzel twists to "catch" the shrimp.

Make sure to use raw fish that you can saute with onions, peppers, old bay and a little green onion. This dip was well received. I should've made more!
