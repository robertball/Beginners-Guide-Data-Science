Delish! I made one minor change: I roasted the squash in the oven and used the already cooked squash in the recipe. I did this because it is so easy to peel/dice cooked butternut squash and such a pain to cut the skins off/dice raw squash.

This was dinner tonight and it was SO GOOD! I suspect the mascarpone cheese might hold some people back from making it. I wanted to include it but couldn't get to the store so I whipped together cream cheese and some kefir and it worked just fine! Maybe the mascarpone would have been even better, I'll try it sometime, but google substitutions using what you have if that's the only thing standing in your way from this creamy, and delicious pasta meal.

LOVED IT and served it for my in-laws and they loved it!  Did some modifications:  Cut my butternut squash in half, add a pool of water, and baked at 375 for 1.5 hours.  (Since my butternut squash was so large I doubled the recipe).  Once done baking I removed the peel, and started following the directions.  My local grocery store was sold out of mascarpone, so I used reg cream cheese.    I highly recommend baking the squash as it makes for a great sauce (just like regular tomato sauce and spaghetti).  The first time I served it, I did it over whole wheat pasta, the second time I used reg fettuccine - I will only use fettuccine for the recipe moving forward.  I served with garlic toast and Cesar salad!

Amazing! Didn't have mascarpone, so I substituted it with 1 cup cream cheese, 2 tbsp butter and 1/4 cup of heavy cream. I added of bit of flour to thicken the sauce and also doubled the amount of ham. This recipe is a keeper!

The picture doesn't look that appetizing to me, but this dish was surprisingly delicious!! I added extra ham and made a homemade mascarpone cheese sauce (recipe found on Allrecipes)!

Tried with Mexican chorizo, sans oil. Subbed cilantro for parsley, crema for the marscapone and cotija for the Parmesan. Delicious!

Family favorite.  I cook the whole butternut squash in the instant pot for 25 min with 10 min natural release.  I use only half a box of noodles because it makes too much for three of us.

If you see Chef John in the title , then you know it should be great.  No exception here.  The only thing  I did differently was roast the squash first (to save me time at the end).  It blended into the sauce so smoothly-- my picky daughter thought it was a cheese sauce.  Such good flavor.  Will make again and again.

I just used 2 cups of heavy whipping cream thickened with 1.5 tbs corn starch, and skipped the chicken broth (mascarpone is very hard to find, and expensive around here)
It was delicious!

This was absolutely delicious!  I used left over Christmas ham  and some defrosted frozen butternut squash. I can't  imagine it being any better with fresh butternuts, but cant't resist trying.  The combination of ham and butternut squash is terrific.  Some freshly ground black pepper enhances the ecstasy of this combination. Be certain to add the Mascarpone off heat and stir gently.

Delicious! I admit I didn't have mascapone so I used cream cheese. Next time I might add a bit more broth just to sauce it up a little more.

I followed the recipe with the exception - I used a mascarpone substitute - 8 oz cream cheese, 1/4 C heavy cream and 2 Tbspn sour cream - delicious!  I would definitely make this again.

I'm an Arabic - Southern Bell, if you can wrap your mind around that concept, and I love all kinds of food. Chef John - you are out of line! First, when the ham and fresh garlic slices are cookin' up, OMG the fragrance!  I just wanted to eat that!  This is so ridiculous!  Everything is perfection and not hard to make! I followed the recipe to the T! Did not change a thing although I questioned the amount broth, not sure if it was enough, but as you said - it was. The texture of the sauce at the end is amazing, creamy but not thick, dry but super moist and it just rests on the pasta with MAD FLAVA - so perfect! That Marscapone, cheese butter - butter cheese - MANDTORY! Gotta have it, the deal maker ingredient! Worth finding it! Thank you so much for schooling me on this ridiculous recipe!

Fabulous recipe Chef.  We had a Honey Baked Ham and I made stock from the bone and used that in place of the chicken stock.. I also added a tablespoon of maple syrup and some fresh ground nutmeg to the sauce.  What a hit!  This will be on the regular rotation going forewrd.

I was actually looking for a "spaghetti squash" recipe when i came across this.  so, i used the sauce recipe, but since i wanted to use actual spag squash in place of the noodles, i also replaced the butternut squash with frozen green beans since i didn't have any butternut.  i didn't have enough ham so i threw in a can of mushrooms as well.  it was very, very good!  i used more than a pinch of red pepper flakes, and my version was too spicy for my 2-yr old; i'll probably cut back next time.

SOOOOO good.  Really loved the slight amount of heat from the red pepper flakes.  Would probably try it with pancetta next time rather than the smoked ham.

The flavor of this was absolutely perfect! The igredients are simple and combine to make a very tasty sauce. The only critical remark I have is that mine turned out to be quite soupy. I was expecting more of a cream sauce, but it was very runny. My husband boiled the pasta and made the mistake of rinsing it, so that might have something to do with it. Either way, the sauce was quite thin even before we added it to the spaghetti. I will have to think of a way to thicken it up next time. This was still so good, I'm sure it will be a family favorite for years to come!

Very nice change using butternut squash, ham and the marscapone.  I had never used marscapone before.  It was a very nice addition.

This was my first Chef John recipe and has become my favorite fall dish. I make it at least twice a year. Finally here to review it after probably four years.

Made this tonight and it tasted great!! We’re trying to limit our simple carbohydrates, so we did substitute zoodles (zucchini noodles) for the pasta. I can highly suggest making this even if you’re on a low-carb diet!

Made it and the mascarpone cheese from scratch! Simple and delicious dish. We substituted the Ham for Turkey Kielbasa (it was in the fridge).  Very good, what we call "Rib Liner."

Wow, thanks to everyone for your great advice.  Normally, I feel pretty hopeless in the kitchen.  Somehow this turned out perfectly.  Roasted the butternut squash in the oven at 375 as suggested but it didn’t take as long, maybe just an hour.  Substituted cream cheese and heavy cream for the marscapone.  Turned out fantastic.  I think that watching the video really helped too.  Thanks again:)

Chef John comes through again!!  I only used 1/2 of my squash and 1/4 of my ham steak.  It still made a huge amount of food.  I will definitely make this again.

This is so delicious! I didn't change a thing. I tripled the recipe for a dinner party with seven people and it was a big hit! A 5.5-pound squash was plenty big enough for a triple batch. I made it in the crockpot so I didn't have to do much at the last minute, except stir in the mascarpone, and boil the pasta. I also love to use whole wheat pasta which adds more flavor. I have made this a few times and will continue to do so!

I made this with all of the same ingredients but like the squash cook done and mashed it into the sauce.  It made it extra creamy and rich.

Disclaimer: I am not crazy about butternut squash. But I did like this recipe quite a bit!  I couldn't get mascarpone cheese, so I subbed 4 oz. cream cheese.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I served this over macaroni, and my kiddos saw the orange sauce and thought we were having mac n cheese and were eager to dig in, hooray!  I think we will have this again.

LOVE this!!! I HATE butternut squash with a passion, my husband loves it... so, I made this for him & I wound up eating more than him! Only changes I made where: I didn't have ham, but had salami... I added 1/2 of a white onion & substituted cream cheese for mascarpone because that's what I had on hand.

Didn't change a thing, I did not precook the squash and I'm glad I didn't, letting the squash cook in the stock adds a lot of flavour, delish! Simple, tasty, fresh and so  easy clean up, love a recipe that doesn't leave my kitchen looking like we had a gas explosion is a very good thing.

Didn't want to go to the store to get the ingredients I didn't have. So I substituted cooked bacon bits for ham and alfredo sauce for the marscapone cheese. I also cut it in half to serve just two.  It was excellent. We both liked it and I'd make it again.

Next time I will remove the ham from the pan before adding broth and squash to cook and add it back in at the end. Makes for better looking presentation.

Very happy to find this butternut squash recipe with ingredients that I had in the fridge.  Made as written with the following changes:  Added mushrooms and used ham broth instead of chicken stock.  Mixed 1/4 c sour cream and 1/2 c cream cheese as a replacement cheese.  Very happy with the taste.  Thanks Chef John for an easy, tasty (not too creamy) spaghetti.

Great dish! I quadrupled the garlic, added a chopped onion with the garlic and deglazed the pan after this stage with some white wine before adding the stock. Also added a tiny bit of nutmeg. But really not major alterations required and it came or great!

Surprisingly tasty! Sounds a bit odd, but is good! I had leftover Easter ham & a container of diced butternut squash on sale from Kroger. Had the right ingredients for the All Recipe mascarpone substitute. So I had to go for it. Made as is except for no red pepper flakes, & I added leftover Easter asparagus for a bit more green. Spouse & I scarfed it down. ??

This is a fantastic dish.  The whole family loved it. Flavors are wonderful.

I used mascarpone for the first go round, but since it isn't something they carry in my usual store, I have tried some substitutions. 1 cup of greek yogurt and 2 tablespoons of butter is very good. Cream cheese is delish as well. If you aren't keen on the mascarpone or you just can't get your hands on any, give them a try. I've also tried some frozen winter squash instead of butternut, and that makes a wonderful sauce with a very nice flavor as well. 

Such a versatile recipe! Love it.

This is so good, I didn't have mascarpone so I used philly.  Also I didn't have parm so I used a little mustard for tang...my ham wasn't sliced so I cubed it. Totally forgot to grab some sage. But I bet that would make it PERFECT!

So yummy! I never mix the sauce and noodles at the end though. I prefer the sauce scooped on top of the noodles as each plate is served.

I added corn and fresh basil instead of parsley, and it turned really well!  Creamy amd a little bit of sweetness from the corn and butternut squash, my husband and I both loved it very much!

Absolutely delicious! I've made this recipe over 5 times. Just like many others, I changed/added a couple ingredients. Sour cream makes a great substitution for the mascarpone and tastes exactly the same (made it both ways).  Make sure to have plenty of veggies to add and personalize (mushrooms, bell peppers, baby corn, spinach, etc.) Sometimes you might have to add a little more chicken broth depending on how much butternut squash you use. Let the sauce boil a little and then simmer near the end to make it a little thicker.

I've never tasted Mascarpone before, but I substituted with 8oz cream cheese, 2 tbsp butter and 4 tbsp of heavy cream. I think it'd taste deliciously acceptable with anything similar. While I certainly recommend following Chef John's recipe if possible, don't hesitate if you don't have Mascarpone. It's a fine recipe either way.

This recipe is so good! I doubled my garlic. I omitted the red pepper flakes and used shells instead for my pasta. The shells were amazing in the sauce and this tasted even better the next day!

Everything was fine until the mascarpone cheese. Once that flavor was added, I did not care for it at all.

Excellent! The first time I followed the recipe exactly. Loved it. The next time I made it I substituted the ham for chicken and the squash for peas and carrots. I also added onion with the garlic and served it over rice. It was just as good.

Quite amazed at this recipe. It was really tasty. I swapped the ham for salami (with less in the extra salt). The children ate it all up. My husband said he was surprised that it went together
