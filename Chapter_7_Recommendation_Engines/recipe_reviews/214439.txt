I made this for dinner for my southern husband and he LOVES it! If he hadn't been home when I made it he would've been convinced it took me all day. It comes close to real Jambalaya, and is a great substitute when time is an issue.

Soooo good!!! This meal tastes like a lot went into it. It was quick and easy and I will be able to remember the ingrediants when I want to make it again. My husband and daughter loved it. However, I did use a pound of shrimp because my kids and husband love it. Great recipe!

For being a quick version of Jambalaya, this is a fantastic recipe.  I was doubtful at first that it would really turn out well without chicken, but it came out very good.  I added a few more spices in the end because it was a little heavy on the tomato flavor.  Including the time to cook the rice and prepare all of the ingredients it actually took closer to an hour (but if you know you're not going to have a lot of time you could prep everything the night before).  Still faster than my sister-in-law's Jambalaya recipe!

Pretty good...I think it would have been better with a little more "kick" to it, might be my fault because I made the recipe for my parents, who don't like spicy, therefore I added nothing very hot. Easy recipe, everyone seemed to enjoy.

My husband liked this very much. I did have to add a small can of tomato sauce to give it a bit more juice. I liked the flavors overall even though I'm not a big fan of smoked sausage. The next time I make it I'll add more shrimp and maybe chicken. It's more like 4 1/2 stars.

I liked this recipe as it does take about 1/3 of the time that it takes for me to make the normal Jambalaya that I make but I would add worcestershire sauce, dried bay leaves, parsely,  cayenne pepper, oregano,  cajun seasoning, and basil to this recipe. I also seasoned the meat and veggies while they were cooking so that the flavor would cook into the meat and veggies also. The original recipe does save quite a bit of time after the meal prep is done but it turns out to be bland if you don't add additional seasonings. Not bad at all for attempting to save time.

We didn't know what we wanted for dinner. We wanted something different but fast. I make regular all day long cooking jambalaya usually but I found this quick recipe and decided to try it. My husband is a bit crazy about heat levels in food, he loves hot and I like a little mild. We both enjoyed this recipe very much.

Absolutely delicious!!  I used chicken sausage and kicked up the spice by using diced tomatoes with jalapenos and increasing the crushed red peppers. WOW- SPICY!! I will make it again and again!!  Leftovers are amazing too!!!!

This recipe is great if you're in a pinch for time, but it needs more HEAT! I made it as-is for the whole batch, because we have a 2 year old, but I added about 1/2 tsp of hot sauce and 1/8 tsp pepper flakes to each serving for my husband and myself!

Delicious. I put the jambalaya over the rice instead of mixing it in. Makes leftovers easier. I will definitely make it again but next time with a little more sausage and a little less rice.

Totally excellent.  Totally fast.  I will definitely make this again.  
Not spicy at all but that is easily fixed with more pepper sauce.

Turned out very good.  I agree with another reviewer who said it was quite tomato-y tasting.  I added Cajun season which helped with that.  I also substituted andouille sausage.  Next time I make it, I will add chicken too.  It’s a keeper.

Just about as good as the Jambalaya you take all day to make.  Next time I make it, I'll spice it up a little more - but that's just personal preference.

I thought it was rather bland but I will try it again with some of the spices suggested by other reviews. Also thought the sauce was too thick and tomato-y so will thin it out maybe with chicken stock.

It was great and easy to make.    We had leftovers so I added extra chicken stock the next day so it wasn’t dry when reheating it.

Delicious!  I made it with turkey sausage and used packaged "dirty rice" for more of a Louisiana-type flavour.

I will definitely make this again, however I would use half as much rice, and add cajun seasonings. I also used about 3/4 pound of shrimp instead of 1/2 pound. It is an easy and quite tasty dish!

Quick and easy. I used red & yellow peppers because that's what I had on hand. It was a lot of rice so I will use maybe 4 cups next time. But the Family loved it!

I did not make any changes as it was the first time I made this. 
Will probably not make it again because everyone said it tasted just like my Spanish rice, which is a lot easier to make. I had to agree with them

made this for Sunday dinner a big hit. I thought it was good without the chicken and so did the family. We had king crab legs left over from the night before I add  that and we had beer with it gave it a little something extra can't wait to make it again. The chopping is a pain like one review commented on. I would cut the ingredients for the hot peppers in half if you don't like spicy. Jambalaya was very spicy next day.

Too much rice. I used 4 cups instead of the 6 cups the recipe stated and it is still too much.

I made this for my family but left out the hot pepper sauce. Everyone can put their own. Was delicious!!!
