Not really thrilled with this recipe.  My kids and I thought this recipe was way too sweet but that could be per our taste.  My husband did not mind and rated the recipe a 4, but I'm going with the majority vote.

my mom actuallly made this recipe for dinner the other night. she didn't tell my dad and brother the meat was turkey and because none of us had ever had ground turkey, and because it still tasted meaty, no one knew the difference! All anyone knew, including myself, was how tasty, cheesy, and scrumptious the lasagna was. Thanks Jennie O!

This recipe was really easy and quite tasty. I have made it twice. The second time I used extra lean ground beef and Barilla Oven Ready Lasagne. Not having to boil the pasta made this even easier to prepare.

Delicious!  I liked not having to cook the noodles in advance.  I also substituted lowfat ricotta cheese instead of the cottage cheese and it still came out good.  Could use a tad less sugar, but no complaints really.  MmmmmMmm...
