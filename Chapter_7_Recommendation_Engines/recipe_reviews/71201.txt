Although this wasn't bad, I was disappointed. I followed the recipe to the T, except I used a 5.5 oz can of coconut milk, which I believe is less than 1 cup. Still, the mixture came out soupy and had to be strained. My food processor (a standard Cuisinart) wouldn't blend the ginger and jalepeno to a paste, the best I could get was a fine dice. I expected more flavor from the recipe, but it turned out rather bland. Perhaps the shrimp should be marinated in the coconut milk/jalepeno/tumeric/ginger mixture?

This was just an "okay" dish that I will probably not make again.  I too could not get a paste in my blender and added two Tbsp. of the coconut milk to the mix to get a paste.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes.  The color was wonderful, it was a little soupier than I'd hoped, and even though it smelled fantastic, my husband and I both felt it lacked flavor.  Overall, not a bad recipe, but needs some tweaking, I think.

This was absolutely delicious but my wife and I took a few extra steps to avoid some of the pitfalls others were having. First, when making the spice paste it's helpful to add some liquid (we used a few tablespoons of vegetable oil) so it could actually continue to flow down into the blender instead of just turning into whirling chunks.   Next, for the coconut milk it's important to get a good brand. We used Asian Family as the milk is already quite thick. Cheaper brands are thin, forcing you to cook at a higher temperature for longer and thus risking overcooking the shrimp.  Otherwise, it turned out great and tasted like a dish you would find in a restaurant!

Since my wife is Thai, I thought I'd finally add some comments on this recipe.  For creating the paste, there's no substitute for a good heavy Thai mortar and pestle. If you don't have that, add a little of the coconut milk to your food processor. As far as the criticism of it being "bland", try using Thai Chili's or Habanero to taste instead of the Jalapeno, or don't remove the hot seeds and inner flesh when you mash the Jalapeno, (you can mash the chili's to a paste separately and be careful and taste the sauce as it's cooking, these chili's are VERY hot so don't use too much!). Also, you can add a tablespoon or more of Palm Sugar to taste while its cooking. Coconut milk will thicken more the longer you cook it, so if your sauce is soupy, you're not cooking it long enough. Add the shrimp and basil last, once the sauce has thickened.

I thought this was a wonderful recipe and would make it again. I did not have turmeric so I used curry as suggested by others.  It was super easy to make and the sauce was excellent over rice.  Very unsual dish and flavors from the 
standard.

I enjoyed this recipe quite a bit. Served it over rice noodles, which sopped up the yummy sauce well.

Instead of turmeric, I used curry.  I added a little extra ginger, and cut down on the tomatoes by about a 1/3 cup (after seeding and dicing, I had almost 2 cups). I put about a tablespoon of peanut oil in the food processor with the spices so they pureed a bit better. 

I also substituted cilantro for the basil, because that's what was on hand.  It was just fine, but I look forward to using basil next time.

Tasted like a dish you would pay $10 for at a Thai restaurant. Coconut and spices go well without an overpowering aftertaste.  The only changes I made was substituting cilantro for the basil, and using frozen, cooked shrimp.  Served over brown rice with a side of summer rolls.  Excellent.

This was so delicious and easy to make! I doubled the amount of basil and garlic because we love those flavors, but otherwise followed the recipe as directed.

I served it over a bed of jasmine rice, the timing of this was perfect! (start cooking onions when you cover & reduce heat on rice) Will definitely make this again!

I had a feeling I'd like this recipe but I ended up LOVING it instead! I cheated and bought a jar of garlic and ginger paste. (I think it's made by "Spice World" and you can find it in the produce section.) 

Truly wonderful stuff!!

Recipe had a very nice flavor.  I would recommend leaving the seeds in the jalapeno to spice it up a bit.

Followed the recipe exactly except used light coconut milk and left the seeds in the jalapeno.  It was pretty hot and very tasty.  Will definitely make again, but will cut back to just half the seeds from the pepper next time.  We served it over egg noodles.

This has a beautiful light flavor to it.  My first thought was like some other reviewers that it needed a little more spice, but then I remembered that a lot of thai dishes are light and not bold.  This is a wonderful summer dish and easy to make.  I didn't think the sauce was to thin I served it over rice and it was great.  I will make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very tasty served over some thai lime pilaf.  I added 1/2 tsp of cumin & 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper for some added spice.  I also used 7 cloves of garlic instead of 4.  It thickened up nice for me even though I used light coconut milk.  It was VERY yummy.  My 2 year old even devoured it!

Fantastic!  I used tofu instead of shrimp and added a few serrano chili peppers to spice things up a bit.  It was incredibly easy and so very yummy!  Thanks for a great recipe!

My son, home from college for the summer, made this for us last night. I am not familiar with Thai food enough to recognize authenticity of a recipe, but this was a wonderful dish.  The flavor was amazing.  All of the ingredients stood out, but none overwhelmed the dish.  There is a little bit of heat, but not to pronounced. He served this over rice noodles.  We were thinking it would also be good as a soup if we upped the ingredients for the broth. Kind of a Thai flavored bisque. We were not sure how pastey it should be, but pulsed this a few times in the processor and made sure that the "paste" was cooked through before adding the shrimp.  Be careful not to brown the garlic.  Great dish and did not take a lot of time to prepare.

Disappointing, especially after spending $$$ on the shrimp.  I followed the recipe to the letter, tomotoes were mushy, sauce never thickened, and prep took almost an hour.  I will not be making it again.

this was very good.  had to improvise a bit...used a ginger/garlic paste, and no jalapeno.  instead i used a little indian chili powder, and it gave it just the right bite.  i used some home made tomato sauce, and a whole can of coconut milk.  topped with thai basil.   served with basmati rice.  delish! thanks for the post Colleen Moir!

Not very impressed with this recipe. As others have noted, the ingredients in the first part of the recipe don't blend very well into a sauce. I had to add a bit of oil and coconut milk in order to get everything mixed. The dish was pretty flavorless, too, though had a nice spice to it (I left the seeds in the jalapenos, which helped).     My wife and I thought it would be great with some curry or something to flesh it out a bit.

This was REALLY good.  I followed the recipe pretty close to exact.  I don't understand how people said it was too mild.  Perhaps they didn't use a good jalapeno.  Or perhaps they got rid of the ribs of the jalapeno.  Or who knows...  Anyway, we really liked it.  It is soupy, but I just treated it like a curry and it was really good over rice.  Oh, I did use a can of diced tomatoes that I drained instead of fresh because I didn't have fresh ones.  Still worked.

Wonderful recipe - I did have a problem with getting the first ingredients to turn into a paste - but it did not matter, still cooked up great. It was a little runny as well, but with the rice - it is perfect.
If you are excepting heat from the jalapeno, you best add more then one as their isn't any heat in this dish.
I added at the very end with the basil, some snow peas, green onion, and some pre cooked fresh asparagus - and served on coconut rice.
When I make this again I will double the garlic, ginger root, and jalapeno for more umph.

This dish is delicious and fairly easy to make. We usually let it simmer for more like 20 - 30 minutes because we like our sauce to be thick.

Strange, bland and soupy :(

I so wanted to like this dish because it uses several of my favorite ingredients (jalapenos, coconut milk, ginger...). However, as many commented, this recipe needs some major tweaking. Overall, it lacks substance - the sauce is boring, despite its list of bold ingredients. Cutting down on coconut milk won't help this. 

As a last ditch effort, I added a titch of sugar, a dash of red chili paste and a handful of cilantro. But really, I felt like I was kicking a dead horse trying to save this recipe. Flavor lovers, look elsewhere...

This was good.  Wasn't as much flavor as I was expecting from fresh ginger and 4 cloves of garlic.  I used shrimp and tofu and my usually thai-food phobic husband enjoyed it.  Smelled really good!!  Will certainly make it again.

My daughter liked it. My husband and I LOVE thai food, but this had a taste of too many things.  It was definitely on the sweet side for our taste. We wouldn't make it again.

I pan sauteed the shrimp in the olive oil, a little butter, the garlic, ginger, turmeric a little chili powder, and jalapeno. When it was cooked and most of the 'juice' was evaporated I added the coconut milk, basil, tomatoes and green onions (sub for regular onion) and simmered for about 10 min. I served it over rice. Delicious! This one is a keeper!

After reading the reviews below, I didn't want the dish to be too bland, all I did was marinated the shrimps in the sauce for a couple of hours, (I used stir in garlic paste as I didn't have any fresh garlic) halved the quantity of the coconut milk, used frozen veggie stir fry added a couple of dashes of Tabasco sauce and lemon juice, added Udon noodles towards the end of the cooking time, it was very yummy and not runny.

I picked up a mixture of Thai spices at the local farmer's market that seemed identical to the spices called for in this recipe.  I used that instead of mixing the spices as indicated but otherwise did everything the same (except for the addition of a stalk of celery sliced diagonally).  Very quick and easy! Delicious taste.  Yes, the sauce was not thick but with rice I thought was perfect.  Will definitely make again.

One out absolute favorite dishes!! Substitute curry for tumeric and each time I make it throw some different things in it (cilantro and baby portabelas, this time). Also throw a scoop of rice in the bowl but wife likes it without the rice. Very versatile base and the jalapeño gives it the perfect kick for those that like a little heat but not too spicy.  Would give this one 6 stars if I could.

I love the flavours in this recipe. After reading other reviews I left the seeds in the large jalapeño pepper I bought because I like things spicy. I also diced up a habanero pepper for those who like to sprinkle some added heat to their dishes.

Mine did turn out a bit too soupy but after reading comments from other reviewers I turned up the heat on the stove and the coconut milk did eventually thicken - it just took a bit more heat and time than I anticipated. Overall, a great tasting recipe that I will be adding to my rotation. Thank you for sharing!

Really nice dish  restaurant quality.  I doubled the paste portion and felt that this made the dish more flavorful,  Also added some red bell pepper with the onion.  Definite keeper!

Simple, quick, and most importantly delicious! Bravo! I think it goes without saying that the basil should be Thai basil. I spritzed a lime on top just before eating. Excellent!  (note, grinding the paste also proved difficult due to the small amount, unless you're going to double up the batch I added enough water to be able to get it smoothly blended, I then cooked it a little longer to evaporate the water out before adding the coconut milk).

This stuff is just amazing! I especially liked that it did not call for cilantro or curry (of which I don't typically have on hand). The aroma was just so satiating, I was really hoping it would taste nearly as good as it smelled, and it did not disappoint! I used cayenne pepper (1/2-1tsp or to taste, I like mine with a good kick) instead of the jalapeno, and simmered chopped baby bellas with the onions, and WOW! Definitely going to be a staple on my repertoire of regulars!! I have never been so impressed that I felt compared to leave a review, but I had to share my enthusiasm about this dish! It's absolutely delightful to all the senses!

5 star's hands down! I used 2 Thai red chili peppers instead of a jalapeno and Thai basil, both of which I picked out of my own little garden! Per other reviews added some sesame oil to the small food processor to make the paste. I also used 3/4 of a large can of diced tomatoes and drained them as I did not have fresh on hand. I added the basil a few minutes (maybe 5) BEFORE adding the shrimp (which was saved till the very last)and pronounced it done once the shrimp turned pink. This was simple to make but tasted as if it took an awful lot more effort! The only change I will make next time is to use a 3rd pepper for making it as is. My plans however are to double the recipe next time for company and leftovers for the next day.

If you're expecting a spicy dish....this is not it. The flavours blend and balance very well together. The only thing I changed was to make the sauce and reduce it BEFORE adding the shrimp. Shrimp are cooked as soon as they are pink and shouldn't be simmered too long or they turn rubbery.

This was better than I expected, mainly because it seemed too easy. I had to add 2 tbs of oil to make my paste like others and used curry and cumin in place of turmeric. I also subbed out basil with cilantro because I love cilantro in Thai food and it was a perfect fit. I will keep this one on hand as it is quite delicious and so fast to throw together.

I have made this over and over.  The first time, my husband and I raced each other to the kitchen to finish off the sauce. We love it and make exactly as directed.  I find the small electric food choppers to be the easiest for making the jalapeno/turmeric/ginger paste. I also use Roma tomatoes because I think they keep their color the best in this recipe.  This goes perfectly over a generous scoop of Bazmati rice(or jasmine, anything aromatic).

Good. Will make again with changes. It seemed to sweet to me. I used sweet Vidalia onions and sweet coconut milk since it was not specific in the recipe. Also the shrimp was overcooked in an attempt to thicken the sauce a little. I will make again without sweet onions and with unsweetened coconut milk. I'm an experimental cook, read- not very good, but will try again! This recipe is worth another try.

I found it a little soupy. There was a bit too much sauce. I think adding more shrimp next time may help this.

Everybody loved this one, although I did make a few changes- Added a little of the coconut milk to the paste while processing to make it easier to blend as suggested. Also, subbed one big red pepper for the tomatoes (didn't have any), and I think this was actually way better- helped with the watery problem. Subbed cilantro for the basil, again I think this was great because it's not as sweet. Needed 1/2 tsp cornstarch at the end to thicken up the sauce. Delicious!

We really liked this and will make it again.  The only changes I made:  I added a thai chili pepper to the paste mix, and added about 2 teaspoons of red curry paste and a couple of healthy dashes of red pepper flakes to the sauce.  (we like it spicy!)

This is one of my favorite recipes!  So easy, so tasty!  Just added more basil and a lot of fresh coriander.  But this is to my taste. Thank you!

Very flavorful. Took a bit longer to prep than stated. Other reviewers had trouble getting spice paste in blender, so I used a mortar and pestle. It wasn't a paste but it melded together. I upped the spices a little bit and added curry too. I put it over chinese noodles. It tasted like in a restaurant. I will definitely be making this again.

Ok, so I read a lot of reviews before making.  For the paste I added a tablespoon of toasted sesame oil to help the garlic, jalapeno & ginger stick all together.  I added kale, mushrooms and about 1/4 of a yellow pepper in with the onion.  I added 1 whole can of lite cocnut milk, not just a cup like the recipe calls for.  The level of heat was good because I kept the seeds in the jalapeno.  But there is something major missing, and I can't exactly place it, definitely a depth of flavor is lacking. I served it over jasmine rice, which is my favorite.  I added curry powder, and that helped somewhat, but this is just too bland tasting for all the interesting ingreduents that went into it. I am really disappointed because I was soooo looking forward to this!!

this was an amazing dish and only missed out on 5 stars because I, like many others who rated this recipe, had to skip the "make a paste" part of the ginger/jalapeno etc because it just doesn't work in a blender.  I just grated my ginger, chopped the jalapeno as fine as possible.  The sauce came out creamy and delicious with a lot of subtlety. It was a lovely meal!  I served it over brown rice that I had mixed with some sweet peas.

The flavor was awesome, it was too spicy for the kids and hubby but I loved it.  I was out of turmeric so I used 1/2 teaspoon of curry powder and it was a very nice flavor.

I wish I could high-five this recipe. It was awesome. I do have some pointers...

1. I couldn't get the jalepeno, ginger, onion, garlic, and tumeric to make a "paste." It was a choppy mixture, which was fine for me because it didn't change the flavor or anything. Using a smaller food processor would have probably helped. 
2. It was pretty soupy. I don't think you need to use as much coconut milk. A fourth or half cup less, depending on the serving size. If you put too much milk, it doesn't thicken like it should. 
3. Make sure to use big shrimp! They shrink the more they cook. I used pre-cooked frozen shrimp. 

I am a pescaterian who doesn't eat dairy, so I really enjoy a lot of asian style food. And I'm a huge fan of anything spicy. The spicy was subtle, almost an after-spice. I poured the shrimp and sauce over brown rice. YUM.

This was really good. I followed some other advice and reduce the liquid content. Turned out really good. The chef even got a kiss.

I cooked this for my husband and I last week. It was delicious! I found it had a bit too much liquid, I am making it again tonight and will use less coconut milk so that it's not so 'soupy'. Otherwise, a fantastic recipe.
