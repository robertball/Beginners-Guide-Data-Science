I have to start by saying there is nothing grainy or gritty about this recipe at all. The directions are clear by saying to boil the sugar and water together for 5 minutes. Basically you are making a smooth simple syrup. The only changes I made was that I added a little extra coconut extract with the vanilla extract and when making my whipped cream, I added a teaspoon of vanilla and 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar to sweeten it up. This is am AMAZING dessert, so please don't let the poor ratings scare you away. I also love this recipe because it makes a small amount and if you have a hankering for coconut cream pie but don't have the ingredients or want to make that much then this recipe is for you!

My husband really enjoyed this dessert.  I thought the flavor was quite nice but didn't so much enjoy the texture of the coconut in the cream. If I make this again, I may grind the coconut up to a finer texture that more suits this dessert.
By the way, I don't understand the grainy/gritty comments at all.

Far to sweet, I felt like I was just eating coconut from the bag. I was hoping that because it was made with whipped cream that it would have a smooth texture but it didnt at all. When i removed it from the freezer only 30 minutes after putting it in, it was frozen and i had to mix to to defrost it and then it tasted grainy, sweet and honestly i threw it out.
