I made this for my husband and well it's really just scrambled eggs with sausage.  Since I can't get him to eat turkey sausage I used his favorite Jimmy Dean sausage.  I scrambled the eggs the same way I always do and put the melted cheese on top.  I knew he wouldn't dream of ever putting pickles on his eggs and neither would I so those stayed off.  I served this with some whole grain toast on the side.

I made my own turkey sausage from a recipe from this site, used free range eggs, fat free evaporated milk and 2% sharp cheddar cheese. My kids opted out of the pickles but I did use toasted whole wheat english muffins and assembled them like an popular fast food resteraunt sandwich......only healthier. The kids got a huge kick out of it. With the two extra, I just assembled without the ketchup and wrapped really well and stuck it in the freezer for busy mornings. Not really cheeseburger like but for us, a healthier version of a breakfast sandwich. NOTE: For an easier way to cook these eggs, just cook it like you would an omelette and when it's solid, cut it into four pieces. This way, you get a solid egg "piece" that dosen't fall out of your sandwich like scrambled eggs would.
