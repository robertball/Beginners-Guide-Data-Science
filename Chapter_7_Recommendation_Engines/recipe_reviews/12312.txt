This turned out very well.  I made a chocolate crumb crust and garnished the pie with shaved chocolate.  I also sieved the crushed fruit twice to try to remove as many seeds as possible.  The next time, I will probably increase the crushed fruit a further half a cup in order to intensify the raspberry flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Good recipe overall. Raspberry flavor is mild. Next time I will use 1 1/4 cups of raspberry puree. Also, the set was a bit too firm so I will decrease the gelatin by 1/2 teaspoon. It makes enough for a 10-inch pie.

this is an ok pie,we made it with a graham cracker crust that we put in the oven til light brown, wich i think was the best part of the pie. turned out good, but it just doesnt have the taste or texture i thought it would have. probebly wont make again since it took so long to make. didnt seem worth it.

this did not set up for me. I followed the recipe exactly. I will try again, but next time I will let the egg yolk mixture get to the consistency of custard (as done in other chiffon recipes) before removing from heat and adding other ingredients. Will also strain the seeds from the raspberry.
