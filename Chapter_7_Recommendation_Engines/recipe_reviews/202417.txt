I tripled this recipe to feed three. I ended up using small cherry tomatoes and Kraft parmesan cheese (that was all I had) in this recipe. We all enjoyed this new scrambled egg recipe. Very nice blend of flavors. I served it with homemade turkey sausage and Sugar-N-Spice (cinnamon-sugar) toast. I'll make this again.

Simple and delicious - perfect for breakfast! I used fresh garlic and added just a pinch of salt. I used milk vs. water to make the eggs nice and fluffy. I added a bit of fresh basil to compliment the tomato. The Parmesan cheese was a nice touch. Very good with a side of whole grain toast and OJ! Thanks FrackFamily5 for a great recipe!

A tasty spin to plain ole scrambled eggs! A great base recipe to make your own with added veggies.  I added basil, some sauteed onion, and fresh mushrooms.

Just the kind of recipe I was looking for. Though I wonder how long you are supposed to cook the tomatoes? I added some fresh chives, but next time will try the basil as Samba's review suggested.

Pretty good! I really upped this recipe and made a frittata out of it.....used a carton of Eggbeaters for fat and cholestrol reasons....(equiv. to about 7-8 eggs). Also used 3 ripe tomatoes chopped, about 1/2c percorino romano cheese, garlic powder, fresh cracked pepper, a pinch of sea salt, and some dried basil and dried parsley. Will use fresh basil next time. Nice and light summer dinner. Thanks!

YUM!  I love the addition of garlic salt and parmesan cheese.  It just put it over the top.  I had some fresh tomatoes and was looking for something different for lunch.  My only mistake is I should have doubled it!   Thank you FF5 for another amazing recipe!

I make something similar with eggs, tomatoes, and feta. I thought I would try it with parmesan cheese. It was pretty good to me. It is with ingredients I always have in the house, and it makes a quick meal for 1. I admit, maybe I am a little bit of a pig but I put a nice amount of fresh shaved parmesan on top too.

Love the addition of the garlic salt instead of regular salt.  I now make my regular scrambled eggs with garlic salt.

Great and easy. I’ve made it several times, adding bacon, adding Anaheim peppers, adding bell peppers. All good!

Not the prettiest of dishes, but still tasted good. I think I added to many tomatoes and not enough seasoning. Used milk instead of water for fluffier eggs. It made for a nice, light dinner when you don't know what else to have.

Yum! if your tomatoes are fresh and really juicy, you don't really need to add the water. I used the water/juice from the tomato in place of the water called for and I just had way too much moisture. The dish itself was delicious though!??

I really liked this recipe.  Used olive oil instead of cooking spray and water, which added a bit more flavor.  Also used cherry tomatoes for a little sweetness and stuck with regular salt.  Will definitely make this again!
