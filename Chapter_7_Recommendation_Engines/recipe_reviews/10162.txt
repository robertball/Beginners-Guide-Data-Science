I increased sugar to 1/3 cup PLUS 2 T.  I also waited and added the jam very last. I only swirled it in lightly so that cookies would not be the blueish-green mentioned previously. Did not use the macadamia nuts at all.  I used a 3 T. cookie scoop and got 1 dozen LARGE cookies.  They were extra yummy.  I was trying to copy the cookies at Disneyland bakeries...pretty close.

i think this is a good recipe.. my boyfriend loves it :)
but i think the key point in making the cookies is that do NOT mix the jam too well into the dough--- i added the jam at last and just mix it a bit..didnt blend it comepletly with the dough. that prevent the cookies from becoming greenish blue!!

The dough looked green, and I also didn't bake them; but I was glad I did. They are so tasty. They baked up light brown, and you could taste the raspberry. They were a hit, and I will definitely put this recipe with my favorite cookies. Mine were not flat. I used only about a half teaspoon per cookie .. also like a ball. Thanks.

Though these cookies tasted good the color is not appealing at all.  I suggest that you put in that you must use a spoon to mix the jam in to swirl the dough instead of using a mixer.

I also folded the jam in last and did not mix well.  Huge hit at the church bake sale today, one of the first things to sell.  Absolutely will make again.

I prefer my regular recipe (w/o raspberry), but these were popular.  They were a little flat and stickier than I would have liked, they were also bluer than pink.  However, I was asked for the recipe.

The cookies were yummy but I had to change the recipe for them to come out right. I added 2 Tbs more brown sugar and 1/2 tsp salt to the flour mixture so the cookies would rise and be fluffy. I also used white chocolate chips instead of the chopped white chocolate. I dealt with the jam by folding it into each individual scoop of cookie dough. It's messy but comes out gorgeous. Thanks!

These cookies in my opinion are just alright. They aren't terrible but visually not very appealing. The dough is a pretty pink tint and I thought that would be the way it stayed, however when they are baked they turn this non existent weird greenish gray color. I am not exactly sure what cookie is attached to this recipe but it certainly is not the cookie that comes out if you make the recipe as is. I found that the texture of the cookie is a little gummy.  I did add some semi sweet chocolate chips to some of the dough and I think I liked the cookies with the semi sweet chips better than the ones with the white chips. That is just my taste though. I am definitely going to try making these again but using my lemon white chocolate chip cookie recipe I have and instead of using jam I am going to use raspberry extract to see if it prevents it from turning a color that visually no one would want to willingly go and eat.

I made these with strawberry jam. I added the jam last and increased the amount. I also did not use the white chocolate and instead of macadamia nuts i used sliced almonds.   The cookies came out softer then expected, but they taste very good.

Tasty cookies, but had an off-color.  I waited until the end to put in the jam so they were not overly green.  Great with Coffee!  But not the best for presentation.

I made these cookies in previous years and really impressed my Mother-in-Law - she loved them.  I came back to regain the recipe in order to make them again.  I was careful not to overmix and was quite happy with the results.  A very tasty and special treat.

I USED WHITE CHOCOLATE CHIPS AND MADE AN INDENT IN EACH COOKIE AND 
ADDED THE RASPBERRY JAM IN THE INDENTATION AND THEN BAKED...YUM.

I think these may be my new favorite! Very easy to make. Loved them so much, I made an extra batch last night. I don't see the big blue color problem that I've seen mentioned. Yes, a little but it doesn't change the fact that these are delicious. My husband didn't even want me to make them when I read the recipe and then changed his mind when he tasted them. Another reason I made more. Thanks for a new addition to my Christmas cookies!!!

I left out the nuts, probably should have used them. The 8-10 minutes in oven was not enough, had to put them back in. They turned out looking greenish and didn't taste like raspberry very much. I would not make these again.

These were tasty, but the texture was a little gummy and (as others have noted) the cookies can turn green during the baking, which isn't fun to explain to people. I even added a little red food coloring to counteract it, but to no avail. If you're up for experimenting, I would find a way to add the jam post-baking, or perhaps (if it exists) using some sort of raspberry flavoring or extract instead.

These were good - I didn't add any nuts, but they turned out great anyway. They were a bit green, but we think that was cool. I love the hint of rasberry.

These cookies were just OK.  I did not mind the strange color but they were quite sticky and a bit too sweet.  I do not think I would make them again.  Make sure you use wax paper to layer if you do decide to make them.

If you are not a big fan of white chocolate, don't make these cookies. The taste of the rasberry was nice touch but mostly I thought these cookies weren't very good. They even looked blue when baked!
