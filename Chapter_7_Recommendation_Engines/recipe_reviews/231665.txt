We loved this chicken!  I halved it (just two of us), and I used sherry rather than cream sherry---otherwise all the same.  This is easy, delicious, and definitely a repeater!  Thanks for this recipe!

My family loves this dish. I use a cup of the sherry rather than open a can of broth for a half cup. Always have to make an extra pan of the onions and mushrooms so there's enough to go around. My daughter likes it over jasmine rice but I like it just on the plate with the sauce like a gravy over mashed potatoes.

To those of you who aren't sure what cream sherry is it's a heavier sweetened version of regular sherry. Very good.

We had this tasty recipe for lunch today because I had everything except the cheese. This was a delicious combination of flavors and fairly easy to prepare. I made only two very slight changes: I used a clove of fresh minced garlic added with the liquid and I sliced the onion vertically instead of chopping it. I picked up a nice provolone and it really sent the dish over the top. Thanks for the recipe Alisa!

This was a huge hit at my house. I did make two small changes: I used garlic instead of garlic salt and a dry white instead of sherry because that's what was handy.

We really liked this chicken. I cubed the breasts to serve it to the kids and stretch the meat. They were all starving so in my hurry to serve I forgot the cheese. It was sooo good I can only imagine how much better with the cheese on it. Definitely making this again.

Delicious! I made the recipe as I had most of the ingredients and husband & I both loved it. I did add extra chicken broth but then had to thicken the sauce with cornstarch I don't recommend as it gets too thick very quickly. I did not have sherry so I subbed cooking sherry and it was good but probably would have been even better with sherry. This chicken & mushroom recipe is a keeper plus you feel like a great cook when it turns out perfect.

We thought this was just ok. Hubs made tonight & the only thing we did different was use regular sherry cause we didn't have cream sherry. Thought it needed "something" for a spice or herb but couldn't put a finger on it. He said it was easy to make & I did like the sauce.

I followed this recipe except I used sherry instead of cream sherry. Next time I will increase the mushrooms. It was great warmed up. I served it with rice.

Fantastic dish! I doubled the sauce and used regular Sherry since that's what I had on hand. Definitely a keeper!

Delicious.  Didn't have provolone so added Swiss cheese instead. Will add to the rotation for sure!

First off I don't really measure so I may or may not have used the called for proportions of ingredients and I make broth with a base which I always make more concentrated than the instructions. I also didn't know exactly what cream sherry was and couldn't seem to find at the store. I assumed that if I substituted with regular sherry I needed to do something to add some "cream " so after saut√©ing the shrooms and onions I added flour to make a rue then added some milk with the sherry and broth. I'm not sure if that's the same as cream sherry but it tasted good. I also thought it was missing a little something during what I call "the sample and season phase " so I also sprinkled in a little balsamic near the end of cooking. It turned out great. Per our foreign exchange student I am "the best cook " and "That was SO YUM!" Thank-you for the recipe that elevated me to culinary greatness!:)
