Good flavor, but I added garlic instead of cumin.  I also added lime juice in addition to lemon.  I gave it five stars because it's really easy and a great way other than black bean soup to prepare black beans!

Very good recipe as is.  Next time I will cook garlic with the vegetables.  I will also add a seeded, deveined jalapeno pepper before chilling and use lime instead of lemon.  Excellent alternative to your regular black bean salad or when you're trying to use up the last of the season's apples.

While this recipe by itself is perfect, I did make a few alterations. I did not add any salt to this recipe, I added a green pepper as well as another red pepper. The main thing that I would suggest doing is to put the apples into a separate bowl and toss them with lemon juice so that they do not brown.

This salad was great. I've never made a salad with apples before and had some on hand. I used granny smith apples, green bell peppers, yellow spanish onion, olive oil, and black beans that were preseasoned with cumin and chili. I didn't cut my apples up small enough which makes the salad a little awkward to eat, I would recommend making everything a similar size. I used a decent amount of lemon juice as well. I think this helps keep the salad a little longer. Overall, I will be making this salad again. It's very tasty.
