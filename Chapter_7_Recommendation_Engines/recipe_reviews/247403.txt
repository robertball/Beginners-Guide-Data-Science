I made these twice because the first time I made the mistake of leaving them in the freezer for about 4 hours.  The  strawberry and the chocolate were frozen, something I did not care for.  The 2nd batch I left in the freezer for 15 minutes, as stated in the recipe. I liked them better and they were tastier.

My crew really enjoyed these for a quick snack after school.  Great idea! I used chocolate covered strawberry ice cream and it came out so good.
