1st Recipe I've made that wasn't rated yet.  My husband I could not eat this - guess I should have tasted before adding the dill seed and white wine vinegar.  Won't make this again -but thanks for taking the time to submit.

There were too many different ingredients in this. I didn't have them all, so I confess that I doubled up on some (all sweet relish, only one type of mustard). The long ingredient list didn't seem worth the extra effort. I wouldn't make it again.

Not bad! I cut back the white wine vinegar to a 1/2 tsp and the dill seed back to 1/4 tsp. This seemed to work better for me.

almost like the potato salad I make, try using dill weed instead of the dill seed it should make a differance if  you don't like the dill seed taste.

I thought this was really good - my picky fiance enjoyed it too! I used all ingredients except the eggs, olives, brown mustard, celery seed, and dill seed. After we each had a serving, my fiance added some peppercorn ranch dressing to his to give it a little something extra. I like it the way it is! Thanks for sharing the recipe
