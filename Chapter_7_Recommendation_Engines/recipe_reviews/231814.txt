The white sauce was surprisingly good.  Even the kids liked it.  The batter worked great. For some reason the fish didn't taste good, but I think that may have been something on my end.  I will definitely make it again to see what that could have been.

These were very,very yummy tacos, I did however change a few things. I like corn tortillas, and not too much a fan of cream cheese so I did omit that, but the dressing was fantastic without it. All in all this was a great meal, and my family wiped their plates clean quickly!! Thanks for such a great recipe!!!

Followed the recipe exactly. Good basic recipe . I would probably mix the sauce and cabbage next time to make a slaw. Over all pretty yummy!

I just made this recipe but served it with my own sauce recipe that I can't do without. I have to say that this is the best beer batter recipe I have ever found. Perfect ! Thanks for sharing.

I have never had fish tacos before and this recipe had me wondering why. We made this for my entire family and it was loved by all! I can't wait to make again!

We loved this recipe. Putting some hot sauce on the filets before frying them gave it a nice "extra" zing. I made the sauce and used lime yogurt which gave it a little extra flavor and what I did with the sauce was mix it into some packaged slaw and put that on top of the fish...So good....Definitely a Keeper recipe!

This is a very good fish taco recipe - I really like the beer batter recipe and frying the fish because crispy is always better!  I like Jonnie's suggestion of mixing the sauce with the cabbage - if you want less calories just use the yogurt and a little light mayo - sometimes less is better anyway - I also like to brown my tortillas in a pan until they are a little brown and crispy as well

I've made this recipe over and over again with different kinds of fish. The sauce is spectacular.  The men even take some of the sauce on their annual fishing trip. It's a winner!

Fish did not take the batter well and it sloughed off while cooking in the oil.  Very tasty, even my finicky eaters liked it.  Paired well with Tex Mex Salad

Ended up using store bought batter and just used the cilantro sauce. Partner loved the sauce. It's become a semi regular meal now.

The cream cheese, mayo, yogurt, cilantro, and lime dressing was on point! I was impressed with how awesome it tasted and so was my family! I will definitely be making this recipe over and over!

I made it and will make it again! I used Alaskan cod and improvised a few things. I didn't have cream cheese or cilantro, but the sauce turned out nicely  with lime juice and a little zest. The cod was damp despite my patting it dry. I also need some frying practice! I'll likely use a dry chili powder from my favorite chili shop in Fort Worth, Pendery's. I'm a longtime fan.
