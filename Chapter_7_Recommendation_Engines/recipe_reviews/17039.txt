This is one of those great, "What do I have in my cabinet" meals.  This was really good and easy.  Like another reviewer, I did add powdered garlic for cooking the chicken and in the sauce.  I used canned mushrooms and omitted the black olives (didn't have any) and the jalapenos (didn't want any.  The next time I make, I will add the black olives and serve jalapenos on the side.

I made this for a large group of friends and everyone RAVED about it.  Besides a little bit of prep time it was an easy dish to make for a lot of people.

I love this dish at our local "Themed" resturant and my son enjoys it as well.  I used a simple jar sauce for the red and alfreado to simplify the recipe.

This was absolutely the best pasta I have ever had! My husband doesn't like peppers so I omitted them.  I also added a whole lot of garlic to the chicken as I was sauteeing it and even more to the sauce as it simmered.  It was absoltuely delicious.  This will be a weekly staple recipe in my house.  Tastes great as leftovers, too!

The whole family really liked this. I particularly like the red cherry peppers. It gives the sauce a nice sweet and vinegar undertone. It also reheats nicely for leftovers.  I choose this recipe over another recipe for Chicken Riggies on this website because of ease of prepartion. I was not at all disappointed

Ok, I made this, and NO ONE, I repeat no one in my family liked it. I'm gonna make it one more time with different spaghetti sauce and different alfredo sauce - maybe I used bad quality sauce? I'm wondering why nobody liked it, as this recipe got some pretty good reviews! Anyways, wish me luck!

We really enjoyed this recipe, especially my teenage son.  We left out the jalapeno peppers since my younger boys doesn't like hot stuff.  We had to double the recipe.  It is very good and I've already made it twice!

The first time I had this dish was last year at a restaurant in Utica, NY, while visiting for a family reunion. The dish was a hit with all who tried it! Since then I have made this dish a few times for potluck dinners --everyone absolutely loves it and it's requested now at every gathering!! Sometimes I will make two batches, one extra spicy and one less peppery for those who can't take the heat!

This was really good. I made it for company on Sunday and everyone liked it. I didn't add the olives though, I just don't like them in spag sauce. I will however next time use homemade alfredo sauce, I haven't found a good jarred one yet! I love the idea of layering the two sauces! Thanx Kathi!

This was definitely a good thing to make.  Comfort food-like, and filling filling filling.  My honey loved it and even the 4 serving recipe will make 6 esp after adding garlic toast, and salad.   I recommend this if you are not watching calories!  lol

The other day had been the first time trying to cook anyhing in a long time. I saw the recipe and decided to make it, I glanced over the recipe and tried cooking it. It was the best meal id ever made and I used to think that id never be good at cooking. I love this recipe and I plan on making this often. :)

My daughter had this at a party and loved it. I asked her friend's mom for the recipe and she gave me one more labor intensive. I looked and found this recipe and we loved it. I did use roasted red peppers in a jar and jalapeno's from a jar because that's what I had on hand. Made two batches for a pot luck last weekend on as written and one with Italian sausage and zuchinni. Everyone loved it!!!!!!

This recipe for riggies is the best! I've always used alfredo sauce instead of heavy cream which has always made my riggies better than most. I think what makes the difference with this recipe from my old way is that the veggies cook in the sauce. Previously I had sauteed seperately like the chicken. This eliminates most of the flavor from the veggies. Cooking them in the sauce takes a little longer but gives it sooo much more flavor! Everyone asks for a dish when they hear I'm making riggies, I have to make HUGE batches :) Thanks Kathi!

Really liked it. I had never heard of 'Riggies' until I found them on here. Coming from an Italian background I like to make my own sauces and did just that for this recipe. No mushrooms for me though :)

A favorite meal to my family (including my toddler sister and dad). We did not add as many hot cherry peppers though and did not add the mushrooms. Watch Out! It is very easy to overeat with this recipe!

I totally made this mine but here are some ideas you may like to use: instead of alfredo i used a cup and a half of lowfat milk and maybe a third cup fresh grated parmesan. Skipped onion mushroom and peppers because none around, so just used half a bag of frozen veggies. Garlic powder instead of garlic. In the end I added some black pepper and cumin to give it a little extra kick.

This dish is a longtime favorite of mine. Many people also say the recipe originated in my hometown of Utica, NY. Here, we do not use jalapenos, we use hot cherry peppers.

This is a family favorite.  We have used a large can of tomato sauce and 1 small can of diced tomatoes instead of the spaghetti sauce or alfredo sauce.  I also cooked in slower cooker, but added chicken in about 2 hours before serving.  It can taste overdone if put in for the 4 hours.
