This turned out VERY GOOD! I will make again. Instead of Angel food cake I made a white box mix cake. I also used non fat cream cheese and cool whip. I didn't think it would be pleasant to crunch into apples when you were eating a mooshy trifle so I took the chopped apples and cooked them with some brown sugar and cinnamon in a pan just until they were soft.

Made this for a potluck dinner as dessert, it was a hit!  Perfect for a autumn theme.  I did think it was a little too sweet and will next time whip my own unsweetened cream in place the coolwhip (but not a sugar substitute).  Used the light cool whip and low fat cream cheese.  No angel food cake available so I used 2 pound cakes and toasted slivered almonds on top.  Will pass this recipe on to friends!

This was a big hit!  I used 1 additional apple, and next time I will use more.  I also substituted the angel food with (2) 10 oz pound cakes which held up a bit longer.  Also used lite Cool Whip and low fat cream cheese...no one knew the difference!

FABULOUS!!!  Really, really great base recipe.  I made the following modifications, and everyone raved about it.  First, I used spice cake instead of angel food cake.  I actually can't imagine it being as good without it.  The mixture of fall flavors just really made it so scrumptious.  I also substituted a 1/2 cup of the milk with a 1/2 cup of Bailey's Irish Cream, and this made the pudding mixture out of this world.  Finally, I used 5 Gala applies.  I was nervous about them browing, so as I chopped them, I placed them in a solution of lemon juice and water, and then drained the liquid out.  We're on day 2 of leftovers and the apples are still crisp and perfect as if I had just cut them.

This was wonderful. I tossed the apples with a little lemon juice so they wouldn't brown and used pound cake instead of angel food as another reviewer did. Turned out perfect.

I used 4 apples instead of 3 (and I'd probably increase it to 5 next time) and it was a big hit.  Drizzle the butterscotch directly over the angel food cake chunks and it'll soak right in.  Let sit overnight (the longer the better).  Made about 10 good sized servings.

I made this twice for pot lucks.  It was devoured each time.  I made a mistake and sprinkled 1/2 Tablespoon cinnamon instead of 1/2 teaspoon.  They loved it anyway.  The second time I made it, I accidentally forgot to add the Cool Whip to the cream cheese mixture.  Still good.  This recipe is definitely a winner and a half!

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving.   I wanted to bring something a with a different flavor other than the traditional pumpkin or apple pie.   The family said it was a "HIT"!!!    Was very easy to make & was absolutely delicious.
