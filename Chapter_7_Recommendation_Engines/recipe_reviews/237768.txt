Absolutely fabulous! I use Hawaiian sweet bread, the entire can of coconut milk with equal amount of beaten eggs, plus a little coconut extract added to the mix; it makes 1 9x13 pan plus the next size down. People are always asking me to bring it to any brunch. There are never any leftovers.

I made this for our annual Christmas Eve Brunch. Super easy and very good. Did not change anything about the recipe. Sweet enough to eat by itself and leftovers are good also! I will make this one again for next year's brunch!

This island girl is a coconut lover so this was right up my alley. LOVED it! It is on the sweet side so I had mine without any syrup or preserves. I think a drizzle of coconut syrup would be nice for a sweet tooth. Thanks for sharing AndreeV21!

Love coconut.  Nice flavor.  Need to figure out a way to make it not sooo soggy in the middle.  I usually let my bread get a little "stale" when I fry my French toast.  Willing to try this again.  Maybe tweek it some.

SO GOOD!! I used Half the amount of sugar & it was still almost too sweet. Almost.  Kids LOVE it!  I used 1tsp Vanilla, & 1tsp Coconut extract. I toasted regular bread first, &  didnt let in soak long, at all, & it was Awesome! Make sure the pan is well sprayed, or buttered. Will definitely make this one again!!

This was delicious. I had to change a few things just cause of time and availability of items. I switched the egg substitute for eggs, and I used regular coconut milk and not light. I also toasted my bread before I put the mixture on because I didn’t want it to be soggy. Other than that easy to make and my family loved it Christmas morning and making it again for New Year’s Eve morning.
