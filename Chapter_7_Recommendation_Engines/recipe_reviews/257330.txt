This is a five star recipe with a couple changes. I decided to use homemade Alfredo sauce, and because I have a pasta maker I made my own pasta tubes which cut down on time (no boiling needed). I cooked frozen chicken breasts in my instant pot, and they shredded so easily! Because I used fresh pasta I didn't have to cook this long at all (30 minutes max).

We were very disappointed in this. It lacked flavor and had a weird texture from the chicken and mushrooms I think. I added garlic, Parmesan and pepper to the Alfredo sauce but couldn't get the flavor I wanted. It was very bland. Maybe if you made your own Alfredo sauce it would be better. I also think the mushrooms would be better thinly sliced vs chopped. It was a little tastier the next day. Required a lot of Parmesan on top
