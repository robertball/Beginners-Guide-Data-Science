I made three small changes: I used a teaspoon each of baking powder and baking soda, melted butter instead of vegetable oil and I used buttermilk instead of regular milk. My applesauce was homemade. I always bake my muffins at 350 for 20 minutes. Nothing wrong with this recipe's bake time, it's just something I've always done (I bake A LOT of muffins, too!) These muffins turned out so good! Just the right amount of sweetness, perfectly moist, very flavorful. My sons and I really liked the combination of the blueberries and applesauce. Out of 12 muffins, there's two left. My sons ate most of them up this morning!

So delicious! A used frozen blueberries becuase I didn't have fresh on hand and added a crumb toping (from the banana crumb muffin recipe on this site) - Sprinkle over muffin batter a mix of 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 tbl flour, 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, 1 tbl butter.

I've never tried a recipe that had no reviews written yet, but these looked good, so I thought I'd take a chance.  So glad I did, because these are excellent!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out very well.  I love that these taste like muffins and not cake.  I got 18 muffins, not 12.  If I had filled the muffin cups fuller, I could have gotten the 12 as stated in the recipe.  But it would have been nearly to the very top of the tin, and I didn't think you should fill them that much.  Next time I make them (maybe tomorrow) I will see what happens when I put all the batter in 12 muffin cups.  Usually I try to make a recipe healthier, but this one is great as is!!  (And I do love sweets, so this isn't coming from someone who only eats "healthy" food).  My 3 year old also loves them.  Thanks Rebecca, for sharing your recipe!  Oh, and as a side note I grind my own whole wheat flour and then put it in the freezer...so it is more fresh than what you can buy at the store.  I don't know how much that has to do with how great these turned out.  Oh, one more thing!  I only had frozen blueberries, so I just added them right from the freezer.  They were not fully frozen but that's because my freezer doesn't work very well. :)
UPDATE: I made these again this morning and only made 12.  The cups look more like 3/4 full, but they rose nicely and turned out well!

Great,  I used Splenda.  I made them with chocolate chips and in another occasion with blueberries. One tip: whatever you use, cover them with flour first (just enough to coat them and shake the excess)  This will prevent the fruit (or choco chips) to sink in the bottom of the cups.

I never rate anything online, but I loved, loved, loved these muffins.  I did add the tsp. of baking soda and baking powder and used butter in place of the vegetable oil as another reviewer recommended.  I also used whole wheat pastry flour in place of whole wheat flour, which I find has a much lighter consistency.

These muffins turned out great!  I made only one change - I used a 6 ounce container of fat free vanilla yogurt instead of the oil.  They are delicious, moist, and full of blueberries.

Great recipe!  So easy and with great results.  I made these while camping and I didn't have applesauce with me so I shredded an apple to use instead.  It worked/tasted wonderful.

These are great! I doubled the recipe for 2 dozen and it made even more than that. I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using white whole wheat flour (its what I had). It probably made them a bit lighter than using regular whole wheat flour. On our way to share them at a playdate!

Excellent!  Followed other reviews that used 1 tsp b. powder/1 tsp b. soda.  Also reduced amount of blueberries per review.  Glad I did...  they are still FULL of berries.  Following another, I baked at 350° for 20 minutes.  Definitely glad I didn't do the 400°, as they would have burned!  Delicious!!

We loved these! I am counting calories so I did make some adaptions but overall...wonderful. I only used 1/4 c sugar and 4 splenda packets. I used 1tsp baking powder & 1tsp soda. I subbed the oil for ff plain greek yogurt 6oz. I subbed 1 TB egg whites and 1/4 c water for the egg and unsweetened vanilla almond milk for the reg milk. I also used cinnamon applesauce instead. This made 18 muffins at approx 77 cal a piece!

The muffins were good but nothing too special. I made another batch from a cookbook that included cinnamon and stirred in the sugar at the very end with the blueberries that were incredible.

This was wonderful!  I am trying to incorporate more whole grains into my diet, and my husband and I both agreed this was better than any mix we've ever bought!  We loved them.  I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh and olive oil instead of vegetable, but other than that left the recipe alone.  Thank you for such a great recipe!  These are now my go to blueberry muffins!

Used suggestions from another reviewer. baked at 350 for 20 min (my gas oven gets hot!) also added a crumb topping before baking (1/3 cup brown sugar, 2 Tbsp flour and 1 Tbsp butter). Used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup all purpose flour (I didn't think my kids would eat it if it was too healthy!). Turned out GREAT!

I made some slight changes to the recipe: I used 2/3cup plain non-fat yogurt instead of the oil and reduced the sugar to 1/2cup. I used frozen blueberries because I didn't have any fresh ones but I was craving muffins and wanted to get something healthy at the same time. This recipe is perfect! My muffins came out soft and moist and very blueberry :) My husband told me before "I don't like muffins" and after taking a huge bite he said "that's like the best blueberry muffin I've ever tasted!"

Great easy recipe.  This is my second time making it and it's proven to very versatile.  I've used frozen and dried berries with success and grated apples when no applesauce was in the larder.  The only other thing I'll note is that I've had to add additional milk.  Might be because of the frozen berries, but I suspect it's the King Arthur flour I'm using requires more fluid.  Kudos for sharing this recipe My4NonBlondes!

What a treat these were!  I made a few substitutions but that just goes to show that the recipe is very adaptable.  I subbed soy sour cream for the oil, used egg beaters for the whole egg and used vanilla soy milk. My applesauce was homemade.  I topped with the Fruit Pie Crumb Topping from this site.  These were quite delicious and moist.  They came together fast with ingredients I usually have on hand. I got 12 large muffins and plan to make more and freeze for the Hubs and the kids lunches.  Thanks Rebecca!

I normally don't write reviews for recipes, but felt I had to regarding this recipe! This is the absolute BEST muffin recipe I have ever tried, and I have tried many!!
I was not sure what to expect using all whole wheat flour, and not a mixture of white and wheat, but when I tasted them, they were amazing!! Moist, but not too moist and perfect! I did not have fresh blueberries, so I used frozen, which was fine. I also added a crumb topping before baking, which was just a mixture of white flour, brown sugar,cinnamon and a tablespoon or so of butter cut into it. I baked them for about 20 minutes and they came out awesome! This will definately be my go-to muffin recipe from now on!

These were excellent even with only 1/2 cup sugar. All those blueberries add plenty of natural sweetness! I also used some butter in place of some of the oil.

This very good and super simple to make. My only complaint would be that it's more blueberry than muffin - some people wouldn't call that a problem though. :)

These were seriously delicious.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added 1 tsp each of baking powder and baking soda.  I also used almond milk since it was all I had on hand.  The muffins turned out with a very light texture and a bit of a nutty taste, although next time I'll try adding a tsp or two of cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  This will be my standard whole wheat muffin base from now on!

These came out great! A huge hit for 3 out of the 4 of us in this family (My son didn't like the blueberries, but at least he tried them!)

Delicious!!!! Wow, loved the apple sauce instead of butter. I added a dash of nutmeg, a few dashes of cinnamon, and some walnuts. Thanks for this recipe! I'll be using this as my new 'muffin guideline'...

I doubled the recipe and used crushed pineapple instead of applesauce simply because I was out of applesaurce.  They were wonderful!  My son's preschool class enjoyed them instead of cupcakes for his birthday at school.

These were GREAT! I took some suggestions, such as using 1 tsp each of baking powder and baking soda and buttermilk instead of regular. I also added 1/4 C quick oats and increased the milk to 1/2 C for extra moisture. Melt in your mouth goodness! =) UPDATE: made a second time just as the recipe calls and they were still awesome! Compliments from my whole family!

Rounded my measuring cup of sugar since I know we like it sweet. Added a few dashes of cinnamon. Used 1 cup of frozen unthawed berries and these were perfect. Light, healthy and sweet. Might try with frozen sliced strawberries some time. Thanks!

Everyone that tasted these muffins that I made them for said they were really good.  They were not quite sweet enough for me, maybe just a matter of personal preference.

By the time you buy the box of muffin mix at the store and mix it all together you could be eating these and much healthier too.  I took the sugar out and substituted honey and cinnamon to make it healthier and better for the kids.  A light sprinkle of sugar on top or butter sweetens it up if it lacks any.  20 mins was a perfect time but I made 5 larger muffins out of it not 12 small.  Don't hold back on the blueberries and don't let it be too dry putting it in the muffin cups.  They will only be better with a little extra moisture.

This is the only review I've ever written on this site. I tried this recipe randomly a few months ago and have made them probably 15 times now and get tons of compliments every single time. My 2 year old loves them, husband loves them, teenagers, everyone that eats them, loves them. The only change I make is to switch 1/2 cup of the whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of regular white flour. I did it with 1 1/2 cups whole wheat the first time and they were fine, but a little too dense for our taste. Switching just the 1/2 cup made the difference we wanted. Love these muffins!

I loved these muffins! I made these for my daughter and cut the sugar back to 1/2 a cup so they would be so sweet. I also did 1 tsp of both baking soda and baking powder. I used frozen blueberries and coated with flour as one reviewer suggested. Wonderful!

I was really excited to find a 5 star whole wheat muffin recipe. I made the recipe exactly as stated except I used coconut oil in place of veg oil (which I always do). My muffins were very thick and didn't rise very well. The taste is ok if you're craving something slightly sweet but don't want to eat junk. Overall I won't make this recipe again, sorry :(

I tried this recipe tonight... and let me tell you...DEELICIOUS!!!! I used Truvia in place of real sugar then I added two little boxes of craisins and probably 2 tbsp of water. The batter was kind of thick. I loved them, definitely saving this to use again.

Just tried this recipe and it was great.  I made the adjustment of 1tsp baking soda and 1tp baking powder instead of 2tb baking powder as others suggested.  I also added 1tsp cinnamon and changed the sugar to 1/2 sugar and 1/4 brown sugar and only 1/2 pint of blueberries (son gets all wiggie if he has too many blueberries). It turned out to be just the right amount. I think any more blueberries and it would be a blueberry with little muffin.  I used light butter instead of oil (next time I will use all applesauce, but 1/2c was all I had) so I had to add more milk to get the consistency correct.  Very moist, fluffy, muffins.  You could even change it up with apples and 2tsp of cinnamon.  I pinned it and it will be my go-to recipe for muffins from here forward.

These muffins were great! I used white whole wheat flour, tsp. baking powder and one tsp. baking soda, and subbed some olive oil and some vanilla yogurt for the oil. The muffins had lots of blueberries, and, when coated in flour before being added, didn't sink to the bottom. Great recipe!

Loved it!  Thanks for all the good tips.  Used 1/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/3 cup of non-fat yogurt instead of oil, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of baking soda, and 1 cup of blueberry. Rest the same.

Fantastic basic recipe that I have now altered to Vegan. I always make recipes as they are written first and have been making this one for a while, and it's great - quick, basic ingredients. Now however, I have a child with an allergy so I am always having to re-do recipes and find that vegan cooking is the safest way to feed her, here are some changes: Ener-G egg substitute (follow package equivalents); non-dairy milk: we use oat for a nuttier flavor, but almond, or soy would be great too; and I added a streusel topping with 1/3 cup brown sugar, 2T flour, 1T Sprectrum veggie shortening. The strangest thing I did this time was a substitution; Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard and found I was out of applesauce, but had just come in from the garden with a zucchini - I subbed 1 cup finely shredded zucchini for the applesauce. My picky, allergy kiddo Loves them!

These were very heavy and dense muffins.  They rose very little.  Flavour was okay - maybe a little too sweet.  I wouldn't make them again.

These were good, but not what I expected. I wanted a less-healthy, sweeter tasting blueberry muffin! When I start behaving, I'll likely go back to this recipe, but for the time being it just wasn't what I wanted. But thanks for sharing!

I have made this recipe twice and each time my husband and picky eater children gobbled them up without knowing they are good for them.  The only changes I made for oil I used coconut oil, for milk I change to buttermilk and brown sugar for white sugar. They turned out great and moist.

These are the most delicious muffins ever. everyone in my family loved them and I will definitely be making them again. I added 1 tablespoon of blueberry juice to make them blue and a little more applesauce and they turned out great!

Very tasty and the house smelled divine while they were baking!  

Like other reviewers I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. vanilla, and substituted 1 of the 2 tsp. of baking powder with baking soda.  I used raw sugar instead of white and decreased the amount a skosh.  I also added 3/4 flaxseed meal and therefore had to increase wet ingredients (I added an egg and increased milk to 3/4 cup).  This increased yield to 15.  Baked at 350 per other reviews for 20 minutes.

This recipe was delicious.  I did modify the recipe a little bit.  I used 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda (as other reviews had mentioned).  I also used fat free half and half instead of the milk.  These came out amazing and I will definitely be making them again!

Simply delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out very well.  Moist, tasty, and good texture.  I doubled the recipe, and baked the two tins for 10 minutes longer (30 minutes).

I added an eighth of a teaspoon of cinnamon to this recipe - It's a perfect on-the-go breakfast for me.  I freeze them, wrapped individually, and when they're heated up for over a minute, they still taste like they're fresh from the oven, even if they've been in the freezer for a couple of weeks. I decided to swap out the blueberries for another fruit - apples - and they smell like heaven!

Fantastic! It's tough to make a good texture with whole wheat flour, but these came out great. No need to change anything in the recipe, except I think I had them in the oven about 7 minutes longer or so. I've made this using fresh and frozen berries, and both work great!

I just made a batch of these following some of the suggestions here - I used 1 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder and a little more than 1/2 cup of sugar. I also added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 3/4 c chopped pecans. (I couldn't taste the cinnamon so it wasn't enough.) I also baked them at 350° for 20 minutes. Bottom line: most excellent muffins! Since blueberries are on sale now I plan to make several more batches and freeze.

FANTASTIC! Added 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon and a dash of cloves and nutmeg. Used 1/4 cup brown and 1/4 cup white sugar. Used cinnamon applesauce. These came out moist, golden, and totally yummy! I love that this is a true "whole wheat" recipe and will be making this again!

Very tasty! I have made them twice in the past few days. Very fast to mix up. I did add some cinnamon and vanilla. Would be a good basic whole wheat starter and then add your own goodies. Wish it had less sugar but good all the same.

Pretty much followed the recipe except added only 1/2 cup sugar and baked in a mini loaf pan. There are 8 mini loaves and I baked at 350 for 25 mins. These are so good and just the right amount of sweetness for me. Will definitely make again!

These muffins are very yummy! I plan to make these again but with the following changes: 1) Reduce amount of blueberries - there were so many that there wasn't enough batter to hold them all together. 2) Use a little less sugar, maybe a 1/2 cup. They weren't super sweet per se, but if you're someone who typically goes for a bran or nutty muffin, you'll probably want to reduce the sugar on these a little. Overall, very good recipe.

These are the best muffins ever. Even my three year old and all the daycare children love them. We have cut the sugar to 1/4 a cup which has not altered the taste at all. Our favourite is blueberry but we have also put in strawberries, banana and as I type this we have raspberry ones in the oven made by the daycare children. We can't wait to try them they smell delicious!

Wonderful!  Very moist with lots of blueberries; and I felt ok about feeding these to my kiddos for breakfast.  Only thing I did differently was bake at 375 b/c I used a non-stick muffin pan.  Great recipe!

Cooked at 385, used one banana instead of applesauce, and half brown sugar instead of all white. Amazing! Did another batch with frozen mixed fruit I chopped in the food processor, amazing as well. Only four stars since I changed it a bit.

I love this recipe!  One would never know that it is whole wheat! Used smashed ripe banana in place of applesauce since I did not have any applesauce on hand.  Turned out wonderful and moist.

These were wonderful. I made changes only because I didn't have blueberries and I wanted to cut down on fat. This is what I did: I used dried cranberries and some mini chocolate chips in place of blueberries. I used plain yogurt in place of the oil (since there's fat in the chocolate chips). I also subbed some of the flour with wheat germ and flax meal, which I always do in every muffin recipe for extra nutrition. I also added a touch of vanilla and cinnamon for extra flavor. And also an oatmeal crumb topping with 1 T sugar, 1 T butter and cinnamon. OK, so I basically made ENTIRELY different muffins, but I used this recipe as a base to work with. When I get some blueberries, I will most certainly try the recipe as written. However, I think this is a great base for all sorts of fruits/nuts/etc. Thank you for the recipe!

I love these muffins as an anytime snack but especially after a good workout. I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and add 1/2 cup of either bittersweet or semisweet chocolate chips. They come out perfect every time!

Just made these they turned out yummy.  I didn't have applesauce so I mashed up one banana.  My batter seemed a little thick in the end so I added about another Tbsp of yogurt and milk to thin a bit.  My daughter and I are loving these.  Thanks!

I have been trying to eat healthier and since it is blueberry season I gave this recipe a try and fell in love with it.
ONE big change is I substituted the sugar with 1/2 cup of Blue Agave Syrup. 
I am now trying replacing the oil with 6 ounces of Greek yoghurt  and vanilla bean paste, hoping they taste jst as good.

These are delicious! Even my white-flour-loving husband gave two thumbs up! I did use buttermilk in place of milk, and exchanged 1t each baking powder and baking soda for the 2t of baking powder. I also added a sugar crumb topping. They were amazing!

Love this recipe! Add a few more minutes if using frozen berries. I modify by adding fresh lemon zest and a teaspoon of lemon juice to the original recipe. I also love this recipe using fresh or frozen cranberries. Cut berries in half before measuring the 2 cups of cranberries, and add a teaspoon of grated orange peel and a teaspoon of orange juice. Yum!!

These are incredible, but I did make a couple of tweaks, not much! I used white whole wheat and the texture of the muffin was light and moist. I thought they might need a little more flavor so I added a scant teaspoon of cinnamon and a half teaspoon of almond extract. I had leftover crisp topping (flour, oats, brown sugar and butter) so I sprinkled a bit on the top for appearance. Beautiful muffins!

This recipe is an incredible base. It has great flavor, but I found that the batter was far too wet and the muffins ended up being a little mushy. So, I made a few changes to bring this recipe from a 4 as written to a 5.

I've made these three time. The first two were to see if the recipe really did need modifications. It did, so this is what I did to the third try:

I followed the recipe exactly, but added a cup of old fashioned oats and increased the baking powder to 2 1/4 tsp. I also used plain yogurt instead of oil to cut down on the fat, and that swap was just fine. Note: The recipe is good with oil... I just wanted to make them healthier.

Amazing. I wish I'd packed more than one in my lunch bag today!

I enjoyed these!  I don't normally like whole wheat snacks since they tend to feel heavy and dull to me, but these muffins are light and fluffy.  I think I still prefer white flour, but if I'm planning to make something WW, this is a good recipe to go for.

Perfect! I've used this recipe twice in the past week and I it has already become my basic go to muffin recipe! 
First time - substituted frozen blueberries only because I didn't have any fresh on hand. I also, by accident baked them at 350 for 20 min. but they came out absolutely beautifully! My family devoured them!

Second batch - used frozen cherries cut in half, toasted almonds, added a little cardamom & cinnamon. DELICIOUS!!! At least half my family prefer these over the blueberry and we LOVED the blueberry!!!

Thank you so much for sharing a whole wheat recipe that works so well and is so adaptable! LOVE IT!

Excellent recipe and I feel better about eating them because they are whole wheat.  I did use white whole wheat flour and 1/2 frozen and 1/2 fresh blueberries and I did use the brown sugar, cinnamon, flour, butter topping on them that another reviewer suggested.  They were easy and very tasty!!!

I have made these muffins several times and they are fantastic!  The only thing I do to them is sprinkle a little cinnamon and sugar mixture on top of them before I stick them in the oven or sometimes I substitue 1/2 c of the flour for 1/4 flax meal and 1/4 wheat germ.  Great muffins!

I was slightly skeptical about using whole wheat flour only and not a mixture of white and whole wheat but these turned out amazing. I tweaked the recipe a bit and added chunks of canned pear, it was delicious and moist.

I didn't have any veg. oil or white sugar in the house so I made some changes.  I used hard white wheat flour ground at home, a bit less than 3/4 of cup of sucanat in place of white sugar, buttermilk rather than milk, coconut oil rather than veg. oil, and frozen bluberries rather than fresh.  I was honestly a little worried how it would turn out but they were great!  Really delicious and the kids liked them too.  I think you could cut back on the oil, especially since you're already using applesauce.  Will definitely make again!

I didn't have unsweetened applesauce so I cut the sugar to a 1/2 cup - I shouldn't have, they weren't sweet enough for my taste! If you've only sweetened applesauce, no need to alter your recipe (unless you don't care for sugar).

This muffin recipe is a keeper. When I realized that we were out of blueberries, I decided to substitute strawberries. I also substituted a half cup of the flour for almond flour, simply because I had it on hand and was trying to use it up. I also added a few drops of vanilla extract. The end result was moist and delicious. Watch the muffins when baking at 400°; I thought mine were browning too quickly, so I backed the oven temp down to 350° about half way through.

I make these for Valentine’s Day. My husband LOVES blueberries and these were perfect. I used a tsp of baking soda and a tsp of baking powder. I also sprinkled the tops with course grain decorating sugar. They were a pleasant surprise- just the right sweetness.

I followed the recipe and found the muffins did not rise much. They were still delicious. I see other reviewers suggest using 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda, instead of 2 tsp baking powder.

My 9yr old was worried that whole wheat flour would make these bad, but she really liked them. She was excited it made 12 instead of just 6.

LOVE the fact that it is whole wheat and still delicious.  The blueberries "pop" in your mouth.  Each muffin is around 186kcal, 7gm fat, 29gm carbs, 3gm fiber, and 3gm protein

This has become my standard blueberry muffin recipe, it’s delicious! I have made it as is, and the recipe is delicious as written. If anyone is wondering how it turns out subbing in almond milk, the answer is it’s great! My daughter has a milk allergy so I sub in almond milk for the milk.

What a great recipe! I have been baking with whole wheat flour for over 5 yrs & these are the most moist muffins I've ever made. I followed as written but added a touch of spice that my family likes. It is fabulous & not too sweet. Thank you for sharing :)

Best. Muffins. Ever! I crave these. They are unbelievably good when they are fresh out of the oven. I reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup. I have used frozen or fresh berries, have used a frozen triple berry mix in place of the blueberries, and I have made a vegan version as well as the original and they are amazing even with the changes. Go buy some berries and make these! you will be so glad you did!

I was skeptical, but they are just delicious!!!  When compared to other recipes or commercially made blue berry muffins, these are fabulous!  More fiber, less oil and sugar - and only 5 WW points!

These were too salty in my opinion. Next time I'd cut the salt in half, and add a 1/4 t cinnamon. I like the recipe as a base, though!

Like someone mentioned, way better to substitute 1 of the teaspoons of baking powder with baking soda. Makes them lighter and fluffier. I’ve made these using stevia instead of sugar and it tastes great. I’ve also added spinach to add some greens for the kids and you can’t even taste it! I add 1 teaspoon of vanilla or almond extract and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. I also replace 1/3 of the floor with wheatgerm and sometimes ads some rolled oats to it. I sometimes sprinkle a pinch of cinnamon and brown sugar and top which gives it that extra sweet and crunchy kick :)

These muffins are fabulous! I made them for a small group gathering and one of the women then asked me to "please" make them for a larger quilting retreat that was coming up. I like to substitute almond milk and have used both fresh and frozen blueberries (slightly thawed).

I made them and they turned out moist and delicious. I took the advice from other reviews and used 1 cup whole wheat flour 1/2 white flour, added 1 tsp cinnamon, used 1 tsp of baking powder + 1 tsp baking soda, added  1 tsp. vanilla and only put 1 cup of fresh blueberries. I also used brown sugar instead of white...I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes and they came out fluffy and moist . The next time I make them I will add a cinnamon sugar topping . enjoying with a glass of milk right now !

I only made one small change. I didn't have apple sauce, so I substituted it with pineapple juice (weird i know). The muffins are moist and the right sweetness. Saving this one!

I've made these many times. They are my go to "healthier" muffin recipe. Delicious flavor, great texture, only trouble is they are hard to get out of the pan and tend to break a bit. But still taste wonderful. I usually add a crumb topping of brown sugar, oats, little flour & butter.  I've also ran out of applesauce and have had success with using plain yogurt.

Fantastic recipe! They turned out super moist and fluffy. I added 1/2tsp baking soda, used butter instead of vegetable oil, buttermilk instead of regular milk, and baked in tiny muffin cups for 20min at 350*. What a fantastic recipe!

Very good flavor, especially considering they are 100% whole wheat. But they were actually too soft. I may try them again with a bit more ww flour and lower, longer bake time.

I love the texture of these muffins...I altered the recipe in that I used 1/2 cup sour cream instead of the applesauce at first...but after adding the whole wheat flour decided it needed more moisture and added 1/8  of a cup of applesauce to the all mixed batter...oh...and i added about a 1/4 cup of chopped walnuts to make them even more healthier.

These blueberry muffins are my new favorite. Less sweet than a lot of muffins and so good. I only made a few changes based on what I had available. I replaced the applesauce with plain yogurt because I didn’t have applesauce. I used 2 cups frozen blueberries straight from the freezer since I didn’t have fresh, and I baked them at 350 for 30 minutes. Absolutely perfect and the blueberries really shine!

Perfect as is.  Don’t skimp on the berries.  The more, the better.  Any berries, including Mixed berries work well. Over time I’ve made a few changes that make them even better.  Instead of applesauce I mash an overripe banana and a handful of berries.  I add 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  I push the berries in after I put the batter.  So sweet and delicious and healthy!  Huge hit with everyone.

used fresh blueberries from my garden, added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract.  These were very moist almost cupcake like muffins.  They didn't get a chance to cool.  I'm sure thawed frozen blueberries could be used (usually less expensive) but they were so good with fresh picked berries the family opted to wait until we had a crop again.

More filling and yummier than anticipated!

We don't like blueberries taking over the muffins so much.
For our family of six eaters, we doubled the recipe yet halved the blueberries. So 1 cup of blueberries for double the mix. That was just the right amount of blueberries for us, and we had a few muffins leftover.

This is a fantastic muffin recipe! I used splenda and added the juice of one lemon & the zest of two because I adore lemon & blueberry flavors together. They turned out great, I'll make these again soon!

This was great,  Tasted so good.
I didn't have enough blueberries so I added a can of peaches drained and cut up. It baked 25 minutes. It did not rise as much as I expected but still turned out good. Had leftover batter that I tried putting in a pan like a pancake, didn't quite turn out but it still tasted good.
Will definitely make this again.

For whole wheat, these are great! However, I reviewed suggestions from others and used Greek yogurt (strained) instead of oil, less sugar, equal parts baking soda/baking powder 1 tspn. Also sprinkled some cinnamon. I've used thawed blueberries and wild from the farmers market. Either way, I've made these 4-5 times now and always a hit with much less guilt!  Oh, also cooked at 350 for 20m instead of 400

I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, half cup all purpose flour, Greek yogurt in place of oil, added some cinnamon and vanilla, used 1/2c stevia baking sugar and replaced unsweetened almond milk for regular milk. It made 12 muffins and according to MyFitnessPal pal they're 78 calories each. They aren't crazy sweet, but taste delicious to me! Will make again, its a good base recipe. Could also use any other fruit, apples or strawberries if you have that instead of blueberries.

This is a great basic lower-fat muffin recipe that will stand up to a lot of customization. I've made it at least 20 times since finding it with variations every time. You can add cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamon, vanilla, or whatever your favorite spices are that morning. You can change out the fruit as long as you keep the total volume the same. Frozen fruit works fine just adding a bit to the cook time (around 4-5 min). I play with the percentage of whole wheat and white flour to find a mix that my kids enjoy and the recipe holds up to that. I've even reduced the sugar by a third and the muffins still have great texture. The only thing limitation that I will note is that whole wheat baked goods aren't as lovely the next day. So I use silicone muffin cups and freeze the batter in individual cups, pulling out and cooking the number I need for breakfast that morning. It adds a few minutes to the bake time but fresh baked muffins disappear into my children like magic despite being low-sugar, low-fat and whole wheat.

Modified the ingredients to make 18 muffins but only used two cups of berries, still plenty and these were so moist and delicious!  The muffins were on the small side but perfect for a snack.  Liked how healthy the ingredients were, too!  A keeper!

Used premade powdered milk, and olive oil, & brown sugar. Halved the frozen blueberries because they are larger than wild blueberries. Came out perfect. 12 kids and 2 adults loved them. Filled to 3/4 mark - made 12 per batch / tripled it. Freezes great !

I love this! I did make changes though. I add Cinnamon and Vanilla. Sometimes I replace the applesauce with banana. The only problem I have with this recipe is it is rather dry. I cook it for 18 minutes instead of 20 minutes. The dough is also sticky so its hard to put in the pan. Haven't figured out how to make it more moist.

Great recipe. My husband complains about So many whole wheat flour recipes, but this muffin recipe is the best. I did add cinnamon and vanilla, because they are muffins and why not? But these are great. Love that there aren't 1200 ingredients. Easy enough for me to make on a weekday morning and keep on going. Thanks!!

Made these in the cupcake tins and they still came out perfect! My first blueberry muffins, or cupcakes, made. I'm willing to try another recipe but debating because... iif it ain't broke, don't fix it.

I love these muffins My family ate them up quick and raved. I did take the suggestion to use 1 t of baking powder and baking soda. I also used cinnamon and instead of sugar used Stevia. I rolled the berries in flour as suggested and they were spread even throughout the muffin.  The muffins were light and raised beautifully. I filled the muffin tins to the top and they had a nice rounded top with a yield of a dozen.  I baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes they were cooked perfect. 
The second time I made them I doubled the recipe and added raspberries and blueberries. I liked these even better. After analyzing the ingredients these were only 97 calories per my fitness pal app.

8 8 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/218614/whole-wheat-blueberry-muffins/ ... These were made fresh this morning.  Pretty yummy!  I subbed half cup white for half cup wheat - not wanting them to taste "too brown" so they'd be eaten.  I added warm spices so the color doesn't make ya think "brown," if ya know what I mean.  'Could sub more, but it was very slight, the brown flavor.  Subbed 1t soda for one of the ts of powder - meaning 1t soda, 1t powder.  The spices I added were 1t cinnamon, 1/2t nutmeg, 1/4t cloves, 1/4t allspice.  Surprisingly, it doesn't taste spicy, just good.  I reduced sugar to a scant 2/3c & it was fine.  Oh (sorry!  ;D), I used 4T margarine (melted) & 2T oil.  A cup & a half blues were good.  Is that a pint?!?  :)

This recipe is fantastic! I made them as recipe stated the first time and they were delicious! The second time I used 3/4 c each whole wheat and ap flour, added a packet of instant banana oatmeal, increased the  baking powder to 2 1/2 t. and added a 1/2 t.  of cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg to the dry ingredients. I also omitted white sugar (I was out) and added 3/4 c of unsweetened applesauce, a1/3 c of brown sugar, and a t.  of vanilla to the wet ingredients. 
Both were wonderful but my son preferred my tweaked recipe best (he's 7). Thank you for posting this recipe, it's a keeper!

I made this recipe as written, and we all agreed it had too many blueberries so next time I will just use 1 cup of blueberries. I used frozen blueberries coated in a little bit of flour and they worked just fine.

We normally hate anything whole wheat, but had some flour to use up.  I used frozen blueberries (a lot) and used butter instead of oil.  I also added some cinnamon.  They were delicious!  I would definitely make them again.

This is a great recipe for whole wheat flour. I didn't have any applesauce so I added two bananas instead. I took the advice of coating the blueberries and chocolate chips (I did both) and just added them to the flour mixture and added the mashed bananas to the liquid mixture. Then I folded in the liquid mixture to the flour mixture. So quick and easy! And delicious!

Definite hit with the kids. I didn't give it 5 stars because I used only 1/4 cup of sugar and sweetened vanilla almond milk.  It was plenty sweet that way with less sugar.

This is my go to blueberry muffin recipe.  I typically do not have applesauce in my pantry but I do have a flock of free range chickens so I use two eggs and no applesauce and the turn out fine.  I also use extra light tasting olive oil to get in those healthy fats.  I also grind my own flour and use 190 grams of fresh ground soft white wheat.

Excellent muffins! I substituted the oil with an equal part of vanilla greek yogurt and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I also had to use frozen blueberries since I didn't have any fresh ones. I had to bake them about 25 mins (five mins longer) at the suggested 400°F and they turned out great! Will make again.

Second time making these and they are very yummy. Super moist. I used only 1/4 coconut oil and sub-ed the difference w apple sauce, added an extra teaspoon of baking powder, reduced sugar to 1/4 cups, reduced blueberries, added a teaspoon of vanilla extract & made oat crumble topping! Delicious!

We loved these muffins so much that we've made them three times in the past week. After the first batch, we reduced the sugar to 1/2 C and we used strawberries instead of blueberries because that's what we had on hand.

I made these for Easter potluck breakfast at church. I baked two dozen & there were NONE left & everyone whom I talked to said they were “delicious!” Of course I ate one & they were moist, slightly tangy-sweet (must be the applesauce) & a nice warm brown color (the wheat flour)! (addition: I make them every year for Easter potluck & there are never any left over!!)

Yum!   I read the reviews and did use 1 tsp each baking soda and baking powder.  These are moist and full of blueberries.  They will be a regular offering at our house.

This recipe was flexible and easy.  I used yoghurt instead of the milk, cut back on the sugar and blueberries a bit, followed others advice about a tsp of baking soda and a tsp of baking powder, and sprinkled a combo of brown sugar and cinnamon on top - delicious!  We'll use this again.

If you don't have applesauce, just use vegetable oil instead, and add 2/3 cup milk.  Works AWESOME!!!

Used  white flour  instead of wheat. I'm sure they are good and of coarse better for you with whole wheat flour, but  I just  like mine less dense. and fluffy.

Best muffins I ever made!  Made them once and now make a batch every week.  I use regular applesauce as opposed to unsweetened and cook for 22 minutes instead of 20.  Fantastic!!!

These muffins were a snap to make and quite good. I made with  white whole wheat flour. I didn't have any apple sauce so I used plain yogurt instead. I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. Also used Frozen blueberries.  It sounds like a lot of changes, but I don't usually plan my cooking ahead of time and end up having to do few substitutions. This review could be helpful to someone in need to know if these substitutions can work..

I did not like this recipe. It was too sweet, too light and didn't seem to have any substance to it. It left a sweet aftertaste in my mouth. I will not make this recipe again.

I used cone sugar instead of white sugar and reduced the amount to 1/3 cup. Used maple syrup instead of apple sauce (I don't have apple sauce at home). The taste is good and not very sweet which fulfilled my purpose. The only concern that I have is the top is brown but a little bit too hard. That's nothing I can improve as it is made of multigrain four. (multigrain flour is  healthier than whole wheat flour)

This is probably one of my favorite blueberry muffin recipe i've every tried! Since i didn't have milk i used buttermilk and i actually think they work better than milk. Also, i used frozen blueberries which i think work better than fresh because they won't squash or discolor the muffin:D definitely a keeper!

Quick, easy and delicious. Like one of the readers suggested, I used buttermilk and butter in place of milk & oil. I also replaced the sugar with Stevia, (18 packets according to Stevia web site). Delicious, my son loves them!

I baked these tonight.  I did not use all of the prescribed sugar, added a little cinnamon and a quarter cup of maple syrup in place of apple sauce, which I did not have.  It was too dray and clumpy so I added a little more oil and milk, and another egg.  Finally, I added one-half cup Chia seeds.  I ran the numbers and each muffin is 40% of the recommended daily fiber intake.  Turned out great.

Made just as instructed except I did cut down the blueberries to 1&2/3c. They were delicious. Next time I'll try some spices & flavoring.

Yummy muffins!  I added 1 tablespoon of vanilla, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also baked mine for about 18 minutes at 350 degrees.  My 2-year-old loved them :)

Nice muffins, turned out well. Used this recipe as a starting point. Halved the sugar, used chocolate almond milk instead, included carob chips, a tablespoon of thickened chia seeds, replaced half the flour with oats.

My daughter and I baked these today and they were a big hit! We added a little cinnamon and a little nutmeg which added a great flavor. They didn't rise a lot, maybe the suggestion of baking soda would help that. But they were moist and delicious and the whole wheat flour gave them a nice heartiness.

These muffins are fantastic!  All I had on hand was green apple applesauce, which is quite tart, but they were still good.  I used organic sugar, sea salt, and almond milk.  I also personalized this recipe by adding close to a teaspoon of almond extract to the batter.  Really, really good!

I just tried these today, I made a sustitute for the oil....I used coconut oil and it has a slight coconut taste. It turned out beautiful and a healthy alternative. Next time I think I will add the baking soda and buttermilk instead of regular milk. I will definitely bake them again.

Super good! I added pecans for a little protein boost- I wanted something healthy to grab on my way out the door to drink with my coffee. I thought the batter was a bit dry so I added 2 or 3 extra tablespoons of applesauce. These are heavy and filling but sweet and satisfying!

Loved it! Like other reviewers, I used 1 tsp each of baking powder and baking soda and melted butter instead of oil. Also, my mother's blueberry muffin recipe (which I love but I was looking for a whole wheat option) adds 1 tbsp of sugar mixed with 1 tbsp of lemon rind for the tops of the muffins just before baking.
Delicious!

I was looking for a muffin that i could make on Sunday, and grab and go through out the week. I didn't want to fill my kids with empty sugar/calories so this was perfect! I use frozen mixed berries for a little variety and I also add 2 tbsp ground chia/flax blend to add omega 3s, fiber and protein. Success! My kids love them!

These were awesome.  So easy to make.  I used pear sauce instead of the applesauce I am allergic too.  Used frozen blueberries. Delicious.

Just made these with a few changes and OGM are they good...preheated oven to 350 and cooked for 30 min. used teaspoon each of baking soda and baking powder used 1/3 cup cinnamon applesauce in place of the oil and used 1/3 cup sour cream instead of milk and added a teaspoon of vanilla and used 2 cups frozen blueberries..will definitely make these again it even made it to the recipe book..

Made these this morning and they turned out great! Super moist, great texture and flavour. I made a few changes, I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, frozen blueberries, 1tsp of baking powder and 1tsp of baking soda, and I also added 1/2tsp of cinnamon as per some of the recommendations in precious comments. Totally recommend this recipe!

I used my own homemade apple sauce for this recipe so it had a hint of cinnamon which was delicious.  I found the muffins to be a bit too moist but overall they were delicious!

I used berries that I had picked and then froze, and followed the recipe. Absolutely delish, I just made them and the hubby has already grabbed 3 of them, and he doesn't eat baked goods very often! Thanks SO much for sharing this recipe, I'll be using it often! :-)

I doubled the recipe and used half wheat, half white flour. They were delicious!  Not too sugary but flavorful and they came out exactly like the picture!  My family devoured them!  Even my daughter who usually doesn't eat muffins.

These muffins were really good. I usually use white whole wheat flour for these recipes as it makes for a lighter texture. I didn't have applesauce so I substituted 6oz of vanilla yogurt.  I also added 1 tsp of vanilla.  I used 1/2 c sugar in the batter and then sprinkled some on the tops before baking.  It gives the muffin a nice crunch topping.  I will definitely make these again. The texture was very light.  I think others who altered the baking powder amounts may have caused theirs to be denser.

I think I must have done something wrong, but I thought I followed the directions.  I've made lots of muffins- some considerably more complicated than this recipe.  Some of the other reviewers added baking soda and reduced the baking powder.  Maybe that's what I should have done because mine looked clumpy and didn't rise well.  They were also not very sweet- or not sweet enough for me.

I read a few reviews, and opted to alter the recipe by using all whole wheat pastry flour, and using 1 teaspoon each baking soda and baking powder. I also baked at 350 for 20 mins - needed 2 mins more in my oven. The muffins were very moist and tender. Very happy with this recipe, will definitely make again and again.

After reading many of the reviews I tried these muffins using some of the changes others made. I used 6 oz of FF yogurt, 1 TBL of egg white with 1/4 cup water, added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and like many others I used frozen blueberries. Loved them. Tasty, moist, low calorie and low fat. Thanks to all for the recipe that evolved from your changes.

Very, very good recipe. I did make some changes, based on other reviews and what I had on-hand. I used 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda; 1/2 tsp cinnamon; for the 1/3 cup oil i subbed 1/2 (about 2 1/2 T) melted butter and the other half (to make 1/3 cup total) plain low fat kefir. Also used the kefir in place of milk. Oh, and I used coconut sugar in place of white sugar. The muffins were moist, fluffy and delicious. A keeper!!!

These were moist and yummy. I used Truvia in place of the sugar and it was great. I also used 1/2 cup garbanzo flour, 1/2 cup oat flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat and some chia and flax seeds instead of all whole wheat flour  and it turned out delicious. I also used frozen blueberries. Highly recommended.

This is a definite keeper. If you have ever been weary about making muffins with just whole wheat, you don't have to anymore.  Sooo yummy. I liked that it wasn't too sweet and you have the ability to adjust this to your taste.

I love these, and everyone I know who tried one loves them as well.
I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and used sweetened applesauce (accidentally) and they turned out great. I also sprinkled them with confectioners sugar. I ate 3 the first time I made them, and I have another batch in the oven now. Thanks for this recipe. I really think the pint of blueberries makes them extra special.

These are fabulous! So easy to make, too. I'm trying to send my kids to school with homemade, nut-free snacks instead of processed, packaged ones. Muffins I've made in the past were "too healthy" to pass muster, but the boys loved these! Making another batch now. Next time, I will try the tip to swap out the oil with vanilla yogurt - and probably drop the sugar a bit, too.

Its great and very easy to make.  I made some adjustments just to see what would happen and it turned out even better.  I headed everyone's advice and added 1 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda.  I added about 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp lemon zest and substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour with some oat squares I decided to turn into dust.  Because I added this pulvreized cereal, I reduced the sugar to a little over 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup.  Oh, and I didn't have any applesauce, so I used non fat plain yogurt.
All in all, it was extremely moist with great flavor.  A perfect breakfast muffin!

I used honey instead of sugar, coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and frozen blueberries instead of fresh, because they hold up in the batter rather than breaking apart. I send my toddler off to daycare with healthier versions of muffins all the time, and these look and smell great!

Needed a quick recipe for a "last minute" brunch arranged by friends, but was tired of overly heavy holiday fare. This recipe, with modifications suggested by Sarah Jo (1 tsp baking soda plus 1 tsp baking powder, melted butter in place of vegetable oil, and baking at 350 for 20 min) worked perfectly. I also added a dash of cinnamon. The muffins not only tasted fantastic, but were very light. Everyone loved them. The only complaint was that I had not brought more. My new favorite blueberry muffin recipe!

We love it! I used strawberry applesauce once and peach applesauce another time - both were fantastic. I always use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil when possible for additional nutrition (you have to melt it first). I also use frozen blueberries since we are in Wisconsin and fresh blueberries are hard to come by most of the year; frozen worked out just fine!

I mix it up the night before and put the prepared muffin pan in the refrig, then bake them up in the morning. So good to have hot, healthy muffins in the morning (would like to find out how to cut the sugar down to make them totally healthy - ideas?).

I did a double batch/experiment with this one. I made two batches, one with blueberries and one with raspberries.  All I had on hand were frozen, but I think fresh would have been much better (not as much liquid?).  I'll have to try it.

Also, I only have 2 muffin pans, so I made half of each flavor as regular size, and half as mini-muffins.  Some of the mini raspberry ones were a little more difficult to get out of the pan, but not horrible.

Both turned out very moist and delicious.  I'm trying to make different types of muffins to have on hand for a quick breakfast, and I think this recipe would be great for just that.  It seems that it'll be very easy to just alternate different fruits.

I followed Sarah Jo's advice & used 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, & replaced the oil w/ butter.  I replaced the milk w/ extra apple sauce and added about 1/4 cup chia seeds (great fiber, protein, & Omega-3s!!) I also used frozen wild blueberries.  THEY WERE GREAT!!  My 5 kids loved them & I highly suggest doubling the recipe:)

I made these but I did some changes that others recomended. I am new at baking and I think I messed up some how!! I did the 1 tsp of Baking soda and Baking powder, I took out the oil and replaced it will apple sauce but still left in the 1/2 cup of apple sauce, I also took out the egg yolk and put in a 1/4 cup of water.  Baked at 400 for 20 mins and they were NOT done so cooked for another 6 mins.  I let them cool for about 5 mins and we went to eat them and they were stuck to the paper!!! What did I do wrong??? I am sure its because I changed the recipe so much but I really want these to be as healthy as possible! I am a heavy person so is losing weight and need them to be healthy plus for my son as well. Any tips??

Excellent!  I used Greek yogurt instead of oil to lower the fat.  Also used frozen blueberries that we had picked ourselves.  Think 1/2 c. sugar would be enough.  Muffins were moist and the blueberries very juicy!

I made these with whole wheat pastry four and blackberries instead of blueberries, and they were delicious!  The only thing I would do differently is add some lemon juice.

I LOVED these muffins. I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup..used ff greek yogurt in place of oil and used frozen blueberries.I make these for my kids for breakfast so I want them to be a bit heavy. I add 1.5 cups of multi grain oats as well. I also have doubled the recipe no problem..and I have made a combo of reg size muffins and mini muffins. Just watch for the minis to come out sooner.

These muffins were moist and delicious. I used a small jar of baby food for the applesauce since I didn't want any left over. It worked out perfectly.

amazing!!! these are delicious! I used 1 t baking soda and 2 t baking powder.  I made a second batch using some ripe figs in addition blueberries to equal a pint. A keeper for sure! I used walnut oil and 2 egg whites in one batch and canola oil in another.  I also used coconut/almond milk. Any way you try it, these are wonderful!

These muffins were very easy to make and didn't take very long to bake.  I did not have any applesauce around so in its place I added one small banana - mashed.  I also went half and half with blueberries and with cranberries.  I'm sure any berries will taste good with this recipe.  They got the approval from my boyfriend and I plan to make them again.

I made these muffins for a brunch and were they ever GOOD! I used evaporated cane juice instead of sugar.  It's great to have a recipe using wheat flour that is so moist--this recipe is in my Allrecipe's Recipe Box--I don't want to lose it!

Very forgiving recipe--my favorite kind! I substituted oatmeal for some of the flour, used yogurt rather than applesauce, chopped some fresh cherries instead of blueberries and shredded some carrot in there and added raisins. Turned out beautifully. You could do a lot with this recipe.

I changed some things b/c of what I had on-hand and after reading other reviews.  I would give this muffin a 4 or 4.5, but not a 5.  

1 t. each of baking powder and soda
greek yogurt (honey flavor) instead of the oil
lite cinnamon applesauce instead of the plain
egg substitute
soy vanilla milk - a little more than a cup
frozen blueberries

I ended up with 13 muffins filling so 3/4 full and they "overflowed", so make sure to stick with 2/3 full and get about 15 muffins.  Also, I baked at 350 degrees and they weren't done, so I had to add 3-5 more minutes and increase the heat to 375.  When I baked my second leftover batch, baking at 375 the entire time only took about 15 minutes and they came out the same.  With my substitutions, my (13) muffins were about 110 calories each.

This was definitely one of the better tasting whole wheat  muffins. I used 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 regular sugar and turned out great.  I too dusted the blueberries (frozen) with flour.  I was a lil leary of too many blueberries but it was fine.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

So tasty!  I've made these muffins about 5 times now and they are perfect.  I follow the recipe exactly.  They taste far better than any white flour blueberry muffins I've had and they feel like a wholesome breakfast rather than a cakey dessert.

These were awesome, but I , like others, made some changes. I didn't have whole wheat flour so used unbleached white flour. I added a tablespoon of ground flax seed, cut back the sugar to about half a cup (perfect!) and didn't want any oil in them so I smashed one over-ripe banana instead. Again, perfect!! Delicious!

These muffins are pretty good considering that they are completely made with whole wheat flour (I used stone ground) and very easy to make with little fat (I used no sugar added applesauce). The top of these were a bit crunchy while the insides were still moist.  Not sure if I will make them again, though, wasn't crazy about the aftertaste. If you are sensitive to sugar, you may want to decrease the sweetness a bit.

Very moist and tasty! I only used about half a cup of sugar (because I used a crumb topping on them), 1 t of baking soda, 1 t baking powder, and a single serving size cup of blueberry vanilla yogurt instead of oil, the reduce the fat, and I actually didn't have vegetable oil on hand! I also took the advice of other reviewers and coated the blueberries in flour before mixing them in. Can't wait for my boyfriend to get home and try them out too!

So moist and yummy! I added a tsp of vanilla and they were perfect! The recipe makes 30 mini muffins.

These weren't sweet enough. Very blah. I think, next time, I'll brush the tops with some butter and add a sprinkling of sugar crystals to give them a little more of an "ooh!"

These are delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly, and the cooking time was right on the money.  I'm trying to do more and more with whole wheat, so I'm glad to have another good muffin recipe!
