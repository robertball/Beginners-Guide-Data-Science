They're nice!!! True, they aren't terribly sweet but sometimes that's o.k. too.  Be creative; add brown sugar to the tops before baking and/or reduce the amount of rhubarb or add some chopped apple or strawberries or banana to the rhubarb! I will make these again.  Oh, they also rose beautifully and the aroma in the house is heavenly.

they weren't sweet at all and the orange was to overpowering.  I will try to make rhubard muffins out of a rhubarb bread recipe.

Very good basic recipe.  I added a cup of chopped walnuts, increased the orange zest to a tablespoon, and like other reviewers sprinkled them with brown sugar.  If eating the same day as making I would use melted butter in place of the oil (better flavor).

Excellent!  I didn't have enough rhubarb so I threw in a handful of strawberries and they were delicious.  Took 40 minutes to bake, however.

These were good but unfortunately the orange was the most dominant flavor.

I just made these, and made a couple of revisions.  I used 1/4 the amount of orange zest so the orange wouldn't overpower the flavour.  I also used 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice ( which has cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and all spice.)  I substituted Stevia for the sugar.  They were done in 23minutes,  although the tops weren't Brown ( because of the no sugar.)
I'll make these again; yummy!
