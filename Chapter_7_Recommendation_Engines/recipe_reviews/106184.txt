Really good!  I seasoned chicken breasts with sea salt/pepper/garlic powder.  Browned them in olive oil/garlic for 5 minutes on both sides then transferred to the oven at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.  While they baked I used the ingredients for the sauce plus a dash of italian seasoning.  I added all of this to the left over olive oil/garlic from browning the chicken.  It turned out great!  I served my chicken and sauce over leftover rotini plus pasta and my husbands over leftover rice.  Great easy meal that I think my kids will eat and will always have the ingredients on hand! Thanks!

Great base for a sauce.  I added lemon zest, some fresh thyme, a little dry white wine and some freshly ground pepper.  I roasted some boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I had seasoned with salt, pepper, thyme, rosemary, and olive oil.  Used this sauce over the breasts.  Wonderful way to keep them tasty and moist for a crowd.

This is a super good, easy recipe. My daughter is continually asking for chicken and rice, and there's only so many times you can do that before you never want to see chicken again. I have resorted to finding many many ways to make my chicken so everyone in my house is happy. I do have to say that this is one of our favorites. What I do is, cut chicken breasts into bite size pieces and sprinkle with lemon pepper. Then I brown them in a little oil along with diced onion. When the chicken is cooked I add the sauce ingredients (doubling, but we like ours extra saucy) I then let the mixture simmer until it is bubbly and serve it over rice. Thanks for the idea!!!

this is really good! I used milk instead of water to make it creamier and richer, it was awesome! I love the perfect balance of lemon and chicken flavor. Mmmm!

This was surprisingly good, the taste was very nice, I also added white wine and lemon zest, I think capers would be too salty, the soup itself is already pretty salty, sauteed mushrooms in garlic and put them over chicken before the sauce..then put a little of the sauce over the broccoli...delicious!

sooo easy! and versatile. I wanted to serve it over salmon and angel hair; so I used cream of mushroom soup instead. And from another user I got the idea of adding a little white wine. Very good results.

This was lovely. I served this mixed into spaghetti, with a little grated parmesan on top. The only changes i made were adding a little italian seasoning like many have suggested, and also a tsp of sugar in order to battle the sharpness of the lemon. Rather nice!

Yummy and easy.  I had breaded cutlets/small pieces of chicken and cooked that in large pan.  Then put the cooked chicken in the oven to keep warm and made this sauce by deglazing the pan with about 1/4 of white wine and the ingredients listed here, but I skipped the butter and added dried thyme.  Super easy and delicious over chicken, rice and broccoli.

I made this tonight with chicken tenderlions...its was pretty good. I added 2 cans with about 1/4c of half and half instead of water, half of a large lemon juice, & lemon zest. Browned my tenderlions after they marinated over night in olive oil, garlic powder, & thyme, added the sauce and let simmer for about 5-10 min. Turned out really nice....this is a keeper! =)

Really good! I cut chicken breasts into bit-sized pieces and browned in a frying pan with a bit of oil and butter. Then I cooked mushrooms in butter. Added the sauce and served over rice. I also added a bit of Italian seasoning as others suggested. Quick and tasty supper.

It was strange, because as I was cooking this recipe I was tasting frequently. Each taste I thought, "Wow what a miss." and after a while I even disliked the test tasting because alone it was so horrible. But when I served it over some simple baked chicken sprinkled with lemon pepper, it was AMAZING. My entire family ate up every last bite. Next time I plan to try it with fish. A very surprising hit that I will for sure add to my list!

Fantastically Delicious! Even my 3 and 4 year old ate it! I made this to go over baby spinach and feta stuffed chicken breast and Ditalini pasta (I did not have orzo on hand). I did add some Italian seasoning. I have been looking for a good lemon sauce and this one is SO easy to make.

This is a wonderful sauce!  This sauce can be used with practically anything!  I added 1/4 teas red pepper flakes to kick it up a little and lemon jest.  It is just delicious!

Maybe it's just me, but this recipe was just bad. I followed the recipe, and after tasting it, I realized that it was like eating tart mayonnaise. I had to heavily doctor it to make it edible; adding curry powder, sugar, French Thyme, and Dill. After that it was much better.

This sauce is excellent!  We made lemon-pepper chicken and used this sauce over the chicken and mashed potatoes.  We did 3.5 tbsp lemon juice instead of 2 tbsp.

Love this recipe! I'm rating 4 stars because I modify it to our liking.  I've used with both chicken and shrimp and my family can't get enough!  I used fresh garlic, lemon juice, and basil.  I also add a touch of salt, some fresh ground pepper, and minced onions.  For the chicken I made a side of rice pilaf and for the shrimp I served it on fettuccine.  Next time, however, I will use angel hair pasta because I think the fettuccine was just a bit too thick to pick up the sauce.  Oh and with the shrimp I added capers for a bit more zest.  I will make this over and over again!  Thanks for sharing!

This was quite nice. I had a few chicken breasts on hand that I dipped in an egg wash (with salt and pepper) and then breaded in crumbs and garlic powder. Baked the chicken for 27 mins in 400 deg, then covered with this sauce (doubled the recipe so we could have extra). Served with potato dumplings in caramelized onion, delicious!

Quick, easy, and delicious!  I substituted one tablespoon of minced garlic for the garlic powder.  We're big fans of garlic in this house. :)

I hated it and my husband went without dinner because I made this. This is an expensive waste of items that would have been much better without this sauce. Don’t waste your chicken this way....

My husband loves lemony dishes.   Although he dislikes milk and dairy items.  The thought of making a lemon sauce and having to use heavy creams would not go over well.  He eats vegetarian meals six days of the week.  So, I came across this recipe and it went over really well.  I did add a little more lemon juice.  He loves this lemon sauce  recipe on several different dishes.   
its quick and easy to make.  Love it.

Wow! for the little amount of effort it took for this recipe, this is amazing! I just grilled chicken, microwaved frozen broccoli and poured the sauce on top. Will definitely be making this again soon!

I cut up chicken cutlets seasoned salt/pepper/garlic powder. Browned them in olive oil for 20 minutes.  In another sauce pan, I used all the ingredients for the sauce. Once chicken is done.  I placed the chicken in the sauce and simmered for about 10 minutes then served it over rice.  Loved it!

This recipe was delicious! I didn't have chicken breast so I used chicken legs. I chopped 2 garlic cloves seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and browned it for about 1O mins then I followed the recipe! I served the chicken over Uncle Bens wild grain rice. It was delicious  ! My husband and sons  loved it.

Great base. I used WAY more lemon because I'm a lemon nut and I'm thinking if I added capers, it would be a great quick "francese" sauce.

I have used this recipe many times and I was just asked to make it again! It has a wonderful flavor. I used 2 Tbs. of dried cilantro in mine. I put this sauce over washed chicken (leave on most of water), coat with flour, then rub with chili powder. You put half of an inch of oil in the bottom of a frying pan until it is bubbly. you fry the chicken for 4-7 min on each side. Pour the sauce over and it is amazing. Tip: put your chicken between 2 pieces of saran wrap and hammer it down so it cooks evenly

I took the advice of others and added lemon zest and a little white wine. I juiced a lemon rather than use bottled lemon juice. A good mild sauce that I served over baked lemon chicken (recipe on this site) and brown rice. Very good!!

this was really good.  I used low sodium cream of chicken.  It is best if you use lemon zest instead of lemon juice and thyme like one of the reviewers said.

FABULOUS! I had cream of asparagus soup on hand so I used it. YUM! I added the italian seasonings suggested, and poured it over cheese tortellini and chicken tenderloins. The best--hubby and grandkids raved!  A keeper, thanks for a great recipe!
