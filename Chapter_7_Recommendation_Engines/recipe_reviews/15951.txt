An authentic Hoosier Sugar Cream Pie does not have a prepared cooked  filling.  The ingredients are combined and poured into an unbaked pie shell. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Bake the filled pie at 450 for 10 minutes, then lower oven to 325 degrees and bake for 50-60minutes until you can insert a knife in the center of pie and it comes  out clean. You may have to cover crust with foil for first 35 minutes or so to prevent it from over browning. Here in Indiana we use flour, not cornstarch to thicken our cream pie. We use WHOLE milk for the milk too. If you prefer to make it more traditionally, cut the butter down to 1/4 cup and add it by teaspoon into pie shell after you pour the filling into it. Sprinkle nutmeg over top. Sorry to make so many changes but this is how we do it here in In and our pies always set up very well.I sell many many cream pies throughout the year. Yum. This recipe has a rich history here in Indiana where it began in the Amish community when they ran out of their winter apples. Also was baked in the Shaker community in Eastern Indiana.

The pie was easy to make and the flavor was wonderful, however, the pie did not set up.  The recipe calls to "simmer" the ingredients.  Thickening agents such as cornstarch do not come to their full thickening power until boiled -- I will boil for just a minute or two next time I make this pie to see if that helps it set up.

Very tasty, but the double boiler part did not work so well for me. I finally bagged the double boiler and just put the pot on the stove with direct heat while monitoring it very closely, and it was fine. You DO have to bring it to a boil for a minute or two; just not longer than that. The flavor and texture of the pie was great though, and it did set up well for me. Will make again!

This pie is wonderful, I had never had sugar cream pie before and was making it for a co-worker. I decided to make two for my husbands grandparents and they loved it. Actually everyone did, they all said it couldn't have been better - and trust me these people know their sugar cream pies! I just made it two days ago and already people are wanting more! Once again this is the best recipe out there for sugar cream pie.

Flavor was excellent.  Made this for my son Patrick who says it is good but Wicks is a little better.  Our only problem was it not setting up.  Does anyone know what those of us who have this problem are doing wrong?

Best tasting sugar cream pie I have made.  Tastes like the Wick's Pie Co. sugar cream.  Made two and neither one set up to firm.

I grew up in Indiana and my family on my mom side was related to the Durbin's. This is the recipe from the Durban hotel in Richmond Indiana. This recipe has been in our family since before I was born in 1960. Wicks Schmick's, this is truly the best sugar cream pie from the Hoosier state! Forget the double boiler, I use medium heat with a heavy sauce pan, and after stirring in the cornstarch and milk mixture I whisk the ingredients consistently until it just starts to boil and and gets very thick like pudding. I prebake a Pillsbury pie shell, (family and friends think it's homemade), place the filling in the cool pie shell sprinkle it with Nutmeg (cinnamon is a wonderful substitute) and bake in the oven for 5 to 8 minutes. All of these people who are having trouble with the pie setting up are just not bringing it to a high enough heat and having the patience to stand at the stove and continuously whisk the ingredients until they are thick like pudding. I live in Florida now where many people have never heard of this recipe. People beg me to make this pie!

this is excellent and not too heavy.  Next time I make it I plan to put fresh fruit around the top, because I think the combination will be great.

Never heard of a sugar cream pie until my 90-something neighbor cheerfully reminisced about her younger days and she happened to mention her misadventure with a sugar cream pie that ended up in the Connecticut River!  Fortunately, this recipe was more successful and I enjoy this humble pie in her honor.

Update 11/9/14-- I never had much luck using the double boiler method. I use a medium size heavy saucepan, over medium heat. This is an absolutely wonderful recipe, that always gets rave reviews every time I make it. It is begged for by the family at gatherings. Please give this a try, you won't be disappointed!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------







Perfect! I made just as stated, only I baked it for 10 minutes instead of 5. This recipe is a keeper for sure. I have made three of these now to rave reviews from family at a reunion. Everyone states they think it is better than Wicks brand. Thanks for sharing! Is this from the Durbin Hotel in Rushville, Indiana? If so, they were known for their wonderful food!

Wonderful recipe! I made exactly as the recipe stated and it was perfect.  I can't wait for an occasion to make this again. Tastes just like the Wicks pies I used to get in Indiana. Thank-you!

Our first effort set up and tasted just like it did 35 years ago.  I only wish a Dusing, Ball, or Durbin were here to cut it.  We jokingly searched for and then found this recipe.  Nice to reminesce via our taste buds.  Thanks for the posting.

Very good recipe. It's funny how everyone tells a different story about this pie. In the research I've done, it could have come from Indiana pioneers, Amish, Shaker, Pennsylvania Dutch Country as well as pioneer Quakers. Most have no eggs or butter but some do. Three main ingredients seem to be brown or maple sugar, heavy cream and flour in a pie shell. Some make the filling before putting in the shell and baking, some you don't bake the filling, just the shell and the oldest seems to be the finger method. Put the three ingredients in the unbaked shell and stir with your finger so you don't break the crust or turn the cream to butter and then top with nutmeg and bake for about an hour.  Some are thick like a pumpkin or custard pie and some are more gluey. However you make yours, this is a good recipe also. Amazing history behind this pie!!

I'm going to go ahead and give this pie an extra star for subtlety.  I did all my cooking over medium heat - no double boiler.  I might have let it go a little too long because it was pretty custard-y before I even put it in the oven and it never really boiled or simmered.  My fiance and I hemmed and hawed over it, but in the end decided it was pretty tasty.

Ive made several various recipes, this is the best, not quite a Wicks, but is wonderful. A secret is to use very a very fresh jar of nutmeg on top,if yours is old, get new, it makes a difference!! Im going to use fresh and grate it next time.

I'd have to agree with Bredbaker, this is not a sugar cream pie. It's very good, though it didn't satisfy my craving for sugar cream pie. Just seems it should have a different name. Mine turned out perfectly, but I realized the term "thickened" is lacking in clarity judging from others comments. I was wondering while cooking just HOW thick is it supposed to be.  I'd describe it as "pudding thick", if not a bit more.

I have made this pie several times now, and it's the best. Sugar Cream Pie is my husband's favorite pie in the world, so when I found this recipe, I was excited to try it. It was wonderful, my husband asks for it all the time. I have made this pie with both salted and unsalted butter and prefer it with the salted butter. It just has much better flavor. Thank you for sharing this recipe E. Sexton, I'm sure it will be in our family for generations to come!

This is the first sugar cream pie I have ever made and it turned out PERFECT!  I made it for Christmas Day to share with family and it got rave reviews!  I left it in the oven longer than what it said (wanted to make sure it was hot all the way through so it would set up right)  I had to be extremely careful taking it in and out of the oven so it wouldn't spill.  I used a 9 inch pie pan instead of 8 (didn't have one), and it filled it to the top.  After it cooled, it set up perfectly.   I will definately make this again!

I was not familiar with Sugar Cream Pie, and maybe that's the problem, but when I made this I was a little disappointed (granted, my crust turned out horribly, so I'm sure it was partially my fault).  It just didn't have as much flavor as I like in a pie, but again, the more delicate flavor (like rice pudding) may be the norm.  Personally, though, if I'm going for a mellow flavor, I think I'll stick with the rice!  Will probably give another chance, though...

Not sure if the 5 minutes in the oven is correct......I left it in for 30 minutes and it never set up.  The pie was ok tasting but nothing that I would make again.

I have tried several recipes because this is my husbands favorite pie.  They all have failed miserably, BUT this pie is OUTSTANDING!  So smooth, rich and creamy.  Tastes so much like the WICKS sugar cream.  This will be my final search for the pie...thankyou

This recipes holds memories for me. I thought I would never find a better one.
Eating at the Durbin Hotel was part of my childhood.  Sugar cream pie is a lesson in patience.

Sorry, didn't like this at all. It took about 20 mins before the filling even started to get thick. Then after being in the fridge overnight it set up to a gooey consistancy. The taste was like overly sweet flour. There was no flavour to it at all. Think I will stick to egg based fillings from now on!

I've been making this pie for years....here's a couple of suggestions! The best way to ensure the corn starch doesn't lump up and ruin the pie is to incorporate it into the butter.  I use the same measurements...1/4 c (not rounded but don't even the top) 1/2 cup of butter, 1 cup white sugar and 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2.  Be sure to cook 5 minutes AFTER the pudding starts to thicken, stirring constantly.  Sprinkle generously with nutmeg and bake for 7 minutes.

I've made many sugar cream pies in my day, but this one is the BEST.  I did add 1 teaspoon vanilla.

I love this pie! I have made it many times. I've also made it with fat free half and half, which is also delicious and a lighter Alternative. It's an easy pie to make but just don't tell anyone that part... They will never know!

I have an extensive background in cooking. On my sisters birthday I ask what kind of cake she wanted. She said she did not care for cake but loves Sugar Cream Pies. I had never had much luck with making sugar cream pies. But, didn't want to buy one. I found the recipe easy to follow. The double boiler worked very well and ensured no scorching. The flavor was excellent. and maybe an original Indiana Sugar Cream pie isn't made with a prepared filling, I find this the best yet. My sister will eat it tomorrow. I will let you know. P.S. (I bought a Wicks just in case.) But I am sure she will love it.

I made this for my Father who absolutely LOVES sugar cream pie, and he ate every bit except for the one piece I got to eat myself ^_^  Much tastier than a wick's and definitely worth the effort.

I had never heard of sugar cream pies before. I was looking for a recipe for banana cream pie, but decide to try this instead. Took it to a family dinner (put bananas in the base) and the family loved it. Incredibly rich! Oh... I forgot the nutmeg and it was still great.
