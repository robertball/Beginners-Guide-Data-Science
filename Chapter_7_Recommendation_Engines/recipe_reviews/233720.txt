As far as the ingredients go I made as written but for the cooking instructions I did not. I really wanted to but I just couldn't bring myself to putting raw meat in the bun. Maybe I am wrong but I would think you'd end up with one soggy bun saturated in grease not to mention a very overdone top bun. Instead I rolled the hamburger mixture into the best hot dog shape I could and baked them on a cookie sheet by themselves and then added the buns on a separate sheet towards the end. I also chose to use shredded cheese just so I could use less of it. These were okay and a great way to make meat stretch further but I didn't care for the texture of the oatmeal. Growing up my mom added oatmeal when making meatloaf and I didn't like that so maybe it is just a personal preference thing.
