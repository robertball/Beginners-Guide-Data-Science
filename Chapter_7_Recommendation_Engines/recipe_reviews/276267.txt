Don't expect them to taste like donut shop ones. But they are pretty tasty! Love how they're baked not fried. Had to play with icing a bit, bake them longer, and only made 20 VS 24 according to recipe. But these aren't faults of the recipe. We dropped choc chips and cinnamon chips in some. Left a few plain and not iced. Kids had a blast making and decorating. Something different than muffins and cupcakes. Will make again!
