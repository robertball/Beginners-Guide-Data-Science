Excellent.  I made this last night with Christmas Turkey leftovers from the freezer.  I used frozen broccoli but I cooked in microwave and then let it drain in a strainer and then dry on paper towels to get the water out.  I used light cream instead of heavy to save on calories.  And I added panko bread crumbs on top - just a personal thing with crunch.  Otherwise, I made as directed and it was fabulous!  To the reviewer who said this was too salty, please note the recipe said "salt to taste."  I'll definitely make this again - the wine was perfect in the sauce.  And thank you for a recipe that didn't include canned soup!!!!

I skipped using frozen broccoli and used fresh. I think frozen broccoli would have a tendency to make things too wet. I chose this recipe post Turkey Day simply because I had all the ingredients in house. I thought it would be a little too rich, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was rich, as one would assume looking at the ingredients, but not overly so. The little bit of wine really helped elevate the flavor. I think this recipe will be a "go to" for all our Thanksgiving leftover needs. It's a keeper!

This was very easy to make, and used up the last of the T-Day turkey!  I substituted brown rice flour for the regular flour to make it GF; used fat-free evaporated milk instead of cream to save on calories, steamed fresh broccoli instead of frozen, and added some FF mozzarella cheese to the jalapeño-jack cheese that I had on hand.  I served it over rice and it was simple and delicious!

I made this, for the 1st time, last night. Wow was this popular! Everyone had three helpings and poof, it was gone! I used fresh broccoli and evaporated milk because it was all we had. I sauteed some onions & minced garlic, in the butter, with a pinch of crushed Tyme and a splash of the wine, before adding the flour. This was served over rotini. I must say, it was refreshing to make the siauce, from scratch, rather than dump in salty cans of soup! This recipe is simple, quick, comfort food. Will definitely make again.

Easy and tasty! I added cheese to the entire sauce pot (was lazy) and it was great. Added chopped mushrooms and peas, it's a versatile dish. If you don't have cream at home, use 1.5 c milk and 1c broth (keep to 2.5c liquid total).

Oh the sauce! Oh the sauce! Oh the sauce! I didn't have leftover turkey so I bought rotisserie turkey slices from the deli. I microwaved a bag of broccoli for 5 minutes. I made the sauce as described, except left out the cheese. My husband was giving me a hard time because I spent next to no time cooking in the kitchen. 20 minutes in a convection oven and dinner is served! He cleaned his plate and came back for seconds! It was not soupy at all. Rich, thick and delicious! The wine and the cream made this sauce special. This is a winner!

I altered this so take my review with a grain of salt. I had leftover turkey deli meat, cheese, broccoli, mini-bell peppers and sliced onion from a party that I needed to use up. I steamed the broccoli, sautéed the bell peppers and onions and put them all in the bottom of the dish. I made the sauce as written, though I can't be 100% sure that it was all Monterrey Jack cheese that I used since it was a mixed cheese platter. My 7 year old son said it was "disgusting," but he also doesn't care for broccoli. Hubby and I liked it.

Good flavor, but extremely soupy. Strange because the sauce was thick before baking it!

My husband thought it was good, so I'll be making it again to use up turkey leftovers. I found it a little bland so I will add some onion and a bit of garlic to the next batch and see how that goes.

This came out very good. I used broccoli that you prepare in the microwave.  I just cooked it  less than recommended.  I would recommend putting it under the broiler for a few minutes to get some color on it.

Used gluten free flour and butter. Took much longer to cook than 20 minutes but result was good. Not great, but good. Hope it freezes well as there's only two of us!!
