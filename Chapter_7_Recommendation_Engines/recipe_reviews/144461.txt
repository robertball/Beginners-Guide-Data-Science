This definately will be one of my favorite recipes for rolls, even though they came out more orange than rosy.  They were absolutely delicious.  Good flavor and very soft and tender.

Lovely pillows of goodness!  These do come out orange - not pink at all, it doesn't matter, they taste delicious.  I made 2 oz rolls and got 2 1/2 dozen rolls.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Foolproof recipe! seriously, i'd be surprised if anyone can't make these and not like them.I have used this recipe many times now and these babies ALWAYS come out soft and fluffy. You can sub the potatoes with sweet potatoes as mentioned by another reviewer. Did not notice any change in taste but I'll cut down the sugar due to sweetness from sweet potatoes.  I'll usually brush these babies with some butter to give them a little shine when they come out fresh from the oven. So so good! Mmmmmmmmmmm!!

I tried this and they turned out amazingly soft and delicious. Orange of course like everyone else mentioned. Will remain one of my favorite roll recipe.
