I read in prior reviews that the dough is sticky and complaints about not being able to roll the dough out. My complaint is that no where in the directions does it say that the dough NEEDS to be chilled. BUT it must be chilled (at least 2 hrs)in order to be able to roll and cut them out!   Secondly, use unsalted butter because this cookie is salty already from the Packaged ingredients.  It's not a very good tasting cookie as it's so, so salty with only a hint of sweetness.  I added an additional tablespoon of sugar to it but I don't think thats enough. Not a very good cookie.

I love this recipe. My Mom made it for me growing up. She clipped it out of the newspaper. It is a little salty, but pistachios are salty too. SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT TO DO: Use only 1/2 cup margarine (1 stick) or the dough will be far too sticky to roll out. My mom made this every St. Patrick's Day and m brother and sister and I all loved it. I don't know if the margarine thing is a typo or what. But 1/2 cup is what the original recipe calls for.

I tried these cookies and they were fab! I had to make myself stop tasting the dough. I iced them with the Sugar Cookie Icing on this website. The almond flavoring in the icing slightly masked the pistachio flavor of the cookies, but they were still very wonderful! I've already bought 4 boxes of pistachio pudding mix to be ready to make them again!

awful cookies, too sticky to roll, maybe they should be chilled first, but don't bother! We patted them into rounds to bake. Pudding adds no flavor, very little green color and baking mix made them way toooooo salty. waste of time!

I used margarine instead of butter, and I added an additional two tablespoons of sugar (for a total of three). The green wasn't as dark as I'd like, so I added about five or six drops of green food coloring. Great! I agree with previous reviewers who say these are a little salty, so it's a good thing that we like our salt! I think different pudding combos would be nice, too. Oh, and instead of trying to roll-and-cut them, I just dropped them by rounded teaspoons on greased sheets and flattened them to about ½" with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar. 11 minutes, done, good. Thanks for sharing this one!

This recipe is more like a sweet biscuit. Not very sweet. The cookies come out a lovely festive color, but the dough is very sticky and hard to handle.

I thought these were tasty, although my husband and kids said they were just o.k.  I also added chopped pistachios to the mix.  Thanks Mary Beth!

An interesting cookie, it started out sweet but the dough is very sticky and I ended up using too much flour in order to roll it out and it ended up tasting blah. Next time I may try using an extra pkg of pudding mixed with the flour for rolling.

Very good I did take others advice and I put in 2 tablespoons of white sugar. I didn't roll the dough I did put in the fridge for 10 mins and used a cookie scoop and dipped a glass in sugar to flaten the dough. I got 16 cookies when I did it this way out of the batch.

This cookie is easy to put together- few ingredients.  I didn't even bother rolling this out- i just used a mini ice cream scoop to drop the cookie out.  However:  Flavor was really lacking!!!  A bit on the salty side, not very sweet.  I attempted to improve the taste with the addition of a bit more sugar and almond extract.  Still not enough.  I would add a lot more sugar to make this more enjoyable.  Cool concept (with the pudding)- needs tweaking!

I like my cookies to be sweet and these were no where close to sweet. They were so salty that I couldn't even enjoy them. Even with frosting they still weren't "good" cookies.

Loved this recipe!  Not overly sweet.  When I made the baking mix using 2 1/4 cups flour, 1 T. bkaing powder, 3/4 tsp. salt, and 1/2 cup shortening, I had to use all of it to make a double batch of cookies firm enough to roll out. I prefer them without frosting or glaze. At a church social, these went fast!

If you can get the traditional sugar cookie idea out of your mind, these cookies are kind of fun.  The pistachio flavor is hardly noticeable.  The salt in the Bisquick is what catches your attention.  Like others, I added 2T of white sugar to the recipe.  I also used 10X to cover my rolling surface.  By the time I got to the end of my batch, I was rolling the dough into a ball, rolling it in 10X, then used my rolling pin.  Even after chilling for a few hours, the dough was stickier than most sugar cookies I've made.  All in all, it was another fun cookie to make with my kids.  The flavor is not great, but the color is festive, for sure.

I’m planning the St. Patrick’s Day party for my daughter’s class.  I can’t wait to make these..they will be a hit with the kids!  I found some cello candy bags from Box and Wrap that have shamrocks on the bags….so cute.  It’s the extra special touches that make the party great.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Tasty cookie, love the pistachio flavor, and that they are so easy to make.  Next time I would add another tablespoon or two of sugar and use unsalted butter, although maybe just the addition of a bit more sugar would balance the saltiness.  I rolled them out using a bit of baking mix instead of flour, and had no trouble at all!

These cookies are absolutely delicious and the first "rolled out" cookies I have made in years.  I had a shamrock cookie cutter and wanted to make cookies for my grandchildren and picked this recipe.  Didn't change a thing and I couldn't believe how easy the dough was to work with.  Thank you MBMCD for submitting a great recipe.

I followed the recipe, and the cookies were UNROLLABLE even after I chilled the dough for 2 hours (I got the tip for chilling from one of the other reviews which I decided to do b/c the dough was so STICKY).  When the cookies were ready to eat, the first thing out of mine and my husband's mouth was, BUTTER!!  They had no flavor other than the butter flavor :( VERY VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED...

I thought these were great and so did the friends and family I made them for. I did add 1 tablespoon of sugar as many recommended. Otherwise they came out great and were easy to make. Did anyone else frost them?? I frosted some and they were good and of course a bit sweeter.

Not too bad and very easy. As another reviewer stated, they are too salty on their own and definitely need frosting. With it they're not bad at all. I tried french vanilla flavor pudding; not as good as pistachio. Might try chocolate some time.

Added a couple extra tablespoons of sugar to the recipe and rolled the dough out on parchment paper for cutting into shapes. Topped with green sugar for added sweetness. Easy to make and look festive for St. Patrick's Day.

The dough, plus another 1+ tbs. of sugar, mixed up quickly but was too sticky for rolling. I worked in a little flour, a tbs. at a time, until I could pat it into an even layer about 3/8 inch thick. Then, I was able to cut it out and bake. I liked the buttery flavor with a light pistachio taste. Green sugar sprinkled on top made them sweet enough.

Cookies taste ok but don't try to roll these out.  I chilled and rolled with wax paper and still found it nearly impossible to cut out cookies.  Instead I formed the shamrocks by hand.  Much less frustrating and the same result.

These are really similar to a holiday favorite of my family.  We do 1 stick of butter, 1 pkg pudding, 1 egg, and 1 cup flour then add 1/2 bag -1 bag chocolate chips. Roll into balls and then put a halved maraschino cherry on top and bake for 8 or so minutes at 350. The chocolate chips and cherry make the cookie plenty sweet and they have great texture. Also for Easter I have replaced the cherry with a dot of pink frosting.

After reading the reviews, I made this recipe using unsalted butter and 3 T of sugar.  The cookies are a little salty, but not unpleasantly so.  I thought the pistachio flavor was just right.  I chilled the dough overnight, and the cookies rolled out nicely and baked well.  I took these cookies to a Girl Scout event on St. Patrick's Day and the scouts loved them.  The parents thought they were good, too.  They are not my favorite cookies, but they are good cookies, and they were perfect for the occasion.

These remind me of a lighter, softer variation of traditional spritz cookies with a little pistachio flavor.  After reading the reviews, I added an extra tablespoon of sugar to counter the salt in tha baking mix since I did not have time to glaze the cookies, as well as about a tablespoon of heavy cream to make it less dry.  They came out pretty well and were a nice combination of salty and sweet.  These are very fast and easy to make, but I agree that this is definitely not a cut-out cookie recipe.  I would make it again, and definitely bake them until they are browned on the edges (leave them in a minute or two longer if baking on an air-bake sheet).

Made these the other day and there is no way you can roll out this dough and use a cookie cutter!!  To save the day I rolled the dough into balls and baked them that way and they came out great. I love anything pistachio so I'll keep the recipe but maybe next time put a little frosting on them. But they're great without it.

Excellent recipe.  Easy to roll out, not sticky.
Not too sweet, tastes like a butter cookie.  Kids and older people loved them (and everyone inbetween.)
