Perfect I didn't change anything followed as written though I used fresh strawberries since I had plenty left over from another recipe.

This was super easy to make and it tasted great without making the cake too sweet!  I am going to try adding more strawberries next time I make it.

Easy Peezy, and tastes great. Like many others on this site, I only used 3/4 of a cup of water. Thickened up nicely. Easily fills an eight inch cake. For those of you that use scales; a cup of strawberries is about 5.5 oz,or 152 grams. What I've found works for me. If you are filling a cake, I lay down a very thin, almost transparent layer of buttercream before I add the strawberries. This keeps them from soaking through the layers. Also used a  to prevent them from squishing (that's a technical term lol) out when the next layer is added.

This filling accompanied my dark chocolate cake I(from this site) very nicely. thanks Lisa!
***NOTE*** I made a very delicious mango filling using the exact same recipe, just switching equal amount of mangoes for the strawberries, and decreasing sugar to 1/2 cup. mmm!

This was wonderful.  Still warm from the stove it would make an amazing topper for waffles.  I was worried that it wouldn't get thick enough for a cake filling, so I put it in the refrigerator overnight.  The next morning I checked and it had set up perfectly.  I received many compliments on this in my cake.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

This was one of the easiest, most fulfilling recipes I've ever tried. I followed the recipe to a T, chilled the filling for several hours before using, and used it with a great cream cheese frosting, which paired really well with the strawberry flavor. I loved the taste of the filling - slightly tart, but still sweet, and extremely flavorful. I'll be using this again, no doubt.

this is a great recipe! I was crunched for time and after reading reviews that say it has to sit in the fridge, i did alter it a bit. I only added 1/2 a cup of water, and 3/4 cup of sugar. I didn't use any cornstarch, but i added 1 cup of fresh strawberries and 1/2 strained strawberry puree. I also zested and juiced an orange and a teaspoon of lemon juice. After cooking it for 25 mins I put the pot in an ice water bath for 10 minutes and it was perfect!

Awesome recipe! 

I bake, and this is my go-to recipe for any fruit filing that I do. I have used the same recipe with fresh or frozen strawberries. Also works great canned pineapple and peaches, and fresh raspberries! I think you could use whatever fruit you want to use!

Depending on the cake I am baking, I may add a little lime or lemon juice, just to break up the sugar a little, and if you use canned fruit like peaches or pineapple, use the juice or light syrup from the can instead of water, and adjust the amount of sugar used accordingly.

Great Recipe!

This definitely needs to sit in the fridge over night.  I made it and a few hours later when I went to put on the cake it went everywhere.  :(  Tasty but messy.

Perfect! Easy and fast! I used fresh strawberries as that was what I had in the house.  I made it a day ahead of the cake and it set up great. Only thing I might change in cutting the strawberries a little larger next time. Will be making this again.

Even after cooking 20 min it was too runny and ended up making a mess of the cake.  Need to add more thickener, cook longer, or get freezing cold, I don't know.  It did taste good, but the cake looked sad.

Very easy and fast to prepare. It saved me a trip to the store.  I only needed enough to fill an 8" round cake, so I made half the recipe (plus that was all the strawberries I had).   The filling is a little too runny to fill the cake without a dam of icing, but it still held up well enough. Was wonderful with chocolate cake.

This was an amazing filling! The only mistake I made was slicing my fresh strawberries really thin. Next time I will just cut them in chunks. I paired this with strawberry cake and it was soooo good! My go to filling from this point on.

Loved this, used it as a King Cake filler since we are a lactose intolerant household and can't do the usual cream cheese mixes. I made it with fresh strawberries chunked up. After cooking I did put it into a blender for 2 or 3 pulses to break up the chunks of strawberries for the consistency I wanted inside the cake. It sat in the fridge overnight and came together nicely and was plenty thick enough for the cake the next morning. I added a few drops of red food coloring to get it to pop a little more, and I wanted that contrast with the white dough of the king cake. Cake out wonderful and it was the first time I had ever made a fruit filling. Will definitely be using this again for another King Cake this week.

Fantastic recipe!  I had frozen some strawberries over the summer, which I normally use for smoothies.  I cut some up to use as the filling on a cake, but they were a little too mushy when they thawed.  So I found this recipe and it is perfect.  The only change I made was that I added a teaspoon of almond extract.  I'm making a white cake with almond flavoring and thought this combination would be perfect.  I wasn't wrong.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I'm surprised to even find a bad review on this.  I made this today and it was amazing! I following the recipe 100%.  After it cooled down, I put in the fridge for about an hour before I put it on the cake.  I probably could have applied it directly to the cake without refrigerating first because this consistently was great.  It thickened up perfectly after 10 mins of being stirred in the saucepan as per the recipe.  After reading the reviews, I knew that the refrigeration was highly recommended so I did it and it made it even better.  This recipe is so good! My picky husband and kids loved it and I will definitely make this again!

Thank you Lisa for an incredibly delicious filling.  We had fresh strawberries on hand, so we used those instead of frozen.

Tastes great but it never did set up. I wouldn't be able to use this in a cake. It's going to end up being a sauce now. I would use only half to 1/4 the amount of water listed here if using previously frozen fruit. I'd try it her way with fresh fruit but the recipe specifically cites frozen, thawed fruit so it ought to work that way. Since it didn't, I really can't give it more than 3 stars. Tasted nice and clean though, I liked not having the vanilla flavor in it.

Best strawberry filling recipe I have found and the only one I use now.  Delicious and very easy to make.  Does take a bit more than 10 minutes, but once you see it thicken and start to bubble you know it is done.  Just made a batch this morning for my mothers birthday cake, everyone always loves this filling when I make it.  My kids even use the left over for waffles and pancakes, I always have to make more than I need for the cake so they have it.

This is kind of gross on its own, gelatinous goo. But in between cake layers it's amazing.

I have several clients that are allergic to food dyes used in commercial fillings, so this recipe is perfect for a natural tasting filling! I have used this with peaches, mangos, raspberries, just adding a tich of lemon juice to retain color, and adding more fruit or puree depending on what I'm using it for. great flavor.I always use fresh fruit instead of frozen to avoid that mushy commercial texture.

I just made this a few moments ago. It's coolimg off right now. I did make some adjustments to the procedure. The measurements and ingredients I left as is. The only thing I added extra was a banana. So now it turned into a strawberry banana filling for the middle layer of a cake I made. I do like this recipe and will be using it often with different fruits :) It seems like it will be good on top of waffles or pancakes too :) .... and it smells DELICIOUS. Thank you for the  recipe

I have made this strawberry filling a few times and it is one of my favorite, not only because it is easy but it is delicious I made it to go with a white cake from here, whipped frosting also from here and it was the perfect combination.

I made this but only used 1/2 cup of water. It worked very well for me. I thought it was perfectly thick and sweet. I used it for cheesecake topping.

Used the same recipe for frozen blueberries instead, and since I didn't have any cornstarch, I added a little more all purpose flour instead (4.5 tbsp). The texture and sweetness were just perfect! I added a tiny amount of lime juice too for kicks :)

This recipe was super easy and turned out great! It smells much more flavorful than it is, though. I ended up adding a splash of lime juice as suggested by a couple of others to make it a bit sharper flavor as it will be filling a sweet cake. Delicious!!

I just quartered the berries and they cooked down some. You can actually taste strawberry in there but not overpoweringly so. Sometimes berry cake fillings near my local bakeries are not very memorable or even that distinguishable.

I used fresh strawberries, because they were cheap at the time. This was exactly what I was looking for, but it made more than I could use. I made a 2-layer vanilla sponge cake, filled it with this, and iced with chocolate buttercream frosting. It was awesome.

Made this today for a 3 layer cake (red velvet, strawberry and white) I used 4 cups strawberries, 1 cup water, 1 cup sugar and 4 tbls. cornstarch as I'm making two cakes at one time.  It's amazing, not to sweet but nice and thick to put between the layers. I brought this to a boil and then simmered for almost 20 minutes for the consistency to be correct. I'll be using this for other cake fillings with different fruit.

The only thing I was sad about is the lack of color. However, that was from the strawberries I had. I love lemon with my strawberries and so I used some lemon zest and a dash of salt to bring out the flavors more. It was and is delicious. I'll be using this on the top of my cheesecake tonight.

I cut the water to 3/4 cups as others suggested, but the filling was still too runny. I was planning on using this for a cupcake filling, but I don’t think this recipe will works for the consistency I’m looking for.

This recipe calls for far too much liquid. Perhaps it would be an okay amount with fresh fruit, but with frozen it becomes a lovely syrup or, generously, a pie filling. As is this fails as a cake filling without modification. I ended up adding additional fruit and cooking it for far longer to let it reduce.

Meh...my first batch came out super runny so second batch I added 3 more tablespoons of cornstarch and got it to thicken up immensly. Doing a 10in round wedding cake so I needed for a filling not a topper, too runny and cake will get mushy and slide around, so 3 tablespoons extra will give you a very jelly like consistency , if you trying to use as a topping, just add 1 more tablespoon until your desired consistency.

Years ago I used to buy my strawberry filling in this plastic tube at my local grocer. They went out of business and I’ve been determined to find a preservative free replacement that I could make myself. I made this and because I read the reviews I was really worried it would be too runny and not set up properly. It was for an important event so I couldn’t risk it so I did about 1/4 cup less water. Honestly, I didn’t have to reduce the water. It set up really nicely. Great flavor and consistency and looked great. For the bad reviews I can only surmise they did not follow the recipe properly. You have to cook for at least 10 minutes and you have to let it cool. If you do this you will have a fantastic filling. No sad cake. Your cake will look and taste fabulous.

This was a great recipe and the only change I made was to decrease sugar and water just a bit because my fresh strawberries were already very sweet.  Very easy recipe and it thickened right away to a perfect consistency.   Those that commented it was too runny must have put 3 teaspoons of constarch instead of 3 Tablespoons.  It became very thick as soon as it started to boil.
 I did add food coloring for the bright red look.  Thank you for the perfect recipe that could work with many different berries for different desserts!

I made it with 3/4 water, and 3 tbsp cornstarch for cupcake filling. Literally perfect piping texture.

Easy to make and excellent for using between cake layers, or on top of ice cream. I added 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice for a bit of a bright note.

Not sure if it was just too watery (it was pretty thick!) or if it was just too much for the 9" cakes I made, but it turned out to be a real mess! My cake also looked sad, but hopefully it'll taste delicious!

For those who read comments before making things (like I don't), try either halving this recipe or just putting half in your cake and see what happens! It can't turn out too bad if there's not an overflow of filling, right?

Came out perfect! I cooked it for 20 minutes instead of 10 and the consistency was amazing, however was a bit sweet for my taste.  Next time I will only use 1/2 cup of sugar

I made this recipe for the first time to use as a filling in chocolate cupcakes. It was simple to make and came out fantastic. I'm not sure what people mean by it not thickening up enough, those people must not use cornstarch very often. After 10 min on medium heat, it thickened up into a gel-like consistency. I will definitely use this recipe again!

This came out great! I made it with only one small change - used fresh strawberries instead of frozen. It was delicious! Used it as cake filling and everyone loved it.

Very simple and tasty!  Followed the recipe and it turned out perfect.  Used it as a filling for a white cake and will be using the leftover for a topping for some vanilla ice cream later.

Perfect time I make it.  This time I only had 2 tble of corn starch so I added 1 tsp. tapioca.  Came out perfect and taste great.  Tip:  I make glaze and let it thicken.  I let it cool off some and then add the berries.  Keeps the berries looking beautiful and the taste is great

Yummy, easy and fairly quick! I used good, fresh, ripe strawberries that I sliced using an egg slicer. I did goof with the corn starch and had to add what I forgot latter, but no problem! delicious and will use this for a variety of things, (would be great on Waffles or pancakes, and on the "Moo-less Chocolate Pie" from Alton Brown.) It was fabulous on the Dark Chocolate German Chocolate cake on this site!

Quick and easy and tasted great. I did use fresh berries as that was what I had on hand and gave it a squirt of lemon juice. This is a keeper. Thanks.

This recipe was just okay. The flavor was there, but the consistency was that of a soup. I tried thickening it up with more cornstarch and was going to attempt to use gelatin when I decided not to bother. I refrigerated it overnight in hopes that would work, to no avail. All in all, flavor was great [i added the juice of one lemon approx 1/4 cup], but more for a dessert topping rather than a cake filling.

I would have given it 5 stars however it never did thicken up.  The flavor was amazing .... I just wish I could have used it as a filling and not as a topping.  

I am a beginner cook/baker and this recipe has only 4 steps.  I'm still not sure what I could have done wrong!

This is the BEST strawberry filling I have ever made.  I made it as written but used fresh strawberries. Note: I tripled the recipe for future cakes but I was terrible disappointed. It didn't defrost well.  The texture was mushy. My suggestion would be make the amount you need and enjoy the wonderful filling.
I'm getting ready to make it with frozen strawberries and hope I am as happy as I was with fresh

Love this! It's not overpowering and tastes so great! I halved the recipe the first time for a taste cake and it was perfect! Did the whole batch the second time around and it came out perfect again! The only thing I changed was that I turned the heat to medium high for 10 minutes. Very good!

I used this filling to top off cream cheese filled prebaked tart shells. Reduced the water in this recipe to 3/4 cup, used frozen, whole local strawberries, and kept the rest of the recipe the same.  The result was the perfect quick dessert!

Delicious! Added the juice of 1/3 lime and used fresh strawberries instead of frozen and crushed the berries with a potato masher type thing while cooking which made it absolutely perfect. Also made with mixed frozen berries one time and also turned out great:) If you add another tablespoon of corn starch, you can make homemade jam/jelly :)

My only change was to use fresh strawberries
 Otherwise, I followed exactly and this filling is scrumptious! I used it as filling on achieve chocolate cake,  but it would be great on a cheesecake, waffles, pancakes, or mixed it to with yogurt. So yummy!

I've made this multiple times now. It makes a great cake/cupcake filling. I paired it with vanilla cupcakes with whipped cream or cream cheese frosting. Yummy! :)

This was a very simple recipe that tasted great.  I used 4 cups of fresh strawberries and 3/4 cup of water.  It thickened up very nicely.  This is perfect for a cake and tastes way better than that strawberry goop you buy at the store.

Delicious with a white cake! Had to add more cornstarch to get it thicker. Highly recommend!

This recipe was delicious! I followed all of the directions exactly, except I added 4 cups of fresh mixed berries. My three year old daughter is going to love the cake I make with this filling for her birthday.

This was amazing! I changed nothing about this. I cooled in the fridge for a while then put it in my sons birthday cake. We even used the leftovers and made strawberry short cake for dessert a couple days later. It was perfect and I will be making it again!

A truly magnificent cake-filling! I made this for a client and they just called to tell me how absolutely delicious the cake filling is.  I was a bit nervous when they asked for this type of filling, since I had never made it before, but it came out perfect and it was super easy to make.  This recipe is a definite keeper! Thanks!

This recipe thickened up nicely, and it definitely is good to use when you have no filling for a cake on hand. However, even though I only used 1/2 C of sugar, it was still a little too sweet. If you are sensitive to sugary foods, maybe use a bit  less sugar at first and flavor more later, or use agave to sweeten it up.
