did not make it , did not have to. if you want little round rubber balls cook it this way. a waste of good shrimp. shrimp should NEVER be boiled. if you want plump tender shrimp, try this method. it never fails no matter the size or amount. in a large stock pot add 2 quarts of liquid, i use water, for every pound of shrimp. add a tbls. of salt for every 2 quarts of water.add 4or5 bay leaves. bring to a rapid boil and take it off the heat. put lid on pot and wait 2 mins. the water should be about 190 degree's now. dump in the shrimp, stir a bit, put lid on pot. exactly 3 mins later drain in colinder and immediatly plunge into ice water stirring until the shrimp are cold. spin in a salad drier or pat dry with paper towels. i like my shrimp cocktail shrimp really cold so i cover and put in the fridge but they can be served right away. try this method and you won't cook them any other way again.   David.

I didn't have the crab boil, so I had to substitute spices I had on hand. I used a blend of minced onion/garlic and some dried parsley and dill. I also didn't want to overcook, so as soon as the shrimp started to boil and turn pink (I used shell on shrimp) I pulled them off the heat, and drained immediately. I then put them in the freezer to cool down to serve as a cold appetizer with some home made cocktail sauce (organic ketchup and horseradish mix).

This was well received at my house.  The only thing I did differently was to remove the pot from the heat as soon as it came to a boil after adding the shrimp.  I didn't want to over cook the shrimp.  I left them in the hot beer for about 5 minutes.  Thanks for sharing!

Honestly, Florida native with LOTS of shrimp experience.  No matter WHAT you cook them in, bring liquid to a boil, turn off heat, and let shrimp sit in hot liquid about 5 or so minutes.  Otherwise you get rubber....

We call this peel 'em and eat 'em. I use Old Bay, peppercorns and bay leaf. Bring beer and spices to boil, throw shrimp in, bring to boil, turn off. Let sit for 5 minutes. I prefer them warm with homemade cocktail sauce (ketchup, lemon, horseradish). For fun, cover the table with newspaper and thrown the peels on that! (I also serve green salad and good La Brea bread.)

Bring the liquid to a boil,  add the shrimp, and as soon as it starts to boil again, take it off the heat and drain the liquid off.  
NEVER let the shrimp stay in the boiling liquid any longer.  
This way you will have the true texture and flavour of the shrimp.  Bon appetite !

Simple, easy and delicious.  At the recommendation of another reviewer, we also added 1 teaspoon of vinegar. The shrimp peeled very easily and tasted yummy!  Will definitely use this recipe again.

A favorite dish of mine since college days, generations ago. I make mine with a small scoop of pickling spices as well. We call them "peel and eat" shrimp at my table, served up with some spicy cocktail sauce enhanced with added horseradish.

Easy and DELICIOUS! When I lived in Seattle and purchased fresh sea food downtown at the market, this is exactly the way they recommended fresh shrimp be prepared.

I used Old Bay seasoning because that's what I had on hand. It's the best shrimp I ever made. Tastes good hot or cold.

Great base recipe!  I turned it into a shrimp boil by adding red potatoes , corn on the cob and beef smoked sausage so it made a delicious soup. Just be sure to taste it after adding everything else to see if you need to add more seasoning. Oh, and I used chicken broth in place of water like I do with most all things. We ate every single drop of it!!  Will definitely make again and again!

You didn’t specify that you need to get local shrimp. Texas has local shrimp. Most shrimp you buy frozen from the grocery store is from Malaysia.

I love shrimp.  Made a half order, only 2 of us.  Great taste but followed directions and way over cooked.  Well make again but less cooking time.
