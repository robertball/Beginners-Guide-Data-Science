Tasty Stuff!

Couple thoughts:
The "bunch" of cilantro seemed a bit arbitrary. I ended up with right around 2/3 cup of chopped cilantro.
I removed the seeds and center of the tomato and jalapeno (Roma tomato worked nicely for this)

I made this just like the recipe said. Glad I tasted it before serving to guests. It was very very bland! I added 2 tbsp of salt 2 tbsp of both onion powder and garlic powder. And a couple dashes of pepper. Not impressed with this one even after it being doctored up.

I went with the recipe except I used dried cilantro (3 Tbs). It was great!  It was the first app to go at the party!

I used this dip as a filler for 6 10" tortillas.  I used full fat cream cheese and made sure to remove the juice from the tomato.  My cilantro amount was probably around a cup.  After rolling them up, I cut them into pinwheels and they were a huge hit.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe with them as well.  These were great for a quick appetizer.  One person even took a picture because they were so pretty.  Great recipe!

Delicious dip. Knowing that cilantro comes in different size bunches I measured 1 cup minced. Perfect balance of flavors. This will be made often here. Thank you hawkika3.
