This was excellent and the mushrooms were the star indeed. If I've ever had oyster mushrooms I don't recall it. I fell in love. I could have eaten them straight out of the oven as a side dish. I will be using this method and making these mushrooms often. The rest of the salad was good too. A little work but worth it. I used a homemade Italian dressing instead of the olive oil. To be honest I think plain oil would have been on the bland side. It needs herbs but that is just my opinion. If I were to just use olive oil, I'd use extra virgin. Regardless, this is an excellent salad and a beautiful one at that. Thanks for the great recipe!
