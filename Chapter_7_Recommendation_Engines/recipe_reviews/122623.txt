Fantastic recipe!  I tried several others from this site, and none of them worked as written for me.  This one, however, worked beautifully; I followed the recipe with no changes and they were perfect.  Next time I had to double the recipe, and they still were a tremendous hit - even though, since I was doubling it, I couldn't fill 1/2 of the tins with water.  Great recipe, thanks so much for sharing!!

These were the tallest, most beautiful popovers I've ever made! Followed recipe exactly as written, however I used a popover pan instead of muffin tin. It made 5 popovers in my pan, did not need any adjustment in baking time or ingredients. I used butter to grease the wells, and flour - they slid out perfectly with no effort at all. And OOOO were they delicious!

add a small amount of clarified butter in the tin before adding the batter, this will ensure your popover comming out with not problems

This is just like Yorkshire Pudding to me...instead of greasing the muffin pan, my mom used to use a touch of oil, bacon grease, or the fat from the roast beef she had just prepared and then heat up the pan in the oven, take it out, add the batter and bake again, delicious British bread to accompany Lamb or Beef roast

Question. These are the exact popovers my mother used to make. She passed away and I now have many of her recipes. I tried making these several times, ago and they stick horribly to my muffin pan. Any suggestions?

I went into this recipe blind...I didn't even know what a popover was!  My family simply loves bread so I thought I'd give it a try.  The recipe was very easy.  I doubled the recipe and only added 5 eggs instead of 6 but they seemed to come out just fine.  Like I said, not knowing how a popover is supposed to taste, we found them good but a bit bland.  I got one vote of love 'em (my 9 year old), one I could go either way (13 year old...typical response) and a no go from my hubby.  To me, bread is bread...

This is an excellent base recipe Debbie! To those complaining about blandness, it's up to you to add whatever spice compliments whatever you are using them for/serving them with:
-if for fruit or to serve with jam or honey, add 1/4 tsp. nutmeg & cinnamon...try adding 1/2 tsp. vanilla to batter prior to baking.  Pinch of dried lemon or orange peel perhaps?
-if for chicken or pork add 1/4 tsp. rubbed sage or ground rosemary & 1/4garlic powder. ( I use 1/2 tsp. but we LOVE garlic).
-roast beef with gravy, add 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, sub 1/2 tsp. powdered beef bullion mix for the salt, a generous shake of coarse ground fresh pepper & a couple dashes Worcestershire or Tabasco if you want a bit of a punch.   I always use Canola oil to grease the inside of the muffin tins and melt an additional dab (about 1/2 tsp.) of butter in each cup in the oven before pouring the batter in.  A preheated pan will increase the loft of the popovers.  By using the oil rub first it will lessen the chances of the butter burning if you happen to leave it a minute too long.  Make sure you pierce the sides with the point of a sharp knife as soon as possible upon removing them from the oven to minimize falling.

Well guess I don't know much about popovers...but I tried them.  First of all they popped up nicely and smelled yummy BUT when "done" they wouldn't come out of my well greased and floured crown muffin pan.  So I pinched off a piece just to taste them and they have absolutely NO flavor at all!  Are they supposed to taste like flour?  Won't waste anymore eggs on this.

I use a popover pan and these come out perfect every time. The Kitchen is "owned" my wife unless she want me to make these popovers which we both love.

I have tried so many popover recipes...this is the only one I have ever had success with.  It's wonderful.  We have them every Sunday with a Roasted Chicken Dinner.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

Delicious!  I made this recipe in one 12 muffin pan rather than 2 pans.  Melted a few tablespoons of butter and then very generously buttered each muffin cup. I did not flour the pan.  Added the batter and baked as directed.  The popovers came right out of the pan without any sticking at all.   My daughter, boyfriend and I all loved it.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

wow,really easy and good.
the only thing I have to add is don't cook the other 15 mins. I took mine out after 15 mins of 450 and let them sit to cool and they were cooked through

This was a great popover that doesn't add butter to the batter.  I used an actual popover pan and cut the recipe to 1/3 since I was the only one eating them and I got two popovers instead of three smaller ones that would have resulted from a muffin pan.  If you would use a popover pan with the normal amount it would most likely yield 6 popovers.  They were yummy and I can't wait to make them for my hubby and add some flavorings to them...maybe some bay seasoning, dill or grated parmesan.

They did not rise for me, but I live at an elevation of 6,500 feet, and there were no high elevation directions. I have made popovers at a much lower altitude with my mom and this recipe was similar. I would give it a 1 star rating except Im pretty sure the fact that they didn't rise on my altitude.

Excellant!  Easy, fluffy, tasty.  My husband and I loved these.
