I made this ahead of time for my husband to rewarm for Daddy Dinner Night. Instead of ground beef, I used ground turkey. I omitted the seasoning salt but added onion powder, garlic powder, ground cumin, mexican oregano and a little chopped fresh cilantro (for a mexican themed flavor, to go with the chili powder). I made mini corn muffins to go with. I did not get to try this myself--they ate the whole casserole dish full. Definitely a remake. Very cheap to make for those on a budget like me.

I couldn't find my Aunt's recipe for goulash, and I was craving it! This one comes pretty close to hers...maybe even better! Yeah! It's such a comforting dish, and also quick, cheap and easy! I doubled the recipe so we would have leftovers for lunch tomorrow...glad I did that, it's really good! I made slight substitutions and one addition, this is a great base recipe and easy to modify to your tastes or whatever you have on hand. Instead of the ketchup(which I was out of), I used a can of diced tomatoes with onion and garlic(so I left out the chopped onion) and I used a package of frozen mixed vegetables instead of the corn(which I was also out of). I usually just add corn to goulash, but the mixed veggies were a hit! I also added some steak sauce while the ground beef was cooking since I always add it to any ground beef recipe, it really gives beef a lot of flavor.  I served the cheese at the table instead of melting it on top, so people could add as much or as little as they want. It melts when you stir it in. A dollop of sour cream on top would be good too...but I was out of that too! Geez, I need to go grocery shopping, I'm out of everything! lol Thanks so much for the recipe, it's definitely a keeper!

This reminded me of a homemade version of Hamburger Helper. It was good and super easy to make. I donâ€™t think it needs the sugar though because it truly gave it a bit of a sweet taste.

I added some sour cream and a little more cheese. It was amazing! 10/10 would make again.

Delicious.  I  added a few other things,  just because.  I added a little BBQ sauce,  Penzy's chili 3000 spices, garlic powder, a little oregano and black pepper.  I didn't have tomato sauce but did have  a 13 oz container of marinara so used that in place of tomato sauce.......Okay, so it sounds like I completely doctored up, but I did follow the recipe with all of the other spices...... Really good though and I had most of the ingredients on hand.

This was very good. I did double the spice, added cracked pepper and doubled the cheese. My 11 year-old son loved it. I thought it was a bit bland but enjoyable. Very much a comfort food. Thank you for the recipe! I will make it again.

I chose this recipe because I needed to use up 1/2 onion, corn, cheddar and tomato sauce that were left over from another recipe that I'd just made. I didn't measure any of those ingredients, I just used what I had. I did measure the rest, though. My family enjoyed it and I'll make it again.

Made this for dinner tonight, I added a can of diced tomatoes. Was very good, I'll be making it again (next time I won't forget the corn). I used ground turkey instead of beef.  This would be good made with ground bison also.

Ed's Macaroni Jumble Haiku: "Husband hated it. Daughter said it was the best. I'm just in between." Followed Ed's recipe as written only putting it in a casserole dish in the morning, then topping it w/ cheese in the oven at 350 for 40 min. when I got home from work; much easier that way. It tasted like a fancier Hamburger Helper, which isn't a bad thing, but my husband thought it was just awful and wouldn't eat beyond one bite. There were so many leftovers that I decided to experiment w/ freezing it (b/c my daughter loved it so much and I didn't want to feed it to her exclusively for several days following) and Blammo! It actually translated well 2 weeks later straight from the freezer to the oven. So will I make it again just for her? Chances are no, but I'm glad that I tried it!
