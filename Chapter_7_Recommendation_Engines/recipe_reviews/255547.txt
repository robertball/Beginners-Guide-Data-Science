This was yummy! I followed the recipe's suggestions for ingredients, but saved some time by cooking the spaghetti squash in the microwave and then roasting with the onions. I made this as a Thanksgiving side dish and it was a hit!

I had a truly giant spaghetti squash so I doubled everything but the onion. I didn’t bother to peel and cube the squash. I quarter it and roasted it with the skin on the scooped the squash out. And I used unseasoned gluten free bread crumbs because that’s what I had. Really tasty casserole that hit the spot.

I have struggled to enjoy squashes of all varieties, but often the texture gets me.  Spaghetti squash is a bit different due to the strands of the squash.  I am sure that the squash lover would enjoy the rich flavors, and they were quite good, but for me, the dish was too 'gloppy'.  It got tepid reviews from the family.  It looked beautiful but the texture turned me off.

01.04.17 ~ I had a spaghetti squash staring me in the face, every day, for over a month. It was time I tackle it and make something with it. This was a really good recipe to use. I changed my preparation method, but the end results were delicious. I hate peeling the hard squash. I poked holes in the whole squash and put it in the microwave. Once it was cooked, I cut it in half and scooped out the flesh. While that was cooking I sauteed the onion on the stove top. Once I combined the squash and onions I proceeded with the dish. I didn't have goat cheese, but I did have cream cheese. The casserole baked up nicely and cut in squares and served up beautifully. This was served with 'Sheila's Grilled Pork Tenderloin' from AR.
