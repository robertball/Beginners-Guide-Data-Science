I used peanut oil and tossed half w/sesame oil, half w/ oyster sauce. Delicious !  Like you (should) get in a restaurant.

This recipe was very good and easy to make. Additionally, it's super easy to convert to dietary restrictions. I used garlic infused olive oil and GF Tamari low-sodium soy sauce. I omitted the salt as I didn't want the dish to be too salty. To make it easier, I just whisked the soy sauce, chicken broth (per author's suggestion), sugar, black pepper, and a little ground ginger too. Then, just add in the sauce mixture in step 2. There was too much excess sauce, but I liked being able to use some of the sauce over cooked white rice. Thanks for the recipe!

My whole family wanted seconds! Delicious. No changes to recipe needed. I could’ve eaten the whole bowl. I served it with pan fried cubed tofu and sushi rice for a fantastic vegan meal!

I just made this dish because I love Bok Choy.  The recipe was easy but I didn't quite understand the sugar part.  Anyway, I like a deeper infusion of Sesame so I added a little to the Grapeseed oil for sautéing and then did the drizzle at the end.  Beef broth instead of water adhered the flavors better for me.  My Bok Choy was tender yet crispy.  I intended to have it with some Brown Rice but ended up eating it all by itself.  As a Vegetarian it makes a wonderful main dish or an exotic side.
