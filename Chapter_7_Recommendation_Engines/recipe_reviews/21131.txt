Very tasty and not overly sweet.  I used thawed and drained blueberries.  Texture very good.  Moist but not mushy.  I cooled them upside down in case they would be prone to breaking but the cornmeal held its shape without crumbling.  Still good the next day. I can see why they are Melissa's favorite. I will definitely make this recipe often!

These are the best corn muffins I have ever made!!! I substituted the white sugar for splenda, added an extra egg, and soaked the cornmeal in the buttermilk as I prepared the other ingredients. (Alternate incorporating the egg mixture and buttermilk mixture into the dry ingredients). Don't bake them for more than 20 mins... They turned out very tender and not too sweet!!! Thanks! :)

I don't out a lot of stars often. But I totally enjoyed these.  I used frozen blueberries and coated them in a liitle flour so they wouldn't sink.   Kids thought they were 9out of 10 stars.  Very moist and flavorfull

These muffins are great.  I've made a couple of different blueberry corn muffin recipes, and this was just what I wanted.  The corn flavor isn't overpowering, and the amount of blueberries called for is perfect.  Also, the vanilla adds the depth of flavor that I was looking for in these muffins, and they're very moist.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very very good.  We loved how different they were with the blueberries.  My hubby actually requested these again this morning before he left for work.  I don't have blueberries on hand but I do have raspberries and am thinking about trying it with those.

Initial reaction from the kids (before eating) was something like, "do I have to eat them?".  They all disappeared very quickly though.  I used buttermilk powder (worked great) and dehydrated blueberries (not as great)

I've made these for all sorts of events - everyone likes them and they're easy to make. I substituted buttermilk for 1/2 cup melted butter and 1/2 cup milk, and they were absolutely delish!

This recipe was really good!  We have to eat gluten free so I did have to modify it for our needs.  Instead of all-purpose flour, I used 1/4 Cup buckwheat flour, 1/4 Cup sweet white sorghum flour and 3/4 Cup brown rice flour.  Plus, I had more blueberries on hand, so I added an extra 1/2 Cup over what the recipe called for.  These were perfect for us!

An easy recipe to do with children.  Good, but a little dry. Best warm with lots of butter or jam.

Followed the recipe to the letter but used frozen blueberries as I always have them available.  Used the paper muffin cups which I would not recommend as some blueberries stuck to them just a bit.  Not too sweet and very enjoyable!  Always wise to use the best Madagascar vanilla too!

These made a nice and healthy snack for the kids that they really enjoyed.  I found them a bit plain so I added some cinnamin and nutmeg to spice it up a bit.

These were good but just a bit on the bland side.  Maybe a little bit of cinnamon would have done the trick?

I was indecisive if I wanted blueberry muffins or corn muffins, so I found this little recipe.  They came out perfect, not too sweet.

Will definitely make again. I only docked a star because the cook time is way too long. I did a 15min timer and they were on the verge of burning. Still turned out edible but dry. 
*Just did a second batch at 10min and they're cooked through.*

I did make alterations:
 
I'm loving the texture of the corn meal-the ratio of flour to corn is spot on. 
I defrosted some mixed berries, added an extra half cup, and will definitely add more in the future. 
I made buttermilk using the juice of a small lemon and a cup of cashew milk that I let sit for 15min. I also added about 3-4tbs of sour cream that I had hoping to make them more moist.
I used light brown sugar instead of white sugar and used about 3/4 cup. 
I also used 1/4 cup of melted butter instead of oil for a buttery flavor which came through nicely without being too greasy.

The muffins were delicious. I did add one extra egg. They also bake much better either in tin liners or right in the muffin pan, I sprayed with Pam.

I made these gluten free and they turned out awesome.  Used gluten free flour blend and 1 teaspoon xanthum gum, everything else was same.  Very spongy and a nice taste.
