This turned out really good. I tried to make as written but I only have a hand grater and I couldn't get that apple to grate for nothing. The little bit I could get to grate just turned into watery mush so I gave up and cut it into matchsticks instead. I made two different slaw's for taco's last night. Hubs liked the creamier one better but I preferred this one. I used both white and red cabbage to give it more color. I really liked the texture the jicama added. This is a great slaw for tacos!
