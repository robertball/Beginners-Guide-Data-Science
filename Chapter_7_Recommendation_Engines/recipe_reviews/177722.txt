Instead of using rice, I used peeled, chunked potatoes and reduced the broth to only about 1 cup.  I also added two diced tomatoes.  With hot Italian bread, it was delicious!

We loved this!  Yummy comfort food. :) I didn't have any peppers, so I used frozen broccoli. I cooked the rice with the broth in my rice cooker/streamer and then added the cooked rice to the pan. This recipe is a keeper.

A good weekday dinner, once you have the vegetables ready to go.  I had kielbasa, so I used that and switched the thyme out for paprika.  That was awfully tasty, too.

This was a big hit with my husband, who loves one pan casseroles. I only had banana peppers on hand, so I chopped about 1/4 cup of those, and my sausage was sweet italian, and combined well with the rice. Nice and moist!

YUM! Great texture and flavor. Needed more cooking time than the recipe calls for to get the rice finished, but otherwise....very tasty.

Nice mix on the types of rice and surprisingly they cooked well in the broth.

Just made this for my boyfriend and his family. his grandmother ate 2 servings, and she hardly ever completely cleans her plate.  I added a couple spices here and there, but thats something that I have to do cause I'm just a little fidgety.  We'd definitely make it again.  We also used beef broth cause thats what was on hand, but i think it'd be good with any broth

This was good, but the rice/pepper mixture was a bit bland.  Next time I make this I will use hot Italian sausage and add in some paprika.

The first disastrous meal I've made in many years, in fact I don't remember having to throw something away as inedible  . I thought I could sneak a little rice into my husbands supper by cutting back on the amount of rice and adjusting the broth.  he has never liked rice since college days.  The rice wasn't softening up so I added more broth and went to play Wii with hubby....I beat him handily at bowling....and the supper burnt!  Must be the starch on the bottom, it was a black layer and I never smelled a thing.  We tasted it and it was very salty from the extra broth i guess....just a total trainwreck.  But he was very happy that he didn't have to eat it...he had popcorn, I had left overs.  LOL    My family and friends on facebook said that winning is everything anyway.

I'm not sure it is worth a four and one half star.  It was nice, warm comfort food for a week night.  Not great, not bad.  Got out of it    what you put into it, simple. Probally won't make it again.

My husband and I both thought this was okay. It was easy to prepare, but we probably won't make it again.

My husband and I LOVE this. I scale this for 2 servings. I've made it many times but just adding a picture today. I make 2 servings of Texmati rice by itself using chicken broth with a few garlic granules and a small amount of salt and pepper. When done I put in a shallow bowl to cool. I used 2 Jenni-O Sweet Italian Turkey Sausages removed from casings and chopped it up while cooking with 1 T EVOO, seasoned with Lawry's Seasoned Salt  & garlic powder, pepper & a dash of thyme. I removed meat as soon as no pink left. Sauteed veggies in juices from meat adding some chicken broth as needed. When soft added meat & rice and heated. YUMMMM-O!!!

A good quick meal for a family. I would add diced tomatoes and some carrots in place of some of the peppers next time.

It was great!  Just be careful about how much salt is in the sausage you use otherwise it turns out too salty for me.  It was really yummy though!
