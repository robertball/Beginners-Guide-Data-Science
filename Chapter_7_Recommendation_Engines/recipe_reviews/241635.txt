2/3 cup water for 3 cups + flour is not enough.  Maybe 1 2/3 cups?

The only thing I changed was the quantity of sugar. I used a maximum of 2 Tablespoons. I believe the other flour and oil quantities are not a necessity. I used a total of 3 cups of flour/bread flour. I found the 1/4 cup oil and 2/3 cup water sufficient. Minus a buttery taste this makes me think of the old Chicago style deep dish pizza. I cooked my dough in a cast iron skillet, but prefer my own recipe.
