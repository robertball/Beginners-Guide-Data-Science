I'm the submitter of this recipe. As I look at the photos that people have added I notice that the brussels sprouts look to be halved or even whole.  One of the most important steps in this recipe, in my opinion, is to slice the sprouts very thinly, almost shred them - the way you would shred cabbage for cole slaw.  This keeps the cooking time down so the sprouts don't get mushy - they remain somewhat 'al dente' particularly if you cook somewhat like a stir fry.  Also, AR modified my instructions and say to add the vinegar when you add the sprouts.  I don't do that.  I add the vinegar after the sprouts are finished cooking - stirring it in right before tossing with the bacon and gorgonzola.  It gives the dish a nice bite!

Loved this. I used laughing cow blue cheese wedges and I roasted the Brussels sprouts in the oven because I like the carmelization, and then added them at the end to the mustard, vinegar and onion mixture.  Great way to dress up sprouts..I have leftovers , luckily.. mmmm

This was a great dish to prep ahead of time. I made the bacon, trimmed and sliced the Brussels sprouts in the morning then made the dish for dinner. Very easy and quick cooking once all the prep work is done. Even my husband loved it and he is a pickier eater than my three year old.

I made this for Christmas dinner yesterday, and it was a BIG hit!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't have any Gorgonzola so I spooned in about a half cup of bleu cheese salad dressing.  It was AWESOME!  Even the kids  like it!  My husband, who is picky, said "This is a keeper!"

This recipe is awesome!  My husband thought I was crazy making brussel sprouts- until I put this dish in front of him, and he devoured it!  Great addition of bacon- and we used feta cheese instead of blue... it was great!

Served this with beef tenderloin and it was a HUGE hit! It's different and sophisticated--the perfect side dish to a special meal. With the addendum from the recipe originator, I chose to shred the brussel spouts and stir-fry until tender-crisp. Having it all prepped and ready to go made it easy even @ the last minute. Enjoy!

I only had frozen sprouts and this turned out great!  I followed the recipe, probably used a bit extra vinegar and gorgonzola, but that's to my taste:)  great recipe since i'm not a big fan of brussels sprouts.

This was delicious, but it was a greasefest. Next time I will discard the bacon grease. It gave me a stomach ache. I also roasted the sprouts in the oven as another reviewer suggested.

Absolutely a taste sensation!  I've only tried the recipe with blue cheese crumbles and don't even want to try any other cheese because it all goes together like a horse and carrot.  I've made it three times so far (going to do it again this weekend) and it cooks longer than the recipe calls for - at least for our taste.  Was looking for a different way to do sprouts and this is a keeper.  Thank you Dutchgirl!

My fianc√© and I LOVE this dish!!!!! We have trained ourselves to think of it as a treat rather than just a side dish; we'd be eating it every night otherwise!!!! We eat Brussels sprouts at least once a week so we always have them in the fridge. The only thing that varies for us is how much blue cheese and bacon we use. Never the same amount twice as we use whatever we have on hand. You should see the excitement in our kitchen when one of us says, " Hey, we have the sprouts, and some bacon... Is there any Gorgonzola left in the fridge?"
Great recipe!!!! The kind of thing we go-to veggie roasters would never have thought of on our own.

I substituted pre-packaged bacon crumbles but used everything else according to the recipe, and it was delicious!  Not enough, mind you, to convert my brussels sprout-hating boyfriend, but nevertheless... I enjoyed this quite a bit.  The tang of the vinegar and mustard coupled with the creamy bite of the cheese crumbles gave this veg a new complexity and eased the bitterness of the usual brussels sprout side dish (which I personally love and adore).  And lest I forget, bacon makes everything better... that's just a given.  

I shaved the sprouts down on a mandoline when they were about 75% thawed (I used a bag of frozen sprouts).... but it dawned on me about halfway through that I could have cut the time and effort to almost nothing if I'd used the grating attachment on my food processor to shred them, so that's what I'll try next time.  I also might toss in a little extra cider vinegar since I really like that flavor with the sprouts.   I'm planning to make this again soon.... would be a great addition to any special occassion menu as well as a weeknight dinner.

Great ingredients, but there was Way too much Gorgonzola cheese for my liking. I should have added it a little bit at a time, to taste.

My wife cleaned her plate and that says a lot. I loved this recipe and will make this over and over.I did modify a little because i don't care for blue cheese. I used extra sharp cheddar and added half a bag of real bacon bits.

This was the first time I've ever purchased fresh burssel sprouts, (I think I've only purchased frozen once before).  Both my husband and I LOVED this recipe and I don't even care much for Blue Cheese, (Gorgonzola is a type of Blue Cheese).  I did see later that the author of this recipe said to slice the sprouts thinly to reduce cooking time and keep brussel sprouts crispy.  I will do this next time, and there will be a next time!  Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

These were gvery good! The bacon and gorgonzola were just enough to add an extra flavor, but not make the dish feel heavy.

These were awesome tasting, but I wish I would have read the submitter's addition to her review about shredding the brussel sprouts BEFORE I cooked them. My only complaint was that they had absorbed all the liquid and weren't fully cooked when I served them.  I think the directions need to be more specific. 
Also, I used the precooked bacon, because that's what I had in the house and I just cooked it for about a minute to crisp it up. There was so little grease that I had to use olive oil to cook the onions, which alleviated the greasy complaint.

This is one of our absolute favorite side dishes! Obviously, it's not the healthiest, but it's quite a treat! Hubby loves to request this one any time he sees blue cheese. I'm sure it will be a staple for us for years. Thanks for sharing!

We loved these, I cut the bacon in half and drained most of the grease based on suggestions. Very tasty and a nice change. You can even buy the fresh Brussel sprouts already shredded to save time.

Good groceries. Little to much bacon grease for my tastes. Modern bacon is too salty for me. I used EVOO and added flour making a reux with milk. Also added fresh garlic and lemon instead of vinegar (vinegar is great too). Some caraway seeds and some fresh ginger wouldn't hurt either. Bravo the cruciferous vegetable family!

This was wonderful! I prepared it in my wok as a stir fry and it was a big hit with both my hubby and I. The only alteration I did was to use balsamic vinegar instead of the cider vinegar called for in the recipe. It gave it a tangy sweetness one gets from the dressing on a wedge salad.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner with Brussels sprouts from our garden.  It was a big hit even among those that are not wild about Brussels sprouts.  I followed the recipe as written and it was great.

Use less onion, no Gorgonzola, and Vegetable Better-Than-Bouillon instead of water.

Great recipe. As with most recipes, I put it on steroids with more onion and bacon. Usually have the cheese on the side for those who care for it. It's a big hit in our Holiday table.

This was pretty good.  My family aren't huge fans of blue or feta cheese but this went over well.  I used baby sprouts so I didn't shred them, went easy on the cheese and omitted the vinegar.

This was excellent!  Was looking for a different way to make brussels sprouts and this was perfect!  I did use a sweet onion vs. a red onion instead.  Will make again!

This was surprisingly good.  I love bacon, but was grossed out at the thought of using all the bacon grease, so I discarded most of it.  Used just a small amount of gorgonzola cheese, maybe 1/4 of a cup.  I had never made Brussels sprouts and wasn't exactly sure how to prepare them...we removed several of the outer leaves and trimmed off the bottom stalk, then cut them in half, lengthwise.  I don't think there is any need to "thinly slice" them, as the recipe indicates.

I understand this recipe was designed for those who may not enjoy the taste of brussel sprouts, but for someone like me who does enjoy their flavor, I found this dish to be a bit overwhelming, flavor-wise.  I substituted bleu cheese, and only used 1/4 the amount the recipe called for.  It was good, but in the future I would skip the cheese and dijon.  I think the bacon drippings and crumbles add plenty of flavor.

I have made this so many times already I can't believe I haven't rated it until now.  I have a friend who requests this when she comes for dinner and over the weekend we had her birthday dinner.  Her father called me the next day for the recipe, he was making it again for that night! I like it better when I sub chicken stock for the water. I use fresh sprouts and they do take longer than 4-6 minutes to make them tender. I have to admit, I never use the vinegar, I'm not much of a vinegar person.

I have tried to like Brussels sprouts for years and FINALLY I have found the right recipe. Roasting the sprouts first was a plus. I drizzled the vinegar on the sprouts and let them sit for about 15 minutes before adding the sprouts into the final step. Got the little bit of the tang of vinegar without the bite. Will make this again.

Made recipe with a couple of changes.....used chix broth instead of the water and added an extra tsp. of Dijon.  We really liked the"sprouts" done in this fashion, however, there was too much liquid left in the pan.  Next time, I would cut back initially on the liquid and add more if necessary.  Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper.  I didn't have Gorgonzola cheese on hand, but did have some bleu cheese.  Very good with the bleu cheese.  Thank you for sharing. this recipe.

I love Brussels sprouts, but my hubby is not a fan.  He was willing to try this recipe though and I just about fell over when he told me that he could make a meal just out of the Brussels sprouts - it was that good!  I had blue cheese crumbles on hand, so I substituted that for the Gorgonzola.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly - YUM!

Served with New York Strips w/ a Jalapeno marinade for a scrumptious meal. This provided an excellent foil for spicy steaks, utilizing the Gorgonzola cheese as a cooling agent for when the peppers flared too much. It's also a tasty dish on its own. It was well worth the effort. While we did not shred the sprouts, we instead quartered them, and let boil for about 5 min, then covered and steamed the sprouts till tender.
