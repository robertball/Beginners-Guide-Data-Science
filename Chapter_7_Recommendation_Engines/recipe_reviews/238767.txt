This will be  my go to desert recipe for the summer.  Only suggestion I have is to let the mango thaw a bit before putting in processor.  Makes for easier blending.  Also added 1/4 cup mango nectar to help with processing. Thinking of trying this recipe using other frozen fruits.

Also worked with frozen mixed tropical fruit. It ended up being a soft-serve ice cream consistency, which we liked

Very good taste and texture! Just the right amount of sweetness... I would suggest freezing for 10-20 minutes after processing to harden up slightly.

I really liked this recipe. However, I would substitute 1/4 cup of agave and two tablespoons of white sugar for the current sweetener. I find that brown sugar makes it too grainy, and confectioners sugar makes the taste not as good. Other than this, I find the recipe a very good one. It is great for a healthy treat, and pleases everyone who's tried it so far!

Although very easy to make, I found I needed to more than double the confectioner's sugar, otherwise it was way too tart (and I don't mind tart). I'll be serving it tomorrow, along with some other desserts, so that will tell if company likes it. I was going to make a double batch, but after making the first one, it looked like enough for 8 dessert bowls.

I didnâ€™t have any mango so I just replaced it with strawberries. Very delicious and refreshing. I omitted the sugar and replaced it with a stevia and Erythritol blend. Absolutely incredible

I received a box of yummy mangoes from a neighbor and I thought (what can I do with these while they're ripe) so I cubed them up and froze them on a sheet tray.  Next day I added them with some vanilla nonfat greek yogurt and a just a bit of agave syrup (instead of sugar)  to my food processor.  Turned out delicious!  I can't wait to try this recipe with maybe some frozen strawberries next time..

I gave it 5 stars for how easy it looks to make
I haven't made it yet
I'm making it tomorrow
I just put the mango chunks in the freezer
Just one quick question
What sugar did you use in this recipe?
Thank you
