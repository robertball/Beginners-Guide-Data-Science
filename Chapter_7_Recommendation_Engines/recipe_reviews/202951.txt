I'm not sure why they took off my recommendation when I posted the recipe - I suggested serving them with a roasted red pepper sauce, but tzatziki or something similar would be just as good. Definitely better with some sort of sauce though, I agree!

Oh my goodness!! Delicious! I love allrecipes.com and use it all the time, but this was the first recipe to make me right  a review. These burgers had so much flavor! I was a little worried because I made them for a group of 12, but after eating them, I printed out the recipe for everyone per request. A few minor changes: I used more breadcrumbs, and before throwing them on bbq, I fried on a skillet with minimal oil to get them nice and firm so they wouldn't fall through the grill. I served with "Easy Greek Yogurt Cucumber Sauce" from this site, and it was an A+ dinner that I will continue to make for the rest of my life! Thanks DC Katie

I thought this was an excellent way to eat a burger in a more healthier way than red meat. I did add a little more sun-dried tomatoes and herbs and also some minced garlic but we are garlic loving family! Also instead of "folding" in the feta, I made two thin patties, added feta put the two together and mashed and pinched the sides together to keep closed. I didn't really understand the folding in thing. I would need to see someone do it to be know what they are talking about. 
I also used Tzatziki sauce on the burgers as a condiment. I will definitely make it again!

Fabulous!  I made the recipe as called for (although I used dried spices, not fresh), and it turned out amazing.  Love the feta cheese center!  I put roasted red pepper hummus on the buns and served with lettuce.  Delicious.  I'll definitely be making this again.

I've made this only twice, but the first time I used fresh spices and the second time, I used dried; honestly, they tested similar enough that I'd cheap out and go with the latter. Delicious and moist!

Really disappointed in these dry/tasteless ground chicken burgers after all the good reviews.  Made as written but to no avail.  I topped with leftover homemade tzatziki sauce (from the chicken gyro souvlaki pita recipe on this site REALLY good, try it), red onions, tomato and lettuce in hopes of salvaging but it just had no taste at all.  Only advice I can give if you do want to make this is to make sure and use one pound of chicken and do make 5 burgers.  Bigger is NOT better with this recipe, the seasonings are so subtle that you need the less meat to more seasoning ratio.  Also, the egg addition makes the mixture very ooey, gooey.  Folding in the feta is a little weird b/c it's so wet, but by the third burger you'll be a pro at the insert/fold-over/pat into burger shape.  I won't remake, but a lot of folks on here will so if it interests you try it.

These were very yummy but a little dry.  It needed something else.  Maybe a sauce or Greek dressing even.  I will definately make them again.

very good burgers - and we are beef lovers.  I add extra sun-dried and extra feta, little less oregano.

Have had his recipe for a while in my box, but today I decided on ground chicken burgers. Changed this a little bit. Added egg, Panko crumbs, lemon jce and had some roasted red peppers w/garlic so added instead of sun-dried tomatoes. Very moist & delish. Added dried oregano and basil and dried cumin, coriander, ginger, tarragon, curry powder & garlic powder. Skipped salt & pepper. Had some fat free feta and put that into the ground chicken. Heated my favorite non-stick pan w/light olive oil and made the burgers in about 15 minutes. Great flavor and exremely moist & flavorful. Could use sun-dried tomatoes next time but this was great. Served with a simple salad and homemade honey mustard dressing. WOW!

Absolutley Amazing! We loved these. Only change was to use roasted red peppers instead of the sun dried tomatoes (personal preference, not a fan of the tomatoes). I also used a cracked black pepper feta. Served with cucumber sauce, cucumbers and red onion. Thanks for the GREAT recipe:)

Good burger, I didn't find it dry at all.  I cooked it indoors in a skillet, so that may have made a difference.

OMG! I didn't expect much, but since I was recently diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, I thought I'd give this a try. The burgers were absolutely delicious. Substituting what I had in the kitchen, I used a purchased bruschetta instead of the sun dried tomatoes, used dried oregano, and left out the basil. Served in a whole wheat pita with a yogurt Tzatziki sauce, the burgers were absolutely wonderful and also inspired me to write my first review. I will be making these again - often!

These went over fairly well at my house, and were a great way to eat the ground chicken I had got on sale. (As well as the feta that's been sitting in the fridge.)  I bet they would also be good with turkey.  I did use and entire cup of bread crumbs though--maybe my mean was unusually watery?

Love the recipe! It's moist and flavorful! 
I did add a pinch of garlic powder (you can grate a medium size garlic as well) to enhance the flavor, turned out great!

These  were surprisingly good - I had some ground chicken in the freezer that needed to be used up, plus all the ingredients for this recipe were on hand, so it was  a good choice.  The feta part was a bit tricky for the first pattie, but the rest were easy, and the cheese didn't ooze out which they were cooking - I did mine in the skillet, just because I was too lazy to fire up the BBQ.  Next time, I'll make them with turkey in the skillet, then put them on the BBQ.

These were really good!  I followed the recipe exactly, except cooked them indoors in a skillet (too windy to grill).  I used a sandwich thin for the bun, and like a previous reviewer, I spread some roasted red pepper hummus on the bun and some lettuce.  I would have put money on my 5 year old not eating this, but he gobbled it down.  That says a lot!  Thanks!

Really liked these. Added onion, ommited the sundried tomatoes just because I didnt have them on hand. Will do that next time along with some kalamata olives. Just folded the cheese in with everything else. Made smaller sliders so I could make sure they were done through, but not dry. Very yummy and healthy!

Love, love, love this recipe! Didn't grill them, though...cooked them in a pan. Might make them into meatballs next time.  I ate them without a bun and served with some roasted red potato wedges I found in the frozen section.

Big Hit!
Substituted egg for 2 TBSP of Greek Salad Dressing, used dried herbs instead of fresh and omitted tomatoes. Cooked in a skillet with 1 TBSP olive oil. Served on a bun with lettuce and mayo- PERFECT!
Will definitely make again and pass onto friends :)

I must say that these were by far the best tasting burger I've had. The Sundried Tomatoes really did it! The only thing that is a disappointment is that chicken when made as a burger loses it's juiciness like beef does when cooking. But again, very flavorful burgers. A must try!

Excellent! I followed the recipe as written except for the fresh basil and fresh oregano. Since they are not in season, I used dried Italian seasoning instead. I used a meat thermometer to make sure they were cooked to the correct temperature and made sure to only flip them once while grilling. I served them on 100% whole wheat Pepperidge Farm Deli Flats (only 100 calories) and used a spicy hummas and spinach as my toppings. Delicious!! I will definitely make these more often.

First off- until now I hated  ground chicken. I found a package  on sale and  couldn't resist, then set out to find a tolerable way to eat it. Oh MY ! I made this as  stated, using  what is on hand, so soft fresh breadcrumbs, skipped the  tomato. I pan-fried in a little olive oil , and  topped  with roasted red peppers from the  jar on sandwich thins. What a keeper this is. Thank you.
UPDATE :  Okay now I'm hooked on ground chicken. The next logicl step - bought  skinless boneless chicken breast  (much cheaper) and  used  the food processor and  'ground' my own chicken - wow ! It's even better - if that's possible. I've now made  them 4 times- I am loving this , Again, thank you :)

A family favorite! We typically use ground turkey instead of chicken, otherwise I follow the recipe. I love it topped with avocado.

This is our new favorite way to eat burgers...at least while we are dieting. I've never put the lemon juice in it because I normally don't have any in the house and I can't find sun dried tomatoes in my store for some reason, so I put a little bit of sun dried tomato pesto in the chicken mixture. I also don't bother "folding" in the feta (reduced fat) and just mix into the meat before forming them into patties. I like to top it with tzatsciki sauce, but I'm sure anything you want to top it with would work. The burgers always come out juicy and taste great!

I made this last night for my family. Thumbs up around the table. However, I added a Tzatziki sauce and that really made the dish. It kept the patty from being too dry and brought out the flavors. There are plenty of recipes for Tzatziki on this site. Since in my opinion, the dish needed the sauce, I gave it 4 stars. With the sauce, it was a definite 5.

This was good.  Just a nice different way to have chicken. I cooked mine to 160 and then took them out and let them rest for 5 minutes. Cooked perfect. Nice and juicy.  I did not have sun dried tomatoes so I finely chopped a canned tomato to get two tablespoons.

making these now. Tiny cpl changes; I used half the amount of oregano bc it was dry and I was running out; I doubled the fresh basil cause I love basil, I use about 3/4 tblsp lemon jc, I added a tsp of garlic powder and onion powder, and I mixed the crumbled feta cheese right into the mix. Hoping it is yummy. did not use salt, only 1/4 tsp pepper bc it was the restaurant big grain kind, very strong. Turned out pretty well. I would make these again.

These are the first non-beef burgers I will be making on a regular basis.  I worried about the feta 'leaking', but as long as you're careful not to leave any exposed on the surface, the cheese stays inside.  Absolutely delicious!

Loved it. Instead of the fresh basil and sun dried tomatoes, I used a basil pesto and sundried tomato pesto.. I shallow fried them for just a bit before putting them on the BBQ so it didn't crumble.. put 2 eggs instead of one. Instead of bread crumbs, just pulverized a toast. :) Nailed it.

I made this tonight for my wife and I and we did like it a lot. She made a home made Tzatziki to go with it and it was really good with the burger. I made the burgers into sliders and served them on a pretzel slider bun (with salt). We will make this again.

I'm not sure I'd ever make these again. Although the burger itself is SUPER moist, the flavor is just so-so. As the recipe submitter suggests, these do need some sort of sauce. I purchased a container of roasted red pepper hummus to serve on our sandwiches - which also made a great dip for the pita chips I served on the side! Maybe these will float your boat, but they just didn't wow me. Thanks anyways, Katie! :-)

My 3 year old, 6 year old and I loved this.  The fresh herbs from the garden made this dish.  I didn't have bread crumbs and just substituted ground oatmeal instead.  Because I was preparing and grilling with 3 little kids, I just mixed the fresh goat milk feta right in and YUM! We will definitely be making these again. As previous reviewers stated, they are good with a spicy or yogurt sauce.

Really good! I don't usually have the fresh herbs on hand unless it is summer, but I think I will try dried. And I am more likely to have ground Turkey, so I'll probably try that. Point is, I will definitely be trying this recipe again.

I saw that the original submitter recommends roasted red peppers sauce, tzatziki, or something. I agree that a topping/sauce is required, just like any other chicken sandwich or burger. We did a Greek salad and used this on the chicken. Really tasty - served with fries and salad and homemade buns. Thanks for a great option!

This is a lovely recipe.  My husband survived a heart attack and is craving burgers, which he no longer can have.  This was INTERESTING to eat.  I had one change - I used the egg substitute for this and it was just fine.  I might have to switch out the feta in the future, but this has the husband's stamp of approval.  It was lovely served on onion buns with a touch of cucumber sauce.

Very good!  I followed the recipe except I add dried herbs in place of fresh.  We put Trader Joe's tzatziki on top!  Sometimes I serve this without the bun and have some roasted veggies on the side.  Yummy!

I don't usually have ground chicken but it was marked down so I picked it up and this was a terrific way to use it!! Yummy! I pretty much stuck to the recipe but added a little dill and left out the sundried tomatoes since I didn't have them. DELICIOUS!! Very moist and I spread spicy pepper hummus on the bun with red onion and basil leaves. Thank you, will definitely make again!

Very  easy to throw together. I accidentally mixed the seasonings and lemon juice with the feta first, so I added a little more of all seasonings and lemon juice to the ground chicken. It turned out as expected, extra flavorful...which is what my family likes! Created a sauce with greek yogurt, feta, roasted red peppers, fresh basil and a little fresh garlic. Very yummy and impressive. We ate them without a bun with a salad on the sideThanks for a simple, yet yummy ground chicken recipe.  It can be hard to come by something that isn't "mexican" style for ground chicken.

My family loved these burgers. My husband wanted them again so I made them twice in one week! I also used dried basil and oregano. I forgot to buy the sundried tomatoes so I skipped that ingredient but I did add 2 Tbsp of greek dressing and garlic powder. I toasted the bun and topped the burger with lettuce and greek salad dressing. Delicious!

the only thing i changed was i used ground turkey and added a few minced garlic cloves. these were spectacular. i made a sauce from miracle whip and sriracha (those were the only things i had, really) and it added a good sweet/spiciness. my fiance actually said "this may be the best burger i've ever had" and he wants it to go on rotation for company! thanks for the recipe!

Excellent fast dinner! I put a low carb spin on this one... replaced bread crumbs with 1/3 cup coconut flour and used capers instead of sun dried tomatoes. I also amped up the lemon and oregano and skipped the basil.

Served them along side a nice garden salad with vinaigrette! I will be making these weekly for sure!

OH and they are equally as good cold later this evening!

Who knew ground chicken could be so exciting? Fresh basil and fresh oregano make this a super flavourful burger. Grill to perfection and remove when the char marks are just visible. Overcooking this would be a terrible unforgiveable sin. Don't be that person.

Loved it! Changes: used 1/2 tsp dried oregano and 1 tsp epicure Greek spice, and 1 tbsp finely minced onion. Was very wet, so divided into 5 balls and chilled an hour. Divided feta, then dipped ball in cornmeal so it wouldn't stick to my palm, stuffed in the feta, folded over and then dipped the top in cornmeal and onto the George Forman 6-7 min. Served over chopped cucumber and tomato with 1/4 tsp epicure tzatziki dip spice and fresh cilantro, topped the burger with tzatziki and a side of fresh crisped nan. 
Was moist in the centre with an appealing texture from the cornmeal on the outside.

My DH and I loved this.  Perfect amount of everything.  Had to cook in a skillet because the meat was so soft even after refrigerating.  Had no trouble with them drying out at all.
We needed no condiments either; they were juicy and delicious.  DH says this is a keeper.  Will make again.  Thanks for the post!

Excellent recipe.  I would recommend the ingredients list be updated to reflect 1 tablespoon of Oregano though, since 3 tsp = 1 tbsp.  One less thing to wash!

Very good! And that was after I accidentally mixed in the feta into the entire batch with the other ingredients and forgot the eggs!!! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that my kids weren't as crazy about it, but they ate it all and that counts for something!

Fantastic recipe. Made as written except left out bread crumbs as I'm low carbing. Held together beautifully.

FANTASTIC finally a new burger for me.  If you know how to BBQ you shouldn't dry it out.  I found some great " Ace " rosemary buns for them.  Made it into 4 servings, I like bigger patties.

I wanted to do something quick, easy but different with my ground chicken, and this recipe fit the bill. It was absolutely perfect on a bed of bean sprouts and  baby spinach.

No fresh oregano so I used 1.5 teaspoons of the dried powdered stuff and it still tasted great. Also added a 1/2 tablespoon of dried parsley and I think that gave it an extra sumthin sumthin. Substitute turkey if you like - still tastes great. Serve with greek salad (to use up up the extra feta you'll have) with a side of tzatziki sauce. Yum!

These were amazing. So many positive reviews! The only thing I might have done a little different when putting these together was adding fresh herbs from my garden and a tinge more than the recipe called for cause I eyed them. I also made four patties since I wanted them larger and they were going on the grill. I can tell from the family these will be on the list indefinitely! Oh, and by the way, the only burger I've ever eaten that didn't need sauce!

These chicken burgers have a subtle, but very nice flavor. The leftovers definitely tasted better the next day. I served these with Easy Greek Yogurt Cucumber Sauce from this site.

We love this recipe! It's one my kids request when they come home from college. I've used both dry and fresh herbs & both work equally well - just remember to use about 1/3 the amount specified if you're subbing dry for fresh.

These were great!  I only made 4 burgers.  I used dried oregano, in half the amount called for, in place of fresh.  Also I used sundried tomatoes in olive oil, which may explain why mine were not very dry, like other reviewers had commented.   I had tried to make up a roasted red pepper yogurt sauce to go with this, but it did not turn out right.  I think once I get a recipe for that or make up a good one myself, these burgers will be even tastier!

We made these for the first time tonight, and the flavor was very nice, they were really moist. We pan grilled them, and I took 1/2 cup of light mayo and mixed it with 2 TBSP of fresh lemon juice as a topping for the burger. It really amped up the flavor. next time I think we will increase the feta and sun dried tomatoes a bit since we like strong flavor profiles.

I made a pretty significant change. I substituted half of the ground chicken w/half a finely grated zucchini, half a finely grated carrot and one-quarter a finely grated red pepper, similar to "rissoles" which I discovered in Australia (about half ground meat and half grated vegetable in a burger patty), because I was afraid that ground chicken alone might be a little dense or dry and because I like to make things a little healthier. Other than that, followed exactly and topped w/tzatziki sauce. Excellent!

We loved it.  The only thing I did different was I baked the burgers at 350 for 10 minutes a side.  They turned out nice and moist.  I also put the broiler on high for 2 minutes to brown them a bit

This was quite tasty, and EASY.  I substituted olives for the sun-dried tomato, because I didn't have tomatos, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.

I cooked these burgers inside and I used dried spices instead of fresh but they still came out unbelievably moist and juicy!  They are are very flavorful and I love the feta cheese center.  I served the burgers with tomatoes and sweet red pepper hummus on whole grain cibata bread and they tasted AMAZING!

These were something definitely new and different. True, they could've used a sauce to dress it up, but they were good witih ketchup, mayo, mustard, and topped with onion. I also broke half of a burger over a salad with balsamic vinagrette dressing. That was tasty! Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought overall this was a pretty tasty recipe. I made a couple of changes, I added finely diced red peppers, garlic, 2 tbsp of greek dressing, 4 tbsp of clubhouse greek seasoning. The smell was amazing and the taste was pretty good but it didn't quite taste as greeky and I would like. I would make this again for sure.

I used ground turkey instead of ground chicken, and I only used a 1/2 pound of turkey but left the rets of the ingredients the same.  I left out the egg bc I didn't think they really needed it.  Not sure if the dryness is bc people are using dried sun dried tomatoes or if it's just not enough moistness with that much meat.  I used sun dried tomatoes packed in oil--I figured it would keep the burgers moist and keep them from sticking on the grill.  I ended up with 3 regular size and one small burger, which works perfectly since there's only the two of us.  I made flat burgers, put the feta on, then topped with another burger.  Worked perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very yummy, moist, burgers.  Made them with ground beef on the stove top (wintertime) and they stayed together better than most homemade burgers I've tried.  I've given them a four only because the flavor, while good, wasn't especially strong or Greek.  Next time I think I'll try adding more feta and tomatoes.  I also used 2 eggs because the mixture looked a little dry at first.  Great burger find!

These were excellent! I looked a bit to moist when I added the 1/2 cup of bread crumbs so I sprinkled it on the burger after I formed them and it was great. It added a bit of crunch on the outside, but the inside was moist still. We really enjoyed them.  I made a roasted red pepper aolei sauce in case they were too dry.  Didnt need it but it was a nice compliment.  DELICIOUS!
