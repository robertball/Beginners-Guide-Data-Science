Scotty, I loved you recipe. Being Brazilian (portuguese speeking), I ask you to please correct 2 words: grandmother is "VovoÂ´" and sighs is "Suspiros".

These are quite refreshing!  Of course, I never have vinegar on-hand so I substituted 2 tsp of lemon juice for the vinegar.  Makes for a nice chewy, lemony cookie.  They're also quite pretty!

Good stuff Scotty! I'm not Portuguese, but I grew up in New Bedford eating lots of Portuguese cuisine. This reminds me of holidays over my friends house. I live in Vegas now, but my buddy who's family owns the Salchicaria in New Bedford send me boxes of great Portuguese food to enjoy out here.

I don't know if mine were what they are supposed to be, I followed the directions exactly, but I didn't care for them.  Maybe I'll try some other time and see if I get different results.

Thanks for the recipe Scotty. My family is from Portugal and this is my mom's favorite cookie.  I didn't give a full five stars because mine didn't look like the ones I see in the bakery...but I have to say they're still delicious! I think my egg white amount might have been off since the eggs were different sizes, but I'm definitly going to try to make them again.  Thank you.

I made these for a very good friend who is Portuguese. They turned out quite good but even after making 2 batches they were chewy on the bottom and hollow. I guess they aren't supposed to be that way? They still got gobbed up on Christmas though!

Thank you for the recipe very much! 
I just wanted to also stick up for you.
Vovo also means grandma
Espiros also mean meringue which anyone could sigh over.
Brazillian portuguese is not the same as the Azores, Central CA or Portugal.
