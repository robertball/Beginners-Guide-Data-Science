No need to use my slow cooker anymore for bone broth - using the IP is much quicker and easier! This is a great base recipe that can be customized to your preferences. I used marrow bones I bought from the butcher. I took them out of the oven at 30 mins as the vegetables were starting to burn, so maybe a slightly lower cook temp would be better. The broth didn't gel up like it normally does when I make it, but the flavor was still great!

I did use organic beef bones and organic vegetables. The broth was tasty and had a very gelatinous texture when cooled. I will definitely make it many times.

I use grassfed organic beef bones with a small chuck of beef stew meat. I add a small bunch of Thyme and a jalapeno pepper.
Very delicious and part of the routine I'm using to heal my damaged gut.

I have been making beef bone broth in the slow cooker for several years, however, this is the first time making it using my IP since I received it last month for Christmas.  This recipe seems to be spot on with the roasting time, the ingredients and the cooking time.  It is now my new "go to" recipe for the future.

Quite easy, and good, not too salty which is a big deal for me.  A great base for soups and stews.

I won't make it in the instant pot again.  The marrow in the bone was still inside the bone.
