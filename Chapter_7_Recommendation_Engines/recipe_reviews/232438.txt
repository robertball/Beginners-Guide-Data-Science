I changed the cooking procedure a bit and I loved the end results. I used bone in chicken legs and thighs because that's what I had. I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper and placed in a greased dish. I mixed the two cans of cream soup with 1/2 cup broth and poured it over the chicken. I then sauteed celery and onions in the butter added 1/2 cup broth and mixed it with the dried stuffing. I poured it over the chicken covered it and baked for 60 minutes. I uncovered it and baked it for another 15 minutes until the stuffing was nicely toasted. Thanks for a great recipe!

Definitely a husband pleaser.   I cooked the chicken in the slow cooker, then used the resulting broth to make the stuffing.  I ended up tripling the stuffing, but it made a ton of meals to keep in the freezer.  Thanks for a simple hearty recipe.

Super simple to put this one together and it is a man pleaser. I used cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom since it is what I had. I didn't serve this over mashed potatoes but it would have been better if I had. It seemed to need something else beneath it as it was more of a saucy topper. It was very good and we enjoyed this dish quite a bit. I will be fixing this again. Thanks!

Great flavor. We thought that there was way too much liquid. In fact my husband said "wow this looks soupy." I would cut the liquid to 1 1/2 cups total. No need for chicken broth water is fine. It makes it less salty. Will make again.

The first time I tried it I made it exactly as posted and it was good but I think it lacked a little something. This time I used cream of celery soup fresh chopped celery and canned mushrooms. I served it over seasoned rice pilaf but I think regular white rice or mashed potatoes would have been great..and a small side salad...It a great weeknight favorite for us.

This is a good base to make a customized casserole using your pantry ingredients. I cooked the chicken with a tbsp of chili powder for more flavor added water chestnuts for crunch and frozen peas for color. I sautéed a small onion and fresh celery in the butter and mixed all of the casserole before putting it into the baking dish. It was delicious and will be a frequent dinner option. Some more options using seasonal vegetables like broccoli green beans carrots as varied additions will be used as well.

If you're into casseroles as I am this is the ticket!!;-) I've even made it with precooked and/or canned chicken--same results 5?;-) This is comfort food at its finest.:-) Being a Southerner & cooking for over 50 years this is one that can be made by novice & "old heads":-D alike. I guarantee you'll get the same results each time-5?. Don't forget to adjust your cooking times. Believe it or not I've never combined soups; however cream of mushroom & chicken ROCKS!! Make it tonight; you won't be disappointed.;-) It's a slamming off-the-hook chicken dinner both you & your family will love!! Promise.;-) Enjoy!!;-)

family LOVED IT cleaned up the entire 9 X 13 dish!!! no real changes made other than adding some crushed croutons to the stove top just to use up almost empty bags and extend the stuffing mix!!! and using the water that the chicken boiled in for the water and I had added salt and a couple garlic cloves to the chicken as it was boiling... I save any and all chicken broth intended or otherwise:) if we don't use them I add them to the dogs food... GREAT RECIPE WITH A TON OF Potential for additions or changes MANY THANK YOUS oh and served with old boxed mashed potato mix spiced up with fresh garlic and cream cheese with chives.. and left over Ratatoulli

Easy to make. One suggestion would be use unsalted butter as mine turned out more salty than I'd like I think it was the butter.

Instead of boiling the chicken I sautéed it in olive oil with salt and pepper. I also used cream of celery soup. I used salted butter instead of margarine. This recipe reminded me of Chicken Helper that my Mom made in the '80s:) This came out pretty good. Next time I make this I might double the stuffing.

I agree with others--too much liquid and I had reduced it as I used only two chicken breasts which I cooked in chicken broth. I did not use any water and reduced the amount of chicken broth. If I make this again and I probably won't I will reduce the liquid further.

Made exactly as is with cornbread stuffing because that's what I had on hand. Was so simple and so good. Served over rice. Next time I will add broccoli.

I made this and my son the picky eater loved it!!!  He went back for more.  He told me to fix it more often. I really don’t like cooking and this recipe was easy and my guys approved.

I made a few changes but I don t think they made so much of a difference that it affected the basic recipe. I boiled my chicken in broth and used that brother for the recipe. I also doubled the stuffing because I love it! Came out great! Flavorful and creamy crunchy salty goodness! Will definitely make again and perhaps add fresh mushrooms and peas to the chicken mixture!

Delicious, however I ended up using 2 boxes of stuffing due to the size of my baking dish.  This is a keeper!

We loved this. Although if you don t appreciate salt you may not. I only had two cans of cream of chicken and no mushroom soup so that s what I used. I also used butter instead of margarine. We shredded the chicken instead of chunks. Very easy and pretty quick. Served this with mashed potatoes and green beans.

I love stuffing so I tend to add a little more stuffing than required with an equal balance of the liquids called for.

Good stuff right here.  My family loved it!  I read the reviews, so I did only add 1/2 c broth to the canned soups... and I did saute onion and garlic in some butter and add that into the soup mix.  So, very minor changes were made, but I bet it would have been great without them.  Great comfort food.  Served with corn and mashed potatoes... delish!
