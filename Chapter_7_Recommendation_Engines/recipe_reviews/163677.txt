A solid Tom Collins recipe.  Omit the bitters if you don't have them.  I use less lemon juice (1 ounce).  Fresh lemon juice is best, but bottled will work in a pinch.  If you want something light and refreshing, try this recipe!  If you're not a gin fan, substitue vodka for a Vodka Collins.

Pretty Good!
I didn't have bitters on hand, so I left that out, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Enjoying one right now.  Light and refreshing.  Will probably make a 2nd one later...

This is one of my favourite bar drinks.  Not too sweet, but not too sour either.  
Highly recommended.

Fantastic... my husband loves tom collins and I had to atempt it. Made it two nights in a row and my husband and I felt like we were on holiday. A movie on our tv, cheese and crackers, and tom collins.  The shaker caused a great refreshing froth at the top! I had a date with John and Tom.

I hate drinks that are too sweet but added just a bit more simple syrup to cut the tartness. This is light and refreshing. Perfect compliment to Gin's botanicals.

Excellent recipe for one of my personal faves.
I had my first TC at Silversands in Kenya, way back in 1967. I was blockading Rhodesia, and based in Mombasa. TCs on the beach were most welcome.
The barman at Silversands used fresh lime juice, a good shot of fresh orange juice, and a shot or two of Angostura. Served in a tall, very cold glass, with crushed ice and club soda. 
Nothing better.
Still make them to this recipe. Just wish we had a few blue-balled monkeys leaping around to complete the effect, and maybe a gigantic orange spider or two to freak me out.

This is soooo flippin' good. Like, could really REALLY get you in trouble good... Make it with the bitters if you can - a bottle isn't stupid expensive, and it just adds something indescribably delicious to the mix. Sometimes though, I cut back on the simple syrup just a touch, and add the tiniest splash of the juice from the maraschino cherries. Really good, too. Anyway, thanks, c-biskit! Your drink is fab!

I tried this recipe for the first time and have to admit, it is delicious and refreshing indeed. I used Perrier Sparkling L'Orange instead of Club Soda. I would also skip the Bitters. Perfection!!!!!

First try followed exactly, felt the amount of lemon juice over powered the drink. Next try only used 1oz lemon juice, 1.5 simple syrup. Turned out great.

Round out with dash of blood orange bitters.
