Great, very easy and healthy (especially with skin removed).  I did not have methi leaves so I used spinach instead.  I also did not use all the read pepper.  Thanks!

I used boneless breasts and fenugreek powder. Very good!  Boyfriend said he could eat it all night long.

Made this and was in LOVE! Methi is one of my favorite spices. This dish was very easy to make.

Thank you. I really loved this healthy and simple recipe. I did not have a pressure cooker but cooked it in a pan with closed lid and it came out great. Also I did not have fresh fenugreek so I used fresh spinach as suggested in a review.
Overall a healthy and easy recipt
