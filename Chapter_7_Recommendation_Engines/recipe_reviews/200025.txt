I'm not sure why the recipe mentions carmelized bananas because they won't come out that way unless you cook them in a pan with butter before adding them to your bread mixture...  I used a around casserole dish (maybe a 2qt with glass lid) instead of ramekins.  After cubing the bread, add bananas (I also added golden raisins that I soaked in water for 20 minutes) to the dish.  Add the egg mixture (I added cinnamon to the egg mixture) to the bread and let soak for 20 minutes (10 minutes wasn't long enough, i wanted it to be very moist).  I cooked at 350, 20 minutes covered, 15 minutes uncovered (use the last 15 minutes to make a delish rum sauce, search for it on all recipes, its super easy to make!!).. You wont be able to tell what kind of bread is used, you can honestly use whatever you have on hand, I used 12 grain bread tonight, it came out great!!

I just pulled it out of the oven 5 minutes ago and hubby ate two bowls of it already!  I used toasted white bread, as I had no wheat bread.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon each of nutmeg and cinnamon.  I baked it in a casserole dish instead of individually, and had to bake it for 1 hour, 15 minutes.  It needs something, though, perhaps butter.
