Oh wow! Best apple crisp ever! I made it as written first time and it was good, but the second time, it was even better when I made these changes: I omitted the white sugar and subbed in brown sugar, doubled the cinnamon, added some ginger (a healthy dash) and some nutmeg (a regular dash). I also omitted the water, it was not necessary and my second batch without the water was a much, much better consistency. (The apples are juicy and release that juice when baked, so go ahead and skip adding that water.) Oh, and in both batches, I used old-fashioned oats, not the quick cooking kind and I subbed corn starch for the flour in the filling, something I always do for fruit pies, cobblers, etc... :-)

I never review recipes but I couldn't let this one go without. I had a crazy amount of apples from my nanas trees and was apple buttered right to death so I decided to switch it up for this apple crisp. I made a pan for both my mother and mother in law (who is an amazing cook) and my mother in law lost her mind when she tasted it. Its all she could talk about all day. I used brown sugar instead of white and doubled the cinnamon. Hands down best apple crisp ever!

I thought this applecrisp was delicious, can't even tell it's healthier.  I even substituted two tablespoons of the butter with water and it was still really good.

Smells delicious, like apple pie! Made 2 pans for healthy potlucks @ husband's & my work. Used 10 large honeycrisp apples, 5. lbs, from local farmer, for each 9 x 13 recipe. It will fill the pan (with a rounded top like a cake), so press the topping on with a large spoon and put the pan on a foil-lined cookie sheet. Followed others' suggestions & added some of my own. Use apple corer/peeler, all brown sugar, all whole wheat fllour, old fashioned oats, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 1 tsp. cloves, & 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. Stir 2 tsp. vanilla extract into melted butter. Wondered whether initial sugar/flour/water mixture would blend in better if it were stirred into apples rather than sprinkled on top. Next time (and there definitely will be a next time!) I would either omit water or add cornstarch or tapioca to water, since it was rather watery. Apples did not get mushy. Tasted great & husband's co-workers ate the entire pan! We were very busy & only had time for 1/2 a pan! It's a keeper!



Revised 10/20/15: Moved to WI & picked fresh apples from our two trees in backyard. Made six 8 x 8 apple crisps already using half a recipe with the following changes: Omit water & sugar (my apples are like red delicious, juicy & sweet), use cornstarch instead of flour in filling, decrease cinnamon to 1/2 tsp, 1/4 tsp. cloves, 1/8 tsp. nutmeg. but keep melted butter @ 1 stick for each topping. (Seems crisper if you mix in 1/2 stick, then pour other half over topping after it cooks 30 min.)  Cook 45 min. total.

Wonderful!  The only substitution I made was pecans vs walnuts and doubled the cinnamon based on other reviews.  I also lightened it up just a little bit more by using the brown sugar splenda and the domino light sugar.  I also used a hint of lemon juice.  Highly recommend!

Loved the recipe!  HOwever, I guessed on 10 cups of apples.... How many apples is that?   I also think that with a good mix of apples, you can still cut back on the sugar.   I also only used 1/4 cup of butter, and it still came out great!

A keeper, we'll make again. 

We used 4 varieties of apples, sweet to tart, red & green, skin on. Opted for big chunks rather than uniform slices.

Smaller casserole dish, filled to the top with apples, used recommended amount of topping. Based on comments: we mixed apples with flour/spice mix prior to putting in casserole, skipped water, cut sugar to 1/4 cup, replaced white with brown sugar. Doubled cinnamon, added powdered ginger and fresh grated nutmeg (not measured, but at least 1.5 tsp)Added vanilla (might add some bourbon next time) to flour/spice mix, and to butter/oat mix. 

Whole wheat pastry flour, and brown sugar instead of white. Melted butter, but plan to try mixes of butter/olive oil and/or coconut oil in the future. 

Instead of ice cream or whipped topping, we opted for low fat, plain yogurt drizzled on top, may add a trace of honey, molasses or maple syrup next time .. not necessary, but could be a nice addition.

Good recipe! Per other reviews, used brown sugar exclusively, doubled the cinnamon and added only half the water.  Used a food processor for the crumb mixture using cold butter. No melting required! Made this with added craisins and with fresh cranberries for something different. Keeper!

I confess, I’ll always be partial to my Aunt Audrey’s apple crisp, but this was very nice for a change.  We served it warm with vanilla ice cream.  Yum.

This recipe makes a decent (and decently healthy) apple crisp, but I do have a few complaints. The 1/2 cup of water I poured into the dish made the whole thing too wet - however, after a night in the fridge some of it did absorb. Secondly, without any salt or lemon juice I felt that it was a little bit bland. I'd add some of both, next time.

We loved it!  Got a bag of apples at a great price at a local orchard at the end of the season.  Also read all of the reviews and doubled the cinnamon, replaced the butter with coconut oil, and when I noticed that after 45 minutes the dish was still watery, but nice and browned on top, I stirred it all together.  Over, and over again every 10 minutes several times.  Eventually, it came together very moist, and the apples still held their shape. The skins stayed on the apple slices, as well. Next time I'll just stir every twenty minutes starting at about 30 minutes. It was not crisp this way, but not watery either. I will also reduce the sugar, I think it will still be great!

Excellent!  I substituted whole wheat pastry flour. The apple crisp was perfectly sweet despite the fact the apples I used were very tart. My children loved it (and never noticed the walnuts in the crumble). This will be my new "go to" recipe for apple crisp.

I added a fourth of a cup of ground flaxseed in place of 1/4 cup of the flour.  I used whole oats in place of quick oats for more texture.  Hubs doesn't like cinnamon so I grated fresh ginger into the apple mixture which imparted a satisfying flavor.  This recipe has a great ratio/balance of ingredients.

I made this healthier by not putting whipped cream or ice cream on it. It was very good warm, but it was also good at room temp. I added half quick oats and half old fashioned oats. The topping  was crisp. Not dry or soggy like some apple crisps. It looked very much like the apple crisp I had as a child. we had a box of apples to use , and this was a great recipe  to use them.

Could use more regular sugar.  While my apples were not that tart, I would still add more sugar.  I forgot to use the Stevia, so possibly if you use Stevia it may be just fine.

Good for health conscious family, but would recommend using Splenda baking sugar blend vs so much sugar.  . Liked flavor of using 1/2 Honeycrisp 1/2 Granny Smith apples.  Wish it had been a little more flavorful - maybe a splash of vanilla flavoring.  But I would definitely make it again.

Great!  Not too sweet :)  I made a couple changes:

-Didn't add any water because the apples I use release a lot of juice when they're baked anyways
-Increased the crumb for the top x3! I love crumb most haha.
-Added a pinch of kosher salt to balance the flavour a bit.
-put some cinnamon and a tiny bit of brown sugar in the layers of apple
-Brown sugar instead of white sugar!

I made this with Saskatoon berries rather than apples. Left out the water and sprinkled the berries with raw sugar and cinnamon. Doubled the cinnamon in the crust.  It was excellent!

I cut the white sugar back to 1/4 cup and used apple juice in place of the water. I also substituted coconut oil for 1/2 of the butter in the topping. You still get the butter taste. I also added a dash of nutmeg. I will make this as often as I can! Everyone loved it and it was just sweet enough with a really good apple flavor.

I love this recipe.  I too used pecans instead of walnuts...only because they were what I had in the cupboard.  My father in law also said it reminded him of an apple pie his mother used to make.  Keeping this as a favorite.

I really like this recipe! I didn't change anything, except baked it less than 45 minutes because I don't like mushy apples. I also made just half of the recipe because I didn't know how it would turn out. Great with vanilla ice cream on top!

Really nice, but on the whole I guess I just prefer the unhealthier version. I don't like apple peels in baked goods and the nuts in the topping got a little overcooked for my liking (almost a burnt flavor). I did appreciate the reduced sugar, though. The sweetness was perfect for me. As per another reviewer's suggestion, I omitted the water and found the consistency great.

I chose this recipe because it didn't require peeling the apples. My family wouldn't eat it with the peels on.

Great recipe!  I made the substitutions of brown sugar for white, I omitted the water and I used old fashioned oats as recommended in previous reviews.  My family gobbled this up!  They didn't even ask about ice cream for on top!

Absolutely delicious!  I used an apple corer and sectioner, then I cut the sections as thin as I could, so the peeling edges would be very small.  No one knew I didn't peel the apples.

Great recipe! As I was scaling the recipe in half, my computer started acting up, and I believe I added too much sugar. Oh well, I'd cut back on it just a bit anyway. Also, I forgot to add the water (minimal amount), and that was not a problem. I see some reviewers like it better with no water. Had some warm with vanilla ice cream.....yum!

I replaced white sugar with brown sugar, walnut with hazelnut because that's what I had. For oats, I only put 3/4 cup, of oats and put 1/4 cup of coconut flakes instead. I doubled the amount of cinnamon and added pumpkin pie spice mix a little bit. It turned out great! I highly recommend this.

I have been making this recipe for years. It is so delicious and satisfying on a cold winter day! I usually half the recipe, which fits perfectly in an 8 x 8 baking dish. 4-5 apples does the trick. Remember to half the measurements in the directions too, though! I also double the cinnamon, add dash of nutmeg, and sub brown sugar for the white sugar and add about a tablespoon more since brown sugar is less sweet than white. 
The most important thing I want to note is that the water is VERY important in this recipe! The first couple times I did not add water, and let me tell you, the juices of the apples are not enough. The recipe calls for the flour, water, and sugar to form a DELICIOUS caramel sauce  while baking. Do not leave out the water! I've been adding slightly less than the recipe calls for and it has taken my apple crisp from four stars to five stars! All my taste testers agree!!

Delicious. Most thought it was average though, hence the four stars. The maple apple crumble from this site is the best one I've tried so far! Nothing to complain about however, thanks for sharing!

Thanks for the others reviews. I only added about 2 table spoon water to the apples, more cinnamon powder, and a pinch of Chinese 5 spice powder.

Made exactly as written except for reducing the water down to 1/4  cup. It was good, but the topping was rather dry. I think next time I will cut down the flour and oatmeal amounts. The apple filling was amazing!

Wow - this is so much easier and just as tasty. It takes half the time as a traditional Apple Crisp because you do not peel the apples - not that you would ever tell!! I took advice and did not add the water and it was perfect. I used Macintosh apples. I absolutely love walnuts so this is the perfect recipe for us.

I think there was too much topping for the apples as they cooked down.  I would probably half the flour and oatmeal and keep the everything else the same.

We went to an orchard recently and were left with a few too many apples, so I decided to make this recipe to remedy the matter. Well, I have already made it twice because we liked it so much! 
I made a few changes to the original recipe:
I used whole wheat instead of white whole wheat flour,
Substituted half maple syrup and half honey for the brown sugar,
Doubled the baking soda and left out the baking powder,
And left out the nuts. 
Really delicious!

Made it Gluten and Lactose Free and it was fabulous!! The substitutions I made: I used 1 Tbsp coconut flour instead of the whole wheat flour. Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 flour (added a picture) to replace the white whole wheat flour, Bob's Red Milk gluten free quick cooking oats, and Earth Balance original spread in place of the butter. Cooking one dish for two people with Celiac Disease and one with lactose intolerance is challenging. The other picture I added shows how "much" is left.

I thought this was great.  I used white flour instead of whole wheat because I was out, but I don't think it made the flavor worse in any way. I will make it again, and reduce the amount of brown sugar a little, since it was plenty sweet with the yellow delicious apples I had on hand.  I'd also like to reduce the butter like others suggested,but I did not do it this time.

I really liked this! I just peeled and sliced about 10 apples with an apple peeler instead of measuring. It didnt have that tooth hurting sweetness some apple crisps recipes I have tried. The flavors balanced well. I also like the added walnuts. I didnt see salt, but didnt add any as I used salted butter. We ate it warm with whipped cream. ty

This was a hit at a potluck. I used whole wheat flour and didn't add nuts, just to be safe with allergies. My only challenge was that the topping did not "crisp."  It was still quite crumbly.  I will take suggestions for improving!

Had to do something with five giant apples that had been in my fridge for weeks from the CSA. Found this recipe and was able to use four. Not too sweet, good flavor. I think next time I might chop them up thicker so they had a little crunch left in them when done. But overall right on!

Yummy! Healthy and delicious!  I made it for my husband to replace all the chocolate bars that he normally eats, and this is a good replacement!  I used brown sugar and all whole wheat flour.

This has a really great flavor to it, but I used red delicious apples and while it tastes good, the apples basically cooked into mush.
