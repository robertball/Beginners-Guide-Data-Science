This recipe was wonderful - very french gourmet.  I added sliced onion and doubled the recipe.  I did add more sour cream at the end because I thought the wine was overpowering.  Next time I'll make it with a mellow flavored wine.  But it was great on steak!  I'll also slice the mushrooms thicker next time so their flavor and texture doesn't get lost in the sauce.

Very Good!  Used dehyrated portobello mushrooms (re-hydrated), substituted the sour cream for half & half cream and added shallots. Worth doubling the liquids next time to make it more saucy.

Absolutely delicious!  I used 1/4 cup red wine, 1/4 cup soy sauce & 1/4 cup water, then added onions & water chestnuts...I, too, seared steak, then broiled in oven.  Very juicy!  My kids were eating the leftover sauce out of the pan after dinner!  Thank you!

Per other reviewer suggestions, I used 1/3 cup port, 1/3 cup water, and 1 TBSP soy sauce.  This sauce is a keeper!

I had high hopes for this recipe and I was very disappointed. My husband didn't like it either. The color was a real turnoff.

This wasn't my favorite, it was too sweet for my liking.  I've only had port wine in cheese so I am to blame on that issue.  Maybe I'll try it with Merlot.  Thanks any way :)

WOW!  This sauce is great!!  Restaurant quality and totally company-worthy.  Being a mushroom lover, I used a whole 10 oz. package of mushrooms so the steaks were smothered with them.  Delish--but next time I'll double the rest of the recipe to have a generous amount of sauce.  A definite keeper!

This is a fabulous recipe!  I did not have port wine so I substituted 1/3 cup red wine, 1/3 cup soy sauce and 1/3 cup water for the port wine.  Besides that I followed the recipe as written.  I served a grilled pork tenderloin and spoon the extra sauce over both the tenderloin and mushrooms.  Everyone loved it.

This was a yummy sauce for our a good cut of steak. I was looking at the Master Chef TV show and liked the idea of searing the steak in the pan to get the beef drippings and then finally cooking the steak in the oven. I find it makes the steaks really juicy. Great Recipe!

Absolutely delicious.  Served over marinated steak, but I bet it would make a good salisbury steak or base for beef pot pie.

I followed the directions of another reviewer and switched out the port with a 3-3-3 mix of red (Cahors in my case) soy and water. FAn-ta-bu-lous, loved by all. I'm confident it'll be good with port too, when I have some on hand. Thank you!

I liked this..but the second time I made it I used Merlot instead of Port to cut the sweetness.... It was much better.
