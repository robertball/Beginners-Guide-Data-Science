I used a refrigerated pie crust and just eyeballed the amount of blueberries.  I also substituted Splenda for the sugar.  It came out great.  We enjoyed it with vanilla ice cream.  I did only have to bake it for about 45 minutes until it was golden.  I will probably make it again since it was so quick and easy to put together using the pre-made crust.

I cannot recommend this recipe. The blueberries did not stay in the crust when I rolled it and everything spilled out. For ease I rolled it on a cookie sheet. The dough rolled out fine, it was a little dry (and that was after adding extra water)but the blueberries would not stay in! I had to mold it with my hands. The end result looked like a pie that had fallen on the floor. Bland tasting too. Thanks anyway.

I'll tell you why I loved this recipe: for starters, my granny used to make these. Yes, the insides are supposed to spill out. I usually scoop it on top of it and serve with homemade whipped cream or ice cream. It's a PIG, sloppy & messy! I've taken these to farmers markets with rave reviews. People love them! Try cutting back on the filling if ya'll are worried about the prettiness. Country cookin is all about simplicity. Don't make this harder than it has to be. Good job!

Rather than using store bought pie crust, I used crescent roll dough.  It was great.  I had crescents filled with blueberry goodness and everyone loved them!

I made a massive mess out of this, and my berries leaked out and burned. My piggie family managed to eat most of it anyway, but I don't think I will attempt again.

As another reviewer pointed out, this does look like a pie that's been dropped on the floor. But it is tasty nonetheless! I used strawberries rather than blueberries, plus a dash of lemon zest.  I was worried about the strawberries making it too runny, so I mixed the berries, zest and sugar, then let it sit in a bowl for 30 min. I drained off the excess fluid, spread it onto the crust, then made my husband roll it up for me. I read the reviews saying it was hard to roll so I wasn't taking any chances. It rolled up very nicely. Mine baked for about 40 min, and I served it with vanilla ice cream. Yum! Will definitely be making this oozing splat of goodness again.

So Yummy! Used a fork and pressed edges while rolling and did no leak. Also sprinkled some sugar on top. Going to make again for sure...except try with cherry or applel

What a great idea - rolled up pie! For some reason my kids didn't like it but I think most kids would. I tried it with the milk and sugar when it was warm and that was good but it was much better the next day cold. I will make this again.

This is a wonderful alternative to making a pie!!!  Even easier with pre-packaged pie crust mix!

Easy and fun.  I split the recipe in half to make one pig, and could only roll up about 1 1/2 cups of fresh blueberries.  I think one pig would serve 4 people, especially if you serve each piece with a scoop of ice cream.  I thought the crust was a little flavorless, but my husband really liked the "blueberry hog".

I love the idea, but what a mess! The berries kept rolling out when I tried to roll the crust. Delicious anyway! I'll try again--maybe with a little more patience next time.

Like others, I have to say what a great idea -- I may have to try it with other fruits, too!!
I made it this time with another pie crust recipe from this site--"Earthquake Pie Crust" --  made the whole process so SIMPLE!  A great dessert to whip up in the afternoon while a roast or some else is in the crockpot already -- complete meal with little effort.  Give your family the impression that you are a real Suzy Homemaker!!

I made this and a blueberry cobbler to use up a bunch of blueberries.  It did the trick in terms of using up lots of blueberries but the pastry wasn't that great, I would use a different pastry next time and add some vanilla icing to the top.

This recipe was.....okay. I took the advice of another user and used the pre-made dough -- this could have been why i didn't like it so much.  It was an easy idea, but the blueberries gave me issues....again, if I had used regular dough, might have been easier. The taste was good though....like a blueberry pie!! Only 3 stars....but I'll try it again, and use my own pie crust and give another review!

This recipe was easy and ingenious!  Yes, a little tricky to roll, and mine un-seamed during baking (I think that I could have done that better on my end).  I ate mine at room temp, once it had set a bit and was easier to eat.  Perfect with some ice cream!

I only had half the blueberries, so I used that and a can of tart cherry pie filling. The blueberries didn't fit into the first one (it was my first try with making pie dough, so maybe not thin enough?), so I wrapped 1 cup of blueberries in each dough and put the can of cherries on the bottom. My family loved it! Thanks, AKAJA!

So haven’t tasted it yet, but it totally fell apart in the oven, with the filling all over the cookie sheet. Having guests tonight, going to get something else.

I also used frozen ready made pie crust and I put a crust of turbinado on top .  Wasn't bad and I did use more sugar than directed.  I will use lemon zest and maybe some arrowroot or corn starch to thicken the juice.

I made 2 of these- turned out delicious! Mine hardly leaked out at all. I used my defrosted frozen blueberries from the garden this summer. I also used a little cornstarch in my sugar,cinnamon mix after reading the reviews (to prevent leaking) This is the second time I made these and no massive mess. The recipe for this crust is the same one I use for blueberry pies:)

I made my own crust, since I was making pies, anyway. Maybe I rolled it too thin, because they burst open during cooking, it didn't make a lot of sauce, it was just solid berries sitting on an open crust, but it tasted nice.

Family liked this a lot. I used purchase pie dough, however, so it was easier to roll, stretch, etc.  If I make again, I may spread a layer of sweetened ricotta first, then overlay the blueberries.
