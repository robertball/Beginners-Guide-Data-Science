This was delicious! However, they were a lot of work. I agree that the dough was difficult to work with. I had to break it up into even smaller pieces before rolling it out (about half of what they recommended.) The trick is also to err on the side of thicker. The dough should not be transparent when you put it in the oven, especially the layer with the hole because they break easily when they come off the cookie sheet. Don't overbake! Also, it is very important that you cut out the hole after transferring the dough circle to the cookie sheet. I used a white-wine glass to cut the circles, but if you're going to do that, please be very very careful and don't break it! It was a great size though. I used little star- and flower-shaped cookie cutters for the holes, they were so cute, and helped distinguish between strawberry and raspberry jam, respectively. These cookies were a huge hit. I'll definitely be making them again.

Okay, first of all, this dough was a nightmare to work with. It was too prone to crumbling to make a good cookie cutter dough. Secondly, there was not enough peanut butter flavor; it was too floury. However, they turned out looking GORGEOUS! I used star and heart shaped cookie cutters for the windows, and they ended up so pretty. I'll make these again, but definitely tweak the dough recipe.
