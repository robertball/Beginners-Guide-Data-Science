Fabulous dressing that definitely adds a kick to traditional balsamic vinaigrette!  I used 1/4 c. balsamic and dried minced onion vs. shallot.  It was perfect over mixed greens and fresh ripe tomatoes. Update: I've made this a couple times now and added a dash of chili powder and if you like this a little sweeter try adding a pinch or two of sugar.

Very yummy dressing!  Had to leave out the shallot as I didn't have any, so used some dried onion instead.  Used very good quality balsamic and altered my oil to vinegar ratio to be more equal as we prefer them that way!  Excellent, will make again.

Really great.  It's 100 degrees in Los Angeles today and I've got nothing in the house.  I decide to make a pasta salad with canned tuna, frozen peas, a  mixture of 4 Italian grated cheeses and now I want I want an interesting vinigrette because I'm out of bottled dressing.  I chose this one and it was outstanding. Couldn't be happier!!!

I added red wine vinegar instead of balsamic, since that was all I had on hand.  I also didn't add the shallot.  It was a little too oily for me, but still flavorful.

Perfect for my tuna & bean salad. I used a little more mustard then called for (about 1-2 tsps.- I used Dijonnaise since that is what I had) and regular onion since I didn't have any shallots. First taste was delicious, can't wait to try it after its sat in the fridge for a bit. I would reduce the olive oil a tad next time though.

Pretty good dressing, but I did even out the olive oil and vinegar.  I made them each 1/4 cup.  It was tasty!

This dressing is WONDERFUL ! I had a salad made, did not realize I was out of dressing, so I jumped on this site,  and it saved the day yet again. I also used onion power since I did not have a shallot.

Very good.  The only changes I made were out of necessity becasue of lack of ingredients. I didn't have shallots and didn't wants a strong onion flavor by using fresh onion so I used about a 1/4 tsp of onion powder and my dijon mustar was garlic and pepper chardonnay digon.  After letting it set for awhile I poured it on a spinach and carrot salad.  It was  really yummy!

This is a very good dressing.  The sweetness of the balsamic and the kick of the red pepper are nice with almost any mixed salad.

This is a very good recipe, but the flavor here really depends on how you use it. I used it as a dip and it was spicy, piquant with balsamic and mustard flavor. I had leftovers and used the vinaigrette as a salad dressing. The flavor was completely another, the vinaigrette lost its spiceness in the salad and the flavor was mild with some sweeteness. But we loved it as well.

We enjoyed this. I used less oil and the "regular" balsamic and it was very brown, unlike the photo. I don't mind but some don't like the "look" it gives some dishes so I wanted to mention it.

My husband liked this vinaigrette but still prefers the Raspberry Balsamic Vinaigrette on this site better.  He rates it a 3.  I don't eat salad so I have to go with that.  I had fun making this, though!

Made this tonight with a few alterations, and it turned out delicious! I didn’t have a shallot so I used a few thin slices of sweet yellow onion. I also used yellow mustard as I didn’t have Dijon. Also added a small shot of honey. This was just what I wanted to serve with my stuffed poblano peppers and garden salad...:excellent!

This version is excellent! I used this on a chicken salad I made from scratch with avocado, sweet grape tomatoes, and sauteed mushrooms w/ green onions. I only added salt & pepper to the mushrooms when I cooked them, so the chicken was bland. This dressing made the salad taste so savory! I think this would taste great as a drizzle to chicken breast too for an entree!

Love blasamic and loved this dressing.  Wouldn't change a thing.  It was the perfect quantity for a salad for 5 adults.
