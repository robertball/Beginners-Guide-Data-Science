The only reason I give 4 stars is because they were a little gooey. After a day or so in the fridge they firmed up a bit. I think next time I will add more Rice Krispeys and let the balls sit in the fridge for several hours. The chocolate didn't cover well, but I think that may be because the balls didn't set long enough in the fridge. I will try again, they were very yummy after a day in the fridge!

This is a great recipe. I would recommend that you mix your butter, peanut butter, and Vanilla extract in a bowl first. Then, add your powdered sugar. Once that is all mixed together, then add your rice crispy cereal and mix.

Very good buckeye recipe. I substituted Ghiradelli melting wafers for the chocolate chips and shortening. This allowed me to melt the chocolate in the microwave and gave the finished candy that extra something special you get with a little higher quality chocolate.

great recipe came out perfect.  I did chill the balls for a few hours and they were plenty firm.

This is how my mom has always made them, and the recipe she shared with me.  I usually make them up one night after work and then freeze them (covered) until I have time to dip them.  They're always a favorite at the holidays.

I love crispy and I love peanut butter and I love these crispy candies!  I made a couple of changes for convenience. First I pulsed  the cereal in the food processor (so the balls would keep their shape) and used 2 c instead of one because I didn't want to refrigerate therm as long and I liked the texture. Then,  I did such an ugly job with the dipping I wound up dipping the whole thing then tossing them in more pulverized cereal to make them look nice while cutting the richness of the chocolate just a bit. I'll try coconut next time.  Anyway,  they look different,  but its the same recipe! I'll test them out at Christmas and revise my review with the results!

This isn't my first time making these. I have made these many times with and without rice krispys.  My family is just happy I make them!
