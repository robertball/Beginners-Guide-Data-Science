I followed the recipe, and it was not pleasing AT ALL. i would've been better of with some strawberries on top of the angel food cake with some whipped topping on the top. Im not sure maybe i did somethign wrong, but i followed the recipe!

I've made this recipe several times over the years...It's a good dessert for a summer BBQ.
