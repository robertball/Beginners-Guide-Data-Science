Delish!  I added about 2 teaspoons of corn syrup with the milk butter & chocolate to make the icing hard and glossy.  That way the cookies don't stick together.

I followed the instructions as written and the consistency was too runny. I added some cornstarch and it is a little thicker but not to where I would like it to be. Otherwise the taste is good.
