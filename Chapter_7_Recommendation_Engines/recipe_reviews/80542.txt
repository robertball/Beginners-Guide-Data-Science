I was going to rate this four starts at first, but after having seconds that had been sitting for 1/2 hour I changed my mind.  If you have time to let the flavors blend a bit more it's definitely worth it.  We're not huge salmon fans here - it's one of those foods we eat because it's good for you, so any salmon recipe we find where my family says "Hey, this is actually pretty good." gets five stars and is a must-try for salmon lovers.  The only addition we made was a can of mandarin oranges with about half the juice - it definitely helped stifle the "fishy" taste even more, and it wasn't bad even before.

Excellent! This could be a main course or a side dish to a holiday meal.  I used canned smoked salmon.  I even left the peas out.  Hardly any preparation time and packed with protein, omega 3's, and vitamins.

A delightful addition to my Easter traditional meal.  This salad was the hit of the dinner  Excellent taste, hint of lemon, yummy salmon taste and enjoyable way to introduce asparagus.  Just the right mix.  Highly recommend for any occasion.

I made this on Good Friday for a luncheon date with an old friend.  She doesn't love fish but ate every bite of this recipe.  While shopping I forgot the pecans, and ended up using walnuts which I toasted and they were excellent (anyway probaby better for you since higher in Omega-3s).  I found the mustard a little tart so I added 1T of sugar to make it a litter sweeter.  Next time I might try a honey-musard for the dressing.  Will definitely make again.

This salad was awesome, making it tonight for the second time. Since I'm not a fan of smoked foods, I grilled fresh salmon and added a little bit of tomato and onions. My husband couldn't get enough- and it's easy to prepare. YUMMY

I made this recipe tonight and it was great!
couldn't find any red lettuce at my grocery store, so I used a salad mix, and snow peas instead of frozen peas.
Also, a splash of balsamic vinegar to the dressing adds a great tanginess.

Great flavour combinations, and the toasted pecans were a wonderful addition.

easy and tasty!

This was good, the dressing needs more spice, I added 1/4 tea. dried dill after tasting original. I followed others suggestions and add mandarin oranges. Next time I will cube up goat cheese and add. I didn't have pecans so I used blanched almonds which I toasted.  The asparagus does not need 5 min. it only takes about 3 min. so it is still crunchy.

I made this for my family for supper last night and modified it only slightly by using snow peas (as my hubby doesn't care for regular green peas). We all agreed it was wonderful and my hubby actually said it was the best salad he has ever eaten !!

I had lunch guests the day after Thanksgiving, so I was looking for something light.  I used the Baked Salmon II recipe, rather than smoked salmon.  This reciepe was a hit!

Yummy! I was a bit skeptical because I felt that the salad needed more color...it looks all green except the salmon of course. And I did change several things to use what I had on hand. I used 1 head of romaine and a bag of fresh spinach, and walnuts. I was happy with the results! I will be making this again...

This is a fantastic salad with very healthy ingredients.  I use baby spinach instead of red leaf lettuce, and toast the pecans.  I will make this again and again!

This was light and delightful. I am diabetic and this fit perfect into my diet and very enjoyable. I used this for the whole meal and it worked great. Salmon is so good for you and fresh asparagus was a wonderful pairing with the fresh squeezed lemon.  I used bagged spring salad mix and used the whole bag for two people. Nice healthy recipe.

One of my favorite recipes on here ever!  I seriously wanted to lick my bowl.  Used baby spinach, replaced the pecans with crushed macadamia nuts that I toasted (all I had available) and didn't have the peas available.  Next time I'll add the peas, as I think they'd add a nice sweetness to balance.  YUM!

Great salad!  It wasn't as good as it could have been because I didn't cook the salmon completely (but that was my fault - not deducting for my stupidity).  The only qualm I had with this recipe was the salt content in the dressing.  Made it a bit to salty - maybe next time just a pinch, and it needs some kind of cheese.  We used crumbled feta, it worked fantastic.

i would let the ingredients marinate for a little while and then add the lettuce at the end. I substituted two cans of wild alaskan salmon instead of the smoked and used romain instead of red leaf. I think next time I am going to use red onion to give it some color, but other than that its a very good recipe.

This salad was a hit at my mothers birthday party. I added balsamic vinegar to the dressing mix and left out the garlic. Also, used spring mix instead of red leaf lettuce. Everyone wanted seconds...and it was only a side dish!

My husband and I absolutely love this salad!  I changed the vinaigrette by adding more sugar, and more lemon.  I have substituted cashews, pistachios, I have also substituted romaine lettuce for the red leaf and it has been just as tasty each time.

I thought the combination of ingredients was very tastey however, the dressing left much to be desired.  I would definately make this again but use a different dressing.

Mmmmmmmmmm boy!
It's a keeper and so quick.  Everybody loved it and it's great just as prescribed.
After a 2 to 1 vote, the peas were omitted and not particularly missed.  And I couldn't resist the urge to add a smidge of Tennessee mountain sourwood honey in the dressing.  Something else we tried, sprinkle some cranberries or Craisins on it.

I followed the recipe and I'm sorry to say the dressing was way too strong--I would cut out half the lemon juice and salt; then perhaps it wouldn't be so overpowering. I think it would have been a great salad had the dressing been lighter in flavor (and don't get me wrong--I like salty, flavorful, rich foods!)

This is a very good combination of flavors and textures, and it's easy to prepare. The pecans and peas add sweetness and crunch, providing a nice contrast to the salmon. I didn't love the dressing, however; I thought the lemon was overpowering. Next time, I'll increase the mustard and reduce the lemon.

Added some red onion and grape tomatoes.  Wonderful!  Reduced the oil but doubled everything else in the dressing and it was wonderful for a main dish salad!

This salad made a perfect light and flavorful meal; paired with a crisp pinot grigio, it was a refreshing spot in the midst of the normal holiday heavy-hitters.  No changes needed.  Bravo!

Great salad recipe!  The asparagus and salmon go so well together.  I used what I had on hand - baked salmon rather than smoked and spinach as the base.  Just flake the salmon into small chunks and toss with other ingredients.  Got rave reviews.  I love the dressing too and am adding it to my regular use quick file!

This makes a great summer meal. I had it with the Parmesan Corn Chowder from this site and they went really well together. The dressing is pretty zesty, so I recommend going light on it to avoid overpowering the smoked salmon.

I used high quality smoked salmon from Alaska and thought it was wonderful.  I am going to add a little more dressing as it was a bit dry.  I had leftovers for breakfast with goddess dressing. Thanks for a great recipe for that leftover smoked salmon!

Delicious, healthy, satisfying....what more could you ask for?!? I like a little more bite to my salads, so I added some sliced red onion, cut the olive oil to 2 1/2 Tbsp. and replaced it with an additional Tbsp. of lemon juice and an extra tsp. of Dijon--SO GOOD! This will be on regular rotation in my house!

Textures are not pleasing.  Salmon is rather flaccid while asparagus is crisp/tender and lettuce is crisp.  Flavors don't go together well.  I won't be making it again.

I thought the salmon or asparagus would stand out but nothing did. I stir-fried the asparagus in a bit of the dressing for more flavor. We felt this salad was very ordinary.

This was tasty, I felt due to modifications that I made based on personal preferences.  I seasoned the salmon with lemon pepper and citrus pepper before placing it on the grill.  I also used romaine and radicchio lettuce b/c that is what I had on hand.  For the dressing, I thought the dijon mustard overpowered the taste of the dressing mixture, so I added a 2 tbsp. or so of honey mustard and a tbsp. more of lemon juice (to give it the consistency of dressing), and that really helped make the dressing tasty with a tinge of sweetness to it.  Good recipe overall.

I left out the pecans, peas, salt, and cut down on the olive oil. I added broccoli (cooked w/ the asparagus) and green onions. I used honey mustard instead of dijon (but I think it would be better w/ what it is called for). I made the veggie/meat mixture and coated w/ the dressing and let it chill for a while, then used it to top fresh spinach. Good, light dinner!

We love smoked salmon but often have leftovers since there is only two of us.  This is a perfect spring/ early summer salad!  I used fresh leaf lettuce/mesclun from our garden, snow peas (would have preferred green peas but didn't have any), and freh asparagus.  My husband thought it needed a bit of sugar but I loved it without.  A definite "keeper"!  Next time I might try mandarin oranges as others have suggested.

Doubled the Salmon and added some Parmesan but other than that, stuck to the recipe. great flavor, nothing overpowers anything else, nice fatty, salty Salmon complements the other flavors. I'll probably double the Pecans next time just for some extra crunch.

This recipe was inspiringly delicious.  I skipped the peas and added fine slices of red onion, capers (mini) and for the dressing I used a half of lime, one teaspoon of Dijon mustard, one teaspoon of blue agave nectar and olive oil.  Delicious!

This is one of my daughter's favorite salad, and I enjoy it as well! She makes it for us now so that's an added bonus! We use the hot smoked salmon because of it's firmness and like every salad, throw in whatever veg from the good old fridge that needs to be eaten!

My family loved it!!  Made a few changes based on the reviews.  I used Romaine lettuce and spinach to replace the red lettuce.  I also added red onion, (3) avocados, and waited to put the lettuce/spinach in until the last minute to forgo the soggy lettuce as many others experienced.  I will definitely make it again.

Used leftover herbed baked salmon from last night's dinner in it rather than smoked salmon. Soooo good. Will definitely be making again-thanks!

Excellent! 5 stars as written or with substitutions. So easy to make with what you have on hand. The last time I used mixed greens instead of red leaf lettuce, sugar snap peas instead of frozen. I also added a few Craisins and some Mandarin oranges. The dressing is perfect for this salad. The  lemon juice is good, or the last time I made it I substituted the lemon juice with white balsamic vinegar and just a tad of juice from the Mandarin oranges. I used 8 ounces of salmon and made large main meal salads. Hubby was VERY happy. Thank you, MommyBennett, for sharing your recipe.

This was a hit! I admit I changed a few things (no nuts added, mixed greens instead of red leaf, I cooked a salmon filet instead of using smoked salmon and used an Orange Basil Vinaigrette (from this site) instead of Lemon vinaigrette). I think that just shows it is a wonderful recipe that can be modified to taste or items on hand. I will make this again and again! Thanks for sharing!
