I posted this recipe last year and just realized I wasn't specific enough that you must use REAL maple syrup.  Don't try and make this with Mrs. Butterworth's - that's a disaster waiting to happen!

Hi.. Thanks for a great simple recipe... just a few ingredients and a nice taste... I used some pure maple I had from my pre-low carb days... fresh garlic, some fresh ground multi-variety (green, red, black) pepper I use on eggs and a good quality season salt I get in Milwaukee... the only change I made was to use the season salt on the meat, not in the sauce... I was also afraid of caramelizing, so I grilled the meat 5 minutes a side before adding the sauce, then finished another 5 on a side... but because of the pure maple nothing turned black... nobody guessed the "secret" ingredient (the maple syrup) and everyone loved it...

There's lots of great ways to prepare a steak.  However, this is one recipe where you can decide last minute that you feel like a steak tonight without being concerned that you haven't had it in the fridge in your favorite marinade for most of the day.  The ingredients are common enough that you're bound to always have them on hand.  The maple syrup and the simple spices blend nicely for a steak that has more than just that pure beef flavour.  So next time you're looking for a quick way to prepare a slab of juicy beef, try this recipe.

I made this recipe one night when I was making steak and happened to have the ingredients on hand. I wasn't sure about maple syrup with steak but it makes an unbelievably great steak! I have made this recipe numerous times now and would highly recommend this recipe!

Fantastic!  Loved this recipe!  The flavor was great: sweet and smokey.  My only change, I doubled the garlic (Oh, how I adore Garlic!).  

However, please realize that if you use this moist rub immediately after placing the steak on the grill, you cannot cook the steak past medium rare -- or medium, but that is pushing it.  Remember, sugar burns easily.  If you like a well done steak, DO NOT brush this on the steak until it is medium/medium well.  Your results will be superior.

The maple syrup is a bit of a twist on the ol' beeferoo.  It crystalized and added a sweet-but-not-too-sweet taste to the meat.  I added rosemary to the rub for taste, and its flavor and aroma added that little extra that the dish needed.

OMG this was so easy and everyone loved it. It is the norm for our summer grilling now. Works on everything! Beef, Chicken, Pork, Salmon... It all tastes great! Add Mongolian Fire Oil to give some heat if you like it hot. Steller!

I used this for a fathers day cookout (how fitting). I got great results from it. I applied it before grilling and liberally while cooking and the taste was fantastic. The sugars in the syrup made a great crust on the outside and the added flavors really enhanced the flavor of the sirloin steaks that I made.

A few notes:
Fresh ground black pepper is so accessible nowadays, and it really does make a difference in recipes like this, so do your self a favor and use it here.

BUT, I have great faith in dried herbs and spices, if utilized properly. So I replaced fresh garlic cloves with garlic powder. I find that crushed or minced garlic cloves rarely add enough flavor to make any difference in grilling, and are just a hassle to apply effectively in recipes like this. Garlic powder integrates flavor into the sauce very easily, and there's no problems with evenness or application. Sure the flavor isn't of "Fresh" garlic, but the most important flavor is the steak anyway. (Garlic salt works well too, just be sure to omit some of the "seasoned salt" as well)

Also, with this sauce, there's no such thing as too much. Only so much sauce is going stay on the meat as it is, and while it's cooking the sauce tends to roll off the meat anyway, so keep the steak well coated. I promise you that it's hard to over-do it.

Wonderful! I couldn't detect much sweetness (I used real maple syrup) & the flavor was great. The rub adhered very well & the outside of the steak caramelized slightly...we got some great grill marks. I didn't measure anything but teh syrup & I topped each staek w/ a pat of butter after removing it from the grill. My grandson "yummed" all the way through dinner...thanks!

This recipe was amazing!  The combination of sweet & spicy was just right for the pallette.  I used italian seasoning instead of allspice, but the taste was still great.  I will probably cut back on the pepper next time, because it was a bit too spicy .

We made this exactly as called for in the recipe, but really didn't like the taste.  It was very sweet and we used very expensive steaks for the recipe, so my wife and I were disappointed.  If you want a sweet steak it would be good.

My husband LOVED this rub. He said it was quite possibly the best tasting piece of meat he's ever put in his mouth. We used it on flank steak and marinated it for 24 hours. Yum!

Be sure to use real maple syrup. And to kick it up a notch, instead of black pepper, use something a little spicier like habanero powder.

What a pleasant surprise this recipe turned out to be! Of course I didn't read the directions carefully and, instead of drizzling the steaks with the syrup first, I simply mixed all the ingredients in a bowl and rubbed that on the steaks. Still came out delicious! I added red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick but the rub would have been fabulous without it. I'm not a huge steak person but this recipe's a keeper in my book!

This steak was SO much better than I had imagined! The great reviews forced me into it LOL. I didn't really measure any thing- I just drizzled the syrup, rubbed it on both sides, then followed by sprinkling the seasoned salt, pepper and crushed garlicand rubbed that in on both sides. Someone suggested that you should not use pancake syrup, but that's what I used and it still came out great(although next time I will try to get the real thing!)

I'm not a steak person and this really "beefed" up the taste. Nice flavor, tho it was a little strong. i think i will go lighter on the pepper next time. really really good tho.

Very nice rub...No change made to recipe. Only thing, I didn't have access to a BBQ (-15C), so I used the oven. Came out perfectly - tender, med-rare. Heat oven to 350F. On stove, a cast iron frying pan heated on high. Steaks seared both sides for 1.5-2 min, (each side). Then pan and all into the oven for aprox 5 min.

I did not care for this on steak. I used it on sirloin and it was just wrong.  However, it's really good on chicken and pork so I gave it a 3 instead of a 1.

I changed the amounts a bit to meet my own tastes, but in general I liked the concept. I never would of thought to use maple syrup for a steak, but it works.

This was great! I let it sit for about 20/30 minutes to marinate. I used montreal steak seasoning and added salt. Very good, I will be using this again!

My kids really loved this. It is simple and the flavors are subtle, but it brought out the flavors of the meat exactly the way they wanted. They have already announced they want steak cooked this way again, which is pretty unusual.

This is a quick way to create a rub for steak. I thought it was pretty good, as did my girlfriend. I think I would decrease the salt next time and increase the syrup. I bought 2 top sirloin steaks, probably around 1.5 pounds each. I don't really know what is meant by 4 steaks. Should probably be more specific.

This is good for a quick rub.  It will only work on a good cut of meat.  I tried it on porterhouse and it was fabulous.  I tried it on a cheaper cut of meat and it was not so good.

I'm not a great cook...but this recipe was super simple and totally knocked it out of the park. My family thought I had taken a cooking class. The two notes (that I picked up from other people that were helpful) were (1) add some rosemary (if you like that taste). (2) Grill the steaks, then marinade, then grill again otherwise the marinade will carmelize. Hands down the best thing I've made...although that's a pretty low bar.

I didn't have any maple syrup around, so I subbed in clover honey.  Still came out totally delicious!

This was tasty and easy. I hate having to prepare marinades in advance, so this gets bonus points for being a quick rub that can be thrown together last minute. I didn't have fresh garlic on hand, so I used about half the amount in garlic powder instead. I would cut down a bit on pepper next time, as it was just a little too strong.

Very easy and tasty. I didn't have real maple syrup so I did half imitation and half honey. I cooked the steaks on a George Foreman grill and it didn't burn at all.

Easy, delicious marinade that has become a staple at our house.  You MUST use real maple syrup - if you try to alter the recipe by using pancake syrup, your meat will burn.  I use this as a marinade - stab the steaks with a fork a few times and the flavor will flow right through.  Perfect for grilling all kinds of steaks.  The result is a tender, succulent morsel that almost melts in your mouth.

On our grill, 7 minutes per side was way too long. After about 5 minutes on the first side the steaks caught fire--likely from the maple syrup. They were black on that side. I'll try again with either a shorter grilling time or a not-so-hot grill.

So simple and so VERRRRRY GOOD!  My only tip, which has nothing to do with the recipe itself, but my grilling technique: I usually like my steaks super-seared on the outside (like burnt!) and medium rare on the inside. For this recipe, try not to go overboard with the searing.  A normal amount of searing is okay, but it's much better if you don't go overboard with it--that way, you'll be able to better taste this delicious, flavorful rub.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

This is very good - I love all of the black pepper in it. I used the marinade on flat iron steak and cooked them on the Foreman grill. The syrup gets a little burny on the grill, so beware if you aren't using nonstick. Thanks for the recipe!

We tried this last night and turned out really good. My husband really liked the sweetness from the maple syrup. Didn't have real garlic so used garlic powder. This was only change. Would recommend and will use again.

This is amazing. Very delicious steak with a little sweetness but definitely the flavor of the beef is accented. Do use pure maple syrup. I mixed all the stuff together and then spooned it over the steaks, I used this on some NY strips and T'bones. I did take the time to grind some fresh pepper for this. Very very good! I had to make my hubby's without the maple syrup because he doesn't like meat with anything sweet. The rest of us liked ours fine with everything.

I have to say for such a simple recipe that this really is great!  The syrup makes the seasonings stick and lightly carmelizes the meat.  Personally we will never make steak again without the Maple Syrup first.

Made this last night and it was REALLY good. We used 100% maple syrup and garlic powder (1/2 Tbls.) since I didn't have fresh. Next time I'll cut back a little on the pepper- it was a bit too much for my little ones- and we'll use more syrup cause we LOVED the flavor. It was great to find a recipe to liven up our steaks without marinating. We'll definanetly (sp?) make this one again.

I thought this looked intriguing, so I tried it.  I felt it called for way too much pepper, though, so I halved it. (I'm not a pepper person)  It was very good!

Never thought I'd do this but if this is a five star recipe then I am  a five star chef. I wanted to try something new and simple to sorta expand my view of things and taste. I chose this ! my bad !................sorry to say but even Garlic salt and fresh ground black pepper works better than this.  Needs some brown sugar,soy sauce,maybe ground ginger and some balsamic vinegar to give it some ooomph . I'm eating this mistake as I write this because I wanted to be fair in my critique. Not for me .

This recipe was fabulous!  And so easy to make since these are ingredients that I always keep around the kitchen. The whole family loved it and I'm looking forward to making it again.

This was not a great combination of flavours for me.  I did not really like the sweetness with the beef.  Prefer the combination with pork more so.

YUMMY!!!! I followed the recipe exactly; used NY strip steaks with pure organic maple syrup  & a home-made seasoning salt (King's seasoning salt, available on here :) I mixed the salt, pepper and garlic together in a bowl before rubbing them on the steak. Paired our delicious, juicy steaks with sweet potato fries and a ranch salad; less than an hour from fridge to table and very minimal effort for a restaraunt quality meal! This was fantastic, very simple & will definitely be using this again soon!! Thanks!

I made this exactly by the recipe.  It was pretty good, but not to die for..  I was worried that the maple syrup would make it too sweet, but it didn't.  The flavors complimented themselves.  It's just not that exciting.

My hubby loved this steak (my young kids said it was "spicy").  I didn't have real maple syrup so I did use the 'fake' kind with a little added honey and cooked it on a grill pan.  It came out delicious.  My hubby said it was the best steak I've cooked!  Thanks!!

Loved this rub.  We used it on a large sirloin steak and it was wonderful.  The only substitution I used was Cajun French Fry Seasoning Salt for the seasoned salt.  It punched up the heat a notch.  Let the rub sit on the steak for about an hour and then drizzled the maple syrup on right before putting the steak on the grill.  Couldn't detect very much of the maple but it did have a sweeter taste to it.  Next time, we'll drizzle the syrup before adding the rub and then letting it sit.  Either way this one is going in as a keeper.  Thanks Catherine and Dad!

On the first try, this became our favorite for all marinades, rubs, etc!!  For something so simple that requires no marinating time, it ia INCREDIBLE!  Better than some we've had to wait HOURS for maximum taste...

My husband and oldest daughter thought this was a 5. My younger daughter thought it needed something else, but couldn't specify what. It is easy and perfect for those times you don't have the opportunity to marinate. Thanks!

This rub was pretty good. Took my steaks a little longer to cook (I don't know why, but it was good none the less. I did add a little steak sauce to the rub as well and it gave it a more steak flavor as well. All together...pretty good.

I loved this. Hubby didn't detect the flavors. I agree, it was light and we wanted a little more. Maybe marinating longer next time will make a difference?
Was good though but so is olive oil, salt, pepper.

I thought it was a little bland, slightly sweet... I was looking for more of a salt and pepper contrast. We couldn't even taste any garlic.

I wanted an easy dinner because I was to tired to cook tonight.  I had some small steaks out and tried this rub.  I didn't measure anything but just spread it on and sprinkled the spices.  I used garlic salt instead of garlic and added a little paprika.  It came out amazing!  I loved it and would use it again.  I also just used pancake syrup because that's all I had but next time will try pure maple to see if there is any difference.

Excellent. However, I reduced the pepper to 1/2 tablespoon and thought it was enough for our tastes. Used "Old Bay" as the seasoned salt. Loved the hint of maple and not having to marinate the steaks before grilling them. Will definitely be using this recipe again!

My husband and kids loved this steak recipe, and it was very easy to throw together.  I, personally, wasn't crazy about the sweetness of the syrup with the steak, but since the majority of my family commented on how much they liked it, I'm giving it four stars.  If you prefer your steak a bit zippier, I'd suggested adding other seasonings or leaving out the syrup.

This was pretty good! Little too much pepper, (I'll cut it in half or more next time) but that's a personal taste. Thanks for the recipe!

Good.  I might like it a little more salty or spicy next time.

I used this rub on NY strip steaks and it was really good. I will use this again. This is a keeper.

Didn't know if we would like this with maple syrup, but it was actually pretty good.  The syrup really helped hold on the seasonings making for a pretty tasty steak.  Thanks OP for the great seasoning.

Great steak rub, gives a lot of flavor without having to marinate the meat.  A perfect blend of a tiny bit of sweet and some spicy.

I loved this recipe.  I used it on pork chops instead of steaks.  I normally do not enjoy reheated pork chops but with this rub the flavor was still great.  Fresh, ground pepper really added a lot of flavor.  The recipe was so simple.
