This is wonderful!!!  I love the taste combination and it plates very well.
I do HATE the beets but love the greens.  So I purchased six beets with the greens at the grocery store and planted them in a large flower pot. I now harvest the greens,  LOTS of greens and they're always coming up!!

This was fabulously tasty.  I made the recipe as written, however I only had enough beet leaves for 12 little rolls.  I think there would be enough leaves for all the filling if I had 2 bunches of beets (8 beets).  This recipe was labor intensive but the end result was great.  I served it with white rice and baked beet quarters in the sauce

Great recipe! Reminds me of the stuffed cabbage my grandmother used to make. Followed the directions exactly and served with rice and beets.

This rating is based on changes I made, so take it with a grain of salt. The changes I made were to use all bison instead of beef/pork, bouillon cube instead of chicken broth, and whole milk instead of cream. Bouillon cubes are generally saltier than broth. I should have reduced the salt in the meat mix, but I didn't, so mine came out too salty. Otherwise, it was pretty darn good and I'll make it again.

Some things about the recipe that confused me: the leaves on bottom and top? The leaves are pretty small relative to the pan size and didn't seem to do anything? Was I missing something? It didn't say to cover the dish, so I didn't. However, the broth only covered the rolls half way, and the top half of the rolls were crispy and dry, with the bottom half boiled. Made the texture really odd. Next time, I'll cover it. I used the leaves off three beet roots. I am not sure how many leaves I had, but I doubt it was 36. Even with less leaves, I still ran out of filling and had to make more filling.

Update: Made again, using low sodium broth and covering the pan with aluminum foil during baking. Texture was good. In the future, I'll reduce salt in meat and use regular sodium broth.

Update 2: We regularly get beets with greens in our CSA box, and I make this every time. Once I was short on time. Instead of rolling the filling into the leaves, I tore up the leaves into small pieces, threw them in the bottom of the pan, put the meat mix on top, added the broth, covered and threw it i
