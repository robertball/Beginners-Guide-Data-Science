Made these yesterday for our Bills/Patriots tailgate. I prepared the tails ahead of time, adding a little lime juice and butter as they cooked in the shell, and then did the reheat adding the Herdez sauce, tomato & green onion on site. Also used a double layer of toasted corn tortillas since the filling was a bit saucy. Delish! And fast.

We really liked this as a change of pace. I bought lobster already cooked and did not reheat the meat as I didn't want it to dry out. Even so, these were good.

Really delicious.  Found small lobster tails on sale so I splurged on a couple. This comes together very quickly . The guajillo  sauce is my very favorite of the Herdez sauces so I was happy to see this recipe. I used corn tortillas. I am going to try this with some fake lobster next time as that is a little more in my price range
