Very delicious pancakes. The recipe is right on as far as quantity and execution. Quinoa and pumpkin are a nice combination of flavors. I topped them with whipped cream and maple syrup, yum!!

These were better than I expected and my family loved them!
I made a few changes. I used 3/4 cup plain flour and 1 cup almond flour.  I added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar (since almond flour is so bland) and added about 3/4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice. The eggs were extra large and I used a few more tablespoons of buttermilk since the batter is so thick. I think any oil would work and I used melted coconut oil. These will appear almost burned when done because of how dark the batter is when fried. They take more than twice as long to cook on a medium hot griddle as regular pancakes, as I cooked them side by side. These were lucious with real maple syrup and whipped cream. Itâ€™s a keeper
