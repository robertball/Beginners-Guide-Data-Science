This is a wonderful recipe & so simple. I used my food processor. Just mix the egg & milk together in one bowl & put the dry ingredients in the processor bowl. Put the top on,turn on the processor & slowly pour the wet ingredients through the food chute. In just seconds, it will form a ball. Stop the processor immediately & VOILA that's all there is to it! Just have to roll it out. Thanks for the recipe.

I have made these for years.  I don't use the baking powder and I roll them as thin as I can.  The broth is what really makes them good.  I just use some cans of chicken broth and add a few bullion cubes to it to make it stronger.  Everyone loves it and I am asked to make it a lot.  To keep from making a big mess you can roll it out onto some floured wax paper and toss the wax paper flour and all when you're done.

My family loves it when I make these noodles for my chicken noodle soup.  I have made these several times with baking powder, w/o baking powder, rolled thin, rolled thick, dried out , not dried out.  Personally like to add the baking powder it makes them a bit more airy, I also like them rolled  thicker, & they don't need to be dried out at all.  I make them & in to the pot they go,very quick & easy.  These noodles are also great the next day as they sit over night in the soup they don't get mushy.  Yummy comfort food!

Good recipe but should definitely double amount for a family of 4.  To make sure noodles aren't tough, do not knead. Kneading this at all will make a rubbery, tough noodles.  Mix the dough until ingredients are just combined.  I mix all the ingredients in a KitchenAid mixer then rolled it out by hand. To minimize overworking the dough, mix all the wet ingredients first before adding to the flour. I then divided the dough ball into two halves (4 sections if doubling the recipe) and wrapped in plastic to let it sit for about 20 min to let the gluten relax. This will make rolling easier and prevent shrinking. I then cut the pasta with a pizza cutter and immediately cooked them.  No need to wait 2 hrs. Also, I found 1/4 tsp of baking powder was plenty to give the pasta some airiness.  Freezes well too, just make sure to flour cut noodles well before freezing.  A great simple recipe.  4 stars for lack of directions, 5 stars for recipe itself.

I use an extra large egg and 1 1/2 cups of flour-no baking powder/Ukrainian recipe ( I am Ukrainian) I have been using for many years.
I boil my noodles separately in salted/oiled water. The flour in the noodles would make the soup too starchy therefore cook noodles separately el dente.
I fry pieces of chicken in spices, steam carrots separately and add green onions and finely chopped celery and then add all to the chicken.
I drain the noodles and add some to each bowl and pour soup over the noodles.  If noodles are left in the soup, they would get too soft.

Once noodles are ready,

I, too, didn't realize how easy it is to make your own noodles!  The only suggestion I have is to make sure you flour the surface that you are rolling them out on, otherwise the dough can be a little sticky.  They do nearly double in size once you boil them.  I boiled them for 5 minutes in a pot of water with one chicken stock cube, drained them, and then added the noodles to my homemade chicken noodle soup that was boiling for the last 5 minutes.  I did not use the baking powder.  I will definitely make these again!  Thanks for this easy, yet delicious, noodle recipe!

I was surprised how little work it took to make noodles, especially since I used my stand mixer and dough hook to mix the dough. Using a pizza cutter makes cutting the dough into strips quick and easy. Great addition to homemade chicken noodle soup! This is a keeper.

Great comfort food.  Follow directions and there is no way to mess these up. I boil a whole chicken with onion, celery, bay leaf,salt and pepper corns covered in water. Strain broth and remove chicken from bone.  Cook noodles in broth then add chicken at the last minute.  YUM!

these came out a bit dense, not quite what i was looking for but still very good. I think i'm going to play around with these a bit next time. I did not use the baking powder. EDIT: These are my favorite noodles! They turned out to be exactly what I was looking for after sitting in the soup overnight in the fridge and were perfect when I defrosted some soup I had frozen. I've made them a dozen times now and this is the easiest way I've found: I make these in my food processor, I combine all the dry ingredients and pulse in the wet ones until combined and dough forms into a ball that pulls away from the sides and then roll out the dough. Keep in mind that these to grow when cooked so roll them out thinner than you think you need to and cut them smaller than the size you desire. Oh if making for a group of 4 or more you're going to want to double the recipe or triple it if making a large batch of soup to freeze. I now make extras because they're the favorite part of the soup in our house. Try this recipe, it's a keeper!

I like the fact that this recipe has much better directions than the Grandmas Noodles 1 recipe did! Very easy to make and taste great in soups or as a side.

I love homemade noodles and these are easy and taste fantastic. The only thing I don't do is dry the noodles- not necessary. I throw them in a bowl, sprinkle in a little flour, so everyone gets coated a little and chuck them into  boiling chicken stock (with shredded chicken already in it) and cook just until the noodles are done and the broth thickens up. I love chicken and noodles over mashed potatoes. Yes, it's heavy on the starch, but boy, is it ever good (Midwest-style) eating. My mom used to fix it that way when I was a little girl and I'm proud to carry on the tradition.

My mother used this recipe, and its been passed down three generations.  Personally, I think the baking powder is key.  I usually triple the recipe, use some that day, then freeze the rest.  To freeze, flour the noodles really well, lay them flat on a cookie sheet, then pop them in the freezer.  When frozen, I put the noodles and the extra flour in a ziplock bag and return to freezer.  They are good to go whenever you need them.  The extra flour acts as a thickening agent when you cook them in broth.

I enjoyed the fact that I made my own noodles...never did I imagine doing this.  As I was reading the reviews, I noticed people saying how fast and easy these were - they didn't seem so fast to me.  The drying for 2 hours part really slowed down my process.  If I'm going to use them in a pot of soup, do I still need to let them dry?  I told my husband to not dismiss them becaues it was my first shot, so we're going to perfect this and have the best darn homemade noodles!!!!  I will use this recipe again :-)

I wasn't very impressed with these, now a days, it's hard to come across recipes (at lest on the internet) where you don't need nifty and highly expensive tools or gadgets to do your prep work for you. I just found out that unless you use a blendeder, this recipe doesn't mix right. I was looking for something a little more old fashioned where you can make a flour and dry ingrediant mountain with a little pool at the top with your eggs and wet ingrediants to go into and mix all together, but I found this to be too much flour. I was afraid ,because I couldn't test try these, of adding another egg or too much milk.

I prepared the recipe by hand with a couple of changes.  I did not let the dough stand after rolling it out (mainly because I forgot to).  Also, I only let the noodles sit for about 10 minutes before adding to my chicken stock.  This is definitely a keeper and will be added to the weekly rotation.  A note of caution to everyone, the noodles do increase in size so roll them thinner than you want them and cut them smaller than you want the finished size to be.  Really enjoyed this recipe and thank you for sharing.

I love these noodles. I've made them twice now and I've used the baking powder each time (I like my noodles big and hearty). I followed another reviewer's suggestion to use my food processor and the dough only took minutes to make. I let them dry for 20 minutes, but after that just put them straight into my soup and they turned out wonderfully. The size of this recipe is perfect for a single batch of soup. Today I was craving them again and just boiled them in chicken broth and had noodles and broth for lunch. I added a little garlic powder to the dough this time and it was a tasty change, but they are still wonderful as the recipe is written.

Excellent recipe, with simple ingredients and methods that anyone can pull off! It is also very versatile; I actually used this to make a sort of pizza-dumpling creation when I was close to moving and had little in the way of food in the house; just cut circles from the dough, plopped on some spare pizza sauce and shredded mozzarella, then boiled it briefly and voila, midnight munchies cured;)

Mine came out ugly as sin (nothing like the photos shown), but they were chewy and delicious.  This recipe is a keeper!  EDIT: Second time, I rolled them paper thin, and when it was time to cut, I lightly floured the top and folded the dough over on itself, slicing off long, even strips.  The kidlet even helped out.  Easy breezy - whole pot of egg noodles for $.25 and a half hour's labor.

I've used the same recipe for years but it always seemed that they were the right consistency the day after they were cooked in any left overs.  However these made a perfect noodle for soup on the day I made them.  I rolled them thin (1/8"), and threw them into the soup about 20 minutes before serving.  They were amazing!  I will not use another recipe - ever.

It is amazing how baking powder makes all the difference in the world - I would NOT omit it unless you want a more al dente textured noodle today, and left overs with a "soup texture" noodle the next.  

Perfection.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

So easy! I was scared to try this but am so glad that I did! My mother-in-law rolls these to cut them, but that didn't work out for me. A pizza cutter worked wonders, very easy to get nice uniform noodles. She also has given them to me frozen and sys that they will last in the freezer for a very long time!

I liked this simple recipe but made the following changes.  Since it said baking powder optional, when I doubled the recipe I only used half as much baking powder.  I also cooked in broth almost instantly after running it through my noodle press.

I have to give this 5 stars...it took some getting used to, my first time making pasta. I made a creamy/meditarranean/chicken mixture and fold the cooked pasta in. Topped with cheese and into a warm oven (just so the cheese melts) and sprinkled the top with dried parsely. DH was VERY impressed. I didn't mention that i made the pasta from scratch, but i got stopped during the meal and asked, "where did u buy this pasta? It's amazing."....Enough said :)

I can't believe I made homemade noodles. It was so easy and made an inexpensive meal when I added cooked chicken, a little carrot and peas.

I have made homemade noodles for many years and my recipe is very similar to this one.  However, a really easy way to cut them is:  After rolling your dough out thinly, roll it into a roll and cut across at intervals as wide as you want your noodles to be.  Then just pick up the outside end of each noodle and drop them into your soup.  Much easier and faster than cutting each one individually.

Was a fantastic addition to my homemade chicken soup last nigth. They were perfect!!! Super easy to make, my 7 year old did most of the work! Only thing I would do differently would be to double the recipe, didn't have quite enough for the likes of my family. We love our noodles!!!

Great addition to my homemade chicken noodle soup.  So much better then the box noodles---could not have been easier to make.  I didn't bother to let them dry out, they worked fine.

Wonderful flavor and texture. I used them for my homemade alfredo (just low-fat cream cheese and enough milk to create the perfect consistancy, creamed together and heated, some times I add a touch of nutmeg) and I don't think I can use dry store bought noodles for it ever again! Now thats comfort food. I did double the recipe for 4 entree size portions.

Wow! I can't say enough about how easy this was! Having never used a rolling pin to deal with dough, I was pretty intimidated but even if my noodles were various shapes and widths, they dried out great. I boiled a couple chicken breasts, chopped them up, dumped in a can of condensed cream of chicken soup, some shredded carrot and the noodles and voila. It turned out excellent. Thanks!

exactly like the grandma's noodles from the grocery store, and super easy/cheap! the only advice i have is to cut the noodles pretty thin because that expand so much after cooking!

I've tried several Noodles recipes. So far this one is the best! I used all the ingredients, including the baking powder & mix it my mixer, then cut it with the pasta attachment. I didn't dry the noodles, but boiled them right away. They were so good. This one is definitely a keeper. Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first time making noodles, they turned out great!! I omitted the baking powder, followed the directions to a T and VIOLA delicious noodles!!  Oh, and the dough was really easy to work with, just make sure you use plenty of flour so it won't stick.

Made them without baking soda for chicken soup.  Simple to make, though my Kitchenaid dough hook did not reach low enough in the bowl, so I used my hands.

A WINNER!  Great texture. Noodle lovers: double the recipe. Didn't use baking powder.  Didn't let dry, cooked right away. For more flavor, cook in salted water.

I made these today to add to homemade turkey/veggie soup. They were really, really good. I cut back on the salt, but think I will use the full amount next time. I did not add baking powder. I rolled them really thin (on parchment)and cut narrow. Can't wait to try them for chicken 'n dumplins. Trust me, they are very, very good. Followed the recipe as directed (except for the salt). They are surprisingly easy and I know what is going into them!! A definite 5+.

Easy and tasty.  Just add broth. I couldn't roll my dough out thin enough, so just cut thinner slices to make up for the width.  Very flexible and easy recipe.

These were the best noodles ever for chicken noodle soup. I like my noodles big so I cut them a little wide but then they almost tripled in size so they were huge, (I added the baking powder) but they were amazing. I was a little worried at 1st because I boiled them in a sauce pan with some of the broth from my chicken in the crockpot for about 10 min and they were a little tough and firmer than what I wanted, but after boiling them for 10 min I added them to my crock pot mixture and left it alone for about 20 min and they turned out perfect and soft. Amazing and way easier than I thought, I'll never make chicken noodle soup without homeade noodles again. Thanks!

The dough is very sticky and I had a tough time cutting it (forget getting uniform shapes and sizes) but didn't find this too difficult so I will use again.

I really wish they had half star option because to me its really more like a 4 1/2 stars. I needed to add extra milk (almost 1/4 cup) to get the dough to get like its suppose to. I rolled the noodles out thin and i left out the baking powder. They took awhile longer to cook then what i thought but They turned out well. I just wished i had something to compare it too. My two year old loved the noodles in his soup and they looked exactly as pictured.

These turned out great and were so easy to make!  My husband asked that I make 'homemade' noodles with my chicken soup and I thought - no way, that'd be too hard.  But it was a snap, and much tastier than storebought noodles.  Thanks for the recipe!!

As a dad doing the cooking they are so easy. I have people that ask me to make these noodles for all kind of occasions. I add 1/3 cup of melted butter to this recipe. Getting ready now to make more. My son loves to help !!

These were very good!  I added the baking powder but didn't let the rolled noodles dry.  Added to chicken broth and it was excellent.  Next time I'll make a double batch.

Having to wait two hours is tough, but the noodles were delicious. This is not four servings. Double it! Also, make sure that you roll it thin before cutting. Very delicious. I could not believe how easy!

Who knew that making noodles could be so easy and so YUMMY! Made these in like 5 minutes and added them to a homemade "no chicken" noodle soup. My three year old could not get enough and to be honest, neither could I!! :)

Super easy.  I thought with such a little amount of dough it wouldn't be enough for my soup but went with it anyway.  I used the baking powder and rolled them out to the point that I thought they might be too thin.  I cooked them seperately due to some of the excess flour from rolling them out and I am glad I did.  These puffed up as soon as they hit the boiling water!  I should have cut them thinner and they would have been perfect (I cut them a little thicker not thinking they would almost triple in size!).  Easiest recipe I for noodles I made so far.  I made the dough first and then let it sit while starting the soup base and cutting my carrots and celery.  I rolled them out and cooked them seperately and they were ready right on time.  Thank you.

First time noodle making, it was very simple and quick.  I had to add just a touch of water to make the dough stick.  I boiled them for 10 minutes then simmered them for another 15 to make them tender as I like my fat noodles softer.  All in all a good experience and I will be making them again.

Great, easy recipe for homemade noodles. Followed it exactly including the baking powder. Took others suggestion for using the food processor- worked beautifully! I made chicken noodle soup like most others. Will definitely use this again maybe for something other than soup. Thanks for posting this recipe!

OMG these noodles turned out great!!!! I will make them again.  They were easy to make,light, and taste great.  The only thing I had to do was add a little more flour as I was making the dough since it was a little sticky, other than that I followed the recipe as stated but doubled the amount. Try this one out a definate keeper!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks

I had trouble getting it to form into two balls, the dough didn't want to stick together that good but I added a little water, I don't know what I did wrong but they still turned out good, and I used the pizza cutter as one of the other suggestions, worked great. I will try it again some day. thanks

I use this recipe every time I make chicken soup.  They are very good, just be sure the soup is boiling or nearly there before you drop them in.  They were just the right consistency, and remind me of the noodles my grandma used to make.

This is easier than I'd anticipated!  So versitile too!  I have made then 3 times in the past 2 weeks, and anticipate getting more use of them in the future!  Really good in those comfort soups for the winter!

Excellent noodles.  I followed suggestions from others.  Doubled the recipe, divided into 4 balls, wrapped in plastic wrap for 1/2 hour.  Rolled out with flour, cut, let sit for 1 hour tossing every 15 minutes.  Made the best chicken noodle soup ever!!

These were very easy to make and tasted very good.  My only problem was the serving size.  We had 5 of us (3 adults and 2 children), so I doubled the recipe.  We ran out of noodles.  I would definately recommended doubling or tripling the recipe.

Great tasting noodle.  To speed up the proces: after rolling out the dough I loosley rolled the dough onto the rolling pin. I then slid the pin out of the dough and using a sharp knife, cut noodles off the roll.

mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm Good!  LOVE this recipe.  This was the first time I ever made homemade noodles and I made this one and a spinach noodle also from All Recipes and I couldn't be happier.  Fresh, homemade noodles that taste better than ANY store-bought and really are not that difficult to make.  I used a rolling pin and a lot of muscle but my noodles were so worth it.

This recipe is like the one I have been using for years with the exception of the baking powder.  When rolling the dough I make sure my surface is well coated with flour. I then flip the dough over multiple times while rolling to coat both sides with the flour. This helps make rolling easier as well as makes the dough more workable and not as sticky. When making soup there really is no need to dry them for two hours. I make my noodles, then prepare my soup base, cut the noodles with a pizza cutter and toss them in my soup and cook until al dente! Delicious.

Loved these! I added a big TBS of melted butter to the dough. 1/2 t salt does not make these too salty.  This recipe is perfect! Its Just extra good with some added butter.

I made this as a first time noodle maker and they were a BIG HIT!! I had cooked venison cut for stew meat in the crockpot all day till really tender then cooked the noodles, then made a gravy from the juice off the meat and there wasn't any left my boys and husband have requested the noodles be made weekly if not more. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe with all of us!!!

These are beautiful noodles. I'm deleting the rest of the egg noodle recipes from my recipe box! Easy to make and easy to work with. I made them exactly as recommended only I used my Kitchen Aid mixer with a dough hook, mixing the flour/baking powder mixture in slowly and let it run until a nice ball formed and was smoothly kneaded. I then used a pasta machine to cut it into noodles. I ran small balls of dough through the flat lasagna roller at #1, #2, #3, and finally at #4 thickness. Then I ran the sheet through the fetuccine-sized roller. I only dried them for about 40 minutes then added them to my chicken soup. They're thick but manage to maintain a lightness that I like. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I read a few of the reviews before I tried this recipe, It is a thick noodle and that is just what I was looking for. I added the baking powder just to make sure. I trippled the recipe and added an extra egg, one of the reviews said if you didn't use a mixer or food processor they would be too dry, the extra egg did the trick, they were just right. After letting them dry for 2 hours I added them directly to the crock pot (on high) and let them cook for 30 minutes. I used these for beef and noodles. It's a new favorite in my house. This was also the first time I have ever tried to make my own noodles, easy and the ingredients are staples in my home. This recipe will be added to my collection!!! They were perfect!!!

I did not care for this recipe.  The instructions did not say how thin to roll the dough - I rolled as thin as I could get it and cooked for 10 mins as the recipe states.  The noodles were not cooked, and were hard in the middle.  It was easy to make, but didnt taste or turn out very good.

AWESOME, easy recipe.  I put all the ingredients in my bread machine and within minutes the dough was in a perfect ball and ready to roll out.  Make sure you at least double the recipe.  I tripled it for 4 people and hate to admit that we only had a small bowl left.  I cooked them in the broth from a roast and then put the shredded roast in with the noodles.  Served over mashed potatoes.  Great dinner.  My 1 1/2 and 5 year old even helped roll out the noodles.  Make these...you won't be sorry!

These are great! I added the baking powder although next time I think I will omit it. The thick noodles took longer to cook and some of them were still doughy. But still a great recipe.....Thank you!

These were very easy to make.  Dough held together well and rolled out easily. I used my manual pasta machine to roll out and cut noodles.  Very tasty.  I used these in chicken soup.

This recipe was very easy and tasty. My family loves it and we have used it several times in homemade soup. I have even shaped it rather than just roll it and cut strips. My whole family likes it, even my very picky daughter.

These were great.  Easy, quick and just like the noodles in the soup at our local German restaurant!  So tasty and simple that it will be hard to use pre-made dries egg noodles again.

Best noodle recipe I have ever used. My family loved it.  I have now used it in chicken soup, beefNnoodles, and vegitable stock. They are softer than some of the other recipes I've tried. (All I had handy also was self rising flour, so that may have affected them.)

I usually buy homemade amish noodles in Shipshewana, or pay $3.49 at the local store for something similar.  No need to do that now that I have discovered how easy it is to do it myself.  And how much cheaper it is!  Not to mention, my family was really impressed that I made them myself.  I suggest that you at least doulble the recipe if you are making beef, or chicken and noodles.  If you are going to the time to make it yourself, don't cut yourself short!  Well worth the time and effort!

I would give this recipe 4.5 stars! Super easy and they were delicious.  I didn't know this was so easy! I followed 2 other reviewers suggestions and used only 1/4 tsp of baking powder. I didn't wait for them to dry, but I did allow them to rest for 20 minutes. Then I cooked the noodles in a separate pot of boiling salted water for ten minutes before adding to my soup; then low simmered in the soup pot for another 15 minutes .

Also, I decided to use 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of white flour and it turned out great! (I don't usually like whole wheat pasta).

This is a nice decent recipe. I doubled it for my family of four to serve with chicken paprikash. I used the dough hook in my Kitchenaid to mix it, but found I needed to add another tablespoon of milk. Against my husband's urging, I used the old rolling pin and pizza cutter for these; he really wanted me to use the Kitchenaid's pasta attachment. Maybe next time. I didn't do the two hour dry time either, just dropped in a pot of water with some salt and chicken bouillon.

Great recipe.  Very easy. Turned out perfect.I used my pasta machine and the baking powder. Delish. Next time I will only add the baking powder when using these with chicken and noodles and will omit for things like Alfredo etc.

Doubled the recipe, but kept the baking power the same.  I will make again but I want an noodle attachment for my mixer. Lol. Roll the dough out as thin as you can. Took longer than 10 minutes for my noodles to be done.  I let the soup sit for another 15 minutes and the noodles were perfect.

Great recipe! Other reviewers really helped out. I rolled the dough out as thin as possible and did not allow the noodles to dry for the two hour period. I just plopped them in the soup for ten minutes and chowed down! I will use this recipe again and again!

These were AMAZING in my chicken noodle soup.  I folllowed the recipe except I did not wait/rest/dry them at all.  I  made the dough, then rolled and cut into noodles in one swoop.  They were still perfect!

Got a pasta maker for my Birthday. First recipe I used was Grandmas noodle II. This will be the one I use from now on unless I get into flavored noodles. But then again maybe I could use this recipe to add flavors too!

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner for my family - tasted just like my grandma used to make!  I cooked them in chicken broth until most of the broth was soaked into the noodles.  My family loves them piled on top of mashed potatoes.

So sorry. I'm about to tell you all the changes I made. Fair warning to all you who hate us recipe tweakers. I tripled this recipe for 7 people. I did 2 medium eggs, 4 medium egg yolks, and 2 small glugs of olive oil (maybe 2 T). No milk. It ended up extra tough, so I added maybe 1/4 - 1/3 cup water. It was SO lovely. The noodles had so much rich flavor from the egg yolks, and I loved how the noodles puffed up from the baking powder. Thanks for the basic recipe to give me the confidence to try making my own noodles for the first time. We LOVED them. BTW, we just served them tossed with butter and salt and pepper, so we could really taste the flavor.

These are great.  I used to use homemade dumplings (small) and packaged kuluski noodles to go with my homemade chicken soup but these surpass both.  I did use my pasta maker which made them simple to make.

One of the best noodle recipes I have tried. The accompanying video is excellent. 

My noodles turned out very well, but I prefer them a bit "eggier".

This is the first time I made noodles from scratch and it won't be the last.  I didn't know how easy they were to make.  We all loved them!

I make these to go in chicken noodle soup. I have a friend going through chemo, and my home made soup with these noodles is the only thing she can keep down. I used the baking powder, mixed the eggs and milk in a bowl, put the dry ingredients in my mixer, mixed dry together, then added the wet slowly and mixed with my Kitchenaid paddle attachment. I cut them with a pizza cutter. They taste like a cross between a really yummy thicker egg noodle, and an old fashioned German dumpling. They do grow, so roll as thin as you can, and cut them smaller than you'd like them.

We have made these for years it tastes so good in homemade chicken soup. When we get sick in the house with colds in the winter we make chicken soup it warms up nice as leftovers. We like the noodles thick so it is a great recipe. We boil them in a separate pot and them add them to the soup, tates great with the soup.

I mixed this by hand and found that it was way too dry. Added more milk in order to form a dough. Tasty noodles, but proportion might be a little off?

Made these today and was blown away how great tasting they were! Easy but double or triple the recipe as your family will want their chicken noodle soup loaded w these fantastic noodles! :) Thank you for the recipe! I also boiled the noodles separately for exactly 10 minutes then added them to the completed chicken noodle soup. That worked awesome.

Instead of using chicken, I used turkey then I made gravy out of the turkey broth, with some homemade mashed potatoes. Yum

I haven't made this yet but it looks authentic, without the optional baking powder.  Add the baking powder and they rise and become biscuits, not  noodles.  Make them larger and they become dumplings, which are actually large noodles in sauce/gravy.   I will try this recipe (sans the baking powder).

I made this exactly as shown in the recipe. I mixed the ingredients in my Kitchenaid just out of laziness. I used a manual pasta roller to roll the dough to the "4" setting, then ran it thru the fettuccine cutters. The noodles came out perfect. Not too thick, not too chewy, and they didn't become soggy in the leftover chicken noodle soup. 10/10, will make again!

Overall, this worked pretty well for me. It was quick and simple to throw together. Unlike other posters, I had no issues getting everything together by hand without any machinery. It readily formed a ball and then I kneaded for a few minutes, rolled it, and done. I did have to add an extra tbsp of milk to get a noodle consistency on the dough. It came together fine without it, but it was a bit dry. To be fair though I think that's more a function of dry winter months than the recipe itself.

I wish I could get these a little thinner.  I actually had to keep adding liquid so that I could get these to stick together.  Then I kneaded until the liquid was incorporated.  It probably took one more tablespoon (I used water).  I strongly suggest boiling in salted water before adding to your soup.  They have a great flavor.  Reminds me of my polish Grandma!

Made 4 batches of these noodles for chicken soup.  Very easy and delicious.  I added a little more milk  as my dough was a little dry. That may be because  my eggs didn’t have enough liquid. The noodles got better the longer they stayed in the soup. Never mushy - a great texture - just fantastic!

I think I need some advice with this recipe. No matter how many times I try this with the listed ingredients, I can’t get the dough to come together.  I’ve tried mixing by hand, in the stand mixer and food processor. To avoid over-working the dough, I always end up adding more liquid. While they still taste great, that makes cutting the softer noodles more difficult. What could I be doing wrong?! I’m not a novice cook or baker but I struggle with this one!

I made it in my Kitchenaid and everybody loved it.  My noodles were comically huge (because I got carried away with the baking powder). But they were still yummy.  I doubled the recipe  mixed salt, pepper and the baking powder in with the flour and then instead of milk I used condensed milk because that's what I had on hand. I didn't have any flour left over to roll them out with. So I used Bisquick I had on hand. They turned out great!

So delicious and takes me back to my childhood memories of Mom making noodles and drying them over a broom handle balanced over the back of two chairs. Made them for the Chicken and Spaetzle soup. Left out the Spaetzle dumplings and used these instead. Makes the perfect amount.

This is a great basic noodle recipe that you can place in any soup - I like to use it in chicken soup instead of using egg noodles that get mushy after a while.  I like to cut the noodles really thick so they are still firm after a couple of days in the fridge.  They are approximately the size and shape of I love cooking ahead and having leftovers for busy days!

They turn out great! I use a noodle press and I roll them out first as thin as possible. No baking powder. Second time using this recipe and they are awesome. So much better than crunchy store bought noodles. Worth the work!

I love how easy it was. I didn't realize that the recipe says to let the noodles dry for 2 hours. I put the noodles in front of a fan for about 15 min. Then threw them in my soup to boil for 10 min. I made more noodles and just threw them in to boil for 10 min. They were both good a little different texture. 
I used Baking soda... It made the noodles bubble up. YUMMY. My kiddos loved it.

This is the first time I have made homemade noodles.  This recipe was easy and they turned out great. I didn't use the baking powder. This is definitely a favorite and will make them often!!

I have made homemade chicken and noodles for years.  They have become our families traditional Christmas since my children were little and now I make them for my grandchildren.  After all the work leading up to Christmas this simple meal is one we all love and it is so much easier on the cook than a fancy dinner.  I added the baking powder this year and was very happy with the result.  Sometimes my noodles were a little tough but the baking powder lightened them up.  I always make several batches for my family as one is never enough.

I was fairly confused by the consistency of the dough initially. I mixed the flour and baking powder, combined everything else in a different bowl, then gradually added the dry ingredients to the wet. What I ended up with was so wet that it wasn't even slightly ready to be rolled. I ended having to add quite a lot more flour before I had a workable ball of dough. At that point the rolling, cutting, waiting, (shorter) drying, and cooking all went fairly easily. The problem was the flavor was definitely much more noticeably floury and the egg gets kinda lost.

I tried two batches, got the same results. Based on reading other reviews, I feel like I must be doing something wrong. It seems like the majority of people had a good ball of dough with very little work. I ended up with a puddle of dough.

Gonna try it again, but next time I'm going to cut the milk down to 2 tsp and see what happens.

Perfect! I added Italian seasoning and tripled the recipe. I used a third of them for a casarole and I froze the rest. No need for drying before cooking or freezing. Excellent recipe!

These noodles were a fairly simple recipe and they tasted great! I had to quadruple the recipe to make as much as i needed but it worked well. Only special item i had to use was sifter. A mixer could be useful but uneeded if you don't mind getting your hands dirty

Fantastic!! I had never made noodles before in my life and these turned out amazing.  I am definitely going to continue to make my own noodles from now on.  I made them to put in turkey soup after Thanksgiving.  So easy,  and so delicious.

I cook these in homemade chicken stock made from a whole fat hen, onion, celery, carrots, a bay leaf, salt, pepper and water to cover. Strain it and cook the noodles in this rich and delicious broth. I add three or so cans of cream of chicken soup to help to thicken the broth in the final minutes of cooking. I make six batches of these tender and delicious noodles for about thirty people for Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner. We have lots of food but the noodles are everyone's favorite.

Did they say it would be easy? It was. Did they say it would be delicious? Probably. Did they say I would make it again and again? No, but I did and will. There is nothing like a chicken soup with big chewy golden noodles. Don’t  be afraid. It really is easy.

I followed the recipe without the baking powder.  1st time making homemade noodles and this was easy and good.  The recipe makes a small batch so for soup I would double it.  Rolled out between 2 sheets of was paper.

I disagree with some of the reviews saying you need a bunch of tools to make the noodles properly. I made them with all the ingredients and my bare-hands to mix it all together. They came out great and puffed up when I added them to my soup. The taste nice too!

I don't get the person that said you need fancy kitchen equipment to make these noodles.  I have no fancy kitchen equipment and make these by hand in an ordinary mixing bowl, roll them out, and cut them by hand.   Love this easy recipe.  My 2nd time making them and they turned out perfect both times.  This will always be my go to noodle recipe.   Turned out perfect in my home made chicken noodle soup.  I got rave reviews!

I use this every time I make beef and noodles, chicken n noodles, chicken dumplings. it's great! I leave the dough a little thicker for dumplings and I add pepper and sage for extra flavor. The recipe is easy to modify for your family size! Thanks for allowing myself and others to enjoy this!

These noodles were awesome and super easy to make. The noodles came out light and fluffy. I did increase the baking powder to a heaping teaspoon but that was the only change I made to the recipe. This recipe is now my favorite  go to noodle recipe. Thank you so much for sharing.

I love these noodles, I of course have to double/triple everything because I'm cookongvfor a family of 6 but these are great & easy! I make them by hand I did not use any processor, mixer, ect simply because I don't own them. I think it takes the love out lol. But anyways these are great noodles ??

Turns out I'm a bit of disaster when it comes to making noodles but what I ended up with was delicious! Maybe double the recipe - I wished I had more. As for tricks and tips, read others' reviews and/or watch the video. As for me... I need to hone my skills... off to make another batch... :)

First time pasta-maker here. No fancy tools, just a rolling pin, a food processor, and a large kitchen knife. EASY recipe and VERY tasty. Made the Eggplant Bolognese to go with it. *NOTES* I tried a few different flour combos and with/without baking powder. Did not care for the semolina but may experiment a lower percentage, as I read somewhere that if you're planning to freeze the pasta, adding semolina is best to maintain the integrity of the pasta. Also, the baking powder (optional ingredient) lightens the dough *slightly*, making the cooked product slightly less rubbery. Both ways are EXCELLENT.

Excellent meaty noodles for chicken noodle soup! I opted to leave the baking soda out so they would be more dense. Also used food processor like other reviewer which worked well on pulse just until it comes together into one ball. Won't be disappointed.

I made this with all-purpose Gluten-free baking flour by Bob's Red Mill.  I made two batches, using the food processor, as one reviewer suggested.  I followed the recipe for the first batch, except using 1/2 the salt & baking powder.  It seemed VERY dry & barely held together.  For the 2nd batch I added 1 T of milk, keeping the rest the same.  Still a bit dry, but more cohesive.  Both cooked up well & were indistinguishable form each other in the end.  They were a hit!  I am sure I will be making them again soon  :)

GREAT RECIPE!! I made the recipe just as it is written. After rolling out dough, I cut the dough into 1/2" squares, put them in hot chicken broth simmering on the stove, and let the square noodles cook for 10 mins. Will definitely make these again!!

Next time I am sure it will rate higher.  But as this was the first try, I did not read about how much flour you need on the surface for rolling out the dough.  After 20 minutes sitting on the floured waxed paper, the dough stuck badly and I could hardly get it off to try and roll again.  Then, when they finally cooked they got way too thick,  Need to emphasize to roll very, very thin.  Mine were still raw in the middle after 15 minutes of cooking and didn't even bend like a noodle. Some of the little, thin pieces were great.  So next time will be better I am sure.

Very simple recipe.  Just put ingredients I bowl & used my hands to mix well, make into a dough.   Pretty hard to mess up.  I also doubled the recipe.

This is an excellent recipe for homemade noodles.  Since the 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder was optional, I just used 1/4 teaspoon.  I don't believe I ever used any before.  These are so quick and easy to make, and the taste and texture is wonderful,  why ever eat the dried kind again.

I cheated and used a pasta machine because I made these while watching tv and only had the coffee table as a workplace.  The dough was a bit hard to work with, but after a few spins through the pasta machine, it was silky and beautiful.  The taste was great and it complemented my chicken noodle soup fantastically.  They were even better the second day after the noodles absorbed some of the broth.  Yum!

Easy and sooo good. Used them for a pot of chicken noodle soup. Even with making 3 batches of the noodles for it there were no leftovers between just 4 of us. Will make this over and over.

Loved this recipe!  The noodles were firmer then my husbands homemade noodles, which I loved because I didn't feel like I was eating soggy dough!  Now I will use this in my homemade soups instead, so thank you for this recipe.

Tastes just like my grandmothers.  We cut them thick and dropped them directly into the beef broth mixture and they plumped up just like noodle dumplings! Served them over mashed potatoes and they were delightful! Will definitely be using this one again!! YUMM!

This was a great recipe that I used in my hamburger stew. The noodles made it a very hardy soup indeed. :)

I had never made homemade noodles before, but I decided to give it a shot. These noodles turned out terrific. I will definitely make them again. My mother always made the frozen noodles, and my dad was always perfectly happy with them. However, he grew up eating homemade noodles, and he was sure reminiscing about them while we ate. They are definitely going to be on our menu again next year!

Easier than I ever imagined.  Use plenty of flour when rolling these out. Delish in my homemade chicken noodle soup.

I did original recipe as is and It worked. In oppose to some reviews there was enough of everything and no mess at all! I rolled it right on my solid countertop and cut on the plastic cutting board. No Flour added when rolling.

I made the dough as instructed (actually doubled the recipe) and ran it through my atlas pasta machine- came out great. Looking forward to using this recipe again.

I gave it five, but this is my first attempt of making noodles. Not sure if I will try others or stay with this one. I have no complaints for the noodle I was looking for. Worked great, my kids liked it. It is a dense noodle or at least mine were

Being my first time making noodles I was a little skeptical when my dough wasn't coming together like I had hoped I added about 2 tsp more of milk and continued to mix and they actually turned out really good, I don't know if I even needed that extra milk. I used my stand-up mixer to make the dough as well as the noodles. Next time for the dough I will try some other reviewers method of using the food processor. Also, I did not let all of the noodles dry for two hours, I use 1 1/2 Cups for soup after about 30 min of drying. I doubled this recipe and got 3 1/2 Cups of Rigatoni noodles.
