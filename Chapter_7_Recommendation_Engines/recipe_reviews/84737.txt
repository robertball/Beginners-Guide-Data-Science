LOVE macaroni grill so this recipe jumped out at me! I followed this recipe exactly. Next time I will only juice half a lemon as the lemon flavor was a little strong for my taste.  Served with spinach spaghetti.

Delicious recipe! The only change I made was to remove the fish after it was sauteed--kept warm in the oven while I finished the dish. I don't want to overcook these delicate fillets while sauteeing the mushrooms, etc.! Put the tilapia back into the pan to let it soak up the tasty sauce, and serve with fettucine noodles and parmesan cheese sprinkled over the top.

I had some flounder, which I usually make it stuffed with whatever I have available.  However, these fillets were too small, so I made it with this recipe.  I prepared it minus the capers (since I didn't have any)and it was wonderful.  Try it, you'll like it.

I made this for dinner for my husband and I and we loved it.  I didn't alter the recipe at all and it tasted wonderful.  I  will definitely have this in my keeper file!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was really good.  After sitting a while the flavors get a bit strong so if you have any leftovers you should store the fish separate from the sauce.  Had lots of leftover sauce so serving with pasta or rice is necessary if you want to use up all the sauce.  Served with garlic cheese bread and a broccoli cauliflower mix.  Will definitely make again!  A very nice alternative to the cheese and butter coated fish.

This was just ok in my book...the flavor was fine, but nothing popped and really made me want to make it again. It was easy for sure, though.

This recipe was more than AWESOME!!! I only used half of the lemon as I am mildly allergic to lemon and served over whole wheat linguine sprinkled with fresh grated parmesan. I will definitely be making this a whole lot more. Thanks for posting!!

Phenomenal!  Made as it w/out the lemon.  Squeezed a little lemon juice on the fish instead.

This was very tasty.  I did cut back on the amount of tilapia--only two fillets from a Costco package--but the rest the same.  I would change the oil and butter ratio next time (even with more fish)--maybe 3-1 butter.  We only had French bread to soak up the sauce, and I think it would be good to cook some pasta with the remaining sauce and add a little butter to it.  I did let kosher salt and pepper sit on the fish for a half an hour before cooking time.  The juice from a lemon should be about 1/4 cup.  Thanks for a nice recipe.

Awesome recipe! I used just a little less lemon and wine, as I wasn't using quite a whole pound of tilapia. Great combination of flavors and the cooking method was great. The fish was cooked to perfection. Thanks, we loved it! :)

Light, tart, not too tart, though! Yummy. I had to use chicken broth in place of the wine, but still amazing. Next time, I'll try wine. Other than that, I halved the butter, and added more olive oil. I'd add more mushrooms next time. Served over quinoa noodles. Nice combo of flavors. My husband thinks it'd even be good without the fish. Maybe we'll try shrimp, or just additional veggies.

I would have loved to add capers but my husband hates them, otherwise I followed the recipe.  This was really good, my mother and husband both loved it.  My husband doesn't usually take seconds of fish, but he did this.

I made this and reviewed it a couple of months ago...made it again tonight and it's great again.  Last time I cut everything in half for less fish.  This time I just made two tilapia fillets but kept the rest of the recipe as written.  I also, as a couple of other authors suggested, added a small dash of cayenne pepper towards the end to give it a touch more zip in flavor.  

I'm glad for the extra mushrooms and sauce....I had enough left to mix in with the wild rice that I used as a bed for the fish, and everything together was fabulous!!

My family loved this recipe.  However after cooking the tilapia, I removed it from the pan and then added the mushrooms and white wine along with an extra tbsp of butter (as the fish soaked up all of it when it was cooking). Once the liquid cooked down to half, the fresh squeezed lemon juice was added.  No capers on hand but the dish turned out good anyway. it was served with caesar salad and rolls!

Outstanding recipe! A wonderful blend of flavors that complements the delicate tilapia perfectly. The only change I made was using a whole 1/2 pound of mushrooms (we love them, so why not?). It was absolutely delicious over angel hair pasta. I served the leftovers over rice and that was really good too. I highly recommend this recipe!

Very good!  I served it over pasta.  My kids gave it a thumbs up, with the exception of the mushrooms (but they're kids, so that's to be expected, right?).  The only thing that would have made it better would have been if I had made some crusty garlic bread to go with it and mop up the yummy sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe!  :)

Awesome and easy!  I had most of the ingredients on hand (save for the wine or chicken stock, which I subbed in water and 1/2 tsp chicken bouillon).  Served with chiffonade of fresh Italian basil, creamy mashed potatoes and large broccoli trees that I steamed in the scaloppine sauce.  Delectable and great for a week night.

Yummy!  Used only two tilapia fillets, but the same amount of other ingredients.  Will make again, but use only 1/2 of a lemon juiced.

I followed this recipe exactly and absolutely LOVED the sauce. The only thing I need to tweak is making the FISH itself stronger in flavor. (I love really strong tasting food.)  I might do a white wine/lemon juice marinade of the fish before just to add some extra zip. Otherwise it was awesome and I'll definitely make it again.

I am a fan of chicken scallopine, so I decided to try it with tilapia since I had some.  This recipe is not bad, but as with most dishes like this, the "sauce" is so runny that it ends up in the bottom of the bowl.  You must use a spoon to get any, and you can't use a spoon with noodles.  I wonder if you can cook the noodles in it.  I cook my noodles in chicken broth, which adds more flavor, but I just want the noodles to soak up the wonderful flavors that this dish has to offer.  

Using one lemon was fine... definitely not too lemony.  And I did eat my entire bowl, so it couldn't have been that bad right?  Maybe I'll try it with rice next time.

Deeeeelicious recipe! I have two little girls who are very picky eaters and they looooved it. I omitted the capers and mushrooms because I knew they wouldn't like them. I sauteed the garlic and some onions as well. There was only a little bit left.... which I am planning to eat for leftovers at work.

Very good.  I altered it a little bit.  I cut back on the lemon.  It needed more sauce so next time, I will double the wine and add 1 or 2 Tablespoons of the pasta water to help thicken it slightly.  I also followed another suggestion on here that I think made it better.  I sauteed the seasoned fish in the oil/butter and garlic and then let it cook the rest of the way in the oven.  Like the other review, I wanted it to not be soggy and wanted to be able to stir the mushroom and wine better.  I did put the fish back on the sauce for about two minutes at the end after I added the Lemon to help it soak up the flavor.

Wowzers!  This was a great change of pace for fish.  My hubby and I loved the flavor of the sauce.  Like another reviewer, I took the fish (I used Swai--it was great) out of the pan after the initial cooking and then reduced the sauce and returned the fish at the very end.  I used ICBIN Butter light (to cut the fat a little) and added about a 1/2 c of water.  The resulting sauce was still PLENTY tangy and I like tang!  Very yummy.  Hubby says the sauce would go well on most anything.  Definitely will be making again.

Good. Strong lemon flavor, which I liked. Didn't like it over the rice though. Next time I will try it over cappellini pasta.

This was ok. I followed the measurements to a T and it was wayy too lemony. Maybe try something different next time.

Loved this easy meal! Served with white rice and veggie and it makes for a delicious weeknight meal but tastes like a restaurant meal. DH doesn't like mushrooms so I just left them out. I will cook the fish at a higher temp next time to get some nice color on it before simmering it in the wine. But no complaints here for this recipe. It was like Tilapia Piccata! A serious keeper.

This was a hit at my house, I didn't and wouldn't change a thing.  We eat a lot of fish and this is a nice way to serve it differently.

Delicious!  This came out wonderfully, even though I made some mistakes and substitutions.  First, I had no butter, so I upped the olive oil a bit.  I used thin zucchini slices in place of mushrooms because my boyfriend won't eat food that has so much as touched a mushroom (zucchini slices work well anyway - they soak up a lot of flavor!).  My biggest mistake was the size of the pan.  I couldn't fit 1 lb of tilapia in a normal 12" skillet, so I layered a filet on top.  Since there were layers, I thought adding a little extra white wine would help keep things from drying out.  Don't do this.  Use a large pan and the correct amount of white wine.  Some of my fish was perfectly cooked, other fish was a little overdone and soggy.  What was nice was that I ended up with a lot of leftover sauce that I served over green beans.  I will buy a larger pan and do this correctly next time.  Even with my mistakes it was still amazing (boyfriend said "MMmmmm")and I plan to make this regularly.  Thank you!

This was super yummy.  I didn't have any capers so I just chopped a green onion and added that.  My husband said it didn't have much flavor but he prefers spicy, over flavored dishes.  I loved it!

I have been looking for tilapia recipes and this one looked delicious and easy. Was I right!  I had dinner made in 30 minutes, with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. Next time I will add French bread to dip in the wonderful scallopini sauce!

This recipe was mouth wateringly delicious. It tasted like something from a restaurant and only took 10 minutes. I used frozen fillets, so I gave mine a bit longer on lower heat to cook up. I paired the finished recipe with steamed spinach and was shocked. This is amazing.

Very good.  I used olives instead of capers because I had run out and it was tasty.  I will try capers next time.   We ususally do not eat fish at home, but everyone liked it and told me they would have it again.

Outstanding!  My husband flipped for this dish.  I made minor tweaks to taste with respect to lemon, etc., and I used more mushrooms.  I also removed  the fish after the initial browning and let the mushrooms simmer for a few minutes before putting the fish back in to finish in the sauce.  Great recipe!  I served with brown basmati rice and broccoli.

Very tasty. Company quality. Not  difficult, yet nice presentation.  My husband yummmed his waythrough dinner.  I added 1/4 c lemon juice, the full amount of the other ingredients, but only 2 tiapia fillets.  It made a nice amount of sauce to pour over pasta.  Will make again

ohmygoodness, ohmygoodness, ohmygoodness!  This was soooooo GOOD!  Idk if I was just hungry or what, but I ate this so fast that I was ashamed of myself!  I pretty much followed the recipe to a T except I increased the portions.  So I used a cup of mushrooms instead of a half (and will actually use even more next time) and 3T of capers instead of 2.  I also added minced garlic with the wine and other ingredients.  YUMMMO!  Go girl!  And thanks for the fabulous recipe.  This will def be on my monthly rotation!

This is by far my favorite tilapia recipe. It was AMAZING. The capers are a must - they totally make the dish. I followed the recipe exactly, and will make this many more times in the future. Thank you!

Great dish, and fast too!  I try to make more fish and Tilapia is always available and inexpensive.  Normally when the kids ask what's for dinner and I say "Tilapia" I get a response that is something like "ohhh....".  Not with this dish.  The kids love it and I do to.

Great recipe.  Followed it to a tee.  May husband and I devoured it.  Nice balance, paired it with spaghetti noodles that I buttered and added lemon olive oil too.  Tasted great.  Paired with Pinot Grigo white wine.

This is absolutely delicious! My husband and I loved it. It has plenty of flavor without being overwhelming and it didn't over cook the tilapia when I made it. I would suggest using a small lemon instead of a larger one, this will make sure the flavor doesn't take over the dish.

Followed the original and only added asparagus to the skillet. Used fresh water crappie instead of tilapia. Served over Brown rice. Delicious and ready in ten minutes.

It was good, but not spectacular. Maybe I'll make it again one day. It was really easy, so that is a plus.

Absolutely delicious! I added grated parmesan on top right at the end, and it was superb! I also skipped a carb, and served it with brussel sprouts. The sauce was a perfect compliment! I will definitely be making this again.

Easy to make and nice over noodles or rice. I agree with some other reviewers that the taste is a little bland. I added a chopped onion and a little red chili pepper to enhance the flavor.  Might make again.

This is the first time I have ever made fish and had it turn out moist and tasty.  The only thing I changed was to add more mushrooms.  Yummy!

Very good considering I did not have the right type of wine or lemon juice!  I used a Moscato wine which gave it a slight sweet flavor.  Very easy to prepare, nice to make for guests.

This was really good and easy! I took the fish out of the skillet before the 6-7 mins were up, though, and then continued reducing sauce. Served with couscous with almonds and thyme.

This is excellent.  My husband is requesting this for his birthday dinner.  I cooked 2 tilapia filets and kept all the other measurements the same and it came out wonderful.  It was easier than expected and quick.

This recipe was easy to make and very tasty! All of the ingredients blended together very well! I eat this chicken scaloppine all the time at Maccaroni Grill and sometimes it can be a bit greasy and I was a little nervous that this would be. It wasn't! It was just right! This is definately going in the recipe folder and will be made often!

What can I say? Best Tilapia dish I ever made!  Followed the recipe without changes.  Except, I wish I'd had mushrooms.  Even without mushrooms, this dish came out perfectly cooked, very moist and flaky.  Great sauce.  I paired this with Orzo with Parmesan and Basil.

Very good!  Tried this for the first time today and it is delicious!  Did not use capers due to not having that ingredient on hand.  Also doubled the amount of mushrooms because we LOVE mushrooms!  Will definitely make again!

I made no changes to this recipe and thought it was great. Unfortunately, I notice my husband put cocktail sauce on his (YUCK). Because of that I only gave it 4 stars.

I liked this recipe a lot.  It was easy and good!  I made with a brown basmati rice and it was very good.  I did not have capers which I think is probably a key ingredient!  Next time I will have the capers.

I followed the recipie exactly.  I doubled the sauce for 1 1/2 Lbs of fish and served with brown rice.  There was plenty of sauce to put over the rice.  My husband loved it and he is quite the critic.

Trying to get more fish in our diet and fewer carbs so I tried this recipe.  Used 4 filets in the recipe and ate two for dinner and had leftovers that I reheated the next night for dinner.  As we had devoured most of the sauce the night before, I made some more sauce with mushrooms and wine then heated the leftover fish in the pan with the sauce and if anything it was even better than the first night!!!

It was ok! I think my problem was that I didn’t had white wine so I used white wine vinegar which ended up making it very strong. I think I’ll need to try again with just white wine next time.

Excellent. My dilemma now is what I serve tomorrow night to match this. Added more mushrooms. Will remove the fish next tine during the reduction and return to coat with sauce and warm. Served with wide noodles and sautéed spinach. Great meal.

Only changes:  more mushrooms, pulled the fish off for a bit to let the mushrooms cook (especially since I added more), and added a couple of dashes of cayenne as one of the other reviews suggested.  Delicious and easy.  Served it with whole grain veggie pasta and steamed broccoli.  I will make this again!

I made this recipe exactly how it says too. It came out great! I made mine with garlic herb couscous. Will definitely make again as it is very quick and easy to do.

Wonderful, I added some other spices to the salt and pepper mix but it is simply delicious and even better if you drop some asparagus into the mix

Very easy to make, classy main course. I added some small pre-cooked potatoes at the end and served with a side of fresh greenbeans. Delicious.

This is simple and fantastic! Loved the quick cooking time too. I added more veggies because they needed to be used, and didn't have capers, but it still turned out super flavorful. Will definitely make it again.

Great recipe!  I altered amounts to taste but the heart of the recipe is great. Oh, I did sprinkle fresh grated parmigiano over the fish for a little extra kick.

Great tasting and quick dish that can easily be adapted to a single serving. I served it over whole wheat spaghetti and broke up the fish to mix into the pasta, adding a little fresh rosemary. Delicious!

I followed this recipe to the minute since I am just learning how to cook. So delicious. Lots of sauce so I would recommend it with pasta, I put mine over toasted bread (i.e. Almost stale bread I was salvaging) but I could see this over rice or risotto too. I would say this is good for beginners!

Very well received. Added vegetable broth to add a bit of sauce, and some paprika to spice the fish. Served on a bed of chopped, buttered cabbage.

Tilapia should have been cooked separately from rest of ingredients as the sauce didn't really develop; I did add more mushrooms as I liked the idea of having a real vegetable serving with the main course. Very watery; acidic flavors good, but needed something else.

Very tasty! I didn't have white wine so I used 1/4c white vinegar and 1/4c water with 1T sugar. And I used spinach instead of mushrooms. I didn't use any butter, just 1T olive oil. Fabulous healthy lunch!

I liked it, but my husband did not.  It was VERY lemony and I love lemon; but, when the sauce reduced - well, pucker up.  Added some veg broth which tamed it a bit.  I will make it again, but with only 1/2 lemon.  Thanks for the recipe.

I deleted the capers in the recipe, however the mushrooms are amazing.  My girlfriend fell in love with me when I made this for her.  It is a wonderful and pretty healthy meal.  I paired with some roasted potatoes and fresh asparagus roasted in the oven.  Love this dish!!

Made this last night.  Added a few artichokes but other than that stuck to the recipe.  Husband said it was excellent - he said it 3 times.  Served with yellow rice, black beans & roasted Brussel sprouts.

The whole family loves it! I also removed the fish from the pan before making the sauce, then added it back once it began to thicken and it came out perfect.

What I changed was... I used coconut oil instead of Olive Oil, and I didn't use wine. I used 1/3 cup of water and a little more lemon juice. Super yummy. Great meal.

My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. We made it almost as written, adding a bit more capers, wine, and mushrooms. We hate to measure so... It came out wonderfully. We added a tablespoon of a cornstarch and wine mixture to thicken up the sauce, then we ate the dish with angel hair pasta and fresh broccoli and garnished with a few sprigs of parsley. Yummy yum!

This was a very good recipe! I doubled the recipe as we have a large family. The only thing I did differently is I didn't have mushrooms on hand so I chopped up zucchini and used them in place. They soaked up the wine sauce just as well and it turned out delicious. I served it over a egg noodles which was good for the sauce.  I served it with a good crusty bread which was also delicious sopping up the sauce!  Thank you for this recipe!

Very very tasty!  Easy to make and quick to cook, a great weeknight meal!  I made the recipe as stated, and other than the sauce not thickening, it came out perfectly.  I'm going to experiment a bit to see if the issue with the sauce was on my end, but I'm sure I can get it thickened up one way or another the next time!

Was fine, but not great.  I've made Tilapia in other ways and loved it then.  I followed the recipe and served over pasta.  It was a bit bland, I wish I had sauteed the mushrooms on the side, then added, they weren't cooked enough for our liking. It was easy, but probably won't make it again.

This is delicious! I made a few adjustments, used light smart balance "butter" and used half of a lime instead of a whole lemon and omitted the wine just because I didn't have any and wasn't sure what kind of white wine to cook with. Great fish, certainly will make again, thank you!

Delicious.  Served it over angel hair pasta and subbed marinated artichoke hearts for the capers.   I did saute the mushrooms with the garlic, though.

Just Ok is ideal rating for this recipe for us.  We are adventurous eaters so perhaps the blandness was the deal-killer.  Edible and healthy but needed some 'oomph'.

My husband and I thought this was just terrific!  Super easy, and very sophisticated flavor.  The kids... well, not so much!  But something I would be happy to serve to company.

I cooked this recipe for my wife this evening and she LOVED it. I think the only thing I would do differently is add more mushrooms. It goes great with my spinach garlic vinaigrette side dish. One hint that I can recommend - whatever white wine you put into the dish serve with dinner, it makes a great bridge!

Made this last night.  Left capers and garlic out because I did not have any.  Followed everything else as directed.  The tilapia stuck to the pan and they broke off.  I took them out of the pan after they were pan fried on both sides because they're so delicate.  Then I cooked the mushroom with the sauce.  I added corn starch and water to thicken up the sauce, then I returned the fish to the pan.  I served this with spaghetti.  Family said it's a "make again" meal.  Next time, I will cook the fish in the oven while I make the sauce on the stove.  I will add other vegetables like spinach.  Overall, an easy, tasty meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

My boys always complain that I cook too much fish. No complaints on this recipe. They loved it! I followed advise for only half lemon and I absolutely loved it too.
A repeat for sure because it was so quick, easy and awesome.

Absolutely wonderful! My kids, 10, 9 and 5 all had seconds. I did fry the fish in the oil/butter for a little longer than recommended, as it seemed like otherwise it would be steamed. I then added the wine, capers and mushrooms for 6 minutes, removed the fish, finished cooking down the liquid, and then added the lemon juice, and the fish back to the pan. Simmered for another minute or two. Served with steamed green beans and brown rice for the kids, green beans and mashed cauliflower for me. This will be a staple in our house. Thank you for the great recipe.

This was just okay. It was missing something for sure. It lacked depth of flavor. I think I'll try making this again with some changes and will update my review at that time.

I used frozen fish that I thawed and it seemed really watery when I was cooking it so it's almost like I  boiled the fish.  Next time I will use fresh tilapia if I can find some at the store.  I can tell that this can possibly be a 5 star recipe if I make it with the fresh.  I did cut the lemon juice down to 1 tbsp.

We are not normally fish eaters but my husband and teenaged son actually requested more next time.  Only thing I changed was leaving the capers out.  Nice and mild but flavourful.  Will definitely make this again.

I loved it!! I altered just a little. Sautéd the garlic and mushrooms first. Removed them and cooked the fish as recommended and then added the garlic mushrooms and wine. Didn't have a lemon, but didn't seem to miss it... Great recipe!!

Very good!  I added sundried tomatoes for a little extra flavor, otherwise I followed the recipe as is.  I put the fish on top of cooked whole wheat spaghetti noodles and added fresh grated parmesan over all of it.  My husband said "you should save that recipe".  Thanks for a great meal!

I didn't have mushrooms so I diced and sauteed sun dried tomatoes in the olive oil as a substitute (plus I don't care for mushrooms).  I served over spinach linguine.  It was delicious.

Good fast way to cook fish, with little effort.  I left out the mushrooms and used spinach instead, and I thought it tasted pretty good.

since my son had 3 pieces and my hubby said it was good, guess that means I make it again.  I forgot the lemon juice at the end and didn't have mushrooms, I thought it was ok, not great, but since I want my guys to eat healthier, I'll make it again.

This was delicious - very similar to the recipe I use for baking tilapia and just as good, if not better!
3/18/2015 - made a second time, every bit as good as the first!
