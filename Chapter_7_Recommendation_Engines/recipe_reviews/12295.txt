Very good recipe.  Because one reviewer stated that it was too runny, I sprinkled uncooked tapioca over the filling before putting top crust on.  That is a trick my Grandmother taught me whenever you want to reduce the "juice" in a fruit pie.  Also, I stopped using flour in fruit pies ages ago...I only use cornstarch, and get a better taste.  Also, I have found that a 1/4 tsp. of almond extract brings out the flavor of many fruits...give it a try.  Over all, I liked it!

everyone loved it. I left out the flour and put 1 tablespoon tappioca. Just like apple but with a little different texture.

Thickening problem? Answer: In the previous reviews I read a lot of people had problems with the pie being so wet or runny.  I doubled the flour and found it was still runny at the required cooking time.  My crust was pale and no bubbling in the pie.  I cooked it 15 minutes longer (55 minutes) realizing the temperature has to be hot enough and LONG enough to make the 'thickener' work properly.  At the end of 55 minutes, my crust was golden and the pie was bubbling all over.  I removed it and let it cool about two hours.  It was thickened to perfection.  Another thing that might have helped was adding the tomatoes to the flour/sugar mixture in a large bowl and stirring to coat the tomatoes.  My husband and I were happy with the flavor even though there were a few strings coming off 'my' tomatoes in my pie.

For whatever reason, this year I had way too many green tomatoes to fry but not enough for a big batch of relish.  So, time to get creative!  In that mindset, I tried this pie and I have to say, it's good.  A little odd, but good.  One wouldn't think it's apple, but it's quite nice.  I used tomatoes with a bit of a blush to them, and I had to increase the baking time dramatically for the crust to  brown.  I would also decrease the spices next time-- the cinnamon in particular is a little too much.  But it's quite a nice use for those before-the-frost tomatoes!  I'll be making this again next year.

Yuck, This was gross. Not enough flour so the filling was really runny. I baked it until my crust was golden brown(about 40 minutes) and the tomatoes weren't soft at all. Tasted like green tomatoes doused in watery sugar.

I would not recommend this pie.  I am like most and wanted some creative recipe for my green tomatoes and found this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and added 1 tbsp of cornstarch to prevent watery pie.  The taste is extremely odd and is not like apple pie at all.  I will put my green tomatoes to use in a relish or some other fashion instead of this pie. I am sad I wasted a good pie crust on it.

Very easy prep, fast all around, I loved this pie and was a disbeliever of anything sweet with green tomatoes.  Bravo!!  The sweet/cinnamon tastes like apple pie spices.  Oh, I would not recommend slicing the peppers into long strips as I did (too many dinners, what can I say) - this was the only weird texture issue.

Yes, it was a bit runny, am making it again tonight and will add the cornstarch per the suggestion in one of the reviews.

I thought this was a great way to use up green tomatoes from the garden. I baked it for about 10-15 extra minutes and added a bit of extra flour just in case it would be runny. But it turned out fine. The tomato skins were a bit rubbery though. If they hadnt been, you would have thought it was an apple pie!

Had tons of left over green tomatoes from weather turning cold. I used a mix of Beefsteak and Roma type tomatoes. Since water content of the Roma's is much less than the Beefsteaks the pie came out perfect. Definitely going to keep this recipe around for when I have no time for making a complicated dessert.

This recipe was surprisingly amazing!  It tasted like apple pie.  I need to cut the tomatoes up smaller next time so my grandkids don't play fifty questions after eating 2 or 3 of them.  I made this into mini-pies using my mini muffin pan.

Not bad, but the tomatoes do have a strange texture that make them taste like slimy candy. It's not something you would want more than one piece of. I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the top of the top crust and baked it more than double the time, covering the edges with aluminum foil when they started to brown. It was not watery at all, but I cooked it longer and could have added more cornstarch than called for because I just used a silverware tablespoon to  measure.Might help to peel it or to mince the peel before adding.
