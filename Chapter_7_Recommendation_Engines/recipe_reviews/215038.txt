This was A-MAZING!  My husband and I bought some beets at the farmers market on Saturday and I had absolutely no idea what to do with them.  The directions were incredibly easy to follow, which I was very thankful for.  We made a few changes to the recipe: instead of the Swiss chard we used kale (because it's what we had) and we topped the salad with an over medium egg.  It was so good!  Seriously.So.Good.  I was so excited about it that I totally forgot to add the feta, but I think it would just add more flavor.  Thanks for posting this recipe!  We already have plans to make it again next week!

I used veggie bacon strips. Fresh grown chard and home pickled beets. The beets were not soft and tasted great in this recipe. Thanks for an innovative one! I'd sneak in garlic next time cause I love chard with garlic. Oh! I forgot the cheese.....

Delicious! After being a little over zealous at the farmers market and ending up with both beets and swiss chard (plus more) I was looking for something to use both. This recipe was perfect. I ended up using goat cheese instead of feta because I had some already. Really good!

This was fantastic!  Easily my favorite beet dish I've made so far... You can use any kind of green (kale, spinach, beet greens, etc) and it turns out just as delicious.  Also used queso blanco instead of feta and it was just as good.

SOOO Yummy!  Having never before cooked with Swiss chard or fresh beets I didn't know what to expect, but the flavors blended together are perfect!  Definitely leave in the peas...they add a sweetness that's nice!

Great salad. I used dandelion greens instead of swiss chard. Wonderful reheated as well.

So delicious!!  Thanks for the new idea for cooking chard!  I had chiogga and red beets so I used both with rainbow chard.  I completely forgot to add the peas at the last minute, they may have been great in there but definitely not missing anything without them.  Will be making again!

Bummer! This recipe evidently doesn't work well with vegetarian "bacon," which is what I used. Maybe you really do need the bacon fat to add flavor. Veggie bacon doesn't leave grease behind, and I found the dish to be pretty bland.

Eating both fresh beets and swiss chard were new flavors for my family.  It was a pretty good recipe for us to start with.

We had some beets and swiss chard given to us out of a friend's garden.  Went looking for recipes and found this.  It was so unique and I was a bit leery.  But it was veerrrry good!  My husband is not a huge veggie fan and he really liked this a lot.  We will definitely make it again.

This was awesome! I'm not a big fan of beets but this recipe was great. The only difference I made was using 9 bacon strips because that's what I had. I can't wait to have the leftover for lunch tomorrow. *UPDATE* Had it with Turkey Bacon and it tasted good too.

I grew beets for the first time and was looking for a way to prepare them. I found this recipe and loved it! My picky son even ate it because it had bacon. I used beets and Swiss chard from my garden and fresh pea pods. I snapped the pods in half and barely cooked them. I am thinking about adding cannellini beans tonight and making this a one dish dinner.

This is a pretty tasty dish.  However, there are some unnecessary ingredients to it.  First, the peas get lost in the dish; just leave them out.  Second, why is Swiss Chard used?  You know, beets come with their own, very tasty greens!  Simply choose beets with nice greens and use the whole plant.  No need to dispose of the beet greens; it is wasteful.

Really great recipe. I made it without the bacon to make it healthier and because I'm not a huge bacon fan, and it was still incredibly flavorful. Great combination of flavors and makes a great side.

Wow This Changed my Husband to a beet LOVER! I adore beets and now I can finally make them, even my 5 and 3 year old ate it up. I didn't have peas, used the beet greens and Tuscan Kale, it was truly devine!

This was good.  I am always looking for new ways to jazz up our favorite veggies.  I used spinach instead of chard because that is what I had.  I also drizzled with balsalmic vinegar, salt and pepper just before serving.  Will make again!

The only changes I made was to use fresh peas (we had just gotten them at the farmers' market), and I drizzled a bit of balsamic vinegar on each serving.  This is definitely going in our recipe rotation!

very good! The combination of beets and chard seem to balance each other.  The bitterness that I often taste with both is gone in this recipe!  Looks just like the photo -- and very easy to make!

This is a wonderful dish. The small amount of feta cheese really pulls it all together. I added chicken for a main dish and loved it. Great the next day!

Very good and a good use of the beets, chard and peas out of my garden. I didn't have any feta so skipped the cheese but will try that next time.

I used natural uncured bacon and there's only green chard in my garden so I used that and it was delicious.  I think next time I make this recipe I'll try using less bacon because I think it overwhelmed the natural goodness of the beets which were straight from my garden and are a lot sweeter than beets from the store.  Thanks Beth.

This is delicious!  We used Kale instead of swiss chard, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and we will be making it again.  We used one bunch of beets from the farmer's market boiled whole & then skinned & chopped.

This really took me by surprise it was that good. I'm not a fan of beets but this was an amazing side dish. I left out the feta just because I don't care for it and I used spinach because thats what I had on hand.  Will certainly be making this one again.

I've made this 3 times this summer...never with bacon because it doesn't grow in my garden with the chard and the beets! Still an amazing dish which even my kids enjoy. I trim the beets and boil them in their skins in a large pot just until I can stick a knife into them (crisp-tender). I then run them under cold water to slip the skins off, chop, and add them to the chard (or beet tops) with the peas. Yum.

We loved this salad, will make it again.  It was good warm but better the next day after refrigeration. I used more swiss chard than called for and also added the beet tops and some extra spinach.  It was fantastic.
