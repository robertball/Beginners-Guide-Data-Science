These were delicious! I have to admit, I had not read all the way through the recipe to the "bake 1 1/2 hours", and it was way too late to do that - so we just whipped them up & ate them straight away. We will definitely make them again - and maybe bake them, maybe not (but probably not for an hour and a half, that seems pretty long).

These are soooo good - we are asked to bring them to every family holiday dinner! The one thing I do that isn't in the recipe is that I reserve some of the cooking water (from boiling the potatoes). Just as the potatoes are finishing up their boiling process, I scoop out two ladles full and add them to my bowl of cream cheese. This helps to soften the cream cheese and also adds moisture and creaminess to the final product.

These were amazing and everyone loved how creamy they were.  I didn't add in the green onions or bake them. I also made them early and kept them hot in a crock pot for a couple of hours.

Soooo good! Since it was Thanksgiving and we didn't have oven space, I cooked them in the crockpot - on high for the first few hours then on low for a total of about 4 hours. I did use a tip from one of the other posters and added some water from cooking the potatoes. This made them very creamy and not dry at all. I beat them right in the crockpot, very easy.

I love this recipe and both my in-laws and my family love when I make it.  I however use onion salt instead of actual onions. (small siblings don't exactly eat onions..) I also just serve it after mixing it all together.  Didn't really enjoy the "crisp" top that the oven puts on it.  Big hit and I make it ALL THE TIME! :)

I do know I probably have never made this recipe exactly, but I can't be bothered with exact measurements when I need to make a much smaller portion for myself. I also must admit I just don't see the point in baking them afterwards. I now always make my masked potatoes this way and they are always a hit if company is over.

Delicious - like some others have said, seemed a bit dry when I had finished mixing in the cream cheese so I added about 1/4 cup of heavy cream: made it RIDICULOUSLY creamy and rich.  I also then added about a cup of ground cheddar and some garlic.  Really brought out the sweetness in the cream cheese (and I'm sure quadrupled the calorie and fat content...but hell...it's thanksgiving)

I made these ahead of time for thanksgiving dinner! I opted out of using onions and I used potato water as suggested below. I put them in the oven, covered for about 30-45 minutes before dinner to heat them through and they were a hit! I would make them again and again!

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner yesterday and was quickly informed that I am in charge of mashed potatoes from now on.  My family loved this recipe! I followed this recipe exactly except that I only put them in the oven long enough to warm them before dinner (about 10 minutes). If I had not been making this ahead of time I would not have put it in the oven at all.

AMAZING! I was only cooking for three so i cut the recipe down to about 1/3. Potatoes def need a little longer than 20 mins tho. But i can't argue with the results they were simply delicious!

Based on the leftovers I had after the meal, these potatoes will be very stiff and dry if made in advance and refrigerated.  You may need to stir them up well and add some milk or other liquid of your choice  before reheating.  The flavor is wonderful, however!  I made no changes to the ingredients and served immediately after baking.  Rave re views!

Only  difference was we added a little heavy cream for a smoother texture and we did not bake it, and it was a still a big hit.

I cut the recipe down... didn't need quite that amount of mashed potatoes for just three of us! I used 5 potatoes, 1/2 cup sour cream and about 4 oz. of the cream cheese. I also added a little heavy cream to it. I'm not sure why it called for baking it? They tasted great without the baking, but maybe next time I'll try baking it and then add a little shredded cheese and bacon to the topping!

Followed the recipe as is omitting the onions. Family loved this recipe. I found them a little dry so will add water from boiled potatoes suggested by a reviewer next time.

Instead of sour cream, I used Greek yogurt. It made it super thick,  so I added more butter. It balanced out perfectly.

My mom did a lot of entertaining and would serve this potato recipe as a company side dish.  It was always a HUGE hit.  My daughter calls this the "mashed potatoes that don't need gravy".

I add onion powder and just a couple dashes hot sauce, it made a huge difference, just a little punch! Thank you for sharing this great idea.
