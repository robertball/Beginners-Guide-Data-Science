Excellent recipe, especially if you like to tweak recipes, like I do.  

Here's what I did:
First, I grated my zucchini (peel on), then dried it really well in a tea towel.  Next, I mixed up my PP Spice, which is 4 tsp. cinnamon, 2 tsp. ginger, 1 tsp. cloves, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  

I doubled the recipe, using 2 cups unbleached white flour, and 1 cup of oats, which I measured and packed, then ground in my mini food chopper; I didn't grind to a flour, but almost.  I whisked grapeseed oil, 1 tbsp. vanilla, and the 4 eggs together, then dumped in a 15oz. can of pumpkin puree and blended.  I whisked the dry ingredients, then dumped them into the wet and gently folded until no more dry flour was seen.  I then folded in the zucchini, 1 cup chopped pecans, and 1 cup craisins.  

I baked them in a stone muffin pan which I preheated in the oven, let cool slightly, then sprayed with oil- I did not use liners.  I baked, turning the pan 180 degrees halfway through, until there were just a few crumbs on the toothpick.  I ran a knife around the edges, then dumped the muffins on the counter.  Do not do this- they  are very delicate.  Definitely let them cool a little in the pan if you can- I can't with a stone pan, or they'll over-bake.

The texture is amazing- very light and delicate, and the flavor is perfect- not too little, not too much.  They are also super moist.  By doubling the batch, I got exactly 24 muffins, and plan to freeze half of them.

Instead of the pumpkin pie spice I used 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. Also substitute equal part vegitable oil for the coconut oil.

These are good muffins. I was worried with how thick the batter was; I thought they might come out like bricks. But they were moist and cakey. They taste healthy in a good way. I wish I had made the topping in the Cook's Notes. I think that would have been a nice addition.

Pretty good!  I followed the recipe as directed, with the exception of my pumpkin pie spice being in extract form rather than a powder.  I followed the conversion instructions on the bottle, but the pumpkin pie flavor was a little strong for me. However, that may be a result of using the liquid version.  These are not super sweet.  I'd probably prefer a little more sweetness, but that would detract from the healthy idea of the muffins.  Nice way to sneak some veggies into my picky toddler.
