I made this pie for international Pi Day and the end result was pretty good! I followed the recipe pretty closely, but had to make a few changes to the custard element of the recipe as it was not nearly thick enough. After the custard was complete, I realized it was too thin, so I added about 2 Tbsp of custard powder to 1/4 milk and added that to the hot custard and continued cooking until it was the desired consistency. Although the recipe doesn't state, I allowed my custard to cool to room temperature before pouring over the peanut butter mixture. From there, I followed the recipe exactly and the end result was delicious!
