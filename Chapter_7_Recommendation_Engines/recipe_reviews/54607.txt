I made similar Teriyaki Shiitake Mushrooms last night to serve on top of my grilled salmon.  I used sake, soy sauce, asian sesame oil, and a little brown sugar as my sauce.  My mushrooms were sauteed in this sauce so they were served warm, but I'm sure you could marinate them cold too.  Experiment with the variety of mushroom you use.  This was my first time using shiitakes, and they were so meaty and tasty.

I marinaded the mushrooms for about an hour, and did them on the Foreman grill. I couldn't find Peppercorn Ranch so I just used regular Ranch to which I added some ground black pepper. Not bad at all. Thanks!

I made these to go with a grilled tri-tip roast.  Excellent, most everyone ate them without the dipping sauce, which some hid the flavor of the mushrooms.  Just make sure to use a teriyaki sauce you know you like first.

I let the mushrooms marinade for about 15 minutes then grilled.  We served over hamburgers.  This is a great low fat easy recipe (if you skip the dressings).  The mushrooms taste heavily of the teriyaki sauce.  I will make these again.  They are super easy.

I tried this and it didnt turn out very good.  But I think it was the teryaki sauce I used.  It was very strong.  I might try it again in the future with a softer teryaki flavor.

I have to say, I did not like these at all.  The dip especially didn't taste very good.  My husband didn't mind the mushrooms, but I could only handle eating two and then I was done.  Not a repeat for me family.
