This is a great recipe and my family loved it.  I added just a little more milk to the soup to make more gravy.
I also put everything in a food processor and think this makes it a little too mushy.  Next time I'll try mixing by hand.
To see if I can get a little better consistency.  Also want to try these patties on the grill.

I don't know what all the fuss is about.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added a small can of sliced mushrooms (drained).  I figured that if a recipe is called mushroom patties, they should have mushrooms in them.  I just thought that they were mediocre - like something was missing.  Nothing to rave about and I won't be making them again.  They are not worth the trouble.

This was great!  I used one package of GW broth instead of the onion soup mix, and added some sour cream and a little soy sauce to the gravy to add richness.  Reminds me of cottage cheese loaf (one of my favorites), in patty form!

Well, this turned out nothing like how I expected! While the mixture was easy to shape into patties, it stuck fast to the non-stick skillet. Then, when I took it out of the oven, they had melted and spread into a big sticky lump! Despite looking completely unappetizing, this did actually taste pretty good! Thanks!

OH my god this is amazing.  This is my favorite recipe i've made on this site.  I can not eat pecan so i used Almonds instead, I almost used the whole packet of onion soup mix but i think it gave it more flavor.  Also I can't have the condensed soup so i used an Organic Cream of Mushroom but still added the milk.  They smelt amazing when i was done mixing everything but when i tried to fry them they all fell apart and it looked like i was cooking hashbrowns, but i do not care what they look like they taste so good I was ready to dump it into a bowl and just eat it like that.  After I baked it with soup it was even better, I will be making this again and again.  Thank you Donna for such an amazing recipe.
