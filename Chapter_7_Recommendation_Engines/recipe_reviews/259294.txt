This was fun! I do think the batter could have used more seasoning but that is an easy fix. I used some regular hard boiled quail eggs and some pickled hard boiled quail eggs and even though the pickled ones are not traditional they sure were good. It almost gave them an "adobe" feel. Thanks for sharing!
