Upon reading the reviews, I was dubious to try these.  I made a few changes and they were perfect for us - my family loved them!  My suggestions: 1. Milk and egg should be at room temperature. To speed this process, put milk in a glass and place the glass in a bowl of warm water for 10 minutes. Whole egg can go in the bowl, too.  2. Sift the flour 3. Add to the flour/baking soda mixture: 1/8 TSP kosher salt, 1/2 TSP sugar; reduce cinnamon to 1/8 TSP 4. Place empty muffin pan in preheated oven for 2 minutes. Remove pan from oven and place a bit of butter in each cup.  Add batter and return to oven. 5. Per another reviewer, after baking, cover popovers with a towel during 5 minute cooling time (great suggestion - kept them really moist!) 6. Pour melted butter into a large bowl and drop popovers in.  Shake bowl to cover well. 7. Reduce coating to 1/2 TBL cinnamon, 3 TBL sugar. Good flavor balance, this was more than enough to cover them.

These turned out very bland in my opinion. This recipe made 8 popovers in my muffin tin. I served these with cherry preserves. Without the preserves, or a glaze or icing, this recipe needs some tweaking to make it more palatable.

We loved these.  They made 12 little popovers in my mini muffin pan and once rolled in the cinnamon sugar were yummy.  Unfortunately my oven is hotter on one side than the other, so they were a little bit lopsided, but they tasted great.  One thing I will do next time is while they are cooling in the pan for 5 minutes, I will cover with a kitchen towel, like with tortillas to prevent too much of a crust from forming as there is quite a contrast from the coating to the crust to the middle.  A perfect breakfast for 2!

Easy, quick and tasty.    A bit too sweet for me. Next time I'll finish with much less of the cinnamon sugar. But I tend to like things less sweet than the average bear and the recipe will probably be fine as is for most people.

They turned out to have too much cinnamon, everyone in my family tried one but the cinnamon was too powerful. The inside was descent.

rather be zero stars. the outer layer was perfect, but the center was bland, tasted like cinnamon sugar.  needs extra flavor, and would have preferred more flavor.

I saw the title for this, and the little kid inside of me was so darn excited because it had "bomb" in it, and "dirt" too. So I started making it despite the bad ratings. For some reason, the batter only filled 6 of the 12 holes, so I made another batter. Halfway through baking I realized it called for a "mini" muffin pan. Oh well. The dirt bombs turned out great, I would definitely make again.
