Whoa, these are some darned good "mashed potatoes!"  First, a mention of an unintended substitution - I sent Hubs to the store for turnips and he came home with rutabagas.  *Sigh*  Thank goodness they're pretty much interchangeable!  I added a little chopped green onion and some softened cream cheese and in so doing found I didn't need to add any milk at all.  I don’t know what it is about the simple and humble additions of nutmeg, rutabagas, er, turnips and bacon to the potatoes but there WAS something special and different about them, albeit quietly understated.  It really dressed up basic mashed potatoes.  I reserved some of the bacon and green onion to garnish the top which really prettied them up.

This has been a staple at our Thanksgiving dinner ever since I was a young girl (many years ago). It's a nice change from plain old mashed potatoes. The turnips give it a pleasant "bitterness" but the flavor is not so overpowering that it conflicts with any of the other holiday offerings. Especially good when topped with gravy.    A couple of suggestions: (a) include the bacon grease when folding in the crumbled bacon; (b) crumble the bacon really fine (the kids LOVE it when they come across these little treasure bits); and (c) add a finely chopped yellow onion for a little bit more of a "kick". Chicken or vegetable broth can be substituted for the milk. A dollop of sour cream (and perhaps some chives) go very well with this dish when it's prepared as a side for a normal weekday meal.

I used organic red potatoes, lowfat buttermilk,  instead of plain milk, turkey bacon and instead of nutmeg, I added a teaspoon or so of chopped chives and a little garlic powder. We all liked this a great deal. NOTE: For those of you who cook with turnips, be aware that they cook faster than potatoes. So, when you cut up your turnips, make them larger than your potatoes so they cook evenly.

We really enjoyed these. The turnips are not really discernable as turnips, but add a dimension of sorts. Altogether with the bacon and nutmeg, the dish was quite good.

Wonderful recipe.  I had never thought of combining potatos and turnips as I really like turnips by themself.  My finicky wife liked this dish even though she will not eat turnips.  I did put some minced onion flakes out of habit.  We will use this recipe often.

This was soo good! I've never cooked with turnip before and we couldn't even taste it in this dish! Excellent recipe that I look forward to making again and again. Thank you!

I made this today for lunch, using equal amounts of potato and turnip and adding carrots.  It was wonderful, even on a 100-degree day.  We ate it warm instead of hot off the stove.  Next time I will add more nutmeg.

I grew  up eating the same treat ( but turnip/rutabegas) was only an occasional addition. Probably because our " Victory Garden " could only grow so much!  My siblings and I all called it "Mixed mashed"!  Mom  frequently stayed with her nannie from Ireland when growing up, and was just as frustrated at the foolish answer to " why do you call it that? "  - she died before the real answer was given. Yep my greataunt (the family source for info) revealed that it was her real distaste of carrots! She passed this dislike right on down to her grandaughter.  We had turnip frequently, but it never survived our knife wielding family to be cooked. We all loved it pared, sliced  kinda thin, salted, and even peppered for the brave, then CHOMP, oh ,we loved it. When I was college age, she finally confessed - "I couldn't choke a carrot down for any amount  of money". Well, she raised 5 kids who loved that veggie any way you found it. Now her grandkids (26) and her greatgrands (28) all like the orange and white special mashed potatoes. The only thing added beyond S&P  was butter and maybe if we were being good some finely chopped onion.  To sum it up - God bless the Irish and the Scots  and their inventive ways!!!

i didn't add any milk because the veggies were moist enough without it. My kids loved it, 2 of them even wanted the leftovers for breakfast the next day. i would recommend eating any leftovers within a day or two, though because the turnip seems to get stronger as it sits. I mixed some grated cheese in with the bacon too.

Amazing! I added some green onions and let my bacon be chewy for my preference, as well as replaced the milk with chicken stock and it still came out great!

I use rutabagas instead of turnips and add some garlic cloves while they are cooking. Substitute  sour cream for the butter and milk.
