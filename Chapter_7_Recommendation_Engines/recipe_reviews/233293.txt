The recipe has a lot of potential.  I used a 10" ovenproof pan and used 4 eggs instead of 3.  Still it was a little thin.  This is supposed to be 4 servings but barely was enough for 3 servings. (2 adults and 1 child)  As the submitter suggests it is a good way to use up odds and ends in the refrigerator.  Peppers or green chilies would be an excellent addition.  Also, if you have leftover cooked potatoes you could certainly use those.  With a bit of tweaking this would make a fast weeknight dinner served with a large green salad to round out the meal.

This is a Sunday brunch staples at my house. I do two eggs per person I'm feeding. I stir in all ingredients except the cheese into the eggs. Then poor all in the pan. Mostly because I'm lazy. Then keep cooking on stovetop till eggs set up. Sprinkle on cheese and bake till cheese is melted in oven. Couldn't be easier.

I used hash browns and added some broccoli.  We enjoyed this dish a lot.

Great starter recipe for frittata.  I added shredded hash browns to mine, you can put pretty much anything in this dish.   It's really good as leftovers, just store the wedges in the  fridge and reheat in microwave, actually better the next day.

There was nothing in the house to eat.  So I got out a few eggs, a little onion, some cilantro and some ham and wow was this ever good!  I would do it again in a heartbeat and the best thing was it was the first time I ever made a frittata!  Great recipe!
