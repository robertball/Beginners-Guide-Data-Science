I'm surprised how easy this was to make.  I didn't have buttermilk so I added 1T of vinegar to a cup of milk and let it sit for about 10 minutes.  And, I used the whole 16 oz of fresh blueberries; glad I did cause I'm getting blueberries in every bite.  Everything went well into a 9 inch pie dish.  Again, this was easy to make in hardly any time and I thoroughly enjoyed eating it.  Thanks for posting.  Will make this again.

Doubled the recipe, cause Iâ€™m feeding three growing children and a husband, and used the mixed berries I use for my smoothies. HUGE hit! The kids love it! The husband actually ate breakfast and it was super satisfying!  Definitely a new weekend treat in our house!
