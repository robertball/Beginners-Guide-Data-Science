I married a Ukrainian so I KNOW pierogies lol We make hundreds of them at a time a few dozen times a year. To add some actual flavor to this recipe add onion powder to the dough at least 1/2 teaspoon and some PEPPER to the potatoes I added tellicherry fresh cracked pepper and some chives as well. With the onions omg add them to the potatos themselves!! Carmalize them and add them to the mashed potatoes ,and make sure to season the potatoes with sea salt and pepper and once u add the carmalized onions they will pop with flavor.  I also use dry curd cottage cheese to which carmalized onions have been added as well. If you want to make a cream soup ,save the water u boil the pieriogies in and reduce it by half,then add some cream and pop back in some unfried pierogies and you have a nice cream soup recipe for the next day.

I do make this recipe, but I let the sour cream come to room temp. first and I add about a cup and a half more flour. Once made,I wrap well and freeze first, then when I need to make perogys I thaw the dough in the fridge. It has a better texture after being frozen. I use quite a few different fillings but our fav. is potato and cheddar cheese. It has to be old cheddar though, this gives it more flavour. I use five pounds of potatoes and 1 1/2 pounds of grated cheddar, that  needs to be put into the potatoes when they are hot when mashing, also lots off fresh ground pepper to taste.  I also do not roll the dough and cut. I cut strips, roll into snakes and slice of pieces to flatten with a rolling pin. this way there is no waste and the dough does not become tough from over working.

The dough gets an "A" for simplicity.  It calls for 2c mashed potatoes.  I take that to mean already prepared mashed potatoes, so how you make your potatoes is up to you. I added cheese and onions to mine.

I loved how easy it was to make the dough, and the sour cream gave it a really yummy taste. I used a big upside-down cup to cut out the circle shapes from the dough. The only suggestion I would make would be to add more flavor to the filling. Maybe some spices, or garlic mashed potatoes would give it a bit more flavor. But overall, a really good recipe, and somewhat easier than other pierogie recipes I have made in the past.

My mother makes these weekly - she adds cheddar cheese to the filling with salt & pepper, or makes it the traditional Ukrainian way by adding bacon & onions that have been fried to the potato mixture.  We usually eat them boiled and not fried, with sour cream!  My comfort food.

I agree it's not my family's Polish recipe, but who's to say it's not polish? Many cooks change and adapt recipes, and this could have been the same. You can stuff these, like any dumpling, with a variety of different fillings. Sauteed mushrooms and onions, stewed prunes or other fruits, a slightly sweet filling made from hoop cheese (can be special ordered from many delis or can use farmers or ricotta cheese for a similar taste), sugar, cinnamon and raisins (my favorite), etc. We always served our pierogis with melted butter. They are a little on the bland side, but you can jazz them up to your own preference.

THE 5 STARS ARE FOR THE DOUGH!! I AM POLISH AND UKRAINIAN AND I WAS AFRAID TO WASTE THE INGREDIENTS (SOUR CREAM) IF IT DID NOT COME OUT. BUT...WOW!!! SO PLIABLE! I ROLLED PIECES INTO A "ROPE" APPROX 12" LONG, THEN CUT INTO 1" PIECES. I USED MY FINGERS TO MAKE A CIRCLE AND FINISHED IT OFF WITH A ROLLING PIN. AS FOR THE FILLING, I MADE 2 KINDS - I CUT POTATOES INTO CHUNKS ,BOILED UNTIL TENDER, WHEN SLIGHTLY COOLED I ADDED FARMERS CHEESE AND LOTS OF ONION THAT I SAUTEED IN A GOOD AMOUNT OF BUTTER. THE SECOND FILLING IS MY DAD'S ABSOLUTE FAVORITE, I USED FARMERS CHEESE, ONION WHICH I SAUTEED IN BUTTER AND FRESH DILL!!!! TO EACH MIXTURE I ALSO ADDED SALT AND PEPPER.  AFTER I BOILED THEM, I SAUTEED THEM IN BUTTER /ONION MIXTURE UNTIL THEY WERE GOLDEN AND CRISPY ON EACH SIDE.PASS WITH PLENTY OF SOUR CREAM.MMMMMMMM.....

First time making anything like this.  I used to buy the frozen ones all the time, and thought they were pretty good....  I would doctor them up a lot, but still, not that bad.  I did have a girlfriend in high  school that had a polish grandmother who made these on special occasions, and they were AMAZING!  That is how i first got into them, but after that, I only got the frozen ones.

This recipe is actually really fun and amazing.  It is so simple and easy, but with a lot of room to customize and improve.  A really good BASE set-up.

I cut the recipe in half just to test it... didn't want a hundred crappy things to throw away.  
I made 12 with the halved recipe... 
after I got the hang of rolling them and getting them ready to boil, things got fun.   The last several I made came out soooo good I was overjoyed.

Followed the recipe exactly, and would recommend this to anyone.  This one is a little trial and error for newer cooks.  Make a few small batches and see where you need to make slight changes.

Once you get it, you will LOVE it.  I don't think there is any one "secret" to nailing this recipe... just have to get a "feel" for it really.

the fillings can be almost endless, and you could add to the dough as well, to alter the texture and flavor.

I used an impromptu mashed potato recipe... just chopped and boiled russet potatoes with skins, drained, mashed with a scoop of sour cream, a touch of half and half, some salt pepper, onion salt and garlic powder, with cheddar

I've never had pierogies so I can't compare these to other pierogi recipes. The dough started out easy but after I cut out the rounds and starting filling them - I had to dust them in lots of flour. It started to get really sticky on me. I used garlic mashed potatoes in these and I have to say, overall, they were still pretty bland tasting. The onions did give a slight bit of extra flavour. I have to say, these reminded me of a local dish called "Aloo Pie" but the filling is spiced up with roasted geera powder and hot pepper sauce and the dough is made differently. Also, the aloo pies aren't boiled, they are just deep fried. Overall, these were okay. I might make again and doctor up the filling more. Thanks for sharing.

I had not ever had a pierogi until I married my husband; and then I only bought the frozen ones from the freezer section in the grocery.  The other night when looking for a side to go with the slow cooker country ribs I had made I came across this recipe.  These were very easy to make and quite good!  I stuffed with mashed potatoes and cheddar cheese this time, but I want to make again and try with chorizo, Mexican cheese and cilantro, among other things.  The dough was easy to work with, but I think I'll add a dash of onion powder and/or some salt to it next time as it was just a tad bland.  I didn't roll out the first ones thin enough and they took forever to cook and they were a bit "doughy" on the inside so be sure to roll the dough out plenty thin!  I used my large biscuit cutter and that made a perfect size pierogi for us.  Sorry Mrs. T but I won't be buying your frozen pierogi's anymore - these were just too easy and too good!

Made these, but added sauerkraut to some, onions and cheese to others and they are delicious as well!  I have grandparents from all over eastern Europe and NOBODY's recipe is the same.  Not ALL Polish make it one way... how dumb.  But I'll tell you, my grandmother made incredible pierogi with everything from prunes, to lemons to cheese and sauerkraut.  They were all delicious.  Her secret to get them to stick together???  she spit on the edges!!!  She cracked me up.

Such a nice easy dough to work with...and definitely use the suggestion to roll into snake/log, rather than roll and re-roll.  Also after rolling, rather than use a knife to cut, take a piece of thread about 12", slide it under the dough to the width you want, overlap at the top and pull both ends and voila'..no messing around with a knife. I also kept the dough in rounds, put potatoe in the middle and covered with another round and pinched edges...much simpler than the half moon; altho may not look traditional but tastes the same!I also doctored up the potatoes with cheese, pepper etc to give more flavour...adapt to your own taste.

I never made pierogies before but this recipe turned out to be great and very easy to make. I added cream cheese and garlic to my mashed potatoes and I think it made for a really good flavor. I could also imagine to add shredded cheese and/or cubed ham or bacon. This will not be the first and last time I made this recipe.

Homemade Pierogies are the BEST.  They definitely can be time consuming (so make a lot, so it's worthwhile!) but they are so worth it.  For the record, reviewers like QTSREIGN annoy me. This recipe doesn't state it's Polish and like every other food in the world...there are multiple recipes and preparations.  Your grandmother passed down a fabulous recipe, regardless of the country of origin!

My mother is Ukrainiane and has taught me to make these, except they call it Vareniky. They take ages to make and five minutes to eat, but are super delicious. They can also be made with cherries and served with thickened cream or ice cream as a dessert. I make them all the time if I have leftover mashed potatoes or cabbage. I would just like to add that many nationalities have pierogies but have different names for them. Ukrainian pierogies are made with yeast and deep fried or baked.

Great dough recipe. It handles well and allows you to make the shell thin without fear of it leaking. My grandma's were neat little pouches with potatoe filling. Thanks for this recipe. I am finally able to replicate the pierogies I grew up loving.

The Ukrainians in my family have always fried bacon and onions together to put over the pierogies - adds lots more flavor.  Other than that, a great recipe!

This recipe took some time to make but was a lot of fun to put together.  We added cheese, onions and garlic salt to the potatoes.  We also didn't use quite as much flour to the dough.  We found that flipping them over and browning both sides worked best for us.  The end product was delicious and we might add other indgredients such as a little spinach and mushrooms next time. This will be our new New Years Day tradition.

The only thing I did different was added the onions to the potatoes. These didnt have much flavor so next time I will play with some spices. It does take a lot of time to prepare these so be prepared!

Not the Polish recipe!!!!!! Trust me, I am a ....ski  For the dough- beat 3 eggs with 3 Tbs oil. Add hot water while beating vigorously (so you don't get scrambled eggs). Fold this into generous amounts of flour to form dough.  Stuffing: day old potatoes from the fridge (this is important to kep them from getting mushy) mixed with farmer's cheese (ricotta can be substituted), salt, white pepper, and sauteed onion.  Follow cooking directions as listed...

Great recipe but name is incorrect. There are no such things as pierogis. Pierogi is already plural and doesn't need the s. If you were making an English plural then you'd add an s to the singular, pierogi, to give you pierogs.
Please honor your Polish heritage and use pierog and pierogi correctly.

Relatively easy to make and really yummy.  I think the key is in the potatoes.  I added onion powder and cheddar cheese and garlic to the potatoes for flavor.  I also added about a 1/2 tsp. salt to the dough.  If you are short on time, make about 4 massive calzone size pierogies! :o)  Doing it that way also helps to not overwork the dough.  YUM!

I have almost the same recipe, no amounts for the ingredients.  It is my great grandmothers polish recipe, but the mashed potatoes have to be almost dry, do not make them like you would to eat for dinner. VERY little milk   Yes, you do need to put in more salt , pepper and garlic. always BOIL, never just freeze after you pinch. !  Boil, then pan fry if ya want. I do not use eggs, I think the sour cream makes them taste better. Always fry the onions in butter before you add to the potatoes, plus velvetta cheese is much better. enjoy!

I would have given it 5 stars if it made more in a batch. Instead of boiling them then frying I just put them in the butter and fried until brown, they were tasty and best of all crispy.

Love the simplicity of the dough! So much easier to work with. I make and place on a wax paper lined tray, then right into the freezer. Once they are solid, I portion into freezer bags. Great for a meal in a pinch.

I admit I was surprised with how well these came out after all the work.  I definitely recommend pan-frying them in olive oil; it makes them crunchier and brings out the flavor.  Topped with tomato sauce and parmesan cheese.

I really did enjoy this easy recipe, it`s much better than going out to the store and buying pre-made because you don`t always know what goes in them and these ones take no time at all and very little ingrediants.  The dough I agree, is a little bland and they don`t boil very nicely, but by adding a few things to fry them with makes all the difference. Even just frying them (no boiling) in some butter and a little seasoning works really well. Than, add some fried onions, bacon mushrooms and or pork you`ve got a great meal.

I used this recipe as a base, & extras from the reviews, also fine minced chives, since I had em in the garden. Instead of the sour cream, I used 0 fat yogurt & half the butter, the other half used in the warming stage.  To roll the dough, I cut off small bits, made bals in my palm, flattened them, and ran them through my pasta machine. Much faster.   Somebody said the fill was sticky. I used tiny ammounts of butter on my hands, which worked well.   Thanks for this flexible recipe, & also for the reviews; else I wouldn't have tried making perogies. They were great.

So Yummy & Easy to make.  I was always intimidated by the number of ingrediants before but this recipe calls for very little but with supreme results.  I love that I now have my go-to dough recipe for perogies and can experiment each time with different fillings.  Thanks!

My husband & I loved these.  I mixed in 2.5 cups flour then worked in the last 0.5 cup.  I seasoned the mashed potatoes with garlic salt.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  Well worth the effort!

Turned out fairly well.  It takes a bit to get the hang of how to get these to turn out well.  I also struggled with how to get more potatoes into the dough.  Rolling the dough thinner would probably help with that.  Overall good flavor, but definitely a recipe that takes a bit to perfect!

I have been wanting Pierogies for a while when I came across this recipe. I have to say it was very simple to make and easy to do. I think next time I will add some garlic salt to the dough for some flavor.

This recipe was amazing! I used left over cubed potatoes that I lightly mashed and added cheese and left over breakfast sausage that I chopped and mashed with a fork.  after reading other reviews I decided to add salt to the flour and that was a good call. I think if your potatoes are not well seasoned, it may taste a bit bland but I didn't have this problem.  These were delicious! frying in butter was tricky they really stick. Next time I'll use a NON stick pan.  My biggest problem was that they disappeared faster than I could get them on the table! Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! 5

Added chives to 1/2 of the potatoes, cheese to the other 1/2. Dough was so simple. A little tacky, just added a little more flour. I will definitely make these again.

Very tasty!   I gave these try and this will be my go to Pierogie recipe,   at least for the noodles.   Like other reviews say,  keep some flour handy during rolling and keep those hands oiled for kneading the dough.  It is super sticky!   

I made a custom cheesy potato filling,   I found that about 4-6 Potato's was appropriate for the amount of dough but I may do my noodles thicker then a lot of people.    

I tried to make them look fancy and use my ravioli trey, bad Idea,   dough is much easier to just work by hand.   Tried a pasta roller as well,   Don't do it.   Hand roll is the way to go for these.

This was my first time making pierogi but decided to put the browned onion into the dumplings along with some goat cheese. They turned out wonderful! I served them to my father for a surprise dinner, along with sauerkraut and kielbasa.  He couldn't stop talking about how good it was! Thanks for the great recipe!

Wonderful base recipe for pierogies! I made a smaller batch - I cut the recipe down by 1/4 (1/2 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup flour) and it made 17 pierogies. For more flavor, I added a dash of salt and onion powder to the dough mix. I used an instant stovetop potato mix and added a bit of smoked gouda cheese and bacon pieces to it as well.

A note to all - everything is so much easier to work with if it's chilled! Freeze the dough for at least 20 minutes and be sure to put the potatoes in the fridge until chilled.

One more thing I learned in the process - if you separate and measure out the potato filling before you start working with the dough, it makes the whole process easier. 

I will definitely try this recipe again and perhaps try a bigger batch next time since it went so well!

to be honest - I just used the dough recipe - and it was simple and easy. though on the second batch I did add a bit of salt & pepper. For filling we make pirogi with various fillings - though our potato we mix sharp cheese in with the potato for more flavor

I have to say I was a little leary about this recipe, but I tried it anyway. I have to give this 5 stars. The ease of making the dough, the perfect texture of the dough, the fabulous taste, 5*****. I made 32 of these tonight, and served them to my wife and mother in law. They went crazy. They both said they are better than what you get at church dinners. All but 6 were left, and I was asked to make more tommorow. I followed the recipe to a tee. I used cheddee cheese mashed in some and a sweetened kraut in the others. Great recipe, thank you for sharing this with us. You can never beat a Great Grandma recipe.

These were great! I made some changes to the filling to suit our family. I added some roasted garlic and medium cheddar cheese to the mashed potatoes. The dough was perfect and so easy to make using my pasta maker to roll it out! These will be a favorite in our house!

a good recipe, the dough is easy and the filling is simple.  I make these at least once a month, using the plain potato filling, the potato and cheese filling, sourkraut, onion  and bacon filling and the cottage cheese filling.  When a boil them I cook some of each so there is a variety to serve

Great recipe.  It's very similar to a Polish recipe that I got from a co-worker.   When boiling the potatoes, I added bay leaf and rosemary, added the browned, sauteed onion into the mashed mix, along with freshly cracked pepper, sea salt, fresh basil and some minced, raw garlic cloves.  The combinations from the rosemary and garlic can be detected immediately, leaving a refreshing, flavorful taste.  It pairs nicely with the cool sour cream taste from the pastry.  A+.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Simplicity at its best its awesome its not traditional but then again that word "traditional" is not in the title,its easier to make the dough than the old ways.Not everyone likes onions but still like the flavor so this is a fine way to make them as they can push the onions off.I changed what i put in mine but thats because my tastes are different then others so do your own thing and enjoy...
