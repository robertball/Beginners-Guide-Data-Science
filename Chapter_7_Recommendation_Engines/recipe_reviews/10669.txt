I have made these bars 4 or 5 times, and they have never disappointed me or anybody else who has tried them. They are meant to have that "sweet and salty" taste, so if that turns you off, don't add so much salt. The baking powder also adds to the saltiness, so adjust the amount of salt to your taste. Make sure you thoroughly mix the oats in so that all of it is coated with the butter/sugar mixture, and really press it down into the pan. I lined my pan with foil, which works very well for this recipe. And yes, it's even better with a teaspoon or so of vanilla.

Deee-licious! Fortunately, I read the reviews first and followed many of your suggestions.  I doubled the recipe, but divided the mixture in two parts, and baked each separately.  I used regular butter, and only 1/4 tsp. salt total. It was perfect for my taste.  I used shortening to grease the pans.  I made sure the oats were completely and thoroughly mixed with the sugar mixture.  I pressed it firmly down into the pan. Baked at exactly 400 degrees (per my oven thermometer)for 9 minutes. The last line of the recipe says "Cut while hot." This will result in a crumbled mess.  Instead, I waited about 7 minutes and then scored the cookies.  When the pan was completely cool, I removed the bars easily, with no breakage. It seemed like the cooler they became, the easier they were to handle. Will definitely make this again. My husband is inhaling them now. Thanks Mandy and Lisa. These are fast, frugal and fabulous!

Addicted to these bars!! I never understood why so many people said these were crumbly. I used regular butter, no salt and a little vanilla as suggested by others and NEVER came out w/ less than perfect until...I used a generic brand of oats instead of Quaker. Salty,disgusting mess. Hope that helps. These are Awesome!

These were TOO good!  I used only a pinch of salt, real butter, and added a tsp. of vanilla.  I also used a 10x15 rimmed baking sheet (jelly roll pan) instead of the 9x13 pan. It took a while to firmly pat the dough to cover the pan, but the tiny spaces remaining filled in during cooking.  I cooked exactly 9 minutes, and the dough still looked kind of molten when I took it out of the oven, but hardened while it cooled. A couple of pointers--use a really non-stick baking pan or these will stick, and cut and remove from pan while still warm or they will break apart.  They cool very quickly.  Next time I make them I might bake them only 8 minutes, so they'll be a tad less brittle.  I have not tried making this recipe following the directions exactly, but doing it "my way" turned out great!  These are really a grown up kind of cookie instead of a kid snack.

I found this recipe on my new Baker Secret cookie sheet.  Mine turned out just like the picture shown on the package.  They were great, I loved them.  Mine were not crumbly at all (like other reviews have stated).  They carmalized completely and were nice and chewey.  I baked them for exactly 8 minutes like in the recipe.  I will definitely make them again.  They were not too salty or too sweet for me.

These are awesome! I'm totally addicted! My brother and my fianc√© gobbled the whole pan up in an hour! I've made them many different times, and never had a problem with them coming out crumbly.  I don't time them, and I watch until the whole pan is bubbly (I think that may be the problem for some people... they haven't let the ingredients melt together).  I used only half the salt, and loved the salty/sweet flavor.  I sometimes add cinnamon depending on my mood.

Considering how easy this recipe is, it was good, although I'm not sure where the caramel flavor is.  My 15 month old is allergic to eggs so I will keep this on hand for him.  I used pam cooking spray and baked it for 5 minutes longer and it didn't fall apart.  Thanks Girls!!

I made these for a class potluck and all the guys liked them. Mine turned out really chewy, not crumbly at all. I made sure to mix the oats in very thoroughly so that the melted sugar would coat all of it properly. Also, I think firmly pressing the mix into the pan is important. I added a tsp. of vanilla, and used 1/2 tsp. of salt. The baking powder taste is noticeable if you eat them warm, but it totally goes away when they're completely cool, so be patient!

I used to make a cookie called "Rickety Uncles" for my family and to bring to potlucks, etc. My kids loved them! Over time, I lost the recipe and forgot about them. Lately I have been looking for the recipe again and scoured my cookbooks and the internet. None of the internet recipes I found were right. I did an ingredient search here and found this recipe. The ingredients I remembered (brown sugar, margarine, oats and baking soda) matched but many of the comments weren't describing my cookie. I decided to try it anyhow and as I was making it, instinct took over. I think I found the one thing missing that may help many of the crumbly/salty issues.  I melted the margarine, added the brown sugar and salt and "cooked" it for a minute or two to kind of melt the brown sugar, stirring constantly. While still on medium high heat, I added the baking powder. The consistency completely changes and the mixture becomes foamy and light coloured. I cooked and stirred it for about another minute before taking it off the heat and adding the oats. I spread it thinly on the sprayed cookie sheet, baked for 8 minutes, let it sit for maybe 5 minutes, cut into squares and had to try one.  I think I found my Rickety Uncles!! I'd be interested to know if anyone that made them according to the recipe notices a difference trying it this way. Not too salty, not too sweet, a little greasy and a whole lot of good! **Update** I use a 9x13x1/2" cookie sheet. A 9x13 cake pan would also work.

My cookies had an excellent taste but turned out more like granola pieces.  After reading the reviews, I realized what I did wrong.  I should have baked a little longer to allow everything to melt together.

After reading some of the other reviews I was tentative to make this- but I'm glad I did. We really liked them. I did make a couple changes though. I decreased the  sugar a bit and then added a few tablespoons of corn syrup. That really helped to hold it together so they didn't crumble. I also added  a 1/2 c. of milk chocolate chips. If you stick them in the fridge for a hour they're easy to slice.

Many people consider me a very good cook. I am not at all "new" to cooking either. However, I must say that had I not known that information before I made this recipe I would doubt myself. These turned out to be a  mess for me! That is the only word I can describe it as. I even read the feedback before I made these but thought I could fix it. I admit I could not. I am sorry if this seems harsh but I would like others to know so they will have an option as to try and make them or not.

This was a great tasting recipe.  I would agree it it not really a bar and I could not figure out how to cut them from using the recipie.  I decided that they might turn out better if I did them in a mini muffin tin and that was the trick.  The second batch I made was perfect but I did cook them for more than the 8 minutes.

While this recipe is very fast, easy and interesting, I would not make it again. We found it too salty and too crumbly. The brown sugar taste was masked by the salt and the butter made it really greasy. Did not satisfy my craving for something sinful last night. sorry...

I learned the hard way that you CAN'T use GENERIC oats- use name brand or you will have a crumbly mess!  With name brand oats, this is wonderfully addictive!

I followed some other advice and double the recipe, but left the salt at 1 tsp.  I also added 2 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I baked in a greased stoneware bar pan for 10 minutes.  I let it cool for about 10 minutes, then cut them.  They were crumbly when I tried to get one out of the pan.  So I left the rest in the pan to cool completely and they didn't crumble.

I agree with omitting the salt, other than that they are perfect. I lined my pan with parchment paper, I let them cool for a few minutes until they were firm, and then I just lifted them right out and cut them into bars. Quick and easy recipe!

I must have baked these too long, because they were really hard.  I didn't think they were very caramel-y tasting either.  Easy to make though, and no special ingredients needed.  I'll probably try them again taking other's advice

I USED ONLY HALF THE SALT JUST LIKE THE OTHERS SAID.  IT WAS STILL TOO SALTY.  MINE WERE CHEWY BUT THE TASTE IS JUST AWFUL!  I'M WONDERING WHY ANYONE WOULD SUBMIT SUCH A RECIPE! I WOULD GIVE IT LESS THAT ONE STAR IF I COULD.

We cooked this a few times before we figured out the crumbly (mess) vs. chewy (what you want)technique. We think that it turns out crumbly and falls apart- the crumbly granola bar result some people get- if you use quick cooking oats (maybe the finer grind means there isn't enough caramel to coat the oats enough or something). When we use regular rolled oats (health food store kind as well as Quaker) we got a great result.

I found these a little bit greasy(though storing them in the fridge helps-I think they taste better when they are cold).Good, but for the calories, I would probably choose to make something else.Sorry!!

I followed the advice of others, and added only a pinch of salt, a tsp of vanilla and a tbl spoon of Karo syrup. I thought it turned out well.
Mine was a little crumbly in spots. I think this was from trying to score it while it was hot.  I think had I left it alone until it was cooled and "hardened" then it would not have been crumbly at all.  This is a SUPER sweet dessert.  Yummy!

I made these "cookies" today and followed the directions exactly. They tasted like caramel flavored butter pats and I had to rub the butter that accumulated on the bottom off before I could serve them. It would be much more expedient to just apply them directly to the hips and avoid the detour through the digestive tract. They tasted great, but the greasy texture made them unappetizing and unattractive. Not a keeper.

Ack, I'm very disappointed to report that I fell victim to the crumbly curse.  I, like so many other reviewers, followed this recipe exactly, yet I ended up with a incohesive, sugary, oaty mess.  I took a tip from the others and used it as ice cream topping, which was OK, but too sweet and messy.  :(

These were awful! Much too salty and if you let them cook for 15 seconds over required time - they taste scorched.  Took them to work and only one person would eat them. I'll never make them again.

These were really easy to make and tastey, too.  I used margarine and melted it in the microwave oven and then threw the other ingredients in, except for the salt (as per other reviewers).  After it was baked, I put semi-sweet chocolate chips on part of it, thinking that it might be better with chocolate.  I was wrong.  The semi-sweet chips overpowered the oatmeal bars.  By the way, mine came out nice and chewy.  I wish I knew why some people ended up with crumbs!

These were very good. I followed the suggestion of others and didn't add any salt, I used salted margarine, and I added about a tsp of vanilla. After adding the oatmeal I added about another tablespoon of melted margarine to hold it together better. Cooked them for 8 mins and they came out great! They will need to cool all the way before you can eat them or they will crumble. 
They went fast in my house.

These were a little too salty for my taste, so next time I'll put in half. Even so, they were a hit at the party I brought them to. I made them in my mini-muffin tin, so cutting them was not a problem and I didn't find them crumbly at all. I'll make these again.

The men in the house thought these were yummy!  I thought they were very good too... but found them very sweet.  Also, when making the first batch I used the 9 x 13 cookie sheet and it made a mess in my oven!  I then made a batch in the 10 x 15 cookie sheet... results... PERFECT!

I don't know if I should review this one or not, I made so many changes!  Well, first of all, I didn't have brown sugar so I used white sugar and added some molasses.  Actually used only 1/2 cup white sugar since many reviewers had said it was too sweet.  I also cut back on the salt by a 1/2 tsp and added chopped walnuts, coconut and chocolate chips!  It was terrific!  Somewhat crumbly in spots, but otherwise held together well.  I suspect that it would do even better if done in drop cookie form...

This was just about the easiest recipe that I have ever made and it is very tasty. I'm a real big salty/sweet fan so I really enjoyed this and so did my husband. I followed a couple of suggestions made by reviewers though. I added a bit of vanilla, baked it for 7 mins, and waited 5 mins before scoring it. Very tasty!!!

I thought that it was a good recipe for the amount of work that went into it.  It took me abouy 5 minutes to mix up and put in the pan.  I made sure that the oats were completely coated and I pressed it into the pan really firmly.  I baked it about 7 minutes, not 8, until the edges were a little brown and crisp.  I cut them while warm and removed when almost cool  They turned out perfect; crsip on the edges and slighly chewy in the center.  My husband and I loked the sweet/salty flavor.

These were ok.  Did the like the sweet & salty combination.  They came out very sticky.  This recipe really needs to be eaten the first or second day.  After that they get really chewy.

Delicious. Definitely be careful with the salt: I used 1/2 teaspoon and will probably cut it to 1/4 next time, but I like the salty-sweet taste. Mine didn't fill a 9x13 pan, although I didn't double it. And don't cut them when warm, they will fall apart. Some of mine were a little crumbly, but even the crumbs were delicious! You may need to experiment to get them right; I think I will let them harden longer next time.

These cookies turned out really yummy for me after following the recipe exactly. I used store-brand quick-cooking oats and spread the mix on a flat baking stone. It was bubbly when I removed from the oven after 8 minutes. I think it was too hot when I cut it because it didn't cut very smoothly but it hardened as it cooled and the cookies were awesome. I did use a spatula to remove the cookies from the stone because they threatened to crumble - these are very delicate. Hubby and friends thought they were fantastic, as did I. Probably not the best thing for your figure, but sometimes you've just got to forget about your figure and indulge your sweet tooth. I will be making these again.

I just made my second attempt and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong?  The first time I followed the recipe as is .... with the suggestion of vanilla.  The first batch turned out dry and similar to a granola bar.  Today I decreased the oats to a cup and a half and baked until the caramel cookies had completely risen and were bubbly on top.  I had to keep looking in on them and probably cooked the cookies for 15 minutes.  I cut while warm and they came apart. I pressed the ingredients firmly into the pan to! The end result was a crispy crumbly granola like square more so than a cookie with a salt/sweet caramel flavor I do like but are too dry.

I had to add half again to get enough to fill my cookie sheet and ended up with a pan of bubbling goo.  I can't cut it because it's molten.  It may harden, but if it does, I'll have something resembling oatmeal candy.  What a bizzar recipe!  And not one I'll try again.

Okay - it sounded like a good idea at the time.  I bake all the time and have literally made hundreds of batches of cookies (I owned my own cafe).  These are NOT cookies.  But.....after reading the other reviews, I doubled the recipe except for the salt and baking soda (which was the perfect combination) and I baked for 8 minutes which was not nearly enough.  So, I stirred it around a bit and baked a little more.  Then I added raisins, sliced almonds and coconut and baked a little more.  I kept stirring to break it up a bit.  I guess total baking time was 25-30 minutes.  I ate some of it while warm which was good but this morning - I put some in a bowl and poured milk on it and it was really good.  It even stayed somewhat crunchy.  So, the reason this got ONE star is because it's NOT a cookie, it's cereal.  :)  It would also be good stirred into yogurt or sprinkled on ice cream.

My husband loves these cookies.  They can be a bit tricky, but if worked properly they do come out as bar cookies=not crumbly. My first attempt resulted in the granola like product others have mentioned.  The second time I made them I made sure I mixed them extra (used my hands like for meatloaf).  I had a hard time pressing them into the pan so that it was covered.  To get past this I placed a sheet of wax paper over the mixture and rolled it down with a rolling pin.  Worked great!  Baked per instructions, used a pizza cutter to cut them will still warm but not hot.  Decreased salt by half, added vanilla.  Yummy.  (They are much better after they cool.)

THESE ARE QUICK AND AWESOME! I did as author suggested and made my very first batch a double batch. Husband ate about 1/3 of the tub of cookies and then I took the rest to work that night. They were gone in seconds! Fabulous recipe! THANK YOU! I have already passed it on to several friends! -Sharon

I thought that these bars were very good and great to munch on, only problem I had was they were much too crumbly.  I (like others) used real butter and added only a pinch of salt.  But these are a keeper in my book!

I thought this was a wonderful recipe.  It was super easy and tasted great!  I left out the salt and added vanilla as others suggested and cut the "cookies" while they were HOT as the recipe directed and I didn't have any problems.

Quick and easy, and I had all the ingredients on hand.  The first time I made it, it was a crumble, then the next two times it baked up like a cookie.  I crumbled it over my ice cream anyway!

I so wanted to like these cookies but in the end I threw half the pan away.  I cut the salt in half like others had suggested and it was still too salty for me and the texture was an absolute disaster.  At first they were too crumbly so I tried to cook them a few minutes more which resulted in a cookie as hard as rocks.  I will definitely not make this again.

Wild horses couldn't keep me from trying this recipe once I read the reviews.  It was simple to make and turned out perfectly with scoring the bars when hot and cutting them later.  They were too sugary for us but interesting.  I don't think I'll make them again, but if I did I would be tempted to melt some chocolate chips on top.

These turned out very salty and did not hold together as they should have. As other readers have said, maybe they would be good sprinkled over ice cream but they are a bit too sweet for me.

These are definitely quick and easy, maybe just a bit on the salty side.  I'm going to take people's suggestions next time and add some vanilla and either reduce or eliminate the salt completely.  I took some to a friend who was working at a trunk show, and she shared to other women displaying their things.  She called me from her cell phone to get the recipe for all of them!  NOTE: I added a teaspoon of vanilla and took out the salt.  Wow!  What a difference!  Now they get 5 stars.

After reading the suggestions from other people I decided to leave out the salt and add 1 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  I waited 5 minutes after I removed them from the oven to score them.  They were great!  Thanks for an easy recipe that I can do with my kids!

I made these for my family Thanksgiving weekend.  It was a trial before my holiday baking.  Everybody inhaled them.  So easy, inexpensive to make and delectable!  I did not add the salt and used salted butter and it was perfect.  Definitely score the bars while they are hot.  Mine did not crumble and were easy to remove.

I took these cookies to work thinking no one would really like them, but I was WRONG!  You were right, they are delicious!  One of my friends who is very straight forward on telling poeple just what she thinks said, "Wow, these cookies are almost better than sex!"  Quite a compliment coming from her as I do take A LOT of baked goods in for people to try.  I am going to make a double batch this afternoon to take in to work tomorrow!  The first batch disappeared in about five minutes!  Thanks!!

I made these last night.  Basically, they're the "crisp" part to Apply Crisp.  I thought it would be great to have a wheat-free, dairy-free treat...however, they were a little too rich for me.  I added unsweetened apple sauce when they were finished and crumbled the mixture...This created a very simple apple crisp (sort of!) that my kids enjoyed, anyway!  For those who are finding that the bars are falling apart, you need to make sure that the brown sugar is PACKED when you measure it out.  Otherwise, when it melts, it won't be enough to melt throughout the oats and that's likely the reason for them crumbling apart.

FAR too sweet, but quite edible.  I expected the caramel to be more viscous and it kind of crystalized.

I used 7 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp butter flavored shortening. I don't understand the complaints about the salt, I added 1 tsp and thought it balanced the flavors perfectly. I think these were just okay, but my 4-year old son loves them.

I admit, initially after reading the short list of ingredients i figured these would simply turn out as somethin like lightly flavored brown sugar granola bar--however.. they were absolutely fantastic (added the tsp vanilla).   I mean it.. i am one for fancy baking, and long lists... but  honestly not name  a better sweet treat that i have tried recently! - Thanks so much. keeper for sure

I love the taste but need some advice.  I put them on a sided 9x13 cookie sheet, sprayed with Pam.  They baked up and over the edge and my oven is a mess and my house is full of smoke.  Should I put them into a regular 9x13 pan with high sides like for brownies next time?  Thanks

These were incredible -- easy to make and tasty!  I don't know why people say to eliminate the salt because you really need the balance from the sweetness of the brown sugar.  I used butter instead of margarine, sprayed the cookie sheet with non-stick spray, baked at 375 instead of 400 and in 8 minutes they were bubbly and lightly browned.  I cut them after a minute of letting them rest and they stayed together in squares, no crumbles.  I told my DH to "taste" them and he ate 3! The rest are going to a tailgate tomorrow -- Go Hokies!!

SALTY!  I can see that these would have potential, but as the recipe is written there is much too much salt, and it totally spoils the bars.  On the other hand, it's certainly easy to whip together and the ingredients are things that are usually around the house.

I made this recipe and cut out the salt as other readers suggested. I didn't bake in a pan however I dropped them like a cookie on a slightly greased cookie sheet and baked them for about 7-8 minutes. They are a very brittle cookie but my family LOVED them!

My daughter made them for the fair and they completely fell apart. I watched her every step of the way and she did everything according to the directions. I don't know what went wrong, but it was a complete flop. I will not be making these again.

SO GOOD. Seriously, just double the recipe like it says. I toasted some pecans in the oven for 5 minutes before and added them in with a touch of cinnamon- they didn't last the afternoon! :)

I should have read the reviews before I made them but it had such a high rating. I agree with everyone else, it was too salty and it crumbled. Great on frozen yogurt but they don't qualify as bar cookies. Make sure to use high quality oats. First batch I made with Quaker oats came out fine, cut easily, stayed together. Next batch, omitted half the salt and used store brand oats (hubby bought them) and they seemed finer and seemed to soak up all the "caramel". These turned in to a crumbled mess. They definitely need more wet ingredients to stick them together and they didn't taste like caramel. However, hubby loved them. I would not make them again. I think they were too thin to be a bar cookie. I like some substance.

These are VERY sugary. Might be good on an apple cobbler or something, but not by itself.

Extremely easy to make!!! Too salty in my opinion.  I would cut the salt in half.  Someone I made this for said it was the perfect blend of sweet and salty.

I wish I would have read the reviews first, I trusted the submitters claims and made a double batch.  This is AWFUL!!!!I was making this for  a get together, Luckily I tasted it first. To begin with it was a bubbly goo then it wouldn't harden.There's enough salt in there to float a ship.Good thing I had enough time to make something else.This would have been an embarrassment!

While the taste of these are fabulous...I could not get them to cut very well as a bar. I did as it said in the directions to score while hot but after they cooled...that really did not seem to help much. I think out of the 12 in the pan....and I used a 9x9....I only had about 6 that stayed together as a bar. Now...that is not saying that I will not eat them because I actually have not stopped. Guess I will just have to tweek it a bit to try and get them to stay together. Most definietly worth another shot!

Easy recipe..simple ingredients..no flour or eggs and has an old fashioned good flavor. Exactly what I was looking for when I came across this recipe...My only suggestion is to reduce the amount of salt suggested..will make these again.

I thought this recipe was good but too bland.  I made another batch and added about 1/2 cup butterscotch chips, 1/3 cup finely chopped milk chocolate bits, 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts and 1/3 cup shredded coconut.  I liked this recipe MUCH better.

I enjoy a sweet/salty taste, but found this much too salty‚Äîit overpowered the sweetness. I'll try it again, but I will be sure to use less salt next time. I also think the idea of vanilla is not to be missed‚ÄîI'll try that next time. 

Tried it again with less salt and they are divine.

Very tasty!  Sounded like such an interesting recipe, with such varied comments, I had to try it... and it was a very unique treat!  
I love the salty-sweet combo.  Had a really great flavor and texture, and by the time you'd get a square out of the pan, it was crumbly.  Scoring when still hot might help.  Either way, very tasty and my husband and I had gobbled them up in a day!

These were very yummy and super easy to make. I agree with the other reviewers that next time I make these I will use half the salt called for. They would also be great with coconut and/or nuts added and some chocolate drizzled on top. I will definitely make these again-my husband loved them!

Take my advice and don't use any kind of margarine substitute!  I used shortening (because it was all I had) and they turned out GREASY.  I may try it again without the shortening.

I bake a lot and consider myself to be very good at it.  So, I should have known not to add salt, I used unsalted butter, so i thought that salt would be good, I am actually a fan of the sweet/salty taste, but I felt that these turned out too salty for many people's taste, especially because there's baking soda and that's somewhat salty too.  It suggested doubling the recipe since they're so yummy and since I was baking them for work, I did that.  BUT, I should have baked one batch at a time as it turned out more like granola, which I agree with others, will be yummy on ice cream tonight!  I will try these again and I will also cook them longer, the center of it didn't get melted enough and just crubmled.

These are great!  As for the saltiness - I think the sweet and salty combination is part of their appeal.  I have made these four times now, and have been asked for the recipe each time.  And they have been requested for a function I'm going to today.  Thanks Mandy and Lisa!

I tried this with Butter Flavored Crisco shortening since I didn't have enough butter or margarine on hand to try it.  About 1/2 of the recipe came out solidified, the rest was pretty crumbly.  The crumbs would definitely make great topping for ice cream or maybe a apple crisp.  I took the reviewers' advice who mentioned the saltiness of the recipe and halved the salt called for in the recipe.  I thought it tasted a little bland but might improve with some cinnamon, and one of my daughters agreed.  The other enjoyed it as is, and as usual, my husband liked it very well, and wolfed most of it down!

I read all the reviews before I tried these so I would know what to expect.  I was very nervous about the time.  I ended up baking them for about ten minutes because I didn't want them undercooked and crumbly.  When I brought them to work I was very worried they might be overcooked since they were harder than I expected (about granola bar consistency).  Despite that, they went over very well.  Everyone loved them so I needn't have worried.  The next time I will try something different so that maybe they will be chewy instead of crunchy.  But I loved them!  And those people who complain, reason suggests that you use unsalted butter when making cookies - it's just common sense.

At first I was skeptical cause the oat batter spread so thin in the pan but it melted together wonderfully -- kind of like a oat brickle recipe.  You must bake it until it is just light brown or it is too crunchy.  Not too light, though, or it won't stick together and be chewy.  Watch it closely to bake it just right.

So quick and easy, and the results are fabulous!  After reading the reviews, I added only 1/2 tsp. salt (that great salty/sweet flavor is still there) and added a tsp. of vanilla.  I used unsalted butter rather than margarine.  No problems getting them out of the cookie sheet as I greased it very well, including the sides.  I baked the cookies for 8 minutes, even though they were bubbly on top before then.  Next time I might decrease to 7 1/2 minutes.  Almost as soon as I took them out of the oven, I scored the cookies.  They cool quickly, and when I was done scoring them, I started taking them off the sheet.  Easy!  These cookies are to die for!  I made them to take to a meeting and had to hide them from myself!  I'm amazed that with ingredients I had around the house and a few minutes, I made a great number of fabulous cookies!

I always adjust recipes to fit our needs/wants and this recipe is no exception. I use slightly less salt, watch it like a hawk while baking and score as soon as it is removed from the oven. The kids and husband loved these from the first time I made them and we never have them left for more than a day  (so be careful about how many you make!). 

If you do not let the sugar coat the oats and melt together with the butter completely you will have a crumbly mess. If you use quick cooking oats you will end up with less than optimal results. I prefer to use thick cut oats and a flaky sea salt when I am making these (a little coconut is nice too...not the sugary prepackaged stuff, I buy bulk unsweetened grated coconut that has sooo much more flavor it is ridiculous and in these bars it is delicious!)

I took a batch of these to work, and they were gone in a few hours! They begged me to make more!
I didn't like the saltiness, so I cut back on the second batch. Two teaspoons of vanilla made a HUGE difference. I love it!

Like a couple of other people, these turned out much better when I baked it another minute or two. Comes out less brown sugar-ey and more caramel-ey.

I like the salty and sweet flavor. I did half the salt and add vanilla like some others. I also added a handful of raisins. So, I didn't rate it higher because it really isn't the original? Good and easy

made this this afternoon for an after school snack. It was a very easy recipe to do but I am not sure if I will make it again. The flavor was fine but it did not hold together and was not at all chewy. It acted more like a granola than a cookie.

Wonderful! I did microwave the sugar mixture 2 min before adding the oats.  I also substituted grapenuts for half of the oats!!  They turned out super!  But be aware that they do need to cool before they will stay together.

These are interesting.  Definitely a sweet and salty effect, it kind of reminds me of kettle corn in that aspect. (Except with oats instead of popcorn).  I don't know if I would make these again, I wasn't that impressed with them, and would definitely not make to serve to guests.  I may try them cutting back on the salt some.

These were definitely not what I was expecting.  The end result was a crumbly, not so caramel bar cookie tasting mess.  The only thing that I did differently from the recipe was use 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine.  Maybe that was my mistake?

These bars taste amazing, but are nothing appetizing to look at.  No one touched them at the potluck last evening.  They do not slice well - but break apart in a mess.  The edges were very difficult to remove from the pan.  I would suggest buttering the vertical sides of the pan well - as this may help. My husband likes them - and will eat them all he says.

Kinda tastes good (but how couldn't it-its butter and brown sugar) and easy to make. But they don't look very good and the oatmeal is too chewy.

They were easy to make, and easy to remove from the cookie sheet, but I don't think they tasted all that wonderful. They were okay. Maybe it was because I used less margerine than directed. I don't think I'll bother making them again.

I read the reviews first and didnt add any salt. First it was gooey and after I refrigerated it to let it harden it crumbled into pieces. It was good like a granola bar, but i didnt taste any caramel. i wouldn't make it again unless i needed topping for my yogurt.  :(

These cookies are great, they taste like granola bars and that's exactly how I served them.  
However, I'm a baker at a Job Corps center, and they are a bit mature for the people that I'm serving.  (16-24 y/o's)

The taste is great, the texture however, is lacking.  I agree that it would be delicious over ice cream or yogurt.  It's a bit like candied oatmeal.  I added some chocolate chips and pecans to dress it up a bit.

wonderful!  this recipe is perfect for those sugary, buttery cravings.. goes from mix to munch in about 20 minutes.  i nibbled at them until i'd eaten the whole pan.  but next time i will omit or cut down the salt - maybe 1/4 tsp.

It was very salty and greasy.  We dont have Quaker oats in Germany so I just used the normal variety and it was awful.  Maybe a little less salt or soda would help but I don't think I will try it again.

Really like these cookies!  However, I think I will add an egg to "hold" it together... it is verrrrry crumbly!!!  Delicious!!  

Would also be excellent over ice cream and a baked apple.... yum! :)

I have made these twice with different but good results. The second time they seemed greasier but more browned. They are a great emergency dessert to take somewhere. Definitely reduce or eliminate the salt.

I had my doubts about the salt but decided to follow the recipe anyway.  It was very salty. Not edible at all,I had to throw it away. I will try one more time, NO SALT, I'm hoping to at least use it for ice cream topping.

As soon as I popped one in my mouth I started singing "Brown Sugar, how come you taste so good..."  Kidding aside, I didn't know what to think at first but have decided that these are pretty yummy!  Perfect Salty/Sweet combo!  Cooking time is a little off, I cooked it for about 12 min.

These are absolutely amazing! After reading the reviews, I made this specifically to top our ice cream.. It was quick and easy and well worth it. Beware though, this stuff is sweet. Mine also turned out more granola than bar and I did not use the salt, since I used salted butter. I didn't think it was at all salty and my husband went crazy over it...this will be made again and again.

These were okay but didn't turn out the way I anticipated they would.  As was the case for other users, my version of this recipe also turned out like granola...it's good granola but I was hoping for a chewy cookie.

I followed the recipe to the tee, and not sure if it is supposed to be salty. But it was a little salty for my tastes.

The Key to this treat is to use unsalted butter. This recipe must have orginiated from the East Coast, omit the salt if you live on the West Coast and use salted butter. Cool completely to keep from crumbling!

I tried these and found them very good although I used salted butter and therefore did not need to add salt.  I won't next time and there will be a next time.  Thanks, Gwen

These cookies were not what I expected.  Everyone loved them but they're a little too rich for me.  I have made them several times and they are always gobbled up.

I was expecting a little more out of this recipie. Maybe I cooked them too long and that is why they were crumbling. I was going to use them as an ice cream topping but someone took them to a church function anyway. Everyone but myself loved them so I am not going to swear off making them. I want to experiment with the length of time that I bake them. I suggest making them in small batches to see how they turn out for you first. I was expecting a more carmely recipie but everyone else liked them so I am going to keep trying!!

This was one of the worst recipes I've tried - what a disappointment. I followed the recipe to the letter & it did not "melt together" as promised". It needs to be cooked for much longer than 8 minutes, & is still crumbly - like granola. More like a way-too-sweet granola than a cookie.

I had my doubts as I was preparing this, but everyone loved them.  I think more candy than cookie.  I cut them into squares after about ten minutes in the pan out of the oven.  Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent.  The secret is in the baking time.  As previously reviewed - if not baked enough will crumber - if baked too long won't be chewy!

This was pretty good, really fast and simple. I didn't leave it in long enough so it was crumbly. My dad thought it was a little salty.

The recipe is easy to follow and they taste great. However if your looking for a cookie that you can freeze this is not one.  They tend to go soft and not stay nice and crisp. They taste great when they are crisp.They are very easy to make

Really really good! I was a little skeptical when I poured it out of the bowl and into the pan, but they came out great! Next time I think I'll use a little less margarine though, and maybe no salt since there's salt in the margarine.

Very easy to make, but the baking time listed was not nearly enough time.  My kids called them sawdust cookies because of the consistency but they finished them all and asked me to bake more (with the suggestion of adding chocolate chips.)

These are super yummy and easy to put together, but they were a pain to bake and try to figure out how long to keep them in the oven. My oven cooks unevenly, and so some parts were done and some were not. Now I know not to make bar cookies.

I was sure this was going to be a strange and weird cookie, boy was I wrong.  These were a huge hit with the whole family and especially with me.  The prep/cook time was great!  They were ready to eat in under 20 minutes.  Great for a quick sugar fix, or if you need a quick treat for someone.  Also, I like that these are all ingredients that I usually have in the house - no special trips to the store for ingredients.
