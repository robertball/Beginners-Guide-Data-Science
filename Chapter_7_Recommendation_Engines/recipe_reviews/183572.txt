I used to love Boston coolers when I was a kid. I lived in MI, but they were popular there. I think I might try adding a pic later. Either way, we used to scoop the ice cream and then add the gingerale, to taste, more like an ice-cream float. I don't ever remember seeing the two blended together, in a blender though, not even at the ice cream shops. The combination is so delicious!

My mom took me for Boston Cooler's at Woolworth's at their soda fountain. It was the best! Vernor's was aged for seven years in oak barrels back then. None of the websites for the real Boston Cooler recipes gave that information. Even the "Vernors" site says it used to be aged for four years in oak barrels. Apparently they don't remember their own history! It was seven years aged back in the fifty's!!

Nothing in the world beats this Detroit treat! Unfortunately, Vernors gingerale has COMPLETELY changed their recipe, but it still beats any other gingerale out there.

Forget the blender and serve with a straw and a spoon.  Lucious stuff and SO refreshing. A cherry on top is gilding the lily, but kinda fun.

I've been making these for more than 45 years, and I still consider these a mind blowing treat.  To the reviewer who likened it to a "foamy melted milkshake", add a scoop, or two, more icecream and it will be as lucious as any milkshake you've ever had.  Using a quality, vanilla bean, icecream takes it over the top as well. 

For those of you in the Montreal, Canada, area; try making a cooler with Spruce Beer, and French vanilla icecream; that will get your taste buds singing as well.

A Boston Cooler needs a full bodied ginger ale and Vernorâ€™s is the best.

I just put the ice cream in a glass and poured the ginger ale over it, ice cream soda style! I like both ingredients, but really never thought about putting them together. Very refreshing, and also creamy, on a hot summer day, and not overly sweet. As another reviewer mentioned, enjoy with a straw and spoon, and just use your favorite ginger ale! I live outside of Boston and never heard of this. Thanks for this delicious and easy treat!

We enjoyed this, it was light and refreshing.  It kind of tasted like a foamy melted milkshake.
