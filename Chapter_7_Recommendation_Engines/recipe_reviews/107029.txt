Easy to prepare and my husband gave it a "thumbs up." I find the baking powder taste a little strong; I can taste more baking powder than rhubarb! But it's a good use for the abundant fresh rhubarb coming out of the garden these days.

This was really good. It is VERY sweet though it definitely does not need ice cream or cool whip.

I've made this recipe twice and love it. It is sweet but I like sweet. It's real simple to make and I REALLY like that. Why is it that the simplest recipes are the best? Defies logic doesn't it.

Well as is it is a wonderful desert! I will definitely be making this again as my husband finally got rhubarb to grow in the garden.I made it as directions said (accidentally put the rhubarb in the dry ingredients) and it turned out perfect. This reminds me of my parents who were always cooking up rhubarb somehow. Thank you for the memories and the great snack.

Can't tell you how many times I've made it and how many times I have been asked for the recipe once someone has tried it. Since Rhubarb grows wild around here it's a nice change from the regular recipes. So juicy and flavourful.

I just took this out of the oven after 40 minutes. It was done perfectly. of course I had to taste it. The sweetness is nicely complimented by the tartness of the rhubarb. I cut up about 1-1/2 cups rhubarb so used it all. After reading reviews that it was too sweet I cut back on the brown sugar just a smidgen. Baked it in a 1-1/2 quart glass rectangular pan. I'm planning to put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it a little later. Looking forward to it.

Made it in a greased glass 8X8 baking pan. Chopped rhubarb into 1 inch pieces. Cooked perfectly in 40 minutes. Toothpick comes out wet not doughy. Great contrast between the tart rhubarb and the sweet syrup. Too sweet for me but my husband loved it. Kinda like a sweet-tart. UPDATE I made this with very sour blueberries. The taste was balanced. I used a 6 x 11 pan for more room.

This was quick and easy to make.  I tasted it as soon as it was cool enough.  It is super rich and sweet.  For me it would be too much with ice cream or anything else sweet along with it. I will definitely make it again.  Next time I will cut down the amount of sugar.
