This recipe is super easy and quick. I used Lite Peaches and Fat-free milk and it turned out delicious. I also did not have self-rising flour, so I used all-purpose flour with 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt.

My 73-yr-old boss gave me almost this exact same recipe (except w/ flour and baking powder, not self-rising flour, and no salt either) when I complained that I couldn't make cobbler.  It comes out delicious every time, works just as well with fresh fruit as with canned, and I even tried it with a jar of cherry preserves, and it was great!  If you make this, people will think you know how to cook even if you don't.  I also like to sprinkle granulated sugar over the top about 10 minutes before it comes out of the oven.  Watch out for spilled fruit syrup on the oven bottom though-- either scale down your recipe to fit your pie pan, or protect your oven with tinfoil.

I A couple notes ...this can be adapted for any fruit you like , but we prefer the peach , or fresh berries (sugared in their own juice ). It is VERY easy to adjust the size , simply double or triple everything except your butter , the butter is merely portioned for the size of the pan. also , if you reduce the butter too much , you will lose that slightly crispy buttery edge that is so much a part of this recipe(the butter is SUPPOSED to puddle up a little around the edge when the batter is added ) If you're looking for a low fat , low calorie recipe , this wont be it & trying to make it so wont result in a good dessert, but if you want to splurge a little now & then , give it a try! Finally , aside from ice cream , nearly everyone I serve prefers this warm with a little milk poured over the top .

OH MY GOSH, I would give this 10 stars if I could!  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 13X9 pan.  I used 4 15 oz cans of peaches in heavy syrup, drained the syrup off of 2 cans but not the other two.  Used 2 sticks of real butter melted and mixed in with the peaches, and poured the flour/sugar/milk mixture over all, but poured heavier around the edges as suggested by another reviewer.  I was not real clear on the bottom/top oven rack thing, so I actually placed my middle rack in the lowest position, and left the top rack in the highest position.  I baked it on the lowest rack for about 20 minutes or so, until it had started to 'set up' and just started to brown a little.  Then I took it out and sprinkled some cinnamon and sugar over the top and placed it back in the oven on the top rack.  I baked it until it set up pretty good (about another 20-25 minutes)  I actually used the toothpick test in the dough (crust) on top and it came out clean (thought it might not because of the nature of the *moist* crust, but it did)  Took this to work today and served warm with vanilla ice-cream everyone loved it (even one girl who doesn't even like peaches said SHE liked it!)   If you like peach cobbler, PLEASE try this!!!  YUMMO and EASY too!!!!!

This is very, very good! It's not too sweet. And the batter comes out moist. In fact, when I first took it out, I wasn't sure is was done. Because all I've ever had was my mom's cobbler, and I NEVER liked it. Her's was dry, very dry, like she made a cake and added fruit, blech (sorry mom). I think this might be good served with cream, or vanilla ice cream. If this is what fruit cobbler is supposed to taste like, I'll be making it often. Yum!

This is the recipe, those of us from Tn call "Cupa, cupa, cupa " because you use a cup of sr flour, sugar, and milk. The way we do it here is...melt stick of butter in microwave in baking pan. Then put flour and sugar in med. bowl stir with wire whisk to break up flour then whisk in milk you will have a wet batter. Pour batter in pan with butter don't mix then pour fruit don't mix crust will rise to the top during baking. We don't add the salt and we bake it in a 375 degree oven for about 30 to 35 min. or until golden. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream

I don't  understand  why this  is not  rated 5 star!  It is just like my Southern grandma made when I was young and  I have  been  trying  to duplicate her peach cobbler  for  years!  if you wan't  TRUE Southern peach cobbler....this one is it. The batter  works  great for blackerry cobbler too.

Made this for desert again tonight. It's the second time in as many weeks that I have served this delightful desert. It's so flavorful but not overly sweet. 

The first time I baked this dish I used Fruit Cocktail (only canned fruit I had on hand) and it was surprisingly good. Tonight I stopped by the grocer's on the way home and picked up a can of sliced peaches and a can of sliced mangos. It was wonderful!

I cooked it about 5 minutes longer than stated in the recipe. It seems runny when first removed from the oven but firms up as it cools. Great recipe!

really good and really easy. my only advice would be to make sure you spread the batter evenly over the fruit, because if there's too much in one area it gets kind of gloppy. will make again.

We followed the directions exactly and the flour, sugar, salt & milk mixture sunk to the bottom of the dish and "gummed up".  It was a mess.

For 'Southern' style cobbler...just use BROWN sugar - and CONDENSED milk.   I'd eat it every day if I could.

I will give it 3 stars because it tasted ok.  I had to make my own self rising flour but the batter still ended up too soupy.  The batter sank to the bottom and was still goupy in the middle after baking for 40 minutes.  I even reduced the milk by 1/4 cup.  Still soupy.

WOW! I am an avid baker, and I have to say, this is AMAZING!!! The only substitutions I made, was to use peaches in their own juice, and skim milk; just to make it healthier.  I did add some cinnamon on top of the peaches and in the cobbler batter. OH WOW!! The sauce in this cobbler is sooo good!!! My husband, dad, and children all LOVED it, and that is quite a feat in my home!!!

this is almost my great-grandma's recipe - other than the fact that she never used self-rising flour, the only difference is in the prep:  she would melt the butter in the baking dish, pour in the batter and THEN pour the sweetened, heated fruit into the center of the batter.  YUMMY FOR MY TUMMY!!

tx for sharing this one!  i had great fun recalling my times with Grandma Ellen!!

I grew up in peach country georgia and this is the recipe all the old ladies used.  It is delicious!  TIP:  Spoon the batter on ensuring more around the edges to crisp up nice.  Then use the rest to even up through the middle.  It will fill in while baking.  Allow to cool for 20 min at least before serving to allow it to "jel."  This is not a soupy recipe if cooked as directed.  Scoop on some ice cream, you'll be in 'peaches and cream heaven!'  PS you can double it too if there are a whole bunch of people. (AND fresh Georgia peaches are the only way to go!)

I really didn't care for this.  After adding the whole can of peaches and syrup I ended up scooping some of the syrup out before baking because it was just so soupy.  It looked nice and smelled great but it had an odd texture towards the middle of the dish it was all gummy and gross even though it was not undercooked, you could tell that's just how it cooked.  Around the edges where it crisped up a lot it was decent but most of it went in the garbage.  If I try this one more time I will drain the peaches and only add a touch of the syrup.  It was just too gooey but the taste was nice.  I only used this because I had a can of peaches sitting in the cupboard though...doubt I will be trying it again.

This was not to my liking.  It was swimming in butter when finished and the batter sank to the bottom of the pan and became a clump of sweet dough. Tried it twice.

This turned out so good! I used fresh fruit nectarines, strawberrys, and raspberrys. I cut all into bite size peices and sprinked some sugar and let them hang out a bit, I also did not have self rising flour so I used all purpose with baking powder by suggestion of another reviewer, also did half regular sugar and half light brown sugar and added a tsp of vanilla extract. This is the best cobbler I've ever made DH had seconds which is always a good indicator, I will definitly make this again and experiment with different fruits thanks for the recipe:-)

I don't know what I did wrong, but when I went to move it from the bottom rack to the middle rack, it hadn't cooked at all.  I didn't use self rising flour though, all I had on hand was all purpose.

We loved this fruit cobbler. Our teenage grandson who lives with us is a little picky about fruit desserts and he couldn't get enough of this. He likes it best with peaches, but we've also made it with cherries. I do reccomend pouring off a great deal of the liquid. Don't really need all that juice with the melted butter. BUT, as it sets up, it does get thicker so leave the juice if you want. i've made it three times in the last couple of weeks. Awesome.

I haven't made this in several years and found this recipe to confirm the one I used before. I know strawberries aren't a typical cobbler filling but I've never made this with anything else and I highly recommend it!  Just like anything else, fresh berries are best and a couple of pints is almost exactly the amount called for.  After slicing them, I usually add about 1/2 - 3/4 cup sugar and let them make their own syrup overnight.  I promise you won't be disappointed and if you're like my family, you'll find it difficult to enjoy another fruit in your cobbler after trying strawberries.

Sorry, this didn't even come close to my grandmother's recipe, the cobbler was too "cakey" for my taste and not sweet enough! I'm looking for a flakier, crispier cobbler dough. I only wish I had gotten my grandmothers recipe before she died.

This was ok. It tasted good but there was way too much doughy topping. I used spiced peaches, so I added some spiced rum to it as well. I don't think I would make this again.

I've made this several times.. its FANTASTIC! I've sent it to my mom to try.. she lives in high altitude though.  Everytimes she tries it, the top layer is raw in the middle.. how would she convert this recipe in high altitude?

This was great. Just made it for the first time and it is fantastic. I used fresh peaches, 1 cup of splenda, sprinkled a little brown sugar on top before baking, then before moving to the top rack I sprinkled a little cinnamon and sugar on top.I did bake it a little longer than what was said to on the top rack.

I did not care for this recipe at all but my 2 1/2 yr. old daughter did that is the only reason it gets 2 stars. The dough was too heavy & tasted just like playdough to my husband & I & I did everything just like the directions stated. Will def. not be making this again.

these were really, really good. i had to half the recipe because i only had a 15 ounce can of peaches. i also added half a teaspoon of cinnimon and a bit of nutmeg. i took it out of the oven, put a gallon of vanilla ice cream next to it, and watched'em fly!

I added can milk and a little allspice and cinnamon then devide 3/4 cup of brown sugar to the batter and the peaches along with every thing else in the recipe beside the milk I use Pet milk. It's smelling like grandma's house right now!

I’ve made this many times, always with frozen peaches. No one can believe the crust rises to the top and crisps every time, but it does. It’s even better reheated and “re-crisped”. It is ALWAYS A HIT!

I added some frozen berries to this recipe.  It was a bit too runny but was loved by all.  I will definitely try it again but cut down on peach juice. I had to hide the remainder from my husband so he wouldn't eat the rest!

This was OK, but not something I'd try again.  It was too doughy and heavy.

This was easy.  Since I used canned peaches that had syrup I cut the sugar in the dough down to 1/2 cp.  It turned out plenty sweet.

This cobbler is great!  It is soooooooo easy to make too!  At first I was wary because it looked to simple to be true but I was pleasantly surprised that it tasted very good!  I wouldn't call it gourmet but it's as good as any cobbler I've ever had. Thanks kdb!

This turned out looking horrible, but it gets two stars for tasting good anyway and another one because it was probably my fault (or my old, derelict oven's fault) that it turned out so badly. I didn't have any self-rising flour, so I used flour and a bit of baking powder. I also used 1% milk as it was the only type we had. It seemed as though there was far too much juice with the peaches, and the topping mixture floated unappealingly on the top before I put it in the oven. The topping was only browned in some areas; the rest remained an off-white colour that looked uncooked even though it was not. All in all, it looked rather awful but, as I mentioned, it still tasted good... it's just nothing I would serve to guests.
