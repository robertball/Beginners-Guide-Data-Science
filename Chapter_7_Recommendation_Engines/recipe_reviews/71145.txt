My boyfriend and I loved it!  I made it like the recipe asked,  except I only used an 1/8 cup of Peanut butter and i added Cilantro with the green onions and chicken.  I think the Cilantro made ALL the difference.  Sas very good and will definitely make again!
***ammendment
We still make this all the time - just wanted to add that we've also used crunchy chow mein noodles as a topping when we didn't have all the ingredients and it's great that way too!  Cook up the chicken in sesame seed oil and garlic, sprinkle some toasted sesame seeds on it instead of peanuts and it's really awesome that way, too!

Ok.  My Husband was a little leary when I said I was trying this recipe,  but while I was mixing up the sauce,  he said it smelled pretty good.  I had 2 chicken breast that I had already been marinated in roasted garlic, I have to say that my husband and my 13 year old son and myself LOVED this pizza!  I also cut back on the P.B. and it was awsome! p.s I used Boboli crust. thanks for the recipe,  its a keeper!

I used the suggestions of others and cut the peanut butter in half and cooked the chicken with soy sauce and lime, added mushrooms and cilantro to the pizza.  I used thai peanut sauce that was "mildly spicy" - it was very good!  You definitely need the bean sprouts and carrots on top.  I will be making this again.

This was YUM!  And tasted just like the frozen California Kitchen Thai Chicken Pizza that I can't find in stores anymore.  I took the other reviewers advice and used less peanut butter and used sliced, breaded chicken tenders.  VERY GOOD!

Great pizza--I use Jay's Crust from this site, reduce the peanut butter just a bit, and saute the chicken in soy sauce, red pepper, garlic, pineapple juice, and a  bit of kosher salt. I also add red bell pepper and pineapple chunks. This recipe feeds us for a couple of days, and it's every bit as good cold the next morning. Yum!

Wow, this is really good and simple to make! And, it is quite filling after just one slice! Make sure you use everything the recipe calls for, including the shredded carrots and bean sprouts!

I thought this was good but "needed" something.  My daughter loved it.  I also used less peanut butter (as other reviewers suggested) and cooked the chicken in soy and garlic.  I bought a refrigerated pizza crust, cooked it until lightly browned and then immediately spread the peanut sauce over.  I would make this again. Thanks for sharing.

This is terrific - phad thai on a pizza!  Don't leave out the carrots & bean sprouts, they really add a lot of sweetness and texture.  I also squeezed fresh lime over the top before serving.  For the crust, I used the Jay's Pizza Crust recipe from this site.  Wonderful, will definitely make again!

Good pizza!  Thanks for the tips to reduce the peanut butter.  We used the recommended amount of peanut sauce and an 1/8 of a cup of peanut butter...any more and it would've been too much I think.

Very good recipe- I'd been looking for something like this ever since I had something very similar at the Cheesecake Factory and fell in love.   The only thing I would change is that the peanutbutter plus peanut sauce was a little overwhelming; next time, I think I would mix the peanut butter with some soy, maybe wine vinegar or lemon juice to cut the sweetness.  I also added thinly sliced red peppers and left off the carrots and cooked my chicken with plenty of soy, hot sauce and spices before adding to the pizza.  Next time may add mushrooms.  Overall, exactly what I was looking for...thanks!

This was pretty good. I loved the peanuty flavors, but was not expecting this to have as much zing to it as it did. The peanut sauce put it a bit over the edge zip wise for me, and I wish that my husband would've cut it in half, as other recommended. We will probably try again, but with half of the peanut sauce. Overall a very good, exotic tasting pizza.

This wasn't my favorite dish.  I really liked the appearance and the concept, but I think the soy sauce was too strong for my taste.

The next time I make this pizza I will add less peanut butter than it calls for.  I thought the sauce was a little too thick.  The fresh bean sprouts and carrots on top are a must that really makes the pizza have a good flavor.  I also added fresh cilantro when I added the bean sprouts and carrots.

The only good thing about this recipe was that once it was cooked it looked very appetizing BUT when my husband and I actually tried it, it was all we could do just to swallow it. The peanut sauce was wayyy too much and I would never make this recipe again.

I do like this pizza recipe a lot....though I use the peanut sauce recipe on this site and put it on the crust, be it Boboli wheat or homemade.  Julienned carrots and using the sprouts DOES work out fine. Update: Don't tell anyone, but I like canned pineapple tidbits on it as well. No E Coli or Listeria or Salmonella from using sprouts so far, though it is a bit riskier topping to use. So now I use canned sprouts to ameliorate that risk. Prawns work well too, just don't overcook them. 3/5/18...make this semi-regularly. This time I velveted half a chicken breast that I then seared w/ a sweet/spicy Japanese Curry rub before putting on the pizza. I'll put on some homegrown Shitakes as well (from  cascadiamushrooms.com)...because I have them.

minor changes based on what I had/could find: used marinated chicken breast (tomato pesto). used at hand shredded cheese: cheddar, parmasan. Wonderful dish - unique flavoring - so different from the standard 'Italian' pizza - will definitely do again!

SUPER Yummy!  Some have said it was too sweet with 1/4 C pb.  I used good chunky pb, with just peanuts and salt, no sugar or weird oils, and I thought it was fine!  I used the full 1/4C and was happy with what I got.  As someone suggested, I added cilantro and a squeeze of lime at the end.  Very nice!  (Strangely my grocer didn't have sprouts so I had to do without.    Would make this again, maybe with a little red pepper flake!

I thought this was pretty good. I didn't have any peanut sauce on hand, so I mixed about 1/4 cup of peanut butter with soy sauce, rice vinegar and a dash of peanut oil. It was enough to spread over the entire crust. Also added red bell pepper.

I was a little nervous to make such a different pizza, but I'm so glad I tried it! I used a frozen pizza dough, but I might try something else next time - it didn't get as crispy as I would have liked. I also only ended up using maybe half of the peanut sauce/peanut butter mixture I made. Nevertheless, still a big hit at the Asian-themed party I took it to!

I decided to go with Gouda cheese and had a half a red bell pepper in my fridge and it was yummy on the pizza (I cooked it). I also made my own peanut sauce and decided to omit the peanuts since this is a pretty fattening pizza. I thought it was really good, but one of my kids said she didn't like the pizza sauce. Go figure.

Awesome.  Not only was this very tasty but also really easy.  The only change I made was to use just 4 oz of peanut sauce in hopes of toning down the spice for my kids, but they wouldn't touch it anyway.  My husband and I devoured it - reminded us of the similar pizza we used to eat at California Pizza Kitchen.  Will definitely make this one again.

Excellent pizza recipe!  I think I used too much peanut sauce though, was quite spicy, so I will probably decrease the peanut sauce and possibly increase the peanut butter.  Did not have bean sprouts, but it still tasted great!  Will add cilantro next time.  This is also extremely delicious the day after as a cold pizza...the pb and peanut sauce are not quite as strong after it has been in the frig overnight.  Highly recommended.

We used a thin crust and added the following (all thinly sliced) 1/2 small white onion, 1/2 red pepper, 1/2 yellow pepper, and a handful of snow peas. Used a Monterrey jack and pepper jack blend for cheese. Left off the sprouts. Was AWESOME.

wow. this is five stars and more! I followed others' suggestion and used 1/4 c. peanut butter. I used Target brand (archer farm's) Thai peanut sauce, the pre cooked grilled chicken strips from the freezer section, a boboli pizza shell, and I did add cilantro- it really tasted amazing. I will make this often and for company!

I didn't really care for this, so I'll review it for my boyfriend, who almost ate the whole thing over the course of a night. My problem was with the sauce--I didn't reduce the peanut butter like others had suggested, and I think I just bought a bad brand of sauce because normally I really like peanut sauce. We cooked the chicken with soy sauce and lots of lemon pepper and it was delicious! We also used a garlic naan for crust, which was really good. Anyway, make sure you use a good peanut sauce, and thanks to the submitter for an easy recipe!

My husband made this using a home made pizza crust.  Of the optional items, we used only the chopped peanuts.  It was very good!

Very tasty & easy to make.  I used pita bread & inside the pockets I spread the peanut butter sauce, then added the chicken, veggies, some spicy cashews that I chopped & the mozzerella cheese.  I put them in the microwave at 70% for 20 seconds.  Loved it & thank you for sharing!

This was wonderful! I ended up using a combo of mozzarella and colby/jack cheeses since that is what I had on hand and talk about yummy!  Great way to use up some leftover grilled chicken breasts. We are definitely having this again.

Great recipe, but it's better if duck sauce is used as the base and the chicken is tossed in the peanut sauce. Also used red bell pepper and crushed rep pepper flakes.

This is sooo similar to a Thai pizza made at a national gourmet pizza chain. I added thinly sliced red bell pepper to make it identical. I only used 2 tbsp. peanut butter & 4 tbsp. peanut sauce. Thanks for the recipe Jenifer!

I LOVED this recipe. I made my own crust, also.  It was too spicy for my kids, so I got to have it again today.  It is great as cold leftovers, too.

This recipe was so great!! We really enjoyed it the next day we had some left over ingredients but no chicken but decided to make it anyway and it was still very good. We topped it with some clianto as well as the sprouts and carrots. Very great if you are looking for something different than a traditional pizza!

I really liked the flavor of this, but my husband thought the peanut butter was a weird flavor in a pizza (I used 1/2 the pb that the recipe called for).  He admittedly doesn't like a lot of thai food though.  I think you definitely need the carrots and bean sprouts, too.

Wow, this was great!  I was a bit skeptical at first, but once I tried it I couldn't stop.  I used chunky natural peanut butter, which worked very well.  I didn't have chicken or bean sprouts, but I decided to cut up a red bell pepper and use that instead.  Worked very well, and while next time I'll try to get the chicken and sprouts, I'll include the pepper as well.  Thanks for a great recipe -- this is going to become a favorite, I can tell.

VERY tastey!  I added some bell peppers to the chicken while stir-frying, for some extra flavour.
All natural peanut butter was the best.

Would like to make my own peanut sauce, but local markets do not carry all ingredients needed. So I tried this one. Really good and my hubby chowed down. Changes: made my own crust with half whole wheat, precooked it on grill, also had some pre-shredded carrot/broccoli/cabbage salad mix, so used that in place of carrots. Only had mozzarella. Also skipped the extra peanut butter. Made an 15 inch pizza, and cooked it as well on the grill. Will definitely make again!

Awesome!!!! We LOVE Thai and this is so good! Didnt have green onion so I used yellow and sauteed it with garlic and the chicken in some soy sauce. Topped it off with cilantro and a little crushed red pepper and BAM- Deliciousness.

Love this recipe!  I used a pizza dough recipe from this site, and made it in the bread machine.  It made this recipe SO GOOD!  I've had this dish in restaurants and think this might be even better.  My daughter hates spicy food, but she liked this.

I did not care for this. I love thai chicken pizza in restaurants. This was a peanut butter pizza. I think what I should have looked up was a recipe for thai peanut sauce- the toppings that go on the pizza are pretty much common sense. I thought the peanut butter+store bought peanut sauce combo was a big fail.

I really wanted to like this pizza, with it's rave ratings, but I didn't.  I like Thai, pizza, peanut butter, but it just didn't come together for me.  Maybe the cheese factor through me off.  I followed the recipe exactly except added some red bell pepper. and cilantro.  There was no spicy factor and it seemed dry with all the bread.  I may try again and play around with it more.

I made this on my lunch hour and it was great!  I used 10 ounces of peanut sauce though and it was a bit too much.  Also, I used reduced fat extra crunchy peanut butter so there was no need to add extra nuts at the end.  Super fast and easy.  Loved it.

I would probably give this 4.5 stars if I could.  I made this with Bob's Red Mill gluten free pizza mix.  I didn't have a pizza tray, so I shaped the dough into a rectangle to fit on a cookie sheet.  I probably should've used more peanut sauce because of this, but it was still good.  I also used the full amount of peanut butter because I LOVE peanut flavors in my Thai food.  The chicken was just the right amount and I didn't do anything to it except grill it beforehand.  Thanks!

Made this together with my boyfriend and we both liked it.  Neither of us care for bottled peanut sauce so we used Thai Kitchen Peanut Sauce Mix Packet with Coconut milk and added things until it tasted right.   Fun to make as a couple or with the kids.

Delish! Used a half the peanut butter but used all the optional ingredients.  Almost as good as CPK!  Cooked two chicken breasts with soy sauce, lime juice, crushed red pepper and garlic spices.  Used a thin crust premade pizza.  We will be adding this as a staple!

What an interesting and delicious pizza! I used more chicken than called for, about 12 ounces - 8 just didn't seem like enough. For the peanut sauce, I used the "Thai-Style Peanut Sauce with Honey" from this site and we thought it went very well. I also added all the optional ingredients and would suggest others do as well as they added a really nice crunch and flavour.

This recipe definitely has potential. I should have listened to the other reviewers, and not used as much peanut butter.I found the peanut flavor overwhelming. I think it also could have used a bit more chicken.

Very, very, very good recipe! I made this pizza for game night at a friend's house. The pizza was very filling, so I could only eat one slice. A couple of people were vegetarian, so I only put the chicken on half of the pizza. Even after 6 months, I still get compliments on that pizza! Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very good recipe, I used thai kitchen peanut satay sauce which had great flavor. I only used a small amount of peanut butter. Instead of the optional ingredients I used red and green peppers which were delicious. Marinating the chicken in ginger added a good kick. I made a small 4 inch personal pizza that worked out very well. A+

This was very good!  I did change a few things based on other reviews.  I used only 1/2 cup of peanut sauce and shredded the chicken. Also, instead of bean sprouts and the shredded carrots, I bought a package of  broccoli slaw.  It saved time and had a nice crunch.

Very tasty and very easy to make, but the peanut sauce made it a little too spicy for me. I had recently seen and tried a similar recipe for Thai Chicken Pasta, and the base for it was equal parts peanut butter and Asian style salad dressing (Sesame/Ginger type).  It was excellent in flavor and not spicy, so I'm going to try that for this pizza.

The 7oz of peanut sauce is more than enough to make the flavor very rich--- only add more peanut butter if you are a glutton for pb.

As mentioned by another reviewer, cilantro should be added.

And the shredded carrots and bean sprouts could be added halfway through cooking as to not be raw yet not overcooked.

California Kitchen had a limited release of Thai Chicken Pizzas for $7; it's a shame it's discontinued.  To make this from scratch costs about $15.

We loved this pizza.  Totally something different than regular pizza... added the carrots, green onions, bean sprouts, chopped peanuts and fresh cilantro. Fresh cilantro is a must!!!  Used about half the PB as other suggested... you need all the toppings!!! Will make again!

This was fantastic.  Very filling, even without using quite all of the sauce and cheese that was called for.  Next time I will add cilantro as well.

So simple and impressive. Our guests said wow Thai pizza?!? Oh yes.. Let them think it takes forever to make. I did use only 1/8 cup of peanut butter and I marinated my pizza in the chicken satay recipe first. Great recipe! Even taster the next day!

I love this pizza, however I do make changes. First I use raw pizza dough from the deli section of my supermarket. I stretch it  out into a round and place on parchment paper. I add a couple of teaspoons of honey to the sauce and spread on the raw dough. Then I top with chopped Perdue shortcuts chicken strips, cheese, chopped peanuts, shredded carrots, green onion, cilantro and some canned bean sprouts (can not find fresh in the stores regularly). I then transfer the pizza on a peel (parchment paper and all) to a preheated  pizza stone in a 450 degree oven and cook for 18 minutes. Crust comes out nicely browned and crisp with toppings cooked perfectly. The parchment ensures no sticking to the stone and easy removal from the oven. Easy week night or weekend meal!

I used a basic tortilla shell for my crust (think flat bread style pizza) and added cheddar cheese and cilantro. Toddler approved.

Made this last night and it was my first time trying Thai chicken pizza. I loved it! I’m not super experienced cooking Thai food, so I stuck to the recipe pretty much as it was, except I marinated the chicken in roasted garlic and used extra cheese. I saw that someone used less peanut butter, I think I will take that suggestion next time I make this. Otherwise, it was delicious.

The recipe was easy to follow and turned out delicious, as per my family and co-workers (leftovers). The sweet taste and crunch of the fresh bean sprouts and carrots balanced with the smooth, slow burn of the peanut sauce. The only change I made was to reduce the peanut butter from 1/4 cup to 1/8 cup (same as many previous reviewers). The "slow burn" produced by the brand of Asian peanut sauce I used, which had some spice, was an unexpected and pleasant surprise.

I just used peanut sauce (less than called for here, but still a decent coating) and no peanut butter.  Definitely add fresh cilantro.  This recipe is great!

Very good recipe! Had something similar at a pizza place recently and wanted to replicate something at home...this fit the bill! I adjusted the amount of peanut sauce/peanut butter as suggested in other reviews. I added some chopped cilantro to the top of it when putting on the bean sprouts/carrots. Will make again without a doubt.

In my search for a Thai peanut chicken pizza I found may different ways to make the sauce.  So with this recipe I made it into 4 - 6 inch thin pizzas.  2 had the peanut butter added (chunky) and 2 did not.  I also left off the bean sprouts (out) and the nuts (only cause I used chunky PB).  I roasted my chicken with sesame oil, minced garlic & S.P.  I also used Mozzarella cheese (it's what I had).  The coated chicken with PB was too PB tasting with heat, the uncoated chicken +PB was better but sweet and hot.  The no PB coated chicken was better and the no PB uncoated chicken was just as good and better for little kids, as it had the least amount of heat.  All topped with dried cilantro as it was all I had.  The low rating is due to all the changes, I had to make for my family to enjoy it although if I want a really spicy TCP I'll add the PB but not coat the chicken.  Maybe thick crust would of tamed some of the heat down.

My husband and I LOVE this pizza!  I make my own crust, and just saute the chicken on the stovetop, and it never disappoints!  Don't skimp on the cilantro or bean sprouts, they really make it awesome.

I loved this - especially since it's so quick and easy!  Like previous reviewers  recommended, I used breaded chicken strips instead of grilled and added cilantro to the mix of green onions.  I did opt to top the pizza with bean sprouts, which are super-healthy, but I baked them with the rest of the pizza because I didn't want them to be overly slimy or colder than the rest of the pizza.

Delish. Just made this tonight. Tweaks: used half the peanut butter in the recipe and put cilantro instead of bean sprouts. Was surprisingly filling! My husband and I are big eaters and there were still 3 slices left after we ate til stuffed. Used pre-made Bobbli crust as recommend by many.

Superb! I used Bolboli thin crust, a reduced fat colby jack shredded cheese, used less peanut butter, and cooked the chicken in low sodium soy sauce prior to baking.  When the pie was in the oven, I pulled the pizza out when it had 5 minutes left and sprinkled cashews instead of peanuts over the pizza.  It allowed to cashews to roast while the pizza was finished cooking. DO NOT FORGOE THE BEAN SPROUTS OR CARROTS! ITS AMAZING WITH ALL THE INGREDIENTS. A FAMILY STAPLE NOW.

Stayed true to the recipe on half the pie. Added hoisin sauce, chile sauce, thai sweet chile, vinegar, lime, cilantro, very small drop of soy sauce to the peanut sauce on the other half of the pie - I really like this modification which makes the sauce sweeter and spicier. Just another option :D

I found this recipe by after searching by ingredient for bean sprouts.  I had a large bag I was looking to use up quickly.  Boy am I glad I did.  This is an extremely delicious exotic recipe.  I made my own super thin pizza crust.  I made my own peanut sauce using the Easy Peanut Sauce recipe from this site.  That is my go-to peanut sauce and I make it all the time for stir fry, spring roll dip etc...  It works great here too.  I cooked two chicken breasts, but really only needed one.  I poached them - take a frozen chicken breast and place in boiling chicken broth.  Cook for 15-20 min.  Perfectly moist chicken.  Then I sprinkled it with lime juice and pepper.  Used mozzarella cheese on top.  I also added cilantro the the topping sprinkled on after the pizza is done.  My husband and my neighbor raved.

yummy yummy yummy. i was lazy and didn't want to shred all the veggies by hand, so i threw them all into my little food chopper and came out with teeny chunks of red onion, green onion and carrots. i actually liked these small pieces more cause the stayed on the slice when i bit into it. also...check out some of the peanut sauce recipes on this site...they're perfect for this pizza. the crust i used was also from this site ("jay's pizza crust")

Yummy!  I used my own peanut sauce (Caprial's hot as hell chicken recipe), added some chopped red pepper & the carrots along with the chicken... Garnished with peanuts & cilantro after the oven... I think other reviewers are correct when they say it's all about the peanut sauce.

This is a great starter recipe, most of the thai chicken pizza recipes i looked at were to complicated or used dozens of ingredients i don't keep around my house. I made mine with half chicken and half shrimp just for fun and i cooked the carrots and bean sprouts with the pizza under the cheese and it still tasted great. I also served mine with a side of sweet chili sauce to give it a little extra kick and it was great. My husband and I worked at a pizza shop in our home town that made a thai pizza that was amazing and we tried it again last time we were home and even my picky husband said the one i made was so much better. Great recipe to play with or just eat as is.

This didn't work for us. We love Thai food, we love chicken satay... It was just too weird on a pizza crust. I'm glad other people liked it but I guess we'll stick with our usual pepperoni/ bacon/ onion/ cheesefest combo. Thanks anyway!

Amazing! I love love love Thai Peanut sauce, and this was such a unique way to use it! My boyfriend thought I was crazy when I was making this but loved it once it was done. I put sauteed onion and chopped water chestnuts on it, as well as very thinly sliced chiles (we like it hot) and it was delicious.

I really liked this recipe.  The sauce is a bit spicy, but I still really liked it.  I used chopped cilantro to top with when it came out and I also used the precooked chicken fajita meat from wal-mart.  I know it sounds weird, but it tasted great and made the pizza even easier to make.  Also I used "Jay's signature pizza crust" recipe off this site and it was AWESOME!!

I did not care for this recipe. After reading these reviews, maybe I did something wrong.

I used this recipe as a base, but I kind of did my own thing too.  It came out really good and we enjoyed it.  I used a Pillsbury pizza crust because I had it on hand.  I didn't measure the peanut sauce, I just eyeballed it.  I added about one tablespoon of peanut butter to it, but I don't think it needed it.  I used mozzarella and cheddar cheeses and again, eyeballed the measurements.  I used one boneless skinless chicken breast, which I had grilled, and then tossed with a little peanut sauce.  I carmelized some onions and red pepper strips and added those to the pizza along with some matchstick carrotts.   I baked it and then drizzled some additional peanut sauce on top before I served it.  If I had peanuts, I would have put some on top for garnish.  I'd make this again for a change from regular pizza, but I'd use a higher quality crust.

This was a pretty good pizza. It's been a while since I've had the CPK Thai chicken pizza (at the restaurant or frozen from the grocer), but from what I remember (and what I read on the CPK website) this is pretty close to authentic. I prefer red sauce pizzas, but thought this was a nice change of pace. My bf didn't care for this. He particularly did not like the shredded carrot, bean sprout, peanut & cilantro garnish (he thought I added too much), but otherwise he liked it too. I used Kikkoman brand peanut sauce and added only 1/8 c. of creamy PB. I thought 1/8 c. was perfect (not too peanutty for us). I do believe that the brand of peanut sauce can make all the difference. My only change was to use mozzarella cheese instead of Italian-blend (and I didn't measure it). One suggestion.... I think this would have turned out even better had I layered my pizza crust with cheese FIRST, followed by the chicken (I used an 8 oz. bag of grilled chicken strips, cut up and tossed with 3 T. sauce) and green onions. Oh, and the garnish is a MUST, albeit used sparingly. You must try this one! Thanks for sharing this great last-minute, I don't know what to make for dinner recipe :)

SO GOOD!!!  I used a Boboli crust and added the optional sprouts and carrots.  We used Satay Sauce for the peanut sauce.  I can't wait to make it again!!

This would have been a 5 if I would have used double the peanut sauce. Otherwise amazing. Will definitely make again.

Sooooo good!  I took the advice of many of the reviewers and just used peanut sauce and not the peanut butter too.  Everything else remained as written (except I had no sprouts).  This was such a unique and flavorful pizza.  I can see this one going in the rotation!  Delicious!

This recipe ROCKS!!! I cooked the chicken in some brown sugar and soy sauce. I also added some fresh lime juice and hoisin sauce to the sauce mixture. My husband and I loved it!

I love Thai and pizza and this is a great combination.  It was WAY too peanutty, so next time I will almost completely cut out the peanut butter and stick with the peanut sauce - which I used PADANG, spicy peanut sauce in this.  I also put this on a thin pre-bakes whole wheat crust and it was great.  Used lots of carrots as well..

Wow-gourmet pizza made right in my own kitchen...and fast! I is definitely spicy, so if you don't like food with a kick, tone it down with less peanut sauce and more peanut butter or sub. a peanut ginger salad dressing for the peanut sauce.
