Great tasting banana bread!!!  I used the sweet bread setting on my bread maker, which had the extended beeper to add bananas and nuts later. I'll definitely make this again. An interesting way to use bananas up in my bread maker.

I was a little worried during the kneading cycle with this bread.  The Dough wasn't forming a ball the way it usually does.  I considered adding more flour but decided to wait and see how the recipe turned out.  While this bread is very tasty (especially the day after it's made)I was a bit disappointed that it failed to rise.  However, I will make this bread again because it is quite yummy.  Most of all, my 1 year old son loves it drizzled with honey on top.

I added 1 cup of flour more to recipe - it turned out wonderfully well! So, flour amount should be 2 1/2 cups.  Great recipe - next time I will add 1 tsp. vanilla too.

Really good!  I mashed the banana slices slightly with a fork before adding to the machine.  I also added 1 teaspoon cinnamon like previous reviewers mentioned.  It smelled heavenly while baking!

So I did alter the recipe a little, so I don't blame the recipe of how it turned out, and for some people it was probably a awesome recipe. I checked all of the ratings before I started the recipe and there was a great number of reviews that mentioned it didn't cook all the way and that it needed another cup of flour. So I added a extra cup of flour, and I added 3/4 cup of each chopped walnuts and chocolate chips. The bread came out done, my husband even thought it was burned until I told him it had brown sugar in it. The main issue is that I love very moist banana bread, and this was not moist at all. It was very dry and little sweetness flavor in it.  I think it needed another banana and maybe a little less flour than the xtra cup. Some people like their bread dry instead of super moist. I am affraid if I hadn't added that flour I may have had uncooked bread, but it didn't need an entire xtra cup. All bread machines are different when they cook, so maybe that was why everyone had some of the different issues. With the walnuts and chocolate chips it needed to be a little more moist and probably another banana! Thanks for the recipe! It is defininately something I can work with to make what I want! Keep rollin in those recipes! I love em!

This recipe is quick, easy and delicious!  I actually didn't have any walnuts and used pecans instead.  I also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and maybe 1/4 cup of chocolate/peanut butter chips.  Everybody loved it, and it was so easy to make in the bread machine!  Thanks :o)

This is delicious! I used half whole-wheat flour and half regular flour and it came out great; I converted to a 2-pound loaf for my bread machine. I would defnitely make it again.

This came out rather dark and dense with a wonderful flavour. My husband ate nearly half the loaf by himself and told me it was really good, so I will ba making this again.

I just want to start with the fact that I modified this due to lack of ingredients, personal preference and after reading other reviews.

I didn't add nuts (I didn't have any) and I only had one ripe banana.  I also added 1 1/2 tablespoons of Cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of Vanilla and another 3/4 cup of Flour (I mixed wheat with bread flour).  I also substituted the white sugar with honey (we had just gotten some local honey).

When all was said and done, this came out amazingly better than I expected.  It was great.  Next time I'll add the banana and walnuts that I did not have (but it was still great without them).  I'll definitely be trying this again.

not very good at all - when it is mixing is it more like cake batter & it was higher (by about a inch)near the sides of the pan than the middle - it looked like it fell. My hubby asked what I did wrong (I had made the Banana Bread - Quick Bread for Machines a few days before & that was delicious-it was gone before the night was over) I told him I tried a diff recipe & he said "why?! the other one was so good!" This recipe seemed to not have enough flour, but all you can taste is the flour.

This bread was not very good at all. I followed the suggestions to add a cup of flour and also added cinnamon and vanilla, and it was still tasteless, yet yeasty. Plus it didn't rise.

This bread was just ok.  Edible, but not delicious.  Not much flavor, as others stated.  Was good when we put some honey on it.

After reading other comments, I ended up added extra flour and vanilla. It turned out good. I will try this recipe again using 2 1/4 c. flour to start with. This is the first sweet bread I have made in my bread machine so was unsure how the dough should look at the end of the second kneading and ended up adding just a tad too much flour.

I followed others advice and used 2 1/2 cups flour and added 1/4 tsp cin and nutmeg but it was still bland to me. Not sweet enough for me either. Could be good with a little more sweet and flavor.

I made this twice now. The first time I baked it in a 9x9 pan and the second time I used a 9x5 loaf pan. I followed the recipe to the letter. Both times it turned out GREAT. I'll definitely make it again.

This was very good.  I read the other reviews and increased the flour and bananas.  It didn't completely cook in the bread machine, so I took it out and put it in the oven at 350 for 1/2 hour.  Came out nice an brown and tasty.  The next day was even better.

There is no doubt this recipe needs at least another cup of flour. I was confused at first and didn't add the extra flour until the second mix cycle but it came out just fine. Tastes like a very good basic banana bread, next time I will probably try some raisins.

I was hoping this was the flavorful, easy bread machine recipe I was looking for. Unhappily it isn't.  Like others have reported, the bread didn't rise.  Mine was really gooey for some reason and seemed rather tasteless even though I added cinnamon and spice. But it was easy prep.

This is a good bread but i am not excited that you can taste the yeast it in.  I am able to make better banana bread my hand. All my bananas and nuts tend to fall to the bottom.  but the kids like it so i will continue to make it until i find a better machine recepie for my lazy days.

Very good. I made my own little tweaks to the recipe such as soy milk instead of regular and egg replacer instead of the actual eggs. I must say, i've never use a banana bread recipe that used yeast and was unsure about it, but this bread was awesome. My family ate within two hours of taking it out of the bread machine. Good job!

Loved the flavor and texture-but like other reviewers I had a "raising" problem. I will try a whole-wheat and white flour mix, and I will also try to convert it to a 2-pound recipe. however, try it: looks aren't everything, and this bread gets even better the next day.

The bread never rose!! I expected this bread to be lighter based on the ingredients. Instead, it's quite dense.  But the flavor is amazing.  It wasn't what I was looking for at the moment, but definitely something I will make again. I'm thinking of leaving out the yeast and just doing it as a quick bread next time.
