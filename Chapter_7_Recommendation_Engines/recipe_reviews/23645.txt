Wonderful banana bread.  I used instant vanilla pudding because that was what I had in hand.  I also decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp., other than that I followed the recipe and it is worth making again and again.  Thank you for sharing.

Very good, but a bit salty...will cut down on the salt next time. I used butterscotch pudding because that's what I had on hand and it still turned out great! Also, great results using butter instead of shortening.

Great Bread.  One word of caution, bake it in a 8 x 5 inch pan, it over flowed in my 8x4.

Great Recipe!

By far the best banana bread I have ever made!  I have long been looking for the perfect banana bread recipe, and others have been good, but nothing like this.  Moist, dense, and full of rich banana flavor.  Can't wait to share with family and friends!

This recipe is wonderful!  I had a whole bag of ripe bananas and was looking for a good bread. I didnt have any vanilla pudding but had a box of sugar free chocolate pudding so I used that. It turned out great and hubby is working his way through half of it while I write this. This is a keeper for sure, thanks for sharing!

Banana bread is one of my favorite things to make, so I was excited to try this recipe and I'm glad I did. I found it to be moist, sweet, and great flavor. The vanilla pudding added a cake like texture.  I added two more bananas for extra taste and left out the nuts.  Great bread, recommend it to anyone.

Wonderful light texture, almost cake like. I thought it could have used more banana flavor. Next time I'll add 1 more banana and maybe try banana pudding instead of vanilla? I only had instant vanilla pudding so that is what I used. Mine was really dark on the bottom but still the toothpick wasn't coming out clean, but maybe that is b/c I used a dark nonstick loaf pan? I went ahead and took this from the oven based on the smell and look that it was "done" although my toothpick said it wasn't. I'm glad I did as the bottom and sides were getting dark. This took an hour cooking time total, but next time I'll cut the time back a little. The loaf was beautiful and picture perfect! Thanks Maranda this is a keeper!

The best banana bread ever! Everyone has been asking me for the recipe. I did add more bananas. I didn't measure them. I just threw in what I had, and I found the more the better. I also haven't tried it with the walnuts, but it might be really good.

This was very, very good, but as others have mentioned it is a very light bread, not the dense, moist, chewy banana bread many of us are used to.  Personally, I love this version more!  I happened to have a sugar-free, fat-free package of vanilla cook n serve pudding mix, so I used that, but I also added a tsp of vanilla and omitted the nuts as I was out.   Mine was done right at 50 minutes - another 10 to 20 minutes would have definitely dried out the loaf, so watch your baking time.  Nice bread! Thanks for sharing!

DELICIOUS!!!! I got 2 breads out of the batter, and my husband and I ate a whole bread in the first hour.  I substituted a portion of the white sugar with brown sugar and cut out some of the salt like someone else said. I also used instant pudding and butter since I didn't have non-instant and shortening.  We loved it!!! I will most definitely be making it again.....SOON!!!

This is by far the best banana bread recipe untouched ever! I always double it and put a loaf in the freezer for emergencies.   I have made it several times just the way it is and a couple few times playing with the flavor. I had been making some freezer jam when my Peach jam didn't jell up, so with the bananas I added one of the jam size jars of peach. It then needed a little kick so I added a little Rum extract and that did the trick!

First of all, use a 9x5 pan.  If you follow the recipe directions, you'll be cleaning your oven like me.  The pudding flavor overpowers the banana flavor.

My new favorite banana bread recipe.  I used banana pudding instead of vanilla and also made a streusel with sugar, cinnamon, and mini chocolate chips that I added to the middle of the pan.  The loaf was gone the day I made it, and I can't wait to have some bananas to make some more.

This banana bread was a hit! Very moist, delicious, and easy to make! Cooking time for me needed to be reduced to 40 mins then covered with foil for 15 mins.  Covering with the foil is a must because the edges brown much quicker than the inside can cook.  I also added between 1 and 2 cups of chocolate chips, because we are a house of chocolate-lovers!

This bread is "bangin"! The only changes I made was I used instant vanilla pudding, reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp., used 3 large ripe bananas (didn't measure) and used 1 stick of butter in place of the shortening. It is sweet and very, very, moist...its a keeper!

I Loved this. The only changes I made were in effort to cut down the fat. I used egg beater's, replaced the shortening with 1/4 cup light margarine, and 1/4 cup applesauce, which worked very well. Will definitely make again.

I thought this was ok, my son REALLY liked it, my husband thought it was "ok" too. It was a chewy bread, had good flavor, just wasn't very "banana" flavored... I followed ingredients/instructions, so not sure why - but I don't think I'd try this one again since I was looking for a much stronger banana flavored bread.

I have made this several times and I love it. I made a few changes to make it healthier:  Used sugar-free instant pudding mix, whole wheat flour, applesauce for the oil, egg whites and 1/2 splenda for the sugar.  I have made both loaves of bread and muffins and they are great.  I also find it turns out better if the bananas are super ripe, almost black.  Each time I make this it gets eaten up very quickly!

I had a little more than 2 cups of pureed banana and my husband prefers to eat banana bread with chocolate chips.  So I added Ghiradelli Milk Chocolate Chips (about 2/3 of a bag) and since I didn't have non-instant pudding I used instant...French Vanilla.  Super Moist!  The top didn't burn but the bottom and sides were a bit blacker...haven't figured out how to stop that with any sweet bread.  Also, I didn't add walnuts...don't usually like them much unless they're glazed or in my grandma's chocolate chip cookies.

It took a bit longer to bake but i think its because I used a large loaf pan....It is moist, just sweet enough and DELICIOUS! I used butter flavored shortening and 3.4? oz of the instant pudding mix and 3/4c of pecans. Also, I used 3/4 c of oats and 1c of flour...GREAT RECIPE!

The best Banana Bread I ever made. I used instant vanilla pudding, because I couldn't find non instant, and I added a teaspoon of vanilla. It came out  delicious and so moist.

Awesome banana bread! It has a great flavor and texture. I usually make the Sour Cream Banana Bread recipe from this website but when I don't have sour cream on hand, this is an excellent second choice.

Nice Nice super Nice bread. I'm always looking for a good banana bread recipe. And this on did it for me. I have to say the only thing I can say was I decrease the salt because I saw another review saying it was salty. I normally don't start with others' reviews when making a recipe, but I did in this case. However, it is a really solid and moist recipe. The batter is thick, but that's okay, because it rose nicely for me. I didn't have non-instant pudding mix, so I used what was in my pantry. And I don't think, that it would have changed the outcome. My opinion only. Since the walnuts was an optional ingredient in the directions. I chose to add them to the top. I can see totally making this again. I followed the baking steps and my bread took about 20 minutes longer after placing the foil on top of the bread. It's and excellent and delightful bread, hands down and thumbs up. Ty will make again.

Made this Sunday for a church bake sale. it was a hit, i made it in a Bundt pan and added nuts just on top, it was yummy and delicous.  Interestingly enough, no one thought it was too sweet, jsut very good and the taste of banana really stood out.  thanks for the recipe i will definatley use again.

Very good!  The only changes I made were I used instant vanilla pudding & added 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  Bread was very dense.
I made this recipe again but omitted the pudding mix.  I added 1 teaspoon each of cinnamon & vanilla with three bananas.  It was great & very moist.

Very good used chocolate chips instead of nuts.  It tasted more like a cupcake to me with how sweet it was!  Made muffins out instead of bread.

This is may favourite recipe and will be making this over and over again. I used butter instead of margarine, added 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and I used organic flour. It was so moist and cake like.

Awesome recipe!  It is just about perfect.  It doesn't have an overwhelming banana taste, which was perfect for my fiance who isn't that fond of heavy banana bread...  Thanks for the recipe!  I will definitely keep this one handy for the holidays.

Excellent - I think this is my  new favorite banana bread - moist and tasty-  I used  smart balance butter, instant  banana cream pudding, 3 whole bananas, 1/2 tsp banana extract,1 tsp vanilla extract-  I used  a little more milk( buttermilk ) and  a lot  more nuts-- I baked in  3  mini type pans  about 50 min and it came out so good and I  sprinkled top with cinnamon sugar before baking.

You can use instant pudding and you can sub butter for the shortening (soften the butter first)...it all works out fine.  Sometimes I add wheat germ or flax seed and it still comes out good.  It's still our favorite and we hope you all continue to enjoy it...  Oh and another poster was right, this is muffin like in texture, but oh so good!  I always cook it a little less so I can have a slightly soft gooey center up at the top...that's my favorite part!

Pretty good banana bread. I used chocolate pudding instead of vanilla which was wonderful. It was the consistancy that got me. If your looking for a bread-like consistancy this is not for you. This was more of a moist muffin recipe. Very good though if that is what you are looking for!

I made this with a stick of margerine in place of the shortening and beat it with the sugar until fluffy. I then added the
pudding (I used banana cream, to give it more of a banana taste)and bananas. I alternated adding the flour mixture in with the milk and the little vanilla I added. 

It was easy enough to throw together with pantry items I usually have on hand. I don't know how it turned out as I made this as a thank you for my husband's co-worker. I'll update later about how she liked it.

WOW. I have tried a lot of banana bread recipes and this one takes the cake...or loaf as it were. :-) The only change was I used banana pudding -the instant kind as I couldn't find any non-instant banana. To compensate for the thickness I added more milk (buttermilk actually) about 1/4 cup. I also had to cook much longer -about an hour and a half total, covering after about 40 minutes so as not to burn. Next time I will try making muffins instead and see if that cuts down the cook time. A wonderfully moist, sweeter (which I like) recipe. A++

I made this exactly as the recipe is and it came out really good. My only problem is that I have a real old oven and I have to watch the baking time, so I left it in for maybe 5 minutes too long, but now that I know I'm making it again today and I'm sure it will be even better.

I can't leave well enough alone, so I made several changes right off the bat: I had instant pudding, so used that, only had 2/3 cup of smashed banana, so substituted PB for the remainder of the banana. I replaced 3/4 cup of regular flour for WW flour and used splenda 50/50 blend. Because of the WW flour, I had to add extra milk. It turned out really good, and I'm sorry I'm not rating the original recipe, but hope that someone can use some of my changes. It's a great base recipe. Be creative people!

Amazing! I made some changes as well.  I used Chocolate Pudding instead of Vanilla, I also used Kaluha in place of the milk.  Topped the whole unbaked loaf with more chopped walnuts and it was perfect!!  Deep rich color and exceptional flavor with these additions.  Enjoy!

This is a very plain tasting banana bread. I is not extreamly sweet and is not as dense as you would think banana bread should be. A good tasting bread but not special. I think if you add some vanilla and maybe some sour cream, a little more sugar and some cinnamon, it could be 5 stars. I'm going to try my tweeks and let you all know.

This is the first time I have ever made any Banana Bread. I changed up the recipe just a little and added Cinnamon to the Flour mix and after greasing the pan I sprinkled Cinnamon and Sugar around the sides and at the bottom. It tasted better than what I was going for. Thanks for this recipe! I will use in the future!

Love the recipe -- BUT--- I only had instant pudding.  I think it thickened up too fast, being instant - that it made the dough super super thick!  I was worried that it would fall flat.  Will use the regular pudding next time.  I also added pecans for flavour!

I've made this several times, always to rave reviews.  This last time I used coconut oil in place of the shortening.  No one noticed the coconut taste (I did in the batter, not in the bread) and it was fabulous.  I also used instant pudding, no nuts, and 3 overripe bananas.

I love banana bread and this is one of the best recipes I have come across! I used butter instead of shortening, so I reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp. I also used instant banana cream pudding mix and used 2 T kahlua and 1 T milk. I also added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. It was delicious!

This was great!  I changed a couple things...used instant vanilla pudding mix (tasted great), didn't have shortening so used butter (turned out well) and decreased the amount of salt since the butter was salted.  I really like this recipe and will definitely make it again!  Thank you!

When I decided to make these I thought that I still owned loaf pans.  My discovery t came at that crucial moment when I reached for them. I began to panic. It was not my intention to divert one iota from the recipe.  I thought I was facing a disaster in the making. I preheated my oven to 350, sprayed my muffin pan with Pam and cooked them for 25 minutes .  They came out great.

After trying several "basic" banana bread recipes and being disappointed at their blandness, I was VERY impressed with this recipe. It definitely makes a sweeter banana bread. I also used the 'banana pudding' like another reviewer did, which I felt gave it an extra kick. It was perfectly sweet and moist and delicious and I'll be definitely making it again!

Okay I totally messed this recipe up, I added all the dry ingredients together including the sugar, then when i got to the cream sugar, shortening part i realized that i had added the sugar to the flour mixture, uh,oh now what? So I decided to wing it from here, I had my 3 bananas in a bowl and i was feeling lazy so i mashed them with my mixer i didn't have shortening so i used unsalted butter and just threw it in with the bananas, I added 1/4 cup brown sugar as i said i was winging it, lol. then i beat it all together then I added an egg and then I beat it again then i added the second egg. I then added my banana mixture to my dry ingredients mixed it together with an old fashioned wooden spoon. I lined my glass baking dish with parchment paper (again too lazy to grease my dish) I then baked it for 1 hour at 350.
Absolutely beautiful and delicious! Amazing melt in your mouth banana bread! Golden brown on top and not burned on the bottom, Probably because i used the parchment paper. The best banana bread i ever threw together,literally!

I made this recipe into muffins and mini muffins for my kids to snack on. My son loves bananas and I had 3 left so I decided to try this out. This turned out sooo good. My kids devoured them! I only had instant vanilla pudding on hand and it worked out prefectly. They came out so moist and almost cupcake like. They went fast and now I have to get more bananas to make more for their lunches.

This was just ok. I have had much better. I had some left over sugar coated pecans from this website and I crushed some of them and added them to a half package of cream cheese with a little added sugar and spread between a thick slice...cut in half of this bread and that way....it was very good.

To get my bread done I had to cook 65 minutes. Even though I covered it with foil part way through it still turned very, very brown. Too brown. The inside had good texture and taste and I will try one more time with a bigger loaf pan to see if it will cook a bit faster and not brown so very much.

Very dense, just how I like my banana bread! Great recipe and easy to make.
The bread just needed some extra time in my oven, almost an hour and a half.

Best banana bread ever! Like others I did not have the non-instant vanilla pudding so I used the instant one and no problem! I added the nuts, and changed one Tablespoon of milk for Bacardi rhum - I am not sure that this added anything to the cake, so next time I will just drink the rhum and leave the cake with its own 2 Tablespoons of milk. The bread is very banana tasty and moist. By the way I did not measure the amount of mashed bananas, but I used 2 large very ripe ones and it came up great.  Thanks for this recipe!

This is by far the best, most awesome banana bread I've ever had!  I was making this for work and couldn't stand it any longer I had to cut into it.  I guess I'll have to make another loaf! I sure hope it makes it to work this time!

Came out perfect! The only change I made was exchanging shortening for canola oil and applesauce to lower the calories and adding a little bit of spices (cinnamon, nutmeg). It came out so moist and flavorful! This one is a keeper for sure!

This is amazingly good. We all like banana bread and the ones I've made before tended to be dry and not really liked by my kids. This one was moist, just sweet enough and tasted great the next day (for the three hours it was still there). The instruction to cover it at the end with foil is a good one, if you do that it comes out perfect. I will make this again, and again and again.

For a little change up use spiced rum in place of the milk.  It greatly enhances the banana flavor.

Great tasting, but the amount was wrong. A lot overflowed in the oven, WHAT A WASTE. It should have said for 2 pans. I wish I would have read the reviews first.

My husband is always saying he's never been a fan of banana bread, well this recipe changed his mind! He could not stop eating it. I used instant vanilla pudding mix because I couldn't find non instant. Absolutely love it with the pudding, gives it a cake like taste. This will be a family favorite to keep making! Thank you!!

This is an exceptional recipe!  It rose beautifully, was a very moist and light cake, and tasted delicious.  It is even better the next day when the flavors have a chance to meld!  I made it as the directions stated with the addition of 1 tsp. of pure vanilla extract and decreasing salt to 1/2 tsp., and then a substitution of instant vanilla pudding as others have stated.  I did add the walnuts, but I roasted mine at 300 degrees for 8 minutes before folding them into batter cooling the nuts prior.  This allowed for the enhancement of the sugary flavor in the nut.  The baking time was precise for mine, 50 minutes with an additional 15 minutes of baking time with the tinfoil on the top.  I'm not sure why this didn't work for others, but my oven temperature was adjusted to reflect the precise baking temperature.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I will be baking this bread for years to come!

I liked it okay. I thought it was yummy but I didn't think the texture was moist enough. I should have probably lessened the amount of flour the recipe called for.

I  this Banana Bread! The only change I made was out of necessity, I already had a hot oven (plus I keep a 14"X16" cooking stone on the bottom rack) plus used a 9"X5" loaf pan.
I baked the bread 60 minutes in a preheated 350F  oven but tented it with foil after 40 minutes & continued cooking.
It was sooo good, I'll definitely use this recipe again!!!

I've been making this recipe for close to 10 years now and it's still one of my favorites! I use cook & serve (non-instant) banana pudding instead of vanilla, and I actually LIGHTLY dust a little bit of the extra banana pudding powder on top of the loaf once I pull the loaf out of the oven for an extra kick of flavor. The only catch is that it takes a about 20 minutes longer to bake in my oven than the recipe suggests, but other than that this recipe is fantastic. One of my favorites to make when we have guests staying with us or to give out as gifts!

Edelicious! I use 6 TBSP Smart Balance butter substitute instead of shortening because it has less fat yhan shortening.  because of high altitude I add a pinch more baking powder to keep it from falling and being full of craters.  I  also recommend flouring the pan or using parchment paper for easy cleanup.  Overall great recipe!

Delicious. I don't think this was too sweet at all, I think it had a consistency & taste of a muffin-a delicious moist muffin.  I tweaked the spices-because I am a flavor fanatic, I threw in some pumpkin pie spice, too.  Also a TBS of imitation vanilla flavoring.  I also cooked it for an hour and ten minutes in a 13x9 pan, turned out fine.

I've been using this recipe for a while now and I'm never dissapointed!  Best banana bread ever!  The only problem with it, is it that we eat it too fast!  :)

It turned out great and the kids like it.  It is more dense than other recipes I've used.  I used splenda instead of sugar and made muffins instead of a loaf.  It's much better the second day when the flavors have a chance to set in.
