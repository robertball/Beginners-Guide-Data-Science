I never had the pleasure of eating gumbo until my sexy and talented cook of a boyfriend made this for me. This recipe is delicious as is, no changes made to the original! This is great on a cold fall day or during Mardi Gras! I love this recipe!! 5 stars!!

This was such a delicious dish!  However, the first time I made the roux, I burnt it (even though I followed recipe's directions).  After searching around the internet on how to make roux, I discovered it's not always the easiest thing to make.  When I tried again, I didn't cook it the full 15 mins as recipe says - I probably only cooked for 8 mins on medium (after having cooked on med-high for 3 mins).  Then, when I took off the burner to cool, I kept whisking for a while to ensure it didn't continue to cook without being stirred (running risk of burning).  So, for newbies like me, I would've appreciated more direction on how to make the roux.  But, I definitely still give the recipe 5 stars!!  It was SO good and is now a family favorite that we'll make often!

This was delicious for to be made in the slow cooker. I used butter instead of vegetable oil for the roux and I think that did the trick. I also didn't use cooked chicken, 7 hours in the crock pot was plenty of time for the chicken to cook so I didn't see the need. So good!

So good!  I used 2 cups chicken broth and 1 cup beer instead of water.  Added creole seasoning to taste with seasoned salt and pepper.  Also, instead of chicken I added cooked cocktail shrimp about 4 hours before serving.  Served over rice with hot cornbread.n yum!

My first experience with Gumbo and it was excellent . I had to use canned okra as no fresh was available. It was a little to hot for my taste, but I may have been a little heavy handed with the peppers.

I made this for our "Cajun Christmas Potluck" at work.  This was also my first time making gumbo.  It was easy enough to adapt to prep the night before so that I could throw it in the slow cooker in the morning before work. I put the chicken in uncooked so it cooked in the sauce to absorb the flavor.  I used chciken stock instead of the water and used frozen cut okra in place of fresh because that's all that I could find. Also, I subbed butter in place of the oil to make the roux (I don't feel that oil & flour could make a decent roux).  This went over very well at work and was disappointed that there was none leftover to take home to my husband to try it.  Definitely gonna make again!

Great recipe. I added a diced jalapeno for some more heat and bought file powder online to serve with it, and imo it just takes it to another level. 

Secret to roux, low and slow, and never stop stirring.

This was really good! I had some leftover Lil' Smokies from Superbowl and I had no idea what to do with them all. Well this recipe solved that problem. I browned the sliced up smokies really well, we like ours crispy. I followed the recipe exactly and DH wants me to make it again. (And I thought I was just using up leftovers with this one) Next time I will use some good smoked sausage, but other than that it stays the same.

I love this.  It was full of great taste and consistency.  I served it over white rice cooked with chicken broth.  This is a "do over".

Although I don't make gumbo often, I can't imagine a better one. We all had seconds, including my six year old grandson. I served it with scalloped sweet potatoes and apples. It was a perfect meal.

Amazed!  This gumbo was the closest I've come to a gumbo I had 20 years ago at a Thanksgiving (N.O. style) feast.  I've used Zatarain's gumbo mix for years.  I couldn't find it in the stores and decided to try this one (I always look for slow cooker recipes first). I am not a fan of okra so I used lots of carrots.  Other than that I stayed true to the recipe.  I tend to look for a balance of flavor in my meals.  This gumbo was just right. Even the cayenne pepper was perfect for my taste. Thank you for sharing. This was one of my best finds this year.

I love being able to use my slow cooker whenever possible. That being said, I was eager to try out a gumbo recipe involving a slow cooker. I followed the recipe for the most part, but I didn't precook the chicken. I cubed it, and threw it in with the rest of the ingredients. For the smoked sausage, I used Andouille, of course. The end result was good, but a bit bland. I'm not sure what it was missing. It was still good, and edible. The fiance was a bit disappointed in the vegetable/meat ratio, but he still managed to eat it. I'd probably try this again sometime.

It wasn't terrible, but the results were far from the type of gumbo I am used to. The only flavor there was to this was "hot."

Excellent recipe. I had leftover BBQ chicken that added an awesome smoked flavor to the gumbo. Thanks for the slow cooked version.

Absolutely delicious!! Like several other posters, I sautéed the vegetables before adding. I also used half chicken broth and half water for the liquid.

This was sooo good. I took other suggestions and used butter for the roux and it came out just right. I also used beef stock instead of water.

Waaaaay too much water! I doubled the recipe and didn’t even double the water amount (5 cups instead of 6 since I noticed it seemed like too much) and it’s still waaay too watery, much more of a soup than a stew >:(

This was worth the prep time and wait! I can't believe how authentic it tasted... So close to the Gumbos we had in New Orleans! I made a few changes based on what I had on hand and to give more depth of flavour: I didn't have celery but added a medium shallot, two bay leaves and a few whole allspice 'seeds'; and about an hour before it was done I added  a generous  handful of fresh shrimp (8-10 might have sneaked one or two before serving??)... Wowzers!!! Can't believe I made this myself. Think the secret is in getting the roux cooked just right, to get the rich deep colour and flavour... Also tastes better the next day, as flavours have had a chance to  intensify. By the way I didn't use any salt in this recipe. The sausage was salty enough.

I had never made gumbo in a slow cooker so I thought I'd give it a try. I would actually give this two and a half stars; it's not  bad, but it's only half good. It didn't have that true Cajun gumbo taste. Being a Cajun and taught to cook at an early age by my momma with her strong French accent , gumbo isn't gumbo unless you make a really good roux, and you can't make a really good roux in 3 minutes! Also, not enough chicken in recipe. I'll keep making gumbo the old-fashioned Cajun way and use my slow cooker for other recipes.

Awesome authentic gumbo recipe!  Finally a recipe with loads of okra, it's not gumbo without what gives it it's name, and NO tomatoes!  I've been doing gumbo in a slow cooker for ages and it's just as great as the traditional way.  My only changes are to nix the cayenne for file...Don't forget the file powder just before serving...we always do our own individually since it's loved in varying degrees.

This was very good.  It was nice to not have to 'babysit' the pot like with a regular gumbo.  I was able to throw it together before a party and still enjoy the gathering.   I did brown the ingredients before adding to the slow cooker.  I also upped the spice with Tony's and jalapeños.

I make this every year for Fat Tuesday!  I have made no changes to the recipe - I do not cook the chicken first, I cube it and throw it in the slow cooker.  I do add a bit of creole seasoning and always serve over white rice!  This dish is a hit no matter who I serve it to.  It tends to be on the spicy side, but we love that!

Made this using chicken breast, chicken sausage and a cajun seasoning blend.  Also made the roux fat free by baking a half cup of flour in a 400 degree oven in a cast iron skillet for 40 min stirring frequently until it is a even medium tan color.  Mixed flour with a half cup water plus a few tablespoons until a paste forms and added to crockpot.  Results were delicious and everyone wanted seconds.

But my family did not. I used a local Cajun sausage which did not hold together in "coins"

I had fresh okra from the farmer's market and most of the other ingredients for gumbo, so I decided to try this recipe! Of course I can't stick exactly to a recipe, so here's how I varied a bit... I used homemade turkey stock instead of water, I used about 1/3 bacon drippings, 1/3 butter, and the rest veg. oil, I sauteed the sausage and veggies in the oil to get a little bit of brown on them and cook out some of the fat in the sausage, and I don't like it spicy so I omitted the cayenne. I also cooked it on high for 3 hours in the crock pot. I poured it over rice, and it's delicious.

Gumbo...the best way to eliminate leftovers. I use this recipe every 2-3 weeks to empty the fridge.  I keep frozen okra on hand, always add the onions, garlic and usually celery, then add whatever vegetables and meats I need to get rid of. It comes out perfect every time.  I also add the peppers while cooking the roux and if there's time cook the okra to draw the juice (whatever you want to call the stuff inside that people hate okra for) out. This will thicken the finished product a little more. We love this.

I made some changes based on some of the reviews.

Instead of water I use 4 cups of chicken broth  (I added an extra cup as I was adding more things)
I cubed 2 large chicken breasts.. seemed more like 2 cups than 1.5 cups as the recipe calls for)
I did choose to lightly precook these with a few twist of the pepper mill and salt mill  (cooking things with out any seasoning is just evil in my opinion)

I sliced an entire smoked kielbasa (seemed more like 2 cups)

I added 7 enormous raw shrimp.

I used 2 bags of frozen vegetable gumbo mix instead of fresh.  

I used a teaspoon of Old Bay
and a packet of Sazon seasoning (http://www.goya.com/english/product_subcategory/condiments/sazon-bouillon)  I use the one with the salt but there is a no salt version for you healthy folk  :)

It looks good so far..  Can't wait for dinner  :)

K - so I made it it and it smelled great but it was to greasy and it was completely my fault.  The chicken stock I used needed diluted with some beer or water..  :(   IT was still VERY TASTY but next time I will adjust.. thinking 2/3 beer and 1/3 stock..

First time gumbo. It was ok but a bit bland. I will add some jalepeños and stewed tomatoes next time.

Good start! But as with any dish, be flexible! I added more veggies, like corn and small red beans, plus a dash of clove, allspice and some bay leaves. May use chicken broth next time. I served it over brown rice.

I rated this low because from all the reviews I expected it to be very flavorful, but I was really disappointed. I had contemplated added other seasoning than the ones in the recipe but I didn't and I really which I had. It tasted mostly like the roux which is basically flour. I didn't use celery because we weren't big celery fans but I did supplement it with some celery flakes. I also added 4 jalapeno peppers (which I recommend if you like a little more spice). I might make this again with major alterations.

I have made this many times and it is good as is, but not great. Ive learned to use butter instead of oil, chicken broth instead of water and double the chicken and it's perfect.
