This is just excellent, a wonderful alternative to pumpkin pie. I made it with a Truvia brown sugar blend. I halved the recipe since it's just my husband and me but I put in 2 eggs instead 1 1/2. This didn't affect the consistency at all; in fact, I added a 1 tablespoon more milk because the mixture seemed too thick. It turned out great. My husband loved it. We're planning to fix this for Thanksgiving  finally, a dessert low in sugar, nutritious, and low in over all carbohydrates. I'm so glad I found this recipe!

I had leftover pumpkin and made this. My family loved it! Better than a pumpkin pie and saved crust calories for the pecan topping. I substituted vanilla coffee creamer (the real stuff) for the evaporated milk. Making this again soon.

It was yummy! The nut crumble topping added a good texture and sweetness missing from pumpkin pie, and no soggy crust to deal with! I had to bake it at least 20 minutes longer than directed.
