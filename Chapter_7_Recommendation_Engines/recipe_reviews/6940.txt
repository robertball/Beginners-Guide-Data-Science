I thoroughly enjoyed this loaf, and it was so simple to throw together. I added 1/4 cup of chopped pecans for a little something extra(hence 4 stars instead of 5) but other than that didn't change anything. It was delicious and stayed moist for 5 days in a re-sealable bag. It may have stayed moist longer, but I ate it all! Thankyou for sharing with us!

WOW Very good.  We put in walnuts and a little cinnamon.  All most taste like a piece of candy.  Would make again with this recipe.

This was an easy and tasty bread!  I've never like fruit bread/cakes because of the red and green cherrie--so I omitted them kept the raisins, pineapple and added pecans--it was delicious--family agreed!  Will make this again!  Carol

This was so good!  I subbed fresh fruit for the dry but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I used fresh cranberries and chunk pineapple. Nice recipe that is easily made using whatever ingredients you have on hand.  Will make again. 4 stars due to the lack of vanilla extract this really would have benefited from.
