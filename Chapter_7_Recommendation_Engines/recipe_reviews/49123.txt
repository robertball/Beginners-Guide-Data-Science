This recipe is very very good. I just recommend using a injection marinade with it (may I suggest The Chicken and Turkey Marinade)the flavors of this marindae work well with the rosemary.  This produced the moistest breast meat. And gives flavor through out. I suggest marinating the meat the day before frying. Also make sure to put the rub b/t the skin and breast meat for flavor through the meat.

Good, but not fantastic.  I've made several deep fried turkeys and have found that injecting your turkeys with your seasonings gives it much more flavor!  Overall, very good and would recommend that you give it a try!

Great recipe , but added my own spin!  I have been using it for our fried turkey now 4 years.  I actually food process fresh garlic, Rosemary,and ginger with olive oil, salt and pepper and use that for the rub.  Then I cut fresh slices if Ginger, whole garlic cloves and sprigs of Rosemary and stuff all of that in the cavity & any open crevices.  I let it sit for 2 days.  I make 2 turkeys each thanksgiving, baked and this fried and the minute the fried is plated it's GONE!

There is only one word to describe this recipe, "YUM!!!!!!" I've used it the last 3 years for Thanksgiving and it's always a hit. I like the fact that it's goodness is in the simplicity; and the spices do well to blend the poultry flavor with the taste the peanut oil adds. This is the epitomy of deep fried turkey.

making it again this year for the family thanksgiving.  was a huge hit.  My husband used an electric fryer and forgot to take out the spices before frying.    maybe this just enhanced the flavor.

Once I applied the rub, something was missing.  I ended up adding dried crushed rosemary to the skin, both on the outside and under the skin over the breast.  I also applied a light dusting of paprika for color.  The bird turned out beautiful, moist and tender, with a nice aroma.  This is a solid blend that can be enhanced to your liking.

This was superb!  I was nervous how it would turn out because the smell of the ingredients were so strong...  The outcome just couldn't have been better!  I highly recommend this recipe!

This is grest, I happen to cook a lot with rosemary, and this was delihtful when I took a few loaves of rosemary sourdough and dried it and used it to make the dressing, after my training anything cooked outside the bird is dressing stuffing is for inside the bird, just a note on my chef's training.
