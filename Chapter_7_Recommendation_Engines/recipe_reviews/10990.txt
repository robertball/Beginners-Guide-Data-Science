Based on the suggestions of others I increased the flour to 2 cups and decreased the butterscotch chips to 1 1/2 cups. These were a HUGE hit amongst my coworkers this morning. P.S. Use a small scoop to drop the dough. They spread quite a bit when they bake. Also they're kind of like a candy/cookie hybrid so smaller is better. (You can have more than one if you like...)

After reading the other reviews I increased the flour to 2 cups and the resulting cookie was delicious.

These were very good first coming out of the oven per my kids but they were not too thrilled after they cooled. For me personally they are very very sweet but the kids enjoyed them when they were warm. It has been a few days and I still have cookies leftover which is not a good sign. Sorry

These cookies are soooooo good! I baked a pan of them with the recipe as is. I thought they had spread a bit too much so added more flour like the other reviewers had said. I should have tasted them first. I was very disappointed that I'd added the flour. Yes the cookies spread but if you don't overbake them they come out nice and chewy leaving me wondering if they are a cookie or a candy--a very good quality for a cookie named "chewies". Definitely don't add more flour!!!!! I was so disappointed with the flavor of them--they tasted like a toll-house cookie wannabe. And they were bland--too floury and maybe needed salt. I think the cookies turn out so differently for people because we all have different ovens of varying age and quality. Buy an oven thermometer and see if you are baking at the temperature your thermostat says.

The first time I used this recipes I found that my batter was extremely runny and the cookies came out somewhat flat. They still tasted good although a little too sweet. The second time I made this recipes I added more flour. (I don't know how much flour I actually ended up adding. I just mixed it in until the dough resembled chocolate chip cookie dough.) The second time I also chose to bake them in a cake pan and make bar cookies out of them. My coworkers absolutely loved these. I also made it without the pecans as some of my coworkers don't eat nuts. I would definately make this again but only with the extra flour!

These were OK. I had a package of butterscotch chips in my pantry that I wanted to use up. The cookies were very thin (which is OK) but way too sweet. I probably won't make them again.

Good cookie! I had to use a large toaster oven and the first set of cookies did come out a little flatter than your normal cookie but after that the rest of the batches came out fine. I don't think you need to grease your pan. Also the batter is wetter than a regular cookie one but I think that's what makes it chewier...It is called Butterscotch chewies after all! I guess you could put in more flour as I read another reviewer suggest but my husband prefers chewier cookies.

These cookies are yummy! Made them for a Cookie Walk that my son's school is having. I read other reviews and decided to add about 1/4 cup extra flour. They spread thin when they bake but that's what makes them chewy. They are Sweet so be prepared. I would make these again!

Wonderful!! I did take the previous reviewers' suggestions of adding more flour to create a very soft dough. I did not use the pecans but the cookies came out so flavorful. The smell in my house was just amazing!

I liked these cookies a lot it even got a thumbs up from the hubby who is very hard to please. i did add 1/4 c more flour and cooked at 10 mins instead of the 7-9. they came out beautiful. i'll probably play around with it some more next time i make them. this recipe is definitely a keeper though.

These are very yummy and extremely sweet. They stayed chewy for a week! I did add a bit more flour than it called for though. The pecans are a great touch!

Theese cookies were way too sweet for me. They also stuck to my teeth and were missing something. I added cinnimon and wheat flour to the batter after I made the first batch and that helped.

Maybe it's just my sweet tooth but I cut down on the chips because of others comments and I thought they could have used more. I am making them again for a cookie exchange this weekend and I will use the full 2 cups. Mine stayed soft until the very end. I thought this recipie was excellent and am going to regret giving 10 dozen away!

I used less butterscotch chips 1 1/2 cups and it was sweet enough. After a day they are not that chewy probably to the humid climate I live in.

A lot of butterscotch chips....but I do love butterscotch! Left recipe the same but found keeping dough chilled was good plus making them a rounded tsp keeps them from running together. They are so rich that I prefer a bit smaller cookie. Made 5 doz out of original recipe...love them!

I will admit I was a little concerned when I saw how much they spread out while baking. But there was no need. They were great! The kids loved them the babysitter loved them and my coworkers argued over them! I did add some mini chocolate chips to them batter and a little extra flour and I omitted the pecans. We are definitely making these again.

These were AMAZING! Usually, I don’t like butterscotch, but the cookie helps to tone the flavor down from too sweet to delicious. Like the reviews recommended, I added an extra half cup of flour. The batter didn’t look dry enough, but I went ahead and baked them for fifteen minutes and they turned out perfectly. Would make again!

These were so soft and delicious! I omitted the pecans because I am not a fan of nuts in cookies and neither was my audience for these. I will definitely make these again for sure!

so I am giving this recipe a 1 star rating. I tried to make 48 cookies. However the dough turned out far too moist. this meant that not only did the cookies melt together in the oven but they also got burned bottoms before the tops were even close to cooked through. I was very disappointed in these results. i recommend adding much more dry ingredients or just using a different recipe altogether.:(
