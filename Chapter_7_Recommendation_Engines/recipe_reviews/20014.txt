Great quiche!  I made a few small changes, but it turned out wonderful.  I sauteed some minced garlic with the onion & I didn't have bell pepper, so I chopped up some fresh spinach instead.  I put it in with the onions & garlic until it was slighlty wilted.  My husband & I don't care for the taste of nutmeg, so I omitted it & added a seasoning blend of red pepper, dried onion, basil...etc.  I normally would have used the swiss cheese, but I was also out of it, so I substituted fresh grated parmesan instead. I also suggest shredding the cooked chicken rather than chopping it, it makes for a nice texture.  The end result was delish!

This recipe has a really good flavor but I advise you cook it a little longer to get the consistency right.

I love quiche and have been a staunch fan of the ham/bacon and cheese variety.  This is both mine and my husband's new favourite!  Used sharp cheddar and mozzarella, and chilli powder instead of nutmeg.

Was easy for a college guy to make for his girlfriend's family. They loved it--it disappeared in like 5 minutes! I substituted zucchini for chicken, because, well, when you're in college, you just don't have one cup of cooked chicken hanging around. Still tasted GREAT though. Also added a sprinkle of chili powder along with the other spices.

Excellent.  I used the Easy to Remember Pie Crust from here instead of a purchased crust.  I didn't have green peppers, but I do have roasted red peppers, so I chopped up one of those as well as a few artichoke pieces.  I don't have fresh or frozen onion, so I used dried minced and then added some garlic in.  I brought it in to work and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  Didn't have green pepper so used fresh spinach instead...very delicious.  I plan to use this recipe frequently.  I think it would be good without the chicken too.

Very tasty and easy to make. I made my own crust rather than a frozen one. I added mushrooms since I needed to use them up, and used red pepper instead of green (just what I had on hand). I will definitely make this again!

I thought this was delicious, but I added 1/4 cup zucchini and 1 clove of garlic to the mix as well.  I think it's best to do the sauteing in a non-stick pan, otherwise when you add the flour it all just tends to stick all over the pan.  But really tasty, easy and a big time pleaser.

Tastes REALLY good. Prep was easy, too! I can hardly wait to serve this as an appetizer, at room temperature (flavor is best then), with a squiggle of red pepper puree. Yummy!

This Quiche was awesome. My family loved t. I did find that with the baking time, the quiche was completely cooked and lightly browned on the top, but the bottom of the crust was not done enough. Pre-baking the crust about 10 minutes was just enough to make sure the bottom of the quiche was nicely browned.

I made this recipe as written, except I didn't add nutmeg, because I didn't have any.  It was delicious and my picky husband and pickier 12 month old loved it.  Be sure to use a deep dish pie plate.  Next time I will add mushrooms.

Thank goodness I made two!!Sooooo good! We did use almost double the cheese and some very liberal dashes of chili powder but WOW was this great.Also, after layering the cheese/egg, chicken mixture fold them together it the shell... otherwise the egg just kinda sits on top. Pre-baked the pie shells so it wouldn't take so long. We finished up the quiche at 350 for for about thirty mins. Delicious! Will definately make again and again and again!

Wonderful!! I used Grandma's Secret Pie Crust, plain rotisserie chicken, roasted red peppers instead of green bell pepper, and chili powder in lieu of nutmeg. I put foil over the crust for the first 20 minutes to keep it from over browning. Delicious!!

not a big fan of quiche, always looking for one I would like and this is it!  Though I only used half the nutmeg, followed it the rest of the way.  Actually made 2 and froze the second one.  After thawing it cooked up beautifully with same cooking time as written.  Good flavors and taste, may vary and add a little more spice next time.  thanks for sharing this recipe.

I didn't care for this recipe. The only changes I made was I used tomatoes instead of peppers, green onions and colby jack cheese. After cooking for 20 min at 400, it took 90 min more to cook! Not 30 like the recipe says. And the nutmeg gave it a horrible taste.

Excellent change of pace for a Quiche.  I added broccoli and minced garlic and sauted with the onions.  Left the green pepper off.  Was very yummy.  Will definately make again.

I made this a couple weeks ago because I had some leftover green pepper and chicken I wanted to use.  I made it exactly as the recipe states.  My S/O loved it.  I made it again last week, only with leftover roasted veggies (red and yellow peppers, onions, and mushrooms).  Still delicious.

The nutmeg was not a good flavor and for whatever reason, mine took about 25 minutes longer to cook -- maybe due to using lowfat sour cream.

Tastey, good texture, no changes needed at all! I added 1 tsp garlic powder for fun, but could go with or without. :) Extend baking time at 350 to 40 minutes! (45 if you want it browned on top.) Wonderful recipe, thank you!

This was very good! I used a can of chicken instead of cooking my own, to make it go quicker. I also omitted the green peppers. Had to cook an extra 5-6 minutes, and it tasted excellent!

This was good, and fairly easy.  It fit perfectly in my pan and set up exactly right, which is rare in my oven.  I felt like the gruyere got a bit lost, but maybe that was the cheese's fault; I also found myself not entirely crazy about the chicken.  Most of the flavor here comes from the sour cream and cheese, which is not a terrible thing, but I was sort of hoping for more.  Thanks anyway!

Delicious. Worth keeping in your recipe box to make regularly. I usually make this day after roasting chicken (using leftovers). Prebake pie shell for 10 min.

This was great!  I substituted ham (I have so much leftover from Christmas!) and added a little dijon to the milk mixture.  I also omitted the nutmeg and added a sprinkle of ground cloves and cayenne, and used green onions instead of the onion and bell pepper.  Delish!

The nutmeg gives this recipe a wonderful flavor, and the sour cream makes the quiche so smooth and tasty. My only complaint with this recipe is that my pie crust wasn't completely cooked on the bottom. I sauteed a chicken breast with salt and pepper for the chicken component, and substituted the pepper for spinach. We ate this with extra sour cream on top for an added kick. I'll definately make this again with different meat and veg combinations.

This recipe was easy and  tasty. I omitted the crust as with most quiche recipes. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I found the consistency a little off, a little mushy. Maybe, I could have cooked a bit longer but the outer edges were quite brown. Really an OK recipe but not sure I would make again and not anything I would serve to company.

My husband really liked this, but I thought it was just ok.....maybe I am just not a fan of quiche.  I followed the recipe exactly except I increased the 1/4 c green pepper to 1/2 c (green, yellow, and red pepper).  I also increased the chicken to 1 1/2 c and baked it an extra 10 minutes.  I think it could be good, possibly better with ham.

We didn't care for this one.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, except for using spinach instead of green pepper.  When I added the nutmeg, it smelled strange to me so I added just a dash of chili powder.  That helped the weird smell somewhat, but the resulting dish was still pretty bland.  It was okay, but I won't make it again.

Made this last night for the family after the Packer game, big hit and really easy to throw together, would highly recommend it, has a lot of possibilities if you wanted to add mushrooms or spinach...........

My family really liked this, but I didn't follow the recipe exactly. Once I was ready to cook and took a close look at the ingredients, I decided it needed a bit more substance. SO...I added carrots and celery, more chicken, a bit more flour and nutmeg to compensate, and one more egg. There was only one small piece left and there are only 4 of us!

This was great! I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9 x 13 baking dish, using my own crust. Next time I think it would tasty to use green chilies in addition to or in place of the green peppers. This can be very versatile.

For vegetarians (who won't eat poultry), I've made a similar  Sour Cream TUNA Quiche for years with a couple of variations.  Instead of chicken, use 9 oz. canned tuna, drained and flaked,  1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup sour cream, no flour, no nutmeg and no green pepper.  Use 1/2 cup sharp Cheddar cheese, 1/2 cup Mozz. cheese (instead of Swiss), 1/4 t salt, 1/4 t pepper. Into this mixture,  stir 1/2 of a 6 oz can (3 oz) French fried onions (instead of using chopped onion).  Sprinkle the remaining canned fried onions on top of the quiche before baking. Preheat oven to 400 degrees and pour ingredients into an unbaked 9" deep pie shell.  Place in oven and immediately reduce the temperature to 300 degrees.  Bake 1 hour.   A family and potluck favorite!

Excellent recipe.  The only actual quiches I've made before have called for mayonnaise, so I was really pleased to see this one using sour cream.  Substituted light sour cream, added spinach and two cloves of garlic.  Also made a veggie one with broccoli, spinach, tomato, crushed red pepper flakes and some mrs dash original blend, with parmesan cheese in place of cheddar and swiss.  deeelish!  Thank you

I make a very similar quiche...and will make this tonight...updating this review after that.  I generally add mayo instead of sour cream but as I have sour cream presently that I want to use up this looks good!  May add a bit of tang to it...I use it in cheese cakes and it works out well so I dont see how it wont work out with this. I generally mix up my quiche with whatever veggies I have on hand in a shredded form to insure they cook evenly, a couple cheeses, 3-4 eggs since there are eggs in mayo as well it is ubber creamy and a touch of milk.  It would also have chopped onion, salt, & pepper as in this recipe.  So not that different.  Then i can just vary the rest of my seasonings by whatever I have put in it...am I going for an Italian taste? Mexian?  whatever...have even mixed tune into my quiche mix.  Worked out great.  Cant wait to mix this up with the sour cream!!!! :)  I am positive it will turn our awesome!

This was delicious! I didn't use as much nutmeg as it called for mainly because neither I nor my husband like nutmeg. It turned out great though. Would definitely recommend.

Simple and delicious, can't get any better than that. I made this recipe with a couple small tweeks and had no left overs for 5 people.  I used light sour cream omitted the nutmeg. Every time I serve  this, hubby asks for it to be made for often.

This was a great recipe!! I added fresh spinach in place of green bell pepper, shredded the chicken and used Greek yogurt because I did not have sour cream. Kids and hubby loved it!!

So tasty! Just made this last night for the first time and already have a request to make it again. To give it more color and veggies, I added a layer of blanched broccolini on top of the chicken. Everyone loved it, including my six year old.

I made this with chicken, spinach and artichocks in the filling. no onions, peppers or nutmeg. I used different cheese. I did use 2 eggs, 3/4 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup half and half.  It was very good.  Better the next day heated up.

This was okay.  I swapped out the bell pepper for a small can of green chiles and the nutmeg for cumin.  I guess that I expected the end result to be simlar to my sour cream enchiladas, which it wasn't.  However, when eaten with salsa it was pretty good.  Unfortunately it wasn't quite good enough to make again.

My sister and I both made this recipe on the same night and rated it ourselves together.  We made it exactly as the recipe is written and both felt that it needed something to make it a little more savory.  All in all kind of bland, so next time I'll play around with the seasoning a little more.  Will make again, though.

Although this was easy to make and looked beautiful coming out of the oven, for my taste, the flavor of the sour cream was not good.  I rarely use sour cream in anything, but thought this might be an exception...not.  I will not make this again.

I made this recipe last week for my husband and I. The only modifications I made was add more cheese because I didn't think there was enough cheese added. I only gave this recipe a 3 because it didn't taste the best for me personally. I would recommend only 1 egg, not 2 eggs. The quiche looked like an eqq quiche when it came out of the oven. Be careful when making this recipe because it is possible you may burn the crust to get the center cooked evenly. I probably would not make this again because the ingredients didn't seem to go together.

This recipe was great.  It was very easy for me to customize it for my family.  I have come up with lots of ideas to change this recipe up.  I usually don't like making quiches but this has me itching to make more.

I didn't think this recipe lived up to the rave reviews that it received. It was just okay. I don't like Swiss cheese--so perhaps that's why I didn't care much for the dish. It was just lacking in flavor--very bland. I was looking for something with a little more pizazz. I'll keep looking...

This was good. Surprisingly, I liked it better the next day. I used a rotisserie (sp?) chicken from the grocery store to save time. All I had to do was peel the meat off and cut it up. It probably took only 5-7 minutes.

Absolutely delicious!
My WHOLE family loved it.  Me, Husband and kids ages 5, 9 and 14.
I just wish I had made 2 of them.  I will do that for now on because we ALL wanted seconds.
P.S. I made my own pie crust from another recipe on allrecipes.com instead of a bought one.

Very good, pretty easy prep too. I omitted the green pepper and added broccoli to suit my family's tastes. Next time I think I will add more sharp cheddar as it wasn't cheesy enough for my tastes, also might cut down on the black pepper. Anyway we had no leftovers!

I made several quiches to try out for a bridal shower and this was our least favorite - just too "sour-creamy" and not enough flavor.  I made it as written so maybe it would be better with changes.

I did not have all the ingredients.   substituted regular chicken for precooked southwestern chicken about 2 cups.  Because of this I did not use the nutmeg I just didn't feel the nutmeg would go with the southwestern chicken I had on hand. I used picksweet 3pepper onion blend. I used cheddar cheese and some queso quesadilla cheese and about 1/2 cup of cream cheese. I also added garlic and 2 extra eggs to make two instead of one. Instead of layering I combined all the ingredients together. I also used homemade pie shells

I love this recipe. I make it quite a bit for dinner since I saw it here a couple of years ago. YUM. I use rotisserie chicken but sometimes I will use just plain chicken and season it with a little bit of beer can chicken seasoning.  
I do use a deep dish pie crust (frozen). Not big on making pie crusts :) 
If you like quiche, you will like this recipe.

My husband loved it.  I made some changes based on knowing my husband's preferences and availability of ingredients.  I used ham instead of chicken, upped the sharp cheddar to 1 c and used 1/2 c parmesan instead of swiss cheese.  Instead of nutmeg I used cayenne and red pepper. Cooked 30 min at 400 and then covered edges of crust and cooked at 350 for 20 min.

If you add tomatoes as one person did., it's going to add a water content to the quiche!
Perfect just the way it is!

This worked out quite well. I made some changes ( added bacon and tomatoes as well as the chicken, onions and peppers) I also added a third egg, and broiled it for two minutes at the end ( helped the top get a nice golden look)  I used a homeade pie crust ( whole wheat flour, shortening and water). Definitely going to save this one to try again. :)

I've made this several times. It's super yummy. I follow the recipe exact, except I leave out the nutmeg (not a fan of nutmeg). It drives me nuts when people make a bunch of changes to a recipe and then give it a bad review. I don't think it's fair. If you follow the recipe and then still dislike it, then review it. Consider the fact that all of your changes are more than likely the reason it didn't turn out well.

This quiche is delicious! It was also incredibly easy to make. We'll be making this again soon!

This was pretty good for not having had quiche in a very long time.  I gave it a 4 because I'm not a huge fan of onions and this was to overpowering with onions.  Next time I will leave them out.  I did had family that went back for seconds.

My husband and I loved this, but my kids did not.  Will make again, though.  Very rich flavor.
