This was so good! I did add a full 16 oz can with juice of pineapple chunks,per husbands request. It was so tender and juicy, with so much flavor!
I canâ€™t wait to make this again! Thank you for this delicious recipe!

No changes, ham could have been more juicy and pull apart than it was ~ may need a smaller ham for slow cooker next try
