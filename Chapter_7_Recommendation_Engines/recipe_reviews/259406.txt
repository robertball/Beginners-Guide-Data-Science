Made this on Christmas and it was very enjoyable to cook and a hit among guests. I would suggest 9-10 cups of spinach (to bring out  more flavour). Otherwise, this was very YUMMY and CREATIVE!

This is very good. Once rolled though, it definitely needed more than an hour to set in the fridge. I just made it again with 5 hours in the fridge and it was much better.

It was a hit at the Christmas party I went to. Several people asked for the recipe. I only used one red onion instead of two. That was more than enough

Made the recipe as written and it had way too many red onions in it! I could hardly taste anything but onion.

It was delicious except too much filling to properly roll into pinwheels. When I make it again I will put approximately 1/4 less ricotta & really squeeze out more water from spinach.  It was really good but very filling! Yumm! 4 stars.

It was way too wet and too much filling for just one puff pastry. I won't be making it again.

I never used puff pastry before and it was a disaster. Followed the directions but the filling was too wet and the rolls made of the filling and pastry fell apart. This looked so cute in the picture,  wish it would have turned out like that.

Just made it. Itâ€™s great. I think it will turn out better next time. I made the roll and kept it in the fridge for several days.
