After reading the reviews I made some changes. I added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, one cup of half and half. Also I used half a cup of Motts Applesauce and half a cup of Motts Cinnamon Applesauce  I found that the pudding had a very nice moist content and really good flavor. I will make this again. Thanks

There are just 2 of us, so I halved the recipe and baked it in 4 ramekins .  I used store bought cinnamon raisin bread and ended up adding another slice.  I actually think I could have added one more, next time I will. I wasn't thrilled with the topping as is.  Like others said, some butter would make it better. The flavor of the bread pudding was great! I finished it off with a brandy cream sauce.

The streusel ingredients threw me off because I'm use to cutting in cold butter for streusel toppings. I prepared as instructed and it's worth 3 stars as it because it was okay.

I added 2 more slices of bread to the recipe to thicken it up, changed the brown sugar amount to 2/3 cups, and added 3 tbsp melted butter to the bread mixture. I cut in 2 tbsp cold butter with the streusel ingredient which made a beautiful and thick topping. 

The Mott's in this recipe was a really nice flavor add and I think with the changes its a 4-5 star recipe. It taste better also when reheated after the flavors had a chance to meld together.

As is my norm, anytime I make bread pudding I use left over bread, therefore I reduce the recipe to accommodate the bread I wanted to use.  I used a combination of Tuscan and Orange/Cranberry bread.   Both breads are dense, so I allowed them to sit in the mixture for about 5 minutes to absorb the liquid mixture before baking.  I do recommend adding some butter to the streusel topping, because it was too dry and chewy for my liking.

As-is, the recipe was a bit lacking.  Our bread pudding experience involves rich, dense, buttery goodness, so I made some significant tweaks.  We started by making this gluten-free with gluten-free cinnamon raisin bread and gluten-free oats.  I added cinnamon and replaced the brown sugar with maple sugar in the custard mixture.  For the topping, I added almond flour and butter as well as nutmeg.  To take this over the top, we baked it in an iron skillet that had been prepared with melted butter.

We REALLY like this one!   I am sure it had everything to do with the fact that it was a bread pudding.   I have ALWAYS loved bread pudding and this was such a nice variation of it and STILL, it was a true bread pudding!

Of the couple of times I did make bread pudding, I remember it being dense and very sweet. This recipe is the opposite. I suppose the apple sauce takes the place of some of the fat and sugar in the classic recipes for bread pudding. I followed the recipe, for the most part, but I did add a splash of vanilla and dash of salt to the egg mixture. Even sweets usually have a pinch of salt. I used a walnut raisin bread I made in my bread machine. The walnuts were actually a nice addition. The topping also didn't come together, like I know crumble toppings to do so, so I ended up kneading in 2 tablespoons of softened whipped butter. That definitely helped. I was wondering why the main picture didn't show the topping, unless it was optional. I ended up filling 6 oiled ramekins with 2 #16 scoops of filling and 2 tablespoons each of the topping. It divided perfectly. When done, I liked it best slightly warmed with a little whipped topping. I think vanilla ice cream would be a nice compliment also.

I didn't have cinnamon raisin bread, just some twelve-grain leftover, so I used that with a handful of raisins and added 1tsp cinnamon to the mix. I also added the 1/2 tsp vanilla that someone recommended. My applesauce is homemade and had no extra sugar or spice in it.  Otherwise, I made it the same as the recipe.

I found I had to bake it for 45 mins at that temperature. I also found the topping just OK with dry oatmeal sitting on top which was a bit weird. Maybe it would be better if I had done as some suggested and dotted it with butter or margarine on top. It tastes good (sort of like a muffin but with a bread pudding consistency), so I would try it again as I made it with the topping change.
