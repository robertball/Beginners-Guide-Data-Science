01-05-16 ~ A dinner I knew my husband would love.   I made as written, but halved the recipe and it still made a lot.  The nachos get soft when baked, as I knew they would.  The next time I'm going to layer the meat and beans first and they the nachos, hoping they will stay a little crunchy.  I served this over shredded lettuce with diced tomato and avocado slices.  DH loved the leftovers, reheated in the toaster oven.  This is a dish I would make again.

Quite the misnomer being that there is no lasagna, but delicious.
