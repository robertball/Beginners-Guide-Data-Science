Everything didn't seem to go together well.  The crumbs and cheese on the tomatoes stayed together in clumps.  Would be best to save some of the pasta water to mix into the pasta and tomatoes.  Would NOT make again.

This was just okay, nothing to write home about. I question where the 31 grams of protein are coming from?  I read labels, and consider myself nutritionally intelligent.

Excellent recipe and very easy to put together.  It's even better when made with home grown tomatoes!

My husband and I stayed at a vineyard in Tuscany a few years ago and one of the evenings we there we had this dish, one of the best pasta dishes ever!  This dish is exactly like it and because it doesn't have meat in it you don't feel that "too full" feeling....room for dessert!

It was absolutely fantastic! I didnâ€™t have any stale bread and used breadcrumbs instead. 
I also used a little ground red pepper.

while there's nothing better than tomatoes plucked from the garden, I've had good luck with heirloom tomatoes in a simple recipe like this. They need to be cut up coarsely and roasted per the recipe. I add a splash of red wine vinegar a friend makes in Italy.
