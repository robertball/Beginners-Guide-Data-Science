Here is what I do when I make these: After toasting the bread, I then spread the condiment (my family each have their favorite: sweet mustard or mayo, etc.). Then I top with shredded lettuce and mild banana pepper rings then the onion, ham and swiss. Then toast again. We love the zestiness of the onion and the pepper rings with the smooth cheese.....the ham and shredded lettuce, mmm mmm good. When we have tomatoes in the summer I add a slice of those, BUT, that makes the sandwich watery (& very tasty)!!! (We just dig in and keep a napkin close by - so worth it!) A pretty healthy sandwich that is just bursting with taste!
