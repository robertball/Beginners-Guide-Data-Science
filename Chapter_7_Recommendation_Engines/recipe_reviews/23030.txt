I went the lazy route here, and used my Kitchen Aid mixer.  The butter tastes great!  Also try adding Strawberry Preserves, or Cinnamon & Sugar.  They make a yummy butter, and go great over toast or bisquits.  For those of you who have never made homemade butter, it takes some time.  You will first get whipping cream, and then the cream will start to form chunks.  Beat until the butter forms one large chunk, and the butter turns a light yellow.  There will be leftover buttermilk, which you can save for later use.  IMPORTANT** After draining excess buttermilk off of the butter, rinse the butter in cold water.  Get as much of the excess buttermilk off as you can.  If you don't do this, the butter will spoil in the fridge.

I have used the jar method before, but I find that if you pour the cream in a deep bowl, you can use your mixer to beat. I would start out on slow and increase as it thickens.  When it goes to whipped cream, I take some out for toppings.  When it starts turns into buttermilk, I save it to use on pancakes.  Then keep beating until it turns to butter draining all the liquid.
Make sure you start out slowly or else it will splash all over.  This way is a lot easier and less tiring.  Thanks for posting this DD.

I've been making this since I was a kid.  If you drop something solid into the container like a clothespin, the solids stick to it and it reduce the shaking time.  I sometimes add different spices or fruits like applesauce for over french toast or put it in butter moulds to make it fancy.

I think the recipe should have mentioned that after you make the butter, you need to "wash" it to remove all of the butter milk, or it will spoil.  My mom taught me to wash butter by draining off the milk liquids, then running COLD water into the jar and pressing the butter with the back of a spoon to release pockets of butter milk trapped inside of the butter.  It takes several washings to get it completely clean.  If you are eating all of the butter within a short amount of time, washing is not so crucial.

I remember making this as a kid in my second grade class. It is so fun for kids. I remember adding salt like some of the others have said. 
Also, since it is so hard to shake it that long, here are some tips:
If you are using a plastic container, add a marble or two and the process will be a lot faster. 
If you are using a glass container you can use a marble if you are really careful, but it can break the glass. I have used about 5 clean paperclips instead and it works well in a glass container. 
Just remember to fish out the marble/paperclips when you have your butter!!!

I'm actually amazed that this worked.  I shook it for about 20 minutes, while my husband just stared at me as if I were strange ;)  It tasted just like unsalted butter, now I know where to turn if I'm ever in a bind!  Thanks DD!!

Boy did my arms get tired!  I gave up and finished it in the Kitchenaid -- I had butter in about 30 seconds!  I added a bit of salt and served it with freshly baked biscuits.  A great way to use up leftover heavy cream.  The kids enjoyed watching it turn from "milk" to butter.  I can't believe how it even turns yellow.

This was surprisingly easy. I added a dash of salt. This actually turned yellow, which I thought was cool. Any time I have heavy cream to use up I would definitely do this again. Oh, and to make things really simple, just shake the cream in the unopened container.

No great mystery  here.  When I was a farm kid in the 1930's - 40's, the butter churn was a standard utensil in the kitchen. It was a square tub, about three gallons, with a lid and a crank on top, from which a shaft with paddles went down into the left-over cream.  We had six cows. A youngster could produce, in about 10 minutes, enough butter to last for several days, and some buttermilk to drink.  Most of that went to the pigs. Later, when most of the older kids were gone, we just shook some cream in a quart jar until it "buttered".  No big deal.  Now: BIG DEAL !

I did this for some pre-schoolers I was watching during "farm week." They got kick out of it! We put the heavy cream in jars with marbles, which makes it much faster, and sealed it tight. I made sure they had something good to put it on. I had warm barnana bread, just baked, and they each spread their own slice with butter and loved it! However, if you are not doing this with kids a kitchen aid mixer will be much faster. The cream will go from the whipped cream to butter stage in a matter of minutes. ty

Bring the cream to room temperature!!  I leave my on the counter up to 12 hours, the longer the better in fact...something about the reactions going on will make the butter better and will also make butter WAY quick (like 4 mins of shaking).  Add a little salt before shaking.  Drain the buttermilk off (use it for pancakes or biscuits), add cold water to the jar and shake.

I love making butter this way and so do my kids. We add a pinch of salt to the cream before shaking it up. :-)
It's so fresh tasting!

I've been making this with my kids since they were toddlers.  It's a thrill for them and the butter is so fresh-tasting.  You can easily reduce the amount of cream if you don't want to make as much butter.

I used a 1/2 pint of heavy whipping cream in a pint jar. Shake time was only 8 minutes. I also kneaded the butter blob with a pinch of sea salt on a tilted dinner plate to remove additional butter milk. Yielded a little less than a stick.

Great idea. Never knew you could do that. Only problem is, if you have leftovers and refridgerate overnight. The butter will harden, then it will but just as to soften as it is to make.

I operate a daycare and for our Thanksgiving Feast I hand out washed out baby food jars, poor in heavy cream, add a marble, close lid tightly, secured with duck tape, and turn on dancing music! After a few songs they have their own personal butter!  Very fun!

Wow!  I can't believe this worked!  It was so easy, well, my arms are pretty tired, but relatively easy anyway.  And, it tastes so good.  I thought it wasn't working and was getting discouraged, but I checked it, and there was butter!  Thank you so much for this simple recipe!

Who would have thought making butter would be so easy!  People were very easily impressed that I had made this and it took only one ingredient and a lot of elbow grease.  It has a much lighter more pleasant flavor.  A definite do-again!

I never realized how easy it was to make butter.  It took about 1.5 cup of cream to make 1/2 cup of butter.  I added a tiny dash of salt and about a tablespoon of honey.  Fabulous!  I'm going to have to make some bread now to go with this awesome butter!

My grandmother made her butter this way.  She had 10 children so there were always plenty of people around to shake the jar.  It tastes great and is fun for the kids to make.  They always look amazed when the butter starts forming after shaking the jar or container.  You can use a Kitchen Aid Mixer but where's the fun in that?

AMAZING! I will be making this from now on instead of buying store bought butter with mysterious ingridients. I added a tablespoon of honey and a dash of salt and it was delicious.

This was an absolute hit at Easter.  I had "heavy whipping cream" left over from another recipe, and it worked great.  I poured the cream into a bowl and beat the living daylights out of it with a hand blender.  I strained it about twice, and then blotted it with paper towels before the final 'beating'.  I added a little salt at the end.  It wasn't quite as yellow as I imagined, and it looked more like whipped cream cheese.  The flavor and texture were the bomb.

I just made this recipe and  it came out great!  I used a mixer to speed up the time and it was very fast.  I poured off the buttermilk and gave some to my cats and they loved it! lol!  I will definitely be making this again!

Fun, fun, fun! So many times I've not purchased cream because there would be so much leftover. (We drink our coffee black). But NOW I have something great to do, and since the nearer to expiration date it gets, the more readily it can be shaken into butter (with that fabulous bit of REAL buttermilk as a side benefit), I'm one happy lil' ol' milk maid. And the MAN is thrilled (or should be), too, since I made biscuits by supplementing the buttermilk with some yogurt for the full amount needed, and then we topped the biscuits with this yummy butter!!!! Whoop!

I can't believe how easy this was. I also went the kitchen aid route and had butter in no time. I think I 'll stick to this and stop buying all the mono-unsaturated concotions out there.

It doesn't taste quite as good as real butter :( I salted mine, but I guess I didn't add enough salt for my tastes. It's creamy and tasty, but it DOES require a lot of effort to shake it til it becomes butter. Note to everyone considering this recipe: Cool whip containers aren't airtight. Mine kept leaking. I will use a canning jar next time.

Great to add food colouring to cream - makes nicely coloured for parties etc.

Also great to add dried herbs to whipping cream - favourites include dill, mint or cinnamon/sugar.

This butter turned out wonderful. It’s tastes so much better than store bought and was even less expensive to make. Two thumbs up.

This took forever to make but man was it worth it. My boyfriend now doesn't want to buy store butter ever again. The only problem is until we get our own cow this way is more expensive because of where I live whipping cream is through the roof. It took over an hour of whipping it with my hand mixer.  But in the end got rave reviews! And now I know what to make for him as a treat!

This was easy to do. I did watch several videos prior to making this & I'm sure that helped. I do agree with Hyemama, it's not very cost effective unless you can get inexpensive cream. In the meantime, I'll just be making this as a treat.

Perfect!!! Made this right after a freshly baked loaf of bread.  Tastes great - brings back memories of my mother's home churned butter.  Thank you DD!
