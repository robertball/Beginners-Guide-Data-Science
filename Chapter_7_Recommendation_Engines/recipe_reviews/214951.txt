This is a family favorite that my mother used to make and now I've been making for years. I usually make 1 1/2 recipes of this and bake it in a 9x13 pan.  We also spread the frosting on the cake right out of the oven and then broil it till bubbly.  Delicious!

I have been baking this cake for many years but instead of baking powder I use 1 tsp. baking soda.  Also the icing should be heated for about 3 min. then poured over the cake as soon as it is finished baking, then return cake to oven for 5 minutes.  It's a great treat.

I am thinking there is an error in this recipe. All other sites I see this recipe and indeed the one passed down to me by my mother has 1 teaspoon not 1 tablespoon of baking powder. The one tablespoon seems a bit much for just one cup of flour. I make mine with 1 teaspoon and it works well! done with 1 tsp of BP I give it a 5. 
venisonfurs, this might be why your cake overflowed.. too much baking powder

i'm over 50 and this is the VERY FIRST cake I ever made (I was 5) and it was with my Grandma Bessie in DeQueen Arkansas!!!  i have two granddaughters that live with me, that love to cook and bake and I can't wait to make this with them very, very soon.  I'm so happy to have found the recipe - THANK YOU!!!  (I actually don't remember making it with coconut but I love coconut and Grandma was simple in her baking pleasures and very, very frugal (from the depression era, ya' know so I doubt she ever bought coconut!  Fortunate, I love coconut and will certainly follow this recipe!)

Overflowed my 8 inch cake pan in the oven and started a fire. I should have used 3 8-inch pans, but the recipe says 1 pan. Needs to be clearer because this cake is amazing, my grandmother used to make it.

I make this all the time from a similar recipe (most have more topping than mine, so I may try increasing the amount I make) but the one major difference--and I think it may be a typo--is that I only use 1 teaspoon of baking powder, not a tablespoon.

This is a favorite for our family and always requested for pot lucks and BBQs with friends.  I double recipe and make large pan 9X13 - also add topping on warm cake and broil for few minutes.

This is an incredibly moist, delicious cake.  Easy to put together and variations possible.  I added some drained pineapple to it one time and it was quite good.  Thinking of adding some toasted pecans too.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is a keeper, the only thing I changed due to the fact I had no heavy cream, I used whipping cream instead.  Cake is very moist and fluffy.
