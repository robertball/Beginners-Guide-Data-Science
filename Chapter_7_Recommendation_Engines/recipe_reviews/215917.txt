I was skeptical about combining Salmon + Alfredo + Cheese....but once again I'm delightfully surprised with a new recipe that will find its way into my rotation of winners.

Very yummy!  Perfect as is, but I splashed a little balsamic vinegar on mine and it was phenomenal.  I used the four cheese Alfredo, worked fine.

Really good. I'm still learning to cook, so this was good and easy for me. I didn't have the right spices, so I substituted Oregano and Cilantro (eyeballed it). I wish there was a recommendation for which kind of vinegar works best - i used half apple cider vinegar and half rice, and it turned out nicely. I also used salmon from the can - no fillet.

Needs a little bit more sauce and you dont need 6 oz of parmesan cheese, otherwise its pretty good and very simple and quick to make.

This was a quick and easy meal, but honestly, just okay.  Nothing overly special in my opinion.

My 2 little boys (5 & 7) loved this! However, I'm only giving it 4 stars because it's really missing a color-element.  I added a cup of chopped, frozen spinach (microwaved on a paper towel) into the final mix and it was so much more appealing and healthy.

This was another option for ways to fix salmon, and it worked fine. I did use fresh basil and parsley.
