It was so good that I adapted the recipe just for my gluten-free friends. They LOVED it!

I liked this a lot more than I thought I was going to - it's a pretty great combination of flavors, and a nice light drink for a fall evening.

It was okay but I found it a little sweet even though I used a dry cider, one that I don't normally find too sweet. I used Pumpkineater ale from Howe Sound Brewing in Squamish BC and No Boats On Sunday Cider from Andrew Peller Limited in Truro, NS.
