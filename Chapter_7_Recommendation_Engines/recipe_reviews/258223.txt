Great sandwich with great flavors however I probably won't make it again. Wondering why? My carnitas go in tacos.

I had some random carnitas in my freezer and not a big pork fan. I was looking for a fun recipe that wasn't the traditional tacos and this wowed my tastebuds! kids didn't like it, but me and hubby will try again!

I used what I had left of some "tamed "  jalapenos. Should have when to the store and got some regular jalapenos or at least more tamed. Other wise these are gooey gooey good!

I had leftover pork roast and this recipe showed up in an email. I decided to try it even though I didn’t have avocado or cilantro. I also only had honey wheat bread, no Texas toast. It was so delicious I definitely will make again. It’s a flavor bomb. I can’t wait to try it with avocado. I could only eat half a sandwich though but is very rich and heavy.

1,111 calories in one serving! Of course it's good! If I only eat 1 meal today then this would be it, with a big bowl of green veggies with no oil.

This was really good...we used some fresh bakery buns, cheddar and mexican blend cheeses we had on hand.  Next time I will get pepperjack for more spice.  I hope we cut a few calories with low fat sour cm and mayo...

I loved this! I didn't even have an avocado, but this sandwich was awesome! I had to use regular wheat bread, but it was still awesome. I made this for myself when my husband wasn't home, and I felt guilty that I tried this without him.

These sandwiches were very tasty, rich and filling.  I made only two, using Simple Carnitas by Ken from CA from this site.  The list of ingredients was pretty much right on the mark, but I found that I was running out of shredded cheese for the second sandwich on the outside.  The first one I made I used a lightweight pan for the grilling of the sandwich, but it didn't work as well as the second one that I did in a heavier iron pan.  With all the ingredients in the sandwich I found that the thick bread was perfect to hold it all together.  We are happy campers tonight!  Thanks for our dinner!

This is an great way to use leftover shredded pork. Not a diet food obviously but tasted AMAZING!
