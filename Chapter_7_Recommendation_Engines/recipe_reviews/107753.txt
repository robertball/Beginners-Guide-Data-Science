I was very surprised, this was much better than expected. It kind of tasted like apple mint juice and had a minty green color. I have a juicer, but don't use it anymore due to it removing too much of the fiber. To make juice in my Vitamix blender, I have to just add water. I made 1/3 of a recipe and used a frozen chopped peach because I didn't have fresh. I added the peach, 1/3 of a peeled sweet apple, 1/2 cup of water to turn them to juice, some mint leaves, and a tsp of lemon juice due to not having lime juice. It worked fine. I blended for about 1 1/2 minutes, or so, until it resembled a juice and everything was completely emulsed. I oddly felt the jump of energy notated by the recipe submitter.

Using really ripe and flavorful peaches is essential for this in my opinion.  It's a great juice, and I can't wait to make in the summer with fresh mint from my garden and fresh peaches from the farmer's market.  It's definitely a keeper.  Oh, and it's great with a slice of fresh ginger in it, too!  Thank you for this one!  I love it.

This is a unique combination. I do not have a juicer, so I used my vitamix. I like that the fruit maintained the nutritional value and fiber. Mine didn't turn green from the mint, but did provide a little bit of refreshment.
