This is AWESOME!  LOVED IT.  Not something I would cook a lot but definitely something I would cook when comfort food is needed.  So simple yet so good.  Used regular whipping cream since that's all I could find and it was delicious! I forgot to thaw out the corn before mixing all together but I was still able to mix it by breaking up the frozen corn.  Also, this only needs to cook about 2 to 2 1/2 hours otherwise the part against the side of the crock pot starts to burn (and my corn was frozen to start with).  Use a crock pot liner and cleanup will be a breeze, especially with this recipe.  I want to try this with low fat half and half, or lite cream to see how good it is to lower the fat content so I can make this more often.  Will post the results. My whole family loved this. Definitely will be making this again. Thank you for sharing Kymmie.

Hi Ziyanda, I never tried it with meat, I would think that any grease would impact on the cheese holding together, feel free to experiment and let us know your results! Thanks for the tip Kiyena! I always have the burnt edges but I like to eat them :)

Trying it for the first time tonight, I will def let you know what I think of it!  One question, is there anyway to add some ground beef to this perhaps?  Or some other meat to add that heartiness

I gave this three stars because for flavor I would give it four but for texture I would give it two.  I followed the recipe exactly but it still separated into lumps.

Good recipe.  My store didn't have shredded Swiss cheese so I used Monterey Jack/cheddar and it turned out fine. I made this for a potluck and it went over really well. I think I'll be making this again.

I made this for Thanksgiving yesterday and have to say it was great! It may not have been as thick as I would've liked but this may have been a result of using 4 more ounces of corn than it said in the recipe though I'm not sure. The flavor reminded me of something else but couldn't place it. Still tasty regardless!!!
