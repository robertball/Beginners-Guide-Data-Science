I have to admit, I never made this recipe with the pasta, as instructed.  Instead, I made the potato/cauliflower portion as a vegetable side dish for my last dinner party.  I honestly cannot say how good it is with penne, but I can say that the potato/cauliflower portion was an excellent side dish!  Everyone at the party raved about it, and it also made yummy leftovers.

This was really good. I would probably not use quite so much olive oil next time -- just a taaad less. I only made the cauliflower and potato portion of this, and didn't have onion or rosemary, so it was modified slightly out of necessity. But I would definitely recommend.

I chopped up regular white potatos and found that the initial cooking left them extremely underdone.  I increased the heat to 475 for another 30 minutes and then added the cauliflower.

I made this for the first time tonight and it was a hit! I only had russet creamer potatoes so I used those instead of Yukon gold potatoes. They tasted great and added a little colour to the dish. I also didn't have any fresh herbs, but dried worked fine! (I probably could have added a little more for a stronger flavour.) I will definitely be making this again and again for our family!

Excellent!!  Our young children gobbled it up and asked for seconds!  Great way to get good veggies into kids!  We used whole wheat pasta too!

In the 3 serving version.
The ingredients list 3 Tbsp of oil, yet in point 2 in the directions 1/4  cup of oil is described and in point 3. we drizzle with the remaining oil. Where do we get the remaining oil? I ended up chosing my quantity.
I am confused as to how much oil is to be used, total. I would give 3 stars for the end product but no star for the recipe description.

I modified this recipe a lot..basically took the main components and turned it into a soup.  Used onion, tomato paste and chicken stock.  Pretty tasty stuff!
