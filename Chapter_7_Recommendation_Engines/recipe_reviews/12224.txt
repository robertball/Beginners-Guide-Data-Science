What an awesome recipe! This was the first key lime pie I've ever made, and it turned out fantastic! The second time I made it, I used fat-free sweetened condensed milk - big mistake - it was 'pasty.'  I also reduced the amount of lime juice to make the pie a little firmer, and wished I hadn't - it didn't have enough lime flavor.  The third time I made this, I reduced the butter by 1 Tbl., and used only 1/4 cup.  I liked that much better.  Don't be afraid to bake it the entire time, as that's what makes the filling firm and not runny. Note that this pie tastes much better the next day.  Also, I liked increasing the crust ingredients per Ina Garten's recipe on FoodNetwork to 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar, and 6 Tbl. butter - makes a larger crust that is easier to work with, before and after baking.  Note that you will need approximately 15 key limes + 1 regular lime OR 8-10 regular limes for the required amount of juice.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

If you are looking for something light, fluffy and delicious- this is it! I used 1 1/2 cans condensed milk; 2/3 key lime juice; 3 jumbo egg yolks (no whole eggs); and folded in 2 whipped egg whites. I added 1 ounce of lime jello for color and extra flavor. Wonderful! (I did not freeze it.)

I only got a tiny taste of this pie which i made for my father in law, who is a key lime pie lover. He said it was the best keylime pie he's ever had. It's hard to beat my mother in laws cooking, but she called ME and asked for the recipe! I'll make this particular recipe for him every year. It's quick, simple and got high marks with the family.

After hearing other people saying that the filling was not enough for a pie, i decided to double the recipe and it was delicious. I put lime peel in it also. If you don't want to waste the egg whites, make a meringue otherwise, it was good without the whipped cream.

I had no trouble w/this turning out smooth and silky.  I did make the crust.  I had a 9.5 inch pie dish so I just crushed up one entire package of graham crackers and added an extra Tbl spoon of Butter and little extra sugar to the crust mix and it turned out fine!  I didnt bother letting it cool in the freezer as long as the recipe suggested.  I pulled the finished pie out of the oven, let it cool for about 30min, popped it in the freezer for 1hr, then I topped it w/cool whip and placed it in the fridge and the texture/temp was just right!  I will make this again for sure!

Very nice recipe.  I thought the taste was just right.  I wish it was a bit thicker though - maybe I will add more filling next time.  I made it in a springform pan and that helped with getting the pie out.  I always detroy pies when they are in the traditional pan.  I enjoyed it frozen and just chilled in the fridge as well.

Fantastic, stupendous, outrageous, scrumptious!  I made this for all my girlfriends.  It was a huge success, and I only ate the crumbs.  I was unable to get real key lime juice, so I substituted 1/2 lime, 1/2 lemon.  It was awesome.

This is a nice and light key lime pie recipe. I used to make key lime pie with egg yolks only and it was much heavier and more custardy. The first time I made this pie I didn't freeze it and the filling was too soft (about the consistency of whipped cream - light and fluffy but didn't taste like a pie). Now I always freeze it to make it firmer and I serve it right out of the freezer. The texture is perfect - exactly what you'd expect for a key lime pie but without all the extra egg yolks. It's a great recipe for summer since it's cold like ice cream. I wouldn't recommend using this recipe if you don't plan on freezing it.  I also chose to use a pre-made pie crust because graham crackers have high fructose corn syrup while the pre-made pie crust does not.

This is a fantastic pie. I first made it for a baby shower and it was a hit. I used a bit of green food coloring and a bit of finely grated rind from both a lemon and a lime for some added zing.

Excellent Key Lime Pie. The first time I tried this recipe I substituted the key lime with lemon/lime juice, and while still pretty good, doesn't compare to the second and subsequent times I've prepared this pie using the authentic key lime juice. One thing I'd like to add for everyone commenting on the color, it isn't supposed to be green! A true key lime pie is yellow, so please don't feel that you should be adding dye to an otherwise lovely pie.

I'm not sure if this is how key lime is supposed to taste, but it really wasn't what I was looking for. The whipped egg whites gave it an airy, foamy texture. If you're into that kind of thing, it definitely is a good recipe. I was looking for something a bit more smooth and creamy. I wouldn't make this pie again.

PERFECT! I could not find "Key Limes" so I used 2 Limes and 2 Lemons and it gave me 1/2 Cup and turned out PERFECT...my guests could not believe I didn't use real Key Limes. 

I topped it with a "Sour Cream Whipped Cream" i found on this site...was a perfect match. (3/4C whipping cream, 1/4C sour cream, 1/2-1tsp Vanilla, and 1/4C conf Sugar *i used less sugar*)

i have made this pie many many times. Everyone loves this pie. it really is the best key lime pie i have ever tasted. The only thing i change is that i need more grahm crackers. I use about a 1/2 cup more. i also add another tablesoon of butter to the crust. The only problem ive been having recently, is that the crust sticks to the bottom. i have tried many ways, but i cant seem to make it not stick. but the crust is what makes this pie so amazing im not going to change it :) definately worth the hassle. id like to address the reviews where people were saying this pie was light and airey. It is not, i dont know why your pie was doing that, but mine always come out smooth and creamy.  i dont use fresh lime juice, i use key lime juice from a bottle that i buy at the grocery, ive never tried it with any other kind of lime juice or fresh limes.

Well, you may think it strange that I am rating this 5 stars when in all honesty I didn't even take a bite.  But I entered it in a dessert contest that had LOTS of entries and it won 2nd place (and was subsequently devoured before I could get to it).  So, with that feedback and the the raving I heard from the judges (amazing! perfect tartness, etc.), I feel comfortable giving it 5 stars.  I made more crust (as one reviewer suggested: 1 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup sugar and 6 Tbl butter) but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  I am going to make another one and keep it for myself:-)

This was a great recipe, and I got rave reviews.  I actually used a store-bought Graham cracker crust to save time (and also because I had read the reviews about it being difficult to get out of the pan) and it was fantastic.  Very easy to serve.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent! I used 1/4 c. lemon and 1/4 c. lime juice since I couldn't find the key limes here in Ohio. I grated some rind from both and sprinkled a little on top of each slice along with the whipped cream... beautiful presentation, great flavor, highly recommend this recipe!

This is a great recipe - the best Key Lime Pie we've had.  My only problem with it was that the crust was really hard to pry out of the pie dish so the presentation of the slices was a little messy.  But it sure was tasty!

Great recipe! Two things though...the crust turns out a bit thin, so it is best to double the recipe, and I added a tablespoon of sugar to the topping to sweeten it up a bit as it is a little bland on its own.

This pie was really really good.  I made it as my husbands birthday cake and thankfully I made 2 (doubled the recipe) because he ate a whole one himself in just over a day.  And he is not a big eater usually.  Key lime is his favorite and he REALLY really liked this pie.  I liked the fact that it was baked just a little.  I know the eggs supposedly cook in citric acid but I still feel better cooking even if it is only for 15 minutes.  The pie set beautifully and looks beautiful.  I added 1 drop of green food coloring just to push the color from yellow to green.  I also added the zest of one lime and I could not find my cream of tartar so I omitted it.

This is great!  Lots of zing and just the right amount of sweetness.  Don't over do it in the oven though, I did the first time and it got all puffy and ugly - but still tasted good.

Delicious!  I used a premade pie crust.  Like another reviewer, we liked the texture better refrigerated, not frozen.

I used a premade graham crucker crust so the recipe was very easy and only took about 5 minutes and then cooking time.  My husband whose favorite dessert is key lime pie said that it was very good and gave it 5 stars.

The pie came out great. I don't have access to "key limes" or "key lime juice" so I used 1/4 cup of Realemon and 1/4 cup of Realime. I added a pinch of salt to the juice - it is listed in the ingredients, but not mentioned in the directions. When I make the whipped topping I add a tsp of vanilla extract and 3 tbsps white sugar. Next time I make this I might add a drop of green food colouring when I fold in the egg whites.

It was very good. Thanks. However,I did not know where to add the pinch of salt. And, after freezing it, do you serve it immediately?

This is absolutely the BEST key lime pie recipe out there.  I have tried it with a prepared crust, but the homemade graham cracker crust really is the best.  I have served it at many dinner parties and it's always a big hit.  People that have never liked key lime pie have told me that they love this one.  Thanks for the recipe!

Whipping the egg whites results in a lighter more airy texture which isn't the traditional key lime pie I was expecting.  Compare to other similar recipes and you will note they don't whip the egg whites.

Made this for my boyfriend for his birthday! He loved it... and even though he was full.. he had more! The amount of filling was perfect! I might use a few more graham crumbs, a little more sugar, and a bit more butter so that the crust is thick enough!

Everybody loved this pie. Out of the eight pies I made this one definitely went the fastest. Super easy, too. I've tried key lime before and have a hard time having them set up, but this one was perfectly firm. Yummy!

Great pie - filling could be a bit lighter.  I added more a bit more whipped egg whites to the second one I made and it was delicious.

This got rave reviews at our house!  We were given a basket of key limes so I was able to use fresh squeezed lime juice.  I cut a corner by using a pre-made graham cracker crust.  I'm sure homemade would be better but the filling was so good it made up for it.  I had to bake it a little longer than called for to get it to set up.  I pulled it out of the freezer while we ate dinner and it was perfect to cut for dessert.

What a great recipe.  Unlike other key lime pies I have made, this one is really light, and it lets you enjoy the flavor without making a sour face.  I used a 1/2 cup of lime(regular lime) and a 1/4 cup of lemon and the flavor was perfect.  I also didn't put mine in the freezer, just in the fridge until it was time to devour.  Another nice touch is fresh raspberries on top or puree them drizzle on the plate.  Keylime and raspberries is a classic compbo!!

Good and tart.  Almost foamy in texture. It doesn't say what to do with the pinch of salt so I added it when I added the cream of tarter.  I don't know why you would freeze this unless you wanted to keep it for awhile before you served it because it's much better in the refrigerator and the crust stays together better when it isn't frozen.

Fantastic. Very cool and light dessert. This is the first time I've made or eaten key lime pie, so I can't compare it to any other recipe, but I would definitely make it again. Also, it should be noted that if you want your whipped cream to taste more like the store-bought kind, you'll need to add some sugar and vanilla to taste.

I made this yesterday using the half lemon juice and half lime juice.  It was excellent.  I froze it overnight and transfered it to the fridge in the morning,  so it is a great make ahead dessert.   It was a perfect texture by late afternoon.  I will make this again.

As other reviewers said they had problems with the base I decided to use my own recipe. The filling turned out fantastic. It was flavoursome (not too sweet or sour) and had a beautiful consistancy - almost cheesecake like. I didn't put it in the freezer, just in the fridge and it was fine. A very easy to prepare and inexpensive dessert!

At long last I am here to Thank You Irene -I've been making your recipe for 6 months now on demand.  I have also used strictly lime juice and that version has now become the most requested.  We find only a 1/2 cup of whipped cream is all we want on a 9 inch pie.  Easy and delicous.  Thanks

This was the first Key Lime Pie I've ever made and it turned out really good.  My 5 year old daughter just loved it!  So did everyone else.  I added a few drops of green food coloring, too.  Very pretty pie, until my daughter stuck her fingers in it to taste it!  Thanks Irene!  Great recipe!  By the way, Irene, are you by any chance related to Leonardo DiCaprio?

This is a lighter key lime pie, not as dense as most. You basically get all of the flavor without much of the guilt, which is perfect. I'll definitely be making this again! My notes on the recipe: I made some adjustments to the crust as well. I eliminated the sugar, and like other reviewers, I reduced the butter to 4T, or 1/4 cup. For the rest of the recipe, I followed the directions as written, except I added 1 tsp grated lime zest. I allowed the pie to cool for 30 minutes before placing it in the refrigerator for an hour. I then froze the pie for one hour before serving, and the consistency was excellent.

Made this yesterday for Easter and it was absolutely fabulous. I made it exactly like it called for...just put out on the counter about 45 min before eating to dethaw. I also added a bit of green food coloring as I don't like the "yellow" color or key lime pie.

Everyone loved it and said it was the best they ever had! Will definitely be making this again!

Not my most favorite, but it was good.  It was a bit too cheese like for my taste.  Not so silky & creamy.  Good lime flavor though.

Oh my goodness this was good!  All tasters rated it a keeper.  We couldn't wait to try it, so we had some on the same day it was made, and finished it off the next day.  There was unanimous agreement - wait until day 2 to eat it.  As others have said, the flavor is much better if you have the patience to wait!  Thanks for the recipe!

This pie gets invited to more parties than I do!  It is absolutely delicious-- rich and refreshing at the same time. I suggest the following changes: bake for 30-45 minutes, and remove from the oven when the center is still wobbly (like a cheesecake). Let cool at room temperature (the pie finishes cooking as it cools), then refrigerate overnight-- do not freeze! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a delicious key lime pie. The addition of the egg whites makes this pie particularly creamy. I may use a tad less lime next time.

This was perfect... served it with whipped cream from a can and fresh blueberries.  I'm not looking for another recipe!

Wonderful, true to Key West, Key Lime Pie!  This is the first recipe I have followed to a T from allrecipes.com.  I usually have to add/delete something to make it more appealing to me.  Anyways, delicious dessert!

i know the freezer thing seems weird - but you totally have to freeze it - it is awesome!  The whipped topping isn't even really necessary!

I've never liked storebought key lime pies, but it is my father-in-law's favorite so I made it for his Father's Day celebration.    I used bottled Key Lime juice (Nellie & Joe's brand) and added a little bit of ordinary lime zest.  Just a pinch.  I found the crust ingredients to be insufficient to press into my 9" pie dish, so I added 1/4 cup more graham crackers and a little more butter and sugar to make it fit better.  I totally overbaked the crust before I even got started, but the filling was delicious and the flavor was very good.  It was not too sweet at all.  For the whipping cream I used 2tbsp powdered sugar, but next time I'll use 3 to sweeten up the topping as a contrast to the tart limey filling.   I think the people who say this tastes like condensed milk are probably not using good limes or lime juice, because it did not taste overly sweet at.  We got the thumbs-up from my father-in-law.

Maybe I'm doing something wrong, or maybe I'm not used to "real" Key Lime pie. It wasn't "light" to me at all - too rich for my tastes. I couldn't get over the fact that I was essentially just eating eggs, condensed milk and lime juice. Doesn't sound appetizing when you put it that way - haha. Maybe I'm a wuss, but I'm going to try again later with pudding or something mixed in to give it more substance. Also - after only a day or so, it started "oozing" which looks REALLY gross.

Loved this!  I made it for my dad, who's a huge pie eater and he thought it was terrific!  We aren't big on graham cracker crusts, though, so I used a homemade pastry pie shell I prebaked.  I used real key limes, and the flavor was excellent!  Next time, I may try just using lemons and see how good that turns out.

My local grocer does not carry key lime juice, so I used a mixture of lemon and lime (probably 1/4 to 3/4 ratio), and the flavor was quite good.  I loved the mousse-like texture!  I used my own pastry crust rather than a graham-cracker crust.  I made it for a party, but very few people even tasted it.  The next day I served it to my family, and they were unenthusiastic.  I loved it and had really hoped for rave reviews!

I made this for my a family gathering..  We all love key lime pie and have had it at most restaurants that serve it..  My husband said it was the best he has ever tasted!  It was a huge hit!  I added grated lime zest, used a lemon and a lime for the juice, and added pureed raspberries for a sauce to go with it for color.  It was so good!!!

I made this for a New Years Eve dinner party.  I followed the directions as stated and I had a major problem with the crust. It froze to the pie plate bottom and I could not get it out without ruining the pie.  The filling was fantastic though.  Everyone one loved it even though it did not look the greatest.  I may try it again to see if I have better luck.

Excellent recipe. Very easy and tasty.  The only
thing I changed is that I don't freeze the pie,
I refrigerate it, I think it has a nicer texture
that way.

I have never tasted key lime pie so, I am in no way a critic here. But, I will admit to one truth, this came out wonderful and my family loved it. It was light and had the perfect amount of tang, loved it! I have never even seen key limes or juice in our area so I mixed half lime with half lemon juice like a few other reviewers suggested. I also had to let it bake for about five minutes extra. Other than that, I followed it perfectly and we all enjoyed every bite. Thank you for sharing! (Also, to those who are key lime pie experts, if all you want is the real thing then I suggest you plan a vacation instead of reviewing a recipe like you are Gordon Ramsey. These are simply recipes to try at home, not a contest).

This is an awesome pie! I couldn't find key limes so I used 1/4 cup lime juice and 1/4 lemon juice. For the whipped cream I used 1 cup heavy whipping cream, three tablespoons of powdered sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla (my favorite whipped cream recipe).  It was very light  and with lots of citrus flavor. I also used a prebaked crust and had no trouble getting out of the pan. I found it needed about 18 - 20 minutes to cook to firm up. It cooled for an hour then I put it in the freezer for two hours before we ate it. I think the firmness was from the extra cook time rather than the freezer but either way it was delicious. I would definitely make this again!

My husband is crazy about key lime pie, and this one made him very happy! It is delicious and easy to make. The only labor-intensive part is squeezing those tiny limes, but if you do that ahead of time, the rest of the pie comes together quickly. Highly recommend!

My husband lived in Florida for many years and is a key lime pie aficionado. I have tried many recipes over the years, and none have succeeded, until now.  I used a regular pie crust instead of a graham cracker crust, and I also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 3 tbs of powdered sugar to the whipped cream topping.  He is absolutely thrilled!  Thanks IRENED for the recipe!

Closely resembles the frozen key lime pie at the Lime Inn on St. John USVI. Even with storebought graham cracker crust and canned whipped cream, we thought it was excellent. My family likes it fully frozen; I let my slice defrost a bit first. We prefer this lighter texture over the typical custard.

This is a great pie to make when the pantry is low and time is of the essence. It's light, pretty, and tastes great. Cut the calories by finishing with non-dairy whipped topping, or modify by adding coconut to make this recipe your own.

Fantabulous! Easy and yummy! I took KRANEY's suggestion about the crust and it turned out great. Also i used 4 egg whites instead of 2, and used a little more the 1/4 lime juice and little less than 1/4 lemon juice.  It was just marvelous!  Thank you so  very mcuh for sharing the recipe!

Made this for the first time for Thanksgiving. It was well received, everyone ate a piece, but it wasn't a 'lover' of anyone. Everyone loved the homemade crust, but the lime was a little to overwhelming. We weren't able to find the key lime juice anywhere, so ended up squeezing a bag of fresh key limes (very hard and tedious due to their size). If you want it to be the traditional green, make sure you add dye in the batter, otherwise its yellow. If it wasn't for hand-squeezing the limes, it would've been a very easy recipe.

Very good taste, had a mousse-like texture as opposed to denser traditional key lime pie (due to the whipped egg whites).  This was a great light treat for a hot Southern day!

I used low-fat ingredients for this pie (despite reading a couple of comments that warned not to) and I thought it worked out wonderfully.  Fat-free sweetened condensed milk, low-fat butter and reduced fat graham crackers.  Still a great consistency and a good flavor (use freshly squeezed limes) and makes this desert pretty reasonable in terms of fat/calories.

Wow! Ive tried almost all the key lime recipes on this site and this one by far is the best!!! I followed the directions exactly and also added some key lime zest to the mixture. Also, in a regular pie shell comes out great as the graham cracker shell. Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe.

This was a wonderful reminder of summer days when we ran into a winter sale on limes and decided to make a pie!  We used a frozen pie shell (precooked it as we would have with a cream pie) instead of the graham cracker crust.  We used a bit of corn starch instead of the cream of tarter.  Also, we kept it in the oven until the crust edges were brown.  We did pop it in the freezer, but couldn't wait the full 4 hours.  It was absolutely delicious!

This pie was wonderful!!!  Key lime pie is my favorite pie but I had never made one from scratch.  The recipe was easy and it tasted out of this world. Everyone said how refreshing it was. I followed the recipe exactly and everyone couldn't believe this was the first time I had ever made a key lime pie!!
Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Really good! I made the following changes though. 1 and 1/4 cup graham crumbs with 1/4 cup butter for crust. Didn't add sugar. I couldn't find key lime juice so I used the 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4th lime juice (wasn't fresh. was from those lemon/lime shaped squeeze plastic bottle.) I also added about 1 teaspoon grated lime peel an sprinkled extra on top. Sweet with good lime flavour! I cheated on the whip cream and used dream whip. I would make again.

YUM!!  This is the best key lime pie I've ever had.  Its perfect.  Not too tart, just right.  Make sure you make your own crust.  I bought a pre-made graham cracker crust (Keebler, I think) and it wasn't good.  I will definitely make the homemade crust next time.

I have eaten this pie 3 times made by various cooks.  Everyone who tries it loves it and wants the recipe.  Even the  inexperienced baker had an excellent result getting rave reviews.  Everyone followed the recipe obsessively.  The only think I noticed is there was a difference in the "lime" taste between the pies despite each using the same amount. No one used key limes and so I think some limes have different intensities than others. In any case this is an awesome pie and everyone who tries it loves it.

Great recipe!  I used a homemade pastry crust instead of the graham cracker crust.  It turned out delicious.  I served it at a family gathering and they all stated it was a great pie, and we should know...we are all from Key West.

A fine recipe, just not my preference... It was fluffy rather than creamy; not as dense and satisfying as I would haved liked, although it had good flavor.  I enjoy "liminess," so I added a few drops of lime juice to the whipping cream and garnished w/ lime wedges. It is quite yellow, so if I were to make again I would add a drop or two of green food coloring to enhance the lime illusion!

This keylime was awesome. It was light and fluffy - just like I like them. I got raving compliments when I served it at Easter dinner. This one will definitely be made again in our house! The only change I made was the crust - I bought a pre-made pastry crust instead of the graham cracker crust. And I would bake the pie a little longer - it didn't set up quite as well as I would have liked.

This pie is delicious!! I found a bag of key lime pies at the store and squeezed them by hand to get 1/2 cup of juice.  I used 3 egg whites instead of 2 and the pie turned out perfectly light and creamy after coming out of the freezer.

A tart and tasty pie that impressed my father-in-law who currently resides in Fl. I made one small change using a pastry crust instead of graham crackers which worked just fine (bake crust first). Overall an excellent recipe.

My first attempt at Key Lime Pie - Delicious!!!! My father-in-law is usually very conscious of his calorie intake but he was the first one with an empty plate! It's a big hit! I'll treasure this recipe.
I used 1/4 C juice from lemon and 1/4 cup juice from regular limes. I also made homemade whipped cream with vanilla and sugar added to heavy cream.

I loved this recipe.  The beaten egg whites really lightend up the pie.  I used regular lime juice and the juice of one lemon (all from our citrus trees).  I also added lime zest to the filling.

This is the Key Lime Pie recipe to use! I've made it a couple times and it just makes your eyes want to roll into the back of your head, it's so good! I froze it once & refrigerated once. The frozen one thawed before it was eaten so refrigerating should work fine. Perfection!

UNBELIEVABLE.  So easy, so delicious.  The perfect dessert to take to someone's summer pool party or gathering.  Lime zest adds taste and looks nice too.  Homemade whipped cream and crust really DO make a difference!

I made this for my Dad on Father's day. The man knows his Key lime pie and weeks later he was still talking about this recipe!  
I used a pre-made low fat crust and cool whip as a topping and it was as good as everyone else makes it sound. The pie is fine if you have to freeze it for less time. I believe mine was in the freezer for no more than 2 hours.

The pie turned out delicious. I made a regular pie crust blind baked it off and did add about 1/4 cup extra key lime juice.  I will be making this pie again cause every one loved it.

I went with six tbsp butter and brown sugar in the crust. In the pie itself I also added 1/2 cup of sour cream to smooth out the initial tartness of the key limes. I also add in the zest of about 5-7 key limes however in a pinch the zest of two regular limes will do as well. I make mine in a 10.5 in springform pan so i usually have to double the recipe to get it to even out. I've been serving this at my kitchen for the past few weeks now, in Florida.  All the locals love it and I'm getting asked for the recipe constantly from other chefs in the area.  Great pie here, and thanks.

It is delicious !  Light and tangy with just right amount of sweetness .  Not a rich pie like no-bake condensed milk recipe yet very creamy, smooth and fluffy.  I followed exactly it says and I baked it twice.  Both came out the same.  Really good Key Lime Pie recipe.  I will treasure it.  Thank you!!

Amazing! It worked so well and my family thought it was delisious! The gram cracker crust tastes great with the texture is smooth but thick. I would advise you to use this recipe for parties or just a desert at home.

Decadent and rich!!  I made tartlets in muffin pans and the turned out beautifully!!  I cut the sugar in the crust recipe down by 1 tablespoon to keep the sweet factor down to balance the custard.  Beautiful crust, buttery and caramelized nicely contrasting with the tart sweetness of the smooth custard!  Yum.  Made it for friends after a Gumbo dinner and it complemented nicely!!

Pie has the delicious, distinctive key lime flavor. The filling texture is very light due to the egg whites being folded in. Would like a creamier filling so will try the recipe that uses only the egg yolks.

Excellent! The only changes I made were to use more graham crackers in my crust and I did not use melted butter, but softened butter. This makes the crust much easier to work with and gives a nicer all around crust. Anyway, beyond that I made it as written (using bottled, real key lime juice). My husband is a key lime pie addict and absolutely loved this pie!

I followed this recipe completely as written except the pie crust. I followed another reviewer's suggestions and used 1.5 cups graham crakers, 6 T butter, 1/4 cup sugar. 

The pie comes out very fluffy and has an awesome texture (if you like fluffy pies!) but is extremely tart!! I've never really had key lime pie before, so I don't know how tart it's supposed to be. 

Some other reviewers stated there wasn't enough filling for a 9" pie pan, but I guess with the thicker crust this isn't a problem because mine filled up to the top perfectly and did not overflow. I ended up baking it for about 16 minutes.

This was my first key lime pie and it was delicious! I used an already prepared graham cracker crust, and for some reason the bottom of the crust got too moist and didn't want to stay intact when cutting the pie and removing it from the pan. Not sure how to combat that. But the pie was super yummy!

Yes, this is a great recipe! The first key lime pie and I have no need to look further. It is simple, light, fluffy, perfect level of tart and sweetness. I used a premade graham crust, and whipped cream from a can and it was delish! Next time I will add some fresh lime zest as well! Also I didn't freeze the pie but for a few minutes prior to serving for easier slicing.

This was a nice key lime pie.    It wasn't stiff or jelly-like as some Key-lime pies are, so I enjoyed it.   I did find that the lime flavour was not as strong as I would have liked. Perhaps in the future I'll add some grated lime to the pie.   Great recipe!

I've made a key lime pie before and it was too dense for my liking so I knew I'd probably like this fluffier recipe. It tasted a little too sour when I chilled it in the fridge overnight after baking. But after freezing it the next night, it was perfect! I also added some coconut cream to the whipped cream on top and it complemented the lime flavor nicely. I'll definitely make this again and again!

Oh My! Oh My! SoooGoood!!!!  So Easy!!! I'm not much of a pie maker but I had several limes I didn't want to waste so I found this recipe, had all the ingredients in the pantry and I'm so glad I made it.  The only thing I did was also add the zest of 1 lime with the lime juice.

This is probably one of the best key lime pies I have ever had. I used fresh key limes and if you can find them, I would highly recommend using them even though they take a while to squeeze. It was a huge hit at my house!

I have been looking for this recipe for a long time. Great taste and just the right amount of tartness.  Very easy to make.  I guided my 10 yr old granddaughter in making it with very little help.  Best without the whip cream to enjoy the key lime flavor.

I've made this recipe several times now and EVERYONE loves it.  I've even had debates with people from Florida and Key West on how this recipe rates with "real" Key Lime Pie from Key West.  I think this pie comes out lighter, in comparison, and personally I think it is better than the other "custard-like" Key Lime Pies I've had.  It is simple and comes out fantastic every time.  Served cold or frozen is the best!

I find making the graham cracker crust makes the pie even that much better than the store bought pie crusts.  

This recipe helped snag my current boyfriend (he's from Florida :)

Not enough lime flavor, and too much condensed milk flavor even when I added less. However it would make a pretty good pie with a few slight modifications.

I made this pie, based on the reviews of others.  It was the first one I'd ever made and turned out great!  My In-laws thought it was the best pie she'd ever had.  I would definitely use this recipe again. 
The only thing I changed was I used a store bought pie crust and I didn't use whip cream; served it plain.

Excellent.  Made it for Easter and got raves - I am just sad there were no left overs!  I made 1.5 times the crust and used a 9 inch removable bottom tart pan - cook the crust a couple of minutes longer.  It was beautiful.  Topped with whipped cream and limes - perfect spring colors and awesome taste.  I will be making this one again and again.

This was so good! I only got two pieces before the whole pie was gone. Nice balance of flavors. I would suggest letting the whipped cream freeze before you eat it, less messy and it tastes better that way.

Just the recipe I was looking for. The stiff egg whites made it very airy/fluffy, and the taste was true to the key limes.

I would have to agree with "Sarah" who reviewed, that it was light and fluffly, and I was in the mood for smooth and silky key lime pie. All the key lime flavors come out but not my favorite recipe. Oh, but I did add a drop of coconut flavoring to my whipped cream and decorated the top. Fun!

This was the first Key Lime Pie I've ever made and it was really impressive, if I do say so myself. Those I served it to were quite impressed. Although I'll admit that I skipped making the whip cream and bought a tub of Cool-Whip. It was just easier and fool-proof.

Everyone loved this pie - even though I used 1/2 lime juice and 1/2 lemon juice instead of the key limes.  I will definitely be making again soon - especially now that I finally found some fresh key limes!

This pie was amazing! I garnished with lime slices and curly lime peels. I must admit that it was the first key lime pie i have ever made and I was so caught up in it that I forgot to cook it! My advise is to cook it, but even raw it was delicious!

I just made this last night with fresh key limes and fresh lemons.  I thought it was really good.  Haven't shared it with anyone yet.  I thought it was a little sweet.  I used reduced fat condensed milk.  I may try next time with all key limes.  I used a prepared graham cracker crust and refrigerated overnight.  I'll definitely make again.

The pie was out of sight, however I added sugar and vanilla to the whipped cream for a sweet topping.  Also my pie crust wasn't enough to spread all the way up the pie dish, so next time I will make a little more crust.

Tasted great.  The crust got a bit soggy, so the slices didn't come out of the pie plate very nicely.  My family would have liked a sweetened whipped topping like Cool Whip or Reddi-whip instead of the whipped cream.

I add some lime zest to the top of the pie before baking, it adds a little kick. I also do an Italian Meringue instead of whipped cream. Keeping it frozen until serving helps.

I am lactose-intolerant, so I used vegan butter for the crust and sweetened condensed coconut milk in the filling.  My pie took more than 15 minutes baking time to set, but i’m Not sure if that’s due to the coconut milk or my oven.  I could not find key limes, so I just used regular ones and a tiny bit of zest.  I also added 1/2 tsp of ground ginger to the crust. The pie has a pleasant flavor. It is very sweet.

turned out well, but colour isn't as green as the photo. I added in coconut oil instead of butter, and more lime juice instead of cream of tartar. I also added lime zest, and coconut shreds to the filling.

This is my favorite recipe and I do freeze it.  When ready to eat, I only thaw enough to remove slices.  I usually top with cool whip.

The directions are a touch confusing because of the way they're broken down. Read everything before you start and you should be fine. Next time I'll add an and extra held cup of graham cracker crumbs so I don't feel like I'm spreading the crust too thin. The pie itself was excellent! I don't think I've had anything closer to true key lime. It was a hit for my fiancés "birthday pie". I'll be making this again soon.

Not a traditional key lime pie. Key limes will give a pale yellow filling, never green. This is probably a Persian lime type of pie. Different.

Recipe is easy to follow but actually needs more lime juice than what was called for. Regardless it was tasty and next time I make it I’ll increase the amount of juice.

This was my first key lime pie. I made two changes: instead of using a pinch of salt, I used 3 tablespoons of sugar for the merengue. I tried using salt, but it came out very watery. And instead of mixing the merengue and the filling, I put the merengue on top as most key lime pies are. Very yummy, definitely making this again! And I think i found a typo... It says "1 cup of heavy whipping cream" in the ingredients list and nowhere does it say when to use it!

I'm usually not a fan of lemon or lime flavored thing, but this pie was very good! Waiting for it to freeze is crucial for the consistency to be right. We used cool whip instead of heavy whipping cream for the decorative topping, and it worked out just fine, probably even easier to do. This pie is a perfect summer treat.

I think using 1/4 cup lemon and 1/4 cup lime to make fresh key lime juice is the only way to go on this.  I used whole graham crackers and smashed them by hand to make my own crumbs, which left me a little short in the pie dish, so I crumbled up more crackers and added a little more butter to make up the difference.  I wasn't sure what the "fold the egg whites into the filling" meant, but I just poured the whites evenly over the filling and it seemed to come out ok.  Maybe not the best looking pie in the end, but that's my fault.  Great taste!

This is a great recipe. The filling is wonderful, light, creamy, and full of limey goodness. It took about twice as long to bake though.

I used bottled lime juice and pressed the graham crumb crust only into the bottom of my pie dish to save time.  Everyone loved it, I'd definitely make this again.

My husband loves key lime pie so I found this recipe to make for his birthday.  It turned out perfect.  I didn't use fresh squeezed juice, rather, bottled juice from the produce section call Sicilia Key Lime Juice (plastic lime bottle).  I found it plenty limey and delicious, though I've never had key lime pie before so I am not an expert on these matters.  The husband won't eat whipped cream so I skipped that and just used reddi-whip on mine and I thought it complemented the tartness well.  I served my husband's w/ just blueberries.  The only issue I had was that the crust stuck to the pie plate and it was very difficult to get a slice out in one piece.  I had used pam, tho the recipe didn't say to, so maybe that was the problem?  I'll make this again.

This was the first key lime pie I ever made, and it turned out so easy and delicious. In fact, one of my good friends said it was the best key lime pie he's ever had! Whipping the cream for the topping was easy with my stand mixer, but boy did my fingers hurt after squeezing all those key limes. :-)

I loved this pie. I made it for work and everyone luved it, although I might use just a tad less condensed milk, little sweet. I made a few changes, after reading others reviews, like I used a reduced fat, pre made graham cracker crust and I used reduced fat condensed milk. I also did not freeze it, just let it cool, then left it in the fridge, unwrapped.

Not so good.  Condensed milk taste was way too strong.  Maybe my condensed mild was too old??  Otherwise very easy to make.  Especially liked the graham cracker crust.

I made this for Easter and it was a great hit. The only things I would change would be to have the whipping cream sweater. I also added green dye to make it more festive and I added lime zest to the pie filling. Yum, Yum, Yummy! A big hit!

The filling in this pie was good enough, but the pie crust stuck to the pie plate and caused a mess.  Also, for novice cooks like myself, it would have been helpful to know that the whipping cream needs to be sweetened with sugar.  I don't think I will make this again.

This pie was a huge hit -  it was gone within a day!  I topped it with cool whip rather than whipped cream and added the zest of a few limes.  Not only was this the easiest pie I've ever made, but it was one of the tastiest!

i've tried to make key lime pie a couple of times before & it was a disaster, until now!  this was pretty easy, i used store bought graham crust.  i think the secret is to use real key limes.  i'm not a real big fan of key lime pie, but i will make again for company & hubby.

Very refreshing pie for the summer. It's abit tart. I think I'll tone down the key lime juice a dab to 1/3 cup and add a sprinkle of lime rind for looks. Fresh or frozen Cool Whip would be nice. It's a keeper.

I had never made Key Lime Pie before.  
This was very quick, easy and elegant!
My Guests LOVED it.  I used green coloring
drops.  VERY EASY.
