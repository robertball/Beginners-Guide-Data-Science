Substituted rice wine vinegar for lemon and used Sarafino Apple Mystard. Yummy.

Our family did not care for this at all. The mustard taste was overwhelming. I may try it again but will use a different mustard as well as cut the amount in half.

This "Maille Vegetable Dijon Dressing" was quite delicious. I made mine with stone-ground mustard and it had a lovely appearance owing to the mustard seeds. The sharpness of the mustard contrasted wonderfully with the tanginess of the lemon juice and the sweetness of the honey. I served it over steamed asparagus and fresh-sliced tomatoes and it was perfect. I will definitely make this recipe again. Thank you Maille for sharing your recipe.

I only used the dressing with artisan lettuce and chopped egg. It was excellent.

My family loved it. Spruced up a week day dinner. I served the dressing over asparagus and carrots but will definitely try it over other veggies as well.

I really like this. I used apple cider vinegar instead of lemon and replaced 1 TBSP of oil with water to lighten it up. Yummy.
