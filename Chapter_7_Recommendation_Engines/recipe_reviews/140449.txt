This was very good but I did change the recipe a bit. I had just returned from Guatemala and knew they never used vinegar but mostly lime juice. I replace the vinegar with lime juice. I also used 1/2 teas. of red pepper flakes and added 1/4 of a chopped onion. It had just enough bite to be great and the lime juice worked very well. It was a hit, will make it again. It makes a different vegetab;e side dish.

This is good. I love chayote, but this was my first time cooking it. I ended up needing some more cooking time - probably about 15 inutes total. Thanks for the recipe!

I found this squash in the store when looking for something different for dinner.  I have never had it before - it certainly looks strange.  I settled on this recipe based on ratings, and I wasn't disappointed.  After reading reviews, the only thing I did differently was to use lime juice instead of the vinegar, though I think I'll try it with the vinegar next time just to see.  Anyway, I think these need to be cooked slightly longer than the 6 minutes as directed, even if you like them a bit crunchy.  As for the taste of the squash, it's kind of like a cross between a potato, squash, and eggplant if you can imagine that.  A very light, crisp flavor.  The seasoning was just the right mix of heat and sweet - though next time I may kick both up a bit.  Overall, I'm happy to have found a new side dish and will be trying this again.

Great simple recipe.  I added thin sliced onion like another reviewer suggested, and it was great.  I used a mirin/rice wine vinegar combo for a little asian twist.

This is soooo good!!! Made as recipe is, except, per other reviewer, traded vinegar for lime juice- oooh soo tasty! this tastes like a gourmet side dish you'd get at a nice restaurant. I loved it! it was a bit spicy with a 1/4 teaspoon, but again, Very Tasty!!! thanks!!! Chayote is soo low calories too that i didn't feel bad with the oil. ;) yum

YUM!  I received some chayote squash in our church's Angel Food Menu Latin Veggie box, and didn't have the first clue what to do with them - this recipe was perfect! Had everything on hand, even some limes to swap out for the vinegar. SO easy, and SO good.  Even my little ones tried/ate a few bites (the red pepper flakes were quite spicy, though - might want to leave them out if you're trying to broad your children's vegetable horizon)

First time I've ever had this squash.  I loved the recipe as it was q simple way to try it the first time.  It was very good.  I didn't have a lime so I did use the wine vineger, splenda (diabetic) and light sprinkle of cayanne pepper..really good.  Not only will I buy it again but I will use this recipe along with others again.

Loved it! Subsituted lime juice for the red wine vinegar. I used ground red pepper to give it some bite. This will become a regular side at our place.

I liked it. I didn't love it, but I'd never used chayote for anything, so I'm thankful for the new side dish. I think with a little more seasoning it'll be one of my favorites.

Made a few of my own personal tweeks:  - added 1 teaspoon crushed dried oregano - added 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin - added 5 or 6 stuffed spanish olives - let marinate with 2 bay leaves - used sherry vinegar instead of wine vinegar

Got some chayote from a food bank and used this recipe because I never saw/cooked/ate it before. I didn't have any lime juice but I used lemon juice, added ginger, onions, garlic & whole peppercorns. Came out *AWESOME*

The flavor was too overpowering for the squash.  Tasted like pickled squash or something.  This didn't do it for me.

Used cayenne because I didn't have any red pepper flakes, and did the onion and lime juice as per other reviews. I cooked some chicken in the olive oil first to make it more of a lunch, and I would make it like that again and serve it over spaghetti or butterfly pasta to make it a full dinner meal. Very yummy with a spicy kick!

Very good, spicy!  I think I will try it without the vinegar for the second time-still a winner!  I did not have red pepper flakes, but used McCormack's Szechuan pepper blend.

For me, the sweetness of the squash and the sugar combined with the acidity of the lime, gave it the exact flavor of a honey lemon cough drop. The only saving grace was the heat from the pepper flakes. My husband liked it though, so maybe it's a taste issue.

WOW!!! We have a mutant chayote plant that takes over our patio every late summer/early fall. Every year we slice & marinate them and throw them on the grill when BBQing. They are amazing, but getting tired of having them the same way. I tried this recipe last night for ninner and it was FANTASTIC!!! I had 1/2 a lime in fridge so used that and 1/2 red wine vinegar, other than that followed recipe and I can't rave enough!! Still a little crunchy but light. A must try recipe!!

Great flavor! I cut out the sugar, substituted the red wine vinegar for apple cider vinegar.
I ate it today as a simple salad topper.
Easy and tasty!

I'm not much for spicy food so I used less crushed red pepper flakes than called for. Also, I wanted to try this with the lime juice, as suggested, but forgot to pick some up, so I had to use the vinegar.  Even so, I really liked this and will make it again.

I got three squash in my Bountiful Baskets and had no clue what they were or what to do with them!  I followed the recipe but used lime juice over vinegar as suggested, and a bit more red pepper.  Pretty yummy!!!  I think my whole family will enjoy it if I used less pepper, so this batch is all for me!

I did use some of the other rater's suggestions but the dish wasn't really anything exciting. It was okay, but I wouldn't make it again. I definitely thought it needed a bit more cooking but even after cooking it longer, it still tasted/felt a bit like under-cooked potatoes. Who knows - maybe my chayote are different from the ones used in the recipe..

First time cooking this squash, so I am not sure how I should rate it. I did it according to the recipe, but the flavors just didn't really do it for me. My boyfriend didn't really eat his either. I'm not sure though if I cooked them right, because, as I said, I've never really made this squash before. They were pretty firm. I might experiment with the squash again but with different flavors.

I had chayote inside latin soups and liked it a lot so thought I'd try it as a side dish.  But I did not like this at all.  Threw it out.

It was pretty good except I think the vinegar wasn't necessary. It was a little too tangy when you got to the bottom. I cooked mine a lot longer than 2-3 minutes, maybe like 20 minutes. I also used half the garlic.

Very YUMMY!!! My pre-schooler, who picked out the vegetable and tossed it in the cart, loved it. I also replaced the vinegar for lime juice.

If I could give it less than one star, I would. This was not good at all. I was excited to find a chayote recipe as we got 2 bags of it for free. I am extremely disappointed.

I came across this in the grocery store and thought it was interesting looking although had no idea how to cook it. This recipe was great to try it for the first time. I did add some chopped onion with the garlic and I traded the red wine vinegar for lime juice. I added a touch less red pepper flakes because I don't like anything overly spicy but next time I will add the whole amount called for or a touch more. Very tasty and hubby enjoyed it also. Will definetly buy Chayote Squash again and do this sidedish

I really enjoyed this dish although my husband didn't care for it much at all.  I did double the amount of vinegar, salt and sugar and cooked for more than the suggested time so that they were a little softer.  Next time I think I'll add a thinly slice onion.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first time eating chayote and I'm so happy I tried it! 
So yummy! And this recipe was quick and easy. I used lime juice like some other reviewers suggested and brown sugar instead of white. It has a sweetness and the right amount of kick with the red pepper flakes. I'll be making this again for sure!

Used other suggestions and added thinly sliced pieces of onion and just a dash of the vinegar the rest of lime.  I didn't want it to taste too vinegar-y and it was perfect.

I loved this, but with a few changed. No sugar or vinegar, more onions and red pepper flakes, and added lime and pine nuts. Delicious!

First time we had Chayote Sqhash and we loved it! I added some celery, carrots and a little Bok Choy.  Used lime juice instead of the vinegar and left out the sugar.  Added fresh Cilantro for seasoning.

Delicious! I used lime juice instead of the wine vinegar and I peeled the chayote before cooking. I was not sure how it would come out since we eat chayote often but it is always boiled. I love my chayote to be crunchy so I made sure it was not overcooked. Loved the recipe and will make it again this way.  Thanks for sharing!

Lovely!  I live in AZ and we have alot of excellent Mexican vegatables at our Food City stores.  This squash is very inexpensive and makes a great side dish.  Great recipe, the lime juice is especially nice.  I don't use sugar in my veggie dishes, but otherwise everything else was good.

Easy to make, for us it was shorter (say, by 10 mins) faster prep and cook time than what is estimated. Very spicy recipe with the red pepper flakes, we loved it. Offset with the sugar, the sweet and spicy was a perfect addition to our barbecue pork loin! Thanks!

I had never eaten chayote before.  I picked a couple up at the farmer's market in an effort to try new things. These are really good and the recipe is simple.  I also add chopped onion when I cook them.

I'm just not a fan of this veggie.  It was ok, but not a keeper in our family.  I may try it again if I find it for a good price in store, otherwise, I'll probably not make it again.

It's great both this way and with lime juice. But don'too much vinigar or it can taste a little pickled. I also use Cajun spice and serves it over rice with catfish.

Have to make again when I have some of the vinegar, although after reading review from MNJACK8, I think I'd rather try lime juice. I can just walk out the door and pick a lime off the tree! 
Nice to find a way to cook chayote, or christophine, as they call it here in Grenada. I added some leftover steamed pumpkin and hemp hearts.

This is excellent and flavorful and makes a great side dish for many entrees. I have added a variety of different herbs from the garden to vary the taste a bit. A good change from traditional fare at a holiday dinner, too.

About as easy and basic as you can get, so it shows off the chayote flavor.  Mine were big and the skin was too tough to eat.  I'll peel the skin like in the photo next time.  This wasn't clear to me

I did not add sugar. Very delicious, mild flavor. I boiled the squash whole before I peeled it.

I may try it again with some adjustments. First of all, this recipe calls for having the heat too high to add the garlic right away, so it burns. I may try again slicing the garlic instead of mincing and adding with the vinegar instead of at the beginning. All in all, it's a bland food and a bland recipe. It didn't even add much color to the plate.

I followed other reviewers' advice and added thinly sliced onion and subbed lime juice for the vinegar, and probably cooked it for more like 15 mins. I also subbed a little pure maple syrup for the sugar. The hot/sweet was very balanced. So nice to have a new vegetable to add to the rotation!

It was fun to try something different. Since I had a batch of preserved limes, I finely diced them and offered them as an optional garnish. We all liked the dish both ways.

I thought this was rather bland. I followed the recipe, and was just unimpressed.

I tried this using lime juice instead of vinegar like most of the comments suggested, and I did also use the pepper flakes (unfortunately a little too much, little too much of a bite). It said cook just till limp, I think it needed a little more cook time. I don't like my cooked veggies so crisp, don't like them mushy either, but to me it is crunchier than I like. The people suggesting lime juice instead of vinegar didn't say if it was a one to one substitution or not, thus I just poured some in the pan. This is making it hard to know if I got the flavor right. I may try again at some point, but it isn't a new favorite.

I made this with some chicken and apple sausages.  Browned sausages first in the pan, set them aside, covered.  Added squash following recipe.  Put sausages back into pan with squash.  It was delicious together.

I followed other reviewers' advice, sliced it thinly, cooked it longer, used lime juice instead of vinegar. I can't use sugar so I skipped it--and the flavor was too hot. (And I LIKE spicy food!) I used a paper towel to remove some of the oil, and added 2 Splenda--perfect. That sweetness is really needed to balance the heat. Delicious! Happy to have a new low-carb veggie to add to my repertoire, and I'll be making it again.

Cooking method needs to be changed.  1 TBSP olive oil is not enough.  The amount of time  needs to be longer and I put a lid over the squash to steam it to make it softer.  Stayed hard too long. I cut the salt and sugar by half.  1/2 inch slices too big and takes too long to cook. 1/3 inch slices better. Good taste.

I had never even heard of these until they showed up in my CSA box so I found a recipe to try! I read the reviews and swapped out the vinegar for lime juice, but that was the only change I made. These are DELICIOUS!!  I tried to describe them to my picky husband and the best I could come up with as a comparison is a "mild pickle". Even he said they weren't bad, so I'm considering it a win!

This was delicious. I left out the sugar and used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine. Paired this with artichoke stuffed flounder. Was very tasty.

Pretty good. I went lighter on the vinegar, and used the suggestion from the comments of starting with half a sliced onion. This was with two chayote squash. I thought perhaps I had undercooked it a bit, but decided I like having just a bit of crunch to it after all.

I tried both variations -- with the vinegar and with the lime juice. Both were delicious and flavorful.
