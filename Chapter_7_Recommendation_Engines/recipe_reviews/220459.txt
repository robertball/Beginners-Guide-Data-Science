It is widely known that there is an alcoholic shot with this same name, however the shot as well as this cake is VERY OFFENSIVE. As an Irishwoman I can't believe how Americans make light of the violence of Irish history. Seriously.

Be careful; the effects of the alcohol do NOT bake out in the oven.  At least, I felt it!

I should have taken a picture! The layers were pretty and the cake moist and delicious. The stout beer, whiskey, and irish cream were not overpowering so non-beer drinkers loved it too. It was a big hit at the St. Pattys day party!

This cake is evn better (I know- it hardly seems possible!) if you use half the ammt of crm cheese and substitute marscapone for the other half. All marscapone does not work well.

This was really tasty and easy (which is good because I don't really bake much).  My guests really enjoyed it as well.  I would probably add more bailey's to the cream cheese mixture though.  But the cake was super moist and had a great texture and the glaze was really yummy.

I made this for St. Patty's and it was very easy and so delicious.  I will be making this again but will leave the sugar glaze behind because this cake does not need it because it is so good.

This is a super moist cake. I made it for the first time for a group of ladies. Was a little worried since I had never made it before. Anyway, the creamy center was fine, I added a little bit more sugar to it and you didn't need 2 packs, maybe 1 1/2 would be better. The recipe I think made too much. On the glaze, was good but should have aloud the first layer to dry then added a second layer.I used a bundt pan and it worked fine.  BTW, I don't really think you detect the alcohol flavor unless you are sensitive to alcohol. Happy St. Pat's!

I made 2.  The first was exactly the recipe and it was very good. (I accidently tipped it & broke it apart, so I made another). I didn't have enough cream cheese for the 2nd, so the filling was a bit thinner, but I actually liked it better!  So I would reduce the cream cheese to 1 1/2 pkgs instead of 2 (as well as reducing the Irish Cream liqueuer slightly).  I am not a fan of whiskey or beer, but the cake is delicious. I also used just a chocolate cake mix with the pudding already in it for the 2nd cake.  I didn't notice any difference, really, between the 2. Good recipe. Everyone loved it.

I made this for my husband’s birthday. With some minor alterations: Bourbon cream instead or Irish cream, bourbon instead of Irish whiskey, and I added crispy chopped bacon to the batter. It was a huge hit!!!

I made this cake a day ahead for a St. Patrick's Day party. I did refrigerate it because of the cream cheese center. It would have been much better to eat it fresh. But once it warmed up to room temperature, the cream cheese was less firm and more soft and gooey.  I would make this again! Maybe next year, I'll make it and serve it the same day.

This was delicious!  I don't have a bundt pan. I made this for a st pattys day pot luck and i didn't want dishes afterwards so i made about 4 loaves with this recipe. And it actually made the cook time quicker.  It only needed about 30 min for the tooth pick inserted to come out clean. I will say this you can definitely taste the alcohol flavor in the cream center and the glaze on top. I added about 1/2 to a full cup of chocolate chips to the glaze. Also in all the things called/used for chocolate i used semi-sweet or dark chocolate. Definitely something fun and different. Everyone loved it!

A really unique, tasty cake!  My only criticism is that the Irish cream layer was a funny texture - it didn't really blend up to a creamy consistency.  Is there a difference between irish cream and irish cream liquer?  Not sure.

Delicious, rich cake! It was a real crowd pleaser for St Patty's Day brunch. I ended up mistakenly using cake mix that had pudding in it (and still used the pudding mix)--no issues!

This cake was amazing! I could probably have left the glaze to get a little bit thicker but it was delicious nevertheless. Super moist and very easy to put together. I found the alcohol wasn't as overpowering as I thought it would be (such a relief!), but it really makes the cake stand out. This is definitely going to become a staple of my recipe box :)

This was great, a bit more complicated , but so worth the compliments. The alcohol is actually more obvious in the filling, than the glaze.

The cake was good, but I was really disappointed by the sugar glaze.  It came out grainy even though I followed the directions.  I'm not sure what I did wrong.  I used butter as specified, white sugar (Domino's brand), and Irish Whiskey (Jameson's).  Did anyone else have this problem?
