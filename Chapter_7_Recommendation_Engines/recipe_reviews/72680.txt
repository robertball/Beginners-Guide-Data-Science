The trick to this dish is giving it a try!  I've made it many times as a side for bbq, but it is almost a meal in itself.  Great with cold sliced ham too.  Now I just usually make plain cornbread, may throw in the can of chiles or maybe not.  There are plenty of other things going on so to me the extras in the cornbread are not essential.  
Tips:  Mix up your dressing in advance, add the beans and allow the mixture to meld for a couple of hours in the fridge.  It seems to make the dish more flavorful.  If you're going to the trouble to  put this together, make the dressing as stated! Bottled ranch---noooo!  It's too wet and just does not have the creamier texture and tang you'll get by using sour cream.  Cut the cornbread into tiny cubes before removing it from the pan.  Makes for a better for presentation and it holds up longer.  Once layered, this still needs more than 2 hours in order to reach max flavor---more like 6-8 or overnight, covered, in the fridge. Yummy!

This was a huge hit at our gathering.  I'm not a big fan of pinto beans so I put substituted them for black beans instead.  The tomatoes, peppers & green onions weren't mentioned in the directions so I just mixed them in with the corn and it was WONDERFUL!!

This is awesome!! And I make this so often that I don't actually need the recipe anymore.  

I leave out the bacon (just because it's a pain to deal with) and instead of layering I just mix everything together and I add a small layer of shredded cheese on top.  It looks wonderful and it tastes even better!

Thanks for a great recipe!!

I found that the amounts of cumin, oregano, and sage in the corn bread is so little you can't taste it through all the other ingredients.  Tried doubling them, but still didn't notice, so I save myself the trouble and omit it.  This is a wonderful salad, unique flavors, great for potlucks.  Makes huge amount, I often half it still using most of the corn bread.

This recipe was a hit!I took it to a picnic and everyone raved.I was a little hesitant at first but it was very good.I bought a pre made cornbread from the bakery at the supermarket and also bought already cooked bacon because I was in a hurry and everything turned out perfect.This recipe made a lot so I took the leftovers home and the next day took the rest to another party and it tasted just as good.I will certainly make this again.

Fantastic!  Instead of the regular ranch packet, I got the fiesta ranch for an extra kick, and I didn't have sage so I put in a little taco seasoning with it.  I took it to a 4th of July BBQ and it disappeared!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!  I've already had to share it!

To be honest I didn’t particular like it but my family loved it! (I am very peculiar ? )....since I had kids coming over I cut the chili peppers in half the suggested amount and I mixed everything because I imagined it would be prettier all together…AND I WAS RIGHT! I loved the presentation... Really was a hit! 

PS/ I had 13 adults + 5 kids….I still have leftovers!!!

I made this recipe for a Christmas party at work.  Turned out pretty good, and got some nice comments on it.  I did want to mention that it is very labor-intensive, what with cooking the cornbread and bacon, chopping all the vegetables and layering in the pan.  There is NO WAY the prep time could be 20 minutes!!!  That's really misleading.  A couple tips to save on time and the amount of dishes and pans used....I combined the mayo, sour cream and ranch mix in a 2 cup glass measuring cup to save on bowls and measuring cups.  I chopped the bacon into pieces before I fried it, which eliminated laying it out in the pan and crumbing it afterward.  Also added some chopped fresh cilantro to the cornbread, because I like it and it was marked down.  Not sure if I would make this again, since it didn't seem amazing enough to justify all the time spent chopping, measuring, cooking and washing dishes.

Awesome. I make this whenever i want to wow people. I Layer it in a trifle bowl as written with the exceptions of... I don't add any of the seasoning to the cornbread (there's enough flavor without) I add some chopped red peppers (because they are pretty in the trifle bowl) and use 2 cups of bottled Ranch dressing. This has been a hit every time.

I decided to make this because it was different and it had positive reviews.  I was skeptacle while making it.  It looked so appetizing and pretty when I finished it.  I brought it to a perch fry and boy was it a hit!  It was really delicious.  I used fat free sour cream and light mayo and black beans.  Several people asked for the recipe and it was a big success!

First of all, this is very pretty. One of my guy friends had at least 3 helpings, and took some home, too.  I used half kidney beans and half black beans.  It makes a LOT of salad, so unless you're going to a larger function, maybe try to do half a batch (Ww had 8 people, and ate less than half).  I would have liked more cornbread, so that can stay the same, perhaps.  May make this again, but a smaller version with more cornbread.  Also, this was a bit more sticky/mushy the second day, so try to make it the same day as the event, unless you want it more like a potato salad consistancy.

This has become one of my favorites - I can eat pretty much the entire bowl by myself (not at one sitting though).  I must have served this 10 times in the past few months and someone asked for the recipe every time.

Yum!  This was great!  I doubled the spices in the cornbread mixture and thought that was perfect.  And, instead of cooking some bacon, I used a package of already cooked bacon bits to save me some time.  The only other thing I did differently was use a red pepper instead of a green one.  Very colorful!  And, definitely a different type of side dish to take to a BBQ.  I had many people raving and asking for the recipe!!

This recipe was fun and it looks yummy in a glass or clear plastic serving dish. There are so many things you can do to personalize this and make it your own. I started w adding a lot more seasoning to my cornbread recipe (paprika, celery seed, savory, cumin, garlic and roasted garlic, red pepper flakes). I used 1 can Northern white beans and 1 can Caribbean Recipe Black beans (yum!). I forgot to layer cheese in the middle, so put it all on top and that was just fine. 

Very flavorful and the diced tomatoes stay firm and fresh; nice surprise! The one thing that bothered me was how much MAYO and SOUR CREAM we were eating in every bite... so, I would stick to the recipe for potlucks, but serving my family, I plan on adding cottage cheese to the recipe and decreasing the amt of mayo and s.cream. I will also use the crumbled bacon in the bag (from costco) just because there is so much more meat and less fat in Costco's-- meaning a healthier end recipe.

I thought it might also be fun to add spicy Jimmy Dean sausage (in place of the bacon), olives, chopped fresh broccoli into the layers-- serving it up w a wedge of lettuce and some hot peppers on the side.

I used the stated size of canned chili's and it was fine. Once the cornbread is cooked, the flavor of the chili's is extremely mild. I will add MORE to mine next time. HA!

Ohhhhhhhh the options! Fun!

This is so good! We will have this with our Easter meal. Only change is reduce the can of green chilies to the small 4 oz size and put 2 cans of whole corn. It was perfect and everyone who taste it wants the recipe.

Fixed this as a side dish for Thanksgiving dinner and OH My, I barely brought any home. Only thing I did different was omit the Sage due to being allergic to it, but was just as good all the same!

I really enjoyed this--a nice change of pace from your typical pasta or potato salads.  I do have to agree with previous reviewers that the seasoning in the cornbread really didn't add much...I couldn't tell it was there.  The bacon added a little bit of smokey flavor, but could also be skipped to save time and it would be just as good.

This was a big hit at a potluck dinner I went to earlier this summer.  The same group is getting together this weekend and they have requested I bring this again!  Only change I made was due to my error -- I was in a hurry and didn't realize that I needed to add the cumin, oregano, sage and green chilies to the corn bread mix before baking.  Instead, I added them to the vegetables.  It was awesome!  I think I'll just keep making it that way.

Yummmmm!!!! Yes, you must make this!    I have to skinny my recipes down (which did not affect taste one bit), so I off course substituted low fat and fat free where possible and I used turkey bacon.  I used one can of beans, b/c I thought 2 might be to much. I also added some taco seasoning to the corn bread mixture like someone had suggested and increased the other spices to a half teaspoon.   To kick it up another notch I added cilantro and avocado to the top layer...one super tasty meal! I think this would also be great served over some lettuce (spring mix) to give it that extra health benefit and make it more of a real salad. Enjoy!! :)

I love this recipe.  I substituted a taco seasoning packet in place of the Ranch dressing and it added an all new flavor.  I like the taste of the taco seasonings better.

This was good stuff. I used leftover mexican corn bread which had corn, chilis, and other stuff in it so I ignored that part of the recipe. I cut the recipe in half as I was only feeding 4 of us. I also cut out the corn since my corn bread already had some. We really enjoyed this and it still made a ton!! I will be making this one anytime we have leftover corn bread =)

This was okay but nothing I would make again.  The seasonings stirred into the cornbread made it an odd, unappetizing color.

This was REALLY good.  I don't think that the 16oz can of green chilis is the correct size; I used a 4oz can.  I made it for our Christmas pot luck at work and there was just a little bit left for me to take home and share with my daughter.  I did find that the 2 cups of ranch were just a bit shy of what I needed so I added about 1/4 - 1/2 cup of ranch dressing from a bottle to stretch it and that seemed just about right.  Oh and as someone else had suggested, I added a can of sliced black olives on the top and that made the dish all the prettier.

This recipe is really good.  You can't really taste the spices in the cornbread so I'll skip them next time.  It is very different and has great flavor.  I think it was even better the second day.

Took this to a picnic where most had never had cornbread salad....enjoyed by all and very colorful.  Made a few changes only because of personal preference for a healthier salad....Used light mayo, fat-free sour cream, precooked bacon just because it's less fatty and less fat cheddar.  Instead of layering I tossed everything together except the bacon and let the favors blend over night in the fridge.....before serving I added the bacon.  Added a few chopped tomatos, a little cheese and crumbled bacon on top.  Delicious!

This was good. It seems different than I remembered at a potluck.  I shared with my family (different households).  Everyone loved it.  Several people used as a filling for a wrap.  Several have asked me for the recipe.

This is a nice dish for a potluck.  I brought it to work and everyone said they liked it.  I made it the night before and it wasn't soggy at all.  It makes a nice presentation layered.  The flavor is good but not knock your socks off.

I love this salad! I had never even heard of this until a friend brought it to a gathering and I immediately went searching for a recipe. This does the trick! I also have made a lighter version by tossing all of the vegetables over fresh spinach leaves and crumbling cornbread over top, serve ranch on the side.  An excellent way to serve salad with mexican food. Must try.

Fearful of the mayo, I wanted to make this recipe a little more healthy for me and my husband.  So I ditched the ranch and bacon and opted for browned lean ground turkey cooked with taco seasoning.  Instead of 16 ounces of canned chilies, I used 8 ounces. The cornbread was simply delicious with chilies, cumin and oregano.  One can of black beans and one can of light red kidney beans were used instead of the two cans of pinto beans (Next time, I'll soak some dried black and kidney beans to help cut the sodium.).  Lastly, I used frozen corn rather than canned to cut down on the sodium.  Excellent recipe!

I’ve made it 2 times as written and a big hit both times. I find one package of cornbread isn’t enough, I use 2 packages cornbread mix and double the milk and egg. I ended up using about 1 1/2 of the cornbread and froze the leftovers.

I tried this at a festival, and loved it so much I scoured the internet for the recipe and have since made this many times.  The added trouble doesn't make any discernible flavor difference so I do not bother adding in the stuff to the cornbread I just make it plain as directed on the box.  I have also replaced the green onion with a smaller amount of red onion depending on what I have on hand. I mix all the veg together and then layer as directed right in a large tupperware if I'm taking it somewhere.  This is a perfect potluck dish because you can make it ahead of time and it's easily transportable.  It might seem like too little cornbread, but I tried doubling the amount once and that was a mistake.  It becomes too dense.  Just stick with the original amount.  If you like the things that go into this dish, you'll love the results!

This was a delicious hit at the party I brought it to. I used a trifle dish so it was yummy and pretty. It makes a lot so if it's a small party like mine was, your friends will ask for some of the leftovers and the recipe.

I traded the green chilies for chipotle peppers in Adobe sauce.  Didn’t have the bacon or tomatoes  so I just left them out.  It came out delicious!  I will be fixing this again.  Fixing to take it to a potluck, if they enjoy spicy food, I’m sure this will be a hit.

My mom used to make this.  It makes a fabulous party dish, and makes a huge amount.  It is 5 stars as is.  I sometimes add ancho chili powder and a bit of cayenne to the dressing to add zip, and I have also used unrinsed  chili seasoned beans.  I think I’ll try it with barbecue beans and a bit of barbecue sauce in the dressing, as a change of pace.  This is really a versatile vehicle.  Very filling!

10/11/16:  Made for BSF luncheon.  This is wonderful!  Glady's who is a caterer asked for the recipe :)  I used 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of pintos.  After first layer I sprinkled white pepper and no sodium Tony's.  After second layer I sprinkled paprika.  Also substituted turkey ham for the bacon.  Used rotel in place of green chilies, tomatoes and green pepper. First layer cheese I used sharp cheddar, second layer colby jack.

Made it according to recipe except I added ref and yellow pepper instead of bell pepper abs done red onion instead of green.  Used olive oil mayo and fat free sour cream. I brought it to a put luck wedding reception and several people really liked it, one guy even brought the rest home with him. I'd make it again.

Great recipe.  I make it fir pot luck. Too much for my family . I did not mix the seasoning or the chilis in with my corn bread, I mixed them with my green onions.  Made this with drained black beans,2 cans. I actually baked 2 jiffy cornbread boxes , 1 1/2 of the mix in the pan. Used the rest , baking in a small cast iron skillet.  I cube the corn bread after cooled, used 2 drained cans of corn.  Very good,  do not use bottled ranch .

I first had this dish at a dog show in Michigan, there was an amish food booth and they had this salad, I just had to find the recipe.  Of course I found it here on Allrecipes!  It tasted just like the amish version!  It was a big hit, even my girlfriend who doesn't like cornbread liked this dish alot.  Now maybe she will share her Cherry Delight recipe with me (finally), if I give her this recipe. I think it could use more cornbread as well as other members said.  But still am loving it.  Thanks

Wasn't a big seller at my potluck. A little stodgy. I guess would be okay as a small side dish with other tastier foods.

This recipe is awesome!  Anywhere I take this dish people always rave and want the recipe.  Leave out the bacon and you've got a great and filling dish for the vegetarians at your table.  I usually make it into two 8 or 9" glass serving dishes...one with bacon and one without, so everyone can enjoy it.

Very good! I used light mayo and reduced fat sour cream. I was out of eggs for the cornbread mixture, so I substituted an extra splash of milk for the egg. My family said this recipe is a keeper!

Sorry for the really low rating, but I had to because not one person out of 20 liked this salad at the bbq I threw.  Usually, I use the Cornbread Salad I from this site and it always gets rave reviews, but this recipe fell way short.  I did omit the green chilies (kids) & sage (didn't have any), but otherwise followed the recipe as stated - assembled the night before & let sit until the bbq the next afternoon. The flavors weren't cohesive & it was "just ok".  :(

This tasted great, I made it for 4th of July and everyone loved it.  Next time I'll make it the day before because it tasted even better the next day.  
4 stars because it was a very time consuming dish to put together.

Wow...This was AMAZING!!!  I fixed this for a Fourth of July cook out and people RAVED over it.  I used poultry seasoning and chili powder instead of sage and cumin (didn't have any on hand).  I left out the bell pepper because I don't like them.

I'm not a huge ranch fan so maybe time I will use half the packet of ranch. Salad smells awesome. I only used half the amount of chiles and that was enough.

This was really tasty and went over well at the potluck. I reduced the green  peppers to one 4 ounce can and used fat free mayo and fat free sour cream in the dish (and no one knew) It was a very colorful dish and looked as good as it tasted. I used a low fat mexican cheese blend on top instead of just cheddar. I had just enough leftovers to take home and have for dinner.

Made this for Easter lunch and it got rave reviews - everyone said they could make a meal off this salad alone!  I made regular cornbread, didn't add any of the spices or chilis, bumped the mayo and sour cream to 1.5 cups each, used 2 cans of corn, used thick cut bacon and subbed sweet red pepper for the green onions because I don't like green onions.  It was TO DIE FOR!  I ate leftovers today for lunch and it was even better today!!  I will make this again and again.  Next time I'm going to use black beans.  5-star recipe!

Decided to give this a try because it sounded a little different. I've never had cornbread in a salad before. I'm glad I did because it's really good. The store was out of canned chiles so I skipped it. Still tasted great. I'm looking forward to serving this at summer barbeques. Thanks for the recipe.

I LOVE this recipe! I have made this so many times and it is so GOOD! I use low fat mayo and sour cream to make it healthier. The layers are pretty and if I am making it for company or to take somewhere, then I will take the time to do the layers. Otherwise I just mix everything together at the beginning. The leftovers for this are better than eating it the first time. I have used pinto beans and garbonzo beans (chick peas) and I personally like the chick peas better.

I added layers of torn lettuce and only used 1 can of beans.  Layered in a trifle dish/tall glass bowl- it looks pretty.  Great for summer potlucks/lunches.
