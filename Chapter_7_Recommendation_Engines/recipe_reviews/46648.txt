I've made this twice now. The first time I was unhappy with the sauerkraut. It was too crispy for my liking. So the second time while I had my kielbasa boiling I threw my kraut in a pan with some onion soup mix and boiled it down some as well to make it more tender to the bite. I didn't try it at all with the mozerella, my taste buds instantly told me sharp cheddar and it was fantastic! I enjoy this recipe because my 7 year old refuses to even try sauerkraut, and I can pick and choose which keilbasa gets kraut on them. My 7 tear old gets just taters and cheese on his. I also found it to be better with a little salt and black pepper sprinkled on top ... but that's just my own preference. Super easy to make, a winner all the way with the ability to leave off things not liked for the picky eaters. The onion soup mix in the kraut while the kielbasa's boiling though did make a huge difference and gave it even more flavor!

O.K. this is the story. I cleaned out our two freezers today and found a link of kielbasa and the tilapia that we had recently purchased. I decided to make both. I figured that the girls and I would eat most of the fish and Drew boy would eat his meat, being that he's a big carnivor. Well, not only did the girls eat the fish, but they both DEVOURED the kielbasa too! I was shocked because even though my kids are not picky and would probably eat kitty litter if I gave it to them, (kidding) they are not sauerkraut lovers. Kids and Drew all asked to keep this in mind for future dinners as it reminded them of our yearly Oktoberfest dinners at our German club. Thanks Theresa!

Good grief, talk about comfort food.  If you're a kraut/kielbasa fan, you've got to try this one.  Used homemade mashed potatos and added a little garlic powder.  Also used a cheddar/mozzarella blend.  Great stuff.

WE love this! The only thing I change is the flavor of the sauerkraut.  My DH will not eat regular kraut so I add about 3 tablspns(or to taste) of brown sugar to sweeten it up, then he will eat it and I like it that way, too.  It makes the mashed potatoes taste waaaay better!  Put the sugar, sauerkraut and some water (to keep it from burning) in a pan and simmer it forever.  The more you cook it the better it gets!  My German MIL taught me that!

I took the concept of this dish and changed it because of what I had on had in the frige.  During the week I made "Indiana-Style Fried Cabbage" - on this site.  Made it for the first time and we loved it -  had that and mashed potatoes left over.  Also had half of a kielbasa in the freezer. Boiled the kielbasa, and then stuffed it with the cabbage and mashed potatoes and baked it.  Served it with mustard on the side.  It is a keeper - I now know what to do with the cabbage leftovers.  I can imagine that it tastes great your way too.  Thanks Theresa.

This is a great recipe idea!  I did change it up a bit to suit my family's taste and incorporate what I had on hand.  I used a low-fat keilbasa so I skipped the boiling, and instead of sauerkraut (which I love, husband hates) I used grilled onions, made homemade mashed potatoes (I use butter & sour cream - no milk) and topped with swiss cheese.  Even my 2 year old asked for seconds!  This will definitely be added to our family faves!

These were good.  I made them almost exactly as stated.  I didn't have instant potatoes so I made fresh roasted garlic mashers.  Next time I make this I will cook the kraut first with some onion and maybe a little apple.  I prefer mine not so crunchy.  Growing up we often had Kielbasa, kraut and mashed potatoes.  Having the same things a different way was a nice change.

I read all the reviews before hand and this sounded like a winner. But I don't see what all the fuss is about. My husband and I thought it was bland. We won't be making this again.

I was rushed for time one night getting my daughter to an event so I took your recipe and made into a casserole. I used both packets of the potatoes, cooked in microwave and smeared on the bottom of a 9x13 greased casserole dish. Topped it with the sauerkraut (Franks big can, rinsed and drained) and chopped onions, and sprinkled caraway seeds, salt and pepper. Then layered half the cheese.  I cut up the sausage into bite size pieces and placed in a layer on top and sprinkled with the remaining cheese. Cooked covered at 350 for 40 minutes then took the foil off and gave it another 8 minutes to brown the cheese...easy and fantastic! Thank you for this recipe!

Pretty good! My hubs and I enjoyed this but both agree that the "toppings" would be better served as side dishes (our preference, I guess). I am always on the lookout for easy recipes to prepare on hectic weekdays. Not only was this SUPER quick to assemble, it was also satisfying and made with things my hubby and I BOTH enjoy (a HUGE feat!)!!! I must admit, I did make a few changes, mostly in the name of saving even MORE time in the kitchen. I ended up using turkey kielbasa (thus eliminating the boiling step - it's much leaner), subbing refrigerated mashed potatoes for boxed instant ones and canned Bavarian kraut for plain sauerkraut and, instead of mozzarella on top (it didn't seem to go), I added a generous sprinkling of cheddar blend cheese (i.e sharp / mild and white cheddar cheeses) to each "sausage." I would like to have used Swiss but my grocer was out of it. Served open-faced on pretzel hot dog buns with a side of three-bean salad and German beer, this was a nice meal. Thanks for sharing your idea Theresa! :-)

This was just okay.  My kids wouldn't eat it.  They picked everything off and just ate the kielbasa.   I tried it with both the mozarella cheese and the cheddar cheese.  I liked the cheddar better.

Great, easy meal!  I made my husband a smaller dish with just the kraut, because he isn't a huge potato (or cheese) fan.  I used mashed potato patties from market day, and used shredded colby jack cheese (it needed color).  Loved by all.  Thanks Theresa!

Loved it!  But I am of German heritage.  I did cook the kraut first as I like it softer than straight from the can or jar.  And I used real mashed potatoes with lots of butter.

This was really good. I was looking for something different to do with kielbasa, and this hit the mark.  I don't like sauerkrat, so I grilled onions as others had suggested.  It's such a unique taste. My 2 year old son even ate it - which means a lot! haha.

Will definitely be making this again.

My husband and I both really enjoyed this! I used cheddar jack cheese, and sprinkled some celery salt on the top before it went in the oven.  This is so quick and easy that I'm sure I'll make it again.  Thanks!

While this is tasty and quick, next time I'll make some changes.  Made spuds from scratch and added some brown sugar to the sauerkraut.  I found the entire dish waaaaay too salty.  DH said it was fine!  I'll rinse some of the brine off the kraut next time.  Also used cheddar as that's what I had.
If you have a microwave, you can peel and nuke some spuds in about 8 minutes on "high" setting.  I just can't do instant mashed potatoes.  NYET!

Made this several times and we love it.  Always made my own garlic mashed potatoes using red potatoes, and I like topping it with cheddar cheese.  So easy, yet inexpensive!

I have made and eaten kielbasa (or hot dogs) w/ sauerkraut and mashed potatoes on the side for my entire life, but never thought to make it this way...It was AWESOME and DELICIOUS! I used a package of kielbasa links, which I did not boil first, and cheddar cheese instead of the mozzarella. I also opted to use a small cookie scoop to put the potatoes on top, and that worked out great. I served these with 'Quick and Easy Pierogies' from this site, and everything went together well. We really, REALLY enjoyed this tonight...great comfort food, and something that will be made often in our house~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made a casserole out of this since I just plain love casseroles. Cut the sausage into 1/4" silver dollar pieces and brown on the stove. Remove from pan and set aside.  Add the sauerkraut and some onion slices with a little bit of garlic to the pan and cook to slightly soften. Layer the casserole pan in the following order: Sausages, kraut mixture, a few squirts of mustard and top with the mashed potatoes. Bake at 350 for about 1/2 hour or until hot through. We had enough of this for a second meal and it was even better after sitting for a couple days. Thank you so much for the original recipe - we'll use it again and again!

Really easy and very tasty!  We used bavarian style sweet sauerkraut and low-fat pre-cooked kielbasa, and these worked very well.  Homemade mashed potatoes were a big improvement, too.

Made this for dinner tonight.  Was really good and satisfied my sausage craving.  I used barvarian sauerkraut, which I thought would be too sweet, but was actually a nice compliment to the other flavors.  Also had to make my own mashed potatoes from scratch...just can't do the fake stuff.  Will definitely make again.

Fair.  Interesting, but really just fair.  We enjoyed the sourkraut/potato/cheese mixture very much...we just didn't think it went well with the kielbasa.  Not terrible, we ate it all, but tossed the recipe.

I found this recipe to be seriously lacking in flavor.  I was very surprised, based on the reviews.  I will not make this again.

Made with leftover mashed potatoes and Down Home Sausage.  Did not measure; simply sliced the sausage, browned a little, topped with heated sauerkraut, heated potatoes and cheese and put in the oven till the cheese melted.  Yummy

This was good - - a bit boring, but I think the inexpensiveness and ease make up for that tenfold.  Made my own garlic mashed potatoes which I mixed directly with the kraut before topping and shredded some Colby Jack cheese as opposed to Mozzarella as it was all I had (and, for the record, I think the sharper tasting cheese was more appreciated in this....you get a lot of flavor from whatever cheese you will use).  I liked this twist on the same ole kielbasa with spuds and kraut - thanks!

This was a great idea... I knew I had to make it since it incorporated my boyfriend's three favorite foods! I actually mixed the sauerkraut and mashed potatoes together before stuffing the kielbasa. Also, I topped some with Swiss cheese and others with Cojack, both were very tasty.

Winner! When my husband grills out in the summer, he likes to throw kielbasa on the grill and munch on them until the "real" food is cooked. I made these for him and he threw them on the grill. He was in HOG heaven!! I used several different cheeses and he added a squirt of mustard down the middle. He was a very happy man!

The fact that I got Kelly to eat Kielbasa… or sauerkraut… is a miracle.  I added brown sugar per one of the other reviews, but otherwise no changes from the original recipe.  So easy, and we all liked it. Even Kelly.  Served it with baked apples and sweet baby carrots with dill.

Tried this tonight.  It was so good, my kids asked me to put it on the regular rotation list!!  I changed a few things though.  I used turkey kielbasa (so didn't pre-boil), sweet potatoes (with butter, Greek yogurt, salt and garlic powder) and cheddar with the mozzarella.  I don't think my changes are enough to change the recipe per se... but that's what I had on hand.  I will try it with regular potatoes next time just for curiosities' sake.  But the sweet potatoes with it were a huge hit!!  Thanks for the idea!

Awesome!  Quick, easy, and something different! I like my sauerkraut on the softer side so I simmered it with water for about 20 min first. I topped it with sharp cheddar instead of mozz.

I have made this A LOT and have given this recipe to many co workers with great reviews as well. You dont want to use an expensive Kielbasa for this just a Hillshire or the like. Boiling not only removes some fat but you can lay it out and cut your sizes without having the "curly" end. My daughter doesnt like sauerkraut so I omit it on hers and we also prefer cheddar cheese over Mozzarella by far

Great ,quick recipe. I used smoke sausage, a personal preference and added some cheddar cheese for the extra taste and color as well as some sautéed onions. Thanks for Sharing.

A hit at our house.  My husband and son both gave it their highest rating.  I took one reviewers advice and boiled the sauerkraut in Brown Sugar Twin (she said brown sugar but I'm diabetic).  It was wonderful!  I used sharp cheddar cheese and next time will try smoked cheddar.  Hit the spot!  Also since I low carb I used garlic mashed cauliflower instead of the potatoes.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I would agree with others, cook the kraut first. Very good and easy dish. Next time I will use cheddar cheese though, it was hard to taste the mozzarella

I used a spoonful of the 48oz jar of minced garlic I just had to buy at Costco to make garlic potatoes. No sauerkraut (yuck) for me and I used Mexican four cheese. I ate half of my meal for dinner last night and it was very tasty. I heated up the second half in my toaster oven for lunch today and it was even tastier! Will defintely make this one again!

Comfort food!  As with others, we made with hotdogs, but my mom wrapped it with bacon and broiled.  The kielbasa and sauerkraut definitely add more "adult" flavors.

These were really fun. I did use a cheddar blend because that is all I had on hand but that was my only change and I prefer cheddar over mozzarella so this did not effect my rating. I think they would be even better with real mashed potatoes instead of the instant but these were great as written for a quick fix.

For those that have trouble with saurkraut being sour add 1 to 1-1/2 TBS of brown sugar per 2 cups of kraut.  Also, use Bavarian Kraut with caraway seeds.  Delicious

I decided to make this last night to use up some leftover mashed potatoes and invited over a friend of mine who, like me, loves sausage & sauerkraut!  I  used one kielbasa and one turkey smoked sausage.  Since I had both swiss cheese and cojack on hand I just used both of those.  My friend just loved it, but didn't think he would like it as much without the German-Style Green Beans (also on this site) that I made to go with it because of the sweetness that they added to the "sauer".  And neither one of us could tell the difference in the sausages.  In my opinion, I didn't think it was worth all the trouble to make the "sausage boats".I would rather just have mashed potatoes topped with sauerkraut and the sausage on the side w/mustard.  My boyfriend really liked this as well, so because of that I will likely make this again with only turkey sausage, probably just whatever cheese I have on hand and the German-Style Green Beans as the side!

This saved the night! I was wondering what I was going to do with a Kielbasa to make it better than "just a kielbasa". The family enjoyed it. I used Monterey Jack cheese and put it under the broiler towards the end making the cheese nice and hot and a little crispy! Thank you!

I just finished eating dinner, and was so pleased I had to review this wonderful, quick, and easy recipe! This was fantastic! Yes, I was raised in a polish household, and maybe that's why this tasted so good, but I urge everyone to give it a try. I used regular instant potatoes, to which I added a bit of a garlic/herb seasoning, as well as some snipped chives and fresh ground pepper. I used a 4-cheese Mexican blend for the cheese topping, and it worked fine. I'll be making this dish as often as my boyfriend wants it, can't wait! Theresa, thank you so much!

I made this with what I had on hand, which was a beef bratwurst type thing, made homemade mashed potatoes (sorry, I just can't bring myself to use instant), and added garlic to them.  I layered saurkraut, then the potatoes, then cheddar cheese for my guy, (left cheese off mine, still tasty!), and we both loved it.  It tastes just like the ingredients, potatoes, sauerkraut, and sausage.  Very good, very filling, will definitely make again.

So this was very different yet surprisingly delicious. Very easy to make as well! Only one thing Id change one box of instant mashed potatoes is way way too much Id use half a box or not even half. I ended up with enough mashed potatoes left over for probably like 20 more of these bad boys! Leftover potatoes are always good though. Thanks for the recipe!!! Its a keeper!!

I cooked this tonight. I wanted something different to do with keibasha. It was deffinatly easy. I used sautéed onions because my kiddos aren't to hot for sauerkraut, other then that I didn't change a thing. It was a nice dish. Thanks for the recipe

I agree with the reviewer that said that it was too blah.  I used both mozzarella and cheddar cheese.  Might make it for our grandkids but not for the adults.

This was great, I had 2 picky 11 year olds so I left the sauerkraut off of theirs and they LOVED it! Very flavorful and just what we liked. My husband said that it was more of a winter dish but I could eat it year round! It was a hit at my house!

I doubled this recipe and also used a light sprinkling of cheddar on top of the mozzarella.  My son and husband thought these were absolutely delicious, and they both asked for it to be added to our dinner repertoire.  My son wanted them without sauerkraut, so I did half with and half without.  I made a fresh fruit salad (strawberries, red grapes, blueberries, blackberries, nectarines, pineapple, watermelon and cherries) as an accompaniment.  The entire dinner was a big hit.

I have been doing something similar for 20 years.  I leave off the sauerkraut, add real mashed potatoes, add buttered corn (or small broccolli pieces), salt and pepper.   Then I cover with slices of cheddar cheese and broil until cheese is melted.

Definitely comfort food! Like a couple of other reviewers, I ate this (with hotdogs instead of kielbasa) when I was a child. I still revert back to it these days when I can't figure out what to cook!

I have made this many, many nights with some slight preference changes.  I don't like sauerkraut or instant potatoes.  The sauerkraut was eliminated completely.  I made mashed sweet potatoes instead.  I used a shredded Colby Jack, since that was the shredded cheese I had on hand.  One time between grocery store visits, I even used just some sliced Munster cheese, since that's what I had.  It's great every time!

I gave this 3 stars. While it tastes good. It's nothing special. It's just what I normally would make while making kielbasa. It was good, just nothing special. It would've been faster to just make everything seperately like I normally do than go by the directions here.

This is a GREAT way to serve kielbsa, brats, smoked sausage, etc.  I had jalapeno kielbasa so ours had a little "zip" to them.  I used my small cookie scoop to put the mashed potatoes on the sauerkraut.  Tried 3 different kinds on the tops.  We really enjoyed the meat, potatoes and kraut served this way.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks Theresa for sharing this recipe.

I just made this a few nights ago and my boyfriend enjoyed it.  I used homemade mashed potatoes rather than pre-packaged mashed potatoes.  I also didn't use sauerkraut, and used cheddar instead of mozzarella.  Still turned out nice!

Wish I could give it 4 1/2.  Can miss with this combination of ingredients.  Will make homemade mashed potatoes next time.  Hint ... use a cookie press to layer on the potatoes!  I made 3 pounds of kielbasa for 6 of us hoping for leftovers for tomorrow's lunch.  Ha! I think there is only 1 or 2 pieces left.  Could be a fight to see who gets it!

Delicious!  I used turkey kielbasa, cut into small pieces and layered in a casserole.  I did not cook beforehand because I did not have to worry about draining fat.  My superbpwl guests loved it and so di my family.  Thanks!

This was a great way to try out some kielbasa we just made with venison and pork.  I did not have saurkraut so I took the advice of another reviewer and used sauted onion instead.  I also used shredded jack cheese because it's what I had on hand.  My fiance and I both really liked it, we will definately use this recipe again.

My family loved this!  I wasn't sure about my kids, but this was something even my 3 yr. old ate, and he is my pickiest.  Easy to prepare and fast to the table too.  A new family favorite

Great Recipe simple but delicious! I used healthy choice kielbasa and substiuted homemade garlic mashed poatoes instead of boxed.  I also used cheddar cheese and garnished with scallions which gave it a little extra flavor.

I have to say I wasn't expecting much out of this recipe. I am pleased to say I stand corrected. It was easy, fast & tasty. I skipped the mozarella & used swiss on half & cheddar on the other half of the links. The swiss was better liked by all. Well done, Theresa.

Great, easy weeknight meal.  Even my 2 year old ate it!
I used mozzarella, though I will use cheddar next time, as I think it'll taste better with the cheddar.

This was not bad, but not too exciting either.  We used reduced fat mettwurst which was convenient (and didn't have to be boiled to remove the grease), and instant garlic-flavored potatoes.  This is OK for a busy night because it's extremely fast and simple, but just not too flavorful.  Another reviewer mentioned using Cheddar cheese - I think that would be more interesting than the mozzarella.  Note the Garlic Green Beans in the background of my photo ... they went pretty well with this recipe.

I made this recipe for a midnight snack... actually it was 2 o'clock in the morning when I woke up hungry. It actually tasted pretty good and I ate two servings. The only down side to this recipe is that it is a "heavy" meal. I didn't feel like eating again until about 5 o'clock in the afternoon!

Very Good. I did change the recipe a little. I used lite sausage and sprinkled a little brown sugar on it before topping with the potatoes. I left out the kraut and topped with slices of mozzarella cheese. Will make this again

A new comfort food favorite for my family. I defrosted the kielbasa and grilled it on the Forman and used cheddar cheese. Still good.

I was hesitant to try this...a weird combo of ingredients.  But to my surprise, it was quite tasty!!! I had leftover mashies in the fridge that would have otherwise been tossed.  I saw this recipe and thought....how bad could it be?? I used frozen lite kielbasi thawed just enough to be split, leftover mashies, a sprinkle of garlic powder, and the mozz. cheese.  They were a GREAT lunch meal!! I used sauerkraut only on 1/2 as my hubby doesn' like it....but he ate one with and gobbled it right up! TRY IT!

I’m Polish but never saw Kielbasa fixed this way.  I made my mom’s recipe for sauerkraut, which takes about 2 hours.  Only had 1/2 lb of authentic Polish sausage so I used that and a whole link of a national chain packaged brand, though it’s mostly an OK substitute once you’ve had the real thing.  Mozzarella just seemed too mild a taste for sauerkraut and Polish sausage, so I used sharp cheddar.  I didn’t have enough mashed potatoes for 3 scoops (I’ll know better for the next time), but had a generous enough (for this time) scoop for each one.  OMG!  We ate the authentic sausage ones first, of course.  But this definitely enhanced the taste of the packaged sausage, more than I imagined.  I sent a photo to all my family.  Absolutely a keeper

This was easy to make.  I had 6 people over for cards and made enough for 8.  Ended up wit a lot of left overs for lunch.  I used to large jars of Sauerkraut which was way more than enough.  I like  Sauerkraut to be sour so I did not clean it or add brown sugar.  I liked the way the flavors mixed with the meat.  I did not have and left out the cheese.  I am not sure it made a difference.   I will definitely do this dish again.

Shredded cheese didn't want to stay on sausage. Think I will use sliced cheese and divide each slice into thirds and put one or two pieces on the top. I love cheese, but it wouldn't hurt to just leave the cheese off. I served a nice tossed salad  and had dinner rolls to complete the dinner. Didn't even get to the rolls.  Sausage and salad were all we really needed. Will definitely make again.

I really liked this recipe.  I'm a big kielbasa and sauerkraut fan.  The potatoes were a great addition.  And there is no way I would ruin a dish with instant potatoes.  I went out and bought some Bob Evans pre-made mashed potatoes at the grocery store.

I love each ingredient in this fast meal, so of course I love this meal.  I took some recommendations to boil the sauerkraut first.  I used Swiss cheese, and served mustard on the side.  Sort of reminds me of a kielbasa split especially with 3 scopes of mashed potatoes for the "ice cream".

Super easy! I made it with turkey kielbasa and skipped the sauerkraut because I didn’t have any on hand. I added garlic to plain mashed potatoes and used farm cut cheese. Amazing.

I made it but changed a few things.  I remember my grandmother would fix food like this as a casserole.  I sliced up the keilbasa into small chunks and did not boil (all I could think of was boiling the flavor out of the sausage).  The sausage chunks we placed at the bottom of a 8"x8" casserole dish.  Then followed by the kraut (I used about two cups).  Love that kraut!!  Then I used a ready made Jimmy Deans garlic mashed potato (after heating in the microwave as per directions) layered over the kraut. Followed by the grated cheese.  I had to pre-heat the oven to approximately 380 degrees and longer than directed.  Just keep an eye on the cheese and take it out when it gets a nice golden brown.

Really enjoyed this.  We added fresh chopped jalapeños on top before baking. Gave it just a little kick.  After making I read reviews and I bet I would like this better with cheddar cheese. Will try cheddar next time.  But overall a good easy tasty dish

I made the changes suggested by mummacita, adding dry onion soup mix to the sauerkraut and using sharp cheddar instead of mozzarella.  I used microwave Bob Evans garlic mashed potatoes and served with brown stoneground mustard on the side.  It was very tasty and filling.  It had a nice acidic bite to it to cut through the fatty aspect and was definitely not bland.  I could see craving this...

I want to try this, but I will wait until the temp outside is below 90 and the heat index is 100!  I think I will do what I do when I make pork chops and sauerkraut and add sweet onions and apple sauce.  Can't wait!!!

Awesome dish and very simple to make! I'm gonna try to use a red cabbage instead of sauerkraut next time. It might add just a bit more "bam" to the flavor, but this is definitely good as is.

Being a hot summer day.  I put them on a sheet on the  grill.  350 for 11 minutes.  They came out very good.  I had to halve the recipe, because I am cooking for one.

We used: extra lean Kielbasa from a coil (eliminated boiling the meat); dijon/regular mustard; sauerkraut was drained; real mashed potatoes (not instant);  slices of real old cheddar cheese (not processed).

On a keto diet, the mashed potatoes are verboten.  However, mashed cauliflower is an excellent substitute, and goes well with all the other ingredients.  This is a keeper,  I will be making it again.

A blast from the past ! My grandmother who was German , made this all the time for us when we were growing up and we are still making this 50 years later! She always put some old fashioned mustard on top of the cut kielbasa then all except real mashed potatoes and topped it with cheddar ! For sure a real winner ! If you think it’s bland try hot mustard it’s a winner

Was a hit at my house.  I would like to make it again but next time with homemade garlic mashed potato's.  I"m just not a fan of instant so if you're not either make your own.  But was good.

DELICIOUS!! Personal preference made me tweak this just a bit but I'm sure my results are very similar to the recipe as written. I used turkey kielbasa (so I didn't boil it first), I made mashed red potatoes with a little garlic added instead of instant, and I had an open brick of cheddar already so I used that. This was seriously so tasty and so simple. I paired it with some asparagus and it was a perfect, filling meal.

Nice change up for kielbasa! My 6 year-old son who doesn't like mashed potatoes liked it! I made real mashed potatoes and instead of sauerkraut, I caramelized some onion and topped with that and the mozzarella cheese.  To me, the caramelized onion made all the difference in the world--delicious!! I'll be putting this into my kielbasa recipe rotation--Thanks!

Awesome!  We didn't use the sauerkraut because we're not sauerkraut people but it was still great without.  We added a pat of butter to the top of each one and kept it in the oven for an additional 20 minutes or so to give the top a twice baked potato type texture.  And if you can only find 14 oz. kielbasa as I did, one 3.3 oz bag of Betty Crocker instant mashed potatoes is plenty.

This is a great idea : ) My oven works terribly so I grilled the kielbasa, added the mashed potatoes/cheese and just stuck it in the microwave without the sauerkraut. Turned out great.

This was pretty good, though I didn't have the saurkraut, which I really like.  I also used cheddar cheese on most and swiss cheese on 1.  Both were good, but the swiss would have been really good with the saurkraut.  Next time I will probably make my own mashed potatoes, in order to cut down on the salt.  The instant potato mix that I used seemed pretty salty on its own, then add the kielbasa, and for my taste, was too salty.  My kids really liked it, though.

This was a good idea for left over mashed potatoes. I followed orginal receipe, and we liked it. Next time I will make with out kraut, I didn't care for mixture too much....I ate my kraut on the side.

This was really good. I did make some changes like other reviewers did. I cooked my sauerkraut w/ onions and added salt & pepper to taste. Used instant mash and also added garlic salt & a little sour cream. Top it off w/ sharp cheese...Hubby loved it. He doesn't care for sauerkraut. Tastes really good the next day. Yummy!!!! Will make again...

This was a great meal.  My family really enjoyed it. I did follow what others suggested and cooked the sauerkraut with some onion soup to add flavor.  Also, I used cheddar and it was delicious and pretty.  Thanks for this recipe.

There is something to be said about kraut and taters the family loves this recipe, and it is so easy we put them on hogie buns after they came out of the oven.  it was too big to eat like a hot dog but with a fork, the bread helped mello the kielbasa taste

I made this for dinner last night as a last resort, I had a Kielbasa, and no idea what to do with it, well, this was perfect.  It was so quick and easy, and I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand.  My boyfriend does not like sauerkraut but he LOVED this!

I found this recipe a couple of years ago and just joined All Recipes as a member, so I thought I would review it.  This is SO good, just the way it is.  :)  We passed on the recipe to our best friends and they said they would never eat Kielbasa plain again because this is so fabulous.  Thanks so much!

YUM YUM! This is now one of our go-to meals as it is quick and easy. It is a good variation from the "traditional" kielbasa.

Yum yum yum! I made homeade garlic mashed potatoes instead of the boxed kind (personal preference). But this was very good. My boyfriend and all of his roommates loved it!

I've been making this for years and it's still a favorite with the entire family.  I make this with turkey kielbasa (very good) and a four cheese mixture.

This was a very easy recipe.  I also used homemade mashed potatoes and added garlic powder to them.  The sauerkraut gave it a very nice flavor.  Will make again.

Easy quick dinner. Husband liked it. I liked it, but I'm polish--kielbasa and kraut is good with anything. A little plain, but overall good and easy.

This was great! I'm not a fan of instant mashed potatoes but this was really good. They didn't taste instant once it was put togeather. Cheddar was better unless you want it low-fat and then mozz. is better. I served it with fried apples which went absolutely perfect with it!

I made this with lite kielbasa, and substituted shredded Swiss cheese for the mozzarella. It was delicious! I used the roasted garlic mashed potato recipe from this site, that's a winner too! My husband (who doesn't like sauerkraut) agreed to try it because of other reviews re: people who also don't like sauerkraut loving this, and he absolutely loved it, too! Great recipe, thank you.

This was a great recipe. Since I didn't have the garlic roasted instant potatoes, I used Betty Crocker 4-cheese instant potatoes and I used grated cheddar cheese.  These were very filling and I could only eat one.  I will definitely make these again.

I am the only one in my family that likes sauerkraut, but I wanted to try this one.  Once the other tried it they loved it!  Even those you don't care for sauerkraut will like this one.

This was a great recipe with and without the sauerkraut. I baked a little longer though and broiled the tops of the mashed potatoes, it was awesome!

I used "lite" kielbasa so I skipped the boiling step. I had never made instant mashed potatoes before and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the roasted garlic variety. This was tasty and very easy.

This was very good.  All I had was a bag of kraut, so I put a layer down first, put the kielbasa on top, more kraut and then the mashed potatoes.  I added the cheese to the mashed potatoes instead of putting it on top.  Would make this again.

We love this recipe for nights when we need a quick dinner. It's fast and very good! I slice the kielbasa in the bottom of the pan so it's easier for my kids to eat. I have made this several times and have been happy with the results every time.

Instead of the instant potatoes, I used "Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes" (also from this site) and it was wonderful.  We do not like sauerkraut so I served it with steamed cabbage instead.

Excellent!!  And this is coming from someone who grew up in a Polish family!!  Been looking for something different to do with kielbasa and will definitely make this again!!
