I gave it four stars for the potential .. I should have added more salt. and less olive oil . It was drowning in it all. I believe that  diluted the flavor.  It was good though  and easy, will make again and I"ve posted a pic too.I did add the lemon should have used more. and Ill add more tomatoes too next time.

A much needed twist on baked chicken & vegetables. We really enjoyed it. I made a few modifications: cut amount of potatoes in half and added mushrooms & broccoli to the suggested vegetables. I would also suggest a whole onion instead of just half. Enjoy!

I thought this was just okay. The potatoes don't get tender enough and were still kind of hard. It also seemed like it was missing something, but I can't put my finger on what. It wasn't horrible, but I don't think I'll make this one again.

I used frozen chicken breasts and fresh cauliflower, asparagus, baby potatoes, onion and garlic.  Turned out delicious.

This was really good. I used broccoli instead of asparagus and cut the potatoes into bite size pieces.

What a pleasant surprise!  I scaled back to 3 servings and even then only used 1 potato, because that's all I had.  It was fine.  I actually can't imagine using that many potatoes.  I don't have a roasting pan, so just cooked at 400 in a 9x13 for 40 minutes and it was done.  Very nice flavor, plenty of spices/seasoning.  Quite enjoyable!

I made this with my 8 year old pretty easily.  I did not use the butter, however, and would add more salt also.  Next time I will try the lemon juice and rind as well.
