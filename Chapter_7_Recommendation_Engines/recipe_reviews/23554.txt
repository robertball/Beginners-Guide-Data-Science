I think the first reviewer made the same mistake that I made.  The recipe should read "1 6oz can".  When I made this recipe for the first time at my cousin's home, my cousin, Ruth, said she did not realize that limeade came in a 6 oz size.  Apparently, the person who posted this recipe didn't either.  This recipe is very good using 6 ounces of limeade.  I will use it again.

Ew. These need twice as much limeade, half of the amount of rum, and half the carbonated water. In other words, make a whole new recipe. As is this tasted like watered down rum. Nobody liked them.
