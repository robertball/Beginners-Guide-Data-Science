I used crunchy peanut butter, substituted 1/3 cup cocoa powder for half of the flour and chocolate chips for the peanuts, and reduced baking powder to about 1/4 tsp. They got devoured...

I added another 1/2 cup of peanut butter to make it even more "peanut buttery".  PLUS, I added 1 cup of Chocolate Chips! Tasted like a Peanut Butter cup. Very yummy!

These were okay.  The picture is false advertising though, even if you add cocoa.

Depending on how "nutty" you want them, and if you decide to go with a chunky/extra chunky peanut butter, you can leave out the loose nuts. If you would rather a non-chunky-nutty brownie, add 1/4 cup of creamy PB and substitute 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract for almond extract.

These were good.  I ran out of brown sugar and substituted white sugar.  I also left out the peanuts and replaced with chocolate chips.  I also made this with natural peanut butter.  Once the "brownies" cooled, I made a quick icing out of melted semi-sweet chocolate, more natural peanut butter, confectioners' sugar and thinned it with a little milk.  I frosted them with this icing, and they looked and tasted even better.  I am not a huge peanut butter fan, but my family and friends are, and they really enjoyed these!

I've made this recipe two nights on a row now. I needed something to make tht was quick and easy and had the ingrediants for as shoppimng day is two days away! the second time I made it it was far better, used only one egg instead of two and added the cocoa that was mentioned here. Had to cook it for 35 minutes and it turned out great.

Wonderful! I was out of peanuts so I used crunchy peanut butter- as I like peanut butter and chocolate and had a trough (I bought a lot when they wernt on sale after X-mas) of Hershey's Kisses, I threw a bunch of those in as well and they were gobbled up! This second time I made them I added the kisses again, used smooth peanut butter, and tossed in a small bag of chopped pecans. They're in the oven now!

This was a great recipe but a little bland.  It needs a little more.  Perhaps peanut butter frosting or chips.

I took advice from one of the ratings and these brownies were amazing! I used crunchy peanut butter, 1/3 cup cocoa powder, 1/3 flour, Â¼ tsp baking powder, and a half and half of peanut butter chips and chocolate chips. Yum!

Followed recipe and the suggestion of adding baking cocoa.  Used 1/4 cup cocoa and 1/4 cup plus 2 tbsp. flour.  Cut back the baking powder to 1/2 tsp., and added to the mix 1/2 pkg. of milk chocolate toffee bits.  Found the brownies needed a longer period of time baking - 35 minutes.  Came out a lovely chocolate colored brownie, very moist and rich. Next time I will follow suggestion on toffee bits pkg of baking the brownies, taking out of oven, then sprinkling bits on top, covering with foil, and leaving the foil on until they are completely cooled.  Think this will provide a toffee crunch rather than melting them right in the batter.

These are absolutely delicious! Everyone in my house ate them right up. The only suggestions I have are substituting 1/3c of the flower with cocoa powder. I also used a whole cup of peanut butter to make it more tasty, so I added another table spoon of butter. Definitely a keeper!!

I used crunchy peanut butter since it was what I had at home and double the amount of peanut butter (cause there's things in life you can't have enough of... health, money, peanut butter...), these turned out amazing, I'll be definitely making these again.

This recipe should call for cocoa powder!  I followed recipe exactly and wished I had added the cocoa powder!  They tasted alright... just seemed they were missing something... like CHOCOLATE!! I ended up adding ice cream and chocolate syrup on top and then they were good.

Well, I was looking for something peanut-buttery... and decided to give this recipe a shot. It turned out Delish! I wouldn't say it's a "chewy" brownie, but definitely soft & moist. I added walnuts instead of salted peanuts. I'm very pleased with this and will make it again.

I followed the recipe except the peanuts(didn't have any, replaced with chocolate chips).. 
Only 3 star rating because even though I cooked them for 22 minutes, they came out dry and gritty textured...still tasty but more cake texture then brownie..
Also agree with person who said picture is false advertising...they are brownish in color..NOT chocolate unless u add cocoa, will do next time...

These are really good, peanutty and chewy. I didn't want to dilute the peanut butter flavour with chocolate, so I stuck to the chopped peanuts. I will definitely be making these again, they are so easy to make, great for when a quick treat is needed.

These were great! I used 1/3c cocoa for half the flour, cut baking powder back to 1/2tsp and tossed in some milk choco chips and peanut butter chips I needed to use up. Delicious plenty of peanut butter flavor and not overly sweet.

There must be something wrong with this recipe because they all disappeared minutes after they were done! I was doubting because there is no chocolate but the peanut butter stands alone. I altered nothing and they were delicious!

These were just ok.  I added cocoa powder and chocolate chips and that is what I think made these a bit better, but as it is, it's not so good.  Peanuts don't really go well with brownies, walnuts maybe, but not peanuts.  I'd only recommend this recipe if you omit the peanuts, and add cocoa or chocolate chips, and more peanut butter too.  Oh well, better luck next time.

Followed the directions, with only one change. I added 2T of cocoa. It was a bit too bland and a bit too cakey.  Will not be making it again.

This sounded yummy, but I made adjustments. I replaced vanilla extract with liquid hazelnut creamer and put in a cup of chocolate chips and a cup of marshmallows. It only cooked for 15 min. before the marshmallows looked like they were going to burn. Not a problem. Still firm and chewy. I added a melted chocolate chip layer to smooth out the lumpy surface.

I just baked these up, and they are pretty good.  It was quick and simple, all with ingredients I had on hand.  My fiance loves them.  I added 2 tbsp baking cocoa as someone else suggested, otherwise followed the recipe.  Mine had to bake for 30+ minutes, when I took them out the middle was still moist but I figured it would finish up with the leftover heat as it cooled... I didn't want to burn the edges. I do enjoy them, not too sweet, but still a little bland.  I think adding something like maple syrup would liven it up, but I'm a terrible baker so I can't stray from recipes too much lol.

This was a great quick and easy recipe I used crunchy peanut butter and swirled chocolate syrup on top and it marbled through the whole thing, it seemed a little drub to us so we added cream cheese frosting on top also and it was great!

Recipe is easy to follow and really delicious. I used wheat flour and used unsalted peanuts. I poured 1 cup of chocolate chips on top of the brownies after they were baked. I turned the oven off and placed the brownies in there so the chocolate would melt (few minutes). Then I evenly spread the chocolate all over the brownies. They are absolutely delicious!

These were good.  Wouldn't change a thing.  They were good straight out of the oven, but they get better and chewier after you let them cool off.

These are very moist and yummy!  I skipped the chopped peanuts (just because I didn't have any on hand) and added 1 cup semi sweet chocolate chips.  There seems to be mixed opinions on the baking time.  I say, be careful not to over-bake these!  They may seem under done when they first come out of the oven, but they definitely firm up as they cool.

These were pretty good. I reduced the flour to 1'3 cup and added 1/3 cup cocoa, as other users suggested. But for some reason, after I mixed all the ingredients in accordance with the directions, they were more of a cookie dough consistency. I added another egg and about a 1/4 cup of milk to make it a batter. But they cooked up well and did taste quite good, regardless. Maybe needs more PB next time though.....

Good starter recipe.  My 12 year old made these.  I would highly recommend using the peanut butter frosting from this site to top these babies....  I added Pecans because that is what we had.  Thanks for an easy recipe...All the brownies are gone.....   :)

I don't even like brownies, but I really enjoyed these!  I, too, added some cocoa powder and a little extra white sugar, as well as some almond extract. I also used crunchy peanut butter instead of p/b and peanuts separately.  They were delicious!

These were ok, but nothing too special. I added choco chips instead of peanuts, which I think helps the sweetness and the flavour. Won't be making them again though.

These sounded good.  It isn't that they tasted really bad, they were just very greasy.  Also, they didn't seem to ever really firm up and were very flat.  Won't be making them again....sorry.

Wasn't much of a brownie as it was a cake.  It needed some sort of frosting on top.  Very plain.  It just wasn't what I anticipated.

most definitely a 5 star! So amazing and moist. I had no peanuts, so I omitted them. Instead I added a cup of chocolate chips. I recommend this to all occasions!

Really really good. Nice and moist and chewy. I did use a 9x9 pan and baked for 22 mins and they were prefect. I ended up making a second batch after tasting the first one. Super easy to throw together with stuff you normally have on hand a total keeper.

I loved the texture and moisty-goodness of these yummy treats.  These are a Must Try.  

On another occasion,  when my blood-chocolate level was very low, I threw in 1/3 cup cocoa powder as well, and they turned out delicious!! 
Thanks for this recipe.

My roommate said "4 and 3/4s" but I thought a 4.. it baked up with a great crust and was pretty gooey inside. I did add the extra PB as suggested by other reviewers, because you can ALWAYS have more peanut butter!

I used crunchy peanut butter, and added about a 1/2 cup extra to make it more peanut-buttery, since I love peanut butter--but I think it would have been better with the original amount. Substituted 1/3 c. cocoa powder for half the flour, which would probably have been a good change except that I couldn't taste the chocolate through all the PB. I was going to use choc. chips instead of peanuts, but forgot to add them, so when I was done baking I just melted some chips on top. It was yummy but next time I think I'll put the chips inside the brownies instead. They turned out good, a little too cake-y for me, but that might have been because of all the changes I made. Next time I think I'll stick closer to the actual recipe. They were GREAT with vanilla ice cream though! :)

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out very dry and crumbly. Not chewy at all, like the recipe claims. I also agree with another reviewer that it was kind of bland, needs something more to it. Definitely will not make this again.

i substituted half the flour for cocoa, but i must have missed the part where more sugar was added.  They need much more sugar if you add cocoa.

This recipe calls for NO chocolate, so they're really a peanut butter cookie bar. I even added 1/3 cup cocoa for half of the flour as suggested and they turned out only slightly chocolate-y. Try using melted chocolate chips or even more cocoa powder to achieve the results shown in the picture. I would recommend only creamy peanut butter and the addition of peanut butter chips as well; this gave creamier results.

These are the most delicious brownies EVER.  I made them once last winter during a snow storm, and they absolutely got me through it.  They are unbelievably divine.

I'm always on the lookout for a good dessert recipe since my DH is allergic to chocolate. This was great-- had the richness of brownies just with peanut butter. I followed the recipe except I used crunchy PB so I left out the extra nuts. I'm sure it would be great with choc chips. The photo really is not right; the brownie shown is chocolate.

These were quite good, although I don't consider them to have an overly strong peanut butter flavour, despite them being called Peanut Butter Brownies.  I made a full plus half of the recipe (for 18 servings) & baked in a 9" square pan.  I did swap out some of the flour and added some good quality dark cocoa powder (ratio was 2/3 cup flour and 1/3 cup cocoa).  Frosted with One Minute Chocolate Icing from this site...yummy!

These were tasty and easy to make, but like other reviewers, I recommend reducing the sugar and adding chocolate chips. I also undercooked them just slightly so they would be a little gooey in the middle - it was the perfect balance between cakey-ness and gooey-ness.

This recipe was good but a little plain. I would advise adding some chocolate in. Also, the picture is false advertising; it does not look anything like it. Overall, I would give this 4 out 5 stars.

Turned out pretty well. But I would suggest adding 2 - 3 tablespoons of dark cocoa. Depending on your taste, definatly got the color I wanted after I had added the second time.

Wow!  This is great!  I have a boyfriend that can't have chocolate and sleep together so I made these (he is a peanut butter hound) and he is begging me to make it once again.  It is so simple and so good.

This was very good. I doubled the recipe and still only used 2 eggs. I used 4 tablespoons of cocoa and 1 and 1/4 c peanut butter. I also used chocolate chips and omitted the peanuts cause I didn't have any on hand. This is a keeper!

Because this recipe doesn't have any chocolate in it I replaced the nuts with smooshed mini peanut butter cups. And I also just spread melted chocolate chips on top as a candy crust! It's sweet but broken up as small bites it's great with coffee!!

I made these for a friend's birthday, and had to use egg substitute which made them super crumbly and not very consistent.  Otherwise, quite good!

These came out perfect! They were moist like a brownie. I doubled the recipe and used splenda brown sugar and also added chocolate chips instead of peanuts. In addition I used chunky peanut butter instead of creamy. I'll be making these again!

I think 25 minutes is too long to bake this dish. Mine turned out a little too done around the edges. I also added whole salted peanuts. Should have crushed them. The taste is good though. Next time I'll do it a little different.
I'll review it again, hopefully with better results.

Rating is for recipe as written - I made a batch of the original and then one with 1/3 c cocoa and 1/3 c flour and the cocoa batch was FAR better - 5 stars for that one.

Absolutely delicious!  I doubled the recipe (bake for 45 mins if you do this!), substituted half of the flour for cocoa powder (2/3 cups of each for a double batch), added chocolate chips instead of peanuts, and they came out the right amount of gooey and chewey.  :)  This is a dangerous recipe to have around for those late night chocolate cravings!

This was very good.  I followed previous reviews and used 13 cup cocoa instead of half of the flour.  I also added 1 cup chocolate chips instead of peanuts.  Great recipe.  I will make again!

I was raised on desserts such as  home made peanut butter cookies and this is the best ever. Almost like MOMS.

First of all, don't go by the picture posted with the recipe. It obviously is wrong because there's no cocoa powder in these!  Anyway, I baked the brownies for 25-30 minutes like the recipe said and they were way too gooey at the end. I ended up putting them in for 10 minutes longer, but then they were dry. I didn't care for these, sorry.

They were pretty good. I used natural peanut butter (no added sugar) and a heaping cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of peanuts. The taste was delicious - just the right amount of sweetness. The texture was more cakey than I would have liked.

These had a good flavor, but were very flat compared to most brownies.  Maybe it was because I baked them in a glass baking pan?  Good flavor, but I ended up splitting them horizontally and sandwiching the halves with raspberry filling for PB&J brownies - just to give them a little height.

What a surprise! I was looking for a last minute quick recipe to take to a party.  I didn't even add the peanuts and they still have an awesome full-peanutty taste.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will make these over & over.  I also put a thin layer of chocolate frosting on top of mine.  Penny

These came out really good. I did omit the peanuts though and added 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder. Next time I think Iâll try chocolate morsels instead of the cocoa powder and maybe sprinkle it with some party nuts.

Pretty yummy! We did the 2tbs cocoa that was suggested which was nice. I think it needed more salt or maybe some chocolate chips to kick it up a notch though ;) Iâll try that next time. Thanks!

These are my husband's favorite dessert. I use 1 cup of milk chocolate chips in place of the peanuts. They have a nice, soft, chewy texture.

I accidentally added too much butter so they turned out (a LITTLE bit) melted. When I first took them out of the oven, it was a huge dome. After 30 minutes, it deflated a LOT. If I do make this recipe again, I would make sure I had the correct amount of butter(oops) and I would definately half the amount of baking powder. I would also try using smooth peanut butter (I used crunchy) and maybe adding the salted chopped peanuts?

Thanks for sharing a great recipe! I made this and a chocolate one for a crowd. There was nothing left, not even crumbs! The peanut butter went fast! This is a keeper! I used crunchy peanut butter, omitting the nuts called for in the recipe, and added peanut butter chips.

Very peanut buttery. I added in a tablespoon of cocoa powder and didn't put in the peanuts and it turned out great. I made a layered dish with this recipe and put a layer of regular brownie on the bottom with this on top of it. Then I made the filling for a chocolate pie to cover all of it and topped it with a dollop of whipped cream. Yum!

Amazing brownie! It sort of reminded me of my favorite dessert, the Chilli's Paradise pie. I added 1/3 cup of chocolate Nesquik, used 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour and instead of salted peanuts I used pecans. Next time I might use less sugar, though, because it is extremely sweet!

Always a big hit when I make these! I always substitute semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of peanuts though. I stir them into the batter, and then sprinkle some on the top. Be careful not to overcook these, as they're MUCH better soft.

great recipe! I got a bit confused with some of the recommended changes and ended up adding 1/3 c unsweetened coco powder without reducing the flour. The dough was really thick but I baked it anyway and was surprised that it turned out great.

I thought this was okay.  I would add choc. chips the next time.  I did do what some others suggested and added baking cocoa but still not enough of a brownie for me. I guess I'm use to more of a choc taste and so that's why I'm not rating it low because it turned out good but not tasty or sweet enough for me. Thanks for sharing.

It's definitely good enough to keep.  When I made it I found the batter to be a bit too crumbly (maybe I did something wrong?), so I added a splash of milk to it.  I didn't have creamy peanut butter so I used crunchy - therefore I left out the nuts.  I also added some chocolate chips (like someone below suggested), and a few teaspoons of chocolate syrup.  It gave it a very interesting taste, but I liked it!

This is a yummy recipe.  We were in the mood for some peanut butter and chocolate, and needed something new.  I added both peanuts and chocolate chips; next time, I'll only use the chocolate, the peanuts didn't work for us.  They aren't super peanut buttery, but rich peanut buttery enough!  Would be fabulous with ice cream!

Very good tasting brownies. I added a little more peanut butter and substituted 1/3 of cocoa powder instead of flour. I also substituted 2 teaspoons cocoa powder to the wet mixture. The turned out a little dry. I think because I cooked them too long. Very good!!!!

these were good.  if you like peanut butter i suggest you add a little more.  also when cooking careful not to cook to long.  using a toothpick to test seemed to make them cook too long if you like brownies to be a bit gooey in the middle be sure to take them out.  i used chunky peanut butter and added chocolate chips!!

I started making these late at night when I was craving something chocolately and peanut buttery, and realized there wasn't any chocolate in recipe, so in a rush, dumped in a package of cook and serve chocolate pudding mix, 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder, and about 1/4 cup vegetable oil and an extra egg to try to balance out the moisture.  Came out pretty good, but more on the cake side.  I will probably make again, but add less flour to make it more moist, like a brownie.

I love this recipe! I gave it 5 stars because I followed some of the reader suggestions, and did 1/2 cocoa, 1/2 flour, and I should have added more sugar, BUT, I think if I had followed the recipe it would have been sweet enough. And I did the crunchy peanut butter and smooth mix. Love it!!! A new favorite, and a nice change from straight up chocolate.

These were delicious!  I used a few ideas from other reviewers:  I doubled the batch using a 13 x 9 pan and baked about 35 to 40 minutes.  For the original amount, I used 3/4 cup peanut butter chips for the peanuts, added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts.  I also used 3/4 cup of crunchy peanut butter.  For one recipe, I substituted cocoa powder in place of one-half of the flour.  Personally, I like the recipe that used all flour and no cocoa.  But then, I was looking for a non-chocolate recipe.  Very good indeed - I will definitely keep this for future use.

Exactly! Mine came out a light creamy, brown color. I don't think it could turn into a chocolate-brown color like the one in the photo. Anyway, it tastes good! : )

Very good!  So rich and tasty.  I doubled the recipe, used chocolate chips instead of nuts, chunky pb, 2/3 cup cocoa powder for half the flour.  I only baked them for 35 minutes and the middle was baked but super gooey, just how we like them.  I think 45 minutes would've been too long for my taste.  Will be making these again, but not too soon since the double batch will last awhile.

This was delicious!  My family loved it.  The peanut butter gives it a really chewy texture.  I substituted 1/3 of cup of unsweetened cocoa powder for a 1/3 of the flour.  I also gave the peanuts a quick rough chop before adding.  I also added Â½ cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I left the rest of the recipe the same.  Yummy!

My family loves these!  I've made them twice so far and they never stay around too long.  I substituted chocolate chips for the peanuts like suggested by someone else and they were great!  Next time I'm going to try making them w/cocoa.  Yum! :)

This was a hit with my family! I substituted 1/3 c. cocoa as suggested by another reviewer. I also substituted peanut butter chips for the chopped peanuts. Thanks!

This was a good recipe. I used honey roasted peanuts (it's all I had)and I added 2 tablespoons of cocoa like some others suggested and they came out a bit dry. Next time I will cut down on the flour and see if that helps.

I liked these OK.  I did not have peanuts on hand so I omitted them but it still turned out OK.  I also only had a 9x9 pan so I only baked for 20 minutes.  I think next time I will definately use the peanuts and probably will add some chocolate chips too.

Easy to make, I used chunky peanut butter and added chocolate chips.  Looks nothing like picture though since no chocolate is used.  Might need to use chocolate frosting on top if desired.  Otherwise good!

I thought this recipe was pretty good, although I found with mind that the outside got a touch crunchy while the middle was really soft, I had to bake it for about 10 minutes longer.  My 4year old just loves them...that could be because I added chocolate chips lol!!

Great recipe! These are definitely on the line between brownie and cake, they're moist and not too rich. I also added chocolate chips, and they worked very well.

Delicious, moist peanut butter brownies that can be whipped up quickly with ingredients I have in my pantry.  Everyone who tried them loved them and I got several requests for the recipe.  I did add 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips because I love the taste of peanut butter and chocolate.

Yummy recipe!!!  I added 1C chocolate chips and 1C peanut butter chips to the recipe instead of peanuts (I was out)and they still came out great--a little moist just the way my 3 yr old likes them!

I first baked these last spring because I had given up chocolate for Lent.  They are so addictive!  They are wonderful as is, but also great with chocolate chips or chocolate frosting.

These came out wonderfully moist and chewy.  I used crunchy peanut butter so I used 3/4 cup and omitted the chopped peanuts.  How simple is that.  For each serving, I microwaved the brownie for 15-20 seconds (if they had time to cool!) and topped it with chocolate chocolate chip ice cream.  What a treat!  Thanks Vera!

I doubled this recipe and baked it in a 13-by-9 pan.  They were awesome. Moist and chewy. Everyone loved them.  I had to make more quickly because they disappeared so fast.  Thanks.

Oh my gosh, these are delicious!!! I added a generous handful of semi-sweet choc chips to the batter, and I also threw a few on top toward the end of the cooking - they softened up (obviously) so I used a knife to smoosh them about for frosting. I just asked my husband to describe them in one word, and he said 'YUMMERZ!!.' This is a great recipe - cheap, quick and tasty. Thank you!

These brownies are so delicious!  I took these to my Dad's for dinner today and they disappeared in minutes.  When I got home tonight, I made another pan for my husband to take to work tomorrow.  That's how good they are!  These are a great alternative to traditional chocolate brownies.  Next time I make these, I may add some chocolate chips to the batter.  This one is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!
