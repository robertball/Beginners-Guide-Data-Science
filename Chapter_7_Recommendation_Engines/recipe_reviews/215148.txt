Delicious! I added nutmeg & used turbinado sugar instead of the other sugars.

The store didn't have plums so I used peaches and raspberries. It was pretty good although the peach did stand out a tad. Crust was awesome.

This has great fruit flavor, but the topping was too much, in my opinion. A good portion of it sank and mixed into the fruit juices, which gave everything a weird texture. I think halving the amount of topping might help that part. I also had to bake mine at least an extra 25-30 minutes to get the fruit cooked down and not be soupy, and to get the top browned. Part of that was my fault, as I realized too late that I used a Pyrex baking dish, which is not broiler safe. So make sure you use a broiler safe pan so you can properly brown the topping. I also felt it could use less sugar, and more raspberries, but that's personal preference.  I would make again, as I really enjoy the plum/nectarine/raspberry flavor combination, but I would definitely make a few adjustments. Thanks for the recipe!

I had never made a cobbler before and was looking for something universally appealing to make good use of our abundance of garden fruit... I used strawberries, peaches and pluots.  The neighborhood and my family want MORE.  Making it again now.  Thank you for a fabulous recipe!!

Liked it a lot. I used nectarines, strawberries, and black berries and grated one fresh ginger (but less of it). I may have put too much butter in the flour mixture but it still turned out. This is a keeper for me.
