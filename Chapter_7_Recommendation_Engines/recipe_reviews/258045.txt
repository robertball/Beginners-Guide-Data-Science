I loved the addition of fresh ingredients to the rice -- the lettuce, carrots and peas made this feel like a real salad. Instead of making individual lettuce cups, I used the same lettuce as a base for a built salad. I added the rice mixture on top of the lettuce, and then instead of mixing canned, flaked tuna in, I grilled ahi tuna steaks, sliced them and added them on top of the salad. This is a clever mix of textures and flavors. Nice job, Uncle Ben's!!

Great, easy to make healthy lunch or dinner. It was a little dry so I mixed in some creamy poppyseed dressing and that made it perfect! You can add anything you want to these! Will make again!

This recipe came at just the right time. Trying to watch my weight and bored with salads. This is perfect for my lunches on the go. Filling and great source of protein to get me through the day!  Will experiment with onion, green peppers, capers in future weeks!

I made myself a bowl for lunch today, and I do think it needed something to hold it all together because otherwise it was pretty dry.  I had some ranch dressing and so used that, but I think that a really nice flavored vinegar (like white balsamic with dill or tarragon or something like that) would have been much better.  I really like anything with wild rice, and so I was hoping for something a little more flavorful.  I'll give this a try again.  Thanks, Uncle Ben's!

My husband and I didn't care for this. It seemed dry and didn't have much flavor. I didn't think the tuna complemented the rice.
