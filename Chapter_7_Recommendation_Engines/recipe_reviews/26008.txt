This is wonderful!  As a previous reviewer wrote, it is excellent on the Black Magic cake (I made 2 today, one for us, one to give away).  I make 1-1/2 times the frosting recipe to fill and frost the Black Magic Cake.  Also, I add a teaspoon or 2 of boiling water to the dry coffee and cinnamon mixture to make them dissolve before adding them to the butter.  This makes the appearance less gritty and more smooth.

This recipe is fabulous. Gave it only 4* because I tweaked it way too much. Like other reviewers suggested, I mixed the sugar and milk in slowly, checking for consistency. When I checked the taste and consistancy  after 2 cups of sugar and about 1 tbsp of milk it was perfect. The frosting wasn't too sweet, which is the way we like it. I suspect 3 cups of sugar would make the frosting very sweet, which you may need when baking for kids. But here we are not too fond of extra sweetness, so I stopped with 2 cups. I also added about a cup of chopped nuts, which made the frosting extra special. I didn't add any vanila, but added another tsp of instant coffee. The coffee taste was perfect and not at all overpowering which I was apprehensive about. I used this frosting with a coffee cake, and the end result was fabulous. Will def be making this again, probably with a chocolate cake the next time. Btw, this recipe is not enough if you want to fill as well as frost a cake. I just frosted and it was just sufficient.

WOW! This is fantastic! I admit I didn't follow the recipe to a T. I didn't have instant coffee so I brewed strong coffee & used that instead of milk. I also added an extra .5 tsp of cinnamon. It was amazing! Goes so well with chocolate cake.

Update: I gave this a great review before anyone else had tasted it. Although I loved it, I should note that everyone else I served it to disliked it! They thought it was too sweet and/or didn't like the flavor. Some thought it was just ok. Just thought I should add that.

Omigosh this is my new favorite frosting.  I first tried it on the black magic cake, and let me tell you--perfect combination. Thanks to all the other reviewers for the suggestion! I don't keep instant coffee on hand, so when I brewed the very strong coffee for the cake, I brewed a little extra and used about 2/3 milk and 1/3 coffee where the recipe called for milk.  I definitely think that if you are having trouble reaching the desired consistency, do NOT keep dumping in powdered sugar, as it really takes away from the buttery cinnamon flavor that's to die for.  Instead I suggest using a minimal amount of liquid to get started and add more if needed.  My next use of this recipe will be to top my homemade cinnamon rolls! (At hubby's request) Thanks so much for an awesome recipe!

First off I want to say that this was an excellent base to an OUTSTANDING frosting only because I was missing a few ingredients and wanted to try a few substitutions for personal taste which is why I rate three stars (the original recipe lack actual cinnamon flavor, appears gritty, and is WAY overly sweet).

First I wasn't spending $4 on instant coffee for one teaspoon, I am on a budget here. So I took a measuring cup and put one part milk, one part REALLY strong brewed coffee, and a big spoonful of sour cream. I wanted the consistency to hold up, as my first batch wasn't stiff enough so I did add some shortening.

1tbs, Cinnamon, 1tsp 100% maple syrup, 2tbs Ghiradelli unsweetened cocoa powder, teeny tiny splash of vanilla extract and rum.

Fabulous texture, consistency, and the flavor was amazing!

If your frosting is too thin try using some Crisco.

Yum!  I made this with Black Magic Cake from this site, a great match.  I warmed up the milk prior and disolved the instant decaf coffee in that.  It turned out beautifully!

The cinnamon got lost in this recipe, so I ended up increasing it quite a bit. Very nice flavor combination between the cinnamon and coffee. You can play around with it to have either flavor play dominantly. I love this recipe and will use it again.

What a unique frosting flavor!  Very good on chocolate cake.  Save the step of mashing the instant coffee by dissolving it in a little water or the vanilla.  Excellent!!

I don't try new frosting/icing recipes often, but today I needed a new one and this was recommended to me. I am glad I tried it because it is fantastic. I don't drink coffee therefore I do not have instant coffee granules so I skipped that part. I used this frosting on sweet vanilla butternut cupcakes and added an extra sprinkle of cinnamon on top. The combination of this frosting with the cupcakes made them taste like a maple donut with cinnamon. So good!

Absolutely amazing ... made to top Cappuccino Bon Bons from this site. I did make a few minor modifications: I added a tbsp of unsweetened cocoa powder and a splash of vanilla flavored coffee creamer, and reduced the milk and confectioners' sugar by probably half (eyeballed it).  The result was an incredibly smooth, fluffy and absolutely delectable topping. I can't wait to try this on other desserts!

Awesome good!  I just kind of dumped and poured rather than strictly measuring anything, but I pretty much used the ingredients and measurements as directed.  I drink my coffee with cream, so I just reserved some of it to use for this frosting rather than the coffee granules and milk.  The coffee and cinnamon flavors are subtle but evident, and pleasantly so.  This was the perfect complement for Nutmeg Cake, also from this site.  Note:  Whether you use coffee with cream as I did, or the coffee granules with milk, donâ€™t add the full amount of liquid all at once!  Add a little at a time, only as needed, to achieve the proper spreading or piping consistency.

Tasty frosting.  I used Espresso (that is what I had) and 2 cups of sugar with only a tablespoon of heavy cream instead of milk.   The cake was covered in ganache made with chocolate and cappuccino chips.  This is a rich yet fun combination.

This was good, not as great as I was expecting though. I can't think of anything that's wrong with it, I guess maybe I just set my expectations very high based on the rave reviews I read. I will say that I don't see how the recipe as written could frost a whole cake. Maybe just over the top of a single layer, but not all over a layer cake. I made a half recipe and barely have any at all - it's ok because I made it just to put between the layers of a cake, but if I were wanting to frost all over an 8 or 9 inch layer cake, I would double this. 1/3 cup milk would also be WAY too much. I added less than 2T and it was a bit more runny than I wanted. Tastes good though.

I served this with "Dark Chocolate Cake II" and enjoyed its unique flavour.  It is a nice change from regular frosting and makes a chocolate cake have pizzazz.  I dissolved the coffee in a tbsp of hot water, then mixed with the cinnamon and would recommend this so the frosting is not gritty.

I used very strong coffee instead of instant, and no milk. It holds up beautifully and was a lovely presentation, but all I could taste was the cinnamon. Still, it works very nicely with Harvest Pumpkin Cupcakes from this site.

I'm giving this 4 stars for flavor only.  I don't know if I did something wrong but the consistency was too soft.  I added more powdered sugar and then it got to be too sweet.  I might try it again and cut down on the milk next time instead of adding more sugar.

Dissolved coffee, salt and cinnamon in a tiny bit of hot water as suggested. Found the icing too sweet, but the coffee, cinnamon flavors were great. 
This recipe is worth adjusting, and I definitely will get it worked out for our tastes.

I liked this a lot!  Nice coffee flavor with a hint of cinnamon.  I dissolved the instant coffee and cinnamon into a tiny bit of hot water as another person suggested to get rid of the grainy texture.  I frosted this over some chocolate cupcakes.  MmmmMmMm!!

I needed a frosting for coffee cupcakes and decided to try this recipe.
I totally agree with Alex that as written this is not enough frosting to frost a cake, only the top. 
I made the recipe as written, it was too soft and had a very strong cinnamon taste. 
I added more coffee and icing sugar to get the consistency to decorate the cupcakes. 
In the end I used:

2 tsps coffee granules
1/2 tsp cinnamon
2 tsps vanilla
1/2 cup butter
6 cups icing sugar
5 tbsps light cream 5%

It was enough to frost 24 cupcakes using my 1M tip to make roses.

Easy and yummy!  2 cups of powdered sugar and 2T milk worked for me.  I also dissolved the instant coffee in a splash of hot water before mixing.

3.5 star for me. I used decaf instant coffee granules. But it was a bit overwhelming for me, was very bitter. I had to make 2 batches Because the 1st batch was totally not to my liking, and I love coffee. The bitterness really through me for a loop. And my 1st batch didn't hold up very well at all. I believe it really has to do with the area you live in, because butter alot of times in my frostings don't make it very well from my house to the car if I'm taking it for a function. 1st batch flattened with in 5 minutes out side due to humidity....So 2nd batch. I knocked out the salt, changed the butter to vegetable shortening, increased the confectioners sugar to 4 cups and adjusted the milk as I went. Loads better for my turn out. I will make again with my adjustments. And with that in mind I paired the frosting with a personal cupcake recipe, Cinnamon Harvest Cupcakes. And I got rave reviews from my co-workers and family.

absolutely amazing. however i did make changes!!! I only used 2 cups of powdered sugar and a TB a milk like other users. I dissolved my coffee granules in about 2 TB of warm water before adding to the mix. i also used  a little less cinnamon than it called for because i was afraid that it would be too strong, but it was perfect. this frosting is perfect for any cake, especially chocolate! it ices beautifully. very smooth and keeps well on the cake. i will be using this frosting for the rest of my life! it tastes delicious and looks great! what more could you want a frosting to do?

Although I love cinnamon and I love coffee I must admit I was skeptical about the combination of those two, not to mention I could not imagine what this would taste like on chocolate cake. In the end, although my cake stuck to the pan and fell apart into pieces, and I ran out of powdered sugar (made some extra by grinding regular sugar in my blender), the flavors in this frosting were AWESOME!l  The cake was good too, even if the whole thing ended up being a trifle instead of a frosted cake.  I didn't hear any complaints! :)  Will make again.

I don't understand how this frosting worked, because I made it and it turned out very watery and dripping all over. It was more of an icing, and I am not sure if this was my mistake or the recipe itself!

This was very good flavor, but it needed more confectioners sugar, as it was runny as written. I put it on chocolate cake, it was a good pairing!

Wow, this was absolutely delicious! I cut the recipe way back, just because I wanted to test it for future use. I was intrigued when I seen two of my favorite dessert flavors. I have tried other recipes on here and the flavor was lacking on the title name. I do not care for cupcakes, but could see myself liking one with this icing as it had a more of an adult taste in my opinion. The only thing is I had to add a tad more powder sugar to get it what I consider thick enough to be usuable, but it still kept that caramel colored appearance.

This frosting is sooo yummy! But follow the directions, I added the milk and the sugar then read the directions to add little by little until desired consistency is reached. Doh! Well I ended up doubling the recipe with the exception of the milk. I also added 8oz of cream cheese since I was putting this on the Harvest Pumpkin Cupcakes. Very yummy this is definately a keeper!

Very good. Goes well with chocolate cake. Make sure to mash the instant coffee granules well to keep the frosting from having a grainy texture.

Great frosting!  I followed another reviewers suggestion and dissolved the granules in a couple table spoons of boiling water.  I was a bit nervous that the kids may not like the flavor but I was so wrong!  They loved it.  I used this frosting on the black magic cake and they meshed well together.

I used 2 tsp of instant coffee to get more of the coffee flavor. Didn't have any icing sugar,used granulated sugar with cornstarch.The other reviewers were right, 1/3 cup milk is too much, made it runny. It only thickened in the fridge. I will make it again,with less milk and see how it goes.

OMG ... this frosting is so delicious.  I was making the Black Magic Cake (on this site) and wanted a frosting that would go with it.  Man oh man, I made this and it was the hit at my Thanksgiving table.  Everyone raved about this and I had made a ton of other desserts, but this cake/frosting went first.  Delish!!!

Yum! I doubled the recipe and used on the  Black Magic Cake. Probably only needed 1 1/2 of the icing recipe to cover the cake. Like others, I added some hot water to the instant coffee, and didn't use all the milk.

I'd say this frosting would be great on any chocolate or coffee cake.

I am only giving this recipe four stars because of the consistency.  The taste is fantastic.  It is too runny though.  I dissolved my coffee in the vanilla and did not use all of the milk called for.  Mine still came out a little too soft.

Excellent combo, perfect on dark chocolate cupcakes.  I added a bit more liquid since I lose at icing cakes, and made it thinner for dipping the tops of the cupcakes in.  Such good flavor.  Gives a basic chocolate cake a little something more.

I thought this was good, not outstanding. It hardly made enough to frost a two layer cake.

INSANE! I want to eat this with a spoon!! I am using it to top some ho-hum cappuccino muffins...and it is taking them over the top! I didn't want to pipe the frosting so i used less sugar, but holy cow I can see this incredible frosting topping anything from cupcakes, to cookies, to brownies... anything. Just adjust the sugar and other ingredients as you see fit. Kick it up a notch--add some kahluh! YUM!!

I love this frosting. I used it on a chocolate cake. It was very good.  I took the advice of another reviewer and dissolved the coffee first and added milk as needed. Will make this over and over again.

Put this on top of a boxed brownie mix and it took the brownies over the top!  Use less milk than called for - used about 2 TBSP.  Have made this many times and always have people ask for the recipe!

This was excellent! I didn't use the coffee and instead I added nutmeg to put on carrot cake. I also substituted vanilla soymilk for the milk. It was a perfect complement and had rave reviews from the people at the party.

Okay, this was a WONDERFUL icing with just a few tweaks.  I omitted the milk and instant coffee and used about 1/3 cup of strong brewed coffee (dark roast).  Once I added the sugar, it was way too sweet, so I added a little bit (tablespoon or two) of butter flavored shortening to cut the sweetness and it turned out perfect.  Make sure to add the coffee in slowly so you can stop before the frosting gets runny.  And I find it helps using a high quality cinnamon or specialty cinnamon.  And of course, the stronger the coffee the better.  This recipe on a chocolate cake is pure heaven.  Thanks so much!

I made this to go with Black Magic Cake as recommended by other reviewers.  I'm not very good at making frosting, but I was pleased with the consistency.  The cinnamon flavor was nice (my husband LOVES cinnamon!), but I found it was a bit sweet for my taste.  I'm not sure how I could adjust that without changing the consistency of the frosting.  

I liked it enough I will use this recipe and experiment with it!

Thanks for the recipe!

Five stars all the way on this one!! It was great -- I made it for the nutmeg cake recipe on this site. This was really a fantastic icing that I am sure I will use many more times. It also seems very versatile and it would probably be great with any type of cake.

Made as written except dissolved instant espresso powder into 2T milk. Added about 1/4 t salt. Got the right consistency using only 2T milk, so add the milk until you get desired consistency. I think 2 t instant coffee would be a more pronounced flavor. If you like your frosting with a bit more coffee flavor, I think you could add the instant coffee until you get the desired result. Made enough to frost a 13X9 cake. Also beat frosting for several mins. at the end to get it light and fluffy. Put this on Nutmeg Cake from this site which was delicious!

This recipe in every way is so much better than store-bought frosting. I did follow another reviewer's suggestion and added a couple teaspoons of hot water to the coffee and cinnamon spice mixture before adding it to the butter.

I did dissolve coffee and cinnamon in a bit of hot water and used about a 1/2 cup less powdered sugar and just enough milk to reach desired consistency. Not grainy in my opinion. Very tasty. Just what I was looking for.

I made this icing pretty much according to the recipe, although I did dissolve the coffee in 1 tsp of water as suggested by other reviewers, and I added a bit more cinnamon. When I taste tested the icing, it was too sweet, but it worked well on the cake. Next time I make it I'll probably add more coffee and/or cinnamon to counterbalance the sweetness.

I liked the taste of the frosting, I had to double the recipe and added less milk. I wanted the frosting to be alittle thicker. I made cupcakes with caramel in the middle and was looking for a frosting with coffee in it. 
Thank  you for posting this.

A Mexican Mocha is my favorite espresso drink ... so after reading the other reviews, I doubled the instant coffee and cinnamon, dissolved it into the vanilla and a bit of the milk, then followed the recipe. Didn't take all of the milk to reach spreading consistency. Because of doubling the spices, the color was a bit darker than the recipe picture, but lovely on the super dark coffee chocolate cake. I finished just in time for my husband to get home from dialysis. He's the mocha cake junkie in the family.

Licking the bowl was my reward!

P.S. Next time I will increase this recipe by half ... this spread a little thin on a 9" two-layer cake.

I would make this again.  I modified it a little .  I used a good sized scoop of hot fudge topping (Sanders).  I also added a couple of tablespoons of flour to cut the sweetness.  I didn't use vanilla, I used Kahlua instead.  This is a recipe you can definitely experiment  with - it turned out great!

Absolutely amazing. I made cupcakes out of a Devils Food cake mix and topped them with this. Delicious! I'm not even a chocolate cake fan. I'm a fan of cinnamon and coffee though and mixed with the chocolate...Starbucks watch out!!!

This was excellent. Doubled the recipe, which resulted in more than enough to frost a 9" double layer chocolate cake.  I increased the instant coffee and cinnamon by 50% and finely ground them together in a coffee grinder. I always sift the confectioners sugar, then measure. 2 cups becomes almost 3 cups after sifting, which might explain why 3 cups (unsifted) is too sweet.

Although it tasted okay after I added more cinnamon and coffee, the texture was somewhat gritty and it was unattractive.

Oh my, this was wonderful.  I agree that a double batch should be made to fully frost a cake.  Also, using good quality cinnamon makes all the difference in the world--I never realized before how much.  I followed other reviews and started using saved coffee as my liquid (and instead of using instant for the coffee flavor), resulting in a frosting with a very strange texture and lacking the flavor of coffee--won't do that again. Switched to milk halfway through, added some instant coffee powder and saved the recipe.  Frosted a spice cake, which was good, but think I would prefer a chocolate cake--or even try it with graham crackers!  So good! Adding the cinnamon and the coffee powder to taste is the simplest way to control how strong those flavors are.

I really liked this recipe.  I made the cinnamon version first then I melted and added a few cappuccino chips to the next batch.  The cinnamon version tasted good on the Golden white cake with cream inside, and the Cappuccino version tasted best with the mocha cupcakes without cream inside.  All in all I really liked this recipe.

Used a heaping tsp of instant coffee which I disolved in a little bit of warm water. Increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp. Used maybe 2 1/2c of confectioners sugar and only added milk as needed.....way less than 1/3c. Just drizzled in the milk till I liked the consistency. SOOOOOOOO GOOD! Wow was this delicious on top of Black Magic Cake from this site. Made cupcakes for Memorial Day and my guests loved them. Different and very tasty if you slightly up the coffee and if you double the cinnamon as I did. Will definately make again. Thanks!

It tastes ok.  I personally like stronger coffee flevor.  The frosting hardends as time passes. I think I prefer meringue butter cream instead.

I used this frosting to frost spiced mocha cupcakes, and the combination was incredible.  This frosting came out the perfect piping consistency and the flavor was just perfect.  A definite keeper recipe that I will use again.

I LOVED the flavor of this frosting but I had a problem with it being too soft. I added the powdered sugar per directions plus a bit more. I was afraid to add too much over the ingredient amount for fear of making the frosting too sweet and taking away from the great  flavor. Any suggestions?

Used this frosting on a Prune Mocha Cake. Wish I would have read reviews. I ended up using all coffee instead of milk and I added the full amount which made the frosting a little looser. I had to add a whole other cup of powdered sugar to get it to firm up some. Flavor is very good, though it is a little sweet. Great paired with the cake for sure.

This is a wonderful, light frosting.  I used it on the Mexican Chocolate cake - very good pairing.  Double this recipe for a 2 tier cake.  I also added veg shortening (Crisco 1/2 cup to 1 cup butter)to give it a little more body.  There were comments about the frosting being too sweet - add more salt.  Salt helps to cut the sweetness in frosting.

I wanted to make cinnamon frosting but couldn't find a recipe.  I made this and omitted the coffee.  A little thin, but that was my fault for adding too much milk.  I had to adjust by adding more powdered sugar and cinnamon.  Went great with a ginger cookie recipe!

WHOA this icing is waaaay sweet for me. I followed the recipe but stopped adding sugar after 2 cups because it was already insanely sweet. I ended up adding more coffee and some unsweetened cocoa powder to try to add more FLAVOR and less sugar. 

I added it to the Black Magic cake on this site and wasn't a fan of the combination. I'll have to continue my search for the perfect frosting recipe...

Delicious and easy!  As recommended, I dissolved the coffee in a bit of hot water before adding to the mix, and added milk as needed for consistency instead of measuring it out.  I also sifted the sugar.  It would be great on pumpkin bread.  All 4 kids (ages 9-5) loved it as well.

I have made this several times, and it always is a hit.  Like other reviewers, I dissolve the coffee in the vanilla before adding.  Make sure to cream the butter really well before continuing on to get a nice, smooth frosting.  
Goes well with the Mexican Chocolate Cake, also on this site.

DE-LI-CIOUS!  I made a spice cake and found I didn't have any ready made frosting.  I made it according to the directions except I used 1 Tsp. hot tap water in with the instant coffe, cinnamon and vanilla extract.  Then I added the rest.  Talk about YUMMY.  Finger licking good.  I am keeping this cake in the fridge to keep that frosting cool and delicious.  Will make again for certain.

This is delicious!  I followed the directiions and took the advice of a couple of other reviewers who suggested dissolving the coffee and cinnamon in a teaspoon or two of hot water.  The frosting came out perfectly in both flavor and consistency with no further alterations to the original recipe.  I love both cinnamon and coffee, and this combination is out of this world!  Try it and then tell all your friends!

This is a wonderful departure from ordinary chocolate or vanilla frosting! We don't use instant coffee in our house, so I just used the first 1/3 cup from the coffee maker when brewing a strong pot and chilled it.  I also increased the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon, and decreased the sugar to 2 cups (it was still plenty sweet!)  I didn't have the luxury of following the recipe as written, because we do not use dairy products in treats we share with our dairy-allergic son.  But if I had used butter, I'm sure it would have been even richer and better.  As it was, I used 1/4 c. Earth Balance shortening, and 1/4 c. Earth Balance buttery spread.  I omitted the milk and just used the brewed coffee instead.  Very nice flavor!  It went well on chocolate cupcakes.

Coffee and cinnamon are two of our favorite flavors.  Used this frosting on the Cookie Sheet Raisin Cake also on this sight.  The frosting was excellent.  Want to try this next on a spice cake.

At home and at work - everyone loves this frosting.  I find I need to cut the sugar a little, and play around with the milk to get the right consistency.  If you follow the recipe to the T, you might wind up with a runny mess.

Like the other posts said--really sweet, even with only 2 cups sugar.  I omitted the coffee and add an extra 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and we really liked it.  We'll be making it again!

Couldn't even taste the cinnamon or coffee, so I ended up adding more in.

Very creamy w/ just the right amount of cinnamon and coffee.  Although I did tweak it a bit which could affect both creamy and flavor... I used 2 tsp of instant dark roast coffee and I used half and half.  I heated a 1/4 c half and half, and dissolved the coffee and cinnamon in that, then added it to the sugar butter.  I used about 2 3/4 c powdered sugar.  To get the flavor and consistency I wanted.

Good blend of flavors~~the only thing I changed was adding a little more icing sugar to thicken it a bit but otherwise a very nice recipe.

Great frosting recipe; I used it to frost the Black Magic Cake that I made for dessert today. (The cake recipe is also on this site.) I did use four cups of powdered sugar instead of three and it turned out perfect. Thank you for the recipe!

This is my favorite frosting recipe! Whenever I make it, people rave about it. It's great becuase it looks like I made something complicated, but it's so easy! My recommendation is to double the recipe if you're doing two 9" rounds. (My boyfriend always steals from the mixing bowl.) I like to have enough to really cover the top good. I use it with the chocoate cake recipe on the back of Hersheys' cocoa.

I LOVED THE RECIPE I MADE IT FOR MY FAMILY AND IT WAS VERY EASY. I MADE IT TO GO WITH THE BLACK MAGIC CAKE FOUND ON THIS WEBSITE. I DOUBLED UP THE RECIPE TO FILL THE CAKE AND FROST AND I FOUND THAT I ADDED TOO MUCH SUGAR AND IT CAME OUT TOO SWEET!! I LOVED IT BUT MY FAMILY SAID ITS TOO SWEET. IT TASTED JUST LIKE COFFEE IC CREAM. WILL USE AGAIN THANKS A BUNCH!!!

I agree that 1/3 cup milk is too much.  After making a single batch, I knew it wouldn't be enough to frost/fill my double layer cake, so I ended up doubling all ingredients (except milk and sugar).  I used just 2-3 Tbs. of milk and increased the sugar to 4 cups.  Definitely a keeper.....

I don't even like coffee but I love this frosting.  Be sure to crush the coffee into a very fine powder.  I use a mortar and pestal.  Works great on golden vanilla cake.

I hate to be the dissenting opinion, but I just did not have much success with this frosting.  My first batch was so runny that it went in the trash.  I used no more that 1 or 2 tablespoons of milk in my second batch, but the frosting still slid down my cake in big globs.  I had to refrigerate it and then try spreading it again.  My guests were very polite about the appearance of the cake, but we all agreed that the frosting was sweet enough to make one's teeth fall out.  The cinnamon coffee flavor was interesting with the Black Magic Cake, as other reviewers have noted, but I would not make this frosting again.

It is unique! Nice on chocolate devil's food cake. Did not "mash" instant coffee granules -- I simply poured milk in a glass measuring cup,  dissolved the instant coffee in the milk and then added the vanilla.  Thank you

WOW-this was really sweet! I am thinking maybe too sweet? I just kept thinking how much sugar that was when I doubled the recipe. I think I will use whipping cream instead of milk next time b/c I thought the consistency was very thin.

This is wonderful! I hate coffee but loved this.I made a few substitution since I did not have instant coffee.I used non dairy creamer in place of the milk and 1/3c brewed coffee for the liquid. It turned out great.I will try the original recipe next time to see if there is a difference.I used this on the black magic cake.Yummy!

This was okay. I used this frosting on the black magic cake, as recommended, and I was not very impressed. I brought this to a party and a lot of people asked about it, but I was not very impressed.
