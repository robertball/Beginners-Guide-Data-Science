I am the recipe submitter and I just wanted to clarify some things that seem to be a tad different from what I submitted.  I use the sweet red thai chili sauce in my version as well as fresh grated ginger (not dried ground).  Also, it's really an integral step, is to let everything sit refrigerated for a couple of hours before eating - this is really an important step that you won't regret.  I wanted to mention that one review indicated that tamari is actually just soy sauce and I want to clarify.  Although tamari is a type of soy, it is not the same as regular old soy sauce.  The tamari adds a much deeper, richer, more authentic flavor to the noodles.
The only other thing worth mentioning is that I toast my sesame seeds - I love them this way!  Happy eating!

Loved this recipe and would definately make it again... but had a little difficulty with the ingredient list.  After spending way too much time searching the isles of the local Asian market, (and then finally giving up and  going on-line) - I learned that tamari is soy sauce.  Also, the recipe reads 1/2 (8oz) package of spaghetti - I think it should read just 8oz of spaghetti.  But otherwise a really great recipe!!!

As written this is a four star recipe, but with some simple changes/additions this can be a five star recipe.  Instead of spaghetti I used soba (buckwheat) noodles from the Asian section of my grocery store.  I served this with baked tofu (you can buy packages of seasoned baked tofu at the health food store), sauteed shitake mushrooms, and steamed broccoli on top.  That made it a complete Japanese style vegetarian meal.  I also served a cucumber salad on the side made with seasoned rice wine vinegar.

I'm kind of tough to please, which is why I'm giving this recipe only four stars (I'd give it 4.5 if I could).  This was very easy to make, and I think I could probably eat it just about every day, which says a lot for me.  Next time I'd probably add a little more chili sauce to give it more zing.

I made the recipe as written first, and it had a good flavor, but it was missing something. The second time, I used soba noodles instead of spaghetti, added stir fry vegetables & thinly sliced chicken. It was phenomenal! This is a good base recipe, but I recommend adding meat and/or veggies to it.

Perfect the way it is!  For a low-carb alternative, substitute part or all of the pasta for fresh shredded carrots and cabbage.  Amazing!!!

I liked these a lot.  I used 16 oz. of whole wheat spaghetti, doubled the sauce, and added steamed carrots and broccoli.  I used a little bit of peanut oil and sesame chili oil, toasted the sesame seeds, and let it all sit in the fridge for two hours before I ate it. I have had tons of leftovers to take for lunches from this.

At first it was just alright but had it again the next day and thought--hey, this is pretty good!  I warmed it up in the microwave a bit which I thought made it taste better.  My 13 month old enjoyed eating this so I would definitely make it again.

I used fresh ground ginger like the poster suggested and spicy chili paste and a mixture of one tablespoon soy sauce and one of hoison. I also used whole wheat linguni noodles and omitted the sesame seeds. Oh and crunchy peanut butter. Really really good!

Very tasty, the only thing I'd do different is to stir-fry the cooked pasta before mixing in the sauce.

I like this recipe a lot. I made a couple changes though after making it twice. this recipe seems to work better with thinner noodles like angel hair instead of regular spaghetti or linguine. also half the peanut butter I used was extra chunky and this added a great texture. I also skipped the chili sauce since I dont like spicy stuff. Also I doubled the sauce and added more oil so it wasnt as dry.

I love this recipe!!  Super easy to make, leftovers taste great hot or cold, what's not to like?  I use soy sauce instead of tamari and the world's still spinning.  I cut in half the amount of chili sauce I used after painfully learning my lesson.

Yum! This was a littel on the sweet and thick side for me, but the flavor was fantastic. I cut the sweetness with a couple splashes of rice vinegar and served this on Napa cabbage. Very good, thanks!

I have never been more motivated to write a review. Though I will alter the recipe the next time around, it met my expectations. The combination of flavors was off the chart! The downside was the saltiness and sweetness --which kind of detracted from my full enjoyment. NEXT TIME: I will reduce the amount of honey, and increase the ginger (I used freshly minced). I will not salt the boiling water for the pasta. I will use Sriracha because I enjoy the heat. Lastly, I will double the sauce because it is sooo doggone good. Somebody is asking, how can I rate this recipe 5-stars, yet make plans to alter it. ANSWER: Albeit, this recipe is delicious I now need to personalize the experience. Isn't that what we do? Kelcambell, THANK YOU!

I love making this recipe, it's so quick and easy! I've tweaked it a bit after making it a few times and I use a few substitutions1. I use 8oz package of udon noodles which are softer and more Asian-style, I think they work better with the sauce. Follow cooking directions on package. 2. I like the spicy so I upped the Thai chili sauce to 1 tbsp. 3. I add some grilled or pan-cooked chicken breast that you can marinade or season to your liking and mix that, shredded/cut up, in with the noodles and sauce.

Simple, easy, and delicious!  I didn't rate it a 5 because  added a bunch of other spices and seasonings to it.  Great base recipe though.

Yeah, I know I should let it set for an hour...like THAT's going to happen!  This is a fave of mine from restaurants, and so easy to make at home.  I used buckwheat/spelt soba noodles and fresh ginger root, and shriracha chili sauce.  I like a touch of fresh chopped cilantro to garnish and flavour a bit.  Thanks for your trial and error--it's really great and will now be a regular in my kitchen, only doubling the recipe so some can set for a while!

I had to make this a few times before I got it right, but it was definitely worth it.  Listen to the reviewers who recommend letting the noodles sit after you've combined them with the sauce, the longer the better.  Also, my recommendation is that if you are mixing in vegetables (I used carrots, brocolli, and edamame) use a little bit more sauce.  If you love sesame oil, this is a great recipe.

Both my husband and I didn't care for this. There wasn't a whole lot of flavor and I think the peanut butter gave it a weird texture. Thanks anyway.

I thought this was quite good but must admit I did not follow the recipe as written. I used soy sauce, as I didn't have tamari sauce on hand, used whole wheat pasta, and, as I wasn't paying proper attention to the recipe, added the toasted sesame seeds to the mixture rather than garnishing before serving. I followed the additional suggestions by the author and used fresh ginger, and let  the dish stand for a couple of hours before serving (one hour of the time refrigerated). I think that if this were served with regular pasta, as listed, I would give it a "5" rating, and I do look forward to making again. It needs a touch of something to be served with the stronger flavoured whole wheat pasta, perhaps a bit of cilentro, if that is your preference. This said, my husband loved it .  Thank you very much kelcampbell. I look forward to trying other recipes in your collection.

This was great! I used stir fry noodles instead of spaghetti and decided to double the sauce(except the honey) based on other reviews..and also because i find once noodles sit in the fridge they soak up even more juice. I Added Thinly sliced zucchini, carrots and red peppers which i cooked in a wok on high for only 2 minutes, and then transferred the cooked noodles and sauce in there to combine. I ate this hot for supper the first day, and enjoyed it the next day cold. I will most likely be making this again..wouldn't change much except to cut back on the honey and amp up the Thai chili sauce. I didn't have the sesame seeds to garnish with..next time i will! would taste great with any nuts..even peanuts or cashews..and a fresh squeeze of lime. YUM..thanks for recipe Kelly!

I was using a different recipe for sesame noodles and I just couldn't get the taste I wanted. Then I found this one and it is perfect! I made some changes only because of my pallette. It was good just the way it was but here is what I changed. I used top ramen noodles, only 1 tablespoon of tamari (soy sauce) and no chili paste since I don't like spicy food.

I loved this!  I'm taking it to an Asian inspired potluck so I doubled the recipe.  I ended up doubling the sauce PLUS doing another half recipe of the sauce to get the noodles coated like I wanted it.  This may be because I used a thin whole wheat pasta (which was delicious in this!) and it soaked up more sauce.  I basically followed the recipe exactly using fresh ginger and toasted sesame seeds on the top.  I did use half honey and half agave because I ran out of honey and forgot the garlic.  My Thai sauce had a bit of a bite to it so it wasn't missed.  This was awesome!  The last thing I did was add a half a chopped orange bell pepper and almost two cups of sliced shitake mushrooms for a few veggies.

I'll start off by saying I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter, but this was still really good. I gave the recipe 4 stars as is but if you add a stir fry veggie mix its 5 stars! I even thought some shrimp would have been good with this too. DO NOT skip the sesame oil, it really defines the sauce! I used whole wheat linguini and my stir fry mix had carrots, snow peas, water chesnuts, mushrooms, edamame, and red peppers, delicious! Even my super picky boyfriend liked it!

This was yummy -- it deserves 4.5 stars.  Adapted it a bit, based on what I had on hand. Used a chili sesame oil and added a couple of shakes of Tabasco and added fresh cilantro. I felt that it was not enough "sauce," so I doubled the amount.

Thumbs up for ease, but it ended up kind of dry, and not so sesame-like.

This is a wonderful recipe, but I used fettuccine style rice noodles, just as in Thai style.

I made this exactly as stated in the recipe.  We thought the flavor was good, but lacked something.  It was much easier than my normal recipe, so I will try it again, increasing the sauce (we thought it was a bit dry),  using more chili oil and increasing the sesame oil.

It was a bit dry for my taste, but I added some homemade teriyaki sauce (maybe 1 - 2 Tbsp) and it was perfect! Delicious and quick, which makes it perfect to make one morning and have for lunches throughout the week with grilled chicken, steak, or shrimp.

The noodles taste great, but the sauce does not provide much liquid. The dish is very dense.

I strongly feel that you should call these peanut noodles unless you use sesame tahini.
Garnish with cucumber sticks adds flavor contrast.

Tamari is not just a soy sauce but is always gluten free making it safe for those with Celiac’s or gluten intolerance.  Other commercial soy sauces can and do contain gluten except for La Choy’s low sodium soy sauce which is gluten free.  Having 2 daughters with Celiac’s, I quickly learned the difference.  And as the recipe submitter stated, there is a difference in the flavor and color of tamari and regular soy sauce.  If you have to avoid gluten, check the ingredient label on the back if the bottle.

This was really awesome I felt like I was at an oriental restaurant. Until now that is how I got my fix for noodles like this. I didn't have Thai Chili Sauce so I used Sambal Oelek which is a very hot & spicy sauce. But 1 tsp wasn't to hot. I think I'm going to cut the Peanut Butter in half it was to strong.  Also I followed the advice of other reviews. After I drained the pasta I did stir fry it in some sesame oil before adding the sauce. Great recipe that I will use a lot.

yum!! I like this recipe much better than the previous version I tried.
I added julienned carrots and snap peas. I also doubled the sesame oil, garlic,and used fresh ginger. I also added 2 teaspoons of mirin because I had it and wanted it sweeter. So, cool and perfect for a summer meal.

Love this recipe "as is".  However, I cook for someone with limited taste due to an accident so I use far more flavorings and spices than the average cook.  That said, I love this "foundation" recipe so much I double the sauce every time.  I then add a ton more garlic, ginger, use almond butter instead of peanut (health reasons), use Coconut Aminos instead of Tamari (health reasons), I add a ton of veggies such as summer squash, peppers, onions, mushrooms, roasted broccoli, basically whatever is going bad in the fridge.  I also have found it helpful to mix the "sauce" and keep adding spices to it until it is just right, then add it to the noodles and veggies last.  Any type of roasted vegetable that you have on hand and need to get rid of, is fantastic in this sauce.  (YES - roasting your veggies adds a whole new dimension of flavor, especially broccoli).  I serve this with fresh basil, cilantro, scallions, crushed nuts on top, and fresh sprouts for crunch.  A great foundation recipe to help you get rid of leftover veggies!

Just double this recipe while your at it.  It is so yummy you won't be able to keep your paws off it.  My 7 year old loves it!  I make it with fresh ginger and don't have a micro, so just heat all the ingredients (except the pasta, onions and toasted sesame seeds)on super low heat until it becomes a sauce and just starts to boil.

Made this once as is...it was fantastic. The next time I used whole wheat noodles. I also used fresh ginger, toasted white and black seeds and tossed them in and then added snow peas, broccoli, red and yellow pepper (chopped fine), ground bhut jolokia powder (I like things super hot) and chopped broccoli. Let it site for 24 hours and then ate it. It was great. I think it needs a little lime juice or balsamic vinegar but even without it....this recipe is great!

If you like Thai noodles you will love this!  I use LoMein noodles instead of spaghetti, and add in mushrooms and sauteed chicken tenders to make a complete meal.

Perfect as-is.  Awesome side-dish for the 'Baked Teriyaki Chicken' found on this site.  Doubling the recipe gives you the perfect amount of sauce for 1 full pkg of shanghai noodles.

Excellent recipe, very flavorful made exactly as written. One question for author: Is this meant to eat cold or warm? I notice your review says to refrigerate a couple of hours while the original recipe as written by AR does not include that step. After refrigerating, do you reheat? TIA

I loved the smell and the flavor of these noodles. They went really well with my teriyaki chicken. I didn't put seeds since I didn't have any and I used 1/4 tsp of chili paste instead of the chili sauce (to avoid white sugar). I refregerated the noodles overnight. I wasn't too excited about the texture of the noodles, even though I made sure to cook them al dente. My son and I who can sense spices really well thought that the noodles were a tad too spicy while my husband couldn't detect the spiciness at all. I will be making these again. Thank you.

I thought this was just alright and actually preferred it warm instead of cold.  After sitting for too long the noodles really soaked up the sauce.  It had great flavor and would love to try it again.

This was absolutely delicious! I used light soy sauce in place of the tamari, and fresh ginger, and I had to add a little water to the noodles because my sauce was not mixing into the pasta well - maybe because I was using natural peanut butter.  I had a little extra chopped pepper from another recipe so I garnished with that and it added a nice touch of color.  Will make this again and again! Thank you!

Delicious! Even tastes good cold the next day as the sesame noodles I had from a Chinese restaurant were served cold. If you want to amp up the heat, add a little Srirachi Chili sauce from Vietnam, available in most Asian food sections at the supermarket.

This is soo yummy, hot or cold... I made a few changes. I used soba noodles for a more traditional flavour. I also found it much easier to mix when the noodles were warm. Very good! Great for lunches.

Delicious alternative to spaghetti with marinara sauce. I would recommend using Asian noodles (soba, lo mein, rice noodles, etc.) for a more authentic texture, but this had just the right kick to it. I used chili oil ('la yu') instead of the Thai chili paste. Next time, I'll be adding more sesame oil.

I don't really like peanut butter, so this probably wasn't the recipe for me. My toddler loved it, however

I made only half the recipe as directed and it was very tasty. Next time I think I will add vegetables as other have suggested. Easy healthy meal.

So easy and delicious.  I used Garlic Chile Sauce because it's what I had and it made it just the right spicy (I like spicy so if you don't, might want to tone down).  I added some chopped up left-over Honey Garlic Pork Chops to it and it was sooooo good.  Updated:  Go ahead and eat the whole thing instead of trying to leave leftovers because it isn't quite the same reheated the next day -- it's texture isn't as smooth.

This was such a good dish, I ended up making two entire packages of spaghetti and 4x the accompanying sauce! My husband, teenage sons, and I LOVED it. It was a nice refreshing summer meal that I served with cilantro, green onions, chopped peanuts, toasted sesame seeds, and cucumbers.

I followed the recipe, including the modifications  noted by the recipe submitter--using fresh ginger, thai chili sauce, and toasted sesame seeds. We like garlic in my house, so I used about three times as much, using a garlic press instead of chopping. After making it, I put it in the fridge for a couple hours. This is a great dish that I will be making again and again!

Love this recipe ... I followed the follow-up tips in the review section - and have also added julienned veggies (peppers and carrots).  I make a huge bowl of this regularly to keep my daughter from saying there's nothing to eat!  ;)  Thank you!

Was not impressed by this recipe until I had the leftovers. Someone else mentioned in their review that this needs to sit a couple hours in the fridge (heats up nicely). I couldn’t agree more!

Had to halve the peanut butter, used fresh ginger, and doubled the spicy sauce, used low sodium soy sauce instead of tahini.  Had to remake it like this to be edible and more tasty.  All that peanut butter was overwhelming.

This is a good base recipe but I like more sauce and my family loves sweet Thai chili sauce so I amp that up and we also leave it on the table like ketchup so we can add whatever amount we like! You won’t be disappointed!!!

I loved the sauce for this recipe. I  substituted skinny noodles (shirataki noodles) for a low carb meal. Marinated the noodles overnight and it was delicious. I did reduce the peanut butter to 2 teaspoons instead of tablespoons because we are trying to lose weight. Husband and I both loved the flavor. I think it’s very important to let whatever noodles you use marinate overnight. Thank you for the recipe, definitely a keeper!

I made this and it is worth trying however I made as directed with a few mods, I used 3 green onions and 1 green bell pepper chopped along with 5 slices of cooked bacon diced, added a little more tamari and sesame oil and I used egg noodles instead of spaghetti, definitely worth trying and the peanut butter well I was skeptical to say the least but mixed with garlic and tamari adds a wonderful flavor to the pasta

It was really good. I used soy sauce instead of tamari. I didn’t use sesame seeds either because my family doesn’t like them. I used have of what the recipe called for chili sauce because my family doesn’t like spice. But overall it still had a great taste.

I doubled the recipe, and it was wonderful. I didn't have ground ginger, substituted diced fresh ginger for it. Next time I think I will not use double the noodles, maybe just 1.5 times, so there will be more sauce.

I’m sorry - - I really wanted to like this.  Unlike some reviewers, I made it exactly as written.  Left it in the fridge all day, reheated it.  It was just really dry and gummy.  My almost grown kids love Asian food, and we were hopeful we could make these noodles at home but it was “thumbs down” from both of them.

kelcampbell - Well Done!!!  This is a really simple dish to put together and very few ingredients that make up a very flavorful dish.  The sauce is exactly the right amount for the  8 ounces of pasta.  Great flavors.  I ended up adding a  ladle of pasta water to "loosen the dish up a bit".   For me, I prepared the sauce in a large frying pan and after I drained the pasta, I added the cooked pasta into the pan and finished the dish there.  That's where I saw and decided to add the pasta water mentioned to get the consistency I like.  Thank You for sharing this dish!  Well Done!

Didn’t have some ingredients but made do with what I had. Didn’t have ginger or chili sauce but I don’t use that anyway. The minced garlic has a kick to it but will get fresh ginger for next time. Added a dash of vinegar. It was delicious. Will definitely make again. Oh yes.did add chopped cucumber, minus seeds as an old recipe I have did use cucumber. Ate the whole bowl!

Yum!  I had all the ingredients on hand except spaghetti so i subbed no yolk flat noodles.   I added my own embellishments-but only a couple minor ones:   shrimp and cilantro. Restaurant quality!

I used rice noodles in a thin fettucine shape and Chili Paste with garlic. Made for a very nice meal and you can kick it up a notch or two by simply adding more of the chili paste. The really brave can add Thai peppers.

It was a bit bland so I added more thai chili sauce and tamari, maybe about a tablespoon of each. I also sauteed medium sized shrimp in the sauce. Turned out perfect. Everyone said it tasted authentic.  -Nia Spencer

I loved it and the taste was sublime (even though I put in tahini instead of Tamari, which I didn’t seem to have; added soy sauce at the end and mixed it in).

I  quadrupled the sauce cause I used a whole box of spaghetti with it for a lunch...added in a teaspoon of sugar, rice wine vinegar and 4-5 tablespoons water cause too thick for me...did not want to use microwave on the peanut butter...I added in 2 shredded carrots, red onions, cucumbers, and more scallions for lunch and it was delicious.

If you have to make this for someone who has a tree nut allergy simply leave out the sesame and peanut , as this is a basic aioli pasta with some vegetables of choice. Great easy recipe to make with noodles of choice. Any good chili sauce can be substituted. If you have hatch chiles toss them in to up the heat.

I make cold sesame noodles all the time, in varying ways. I suggest using tahini in addition to peanut butter (slightly less tahini than PB), toasted sesame oil rather than regular, and unseasoned rice vinegar. Successful add-ins: julienned Kirby cucumbers (with the skin on), or julienned snowpeas (used raw when young, thin & tender, or de-stringed & lightly blanched or nuked when older & thicker), or baby arugula leaves (non-traditional, but delicious), or even crisp shredded iceberg; cubes of extra firm tofu; shredded chicken breast; grated fresh ginger. Garnishes: sesame seeds, chopped scallions, sriracha, chili oil or chili flakes. Never leave out the chopped scallions (green parts mostly), as they're essential. I'd omit the honey, but if you want a sweet counterpoint to spicy ingredients, one Chinese restaurant I know successfully adds, as a garnish when serving, the very faintest sprinkle of coarse, crunchy sugar!

I added shredded chicken, and next time I’ll add something to add more liquid to the sauce, as most of it is absorbed by the noodles.

This is really tasty and simple to make. I substituted soy sauce for the tamari as I didn't have tamari. I followed the recipe as written for the rest of the ingredients in the sauce but also added a bit of sriracha as we like some heat.  I slivered some carrots and threw those in with the pasta to cook. Also, I threw in a half cup or so of edemame  while I was heating up the peanut butter and garlic, and cooked some brocolli to add in at the very end. I've made this a few times and my whole family loves it, even my fussy youngest who avoids veggies.

I've made these noodles several times and have tweaked the recipe to suit my family's tastes, not really a lot of change. I also have doubled the recipe and that works. These noodles are yummy! I make them early in the day to let them marinade. This recipe has become one of my go to.

I really loved this.   It was easy and fast, which is perfect for me.  Working 14 hours away from home normally keeps me too tired to make anything, but I have a new favorite lunch.   All the flavors work great with each other.   Very tasty, but you either have to love peanut butter or Thai food.   I think any negatory reviews are coming from those that didn’t anticipate peanut butter mixed with sweet spices as the main flavors.

Delicious! I used rice noodles and added a little lemon juice to brighten it up. Next time I might add a little less chili paste because with the kind I used it was a touch overpowering. Quite good though as is!

This was pretty good, but needed a few tweaks. I doubled the sauce and added broccoli slaw and chicken. I also used pad Thai noodles instead.

This was pretty good. I used rice noodles to keep it gluten free. The sauce came out a bit thick so I thinned it out by adding some pasta water. I used Sriracha and doubled the amount. If you like peanut sauces, this is one for the keeper file. Thank you for the recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe that I made using the author’s suggested changes.  I use Blue Dragon egg noodles (whole foods) instead of Thai noodles for this one.  It just works!

Made exactly as directed and refrigerated for about an hour. The sauce was too pasty for my liking, but the flavor was great. My kids suggested it be “wetter”next time, so I’ll try bumping up the sauce by 1.5x and maybe add a little extra oil. A good meat-free, tasty and quick dinner for us.

Made this today for dinner. The only changes we made were adding a bit of sriracha to the sauce mixture, an extra teaspoon of sesame oil, and we fried it in a wok. The sauce we would actually consider for our usual stir fry sauce.

Nice spice without  being too hot :) I made this sauce and served it over zucchini "noodles" and it was delicious. I sauted the zucchini a bit in olive oil and the garlic and then tossed it with the peanut sauce.

I agree with a previous reviews that this is a great base recipe. I did not have tamari on hand so had to use soy sauce instead and it still turned out fine. I switched out spaghetti for soba noodles and added sauteed snow peas and green peppers to mine and baked tofu cubes. I also switched out the honey for agave and red thai chili sauce for garlic chili sauce (the sambal olek brand).

This was very good! Per other reviews, we tripled the sauce,with the exception of the chili sauce. I thinned it with a bit of water and it was just the right amount for a 12 oz package of soba noodles, which I highly recommend over white pasta. Also added steamed broccoli to make it more substantial for dinner.

I used rice noodles and don't know if they interact with the sauce differently, but it was definitely not enough sauce - the noodles turned out dry and pasty.  I'd try it again, next time doubling the sauce.

Giving this 3 stars because I really had to doctor it up and it was very salty. Added some molasses, lime juice, more sesame oil and used fresh ginger. Ultimately it was tasty.

This was SUPER easy, and absolutely delish! I made one very minor adjustment. I added only 2/3's of the honey as I don't like things that are "too" sweet. Next time, I'll double the green onions.  Definitely a keeper!

i LOVED this recipe!  i only made a couple of small changes. i used Barilla Multigrain Spaghettini, it's all i had. i used fresh grated ginger...wanted to use it up. didn't have tamari, so i used low sodium soy sauce, and added some leftover chicken that i had in the fridge. This is a really really easy and quick recipe to put together. i made the peanut sauce earlier in the afternoon. i reheated it for about 20 secs in the microwave just before mixing in with the pasta!  will definitely be making this again! FABULOUS dish Kelly Campbell. thanks for sharing with us :)

Loved this recipe! I also used soba noodles; just makes sense for me. Fresh garlic and fresh ginger. I added a teas of peanut oil because I like the flavor. It sat for about two hours and I had it with some baked crusted tofu. Love the noodles and will make again! Might make more sauce next time - it got a little sticky. But soooooo good!

Excellent taste - followed the recipe exactly.  There seemed to be plenty of the sauce but the pasta soaks it all up rendering the dish a bit dry. I added maybe 1/4c water but would add much more next time

Very good.. other recipes called for too much peanut butter. At 2 tbsps, this was perfect.Just used regular spaghetti and Franks RedHot sauce, as I had it on hand. Better than having to go for Chinese takeout! Thank you!

Scaled it to 10 servings, made as written....a delicious, spicy sauce! Used Japanese buckwheat noodles..My only advice is boil the noodles literally before you're going to serve them. Mix with sauce immediately and enjoy! If you mix and then let them sit in the pot, it will become one big blob. Still delicious but the noodles will break when you go to serve...

Super Yummy! I doubled the sauce and added celery and zuchinni and a small amount of green pepper to the suggested veggies also used soy sauce instead of the tamari. So good! It is included in family favorites as of tonight! Thank you!

This recipe is soooo good.  I like to add sriacha sauce in addition to the other sauce.  Also, try toasting the sesame seeds for another layer of flavor.  I make this on Sundays and we have leftovers and lunches for the week!

Oh wow, this is wonderful! This is the first time I've had sesame noodles, but it won't be the last.  I did use 2 tablespoons of soy sauce rather than tamari and the results were still delicious!

This was so easy and tasty. Great weeknight treat. I might reduce the honey next time as it was a tad too sweet for me.

Very easy and yummy.  I added chicken and served it warm.  I did find it a little salty so I will use less soya sauce next time and more chili sauce!

Wonderful recipe that tweaks well.  I made a few changes just because of what I had on hand, white sugar instead of honey and bean paste instead of chili sauce.  I also used soba noodles and added a splash of rice wine vinegar for personal taste.

This recipe is great as is, and easily adjusted if you like it sweater, not as sweet, drier, or whatever :)

This recipe is exactly what I was looking for!!!  The perfect mix of all those good Asian flavors.  The only thing I would do differently is to toast the sesame seeds first.  Oh.....and I added 1/4 t. of togarashi.  yum..

This is fantastic! Very easy and quick to make.  I used half soy sauce and half Bragg's licquid soy.  Can't wait to make again.

My boys ask for this over and over.  I use organic freshly ground peanut butter and do not microwave or heat it.  I do mix the sauce together at least 2 hours ahead of time and toast the sesame seeds.  Sometimes I will top it with a bit of sliced grilled steak.    This dish is also great cold the next day.  My boys love spice, but I have learned to tone down the chili sauce a bit if they are having friends join us for dinner.

Tasty recipe. Very similar to a Rachel Ray recipe which adds thinly sliced fresh spinach and sliced rotisserie chicken. Makes it even better!

This was very good and I will definitely do it again. Used everything on the list, except for the thai chili sauce (I live in France and wouldn't know what to look for) and the green onions(couldn't find any). I did as the poster suggested and used fresh ginger and let this sit for two hours. Well worth the wait and look forward to this again.

Delicious!!! Both kids liked it - a rarity! I used linguini, to approximate lo mein noodles. I used crunchy PB, yum! I didn't use the chili paste (didn't have it) so I added some pepper. I felt the sodium content as written was egregious, so I used "lite" soy. I added chicken chunks to make it a meal and served it hot. Reminded me of the chicken Pad Thai from a local restaurant. A huge hit!
