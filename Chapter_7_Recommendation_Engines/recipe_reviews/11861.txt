Both my husband and 4 year old daughter LOVE this recipe (my 4 yr old doesn't eat much).  I made a few changes (as per other suggestions).  Increased oil to 3-4 tbsp, omitted thyme used 4 cups chopped tomatoes and 1/2 - 1 tsp salt.  I sprinkle the salt on the tomatoes to help bring out the juices.  As this recipe can  be a little dry, I also add approx. 2/3 cup chicken broth.  I sprinkle parmesan cheese and toss and serve - EXCELLENT!  We eat this often.

I added a little extra garlic - my husband walked into the house and swooned. It was delightful and fresh with the fresh tomatoes.

This was good with my modifications; I mixed the olive oil with butter as others suggested; I used about a lb of pasta and still HALVED the spices in this... I mixed my canned diced tomatoes into the butter and olive oil and let simmer a few minutes to heat; added some shredded Parmesan cheese and served it on whole wheat spaghetti with a little Italian parsley on top... :)

Pretty good, nice and subtly flavored.  Needs a little salt though, and also a little extra olive oil.  Also didn't use recommended amount of seasonings  since I made much less than 1 lb. of linguine.  I'll probably throw in a little grated Parmesan cheese and  eat it with a side of organic spinach and breaded organic chicken cutlet.

I thought this was okay, but it seemed kind of dry. I used more garlic (about 4 big cloves), added some sliced mushrooms which I sauteed with the garlic and added feta cheese at the end with the tomatoes. I'd make this again, it was quick and easy.

Very good.  Made the following tweaks: 4 tablespoons of olive oil, 3 tablespoons minced garlic, 1 teaspoon of dried basil, 1 teaspoon of red peppre flakes, 2 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes.  All other ingrediants the same.

This was very plain and very dry.  It needs a good bit more olive oil or some butter.  I don't think I'll make this one again.

Followed the recipe as written and the herbs were WAY too much for the pasta.  They were overpowering.

This was easy and delicious! I did add a bit of salt and cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit. I served this with fresh bread and a dipping sauce. But it was awesome!

This was the worst recipe I have tried from this site. Even with extra garlic, it ended up tasting like "plain pasta with dirt on it," according to my boyfriend.

This isnt bad. I made it two different ways. One way as written with the exception of subing fresh herbs for the dried. My daughter seemed to like it but said it needed more garlic. The second way was also subing the herbs out with fresh but also adding fresh clams , scallops and crab that we had just gotten out of the bay plus some extra garlic and it was great. I will be making this again probably both ways. I forgot to mention I added salt and pepper to taste. Thanks!

Quick and simple pasta recipe. Flavorful and aromatic. Sprinkled some freshly grated parmessan cheese right before serving. Served it with chicken marsala. My family loved it. Even my son who doesn't like tomatoes. A definite five star winner!

I like quick and easy recipes that tastes good, a plus when you have all the ingredients. I thought this needed just a tad of salt, I added 1 tsp.

This was actually quite good.  I did use an un-drained can of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies in place of the chopped tomatoes.  Our house likes food with a little kick.  Next time, I will reduce the seasonings a bit, but not much.  Topped with parmesan cheese.

Yummy! Lighter tasting than pasta with a marinara sauce. I'll definitely make again, probably with a little more garlic and possibly a little more tomato. I used one can petite diced. I also added just a touch of sugar to offset the acidity of the tomatoes.

This recipe is bad in itself, those modifications in the reviews are really helpful, I added tomato paste and it made the recipe less bitter. Would not use this recipe again.

I used fresh herbs and fresh tomatoes and didn't have a problem with it being dry. If anything, I had to let it simmer a bit to reduce the moisture.  A good way of using what the garden is giving me right now.

Very good. I did omitted the oregano.  With this recipe I scored rave reviews with my Italian *not Italian American* boyfriend. Reminded him of a dish at his favorite restaurant in Firenze. Thanks for making me look good :)  The sauce/ pasta ratio was perfect... pasta isn't supposed to swim in sauce.

My girlfriend and I made this with tweaking the recipe with the help of other reviews. It was a very good dish. When making it, by all means use 4 TBSP of oil and the chicken stock. Also fold in some fresh shaved Parm and use a little less spice. Its great!

Fabulous! After modifications I give it 5 stars. But I have to rate it high because I really do think this recipe started it. I added a little more olive oil, pressed garlic and a few tbsps of butter. Sprinkled garlic powder and parmesan cheese on top and mixed in.

Very good. I used butter instead of olive oil, and I added some lemon pepper to the spice mixture. I also didn't use the tomatoes. I served chicken breasts and Lemon Velvet Butter sauce, from tis site, over these tasty noodles, and it went really well.

Overkill on the Basil!  Next time (if there is a next time) I'll only add 1tsp of Basil.  Other than that it was pretty easy to make.  Oh, and I'd add some extra olive oil.  It came out a bit dry.

I loved this recipe, the only way I eat my linguine now!  Served this with Chicken Marsala and Olive Oil Bread, two other recipes I found here at All Recipes and it was like eating out at an Italian Restaurant.  Very Good!

I used whole wheat pasta, fresh herbs and tomatoes. Hubby thought it was going to be "too healthy", but even he was impressed.

Kind of plain. Might be better with fresh herbs instead of dried ones.

Great tasting fast side dish. I omitted the tomatoes and thyme as we are not fans.

I used canned tomatoes, diced.  I used dried minced garlic from the herb jar, it wasn't clear if it was supposed to be fresh garlic or dried minced garlic. My family liked it.

Very dry.  Perhaps the recipe should use canned tomatoes with the liquid.  I used fresh tomatoes and the result was so dry that I needed to add marinara sauce to make it edible.

Needs a little more garlic. Also, it's better with fresh herbs and some parmesian cheese

I liked the simplicity of this recipe but I really didn't enjoy it as many others have said they did.  I don't think I will make this again unless I am starving and need a poor but quick meal.

this was just okay. i think the herbs were a little to much. i'll have to play around with it a little more, but it definitely has potential. thanks for the recipe.

Awesome pasta dish.  I made it with baked pesto chicken and steamed broccoli. An excellent combination. My husband and I couldn't get enough of it. I did add a little extra salt after cooking for a bit more flavor.  A definate family favorite

I used whole wheat pasta to add a little extra fiber.  I also threw in some leftover chicken.  It turned out a little dry so I had to add a little extra oil.  Easy to prepare and overall good taste.

very good recipe, I sometimes turn this into a main dish by adding chicken. This works good to with yellow squash or zuchini for more veggies.
