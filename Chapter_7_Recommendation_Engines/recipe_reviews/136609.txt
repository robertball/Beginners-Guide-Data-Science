Yep, add half bbq sauice and half ketchup to really make it pop! Try a splash of dill pickle juice or red wine vinegar and it really brings the flavors to life. Excellent recipe!

Pretty good and a nice change from regular kethup for dipping fries - I added a little minced garlic.

Fantastic! I was missing Utah/Idaho during lunchtime so I made myself some oven fries (with dried rosemary, olive oil, and coarse sea salt) and whipped this fry sauce together. My 4-year-old and I LOVE it! Great flavors. Oh, and I took the suggestion to do half BBQ and half ketchup and it turned out just plain awesome. In lieu of Some Dude's, this will more than do. :) Thanks!

I multiplied this by four, added a tsp. of garlic powder and 4 baby dills that I chopped itty-bitty with my hand chopper. It's good now, but I think this will be even better tomorrow.

This is pretty good, it doesn't have a lot of taste but it's a good addition to my home made potato wedges.  I mixed in some extra cayenne for more kick.

I really liked this sauce.  I actually fried squash and zucchini and dipped them in this sauce.  Yummy!  I added ranch dressing, which I think was a mistake.  I also added some Texas Pete sauce, and that really made it good!  This is a flexible recipe.  Add your own favorite dipping sauces together.  You might be surprised!

Excellent base sauce.  I add some horseradish and minced manzanilla olives to the mix.  Outstanding!  I use it on burgers as well as fries and onion rings.

Have any of you tried adding a little horseradish to this recipe? It'll give the zip you're looking for.

This sauce is great for dipping red meat and grilled vegetables! The only thing I changed was I added a lot more cayenne pepper to make it extra spicy! Next time I'll add real chipotle peppers to make the sauce stand out more.

As written a 4 stare recipe, but if you add the BBQ it really makes this recipe a 5 star. I love fry sauce and the addition of BBQ really helps lend flavor and spice.

We loved this. I took another reviewer's tip and used half ketchup and half barbecue sauce. I also liked the sauce on my burger.

For anyone that might have a problem with flavor. Make it ahead of time, put it in the fridge and let it sit covered for an hour or so. I did this with a recipe of my own that used close to the same ingredients and it helps let the taste of the peppers soak in.

This takes me back to my childhood. I had a friend who use to dip her fries in a mayo/ketchup mixture. I always thought it was gross and never tried it. Then i came upon "fry sauce". i never knew there was an actual name for it. I tried it and thought it was really good!

Made for our french fried potatoes from this site.  I added a couple squirts of horseradish and used light miracle whip.  Next time, (and there will be many) I'll add more ground red pepper too.

I had to add a little more mayo in order to get the taste of the Fry Sauce I remember.  But I LOVE it with the added spices!

I did not care for this recipe. It tasted like tomato sauce with mayo! And as for the 'spicyness', there isn't any!

I made this sauce and on the first go around I did not care for it. Then I had an idea, instead of mayo I used ranch dressing, diced up a couple of slices of jalapeno, mixed  it up and put it in the frig over night. Tried it the next morning, GREAT (like tony the tiger says).

There are so many variations on the basic fry sauce recipe! That's what makes it so fun. Thanks for sharing yours. My own uses chilli sauce, instead of ketchup, ranch dressing instead of mayo, a bit of garlic powder and dash of liquid smoke.

Followed reviewers suggestions and added barbeque sauce. Also added a little chopped onion. Ate with fries and chicken nuggets, the flavor came out even more with the nuggets. Will be making this a lot!! Thanks!

Great sauce. We did add more cayenne at the table as we thought it was in need of it. I think in the end I doubled the cayenne for our tastes, and it still wasn't what we call spicy. This worked well with our burgers and fries and I'd fix this again. Thanks Cindy, this is good stuff here.

In So. Calif. during the 70's all my friends and I lived at Bob's Big Boy. They had a fry sauce called T & S (tomato and spice) that NO ONE but me remembers it. I think I must be crazy. This isn't it but it gave me good memories.  Thanks!

Though I didn't find this 'hot' spicy, the seasonings did give it great flavor. I'm a fry sauce 'newb' - ketchup is about as spicy as we get with our fries around here. The kids really liked this one, too. We'll make it again, for sure. Thanks!

Thank you for this recipe! My husband loves fry sauce, but we figured it must be a regional thing because none of the restaurants we go to  (in AZ)ever have it. He is so happy that we finally can make it ourselves!

Seasoned very well, yes. But not spicy. Try adding 1/4 tsp. of rice wine vinegar for more zip. I will most likely make again. Just fyi, the small dipping bowl in the picture holds the full amount of sauce.

This is just so easy and fast to make, and has a great taste! I don't use onion powder because it's usually so high in sodium, so I used garlic powder instead, plus low-fat mayonnaise and no-salt ketchup.  My version is healthier (low-fat, low-sodium) than the original recipe but probably just as good!

I've been making a much simpler version of this for years. I use about 1/2 & 1/2 mayo and ketchup. Then I add Dijon mustard, by taste, 'til I get the extra 'zip' I want. Sometimes I'll add a little chili powder. This way it doesn't need cayenne, salt or pepper. But... I may try adding onion powder next time.

Cayenne is a harh way of putting Heat / Tang into a recipe !! I have gotten to the point i never  hardly use it any longer.. Try ur fav. Hot sauce , or Chiki Pastes or my fav. Is Sriracha chili sauce ..  Try that in this recipe  and use a little sour cream too

Very good! I think I might try replacing the cayenne with chipotle, as I love the fry sauce from the Mad Pita, here in Southern Utah.

This tasted like ketchup and mayo. We ended up doubling the onion powder and quadrupled the cayenne. There was nothing spicy about this until we did so. After my modifications it did taste pretty good but, as written, not so good.

I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted nice, but I couldn't help but add some garlic to it. I still wasn't completely satisfied, so after reading some reviews I added a little barbeque sauce. Awesome!!! Sooo good on our burgers and with our fries! My two-year old even liked dipping her nuggets into it!

This recipe was AMAZING! It was so quick and easy and it really gave my fries and extra kick.  I added a little crushed red pepper because i like it a little more spicy. Also, i didn't put in the full 1/4 cup of mayo because you couldn't taste the ketchup.

I made the version with 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 bbq sauce, and added some dried chilies for a bit of kick.  Great with sweet potato fries!

This sauce worked well as a dip for our fries and for our sandwich.  It was served with 'Waffle Sandwich with Cheese, Spinach and Spicy Mustard' and 'Yummy Cheese Fries' both from AR and a tossed salad. I did up the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. and next time I would increase it just a little more.  We tend to like spicy.  Thanks Cindy, for sharing your version of Fry Sauce.  I had never heard of Fry Sauce until AR.  We enjoyed it.

Great recipe.  It reminded me of the fry sauce I used to get in Utah.  The recipe was great exactly as written.  I made a few adjustments for my own taste, and added just a little vinegar (about a half teaspoon) and a little Sriracha sauce.  The Sriracha really increased the spiciness, but I like it that way.  I used "light" mayonnaise so that I wouldn't feel so guilty about eating it, and there was really no difference in the taste from using regular mayonnaise.

I agree that this sauce isn't spicy (as in hot.) But I really enjoyed the extra spices in the fry sauce mixture. I used garlic powder instead of onion powder cause it's what I had on hand. It was so delicious with chicken nuggets and fries. I'll be making my fry sauce like this from now on. Thanks for sharing!

Yummy! I used ginger garlic pimento spice instead of onion powder for extra kick and did half ketchup half bbq sauce. I'm serving this with beer-battered onion rings tonight at a New Year's Eve party.

Very good! We mixed this up to have with some fries and it was perfect, would not change a thing. I will be using this recipe when we boil crawfish and with fried seafood. Thanks for the recipe.
