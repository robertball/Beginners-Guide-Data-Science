I made this recipe because I had a big jar of tahini, I love sesame and I wanted to make somehting other than hummus. This recipe is, in a word, Weird. If you make the recipe as described, the sauce is about the consistency of milk. I recommend leaving out the 3/4 cup of water. I had to heat the sauce and add cornstarch to make it look like a sauce and not soup.
Flavor's OK, and it's not hard to prepare. It's a little bland. Add aged Parmesan, double the mushroom and red pepper amounts, and it's OK. I've invented better pasta dishes from what's on hand, though.

i was a little skeptical when i mixed the sauce, as it was really thin. so i cooked the vegetables in the sauce, which reduced and thickened it, and the end result was suprisingly good.

I had to add a lot of salt and pepper just to bring some kind of flavor out from this bland sauce. Without it, it tasted...well...tangy. The vegetables do add some sweetness to it. I'd suggest to add even more veggies. I would say I'll add more next time, but unfortunately, I don't think I'll be making this one again :-(

I tried this recipe yesterday.  It was delicious!  I used green rather than red peppers and added them sooner as my old teeth needed a little softer bite.  Even my finicky husband loved this recipe.

I liked this quite a bit; if you salt and pepper to taste, it bring out some nice, subtler flavors. I do think that the vegetable saute is a must, and I agree with others' comments that the sauce is pretty thin. I think I'll be leaving out the water next time.

This is an excellent vegetarian recipe that non-veggies will like too!  The sauce is subtle with a unique, creamy flavor that is enhanced by the delicious portabellas we served over it.  Excellent --  one I will be using to impress guests with an unexpected treat.

This was an interesting dish,  I really liked the sauted veggies,, I personally prefer red peppers more cooked so I;ll cook the leftovers a bit more. The sauce as everyone has said is very very thin.. Cut out of cut back on water. It is a very tangy sauce,  Not sure if this was the lemon of the yogurt, I was hoping for more of the tahini taste
