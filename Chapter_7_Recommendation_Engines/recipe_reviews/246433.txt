Made as written and I wouldn't consider this a tzatziki but more of a cucumber chimichurri but a good one at that. This would pair well with many different things and one I will make again.

I agree - not a tzatziki but quite tasty. I didn't have enough cucumbers so I added some shredded zucchini. I love the crunch it adds.
