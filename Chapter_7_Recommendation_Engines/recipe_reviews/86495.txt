I agree ... 1 hour is going to be really tough ribs !!  An hour and a half at 325 is the bare minimum.  I prefer 2 hours baking time, then to the grill for a slight char, and sauce.  Their rub is fine, just cook them longer in the oven.

Sorry McCormickÂ® & Company but one hour cook time is going to yield some mighty tough ribs.
