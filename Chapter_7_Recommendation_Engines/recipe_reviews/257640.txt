One word comes to mind when I think back on last nights dinner and this recipe. WOW! My store did not have arugula on its own so I used a spring mix that had some in there. It was dominantly baby spinach leaves and it worked nicely in this too. I anticipated trouble with the goat cheese balls so I took an extra step to make sure it didn't happen. I don't know if this was necessary or not but I'll share what I did anyways. Goat cheese is soft to begin with and gets really soft once you start rolling it into balls. After my balls were rolled and coated in the breadcrumb I stuck them in freezer for 30 minutes. I wanted them as chilled and firm as they could be prior to dropping them in that hot oil. Again, I don't know if that step was even necessary but it worked like a charm. One thing I do know for sure is that you have to watch these closely. Once you see the cheese starting to bubble pull them out of the oven. This would be a great recipe for impressing guests. The flavor is great and the fried goat cheese makes a lovely presentation. The only thing I will do differently next time is double the dressing.
