While I did add some fresh minced garlic because that's what I'm used to, I did not squeeze the fresh lime over my portion.  Hubs did and said I should have.  He said I missed out because it gave it a subtle but delicious flavor!

Delicious. A great way to use fresh greens at its peak . I also added 1/2 tsp minced garlic and a bit of onion. The lime really does add some zing!

This was actually pretty good.  We have been looking for something to do with all the Chard we have growing in our garden.  Chard is usually too bitter for me, but this recipe made it quite good, without any of the bitter.

Nice cure for cabin fever-fresh greens and one's favorite seed catalog.  I didn't add a thing to the recipe.  The lime, salt, and oil are plenty.

A little bland. I still like lemon better with chard. Would make again with some garlic, onion, and lemon with the lime.

I'm not really fond of swiss chard and was looking for a new preparation.  This is so simple yet that touch of lime made a difference.  My husband really liked it.

Good stuff.  I copied some others and added some fresh garlic.  I’ll make it again but will back off just a touch on the lime.

I’d use a little less water for a thicker soup, maybe 6 cups instead of 8. I only had 2 leeks so I added regular white onion as well.

Instead of kosher salt, subbed in lemon pepper salt--went really well with the lime and lemon juice. Also added a teaspoonful of minced garlic and a bit of chili powder for a kick. Original recipe is a great way to do up leafy veg, just some personal preferences. Will make again!

I'm sorry to say I didn't like this. I normally love Swiss chard and was looking forward to a new recipe. I followed the instructions exactly but found the chard undercooked and just overpowered by the lime and salt. Swiss chard in itself has such a nice delicate flavor but I felt this recipe didn't allow that flavor to come out. Sorry. I do appreciate you taking the time to share the recipe though. It just wasn't to MY taste.
