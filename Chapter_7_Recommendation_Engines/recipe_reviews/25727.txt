Okay for a base but will need extras added. I added Rotel tomatoes and garlic. Very quick to make.

This was great in a casual dressed up tomato soup way. I served it with homemade cornbread and it was gobbled down. It probably would make a good base but it doesn't NEED anything else unless you think cream of tomato soup NEEDS something else. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's not the kind of recipe that I would use to impress guests.

As mentioned this is a good base. I added salsa sauteed onions with mushrooms and garlic. If I make this again I'll add corn and green peppers too. I used vegetarian tomato-beans (not molasses) I also added a lot of black pepper but some other spices would work too. I don't know if I'll try this recipe again I might look for another version with more ingrediants.
