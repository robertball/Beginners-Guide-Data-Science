This is my recipe, and I just want to add a few notes here. This is a sweet, smoothie-like lassi. If you prefer your drink a little less sweet, you can reduce the honey or use plain yogurt in place of the vanilla yogurt. If you have trouble finding lemon yogurt in your area, use plain yogurt and add 1 or 2 tablespoons of frozen lemonade concentrate. Also, I used canned sliced mango and just added the intact pieces to the blender. It isn't really necessary to puree them first; it just makes it easier to measure. A final note: as I submitted it, the recipe says serve chilled; I personally think it tastes better cold. Enjoy! (I was just going to add this comment without rating it, but it won't allow me to do that, so, 5 stars, LOL!)

Love It!!  I used fresh mango, plain fat free Greek yogurt, mango nectar, lemon juice and honey.  The cardamom took it from very good to WOW!  Thanks for sharing

This recipe is excellent! I read ElectRicity's note and followed her advice, I only used organic fat free plain yogurt and added lemonade concentrate, I omitted honey and used frozen mangoes instead of canned because that's what I had. I was skeptical of the Cardamom but it gives a really nice flavor. I will be making this again, thanks for the recipe!

My daughter and I are smacking our lips together as I type this. So delicious and filling. I had both the lemon and vanilla yogurts on hand, used 3 whole ripe mangos, but I didn't have any of the mango nectar. Instead I did use a bit of orange juice concentrate. Very tasty little mid-day break. Love it.

Even without cardamom, this lassi recipe makes a great drink that's perfect for sipping along with dinner, or for savoring on its own as dessert.  Because I already had plain yogurt in the house for other recipes, I whipped up substitutes for the lemon yogurt and vanilla yogurt -- I mixed lemon juice and sugar into two cups of plain yogurt, and vanilla extract and sugar into the other cup of yogurt.  It worked great!  I also used a whole mango and just tossed it into the blender in chunks instead of pureeing it, and while that meant my lassi wasn't perfectly smooth, the texture was actually really nice.

Yum! I loved the touch of cardamom in this. I also like the bite of plain yogurt, so I did use the submitter's suggestion regarding that, and topped this with chopped mango and mint. Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous! Since I didn't have any flavored yogurt, I followed the submitter's suggestion and used plain yogurt with a tbsp. of frozen lemonade concentrate.  Silly me, only had PINK lemonade concentrate on hand, but it worked and I was happy to find out it did not alter the color of the drink at all!  The mango, lemon and cardamom combination is just delicious - will make this one again and again! Thanks, *eclectRicity*!

I liked this, but the lemon yogurt was overpowering. It tasted more like lemon lassi than mango. Think i will use plain or vanilla yogurt next time.

This was the perfect consistency (thick!) but the flavor was off. Next time I won't use the lemon-flavored yogurt--will try using only vanilla or maybe even plain. Great potential, just not quite right as written.

Came out sooo good. I didn’t realize how much it made though. My blender wasn’t big enough for all the ingredients. Had to do it in batches.
