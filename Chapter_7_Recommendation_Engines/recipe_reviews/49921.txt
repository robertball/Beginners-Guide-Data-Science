I make a salad just like this and believe me it is DELICIOUS! The sweetness of the strawberry melds incredibly well with the bite of the blue cheese (try LaVergne very smooth blue). Once you try this salad you'll wonder why you didn't have this before. Also try different fruits like apples, pears, grapes, pineapple, etc. I'm glad you decided to share this recipe with others. Thanks.

Everyone loved this salad at the party! I used an interesting blend of greens including spinach. I included some delicious sliced nectarines (pear would also be wonderful), and used a pear infused balsmic vingarette I whipped up. I also took the time to sugar coat my pecans the evening before. The left overs were snatched up before I could get some!! Thank you!!!!

I have made this recipe twice with rave reviews. I substituted gorgonzola for the blue cheese and  used 4 ounces instead of 8 ounces. Very easy to make and looks great in a clear glass bowl!!

This turned out quite good.  I made the following adjustments:  Used a store bought vinegarette (blush wine by Brianna's), used glazed/sugared walnuts, and gargonzola cheese.  Everyone had seconds, but no one raved or complimented the recipe.  I loved it, though!  I would actually give it a 4 and a half if there were such a rating.

Made this with spinach and it is AMAZING. The only problem was that it didn't keep too well and the recipe made way too much for one person. Next time I will just toss together single servings each time I want to eat it.

Couldn't find the raspberry vinegar so substituted it with white wine vinegar and it was so yummy.  There were no leftovers! A friend was pleasantly surprised that there were strawberries and NOT tomatoes in the salad!

This was OK; I was wanting a little sweeter taste; husband said he would give it a "4." Don't think I will make it again.

Yummy! I only had red wine vinegar instead of raspberry but this recipe was still very very good. I've never eaten strawberries in salad before since I usually eat them all plain as soon as I buy them. This was a good way to use them though. I love blue cheese and walnuts but never expected them to go with strawberries, but this salad is one of the best I've ever had. I'm glad I toasted the walnuts because that made them so much better. I will be making this very often.

This was a nice light salad. The dressing was very mild and very light and fresh. I added some onion powder to the dressing and left out the onion. I wasn't sure about the blue cheese and was afraid it might be too strong because I am used to feta, but it turned out to be a perfect blend in this mix and didn't overpower this dish at all. The toasted pecans were the best! Thanks for a great salad!

Served for husband's 45th birthday dinner. Tasty and different. Served with Roasted Lamb with Root Vegetables  and Flathead Cherry Compote. The only thing I did differently was to add 1 T sugar and 1 T brown sugar when heating the pecans.

This salad was good, but the dressing was a little too vinegary for our tastes.  I will definitely make this again, but with a different dressing recipe.

Not for everyone, but I thought this salad was brilliant! Such a different combo of flavors, however, they worked so well together. I used leftover walnuts (from yesterday's salad) and a bottled raspberry dressing. Thanks so much Chrissie!

Tasty combo although the dressing is a little tart. It could use a pinch of sugar. Otherwise it was great. I used slivered almonds instead of the pecans and I liked that addition.

I had something similar at Milestones and wanted to replicate the recipe... It was so delicious... here's what I changed: 

- I glazed the pecans by adding some honey, a tsp of chilli powder and a tsp of olive oil in a small frying pan for about 5 minutes 
- I carmalized the red onions in a small frying pan with some butter to mellow them out

It tasted exactly like the salad I had at the restaurant.

Yum. Yum. Yum. Made this today and it is fabulous! Used baby spinach instead of mixed greens and for the nuts I used the sugar coated pecans recipe on this site. Used a bottled light raspberry walnut vinagrette dressing. Wonderful!

I served it for Easter Dinner and everyone ate it.  They liked it and commented that it was so much better than they thought it would be.  It had a little too much blue cheese for me.  If I make it again I will use gorgonzola.

I was a little disappointed in this, as I have had similar salads that were fabulous. This one was missing something. I did add sugared walnuts which worked well. I gave it a "4" because I didn't use the highest quality of cheese, so maybe that would make a difference? Anyway, I will keep tweaking this one.

Yum! I can’t have nuts so left them off. Cut recipe in 1/2 since only feeding 2. (1/2 makes 3 servings and that was perfect!) No raspberry vinegar, used white wine vinegar. Added 1/4 diced avocado and all fresh spinach. It was super good and will make again. Loved it with blueberries and sliced strawberries. So good!

This was pretty good, but I would add some sugar to the dressing.  Maybe because my strawberries weren't that sweet, but I would have enjoyed the dressing more had it been sweeter.

This salad was wonderful except that it had way too much blue cheese (and I love blue cheese!)  Half the amount called for is plenty!

The salad was very good.  I took this to a barbecue as my side dish and it was very popular. Several folks (including me) went back for seconds. I did add bacon to the salad, used an outstanding blue, beautiful strawberries and spinach, and, in lieu of  diced red onion, used the wonderful Penzey’s Spices toasted onion in the dressing.

The dressing!  Whoa!  So much vinegar flavor, needs something sweet to cut it.   If you make this, think about adding some sugar, or using less dressing.

This salad was a hit with my family.    I did not make the same dressing.  I made a balsamic and honey dressing. Definitely making it again.

I enjoyed the combination of ingredients in the salad but the dressing was not to our tastes.  I will make this again using a different dressing.

Always a great and refreshing salad. The dressing is full of flavor and so simple to make.
