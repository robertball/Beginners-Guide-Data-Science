I've tried many different chili recipes and this was one of the best. It was very rich. I, true to form, added fresh garlic to the onions and jalapenos, which I sauteed in some olive oil prior to adding the meat and etc. I also adjusted the "hot" because I like spicy food, but, not so spicy that my mouth is on fire. If you're like me, try using a 1/4 cup of chili powder, 1 tbl. of tobasco, 2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, and the rest as stated. Next time, I might add some chopped celery or celery seed and maybe another can of beer to make it soupier. But, I can't rave enough about this recipe! This sounds cheesy, but it dances on your tongue! Serve with tortilla chips, a dollop of sour cream and some fresh chopped chives! Thanks!

Please keep in mind that cooking beer for 2 hours as the recipe states winds up cooking away any alcohol from the beer. All that's left is the flavor.

This was definitely the best chili I have ever made.  I am really picky about the kinds of chili I like.  It had excellent flavor.  I made it with the amounts of "hot stuff" that were stated in the recipe, and it was perfect if you like some heat.  It had kick, but not too overwhelmingly hot. I served it to a crowd, and they all raved about it.  This will definitely be made again and again...

Congrats to "FRANK" for this recipie.  I read as though it would be "just right" for me regarding the spices, however for my wife - she doesn't eat the really spicy stuff.  So I didn't use the (4) peppers, rather I used two of Ortega's small cans of diced green chili peppers.  I was more than pleased with how the taste of the chili was on the first day, but as with all chili, the second day was better yet.  I was able to enjoy the heat of the spices, which stay on the tongue for a brief moment - not too long to not taste the chili, coupled with the sweetness of all the onion and the taste of the beer flavour.  My wife enjoyed the taste and complemented the recipie due to the spices not overpowering the taste.  That was the moment of realizing chili success.

A definite keeper, excellent Chili! Will be making this again. Came out with just the right amount of heat for the spicy food lovers. If you don't like spicy foods or have children, you may want to try it without the optional red pepper flakes, or add it near the end to match your preference.

Awesome Chili. My department entered this chili in a chili cookoff and we took People's Choice. Thanks for the great recipe!

Love this spicy chili!  First time I like to make a recipe exactly as written but in subsequent preparations I have not used the Tabasco as it is too dominant in regard to the overall flavor, and use 2 tbsp red pepper flakes instead of 3.

Frank, I love this chili.  I have made it several times, and just made it last night again, but had to change it a little due to lack of ingredients.  I only had one can of diced tomatoes, so added one can of rotel cilantro and lime diced tomatoes.  I had one pound of ground turkey and just less than one pound of sirloin steak chopped in small pieces.  I didn't want to go to the store, so had to make do with what I had.  My beer was Yuengling and it worked out great.  We like spicy, but not to hot, so added 1/4 cup chili pepper and several dashes of hot pepper sauce (chihula sauce), no pepper flakes or jalapeno peppers, just some shakes of red pepper.  My beans were one can of pintos and one can of kidney.  Many changes, but so similar to your recipe.  It turned out great and I just wanted to let you know that these small changes can still produce a great chili.  If you have a large group to serve, you can also cook a pot of white rice and serve the chili on top - really can feed a crowd.  I have college age kids and friends and am always looking for ways to feed a lot without too much expense.  Everyone raved about the recipe on a cold evening.  Update 3/17/14  I am still making this delicious chili and found that a stout beer is the best to use.  I follow the recipe as written except for adjusting the spices down a little for our taste. I still get great reviews when I serve this.  Thanks again!

Absolutely awesome.  Between the beer (I used a flying dog K-9 Winter Ale) and bacon greese - there was a flavor my million batches never had.  Fantastic!  Thank you for a great and new way to flavor chili.

Wow!!!  What A great recipe.  I made 2 batches and omitted the spices for my kids, and added them to the other one.  The whole family loved it.  Even my husband who is hard to please when it comes to chili because he likes it spicey.  I added more spice and it was nearly too hot for me.  lol  Husband loved it though.  Thank You so much for this recipe.  Definate keeper.

I make this all the time! I omit the jalepeno peppers and hot sauce-too spicy for my taste.  I add cinnamon and garlic powder. And the type of beer makes a big difference!  Bud Light will not give you good results. Do yourself a favor and use a lager or porter-it has a fuller flavor. Serve with Fritos. YUM!

I've used this recipe as the base recipe for my chili for the past year or so and everyone loves it. Sure you have to be able to handle the spice...I even add some habanero to give it more of a kick...but if you love spicy food this is the chili for you!!

Nice chili.  I halved the amount and used the other 6 ounces of O'Doul's to make beer bread to go with this.   Works just fine with a ground meat sub like Morning Star Farm Crumbles.  I used near beer [O'Doul's Amber]because we don't drink.  Not too spicy for me but I eat HOT.  May want to reduce if you don't think pureed jalapenos [inc stems and seed] makes a great hot sauce.  Added a bit of cumin and roasted garlic and roasted peppers for more depth.  If reducing heat you may want to add such items also.

Wow I never knew chili could be this good? I did not add all of the jalepeno's, hot sauce or red pepper flakes, decided to start out slow, used 2 Jalepeno's, 1 T hot sauce and 1 T red pepper flakes, 1/4th of a red pepper and 1/4th of a yellow pepper for color,  it was just the right amount of heat! We made several batches to serve at a special olympics fundraiser... wow the compliments we received....by far the best recipe I've ever tried! Thanks!!

this is simmering now and tastes wonderful so I am really excited to see how it tastes after a day or so.  I have never really followed a recipe when making chili but decided to this time and yummmm the flavor are very tasty (I did omit the Jalapenos bc I dont have any and the red pepper flakes for my toddler).  I also (from other reviews) added some cinnamon & cumin & WOW cinnamon really gives chili a kick and a lil ting on your tongue.  Cant wait until 5:30 when my DH will be here and we EAT this yummy chili! Thank you for posting!

I make all kinds of chili and this was fabulous!  Of course I had to health it up and make it my own with the following tweaks.  1 pound ground turkey instead of 2 pounds ground chuck, 1 large white onion instead of two, one green bell pepper diced, 4 celery stalks diced, one McCormick low sodium chili seasoning packet, 2 jalapenos diced WITH seeds instead of 4 seeded, 3 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce from a can diced.  Omit the tabasco, chili powder and red pepper flakes...the chipotle and jalapenos with seeds add plenty of heat.  Also a couple of drops of liquid heat.  Keep the beer, worcestershire sauce, 2 cans of spicy chili beans, 2 cans of diced tom, 2 cans tom sauce. Serve with cornbread, top with fresh cilantro, green onion, sour cream and cheese.  Amazing!

This is delicious--no leftovers!  I had to tone it down for the kids, so omitted chili powder, jalepenos, and red pepper (but I did use the hot sauce for some kick).  I was surprised that I didn't need to add any salt.  I suppose the beer, worcestershire, and onions provide enough flavor that hubby didn't need to add salt at the table!  This is an excellent recipe that we will make again.  Thanks for sharing!

Amazing chili.  Did a search on Google for Beer chili, found this and absolutely love it.  I don't like really spicy stuff that makes my nose run, so I only used 1.5 jalepenos with a scoville  rating of around 3000 and a little less than a third of chili powder, and no red flakes.  It still left it with a small bite but allowed the flavors to come through really well.

This is my go-to chili recipe. The only modification I make is instead of 2 cans for tomato sauce, I use 1 can sauce and 1 small jar spaghetti sauce for the extra seasoning. So delicious.

Absolutley love this recipe!  It has become our new favorite chili and my husband has won 2 chili cook offs with it!  We like it very spicy, so we use 2 jalapenos and 2 habaneros, plus some assorted hot sauces, etc., to "bam" it up a bit.  The beer is totally the key!  Enjoy!

Really, if I could, I'd like to give this recipe 4 1/2 stars. I slightly tweaked it to personal preference only. The portions of meat, beans and spices were right on, that without it, I probably couldn't have done it by myself. My sight changes included additional spices - 1 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp grd cayenne (omitted red pepper flakes) and 1 1/2 tsp salt.  Two seeded and chopped serrano chiles and four chopped garlic cloves (omitted jalapenos). No tomato sauce, substituted with tomatoe paste and a can of water. Simmered for two hours. Perfect!

This was absolutely delicious!! We cooked it in the slow cooker for 5 hours. Added one chopped chipotle pepper in adobo sauce rather than adding hot sauce! Can't wait to taste it AGAIN in 2 days! Thanks, Frank

I like a spicy chili but this was just too much for me.  I followed the recipe exactly- except I used  green chilis instead of jalopanoes.  I have had much better chilis.  It was just o.k.

This is THE BEST chili recipe I've ever made. It has amazing flavor and a good amount of spice. not so much as to overpower the flavor. I used all the suggested red pepper flakes, chili powder, 1 habenero, and 2 jalepenos) The only thing it was missing is texture. Next time I'm going to use some chunky steak :]
I also used miller lite and tapatio. excellent taste and overall amaaazing chili

Just made this tonight. Husband & kids loved it. I left out the jalapeño peppers & Tabasco sauce. Don't think the kids would be to happy with me if I used them. I am sure that it will be even better tomorrow.

A little dark for my preferences, but tastes pretty good. I cut down on the spiciness some and kind of wish I hadn't. Next time I will go with the full recipe.

This is excellant !!!!! I maade it just as it is written and it turned out very flavorful. Definetly let it sit atleast overnight for the flavors to marry, because it is much better after it sits. Gave some to my brother and nephew and they both enjoyed it also. This is now my goto chili recipe

This chili was great, made 4 servings (so I cut the recipe in half). A bit sharp from the tomatoes so I added 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon of cumin. Rounded the flavored out perfectly! Also, I omitted the jalapeños.  I'll definitely make this chili again. Thanks!

I had high hopes for this chili ... it was good but not great. It was thin and  way too "tomatoey". I added an extra 1/4 cup of chili powder and an extra can of beans (since it was so thin) but it still didn't have the flavor we were looking for. I didn't add the red peppers (it would have made it "hot" but not more flavorful). I'll go back to my old standby.

Just finished making this and OMG it is like torture having to wait the 2 days. I tasted it and it is absolutely delicious and smells sooo good. It is going to be hard to wait to eat it but I will manage. I did everything as written but added about 2.5 minced garlic cloves. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was easy to make and if you add the red pepper flakes it spices it up a lot more.  I used canned jalapenos since I forgot to buy the fresh ones, also we ate it after 2 hours and then in a few days and it is better after the 2nd day.  I'll be making this again! Thanks for posting!

This is great stuff. I give it 5 stars, not that it's the best chili ever, necessarily, but it belongs up there with the handful of best chili recipes. I made this pretty much as written. My beef was 85% lean (not sure if it was chuck or not), and a tad over 2 pounds. The beer used was a bottle of Corona Light. I also opted to add the red pepper flakes, which I crushed at home from a bag of dried "whole chile pequin" I had. The smell while cooking was tantalizing, so I had a bowl soon after it was done. The beer taste was pretty noticeable and I didn't like that. So I refrigerated the rest, and on the 3rd, 4th and 5th days had the rest. It really does get better! The beer taste faded into the background, and the spices and heat really developed wonderfully. It made 7 fairly big bowlfuls for me. The chili has a bit of liquid in it (I see that some reviewers complained about that), but not at all too much, in my opinion. It is a very nice blend of textures and flavors, and is pretty hot if you make it with everything listed. I made it again today, and look forward to enjoying it in a couple of days. Thanks for a great chili recipe!

This is by far the best chili recipie I've come across.  Instead of using the red pepper flakes, I used 3 Jalapenos and 2 Habanjeros.  It was really tasty.  Next time I think I'll do 4 Jalapenos and 3 Habaneros... I like it hot!

this chili was AMAZING! i made it for a bonfire party and all the guys loved it. some of the girls thought it was too spicy but i think they are just wimps! HA! it had an excellent flavor and a perfect consistency. i was expecting us to have leftovers but the guests ate every bite (and i even tripled the recipe). this is my new go-to chili recipe!!

I made a less-spicy version of this for my family and it went over very well, even my picky 6 year old ate it. After sauteing the ground beef, I cooked it in the crock pot.  THe only thing I will change next time is I will soften the onions a bit up before the crock pot, they stayed kind of crunchy.

I made this for the superbowl and had to copy the recipe for all my guests, they loved it so much!  By far, the best chili I've made from all recipes so far.  It is good the first day, better the second, and H O T  the third.
If you do not like a lot of spice, cut back on the peppers!

Wow!  Super yummy!  I don't like my chili super spicy, so I left out the jalapenos, red pepper flakes, and hot sauce.  I used one can of spicy chili beans and cajun worcestshire sauce and it was fantastic!!!  It was my first time making chili and a great success. Thanks :)

Easily the best chili I've ever made. I cooked it with only two of the jalapenos chopped up in the chili, and the other two just floating whole while simmering, still giving the flavor but not all of the heat. I'm making it again for New Year's Eve.

My husband and I love chili during football season and this recipe is awesome! We cook in our crock pot. We also don't use the exact amounts the recipe calls for with the spicy stuff and onions but all the ingred. are used. It is still spicy and gets better everyday after cooking.

I stumbled across this recipe while searching for a different chili recipe.  
 Since I am living in AL, I decided to try it.  I cut back on the spicyness because I have a 6 yr old.  However, the things I did differently were: I cooked the beef with the onions to make the onions less noticable in the chili, and I cut back on the heat.  I used one small can of fire roasted chilis and the 1/3 cup of chili powder, and 1 TSP of the red pepper flakes.  It was perfect for my child.  And it also tasted really good.  This is a recipe that is very adaptable and very tasty!  Excellent!!

I love this chili recipe. I have made it six times in as many months. I usually take the recipe and divide it between two separate pots so I can make a mild one and a ridiculously hot one. That way guests who don't care for spicy food can still enjoy it. I also love to use the leftovers to make killer chilidogs.

I made this chili using all of the ingredients listed, except I did not add the hot peppers!  And I used 2 Tablespoons of crushed red pepper flakes.  My husband loves "spicy" chili but this was a bit too hot!  The next time, I will eliminate the crushed red pepper flakes and cut back on the chili powder.  The texture of the chili is good and with less heat I am sure it will be just perfect!

My hubby and I stumbled upon this last year.  We love it.  My hubby likes to tweak his hot foods so he has since added another 1lb. of hot italian sausage (he is from NY).  Just great, and my kids love it too, even as hot as it is.

I've been helping a friend that recently opened a concession area at a local flea market. 

With just a tweak or two, as cooks are want to do, this recipe has proven to be a huge success. 

My friend and others stated "This is the best chili I've ever eaten."

I say that not to brag on my cooking prowess, but to give accolades to the recipe and the great cook that submitted it.

Overall, this was very good and a hit with the kids.  I did hold back on the red pepper, but still had plenty of "ZIP"!   One thing to caution is that you may want to add a little less chili powder than the recipe calls for.
will make this again though!!

This was great! I cut the hot sauce in half and didn't use red pepper and the heat was perfect. I added a little Cumin, Oregeno & sugar.

This was good, but it would have been too runny if I had added the amount of beer and tomato juice stated in the recipe. I cut back on the liquid, and used less chili powder too. I also threw in a couple of Knorr Chipotle seasoning cubes which added a nice smoky flavor. It was too spicy for me, but Husband enjoyed it. Thanks!

I love this chili. I've made it with both ground chuck and ground turkey, and it tastes fantastic either way. I generally will brown the meat, and then throw all the ingredients in my slow cooker for 10 hours or so. I've used several different kinds of beer, but i love using smoked beer. I Most recently used the German Schlenkerla Rauchbier Marzen, which is smoked over beechwood, and basically tastes like bacon. I also recommend the Stone Smoked Porter, or if you really wanna go nuts, the Evil Twin Ashtray Heart (a smoked stout, which will give a very subtle coffee flavor to the chili... sounds weird, but it works!)

This is the best chili I've ever had. I've made it several times and my boyfriend always mentions how great it was. We love it so much we've made it even on the hottest of days in the middle of summer. It's perfect if you really love spicy food.

Awesome recipe. I did cut back a bit on the spices, however next time I probably won't. It all simmers together and really just adds flavor as opposed to heat. It was so good and a nice change from our normal beer chili recipe.

I thought this chili was good, but not spectacular.  My husband and my friend thought it was way too spicy, and I even cut down on the amount of spice I put in (only one T of Tabasco and one T of crushed red pepper).  I had really hoped the beer taste would be prominent, but it just wasn't there.  Topped it with Fritos and a dollop of sour cream.

I have never felt the need to review anything before but this chili was FANTASTIC!!! I have spent many years trying to find or create the "Perfect" chili recipe and my search is over!! It is great if you either follow the recipe to the "T" or a great base to make it the way you want!! Just enough spice too!!

This is a great chili reciepe!  It has a lot of zip.  We did not think it was too soupy like other reviewers.  We like a thick chili, but this consistancy along with the flavor was perfect. We made a batch for the kids ommiting the hot stuff and they LOVED it.  This will be our new chili reciepe! Anyone who likes chili can adjust the peppers and spice to make a great pot of chili. Hot or not! Thanks.

This chilli is great!  For those who think it's a bit thin, i have made it with either 3 pounds of beef or 2 pounds beef and 1 pound crumbled bacon.  Both made this a much thicker chilli.  The spice level on this is great.  It's hot enough for a little sweat on the brow but not hot enough to make you stop eating.  thanks for posting this recipe!

Love it but I didn't exactly follow the recipe on th 2nd batch.   Went with 1 lb ground round & 1 lb ground turkey vs. 2 lbs chuck. Instead of 2 onions went w/1 large onion & 3 Anaheim peppers. Cut back slightly on the chilli powder and added cumin & garlic. Skipped the Tabasco & used 1 tbsp chilli paste.  Tossed in about 18 oz Fat Tire amber ale and drank a few more as it simmered. It really is better the longer it blends but I couldn't wait & scarfed a bowl as it was cooling!

I love this chili recipe.   I am pretty wary of working with raw jalepenos (because I can be careless, especially about rubbing my eyes) so I often just use sliced jalapenos from a jar.  I like the effect so I don't worry about it too much.

Made this recipe for a chili cook off at work.  Took home first place. First time I've ever won a cooking contest.  I agree with some of the other reviews about adding garlic to sautee with the ground beef. I also added a Tbsp of spicy mustard to it and a few pieces of bacon.  Turned out great!

I've made this chili twice now and both times were a hit.  I threw in an extra jalapeño and used some habanero hot sauce, so mine might be a little spicier than normal but not overwhelming.  I'm no master chef, but this recipe can make anyone look like a pro.

The four jalapenos was too hot for me, so I substituted 2 medium poblanos instead... a little more veggie, less heat, but still spicy, I also substituted Coke Zero for the beer (wanted a few less carbs).
This turned out great!!!

I did not care for this recipe.  I thought the beer sounded good, but that was all I could taste when it was done, was beer taste.  I will not make it again.

A great recipe. She's a spicy one so have some sour cream on hand to top off a bowl.   I went easy on the hot stuff but the hot sauce I had was xx hot. Glad I only added 2 jalapenos and 1 tbspn of red pepper flakes.  Most like the heat in our family  so this will be a hit. Will save this recipe and make again.

This is an excellent chili. recipe. I just did one thing that I always do when I make chili. I season the meat with some of the chili powder before I brown it with the onions.  That I will always do. Makes a huge difference in the depth of flavors. Thanks for the recipe

This is Amazing Chili I have made it 6 or 7 times now with rave reviews. I did cut back on chili powder and only added a few drops of hot sauce. I added  a can of Rotel tomatoes  for chili fixins. This is a winner and YES it does get better the next day.

I actually split the recipe in half, I just made it for myself. I would make some changes to it next time though. I will leave out the pepper flakes and add more beer. I tasted too much of the tomato sauce. But I still enjoyed it!

I love how easy this recipe is and has quite a kick to it. I don't include the jalopenos when making it for a large group to cut some of the spice.

This was very good, almost too hot but not quite, a little bit hotter and it would have been too painful to eat. I think next time I make this I will add 1 jalapeno  instead of 4. This chili thickens up nicely by day 2 and it gets milder the longer it sits in the fridge. I used plain canned Kidney beans  instead of chili beans because I couldn't find them. For the pepper sauce I used Sriracha sauce.

Reduced the heat slightly. Added green pepper and garlic.  Cooked this in my pressure cooker for 25 mins on high. Would make again!

GREAT RECIPE

I had some left over shredded beef from the last time I made Bar B Que beef sandwiches and decided to use it to make this chili.  

I basically did exactly as the chef suggested and adjusted the ingredients to taste. 

I used two bottles of beer, fresh diced tomato, onion, chili powder, garlic, Tabasco, crushed red pepper, cayenne pepper, jalapeno peppers, and Worcestershire sauce....DELICIOUS!!!
