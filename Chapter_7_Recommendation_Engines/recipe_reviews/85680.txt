Wow! Very delicious. Marinated overnight. Needs to be served with a vegetable. We had it with spicy bean salsa, which was also very good, but it wasn't quite enough...maybe some lime-juice corn?

this chicken is yummy! I bbq'd the chicken and just made the "lime sauce" in a sauce pan on the stove. I got rave reviews from the family.

Very simple.  I melted in cream cheese to leftover marinade, served over a thin bed of lettuce with crumble tortilla chips on top.  Good stuff!

This was sooooo good! The sauce had the right amount of tartness and the chicken turned out moist. It made alot of sauce and it was great over rice! YUMMY!

This chicken was wonderful!  It is very easy and fast (once it marinades.)  It turned out juicy and tender.  The only thing to keep in mind, it tastes like the marinade, sooo, if you're not big on citrus or margarita, there is a good chance you won't care for this.  (I know, sounds obvious, but some marinades you taste more than others, and this one you taste!)  Very good, will make again.  Thanks!

This chicken is FABULOUS!!!  Who knew that something SO easy could be so good?  You don't get any easier than this dish!  I carmalized some onions first and added it to the chicken.  My boyfriend wants to try it with a stir fry...I think that will be great, too.

Great dish! The sauce thickened perfectly,making the chicken coated and moist. Will definately make again, perfect for a mexican/island themed dinner.

Very easy recipe, not an overpowering margarita flavor. I used leftover chicken for a yummy chicken salad. Delicioso!

This is a tasty dish and easy to make. My husband and I thought it was fairly good, but our friends thought it was great. I'll surely make this again.

I served this to guests and everyone thought it was great.  I sliced the leftover chicken the following day and put in a whole wheat wrap with vegetables. YUM!

I was not impressed with the recipe.  The chicken was tender and everything but the taste was too much for me and I love limes.
