This is a wonderful recipe!  It's quick and has a delicious taste.  I actually marianated my chicken breasts overnight in a teriyaki marinade for extra flavor in the breasts.  I also added snow peas (in the pod) and it was absolutely delicious!

Delicious and super easy recipe, and flexible too! I only made three changes: 1) used Tbsp of minced garlic instead of powder, 2) sauteed onions and garlic prior to adding chicken to the skillet, 3) upped the pineapple to 10oz (just because I really like pineapple). Tasted great!!! I will definitely make it again and perhaps add some sugar snaps and julienned carrots.

What a great recipe! It was easy and very, very good! I served it over rice. I didn't add the mushrooms because I didn't have any but I loved the peppers...not too many for us at all. I used corn starch instead of flour to thicken it. I didn't marinade my chicken...just cooked it on the stove until cooked through and it was very tender and full of flavor. Thanks for the great recipe! PS - my younger son did think it was a little too spicy, so if you have younger children you could watch how much of the crushed pepper you add. But we liked it!

I followed the directions and ended up with a very thick, over-sauced waste of a meal. IF I ever make this meal again, I will skip the flour and add less teriyaki sauce.

Came out great!  I did spend a little more time on the chicken because I decided to dip it in flour and then fry it.  It tasted great, I loved the sweetness of it and the pineapples.

Really good recipe served it with brown and wild rice.  I used fresh pineapples,(can have a high sugar content)grilled on the george forman grill.  It only took a couple of minutes and the grilling added extra flavor

If I could, I would give this a four and a half. Had a great flavor! It made too much sauce for my taste, but my bf loved the sauce. I will only use half the pineapple juice next time, and 3/4 C teriyaki. I really liked the cooking method, I was skeptical of not sauteeing the veggies before adding the liquid, but this way they stayed fresh and crisp. I also used cornstarch instead of flour, and that gave me a nice glossy sauce (even though it was too much!). Will make again.

Fast, easy and transports well.  I took to a potluck and it was the first dish to go.  I cooked the night before to save time and reheated the next day just before the party. I topped off with pineapple rings grilled on my Mr Grill.  This dish really went over with the teenagers.

I used a second can of Pineapple and the juice to make a rue with the flour... Also marinading the chicken in the Teriyaki sauce made it much more tender!   It was a hit with my family!

Ok  This is a really good idea! I admit I changed some things just because of what I had on hand. I sauted minced garlic and onion in oil (added 1/2 tsp sesame oil to the mix). Added chicken that marinated in Kens Honey Teriaki sauce for 30 min. Cooked until no longer pink. Threw in pinneapple and juice. Added frozen stir fry veggi mix. I used 1/4 cup Whole Wheat flour for thickening. AWESOME!!! So quick!! So good!!
*** The only disappointing part of this dinner was that my husband and sons did not like it. But they are not really big Stir Fry eaters.

I made this recipe tonight and adusted it down to 4 servings. To cut down the sodium I used a No Sodium Marinade by Lawry with a ginger flavor, because teriyaki has too much salt in it. I used all of the other ingredients in the correct proportion and it was fantastic! I also had some fresh pineapple leftover and cut it into bite size pieces. I made fresh sesame green beans to serve with it. Didn't need a starch and there was great flavor. Thanks for posting this recipe.

It was easy to make and yummy.  I would have liked it to be sweeter.  Next time I will add more teriyaki sauce.  I sprinkle the flour in slowly at the end and the sauce came out perfectly.  I did marinate the chicken in teriyaki sauce for a while first. I will make this again.

Well this was a huge hit with my family! My wife absolutely loved it. I had to double some of the ingredients as I made this for our family night meal. This is a great summer meal.

This is a fantastic and easy meal!  My husband asked me to make sure that I know where I keep this recipe!  After reading some of the reviews and complaints that it was not sweet enough, I added only a teaspoon of Splenda.  Everything about this dish was really, really good. I would not hesitate to make this for guests ot for a potluck.  Thank you for this delicious recipe!

I followed the recipe except I added fresh green beans and WOW was it awesome over rice. I recommend this to anyone who loves Asian food.

If I had to describe this in one word, "AWESOME"!!!!!  I also used fresh garlic cut up instead of garlic powder. You have to try this, yummy yummy!!!

I loved this recipe!! I followed it exactly the first time I made it, and everyone loved it. I am making it again today and making a couple of adjustments. I'm using a little less teriyaki sauce and adding some pineapple juice. I want a little more of the pineapple flavor. I will also be using canned mushrooms because I don't have any fresh. I will be skipping the crushed red pepper because my fiance cant handle the spicy. This is  by far my favorite recipe so far.

I gave this 4 stars because of the nice blend flavors and ease of cooking. I'm no chef but I think I had this done in less than the 40 min described! I will make again but 1) marinade the chicken- mine got tough. Maybe garlic/lemon/ginger/chili as it does NOT need more teriyaki. 2) reduce flour- 1/4c makes this sticky and gooey, not saucy. 3) I added fresh ginger and used reduced sodium Kikkoman Teriyaki 4) I chunked everything but will cut in strips next to ease cooking. As good or better the next day.

This was a defreakinglious meal!! I marinated my chicken in some teriyaki sauce, garlic & ginger all day in a zip lock bag. I used a lot less peppers. I went to the salad bar and they had nice strips of green, yellow , orange and red peppers and I grabed a few heaping tongs full  and this was much cheper and we would not have liked 3 whole peppers in this dish. I did add a bag of frozen sugar peas. I added some ginger and just a little curry. These were the only changes I made and this was just awsome!! Will make this again for sure. Such a nice change.

The concept behind this dish is wonderful. It's full of flavor and fresh veggies, unfortunately the final product was lackluster. The recipe calls for way too much soy sauce and flour. I used 3/4 cup of soy sauce and 1 tbs of corn starch and that was more than enough. Also, 1 tsp of crushed red pepper is way too much. It was so hot, it was difficult to taste anything else- and I love hot foods. Half that amount would be so much better.

I liked this dish but tought it would have more taste. I think I would use another teriyaki saice next time as I can't see why else it would not be devine. Maybe make my own instead of using bottled.  I also added carrots and left out the bell peppers for allergy reasons. Added leeks and mung bean sprouts. It was a good dish just lacked sparkle, so I am blaming the shop bought sauce for that.

This was a good, quick, easy recipe.  I followed to a T except for using fresh crushed garlic instead of the garlic powder.  My family enjoyed it and I will make it again.

A very good recipe for teriyaki chicken.  All the vegetables cook down to combine with the other flavors to make a very tasty meal served over rice.  I added about 1 cup of wine to the mixture along with about 1/2 cup of low sodium soy sauce.  Thought it was going to be too salty, but turned out just about right.  Had to add a little more flour to thicken.  Very good and will make again.

This was so good!  I had to cut some things out of the recipe because my son is very picky.  So, I used chicken, one red pepper,1 20 oz. can of pineapple,  garlic powder and Kikkoman Baste & Glaze with honey and pineapple.  I will make this again and again.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I marinated the meat; I mixed the flour in the teriyaki before adding it to the wok, that way it wouldn't get clumpy. I also put some sugar in my sauce- because it seemed like all the reviews said it was salty.  I felt the sugar def. counteracted the saltiness of the teriyaki sauce.  I felt the dish needed MORE pineapple-but that’s just my preference. I added carrots for color- Loved the mushrooms- what’s great about this recipe you can add what ever you like or use what have on hand- it’s a very forgiving recipe, SO don’t be afraid to get creative! It’s a keeper… Thank you very much!

We only used .5 tsp of red pepper and it was still hotter than the kids and Ashley liked. Just leave out the red pepper next time

This was great!! I was looking for a chicken recipe for dinner tonight and came across this. It smelled delicious, I marinated my chicken for an house in the teriyaki sauce thanks to other reviewers advice, and only used a green pepper, half an onion, 2 cups fresh mushrooms (my favorite), and a cup fresh pineapple. I had a can of crushed pineapple and used about alf a cup of that juice. It turned out perfect! next time i might through in a yellow pepper too, but there was more than enough veggies. The crushed red pepper added the perfect kick! Can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow (:

Fairly good just needs less crushed red pepper for our test. Hubby said the pineapple was a little overpowering.

This is a quick and delicious recipe.  I happened to have almost 2# of chicken and used it all.  Only other change was to use corn starch in place of the flour.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and found this was so salty.  I used Kikoman Teriyaki sauce.  If I ever make this again, I will make my own teriyaki sauce with low sodium soy sauce.

We thought this was delish!  I marinated the chicken in Jamaican Jerk seasoning along with some Teriyaki sauce.  We also grilled it because I'm not a big fan of sauteed chicken.  Was very yummy...loved the kick from the red pepper!

In a hurry?  This is a great Polynesian style dish that can be on the table in 30 min.  I was worried that the chicken would be bland, but the heavy thick sauce gives it plenty of sweet flavor.  I completely omitted the crushed red pepper because I wasn't up for a spicy dish. To my defense, I make my own teriyaki sauce that is quite peppery on its own, so it wasn't completely without spice.  This recipe is definitely going to be in my regular meal rotation!

This was great! A little too spicy for our taste but still very good.  I used real garlice instead of powder. I also had teriyake glaze/baste and it was fine.  I left out the onions just because I didn't have any. I would definately make this again, but with less red pepper flakes.

This was pretty good.  I followed the recipe except I didn't add the crushed red pepper because I had a toddler eating it.  I sprinkled sunflower seeds on top to add a little crunch which was good.  Not our favourite but will probably make it again because it was really quick and filling.

I made this last night and I did marinate the chicken in the sauce for 30 min. I added extra salt and it made it salty little bit.. the sauce is salty enough you don't need to add extra salt. i added the pineapple after the dish was completely done and covered it. served it with couscous.. Have left over lunch now.. yummy

I didn't have all the ingredients and yet it still tasted great.  I served it on top of quinoa and that, I believe, added a flavor that was better than using rice.

Followed basic outline of this excellent recipe, making just a few changes for my taste and/or using what was on hand:
...added few baby carrot slivers
...used cornstarch to thicken at end of cooking
...used green onions (2/3 white, 1/3 green)
...extra red pepper flakes for heat
...used leftover cooked brown rice
...used only green and red bell peppers (no yellow)
This turned out a very delicious meal; could follow basic recipe and make many adjustments and would still turn out good.

Wow, this really blew me away. It's taste and consistency reminded me very much of what you would find at a restaurant, or one of those pre-made meals that you make at home-except tasting extremely fresh with no odd, preservative type after tastes. 
This recipe made a lot, way more than just my husband and myself could finish, even the left overs! I think that next time I cook this for just the two of us I'll split it in half. I definitely recommended this recipe to friends and family though.

I am a new bachelor, and am learning to cook at the first time @ 50 via this website.  Made this recipe this past weekend - it is INCREDIBLE.  For those with a sensitive stomach, halve the garlic powder and crushed red pepper - otherwise this recipe is fantastic - and I plan to make for other friends this weekend!

Way too hot for me and my husband.  The kids spit it out due to the heat.  I will definitely make this again using half the crushed red pepper.  I loved the pineapple, and will use the large can next time.  Overall, I really liked the consistency and will try this one again with the above changes..

A nice, basic recipe. I used a thick teriyaki so I only needed about 3/4 tablespoon of whole wheat flour. I used 3 cloves of garlic and red onions. It turned out quite well.

So I was looking for a sweet and sour recipe and found this instead and I was so pleased with the results! I followed the recipe for the most part by i did substitute corn starch for the flour and I added 3/4 of a 20oz. can of pineapple and used the rest for my kids to eat on the side. Two thumbs up!

Love this recipe! Have made it twice now. Healthy changes: 1. Drained and rinsed pineapple to lessen sugar content. 2. Used almond flour. 3. Added 2 cups of bok choy.

I made this last night for dinner, it was great. I made a few changes myself. 
I took 2Tbsp cornstarch, 3tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp curry powder, and 1/8tsp cumin and placed in a bag and coated the chicken before frying. 
I added zucchini to the veges, served over rice, this was a great dinner. It was spicy and sweet.

This was really tasty but a little too spicy for our taste.  Next time I will use less red pepper flakes.  It is pretty time consuming to do all this slicing but once that is done this recipe goes together very quickly.

I followed the recipe exactly only added fresh snow peas because my husband loves them I did use fresh pineapple as it was really ripe and needed to be used! Excellant easy recipe my family loved it over rice will make this often.

A wonderful recipe; fresh, nutritious and very tasty.  I too used corn starch and added some snow peas, but that was it in terms of making any changes.  For the reviewer who said she'd like more sweetness, don't add more teriyaki sauce as that will just add a salty flavor; add some additonal pineapple juice.  Great recipe; thank's.

Definately cut back on the teriyaki sauce, used 3/4 cup of Yoshida's gourmet sauce instead.  Also used minced garlic instead of powder (3 medium cloves).  My wife does not like hot seasoning, so left out the red pepper.  Otherwise a redoable recipe.

Was not for us. Followed exactly as directed. I don't know what the overpowering taste was in it but I could barely get past it. We did eat it as it was not inedible but will not make again.

Very tasty!  I made the exact recipe, except cut down the red pepper to a 1/2 teaspoon.  It's very flavorful and, if you use the right teriyaki sauce, it's also Weight Watcher friendly.  Two thumbs up--I'll be making this again!

I expected this to be sweeter than it was, but all we could really taste was the teryaki - didn't really taste the pineapple at all and we used more than listed.  Quite disappointed - we won't make this again.

I have made this twice now and loved it both times. We eat it over Chow Mein noodles. I am a vegetarian so I make a portion of it without the chicken and my boyfriend eats it with the chicken. It is excellent.

This was a delicious, fast recipe which I was able to use up some extra items in my fridge.  I made the recipe as printed, but also added some fresh sprouts that we had sprouted ourselves and needed to use, some extra fresh pineapple and served it over some leftover rice pilaf which had some peas and carrots in it.  Just perfect and soooo delicious!

This recipe was good, but I left out the green pepper & added broccoli & sugar snap peas.  It's a pretty versatile recipe & you can add & delete veggies to your taste.  Also, I used fresh pineapple, but served it on the side so people could add however much they wanted.  It's actually fine without the pineapple, too.

Quick and flavorful. I used crushed garlic and sauteed it along with the onion, before cooking the chicken. I used soy sauce instead of teriyaki; 1 cup is way too much, it should be cut to 1/3 cup. And since my family loves pineapple, I doubled that. Served it over rice, and the family really liked it.

I think it would work better if you either use less teriyaki sauce or drained the pineapple juice. I found the sauce to be a little thick. I did include maybe a 1/4 cup of chicken broth when cooking the chicken. But I don't think that made it overly saucy. 

Personally, I will next try this by first draining the pineapple chunks. I might even wait to add them until perhaps a few minutes before the rest is cooked rather than all at once. Saute the onions as well.

Made this recipe exactly as written, verdict around here...husband liked it, but didn't care if I ever made it again.  Me, way too salty.  I can't stand salty, so very sensitive to it.  Maybe a little less teriyaki or a little more pineapple?  Don't know!  Thanks for sharing, though.

This is one of my favorite stir fry meals.  You can stir in any veggies you like and it always turns out.  My favorite is the onions, peppers, a little celery, and sugar snap peas.  (I usually leave out the mushrooms).  I also use fresh pineapple and stir in a little orange juice since the recipe calls for a can of pineapple undrained.

This was okay. Nothing really special. I'm asian and making stir fry meals is a normal thing. This one didn't stand out to me compared to the many other recipes I have in my book. I used corn starch instead of flour. I love vegetable in my stir fry so I added many other veggies to the dish. I will make this again if I'm in the mood for something sweet.

Easy, tasty, but salty.  Next time I will buy a lower sodium teriyaki sauce.

Way too salty!  I could tell there was a good flavor underneath all the salt though.  Next time I'll try the low sodium Teriyaki sauce and maybe even a little less Teriyaki.  It was a very easy recipe though.

Absolutely delicious. I halved the recipe, served over white rice and it was great. Will not be adding the flour next time, and more pineapple.

Super easy and flavourful. We loved it...might cut down on the crushed red pepper next time as it had quite a bite to it. Didn't add the flour because I used fresh pineapple and only added a little bit of juice that I had in the fridge, so it was thick enough...YUMMY!

Easy and a hit with everyone in the family.  I did have to dial back on the crushed red pepper for my kid that's not too hot on hot foods, but it's still delicious!

Better than going out to eat. Very yummy. I did not use the flour or pepper flakes. Without the flour the sauce is thin but if you let it sit for 10 min before serving its just right.

I was only making this for 2 so eliminitaed the green and yellow bell pepper. This was very good but way too salty. I will use less teriyaki next time or low sodium. I used 1/2 tsp ground red pepper and it was still pretty hot. Will use 1/4 next time. I will make again with adjustments.

I only had 3/4 cup of Teriyaki Sauce on hand and almost 2lbs of chicken and found this dish to be very, very salty. Next time I will use 1/2 cup of Teriyaki sauce and add ginger.

Very good and very easy!!!  I served over brown rice, and added in a little more flour to thicken.  The crushed pepper gives it a zing, and that is a good thing!

I did this per recipe but read the reviews before hand and used the corn starch instead of flour, the whole family thought this was awesome.  It is definitely a repeat meal, it is so easy to prepare and soooo tasty.  Thanks for e-mailing me this as a daily recipe, like I said this is a totally awesome dish.

I tasted the sauce as I was cooking this and the red pepper made it too hot. We tried it anyway and to our surprise the pineapple offset the heat for a wonderful flavor.

I grilled the chicken on my gas grill to avoid additional fats. This will be a regular dish in our house.

i tried this one last nite and it was terrific. The only changes i made were that i baked the chicken beforehand and then diced it for the wok, i don;t believe it made any difference. I added green onions to the recipe and used slightly less teriyaki to make it less sweet. great recipe thank you my wife wants it again.  real soon she says , yes ma'am.

Make sure you use a (teriyaki) sauce that you like. I used up the last of an old bottle, and it really put a damper on what would otherwise have been several excellent meals.

Thought my husband and I would love this as we love Chinese food.  However it was so salty that we could not eat it.  The only thing I can figure is the teriyaki sauce wasn't low sodium.

This recipe was delicious - like having Chinese takeout!  My one star reduction is because it is WAY too salty as written (in my humble opinion).  Having read other reviews, I made it with 3/4 cup teriyaki and added water as well, but it was still too salty.  
I recommend trying 1/2 cup teriyaki and 1/2 cup water instead, adding more pineapple with juice too!  Still, all in all this is a great recipe that's definitely worth trying.  It's incredibly quick to make on busy nights if you cut everything up beforehand.  :)

Great stir-fry! It tasted delicious and Tte coloured peppers made it look really pretty to look at, too. I cut the recipe in half, but kept the amount of veggies the same. I also used my own homemade teriyaki sauce and used a slurry of cornstarch mixed with cold water to thicken instead of the flour. I served over brown fried rice. We'll be having this again for sure.

This was a really good dish. My husband was pleasantly surprised as he was a little skeptical on how it would taste. I think the crushed red pepper sealed the deal. I bought package asian rice instead of using white rice for a little more variety.

Very very tasty and easy. I cooked it as directed except for the addition of the flour at the end. The sauce seemed thick enough after simmering for a few minutes. Other that that it didn't need anything but a dash of salt. But beware! That crushed red pepper gives a very spicy kick!!!

This was great, very fast and delicious.  My Changes:  Left the mushrooms out, and cut the peppers and onions into 1 inch squares instead of strips.  I used a whole fresh pineapple cut up into peices, and instead of flour I mixed about 1-2 tablespoons of cornstarch into the soy sauce to thicken.  I also used a bit more red pepper since we like things spicy!

I just finished making this dish and it turned out delicious!  The only changes I made :  I used only 1 red pepper (no green or yellow) since I don't like huge amounts of peppers in my food, and I did not add the crushed red pepper (I wish I could have since I looove spicy food but unfortunately I am breastfeeding so I can't).  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out better than at a restaurant.  I am serving with Japanese sticky rice .  Can't wait for dinner!!

Very good.  I actually served it in the pineapple skin after slicing it in half long ways and carving out the pineapple to use.  Have to remove the core, of course.  A little bit of work, but it makes a nice presentation.

As with any recipe, I always find myself tweaking it a bit.   I marinated the meat for 20 minutes in a soy and sesame oil with garlic marinade.  

Started with putting the crushed garlic with red pepper flakes in oil first to season the oil.  Cooked the chicken and removed it from the pan.  Added my veggies which was comprised of orange and yellow peppers, carrots, onion, and broccoli.  Sauted them a bit before adding Kikkoman Teriyaki Sauce - this is very salty.  I cut the salt by adding half a can of the canned pineapple juice, reserving the other half for a slurry of pineapple juice and 3T corn starch.  Combined the cooked chicken for 15 minutes with the slurry and canned pineapple.  

Turned out really great.  My only suggestion is to add a touch of fresh ginger.  Served over Jasmine rice.  Yum.

Very good stir fry. I will make it again but I  will cook the sauce separate and then pour it over before serving. The  sauce was too thick and hard to stir so it stuck to the pan.

Great base meal to build off!
I added snow peas, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, and leftover asparagus. I also added fresh pineapple juice and soy sauce to the sauce base to thin it out a bit and cut the strong teriyaki flavour. Left out the flour, not needed. My boyfriend said it's his new favourite meal! Served it in the shells from my pineapple I cut up for a fun alternative to regular dishes.

This is a great recipe! I did reduce the sauce to .75 of a cup of teriyaki sauce and put less flour, but everything else was kept the same. Loved the dish, but next time i will make it a little spicier to make it more sweet and spicy to my preference.

I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day and he loved it! I did make some changes just to suit his personal taste. I used fresh pineapple rather than canned since I served it to him in the hollowed out pineapple. I left out the mushrooms and only used red bell peppers. At the end I made a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken rather than using flour. I will definitely be making this again!

This is wonderful!  For my own palette preferences and after reading reviews, I made a few adjustments. 
* Used a fresh pineapple instead of canned....I cut the pineapple so I could use it as a bowl to serve the meal in. It was a pain to scoop the pineapple out but worth it for  A BEAUTIFUL PRESENTATION!  *I used only green peppers. 
 *I marinated my chicken in Teriaki sauce for an hour or so. 
* Once it was simmering, a taste test revealed it was too salty for my liking....so instead of adding sugar like others have suggested, I added honey.  Maybe 2 tbsp.
*I felt the sauce had a decent consistency, so I added flour but only by  spoonfuls until it looked like the right thickness..  I don't think you need 1/4c.  At least I didn't....perhaps because I used fresh pineapple and didn't have he juice from the can to add to my recipe.
*Also, added a bit minced ginger root.  
*Added a bit more red pepper flakes.  Some suggested they omitted it completely because it was too spicy.  Guess it all depends on what you consider spicy but adding a tad more was a great decision.
*Served with a side of brown rice

This is a delicious meal....not healthiest but I made it for a special occasion.

The ONLY thing I feel that I could have done differently to make this tastier,  was to wait to put the pineapple chunks in...maybe simmer the last five minutes.  Couldn't taste the pineapple as it was soaked with Teriaki sauce.  So I think adding it at the end may allow the pineapple flavor to stand o

Pretty good.  Chicken was very moist.  Only criticism is it was a bit salty because of the teriyaki sauce. I served over quinoa which added a nice crunch.

This was a great recipe, however I did make a few changes.  I didn't have any teriyaki on hand so I used some chicken BBQ sauce instead.  I also used chopped garlic and a little ginger too.  I also substituted the flour with chickpea flour which I use in all recipes calling for flour.  Oh, and I left out the red pepper flakes because it was for my kids.  We ate it over noodles.  Yum!

I loved this so did my family. I added more veggies also I marinaded the chicken like other users in the teriyaki sauce chicken came out good juicy. I replaced the flour with cornstarch because I have made other Chinese dinners that came out great with cornstarch instead of flour.

I made this recipe almost exactly as stated, besides changing out some of the veggies for ones that I had on hand, but kept the onion, mushroom and pineapple, and substituted corn starch for the flour.  It was fantastic.  Lots of sauce, but that makes it perfect for putting over some rice.  Simple yet declicious, I will definitely be making this again.

I made this recipe with a few changes because of what I had on hand.  I only had green bell pepper, omitted the mushroom but decided to add a few chopped carrots.  I did not chop the onion instead did thin slices. I marinated my chicken for almost 30min in lawrys teriyaki marinade and used that instead of teriyaki sauce. I did not use the pineapple juice but used more pineapples(almost the whole 20 oz can). I did not have crushed red pepper so tried with cayenne red pepper. Served this over white rice. It was very good, but next time I will only use 1/2 tsp of rep pepper.  The spice was very noticeable.  Overall good recipe, plus quick and easy.

Love this recipe, but I made minor adjustments.  I didn't want mushrooms so I added in a yellow and orange pepper. Also, I fried my chicken with flour first. I also added a half coup of brown sugar and a teaspoon of ketchup. I doubled my recipe as well by adding an additional cup of teriyaki sauce. It came out perfect. thanks so much

We really enjoyed this meal.  The flavors blended well together.  I did leave out the mushrooms, due to personal taste, so I added extra peppers and onion.  Served this over 'Paleo Cauliflower Rice' from AR.

I was out of pineapple chunks so I left them out. I couldn't find teriyaki sauce so instead I used teriyaki marinade. The sauce was thick enough so I left out the flour. After those modifications, it was still pretty good.

I made this for the first time for two picky eaters and they liked it. I used corn starch instead of flour.  I also reduced the crushed red peppers to 1/8th tsp.  we all voted to keep this recipe and make it again.

This was wonderful. I did not serve over rice, I steamed asparagus on the side. I cooked the chicken with olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter.   I only had one large green pepper.  I used fresh garlic not powder, about 2 tablespoons added at the end along with 3 tablespoons honey.   I also used some McCormick roasted garlic and herb seasoning. It was delicous. My family loved it.

Subbed cornstarch in place of flour. Also, I would recommend adding the bell peppers 5-8 minutes before done, unless you like them super soft.

We really enjoyed this but I agree that it wasn't sweet/pineapple-y enough so I doubled the pineapple w/a can of crushed pineapple(it's all I had after using the regular chunks. I completely changed the cooking order/method so my chicken wouldn't dry out. Also used 2 tbl of cornstarch mixed w/oj instead of the flour called for.

I omitted the flour and mushrooms, reduced the teriaki to 1/2 cup, reduced the crushed red pepper to 1/4 teaspoon, and added a 20-oz can of pineapple with about half the juice.  I cooked this in the slow cooker for 3.5 hours on high.  It turned out pretty good served over honey, salt and butter-seasoned quinoa and bulgar.

I didn't think this would work with potatoes and roast Veg. Turned out good indeed. I've made this with fried rice and as far as I am concerned it doesn't matter what you have with it.

although i made a few tweaks including using less pineapples and soy sauce instead of teriyaki, i have to say that this dish turned out great. i also used about a teaspoon of sesame oil to give it that special Asian flavor! i would overall give this recipe a 5 if it weren't for the tweak i made to it. :)

This was SO good and super easy. While preparing it, I thought it might need more than a teaspoon of red pepper flakes... while eating it, I found that I had thought WRONG. Needless to say, it turned out a little spicier than it probably should have been. STILL really good.

I am a firm believer that nothing can have too much sauce... until this dish.  Follow the suggestions in the other reviews to cut down on the sauce.  OR... add extra chicken and vegetables.  Next time I will add more chicken as well as water chestnuts and peapods.  This recipe was very easy and very delicious.

This was perfect. I thought the amount of sauce was great for putting over rice. We will make this again!

This dish was very good. Used crushed garlic and ginger instead of powder.  Added soy sauce, vinegar and brown sugar to the pineapple juice and used corn starch to thicken the sauce!  Also added green pea snaps cut in half. Also did not use flour. Best thing is it was quick.

This was a really good recipe - my husband isn't a big fan of onions, peppers, or mushrooms, but he cleaned his plate!  We served it over a bed of white rice.  I would've given it 5 stars, but for some reason, it came out a little too salty for us.  Will try reducing the teriyaki sauce next time perhaps.

I made this without flour too. I made it with shrimp, instead of chicken, and it was super easy and really tasty! It was a wee bit spicier than I'd prefer (I still chowed it down, but I didn't give it to my toddlers), so next time I'll use less crushed red pepper.

Wonderful! Thank you for sharing this recipe. We all loved it. Next time I think I will use chicken thighs instead of the breast just so it is a little more tender. I also added some ginger to the recipe and it was a hit.

This recipe is awesome and so versatile!  I made it using only one red bell and added sliced celery, carrots, zucchini and asparagus.  YUM!!  I also used 2 Tbsp. of cornstarch instead of the flour and it was just the right thickness for our taste.  Will definitely be making again and again!  Thank you!

This recipe was so fast and easy. I went from not knowing what to fix for dinner to dinner on the table in 40 minutes. The flavor was fantastic ! I omitted the mushrooms because they are not on my list of favorites. My husband loved it ! I will be making this again.

Made this exactly except omitted crushed red pepper (didn't have any), used one fresh clove garlic & added handful of snow peas in the pod. The red pepper would have given this a good kick. I probably won't make this again...terriyaki is expensive here and I wouldn't want to use a whole cup for a 'so-so' recipe.

SOOO delicious!!  I made dinner a tiny bit early because we have ice skating lessons tonight - now it's just sitting on the stove calling my name... I keep sneaking bites of it - hope we have enough left at dinner time!  I'm so excited - I'll add some cayenne pepper to my serving, since I have 2 little ones that will eat it - that will make it extra wonderful.  Great recipe!

This was delicious, just a little spicy for mine and my husband's taste, and I cut back on the crushed red pepper from what the recipe called for knowing that we don't like really spicy food.  Will definitely make this again, but with a lot less crushed red pepper.

Great...followed the recipe.  Had fresh pineapple though since it was already in the fridge.  Also, only had a little teriyaki, so made my own from allrecipes.  Hubby really enjoyed!

This was pretty good.  Fiance doesn't like peppers so I left them out completely.  Only had a 16 ounce pineapple can on me so used that with all the juice.  Came out a tiny bit thin, probably because of the extra liquid.  Marinated the chicken for about 30 minutes.  I also threw the onions, chicken, and mushroom into the pan at once, and when the chicken was still slightly undercooked, I then threw in the sauce and pineapple and let it simmer.  Overall, will make again!

This was an excellent recipe! I did make some small adjustments to the recipe. I only used green bell peppers and used a 20 oz. can of pineapple instead of 8 oz. I also added broccoli. I did not use the mushrooms. Also, instead of using flour, I used corn starch to thicken as I eat gluten free! I can't wait to make this meal again!

This recipe was soooo good! Absolutely delicious!! I added some peeled carrot and fresh chopped ginger also and used fresh pineapple. I served it over white rice. My 12 year old son really liked it also and continues to ask when we will have it again! So easy to make too!!

The fresh vegetables were great, but the teriyaki sauce and red pepper were a little strong for us.  Next time I will use less sauce.  This is a good basic recipe that you can easily suit to your family's taste.  It makes a lot so you can have plenty for leftovers!

I made as the recipe states, and it turned out wonderfully. Nice and spicy and very flavorful. The only mistake I made was that I bought Teriyaki baste instead of sauce, but it still tasted very good. Next time I will try it with the sauce and see how it differs.

This recipe is easy and fun to prepare. I added summer squash to the recipe adn used cornstarch instead of flour. The taste was great. I can't wait to make this for my friends.
