This was a fantastic recipe!  I made it for a pot luck breakfast at work.  Most of my co-workers are vegetarians so I just omitted the bacon, they loved it.  I recently purchased the silicone muffin pans, this was definitely the ticket. They worked perfectly!  I made the recipe exactly as described and it was delicious!  I will definitely make this again. Thank you for the recipe.

Tasty dish.. easy to make. I couldnt fit the full amount of eggs, so be aware you may not need this many.  lo, I dont keep heavy cream in the house and I wasnt going to buy a carton for one teaspoon, so I used milk.. Came out fine

I followed  the directions  but doubled  the recipe. I used bacon  and sausage with  24 eggs  and  filled  12 deep muffin  tins ,not cup cake tins. Turned out  great.  Wife and kid's loved  it and now they  have  yummy easy  breakfast  for  the coming week. 
Will be making  again  soon  and forever.
thanks,  Todd, the weekend  breakfast  cook.

Easy! Would leave out the potatoes. I used sausage instead of bacon. Can mix and match depending on what ingredients you have. Very easy, and good

Next time I would use two less eggs.  The egg batter was a lot for 12.  Excellent breakfast idea! Easy and healthy

My toddlers loved this! Gobbled it up, veggies and all. Even cold  the next day. Great recipe as is, but you can change it up to include or exclude pretty much anything you have on hand. will keep this in tegular rotation in our house.

Awesome idea. After reading reviews I used extra tater tots and smushed them down and used it as a base which crisped nicely. For ease I used real bacon bits and pre cooked sausage crumbles. Mixed in onion & pepper without cooking first. Skipped the shrooms & SD tomatoes.

This turned out delicious! I don't like anything premade so instead of tator tots I boiled a few potatoes and added them instead because I do love potatoes. Also, needed to use up some left over feta cheese so used that instead of the cheese recipe called for.  Will definately use this recipe again as it was awesome!!

I did remove the mushrooms for dietary reasons.  It was ok.  A little on the bland side.  I will probably try one more time using items that I normally put in an omelette.  They did reheat in the microwave nicely, so  that was nice as they were perfect for taking to work.  Also, it took much longer to make than it says.  About 45 minutes before putting it in the oven.

Great idea for a dish. Layering order was bad— The stir fry stuff turned out amazing, smelt Great, then became crusty dark flavorless unknown stuff,crisped at the bottom of the cupcake. I didnt have milk or cream so not sure if that fixes the prob. Mine tasted mostly like potato and egg (still yummy), though I was excited about the stir fry meat-veggie mix before it became black crust :-(  Next time I’ll put potato on bottom (it can probably handle crustifying better), then the veggies, cheese, and egg mixture on top.

Sorry, I did not care for this recipe. I thought these were dry, with very little flavor. Will not make again.

These were pretty good. I cooked them a few minutes too long and the eggs got dry. I also expected them to be more flavorful. I'd make them again, but use more seasonings and Les time. Portability and nutrition are plus factors here, also the fact you can just heat them up the next AM for convenience.

This recipe was yummy!!! I modified it quite a bit as I didn’t have tater tots. I used spinach, mushroom and Turkey bacon instead and they were amazing! I will tell you investing in cooking spray is a must! I used olive oil and my pan is still soaking days later!

This recipe will be in the regular rotation.  I excluded the bacon and the cheese, and used sweet potato tots instead of regular tater tots.  It turned out well.  I made the recipe on Sunday and packed the egg cups for breakfast during the work week.

I made these mini potpies for my best friend who under went arm surgery yesterday. I wanted something small and easy. Mission accomplished. She loves them. It was a huge success. I think everyone should try this recipe. I did use sausage instead of bacon because she can't eat the bacon. Made them even better.

These were great.  I put a few different ingredients in various cups.  Awesome idea.
