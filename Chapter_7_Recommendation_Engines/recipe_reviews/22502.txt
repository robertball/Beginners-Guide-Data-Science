These were just not a hit at our house.  The frosting is really good, but the brownies were a little disappointing.  They ended up dry with very little flavor and even the very yummy frosting was not enough to save them.

Not too impressed with this recipe.  The brownie was rather dry and much too cake-like for our liking.  Not very chocolatey either.  The icing was really goopy and runny.  I'll keep looking.
