Loved this recipe.  I won first prize with this at the church cook off.  It is going to become one of my "go too" pot luck recipes.

This is just as good as everyone says. It's easy and would be a hit at any gathering. I used chopped bitter chocolate chips on top.

The chocolate lasagna was  a big hit! With both kids & adults. Have to make 2 so can send home  one for the grandkids. Will try adding chocolate pieces to the filling next time
