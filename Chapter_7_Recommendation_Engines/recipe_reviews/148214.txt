This recipe is absolutely fabulous! Just a few suggestions.. We used A LOT less olive oil for the dressing to take the calories down. Next time I make this, I will omit the kumquats and just squeeze some fresh orange juice over the spinach instead. The kumquats did give it a nice hint of sweetness, but it was a lot of work to peel and cut them. The second night we had this, for leftovers, I cut up the swordfish and mangoes and tossed everything together and it was much tastier (and I didn't think it could get tastier!). I liked having all of the flavors mixing together. My husband and I couldn't stop talking about how yummy this was. We will make it again and again. I highly recommend it!!

This recipe was great! I cooked this the other day for my dad and fiancee and they loved it too.  One thing I did change was I just used my own bought raspberry vinaigrette dressing and we loved it!

The only other thing I MIGHT change would be to marinade the swordfish overnight or a few hours before hand.  I will have to figure out what type of marinade to use to mesh with the mango, spinach, and vinaigrette dressing.  I was thinking soy sauce based
