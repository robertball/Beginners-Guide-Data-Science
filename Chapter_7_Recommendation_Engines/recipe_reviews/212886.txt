Good! A nice balance of flavours.   Second time round I added 1 clove of very finely diced garlic, which I thought worked well.

I have an Indian friend who used to cook lunch for me and I love her food!  I really loved her yogurt Raita.  This recipe is so good! Just like hers.  The only thing I did differently is I added tomatoes to it because she always does. Yummy, so refreshing!

Fantastic - made with Athenos strained Greek-style yogurt (extra thick and rich even though it's fat free), added tomato and purple onion - truly wonderful! Thanks so much!

Very good recipe! Tastes very similar to what we get at our favorite Indian Restaurant in Los Angeles. Some changes: I didn't add the chile pepper, since I would like to keep the yogurt mild. Also, I didn't seed and dice the cucumber, I just used a grater to julienne it and stopped to the point where I would reach the seeds.

This rendition of raita is perfect. I didn't change a thing. I thought the salt would be too much, but it was just perfect.

i loved this! i love the flavor of cilantro, but sometimes find it overpowering. it's definitely not overpowering in this, but the flavor comes through - it's a perfect ratio. i found it a bit salty, but i think i'm on the low end of salt tolerance, so i think it's just the right amount of salt for most people.

This was OK, but a little bland. I'd make it again, but would probably add some mustard seed or something with a little zing.

This is very good -- I adapted it to what I had on hand. I used Greek yogurt, Persian cucumbers, and a half a bunch of cilantro, and insead of chiles, I used about a half cup of chipotle salsa that I had. I blended the cilantro, yogurt, and salsa in the blender til smooth, and mixed it with thinly sliced cucumbers. Persain cucumbers are seedless. It was incredibly good. Sort of Indian-Greek-Mexican!!

Delicious! My husband especially loves this. I don't think he will ever eat curry again without it! I love that it uses some fresh herbs (I added cilantro and a bit of dill). In one preparation I omitted the pepper (for my kids sake) and it was still delicious. I think half a teaspoon of salt per 2 cups of yogurt is plenty. Thank you for such an easy recipe!

Perfect. You can leave out the chili  pepper on part of it for the kids if needed. I put in about half the salt and it was great.

This was so refreshing! I aimed at making this as colorful as I could. I added a bit of red onion, yellow bell pepper, and a tomato ripe from the garden. I didn't have cilantro at hand so I used fresh parsley. I also used 1/3 of a pickled jalapeno, since I had no fresh peppers on hand. I was delighted with the outcome - I used Greek yogurt, which of course, is pre-strained and makes for a thicker, creamier Raita. I paired this with a sweet lamb curry I found on this site. Great combination!

Absolutely fantastic.  Halved the recipe, otherwise didn't change anything. This one's going into the permanent rotation.

Personally I think this would be better pureed and served as a dipping sauce.

Terrific without changing a thing. Well, I did make just half the quantity. Exactly what we needed to cool down Curry Stand Chicken Tikka Masala from this website.

I didn't peel my cucumber but I did seed it. Used  food processor from there out and it was so easy! I didn't have a green chili but added a touch of cayenne in its place.
Hubby thought it was a bit sour, but he's not used to Greek yogurt and such. I thought it was an AMAZING, quick and easy tzatziki substitute.

This is my favorite thing to get in a Turkish or Greek place! I always knew it was yogurt and cucumber but I didn't know what else made it so good! One of the best things I like to eat is this yogurt with rice! So I made it with chicken and rice and I made a mango salsa to go with the chicken! It was great! A perfect light summer meal. The yogurt was great!

Cool and refreshing.  Use Greek yogurt and the raita won't become runny.  I added a chopped tomato (after removing the seeds) and a little minced onion in place of the chile pepper
