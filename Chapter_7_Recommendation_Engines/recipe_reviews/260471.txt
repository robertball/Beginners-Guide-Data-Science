Made as written except that I didn't need the water. Great breakfast for dinner recipe! Only let the eggs go for as long as the recipe states. They still looked too runny to me so I let them go longer and they ended up overcooked. Lesson learned. I would double the paprika next time but that is the only change I would make.

I have been making this for years. I have used sausage or ham instead of bacon, they both work well. On some occasions I have pre-boiled the potatoes so that they only need to cook bit and brown. Love you Dorinda! You are the bomb!

I made this for two persons using just one med. potato but since we always two eggs for breakfast I basically kept everything else the same.  I do however, dice my potatoes and soak in water over night, dry carefully in the morning and fry as the recipe directs.  If you don't, the potatoes stick. This way I am able to use a regular non stick pan. I don't use the garlic but I do experiment with different cheeses.

I love this recipe.  I had some leftover steamed broccoli from the night before & tossed that in when I added the eggs.  Great for a quick Sat.  am brunch.

I followed the directions to the T, only omitting the green onions and smoked paprika because I didn't have them. Still delicious, easy and about an hour of prepping and cooking. I am prone to distractions and even though I browned the onions instead of taking them to translucency, it made no difference in taste. My kinda recipe. ;) And the final review came from my picky 16 yr old son who knows my cooking abilities - "this is really good mom!" LOL Thanks for helping me pleasantly surprise him. Thumbs up!

I really liked this recipe. My only change was to add a bit more water than the recipe calls for to make sure I could get the potatoes soft enough. I reduced the recipe for 2 people and used 1/4 c of the cheese and decided to leave the garlic out. It was just perfect! My tip would be to lower the temperature to low after adding the eggs to let the eggs cook slowly until set.

Just made it.  just the right amount of ingredients.   best done in a well seasoned cast iron skillet.  So good I ate half of it without realizing that I ate two pounds of this stuff.  It will send you to heaven if you are not too careful.

I used sweet potatoes instead of white potatoes. Also added sliced mushrooms.  Was very good.  Cooked about 6.5 minutes after added eggs.  They were just the way I like them

Loved this but made it to my specifications and for one person. I hate runny eggs so I cooked them as if scrambled. Didn't use green onions as I do not like them. But overall it was very tasty.

Made this for dinner tonight as my son goes into work on night shift and I wanted him to have something "breakfasty" when he woke up.  Thought it was very tasty.  Made it a bit differently that the recipe instructions.  I pushed the potato mixture out of the way and scramble the eggs then, mixed everything together including the bacon and topped it with the cheese.  Will definitely make it again.

I made this this morning for brunch and it was delicious.  I always bake my bacon in the oven but still used some of the bacon grease to fry the onions and potatoes.  I like the idea of putting 1/4 cup water and steaming the potatoes.  I removed the lid after about 10 minutes and crisped up the potatoes.  I did scramble the eggs before pouring in, we just like it that way.  I really enjoyed this and will make it again.

Very tasty dish. I followed the recipe with no changes except I added a small amount of Olivio to each egg well to keep the egg from sticking to my pan.  

Filled our bellies just fine for our Sunday morning breakfast!

I think this can become a 5/5 for me with a few tweaks, namely there were too much potatoes/not enough eggs, so I'll probably use two potatoes instead of 3 and see how that does.

Everything you could want for a breakfast, hearty and delicious.  I used red potatoes because that's what I had on hand and microwaved them first instead of boiling them.  They came out perfect in individual cast iron skillets.

When I made this I did not add water but I used a little butter to help the potatoes crisp up. I also used Vidalia onions instead of green onions. My husband loved it and requested it again.

It was a little time consuming but worth the wait. Delicious. Next time I will make it in cast iron so I can have the cheese melt to a golden brown.

The only change I made was I cooked the potato for a short time in the microwave before adding it to the skillet to steam; it cuts down on the cooking time.  Otherwise, this was very good and I will make it again.

I did t have bacon, so used Adelle’s Italian style chicken sausages. As well, I added some chopped jalapeños, salt and pepper - OMG - the flavor was amazing!

An easy and delicious meal. I added an additional 1/2 cup of water to the potatoes. I also added a few mushrooms and some spinach and zucchini.

I have been making this dish for over 40 years, a change you can do is instead of bacon, use Pork sausage. Adds a great flavor change to this. Shredded Cheddar is best too.

LOVED this recipe. Made it as directed & also with “scrambled” eggs. 3 out of 4 of the people I was feeding it to... liked the scrambled eggs better, but it just depends on how you like your eggs cooked I would think. It was WONDERFUL both ways. I re-heated it  (in the skillet) the next morning with a new egg added and it was still very good. Would recommend this highly. It was easy to make too.

This is delicious, hearty, and beautiful—and the all-in-one-skillet approach makes it pretty no-fuss.
