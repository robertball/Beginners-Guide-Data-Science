Good idea, but poor execution.

20 minutes at 400F is waaay too long. Your fish will be shrivelled and dry if you do this, unless you have a very very thick cut of fish.

For a 1in cut of fish. 15 minutes at 350 is enough. Remember that your fish will continue to cook once you take it out of the oven. And you'll most likely want to let your fish cool down for about 5 minutes before you cut into the package.

Don't be afraid to bake salmon in parchment.  It's a great method for keeping your expensive fish from drying out if it's a minute or two too long in the oven.  The hardest thing to do is to judge when it's done, due to the variations in size of filets.  Mine were a little more than 1 inch thick in the largest part, and alas, 20 minutes was a tad too long.  They were still edible, and we enjoyed the combination of flavors.  Thanks for the idea!

made this last night- delicous- I added more spices >>dill and lemon pepper -- I think 15 min would of  been enough time  to bake or lower  the oven temp to 375.

The dish was amazing! My store was out of fresh basil, so I used dried basil and it tasted great! Also, I used coconut oil spray and it was perfect! I just learned about using parchment paper from a cooking demo and I will always cook my salmon this way from now on!

Truly an awful thing to do to salmon.  400 degrees for 25 minutes would turn fish into dessiccated mush.  I cannot understand why this recipe gets 4 and 5 stars, because this is truly the worst execution of this cooking method I have ever seen.

I used Dill instead of basil.  You could exchange so many herbs in this dish - dill, basil, parsley.

Wow!  Just when I was despairing that my salmon filet would spoil in the fridge, or that the luscious fresh basil I brought back from my Mom's lat weekend would get thrown away (as usual) because I kept it too long, I stumbled upon this amazing recipe.

The only modifications I made were length of cooking time (20 minutes, based on other reviews), no pepper (allergy), and lemon zest instead of lemon juice (allergy).  Oh yeah, and I sprinkled a tiny bit of garlic powder on it.  Freshly minced garlic would probably be even better.

Be sure to use only wild salmon from Alaska.  Salmon farmed in the Atlantic, whether in U.S. or Norwegian fish farms is highly toxic.

Someone should adjust the cooking time and/or temperature for this recipe; this is WAY too long and too hot for salmon; it will ruin a very nice piece of seafood.  The most it should cook is 15 minutes or so, and at 375 or 350ish to not over cook it to death geez.

Me and my partner's favorite home-made dish. I always remove the skin first, and the easiest way to do so is to thaw after freezing and slice off the frozen slab of skin. 
Always add extra lemon before and after! :)

Not bad although this recipe would be a lot more helpful if there was a cooking time suggestion for frozen fish. Other than that, this recipe is quite easy to make.

Great recipe!
I followed the recipe and added some dill and parsley.
20 min. was all it took in my oven.
The parchment paper kept the salmon moist.
My whole family loved it! We all had second servings, even the kids. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

We were out of foil, and staying at our farmhouse to "hold down the fort" during one of the snow/ice vortex episodes; I found the parchment paper from the holidays, bought for a recipe I never got to make, and looked up what I wanted to cook online with it, and the parchment/salmon recipe was right here, first in line, and it worked really well.  I added what I wanted as usual, like capers and forgot to add white wine, but actually it was moist enough to not need it as if in foil. Thank you for saving the day! This is a keeper.

When I google "salmon in parchment", I am searching for the mechanics, i.e., at what temperature for how long. I SO appreciated knowing from comments that the cooking time dried out a very expenisve fish! I cooked it for 15 minutes and it was "OK". Would have preferred it a bit rarer but certainly had I followed the recipe as is, it would have been WAY too dry. So, I have to say, even before having difficulty processing information, I read reviews, especially the negative ones, to see what others have improved upon. Although, I totally "get" that some of you prefer a review of the recipe as is. Personally, I know my and my loved ones' taste (dill for salmon over basil; white wine, and garlic, etc.), I just want to know, per my google, for how long and at what temp. I'm a creative enough chef to fix (i.e., the ingredients per taste), but I'm searching for the mechanics of a partiuclar recipe. Again, I understand totally that some want a review, fair enough, of a specific recipe with no changes.

It came out very tasty.  I couldn't find fresh basil anywhere this time of year, so I used dried basil, along with basil infused olive oil, instead of the spray. A great example of kleftiko

So Good! We loved it, and I eat lots of salmon.  It has such a good flavor, I also added sliced lemon to the table. I think next time I make it, I'll add a little garlic.

Fantastic!! I really think parchment is the magic touch for perfectly tender and moist baked salmon! The only change I made (based on recommendations from other reviewers) was baking for 15 minutes at 350 degrees. My filet was long but relatively skinny and some tips said that 400 degrees would torch it! So yummy and fast and simple! I’ll do this again and again and again!

Everyone loved this recipe. I wish salmon for 6 wasn't so costly as they keep clamoring for it. Will make again and again. No leftovers helps to make this cost effective!

I added powdered garlic & onion powder and used Creole seasoning in place of salt & pepper. Baked at 350 degrees about 25 minutes. Fixed more fish than recipe. Will make this one again.

I followed the recipe exactly and the salmon came out very good, tasty and  of coarse, not dry.    This is a keeper for my recipe folder.

This was so good. I didn't have fresh basil so used dried. Didn't have a lemon so sprinkled lemon juice on it. Worked fine, plus I added a little dill because we like it on fish. Baked at 375 F for 20 minutes and it was perfect. Next time I will be sure to have fresh basil and lemon.

I had never thought about cooking anything other than pastries with parchment. I substituted the basil for dill. The parchment helped it retain its moisture instead of drying out. Great recipe.

My delicious and quick fish dinner in under 5 mins is by nuking the fish in parchment in a glass dish, optional to add butter or oil,  nuke a potato and a veggie like broccoli. Done!  Better to microwave fish fillets (3 to 5 minutes) in parchment to prevent drying out, unless you want the browning and crispiness of baking;  parchment just steam-bakes the fish and takes much longer in the oven. This recipe bakes way too long and fish would be overcooked even in parchment.

Worked great.  As others have pointed out, I don't think you need to pre-cook the veggies or potatoes.

This is fast, easy and delish. Adjust time to size of filet, and I used garlic butter with the lemon and basil.
