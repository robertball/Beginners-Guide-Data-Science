Another simple yet tasty holiday gift idea. I made large batches, refilled clean wine bottles and corked with decorative stoppers. Low-cal with high-taste. Agree that a little more sugar (1Tbsp) is usually better recieved. Thanks.

I was just wondering if frozen berries can be used for this recipe?  Hard to find fresh berries at this time of teh year :)
