Had been looking for a unique twist on the typical grilled cheese. Was a little skeptical when I first read this recipe, but WOW was it good. 

I only used 1/2 T of sugar (I like sweet, and this was still enough for me) but followed everything else exactly. 

One of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten! Simple, different, delicious!!!

Swapped out the pickles for thin strips of uncured ham, used Country Kitchen Texas Toast bread.   Should be illegal to make a grilled cheese this good.... Yum!!!!

I loved this recipe. I used whipped cream cheese and a lighter calorie bread. I also used less red pepper flakes. Definitely make it again for a easy dinner.

This recipe was ok, but a bit too rich for my tastes. Next time I'll leave out the cream cheese.  The vinegar sauce is a great addition, though I'll cut back on the sugar next time.

I usually add tomato to my grilled cheese, so when I saw this my thoughts were, ok, I'll try it.  When I did and tasted, I doubt I'll go back to plain grilled cheese & tomato ever again.  Thank you for a unique recipe offering a new (to me at least) twist. I followed the recipe exactly.  yummy!
