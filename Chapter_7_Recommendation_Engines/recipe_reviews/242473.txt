This turned out great! To clarify the recipe, the 6 T sugar and 3 T cornstarch are in the crust; and the 1 c. sugar and 2 T cornstarch are in the filling. I also used 2/3 c. Meyer lemon juice instead of 1/3 c. and it was a good balance in tartness and enough filling. I will definitely make it again!

Yummy!! They were so good. I do not have to eat gluten free. I just made this because I had some almond flour that I did not know what to do with. I will never make my lemon squares any other way. I loved them so much

Increased liquid lemon by adding 1 egg, 1/2 cup sugar, I tsp cornstarch and increased lemon juice to 1/2 cup to the filling ingredients. Added 3 minutes to cook and it was awesome. Very easy to make.

This turned out really well for me! I needed a gluten and dairy free dessert so I substituted coconut/red Palm oil shortening for the butter. I would double the filling next time as I used a 9"round pan and had a lot more crust than filling. I will definitely make this again- it's already been requested!

Revamped this to be lower carb by substituting Swerve for the sugar and reduced to 5 T for the crust and just under a cup for the filling, also increased lemon juice to 2/3 cup.  My baking time for the crust was more like 15 minutes and then an additional 20 minutes once I added the filling.  I LOVED this recipe.  I made it into a tart and it was a hit with the family.

A great little recipe and easy to play around with by adding things to the crust either chocolate or some other goodies, added some lemon zest to punch up the lemon flavor.

This was disgusting. I made it to take to a Christmas party and threw the entire thing out. It was sickeningly sweet and flavorless. It probably needed about half of the sugar and double the lemon, but I'm not going to waste more ingredients trying to find the right proportions. I bake gluten free desserts all the time and this was the worst I've ever made.

Yum! I didn't have quite enough lemon, so I used lime as well. They tasted great! I brought them to work and everybody liked them. I also used vegan butter in the crust, and it worked perfectly :)

Awesome recipe! I had some lemons that needed to be used so I made these to take to a church fellowship. I made it exactly as written and used a 8‚Äù Springform pan. It turned out perfectly. Everyone must have loved them because the plate was empty in no time!

I wanted a gluten free recipe for a party so made this today and liked the idea of an almond base. However it didn't really work for me. Despite cooking the base for 18 minutes it remained limp. I like a crisp, biscuity base and in my usual recipe the base is baked for 20 minutes. The lemon layer was just OK. I won't make it again.

I appreciate the gf recipe.  It is possible my Meyers lemons made this too mild, but I would have preferred a brighter or tangier lemon dessert.  I noticed some other lemon square recipes included some lemon or orange zest.  I think I will try this again, but put some fine zest in the crust and in the custard.

I made this for work. Everyone loved it! I altered the recipe for a 13x9 pan. I doubled the crust and 2.5x the custard (based on suggestions from the other reviews). I also lightly drizzled honey on yhe crust before pouring in the custard. Yum! Yhe baking time was extended to about 25 minutes but still gooey inside. When I do it again, I'll put foil over to prevent browning and leave it in so it solidifies more.

I'm disappointed to say this was a miss for me.  Basically the proportions are wrong (which some reviewers have said).  I made it as is, except omitted the sugar in the crust as I just don't think of crust as having sugar.  I got twice as much crust as I wanted and only half as much lemon.  I think they need to be switched.  I want more of that lemon filling!  Plus, my crust didn't brown up at the full 18 mins either.  I think the crust needs a higher temperature to get crusty.  Anyways, I have another Almond Flour crust recipe from AllRecipes and an amazing Lemon Curd recipe from AR also, that I think I'll try and put together to try again.

I like the flavor of this recipe, and that is has a limited number of ingredients. I didn't like that it did not suggest using a food processor for the dry ingredients (not to much or you'll get nut butter!) and that it made no suggestions for incorporating the corn starch into the filling without ending up a lumpy mess and frothy eggs, and no suggestion to place the liquid-filled pans on a cookie sheet so they could go into the oven with ease. Also, I had to bake the crust 5 minutes longer than suggested to get it "lightly brown", which is unusual as I have a very accurate oven. The product turned out well in spite of the shortcomings of the recipe.

It turned out pretty and I added a bit more lemon juice and it was the perfect balance between sour and sweet.

Just starting to try a few gluten free recipes, more for the almond flour substitution than needing to be gluten free.  Took this to a ladies get-together and they were well received.  The recipe does come out a bit on the soft side, but didn't really mind.

This was fabulous! My husband claimed he did not like lemon anything but I made this and he devoured it! He gave it two thumbs up and asked me to make it again next week! Thanks for a great recipe. 

*Made as directed, no alterations.

I really liked these! And so did my guest.   

But, I have to say the instructions did not  make sense one review helped. I am looking forward to making them again, correctly.

The one comment....almond flour was a great base for this bar.  It gave them a nutty flavor.

Thanks for a gluten free recipe.
