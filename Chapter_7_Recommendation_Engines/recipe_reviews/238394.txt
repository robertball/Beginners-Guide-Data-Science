Nice breakfast casserole.  I wanted something simple for a work breakfast and this fit the bill.  Two things, though:  I thought this needed more crust, so I used two packages of crescent roll dough instead of one, and I didn't understand why it needed to chill overnight.  I didn't have the time to do that anyway, so I just baked.  It was almost gone by the end of the day, and I really enjoyed it, so I think it was a hit.  thanks for the recipe!

This turned out great. Made this for work - I did one sausage as written above and one veggie (sauteed garlic, onions, peppers and tomatoes). Read the review about adding 2 crescent roll packages. I split the difference and put in 1 1/2 packages in each pan and found that to be more than enough crust (any more and I feel it would have been too overwhelming). I put in about 2/3rd of the cheese in the recipe because it looked like alot but in retrospect, I should have put in the full amount. I used the cheese pizza blend package that Kraft makes and it turned out well. People at work seem to really like it judging by the lack of leftovers. I served this with mixed berries and iced coffee for a complete breakfast.

This was a huge hit for Christmas brunch with friends and family. Everyone raved about it! Here are a few tweaks I made to the original recipe: added two eggs, a little more milk, used 3/4 of the sausage and added 1/2 pkg cooked bacon, added 3/4 cup diced red bell pepper sautéed with onions in a little of the sausage grease (I put this layer of peppers/onions on top of saus/bacon mix). It cooked in the maximum time shown in original recipe perfectly. Also delicious with pico de gallo and avocado on top! DELICIOUS!!! This one is a keeper!!

Great breakfast pizza! Family hit!  I added sautéed red peppers and onions to the turkey sausage and eggs, and I topped it w/ half bacon and half turkey bacon.  I added salsa and jalapeño peppers to top my slice off and it was DELICIOUS.

This was very good and the work mates loved it.  I added a half cup of diced sweet bell peppers. I sprinkled them on between the sausage and cheese step.  I made it the night before work. After it cooled, I cut them into 12 squares and refrigerated them for the next day. Microwaved at work to reheat. Perfect!

Solid basic recipe that always turns out delicious.  Easy to customize to whatever your tastes may be.  Always a great hit at a pot luck, or makes enough to have breakfast throughout the week.

We cut this in half for the 3 of us and had leftovers to eat another day, cooking in 8x8 pan. We did sauté an onion to add in. when cutting in half, even 1 roll of crescents was too much, even though we lined the bottom AND sides of our pan.  Yummy and filling tho. Thanks for sharing.  Did not have time to make the night before, just cooked as directed when complete

Had this for a little something savory for Christmas Eve breakfast today and everyone raved!   This is versatile too, and can be made with ANY type of sausage.  It is pretty cheese heavy, but the only thing I'd change would be to add 2 extra eggs and increase the final cooking time.  It just didn't seem to have quite enough egg. Otherwise, a delicious breakfast!

I will definitely  make this again. I varied from the recipe a bit. I added a layer of sautéed mushrooms, 8oz, and a diced medium green pepper. I sautéed the pepper/ mushroom mix in a 2 tablespoons of grease from sausage and let it cool before spreading and layer evenly on to of sausage. I also put a layer of frozen shredded hash browns, 1-2 cups. Thaw hash browns and pat dry, then spread to cover as next layer. All else cooks the same. This variation is from an old pillsbury recipe I used to make years ago that had been long lost

I've made this several times using different combinations and it is delicious! I bring it to pot lucks, keeping it warm in my casserole slow cooker.  Making it overnight enhances the flavor, but it still tastes great without letting it sit overnight in my opinion.

It would have been great without any changes. I did add a little cottage cheese because several other recipes I was looking at used cottage cheese and the comments about it intrigued me. I was happy with the addition and would have been happy without.

Quick and easy. Perfect for entertaining.

I make this all the time however, I like to add sweet peppers and shredded potatoes. Also try a blend of cheeses like Colby Jack. You can also use bacon and or ham for your meat.

Easy mix!  I altered a bit, added a pound of cooked and cut-up bacon, and a can of sliced mushrooms  to the egg mixture the next day..  Added a bit of cheese to the top as well..

Everyone loved it.

Didn’t have quite enough flavor.  Maybe add a small layer of cream cheese between the crust and sausage?

I love that Pillsbury now makes the crescent roll sheet. The recipe is very easy to follow. The sheet saves you a few steps. Very tasty! Also, I peel the casing from my sausage, slice it, then cook it.

I’ve made this a few times since I discovered this recipe and it’s just delicious! I have tried it both with refrigerating the sausage for eight hours and without refrigeration and, to me, there doesn’t seem to be any difference. Great recipe and super easy to make.

I made this for a New Year's Brunch, and everyone LOVED it!  I did not make any changes to the recipe, only doubled it and two cans of crescent rolls in an 11x17 glass baking dish was a perfect amount.  I did have a secret ingredient, the "love", according to my friend...it was homemade elk sausage!  We make our own using smoky bacon chunks, pure maple syrup and spices ground together with the elk meat.  I thought about adding peppers and onions, but decided with the sweetness of the sausage, I would just make it as the recipe directed and it turned out delicious.  I will definitely make this again, and again, and again!!

Just made this, and it was great! Easy to do. I didn't have any mild cheddar on hand, so I used the Mexican cheese blend. I also used 8 eggs instead of 6. Hubby liked it too!

I made this for company.  My husband and kids liked it a Iot. I thought it was good, but I would have given it more stars if it had some other seasonings in it.  I also felt it was a little too salty, but this could have come from the type of sausage I used or from the extra cup of cheese I added.  I did add some sauteed onion and red pepper as several suggested. Overall, I would make it again, paying more attention to the ingredients that have salt.

We loved it!  Great just as it is; so many ways to customize it for individual family members, too!

Great recipe.  We added bacon and red and green bell peppers and onions.   All sautéed before mixing in.   Maybe the pork was a bit too much.  Maybe a use 3/4th of a pound.  Otherwise amazing!!

Made this Christmas morning and it was excellent. I only used 1 package of crescent rolls and it was enough crust. Will make this again as it was quick and easy!

I made this for my coworkers. I used 1 package if small turkey links, chopped, 1 1/2 cups of hash browns, cooked them w/butter & seasoned w/butter, salt & then added a little canola oil to make them crispy, added 3 mores eggs, baked for 25 minutes w/foil and then an additional 30 minutes without, just to make sure the center was done. The crescent dough didn't rise and wasn't flaky like I thought it would be, that's why I gave it 4 stars. I will probably omit the dough if I even make this again. My co-workers liked it.

Great recipe.  It goes fast though. Feed 4 adults & 2 six year olds with no left overs.

Cresent dough needs to be added in the ingredient list.  My family loved it ...and I did too since it was simple to make!
