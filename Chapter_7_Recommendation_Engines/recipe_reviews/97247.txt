I used Smirnoff Whipped Vodka in this cocktail only because that was all I had on hand. This is DELICIOUS--the measurements are perfect. I made two last night and literally had to stop myself from making a third. The whipped vodka really made this decadent.

I took the 3 cherries and soaked them in vanilla vodka for about 30 minutes. I really enjoyed this so now I have the rest of the cherries soaking in vodka so I can have a Popped Cherry anytime.

This drink is wonderfully refreshing. You really don't get too much of a cherry taste but I do think the cherry juice adds a good sweetness. I used Vanilla Grey Goose and it tasted similar to a 50/50 bar. Great! Obviously not for those who dislike sweet drinks.

This drink was good. It was a little strong at first but once the ice melted some, it was better. I would make again. I just happened to have everything on hand, so I dicided to make.

I eyeballed the ingredients, and threw in just one cherry as it was already pretty sweet from the cherry juice. This would be good with a combination of orange and grapefruit juices. Thanks!

Tastes a little like grapefruit juice was used although I used Tropicana Orange Juice.  Not sure why but still a good drink.
