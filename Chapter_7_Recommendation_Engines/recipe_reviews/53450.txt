I made this for my family Christmas gathering.  Even though I accidentally used 8 ounces of Feta cheese in the recipe, it came out great.  Everyone loved it.

I used double the amount of feta cheese and half the amount of dill and oregano, and it was very good.  Next time I will reduce the amount of green onion, as it was a little overpowering.

I just loved this recipe and it was so easy. I added chopped walnuts to the outside, creating a sturdier and more visably pleasing look.

This is a great cheese ball! I really thought it would be too wet when I was mixing it but it hardened up fine. I just put the mixture in a couple layers of saran wrap and shaped it that way. I only put in 3 T of oil and you could probably do with 1 or 2 - not sure it made much difference. I also only put in half the spice amounts and it was heavily spiced (and I like a LOT of herbs and spices)! It looked like it would be completely overwhelming with the whole amount. Also, I totally forgot the garlic - no biggie. Double the feta would have made it even better. Also, I made it a brick shape instead of a ball. After it hardened overnight, I rolled it in black sesame seeds and served it with the Townhouse Flipsides Pretzel Crackers (the best cracker discovery ever!). YUM!

I think I added too much of something, maybe it was onions and one of the herbs. It came out awful for me! I have to throw away what I made, and don't think I'm willing to try it again....

This was delicious, and it tided everyone over before our Christmas dinner.  I halved the recipe, as we only had 8 people, but kept the 4 oz. of feta.  Served with Sun Dried Tomato and Basil Wheat Thins, this was a big hit.  It almost tastes like Boursin, which is wonderful.  I loved that I already had everything to make it, and it was a cinch to throw everything in my Kitchenaid mixer and let it do the work.  This ones goes in the permanent file!

I rolled this up and made a "dirty snowball" which was surrounded with some black olive penguins (another recipe from allrecipes.com  So cute.  The feta cheese ball is delicious.  I recommend using organic cream cheese.  I think it made a difference.

I made and served this at my sister wedding reception. It was an all appetizer reception that I catered. I doubled the recipe and it made four very large cheese balls. I had to play a bit with the ingredient amounts since it is a known rule of thumb when cooking and doubling recipes the herbs and seasonings should never be doubled, but only half again as much should be used. Taste it and add more if needed, remembering that the flavors will develop and deepen the longer the dish is allowed to rest before serving. Technically I only doubled the cream cheese. After adding and adjusting the herbs, seasonings, garlic and onions I added double the amount of feta as other reviewers suggested. Although the herbs and seasoning tasted appropriate for developing flavor nicely, I felt the cream cheese still over powered the taste of the feta so I added 8 oz more. I basically used 6 times the amount of feta originally called for. This was perfect! But then I'm a true cheese fanatic! ;)  Looked so pretty on a silver platter with curly parley tucked all around it to frame it. Every one loved it!

WOW! this was fantastic!  I served this at our Labor day party and it went so FAST!  Instead of using 4 ounces of feta, I used 6, added an extra clove of garlic and for presentation, rolled it in sliced almonds. I served it with bagel chips and everyone RAVED!  super easy, inexpensive, sure to please, this will become a staple for all my parties!

Hellooooo garlic!  This Greek-inspired concoction will definitely make your breath smell, but it is delicious.  I increased the feta to 6 oz. and halved the amounts of dried dill and oregano.  It's wonderful with Staci's "Naked" sea salted pita chips.

I have made this several times and everyone loves it. I usually increase the amount of feta because my family likes lots of feta and garnish with paprika. I have frozen the second ball wrapping it in press-n-seal. You would never know that it had been frozen. Always good to have something in the freezer to pull out when short on time to take to a friend's house.

I doubled the amount of feta cheese and followed the rest of the recipe, except I put the mixture into 4 ramekins instead of making a cheese ball. I used 1 for a party and froze the other 3 for the holidays. Good and easy!

I followed the recipe just how it states - but rolled it into one long log then rolled in fresh parsley.  I brought it to Christmas dinner/brunch with a few choices of hearty crackers and out of the 4 other similiar type appetizer's it was the only one to be completely gone!  Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious! I made it for a work potluck and served it with Triscuits.  I originally intended to save one of the cheese balls in the freezer, but once tasted, it didn't stand a chance! The ball which sat overnight and came to work the next day tasted even BETTER! Don't be afraid of the dill, it's not overpowering and the oregano flavor really sends this over the top, it's awesome!

From someone who eats feta straight from the block, this was just ok. The seasonings took away from the flavor of the cheese. I prefer the Easy Cheese Ball II.

I make this for nearly every pot luck and never come home with any. It's fantastic. I don't bother making it into balls - I just put it in a pretty serving dish.   Tastefully Simple's dill dip is an easy & tasty substitute for the dill weed & oregano.

I make this feta cheese ball often and love it.  I use equal amounts of feta cheese and cream cheese and add about two cups chopped fresh spinach to it.  I get requests for this cheeseball several times each year.  Oh, it's also good to increase the oregano and dill by double.  Great served with wheat crackers.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed some of the other reviews and cut down on the onions (I used only about 4 onions) and the dill weed (I used 3 teaspoons) and I put more feta chesse than the 4 oz. This turned out great!!! My husband gave me a yucky look when I said feta ball but with everything else the feta is not overwhelming at all.  Great blend of cheeses and garlic that makes it great.

Very good!  I put less dill and olive oil than the recipe called for.  I put more feta than the recipe called for as well.   I think the onions made it a little bitter tasting, so I think I'll leave those out next time.

GREAT!  Like others, I cut the amount of olive oil to 1-2T, and halved the dill and oregano.  I used 3 garlic cloves, and thought it was a little strong, so will probably use 2 next time.  I love feta (which is why I picked this recipe) so I doubled that.  It was so good, and different from other cheese balls.  It was a big hit at the party!

LOVE oregano so this was great, good pairing with the feta.  It was a very evenly mixed ball, so you got some of everything in every bite.

I really was excited for this recipe and it was great.
I made it as it states (plus some chopped spinach) but next time I think I will sautee the garlic onions and spinach in the oil & herbs--I prefer the taste to raw garlic and I will doulbe the amount of feta--just because we love feta.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I've made this several times - garlic lover's definately enjoy it and always ask for the recipe.  People seem hesitant to try it at parties - because it's white it doesn't look like a regular cheeseball.

A nice recipe, especially after it sits for a while.  I used red onion instead of green and it was good.

This along with some crackers or bread is the perfect snack. My husband and I couldn't get enough of it. I added a little more feta and it turned out perfectly.

Ohhhh!  This was tasty!  I whipped the room-temp cream cheese on the highest setting of my mixer, then whipped in the remaining ingredients.  Rolled it in between a piece of plastic wrap into a log shape, chilled it in the fridge for a bit (it was quite soft at this point), and then rolled that in some more dill and fresh ground black pepper.  It looked beautiful and tasted even better.  Best to make this the day before serving so the flavors get to know each other :0)

Absolutely delicious.  The ladies I served it to are experts in appetizers and were impressed with the flavor of this spread. The possibily of different presentation for this recipe are endless. The flavor is perfect just the way it is.  We have adopted this one as a favorite for our regular get together and I will surely make it again. Thanks for introducing a new addition to our regular appetizer menu.

This was so  easy to make and and everyone that tasted it loved it. On Thanksgiving, I set it out as a spread for bagel crisps and crackers.  Every one loved it.  I made the remainder into a cheese ball and rolled it in chopped walnuts.  This was also well received at our church pot-luck. People asked for the recipe.  I will be making this again.  The only thing I changed was I used less dill weed and I used a 6 oz. container of tomatoe basil feta.  Thanks Kelly for such a great recipe.

This is a very pungent cheese ball. Not at all sweet like most cheese balls.  We love it. The first bite makes you think "Hmmmm" and then after the second bite we were hooked.  I think this ball tastes better the next day after making.  Thank you for a simple yet wonderful cheese ball recipe.

This was a nice surprise.  I was worried that the amount of dill would be too much, but it blended in perfectly.  I rolled the balls in a mixture of pecans and walnut pieces.  I did reduce the garlic a little and will probably reduce a little more next time, but there will be a next time !!!  I tried this with a couple different types of crackers and the winner was "garlic herb wheat thins".  I will be taking this to the next party that I attend.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This turned out pretty good - a tad salty due to the feta so I wouldn't serve it with salty crackers. It was easy to shape into balls. I even froze one ball and thawed it out a week later and it was fine. Next time I would roll it in something once it's formed into a ball to give it a more appetizing appearance...perhaps dill?

This is really garlicy and dilly. I liked it, but no one else touched it. I was really bummed. It was easy to put together. I love feta cheese and I will try this again with less garlic and dill maybe.

BTW, to add to my review, I didn't use the indicated amount of dill. In fact, I used about a quarter teaspoon...same with  the oregano.

It was VERY GOOD.

Hmm.... not my thing... and 75% of my guests somehow did not want to eat it too after I told them it's a feta cheese ball... something about feta that turns people off?  I tried it, it tasted okay - but I'm not crazy about it..

I made this for my graduation party and it was a crowd pleaser. I used garlic powder instead of cloves. Everyone was dipping crackers, chips, and veggies in it.

I brought this dish with me to a Thanksgiving soirée and absolutely fell in love with it. It was very simple to make, which is always a must for me. I even had someone ask me for the recipe! I will definitely make this again…

I did not care for it to much but everyone else at the party really liked it and asked for the recipe. Next time I will double the Feta...I bet it will better!

The only change I made was to put it in two large ramekins rather than two cheese balls.

So delish!  I used 6oz of feta & I think you'd be okay to use more- stuck to the recipe otherwise.  This would be so good stuffed into chicken breasts.  I served with sesame crackers and got great feedback.

Made for Christmas but used habanero Feta cheese. Also added one Tlb. of some garlic salt. Then rolled in roasted chopped Pecans. Was wonderful for any kind of cracker or cut veggie.

I don't like Feta cheese and freakin' LOVED this!!!  The cream cheese definitely  balanced out the flavor and prevented the feta from being too strong (in my opinion).  All my guests loved this  and my mother in law asked for the recipe!  I ate the leftovers all by myself!

Edited to add:
You can freeze this and it still turns out wonderful!

I made this for Christmas and everyone LOVED it.  I made exactly as written, and the leftover (which was not much) we used on bagels -- yummy!

I just made this for snacks tonight.  Wow!  It's delicious, and I know it'll be even better after it melds for a while in the fridge.  Very easy and yummy.  Didn't make it into a ball or log, but will serve it in a little dish.  I halved the recipe, and now wish I hadn't it's that good.  Thanks for this one.

Holy Cow! People were going crazy for this. I doubled the Feta, because I had bought a ton at Sams. I also may have "accidentally" added an extra Tbsp of garlic, because it's awesome. It was great. This is a recipe you can fiddle with because it's just so good you can't go wrong. We served it with Ritz. Also, it only made 1 Cheese ball for me. 1 big yummy cheese ball.

Very easy to make.  Tasted very good.  My ball did not stay shaped very well even tough it was refrigerated the proper time.  I put it in tinfoil and perhaps I should have wrapped it in wax paper.

I've made this recipe for parties, work functions etc.  Everytime it has been eaten up and there is always a request for the recipe.
