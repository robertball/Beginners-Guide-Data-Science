Easy, delicious, and all around awesome! I used vanilla soy milk instead and I think I'll be making this on a fairly regular basis from now on.

I substituted coconut milk for the flax milk, changed to 2 Tb of honey and 2 ripe bananas and added a half a lemon's worth of lemon juice, which brought all the flavors together nicely with some acid. Yum!

I made it with unsweetened almond milk (only 1 cup instead of 1.5), did not blend chia seeds, added cinnamon, and did not add honey or salt. It could definitely use 1 more banana! I don't think it needs the honey, the banana is already so so sweet. A great snack with so many health benefits!!

Made this recipe today.  The chef at my work cafe made something almost exactly the same last week and I have been wanting to try making it ever since.  Such a fantastic snack--and all you need is a blender.  Used 2 tbsp agave in place of honey and used 1 tsp vanilla bean paste in place of vanilla extract and full fat coconut milk instead of flax milk.  Put it in the fridge until it was more pudding-like texture then topped it with fresh chopped pineapple.  It was awesome! This recipe is delish!

I used unsweetened almond milk other than that I followed the recipe. I found this recipe to be just ok, no where near as good as other Chia pudding recipes I have tried. Also, I much prefer the Chia seeds whole not blended.

We made this with unsweetened flax milk to reduce the calorie content even lower, and it turned out great.  I like that the pudding has a chocolaty taste to it.

Super easy and yummy! I didnâ€™t feel like dirtying the blender so I just mashed up a banana. Great recipe! Thanks

My first attempt on making chia pudding. I wanted something sweet yet healthy. I read the reviews and tweaked it also. I had unsweetened organic almond milk on hand. I used 2 cups of the almond milk,  2 organic bananas and 2 tbs of raw honey. The  rest of the recipe was the same as written. After blending, it set for 4 hrs before I tried it . It is delicious with just the right sweetness for me and pudding consistency. The banana taste was perfect as well. Glad I used 2 bananas. I will definitely make it again.

Loved the fact that the chia is well-blended into the mix, will recommend it to my friends and family!

I used coconut /soy milk and two bananas. The next time I make it I want to try using white chia seeds. A co worker told me it looks like dog vomit ... Funny... It doesn't taste like it

This was my first time making chia pudding and I was very pleased! I didn't have flax milk available, so I used unsweetened coconut milk instead. I also preferred to use a tablespoon of Sugar in the Raw instead of honey. It still came out great! I think the only thing I would do differently next time is use a little less vanilla extract and a little more banana. As much as I enjoy vanilla, I liked the banana bread taste best :)
