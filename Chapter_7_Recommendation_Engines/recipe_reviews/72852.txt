My whole family loves peanut butter and I was quite excited to try this recipe.  Unfortunately, it is not very good.  Weird texture and after taste (I think that is from the non fat dry milk powder.)  Anyone have a better recipe?

This recipe made me never want to buy store-bought ice cream again.  I actually skipped the cooking step and used an electric mixer to blend the dry milk and other ingredients until dissolved.  It worked out great.  YUMMY!

This was wonderful and creamy!  For those who have texture or issues with freezing, try combining whipping cream and whole milk (D) rather than powder.  This will give you the texture, taste, and freeze you desire.

This is one awesome recipe for people who love peanut butter! Or peanut ice cream. Very good with chocolate truffle topping. The only reason I give it four stars is because I made one major change and that is I used whipping cream instead of milk. This made the mixture come out nice and extra creamy before I even put it into the ice cream maker. I followed the recipe directions exactly as is otherwise. At first I thought the ice cream wasn't coming together (like other reviewers stated) but it came together pretty well, like a soft serve. After sitting in the freezer for a couple hours it hardened nicely. Just the way I like my ice cream, solid and creamy.

This was my first time making ice cream. I scaled it down to 4 servings because my ice cream maker is small (it could have held 6 servings but I was playing it safe) and it turned out great.  Everyone who ate it loved it.

Absolutely DELICIOUS! Like a couple of the reviews, the ice cream didn't completely freeze in my maker, but after storing it in the freezer overnight, it was the creamiest and best ice cream I've ever made. My husband is a huge peanut butter fan and he loved it! I'm sharing this recipe with friends.

We loved this recipe.  My husband said it tasted like the inside of peanut butter cups.  Next time I make it it, I 'm going to add chocolate chunks.

The ice cream did not freeze in my freezer.  After 2.5-3 hours it was still very liquidy.

This recipe never froze in my ice cream maker, and it had a strange, kind of grainy texture as well.

This is really good and very easy to make in the blender.  I substituted whole milk for the dry milk, and it's excellent - better the next day, as others mention. Thanks!

This is the best texture of homemade ice cream that I have found so far.  Drizzled with Hershey's chocolate syrup was divine.  Tonight I will make it again and let it accompany my homemade brownies!!!  A Chocolate Peanut Butter Lover's Delight!!!!

Very good!!! Easy to make and tastes yummy! I followed the advice of previous reviewers and mixed the ingredients with a blender instead of cooking it... turned out perfect!

I substituted almond butter (just plain ground almonds) for the peanut butter and it was delicious with bits of almond in it.  The flavor was more mellow than it might have been with peanut butter.  If I wanted the real peanutty kick, I'd stick with old fashioned peanut butter.  Very good recipe!

I also mixed it in my mixer and it turned out perfect! My husband loves peanut butter ice cream and this was his favourite ever. I found it made a lot and I had to make it in two batches, so next time I'll probably cut it down to 2/3 or so.

The taste of this recipe was great.  Unfortunately, like a couple other reviewers, mine never froze.  I tried it twice, no luck either time.  I'll probably try it one more time as I really WANT it to work.

This ice cream is very creamy and very tasty! I also mixed it altogether in my mixer, like another review suggested, rather than making it on the stove. Turned out fine. Make sure you whisk it before pouring it into your ice cream maker as contents will settle while in the fridge. I made it to layer in an icecream pie (with chocolate icecream as the other layer) drizzled with chocolate sauce!

yum!  I cut the cream in half and substituted with regular milk.  It was still very successful.
