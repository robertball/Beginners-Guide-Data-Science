Great recipe! I have since used this in a single crust and on top added a struedel topping with oats, brown sugar and butter! Put a little french vanilla ice cream on top - SO GREAT! GONE! :)

Instead of using store bought apple filling I made my own. Even so this recipe was easy and added a nice touch to everyday applepie.

This was ok. The flavor wasnt out of this world like I thought it would be with the rave reviews this recipe has gotten. Probably won't make this again!

Wonderful twist on the everyday apple pie. I used my grandmother's home canned apple pie filling, and added nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon and some lemon zest to the cream mixture. I made two of these pies and both were demolished instantly!

I really wanted to like this pie. I hate leaving bad reviews but no one finished their piece. I think it would be much better with homemade apple filling. Didn't seem to be enough of the cream part of the pie to go around. It just all had a weird texture and the flavor was just off.  Which could have been the apple filling I used. Sorry.

I accidentally mixed the lemon juice in with the apple filling instead of the cream cheese mixture, but it was still very good!!!
