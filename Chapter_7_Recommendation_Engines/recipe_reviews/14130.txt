Great recipe! I have an Indian friend who gave me a couple of suggestions. I added 1/4 cup of frozen peas, then add a few strands of saffron to the top. Cover and steamed for about 5 minutes. Was awesome! Thanks for the recipe!

One of our standby recipes now!  I actually use a tablespoon of the cumin seed because we like the flavor so much.  The key is to add a good half teaspoon of salt at least, and then the flavor is to die for.  Adding garlic and onion to the oil would be a plus!  I usually use chicken or vegetable broth instead of water in this recipe.  All of these things punch up the flavor and then it isn't bland at all.

Nice suttle twist to plain rice.  I used powdered cumin and cooked in a rice cooker. Will probably make again.

Wonderful, easy recipe.  I served this with the Chicken Tikka Masala recipe on this site and it was a perfect combo.

BAsmati Rice is drier than Jasmine and the cumin being a bit hard plus the dry rice didn't do much for me.

Cumin adds a very nice flavor to the rice.  Was nice served with slow roasted chicken.

This rice was great with the Chicken Tikka Masala recipe also listed on this site.  Perfect accompaniment and the rice was yummy all by itself as well!

Lots of nice flavor in this dish. I used Basmati rice and it turned out perfectly. I served this with Middle Eastern Cumin Meatballs and it was a great pairing. I'll definitely fix this again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This was too bland for me.  I did use cumin powder instead of seeds, that may have made a difference.  I ended up adding salt and garlic powder which helped.

Meh. This wasn't bad, but not "great" either. Plain jasmine or basmati rice would complement an Indian meal just as well (sorry!). I could barely detect the presence of cumin in this. Jasmine rice is aromatic to begin with - and that's the prominent flavor I picked up (i.e. that of the rice itself). All in all, I'm glad to have given your recipe a try, but unfortunately, it's just not for me. Thanks anyways, MEDHALEE. :-)

Fine, but even with twice the cumin seeds the flavor was too mild. I would add cumin powder in addition and I'll try some of the other additions the author suggested.

A quick tip to add more punch to the cumin rice is to add a few drops of lemon juice before covering the pot (ie before the rice has been cooked). That splash of zest is especially refreshing.

I really liked it. I used coconut oil since that is what I had in hand. The first time I cooked it, it was very good. The second time, I used basmati rice and added a pinch of cardamom and it was out of this world.

I didn't have jasmine rice so I used basmati instead.  The result was both aromatic and flavorful.  The key with basmati rice is the "rice to water" ratio... just follow the guidelines for the brand of basmati you have and you should be fine.  I made this with Chicken Tikka and Naan recipes from All Recipes and my hubby couldn't stop raving about the entire meal!!!...lol.

It was just YUMMY. The only changes/additions I made was instead of water I used chicken broth and tossed in a handful of frozen peas. It was tastey. I used it as a side dish to BBQ spare ribs and steamed carrots. I love cumin so this was really flavorful. I will make it often.

Absolutely what I was looking for!!  I was so excited when I took the first bite.  I added turmeric to the rice water while it cooked, so it gave it a nice yellow colouring :)  Thank you!!

I served this with Indian butter chicken and it was really good. I used ground cumin instead of the seeds because it was all I had and I think I will continue to make it that way. The only thing I didn't like was that usually I rinse my rice to clean it before cooking and since this recipe fries the dry rice in oil I wasn't able to.
