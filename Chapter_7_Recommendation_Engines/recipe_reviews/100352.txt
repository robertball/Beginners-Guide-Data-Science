This was great!  I used two cans of crab meat.  The only thing I might do different is to make it in individual dishes.

this is a tough one for me to rate as we really liked it in the end...but that involved a lot of changes...some minor and some major. First the minor changes. Instead of ll mayo I used half mayo and half sour cream. Personally I just think mayo is too sweet for my tastes. The mushrooms: I used fresh portebellos that I sauteed up...so they probably had more flavor than the canned ones. Spinach: I used 16 oz as I had  a one pound bunch of fresh spinach from the market. I cooked and drained it. HERE is where the folks that got runny sauce probably ran into trouble. Spinach is mostly water/it shrinks a lot/a lot of water comes out of it with cooking. Weather using fresh or frozen...it's really important that it is drained well before putting it in a sauce....not just drip dry....you need to SQUEEZE the water out of it.....or else yes....it will make stuff watery. I left the boiled eggs out as I just personally hate hard boiled eggs. I used 3/4 cup of cheese since that is what I had on hand/just tossed it all in. The major thing to me is the spice. It ended up bland and I added more spices that majorly amped up the flavor: 2 tsp of Old Bay plus 1/8 tsp of red pepper flakes.

I made this dish for my family. Everyone raved over it. The only thing I didn't do was put in the mushrooms. I added another 1/4c of Swiss cheese on the top. It was really good.

Made as written but used fresh mushrooms. 
Good basic recipe but a bit bland. Will add Old Bay seasoning or maybe Tony Chacheres next time I make.

I was a little disapointed because I was expecting a "WOW".  It wasn't great but wasn't bad.  It was okay. I also used 1/2 fresh crab meat and 1/2 artificial.  I have to say that I think the artificial tasted better in the recipe. I might try it again without the rosemary and maybe adding some cheese in the sauce and little more on top.

This turns out as total mush, but tastes great over pasta or as a spread on toasted bread.

amazing! i couldn't get enough! I did however use fresh spinach and I sauted it in home made garlic butter, delisous! On the other hand, I'm sure that it would be just as good if i just used frozen.

The dish never set up... it was like a lot of spinach in some white liquid
