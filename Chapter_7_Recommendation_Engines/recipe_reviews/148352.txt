This recipe won't disappoint!  First, we halved this recipe and discovered it made approx. 4 dozen?  We then used the dough to make our version of doughnut holes.  They fried up quickly and were nice and airy inside.  Finally, we tossed them in a bowl full of cinnamon and sugar to coat.  Super-Duper :)

These were really good. Nice soft doughnut that is not to sweet and can hold up to a sweet topping. After I got the milk and flour all combined I did knead the dough for about 5 minutes until it was smooth. After cutting out the doughnuts it helps a lot if you put the doughnuts on wax paper for the second rise placing top side down that way they do not stick to everything during the second rise. Mine only took 30 seconds on each side during frying. I did not use a deep fryer just a heavy 2qt sauce pan on the stove. Before you start frying line a cookie sheet with paper towel and place a cooling rack on top. Less mess that way. I could not get the indent to stay in my doughnut everytime I put it in the oil it disappeared so I did not do the whipped cream I just made a glaze. These are very tasty. I will make again. Thanks

These are GREAT.  They instantly brought back memories of my childhood.
My mother used to make these for special occasions and I have been trying to find the right recipe.  These taste just like hers.  I did leave the sprinkles off though-personal choice since we only used sugar, jelly and whipped cream.
I will be making these often from now on.

Turned out great. More like a doughnut, but just barely sweet. I dusted with a little powder sugar. My husband used nutella. They were easy to make and a great little dessert. I halved the recipe I thought 120 was a bit much based on the original recipe. We made a total of 30. Will definitely make again.

I made these for my Mom and Dads Anniversary per my Dads request.  I was a little worried because after I punched them down they didn't seem to rise a whole lot.  I let them rise for almost 1 1/2 hours but they still didn't rise at all.  Anyway, running out of daylight I decided to just stick them in my deep fryer and they turned out great.  Made around 100 kneecaps.  The more I/we (5 kids helping)stretched them out before putting them in the oil the better form they had when they came out.  Which means the more cool whip they could put on top!!!!  Yum  we will make again. Tried the nutella per someone elses review...also great.  Did some with sugar and just powdered sugar too.

It's a tradition in my hometown that these were actually stretched over the knee of the person making them.  They're a special snack here, and they end up looking similar to a Frisbee with a dome in the center.  I love these and have been looking for a good recipe for them for ages. Thank you!
