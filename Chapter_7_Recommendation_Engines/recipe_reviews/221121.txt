First of all, it is very tasty.  I don't think I would call it cake but would call it bread.  The picture shows two loaves with no frosting.  There is a recipe for a very rich frosting.  I did not make that.  It calls for a 9x13 pan.  I baked it in a 9" bread pan.  It probably came up half way and did not rise any higher.  I had to bake it 50 minutes.  Something is missing somewhere because it would not make two 9x13 cakes.  I made 1/2 the recipe.  Even my husband liked it.

The second time I made it I added 1/2 tsp. baking powder to the whole recipe and it rose a little more.  I also baked in six mini loaf pans 30-35 minutes.  Easy to freeze and share.

I made this but cut it in 1/2 as I only needed one loaf and just spread butter on my slices.  DELICIOUS!!  I've already passed this recipe on.

Made it twice . Followed the recipe exactly. It didn't rise either time. I  cut it in thirds , frosted it and it was very tasty.  I  really wish I knew why it didn't rise and I probably wont make it again because of it.

I have made this twice. Last time someone said it was the 'best zucchini bread he had ever tasted'. I am inclined to agree.  The first time I made it with butter, and it was remarkably like  the icing from a German Chocolate cake. Who doesnt love a cake that tastes like icing?!  I do!  I made it the second time with half pecans, half walnuts.  I am just now starting on a third time.
