This recipe was great but with a few mofications.  I first read the reviews then changed the recipe as follows.

Instead of sour cream I used leftover gravy.
I also used leftover gravy to make my dressing.
I used one "light" tablespoon of onion soup mix.
I added an extra can of green beans to make the casserole thicker,doubled the turkey and doubled the dressing.
Last, I sprinkled canned french fried onions on top of the casserole about ten minutes before it finished. It cooked it four almost an hour. My family loved it!  Can easily feed six to eight people.

An easy variation to this recipe that really gets rid of leftovers is mix your leftover turkey with the green bean casserole and extra stuffing, pour in about a cup or so of the leftover gravy and mix, spread out in a 9x13 pan and sprinkle with CHEESE (I don't use sour cream)!!!!! bake accordingly !! We actually enjoy the casserole the next day more then the typical turkey day meal.

Based on what I read in the reviews, I tweaked this recipe slightly.  I dumped one of the canned soups to obtain a less soupy consistency.  I personally don't think it matters which one.  I used a reduced fat soup and fat free sour cream.  I don't like canned vegetables and didn't have green beans on hand, so I used a package of frozen, mixed vegetables (cooked before placing in the casserole).  In the last 5 minutes of baking, I topped the casserole with french fried onion rings and shredded, low fat chedder cheese.  My husband and I LOVED it!  This is definitely a keeper.

I would have given this 5 stars except I made modifications as suggested by others.  Use only one can soup, double amount of stuffing,  1/2 sour cream and 2-3T. onion soup mix. I used chopped fresh broccoli- delicious! Superb taste and everyone ate it up at my home. Thanks for sharing!  Will make again.

Great recipe.  I make it every year.  I omit the celery soup though.  I use just enough water to moisten the stuffing, so that it gets crispy.  And sometimes I use milk instead of sour cream.

We liked this a lot even though we made some changes (due to what we had in the cupboard).  We used cream of chicken soup instead of celery soup, onion/mushroom soup mix instead of onion soup mix.  We found that it seemed to need more stuffing so we doubled the stuffing recipe.  

Pretty quick and easy to make.

My family really enjoyed this recipe including my 2 and 3 year old.  They gobbled up the turkey like it was going out of style.  I followed the recipe to a tee and did think this was on the soupy side also.  However I served my casserole with mashed potatoes which seem to be the casserole's perfect match for the extra soupiness.  The potatoes also help cut back on the saltiness of the dish too.  Will definitely make again!

Can you say COMFORT FOOD?  Awesome recipe!  I've used corn and chicken instead of the turkey and green beans and it was great both ways.  We make this recipe often...love it!

This recipe was okay. The soup mixture was way more than the green beans and turkey, and it sat on top instead of soaking in, making it taste like a sour creamy onion casserole. I ate it, but I certainly wouldn't make it again.

I make this every year since I found it in 2005~This recipe is great!  it tastes like turkey dinner all in one pan.  I changed it a bit though, no onion soup mix (too salty for me) and no sour cream (too much choletorol for me)and i added a pinch of thyme.  I think thyme makes turkey and stuffing taste great!  I left out the canned veggie (can't do canned veggies)but used cooked green beans (frozen) and topped it with the prepared crispy onions in the canister.

Very good, a great way to use up dark meat for those of us that really only eat the white.

Very Tasty! I made this with what was on hand so there were a few changes.  I also halved the recipe, except I used the whole package of cornbread stuffing mix.  I didn't prepare the stuffing like it said, just put in enough water to get it very damp, but not totally soggy.  I drained 1 can of french green beans and put it on the bottom of a 2 QT glass baking dish, then put about 1/3 of the stuffing on top of the beans.  Mixed 1/2 a can of cream of mushroom soup, 1/2 a can of cream of chicken soup, about 8 oz of light sour cream, a couple shakes of dried diced onions and a couple shakes of garlic powder.  Put half of this on the layer of stuffing, shredded up about a cup of cooked turkey and put it on next.  Then the rest of the soup mixture, then the rest of the stuffing.  Patted the stuffing down firmly on top to squash it a bit into the soup.  Cooked at 350 for 30 minutes, then since it wasn't done, turned it up to 370 and cooked it for 15 more minutes.  Both my husband and I loved it!

This is one of those recipies that you can interchange the ingredients as you wish for the desired taste.  I followed the recipie as it was listed, with the exception that I used cut green beans instead of french and chicken thighs instead of turkey.  It turned out tasty, but, as others reported, was a little salty, but by tweaking the ingredient list, that can be changed.  I can see substituting the green beans with broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, or whatever veggies you may have on hand and even going meatless by adding extra veggies in the meat layer.  Bacon bits and cheese may also add additional flavor and texture.  It's definitely a recipie you can make many times and different variations each time.

It was good but not fantastic. I was looking for something that would allow me to use leftovers and it was good for that. I did have to make some changes because of what I had in the house. First, I forgot it was supposed to be layered and ended up mixing the veggies and turkey into the sauce. I only had healthy request cream of mushroom, so I left out the cream of celery and substituted one of the cans of green beans with a can of cream style corn. I used fat free sour cream and used slightly less than 16 oz since that's all I had. I'm not sure I used quite 2 cups of turkey, I just put in what I had left. I only had what stuffing was left from Thanksgiving so I sprinkled that on top, then covered that with the last of our turkey gravy, roughly a 1/2 cup, and sprinkled cheese over the top. It was very soupy, but possibly because I didn't have enough stuffing and I might not have had enough meat. But I had steamed broccoli, cauliflower and carrots leftover, as well as mashed potatoes. If I had thought of it sooner, they would have gone into the casserole, but since I didn't I just warmed them back up and served the mashed potatoes layered with the other veggies, topped with the casserole, and then I topped that with the last of our cranberry sauce. It was yummy. I did have a lot leftover but used that to make a yummy turkey noodle soup.

Just so-so.  The cream soup and dry soup mix was very salty.  I think I would prefer something like this but with gravy instead of soup.

Oh dear, much too salty, we are chucking the left overovers.  The "basic" flavour was fine but there was too much sauce and too little stuffing.  Would suggest just using one can of soup (mushroom) and cut down on the sour cream and just half a packet of onion soup or less.
Then it could be put in a smaller container and the stuffing would fit.  I can also see brocolli/cauliflower being a better choice of vegetable.

I agree with the others, it was on the salty side.  I did use the soups with less salt and used corn instead of beans.  I think I will saute' some onion, garlic and mushrooms next time and add that instead of the Onion soup.  BUT!!! my husband and I both really enjoyed it, just need to do a little adjusting.  Thanks for sharing.

Really good.  I make this year round using the little cooked turkeys you buy at the store or at boston market.  Changes I made were using half the soups and half the sour cream.  Also I added corn, fried onions, and a little cheese. Also I make my stuffing with celery and onions in it. Delicious.

My husband loved it and so did I.  I followed the directions of Janet F. and used one can of reduced fat mushroom soup, fat free sour cream and frozen, mixed vegetables.  Topped with french fried onion rings and shredded, low-fat cheddar cheese.  I am not one for high-fat casseroles, but with the low-fat ingredients it was delicious and reasonably heart healthy.

Very Yummy! I also altered the recipe by using 2 6oz packages of Stuffing. 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken. 1 Onion/Mushroom suop mix, No sour cream, just a little leftover gravy. About 3-4 cups of leftover turkey and walla! Cooked it loosely covered for about 50mins at 350. Bursting with flavor. Great recipe, just needs a little adjustment to perfect it. Enjoy!

I wasn't impressed with this recipe at all.  Very soupy and I only used half the sour cream.  I used low fat soups and sour cream, and used a vegatable soup mix.  Not a great combo.

I read the review first and used milk instead of sour cream.  Husband not crazy about onion soup mix, so I cut it in half. Only two of us, so I split between 7x7 pans. It's a winner! I will repeat!

This was great!  I think you could add another can of green beans, more turkey and another box of stuffing, yet still have enough sauce.

This was great for leftovers!  I made some minor changes to the recipe, but nothing huge.  I used a can of cream of broccoli, and a can of cream of chicken soup instead of what was listed; I  used frozen full green beans instead of the canned french style;  I used homemade stuffing instead of boxed; I added a layer of grated marble cheese; And I didn't have any sour cream on hand so I used 1/4 cup of milk.  I layered it as follows:  Soup/turkey/milk/onion soup mixture, then green beans, then cheese, and then stuffing on top.  I heated it 40 minutes, and it was perfectly heated through!  I will definitely make this to use up leftovers the next time I cook a turkey dinner!  Thanks so much!

This was a really yummy way to use the leftover turkey. I had made the Herbed Corn recipe and used it as the vegetable. The family loved it!

My whole family really likes this dish. It is easy to put together and I have even used canned chicken in a pinch when I don't have leftover turkey. My husband even mixes up the veggies too. He put corn in with beans this last time.

A healthier version ... my husband had a quadruple bypass about 2 years ago, so I  limit fats, salts ... the yummy things.    The proportions I used were:
1.5 cups homemade stuffing (lower in salt)
1 (16 ounce) container no fat sour cream
1 (10.75 ounce) can Campbell’s Healthy Request cream of mushroom soup (low sodium, 98% fat free)
2 lbs. fresh green beans, blanched
4 cups cooked, chopped turkey meat (twice the amount called for)
1 cup homemade gravy (reduced broth with the fat skimmed off, not too thick)
I layered  half the green beans, turkey, sour cream mixture, stuffing, green beans, driizzeled the gravy over the top.  When bubbly, I sprinkled crispy onion rings over the top for the last 5 minutes  of cooking.
My 15 year old son did not remember the last time I made a casserole!

We really enjoyed this, but I changed it some.  I used a smaller pan, based on the amount of leftovers I had.  I layered frozen veggies, turkey, 1/2 soup mix (only used one can of cream of celery mixed with sour cream), 1/2 stuffing, cranberry sauce (sounds gross but really added a NICE flavor to the dish), turkey, soup, stuffing, leftover mashed potatoes, and on top, gravy.  WOW was it nice.  My husband practically licked his plate!  It was plenty moist and flavorful.

Thank you Hope!! I used my leftover vegetables instead of french style green beans.  I didn't have to make the stuffing as I had it leftover too. A family of 5 came down with a bad bug of some kind. I had too much food prepared but it all was used in your terrific recipe. I used almost 4 cups of turkey. I will look forward to using this recipe again. THANKS ALOT  The casserole didn't last long at all.  No Waste..I love it

Tried steamed broccoli and mushrooms instead of canned green beans and downplayed the soupy mixture. Good stuff.

I won't make this again.  The ingredients sounded like a good mix, but finished product had too much sauce, too little stuffing and left much to be desired.  I'll stick with making sandwiches next time.

The recipe sounds good, but when I placed the meal in front of the family they held there noses. A few dared to eat it and made faces I have never seen in at my table before. I ended up buying my kids pizza.

Okay, the basics are here, but something is just not right.  I made the recipe as instructed and it was good but could've been better.  I found that the sour cream mixture had not much flavor so we found ourselves adding salt, this made us suck down water later! LOL  I would make it again but leave out the sour cream, just use the canned soups mixed with the dry soup mix, I think this would make it more flavorful.  I like another reviewers idea of adding another can of green beans, will try again with those slight modifications.

My family loved this casserole even though I used broccoli instead of celery soup in it.  It is easy to assemble and bakes up quickly.  Deliciously teamed with mashed potatoes, it's a real "comfort food" dish.

I was looking for new ways to serve the left over
Thanksgiving bird and this was a great recipe. I used cut green beans instead of the french style (kids like them better).  My family says it's a keeper.  Note:  I would bake it a little longer, was not heated through at 35 minutes.

Made this with the left over green bean casserole, used half the sour cream, 1 can of cream of broccoli soup, because that's what I had, and my hubby hates cream of mushroom. I mixed my stuffing and the left over corn bread casserole. I also added a can of corn drained. I set it up by the recipe, and I think that if you're creative this recipe is a good outline, although if you followed it to the t, I think it would be way to saucy.

The whole family loved this.  I made it twice over the holidays.  The first time, I made it with cream of broccoli soup, a layer of mashed potatoes and lemon pepper.  Very good.  The second time, I used cream of mushroom soup, mashed potatoes, 4 slices of bacon (bits), lemon pepper and black olive slices.  Awesome, (liked cream of broccoli better) just add what you like.  Foolproof base recipe.

This is a super delicious way to use leftovers. Of course it all depends on how good the food was at the original meal. We had very tasty leftovers, so making it into a great tasting casserole was easy.

This was very good for Thanksgiving leftovers. I did not use any soup though. I used my leftover Green Bean Casserole on the bottom, covered it with Turkey, covered that with gravy, then topped it with leftover stuffing - and it came out Wonderful!   I mean, just mixing together all my leftovers, but it was quite good, and now in one tupperware.  4 Stars because I did not use the soup...I think one can would be enough though.

It had a good flavor but very soupy. I ate one BOWL of it and desided to thicken it up to make it more like a casserole. I cooked 1 cup of rice and mixed it in and it was very good. If you have tried it before and liked the flavor but not the consistency try it with the rice. It doesn't change the flavor but is a goos stand alone dish.

This recipe was really quick and easy to make.  It was a little on the salty side, I think because of the soups.  However, it was tasty.  A great way to use up that leftover turkey!

This was recipe was very good.  A nice change from our usual chicken dish.  I think I might try it with brocolli next just for variety.  I cut the recipe in half so I only used one can of cream soup, 3 cups stuffing, and 2 Tbls of the soup mix (since people complained it was salty).  It tasted great to me!

I thought the dish tasted too sweet and didn't hold together very well.  Next time, I may skip the sour cream, and use milk instead.  I like the stuffing as a topping.

Nice way to use leftovers.  If I made it again I would look for salt-free or low salt soups...was just a bit too salty.  Very good otherwise.

I liked the concept of this recipe, however my family thought it was too salty.  I would possibly try making this again without the onion soup mix and with reduced sodium cream soups.

This was great my hubby loved it will definitely make this again. I used milk and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup as I didn't have any sour cream. You can really make this recipe your own just by using what you have on hand.

Absolutely loved this.  My Fiance made it but we changed it up a bit by using a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and also used Mashed potatoes and mixed cheese, mozza and cheddar.  We put the veggies on the bottom then the turkey and soup, sour cream mixture follow by stove top stuffing and then the mashed potatoes and cheese.  It is absolutely DELICIOUS!!!

After reading the reviews, I only mixed together 8 oz of lo fat sour cream and one can of healthy low salt Campbell's cream of mushroom soup. So... Green beans went in first, then turkey, then soup mix . Then, I added all natural fried onions on top of that and then the stuffing.... Leftover gravy, and remaining fried onions..... It was SO good!!

I tried this recipe after Thanksgiving, and boy was it a winner with my family! The only substitution I made was for the sour cream. I substituted plain Greek non-fat yogurt along with the onion soup mix. I added ALL my leftovers from Thanksgiving, including leftover mashed potatoes and gravy. I layered everything and topped with leftover stuffing. I baked it for 1 hour, and it was DELICIOUS!! This recipe is a keeper!

I wouldn't change anything about this recipe- loved it! It didn't even need salt, seasoned perfect with the onion soup.  I chopped up my turkey in a mini food chopper and it was great.  The only con for this recipe is right after Thanksgiving it's more stuffing! But we enjoyed it anyways, 2 days later!  Otherwise, freeze your turkey, then use this recipe.

Very, very good! I used 3 cans green beans and cut down on the fat by using six+ Tbs of light sour cream. I also used one can of low-fat cream of mushroom soup and the amount of "sauce" at the bottom was perfect! I did thin it, though, with about 3 Tbs. of milk - before I added the milk it was too gloppy. Overall one of the best weeknight suppers I've ever made! It couldn't be faster or more delicious (my sister and I polished off a small casserole in one sitting!). Thanks!

I don't understand how this has so many high ratings! We even took the advice to modify it and we did double the stuffing and omitted the cream of celery soup, but the entire dish tasted like hot sour cream. It was soupy and too salty.

4 star rating only b/c I made some changes (based on others' reviews) to the original recipe that resulted in a 5 star rating:  omitted cream of celery soup and onion soup mix, only used 8 oz sour cream, and added pinch of thyme.  With the changes, it was EXCELLENT with smoked turkery breast!  Will make again.

I did not care for this dish at all. Maybe because I did not have the onion soup mix it called for, but I made it anyway. Next time I will make sure to have all the ingredients.

Great way to use leftovers. The idea was good so I improvised and used 1/2 the package of onion soup mix, 1/2 the sour cream and added leftover mashed potatoes , 2C, and leftover gravy 1C, as I had them on hand.

it was ok I used can cream of chicken instead of  celery because I added celery and onion to my stuffing. I think if I make it again I would use less sour cream and add half and half cream instead, and maybe add another vegs

Delicious. I'm glad I read the reviews. Great upgrades. I used 1/2 the sour cream and only 1 can of soup. I also added the fried onions.  Will make it again.

Simple, quick and delicious. I already had everything in my pantry for it. The family all enjoyed it, although my most critical child said “I’d give it a four. Definitely make it again.”

The flavor of this dish was really good and my whole family loved it! However, I found this recipe, as written, to have way too much sauce for the amount of other ingredients. Next time I will either cut back on sauce or add more stuff! Maybe corn or mashed potatoes, plus more turkey! Also, next time, I will use low sodium soups as, with the addition of the onion soup mix, the sauce was quite salty.

I made this recipe  tonight for myself and my husband. I cut the recipe in half and made some changes. I didn't use the onion soup mix.  I sauteed a cup of onions In olive oil, mixed the cream of mushroom soup, 8 ozs of sour cream and a cup of leftover gravy.  Added a little garlic powder, Oregano and Rosemary.  I did not use the evaporated milk as I totally missed that in the instructions. I think the milk might be why some had issues with the casserole being soupy.  I layered first with green beans, turkey, soup mixture, leftover stuffing, mash potatoes, and shredded Cheddar cheese.  Baked for 30 minutes and then topped with French fried onions and baked for 5 minutes.  We loved it. Comfort food!  My husband said I could definitely make it again.

Instead of decreasing the soup & sour cream mix as other reviewers suggested,  I started with a layer of crispy hashbrowns. I also added 1/3 cup of sharp cheddar & 1/3 cup of asiago/parmesean cheese to the soup/sour cream mixture. I topped it with my wifes leftover stuffing which already includes celery, onions, wild rice & sausage & finished it off with more sharp cheddar & asiago/parmesean. I also let it bake 45 mins @ 350. It was magnificent but all said & done I do believe I would cut back a little on the sour cream. I absolutely agree it's a great way to use Tday leftovers!

I was drawn to this recipe because it used beans and it did not  use cheese--two things which were different than most turkey casseroles.   Read other comments and made changes in consequence and because of what I had on hand.  I only used one soup, for instance and it was mushroom.  I did not have any stuffing so I used bread crumbs and then sprinkled on some sage.  It turned out very well and I will use this recipe again.

I made this just as the recipe was written with one exception. I substituted the cream of celery with cheddar cheese soup. My family and I did not care for this recipe at all. It was just odd in texture. The layer of soup didn't mesh with the other ingredients at all, and was just CLEARLY a layer of soup. The execution of the recipe as written is very poor, but the taste was okay, if a bit salty. I would not make this again without serious adjustments.

I used coconut milk instead of evaporated milk, added a bit more flour to the sauce, added a layer of leftover carrots, used leftover stuffing instead of mix and put another sprinkling of cheese on top. Yum!

Sort of bland. Maybe it was just because I'm not really into casserole. My boyfriend wanted it because his grandmother used to make one with similar ingredients. He felt the same way. Perhaps it just wasn't the recipe we were looking for.

I DIDNT CARE FOR THIS RECIPE. I THINK IT WAS THE SOUR CREAM IN IT. I THINK I WOULD LIKE LEFTOVER TURKEY WITH CHICKEN HELPER AND STUFFING BETTER.
