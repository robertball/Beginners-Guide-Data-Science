Please don't call something that is not made with arborio rice or cooked the traditional way a 'Risotto'...Call it Creamy Chicken Rice

Absolutely delicious! I used Campbells cream of chicken soup instead, and added fresh chopped mushrooms.

I will be making this again.  I made a few adjustments by using chicken boulion and water instead of chicken broth and adding some frozen vegtables and some cajun spice.

This was a good recipe.  It was a great way to use some left over rotisserie chicken I had saved. Adjustments I made: I used a can of diced carrots, chicken boullion with two cups of water instead of the can of broth and 3/4 c water, some left over fried onions instead of green onions and I used minute rice instead of regular rice to speed it up.  Very versatile.  I will definitely make again!

I substituted mushrooms for the carrots and used arborio rice. The resulting risotto was deliciously creamy and full of flavor.

This tasted great!  I just made 3 slight changes/additions...I used brown rice instead of white and I added broccoli and a little cayenne pepper.  It was so good I'm sure I'll make it again!

Made this tonight.  Both the hubby and I had to add salt and pepper.   Super bland.  It's eatable, but I will definitely not make it again.  As a matter of fact, the print out of this recipe has already been thrown away.

This was just okay for me--a little bland and not worth making again.

We made this as written mostly. I couldn't find the cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic in my grocery store, so I added a little bit of minced garlic to the mix with plain cream of mushroom soup. I also used arborio rice since it's a risotto recipe.  It was pretty good - some reviewers described it as bland and I can see where someone would think that - but based on the ingredient list it doesn't have a lot of seasoning to begin with, so I thought it tasted as expected. I think it's a great "comfort food" recipe. Oh yeah, and super easy to make. My daughter helped and when it was done she said "That's it? We're done already?" I would make this again.
