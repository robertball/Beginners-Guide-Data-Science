After sharing these with several people they all asked for the recipe.  I also made the same recipe except I used corned beef instead of sausage and I cut the cream cheese in half and added 6 oz of shredded swiss cheese and used 1,000 island dressing as a dipping sauce.  Basically, rueben balls.

The work involved is worth it!I always dbl.the recipe because everyone loves them.I learned how to make these from my mom.She always made them for family gatherings.Only thing we do differently is snip w/scissors the kraut and lightly brown the balls in oil,then bake at 375 for 15 to 20 min.

This recipe was awesome!!!  My husband and I had sauerkraut balls at a German Restaurant in Columbus, OH a few years ago and have craved them ever since.  This recipe was very close to the original.  I made them as a Christmas appetizer and they were devoured.

I just served these sauerkraut balls at a New Year's Day party. I received so many compliments and requests for the recipe. Guests even raved how much better they were than a couple of well known German restaurants in Columbus Ohio. I am guilty of making some minor modifications. I used more onion than the recipe called for as well as honey mustard and black pepper. I used the refrigerated sauerkraut in a plastic bag and hand sqeezed all the liquid from the kraut (don't rinse). A chef on T.V. once said that the only use for "dried" parsley is for garnish. I used fresh cilantro since my local store ran out of fresh parsley. Also, use a couple of fresh garlic cloves instead of garlic salt and add a little salt. I doubled the recipe and used a 1oz scoop to form the balls (30ct). I was worried that placing them in a crock pot would make them soggy.  It worked fairly well. Simply place papertowels on the bottom and then place paper towels between each layer with the crockpot on warm setting.

Hubby and I host 2-3 "Beast Feasts" per year and yesterday I used this one and substituted venison kielbasa for the pork sausage.  We had over 50 people show up and and everyone that tried one of these loved it...including the kids.  I doubled the recipe and got a yield of 85.  We had about 15 other dishes available, but this one was one of the favorites!  Made a horseradish sauce for dipping just for fun.  Excellent recipe!

Great recipe with good ratios.  I ate sauerkraut balls like crazy growing up in Ohio and LOVED them.  Never even thought to make them before until a recent ball-themed snack party.  

I tried variations of this recipe and determined that you can substitute about a clove or so of garlic for the garlic salt (this dish doesn't need any extra salt).  Definitely WASH the kraut and drain well, even squeezing out the excess water with your hands.  Careful on the amounts of onion and garlic as both can overpower the taste of the balls.  I added about a teaspoon each of fresh thyme and oregano at the end of cooking the sausage and added a T or two of fresh Italian parsley before mixing up the balls.  Caraway seeds are a good addition too.  

Chilling the mixture in the freezer for 15 min. before balling makes it so much easier.  Used buttermilk in the coating for extra flavor.  Did half with Panko instead of crumbs but you could barely tell the difference, both in look and taste.  Frying was key to a crispy coating but these reheat very well in a hot oven or toaster oven.

Very good!  A friend had made something like these for a Christmas party a few years ago so I was happy to find this recipe.  I made them for a superbowl party and kept them warm in a crock pot set on low.  There weren't any leftovers!

Deliciously odd! I really liked these. They weren't that bad to make either as far as labor goes.  I did make them with leftover kraut and polska kielbasa.  This is very unique- thanks for sharing.

This is the exact same recipe the was handed down to me by my Mother in-law, God bless her!  My husband hates kraut, but loves these so much!  He made me try them when we first got married 9 years ago and we have made them at the holidays, especially New Year's Eve, ever since!  

They are fantastic, unique and worth every bit of effort!

pretty good, though i was trying to duplicate barley's balls from columbus ohio and just couldn't figure it out.  i added butter and cheddar cheese to this, but it still seemed too sour :(  someone told me to rinse your sauerkraut before draining it - i'l try this next time...  i don't have a deep fryer, so fried in 1 inch oil in a deep pot on the stove for 60 sec - worked good:)  best when served warma dn fresh - not so good after refridgerated.

I made this exactly by the recipe, except I rinsed the sauerkraut and I wish I hadn't.  It needed a little more flavor.  But I can't wait to make the next batch!

MmMmMm! Because it was only two of us eating them, I made mine a little bit bigger! But they were still so good. My parents actually used this recipe first then passed it on to me!

I made these with cabbage. I like sauerkraut but did not have any. I had a half a head of cabbage I needed to use. They turned out great. I baked at 350 for 20 minutes.

These were awesome! I'll definitely make these again. I may try to use italian sausage (or 1/2 of pork sausage and 1/2 of italian sausage) to try to spice it up. I did bake them and they turned out wonderful!

i first have to start off by saying i am a the biggest fan of kraut.  (german)  i even drink the juice!!! yikes.  these balls are kinda weird.  ?? i dont know if its the bread crumbs or what but not good.  i did make the recipe as directed and also found it hard that once the balls were formed and needed to be rolled in the egg wash and crumbs they fall apart.   i have tried to bake but they dont get crispy enough.  will not try ever again.   sorry.

I always come back to this recipe with a few minor changes.  I like to make mine with HOT sausage and add cayenne pepper and shredded Swiss cheese.  I even find myself getting into the fridge the next morning and choking on them for breakfast.  Awesome!

I had some sauerkraut sitting around and wanted to make something with it, I hate wasting. I have never tried sauerkraut balls before, and didn't even know that they existed :-)  I followed the recipe a 100% which is almost a first for me. I did not feel like the prep work was extra strenuous. They turned out great. A definite keeper.

Made these and they were excellent.  I added some swiss cheese to these, I'm a big cheese fan, and they were great.  Everyone loved them.  Will have to make again.  Thanks.

I used left over Hungarian sausage that I ground myself. I also used a full 8oz of cream cheese.

I made these for a New Years party, lucky German pork and kraut, to RAVE reviews and lots of requests for the recipe. I substituted based on what I had available including using Johnsonville Brats for the pork sausage, spicy panko for the breadcrumbs, and an artisanal kraut made with craft beer. The flavors were perfect together with the panko giving it just a little kick. Rather than the oven, I used my new air fryer (400 for 15 minutes) and they came out golden brown, crispy and delicious! This will be a New Years tradition!

I used hot breakfast sausage, stone ground mustard, gluten free bread crumbs and flour. We served them with hot sauce, stone ground Dijon mustard and ranch (for those with a sensitive pallet). Everyone loved them so much ... I made a double batch for Christmas Eve party. We call them dragon balls because of the added heat.

DELICIOUS! I used arrowroot flour instead of wheat to make gluten-free. It turned out so good! Thanks for sharing!

We loved this.  Actually, I made a mistake when making it, and added the whole pack of cream cheese. (8oz)  The meatballs turned out more like a patty, but they were great tasting.  I baked them at 350 for 35 minutes on a greased cookie sheet, flipping them all once 1/2 way through.  I might try them with chopped up chicken next time, as they resemble the taste of chicken croquettes or even crab cakes.

These are delicious!  I did use homemade rye bread  crumbs instead of Italian bread crumbs as I had a 2 day old lord af of rye on hand.  Also, used an airfryer to cook. They turned out great. Will make again.

Excellent appetizer! Only thing I did different was to mix the flour, egg, and milk together using about 2 tbl extra milk and ran them through that as batter before the breadcrumbs.  I like them just as well cold / room temp with a little thousand island dressing.

These are delicious and have been a hit in my house over and over again.  I use Italian ground sausage and follow the recipe exactly.  Just a trick I have found.  Really squeeze the juice out of the sauerkraut.  I drain it, then hand squeeze it then pat it dry with a paper towel.  The balls stay put together that way.  I have also froze them and they turned out great.

Overall they are good. I think they are a bit on the salty side. When I make these again I would use more sauerkraut and less sausage. Also maybe use garlic powder instead of salt.

I made two batches,  the first batch was straight from the recipe and was delicious. The second I swapped out the pork for corned beef,  and it was still just as delightful.
