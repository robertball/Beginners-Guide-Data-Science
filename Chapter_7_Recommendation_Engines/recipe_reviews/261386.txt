I used parboiled rice and Spanish paprika and turmeric for the golden color. I shouldâ€™ve made extra!

Made as listed and it was horrible.  I used the Vigo rice and there is something in that rice mix that my taste buds do not like.  I will never buy it again as this is the third time in two years that I have made a dish with it and the results are the same. 

Will never buy Vigo rice again.  I thought it was Curry, but the package does not list Curry as an ingredient  but it does contain Aluminum which is another reason to never buy again.

I used less oil, and a Goya box of the Arroz Amarillo - delish!

Super simple and flavorful. This would be perfect for nights you don't have much time in the kitchen. I think using the frozen pea/carrot combo would be good too and even add more color.  I prefer my chicken grilled but this worked great for a night I had other things to do besides being stuck in the kitchen for hours.
