I think the concept of this recipe is awesome, however I made a few changes as follows.  I cut the potatoes as described and stuffed them with onions, but then I drizzled them with olive oil instead of butter. I then drizzled them with a table wine (merlot)and sprinkled them with kosher salt.  The wine and olive oil give them such a nice flavor that is cooked in because of the foil (great idea!)

A great recipe! I used olive oil and marsala cooking wine, but I left everything else the same. Next time, I'll definitely add some salt and pepper before I bake them, though.

A few tips on stuffing the potatoes: Cut them about 3/4 of the way through, and slide a thin butter knife into the cuts and turn it  slightly sideways so it holds the potato open.

The butter, onion and sherry can be increased or decreased as desired - still great.

This is one of those recipes that makes you exclaim right as you taste it. Was ASTOUNDING! 

Like suggestions, I made some changes. I used Christian Brothers California Dry Sherry. I replaced the butter with olive oil. Also added some garlic powder to the oil and drizzle sot sauce in with the wine BEFORE the oil.

Also cut the onions VERY thin. Half moon shaped wedges fit in good going in an upside down U way. So they bend with the shape of the potato. Also, using a butter knife to hold the cuts open worked AMAZING! Glad I read that,

The oil locked in the juice n flavors. The onion broke down to the consistency of the potatoes. I was cooking for someone that hates the texture of onions. They didn't even believe me they were in there since they had the same texture as the potato. The wine just turns it all to an amazing hand mashed texture. 

Other wines and different salts could change the taste a bit. So could stuffing in thin garlic slices. but it doesn't NEED improved. Tastes freaking AMAZING ^_^

Really liked the flavor of this. Because I was pressed for time, I put the potatoes in the microwave and then finish them off in the oven after adding the butter, onion and sherry. I actually used marsala instead of cooking sherry.

These potatoes were good The wine gave it a touch of sweet flavoring....
But it did take two of us to stuff the potatoes. We cut a slit down the middle and then cut slits crosswise and had one of us open the potato while the other stuffed. I also added a pat of butter into each boat and rosemary. Will make again.

I've been making these for years, they are great on the grill as well.  We put different twist such as Cajun spices, Italian, and Greek seasoning.  We do this with yellow crook neck squash too.

When I told everyone that I was bringing these to a dinner party, most said "ewww".  However, their reactions were much different when they ate it.  I used my electric carving knife, hoping it would be easier to stuff things into the cuts.  Whe had trouble getting the onion in, no less the butter.  I used olive oil.  I also added some Rosemary.  It was a hit!  Next time, I will try a mandalin for thinner slices of onion, and melted butter.  I will be making this again, and so will the guests who asked for the recipe.  Oh!  I also bought a decent bottle of sherry, as they say, "if you wouldn't drink it, why cook with it."  Same taste buds.

Very good recipe.  I do a sliced foil wrapped potato on the grill.  I use montreal steak seasoning, but no liquid beyond buttter.  So I was anxious to try these.  I used marsala wine, onion and a few slices of shallot.  The family enjoyed, so I will do again.  I be you could use chicken broth in a pinch.

I was tired of the same old baked potato so I tried this recipe over the the weekend. WOW! I did substitute olive oil for butter and next time I may substitute marsala for sherry but this one is sure to become a staple in my home. Kudos!

I wasn't particularly impressed with this. I expected the lovely flavours of the onion and the sherry to melt into the potato, and give it an exquisite flavour. It tasted just like regular baked potato! I used a sweet potato because that's what I prefer, and that's all i could taste. I won't be making this again

Good idea, but the sherry gave a funny flavor.  If i try again, I may cut back on the sherry (or use a different kind of wine) and add spices.

Pretty simple and very forgiving.  I like to add extra onions to the bottom of the foil pouch so they caramelize in the sherry.  Make them at least once a week.  If I want a nicer presentation, I put them in an oval ramekin and seal it with foil--same effect without the effort required to plate the potato without messing up the accordion effect.

Awesome. I have done many variations on this including cutting potatoes up small or coating potatoes with olive oil and rolling in garlic powder.

I fixed it with some marinated grilled chicken, and since I only have one oven, I cooked them in the microwave sliced, with onion powder, olive oil and white wine dribbled over. Not much flavor until we salted them, but at least it was a change from the usual "baked with sour cream and chives."

Tried these baked in a covered casserole dish, since aluminum foil is not environmentally friendly and also cooking in aluminum is harmful to health.  They were very tasty.

Tasted good, but I don't think the Sherry really added much to the recipe.  Could have just as easily made a normal baked potato.

These were so good!  I had rose wine and used that.  I probably used less onion and more butter than the recipe called for, and I added some salt and pepper before baking them.  Definitely a make-again!

Somethng easy and different.  I sliced mine into thin wedges and layered with onion and butter.  I added a little salt and pepper because some comments mentioned this recipe was too bland.  I poured the cooking wine on top, closed up tin foil and baked.  Tender and tasty!

I really could not taste any difference than a regular baked potato. Maybe my foil boat did not hug the potato tightly enough, but I was not impressed with the recipe.

I liked the idea of this recipe, it just lacked a few basics. As many before stated adding S&P is a must. I also added minced garlic( by "minced" I mean using a micro-plainer and grating each bulb right into whatever you'd like) and I made it 1/4 cup Chardonnay instead of the cooking sherry. One last difference, I brushed with the butter/garlic, then "pre-cooked them in the micro for 5 mins. Then I  topped them with shredded Cheddar Cheese, wrapped them loosely in foil and baked at 400* for 20 mins. Perfecto! My entire family really liked them. I am sure this is now a family favorite. 
Thanks for the original idea.

These were great!  I definitely used more than 1/4 tsp of butter, and I drizzled a tiny bit of olive over as well to help to prevent burning.  I used some leftover red wine and added salt and pepper before baking.  I will definitely make these again!

These are delicious if you substitute a good sherry, marsala, or whatever wine (white or light) you prefer, and add salt.This is good as written (four stars) but with the substitutions of olive oil for butter and with or without shallots and garlic, as others have mentioned, it can be tweaked to personal preferences.  But it is a good recipe exactly as written. Good job, Rowdy!

This turned out well, but wasn't as good as I hoped it would be based on the ingredients - the onions and sherry didn't seem to add much taste to the potato.

not a fan of the recipe. It was really hard to cut the potato and just put in the butter, let alone an onion.  Once removed from the oven, the smell alone made me not eat these.  I won't make this again.
