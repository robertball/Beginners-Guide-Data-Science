I made this recipe as written for my Gourmet groups Hawaiian luncheon. It was a perfect ending to our meal, light not overly sweet and everyone liked it. I was a little worried about the toasted coconut on top but everyone agreed, even those who do not like coconut that it added just a little extra crunch and tasted good. I made the cake and filling the night before and stored in fridge.  I used 2 Pyrex portables 13 by 9 pans that have the plastic covers so they could be stacked on top of each other. I made the whipped cream the next morning and spread it on the cakes. It really makes the dessert special and I would not use a substitute.  Great recipe to feed 24 people with not a lot of work and good on the budget!  Thanks Eunice!

Good, I didn't sweeten the whipped cream. I think this made it a little bit more refreshing. It was sweet enough without the added sugar.

I have a recipe almost identical to this one it takes a couple of more ingrediants its called hawaiian cake and i hade a hawaiian party last summer and i made 4 cakes put then together then put the topping on it it took two of us to carry it out, i decorated it with flowers then i put two pineapple tops on each end of the huge tray it sat on then i put little umbrella's on it, it fed 55 people. I had so much fun making it
Before i put the cream cheese mixture on it, I cooked crushed pineapple and brown sugar and cornstarch, then i added a tsp of rum extact, let it cool then spread it on the cake before adding the next layer you must try this it really sets it off. One more note: i also put pineapple juice in with the crushed pineapple and cornstarch mixture. ALOHA!!

My Aunt used to make this cake 30 some years ago. She used 1 box of Jiffy yellow cake made according to pkg, then topped that by mixing together 1 pkg vanilla pudding mixed with 4 oz. cream cheese and 1 1/2 c. milk. After spreading the mix she topped that with 8 oz. Cool Whip and sprinkled mixed nuts on top. Very Very easy and refreshing for a hot summer day.

Unbelievably Good!!! OMG!!! This was definitely a big time favorite at our hawaiian party. Similar to other reviewers I would recommend refrigerating this overnight for the best flavor. I did substitute haupia pudding mix for 1 box of the vanilla pudding mix and added fresh pineapple rings to the top of the cake. This was beyond good. I already have requests to make this again for 2 upcoming friend parties this month.

If you love pineapple and coconut this is a recipe for you.  I had a dinner club that I attend and our theme was Hawaiian and I was to bring a dessert.  I brought this and the gals went back for seconds!  It does make a lot though!  I usually freeze one cake pan to eat at a later date and it tasted just as good as if I had just made it the day before!

I am someone who didn't even know how to make whipped cream out of heavy whipping cream...haha. After looking it up on the net, even I was able to make this recipe with ease...AND It was a HUGE hit. In fact, one of the guys came up to me and said he would "make love" to this dessert if he could. Yummy!

This dessert was fantastic. Everyone complemented me on it all night. I made it with fat free cream cheese, sugar free-fat free pudding, and used the lite cool whip. I originally made the regular whipped cream but threw it away because I thought it was too heavy for this dish. The cool whip was perfect -just remember to thaw the cool whip 5 hours ahead of use ;0 )

Good recipe.  I do not frequently make dessert and forgot to purchase the eggs for the cake mix.  They are not listed on the recipe list so make sure you add them (as well as whatever else is called for in the cake mix).  I think the dessert would be great frozen.  It states to chill a minimum of 2 hours, I would chill overnight minimum!  We ate this after 2 hours and we all thought it was much better the next day.  Overall, would suggest this recipe...makes a lot for the price!

I made this last night for my husbands birthday.  He brought one of the cakes in today to work.  He said everyone LOVED it and were coming back for seconds.  Needless to say, the entire cake was gone.  I'm bringing this to the Foster Parent Picnic last week.  This feed a lot!  I lightly sweetened the whipped cream by only using 2 Tablespoons of confectioners sugar and 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla.  It was perfect!  I'm uploading a photo.  Can't wait to make again.

I used this recipe to make cupcakes for a Hawaiian themed party.  They were a huge hit.  I did stabilize the whipped cream with gelatin since I knew they would be left out for a while.  I had over half the pudding mixture left because I didn't think I could load it up too much on the cupcake.  Will just use 2 packages of pudding mix and adjust the milk next time.  I had so many people ask for the recipe.  I uploaded a picture.

This dessert was so refreshing.  I brought it with me to Easter dinner with my in-laws, and everyone loved it.  I added bright food coloring to the coconut on top and it looked very nice for Easter!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was very good, but I think next time I will add drained crushed pineapple to the cake mix, and stir in mandarin oranges after beating the cream cheese and adding the pineapple.

All I can say is wonderful! I made this dessert for a bridal shower at our church. Everyone loved it! I shared my second pan with family & friends and got rave reviews! It keeps well in fridge& actually gets better, if that is possible. I will be making it again for Easter. Thanks for this great recipe.

This was pretty tasty! My family seemed to like it a lot.  It makes two big pans so perfect for a party or pot luck. I don't think it is necessary to sweeten the cream either.

I made this for an Oscar party (The Descendants dish) and it was a hit with everyone! I used one cake pan and poured all the mix in with the same amount of topping and it turned out great.

This recipe makes a LOT of hawaiian dessert, but it was nice to put one in the freezer! I made it as described, and it was easy, light, fluffy, and delicious! It was the highlight of our Mother's Day meal, and I have already been asked for the recipe. I didn't sweeten the heavy whipping cream, and I recommend it this way, it balanced out the other sweet ingredients. Look forward to making it again!!!

Very refreshing! Made this for several get togethers and it was a huge hit! It made two large rectangular pans (I only needed one!) which was nice to have in case we needed more or to have leftovers for ourselves :D Also, I used Cool Whip instead. You can't cut it like in the picture, but I like the light texture and taste better than home made whip cream.
