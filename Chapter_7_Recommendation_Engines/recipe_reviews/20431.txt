The kids at the party loved this punch....that is until my husband put rum into the mix.  Then we had to ban the kids from drinking it.  To keep this punch cold, I froze juice in a jello mold along with some of the cherries.  I was very pretty and kept the punch cold for quite some time.

I made this punch for a baby shower and it was a hit!  It was gone half way through the party. :) 
I used unly 1/2 of the cherry syrup so it was perfect, not too sweet.  Thanks!

I enjoyed this punch over the Thanksgiving holidays.  I didn't mix the ginger ale with it, because I was the only one drinking it.  Instead, I mixed all the juices and kept in a container in the fridge.  When I wanted some Cran-Dandy Cooler, I would fill the glass half full with the juice mixture, then add ginger ale and ice.  Worked perfectly.  My only qualm was the color of it - it was sort of a thick brownish color - which I didn't think looked very appetizing.  But it tasted great, and I will make it again.  Thanks Bea!

Most people at the party seemed to like the punch but a lot was left over.  I don't know if pineapple juice AND orange is necessary, there's a lot of flavors going on.  It is refreshing and tasty though.

Not sure how some people were getting a brownish color with this drink.  Mine came out a beautiful reddish pink.  Our family enjoyed this punch for New Year's Eve.  We don't do alcohol so this was a festive and tasty substitute.  It is pretty sweet though.  Also, the recipe as posted doesn't make a whole lot, so to get 10 servings, I doubled the recipe, which filled my punch bowl about half-full.

Pretty good.  Would make again.  In blender it creates a lot of foam from the gingerale, but it is still tasty.

This is really refreshing. I didn't have any OJ so I used tropical V-8 splash instead. I also omitted the lemon juice and sub. sprite for ginger ale. What a great fruit juice drink. Thanks!!

COLOR!!! the taste is OK -- nothing memerable --- but the color throws me for a loop. It looks like a big bowl of melted carmel, or thick apple cider. Not very appetizing to the eye, but a pleasant taste in spite of it. I would try a different punch next time to see if it looks better. Remember, you first eat (or in this case drink) with your eyes.

Very good! I made this for dinner when our pregnant friend was coming over and we wanted to serve something more interesting than just soda.  I doubled the recipe and the four of us drank it all over the course of the evening! I didn't add the cherry juice, but followed the rest if the recipe exactly. I don't know how people got caramel brown, my punch was that pretty pink color.  Maybe you added too much OJ? I used the no-pulp stuff and it worked well. Thanks!

We loved this punch, and I can't wait to make it again. It's not overly sweet and is very refreshing. I poured the cherries with the juice into the punch, and used Fresca instead of ginger ale. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is a great drink! Very refreshing. Mine was a pinkish red color as well. As for the previous reviewers that thought it was too sweet, I served over ice cubes and that seemed to help dilute it. Thanks.

This is a great mocktail! I happened to have pineapple juice on hand so I tried it. I didn't have orange juice but I had two oranges for fresh squeezed juice. I make a lemon simple syrup so I added that and club soda in place of the lemon lime soda. That way I can adjust the sweetness.

This drink was a hit at a small get together with my pregnant and/or breastfeeding friends. I didn't have a 4oz jar of cherries so I substituted grenadine instead.

I used this at a jewelry party at my home and received several compliments. My husband and I enjoyed what was left the next day with some rum added. It's great for kids or as an adult beverage. I might make it again this summer just for evenings on our patio.
