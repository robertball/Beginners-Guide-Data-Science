This tasted like watered down mustard, not to our liking.

I used this sauce with a pretzel crusted pork tenderloin and it was delicious. I added a bit more cream. You should taste before making any changes and adjust it to your palate.

Used this over a pork tenderloin. Next time I might add some sliced mushrooms.

I loved this with a pork tenderloin I made by coating it in 1/4 cup dijon mustard and 1 1/2 tsp of dried thyme.

I actually made this to serve over wild rice patties and I liked it .  I think it would work well on a lot of different things including Brussels sprouts. It was a little thin but other than that, no complaints.

I used a thick plain Greek yogurt mixed with a tablespoon of finely crushed walnuts and it thickened wonderfully!
