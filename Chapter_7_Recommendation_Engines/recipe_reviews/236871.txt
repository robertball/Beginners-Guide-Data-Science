Great recipe. Only change I made was fresh jalapeño instead of green chiles & sriracha sauce instead of hot pepper sauce. Mixed it with habanero salsa after it was finished. I like things hot & this recipe achieved that goal.

This meat was very moist and flavorful, but it was very very hot. .. It mellowed a bit overnite, but still was too much for me. I topped this with some greek yogurt and it was much better. Be careful which types of green chilis you use in this..adjust to your taste. Next time I will use very mild ones and cut back on the hot pepper sauce

So for the time ever on Allrecipes I did not make this exactly as written. Although I like spice I knew this would be way too much for me, so I only used 1/2 cup green chiles and 2oz of hot sauce - everything else I did as the recipe directed. The pork was very tender but I found that it had A LOT of heat (still) and surprisingly, at the same time, had no flavour. Sorry, but this was just not a winner for me.

Great dish. I use jalapeño peppers in place of the chilis. But the balance is the same.  Everyone loves this dish.
