We are no strangers to collard greens in our house, but adding the cottage cheese and spices set it off nicely

I had cottage cheese by chance and I wanted to spice it up a bit, but this was not the best way to do it. I didn't like it personally, I thought the clove taste was a little overwhelming. However, I really enjoyed making something new and stepping outside the box by tasting culturally different foods.

One of my favorite restaurants is Ethiopian, so I always keep an eye out for recipes from this country.  This was fairly dull.  Perhaps the cottage cheese is a little too sharp.
