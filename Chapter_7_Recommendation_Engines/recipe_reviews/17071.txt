Wonderful bean salad!  I prepared the recipe pretty much as written and, although I couldn't measure 1/4 ounce of chopped mint I used about 1/8 cup chopped, fresh mint.  I used 2 cans of drained, white cannelini beans and I used the whole can of artichoke hearts.  It was thoroughly enjoyed by all. It tasted fresh and refreshing.  Next time I may add slivered Kalamata olives instead of ripe olives, hmm...and maybe some crumbled feta on top, too.  A family member suggested I toss in some diced cucumber, too. Nice recipe, Sara.

I made this for a potluck--it was a total hit!  Everyone requested the recipe.  Instead of vinegar I used lemon juice.  I will always keep the ingredients on hand.

I didn't think I liked white beans, but this recipe sounded good, so I gave it a shot, and I'm so glad I did. This was delicious and very filling. I used two cans of artichokes and a can of olives, and I used green onion instead of red because I prefer the milder flavor. The market was out of mint, so I used a touch of fresh rosemary, which has a minty undertone, and extra (fresh) basil. I served this over spring mix, and even with the extra veggies, it didn't need more dressing. Thanks for a new and interesting way to eat white beans!

This isn't bad with some tinkering, but it is not nearly as tasty nor as interesting as I thought it would be when I chose this recipe.  I found a can of cannellini beans was 1-1/2 cups, which worked out perfectly to cut the recipe in half.  I used the ingredients and measurements merely as a guide, tailoring both to suit me.  For instance, I used red bell pepper rather than green, knowing it would add some color. Fresh mint, while I have plenty of it, did not appeal to me at all here, so in its place I substituted arugula.  I used the olive oil and vinegar sparingly, in my preferred ratio of 3:1 oil to vinegar.  I don't necessarily believe that garlic needs to be added to everything to make it taste  better, but I do believe in this instance it might have been a good addition.  I also used fresh basil rather than dried. Still, it was nothing special even though it looked pretty.  With so many lovely and (for the most part) compatible ingredients, I expected this to be much more than just average.

took advice from others and added a can of drained kidney beans for color with 2 cans (drained) of white beans. added more than called for red onion and bell pepper.  also, used two cans of artichoke hearts, drained and quartered.  chillled it for 24 hours and it was really great.

I read this recipe a few days ago and didn't actually refer back to it today when I prepared the salad.  I used the basic idea and adjusted the ingredient amounts to suit my tastes.  I drained and rinsed both the beans and the artichokes (to reduce sodium).  I subbed diced English cucumber for the green pepper and lemon juice for the vinegar.  I omitted the mint, but used fresh parsley and basil.  I made less dressing, also...probably ony about a tablespoon of olive oil and a little less lemon juice.  Still, my salad was very tasty.  I will make this again, even just for myself for lunch.

An improvement on tuna-white bean salad, which never turns out as well as I hope.  Add a little lemon juice to perk it up.

This salad has all the qualities of an excellent Tabbouleh without the health issues associated with wheat gluten and the questionable drawbacks of a GMO.  Instead of being heavy on carbs, the beans provide proteins and has slow digesting "resistant" starch.  Sprouting dry beans and allowing them to grow for two days after first sprout (followed by cooking) would improve the nutritional profile further, as would adding 3/4 cup of cooked quinoa.  A great complex flavor mix.  Next time I will implement these ideas as well as a slight change in the acids by using 1 oz. each of red wine vinegar and fresh squeezed lemon juice.  A cheap wine vinegar should be avoided.  To get a little healthier edge on the dressing, I will use 1-1/2 oz. each of extra virgin olive oil and macadamia nut oil.  If I add the mentioned quinoa, I will increase the vinegar & lemon to 1-1/2 oz. each, and the oils to 2 oz. each.

A huge hit at dinner! Changes: used a whole can of artichoke hearts; couldn't find white beans (that's island life) so I used black-eyed peas and pinto beans; green onion instead of red; lemon juice instead of red wine vinegar; cut down on the olive oil. Next time I'll use fresh basil and definitely let it sit overnight. Green pepper is a must as it adds great crunch. Really fresh, light and healthy!

I love this salad!  I've made it multiple times and the recipe is easily suited to taste.  I use 2 cans of cannelloni beans and one can of garbanzo beans, one chopped vidalia onion, both marinated and regular artichoke chopped, 1-2 cloves of minced fresh garlic and season to taste with the basil, mint and thyme (either fresh or dried)

This salad is just excellent!  I used a mixture of kidney beans, navy beans and chick peas but I am sure any kind of beans would be great.  All of the flavors in the salad go so well together but I really love the mint it it!!

Really enjoyed this one! Used small white beans, red pepper, marinated artichoke hearts (which really are so much more flavorful), also used some of the marinade for the dressing. I did use dried herbs since I had no fresh parsely, and I omitted the mint which I thought wouldn't go with these flavors. Just used a drizzle of olive oil instead of 1/3c and drizzled the red wine vinegar as well. That mixed with some of the artichoke marinade...delicious!

I loved this bean salad and got many compliments on it when I took it to a cookout for Father's Day. I used 2 cans of cannellini beans and 1 can of dark kidney beans for color. I omitted the fresh mint since I didn't have any and substituted green onions for the red. I also used a whole jar of marinated artichokes which in my opinion was needed since I love them! Even after adding the kidney beans I didn't need to increase the dressing... there was still plenty. I probably could have decreased the amount of EVOO to cut calories but didn't this time. This recipe is definately a keeper!

Pretty good. I made it the night before so it had a little time to sit. I made this because I had two extra cans of cannellini beans sitting in my pantry. It was a great way to use the beans. I made this as a side item to go with the Parmesan Orange Roughy. It was a great meal. Thanks.

I skipped the olives and mint and didn't miss them a bit.  The flavor is way better the next day, so try to make in advance.  I filled a lo-carb pita with this mixture for the perfect lunch.

I love, love, love this recipe!  It does taste better after sitting for a day, or even two, but I can rarely make it that long.  Usually it's gone by the next morning!  The only change I've made is to use either Kalamata or tiny Nicoise olives instead of black.  Took this to a party-it was gone in no time.  Yum!!!

I gave this 3 stars for the idea but really it was a 2 for flavor. I loved this idea for the salad - we eat a lot of black bean and corn salads and this sounded like a great change but the red wine vinegar was aweful in this. Too strong and way too much oil. Maybe use Italian Dressing next time?? Dunno

I just made this recipe it's really good! The red wine vinegar taste amazing with the veggies. I'm not a mint or parsley fan so be I added half the recommended amount and increased the green peppers. I also increased the amount of red wine vinegar very tasty and refreshing

I added avocadoes and that was everyone's favorite part. The texture was a little soft and it was hard to get a lot of flavor out of it. I did like the mint.

I loved this.  So did my kids.  I didn't really measure anything.  Just estimated.  It is fantastic and bursting with flavor. It is wonderful as is, but with some imagination you could make several variations- adding tomatoes, pasta, etc.  I plan on making this for my next cookout.  Delicious!!!

This is a good salad, you can play around with the quantities to suit your tastes.  I halved the beans and quadrupled the artichokes.  So I guess my salad should be called "Artichoke and White Bean" instead of the other way around.  :)  I also added about 1/2 of a cucumber and some feta cheese.  Thanks, Sara!

Delicious!!! My family and I really enjoy mediterranean cuisine and this really fit as a side dish to most of our favorites. I personally do not understand why you would add kidney beans. For color just add a little red bell pepper. I think that is what I will do next time, I love veggies.

I'd say this was an average recipe.  I modified it a bit by adding roughly two cups of pasta to the dish - and then used a bit more vinegar to coat.  Probably wouldn't make it again though.

This is a wonderful recipe.  The mint and parsley really make this a flavorful salad.  I used kidney beans in addition to the white beans for some color.  This salad is best when refrigerated overnight to let the flavors meld.  Try it--you'll love it!

The salad was great. I just wish I had had a bit more mint available. My plant was slim picking ...so next time I will add what the recipe calls for. Very colorful and tasty. I used Italian Balsamic vinegar. Tasty.

Served it over a bed of chopped Romaine lettuce  and accented the flavor by adding a tablespoon of Kraft Lite Italian dressing and fresh cracked black pepper.  Also add 2 sliced cloves of garlic and used cannellini beans for the white beans as a modification to the original recipe.

The taste really develops well if set in the refrigerator  for a few days for the flavors to blend. Will add this to my favorite salads list and  will use garbanzo beans (chick peas) for the white beans when I make it again, probably next week.

Soooooooo good!  The only thing different I did was to use cucumbers in place of green peppers as I don't like them.  Very nice summery salad.  Oh!  And I did add a can of kidney beans because they are so good with the white beans.

I brought this to a get-together of friends and everyone loved it.  I can never leave well-enough alone so I modified the recipe a little.  Used one 15 oz can of Cannellini Beans and 15 oz of Kidney Beans.  Used 3 small jars of marinated artichoke hearts, and used the marinade in place of the olive oil.  Used Kalamara olives in place of black. Used green onion in place of red, and added some cucumber.  Next time I'll cut the vinegar in half.

A nice change from the ordinary salad.  Could be used as a holiday or special occasion salad.

I tried this recipe two weeks ago for dinner. It was a hit! I love basil, so I added a bit more than was called for. I also added a bit of red wine vinegar for balance. 
Everyone wanted some of this salad to take home. Fortunately, I had enough! :0)

I was not a huge fan of this, though my BF loved it. I thought the artichoke and white beans together were a bit too mushy. I don't think I will make this again.

I was looking for an artichoke salad recipe and this popped out at me. HOWEVER I was not thrilled with the first try. Red pepper led the flavor in a whole other direction; also, I think the mint spoils it. I used fresh basil and the WHOLE can of artichoke hearts. I agree with the reviewer who said to make it the day before serving, too. Flavors like this need to blend. It's tasty but still needs something....wish I could figure out what!!  Maybe some fresh minced garlic?

Didn't like this one bit. Had high hopes bit it just didn't pan out. The appearance was pretty but that was about it.

Definitely better the next day, but I knew that so made it a day ahead of when I wanted to serve it. I added 1/3 cup of hot banana peppers to it for a little more sing.  Very good.
