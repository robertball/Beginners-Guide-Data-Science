I can't believe this is from a mix! So yummy!!! I was too afraid to add raisins and pecans! But I did everything else and it was fabulous.

Really awesome recipe - everyone I have made this for has really liked it and adopted it - we've been making it for almost 10 years. I do not put in the yellow bell peppers or the golden raisins - never have.

Having never tried either Zaratain's or dirty rice in general I was pleasantly surprised. Fast easy filling & delicious!

Really delicious. Prepared as per recipe and added one large spicy pork sausage sliced 1/2 teaspoon cumin 1/2 can of black beans and roasted pine nuts with the pecans. Couldn't bring myself to add the raisins.

Added some diced large shrimp. It was better than the ground turkey.

I don't care for the pecans in this (just a personal preference I've been tempted to try it with almonds) but the raisins are absolutely delicious in this recipe! Love love love it! (Though now I use the Southern Dirty Rice recipe here on allrecipes as my base.)

My absolute favorite rice dish. I make this for Thanksgiving and Christmas and its always a hit. One suggestion. In place of ground beef swap half ground beef for spicy pork sausage.

We really loved this. I used one whole orange peppper one whole onion and a few shakes of Penzey's Cajun seasoning just to make sure this had some pep for us. I used all the optional things pecans raisins scallions etc. In the future I will add one browned andouille sausage as well. Thanks for the recipe!

I hate it when a recipe is changed my suggestion is just that because the recipe is wonderful without any tweaks. However because we had an abundance of fresh spinach the third time I made this recipe I added a handful chopped and left out the raisins. It added a nice twist to an already fabulous recipe plus some extra vitamins and color..

I used TVP instead of ground beef and veggie bacon instead of regular. Added liquid smoke smoked sea salt pepper and oregano. Garnished with hot sauce. Yum!

A tasty easy meal. Used Chorizo instead of ground beef. Gave it a nice spice. I really liked the raisins in this dish. My husband didn't but he likes fruit with fruit....ha ha.

My family loves this recipe. It use to be on the back of the Zatarain's Dirty Rice box. Glad I found it here! I substitute the raisins with craisins because that is what I had on hand. Delicious!
