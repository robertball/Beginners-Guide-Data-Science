You can disregard the yolk and use 10 white eggs instead. beat it first and then fol in the other ingredients. the cakes will be fluffy and soft.  Fillings are also good like hams or dried fruits.

It was so easy to make. Took 20 minutes in the oven. They were so delicious. I will buy food coloring red and green and make some for Christmas Eve.

for fluffy and sticky puto in our province we use rice flour (also known as giniling na bigas) usually made from malagkit rice. You can also make a Cascaron or bitsu-bitsu using rice flour.

This is so good. I made this today and my mother-in-law brought her friends to our home just to let them try it. I just used 1 1/2 cups of sugar and a drop of vanilla.

I received this recipe from my mom.... lots of memories from childhood so I now make it for my kids.  I used silicone cupcake containers in my steamer.  It was great because the cakes popped right out and I didn't have to grease them as I refilled each container to put back into the steamer.  As for the person who said hers wasn't fluffy... you may want to check the expiration date on your baking powder.  It makes a big difference.

Yes, I tried your recipe, actually twice!. but I'm so very disappointed. It's not what it I expected.The outcome is "tikoy" meaning to say it not look like in your photo. It not raising and the bread is hard not soft. :-( :-( :-(. I do not know what is lacking maybe is your recipe is not right measuring. Thank you for wasting my ingredients. Sorry I just expressing my feeling about the outcome. I think kindly check again your recipe.

Tried this recipe twice already and I like how fast and easy it is to make.  Only adjustment I did was to cut some of the sugar. My husband is a picky eater but he loved this.  Aside form the cheese on top, we spread a little butter too... yummy! Thanks!

I did it today.. But as I go along I realized I don't have evaporated milk on Hand and no milk either.. So instead, I used coconut milk.. And I tasted great as well..

For the steaming it's best to use the smallest solo cups available and filling then 2/3. It will melt but it will make your puto have a nice bottom to where it can sit nicely. Use many food coloring a aswell to give them a variety of different colors.. They come out great in all of these...
