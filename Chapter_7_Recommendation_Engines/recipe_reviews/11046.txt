The max time of baking is 38 minutes, when I checked my brownies they were way underbaked. I then turned my oven up to 350 and baked for about 10 minutes more. I will never use this recipe again

TEXTURE IS GREAT! This is the texture I've been searching for in my brownies all along. I'm giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 only because I thought it could have been just a little bit more chocolatey, but I am a chocoholic. I think next time I will use bittersweet chocolate instead of unsweetened and decrease the sugar by half and see how that works. I took these to work and everyone LOVED them!!

I was going to give this recipe two stars, as I was very dissatisfied with it, but finally after it cooled I decided that it tasted good. I left out the nuts because nobody I know likes nuts. Unless you want the inside of your brownies to be undercooked and gewey, I suggest using a larger pan, because I had to cook my brownies for twice as long as it said to, even though I halved the recipe, and the outsides were getting to be too done but it was apparent that the middle was never going to get cooked. But the end result was very fudgey so if you're into that then by all means have batter-filled brownies when you're done. Also, I found them difficult to cut because the top would just crack off and leave the brownie itself. It also kind of tasted weird; a lot like fudge. Definately not cakey. But overall it tasted good.

This was way too much batter for 2 pans, so I used three.  Not yummy and sweet enough for me, but my husband eats them.

Very good. I purposely underbaked them a bit and then chilled the pan before I cut them so they would be a little more fudgy and they worked out nicely.Thanks for sharing! Reviewed On First Faceless Frenzy Western Allstars 2012

The amount of chocolate is far to low.  My brownies ended up a tan color. This recipe also makes alot.  Def  suggest halving the recipe and doubling the chocolate.
