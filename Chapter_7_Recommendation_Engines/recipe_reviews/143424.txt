Very good. I just have a couple tweaks. I added a few pods of cardamom and a chopped onion to the lamb, and strained the broth after the lamb finished cooking. Instead of jameed el-kasih (VERY hard to find), I used a large tub of whole fat yogurt (blended with abt a tbsp of cornstarch) with the broth, and served it with saffron rice with toasted almonds and pine nuts. Absolutely delish!!

If you don't have goat's milk, use yogurt mixed with some whole milk to thin it out.

This recipe is very good, but my Husband who was born in Kuwait, raised in Iraq and lived in Jordan for 6 years said they serve this dish with more lamb milk broth then this. Also you should have made clear that you do not use a flat platter but rather a bowl shaped dish, so the Pita bread soaks up lamb milk broth. But I was absolutely thrilled to find this recipe as it is hard to find arabic recipes online. Thanks so much. :)

i cooked mensaf many times, i never use olive oil since the jameed (goat's milk) is heavy and the oil might spoil its flavor, i put meat pieces in a large pot with some pepper and one whole onion and one bay leaf, cover it with hot water, as soon as it starts boiling, take out the foam and top, then cover it and let it boil till the meat is almost cooked, then i add the goat milk ( jameed el kasih is not as rich as the original jameed) i use the jameed pieces,i crush them and soak them in water the night before,put them in the blender and then use the colander to make sure it is smooth and clean) let them boil and then simmer till they are well blended and smooth, i cut the pita bread for small pieces, put them around the serving dish, soak them with some Jameed, put the rice over (you can use turmeric to add color to the rice) add meat pieces with bones (some find it culturally offensive if the meat is boneless) , garnish with pine nuts and almonds serve next to the Jameed

I don't use a pressure cooker, but still turns out great.  I use the dried yogurt and soak it the night before. I garnish this with toasted pine nuts, and chopped fresh parsely.

it turned out good, instead of "PITA" i used ARMENIAN LAVASH BREAD which is almost paper thin,  spreader on a flat pan, and rice on top and the meat, pour the JAMEED Yogurt like sauce on to the  and sprinkle the pine nuts and bon appetite 
this food you eat it with your HANDS and no utensils 
GREAT JORDANIAN Traditional Dish that is very easy to make loved it turned out delicious,
