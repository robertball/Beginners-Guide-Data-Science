I baked for 2 1/2 hours to maximize the "sun dried tomato" flavor, I didn't have to drain any juice off the top this way.  As other reviewer suggested added a touch of balsamic.  Absolutely delicious!!

I added basil to the recipe.   This is my base for spaghetti sauce.  Love the garlic smells while it roasts in the oven.  My family LOVES this sauce.

I can't give 4 1/2 stars so 5 stars it is.  Here are my notes to take this over the top.  This needs just a touch of Balsamic Vinegar to make it perfect! Make it at least a day ahead of time to let the flavors meld - drain the tomato juice off the top so it stays thick like a spread should be.  Delicious!

The smell while the tomato mixture is roasting is worth five stars alone!  Excellent flavor. After reading someone else’s review I also tried this as the base for pasta sauce.  We love it!  I didn’t alter the recipe at all.

Awesome spread this version I added cream cheese and used as the T in our BLT's on home made Artisan no knead Bread from AR.
