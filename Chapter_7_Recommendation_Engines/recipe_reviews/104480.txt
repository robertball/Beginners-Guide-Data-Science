I'm sorry. I really do not like to rate a recipe so badly, but there were so many problems.  I made half a recipe. I confirm that it was inedibly burned on the outside edge and raw in the middle.  Started again with another half a recipe. I thought smaller cookies might be better so I pressed 1/4 cup of dough onto waxed paper in a 4" metal egg muffin ring. Removed the ring and waxed paper and placed the dough circle onto the greased pan. 5 circles in a round pizza pan for 15 minutes yielded 5 barely edible burned-on-the-edges cookie triangles that needed to be pulled apart.   Next, reduced heat to 350 and only 10 minutes baking and only 4 cookies on sheet. Eureka! Success at last.  The best was only 3 cookies at a time on the sheet and then the cookies did not touch at all. Each cookie spread to 5 1/2".  The dough is basically a chocolate chip cookie recipe. Again, I apologize, but this isn't the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever tasted. Now granted, I didn't have butterscotch chips, and that would have made a difference to the taste.   Made my own cookie dough recipe, omitting chocolate chips and adding 2 Tbsp cocoa (could have doubled cocoa). Plopped the dough into the metal ring and baked like that. Made 14 thick, 4" cookies that make awesome ice cream sandwiches!

This is devilishly good! The cookie recipe is devine, although VERY geneorous. I cut down the recipe to make enough for 15 serves, yet I still made three giant cookies (so I just made it a triple layered cake instead!). The great thing about this recipe is the adaptability... and it's great fun to eat too!

The dough tastes great but the amount is definitely way too much.  It spilled over the edges while baking and made a huge mess in the bottom of the oven, setting off the smoke alarm in the process.  I pulled the 'cookie' from the oven and it was unbaked in the middle but done on the top.  It wouldn't be all that disappointing if I didn't need this for a birthday party later today.  Plan B:  Buy ready-made dough.
