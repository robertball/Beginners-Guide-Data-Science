I very much enjoyed this recipe, this is a keeper for me. Best cod i have ever had. I could not find ginger paste at any of my local stores so i substituted ground ginger instead, but it still was excellent. One note, the recipe as written is very spicy. I used less than half of the cayenne pepper called for and it was still very spicy. I enjoyed it, but next time i will use even less cayenne pepper for my families sake.

I am so glad I found this recipe. As the editor's note suggested I used a jar of ready made masala I already had (you can find it in almost any grocery store.) I always have it on hand and use it for a quick super w/chicken. I never knew how amazing it would be w/ fish! I only used a 1/2 the jar to marinade the fish and followed your baking instructions! Best Cod I've ever hand! And definatly not boring! Served w/ basmati rice, it was perfect!

Oustanding. Like another reviewer, I couldn't find ginger paste. Instead, I made a paste using crushed ginger and ground garam masala powder. Very flavorful and tasty.

I couldn't find the tandoori paste or ginger-garlic paste.  I added minced garlic and increased a few of the seasonings.  These came out delicious!

was looking for something to spice up the cod supply i have and this was it. dind't have ginger-garlic paste, used equal parts grated fresh ginger and garlic. couldn't find tandoori masala paste, used tandoori masala spice mix. ran short on cayenne, probably used half and it was plenty spicy and we like our food spicy. i also cooked it in the marinade...wonder what it would be like without it. will make this again for sure! thank you for the great recipe.

We loved this as a concept - it was delicious!  I halved the cayenne, as suggested by others, and I would probably tone down the spices next time but we were amazed at a marinated cod that was yummy without being battered and fried.

Delicious.  I mistakenly used 6 T yogurt, but it turned out awesome.  I also cut the cayenne to 1 tsp, and thought it could have used a little more, especially since I was stretching the sauce.   Those were the major changes, other than ditching the garlic, and using some ginger powder.  I used my white wine vinegar and 2 T Garam Masala powder.... that's all i had. And...I did not put the oil/butter on top because there was plenty of sauce to cover the fish.  It was moist, tender and delicious.  I hope I didn't change it too much, but it turned out great.  Thank you for the recipe! (PS  10 minute prep time turned into at 20 mins or more)

Flavor of marinade is overwhelming and way too spicy! In all fairness, I marinaded it overnight. If the marinade were thinner, it wouldn't have coated the fish so thickly and perhaps it would have been more mellow a flavor. I suggested reducing the cayenne pepper to 1/3 of what it says.

As other reviewers mentioned, this recipe comes out REALLY spicy. I followed the advice and used about half the amount of cayenne pepper and still found it quite spicy (and my husband and I are both fans of very hot/spicy foods). I liked the spiciness, but it was definitely intense. I'll probably cut the cayenne pepper even more if I make this again. I couldn't find ginger-garlic paste, but it was easy to just add some ginger and garlic to the dish. I also couldn't find the tandoori masala paste so I substituted a bit of garam masala instead. No idea if that's even a reasonable substitute, but it still tasted good!

Perfection!  I didn't have tandoori masala paste, so I combined 2 Tbsp garam masala, 2 Tbsp cumin, 4 tsp paprika, 1 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp chili powder. Then I took about 1.5 Tbsp of my mixture and added about 1Tbsp water to form paste. Also, like other reviewers, I cut back on the cayenne. I love my food super spicy, but my toddlers can't handle the same amount of heat, so I only added about 1 tsp of cayenne. Very yummy! I think I might even use this marinade for baking paneer or tofu.

An awesome dish and easy to make.  The only thing I would modify is maybe kick back the cayenne pepper to 1 tblsp and work your way up from there.  Even though I was sweating a river off my forehead, it was still a very tasty dish!

My husband loved this recipe, but it was still to spicy for me. I did as others recommended and cut the cayenne pepper in half,  but had to madle a yogurt sauce to cool the pallet. If you really like spicy food This one is for you. Iâ€™m only going to add a teaspoon of cayenne the next time I make it.

Ow! My mouth is on fire. Reread the recipe to make sure I hadn't made a mistake - nope, 2 1/2 Tablespoons of cayenne. Must have done something wrong as my marinade was more of a paste.  If I ever get the courage to try this again I'll cut way down on the cayenne and increase the yogurt. For now, my sore throat has been cauterized and I'm sure any intestinal parasites I might have had have been banished.

We really liked the idea of this and I had all the ingredients on hand., so I made the marinade as written just using less cayenne, let it set for an hour then into the oven.  I sauted some diced onion and a can of diced tomatoes then added some of the marinade for flavor.  I hate to waste marinade and love a bit of sauce when serving rice.  I checked the fish after 30 min and it was certainly done.  If I were to make this again I would cut all the dry spices back by at least half and cut down of the cooking time.  The spice coating on the fish was so bitter/pasty tasting and the fish itself was so overcook ed and dry.

We really liked cod baked this way for something different and will make it again.  I am rating this a 4 instead of 5 because I only used a sprinkling of the cayenne, we like flavorful but not too hot. I substituted some garlic powder and ground ginger for the garlic-ginger paste and garam malsala for the tandoori malsala as some others because I couldn't find those.

There was a lot going on in the marinade but it worked out to be very tasty! Something different I would have not thought to do with Cod. I will make this again. I varied some of the ingredients that I did not have but it still came out with a great taste and not too spicy. This is not a mild recipe but that is why we liked it! It was perfect with lentil soup and we squeezed lemon on both.
