I typically try and follow the recipe exactly but I'll admit that the reviews scared me a bit too much on this one to do that. I went ahead and measured out a cup of barbecue sauce but only added a little bit at a time until I had the perfect consistency. I ended up using right at 3/4 cup and it was perfect. We really enjoyed these burgers. Instead of plain Monterey Jack, I kicked it up a notch with Pepper Jack. Even though I think plain ole tomatoes would have been perfect, hubby doesn't like them so I just added a couple tablespoons of salsa to each burger instead. I think the key to this recipe is to use your absolute favorite bbq sauce and not just any that are on special that week. My sauce of choice is Kansas City's own Gates. These were delish!

1 cup of barbeque sauce was way too much - it made something more akin to sloppy joe's than hamburgers.  The "burgers" crumbled and fell apart from the excess liquid. Due to the weather, I cooked them on the stovetop instead of a grill so perhaps that made a difference, but I'd suggest cutting the bbq sauce at least in half.

The sloppy joes tasted good, but for burgers I would also recommend only 1/2 c. barbecue sauce.

Very very tasty! Here is what I altered though... instead of grilling them I used my electric griddle.  I also used turkey meat instead of beef so I had to put some bread crumbs in it to keep the pattys from falling apart.  Also I only used 1/4 cup of bbq sauce.  Last change I made was I minced the cilantro and mixed with the meat instead of just garnishing the top of the cheese.  Turned out great!!!

I judged how much BBQ sauce to use base on how well I thought the burgers would hold, so probably about 1/2 cup .  I also grounded up a few slices of apple-wood smoked bacon, added saute onions and garlic..What flavor!

Delicious!!!  I love cilantro so this caught my eye.  I mixed up homemade bbq sauce made of brown sugar, ketchup, mustard, apple cider vinegar and  worchestershire sauce. My maid chopped up garlic and cilantro and accidentally added to the sauce.  It came out amazing!!!  Yes they are a little crumbly and you have to be careful but so worth the effort! I reseved extra sauce to put on the bun also.

It's alright. I used ground turkey and some cayenne pepper. Would probably be much better with some chipotle mayo.

I went with this recipe because I had an abundance of cilantro from a small plant. The cilantro and cheese combo is good. In place of the bbq sauce, I used chile sauce (had an opened bottle). I really didn't notice any taste of it. I had close to a lb of hamburg and only used 1/4 cup of sauce. The amount listed seems like a lot, and reviewers mentioned that, as well. I made it into four medium-sized patties and cooked on the stove-top for 4-5 min per side. Had two for dinner with a side of avocado, mustard and pickle relish. Had a half piece of  sour dough bread with it....trying to cut back on carbs.

These have a great taste, though they do tend to fall apart.  I only used 1/2 cup of my own homemade barbecue sauce, and even then the burgers were soft.  But the taste is so good, I know I'll make them again.

These burgers were very tasty. I only used 1/2 cup of the BBQ sauce and added 1 egg to help the beef stick together and not fall apart on the grill. Really excellent summertime recipe because the cilantro adds such a fresh flavor~ thanks for sharing.

I mixed the cilantro into the burgers and eyeballed the BBQ sauce and it was about three-fourths cups. I also used fresh garlic in olive oil .  I also used whole wheat flat bread and a horseradish cheese It was very tasty! ??
