These are fantastic!!  Since there were no reviews I made them exactly as written.  The puffs are light and airy and the filling is delicious. The dijon and hint of horseradish makes the cool filling refreshing.  I will definitely make these again!  Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

I made them for a party.  This recipe makes about 2 dozen, and my plate was empty early on!  I got lots of compliments!  Originally I was just going to use the corned beef spread on Ritz crackers.  The 'puff' part frightened me.  I'm not a baker, and have never done anything with dough besides roll it out of a can.  In reading the puffs recipe, it didn't sound difficult and I had the ingredients on hand,  so I figured why not?  I will tell you the puffs were very easy to make, turned out delicious, and make a terrific presentation when you put this plate down.  The dough is sticky but manageable.  When dropped by teaspoon onto the baking sheet, they tend to have points and irregular shapes.  Not bad, but next time I may try forming them a little bit.   I did add a wee bit more mayo and horseradish to the corned beef, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The corned beef spread is tasty too!  Nice to make it ahead of time too!  Thank you for a super recipe!

You have to try these!  So easy and yet look like you have spent a lot of time preparing them.  I agree, they need more mayo, I used 4T but I like mayo.  I think the puffs would also work with ham, shrimp, egg salad, chicken salad or tuna nicely.  I put about 1 heaping T in each puff.
