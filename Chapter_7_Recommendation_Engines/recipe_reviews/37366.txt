I increased the cinammon and pecans just a little and made this recipe for a church picnic. It was absolutely delicious!!! It was completely devoured before any of the other desserts were even touched. I served it with whipped cream instead of the ice cream which was a tasty option. My kids are begging me to make it again!

this was perfect! i used wheat flour, just because that's what i had on hand, and it turned out great. it was easy to make. but it makes way more than 4 servings. i cut the recipe in half (using only two pints of blueberries) and it served 5 with large portions. maybe it just came up wrong on my computer or something...?

The pecans really added nice flavor to this cobbler. But of course my 7 year old would not have any part of it once he found out about the pecans. But that left more for the rest of us. Very easy to make too.

This was REALLY good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The lattice crust on the top was hard to weave on the hot blueberry mixture.  Next time will probably lay 8x8 crust on top and cut slits to vent.
