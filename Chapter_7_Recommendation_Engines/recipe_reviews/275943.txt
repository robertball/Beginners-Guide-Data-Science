To those wondering how long this lasts....if you let a layer of fat harden on top of the broth, this essentially "seals" the broth from air and it can last several weeks in the fridge. That said, I always use mine up well before then, or I put the extra in the freezer for up to 2-3 months.  If your broth isn't sealed with the fat layer, use within 5 days.

Easy since you don't have to mess with the veggies much.
