I'm close to giving this recipe a 2, which is rare for me.  I'm pretty easy to please.  I will not prepare it again without some modifications.  As is, it's too dry. I may cut the kielbasa in smaller chunks for wider disbursement.  I thought the taste was rather generic, and would benefit from some stronger flavors like garlic, crushed red pepper flakes, etc.

This was awesome.  I have only had this recipe for about a month and I've already made it for three separate occassions.  The only change I made was to use the small size ziti (mini penne). This recipe reheats up very well too..It doesn't get dry at all like some other pasta/sauce dishes do when you try to reheat the next day.

Of course I changed this recipe to coordinate with what I had in the house, and my experience as a personal chef...Reduce (Rigatoni) pasta to 3/4 lb. 1. I used beef polish sausage, and fried it sans the vegetable oil (it has it's own fat to fry in) 3. I then added to the sausage 1 clove of garlic, small onion (chopped finely), small amt. of pepper for taste, parsley, pinch of crushed red pepper and cooked for 5min. I then added 1 jar of spaghetti sauce plus 1 4oz can tomato sauce, and brought to a slight boil...at which time I added 10 small frozen meatballs. Simmered for 15min stirring often. Cut the meatballs in half, and mixed with pasta in 8 by 11 glass . I added a dusting of italian style breadcrumbs, a sprinkling of cheese, and topped with italian pepperoni. Cooked uncovered for 25 min checking often to ensure that it did not dry out. There were no leftovers, and that is saying something in this family. This is an excellent starter recipe. Tweak it to your liking!

I really liked this recipe. Next time I will double the kielbasa though. I used Colby-Jack cheese for a little more flavor.

I found this to be very good! I did take in some of the advice from other reviewers.  I used diced tomatoes with onions and added garlic and red pepper flakes when cooking the kielbasa. Would def. make again.

This was easy and VERY budget friendly but not really a hit with this family. We didn't really care for it. My husband will usually eat what's leftover (by having seconds or sometimes even thirds) but he didn't even want his first helping--which is not a good sign. We won't be trying this again, I'm sorry.

My entire family loved this recipe! I ended up inviting my mom and sister to join
us for dinner, because it made so much. I had to use an 11"x14" pan instead of
the 9"x13" pan the recipe calls for. It was absolutely delicious! I didn't have any
trouble getting my 18-month-old son to eat it! We fixed garlic toast to go with
it.  Yummy!

For the most part I follwed the recipe however i did have to use some substitutions b/c I didn't have exactly what the recipe called for.  I used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce and dried spices and topped w/ italien five cheese instead.  I did however have to use a bigger dish as suggested by others.  My husband and I loved it as well as my 11 month old.  He kept making the yum yum grumble while he ate it.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I used chicken kielbasa w/spinach, and spiral pasta. Added onions, garlic and lots of colby jack cheese on top. My picky boyfriend couldn't say enough good things about it. I was thrilled with the results.

This recipe came out very tasty but I must admit, I deviated quite a bit from the original recipe. I followed some of the advice of the other reviewers and increased the amount of kielbasa. I was all out of ziti so I substituted penne pasta which work just as well.  My picky husband doesn't like tomato chunks, so I ran the tomatoes in the food processor a bit and used 1 can of tomato paste instead of sauce.  I added a lot more oregano for flavor and some minced garlic as well.

It turned out quite yummy and my kids and husband loved it! I'll save this recipe for future use!

Pretty good.  I thought it needed a little more seasoning even after adding garlic and onion though.

This was absolutely delish! My husband and I LOVED this!  I threw in chopped garlic, onion, green peppers and red pepper flakes while browning the kielbasa. Used mozzerella 'cause that's what I had.  So yummy!  This will be a staple in our house.  Thanks so much!

I don't usually modify recipes except I only use fresh ingredients in my recipes. I used my own canned stewed tomatoes (they smell like I just cut up the peppers, onions and tomatoes). I also used fresh parley and basil that I grow. I didn't see any sense in cooking the kielbasa in oil. I just browned it, I put in a lot of fresh garlic and crushed dried hot peppers, and topped with homeade bread crumbs and pepper jack cheese. It was great. Thanks for the this great recipe.

This recipe was really good.  I'm not a big fan of tomato chunks so I did omit the stewed tomatoes as well as add extra cheese and flaked parm on top.  Yum!

I, like most cooks, tweeked it a bit to make it healthier and seasoned to our taste.  Instead of ziti, I used whole wheat rotini and nixed the stewed tomatoes since my husband doesnt care for them, although they would have been great I'm sure.  Instead I used a whole jar of speghetti sauce.  I used turkey brats spiced up with crushed red pepper to make it a bit leaner and it was great!  I sauteed some zucchini with the turkey brats (I added the zucchini when brats were half way done) with a bit a EVOO and fresh garlic.  I also added some sweet basil with the oregano.  After I mixed the meat/veggie sauce with the pasta, I stired in some parmesan cheese.  I also used more monterey jack and mozzerella cheese because, well, we just love cheese.  I think some sauteed onion would have put it over the top... but the husband doesnt like them :/  I think that this recipe would be delicious on it's own but it works as a great template to whatever you have in the kitchen.

This was so easy! Everyone loved it! I used earlier recommendations of adding sliced sauteed onions and minced garlic and used a jar of spaghetti sauce and 1 can of sliced tomatoes drained.

We have a family of 5, and none of us cared much for this recipe. I added sauteed onion, garlic and italian seasoning. Even after adding these, the flavor was much to be desired. I doubt I'll make this again.

My husband and little ones approved, that's what counts! I wasn't sure if I should drain the stewed tomatoes, but I did & it was fine. This recipe makes WAY more than will fit in a 9x13. I made an extra 9x9 pan to freeze.

Possibly the best pasta casserole ever. I added some basil/garlic crumbled feta on top for that extra flavor and it was fabulous! Thanks Bonnie!

This recipe was good, not fantastic the first time.  The second time I made a few revisions and it was a lot better.  All four of my children and husband approved. I used olive oil rather than vegetable oil.I added a chopped green pepper to the pan while cooking the sausage.  I also added 2 cloves of garlic and a bay leaf.  After reading other reviews I used one can of tomato puree (15oz) and a can of diced tomatoes (15oz).  I added half a can of tomato paste as well.  I had more than enough liquid.  In addition to the oregano I also added some basil.  Take others advice too - use a pan bigger than 9 x 13.

It was great however, mine was a little dry. Just a little. I used spagetti sauce and used 1 1/2 jar! So I suggest 2 jars. Also I used 1 cup parmesian cheese.  And I didn't have any stewed tomatoes. But the Spagetti sauce I used had tomatoe chunks, and peppers and green onions. It still tasted Great. I will make this again!

I left off the t'matos and added some stuff like cilantro and fresh basil.  It was good and had a unique flavor.  Would make again.

This was a great dish ~ even my two extremely picky boys ate it up, one even asked for seconds!!!  It was quick to throw together and was packed with flavor.  We will definitely be having this one again and again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe isn't bad, it's not fantastic either but we would have it again. We followed the recipe very closely. Used spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce, and added garlic. Next time I plan to add diced green peppers, they would go really good in this casserole.

I changed it up a bit - used rotel tomatoes instead of stewed, tomato soup instead of sauce and added a package of lipton onion soup mix, and pano crumbs instead of italian-style (used with I had in pantry)

OOhh, I so loved this recipe. I had to work with what I had on hand. I used egg noodles, cheddar cheese soup mix, milk, diced tomatoes, minced garlic, and chopped onions and added shredded colby jack cheese.

This recipe was just "ok".  I think the ingredients are great except for the kielbasa sausage.  I think it would be great with Spicy Italian Sausage instead.  The kielbasa flavor was just too strange a taste with the rest of the ingredients.

I used regular pasta sauce and it wasn't enough liquid. The pasta was dry. Definitely add more Kielbasa and I would agree with someone else that you cut it into smaller peices to spread out the flavor. Maybe add some cheese to the pasta. I'll have to make it a second time to see how it turns out. This recipe might be more like a 3 1/2 star but could improve with modificiations!

I made the recipe as written except cutting it in half because I live alone. I used 2 cups pasta, 3/4 lb Kielbasa sausage, 14.5 oz can stewed tomatoes with basil and oregano, 8 oz can of tomato sauce, Italian seasoning, parsley, 1/4 cup bread crumbs and 8 oz of the cheese. One thing for certain, the recipe as written WILL NOT fit in a 13x9 pan. Mine fit perfectly. The only addition was some red pepper flakes because I like the added kick and flavor. My friend and I loved it. Will definitely make again and again. This was also my very first time having Kielbasa sausage. Yummy!

My husband raved about this. I usually try to stick to the recipes if I am going to leave a review but this was so good I had to share. I used 1 can diced tomatoes instead of stewed ( I didn't have any stewed on hand) and added 2 tsp knorr chicken flavor bouillon, I also added 1 tbsp Italian seasoning. With the topping I combined the bread crumbs , mozzarella shredded cheese and a 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Mixed and poured that on the top. I also used a very high quality local made, small polish sausage links. It turned out wonderful and my husband asked if I could please write down the exact way I cooked it so that we could have it again!

I thought the recipe was easy and good. I tweaked the sauce with what I had on hand.  Used 1 can tomato sauce, 2 cans diced tomatoes, 1 can paste. Added garlic salt but fresh would've been better. Also added red pepper,  red pepper flakes and dash cayenne.  My hubby loved,  my daughter  thought it was a bit too spicy.  

This meal screams for garlic bread and a big glass of milk....or red wine!

This was very good.  I added chopped onions and garlic to the kielbasa while cooking it.  I also used olive oil.  My advice is to add pasta slowly because you may not want to use all of the 16oz.  Otherwise it can turn out dry.

My boyfriend, picky eater friend and picky eater 3 year old loved this. I used kielbasa, but next time will use sweet Italian sausage (For no other reason than I like it better than kielbasa!) and add more meat.

This was alright...my only problems were that it was too salty and also didn't have enough meat. There is plenty or room to switch things up if you like to do your own spices.

Even with garlic and crushed red pepper my husband and I both thought this recipe was way too bland.

Whole family gave this recipe a thumbs up. I don't like stewed tomatoes, so I used Italian diced  tomatoes instead. I also added fresh garlic.

A nice change from my kielbasa and kraut. I made a few changes that stepped it up the second time around.  I added a crushed potato chip topping for some crunch.  I used 2 cans of diced  tomatoes with garlic and oregeno and only one can of stewed tomotoes- gave it more flavor and cut down on some of the juice.  I also took the advise of others and used more meat and cut it into smaller pieces (you'll need a larger dish though).  This recipe is a keeper!

This was just okay. Everyone ate it but it didn't knock your socks off. It is a nice meal for a night that I need to throw something together quickly.

Recipes was yummy... but after it was cooked, it seemed like there was way too much pasta. We have a family of 6 and we didn't even eat half of this recipe. I'd recommend spliting the pasta in half or double the amount of kielbasa.

Also - I think it needs a little more spice to it... maybe some red pepper, dried onions, and garlic. (I also threw in some cinnamon to give it a slightly sweet taste)

This was a little bland but could be easily kicked up a notch by adding spices of your choice.

This was so-so. Can't even imagine putting in more than one can of tomatoes or more than one can of sauce - it never would have fit in a 9x13. I forewent the breadcrumbs - seemed a wasted ingredient. Even though everyone ate some, I don't think I'll make it again.

This was good. It is a nice new way for me to use kielbasa and to spice up the plain old pasta dish. I don't think it is one that you can make too often, though.

This wasn't a hit, unfortunately. There was way too much tomato sauce, and the breadcrumbs turned out rather wet and sloppy. Thanks anyway.

My husband loved this!  It was very good and really easy.  It makes a ton - plenty of leftovers!  I used a big jar of Prego Spaghetti Sauce and turkey kielbasa (maybe a little more healthy!) 
Thanks!  This one goes on "the list"!

I was in the mood for some baked ziti but, had not thawed any meat. I did have a kielbasa I needed to use so, needless to say this recipe solved both my problems. It was a great alternative! I did alter it depending on what ingredients I had or did not have on hand. I literally found this recipe a couple of hours before I needed to make dinner. The whole family was very pleased. Thanks!

This recipe was good and easy to make. The only change that I made was that I added 2 pounds of polish sausage because my husband loves it. I didn't add the all the stewed tomatoes because it just looked like to many for me. Other than that I would make this again for company or when I am in the mood for something different.

Served this at a casual dinner party; it was well received. The smoky sausage flavor made a nice change from the usual pasta-tomato recipes.

It makes a lot--I cut the recipe down a bit having read in reviews that the portions are generous.
