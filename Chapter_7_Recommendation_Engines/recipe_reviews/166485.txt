Oh my.  YUMMY!  I did make a couple of changes, but this is wonderful!  I added 1 yellow pepper, chopped, and used Garam Masala instead of the invididual spices..about a tsp and a half.  And I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of fresh, since my garden is a bit slow this year.  I used chicken stock instead of water.  This one will be a regular for me.  
UPDATE:  I have made this so many times since I first reviewed...at least twice a month.  It was the dish that convinced my carnivorous husband that going veg would be a possibility.  For those who mentioned coconut powder, it is available at Asian markets, but if you cannot find, processing shredded coconut (unsweetened!) for a few seconds will give you a good substitute.  It's best to me with french lentils as they have a really nice meaty texture, and I like over brown basmati rice, but my hubby likes the quinoa.  It's even better left over when the flavors really meld.  LOVE this one!!

I made this again recently and added a few tablespoons of fresh ginger. It really improved it. 
Is it lame that I gave my own recipe five stars? Ha ha ha.

I love this recipe.  I can't stop making it.   I thought it needed a bit more crunch, so I tired a couple things and found that dry-roasted pistachios add the perfect texture to it.  I serve it with bowls of cilantro, pistachios, and shredded coconut on the table so people can sprinkle on however much they want of each.  It's a big hit. I also added the extra can of coconut milk, chopped fresh ginger, and a half teaspoon of ground cinnamon in addition to the stick.   To give it some heat, add a few dashes of hot chili sauce--my favorite is Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce, the kind with the rooster on it that you might find at a Chinese or Thai restaurant. Enjoy!

This recipe turned out delicious!  I kept the seasonings pretty close to what the recipe called for, being inexperienced in flavor combinations such as this one.  I did have to make some changes though: omitting coconut powder altogether (didnt have any), using brown sugar for the molasses (can't even taste it in there) and using canola oil to saute the onion (didn't have coconut oil either).  The lentils needed more liquid during cooking, so I added an extra can of coconut milk slowly, as needed while cooking.  Oh and I've never used quinoa & couldnt find that either, so I served it over couscous.  It turned out to be an excellent vegan dish!  To the reviewer who said this turned out flavorless: you must be doing something wrong, because it would be hard for it to be more full of flavor.  Yum yum!
P.S.  The coconut & curry combo reminded me of the "Bang-Bang chicken & shrimp" dish from the Cheesecake Factory... I sort of like this one better because it's not as spicy and I think the flavors come together better!

This is a good recipe, but I'm taking off a star because a tablespoon is WAAAY too much salt in this recipe. I had to add another can of coconut milk just to balance out how salty it tasted. 

I made this with a few modifications as well. I didn't have any coconut oil or powder, but it tasted fine just using coconut milk and vegetable oil (I'm all about keeping the flavor, but I like to keep things thrifty since I'm a college student). I also added a bit of brown sugar into this and used a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes (five tomatoes seemed like a bit too much, plus I like the flavor or canned tomatoes in curries..the flavor seems more concentrated and holds up well to all of the spices used in Indian cooking).

I think next time I will add some cayenne pepper to spice this up. Also, if you don't have quinoa ( I couldn't find any) simple white rice works nicely and soaks up all the coconut liquid. It was quite good with these modifications and I didn't break the bank. Also, this is very filling...I could barely finish my first helping!

I use this site all the time and this is the first recipe that was so good I had to put in a review for the first time.  My husband and I have been talking about it all week and we already want to make it again.  I didn't use the coconut powder and it turned out perfect...

This was very easy to make.  Needs longer cooking time and about 3 times as much water if using regular brown lentils.  Because of the amounts of spices it tasted a little bitter and dry.  I tried to solve that problem first by adding brown sugar which helped a little.  Then lemon juice from half a lemon, better.  Finally added most of a jar of tomato paste.  That was the winning ingredient.  Made it bright and yummy.  After dinner we went for an hour long walk.  Took a bite of the leftovers and they were way better.  The flavors needed time to blend and the sauce thickened.  Would be worth making ahead of time.  Will definitely make again.  Used one can of tomatoes next time may use two!

Who knew I had already made this before.  I guess I totally forgot.  This time I liked it better.  Here's what accounts for that: used the red lentils rather than brown, used really high quality curry powder.  Topped with toasted unsweetened coconut, cilantro and toasted cashews.  Still needed the tomato paste and would be better with lemon (I see I tried that last time).  Funny I totally forgot this one.

We love this! My husband and I are not vegitarians - and we LOVE this!  The soft curry flavor fills every recess of the mouth with yum!  We had no idea what coconut powder was, so we just used unsweetened shredded coconut.  Thanks!

This was really delicious!  I couldn't find coconut powder, so I left it out.  The lentils took a lot longer to cook than 20 minutes... more like 40. But once it was done, my boyfriend and I loved it!

Overall this is pretty good.
I did find the tbsp of salt for the quinoa was too way much - probably try cooking w/o any next time. The flavors from the curry should be sufficient without having to season the quinoa.

I used regular lentils and it took a lot time to cook - at least 1 hour during which I kept having to add water (lost track of how much water I added - probably 2 or more cups) and constantly stirring to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pot. I looked up how to cook lentils in general and noted that older lentils will take longer to cook because they have lost more moisture. Mine was sitting around for a while and could be the reason why it took forever to soften. Further acidic ingredients such as wine or tomatoes can lengthen cooking time. Will probably try using canned lentils next time to shorten the cooking time or use a slow cooker and leave it overnight. Another thought is to use a dutch oven and cover the stew which may help cook the lentils faster w/o having to keep adding more liquids....

Delicious.  I just wanted to keep eating and eating!
And definitely tastes even better the next day... yum!!!
A note about cooking lentils: adding salt to your lentils before they have finished cooking causes them to harden and take much longer to cook.  This could be why some people have had trouble with their lentils taking so long...mine were done in about 25 minutes.
Skimming the other reviews, I added bell peppers, chopped fresh ginger, double the molasses (I like sweet curry), and half the coriander.  Adding cashews while serving gave it a fantastic nutty, crunchy, occasional burst of salty goodness.    I think it's safe to say you'll need to double both the water/broth AND the coconut milk in the curry...at least I definitely had to...

Wow, this was my maiden voyage using quinoa and I was very impressed!  I basically followed the recipe, but I didn't have coconut oil so I just used olive oil which worked just fine.  I only used one cup of quinoa as per other's suggestions and instead of so many tomatoes, I used a large can of crushed tomatoes, as well as half a fresh one.  I also didn't have molasses or coconut powder so just omitted those.  Instead of water, I added a cup of chicken broth (so I guess this wasn't a meatless dish afterall!)  In addition to the curry powder I also added a couple teaspoons of garam masala and instead of cinnamon stick I instead used ground cinnamon.  I used a large can of lentils, but not red ones.  When it was cooked I thought it was lacking a little substance so added some frozen carrots, corn and green beans, and believe it or not, it worked!  So delicious!  Thanks!

Loved this with a few changes.  I sauteed the onion and garlic with 3 T minced ginger and then added all the spices to the above before adding the tomatoes.  I used:
• ½ t cinnamon
•  1 tablespoons curry powder 
•  3 tablespoons coriander seeds, ground 
•  1 tablespoons ground cumin
•  3 tablespoons ground cardamom and then, added last 1 T red curry paste.  You might have to add a little oil to this to keep it from burning, but it does give more flavor to the dish. Would have loved to grind all the spices freshly, but Coriander seeds were all the seeds I had on hand. Next time!   I used a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes rather than fresh ones which worked well.  Finally, I used 1 can of lowfat coconut milk and one can of coconut cream which I had on hand.  I would go for 2 cans of lowfat next time because it was a tad bit sweeter than I would have liked. Still used the cinnamon stick and the cup of water, but I also used 3 c of red lentils.  Finally, I did add the cilantro at the end.  I served it over Basmati rice and sprinkled it with toasted dry cashews.  I also serve banana wheels (banana's cut into 1 1/2 inch pieces, skin on) and yogurt.  Got rave reviews from my spouse!

I really like this recipe, and it's a great vegetarian option that fills you up.  I found the flavors to be a little subtle (I like my curries with a kick!), and next time I will be sure to add in some extra red pepper flakes and maybe up the spices a bit.  I used fire-roasted diced tomatoes to save time, and I halved the recipe but still used a whole can of lite coconut milk. Yum yum yum.  This reheats very well, just make sure to not overcook the lentils otherwise they will turn to a mush.

I made this on a camping trip - prechopped all of the veggies (and added in leeks because we happened to have a bunch sitting in the fridge) and pre-measured out all of the seasonings into one little container. Also used couscous instead of quinoa for faster cooking and less camp fuel useage. This was a HUGE hit with everyone and fed 6 hungry campers with everyone getting their fill. I used ground cinnamon b/c I didn't have stick - just eyeballed that, and 2 cans of diced tomatos with chiles b/c bringing fresh tomatos camping just doesn't work.  Economical to make and seriously, everyone raved about it. And I'm not even a good cook. Bravo!

This was really good. After reading reviews I served it over brown rice instead of quinoa. I also don't know what coconut powder is, but i added some unsweetened flaked coconut to it. A little cayenne pepper and more coconut milk made this dish complete.

Unfortunately I think it was the quality of the curry powder I chose for this recipe. I'm not sure what makes a good curry powder exactly, only that I was hoping for something that tasted like my favourite Indian restaurant and instead got something spicy-bland. While I love quinoa, I think basmati is the way to go based on texture.

Yes people, vegan can be hearty AND delicious.  We're not vegan (or even vegetarian) but my girlfriend and I loved this recipe!  It definitely makes a lot of food so be prepared for leftovers if you're not feeding a large group!  

Two comments for others making this dish:

1. If you love coconut flavor you might want to do something to kick it up a notch.  We used the coconut oil, coconut milk and coconut powder (2x what recipe called for), but were left wanting even more coconut flavor.  Not sure what the best choice is to give it a strong coconut flavor, but we'll be exploring that the next time we make this dish.

2. If you've got someone to help you prepare the meal, don't make the quinoa at the very beginning of prep.  It just ends up sitting around waiting for the main dish to be completed.  Have your cooking partner make the quinoa as you're putting together the main stew.  This will save prep time and be easier to keep the quinoa warm.

We're excited to make this dish again because it can be so easily altered to anyone's tastes!  It's a stew so add some more veggies you like or a favorite protein.  It's hard to go wrong!

This is one of my new favorite recipes. I used jasmine rice instead of quinoa and I ground up shredded coconut in the blender because I did not have coconut powder. I also added 1 tsp of garam masala to the spice mix and used 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon rather than the cinnamon stick. Thank you for sharing :)

I made this tonight after seeing the recipe featured on Facebook- I've been so excited to try it!  Some changes I made were- sub'd 1 can fire roasted tomatoes and 1 can regular diced tomatoes (with juices), I used coconut Flour instead of powder, and added in some ground cinnamon in addition to the stick. I omitted the cilantro since I didn't have any on hand.
All in all- this turned out well.  I did run a teeny bit short on Curry powder- and it was definitely lacking in "spice" at the end of cooking (yes- it was BLAND! Gasp!) , so I added a generous amount of Tandoori spice and WOW- definitely kicked it up a notch and satisfied the spice craving! Haha.  My lentils never really got soft, even after extra cooking time, and due to this I feel they really overwhelmed the dish.  Next time I will use about 1/2 the lentils this calls for. I also grilled about 3 chicken breasts and hand-shredded them into the stew since we do like our meat. :)
I agree with previous posters that this would be really good over brown rice, but the quinoa was a nice touch.  
*Note- this makes A LOT of food!!  For just 2 of us, I easily could have used only 1/4 of the recipe and still had leftovers so just be aware!  
This was really good and I do intend to make it again! Thanks!!

My husband's new favourite lentil recipe.  I took the advice and used canned tomatoes and chicken stock for the water, garam masala was the best spice choice!  Thanks Lindsay!

I used canned lentils, so I omitted the water.  I added the lentils at the end, when the stew was the thickness I like.  I added dark brown sugar instead of molasses.  I blended shredded coconut to make it like a powder.  Thanks for a great recipe Lindsay!

I love this recipe. And so have all of my friends/family who have tried it. So simple and delicious. I use red quinoa instead of white, for a an extra earthy, nutty dimension to the dish.

DEE-LISH-US!!  Dare I mention that I used a can of diced tomatoes and instead of the spices I used 3 tbsp of tandoori masala?  It was so delicious - my seven year old and 12 year old boys both loved it, and in fact my 12 year old asked for seconds and took a helping in his lunch (which I made with brown rice since we had eaten all of the quinoa for supper).  First time any of us had eaten quinoa but I will most definitely make this dish again...and soon.

I'm a vegetarian and I liked it, by my omnivorous family asked me to NEVER make it again. They ate the quinoa to be polite.

Curry wasn't to my liking but the quinoa was great (had never had quinoa before). I found the curry portion generally lacking in flavor, but then again, I cook a lot of authentic curries. Followed the recipe except that I made my own coconut powder and replaced the molasses with dark sugar.

I liked this a lot and it gave the kitchen a wonderful smell as it cooked. Needed extra spice - I added red pepper flake and extra curry powder. Increased the lentils to beef it up.

This was really good and very filling. I did not have coconut oil and just used olive oil. I found that it needed about double the amount of molasses called for to cut the bitter flavor. I will definitely be making this again.

I thought it had great flavors and was an easy way for me to use up my red lentils and newly bought coconut oil! I will definitely be making this again, but with a couple changes. I like my gravy dishes to be more liquidy, so I will only add a cup of lentils to maintain the flavor ratio without adding more tomatoes. Chicken broth was substituted instead of water and I added a TBSP of butter for silkiness.  I think I will try making it with sliced chicken in the future too.

This is really good, I personally loved it.  My four kids ages from 3-12 all really liked this and they are really picky.  My husband even liked it and he is not a lentil fan.  I only used 1 tsp of salt for the quinoa and I used green lentils added 1 c water and cooked for an hour.  The lentils were not mushy - just right.  I will make often.

Really good base for a curry dish.  Never had cooked with coconut oil, which was amazing.  I always add the spices to the cooking veggies.  Added carrots, green pepper and chopped jalapeno.  Threw in a heaping spoon of tomato paste for flavor and color.  VERY TASTY.  Lentils vary in cooking time, but realize that they continue to cook in the hot liquid.  30 minutes and then remove as a rule.

I just made this. I started with 1/2 the recommended molasses and put a tone of ginger, I also used red curry past and made it extremly spciy. 

i cut up the cilantro and mixed in with the quinoa and a touch of olive oil. YUMMMO. Absolutely fantastic.

I didn't love this.  Compared to other curries, I found the flavour flat.  It's not that it wasn't flavourful, it just wasn't multi-dimensional.  Maybe could be helped by a 'sour' element (ie. lemon juice)? I like the idea of a lentil stew, but would probably alter it quite a bit in the future.

Loved this recipe!! Followed for the most part, with these small changes:

omitted coconut powder
substituted coconut cream for coconut milk
substituted veggie broth for water
substituted raw honey for molasses
added red bell pepper
added minced fresh ginger

And it turned out incredible!! Thanks for a great recipe. :) I'll definitely be making this one again and again!!!

I made some mistakes, but it was still great!   I substituted green lentils, then accidentally used the whole bag instead of two cups.  I was suspicious that the lentils would not cook in 15 minutes, and they didn't.  It took the lentils 40-45 minutes to get tender, and I had to keep adding hot water, diluting the flavors, so then I added more curry and coriander as well.   Next time, I will pre-cook, or maybe, even pre-soak the lentils - even though I know you are not supposed to have to pre-soak them. I plan to buy more coconut milk to mix with the batch of lentils I have then freeze some of them.

This was fabulous. I didn't really change anything except omitting the coconut powder (didn't have any) and I used a large can of diced tomatoes. I'm pretty sure you don't need the coconut oil either, olive or canola or whatever you have on hand  would probably work. 

My husband ate his with hot chili sauce and I had mine with fresh lime juice. A little really does go a long way- it's filling! We both loved it.

Even cut to half this recipe made quite a bit; I hope it freezes well!

Thanks Lindsay, this one is a keeper!

This is definitely easy to make. It was good, but I found the coriander to be a little overwhelming. I could barely taste the coconut or curry through it. Next time, I'll try just 1 teaspoon coriander to let the other flavors shine through.

Very delicious! I added in 2 chopped sweet potatoes, and a few cloves of minced garlic. I will only add one cup of lentils next time, as it had no liquid left (I had to keep adding liquid). It may have been because I didn't use red lentils (which cook faster than regular lentils). Anyway, this is an awesome recipe. Thanks!

This is a great dish! I never would have thought that pairing lentils and quinoa would be good, but it's a very hearty dish, you don't need much to fill yourself up.   I did make some modifications. A tbsp of salt in the quinoa is WAY too much...don't use any. I used powdered cinnamon instead of a stick, eliminated powdered coconut and molasses, because I didn't have any and didn't want to spend the money on it. I also added a little chili powder for a bit of spiciness.   The only problem I had was that it takes WAY longer than 10-15 min. for lentils to cook to the point where they're not hard. It took 35-40 min. and an extra cup of water. I used regular lentils...I don't know if they cook differently than red lentils.   Otherwise it was great!

My husband loved this (and he hates the idea of eating vegetables and quinoa). I did make a few minor changes to the recipe: 1. I added some chicken stock to the stew 2. I added about a tablespoon of Indian Masala seasoning 3. I used canned tomatoes (simply because I was out of fresh ones) 4. I used chickpeas instead of lentils (because that's all I had) 5. I added about a tsp of sugar to help offset the bitterness of the tomatoes  It was wonderfully delicious. I highly recommend you try :)

This was pretty good. The only thing I would do change would be the amount of coriander. Maybe 1 tbs. instead of 2.  Maybe the creator meant tsp. It was a little to aromatic for my liking.  I also added some frozen chopped spinach and ginger and used a can of chopped tomatoes with green chiles (Trader Joes). It came out quite yummy. I bet it would also be good done with chickpeas instead of lentils.

Excellent base recipe. Made it exactly as it said. A bit bland overall, but very tasty, all organic ingredients, everything meshed well between them. Suggest a bit of tamari over the top and a couple of cayenne chili's to heat it up. Lime added to the cilantro makes this dish incredible.

Great meal. I follow the recipe with a few exceptions. I couldnt find the coconut powder as well, so i used 1.5 tsp of coconut flavoring and about 1/4 a cup of medium shaved coconut shavings I found in the bulk section in whole foods. I also add about 1/2 c  more water to the lentils as they were cooking. Lastly, I added 3/4 lbs of shredded chicken. Served over Quinoa. This is a great recipe. Look forward to making it again. I will take the suggestion and add 2 tbl of ginger and add some peppers as well. Thanks!

This was good - and I will definitely make again - but with some tweaks...  We found the tablespoon of salt too much for the quinoa - so would definitely reduce that.  Also, the lentils took much longer to cook - and required more liquid.  But all in all a great recipe!

This is one of my favorite recipes to make, thank you for getting me started!  I now use slightly different spices and also find my lentils need to cook longer.

Easy and good.  Mine required much longer cooking time but besides that, followed recipe.  Can't wait to share with a friend for dinner.

Very yummy recipe! Used 2 cans light coconut milk due to yellow lentils. Used canola oil (didn't have coconut oi) Used split yellow lentils (instead of the red because all I had were split red lentils and they would have turned to paste) and a can of fire roasted tomatoes since I didn't have fresh in the house.  Added a dash of cayenne pepper to heat it up a little. Very satisfying, very delicious restaurant quality lentil dish!  An inexpensive way to eat ethnic!  You can get the powdered coconut at any of the Indian/Pakistani type grocery/specialty stores and its well worth it!   Keep these items in your pantry for when you are shut in, or not in the mood to cook a big production meal. I call these my "pantry meals" for when I have not had time to run to the store, at least I always can make a delicious dinner with things I have on hand!  DO MAKE THIS RECIPE!

Great recipe, and an excellent base to work from when you need to use up other veggies.  I've included celery, cauliflower, pumpkin, etc.  The latest I made without quinoa or lentils, and it is still a hit.  Follow as-is (the author's recommended ginger in her review improves the dish), or use it as a template to make your own creation.  Thank you Lindsay L!

What a disaster!! The lentils took FOREVER to cook and the dish as a whole never came together. I could not tasty the coconut (which I was so excited about) and overall a massive disappointment. I ended up having to throw out the whole lot, which breaks my heart. I don't even consider it worth another go.

Great recipe, Lindsay! I was making something similar but had not thought to add the molasses- thank you for that! It is better with molasses. I like to throw in even more veggies (never a bad thing) i.e. celery, zucchini, carrots, and whatever else tickles my fancy that day. I agree with your below comment RE: adding ginger. Now I'm looking forward to seeing if you have other recipes :)

Love the flavor used regular lentils and it took so incredibly long, like hours for the lentils to soften. ANd I added so much more liquid than the recipe called for

Instead of lentils I used black beans- instead of fresh I  used canned tomatoes- didn't use coconut powder - added carrots and spinach- still turned out really flavorful!

Used stewed tomatoes and olive oil as substitutes.  Added tomato sauce to cut down the sweetness of the coconut milk.  Hubby loved it and it paired well with the quinoa...a nice change from the standard rice.

We loved this! The only ingredient I couldn't find was coconut powder. I made it without the powder and it still tasted great! Even my almost 2yo gobbled it up. I did size the recipe down to six servings and IMO 1 cup of quinoa was still too much. I marked it down for myself that I'd cook 3/4 of a cup to make six servings. This dish is tasty and sweet and easy to make.

Incredibly flavorful and easy to prepare.  Whole Foods carries the coconut oil, which is actually in a jar and a solid white (not in fact an oil). Couldn't find coconut powder so used shredded coconut aslo from Whole Foods.  Took the advice of another reviewer and used Trader Joes can of diced and fire roasted tomatoes w/green chilis.  Each and every ingredient stands out and works together in perfect haromony.  We LOVED this dish!!!!!!

I couldn't find coconut powder so I omitted and it was delicious. I would add some kosher salt while it's cooking to bring out more flavor. Works great with the quinoa although /you don't need asuch as thus recipe calls for.

Really excellent recipe.  I halved it, but then omitted the water and used the whole can of coconut milk.  I added some coconut instead of powder and used green onions.  I made my quinoa in my rice maker (2 to 1 water:quinoa) with a broth cube, though I will only use half a broth cube in the future.   I also used canned tomatoes that had been run through a processor (I don't like chunks) and only one cup (for the halved recipe, but I could have used more, I suppose).  I don't know why someone would say this is flavorless.  It's not so hard to add more curry!  I just eyeball everything anyway, and maybe I added a bit more molasses, which I really think makes it wonderful.  Great recipes, and gluten free!

**update: I have recently made this again, and my halved version is a pint of tomatoes, no water, and a whole can of coconut milk.  For our leftovers, we ran out of rice and so had it in tortillas (curritos, we call them) and that actually might be my preferred way to eat this from now on.

This recipie is a modification of a traditional Ty curry calleda Masaman Curry.  It was pretty good, but I made a few modifications.  I used Adzuki Beans instead of Lentils which is a traditional Japaneese bean. I skipped the Coconut Powder, and added Eggplant and Yellow bell Peppers. I also changed the main spice to Garam Masila instead of Curry, added Mint, and more Cinnamon, as well as a touch of Lime juice.     In addition I made the Quinoa with Vegetable Broth, and a bit of the broth from the curry. It turned out good, but a bit bland, and I think I used a little too much Cayenne.

It tasted good a first, but by the end we felt bloated and a bit ill. There is too much spice in this, not hot, but just too much, especially the Coriander. Maybe a couple of teaspoons would have been ok. We all ended up feeling sick into the next day after eating this.

This was a great recipe. The family loved it, even my daughter who is very picky. I did change some things like I added some veggies and tofu. I did not have a cinnamon stick so I use grounded cinnamon. I used stewed tomatoes. We just ate it plain without Quinoa. This was great. This goes on the list to make again

The lentils and the quinoa did not go well together, since both have a similar texture.  Also, I thought this was very tastless.  I did not use the coconut powder since I did not have any, but still, I thought this was pretty bad.  A big disappointment.

Use a stock pot or large skillet with high sides for the lentil portion. For the quinoa, 3 1/2 cups was a lot of liquid. I turned it to super hot to boil off the liquid after the 15 minutes of simmering. Garlic and onions took about 20 minutes before turning translucent.

The lentils were too crunchy for my taste. Next time, I will wait to add tomatoes until after lentils have been simmering about 20-30 minutes. Acidity keeps the lentils crunchy even after they are fully cooked.

I love this recipe so much I will be adding it to my list of healthy vegan entrees that my whole family will eat. The flavors are amazing. Couple changes: I used organic veggie broth instead of water for the stew, and it took much more than 1 cup of liquid to soften those lentils (as well as more cooking time). As suggested, I stirred a lot to make sure they didn’t stick. I added turmeric because why not?! Absolutely loooved it!

Lentils would not cook in 10-15mins, or with the amount of liquid in the recipe.  I had to at least double the water (I used broth), and then cooked for at least 45mins, stirring often!  I wonder if this recipe was meant for adding precooked lentils?  Flavors were wonderful, once I added enough salt (about 1/2 Tbs).  (I feel like the coconut powder is optional/not necessary.)  Added about 1/2 Tbs of Marsala to give it a bit of a kick.  Once made, the whole family scarfed it up!!

Second time making it I had to use 4 cups of liquid with constant stirring. Also used 2 cans diced tomatoes instead of the fresh

I made it one time I loved it I use parsley instead of cilantro because I don’t like cilantro taste like soap to me. I will make this dish again because I thought it was delicious. I like well seasoned dishes and I will make it for my friends I’m sure they will love it.

Good Lord I'm a good cook.  I used one 28oz can of San Marzano Style tomatoes instead of the 5 fresh tomatoes, added a little can of tomato PASTE, and instead of the 3.5 cups water for the quinoa, used 3.5 cups of unsweetened Coconut Milk.

I added coconut flakes because I didn't have powder and also used light coconut milk. Lots of flavor and makes the taste buds happy!

Used some coconut spread Heidi gave me to saute onions.  Subbed brown sugar for molasses.  Powdered some shredded coconut (yes, it was sweetened) in food processor.  Didn't really quite powder it, and probably added at least double the amt.  Only added 1 1/2 c. lentils.  Added 1 can full fat coconut milk to start with and slowly added another can lite coconut milk over the cook time.  I even added some coconut extract at the end.  Still wasn't as coconutty as I would like but Kenny actually said he could taste it a little bit so I guess that was something. :) Also added  1 tsp. my own homemade garam masala.  Added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon instead of cinnamon stick. Subbed some low salt chix broth for water.  Used red curry paste instead of powder.  Also subbed 1 can no salt added tomatoes for 5 fresh tomatoes.  Oops, just noticed I forgot to add the cilantro.  I served it over quinoa, but next time I think I would like it better over brown rice.
2019.  Definitely need to reread reviews.  Looked like a lot of good ideas to make this even better.

I dropped all my red lentils on the floor whilst prepring (...) so I had to substitute with a mix of other beans, but it still turned out glorious. I'll certainly make it again, though next time with red lentils.

Turned out well.  I thought it might be more flavorful as leftovers, but found that the taste didn't change much. I was short a tablespoon of curry powder, and used 3 cans of diced tomatoes, which worked well.  I was hesitant to turn the lentils to mush, so I undercooked them a bit; next time I'll cook them a little longer.

I LOVED IT!! I substituted 2 drained cans of tomato for the tomatos. Cooked the quinoa in chicken stock with some salt. Used a bit less curry so about 2 tablespoons 1/4. Instead of corrisnder put a dash of oregano and basil. I used water in the soup. Instead of coconut poweder I used unsweetened coconut flakes.

I have made this recipe many times, but I did adapt a few things.  I had notes posted on here, but now they seem to be gone!  Anyway, from what I recall of my changes, I use two cans of coconut milk, much less black pepper, red curry paste instead of powder and lots of it, I add a small yam diced up.  Also, the lentils take a lot longer to cook than this recipe says and requires more liquid.  There were a few other changes I cannot remember now, but overall, this is a favorite in our house.

Very tasty. I added chicken bouillon to give it more flavor. I bypassed the coconut powder because I didn't have any and used cinnamon powder instead of a cinnamon stick. I also added a bit more water as the beans cooked to keep it from drying out. Will definitely make again.

The lentils took much longer to cook so I had to keep adding more liquid.  I didn't add the salt that the recipe called for and substituted vegetable broth for the water (which took more than the one cup to cook the lentils completely).  I omitted the cinnamon to maintain a more traditional curry flavor and the cilantro, which my husband doesn't like.  Good flavor, just took much longer to cook the lentils.  Next time I will use pre-cooked lentils and just add it to the liquid later in the cooking process to save time.

Made it. Really liked it! I've never made a dish like this before. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was!
I only made half the amount of quinoa that the recipe said and it was plenty.  I did not have coconut powder, as many other reviewers stated, and it was good without it.

This is an amazing 5 star lentil recipe! A couple things I did differently from this recipe though. I didn’t have molasses and coconut powder but it still came out great! I had to slightly adjust water and cooking time to ensure complete cooking of the lentils. I added ¼ cup heavy cream because I prefer that saucy consistency. My local commissary doesn’t carry red lentils but green worked out well. Pour this mix on top of rice or quinoa and you will definitely be satisfied!

This was edible but I think the coriander was just too overpowering.  I made it according to the recipe but only used 1 Tbsp of coriander (I was suspicious going in) and didn't have 5 tomatoes so I used 1 fresh and a 28 oz box of chopped tomatoes.  Hubby and one daughter ate it with me but the other daughter refused, although she has liked other red lentil recipes.  I'll try to finish the leftovers but won't make this again.

This was very good but I did have to add red pepper flakes to give it a bit more zing... Will make again!  I didn't have red lentils so I had to use green which did require a lot more liquid and cooking time.

This was amazingly delicious.  I altered it only slightly.   I didn't have any coconut powder.   Instead of just water I dissolved a chicken boullion cube in it for more flavor.  From reading some of the other reviews I added a small can of tomato paste.  The stew turned out wonderfully delicious and is delicious all on it's own.   The quinoa is very  bland though in comparison.    I might use something completely different next time or figure out what to add to the quinoa to improve it.

This is a great vegetarian dish!  I made only minor changes based on what I had, like using a can of diced tomatoes and omitting the coconut powder.  This made a lot, so I set aside portions (stew only) to freeze, making life easier another night!  Loved it, tons of flavor!

This was pretty tasty.  My only subs were shredded coconut instead of powder (I ground it with a mortar and pestle) and green lentils (the store I went to didn't have red).  I made it in the morning and let the flavors meld all day.  We enjoyed it, but it wasn't until after I served it that I remembered that I had planned to add fresh ginger, pistachios and sriracha.  So I guess I'll try adding those next time--and I think there will be a next time!

This was a really delicious recipe with very accurate directions that resulted in perfectly cooked lentils.  It was very quick and easy.  With tomatoes going out of season, I used a tetrapak of good quality chopped tomatoes, so it was even easier with very little prep work.  The only additions I made were some cayenne pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice on the top.  I accidentally forgot the coconut powder, so I'll look forward to having even more coconut flavor next time. This will be in the regular dinner rotation at our house!

Delicious!  I served this with a whole tandoori roasted cauliflower (recipe here:  http://mynewroots.blogspot.ca/2012/09/whole-roasted-tandoori-cauliflower-with_19.html ), basmati rice and mango chutney.  I did a few small changes:  used a large canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes, added diced carrots, used large brown lentils and increased the cooking time to about 30 minutes.

Used this a basic guideline working with limited ingredients.  Loved it, will be going back to it again!  Spicing was simple but delicious.  Added chili seeds for some spice.

This is a great recipe! We aren't vegetarians but this makes a great winter meal. Even my "meat and potatoes" dad eats it.
