I was a little hesitant to try a recipe with only 1 rating, but since I had all 3 kinds of dried fruit, I decided to try it ... and I'm glad I did! Delicious! And they even look healthy.

These were wonderful!  They were light(batter wise) yet hearty with all the dried fruit.  I happened to have a bag of dried fruit at home with all three of the fruits-so I was thrilled to find this recipe.  They are best the first day I made them, but still good the second day.  I used Spectrum vegetable(with no trans fat)shortening to make these a little more healthier.  Great recipe!
