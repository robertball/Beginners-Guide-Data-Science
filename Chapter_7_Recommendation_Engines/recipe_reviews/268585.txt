This was so easy to get together and we loved the flavor! It tasted very similar to an apple danish.   Although the tart had good flavor, I do think the instructions could be more clear.   I was very confused as the how to assemble the tarts.   I wasn't sure what it meant when it said to pinch the corners of each square together.  A friend from facebook sent me a photo from online of what we thought the author of the recipe meant.  Leave the puff pastry square flat and pinch each of the four corners of the square individually.  The pastries will be flat and topped with the apple filling. They cooked up perfectly.  I do think it would be better to slice the apples thinly and layer them instead of chunking them.   I also thought the apples were a little dry on top after baking.  I left some of the pastries as the recipe stated and drizzled a caramel sauce on the top of part of them.  We preferred the drizzle on top.  I rated a four for flavor.

5 stars for being tasty and easy.  Followed directions except I only sliced my apples rather than diced which resulted in less apples then the recipe.  I pinched the corners of the puff pastry squares and rolled up the edges.  My son really liked them.

Easy to get together but the instructions were very poor.  Spread the cheese to within a quarter of an inch of the edge. I rolled up the edges a bit but not sure if that made a difference. Make sure the apples are diced small, and bake at 400-425.  I baked at 350 for 35 minutes and the pastry was a little underdone.  My oven thermometer is right on.
