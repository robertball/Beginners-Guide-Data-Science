This was a very tasty dish, and very simple to make. I did not marinate it over night I made it around twelve let it marinate until about 5:30 then but the chops on the grill. I was very sceptial with the ingredients list but I have vowed to cook a new dish every week. My family loves this dish.

I thought the recipe was okay. The preparation was kind of lengthy, I think, for the quality of the dish. I mean, don't get me wrong, it definitely tasted good. I may have put less cayenne pepper just because it seemed to overpower the dish.

I loved the recipe.  I did substitute 1 cup applesauce for the apples.  It was easy to make and delicious.  Thanks for posting it.

For me, this recipe used too much time and discarded ingredients to imbue the pork chop with a subtle sweet spicy apple flavor.

This dish was barely edible for me, although my husband described it as "fine."

Okay, but not great.  Probably won't make it again.
