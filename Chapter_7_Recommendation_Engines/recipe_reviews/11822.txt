It was very bland as is, but once I livened it up with oregano and garlic-herb seasoning it was better.

I love this recipe! This reminds me of the "hot dish" my family made growing up. I didn't notice any lack of flavor as previous posters have mentioned... however I am in the habit of always seasoning my ground meat while cooking it. I thought this recipe was comforting and delicious!

This recipie did not go over well with my family.  Seemed to be lacking some type of flavor.

This was just AWESOME. I minced the veggies instead of chopping so DS wouldn't notice them as much :) also left out mushrooms. A keeper for our home.

I give this one an average rating - not bad, not fantastic. It was a good solid dish that lasted me for 4 or 5 meals. It was a good mixture of veggies, beef and noodles, but I agree with a prior reviewer that it could've benefited from the addition of spices of some kind.

Wow! My husband is not a lover of casseroles, but I received a huge compliment on this one!  Because he is a big meat eater, I used 2 pounds of ground beef.  I also substitued the egg noodles for large pasta shell noodles.  Everything else was as is, and he loved it!

I made as directed and found that it needed a lot of seasoning and was too dry for us.   I added in 1 tsp of both salt and pepper and then it wasn't too bad, but that is a lot.   I also think that it should have twice as much tomatoes as directed and cheddar cheese mixed in with the noodle mixture as well as on top.   I also found that the recommended baking dish size was too small.   I love a good hotdish and with a few simple tweaks, this could be it.
