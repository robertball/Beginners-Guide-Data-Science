I couldn't find Dickenson's coconut curd so I used my own home made.  My husband says the pie isn't sweet enough and I agree.  It also took 60 minutes to bake, not 20.

I made my pie crust from scratch (Barefoot Contessa). The pie is super easy and I liked that you don't add any additional sugar- only what's in the Dickinson's coconut curd. I made it as one of the 2 Thanksgiving pies and my family loved it!
