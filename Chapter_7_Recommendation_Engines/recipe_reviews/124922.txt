I have made this several times & it is yummy every single time! The only thing I change is I add in garlic powder & also I made it once with chicken thighs & it turned out greasy. The other times I made it with drumsticks & leg quarters & both times, it turned out soo crunchy & yummy. It was better than going to a KFC or Popeyes chicken place. Extremely happy with this recipe!

This recipe was very good, I used boneless chicken breasts and I crushed up some corn flakes to add an extra crunch to the chicken.  It turned out to be a great choice!  Instead of drizzling butter on top of the chicken I used a low fat butter spray to evenly coat the chicken and to control the amount of butter I used. I then placed wire racks (used for cooling baked cookies)on top of  cookie sheets so the chicken cooked evenly. We were very pleased with the taste.  This dish was a success with the family!

This was an amazing coating, crispy with just enough of a hint of a kick. I didn't change a thing. I also made this with flounder fillets the following week. Works with baked fish too. 10 minutes same oveen temp.

I made this using boneless, skinless breasts cut into strips and cooked at 350 for 35 minutes.  I meant to check them earlier, but forgot and they were still very juicy.  I also forgot to drizzle the butter over and the coating was a little "undone" looking, but still very tasty.  I'm sure the butter would have made it better, but at least it was lower in fat this way.  Great recipe and I can't wait to try it with the butter.

I followed this recipe to the T except for using buttermilk to dip the chicken in, and it turned out just a crispy and flavorful as fried chicken!

This was really good and the chicken came out crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. My family really liked it. I didn't drizzle the butter on top - too much added calories that aren't really needed. Other than that I followed the recipe.

I think that anyone that didn’t get there chicken to turn out crispy did not bake it long enough.  I had to bake ours for 1 hour and turned it on convection for the last 15 minutes.  It was surprisingly crispy.  Great homemade version on shake and bake.  We also added ¼ tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder.  Definitely a keeper.

Great recipe, My husband is a health nut so we always remove the skin. It came out perfect, very juicy and crunchy. For those who wrote in and said theirs did not get crispy, try removing the skin, cuts way down on the fat so less fat- crispier chicken

A very quick and easy recipe. If you are making comfort food and trying to avoid a little of the fat, try this with skinless boneless chicken breasts. Very good.

Could not believe how great this turned out.  I also used boneless chicken breasts, and will never fry chicken again! (and forget about that oven fry stuff).

Delish Chicken! I didn't even miss it NOT being fried! I used 4 huge bone in chicken breast, baked at 400 degrees for 1 hr. 10 min. and they were perfect and crispy! I'd advise lining your baking sheet w/ foil, use a wire rack if you have one, keeps the chicken off the bottom of the pan and allows for bottom crisping. You can use less butter, just make sure to spray the chicken w/ some cooking spray/canola oil before baking. Also, if you dust a little cornstarch onto the raw chicken first, before dredging into your wet, then then the coating mixture, it will STICK much better for you overall. This would also be great to make a spicy version~ I can't wait to try it spicy!

Used crushed cornflakes instead of cornmeal and didn't drizzle the butter as I wanted to cut down on the fat -it was still good. This is an excellent alternative to fried chicken - the whole family loved it!

Delicious! Followed ingredients exactly, but also added a little bit of shredded parmesean. I also baked on a cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet. This helped from the juices making the chicken soggy. But be sure to spray your cooling rack so the chicken doesn't stick. Very crispy and golden brown!

Fantastic!!  Best baked chicken we've had!  I used evaporated milk in place of regular milk and I spiced up the cornmeal a bit - added more salt, garlic salt, and cajun seasoning.  I also sprinkled a tiny bit of salt and pepper on the raw chicken before putting it in the milk and coating.   I didn't drizzle butter on top before cooking - I just put little cold butter dots on top before cooking.  Will use again!!!

Really delicious crispy moist chicken. I used chicken thighs because it's what I had on hand. I added garlic powder to the mix for a little extra flavor and turned up the heat to 400 for the last 10 minutes of cooking to really crisp the skin.

This recipe was very easy and good for you. I opted not to use the butter on top...instead sprayed with a nonstick cooking spray. I didn't spray enough so it was a little floury tasting.

Very good! I was surprised how crispy the chicken turned out. The cornmeal was the trick. I did add additional seasonings..garlic powder, onion powder, and alittle more salt. This is much better than the Shake N' Bake stuff and you can make this for pennies compared to the store bought coating that you never have enough coating to do the whole chicken. My family really enjoyed this and will add this to my dinner rotations.

Made this tonight.  Used completely different seasonings, but followed the 1:1 ratio of cornmeal to flour and all other directions.  This was great!!  Nice and crisp on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside.  Definitely a keeper.

Wonderful coating! We had a chicken malfunction one night and used it with pork chops the next night instead. Yum! Also, the mix can be made ahead of time and stored for future use - time savings! I forgot to drizzle the butter on top, but it turned out just fine. I also used it on a boneless, skinless chicken breast, which turned out wonderful, too.

There was NO flavor to this dish!!  I would definitely recommend removing the cornmeal all together.  I will definitely rub all the dry ingredient together before coating it in flour.  The milk does nothing, dont even bother with it.  The only reason why I'm giving it a 2 stars is because its baked...lol.

The reason I gave it 4 stars was because it needed a little seasoning of the chicken before hand. Also I think you need to put the chicken on a metal cooling rack so that the side resting on the bottom of the baking dish doesn't get soft or soggy. Otherwise it was a good recipe - and very simple. I'll make it again.

This is a great way to make crispy baked chicken! If using a pan, it would be a good idea to turn the chicken halfway through baking, so that the chicken does not get soggy on one side. Make sure to oil the pan well, or else the chicken will stick.

I made this last night and my family absolutely loved it. My husband is still talking about it today and that never happens. I made it gluten free by using half cup Pamela's baking mix with the cornmeal. I also added a 1/2 tsp more of chili powder. Very moist and crispy! I served it with sweet potato cornbread - yum!

I used this with Chicken strips & thought it was rather bland. Maybe I didn't measure the spices correctly. I did substitute garlic powder for the oregano. It was only slightly crispy.

My wife and I enjoyed eating this baked chicken. It was great and we had easy side dishes to go with it. It's an economical meal and does not require a lot of gadgetry or ingredients. It's a winner!

I followed recipe exactly.  It was good but not great.  The great thing is most ingredients are always on hand!  I will keep it for days when grilling just isn't an option.

I had a cut up fryer in the frig that I needed to use up, so I baked this for lunch.  Went by the recipe except for the addition of 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.  I didn't drizzle butter on the chicken and it did look powdery as some have reviewed, so I took butter flavored cooking spray and lightly sprayed it on the chicken.  This turned out delicious, tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Will definitely do this again as it was an easy way to make chicken that was crispy like fried chicken.

Reminds me a lot of "Shake 'N Bake" ... we also added garlic powder, and it was a hit!  ALSO ... I experimented with the leftover milk and coating and came up with a wonderful treat for the dogs!  I added one small egg, mixed everything together, dropped spoonfuls on a baking sheet and popped it in the oven along with the chicken. Presto! Homemade "biscuits" for the pups. :-)

This is so fast and easy.  It turned out delicious on boneless skinless breasts and the only change I made was using not using milk, but just running the chicken under water.  Fave reviews from my family.  Will try it on fish fillets next time.

I used b/s thighs because that's what I had and made it into nuggets.  This was awesome.  I had intended to spray with cooking spray before cooking and not drizzle with butter because of diet constrictions, but even forgot to spray and it was still great.  Wonderful flavor...grandsons from young to old loved it.  I used another suggestion to cook on racks and glad I did.  Really tender and crispy.  Thanks so much for the recipe and it's a keeper in this house.

To make the breading thicker, I mixed an egg into the milk, lightly floured the chicken, then dipped in egg/milk mixture then the cornmeal mix. Don't drizzle too much butter on top, as the juices collect under the chicken and make it soggy. I might skip the butter altogether next time. Used drumsticks, cooked for 1 hour, turned out very juicy and tastey

This was a delicious surprise! I marinated the chicken pieces in buttermilk overnight, without skins. For the crust, I substituted 1/4 cup cornmeal with 1/4 cup panko (japanese bread crumbs). This was very crispy and tasty. My husband loved the thighs especially! And we love that it's baked.

I finally found a recipe that's crispy enough for me. I followed the recipe exactly plus onion powder to taste. I always spray a cooling rack and bake meat,chicken or fish on it(NOT SOGGY ON BOTTOM-DOESN'T STICK).PERFECT! On to the fish next.  Thanks for the keeper.

It was very good, I used bone in chicken breasts and the chicken came out juicy.  Instead of chili powder, I used garlic powder. I can't have fried food so this was a treat for me.

Chicken was moist, breading was crisp, but bland. I think next time I will replace the chili powder with other spices( Paprika, more garlic powder, etc.)Easy but dissapointing taste wise.

This recipe was really easy. Be sure to cover chicken completely with butter.  After 50 minutes I opened the oven and noticed there were a few splotches of batter   that had not been drizzled with butter.  However it was an easy fix, just add more butter and bake a little longer.  The chicken came out crispy and delicious.  Plus the leftovers were good too.

Great recipe! I used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken, and I baked it at 350 for an hour, so that I could accomodate other items in the oven, and it turned out wonderfully! Thank you!

I was in shock when I tasted this chicken and it tasted just like fried chicken.  The best part was that it was not oil at all.  Very tasty.  The only thing I would recommend is cooking it a little bit longer.  I cooked it for the 50 minutes the recipe says and I found that I should have probably left it in the oven for a full hour.  Other then that it was great.

I liked this recipe it definately needs more seasoning though. I also think the drizzle of butter takes away the crispyness. I sprayed it with cooking oil and it was crispy that way at least the top was. Thanks for sharing.

I made this with chicken legs.  It was pretty good but I think it would have been better with boneless, skinless breasts.  I'll try that next time.

I love chicken with a crispy skin, and this recipe offered that with a nice moisty inside. The smell was delicious, and the taste was quite nice. I used large chicken legs so the rolling was tricky but sprinkling worked perfectly.

This was so good!  My boyfriend raved over it.  He said it was a cross between fried chicken but has the health factor of baked. The only thing I changed was I drizzled olive oil instead of butter on top before & again during baking, and I used Italian Seasoning instead of Oregano.

I made this w/ chic.leg. (hsbd likes only) I changed amounts and added Panko for added crunch. It was so good.  I added 30 additional mins. (partially frozen legs)  will use it again.

I don't usually rate recipes, but this recipe was excellent.  The coating stayed on the chicken and it was crunchy just like fried chicken.  The only thing I might do different next time is try a few spices that are bolder to give it a little more zip! I did use boneless, skinless chicken breasts.

This chicken was just alright. It's good in a pinch if you want breaded chicken but don't have breadcrumbs. However the pieces were powdery even after being cooked. I sprayed them with some cooking spray and cooked them a little longer trying to get them to crisp up, but they were still all powdery.

So crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  YUMMY!!!  This is better than pan fried and without the grease.  This is going to be a new family favorite.  PS I added a dash of garlic.

Very crispy when using less butter! Also used drummettes/wings. For the taste, I felt it was a bit bland so maybe adding more seasonings would work. We'll see next time. I'd probably use a wired rack as well.

I have used this recipe for years and incorporated it into my lineup of food offerings when I was a chef.  People loved that it was baked instead of fried and a healthier option on the menu.  Many never knew it wasn't real fried chicken! I have now opened my own restaurant and this simple homestyle recipe made it on to the menu. Even in mass quantities I don't change a thing as it appeals to the masses with its flavor, texture, and right amount of spice.

I just made this recipe for dinner tonight. And while it was tasty (I added tons more of spices) it was not anything different. I added Spanish seasonings both on the chicken directly and some in the mix with the cornmeal such as garlic& Parsley salt, sazon, and adobo. While baking the breading was just crumbling off so I ended up with chicken drums that were partially breaded. Taste was good, but nothing to spectaculiar. Prob wont try again anytime soon.

The first time I made this I was impressed. The second time I altered the recipe a little. I like a lot of flavor so I doubled the seasoning and subsituted garlic powder for the oregano. I used boneless skinless chicken pieces for chicken nuggets. very tasty and the kids LOVE them!

This chicken is amazing!!! Almost fooled my boyfriend when i told him I made him fried chicken. Like some of the other people I used only boneless skinless chicken, the only thing I found is that it would be even better with some kind of sauce to dip it in. And it is what we did thee next time we made it was cut the chicken into strips and made homemade chicken fingers using this recipe and served it with honey dill...EXCELLENT!

I liked the texture. It was very crispy, with the additon to cornflakes. But I didn't like the flavor. I think the chili didn't go well.

Delicious! My dad loves baked chicken but my mom's recipe leaves the chicken soggy and greasy. I followed this recipe exactly except I didn't have plain cornmeal so I used a seasoned cornmeal and left out the salt. I also dredged the chicken in the cornmeal mix before dipping in the milk and then back into the flour. It helps the breading stay on. This recipe was wonderful and I will definitely use it again. This time for company and not just my family.

5 star for flavor...but,,,chicken and real butter can't be beat, IMO.  Mine didn't crisp up very much, so I broiled for a few minutes at the end (and i always use a cooking rack over a sheet pan). Tasted great but, I am still looking for a baked chicken that is a little more heart-healthy and that doesn't need real butter to be delicious and crispy. I will try with a butter- substitute, next time. However, this is a delicious homestyle recipe, as is, and we loved the little grit/crunch that the cornmeal gave it.

It was good and crispy and a lot less calories than KFC.  Just a few things, I didn't care for the oregano and will try dried parsley.  I also added garlic powder and a little more chili powder than called for.  I substituted butter milk for regular and it gave it a nice flavor.  Thanks for sharing it was great..

This turned out great! I subbed half of the cornmeal with fine bread crumbs, and as I didn't have any chili powder, I just used a pinch of cayenne. I also added some garlic powder. The chicken was cooked perfectly and wonderfully crispy. Thanks so much!

This dish was wonderful. My children loved it, and a few even want if for their "birthday dinner" which I always prepare for them. I would give this more than 5 stars if I could. Very tender, flavorful, juicy, with crisp skin. Definitely a keeper that I will make a lot.

What an excellent and easy recipe. My husband (and kids) wouldn't stop ranting and raving about. This is definately a keeper. Thanks!

This was excellent!  The only change I made was to add crushed corn flakes to the coating.  The chicken was moist with a wonderful flavor.

I made this recipe for a family indoor picnic on Labor Day weekend.  My husband, stepson, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter all loved it especially my stepson who said it was way better than Shake and Bake.  I had been searching for a homemade substitute for Shake and Bake because I was tired of paying for the package which costs as much as a whole chicken unless on sale. If you follow the recipe to the letter the kids will love it.  Forget about the grownups because some of them no longer have taste buds.

I used boneless skinless chicken tenders for this recipe and they turned out great!  I did add a little bit of grill seasoning to the breading mixture to give it a little bit of kick.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a nice recipe.  I used it to make chicken nuggets.  They came out nice a crispy with a nice flavor.  I cooked them the whole 50 minutes and they are nice and juicy.  The flavor is nice also.  It is missing something for my taste, but I can't put my finger on it.  Thanks for sharing this.

This was a good recipe, however it was a tad balnd.  I added some parmesam cheese on top of the chicken after it was done.  It did help give a little more flavor.  My wife gave it four stars and I agree.

This was excellent--I'll use this recipe from now on!! The cornmeal gave it a great crunch and flavor--this would be great for a big batch of oven baked wings, because the smaller pieces are the best---Thanks!!

I thought the flavor of the coating was absolutely delicious! But for some reason mine didn't 'crunch up' very much. It wasn't soggy...just not as crispy as I was expecting. Followed the recipe exactly..and will most likely make again. Thanks!

I was not wowed by this recipe but it was a good way to get crispy chicken without frying. I also chose to use chicken breasts cut into strips instead of the whole fryer which may have been part of the problem. I did not think there was a whole lot of flavor to the coating but the chicken did turn out moist on the inside and crisp on the outside and went well with the roasted cajun potatoes I also made from this site.

This recipe is good. I baked my chicken for 2 and 1/2 hours, making sure I baked it on both sides. Next time I make this I will season the drumsticks with seasoning salt after I dip them in the milk and then roll it in the cornmeal mixture. I will also use more seasonings to my tastebuds in the cormeal mixture. The drumsticks were not greasy or dry. I loved that this recipe was easy. Who would have thought cornmeal?? for baked (fried) chicken.

There's always room in my recipe collection for another chicken dish.  This one is delicious!  You're family will love it, and company will be impressed by it!  I used fresh ground cornmeal bought at a local festival.  Sure beats the over processed corn meal found at the grocery store.

Good recipe. Instead of cornmeal and flour for the coating I used breadcrumbs and crushed honeynut cheerios and cornflakes. My boys loved their crispy baked drumsticks!

I made this for a large group without even tring it first but I was not disappointed. All the kids ate it and it was easy. I think I would add season salt instead of straight salt next time. It is so helpful when the reviews are true. THANKS TO ALL !

I only used breasts and instead of oregano, I used parm. cheese.  It was very good and will be using again.  Going to try it using boneless, skinless,too.

when i was little my mom used to roll chicken in melted butter then in crushed cornflakes and baked it. she called it oven fried chicken. delicious. 

this is very similar and very good. i've never been a shake and bake kind of girl!

personally i like the skin on the chicken as it adds more self-basting, but it is equally good without it.

For a basic recipe, I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  It was probably the moistest chicken breast I have ever eaten. Thank you for providing something that most all of us have ingredients for.

I have made this at least 4 times and everytime my family loves it. So do I! I use chicken thighs with the skin pulled off and bake for 1 1/2 hours. Always crispy always perfectly cooked. Thanks for an excellent, easy recipe!

Super tasty dish! I used boneless, skinless breasts, as I didn't have a whole chicken on hand, but luckily I had all the other ingredients. I used a fraction of the butter, but mine still crisped up nicely. It was moist inside as well. The next time I make it, I think I'll experiment with the spices - but it's excellent as is!

EXCELLENT!!!!  My husband is from the South and he knows his fried chicken...he loves this recipe because it's a healthier version that doesn't lack any of the traditional flavor or crispness.  I usually remove the skin and it still remains juicy and flavorful.  I've made this several times and it will remain one of our favorites!  Thanks for posting!!

This was really good!  I used boneless, skinless breasts and thighs.  I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe was great. I had to cook dinner for my boyfriends parents while they were out and this was a perfect choice i made. I added corn flakes to this recipe to make the chicken extra crunchy...Also i added a little bit more of chili powder, i dont like spicy food but it wasnt at all so i loved it!

This was tasty. I used boneless chicken tenders and added some garlic powder to the coating. Not as crispy as I thought it would be, but enjoyable.

Followed the recipe as written.  This was pretty good.  The chicken stayed nice and moist and the skin was crispy, but I thought it was a little bland.

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, other than that I kept the recipe as is.  The flavor was fine, nothing to die for, but we enjoyed dinner.  However, the breading was soggy.  I can't come up with an explanation for it, but it just would not crisp.  Otherwise I would have given the recipe four stars.

Made this tonight because I wanted something different.  It turned out pretty well.  I used chicken tenderloins instead of the fryer.  They turned out just fine!  They reminded me of eating chicken strips without all of the grease!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  The only thing I didn't care for was I tasted a little too much salt, but that could be because I used smaller chicken portions.

This was a great coating for baked chicken.  It turned out crispy and flavorful.  My only addition was a little garlic powder to the coating mix.  Will definitely make again.

This was okay... good flavor, although I did add a bit to it. More pepper, some garlic salt and some red pepper flakes. And i STILL thought it was a bit bland...I will continue tweaking it, but it was pretty good! My hubby liked it. I also added cornflake crumbs for added cruch like others suggested.

This recipe really didn't do it for us.  I used chicken tenders instead of a fryer chicken, but I don't think that should have made a difference.  The coating was very bland and powdery tasting.  It also didn't get very crispy.  I think I'll stick with marinating in Italian dressing and coating with Italian breadcrumbs instead.

I was looking for crispy chicken and this was totally crispy. Here's how:removed the skin, used 1/2 cornmeal 1/2 cornflake crumbs, and sprayed with PAM instead of using butter. The only issue I had with this was the spices. Too much chili powder for me, maybe I should have changed up the spices. But this was definately crispy!

This was pretty good.  I also added some crushed corn flakes which made a crunchier skin.  I was out of chili powder, so I used some cajun seasoning which was great. The smell as it's baking makes your mouth water in anticipation!

I was not thrilled with the results of this recipe.  The chicken did not have a lot of flavor, and I did not like the texture of the breading.  I thought this could be because I'm not a big fan of cornbread, but my husband is and he didn't really like the chicken either.  I won't be making this recipe again.  Sorry!

My friend invited me over for her Crispy Baked Chicken and I loved it!  Juicy and delicious.
