Outstanding, I will never make beef chili again.  I made two small changes.  One was substituting a 4oz. can of mild green chilies for the bell pepper since my husband and I are not bell pepper fans and I add one 15oz. can of drained and rinsed black beans.  Delicious!!

Made this for an office function; everyone loved it; the only change I made was adding corn.  Delicious & healthy!

Very tasty.  I added a package of Trader Joe's succotash to add some additional vegetables.
