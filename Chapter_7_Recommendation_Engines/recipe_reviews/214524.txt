Delicious. However, to give it more of an authentic Mexican flavor, I added 1/2 tsp cumin, 1 1/2 tsp chili powder, and a can of drained black olives. Great recipe; my family loved it. Thanks!

I made this in my cast iron skillet and popped it in the oven. I followed the recipe exactly except I left off the green onion. It was very hearty & filling. Would be great for a larger family.

Very good and hubby loved it. I added some cumin and sliced black olives to enhance the flavor. Also started with a chilpote polenta base as I can't get any mixes. Thanks for the good starting base recipe.

YUM! I loved this recipe - easy ingredients and it came out so delicious. The only change I made was I used diced green chiles in place of the green onions. I mixed half the can into the beef and half into the cornbread. Also, since this recipe calls for only a 1/2 can of corn, I also just dumped the extra into the beef. Will be going into the monthly rotation!

I love this!!  It was so easy and the flavor actually resembles tamales!  I threw it together in minutes, topped it with cheese (left out the onions) and it was great!!  Oh, I had to substitute kidney beans for black beans because there weren't any available and I made the corn bread mix from scratch (it's much better than the boxed cornbread and only takes ~3 minutes to prepare.)  I will make this again for sure, thanks!  This was my first new recipe for 2011 and it's a keeper!

Good dish. The crust was unimpressive to me and was a little dry.  Would have prefered tortilla chips. Hubby really liked as did my 15 month old. I added some onion and garlic for some more flavor. Needs to be more saucey.

This was delicious!  I added a small, drained can of sliced black olives to the meat mixture.  My picky husband was pleased and asked me to make it a regular family meal.

So so sorry - Great ingredients - I love them all and am a huge fan of tamale pie, but I just did not care for the crust - it ruined the entire meal.  All those wonderful food items (and ye gods - I just saw the calorie and fat content) and a big pie pan full of glop.

This seemed a lot like Mexican Shepherd's Pie (from this website), although not quite as good.  I left out the green onions and used a large can of corn (which I partially mixed in with the meat mixture).

I make this all the time when I have to make food for a small group of friends.  It's filling enough that it'll usually feed 6-8 of us. When I make it, I tend to make more like 12 oz of cornbread for the crust.  I use Green Giant Mexicorn with green and red peppers as the bottom layer.  I mix some of the green onions in with the beef while it's simmering, as well as some finely chopped jalapeno and black olives.  It's delicious and I get requests to make it all the time now.  Next time I'm going to mix some fresh salsa into the filling.

Other than adding chipotle paste to beef mixture, I followed the recipe as is.  This was a huge success with the entire family.  I will definitely be making this again.

Pretty good... there was hardly enough cornbread mix to go around the outside of the dish though.  It was wonderful warm, but not so good as leftovers.

Tasty!  Instead of using taco seasoning and water I cooked the ground beef in salsa and added olives to the mixture.  It was a big hit!  While it was cooking it bubbled over the pie pan so I would recommend putting a cookie sheet or foil underneath.

Wish I would have read a few of the reviews before making this - I did not care for the sweetness of the corn muffin mix - the ingredients sounded good, but it just didn't make the grade !
I used Salsa as a side for it as it seemed dry and not very Mexican-like.  My husband did like it, but I think there are better tamale recipes ! Sorry.

We all liked this. However, I found the crust hard to spread, especially the top. When I cut it, it fell apart. The taste was good and it was easy, but I'm not sure I will make again.

Great recipe! I don't care for green onions but I did chop up about 1/2 cup of white onion and 1 clove of garlic and cooked it with the meat while browning. I also used 1 can of diced tomatoes, drained but saved 3/4 cup of the liquid. I used the tomato liquid instead of water.  I didn't have any canned corn so I used 3/4 - 1 cup frozen corn. I didn't thaw it just tossed it in.   Otherwise with my little corrections for personal taste....This was a fabulous dish. Thanks for sharing!!

I added regular onion and 1 minced jalapeno to the meat mixture.  To the crust, to avoid the bland flavor so many mentioned, I added about 1/2 a teaspoon chipotle chile powder, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder & 1/4 teaspoon salt.
The family enjoyed it! Ole! :D

We really enjoy having this recipe in our list for something different to make. 

We use "Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread" from this site for the topping and the taco spice we use is also from Allrecipes.
