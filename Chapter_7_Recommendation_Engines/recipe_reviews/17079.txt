My family could eat fresh spinach with olive oil and garlic every night, but it's nice to switch it up once in awhile. Thanks for the recipe:)

This is a great summer recipe. I made this several times while the dill in my yard was running rampant (hardly put a dent in the dill though). I plan to serve it during Passover this year (the recipe does comply with Sephardic dietary restrictions).

This is one of my most favorite dishes... I do change it up a bit and add minced garlic, feta crumbles and a top of plain lowfat yogurt. LOVE IT!

An easy, elegant dish for any occasion. Although, the garbanzo beans should be omitted for the Passover seder meal due to dietary law. (At least that is what my Jewish in-laws told me.) Could also substitute kale in this recipe. It was a big hit at Passover. Thanks!

Clever way to mix up the usual saut√©ed spinach.  I had everything except the dill on hand so I went without it and added a pinch of cumin.  Fast and easy to make.  Thanks Sara, I will make this again.

This was excellent!  Nice tart lemon flavor.  I looooved the dill - I never would have thought to use fresh dill that way.  I used half collard greens, steamed, and half spinach to give it a bit of variety in flavor.

I thought this was very good although just a tad bit much lemon juice. I did not have chickpeas so I substituted with some cannellini beans. Not the same texture(I know) but still very good. I also added just a sprinkle of cumin.
This was something that I should definately classify as a "keeper"
Love the combination of mostly fresh ingrediants.

I liked this but it wasn't perfect.  It is a good and different way to enjoy chick peas so I'll probably make it again but with less dill and lemon juice.  I don't know if that will make it perfect but it may help.

I love spinach so I added more then the recipe called for. I didn't use all the dill called for either, it was a little overpowering in taste.  Warm chickpeas was new for me, but a tasty dish. I will try this recipe again!

Sorry but this just didn't do it for me or my family. The dill and lemon flavors were way too overpowering and I'd didn't even use 1/4 c let alone a 1/2c of dill that it calls for. I only used one lemon as well. I really wanted to like this one but unfortunately I had to throw it out.

Very good recipe. It is different and healthy and EASY. The tang of the dill and lemon are just right. The only reason I gave it four stars is because there are some tastebuds that won't appreciate the complex flavors.

This recipe is indeed kosher for Passover according to Sephardic traditions, which allows beans and legumes to be eaten.

Not to mention it is delicious!

This was so delicious, we really loved it. It is a lovely and healthy side dish, just as it is. I wondered what it would be like if the garbanzo beans were crunchy so might try that next time. But definitely a keeper.

Didn't care for combination of flavours.  Found it a little on the bitter side.

I really liked this recipe, but made slight modifications. I used red onion as it is milder and used dried dill since I didn't have fresh dill. I'd like to try it with fresh dill. I shared it with a friend. Waiting for her opinion.on it.

Way too much lemon juice! Of course, this might have turned out better if our 90-something aunt & uncle had gotten up from their naps on time so the spinach didn't end up simmering for an extra HOUR.

It tasted Ok for the first couple of bites but then I couldn't stand the taste or the smell of it.  Threw out the rest.

I never had chickpeas before and this was really tasty and the texture of chickpeas amongst the spinach was pleasing. My husband and I liked it a lot and it used up the rest of the dill before it went bad.
