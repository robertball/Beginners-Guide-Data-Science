I love the idea of vegan condensed milk; can't believe I hadn't thought of it sooner. It took me 1.5 hours or so to get it to one cup though, so expect to spend some time on it. I used an induction stove on setting 3, whisking about every 5 minutes. I used it to make vegan coffee whitener and loved the flavor. Oddly, the coconut taste subsides when cooking even though still fragrant. I made up another can, using coconut sugar (and forgot the vanilla). Itwas delicious. I used that to make vegan salted caramels. Awesome recipe. Thank you for sharing it with us!

I made it with  milk since I don't like coconut.  Fingers crossed it works perfectly in my recipe tomorrow!
