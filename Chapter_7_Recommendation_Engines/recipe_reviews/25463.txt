This is an excellent recipe, though I made a few adjustments.  First, I marinated the fish (salmon and mahi mahi) overnight instead of for just one hour.  Second I added a tablespoon of ginger and chili paste for a touch more complexity.  Both fish were wonderful, I will be sure to use this again and again.

Yummy. I cubed mine and made it into kabobs with Japanese eggplant and zucchini. I also tried the marinade on beef and it is equally delicious.

DELICIOUS! I used 1/2" thick "spot" fillets for this recipe. (spot is what they are called locally here in southeastern North Carolina, silver with a black spot and yellow markings; I don't know if they have other names elsewhere). I was afraid the difference in thickness would make the marinade too strong, but since I had about a pound of fillets, I decided to chance it. They were perfect, grilled in about 3 minutes on my indoor grill. YUMMY! Will be using this recipe again and again. My picky children wouldn't touch it though.

I thought that this recipe was very nice but after the first time using it (I grilled mahi mahi)I thought the soy was a little overwhelming so I cut it back to 1/4 cup.  I also made the mistake one time of using real sherry instead of cooking sherry and it definitely wasn't as tasty.  Very good otherwise, a departure from sweeter marinades-

I tried this once on salmon & once on beef.  The taste was fine, although rather subtle on the fish.  There are other marinades on this site that I like better though.  Just FYI, information on various web sites usually says to marinate fish no longer than an hour (& often even less).

We liked this recipe.  When I make this again I am going to add more garlic and a little molasses, and just put it all in a Ziploc to marinade.

It was good, but I prefer blackened tuna steaks with cajun seasoning.

My son detests fish and requested I make this again using fillets instead of steaks. My husband loved it so much he gave his mom the recipe! I added a tablesppon of chili powder and a tablespoon of ground ginger. I did not have sherry so I used Italian White Wine Vinegar instead. We used Redfish both times because that is what was caught. Steaks or fillets this recipe is a great change of pace.

Everyone raved about the fish so I am giving it 5 stars. Their compliments took me by surprise. I let it marinade overnight and added some fresh cilantro and other spices.

We didn't like this at all. Way too salty and the fish got mushy. Maybe because we had whitefish rather than tuna but I saw another review that says she uses it on all her fish.

I may have overcooked mine a tad..anytime I cook tuna it turns out dry but I think that is partly due to how dense the meat is...still very tasty...

I thought these were pretty good but it seemed like the soy sauce overpowered everything.  Couldn't really taste the lime.

Great base recipe. I will use low sodium and cut the amount of soy sauce next time. Perhap equal parts sherry, soy, and oil. I will also add about a teaspoon of chili powder and dry ginger next time as the flavoring needed a little extra something. I ate with a little Sriracha, which may make it into the marinade next time too. Overall, though a great take for tuna steaks, just a little salty.

Everyone I make this for is amazed. This has the power to convert "I don't eat fish" to "Wow! This is amazing!"

Find a place that will give you never-frozen tuna.
