Good frosting, totally different from the basic confectioners' sugar buttercream, smooth, almost mousse-like.  But I don't know what I was thinking when I mixed a hot egg yolk/sugar mixture in with, of all things, a shortening/butter mixture.  It did exactly what I expected it to - it melted and looked much like cake batter. (Kind of tasted like it too)  I can only think my lapse in judgment was because I blindly trusted the recipe.  I put the frosting in the fridge and checked it periodically until it was firm enough to work with and it ultimately turned out fine.  But if you do make this, by all means, let your yolks and sugar mixture cool down to room temperature before mixing it into the butter and shortening!  After all the monkeying around with this, and the fact that it's a little too chocolatey for me, I'm not sure I'll bother with this one again.  My three star rating is basically for the instructions which essentially make this fail until you "fix" it.

I made this with my Kitchen Aid mixer and it was very easy.  The texture is soft and fluffy, like mousse.  It is not too sweet.  I LOVE it.  My go to recipe from now on.  Will experiment with some other flavorings soon, peppermint, cinnamon, lemon, etc.

I used this frosting on the chocolate cherry cake from Ginger and it was the most incredible frosting I have ever tasted.  I didnt have rum so I used 1 teaspoon of brandy.  My husband continues to rave about this.  Thank you for such a great recipe!!!!

I thought this was pretty good. The only thing I left out was the rum because it isn't something that I have on hand. Delicious!  :)

One word: Greasy. I was disappointed with this recipe. I liked that it didn't use a lot of sugar, but it did seem like a lot of butter and shortening. The frosting seemed soupy when it was done. I put it in the freezer, thinking the heat of the warm syrup had perhaps melted the shortening, and the texture did improve as it chilled. However, it was just too greasy tasting. I ended up adding in two cups of confectioner's sugar to try to balance out the greasiness. It still was just too greasy for me.

I used this on top of strawberry cupcakes and this recipe got rave reviews at school.  I took the advice of other reviewers and let the sugar/water mixture cool a bit before adding it. I didn't have any rum, so I just doubled the vanilla.  The texture is very light, so it would be difficult to do decorating with beyond a cupcake swirl.  Also I liked the that this recipe is not supersweet.

The taste of this "buttercream" was A+, but everything else gets an F. It was wayyy too soupy to even think about using as a frosting. I ended up having to add almost half a bag of confectioner's sugar to it just to be able to frost my cupcakes with it.

Best tasting buttercream I've ever made! Thank you very much for the recipe. As I used it in a strawberry cake, I put some lemon juice instead of rum and white chocolate instead of the unsweetened and the result was yummy! I'll definitely make it again!

Fantastic!  Honestly, you could add a little more chocolate to it to make it a little richer, but really light and delicious!

Too much trouble for mediocre results.  The frosting does taste better after a day or two, but I don't think I will make it again because of the time and dirty dishes involved.  Also, there are raw egg yolks in this recipe.
