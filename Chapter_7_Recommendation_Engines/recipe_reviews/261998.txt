This was really good. We served coleslaw on the bun and also pickled ginger. This is a keeper.

Love this. Made  as tacos with all the fixings. I make a mayo, lime, and avacado drizzle for the top. Freezers well for a quick snack or meal on the run.

This was enthusiastically received from a big group dinner we had recently.  It's a great and exotic change for pulled pork.  Changes:  Sadly,  I could not get to the store and had to use Sriracha and a shake of red pepper flakes instead of the gochujang paste.  I also used dried thyme.  The big change, however, was serving these as tacos with small flour tortillas, sriracha mayo, thinly sliced radish, chopped green onion, chopped purple cabbage, chopped cilantro and fresh squeezed lime juice.  It was very colorful and easy to make.  Will definitely make again!
