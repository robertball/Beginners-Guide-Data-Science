I adore biscuits and have been trying to find the perfect recipe.  This one comes very close.  In the name of science I made three versions of this recipe one evening; one with all shortening, one with half shortening and half butter, and one with all butter.  The recipe with all shortening was very bland.  The half butter recipe was very good and the texture was incredible.  They were almost melt in your mouth tender.  The all butter taste was slightly better, but the texture wasn't as nice.   I also use my food processor to mix the dry ingredients and to cut in the butter, but you have to be careful not to process it too much.  (Leaving large chunks of butter makes them flakier.) I transfer the flour mixture to a bowl and stir in the milk.     I also took a batch of dough and kneaded half of it 20 times and didn't knead the other half (my mom always taught me that kneading biscuits made them tougher).  Surprise! The kneaded dough rose almost twice as tall when the biscuits were baked.   Also, rolling them out so they are an 1 inch thick makes them even taller too.

This is the recipe we always use for biscuits now!  I do a couple of things differently after a LOT of trial and error.  I use COLD butter in place of the shortening and cut back just a little on the salt.  Then, instead of rolling and cutting the dough, I use my ice cream scoop, which makes perfectly  even biscuits, each and every time.  I place them on a greased cookie sheet and lightly press the tops down to flatten a little.  I've brushed the tops with butter, cream, egg wash, milk...you name it.  Anyway you want to top them, these are AWESOME biscuits!...and they have ALWAYS turned out!

Fantastic. I think using ALL shortening is the quintessential factor in true, southern biscuits. Shortening creates an extremely flaky, tender crumb.  But I agree it lacks flavor without butter.  I always use 1 full teaspoon of salt when using all shortening and Butter flavored shortening is preferable over plain.  I do NOT knead this 20 times as stated.  I knead this about 3-4 times just enough to bring the dough together before gently patting it out for cutting.  This light handling keeps the biscuits light, with fluffy layers.  Overworking the dough will create a tough, dense biscuit.  Roll it out thick, about 2 inches, for a nice thick biscuit.  I brush the tops with cream, milk or eggs before baking for nice color and shine. (Cream & Milk will give the best shine) This recipe makes just 5 biscuits, so doubling it for company is a good idea.  Easy recipe for even you beginner bakers! This is my master biscuit recipe. (12 min. bake time for 5 biscuits, 2 in. thick)

WOW!  Yummy, fluffy, easy, tender.  I was looking for a buttermilk biscuit recipe and couldn't find what I wanted, so I used this and used buttermilk instead of milk.  Used stick butter for shortening.  Used a tsp. instead of 1/2 tsp of salt.  These were very easy, rolled out beautifully, and were the best biscuits I've ever made.

Great biscuits.  From other's suggestions we changed the shortening to real butter (keep it cold), and used a food processor to blend dry with butter, put in bowl to stir in milk. Kneaded about 5 times and LIGHTLY patted out flat and folded over 4 times to make layers. Brushed warm melted butter on tops before we baked, seems to help them start raising. Best biscuits we've ever made.

These are the best biscuits I have ever made.  I used butter instead of shortening and wiped the tops with half and half before I put them in the oven.  They rise perfectly!

Awesome recipe!!! I've been trying for a while to make homemade biscuits and these reminded me of the kind I had growing up. I sneaked in a little bit more baking powder and shortening even though it wasn't really needed ( just toyed with it after making them A MILLION TIMES NOW because they are so good).

this ones a keeper!

Very good but missing something, maybe a little more salt, will try that next time. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening, also increased sugar to 1 T. I only had to bake for 7 minutes, may have made them smaller, I used the top of a glass drinking glass to cut. Topped with melted butter. Also used buttermilk

This are the best homemade biscuits I've come across. My kids LOVE these and so did my husband. These weren't not heavy and with a great taste that left you wanting more. Keep in mind though that the temp outside can play a roll in how high your biscuits rise. Thank you so mucg for sharing. I have made these everyday.

I'm a really good cook - but biscuits... Not so much, I've never had a batch turn out right until tonight!  Figured I'd give this recipe a go and these are the most tender, flaky, yummy biscuits!  Thank you for sharing!!!

This was a very simple yummy recipe.  I had never baked anything from scratch before these and my family loved them!  I did add a tad more salt and used butter rather than shortening.

Wonderful recipe for "Fluffy Biscuits"! I think you can use butter-flavored shortening or real butter and you'll have great results.  I used real butter and then wrapped the dough in plastic wrap and let it "rise" for 20 minutes or so before rolling out and cutting.  I basted them with a little melted butter while baking and these turned out tall, light and fluffy - what more could you ask for from a biscuit?

just a tip, 
use cold butter and grate it with a cheese grater into the flour.  Much easier to cut into the flour.

I loved this recipe! This is the only biscuit recipe I will use, much to my grandmother's dismay who wishes I'd like her recipe best. :P The only thing I add to it from time to time is a few large spoonfuls of honey. It makes them taste just fantastic all by themselves! Oh, and I sometimes substitute heavy whipping cream in for the milk, just a little personal touch.

Excellent! After all the positive reviews, I was convinced to get up and make these first thing this morning for breakfast. I increased the sugar to 1T and used 1 tsp of salt. Instead of shortening I used butter and 2/3 cup of buttermilk. I kneaded the dough, rolled into 1 inch thickness and used a cup to cut out the biscuits. In a short time, I had 12 round biscuits placed upon a greased baking sheet. I brushed the top with a little melted butter right before placing them into the oven. I only had to bake these biscuits for 9 minutes. They rose up and expanded nicely. The buttery fragrance was so intense it made my mouth water while these baked. About 6 minutes into the baking, I saw a light brown color forming on top of the biscuits. As soon as the timer went off, I opened the oven to take the biscuits out and I got a nice whiff of buttery scent. I am so pleased with the way these turned out. The title of these biscuits fit perfectly - FLUFFY! They are not only fluffy, but moist, buttery and delicious! They feel light, taste tender and melts in my mouth.  From the smell, the appearance and taste this was just awesome good! I spread a little guava jelly on top of the warm biscuits thou' they could be eaten just by itself they are so flavorful! If you are thinking about baking these, try them! They are that good! I served these along with, "Breakfast Sausage," also from this website. All 12 biscuits were completely wiped out within minutes. That tells me a lot!!!

I'm not a biscuit maker. My husband is from the south and *loves* biscuits. Sadly, I make them every few years; sadder still is they're just shy of  awful.  I found this recipe and boy, did I WOW my husband with these. It had been so long since the last time I made biscuits that I think he forgot my poor biscuiting skills. He took one bite of these flaky, layered, high as the sky, made for TV biscuits and looked at me lovingly and said, "You make the BEST biscuits.", like it was a historical fact. Yes, they're that good; they gave my husband biscuit amnesia. I basked in the undeserved glory. This is one of those recipes I'm going to memorize. Love it.

*I made these twice. The first batch I put salt in it and used Land O' Lakes salted butter.  They came out too salty. I'm a salt nut too. The next time I omitted the salt but still used the salted butter. They came out even better. ** IMPORTANT** Also I read the reviews and I think it was J West who said she uses cold, cold butter, cut up and pulsed into the dry ingredients in her food processor. I did just that, then kneaded the dough only 20 times, rolled and cut to about 1 inch thick. I think this was a key to the yumminess of these biscuits. Holy guacamole. THESE biscuits give me a free pass into the South. Seriously. They're THAT good.

First of all I have to say that I don't think Ill be buying tubed biscuits from the store anytime soon after making this recipe! Easy and the dough was so easy to work with! I did do half shortening and half butter and rolled out thinner, started at 350 degrees then turned up to 400 degrees to brown and they turned out perfect and delicious!  After reading the ingredients on the back of tubed biscuits, not knowing what most of them are and why its needed Ill stick to homemade!

These biscuits were amazing! They fluffed up nicely for me and they tasted so good. I made these biscuits to go along with the [Super Sausage Gravy] recipe found on here. Sausage Biscuits-n-Gravy is a great comfort food and these biscuits fit the bill!

These are the BEST biscuits every, they were phenomenal! they have just the right sweetness and are perfectly fluffy :)!!! I didn't roll out the dough, but i just sorta balled them and stuck them on a baking stone! I always make my biscuits like that. when i do that they always come out crispy ALL over and soft and fluffy in the inside!!! I added 1/2 teaspoon more sugar that made it just right! catherine~ I wish I could rate it more than five stars, id would defiantly make it to 100 stars!!!!!!!

Very good, but very sticky dough, maybe my egg was extra large. I had to add an extra 1/4 cup+ flour to handle it. But after kneading it was perfect. Baked up tall and tender as promised.

This recipe is a snap to put together in a food processor.  And the end result is a buttery, fluffy, flaky pillow of deliciousness!  I always substitute the shortening with butter.  Simply put all dry engredients into the bowl of your processor and pulse a few times to sift.  Cut one stick of butter into 12 or so pats and distribute them evenly on top of the flour mixture.  Pulse a few times to cut the butter into the flour.  Mix your egg and milk together in a separate bowl, then just dump it into the processor with the flour.  Pulse a few more times to create the dough.  Then turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead as instructed.  We don't care what our biscuits look like, so I just roll them out and then cut them into squares.  Easy peasy!  These only take me about 10 minutes to throw together in this manner and they are always delicious!

I make terrible biscuits. Until NOW! This recipe is amazing. I followed some reviews and used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup crisco - perfect! All the flavor from the butter, all the lightness from the shortening.  There's only 2 of us and this made A LOT of biscuits, and i was worried about the leftovers. I'm writing this the next day and we just ate the last of them and they're even good cold!! This recipe earned me a kiss on the cheek AND a smack on the bottom from my honey - high praise indeed! :)

This is great!  My family loves these biscuits and I make them all the time.  But do NOT knead 20 times.  I knead 10 times and everything is blended enough.  If you knead 20 times, it comes out not as light and flaky.  Also, I used this recipe to make drop biscuits.  They come out great that way!

I also used butter instead of shortening and they still came out fluffy and delicious. And my little secret to making them irresistible is adding a half tablespoon of  garlic powder and a half cup of shredded cheddar! SO SO delectable!

When I make biscuits or pie crust I always use half shortening (for flakiness) and half butter (for taste), so that's what I did for this recipe. Everything else was done as written....except I brushed melted butter on the top of the biscuits when they came out of the oven. These were very tender and they rose up nicely. I would add a little more salt to the recipe because to me they were a tad bland.

Alright ..so here's the deal...I've been using JP's Big Daddy Biscuits recipe from this site for a while now, and I thought they were pretty darn tasty...until I came across THIS recipe! Oh my goodness, these are perfect with a capital "P".  I used half shortening/half salted butter, and just patted the dough instead of kneading it.  I practically had to restrain myself from eating all of them!  These are definitely replacing my old biscuit recipe in my collection.   Also: After cutting the biscuits and putting them into the lightly greased pan, I refrigerated them for a couple of hours before baking.  I discovered that tip from my other recipe, I guess it helps them rise more :~)

I have made this recipe several times over the last four months. They are the fluffiest biscuits I have ever made, but I much prefer using butter rather than shortening, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. There is such a difference in the taste. Depending on how the biscuits were to be served, I have kneaded less and more, which does change the texture a bit: less being lighter and more being denser. We also use this recipe to roll out thin and make wraps for hot dogs. Simply roll the dough to 1/4 inch and cut to fit around a hot dog, plus about 1/4 inch (it stretches well if you are a tad short). Overlap the ends, wet the seam, and press to seal well. Place the hot dogs so the seam is at the bottom on top of the cooking sheet. Then finish by following the cooking directions for the biscuits as given in the recipe. There should be plenty to do a package of hot dogs with some left over. We just don't buy hot dog buns anymore!!!

These biscuits are easy to make and super tasty!!  I will make these again and again!!  I used a stick of butter instead of using shortening after reading some reviews and I have to agree- they are delicious!

A-mazing!! The fluffiest biscuits I ever made! Important to cut them out really thick (3/4 to an inch) and they get nice and tall and fluffy. Very flaky. My kids were in LOVE. :) Thank you so much! My new permanent biscuit recipe.

I made these yesterday morning, and I was pretty proud of myself. This was my first time to make biscuits from scratch and they came out awesome!  I used all butter instead of shortening other than that I stuck to the recipe.

Best biscuits I have ever had!! Amazingly tender and fluffy.  I live in Europe and here we don't have vegetable shortening so I used butter and margarine (I also added a bit more butter than the recipe calls for).  I made mine thicker so I only got 6 biscuits out of the recipe.  Once they came out of the oven, I brushed half of them with honey butter.  My husband loved them!!

I made these once, and they were nice tasting. They did turn out a bit dense and when you put them in your mouth it sucked all of the moisture out immediately. I'm not sure exactly what I did wrong, but I will try again! I only kneaded it a few times, maybe that was the problem? I'll try them again soon!

these are amazing!. i definitely used butter instead of shortening. and i experimented with the kneading and not kneading  as well, i found that kneading the 20 times makes them ever so slightly fluffier than when done only a few times.  i make a double batch and then freeze them. super yummy.

These are the best biscuits ever.  Husband ate them up.  Added a little vinegar to the milk to make it like buttermilk, and brushed the tops with butter after they came out of the oven.

I had never made biscuits from scratch in my life until I made these.  Perfection!!! I put the bowl of dry ingredients into the deep freeze for 30 min before making to ensure it was all cold. Following other suggestions I used 1 teaspoon salt, buttermilk instead of regular milk, and grated frozen butter into the flour instead of shortening. I only kneaded it 4-5 times until I was able to roll it out, then straight into the hot oven. My visiting mother-in-law is a life-long native Texan, and she admitted they were as good as any she has ever had. High praise, from her!

I've made so many biscuit recipes before, and they always seem to turn out overworked and hard. As another user did, I've tried just butter, just shortening and a combo of the 2. Today I tried 1/2 butter and 1/2 margarine, plus like another user suggested I dropped them using an ice cream scoop instead of rolling them out.  These turned out fantastic!!!  I heated my oven to 440, baked them for about 10-12 minutes on a silpat, and they turned out soo good!  The recipe yielded 8 nice-sized biscuits. These are perfect for biscuits and gravy or even just some nice jam spread on top.  Thanks for the great recipe, Nancy!

I would rate this four and a half stars if I could. It was great, we all loved it and it was easy to make, but it tasted almost exactly like my pie crust recipe! However, I personally love the taste of my pie crust, so I loved these biscuits. If you don't want pie-crust tasting biscuits, however, don't make this recipe!

GREAT recipe. I was in something of a hurry when I first made them, and as a result made them very sloppily, but they still turned out fantastically! Perks: very fast to make, almost no cleanup, and very tasty (especially with butter, honey-butter, or maple syrup honey-butter). I would recommend them.

I'd never been able to get biscuits "just right" always wanted to be too crumbly and to fall apart. This recipe was a lifesaver. Nice texture and flavor for jam and honey, or as I like to do, I add garlic and onion powder with some ital. seasoning to use as Breakfast biscuits to sandwich sausage or bacon and eggs.

These were very yummy!  I loved how flaky they were.  The dough was very wet and sticky when I turned it out though so the kneading surface has to be VERY well floured.  I would think you could add more flour at the beginning to reduce the stickiness and use less flour on the kneading surface.  I will try that next time. A definite keeper!

These were quite good.  I followed the recipe, except I used  butter flavored shortening.   They baked  up tall and fluffy as promised but did seem to be lacking just a little in the flavor dept.  However they are still 10 times better than canned biscuits!  That combined with the quickness and ease to make,  there really is no reason to ever buy canned again.

Very good! I even halved the recipe (still using one egg) and it was great. Although, I do think the full recipe makes less than 12 biscuits, so in the future I wouldn't halve it. Also, I replaced the shortening with butter.

Yessiree, these are as good as folks say they are. I don't know why, considering the fact that there's nothing radically different or unexpected about the ingredient list or directions, but I followed the instructions exactly and turned out the best batch of biscuits I've ever made. This is the new biscuit recipe around here for sure.

What went wrong?  Egg?  Sugar?
As a Southerner I like the "whang" of buttermilk in biscuits.  Oh well, thanks anyway Nancy.

I loved them! I decided to experiment with half the dough by adding about a teaspoon of minced garlic and some cheese (any kind shredded) to make a pseudo cheddar bay biscuit. I wish they were a little bit more moist though.

These were really good biscuits. I even made a mistake by adding in 3/4 cup milk instead of 2/3 cup milk. I just added more flour and they still came out great. I figure any recipe I can goof on that still comes out nicely deserves every star. The dough was VERY sticky, though. It did make approximately 12 decent sized biscuits.

These biscuits were easy to make and baked up beautifully.  However I did not like the taste.  They had a bitter taste and after taste to them.  I cooked them per the recipe.

So much better than Bisquick biscuits.  So light and fluffy.  My husband LOVES biscuits and these will be a regular fixture in our house.  My recipe made 7 large biscuits.  I used half butter flavored shortening and half unsalted butter, about 3/4 t. salt.  Otherwise, followed the directions almost exactly (not sure how many times it was kneaded and folded).

Excellent!  My husband actually said he liked them better than Pillsbury.  This is my new go-to recipe.  It didn't even take me 10 minutes to put them together.  Thanks Nancy!!

WOW this was my first time making home made biscuits they were easy fast and soo soo soo yummy and fluffy. Thank you so much Nancy. I didn't need it 20 times because I didn't want it to become to hard. Also I made 3 of them then frefrigerated the dough and made then the next few days and they were just as yummy.. 
The next day we had a braai (BBQ) and I added 1/3 cup cheddar cheese, parsley more salt, garlic powder, onion flakes about a teaspoon each and had cheese biscuit with dinner super yumm yumm..

These biscuits were awesome.  I made them with butter instead of shortening, and used my cuisinart to cut in the butter.  It saved so much time and energy!  These are also the tallest biscuits I have ever seen and they were flaky!  I've tried other biscuit recipes, but this one is the winner!

I would give these 10 stars if I could. I was looking for a recipe that was like my grandmothers and this is it! They baked up tall, and light. Super tasty! I only added 1 teaspoon of sugar and they were the BEST!!!!!

For not being Buttermilk, these were GREAT.  Fluffy and tasty. I placed them on a silicone baking sheet on a cookie sheet and didn't need cooking spray, they slide right off.  I also used butter flavored Crisco.  I made my biscuits larger than I guess is normal so they had to bake about 3-4 minutes longer than the minimum time (my oven always cooks things on the minimum time limit), then I left them in the hot oven with it turned off while I finished the meal and I think they finished baking perfectly!  YUM.  My kids give it a "thumbs up".

These are BY FAR the best biscuits I have ever made. I followed the recipe exactly except for using butter instead of shortening and the result was AWESOME. One mention: it seems best to add the egg first, mix as much as you can and then add the milk a couple tablespoons at a time. Sometimes, it will take the full amount, but often it takes significantly less.

Just what I was looking for!  I don't use a biscuit-cutter; I just plop them onto a greased tray by the rounded tablespoonful.  You can skip the kneading and rolling steps and save a little time.  They cook up great and the look is a little more rustic.  YUM!  My 4-year old loved them!

I stuck to the recipe 100% other than cutting it down to make 6 biscuits instead of 12...Turned out amazing! Perfect! These biscuits are perfectly light and fluffy.  I may try with 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter next time just to try but, I didn't find the recipe as is bland at all.  Thanks for this recipe!

Best biscuits I've everr made in my 70 yrs.  I don't eat biscuits too much for myself, just like to make for others.  But, I couldn't get over how fluffy and light they are, I actually enjoyed them.  I sort of guess it's because of the amount of baking powder, which is more than normal biscuits are. A+++++++++

I woke up this morning remembering the dream I had about my moms biscuits and gravy.  So I go into the kitchen and reach in the refrigerator for the canned biscuits.  These aren't biscuits.  They are crescent rolls.  I've never had crescent rolls before but figured I'd give it a try.  I hit the thingy on the side of the counter and POP!! Out comes....something?  There is no way I can make these things resemble a biscuit.  Aha! Bisquick! Bisquick has saved me more times than I can count.  Must have been a lot more than I can count because I'm out of bisquick.  Not ready to give up, I run to my trusted friends on AR.  I am lucky enough to choose this recipe.  These are absolutely amazing!  Light, fluffy..perfect.  Now the gravy...well, that's another story!

These were fluffy and easy to make, and were good with butter and jam, but the biscuit itself was bland (even though I used 1/2 butter flavored shortening and 1/2 butter).  I think they need buttermilk and/or extra salt to add flavor.  It's a good base recipe to work from, though.

Light and fluffy, YES!  I used whole wheat white flour and very cold butter instead of shortening. (I don't keep shortening on hand anymore.) I can't stress enough to use a pastry dough blender if you can, it really helps to keep hot hands out of your biscuit dough for a fluffier biscuit. These turned out perfectly. I used these biscuits to sop up the Chicken Crouton Hot Dish I made and it was just great for it.

So good they ought to be illegal. Fluffed up beautifully.  I used 2 1/4 tsp double acting baking instead of the 4 tsp, used unsalted butter and substituted the milk with buttermilk. I also put in some freshly ground pepper and topped with some cheddar cheese.

Excellent. The kneading does make them fluffier (as per the first reviewer) Also letting the dough rest helped me too. Doing the half butter/half shortening also an excellent tip! I forgot the sugar...and didn't miss it at all. Thank you for the recipe!

I did something wrong!!!!  My dough was way too wet, maybe my egg was too big?  Not knowing exactly what went wrong, I decided to make the best of the situation and make "drop biscuits" instead.  Turned out fabulous!  They are light as a feather and taste great.  To the bad reviewers that say that they're not wowed by this recipe I say this: this wonderful recipe knows its place and doesn't try to be the star of the show.  It's a great compliment to almost any meal, spread, or topping.  It also services as an alternative to a knife for helping you scoop up food off your plate and it is also good for sopping up gravies and other delectables off your plate.    So again to the people giving this a bad review I think they've got the wrong idea about what a biscuit is suppose to be.  Now that I know what wonderful drop biscuits these make, I plan to make these again and I'll try to reproduce my mistake which was probably putting "too much" milk in it.

WOW....I've tried lots of biscuit recipes, but these by far are the best.  I did make one change, based on other recommendations.  I used cold, real butter.  I made these this morning and me and my son both ate two. Out go the other recipes; this will be my "new" go-to biscuit recipe. Thanks Nancy for a phenomenal recipe.

Really really good, and so easy. I used half butter and half shortening, and buttermilk. If you are using buttermilk or soured milk, use 3 tsps baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda. Tasty and tender.

The best Biscuit Recipe by far have used this for a couple years and never with a failed batch. it is simple and it is good you cant get any better than this for a good American country Biscuit and peppered Gravy meal.

I have also used it a few times by adding.

1/4 small white onion diced

1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese

2 tsp. chicken bouillon

If you have ever had "Red Lobster" Biscuits this is very close but still missing a little "some thing"

LOVE these. But I did 8 TBLs of butter, 1/3 cup whole whipping cream, 2/3 cup of milk instead. VERY yummy. Also, 1 egg whisked with some whole whipping cream for an egg wash. Perfect!

This was my FIRST time making biscuits from scratch!  SUPER EASY!!!  I did use butter instead of shortening b/c that's what I had around but, they came out AMAZING!  They were fluffy and flaky and my husband and daughter LOVED them.  I will most definitely make these again!!

These are absolutely amazing!! The only change I made was that I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose (I had noticed that I didn't have any). Next time, I will roll out the dough a bit thicker for higher biscuits. Will definitely make again! Thanks for sharing, Nancy!

I hate to say that I was kind of disappointed in this recipe. I made it a few times,really wanting a flaky,tasteful biscuit. But every time they came out "dense",and the flavor was left wanting. I followed the recipe to the exact word and the last time I finally used buttermilk-same results each time. They still looked pretty,just really not what I read from all the other reviews. I used all shortening as the recipe called for and not butter as I am usually accustomed to using. Maybe that was what was missing? I submitted a picture anyway,because like I said they did look pretty to me.

Best biscuits ever. Replaced 1/2 cup shortening with 1/4 cup shortening & 1/4 cup salted butter (which took care of the suggestion by other reviewers that more salt be added). The biscuits were tender, soft, flaky and had a great flavor. Rolled dough out to 1.5 inch thickness. Baked for 10 minutes. Came out tall and fluffy.

This recipe is very easy and incredibly delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe called for, using all butter for the shortening because it's what I have on hand. We've made them twice this week now, once with beef stew and then once for breakfast sandwiches. They'll be a regular now!

I thought these were very good, went together easily and came out fluffy.  They were a little too sweet for my taste (and my hubby's) so next time I'll use 1 tsp less sugar.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 butter and half shortening.

These biscuits turned out terrific!  I have never had much luck making biscuits, but based on others comments, I decided to try the recipe and am very glad I did.  This is definitely a recipe I will make again.  I took the suggestions of others and used half butter and half shortening.

These were amazing!  I made a couple changes per others reviews.  I used 1 tsp course salt, butter instead of shortening, and buttermilk and mixed it all in a food processor.  I also brushed the top with milk to get a nice color.  These were really good!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used an organic shortening with palm oil instead of crisco.  Very easy and definitely the best and flakiest biscuits I've ever made.  This will be the go to biscuit recipe in our house.

Lovely little biscuits. I used 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup butter. Gave them structure and a great flavor. Easy to make.

Love these! They came out nice and high and were delicious fresh. I've made them several ways now, including subbing buttermilk for the milk, using self-rising flour and omitting salt & baking powder, using 1/2 butter and half shortening, all shortening, and all butter depending on what I have on hand. The recipe as written turned out the best IMO but all were good. These are excellent with sausage gravy.

nice and easy. This is a good recipe for when I don't have enough cheese to make my usual cheese biscuit. I did use butter instead of shortening, which I shredded and kept in the freezer until ready to use. The dough was a bit wet, so I put a bit extra flour on the counter and on my hands. Nice fluffy biscuits.

I've been making biscuits since I was a pre-teen. I love them, LOVE them! I wanted to try a different recipe, and this one called my name since it had an egg in it, a change from the recipes I've used. These are AMAZING. Flaky, tasty, and you can peel the layers of biscuit off each one.. Kind of like refrigerated biscuits but without that nasty pre-made flavour. Oh, and I used margarine in place of shortening, so the biscuit tops sort of slid off the bottoms while baking.. but they were excellent anyways! This will be my go-to for biscuits! Thanks for sharing!

Very very good. I followed one reviewer's comment, used half butter and half shortening. Came out perfect. I also added 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar, turned them into cheddar biscuits. Just heavenly! I'm from the South, this is pretty close to those truck stop biscuits :)

excellent, best english scone recipe, to be enjoyed with jam, keep well. I will reduce milk to 1/3, as this was way too moist and had to add more flour. I also used some vanilla. Brushed with milk before baking.

My recipe that I use all the time is similar so I know it is good without trying the exact recipe but I have a question for some of the other reviewers.  How do you increase the sugar to 1T or decrease to 2T when it calls for 3 teaspoons.  Three teaspoons = 1T.

I have always used a similar recipe but I use self rising flour, just elimiate the baking powder and salt and I do not use sugar either.  Great biscuits, my mother made them almost every night.

I followed this recipe as directed and they were horrible -- not fluffy, no flavor, dry and all I tasted was flour.  Not sure what I did wrong but I will not be making these ever again.

I have to admit I was skeptical about these biscuits--especially since there is an egg in them. I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. The egg keeps the biscuits from falling apart as they are very tender. I happened to have butter flavored shortening. It was a good thing because if I had used plain shortening the biscuits would have been tasteless. Another note: at first the dough seemed too sticky and I was tempted to add more flour. The dough ended up sitting for a couple minutes and it set up, it wasn't too sticky to work with anymore. Really great biscuits--I'll probably make them again!

These rose up nicely. I cut this in half and got 6 biscuits. They seemed a little bland though so maybe next time I will use melted butter instead of shortening. I couldn't tell that the egg made any difference over recipes not using it so I would skip the egg next time. These held up well under gravy and were sturdy enough not to crumble.

I followed the advise of the last review and increased the salt to 1 tsp. I used butter instead of shortening. Decreased the sugar to 2Tbs. I mixed only until combined. The biscuits turned out AWESOME! Very good biscuit.

Excellent recipe if you like light and airy biscuits. Easy to make in food processor. I used butter instead because vegetable shortening has transfat.

My whole family loves this recipe! I agree with others who have made these biscuits that you should use butter instead of shortening. But other than that this recipe makes divine biscuits! We love them with honey, with anything creamy, and even sometimes add finely shredded cheddar and use them as a dipper with tomato soup!

These are really good. I made them as the recipe states, and they turned out really well and are quite tasty, even using the shortening they call for. No, they won't have quite as buttery of a taste if you use shortening instead of butter, but they're still really good. They're also quite easy to make, and you can make a nice biscuit whether you roll and cut them or shape them by hand. (Obviously, the cut ones look a bit tidier and more like "traditional" biscuits.) I'd highly recommend this recipe for a quick, easy, tasty biscuit recipe!

This recipe is fool-proof. So easy, really nice flavor and great consistency. The only think I did differently was that I used butter instead of shortening. The 4 tsp of baking soda insure these biscuits will be very fluffy! My new go-to biscuit recipe.

Wow! I love these biscuits! I was looking for something to go along with chicken and rice, and these came up. They were delicious. They pull in half pretty easily and go great with butter and jelly or honey. For a substitute of shortening, I used butter. They remind me of Cracker Barrel's biscuits! I highly recommend these!

Yumm! Used Golden Crisco, since that's what I had. Patted lightly and folded, as one reviewer said, and they were high and light.  Had one warm from the oven with butter and honey.  What could be better?!  It's a keeper for me!  Thanks

Following this recipe is the first time I have EVER made a good batch of biscuits. I think the 3 teaspoons of sugar are too much though. Too sweet. I cut the sugar back to 1 teaspoon and use lard instead of shortening and use half wheat flour half white.
Very yummy!

These are the best biscuits that I've made. Tasty and easy.  I don't use a cutter for my biscuits.  I just flatten to a 1" rectangular shape, cut it into six and cook them at 350 for about 20 minutes.  Next time I will try them with cheese. So Good

The first time that I made this recipe, I was not at all impressed. My rolls tasted just like baking soda. Ugh. Turns out the recipe is better when you use the ingredients that are listed rather than substituting (inadvertently) baking soda for baking powder. The next batch, when using only the ingredients listed were a huge hit. Everyone scarfed down the biscuits and let their soup get cold. Me too. Great recipe and easy. I've never been successful at making beautiful biscuits til now.

I would actually give it a 3 1/2...I did use half butter and half shortening as others suggested, but other than that I followed to a T! They were easy to make, and super fluffy, but they still tasted too much like baking powder. With butter and jam they tasted good, but I will think keep looking!

This is the only biscuit recipe I use.  They are not as good as my great grandmas recipe, but my family still likes them!  My kids always ask for more when I make these.  I use butter instead of the shortening.  I also bake them at about 400 degrees instead of 450.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've been searching for 9 years for the perfect biscuit recipe...and I've finally found it.  In previous years, I've had the NHL call me to make the pucks for their games.  All joking aside, these were awesome.  My husband was in awe that I was able to make them.    I did follow the recipe, with one change, I used butter instead of crisco, which I don't think made much of a difference.  I'm going to make another batch tonight, and I think I'm going to add some shredded cheese and add melted garlic butter to the top.   Thank you, so much for this awesome recipe.

Very good. Definitely will make again.  The use of an egg in the biscuit mix was unusual, but a good thing...it helps to give the mix loft and flavor. Some other reviewers have said that the use of shortening in place of butter makes the biscuits lack flavor, but I did not personally think so. I avoided butter due to a dairy insensitivity and felt that the shortening was perfectly fine.  These were easy to make (prep time about 5 mins) and cooking time was as listed. Some hints to consider: use a sharp sided cutter to create loft and make sure your oven is HOT and up to the proper temp. Biscuits like a hot, short cooking time for maximum loft and fluffiness. Also, don't knead the dough much, just enough to bring it together, roll it out (I often just pat it into shape with my hands) and then cut it. More handling makes tougher end results. Use the least amount of flour on your rolling surface that you can get away with using. These things make for the best results.  Enjoy!

This recipe was amazing! SO fluffy and light!!!  My confession; in my haste to get supper on the table, I neglected to the read the directions. I dumped all the ingredients in the bowl, beat them with my electric hand mixer, scooped them with an ice cream scoop (an idea from another reviewer on this site!). I also threw some oregano, basil, rosemary, and parmesan cheese into the batter.  I guess to sum up....if a recipe can withstand my negligence and bizarre time-saving methods, I say it's worth keeping!

Okay made these using my food processor (even to add milk & egg). Made using half butter and half Cold shortening.  Turned out great. Than made another batch using 1 cup flour and 1 cup wheat flour and these were AWSOME! If you like to bakme with wheat flour you have to try these!!

I have made these many times over successfully using a basic gluten free flour blend instead of wheat flour. The results are always great.

Nancy these biscuits are wonderful.  I have made them twice now and they have come out perfect each time.  I did substitute butter flavored shortening instead of the plain one. Thanks.

Great recipes. I have never made biscuits without a mix before. These were very easy and the family loved them. I took some suggestions and used half butter and half shortening. I did not roll them out , I just scooped them onto the cookies sheet and they came out great.

Yeah, they're good. I wouldn't give it 4.5 stars though.  I will be making them again though, and next time I'll use a butter-flavored shortening, and maybe add some butter. Also, the specification for thickness is all wrong if you want really fluffy biscuits. I halved the recipe and only got 3 biscuits out of it. (and they were an average Pillsbury size, I was hoping for bigger n fluffier). I also kneaded them MAYBE a total of 3 times...not the 10 stated...I imagine if I did they would have come out even worse.

Nancy, I would like to thank you so very much for this recipe. I did change 2 small things according to some of the reviews and upped the salt/sugar content and used half shortening and half butter. The reason I want to thank you is because this is EXTREMELY close to the way my mother used to make biscuits for our Saturday morning breakfast or she would make them and put sausage in them and freeze them for quick breakfasts thru the week. I have been trying for a very long time to make biscuits the way she did and just couldn't get it right. My mother passed away due to cancer in 2005 when I was only 24, so I really didn't have an opportunity to get into cooking very much and ask her for the recipes she kept in her mind. This recipe means a lot to me and I appreciate you posting it on this site so that I could find it. I would give it 50 stars for sentimental value if I could...Thank you, again. ~Ambrea

These were excellent! And easy....I used butter in place of the shortening, and they were perfect.  I wish I'd have added a touch more salt, and used a bigger cutter (I used a glass from the cupboard) but other than that they were flakey and delish with honey!

I followed the recipe, except used real butter cuz it was all i had.  made sure the butter was cold.  I had a gooey mess on my hands!!  Was able to salvage with extra flour.  I also added white vinegar to the milk (ONE teaspoon) to curdle it more like buttermilk.... (should've made the mixture thicker, honestly)  Are my eggs bigger than others?    We DID end up adoring the finished product!!  Will use this recipe again, as the family loved it.  Will also try to figure out my mistake.    (must be mine ~ the reviews are AWESOME!!)


10-25 ~ Used this recipe again.  reduced milk to 1/2 cup.  still too much.  I will use again and try just 1/3 cup.  Still love the flavor...  ;)

Even though I cut these biscuits too thin (my fault), they were still fluffy. I also enjoyed their mild flavor, not at all bitter like some recipes.

Excellent biscuits!  I used the buttermilk version recommended by Mary Lynne 5.   Before I baked the biscuits I dipped them in melted butter and rolled them in cinnamon and sugar.  They turned out delicious!

Using half butter flavor shortening and half butter, these are the best and flakiest homemade biscuits we've ever had! My teenage daughter had friends over, and they gobbled them up! I follow the directions as-is, except that I roll them half as thick to begin with, then fold the dough over in half, and roll again lightly to compress. This makes them hold together, but creates a natural split when they're ready to be eaten. They're deluxe topped with butter and honey or with sausage gravy ladled over the top of split biscuits. This recipe works perfectly well with spelt flour as well. This one's a keeper!

The lightest biscuits I've ever tasted.  Since I did not have an egg, I omitted it and added 2 T more milk.  I've made these biscuits many times, sometimes I use butter, other times margarine, crisco, or butter flavored crisco.  Just heavenly.

These are outstanding biscuits! I've always had problems baking them...they always seem to come out hard and dry. But not these! I made a double batch for my big family, and they were gone that same day! Everyone loved these biscuits, and requested that I make them again! I thought that 4 tsp. of baking powder was a bit excessive, so I cut it down to 3 tsp. This worked really well...the biscuits rose high and were light and fluffy. I found the dough to be very sticky, so I had to flour the counter a lot when kneading the dough. This wasn't a big deal though...the biscuits were worth it! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...I'm going to make these often!!!

these are pretty tasty, I had to use butter instead of shortening because I didn't have any.  But they didn't puff up very well for me. Besides the butter, I did everything the recipe said to...still good, though

These biscuits are perfect. I took J. H. West's advice and used all butter, since she experimented with all shortening, half butter-half shortening, and all butter. I could taste the small amount of sugar. I used a 2 1/2 inch biscuit cutter and only got about 10 biscuits. I'm afraid to double the recipe for fear of compromising the recipe. I would like to use a larger biscuit cutter. So, I'll just have to make the recipe twice. Another reviewer said that when she kneaded the dough more than the recipe called for, the biscuits rose higher. She is right. Great recipe. Thanks Nancy Katherine

This was great though I removed some of the salt from the recipe and substituted butter for shortening.  TIP freeze stick of butter and grate into flour saves cutting in.

I made these for thanksgiving and everyone really enjoyed them. I followed the recipe exactly, except for substituting butter for shortening (I didn't have any, but I think next time I will try shortening to see if they come out flakier). Also, I was at my uncle's house so I had to improvise on some of the equipment- haha I used a floured beer bottle to roll the dough out, a cup to cut out the biscuits, and a muffin tray to bake them in since I couldnt find a cookie sheet! They still came out great. I will definitely bake them on a cookie sheet next time and brush the tops with milk so they brown. Also, they don't need to be kneaded much, just fold the dough in half maybe 15 times. Great, easy recipe!

The taste of these biscuits is great! For some reason I've been having problems with my biscuits lately and was looking for a new recipe.  The only thing wrong with these is that 2/3 cup of milk is way too much.  I made three batches, baked them for seven minutes to freeze and use later (love doing this) and in the last batch I cut the milk back to half a cup.  That was just right!  All in all, I was really happy with this.

We made some biscuits from "Joy of cooking" and they were awful and we threw them away. we tried these and we followed this recipe to the T. They turned out VERY fluffy and yummy. I would agree that the outside had a little bit of a flour taste from when you rolled it on the floured counter, but what do you expect, you just rolled it on a floured counter! These were VERY fluffy, and were great. we will probably use this recipe again. At 3/4" thickness it only made 7 1/2 biscuits.

Thank you so much for this recipe, I have looked every where for a good biscuit recipe.  I tried this one and my family went nuts, they loved them. 

After reading a review,the lady said they were dryer than she liked, I too put 1 cup of milk.  They were wonderful and my family applauded me.  Thank you!

I just made these. I followed other people's suggestions of substituting the Crisco with butter. They are still so bland. This is almost like eating a fistful of flour, and I know my way around the kitchen. I think I will look for a different recipe.

I cook a lot, I mean A LOT...and these biscuits are the best! I followed the recipe exactly and they came out fantastic. I didn't have an egg one time so I added meringue powder and added more shortening and it still came out perfect!!! i love them. P.S. i ate them all in one day!!!!

Excellent and easy. I was able to adapt this recipe for my fructose-intolerant son by substituing dextrose for the table sugar and butter for the shortening. A great accompaniment to any meal. Next time, I think I'll try sprinkling some toasted wheat germ on the tops. Thanks for the great recipe.

These were good though I like buttermilk biscuits a little better.  They were fluffy, easy to make and ever tender.  I did double the recipe when I made them and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening.

Oddly enough, my biscuit tops didn't brown ... even after trying an egg wash AND brushing butter on top.  Was definitely FLUFFY!! REALLY bland! Next time, opting shortening for butter .. does anyone know how to get golden brown tops?

I have tried making homemade biscuits for years. My mom always used a mix and they always turned out wonderful, mine always turn out more like little bricks. I can't tell you how many boxes I have bought over the years thinking I had let the stuff go bad and that was the reason for my biscuits tasting like rocks. But this recipe worked PERFECTLY! Light and fluffy with a wonderful taste. I can't wait to add cheese and garlic and serve them for dinner!

These biscuits are delicious! I used butter because I don't have any shortening and they tasted great. When they were done baking I also brushed the tops with some melted butter and parsley and then popped them back in the oven for 2 more minutes. Turned out great!

I never made biscuits before, but in trying to get rid of store bought junk, I decided to try them out. They were so much easier than I thought! Why haven't I done this all along??? Anyway, no need to look for another recipe - this one is wonderful! Next time, I will try it with butter. Yum!

These were excellent! Followed the previous reviews and only needed the bread about 4 times.  I also glazed the top of the biscuits with a garlic/butter/parsley mix and they were FABULOUS! Will use again.

I don't know why but my dough came out too moist to roll out. I ended up using the icecream scoop suggestion and scooping small balls onto the cookie sheet, and then flattening out the top with some milk and flour on the bottom of a measuring cup. However they do taste delicious! (I went with the full teaspoon of salt as recommended)

Like the reviewer before me, I have made them several different ways.  I've tried all butter, and half butter half butter flavored shortening.  Just like she stated, the all butter biscuits had a to die for flavor but the consistency was off.  The half half biscuits had the perfect consistency, but the flavor was less desirable. Since I always eat the biscuits with butter and salt or with jam, I prefer having the texture right and supplementing the taste with whatever I put on it. I have tried rolling the dough out and softly patting it out.  I find they rise better when you gently pat the dough to the desired thickness.  Also, I tried kneading 4 times and using a biscuit cutter, kneading 4 times and cutting a strip of dough and tying a knot, kneading 20x and using a biscuit cutter, and kneading 20x and cutting a strip and tying a dough knot.  Contrary to what most people are saying on here, like the reviewer before me, I found the 20x kneaded dough to rise TWICE as high as the 4x kneaded dough, and they were still just as tender and flaky.  With this recipe, I REALLY suggest kneading the full amount - I know that's against your best judgment, but trust me!  Also, the biscuits I tied in a knot shape were much larger and rose better than the disc shaped biscuits. So to sum it all up, for best results, don't skip on the kneading!

Delicious! I made them with whole wheat flour, all butter and used soy milk since that's all i had on hand. I brushed the top of half of them with leftover egg and sprinkled them with parmesan-herb topping.  Also, i did the dry ingredients and butter in the food processor until coarse then added the liquid and pulsed just til the dough came together. I kneeded the dough just til it was smooth. Great biscuits!

Made this biscuit yesterday.  Wow...it was moist, tender and flaky!  I used butter instead of vegetable shortening. :-)  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

These were easy and came out great! I kneaded them outside the bowl and let them rest before I cut & baked them.

This is the best biscuit recipe!  I've made it repeatedly, the only change I make is to add a little less baking powder as the flavor as is it too strong.

These turned out just like mom's! I made the changes others suggested and did 1 T of sugar, 1 t salt, 1/2 butter and 1/2 Crisco.  Its worth noting if you use salted butter adjust the salt added, if you use just plain Crisco add all the salt.

WOW! These were great! I used half shortening - half butter (like others suggested) and they turned out amazing. I've NEVER made buscuits from scratch ever and this recipe was easy enough for me to pull off on the first try! I fed a house full of Marines with this recipe (with the gravy recipe) - They all loved it!

I was looking for a recipe to replace my grandmother's as I recently moved away from home, and these came very close. My first batch was far too sweet however, and my fiance said they tasted more like scones with no flavor, but they still had a nice tender texture. So the second time I made them, i decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 tsp, increased the salt to 1 1/2 tsp, and used half butter half shortening. I also basted the tops with a wash made of 1 egg and 2tbsp cream. This second batch was much better, and even my mother-in-law to be asked for the recipe. Score!

I just love this recipe -  I have been searching for a good biscuit for years now.  My mother tried to show me how to make them, but to no avail.  I use cold butter instead of the shortening and have had great success.  I like the idea of adding garlic or onion powder and Italian seasoning to make a breakfast biscuit.  I also put melted butter on my biscuits as soon as they are out of the oven.  Great recipe.

Excellent biscuits!  Used other reviewers advice and did 1/4 C Cold Butter and 1/4 C butter flavored shortening.  I did notice I had rolled them to 1/2 inch, those biscuits didn't rise as high as the set that I rolled to 3/4 inch - go figure.  
Very light, very flaky... yum!

I was pleasantly surprised by how these biscuits held there shape with the cookie cutters I used. I made circle, cat and dinosaur biscuits! they kept their shape and were fluffy, moist and crisp on the outside. The only change I made was I added one cup of shredded cheddar cheese. Loved this recipe! will definitely be making again, maybe cows next time :)

My 7 year old grandson made these (with a little help of course) but basically he did everything.  He'd rolled the dough a little thin so after cutting them out he made little stacks of two and baked them that way.  They were out of this world.  The best biscuits any of us had ever had.  We used butter for the shortening.

Very good flavor, but didn't rise very much at all. Perhaps my baking powder had "fizzed out" already? I will try these again with a new container of baking powder! Family enjoyed the "biscuit disks" mommy made - I'm sure it was the powder. Thanks for the recipe!

Love these bisuits!! I have made them three times and am getting better at it! I have now decided that half butter and half shortening gives much more flavor and that if I keep them thick when I cut them they will have lovely cracks and be so beautiful!

Easier to make than you would expect and yummy!  I used half butter and half shortening, as others suggested.  I did notice a bitter after taste, but I think that's because I was a little too generous with the baking powder--figuring bigger is better.

This is a great recipe! We have a large family so I always double the recipe. The only critique I have is that it is always a little too sticky/wet. I have to add a lot of flour to the work surface and the rolled dough to get it to be "workable." But they come out very fluffy and flaky. My family loves them! Thanks for the recipe!

Edited to add..... don't overwork these, they will be fluffier and buttery if you only knead a few times, until the dough is together and can be rolled out.  20 times kneading is too much.

I've never made a biscuit recipe with egg before. I really liked the taste. I used shortening, but I see how butter would be more tasty. I pat the dough into a rectangle and cut into rectangles instead of rolling out and cutting circles, which leaves scraps. I also kneaded half as much as called for, since I did not want to make the dough tough. I would like to make them again. Thank you.

This recipe was SO GOOD!!! I cut out the lard for a stick of butter (cold). It was hard wrestling it in to the dough but turned out perfect!!! Just remember to follow the kneading of the dough.

These biscuits came out so fluffy, they almost fell apart while eating them! Great addition to my meal. I took the advice of substituting cold butter, as I didn't have shortening on hand, and used one tsp of salt. Definitely a recipe I will use again and again!

I've tried many biscuit recipes and so far this is one of the best.  I use half butter and half shortening just BC of personal preference...  These bake up very fluffy, although I usually have to bake a tad longer than recipe states so the inside isn't still doughy.

Great biscuits!  I used half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour and mixed the dry ingredients in a food processor as another reviewer suggested.  I also cut in the butter (I used all butter as opposed to shortening--and I am a southern belle through and through) that way, then transferred to a bowl before adding the milk and egg mixture. Quick, easy, and tasty biscuits!  Will use again!  :)

omg! So delicious and so easy and quick. I used 1 stick of cold butter instead of shortening , and mixed into the flour mixture till a little crumbly. Kneaded only 4 or 5 times on floured surface and patted it out till about 1 inch thick , then used the end of a 1/4 cup measuring cup to cut them.

This is the only biscuits recipe you need! We've made the same recipe for yearrrrs, but I'm so glad I tried something new. They are so flaky, light, rich and perfect. We had these for Canadian Thanksgiving dinner, and believe it or not, they were everyone's favourite dish! I added 1 cup grated cheddar and 2 Tbsp chopped chives, and it was perfect. Making them again tonight by popular demand.... but times 4! :)

Fantastic biscuit recipe.  I did have to alter it just a bit because I ran out of AP flour.  I used 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1 3/4 cup AP flour.  I intended to follow another user's suggestion of half shortening half butter, but only had two tablespoons of butter left, so I threw it in the measuring cup and filled it the rest of the way with shortening.  The biscuits were fabulous.  Light, flaky, and made really good sausage egg and cheese biscuits.  I totally recommend this recipe!

These were great on their own, but I also made them with 1/2 c of chopped pickled jalapeños and 1 c of grated sharp cheddar and they were delish! Now a favorite at potlucks!

I have to admit I have never made this recipe to eat as just biscuits alone. My hubby doesn't like biscuits. When he goes out of town, I like to make chicken and biscuits and I always use this recipe for the topper. It is fabulous!

I give this 3 1/2 because it was an easy recipe but still not quite as tasty as I hoped. They rose fine but the flavor was lacking, even after brushing with butter and sprinkling some with a cinn/sugar mix.

It's probably me as I've tried so many biscuit recipes and they just don't turn out fluffy or tall.  They were bland as another reviewer stated and I followed the directions to a T, so not sure why they didn't rise as much as other cooks attempts.

Excellent!  I, too, used butter.  I put the dry ingredients into the food processor and pulse a couple of times to "sift" then add cubed cold butter and pulse  a few times again then transfer to a bowl to add the liquid ingredients.  Last time I made these I tried the folding technique explained in the AR article on baking powder biscuits and it worked out really nice. If you're pressed for time, you can make these ahead, shape and place on baking pan and put in fridge until ready to bake, however when I do this I usually have to double the baking time.

So light and delicate and so yummy!!!  I did the all butter version and used a small ice cream scoop as someone suggested and they came out beautifully.  No, they were not perfectly round but that didn't affect the taste at all.

These biscuits sound delicious.  I am going to try them tomorrow. Everyone gave it a 5 star rating except for the person that "changed" the recipe...what does that tell you.  Maybe stick to the recipe and you might find that it tastes like it was meant to.

Couldn't resist making these and they are wonderfull.  Used butter as didn't have shortening. Added 1/2 tsp addional salt.  These deserve a rating of at least 10.  Took 12 min. to bake.  Have eaten 3 and I just took them out of the oven.  Great, Great, Great

Absolutely gorgeous biscuits. I have only ever used [a popular baking mix] to make biscuits but I live in Scotland now and it's very hard to find it in the shops. In desperation, I thought I'd try to find a recipe that would allow me to bake reasonable biscuits, never expecting that they would be BETTER than the ones from the mix. 

To quote the family, these are: "Brilliant!" (the 8-year-old) "Delicious!" (the 11-year-old) "magnificent" (the 42-year-old). lol 

I did have a moment's pause when I got the dough mixed up, as it was very sticky and I couldn't imagine how I would manage to roll it out (I'm not much of a cook). However, I followed the instructions, applied a lot of flour to the outside and it turned into the loveliest dough. A bit of kneading, rolling and cutting out and we had perfect biscuits that baked up flaky and soft on the inside and buttery-crispy on the outside. Delicious. Sorry, I know I'm raving but...seriously. Great recipe.  I don't think we'll be going back to the mix.

I forgot  the salt and didn't knead them long enough, but these were great!  The best biscuit recipe I've found yet!  

I know people say not to over work biscuit dough or else it will become too dense, which is true (I make biscuits at work every morning) you do need to work the dough *some* so that they'll rise.  My first few wound up being two inch biscuits when they came out of the oven.  But after re-working the dough once more, they were perfect and tall!  

On a side note:  in my opinion, you don't need to knead the dough-- pressing it out and folding the edges in to make a loaf shape a few times is all it needs. All-out kneading (in my experience) can ruin the texture and the volume, depending on how it's done.

Not the best. They turned out pretty dry. I liked the biscuits I made from the Joy of Cooking much better.

I love homemade biscuits with either honey or jam and a hot cup of coffee.  I forgot to check for skim milk prior to mixing my ingredients, so I used “Silk Soymilk”.  I also used the Crisco Butter flavored shortening.  These biscuits turned out GREAT with these substitutions (see picture).   I love this receipt.

Best biscuit recipe I have found to date. It tastes just like my great great grandmother's biscuits, so for me it's a winner! The biscuits are flakey on the outside and perfectly done on the inside. My kids beg for these now.

These biscuits are identical to the recipe my German mother used, so delicious! In German we call them "Schnatya", and the only thing  I do different is to sprinkle sugar over the tops before I bake, exactly like my mother did.

This is my new go-to biscuit recipe.  I did half shortening, half butter and kneaded about 10 times.  So flaky and light.  Loved every bite.

These biscuits never fail. It's become a household favorite. With a few substitutions, this recipe makes a great vegan biscuit as well. I use 1 tablespoon applesauce for the egg, soy milk or almond milk and I make sure I use vegetable shortening. They turn out great every time!

Best yet! Also great with Butter instead of shortening and Buttermilk instead of milk. Makes a great camping biscuit cooked in a Dutch oven, just put extra oil in, place biscuit in and flip over once (to oil both sides) and bake over coals with oven lid on. MMmmm!

Extraordinary, fluffy, flavorful, melt-in-your-mouth biscuits. I used 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup butter, added another tspn of sugar, and drizzled melted butter over the biscuits before putting them in the oven. Perfect!

My family and I loved these biscuits! I made these the other night to go with some homemade honey peach jam and they were wonderful with and without the jam. I did however make some adjustments. I doubled the recipe and ended up using less of the milk/egg mixture. I also had no shortening or butter so I used my coconut oil. It turns out that this is now a family favorite. They smelled great while baking and came out fluffy, flaky and with a hint of coconut flavor. MMMMMM...so delicious! Ohh, I used about 3 spoonfuls of honey as the sweetener as I had no sugar. They are fabulous!

I never seem to have any luck with biscuits, but with this recipe, I got it right.  I'm not into shortening, so I used butter.  Instead of cutting in the butter, I squished it with my hands.  Felt yucky but it did the trick.  I didn't roll, just flattened with my hands.  They are fluffy and perfect!

I made these to use as shells for mini meat pies and they were divine.  There was some dough left over, so I made drop biscuits with that - also fantastic!  I used butter instead of shortening and found the taste and texture to be very nice.

I made these biscuits for a weekend breakfast and they were great.  I was concerned about a couple of reviewers comments stating they were bland, so I added another 1/4 tsp. of salt and used butter instead of the shortning.  I also felt that the 4 tsp. of baking powder seemed unnecessary, so I experimented and cut back to 3 1/2 tsp. and they turned out great!  Very tasty, big and fluffy.  Although it doesn't say to do it, I always sift the flour in my baked goods.  I will use this one again.

Absolutely wonderful!  I am so pleased at how my biscuits turned out.  I have tried numerous recipes but this one turned out the BEST!  I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting butter for the shortening since I do not keep that on hand.  Thank you so much!

Great recipe! I gave up baking biscuits a long time ago, they were always similar to rocks. I can bake anything else, just not biscuits. I have been making homemade versions of my daughters favorite pre-made foods to save money. This recipe turned out fluffy! and moist! and paired with sausage patties, excellent replacement for the frozen variety from the grocery store. I just put some in the freezer, will update my post with info on how well they unfreeze :)

These were great and very easy. Who knew making biscuits from scratch would be so easy! Not me. My husband raved about them saying they were so much better then Bisquick ones. I used butter instead of shortening and white whole wheat flour. Yummy!

Looked beautiful; raised nicely and I followed the ingredients to the letter but something was missing.  
I will try this recipe one more time but maybe use butter instead of Crisco shortening.

As is, this is very bland. Modifying it a bit would make a great start. The half butter and upping the salt to a full tsp would make it much better. Also, I had to add milk to make this a viable dough.

I have searched and searched for a great biscuit recipe and have tried several. I am so excited about this one. It is so easy and delicious. I took the suggestion of the other reviewer and just scooped the dough and placed it on a greased cookie sheet. I brushed them with butter when they came out of the oven. They were so moist and delicious. I have yet to try them by kneading, and I know they will turn out great. I am so excited to have this recipe!!

Great base recipe.  Made it with butter and baked at 425 for 10 mins.  I grated the cold butter on a box grater (much quicker than trying to cut it in) and the dough was quite stiff before kneading.  I used it for breakfast with egg and sausage.  Will try different versions like cheddar, raisins etc.

Substituted whole wheat flour and it worked beautifully -- but don't expect them to rise as high. I ended up with a great little, substantive, old-timey biscuit, and one that thankfully wasn't sweet and wimpy or corporate-tasting. The results were nicely balanced in terms of taste-tonalities, possessed a great mouth-feel, and they very much pleased my little band of health nuts.

I believe this is the first time I ever made biscuits!  A warning to anyone else with limited biscuit experience - the "dough" is very sticky prior to the kneeding step.  So use a lot of flour on your hands and the surface you plop your dough onto.  I am assuming the sticky-dough-aspect is normal for biscuits because they turned out great.  I used half white flour and half wheat flour.  Half butter flavored shortening and half real butter.  Substituted garlic salt for the salt.  Used my heart-shaped cookie cutter for an extra "cute".  Baked in 400 degrees on my airbake cookie sheet for 20 minutes.   

Next time I am going to add a little cheddar cheese to the mix!  Overall great recipe to get me started!

My biscuits turned out undercooked, but I might have made them bigger than the normal biscuit. Overall, the biscuit was okay. It wasn't anything like Bisquick's biscuits, and far from Pillsbury, but when you have neither, this recipe will stop a craving.

super easy and delicious!  I didn't roll it thick enough the first time, so i folded over the dough to get it to the right thickness--and when they bake, they're perfect.  Not to mention that since I folded it in half, it was like they were perfectly sliced in the middle.  I've made this 3x since then, and I always fold the dough over now :)

Light, fluffy, yummy!  I followed the recipe except I used half butter and half shortening.  Yummy!  I quick froze half on a cookie sheet and then put into a freezer bag to bake a couple at a time later.

Love this! Used butter instead, but otherwise followed per directions. Baked for 10 mins at 400 degrees. Bottom was slightly browned more than I like, but top wasn't as golden as I liked. So think I will lower temp and bake longer next time. Thank you!

Just made them. They turned out nice, but still needed something (like some of the other reviews said). I added some butter to the tops after they baked.

These are good as drop biscuits and PERFECTION when kneaded and cut out. I use 1/2 margarine, half butter. Less sugar, more salt, and a little dried rosemary. Yummy!!!

These were fantastic!  I used butter flavored shortening and garlic salt in place of the regular.  I didn't have a biscuit cutter so I just used a cookie cutter.  Worked out well!  My husband who is a total biscuit fanatic loved them!  I would have like them a bit softer, but still great.

Great biscuit recipe.....brushed the tops with egg whites just before baking to give them a nice brown glossy finish. Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out wonderful.

First time making biscuits and I am so impressed with this recipe. Used half shortening half butter. I made it all in my food processor, but didn't over mix. Pulsed the flour shortening butter mixture and slowly poured in milk egg mixture until it came together. Don't double this recipe, it doesn't work! One of those times when doubling just does not work.

OMG, the best biscuits I've ever had.  I HATE baking but we ate all of our thanksgiving biscuits before thanksgiving so I asked my 10 year old son if he'd bake biscuits because he LOVES to bake.  We didnt have shortening so ended up using lard and these turned out to be the BEST ever!!!  My son will be making these again tomorrow to take to his grandparents since they will be celebrating Thanksgiving tomorrow.

wonderful!  I made these to go along with a crock pot chicken pot pie recipe I have, and they were perfect as the "crust" on the side...yumm!  I've made them twice and both times they turned out perfectly.  I skipped the rolling and cutting, and simply just made drop biscuits.  Easy!  I used a food processor and cut in REALLY cold butter, I think that might be the trick.

These were the best homemade biscuits I have ever made!!!!  My husband agreed and loved them.  The only thing I did different was I increased the sugar to 1/4 cup and the salt to 1 tsp.  Other than that everything else was done according to the recipe.  To the people that complained about the dough being too sticky, it's because you HAVE to knead it at least 15 -20 times on a very well floured surface.  These were perfect and I can't wait to make them again and brush with honey butter as soon as they come out of the oven.  Definitely a keeper!!!! Thank you so much for sharing!!!

I did modify this recipe.  My family doesn't eat anything with hydrogenated oils, so I replaced the shortening with butter.  I also replaced the milk with buttermilk.    There is a trick to using butter with biscuits that doesn't just apply to this recipe....  If you switch to butter, you must soft freeze the butter by tossing it in the freezer for 20 mins or so.  If it melts while you are kneading it, the biscuits will just be greasy and not flaky at all.  I threw all of the ingredients into the food processor with the cutting blade, and pulsed it until it formed a rough ball, about 45 seconds to one minute.  Then rolled out out *quickly* folding it over about 4 times, and then cut with minimal handling.  The more you handle it, the more the butter will melt.  If you don't have a food processor, you can grate the frozen butter and then knead it in by hand.  If you do this method, you have to make sure your milk and egg are COLD and you must work quickly.  Brushing the tops with melted butter before baking will give a really nice golden top also.  Best biscuit recipe I've ever had.  And I think I have tried almost every one out there.

These are (in my opinion) just okay. They are incredibly fluffy and soft, but a little on the dry side. I'll make these again and tweak the recipe as I go.

Really good biscuits! I divided the recipe in half (makes 6 biscuits) and made these for breakfast this morning. I didn't change anything about the recipe except I didn't have any milk, so I used a 1/2 water and 1/2 condensed milk combination to substitute.  They turned out wonderfully! My husband (who hates biscuits) gave them 5 stars (with jelly)! I will definitely make these again! Thanks!

The addition of the egg gave these biscuits a nice flavor and texture over regular baking powder bicuits.  I am going to use them in my crockpot chicken and dumplings.

This is one I have on my fridge and use all the time.  However, I've tweaked it a little over the years.  I only use 3tsp baking powder so the biscuits aren't so dry.  I always use butter instead of shortening though so that's probably why I had to tweak.  I also do a full TBSP of sugar.  These are great and easy, perfect for sausage gravy or as their own side with roast beef or chicken noodle soup... thank you!

These are the BEST biscuits I've ever made!  They melt in your mouth!  Instead of all shortening, I used 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup cold butter.  Then, as suggested by another user, I kneaded about 5 times, lightly patted out flat, and folded over 4 times to make layers. I really think this made all the difference in producing very light and fluffy biscuits.  My husband raved about them, too, and told me to use this recipe for our biscuits in the future!  THANKS SO MUCH FOR POSTING THIS ONE!!!

I didn't feel like these were even as good as self-rising flour, buttermilk & shortening biscuits, certainly not better

FOOL PROOF!  I ruin every batch of biscuits I bake. . . and this one, so delicious on the first try!!!  I made this recipe just like it was written.  My shortening was butter flavored and I did smear room temp butter (real butter) on top before baking.  But the recipe, including the kneading 20 times was GREAT once out of the oven!

This recipe can make the best piggies in a blankie I have ever had. All I did was roll out rectangles big enough for those brown and serve sausages and rolled them up and baked them. Theycame out so tender and yummy.

These are delicious and easy biscuits! Following reviews, I use half butter flavored shorting and half butter and after kneading I scoop them out using an ice cream scooper or spoon instead of rolling and cutting. They turn out great and I won't be using any other recipe from now on.

Quick and easy to make had them ready by the time the oven was pre-heated. I made this recipe along side some Bisquick biscuits, and I liked this recipe better.

I've made these twice now, and they are fantastic! I used half butter (cold) and half shortening otherwise they would have been a little bland. Wouldn't have changed it at all if I had butter flavored shortening in the cupboard. Very good recipie!

I am new in in cooking all-american breakfasts, lunches and dinners. These biscuits were a HIT!!! I was told that they taste like real granny made biscuits. Very fluffy! I didn't have shortening so I replaced it with butter.

WHO SAID "YOU CAN'T TEACH AN OLD DOG NEW TRICKS". I'M EIGHTY YEARS OLD AND I PICKED UP A FEW HINTS FROM REVIEWS, USING MY FOOD PROCESSOR TO MIX THE DOUGH AND USING A ICE CREAM SCOOP TO DROP THE BICUITS. I DID CUT THE RECIPE IN HALF BECAUSE I LIVE ALONE.ONLY  PROBLEM WAS HALVING THE EGG! THIS IS MY GO TO RECIPE FOR BISCUITS FROM NOW ON. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR A GREAT RECIPE.

WOW indeed.  Amazing.  I highly recommend these; very easy and absolutely delicious.  I tried some fellow reviewer modifications with great results: buttermilk instead of milk, 1 tsp salt instead of 1/2, and an ice cream scoop of dough onto greased baking sheets (I hate rolling dough so this was a lot easier for me).  Delicious!  I'll probably be dreaming about these for quite some time...

If using all shortening double the salt. I also added 1tsp vinegar-(to make it taste like buttermilk) I doubled the recipie and cut out 1 and 3/4 in thick buistcuits. This made 12-15 grands style biscuits. Also knead this as little as possible-4 times was enough for me.

This is a fine, TESTED recipe! I love it. Thank you for sharing it, Nancy. I used butter flavored shortening- to all the folks using real butter, I'd suggest clarified butter. Introducing the salty milk in unclarified butter changes the results.

Very good! I have a hard time finding a good biscuit recipe when using "non-aluminum" baking powder. Usually not very fluffy.  But this recipe is perfect. They turned out light, fluffy and very tasty. Hubby even said they were the best I have made after switching baking powders.  And also easy.

I made this with 1/2 cup coconut oil.  Also Very Good!!!

Does anyone realize how inexpensive these are to make and how actually quick they can be made, holy cow with this economy, nothing against Pillsbury but they can be used for some budget help!  Won't make them too often due to watching the fat in our diet, but thanks for a great recipe!!!!

I am not very good with biscuits and have tried several recipes, but this one is great!  I was a little surprised at how sticky they were during the kneading process.  Thanks for the details and providin the recipe!

This is the biscuit recipe that I have been looking for!  They are so good and so fluffy!  My boyfriend like buscuits and gravy but compains that I always make 'little discs' not biscuits.  Well, this is it!  These are PERFECT for biscuits and gravy!  I used all shortening (Crisco), lowered the sugar to about 2 tsp and upped the salt to 1 tsp.  I tried one with jam and it was great that  way too!  This will be my biscuit recipe from now on!

These were fabulous biscuits.  My husband thought they were store bought because I have always had a hard time making really good biscuits.  I did use cold butter instead of shortening, but kept the rest exactly the same.  I will be making these again...probably this week!

YUM. Love these biscuits. I used all butter, no shortening. I thought the flavor from using all butter was Fantastic. (who keeps shortening on hand these days?) I enjoyed the texture of these biscuits, I thought they came out great. I did knead the second batch I made, and they rose VERY high. When using all butter, I found the dough to be very sticky, so I just added a little extra flour and it came out perfect. Alternatively you could just use a little less milk. This is the best biscuit recipe I have found yet!

**edit to add: I have been trying to count my calories to help lose weight. FYI, these have 161 calories per biscuit when using butter, more when using shortening. I used the caloriecount recipe analysis.

These were good!  I used 1 t. salt, 1/4 c. shortening, 1/4 c. COLD butter diced in small cubes.  The dough is sticky - resist the urge to handle it roughly or too much.  (Flour your board and have some extra flour on hand.)  Lightly kneaded about 20 times, rolled to 3/4" thick and then cut with a floured water glass into 4 rounds, gathered the remaining dough together and shaped into a rounds.  (I didn't re-roll.)  The last two didn't look the same, but they tasted the same!  They rose to about 2 inches after baking 8 minutes - golden on top and bottom.  I posted a pic.

I could hug you!!  Thank You! :)  As a southern woman it's been my personal embarrassment that I've never been able to make bicuits to save my life.  Now I find this recipe and can say I've just made the first biscuits ever that are worthy of eating!  I want to add that I brushed the tops with a mix of melted butter and honey toward the end of cooking and they are scrumptious! Thank you again!

These were good, and easy to work with.  I made it exactly as written and think next time I'll try using 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening.  All in all this was a great biscuit for my sausage gravy.

I had no luck with this recipe. I followed the recipe to the tee & they ended up sticky. I had to add more flour in order to roll them out. Then they didn't rise at all & I ended up with flat biscuits. Don't know what happened!!!!

woohoo I finally found a biscuit recipe that turns out!!!   I made these tonight and added some cheddar cheese.  They turned out perfect. I only kneaded them for about 5-6 times as others suggested.   Will be making them again very soon.

My family and I love these biscuits.  I used buttermilk instead and found the taste was even better.  I also lightly greased my baking pan with melted butter before putting the biscuits in the pan then brushed the biscuits with melted butter.  Absolutely awesome!  I've also brushed the biscuits with melted butter just after removing them from the oven.  Of all the biscuits I've ever made, this is the one my family begs for over and over again!  My daughter entered these for her 4-H baking project this year and, while it only won a blue ribbon, they were the biggest, fluffiest biscuits of all the entries.  The judge could not stop nibbling on them and people were amazed at how big, fluffy and tasty they really were.  Some biscuits that rise this high can be very dry but not these!  If you're looking for the perfect biscuit recipe, you just found it!  Thanks Nancy!

This is the best biscuit recipe I have found to date.  I did change the shortening to butter because as a VERY busy mother of 4, using a stick of butter rather than scooping out shortening was much easier and tasted SOOOO good! I used to make store bought ones all the time, and now my kids won't let me since we've had these.  They are so quick, easy, and yummy!  From all 6 of us, it gets 12 thumbs up!

I have never been able to make decent biscuits.  Well that has all changed now with this recipe.  I made it with butter instead of shortening and I only used 1- 1/2 teaspoons of sugar.  They turned out great.  My husband thought they were a bit too crumbly so next time I make them I am going to use butter and shortening.  I won't be buying biscuits any more.  Thanks for sharing this recipe

Hmm.. These were just okay. I guess I fall into the group of people who thought that these were a bit bland. They were very beautiful, but just didn't taste like much. I only kneaded these about 5-6 times, not 20, that would have been way too many. That is why some peoples have come out so dense. I also used 1/4 butter 1/4 shortening. This wasn't a big enough kick for flavor. These need some salt for sure. I ended up having to brush the tops of these with lots and lots of butter to make up for the flavor. It's too bad, because I made these to show an English friend what "real American biscuits" are, and I sort of feel like I should have just bought some Grands.

Just what I have been looking for - these were much better than another baking soda recipe I tried. Based on a reviewer's suggestion, I used one 1/4 cup shortening and one 1/4 cup butter. And to make it easier, I just kneaded the dough in the bowl and then used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to scoop it out and place on the cookie sheet. This made less 'perfectly-formed' biscuits, but if you don't care about perfect uniformity, then this is an easier (and cleaner!) way than rolling them out. Lastly, I used buttermilk instead of milk, and brushed buttermilk on the tops before putting them in the oven. I served them with chili con carne, and they were perfect!

Best biscuit recipe I've found.  I've basically been spending all this time perfecting  and modifying my family's recipes. Why bother when I can come to all recipes and get your all-ready perfected ones.  My fiance loves them warm with jam :)  I usually make them mini - about 1 1/" diameter.

I thought these were great, considering how easy they are to whip up.  I used half cold butter and half shortening, like one reviewer suggested and made sure I had plenty of clumps in the dough for flakiness.  I patted my dough out to about one inch in thickness (instead of rolling) and used a 3" diameter glass to cut out six huge biscuit.  I cooked them for two minutes longer because of their size.  I'll definitely make these again whenever I need a biscuit recipe that doesn't require ingredients I don't normally have on hand.

Wonderful!!!  I have been looking for a good biscuit recipe for a long time and I finally found it!  After reading previous reviews I used 1/4 of a cup of shortening and 1/4 of a cup of butter.  The biscuits came out light and fluffy, the best I've ever made.  The search is over.  I will make this recipe for many years to come.

I have made this recipe multiple times and absolutely love these biscuits! I have always used margarine instead of shortening, and I added another teaspoon of sugar to make them a tad bit sweeter. I do not used the entire milk and egg mixture, just enough to make them moist enough to roll out. The end result is very yummy and a great addition to any dinner!

I really like this recipe for biscuits and gravy, but my husband says the flavor is just to "eh" to eat plain with jelly or something.  So I guess whether to use this recipe depends on how your serving it - for use in a biscuit breakfast sandwich or covered in sausage gravy, these biscuits are great to me.  I also appreciate that they are easy to make and rise up nicely.  Following this recipe, I use a red wine glass to cut the biscuits and try to get no more than 10 biscuits out of the batch to make sure they are thick enough to achieve a nice height.  I also brush the tops with melted butter before popping them in the oven.

I just made these tonight to go with chicken noodle stew. They had the right flaky texture I was looking for but I found them a little bland on taste. I used all shortening per the recipe but I think, after reading the reviews, I will try the half butter, half shortening approach to add flavor. I also rolled mine out thicker ( a little over an inch) for the taller biscuit I was looking for. I made a double batch so I could try freezing the cut biscuits before baking like you get from the freezer section.  I think these would also be good with garlic and cheddar cheese added and made as drop biscuits.

I just made these for breakfast and my kids and fiance' gobbled them up and declared them the best biscuits they've ever had. Next time I'll try using buttermilk for a variation. Also, instead of rolling them out I simply did what my mom did when she made biscuits: use vegetable oil spray to coat 12 muffin cups well and scoop the batter evenly between them all. I baked them for about 11 minutes and they slid right out of the cups, nice and fluffy. Thanks for an easy, quick and delicious recipe!

I made these biscuits this morning, and my family agrees that this is out new favorite biscuit recipe!  Because we prefer buttermilk biscuits, I substituted buttermilk for the regular milk and added 1/4 tsp baking soda.  I served them warm with a little bit of honey.  Wonderful!

I am giving this 4 stars because I think it is probably me.  I have tried every biscuit recipe in the world, but I just can't seem to make the light-fluffy kind my ex-Mother-in-law used to make.  I thought I followed the recipe exactly, but as is always my experience, they came out of the oven not much taller than they were when I put them in.  They did taste wonderful though - we had them with stew.  I'll try them again sometime....

Did it this morning for breakfast, and took the suggestion of half butter half shortening, and they were awesome!  I didn't want to roll them out, so I just dropped them on a cookie sheet.  They are also really yummy with a glaze of melted butter and brown sugar after they come out!

So amazingly fluffy!! These biscuits were a hit at my house put they are only good with lots of jelly because they are plain. Don't get me wrong- these are still fabulous! One tip though: don't use all of teh egg/butter mixure for the dough, use some to coat the top of the biscuits before putting them in the oven. This way they will have a golden-brown finish.

I tried this recipe "as is" with the shortening, and I found that it was a little too crumbly and plain for our taste.  Then I tried it again using butter in place of the shortening as other cooks had suggested, and it was perfect.  It cooks very light and fluffy.  My family says it is the best biscuit recipe I have ever prepared.

The first time I made these I followed the advice of others and added more milk (total of 1 cup). Well, it was too sticky for me to handle so I had to add more flour and I ended up doing drop biscuits instead. They turned out great! So, the second time I wanted to try it without changes. They tasted good but were not as fluffy.

Who knew biscuits could be so easy?  I followed the other suggestions and used butter instead of shortening.  I take a stick of butter and run it through a cheese grater and that makes it easier to cut the butter into the flour mixture.  We used this for biscuits and gravy.  Thanks.  Now I dont have to buy Grands biscuits anymore.

This is my new favorite plain biscuit recipe! (Plain meaning without cheese, garlic, rosemary, maple syrup, etc. NOT plain taste :) )They were so flaky and soft. Not only did they taste delicious, but they were beautiful and golden. My family loved them- they were a great way to spruce up leftover lentil soup. I am without a doubt making these again!

I have finally hit upon the holy grail of biscuit recipes. This is THE one. I increased the milk to 1 cup, barely mixed the dough in the bowl and gently kneaded it on a well-floured surface. I skipped the rolling and patted it into place. These biscuits are totally fluffy and have a very good flavor!

These biscuits are the best. They are super easy to throw together, and have great taste and texture. I used margarine only because I didn't have shortening and they still turned out perfect. Thanks for a great recipe.

My mom made delicious biscuits when i was growing up. They didn't have a bitter baking powder taste that so many others do. She lost the recipe and we've never found any we like including the premade frozen ones. She used to roll them out and stack them one on top of the other and they were nice and high. This recipe is the next best thing, a slight baking powder taste but not bad especially after buttering them. These are great! Nice and flaky inside and they rose high. I used the decrease feature on this site to try them first and made 6, came out good. I used buttered flavored crisco for the shortening. Every time i make homemade stew i want biscuits and today i was lucky to find this recipe.

I've been trying a lot of biscuit recipes to find one that's fluffy, tasty, and raises pretty high.  Finally found one!  These biscuits turned out awesome.  Would have submitted a picture if there wasn't one.  I substituted buttermilk for milk as I was trying to use it up.  Am going to stop my recipe search as of today.  Highly recommend it.  It's the first recipe I've seen that uses an egg - maybe that was the missing ingredient.

I made these tonight for my family, and they were DEVOURED!  Topped with honey-butter (soften- do not melt- a stick of butter in the microwave, whisk in honey; it will be a pudding-y consistency), they were addictive.  I served this with Maryland crab cakes, wild rice, parmesan asparagus, and sauteed red beans.  A fabulous meal!

Anything that you need to knead and roll is kinda messy, but these were pretty easy. They tasted great even though I used a stick of light butter instead of shortening. Also used a glass to make the biscuits since I didn't have a biscuit cutter. Went great with a bacon, egg and potato skillet.

These are so yummy.  I gave it 5 stars because not only are these biscuits delicious, they are so quick and easy to put together.  I only made one small change and that was to use buttermilk instead of milk (to use up what we had on hand).  Very good - we will definitely make again.

The biscuits  were hit but for me maybe a little more trouble than for others. I'm not very good with pie dough either. The dough is very sticky, Make sure you have everything out that you need before handling the dough.
I used a cleaned empty refried beans can to cut the dough and they were perfect size, But only got 9. I didn't roll the dough out but just flattened it out with my hands to about 1 inch and cut it.
They could have baked more than the 12 minuets that I timed them for but they were done enough. Another 2 min would have browned them up.

Super easy recipe to make and with simple ingredients. Turned out awesome! This recipe is definitely a keeper. I followed someone else's instruction and substituted salted butter for the shortening and they were really light and flaky, slight crispness to the outside but the inside was so moist and soft. I'll probably try using all shortening next time to see how much of a difference it makes. I've never made a good biscuit...until now. All of my attempts at biscuits have turned out as hockey pucks or floury tasting, but that's no longer the case after finding this recipe.

I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and did half cold butter and half shortening.  I made drop biscuits instead of rolling them out (the batter was far too moist), and they turned out deliciously!

This the best recipe I have ever used. The less you knead the dough, the better. Try using butter instead of shortening for a great taste also.

I was in the mood to try fresh made biscuits and gravy. I came across this recipe with a high rating.... First off I sifted my dry Ingredients togather as I usually do when baking. I then followed the recipe to a T only thing I did different was use butter flavored Crisco for more flavor. I brushed butter on the top of them when they came out of the oven. Biscuits did not rise very much... They were dense, and all I could taste was flour. Batch size is not mentioned, but I was able to get 6 biscuits out of the batch I made. I will keep looking for a good recipe.

i've been using a tried and true buttermilk biscuit recipe for years and had never found one that came even close.  I can't remember the last time I made that recipe since discovering this one!

Quick tip; while it's unusual to knead a biscuit, don't be afraid, they are spectular EXACTLY as written / instructed.  Enjoy

I substituted butter for shortening, ommitted the egg (I was out of eggs!!!!), and used 1 cup of buttermilk to compensate for the liquid loss with the egg. WOW! Best recipe I have ever used for biscuits.... even though I had to tweak it due to what was in the fridge. These were incredible. Proportions of wet/dry here are spot on. Enjoy!

This is my go-to recipe. i like to add a little more salt and a little less sugar, but the recipe is great as-is.

Amazing. It took me years to learn how to make biscuits and not hockey pucks.  I tried this recipe ans OMG.  Light, fluffy, moist and so good with butter fresh out of the oven.  I did omit the sugar because I don't like it in biscuits but amazing recipe.  Definitely a staple!

Delicious! Used cold butter instead of shortening. I didn't have the tool most use for "cutting in" so I chopped up a stick of frozen butter very finely and mixed it into the dry ingredients. Very easy, flaky, fast! My family loved them!
I also used the ball and press method, not the rolling and cutting method for forming the dough into biscuits. It gives them character.

Great recipe - very consistent and great texture. Also works well if you substitute butter for the shortening. I make a double batch, roll them out and cut into squares. Freeze them and they make a great quick breakfast sandwich with a fried egg. I just place a few in my convection toaster oven, let them thaw as it preheats and then bake for 12-13 minutes at 400F.

The biscuits turned out excellent! I used unsalted butter and added a little more salt.  I doubled the recipe and had no trouble handling the dough.  I baked them longer than the time called for but I do that on almost all baked recipes or they don't turn out well.  That could just be my altitude and oven.

I used real butter instead of shortening. They were devoured in minutes. I will definitely make again, I can't believe how easy they were to throw together.

Fantastic and so easy.   I typically make this with a 50-50 mix of butter and shortening, and I use buttermilk if I have it on hand.   These modifications are my preference, but the biscuits are also fantastic when made per the recipe.

Hi all, I gave this one a try and it was very good. I had to cook it longer then 10 minutes. I didn't knead 20 times only about 5 the more you knead the more dense it will be. I used butter flavored Crisco. Give this one a try.

Delicious and nicely textured biscuit.  I substituted powdered buttermilk. Had no shortening and used all butter on a hot, humid day so they didn't rise very high.

I always double this recipe and freeze 3/4 of them once cooked. Then I can easily reheat 1-2 as needed in the microwave. This method taste better and cost less compared to the store bought dough. I also use half butter and half shortening, and simply roll them by hand onto the cookie sheets.

I must admit that I changed the recipe a bit.  We were looking for a sweet biscuit for breakfast.  We added 2 tsp. cinnamon and a glaze to these biscuits.  They were delicious!  I will definitely make them as written as they were more moist than most biscuits.  They were not too dry and had a nice texture.

For light and fluffy these are the  best so far.  The flavor was a bit plain.  Made again and doubled the recipe substituting 1 of the eggs with 1/4 cup sour cream.  Still fluffy.  Keeper.

This is almost identical to the flaky biscuit recipe, that I came up with.  Only difference is I use more buttermilk and this one calls for sugar and an egg.  So today I made mine and this 1.  Then had my 4 kids taste test them, they said mine is great for stew toppers, gravy, jelly, plain, or as a cheddar biscuit.  This version  is good for jelly, plain, served as side to fried chicken, as a cheddar biscuit or dessert biscuit.  I did up the buttermilk to equal what my other version uses to have them come out. In doing so I got 12 -1in thick pre-cooked biscuits.  With my adjustments I will be making both types of biscuit (my flaky and this fluffy) in the future.  Thanks for sharing would of never thought to add sugar and an egg to what I already knew was a great recipe. :) Although since I did change it, I can't give this recipe more then 3 stars.

Prepared as written and enjoyed a most excellent biscuit. This is a biscuit that doesn't require drinking a gallon of milk before you can physically resume normal speech. Super fast and easy. Light crispiness on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Dont worry that the dough is so loose before turning out. The flour on the kneading surface will use up the liquid quickly. Awesome with strawberry jam. Family approved.

My husband is a biscuit critic- and these passed his test!  The only change I made was 1/2 butter, 1/2 shortening.  A fluffy, tender biscuit!

These were fantastic!  My husband says make these any time.  The only thing I did different was used margerine instead of shortening and that was simply because that's what I had.  Next time I will use shortening.  I grew up with biscuits at almost every meal.  For some reason I have never mastered making them like Mom.  These weren't like Mom's, they were better!  Just don't tell her I said so!

I made these last night, my first time making biscuits that didn't start with Bisquick, and I was happy that this was so easy.  I used butter flavor Crisco, which gave a nice rich flavor, and faux buttermilk (milk with a tablespoon of vinegar) because my hubby said that biscuits should be made with buttermilk.  My family loved these, and I will definitely make them again.

this is the recipe I have been looking for. I think I might add just a dash more salt next time, and maybe cut sugar by 1/4, but other than that, lovely, fluffy, tender and delicious.

This was my first time making biscuits from scratch, and these turned out delicious! I used unsalted butter since I didn't have shortening on hand. Next time I will either increase the salt a bit or use salted butter, but the texture was even better than a mix!

Oh Wow, I didn't have all purpose flour or shortening.
So I used self-rising and stick margarine. Looked at other recipe reviews. Rolled out thinner and doubled dough before cutting out biscuits.  The results were so-o-o-o good. The absolute best biscuits I have ever made.  Thanks so much.

I just made this for me and my girlfriend, we are big fans of this recipe.  First thing to note, I did alter the recipe as one reviewer suggested by putting 1/4 cup shortening, and 1/4 cup butter.  The biscuits came out very fluffy and taste great with butter and maple syrup!  **Warning** Do not over bake.  These will burn quickly.  Our biscuits did not brown much, so we left it in there for 10 min. and half of them burned on the bottom.  So I would suggest taking them out at the 8 minute mark and making sure they are not burned.

I thought this was a very good and easy recipe, but I should have looked at the reviews first.  Next time I'll use butter instead of shortening and buttermilk instead of milk.  The biscuits I made had a good flavor, but tasted a little doughy.  I probably should have mixed the batter a little more.

These were AMAZING!  I did use butter (but I still give it a 5 star rating because I am sure the shortening would be rocking good too).  These are the first biscuits I have ever made that actually had flakey layers and a good flavor!  They were simple to make and tasted great with a variety of toppings...we did sausage with mustard and honey, honey and butter, jelly and butter and strawberries and whipped cream!  I also used these along with a sauage gravy recipe!  So good.  They are terrific all on their own as well.  This is my go to recipe, I will never buy prefrozen biscuits or refrigerator biscuits as long as I live!

I used butter instead of shortening.  Came out perfect.  If you can taste the baking powder, try using an aluminum free variety.

Am I the only person who could taste the baking powder? I made 3 different batches just to be sure it was not a mistake on my part and all 3 taste the same...terrible. Will rework it and try again.

I tried making these biscuits for myself and my husband last night, and let me tell you, they are so simple and they are BOMB. These taste amazing, especially brushed with butter.

These were my last attempt at biscuits. Suprise they are soo good. They are light,flakey, and taste like the biscuit I was looking for. I did substitute butter flavored shortening for reg. shortening. This recipe is going into the vault. Thanks so much!

I was looking for a simple biscuit to complement homemade turkey soup (more ideas for the leftover frozen turkey from Thanksgiving) and I found this recipe. It was so simple and the biscuits were exquisite. I used what I had at home (almond milk instead of cows milk and butter instead of shortening). I also added garlic powder and cheddar cheese to the dough. Fantastic! Did I mention it was my first time making biscuits? :-) Thanks for the great recipe. I will make this again and experiment further.

Made these for dinner tonight. They came out of the oven just like they went in- didn't rise at all. I even used a new container of baking powder. Don't know what happened.

I love this recipe! I did try using butter today and buttermilk. It's extra moist when you do this so the key is to put a lot of flower down when you kneed it. It's so much better with butter milk and real butter. I always use this recipe and I'm just now rating it:) Thanks for sharing this is always a hit in my house.

This recipe deserves more than 5 stars.  They were the best biscuits I've ever made.  I used real butter (salted) in place of the shortening and replaced the sugar with the same amount of maple syrup, using just a little less milk because of the liquid in the syrup.  My family loved them.

These will do in a pinch I guess... Mine did not rise that much and just had a "flour" taste to them. I even put in an extra teaspoon of sugar?  But, served warm enough butter and jelly will do the trick  :)

These were the best biscuits I have ever made. I did use very cold butter instead of shortening and added, 1.5 cups shredded chedder, 0.25 cups shredded parm, 1 cup cooked and crumbled bacon, 0.25 teaspoon celery salt, and 0.25 teaspoon pepper. They were gone before they even cooled. Now I am being begged to make a chocolate chip batch. Excellent recipe to build on.

I followed the recipe exactly, doubling it for my large family.  Using white, whole wheat flour made these biscuits slightly more healthy. But they were so yummy, that we ate too many.  Will definitely bake them again!

This makes a great biscuit. Like the 'tube' kind, only no preservative flavor. I've tried others, turned out quite dense, these are great.

These were great!  I used these to make Chicken and Biscuits.  I rolled the dough and cut out 12 mini biscuits.  Then, I used the remaining dough to make cinnamon rolls.  I rolled out the extra dough, slathered with melted butter, sprinkled on cinnamon/sugar mixture, rolled, cut with dental floss, and baked in a muffin pan along with the biscuits.  SOOO GOOD!

These biscuits were yummy but the dough was so sticky I couldn't roll out so I just dropped them on the cookie sheet. So not as pretty as the pictures but still very good.

While mixing in the shortening I realized these were missing a key flavor...butter!  I cut back slightly on the milk and added a tsp of butter flavoring...fantastic!  I also used whole wheat flour.  Big hit with the whole family.  Will be using this recipe again.

These were amazing!  Helpful hints:  
I did as others suggested and used half butter and half shortening.  The flavor was great.
I put all of the dry ingredients in the food processor and pulsed for a few seconds to blend in the butter and shortening.  I added the milk and egg until just combined.  I rolled between wax paper because the dough was sticky.  It was a little messy, but easy to remove from the wax paper.  Adding too much flour will make biscuits come out too dry.... great, simple recipe!

I made a double batch and substituted the crisco for all butter, it barely had flavor. And the dough was so sticky that no matter how much flour I put down it kept sticking to the counter. That's another thing- the flour taste is overpowering and the biscuits came out quite dry. I tried to stack 2 circles of dough and pinch the sides together in hope that they'd bake together and be much more fluffy. No luck- instead they baked as 2 complete biscuits with 1 side of each not being done at all. Many of them came out like small, hard hockey pucks. With the last remaining circles I had completely redone and squished into large balls of dough. They did come out higher and fluffier but still a strong flour taste. USE HONEY AND BUTTER OR JELLY/JAM to top them. Then atleast you get some flavor. I had to cook each tray full for 12mins and I give this recipe 2 stars for lack of expectations.

I whipped these up in the food processor (added an extra cup of flour to get the right consistency)  Used and ice-cream scooper to make mounded rounds and flattened them with my hand on the cookie sheet.  Too easy.  And the family inhaled them.

Awesome!  I took the suggestion of using 1/2 butter (1/4 cup) and 1/2 Shortening (1/4 cup). I also kneaded the dough 20 times.  I didn't roll it I just patted it to 1 inch thickness.  The biscuits were tall and were wonderfully fluffy.  Definately my go to recipe for muffins.

I love them but I can't perfect the rising part.  I've made them twice and that won't rise like in the photo.  Will keep trying however.

These are a great basic biscuit. My 6 year old said if she could she'd give 'em 10 stars. I served them warm with butter to accompany my homemade chicken noodle & veggie soup.

Pre expectations: from reading reviews, and judging from the recipe, I have decided that these biscuits will be simple to bake and tasty to snarf. So i'l give it four stars for now.

Very good!  The moment they come out of the oven and even two days later!  They fluff up awesome, look professional.  Could use more salt, or baking soda.




















hey come out of the oven, and two days later!  I think this recipe could use more salt or baking soda... not sure what it is.

Love this recipe.  I have never been able to make good biscuits until now.  Only change I made was adding just a pinch more salt, otherwise GREAT BISCUITS and my family loved them.

The biscuits are flaky but they have absolutely no taste to them using regular milk. I will have to try again using buttermilk. I also used butter flavored shortening instead of butter.

I used half shortening, half butter and although this is a very easy recipe, I agree with some posters that it is not the greatest.  I ate mine with butter and had to add some cinnamon sugar to it for me to be content.  However, I did make these to go along with our chicken and dumplings tonight so it could be better with some "gravy" and more flavor.  They are great texture wise and very easy to make but next time I think I may use all butter instead of half shortening, half butter and maybe a little more salt.  Overall, pretty good recipe, needs some tweaking for my family but others the original could be great!

These we delicious biscuits I made three small changes I left out the sugar. I also switched the shortening for butter and I accidently forgot the egg. But these were flaky and yummy next time I think I will pat the dough out a little thinner and brush them with milk or an egg for a beautiful sheen. Thanks for the recipe definitely a keeper

These turned out WONDERFUL!  Can't wait to try some of the other  comment suggestions like doing half butter/half shortening.  But this was an excellennt recipe.  I'm always looking for a good biscuit recipe so I rarely make the same one twice, but this one might be here to stay!!!

Family loved these better than the traditional bisxuits that we make.  They are soft, tender and moist and an excellent compliment to slowcooker stew.  Will definately make them again.

I wanted to try a recipe that was simple as I have tried making biscuits before with great failure.  These were so simple and they came out perfectly.  I used butter flavored shortening to get the butter flavor into the biscuits and it worked out just delicious.

I refuse to rate low when I can't figure out what I am doing wrong. I followed the recipe exactly 2 times and the mixture was so wet I had to keep adding flour so I would be able to knead it. They were crumbly, packy, and hard on the bottom. I tried again and put less milk. mixed up great, but again, hard, packy and when I put the sausage in it and tried to eat it the biscuit broke into pieces. I use butter flavor crisco but instead of allpurpoee flour I used self-rising. That has never made a difference before. Is that my problem. I really need a good biscuit recipe. Blaming my stove is not working anymore with my family!!

i thought these were very good. :) light and fluffy and very tasty. I didn't knead the dough like the recipe calls for because biscuits should not be over mixed. other than that i followed the recipe exactly and will never buy biscuits again :)  for a little extra something we occasionally like to add in about a half cup or so of shredded cheddar cheese to the dry ingredients before mixing. Yum!

These are my standard biscuits now. Sometimes use buttermilk instead of milk for extra 'fluff' and flavor.

These are good basic biscuits, easy to make.  The recipe only made 6 biscuits when rolled to 1.5 inches.  My husband said to replace my drop biscuit recipe with this one.

I tried making with half butter/half shortening for more flavor.  Probably could have kneaded it more than I did as the biscuits were incredibly soft and flaky, almost delicate.  The dough was very wet and had to use quite a bit of flour to handle.

Really great recipe.  I've played around with so many biscuit recipes and found this one really good.  I used half shortening and 1/2 butter.  I found the sugar content a bit high so next time I will reduce that by a tsp and add a little more salt for flavor.

Really tasty, gone in minutes flat. I substituted 2/3 cup corn meal for that much of the flour and added about 1/2 cup finely grated cheese to the dry ingredients. So good with chili!

These were super simple. I used butter instead of shortening, and used 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour. I accidentally made them about 1/4 inch thick and they were really cute and good.

Mine came out great! However, I used butter. Always. It's easy to screw up, though…as all biscuits are. The trick is to not over-knead it.

Very yummy biscuits. They rise beautifully every time, are fluffy on the inside, and crisp on the outside. The recipe as it's written comes out amazingly, but I make mine with 1/2 unsalted butter, 1/2 shortening to give them a bit more flavor.

Hi, I'm Alex Ray from Long Island, NY.  I am originally from Atlanta, GA and have been looking for a biscuit recipe for YEARS that would even come close to my grandmothers...This is the BEST one that I've come across by far!

Light and fluffy, great texture, but no flavor. I used butter flavored Crisco, which I thought would be better, but I'll be the one eating the left overs, as no one was too impressed. The biscuits sure LOOK great! Not sure why there's sugar in them. Think I'll try a few other recipes on the site.

Maybe it's because I live in the tropics where it's really humid and it was a rainy day when I tried out this recipe, but my dough turned out extremely sticky! I had to add another 3/4 cup of flour to make it come together. 

Despite the mini crisis, these biscuits baked up nice and fluffy and got the thumbs up from the hubs. Oh...and I didn't have shortening on hand so I used all butter and added some parmesan for flavor. Went great with a chicken pot pie-style stew.

thank you for this.  i don't really like biscuits, and i suck at making them.  the few times i made them from scratch they came out like hockey pucks.  but trying to aviold the chemicals in the mixes and premade dough, i tried this.  they came out pretty good.  everyone really likes them.  i used some suggestions on here - subbed butter for shortening and kneaded the dough only a little.  the biscuits lovers in the house are happy.

As suggested I used half shortening and half butter. I only kused 1/2 t of salt, will probably add a bit more next time.  The dough was really wet so I kneaded in a quite a bit of flour but they were still light and rose really well.

OMG-osh!! These are absolutly the best from scratch biscuits I have ever had. You've gotta give them a try. I didn't change a thing about the recipe. I used butter flavor crisco. I did take the dough that was left after cutting out my biscuits and made a small batch of cinnamon rolls. YUMMY! Oh, and because my grandson and I are snowed in, we used a snowman cookie cutter. Fun. This will be the recipe I use from now on.

These are the best biscuits! Taste great made with butter flavored crisco and cut with cookie cutters for the season. I use whole wheat flour and brown sugar.

Excellent recipe and very simple.  Make sure there is plenty of flour on the rolling surface and your hands so that the dough doesn't stick.

I made these twice.  And just from my "tastebuds" they tasted too much like flour and didn't raise much more than a can biscuit.  You're on the right track :) Thank you for sharing.

These are yummy.  I, too, tried with 1/2 cold butter and 1/2 butter flavored shortening - they were fantastic.  When I made them with just the butter flavored shortening they were good but not as good.  I only use unsalted butter.  I did roll the dough out after kneading (about 10-15 times) and they were perfect.  I have a light hand when rolling so I wasn't afraid to do it that way instead of patting it out.  I cut them with small cutters and ended up with about 16 small biscuits.  THESE ARE DELICIOUS THE SECOND DAY.  They are still moist and fluffy.

I'm young and not yet a great cook. So I need easy recipes that taste like I have mastered the kitchen, especially for my significant other who loves biscuits! I follow this recipe to a tea and get soft, fluffy tasty biscuits every time! I like to pair this recipe with another recipe I found here on allrecipes: Bill's Sausage Gravy. The two paired together make a great country breakfast!

These are wonderful!!!  Definitely do 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening as suggested.  First time I've ever made biscuits from scratch, and I'll never buy biscuits again!!!

I use allrecipes quite often but just recently became a member. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or what but when I made these biscuits tonight, they did not turn out at all! My baking powder is fresh and they didn't rise very much and were very dense. Needless to say, I will look for a different recipe to use.

I loved these biscuits, perfect for what I needed them for which was to go with chili. They were not flaky p;er say, but were fluffy. I took the advice of another and replaced a little bit of the shortening with with a little bit of butter. I will make these every time I do chili or even biscuits and gravy.

Used butter flavored Crisco.  Got a little carried away on the pat down, ended up w/what appeared to be 18 sugar cookies not 12 biscuits!  They still rose to about an inch and turned out great despite what I did to them!  I did knead the 20 times and put them in the fridge for a couple hours until dinner was ready. I'll make these again, I may up the salt a tad next time, there's just a touch of something it needs, may add some honey too. All in all great biscuits and probably better when you only have 12!

These were incredible! For the shortening, I did half butter & half shortening, & they were still very flaky! Next time I will probably add a little more salt. Will definitely be making these again

The perfect biscuit! I've always had problems with biscuits- mine never rose, and were always dense and hard. These came out light, fluffy, and flaky. I'll never have to look for another biscuit recipe EVER!

These biscuits were a big hit in my home tonight.  My boys couldn't stop eating them.  They added butter and honey.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I sifted the flour.  Baked mine at 375 degrees for about 12-13 min.  in a gas oven.  It depends on the size of your biscuits.  Beautifully golden on the bottoms.  Thanks!!

These biscuits were absolutely amazing! I am allergic to dairy so I made a few changes and they turned out great! Instead using milk, I used Almond Milk and instead of using shortening, I used Best Life dairy free butter sticks. I realize I could have made it with shortening but its just so bad for you. If you have a dairy allergy I suggest using Almond milk, it works with almost everything! And any kind of dairy free butter should work!

I made 400 of these biscuits this weekend for our Ladies Christmas Tea.  They were really not all that fluffy.  I was a little disappointed in these since it had such high reviews.  They didn't taste bad at all, but they were a little more dense than I prefer.  I will keep looking for  my keeper recipe.  This is not it.

Just like grandma used to make! This recipe was delicious. I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, and I used (not) butter instead of shortening and they turned out perfect. They were a hit! Thanks for the great, easy to follow, recipe!

Best biscuit recipe I've used and will continue to use. Took other people's comments and modified the original recipe slightly by doing 1/4 c. shortening and 1/4 c. butter and upped the salt to 3/4 tsp. Also didn't knead the dough too much - maybe 10 times vs. the 20 that was called for - and I didn't roll out the dough just patted it out on my floured board to about 1" thick and cut with a drinking glass then brushed the tops with a little melted butter. Came out very flaky, nice flavor, and rose very nicely! Tasted great with the beef stew I made! Thanks!!

These are amazing!!! Just the right amount of sugar in them to keep you coming back for more. Also very good as breakfast biscuits with butter and jam on them.

Biscuits turned out great!! Light and fluffy and had a wonderful taste. My daughter rarely finishes one biscuit at dinner, but she finished two of these last night. I did add about 1/4 cup of butter to complete the 1/2 cup of shortening part of the recipe. I was really happy to find a wonderful biscuit recipe that did not call for buttermilk which I rarely ever have on hand. Thanks!

I was looking for a fluffy biscuit and got a very flaky one. While these biscuits rose pretty high and go well with butter or jam, the title does not fit the end product. If you are looking for fluffy biscuits, this might not be the recipe for you.

ok ladies this brings home the bacon... but what i found was after you mix the ingredients you get a sticky mess so i dropped the sticky mess in a scraped handful amount on a hot sheet and baked like normal and they were out of this world   the 2nd batch i kneaded by hand added flour (quite a bit) and rounded into balls, flattened them like a gordita and layered them one on top of another (2 layers) and the taste was the same but they weren't any where near as flaky and with the fabulous texture the sticky mess method produced ... wow i ate three of the first batch and then tried one from the second i couldn't help myself . ps a must is 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening for sure!!!!

I liked that these biscuits plumped up so well, but the taste of baking powder was TOO strong. If I make them again, I will half the baking powder and hope they are still fluffy. I will also roll them to 3/4 inch as suggested as they were so high they toppled when I rolled them one inch.

I made these with some bacon grease I had around and kneaded them 12 times. Maybe next time I will try 20 times as instructed, but I had never kneaded biscuits before so I was apphrehensive. They came out great! This may be my new go-to biscuit recipe- thanks for sharing!

These were great! Wanted biscuits like the flaky layers ones you buy in the store and bake at home (from the tube) but didn't want to go to the store. These were EXACTLY what I was hoping, quick and easy to make. Perfect!

My first time making biscuits and they turned out well. I followed some of the comments from other reviewers and used butter instead of shortening. As well, I kneaded minimally, maybe 4 or 5 times.

I made these biscuits today for breakfast and had a couple of problems.  I had no shortening so, after reading other reviews, I used cold butter.  The dough was very sticky and I found I had to keep adding flour so I could work with it.  The biscuits did not rise very much at all, but, the end result was still a light, tasty biscuit.  I then took the leftover dough, patted it into a 1/4 inch high rectangle and spread it with margarine.  I then sprinkled sugar and cinnamon on top, rolled it into a tube, cut it into inch and a half slices, and baked them in a 450 degree oven for about 10-12 minutes. We drizzled them with a confectioner sugar glaze, and they were fantastic!  I don't think this will be my go to recipe for biscuits, but I will definitely use it for making cinnamon swirls!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These turned out great!  I discovered we were out of bread when I went to make breakfast this morning. Luckily I found this recipe, which used things I had on hand!  I didn't have any milk but substituted rice milk and they turned out great!  I made them a bit bigger than the recipe called for, so I ended up with 9 good sized biscuits.

If these biscuits were any lighter they would have floated away!!!  Absolutely delicious, heavenly!! Never had a better tasting biscuit before!  This went perfect with my homemade split pea soup on a windy, rainy day in The Netherlands!!  And for dessert I made the Chocolate Mayo cake with cream cheese frosting!!  If that doesn't tell my husband how much I love him then I'm fresh out of ideas!!

Yummy and Super Light and Fluffy!! I did however listen to other reviews and did half Butter and half Shortening. I also had to leave out the sugar because of family health reasons.  They still tasted just great. I would say if your butter has salt don't add salt to it. All in all this is a great base recipe to play with and make your own.

Loved them! So far they are the closest I've come to Cracker Barrel biscuits. They were slightly dry and I may add a little more sugar next time but this is just personal taste. Thanks for the recipe!

I have no idea what I did wrong with these... the only thing I did differently than the recipe was to use cold butter instead of shortening and they were SO wet and sticky that I ended up adding almost 3/4 cup more flour to make them a consistency I could roll out.  They were still so sticky that they spread a little as they were baking.  I brushed them with cream before baking to help them brown and by the time they looked done, they tasted dry and crumbly.  I guess I will try a different recipe.  Maybe drop biscuits are the ones for me.

AMAZING and oh so easy!!  I used half cold butter and half shortening and replaced the milk with buttermilk and they were delicious!!  I was leery to try these because I have a tendency to mess up breads, biscuits and the like but please don't hesitate to give these a try, you may be surprised.  Thank you

These biscuits raised really nice and they look great but the taste was kind of bland and I think they needed to be baked longer than the time indicated. They looked done but they didn't taste done.



Ok, I made these again but I omitted the sugar and I used 1 1/2 teas. of salt for a single batch and the improvement was absolutely perfect for me and my family. I love using butter in the biscuits instead of shortening.

Incredible!! I followed others advice, and used half butter, half shortening. I also used buttermilk instead of reg. milk. Instead of dirtying up another dish to whisk the egg and milk together (to add to the dry mix), I just slapped it in the middle, took a fork, and mix the wet ingredients, then just sort of mix it all together! My Hubby and Kids ate them up, with soup, but this would be a wonderful addition to biscuits and gravy as well.

Very nice rise.  I added a bit more salt as they were a tad bland for me.  I also tried them with garlic, butter, and cheese mixed in - very nice!

I used unbleached flour for these and they were so yummy. Really easy and totally irresistible. One of those foods that you want to make meals that need a biscuit.

Made these tonight and think the texture and taste is wonderful. They are lite and flaky, however, mine did not rise much. Even tho the date on my baking powder is good, it is a cheap brand so maybe that is the problem. Followed the recipe exactly except cut the sugar to 1 tsp. since both of us are diabetic. They cooked faster on the outside than the inside so maybe next time I will try a little lower temp. I am at 3500 ft. and oven temp of 450 does not work well for me. Maybe it is the oven. In any case, I feel this is a great recipe and one I will keep trying until it works for me. Thanks for sharing!

These were quick to make! I like that it didn't have buttermilk or yeast or bread flour and I didn't need a mixer. Mine didn't look tall and fluffy though, I'll try again because we liked the taste.

Nancy, these biscuits are delicious!  They remind me of the ones my granny used to make me as a child!  As another user mentioned, I used 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup butter instead of all shortening.  These biscuits just melt in your mouth!  My husband enjoyed his with a little honey and butter!  YUM!!!

Delish!  I've always struggled with biscuits and pie crusts, and this is the first time I've ever had the former turn out!  Followed instructions exactly except subbed butter instead of shortening (didn't have any).  It made slightly less than the amount stated, but maybe I didn't roll them out enough.  I rarely rate things, but I just wanted to let other beginners out there know that it IS possible. :)

The recipe was good and a great guidance on how to tweak it. The recipe has too little salt and sugar and I will add more butter next time. Overall good recipe. BTW - I followed the recipe exactly as instructed.

I made these for my husband and son and they really enjoyed them. They prefer a sweeter biscuit so I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup. I will definitely be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!

WOW....after living in Louisiana for a year coming back to Canada I missed the biscuits so much.  All I can say about this recipe is WOW and TYVM.  It was so easy to do (although I forgot a step)  they came out fabulous.   Would recommend this recipe for sure.

These biscuits are very easy to make and rose very well. They are fluffy looking, but still have a heavier taste and texture- a slightly greasy feeling is left on the teeth and tounge.

These biscuits were really good.  I used half shortening, half butter and buttermilk for the milk.  These biscuits came out so tender and fluffy I love them.  I only kneaded them about 5 times too.

These weren't bad, I just think that I need to practice making them.  Mine didn't seem to rise like they were supposed to, but I think that my be my error, and not the recipe.  I think this is a recipe that probably gets better each time you make it.

I made these biscuits for the first time this morning and found them to be almost the best I've ever tasted.  I am a single retired male whose only cookbook is my mothers from the 1940's.  The biscuits in that book are good but fall apart as you spread anything on them.  These are moist, soft and great tasting.  Thank you for this recipe!

First time making biscuits and they were AWESOME! I didn't have shortening so I used butter and mixed it all up in the food processor. I was surprised at how fast and EASY these were to make. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

My first time trying biscuits.  Came out pretty good, but definitely the smaller ones came out the best.  Keep extra flour on hand just in case it is a little  sticky at first.

I made these today for my boyfriend when he came over for lunch with some fried chicken. The biscuits turned out amazingly! I doubled the recipe and rolled the dough out 1" thick. I followed the advice of other comments and substituted the shortening for 1/2 shortening, 1/2 butter and I also only kneaded them enough to made the dough hold together well. They were a hit. The only thing I would suggest with my method is to bake them a tad bit longer. 10 minutes wasn't quite enough to bake the thicker biscuits but they were still good.

I used a full teaspoon of salt and I used a 3 inch cutter. I used a milk and egg glaze.  The bigger biscuits took 13 minutes

Bland---I followed the recipe exactly and I would say they had NO TASTE. Like eating flour. Kneading 20 times makes these dense; needs more salt maybe?

Awesome....totally awesome!  Loved these.  Took that advice from a few reviewers and did 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter, and used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  Perfect amount of sweetness in these too!  This recipe is a keeper!

I did not have whole milk so I used skim but added an extra tablespoon of butter to make up the difference of the fat in the skim milk.  Then added one tablespoon of vinegar to the milk to make buttermilk.  These biscuits were the best I have ever made.  They rose beautifully and I will be making these again.

First time ever making biscuits, here is what I learned:  *Use 1/2 butter & 1/2 shortening I'm sure it tastes a lot better this way. *If your butter has salt cut back on the recipe's.  My butter had salt... so I learned. *Don't knead 20 times.  I did and they weren't so fluffy. *Don't wait for them to be golden once they are in the oven unless you've spread something on them. *Add the liquid very slowly or it will go terribly wrong. Will make again I loved them very much.

This was so quick and easy that my 6 year old made them (with a little help).  We live in Finland where you cannot get canned biscuits and we made these for a taste of home.  They were great!  We will definitely make them again.

Absolutely the best biscuits I've ever made or tasted.  These came together so easily and tasted so soft and mild.  I had them for breakfast with the pumpkin butter (from this site) and they were FANTASTIC.  Note, I didn't roll these out and cut them.  I simply kneaded the dough a bit in the bowl until it was smooth and then torn off chunks and rolled into balls which I patted down on top once on the pan.  They rose beautifully and looked very organice.  Love, love, love these biscuits.

I cannot make a biscuit..but I thought I'd give it one more try. First time they were good, I substituted butter for the shortning, and I was fairly pleased with the results. Second time, I used whole wheat flour and the shortening and I was again reminded I have no business making biscuits.lol I thought the dough was on the dry side so the third time I used margarine instead of shortening, added about a 1/3 c extra milk, used regular flour and these were biscuits to die for. Didn't rise as high as I would like, but I rolled it out on the thinner side, so that was my fault.  So tender and such a good flavor.  Now, if only I could get homemade bread to not turn out like something you would use for a doorstop ;-}

i think it's a good recipe, and only didn't turn out as great as i intended because i kneaded too much, and used butter instead of shortening. 20 times is too much, i think. i read tips and they say the more you knead, the tougher it gets.

Not too shabby for my first time baking biscuits from scratch. The first time the texture was a little too flaky. But, after a few tweaks, they came out pretty good for breakfast this morning. I'll keep working on them until I get then just right.

these biscuits are delicious!! I typically prefer buttermilk biscuits and was very impressed! I did make one change however, I used half shortening and half butter. They were much more flavorful with the butter. I would add a picture but we couldn't wait to eat them! :-) deelish!

I LOVED these!  Hubby thought they were "okay."  Biscuit-loving 10-yr-old ate only one, but he strongly prefers canned biscuits.  I love these because they came out flakey, tender and were somewhat bland but didn't taste like flour.  The benefit of a bland biscuit is being able to use it for whatever purpose you want without a baked-in flavor interfering with the end result.  IE: I don't put butter on the biscuit to make a breakfast sandwhich, nor to use with sausage gravy, nor when eating them with certain soups.  This recipe definitely replaces the one I've been using for many years.

Very easy...very tasty. I used butter instead of shortening. Next time I will try shortening. My biscuits didnt rise much at all, could be because my baking powder is getting old, I dont know, but they still tasted great!! Will make again for sure!

Made these this morning for biscuits and gravy and they turned out very yummy! Only problem is they were a little dry inside. Maybe I over cooked them? But overall very delicious. I will definetly make these again!

Okay, I tried to make this with butter and buttermilk as some of the others did, and they taste wonderful, however, I had a horrible time trying to roll the out and cut them, the dough was sticky and I finally gave up on cutting the out and just patted them out...they look NOTHING like the picture, which I presume is my fault.   But like I said these taste GREAT! Could anyone give me any tips on rolling and cutting these biscuits out. Thanks. and Thanks for a great recipe:)

My husband said these were really good, I kinda thought they tasted like flour. I am not a big biscuit fan, so what do i know! The recipe didn't make near 12 biscuits for me. I had to roll them out considerably thin to get 10 out of it. They did bake up really nice and tall anyway! I will make these again if my hubby wants me too, But I may try to look for another. It was very simple to do, always a plus!

Super recipe!! Made a couple adjustments - used cake flour & all-purpose. Also used part butter with the shortening and brushed a little melted butter on the tops before baking.  DEFINITELY keep all ingredients COLD to keep from getting hard biscuits and don't overwork the dough...less is best!  Great recipe.......certianly will make again.

I have tried several recipes but this one is the best! I cut 1/2 cup butter instead of the shortening. It made the biscuits taste soooo much better!! The family loved them!!!

These are great. I added them to my recipe box as soon as I ate one. I used a soup can to cut them and used them in chicken over biscuits. Soooo good!

I love these!  I have always used baking mix for biscuits because it was easy but I will never use it again!! I used this recipe and added them to my chicken stew for chicken and dumplings...amazing. I don't have a biscuit cutter so I just formed them into the correct shape.  Works just as well.

Instead of shortening, I used butter for flavor. I used a food processor to make these. The result?  PERFECT BISCUITS.   They puffed up in the oven like a dream and they practically melted in my mouth. However, I do like my biscuits a little flakier, so next time (aka, right now!) I'll use half butter and half shortening.

These are awesome and ridiculously easy to make! I had never made biscuits in my life and my Southern husband loved them! I used margarine instead of shortening (since I didn't have any) and used the top of a round, narrow drinking glass to cut the biscuit shapes since I don't own a biscuit cutter. I'll definitely be making them again soon!

I was making Pork Chops to Live For (on this site) and wanted something to go with! OMG they were amazing. I did use cold butter instead. And i didnt knead or roll the dough just scooped it out with a ice cream scooper on a greased cookie sheet and brushed them with melted butter! So good and so easy!

These biscuits were really delicious!  I have tried many recipes, and these really baked up well.  Light, fluffy and tender.  I will use this recipe all the time now.  I have never made biscuits that called for an egg, maybe that is the difference.  I used shortening, not butter and the texture was great.

This recipe is awesome! I substituted butter for the shortening, per many other reviews -- I think had I made this with shortening the recipe would've lacked flavor. My end result was a fantastic flavor, with a so-so texture :)

Amazing is right.  I have tried 12 different recipes to make Biscuits.  None worked.  This is the best.  I am so particular about breads, texture, taste, ingredients, etc.  These biscuits exceeded my expectations.  Hint:  Make sure your baking powder is not too old!  Enjoy!

Wow...are these biscuits ever GOOD!!!  I've been hesitant to make biscuits believing that they'd be difficult to make, but I was wrong!  I did make a few adjustments based on previous reviews.  I used buttermilk instead of plain ol' milk, and I used butter instead of shortening.  I also didn't kneed it as much as it said...maybe only 5 or 6 times instead of 20.  Fabulous...I'll definately be making them again!

Update: I've made these several times and I can tell you that the best way is this: 
1. Use salted butter instead. 
2. Do not cut in the butter til it resembles crumbs. Cut it in til it's about the size of small peas/half a pea. 
3. Do NOT need it what so ever. After cutting the butter in, pour the milk & egg mixture over the dry and stir til it just comes together. 
4. Dump the biscuit mixture onto a floured surface, sprinkle with flour and then pat it flat to about 3/4 of an inch thick. 
5. Cut the biscuits as desired and bake 8 minutes, remove and let rest. 
These are the keys to getting TENDER, FLAKY biscuits that have a good flavor. The original instructions are good, but if you make these changes the biscuits are wonderful. Note: I usually cut my dough into wedges like scones. 

Original Review: As other suggested, I used butter instead of shortening. But I do that with pretty much all recipes. I'm not a fan of shortening at all. The most I go is 50/50 on a recipe. Anyway... I added a bit of pepper to the recipe because I was using the biscuits to top a casserole. Other than the pepper and butter I followed the recipe closely. I used an organic egg and skim milk and kneaded it about 25 times. I oiled the top with some grape seed oil and they turned out delicious. Golden brown. Light. Tender. So tender. They were PERFECT with the casserole filling (ground lean turkey+mixed veggies+can of golden mushroom soup+minced onions+herbs+S&P). Family wolfed it down with pleasure!

To start, I made a double batch(wanted plenty of tasting). I used half, salted- butter/half margerine, cut the sugar by 1 teaspoon, added 1 1/2 teaspoon lemon juice. Baked at 400/410F/27ft elevation. I am very pleased with the soft mealy-texture(crumbly, not flaky), high-rise(started at 1" raised to nearly 3". The spreading the dough by hand and folding 20 times brings great results. The big plus for me is that these biscuits don't leave a slick/greasy feel in the mouth(ate 5 in a row). The finished biscuit bakes-up squaty(larger at the bottom), but in no way is un-attractive. I tried a few right out of the oven, the texture is dense and over-moist, I prefer them at room temp. the feel in the mouth is so inviting and leads to reaching for many more.

This is hands down my favorite biscuit recipe.  I'm not sure if it's my regional area, but the amount of milk is a bit too much, I usually only add about 1/2 cup of milk.

This a great biscuit because it is so fast and easy and does not dry out. I don't roll the dough out though. I just drop them by tablespoons onto the pan and bake. They turn out great!

I made almost this recipe, except that I did some research on making biscuits.  The article claimed that using 1 cup of regular flour and 1 cup of cake flour would make a great deal of different.  The fat ratio is 1/2 cup for every two cups of "flour".  I used unsalted butter the first time and it was so bland!  The second time I used salted butter and 1/2 tsp. of salt.  My recipe didn't call for egg, but did call for buttermilk.  I made the "homemade" version of buttermilk (milk and vinegar).  They were the best biscuit I've ever made, but I'm still looking for a biscuit that reminds me of BoB Evans biscuits.  I'd kill for that recipe!

Ok, but very bland.  I used the half butter/ half shortening, but it didn't seem to add any flavor at all.  There are so many biscuits that are so much better.

Big, light, and fluffy.  I used butter instead of shortening, which tasted great, but they did spread just a little at the bottom.  Really  yummy.

WOW! These were amazing!!! I was a little nervous because I've hever made homemade biscuits before, but these turned out PERFECT! --just like grandma's. I served them with a southern gravy recipe (also found on this site) that was also amazing! My wife was crazy for it too. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

These are wonderful biscuits! I didn't want to use shortening and didn't have butter, so I used margarine. Still turned out great. I will make these again and again! Thanks for the recipe!

My family really liked these biscuits, we have tried other recipes in the past and always end up with bland biscuits, I just need to get my rolling down and they should be a little higher, but that didn't hinder the taste or make them tough they are great with chocolate gravy my youngest favorite...thanks

Best biscuit recipe I've found yet! Easy enough to make for breakfast with my 17 month old running around my legs and a hungry 135lb Mastiff growling at me and still come out perfect in no time with no changes at all to the original recipe!

While the recipe went together well and was easy to make, I didn't care for the taste of the shortening and might try it again with half butter.

I had tried three other recipes and this recipe is the best one with a few substitutions.  I used butter instead of shortening and buttermilk instead of milk.  The flavor of the biscuit was exactly what I was looking for!

Decided I needed a biscuit tonight to go with dinner so I gave these a try and I am so glad I did. They were very light, and fluffy. I did however use all butter since that is what I had on hand but kept everything else the same. It was a big hit with the family and I can't wait to try them with biscuits and gravy.

I am fairly new to making biscuits and have been trying to find a good recipe.  I almost gave up on me making a good biscuit from scratch that I was satisfied with.  This recipe is great.  It rises better and is more tender and flakey that any others I have tried.  I brush the biscuits with melted butter before baking and have also tried with cinnamon and sugar on top of the butter before baking.  Thank you for the good eats.

I also did half shortening and half butter and brushed with warm melted butter before baking.  Instead of kneading, I dropped them on the baking sheet and the family devoured them.  They were the most moist biscuits I've ever made.  Will make for our holiday meals.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was really easy.  I substituted the shortening with butter.  I also changed the temperature to 350 for about 15 - 18 minutes or until golden brown.  I live in the South where it was a little humid today so you might have to change the temperature on your oven.

Added some garlic and cheddar cause I love both of em. Biscuits fluffy, but not really flaky. Fluffy but the texture wasnt firm enough for me. Will do again if I cant find a better recipe.

I just made these biscuits this morning and I was not impressed at all. They are not fluffy. They are heavy and dense. They are very bland tasting. The only way we could eat them was with butter and honey. I agree that this is an easy recipe but I would never make these again.

I substituted butter for the shortening and they turned out pretty good. I've made them 2x now and was sure to keep them somewhat thick before cutting them, so they cook up nice & big for butter & strawberry jam!

These biscuits are super easy to make, so for that I would have given them 5 stars!  I followed the recipe exactly, and they were good.  Not super, but good.  My kids loved them, so I will be making them again, but I will also continue to search for that perfect biscuit recipe.  These biscuits were flakey, and they had a good consistency overall.  We made egg, sausage, and cheese breakfast sandwiches out of them.

These are Awesome!!!  I made them to have with biscuits & gravy and didn't have shortening so used butter.  They puffed up soo nice and the taste is great!  I doubled the recipe and the leftovers I put in the freezer and then I've been popping those out a couple at a time and microwaving for less than a minute and they are still GREAT!!!  Thank You!!!

These were great. I didn't roll them out, instead I made them like drop biscuits. I also added a handful of shredded cheese and about a teaspoon of garlic powder. 

I also made these with gluten free self rising flour and just cut the baking powder down to a teaspoon. I was afraid it would turn out another failed biscuit experiment but it was really good. Couldn't tell it was any different than regular flour once baked...although before it was cooked did look just like really think mashed potatoes. Perfect with beef stew,

Love the biscuits. They are truely fluffy! I used half shortening and half butter. I also halved the recipe. Maybe I didn't do the right math, my dough was very sticky... so I added more flour and still end up with 6 good size biscuits. They are so easy to made. Thank you!

This was my first attempt ever at homemade biscuits, and they turned out beautifully.  I did forget to add the sugar, but they tasted great otherwise.  I rolled the dough out to a 1.5 inch height and baked them for about 9 minutes.  Easy to make and very delicious.  Thanks!!

Excellent!  Substituted shortening for butter.  Also, I had halved the recipe (cooking for only two) and found I did not need to use all of the milk/egg mixture.  I am already looking forward to the next instance when my menu requires biscuits!  I think these would be good as biscuits and gravy.

These were great. I have been wanting to make good biscuits and I finally have my perfect recipe. My 6 year old and I have eaten half the pan in 20 minutes. I made these with the strawberry jam recipes on this site and can't stop eating them. Next time I will use a little less salt, but they are perfect otherwise.

I, too, am in search of "the" biscuit recipe.  These are very, very good.  I chilled my shortening prior to cutting it into the flour and only kneaded enough to get the dough to the point where I could pat it down, not roll it out.  Very light and fluffy, with nice crisp bottoms.  My husband does not like biscuits much in general, but ate two of these with a bowl of veg. soup I made for dinner.

Ok I made as directed and the bottoms were VERY hard and brown and the tops were white.  How can I get these to brown evenly without burning the bottoms?

Followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect! I melted some butter and lightly brushed that on to the tops of the biscuits as soon as I pulled them out of the oven. Picture perfect and so tasty.

I tried incoporating everyone else's idea and I had to agree that with more milk & butter I had to increase my flour. They did not raise as high as I would have liked so will have to roll out dough thicker next time (I probably did not have them the 3/4"). This is a recipe you have to try several times to get it like you want. They tasted good so I guess that was the most important!

These biscuits we're okay, but nothing to rave about. They had a slightly sweet taste, and although they were tender, they tasted a little bland to me. I probably won't make them again, just because I'm looking for those super fluffy, very tender, buttery biscuits. I did use shortening as called for, so maybe they would be a lot better with butter instead.

These are excellent. I will definatelty be making these again. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I did not have a biscuit cutter so I just used a glass cup to make round circles for biscuits. Also I used margarine instead of shortening. Very Good!!

Wonderful! It was just the recipe I was looking for.  I did take another reviewers advice and used butter instead of shortening.  It ended up being the perfect biscuit.

Awesome! I followed the recipe as is. The only thing I added was brushing melted butter on the tops of them before placing them in the oven. They came out flakey and crisp on the outside and moist and soft on the inside. I will be keeping this recipe around! Thank you for sharing.

This recipe is the best that I've ever had for biscuits. I have only aprox. 3tb. of baking soda and they still came out fluffy. The only thing that I changed was melting some additional butter to brush on the biscuit before and after baking. DELICIOUS!

Outstanding recipe! The first recipe I have used and gotten consistent results. They are fluffy, slightly crisp on the outside, wonderful plain jane biscuit flavor. The egg was a surprising ingredient but it really lends to this a moistness and flavor and fluffs it up a bit. This biscuit works great with dinners sides, biscuits and gravy and even stands up to strawberry shortcake desserts! (split biscuit, place strawberry mix on bottom biscuit, place top of biscuit on top and bury it all in whipped cream- mmm!) Thanks for this awesome recipe, submitter!

I cannot begin to tell you how good this biscuit is!  I am a true southerner and extremely picky about having a flaky biscuit that has flavor.  This one did both.  Per a recent reviewer, I used 1/2 c butter instead and did increase the amount of milk to 3/4 c.  I used cake flour mainly and all purpose when kneading. These biscuits are THE BEST!

These turned out just as advertised except that they didn't raise as high as the pictures.  This only tells me it's time to throw out the huge container of baking powder that's older than the hills!  These were perfect, fantastic with our soup last night --so much so, that I brought out a tub of creamy strawberry fruit spread (with "real strawberries and natural yogurt") and we had them for dessert, too.  Highly recommended that way as well!  Yum, yum, yum.  The only recipe I'll use from now on.  Thanks so much!!!

I am not sure if I am doing something wrong, but these are not very good. I did use butter instead of shortning and a little extra milk. I did 2 batchs, but they were not fluffy and have little taste.

I have been looking for a good biscuit recipe and i have finally found it!  This is a great recipe!  I exchanged a half cup of white flour for wheat flour to make a little healthier and they were still fluffy.  I think next time I will try half and half to see if it works just as well.

I had to add a little bit more shortening to my mix to get the biscuits to the correct consistency, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  These biscuits are fantastic!!!

This recipe turned out really good. I followed the recipe exactly as written except I used a food processor for mixing. They are really fluffy and light.
