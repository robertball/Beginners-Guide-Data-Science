I made this exactly as directed. It was very sweet and refreshing. I did find it a touch too boozy for my personal taste, so I ended up diluting it a little more with the club soda. You could also just cut back on the rum according to what you like. 
My watermelon wasn't super ripe yet, so I definitely needed the full amount of simple syrup, but if you have a really ripe one add half of the syrup and do a taste test, you may not need it all.
