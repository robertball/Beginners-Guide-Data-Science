GREAT flavor!  I'd use thicker chops next time or cut time by a few minutes if you only have thin ones!

I forgot parsley but pretty much did it as printed.  However I used very thick boneless chops and 10 minutes, needed a few more minutes.  Baked potatoe and corn on cob - Great!

My boneless pork chops were only about 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick. I did them for about 4 minutes on each side. They were wonderful.

I made it just like the recipe and it was GEEAT. We'll be making it a lot more often.

These chops came out so moist and tender.  With a couple of changes, I would definitely make this recipe again. In my house, we love a crispy pork chop, so next time; I may try adding some panko in with the parmesan cheese and see if that gets it there. We also found that the seasoning wasn't enough, but other than that, we really enjoyed this as it was a healthier option to deep frying and cleanup was a breeze.

This was quick and easy. One of the few pork chops I didn't find "dry". I'd make it again.

Very good.  I used thick chops with a bone, so it took longer- about 16 min.  I'll definitely make it again
