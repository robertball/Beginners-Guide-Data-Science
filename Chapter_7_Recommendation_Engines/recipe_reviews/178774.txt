Great idea.  These were made the night before I needed them, cooled on a wire rack so not to get soggy and heated great the next day.  I patted dry the hot dogs, this way the dough sticks easily.  Also froze the left overs and will heat as needed.  Freezes great, reheats great.  Thank you for the neat idea.

Cute! Used bun length hotdogs.  For my taste, I should have used more dough (because of the size) but the kids prefer less bread so it was perfect for them.  Cooked 80%, then popped back in with oven fries to reheat.  Perfect.  Omitted cheese but used some cheesedogs for variety.  Found that if you stretch the dough and let it twist as you wrap, it turns out more bandage-like when it cooks.  Leave a few ends sticking out to make it look raggedy - they brown up really cute this way.  20 dogs fed 6 10-12year olds and 2 adults with 3 for lunch the next day. (They would have been gone but they had to get out the door to trick-or-treat ASAP!)  Reheats perfectly in oven, not micro.
Oh!  And I actually called Pilsbury.  They say not to leave dough out unbaked (in fridge) more than 2 hours or it may not rise.  Whew.  I'm done now!

These were fun to make but very time consuming.  I did add a little extra work as I cut hotdogs in half to make it more of a hors d’oeuvre.  Then cut a “V”ish shaped notched near the cut end, on the top/face side to represent feet.  This made it a little harder to wrap but for my event, it was worth it.  The only problem I had was I must have cut the cloth (crescent roll strips) too narrow as some of them crumbled a little after they were put into the serving dish.  I only put 2 mustard dots for eyes and skipped the mouth.  It made them a little more scary but still cute.  For a special occasion, I would make these again.

I took the advice of one of the raters, and I dried the dogs off with paper towels so the dough would stick better, my daughter loved them!

We love these. I like to use "wurst" dogs--especially the cheddarwurst dogs. I like mine with sauteed onions and sauerkraut, my husband likes his covered in chili and the kids like to dip theirs in ketchup to make them all "bloody". GREAT for those last minute quick dinners after a long day.

Kind of a pain to roll, but they were the crowd favorite at our halloween party. I didn't use the cheese. I will use this year round for the kids, thankfully saving the mummy technique for only once a year!

These were fun to make, but choose the hot dogs carefully.(I bought an expensive brand) Ours were so oily that when we were done eating we all felt gross and almost sick. Yuck. If I ever do these agian, it will be with Turky dogs.

These were cute but hard to wrap the dough.  It got sticky and fell off a lot.  My grandchildren loved them so that is what counts anyway.  I used a toothpick dipped in mustard to make the face.  It was perfect that way.

We made these at Halloween (I know very late reviewing them!!) They were good but I found it tricky getting the cheese rolled into them.

I just made these for my son's preschool party and the kids loved them!  I used Foster Farms Turkey Franks and left out the cheese.  I also followed a previous reviewer's advice and patted the hot dogs dry with a paper towel before wrapping them.  At first I had a hard time cutting the dough but then I took out my pizza cutter (the rolling kind) and was able to cut out the strips in no time.  Thank you for the great recipe!  We will definitely be making them again!

Saw this recipe and thought it would be perfect for my girls to make for dinner-makes them feel special when they help with the making.  I didn't find it as time consuming as some-maybe cause I had six little hands helping. LOL.  A nice twist on the average hotdog.  I don't know if it was me but I did think that perhaps baking them made them taste much saltier..but other than that I will keep this recipe in the good old recipe box for the future.

Great idea! Kids loved it for their Halloween party. Yummy too! I should add it is easier to use the sheets instead of the rolls. Just use a pizza cutter to slice it into strips.

We enjoyed making these.  Something little hands can help do!  Made exactly minus the cheese.  They were all devoured!  Used diced pimento slice for the eyes.  Will make again!

These are really good, and easy to make!  I used turkey hot dogs so they'd be a little healthier. I also omitted the cheese since it seemed like it would leak out anyway while cooking. The slight sweetness of the crescent dough made these taste similar to corn dogs. Yummy served with mustard!

This was more work than expected.  It took 30 minutes to wrap 21 dogs.  I think it got harder as I went along because the dough was getting tougher to work with.  I would definitely do it again though.  I won a prize at a Halloween contest for them!

Fun party food. Had the kids assemble them.  A hit with the kids ... what is not to like? Used turkey dogs to cut down on the grease.

Looked great and all the kids at the party loved them.  One issue, I had to cook about 10 minutes longer than recipes states. I continuously rolled the dogs over so the dough could get cooked. Next time, I would omit the cheese (you can't taste it anyway) and wrap with less dough, so that it would cook quicker and the finished product would taste less like mushy dough and more like hot dogs.

These are fast, easy, yummy AND cute! What more can you ask for? My daughter had lots of fun helping me make them (even though we are nowhere near Halloween!) I had the stuff to make them on hand and I'm glad I decided to make them! I used Nathan's hot dogs, YUMMM! =)

Cute and yummy, but takes some effort to wrap the hot dog with thin slices of dough. I would make this for my kids again next Halloween.

Such a fun item. We brought ours to a pumpkin carving party and they were a hit! We used beef franks and in order to avoid a lot of grease while baking I just wiped them with a paper towel before baking. I will make these as our pre trick or treating snack from now on!

Easy and delicious, not quick though, at least not if you make fifty. And forget about the eyes if you're baking them after guests arrive, there will be no time.

Great idea, and did turn out good, but time consuming to cut the dough and once the dough gets room temp, it gets super sticky and harsd to wrap right. Overall, great for my Halloween party, the kids and adults ate them up!

Made for our Halloween party and it was so good that they were all gone before I got one! I started making the strips really skinny to make it look more like a mummy, but the skinny AND fat strips of crescent dough both looked cute!

My dad's birthday is on Halloween, so I made these for our annual front yard bonfire. Everyone loved them! The only thing I changed was that I used half a slice of cheese vs a quarter slice.

I hate hot dogs unless they are charred over an open flame, but these were so tasty (and cute!). The kids loved them and they made a great addition to our Halloween menu for the kids. We omitted the cheese because I forgot, but they didn't even need it. Definitely have to try it with cheese next time!

These were so fun to make and SOOOO yummy to eat.  My oldest had a great time making these.  We used 100% Beef hotdogs...which makes them jucier and yummier!  What a fantastic idea for a quick and easy Halloween meal before trucking off for Trick-or-Treating!  Definitely a yearly tradition for us!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for my daughter's Egypt day at school, and the kids loved them!
I left out the cheese because one of the children had a milk allergy and they were still great.  
Also, I prepared them the night before and just baked them in the morning...worked great!!

Okay so these were time consuming BUT I made them in advance with mini hot dogs and refrigerated them wrapped in plastic wrap on a cookie sheet and so that made it a lot easier for me.  A few tips, it is best to work with this dough cold so if you are slow (like me) keep the rest of the dough refrigerated while you work.  These came out super cute and surprisingly tasty!!  I left out the cheese.

These weren't as great as I thought they would be -- just not as much flavor as I had hoped for. Will probably not make again, as regular hot dogs taste about the same to me but are easier/ less time consuming.

I made these last Halloween with smoked cocktail wieners, and cut strips of the seamless crescent dough.  I did not use cheese.  I also dried off excess moisture from the wieners with a paper towel like many of the other reviewers suggested.   I served them with mustard and ketchup dipping bowls.  They turned out great, so cute and really delicious a real crowd pleaser.  I will be making them again this Halloween for our annual pumpkin carving weekend!

Very cute and very yummy! I'd recommend cooking them longer than it says, though, because ours came out a little doughy on the inside. It may also be from the hot dog juices, so try wiping them before wrapping.

I was really excited to try these for my halloween party.  I put my man in charge of making these so I'm not sure what went wrong, but they were VERY salty and the "bandages" split while we were cooking them.

Even my picky 7 y/o loved these and he doesn't like hot dogs! I would have like to have a little more breading on mine but they were still really good. We will do these again and not just on Halloween!

As hot dogs go, it's a 5 star recipe. I mean, it's not haute cuisine, it's a hot dog recipe, so I'm not going to pretend like I'm rating the flavor. The idea is very cute and simple to execute. Very festive for this spooky night, thanks for sharing! P.S. I had absolutely no issues with "mushy dough" nor did I have to flip them.

I made these twice for my sons birthday which is in october and both times every child from ages 3-12 took off the crescent dough. They said the breading was horrible.Dont think i will make these for his birthday next year.  Cute idea though.

I made these before, for a Halloween party when I did daycare and the kids really liked them. I made them again today and it had been some time since then. I realized that hotdogs come in 8 packs now and not 10. I don't remember flipping them face side down and spraying them either. I found that it browned the part I wanted to show too much. So, I wouldn't do that next time. I used a more expensive hot dog this time and found I prefer what I believe was Ball Park hotdogs I used before. It had a more mild flavor. Make sure to have a mustard with a thin nozzle. I had to use a toothpick to make the faces. Overall, they took a little longer than I remembered, to assemble, but I wouldn't mind making them for a Halloween party because I know the kids enjoy them.

I made these for my 5 y/o Daughters Halloween party at the YMCA and she said that all of the kids ate them up right away.  They looked so cute after I put the mustard face on them.  I do not see why some thought that it was time consuming.  I thought that it was pretty quick and easy but that may be because my daughter and I had fun assembling them.  Fun times...

Although I never eat hot dogs this was a big hit at my sister in laws Halloween party.  They were all gone by the end of the night.  I received lots of compliments on their cuteness.  They were a little more time consuming than expected but everyone enjoyed them so they were well worth it.

Loved this idea:) Made  the mummy wraps for our halloween party this year. I planned in using the cheese but forgot when rushing and putting everything together. I sliced the dough vertically one slice of dough was enough for a full length hot dog  i cut small piece of the head piece on both ends of the dog and made a space between the one slice of dough and the head piece to give it the mummy look. One can of crescent  was enough for about 15 hot dogs. I sliced them down the middle cooked for 13-15 minutes. Added black icing for eyes came out amazing. Add a side of Wataburger's spicy ketchup! Our guests loved them. I uploaded a picture see how they came out:)

There is no way that one can of rolls will cover 10 dogs. I used 2 cans and couldn't do all 16 dogs that I need for tonight. I cut the dough into very thin strips, some less that 1/4 inch and they still didn't cover like the picture shows.

These were delicious. I make them every year around Halloween, the kids are always anxious for them. Posted them on Facebook and had a ton of friends want to try them (and for all that did, not one gave a bad review.) Delicious with ketchup or mustard!

Cute idea for the kids.  I did cook them longer as they were still a little doughy. I used chicken sausages instead of the hotdogs just because I had some in the fridge.

Huge hit at our Halloween party.  I used the crescent sheets and cut with a pizza cutter.  So easy!  The mustard came out too thick, so I used it as 'glue' with Cherrios for the eyes.

Fun little dogs!  Could make anytime with just the pastry. Hubby said he could eat them every day!

Fun and easy to make, and they were a hit at the Halloween party we attended!  Even fun for teens!

I wish I had read the reviews first, I would have used turkey dogs to cut down on the oily factor.

Quick, easy, & GREAT tasting! To avoid the greasiness, I boil the dogs for a couple minutes first. I do this w/smoked & polish sausage too otherwise I get that yucky tummy feeling, as described by others.

Delicious, fun, super easy.  The crescent rolls have such a buttery sweet taste, better than a hot dog bun.  The reaction from my nephew was worth the few minutes it takes to roll them up!
