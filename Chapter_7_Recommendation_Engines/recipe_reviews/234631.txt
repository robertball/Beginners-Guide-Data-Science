This is a great recipe.  I made it twice.  The first time I adapted it to make a festive looking meal for the vegetarian clients of our soup kitchen.  I started with Stovetop Cornbread stuffing, prepared as directed then added sautéed celery, onions and grated carrot and pressed it into the baking pan as a crust.  I added a layer of chopped Portabella mushrooms which I sautéed with onions and mixed with Italian cheese blend.  The top was mashed potatoes, piped into rosettes.  This was the first time I felt we presented a vegetarian meal equal to the regular meal.  The second time I made it as per the recipe, but using leftover stuffing and a frozen vegetable mix with leftover turkey.  The mayo made it moist and enhanced the flavors.  The topping was a bit scant because there was only a small amount of left over mashed potatoes.  I served it with homemade cranberry relish and no one whined about leftovers.

This recipe turned out a lot better than I was expecting. Honestly, I love my Thanksgiving leftovers and I eat them, as is, for breakfast, lunch, & dinner. My husband gets bored easily though, so I gave this a try. I wasn't expecting it to be great, but it was. I reduced the servings to two, because I didn't want to use up all my leftovers. I used my homemade stuffing, green beans we had instead of mixed veggies, and we don't care for mayo so I swapped it for leftover gravy so the dish would have moisture and it worked like a charm. This was so simple to throw together and it tasted wonderful. I will keep this recipe handy to use throughout the year for quick meals when I have leftover chicken to use up.

OK, so this recipe was a pleasant surprise.  I have to be honest and say that I wasn't sure I was going to like it.  Sure, I like all of the Thanksgiving food ingredients.  But the mixed vegetables, added with the mayo...I was skeptical.  But I have to say this casserole is absolutely fabulous!  The end result is very pot pie-ish, and that's always a winner with my family.  It's the ultimate comfort food, and this puts a wonderful Thanksgiving spin on it!

I was actually surprised I liked this as much as I did.  I did lighten it up by using Kraft reduced fat sharp cheddar cheese, Kraft Olive Oil Mayo, and making the stuffing with only 1 TBS of butter.  I also added a tsp of poultry seasonings (recipe from this site) to the mayo-turkey-vegetable mix.  Garnished the top of the casserole with green onions as well as the paprika.  This is a good recipe to use up Thanksgiving leftovers.

I cooked my "make-ahead" turkey gravy this weekend, so I added extra turkey wings, and used that meat to make half of this recipe.  This takes minutes to assemble, and it gets two thumbs up in this house.  I had some concerns about the addition of mayo, but I think all is did was add some moisture, but none of its flavor.  I can see making this with leftover chicken as well as turkey throughout the year.  Great new casserole that will be recycled often here!

My family loved this recipe!  I used Kraft Olive Oil Mayo and added some dried thyme and poultry seasoning to the turkey and vegetable mixture.  Serve with gravy and whole berry cranberry sauce--it reminded us of a turkey shepherd's pie.  This is a great way to use up leftovers, and it's so versatile.  Use your own stuffing, favorite vegetables, and make it your own!

I thought this tasted good, but honestly reminded me of a Thanksgiving plate layered. If making this with leftovers, it took considerably more turkey and potatoes than I had expected. I used about 8 good sized medium potatoes and the turkey was about 2/3 of the white meat on a turkey. I liked the potato and stuffing layer. I boiled the potatoes in water flavored with no-sodium chicken broth powder for extra flavor. The stuffing, I tweaked to a homemade stuffing with sauteed onions, dried sage, and some extra bread and a little liquid added to Stove Top's cornbread stuffing. I didn't love the middle layer. I added some seasonings, but it kind of reminded me of turkey salad. I used regular mayo, as I find miracle whip more of a sweet salad dressing. However, all together it worked fine. As this doesn't have any sauce to it, definitely serve with your favorite Thanksgiving additions. Think, I will be making some homemade cranberry sauce to go on the side. It's a must, for me, with a Thanksgiving meal.

This was a huge hit!  Simple to throw together and a great (and versatile) way to use leftovers.  My daughter is a picky eater and she gobbled her serving up and asked me to put it in her lunch the next day!  Since it's not Thanksgiving yet and I didn't have any leftover turkey lying around I subbed leftover chicken and it was just fine.  This one will definitely be made again after Thanksgiving!

I was surprised that I liked this, as I AM NOT a casserole person at all. The green beans that I made for Thanksgiving had miracle whip, bacon and onions, so I just used those in place of the frozen mixed veggies and miracle whip in the recipe. What I did like a lot about this is that it sure saves on space in the refrigerator! Rather than 3 or 4 containers of leftovers, you just have one casserole dish.

I wasn't sure how I would like this casserole, but, boy was I surprised!   Based on other reviews I added some poultry seasoning and garlic powder to the filling, but, other than that made exactly as the recipe stated.  I used mayonnaise instead of miracle whip due to my personal preference.  The casserole came together quickly and was hearty and flavorful.   It tasted like a cross between a pot pie and a shepherd's pie. It is a nice change for your leftovers from your Thanksgiving meal.  I would recommend serving gravy on the side.

This recipe is a good base recipe for your holiday leftovers. It can be tweaked to your personal taste which I plan on doing the next time I make it. As written my husband loved the idea behind it and was full of suggestions on how to make it better. One kid ate it no complaints, 2 others picked at their favorite parts and my picky eater wouldn't touch it.

This recipe was okay as written. But did make them a second time to be more portable for what I was looking for, then added herb spices to the turkey and veggie mixture as it was just blah the 1st time. The 2nd time was way much better. And the 2nd batch...there was no leftovers.

This was super easy to make. As I was assembling the casserole, my family was saying, "mayonnaise, really." However, when we ate the casserole, everyone said it was good. It is a good way to get my family to eat vegetables. I do think I would add some milk (1/4 cup or more) to the mayonnaise because I like more sauce. Other than that, this is a good recipe to use up all the leftovers.

I love this recipe!  I celebrated Thanksgiving early this year when my sister was visiting me over the weekend so I was able to make this today.  I followed the recipe completely but added in some salt and pepper, poultry seasoning, and chopped fresh rosemary to the turkey/vegetable mixture.  It was delicious!  Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday and I love the traditional meal.  I will often make it once during the year aside from Thanksgiving just because I love it so.  This recipe might just save me from going through all the work when I am craving it again and it's a long time till November :-)  I can see using a rotisserie chicken in place of the turkey and Stove Top stuffing is available all year long so it's a no brainer!  This is one of those recipes where I ask myself, "Why didn't I think of it first????"  I will say I was skeptical about using the mayo, but it worked in it beautifully and this is NOT a greasy dish because of it.  I added my own homemade cranberry sauce from this site which went beautifully with this casserole. Nice recipe!

I made this at Thanksgiving and just realized that I forgot to review this at that time.  My family really loved this meal and they don't usually care for leftovers so that is saying a lot.  I plan on making this again in the future.

This recipe as written was just ok for my family. I would change the frozen vegetables out and use what I have leftover. It went together very easily which was great for a Black Friday when you are exhausted from all of your Thanksgiving festivities and then shopping.

Easy. Tasted pretty good. The thought of the mayo kind of threw me a little but it was very tasty. I made this after a pre-Thanksgiving dinner I had. Only thing I would add would be some leftover gravy to pour on top. Yum.

This was better than I thought it would be!  A nice surprise.  I did use mayo in mine...a personal preference.  And I baked it at 350 for about an hour to try to get the cornbread Stove Top stuffing I used and the mashed potato/cheese topping a little "crunchy".  Worked great.  I had some leftover gravy, so poured a little of that over the top.  It was in the oven within 15 minutes, so it's a really easy recipe to try after all those days before and during Thanksgiving spent in the kitchen.  Very good!

What's more convenient than a casserole? Make it more nutritious by adding more veggies. Used Herdez frozen vegetables for color and flavor. Satisfying and quite good.

I didn’t expect to like this but actually quite enjoyed all the flavors.  Even the mayo which I was a bit concerned about.  Used canned veggies as we didn’t have frozen but made as described.  This recipe will be different every time based on the leftover nature and it offers quite a bit of possibility.   Mmmm!

This is an easy recipe to use up all the leftovers from a Thanksgiving meal.  I followed the directions,  except I used my yummy gravy made from drippings in place of the Mayonnaise, with corn and green beans.   This recipe lends itself to be easily modified to suit your personal taste.  I think I may dry drizzling warm cranberry jelly over it next time.

Great recipe to use as a guide. In corporate any leftovers you have. I replaced the vegetables with green bean casserole and skipped the mayo. Add cranberry sauce on the side when serving. Delicious!

I had (from bottom to top) homemade cornbread dressing, green bean casserole, fresh baked turkey, half sweet potatoes half potato salad with cheddar cheese to top, salt and pepper to taste. No cheddar on the sweet potatoes though. I had cranberry sauce on the side. My husband and I loved it! Most of the recipes are from Allrecipes.com. They are the only site I get recipes from.

OK, so the idea of all of that mayo/salad dressing kind of wigged me out, so I made some adjustments. Now, I based this on about 20 servings (not exact) as I had almost 4 cups of frozen veggies that I wanted to use up (a carrots/zucchini/squash/peas mix). The carrots, zucchini and squash were frozen in slices, so I chopped them up while still frozen. But I didn’t have enough left-over stuffing. So, I baked a box of cornbread (Jiffy type), then had a brain-storm to make a  “southwest” version AFTER I’d baked the cornbread. I sautéed about 1/4 each of red, green & yellow peppers and about 1/5 of a sweet onion in some olive oil, then I threw in about 2 heaping T’s of medium salsa (minus the liquid), chunked up the baked cornbread into a bowl and added the pepper/salsa combo, and mixed well. I loosely pressed that into a 9x9 baking dish. So, I had a 9x13 (deep) baking dish and a 9x9 baking dish, both w/stuffing loosely pressed into the bottom (I sprayed both w/non-stick). For the turkey mixture ~ I put maybe 2 heaping tablespoons of the mayo, then mixed in leftover (thick) giblet gravy with the veggies and turkey and spread over the two “crusts”.

This is by far, the best casserole I have ever ate and fed my family, in my life! Way better then ANY traditional turkey with mashed potatoes etc. I grew up in the U.P. of Michigan with a comfort food background. This dish will warm up your soul. I did a few things different, I sprinkled one cup of yellow raw onions and salt and pepper on top of the stuffing (my own stuffing from scratch from dinner the night before ). Then I combined one can french cut, one can regular cut green beans with miracle whip, one cup of green, red, and yellow peppers, and two cups of green onions. I made this casserole pretty big. After I put that turkey-green bean mix on top of the stuffing, I then warmed up my left over potatoes a little bit and then put one cup of cubed pepper jack cheese, and 1/2 stick of cubed butter, dashes of salt and pepper in the potatoes, and very thinly layered it on top. Then I sprinkled McCormick Grill Mates garlic and herb seasoning and HOT paprika on top of the potatoes. The potatoes were nice and thin and crispy brown when it was done! My better half gave it a 10 :) WOW THANK YOU for this recipe!!! After making this recipe you will ONLY look forward to eating this and making this casserole the day after a big holiday dinner, not the dinner itself LOL hahaha :D

A keeper. Used left over dressing. Had left over veggies from relish tray and chopped in food processor, zapped in microwave. Reduced mayo by thinning with 1/4 cup milk. Also added 1/2 t poultry seasoning. Continued as recipe directed. May try again using left over ham or beef roast. Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty but I thought it was a little dry.  We warmed up leftover gravy poured on just before eating.   I made all the difference in the world.

My family enjoyed this. I sprinkled some extra cheese on top when I pulled it out of the oven. Next time I might try a cream of mushroom or chicken soup instead of mayo.

Excellent recipe! I love how easy it is and everyone loved it. I was a little nervous about the mayo but it was excellent and the frozen vegetables (peas and carrots) still had some snap, which my family loves.

This turned out quite well. I did make some modifications & lessened the servings to 4. I hate mayo so I used cream of mushroom soup w/ 1/2 cup milk. Also broccoli, cauliflower, & carrots for the veggie, & poultry seasoning. The stuffing was home made, and the potatoes were garlic mashed. It was very tasty. I’d definitely make this again.

This is a tasty recipe for leftover turkey. I didn't have Stove Top turkey dressing but did have Stove Top chicken dressing, I didn't have enough turkey leftover so I combined leftover baked ham with the turkey to make the required amount needed. I used instant mash potatoes as that was all I had on hand. A little sage and thyme was added as well. In all this dish came out a winner and was easy and quick to make.

When my elderly mother cleans her plate, I know that a meal is a "keeper". I made this last night and even my sister went back for thirds.  I used leftover stuffing. I used leftover peas and creamed onions from Thanksgiving dinner instead of frozen mixed veggies. Because the creamed onions had a bit of cream, I used only about 1/4 cup of mayo. I folded in some leftover whipped turnips into the mashed potatoes. Just a note: if your potatoes are a bit dry, just add a bit of milk. Because my mom loves gravy on everything, I heated up some leftover gravy for her, but it is absolutely delish without it. What a fab meal and what a great way to clean out all the leftovers from the refrigerator! I will definitely make this again next year.

This was an excellent idea! I used a blend of veggies I had on hand, leftover turkey, vegetable stock (instead of chicken broth), and Kabocha squash (instead of mashed potatoes) for the top. I left out the cheese and mayo for the special diets in my family and it was still moist and delicious!

This recipe is amazing! I was skeptical- I'll admit it. The first year I made it for my son & his friend & they loved it. Last year, I made it for my hubby, son & myself & my hubby loved it too! My son & hubby are picky eaters so it said a lot when they liked it as much as they did. I look forward to it every year now!

Made it. So incredibly easy. Used 2 packs of Idaho instant potatoes. Made stuffing from scratch with a leftover bag of herbed bread cubes, butter, olive oil, onions, celery and poultry seasonings. I had frozen some turkey stock from boiling the bones for soup but added chicken stock to make the stuffing moist. That's it. Will make this again. Probably every time I ever make a whole turkey!!  Awesome! Mahalo!!!

This is an outstanding recipe!  My husband loves twice-baked potatoes, so I added a cup of sour cream to the potato mix.  I also substituted the mayo with a can of cream of mushroom soup.  Yummy!  I'll definitely make this again!

This was very good. I had leftover stuffing which I used but didn't know what quantity was the equivalent of a boxed mix. As a result, I didn't use enough stuffing which would have made it even better. I should have used a solid one inch base packed down. Four stars was for the mayo. The dish was good and the family liked it but I didn't care for the obvious mayo taste. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will sub cream of mushroom, celery or chicken instead of  mayo.

I pretty much changed everything except the turkey, veggies and stuffing. Replaced mayo with mushroom gravy and turkey broth. Used savory herb stove top stuffing and sweet potatoes. Also not one for measurements lol. Either way it was great ti use leftovers, observe health and not have to cook again the next night!

This was a very good use of a lot of leftovers.  I used leftover turkey, vegetables, mashed potatoes and stuffing.  I am glad I made some gravy to put over the top of it because I tried it alone first and thought it needed something.  I also made cranberry sauce as a side.

I would recommend using Real Mayo instead of Miracle Whip. I used Miracle Whip and it was just little too sweet for me. I still liked it but I plan on tweaking a few things next time.

Easy and pretty good, but it was lacking the "wow" factor my family was hoping for.  I would make this again, but maybe jazz it up a little more with fresh herbs.

This was pretty good! It's a convenient way to use up your leftovers in one dish. I used light mayo and low fat cheese and the dish turned out very flavorful. This was gobbled up very quickly too, so no leftover leftovers. ;)

My guest loved it and my husband liked it. I used my leftover broccoli and mushrooms for the vegetable. I like how versatile this recipe can be.I will use this recipe again.

We LOVED this! I made as directed except for the veggies. We had green beans for thanksgiving with onion and bacon So I used that instead of the mixed veggies. My boyfriend even suggested that we make that again without waiting for Thanksgiving next year.

We loved this recipe. My stuffing was made up of half sausage with Quinoa and half stuffing. I'm challenged when it comes to serving vegetables so I used family approved corn and string beans instead. It was delicious right out of the over but it was even better the day after as it firmed up which made it easier to serve.

This is like Thanksgiving shepherds pie! Really tasty and a great,  quick way to bring your family the traditional holiday flavors any time of year! I used my own leftover stuffing but that was the only change I made and im sure stove top would be great too.  I also made the casserole into individual serving dishes and they turned out beautiful!!

Super easy to make and will feed a family. We liked this though I think it was a bit bland and could of used some Turkey gravy mixed in with the meat. It was good and it makes good use of some leftovers.

This was good.  I used a can of sweet corn and a can of green beans instead of the frozen veggies and served it topped with leftover gravy.  An easy meal for Thanksgiving leftovers.

I have to give this 5 stars because my family absolutely devoured it and wanted more. I added more shredded cheese on the top 15 minutes before the end of cooking time and served with some cranberry sauce on the side. I agree with other reviewers that say this is a wonderful base recipe and can be tweaked to a family's particular likes. I will definitely make this again. I think it is a great dish to take to Autumn gatherings.

I can't believe how much we enjoyed this. The only vegetable we used was corn and we subbed the miracle whip for mayo. Otherwise, I kept it the same. Great way to use up leftovers, very convenient dish before work tonight!

Very moist and full of flavor. It was extremely easy to make. This recipe doesn't call for seasonings because your using leftovers. If you make without leftovers, season to taste.

I really expected to like this casserole better than I did, but it just didn't do anything for me. Perhaps it was the Stove Top Stuffing. I'm a Southern girl, and boxed stuffing just isn't my thing.

Nice way to use up leftovers.  Can improvise with chicken, corn, and many other things.  The kids lived it also.

We LOVED this casserole! Super simple to throw together, and so delicious. I made extra gravy for the top, but it really didn't need it. I used chicken b/c that's what I had on hand and light mayo. I baked this in a round casserole dish, b/c a 13x9 seemed like it would be too big to get nice layering. This is a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This didn't really work for us.  I think it was doomed from the start because the ingredients didn't really come together.  Sorry, Kraft!  I gave it a really good try.
