We visit Jamaica once a year, but that isn't enough to get our fill of the awesome jerk chicken we eat in Negril.  I found this recipe and decided to try it based on the reviews.  I used Habenero pepper instead of the jalapeno, dried Thyme instead of fresh (1/2 recipe calls for since it was dry), added about six cloves of garlic, and one kiwi.  It is very much like the chicken at DeBuss in Negril, but not as spicy.  We then used the leftover mix (you'll have tons leftover you can freeze for later) on some Halibut that remained frozen, then defrosted for three days in the fridge.  The flavor was very different on the Halibut; not nearly as spicy and more of an Oriental flavor (probably the soy sauce really sinking in the fish), but yummy still -just in a different way.  This is a very easy rub to prepare, and it worked great under the broiler and on the grill.

I cannot reiterate enough.  This is the most delicious chicken I have ever tasted.  If you use habanero peppers instead of jalapeños, it's ridiculously hot.   What I do is I cook it in the Oven On broil on HI heat.  Turning each chicken when done on one side and consistently keep the sauce on top of the chicken.  Then I cook brown rice, and use the left over sauce on the rice.  IT IS AMAZING.

Wow!!  Awesome!  If I could only quote my husband and my guests...."unbelievable", "awesome", "sooo tender", "great kick to it", etc.  I marinated boneless breasts for about 6 hours.  I did make a couple of changes...added 3 cloves crushed garlic, two or three tablespoons lemon juice, a good dash of black pepper, used dried thyme, and reduced to 3 green onions.  I used Wildtree Herb's* Roasted Garlic Grapeseed Oil instead of Veg. Oil.  Next time, I'll add more jalepenos I think.  I can't wait to make it again!

*I'm a big fan of Wildtree Herbs' products...no preservatives, MSG or questionable ingredients.  I don't know where they're available around the country, but their website is www.wildtreeherbs.com

This was a delicous recipe. I've been to Jamaica and the flavors of this recipe took me back. I used a Jalapeno pepper and the chicken was not too spicy. For those of you that love heat, you may want to go with a Habenoro pepper.

Very nice recipe, that I've made twice now.  I did omit the green onion the second time as I found the recipe a bit strong in the onion flavor, but I did add several cloves of garlic!  Really excellent.  After removing the chicken from the marinade, I brought the remaining marinade to a slow boil on the stove top and then spooned it over basmati rice and served it all with grilled zucchini!  Really fabulous!

This was ok but not great.  I will admit though that it may be my fault that this didn't taste to my liking as I let the chicken marinate 2 days.  All I could taste was soy sauce and green onions.  My husband liked it.  We don't have a grill so I baked it in the oven.  I'll try this again but not marinate for so long.

Very good! As previously suggested, I brought some of the marinade to a slow boil and served the marinade over rice.  Along with mango salsa, it created a great summer menu.

Considering thhe time spent making the marinade, I found the end result sort of mediorce. Sorry, but we probably won't be making this one again anytime soon. All you could really taste was the soy sauce and it overwhelmed everything else. Jazzy.

This was a great recipe!  Those looking for more 'kick' should substitute a habanero pepper for the jalapeno.....and then watch out!  I also added a couple cloves of minced garlic, and sliced the chicken into strips to serve over rice.

First attempt at Jerk chicken and fabulous results !!  I added about six cloves of garlic and used two jalapeno peppers (my girlfriend and I like heat in our food). I broiled the chicken for about 10 minutes per side on the second lowest rack of my oven. The chicken was cooked to perfection and was very juicy and flavorful.   During preparation I realized that I would have some left over marinade so I saved some for later use.  A few minutes before the chicken was done I stir fried some shrimps in a skillet with butter, garlic and hot pepper flakes. About 2 min into the cooking I added 3 tablespoon of the left over marinate to the skillet (enough to coat the shrimps) and cooked until done, stirring often. The sugar in the marinade caramelized over the shrimps and added a fantastic complementary flavor (and some heat!). Chicken and seafood is one of my favorite combo and I`m very glad that I found this recipe and can`t  wait to try it with other seafood (I think that it would be awesome with scallops).  Many thanks !!

I just finished BBQing chicken wings and thighs after marinating in this recipe for 24 hours. I used oak briquettes, and bathed the neighborhood in the smoke. UNBELIEVABLEY delicious end result. My only change was the addition of 3 crushed garlic cloves, and one can of beer (which I drank while BBQing). Top drawer for this recipe!!

If you are looking for a flavorful marinade for chicken, this is it.  If you are looking for 'true' jerk, this is not it, but do try it anyway -- it's great!  Even done under the broiler, boneless, skinless chicken came out moist.  Next time I'll decrease the soy sauce a bit and try a hotter pepper (the traditional Scotch bonnet perhaps), but overall this recipe is a keeper.  Served with Authentic Bahamian Peas and Rice and hard-dough bread... all that was missing was ginger beer or a Red Stripe.  Thanks!

I read the reviews on this before this started. I still went by the recipe and loved it!! No, I've never been to Jamaica and couldn't speak intelligently on what they do there when they cook. However, if I changed the recipe on my own and then judged, I certainly wouldn't leave a comment on that. The recipe is great!! Whether it's true Jamaicain or not, I don't give a flyin happy rat's a... patootie. Really? No, I judge on the recipe presented. And  Kibada22, it freakin rocks!! Way to go!! Me and my family loved it!! Disregard the comments of the dopes who think they know how to improve and then judge you on their mistakes. That boggles my mind how people could be so rude. From my point of view, you nailed it!!

I loved the flavor of this dish.  It was my first time making anything Jamaican and it turned out great and full of flavor.  I used extra jalapeno for added spiciness, but may add more next time or use a habanero pepper instead.  I marinated the chicken overnight and cooked it at 350° for 30 minutes.

We loved this and ate it all up!  More than 5 stars if I could!  Substitutions I made:  1/4t Onion Powder for Onion, 1/4t chives for green onion and 1/4t Hot Sauce for Jalapegno. I used what I had on hand instead of going out to buy jalapegno, and green onions.   Everything else I did exact.  I mixed everything in my Magic Bullet (easy cleanup)!  Let it marinade from 10am till 7pm.  prepared White rice and corn on the cob and homemade rolls.  Served dinner and my husband said this was phenomenol!  I served the chicken on the bed of white rice.  Poured the heated marinade across it.  Reg. the rolls; Belles Hamburger Buns recipe from this site, the buns came out like yummy dinner rolls.  This dinner looked high end and totally fabulous and then tasted even more amazing. Thank you for posting this!

This did not taste like authentic carribean jerk, it tasted more like the not so tasty botttled stuff they sell at the grocery store.  I'm a pretty good cook, i gasped when i saw the amount of soy sauce it called for but didn't trust my gut. Not great.

This is very similar to the recipe I use (although heavy on vinegar, soy, and oil). But you REALLY need to use habaneros (or scotch bonnet peppers, if you can find them). I use 3-4. Carefully scrape out ALL the seeds and membranes and the heat will be moderate, leaving the fruitiness of the pepper, which you don't get from jalepenos.

I loved this marinade- so flavorful and bright- will make again.  I used serrano peppers instead of the jalapenos- next time I will use two instead of the one, and I am kind of a sissy when it comes to spice!

This marinade is right on the money, but because I like my jerk spicy, I used 2 Habaneros instead of the one jalapeno.  Don't forget to use gloves when mincing!

This is a good jerk recipe but I agree with some other reviews that the consistency could be thicker so I may simmer and add some cornstarch the next time to thicken. I also substituted habernero peppers which definitely gave it a spicier kick than jalepenos.

Fantastic and easy!  I didn't have a jalapeno on hand but substitued dried Cayanne Pepper in it's place.  Glad I did - it had a nice kick (used about 2 tsp in the recipe)...don't know if the Jalapano would have enough kick for my taste.  Also, I used 10 green onions too - came out great - everyone at the party loved it!  Wonderful with Grilled Pinapple and Mango salsa recipe on Allrecipes.  Enjoy!

I prepared this dish for my husband who loves Jamaican Jerk Chicken. It did not come out so great. I fare pretty well in the kitchen but this was NOTHING like what we experience when we visited Jamaica. The marinade was not hot and spicy and soooo WET! After marinating for 2 FULL days it had a mild kick. I did use Jalapeno peppers (with seeds, understanding that is where the heat is). This dish did NOT come out as expected. I was disappointed! I don't think I'll be trying this recipe again BUT if I do I'll try the habanero peppers and maybe reduce some of the liquids.

I honeymooned in Jamaica 5 years ago, and my heart (and tummy, after I finished dinner) smiled so big while eating this meal b/c I was flooded w/ fond beach memories. This marinade recipe will forever replace any generic Jerk seasoning mixes or sauces in my cooking. My only suggestion is to either scale the recipe back if using 1.5 lbs chicken, or marinate additional chicken, as it makes alot. I ended up refrigerating about 1/2 of the marinade to use on chicken (or maybe pork chops?) later this week when I need to bring some more Jamaican wonderfulness into my kitchen again. I served it w/ tostones (recipe from here -- another winner) and coconut rice. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I've made this recipe many times, always with success.  The last time, I pounded boneless, skinless chicken breasts, marinated and cooked on the stove using my grill pan.  Oh were they good!  Like some previous reviewers mentioned, I always throw in a garlic clove.  Sometimes I add a little ginger to the marinade.  It is pretty forgiving and I like that.

my family loved this chicken. It was not too dry and had just enough kick to make it tasty, but not to hot. Thanks for the recipe!

This. is. phenomenal!  I'm getting ready to throw a "Caribbean themed" birthday party and needed a chicken recipe for a crowd.  We ran a test run of this recipe tonight to see how it tasted.  My experience with my husband's grilling "technique" of boneless skinless breasts is that we get sawdust breasts.  We went with bone in, skin on thighs to start just to see what the flavor would be. The grilling presents a problem because the skins start fires. To avoid fires, we marinated the thighs from morning until night and did not change the marinade at all, perfect as is.  We removed the chicken from the marinade and baked the thighs at 400 degrees for 25 minutes on one side, turning halfway to 20 minutes on the other side.  Meanwhile, we reduced the remaining marinade in a sauce pan to use as a mop when the chicken was being grilled for caramelizing and grill marks.  The grill was pre-heated to 300F.  We took the cooked thighs from the oven and placed them on the grill, skin side down first and mopped them with the reduced marinade and grilled for 5-7 minutes, then flipped them, mopped again and grilled for another 5-7 minutes just to get a good caramelizing on the outside for a total of about 14-15 minutes. We poured some of the reduced marinade over the finished product for moisture (just in case). This produced a very moist, tender, FLAVORFUL chicken thigh. We are going to do breasts and thighs for the party, this was PERFECT. Not too hot, or sweet, just perfect!

I changed the recipe a little. I switched the amount of soy sauce and vinegar. So I used 3/4 vinegar and 1/2 c low sodium soy and  added  8 cloves of garlic, Tablespoon of pepper and salt. the reduction of soy sauce helps get rid of the that bottled jerk marinade taste. I made this recipe twice once in the oven and once grilled with wood chips. I think grilling  really helps with that "authentic" jerk taste. Regardless if you cook in the oven or on a grill be sure to reserve some marinade and brush periodically throughout the cooking process it definitely helps with flavor.

This recipe makes a great sauce. I used 2 habanero instead of one jalapeno, we like things spicy.  I marinated chicken breasts and pork chops overnight, then grilled.  The meat itself did not have as much flavor as I would have liked.  I saved the marinade and reduced it on the stove for about 20-30 minutes.  Then I served the sauce with the meat, that's why I gave the 5 star rating, the sauce was fabulous.  I couldn't get enough.  I will be making this again for sure, next time I plan to make jerk chicken pizza. Yum I can't wait.

Omit the soy and use white wine or Bragg's amino acids. Omit green onions as white or yellow onions are quite enough. Add scotch bonnet peppers versus the jalapenos as they are not authentic to jerk chicken. Remove the seeds the peppers of you do not like it so hot. Add ginger and this recipe is complete!

This was delicious! I only made 2 chicken breasts, and I wish I'd made more! I used less than 1/2 a jalepeno, and again, wish I'd used more. This is SOOOO good. We have a wonderful Jamaican restaurant nearby and I swear, this recipe competes!

The husband gave me a high five - what more can I say? Marinated over night. I used bone in chicken with the skin on. Grilled it outside on medium/low heat. The skin blackened up and really enhanced the flavor.

Great marinade!! My husband loves Jerk Chicken wings, so I tried this recipe. I didn't put in food processor, but did marinade it over night. I also cooked in a 350 oven for 35 minutes, give or take. I turned the chicken once and covered the chicken in the marinade and drained the excess, but kept just enough to almost braise the chicken. It was awesome. My husband was amazed and loves it! I also added a couple of small jalapenos, because we like spicier foods. Would still be great with less pepper. Will make this again!!! Thanks!

A very good recipe although I thought it could use a bit more kick.  I think next time I'll use a few habanero peppers instead of jalapenos.  I love things hot and spicey.

Everyone loved the taste of this chicken , but it was NOT hot.  Next time I will use a habanero or a few jalapenos.  Let this sit overnight in the marinade.

Overall, I was very pleased with this recipe. I really liked that the flavor of the marinade did not overpower the chicken. The only disappointment was that after adding a whole jalapeno AND a whole thai chile--It still was not hot enough! Next time I will definitely beef up the pepper. Everyone at the Memorial Day cookout yesterday loved it--is definitely a keeper.

Really good jerk chicken! I would recommend adding cayenne pepper because jalepeno peppers aren't hot as they once were.

This was a great recipe and I will definitely make it again.  I used only the green onion and the flavour was outstanding.  Next time I make it, I will include some of the jalapeno seeds to spice it up a bit more.  I can't take the heat of a scotch bonnet as some have recommended.  I don't usually rate recipes, especially if I don't follow them exactly, but this one was totally worth it.

This was made for my son's Jamaican themed 14th birthday party. I don't know how traditional this recipe is, but it made some darn fine chicken. We used all the chicken parts instead of just boneless breasts. I think the boneless breasts would be way too mushy and salty if left overnight in the marinade. My personal preference would be for more spice, but the onion flavor was perfect. We had a bunch left over, because we always make too much food at parties. It freezes extremely well and we had it again for dinner a week later. Reheated very easily.

This recipe was really good. My kids complained it was too spicy for them. But my husband and I enjoyed the heat. I did use a medium jalapeno and left the seeds in. I followed other peoples suggestion to boil the marinade down until it was thicker and used this to pour over the rice, pineapple, and black beans I had made as a side. I then cut the chicken up into bite sized pieces and place that on top of the rice mixture. The pineapple worked wonderfully to counter the spiciness of the sauce. I cooked our chicken on a George Foreman grill but I think it would be better on a regular grill to get that smokey flavor.

I got the most rave reviews with this recipe! Its truly delicious! The only thing I did different was to sub the white vinegar for balsamic (I was out of white), and reduced it to just over 1/3 cup. I was worried the balsamic would really overpower the dish but it didn't at all.  The only thing I would do different next time is to add the whole jalapeno with seeds or even two to get more spice.  I served it with a banana salsa it was delicious!

Very tasty and not too spicy!  We only had half a white onion left and no green onions, but we don't really like onions anyway and it still tasted amazing.  Not only was it fun to mix up, it was really easy!  We will definitely be making this one again!

Tasted kind of like jerk chicken, I thought, but it wasn't that great.  I won't be making it again.

I liked this recipe I was in a pinch so I tried it.  My fiance is from the West Indies he really liked it I did make a few changes such as the jalapeno I used a scotch bonnet pepper much hotter.  I also added 3 cloves of garlic.  I marinade the chicken for two days then grill.  I serve with rice and peas and steamed cabbage.  Oh great with fish and pork.

I definately thought that the clove was out of place. I would not recommend adding it at all. I also agree with other reviewers that it was not spicy at all. I even have a weak mouth. But I guess nothing quite beats the jerk chicken that I had in Jamaica!!! The best thing about this chicken was that my husband made dinner tonight!

Good stuff, wear gloves when you cut the jalepeno's.

Everyone enjoyed it, chicken was very juicy.

Not a big hit w/my family (and they love just about any kind of grilled chicken!). Maybe it was the funky color of the marinade (greenish-brown).

This recipe was very easy and delicious.  I served it with fresh Mango salsa and it offset the soy sauce in the chicken wonderfully.  I will definitely make this one again.

I marinated this overnight and broiled it 10 minutes per side instead of grilling. I really don't mind the marinate but this definitely is not the typical jerk taste. The seasonings reminded me of adobo. I would definitely use a dry rub if you wanted a more authentic taste of jerk chicken

This was excellent! I made it exactly as written and the flavor was wonderfull. I does deserve 5 stars but next time I think I will use a scotch bonnet pepper for a bit more heat. Try it....you won't be disappointed.

To make it really amazing use pimento wood in your grill - smoke flavor is the key. Easy to find on line just google pimento wood

I loved this recipe.  The chicken came out flavorful right down to the bone.  I did not have any jalapenos so I just used my fav hot sauce.  Also I have a habit of prep-ing my meat with salt and pepper but just remember the soy sauce has lots of salt so just be careful with adding additional salt!!!!

This is a great recipe.  I added some habaneros for a little more kick and increased authenticity.  I split the marinade into 3 ziplock bags and froze them for future use.  Reserve some marinade before adding your chicken to brush on during cooking.

I made this for my family and they LOVED it!  The changes I made were: no jalapeno pepper, I used chicken breasts, thighs and wings, and after marinating over night I cooked them for one hour covered at 375 and then uncovered, put more marinade on and broiled them on high until they started to blacken.

I loved this!  I used pork instead of chicken and added a couple minced garlic cloves. I found it a little salty so will use reduced sodium soy sauce the next time, but otherwise this was delicious!

Outstanding. This is as good or better than any of the jerk I've eaten in Carribean restaurants. I followed the recipe exactly, marinating for closer to 24 hours. I boiled the extra marinade for ~15 minutes and it reduced into a flavorful, spicy jerk sauce. I did keep the jalepeno seeds and ribs in. I will absolutely keep this in my rotation, thanks so much for sharing.

Wow, that's a keeper! Have made it twice now, first time as written, second time had to substitute the jalapeno with cayenne pepper (grocery store has poor selection). Very versatile, since it still tasted fantastic. Thank you for submitting this one. A batch is marinating as we speak :-)

a little on the disappointing side. Not as good as the reviews went on about. Had a recipe party with 16 people and i couldnt wait for them to try this recipe. Not a single person commented or asked for the recipe.

My husband and I went to Jamiaca in July for our honeymoon and loved the jerk  chicken...I thought I would try  this one out and it turned out really good. I would have liked a little more heat to mine, so I think the next time I make it, I will leave the seeds in the jalapeno...

Not bad.... As prescribed by other reviewers, I used a kiwi and 5 cloves of garlic, it came out quite good!  Only thing, 1 Jalapeno is not spicy at all if you really like spicy food....Nex time I'll try a habanero and maybe add 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne.

Anything less than 5 stars would not be fair, since I didn't follow all the instructions... The way I did it was only 3-4 stars.  I mixed the marinade ingredients in the blender and then poured over chicken legs in the crockpot.  I slow cooked them for about 6 hours while I was at work, then put them in the oven to get them crispy.  It wasn't very flavorful, most likely because I didn't have everything on hand :( I only had about 1/4 cup of soy sauce, and no onions but I did use onion powder.  I probably will not try it again, because my family didn't like the mix of seasonings.  But I think some people just don't like jerk seasoning to begin with, even if I did do it right!

I can't say how it compares to real jerk chicken, but for a spiced chicken it was definitely fantastic.  I didn't blend it so I had chopped onions inside, which I also grilled on a pan and they tasted great with the chicken. I used Chipotle Cayenne pepper instead of jalapeno. I halved the recipe, but used a little less chicken so it was swimming in the marinade. It was really juicy and delicious that way though.  Note: if you're using whole cloves instead of ground, only use one. Mine got a little strong when I used two...

I was really excited to try this, but it lacked flavor, in my opinion. Maybe I didn't get to marinade the chicken long enough? Oh well. Probably won't try this one again. Thanks.

This is a fantastic recipie!  We like a bit more heat so we add the seeds of the Jalapeno to bring it up a bit.  We also like to reserve some of the marinade to use as a sauce for dipping in.  Thanks for this YUMMY Jerk recipie!

This was such an incredible dish! When I blended the marinade I dipped my finger in it and had a taste... I was over the moon! I could not believe that such a simple recipe could have so much flavour. This is going in my favorites.

After blending, I thought I wanted more flavor profiles, so I doubled the spices and thought it was wonderful! I did not have jalapeno, so I used a combination of crushed red pepper flakes and Louisiana Hot Sauce to taste (maybe 1/2 t flakes and 1/2 t sauce). I marinated for 6 hours, but I bet overnight would be even better. I had a 3 lb bag of Tyson individually frozen chicken breasts (8 in total) and used the marinade for all of them. Hubby grilled all of them and I now have leftover chicken for WONDERFUL grilled chicken salads during this next week. Thanks!

Wow. This recipe is AWESOME!!!! I followed the recipe exactly, but I only had 2 1/2 hours to marinade the chicken. I cut the chicken breast halves in half. This seemed to add more flavor. I grilled the chicken (on high) for about 12 minutes. The chicken was so juicy and the flavor was unbelievable! My fiance never had anything jerk before, and he said this is now his favorite meal. Thank you very much for sharing - we're going to make it again next week :)

This is my family's favorite grilled chicken recipe.  Our only changes: use whole chicken (remove the backbone, butterfly and grill inside down), brush heavily with the marinade and sub a couple of habeneros for the jalapeno.

Good, basic chicken, but I was expecting something much spicier. Next time I'll look for a recipe that calls for the real thing: habanero chiles.

We really liked this recipe a lot !!  We did substitute habanero for jalapeno .... we also kept the extra marinade to brush on as the chicken grilled.   We like this so much, we made a double batch so that we can cook more during the week !!   We're trying it with with a pork tenderloin tonight.  

Thank you for sharing !!  We will use this quite a bit this summer, I'm sure.

I can't say enough about this recipe.  It is delicious.  I make it exactly as the recipe is written, only occasionally using dried thyme, which is still good.  The first few times, I used lower-sodium soy sauce, because that's what I always have on hand.  Once I made it with regular soy sauce and will never go back.  The extra sodium is worth it; the flavor is superb.  This is my favorite thing to grill during the summer.  So yummy!

This was excellent.  Not exactly what I was thinking of when I think of jerk chicken, but still amazing.  My family couldn't stop talking about how great it was and my son said it was the best chicken he's ever had.  Served with rice and cuban style black beans.  Will definitely be making this again, probably adding garlic and more peppers for some added spice.

I usually think jerk is too sweet but this was just right.  The chef added a generous sprinkle of white pepper and paprika to the marinade.  The chicken browned nicely too.

Great marinade. Easy to prepare with delicious results. I like adding more spice to mine with both hotter peppers and more cloves/all spice.

It was rather time-consuming to prepare the marinade, and I expected to get amazing flavor in return.  However, it tasted just OK, not very special for all the work.

This was a good chicken recipe. Something different from barbecue or teriyaki chicken. My kids liked it and my husband especially enjoyed it. My stepfather did not like it, but he dislikes onions and this recipe is loaded with onions. I recommend the recipe, and definitely will make this again. BTW- I made kabobs with this recipe.

This recipe is awesome!  I marinated for a full 24 hours with one habanero.  WOW!  I sliced it after grilling and put it in a tortilla with a little cheese and habanero hot sauce!  YUM!  If you decide to use a habanero, wear gloves as this stuff can really burn your skin.

Great flavor!  I added 2 jalapenos, and it still wasn't spicy enough.  Next time I'll try a habanero.

My man and I only had some chicken legs
in the freezer. So we took those and marinated 
for about 24 hours. It tasted great! I can
whole hartedly recomend this recipe. 
We had it with some left over pasta sallad
with fried bacon... but I am sure it will
be even better with rice or cous-cous. Enjoy!

I used this recipe last nite to marinate chicken for kabobs.  I cut the chicken up in small pieces and marinated overnight. I used it on kabobs with red peppers, mushrooms, and pearl onions and served them over rice.  Boy did everyone love them.  Great recipe.

I thought this was wonderful.  I was worried about it being too spicy so I used a very small pepper and now realize I should have used a much bigger one.  It wasn't spicy at all, but it was absolutely delicious!  I served it with brown rice and black beans.  My husband had seconds and packed up the rest for the following day.

Made this recipe for my moms carribbean themed birthday party. I change the servings from 4 to 40 I think it was a bit off it called for what seemed to me too much green and white onion so I added to my liking. Everything else I followed to the T except I didn't remove the seeds from my chili (we like our food spicy) I let the chicken marinade over night and BBQ it early morning. The party wasn't till 7:00 in the evening so the chicken was made 12 hours ahead of time. I put the chicken in a chafing dish and it warmed up nicely. Everyone absolutely loved it!!! I got so many compliments! I'm making it again tomorrow night, can't wait to eat it right off the grill I bet it will be so much better.

Instead of jalapeños, I used ghost peppers, the store was out of habanero. It was spicy but I like it spicy. I used the extra marinade as a sauce. Without the extra sauce, it just tasted like bland chicken. I also used chicken thigh versus chicken breast. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I perused a lot of jerk chicken recipes before deciding to go with this one & I made the right choice!!!  This has been absolutely outstanding & it is my go-to jerk marinade recipe--I've already shared it with several other cook-friends of mine.  The few times that my chicken didn't come out so well were soley my fault.  Now, I believe I have it down to a science: (1) I marinate for at least 5 days; (2) I ALWAYS use chicken thighs (you can't beat the juiciness and flavor on the grill & trust me, I'm a chicken breast guy (btw, I know thigh-leg quarters are traditional, but I don't like the sinewiness of drumsticks); (3) if you can take the heat, always use something hotter than jalapenos such as habaneros, which gives you something closer to the authentic scotch bonnet flavor (besides, the heat always dissipates over time, so don't be shocked that the chicken is much milder the next day or afterwards.  There are several peppers hotter than jalapenos [serranos, manzanos, etc.], and I encourage you to experiment with several to find the flavor you want); (4) sear the chicken directly over the heat source for 2-3 minutes each side (again, use thighs for max flavor), then move to the "cool" side of the grill for the next 45-50 minutes, cooking with the lid down.  The end result is a chicken thigh that is cooked thoroughly through without having burned the exterior and the jerk flavor that we all love is penetrated all the way to the bone.  Absolutely delicious!!!  Thanks, Jay!!!

If you like it really spicy, use the habañero. One jalapeño was pretty mild. I marinated it 24hrs and it was juicy-tasty on skeewers with Jamaican rice and grilled veggies.

Love, Love this recipe!! I used all green onions since I had plenty of them. I didn't have a fresh jalapeno so I chopped some pickled jalapenos instead. The only other change I made was adding minced garlic. Can't have to much of that! I used my magic bullet blender for this so it didn't take any time at all to mix it up. I was only able to marinate this for two hours and it was still full of flavor! I also heated the leftover marinade on the stovetop and poured it over the chicken after it was grilled. Yummy! FYI: Next time, I will mix an extra serving of the dry ingrediants and sprinkle it on the chicken as I grill it like they do at Bahama Breeze :o)

After reading all of the reviews, I was sure that I would have a party in my mouth as well. The flavor was fresh and different which was neat; however, the chicken was very dry. I am not sure to as why my the sauce would not crisp either and I set mine out over night for a more intense flavor. I am sure this turned out better for others than for me since I am still an amateur at all this. Sadly, I do not think I will make this again.

With all the great reviews, I had high hopes for this recipe.  Followed all directions, added a couple cloves of garlic and a kiwi, let marinate for 6 hours then grill.  Not impressed.  Tasted like salty chicken with some strange flavor I couldn't pinpoint.  Hubby wasn't impressed, either.  Not horrible, but this won't make it into my recipe book.

I followed this to the letter aside from replacing the vegetable oil with olive oil, and I can say that this doesn't taste at all like real Jerk Chicken. It is quite good, however and my husband says we need to make it again. If you're looking for a yummy grilling marinade, this is a good choice but look elsewhere if you want real Carribean-esque Jerk.

I was really disappointed. This tasted just ok, but didn't look or taste anything like the jerk chicken I had at Sandals in Jamaica.  I've tried several different recipes and even pre-mix jerk, but I just can't find it.  This recipe was definitely missing something.  I won't make this again.

This came out extremely salty. I think it was the soy sauce in the marinade.

I would add more than 1 chili pepper or even make it/them a habanero(s) if you want to give this a little kick.  I also added a handful of cilantro to the food processor step, which added some depth.  Maybe black pepper, as well.  Great taste... just a little on the sweet side and needs a little punch.

Like others say, this really isn't very spicy, but it is still very tasty. I marinated them overnight and you could taste the flavour throughout the chicken. Next time I may add another jalapeno for some additional spice.

Delicious, moist chicken with a wonderful flavour. I made this on the stovetop in a pan at high heat instead of grilling and will make this again (and again).

This was good. Next time, I will use half the mixture to marinate and cook the other half down into a sauce. Then I will shred the chicken and serve it with the sauce on a bed of rice.

I loved this recipe. I made it as the recipe suggested but added some minced garlic and 2 tablespoons of lime juice with it and it was fantastic. I will however use habanero peppers next time because I think it could be a little spicier (if you are one of those like me that likes it HOT!). The jalapenos gave it a nice mild flavor though. I also boiled some of the remainder marinade and used that to pour over the rice I made. GREAT!!!! LOVED IT! I will certainly make this again and again.

Great, this chicken was full of flavour!  I cut in half for just the 2 of us, but still added a full jalapeno.  Kept all else as called for and marinaded for probably 6 hours or so.  This was definitley not spicy at all (despite doubling the jalapeno), but had super flavour...savoury/sweet, very yummy!  Might try adding some habanero next time as I have them growing in my garden, we love spicy!

Wow, I'm not much of a chicken fan, but I must say this is one of my favorite chicken dishes now! There are two things I changed, instead of veggie oil, I used Extra virgin olive oil, and I thought it needed a bit more heat...I like things a little more spicy, so I will try leaving the ribs on the jalapeno next time I make this dish. Thank you so much for sharing! Oh and the longer you marinade, the more flavorful...the better!

This was allright. It certainly makes for a quick meal. Another plus? You don't need to heat up your oven to make this, which is a good thing since my A/C is broke and won't be repaired until tomorrow at the earliest!!! As KIBADA22 suggested, I added several cloves of minced garlic and one kiwi (peeled & sliced) to my marinade. I also subbed two small (seeded) habanero pepeprs for the jalapeno called for. These modifications were CRITICAL to the overall outcome, especially my decision to substitute habaneros for a jalapeno (IMHO). My only real complaint was that my chicken breasts were a tad dry. I see (from the pictures posted) that many reviewers used chicken parts. That may produce moister chicken, so I'd definitely recommend that to anyone concerned about this being an issue. Served with a side of Goya yellow rice (to which I added a can of rinsed / drained black beans) and grilled pineapple, this was a decent meal. I think I might like this better as a sandwich and will prepare it that way if I ever make this again (slathered with cajun mayo and topped with a grilled pineaplle ring!). Sweet potato chips would be the pefect accompainment! Thanks for sharing! :-)

I made this for a pirate-themed party and it was a big hit. I modified the recipe for 30 people, so I changed the amount of jalapeno peppers and added 2 banana peppers. I marinated boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into the size of chicken strips. They were marinated for 20 hours. Some guests thought it was beef because of the color the soy sauce gave. Also, I am not a chicken eater, but it was the most tender and flavorful chicken I have ever eaten. I read somewhere in these reviews that we can freeze the marinade - I will do that and serve this chicken dish again and again! Thanks KIBADA22 for making me look good.

Pretty good. I've never had jerk chicken and this was a pleasant intro (if its even authentic...lol). I wish I wouldn't have moved my chicken so much because some of the marinade chunks fell off and I think that would have made it better. Next time i'll try habanero because even using 2 full jalapenos we didnt' really get much heat.

This served as a really good base recipe. I added some left over slices of yellow onion I had on hand, and reduced the green onions to only 1 large one I had. I also added about 2 cloves of garlic and some grated ginger. After tasting I thought it needed more sweetness so I added an additional teaspoon or so of brown sugar, and it was not spicy enough so I added some chili paste. After it came off of the grill I sprinkled it with some chopped cilantro from the garden and I served it with a rice pilaf that had some cilantro and a similar spice profile to the ones in the chicken. Great inspiration, thanks for the recipe.

I haven't tried this yet but am planning on it tonight.  I rated 5 stars cuz the ingredients look wonderful.  It smelled awesome when I threw it together as well.  I have 2 cornish game hens marinating in it right now and plan on cooking them in my rotissere rather than on my grill.  I'll update everyone when I find out how they work cooked that way.  Wish me luck!

The flavor was nice but it was almost like the recipe was missing something mabe a little more brown sugar..and I think I definitely should have used the habenera pepper instead. Instead of me grilling and using chicken breast I opted to use chicken wings and drummetts and baked the chicken on 350 degrees for about 1hr and ten minutes.

I toggled between a 3 and 4 because although this is a great marinade, it wasn't enough "jerk" style for me.  Maybe all I need to do is add some more peppers, I'm not sure.  I tend to like my jerk more of a rub style which this isn't but despite my complaints, I think this is a great every day marinade.  Just not jerk enough for me.

This was a hit! I made wings using this recipe. Downsized the soy sauce a bit. The only thing I would change next time is to use more habanero pepper. This was not spicy enough for us, but had a good flavor.

I thought this recipe was about a 4.5, but I'm giving it 5 stars because I was missing a few ingredients, in all fairness. I had to use lemon juice instead of vinegar, and I had no green onion or jalapeno. I tripled the spices and still felt that it needed more. I think that having so much liquid - 1.5 cups - washes the spices off the chicken as opposed to having a thicker paste or dry rub of the spices. That aside, this recipe made for great chicken thighs on a cast iron grill pan. Flavorful and juicy!

Love, love, love this marinade.  Add and subtract ingredients depending on availability in the pantry.  Always turns out great.

This recipe was easy to follow and I was a bit worried because I had never tasted/cooked Jerk chicken before but everything came out great!! All the spices and flavors really blended together well and it was just delicious. I froze some of the marinade for later and I will be definetely cooking this again.

Absolutely wonderful.  The habanero is a must. I buy chicken breast (bone-in) and individually freeze them in the marinade.  Then I just pull out how many I'll need in the morning.

Fantastic!  We eat a lot of grilled chicken at our house.  Even so, my husband said this was the best marinated chicken he's ever tasted - this from a man who doesn't even like green onions!  After reading previous reviews, I went with 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce, 2 jalapeno peppers, and added 2 cloves of garlic.  My family was thrilled to find there is enough for leftovers tomorrow night.  I'm thinking of putting it in a green salad.

First time I made this recipe, I used half an onion, added garlic, used 1 whole jalapeno and 1 jalapeno w/ no seeds, and reduced the soy sauce to 1/2. I also baked the chicken since we didn't have a grill at the time. The aroma was amazing, but the taste wasn't very good. The cloves was just WAY too overpowering, plus it wasn't spicy at all. Made this again, minus the cloves. Also used 3 jalapenos w/ seeds, used the full amount of soy sauce and also added about 3 tbs of garlic. Marinated 3 boneless chicken breasts overnight (could've marinated a ton more b/c there was a lot of it). Grilled them, and... just man... best, juiciest chicken I've ever had. The 3 jalapenos made the spicyness perfect. Not too bad, but still had a good kick to it. Just YUMMY!

This was so delicious! I cooked it for my friends (one is a chef!), used 3 scotch bonnets. Next time will wear gloves! I accidentally touched my face. On fire for hours. I only had time to let it marinate 2 1/2 hours. Cut the breasts in half and pierced them with a knife all over. So Yummy! Paired it up with the caribbean black beans and rice recipe.

Very delicious, and I wasn't even able to grill it. I marinated it overnight. I used red pepper flakes instead of jalepeno, just used white onion, and used frozen OJ concentrate instead of brown sugar to try something different. It was a hit, with a great combination of flavors. Very salty, though, and I didn't even use all the soy. I can't wait to make it on the grill!

not authentic, but good nonetheless and when you marinade long enough it will make the chicken tender.

I omitted the jalapeno as I was cooking for the kids.  This was fantastic.  Even my supremely picky 10 yr old girl gave it two thumbs up, which is rare.

Also, this smelled wonderful while grilling.  Thanks for sharing! This will be a regular addition to our summer menu.

For me, this is one of those recipes that smells and tastes sooooo much better after being cooked. I used chives instead of green onions and had to make some very minor substitutions for a few of the spices and herbs, I also didn’t have jalapeño so I used crushed red pepper flakes.   I definitely recommend marinating for several hours and grilling instead of baking. Thanks a bunch!

This was very good and I received lots of compliments for it. However, next time, I would poke holes into the chicken or cut it thinner so it doesn't taste plain in the middle.

My boyfriend is from the caribbean I wanted to surprise him with some jerk chicken which he absolutely loves, this seasoning didn't really do it, not in the oven at least. Maybe on the grill?? Even I found it wasn't that good, I've had jerk chicken many times and this just wasn't it...don't know what would have to be modified though...

We liked this pretty well. We followed the recipe just about to the letter. We added 1 jalapeno and 1/2 of a serrano pepper--both seeded--and used a little less soy sauce. The flavor was good and got good response from our guests but we thought it wasn't quite spicy enough. I think Jerk is supposed to be pretty fiery and this just wasn't. Maybe next time we will not seed the peppers or use more serranos and/or try some habenero. We will make this again though, it turned out really good.
EDIT: Okay, I have downgraded this to 3 stars after making it twice. It is a good marinade/basting sauce for chicken but it just isn't spicy. I used a whole large Jalapeno and 3 small Serranos this time. I even left a few of the seeds in--still no heat. It seems like too much work for not enough pay-off. I am off to search for some type of dry rub...

I marinated over night, but the marinade just didn't pierce the brest halves.  It tasted like plain chicken with a yummy sauce on it, which wasn't quite what I was looking for.

I LOVED this chicken. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and I baked the chicken instead of grilling it. The chicken had a great flavor and I took the leftover to work the next day and shared it with co-workers. They all enjoyed it and I will use this recipe again.

#I tried a version of my own and this dry rub and over-nite marinade method is very good/I really prefer the chicken pieces over the Breast meat I like to thinly slice my chicken breast for coatings and fry/bake maintains the juices nicely useing chicken parts adds that savory-sloppy-juicy aspect of eating w/the hands and I like to use poultry bones for broth/stored in the freezer I haven't used CLOVES-yet but this recipe is next in line w/CLOVES/great recipe.
#Next-day/going for the ingredients on this one.
#WELL/I brought the ingredients home from the supermarket/and I really can't bring myself to use the Soy Sauce-I think it would mess the Spices up a bit/SOOooo/I'm dropping the Soy Sauce and going with everything else..I would prefer a drier-RUB to a BBQ-sauce..I'll prepare this in Cast Iron..and then maybe some oven-Baking/I got Chicken Breast(w/skin)../I'll take a picture.
#2-hours marinade time seems to get the meat flavored/the GREEN ONION is a very nice touch..15-more-minutes and I'll look at the next step(Cast Iron)/the picture shows a red colored recipe/I'm checking that step at this time.
#A very nice recipe/I made chicken-thighs(not breasts)w/bones..and I floured the parts(8-piece)/I fry'd in some oil..useing cast iron..and finished in a 350-degree[F]Oven for 50-minutes..the flour was done after frying..and placed on a rack inside a large cookie sheet.

This was delicious!  And it was easy to make.  This makes a lot of marinade, so either use lots of chicken or cut it down some (we used 5 boneless skinless chicken breast halves).  The chicken comes out really tender and has a nice complex flavor.  It wasn't spicy at all, which surprised me because we used a whole jalapeno as directed.  I will definitely make this again.

The flavor was good, but Jerk it was not.  It was not spicy at all, perhaps the suggestion to remove all the seeds from the halapeno should've been modified.  I think this recipe would've recieved a better score from me if I found it in under BBQ Chicken marinade.

Not exactly what I would call "jerk", but very tasty anyway. Very important to let it marinade for a good long time. We were in a hurry the first time we made this and it wasn't nearly as good as when we let the marinade sit.

I made this tonight and have to give it 3 stars as written.  I made only 1/2 the marinade for 1 lb. of chicken, but used one whole jalapeno, seeds and all.  It had a nice flavor, but was not all spicy. I would use more peppers, a habanero or add red pepper flakes.  I would also cut the chicken into thinner slices.  I may give this another try with modifications.

This tasted good, but not like jerk chicken.  It wasn't at all spicy and mostly tasted like soy sauce and onions. Meat was tender and flavorful (marinated overnight) but just wasn't what i was looking for.

Cannot rave enough about this one!  Couldn't grill outside so I blackened the outside of the chicken on a griddle and then baked it.  Came out crispy on the outside and tender inside.  Served it with mango/papaya salsa from this site.  Thank you so much for the awesome recipe!

My family and I enjoyed this recipe very much.  It turned out to be a forgiving recipe because I didn't have everything exactly on hand...so if you don't have exact ingredients/spices...don't let that stop you.  On the side, I served minute rice prepared according to the package directions except in place of water, I used coconut milk.  When the rice was done, I mixed in a can of small red beans.  The meal was delicious and we are looking forward to having this chicken often during our summer grilling season.

Just tried this recipe out and it is AWESOME.  Followed the ingredients, but didn't have any All Spice.  Next time might step it up to a habanero, we like it spicey.  Didn't have grill, so I broiled it, came out perfect.  Full of flavor and the chicken was VERY juicey.

This is not what I expected.  I don't think it tasted much like Jerk Chicken.  No one cared for this recipe here. Will not try again.

Yummy!  I marinated boneless pork chops in this recipe and they came out melt-in-your-mouth tender.  I substituted a 4 oz. can of diced jalapenos for the fresh, also cut the soy sauce back to 1/2 cup tne the vinegar to 1/4 cup.  It was delicious, will definitely use this recipe again!

Simply phantasmagoric!  Though I prefer to prepare this in an oven than in a grill.  I Simply marinade the chicken in an oven-tray and then bake!  Takes a while for the liquid to reduce, but once things start going brown, I'm good.

Baking this dish leaves me with sauce that I serve with the chicken -- preferably over couscous prepared with raisins... mmmmm...

This was painfully spicy and I only used half a very tiny jalapeno pepper! My poor hubby  I were dying of mouth pain!!!! I diluted the marinade w OJ and lime juice and even some white wine and even still the spiciness was unbearable! From what we coudl taste through the spiciness the overall flavor was good, so I'll make again sometime w out the jalapeno. I have had authentic Jerk Chicken in Jamaica and it was not spciy like this, but instead coated w ground black pepper and seasonings so I'll make it more authentic nexttime and see how it turns out.

Really, really good!  My chicken needed about 20 minutes under the broiler to get done in the middle though - can't wait until summer so I can try it on the grill.  We used a puny little habanero AND cut out the seeds and it was still incredibly spicy!  I added lime juice and fresh ginger and it was a nice touch.  Would also recommend doubling the marinade so that there is more sauce to drizzle over top.   Served with easy store-bought red beans and rice, this meal is a zip!

This is an excellent recipe. My husband loved it. It was very tasty- it has just the right combination of spices, I slightly modified the recipe, I added 2tablespoons of minced garlic, used only 1/2cup of  soy sauce and substituted the pepper with 2 teaspoons of hotsauce.

This was very, very flavorful! It wasn't hot at all so would have liked more "kick" to it but the blending of flavors was perfect.  I marinated for approximately 7 hours then grilled the chicken on the gas grill.  I will make this again and maybe add some garlic and habaneros.

I made this recipe for a bbq and I really enjoyed the flavor.  Although others did too, it was a flavor that they aren't very familar with.  As good as I though it was I know that the spices might not be enjoyable to others.  I thought it was easy to prepare. I did add garlic because I love adding garlic to my dishes.

I look for recipes in the five star rating category and that's how I found this one. It was scrumptious and very flavorful and indeed the chicken was tender. It is not your arverage Jerk recipe which can be overpowering it was delicious. I added garlic to the marinade and sauteed the chicken in a pan instead of broiling. I also used only half the marinade and saved the other half for maybe pork or steak later on this week as it was a lot.

Really good blend of spice. Marinade was alright. I recommend marinading overnight and not 4-6 hours as stated in recipe. I used pimento wood sticks from a place here in the states called www.pimentowoodproducts.com that sells actual pimento wood from Jamaica so I can't speak on the marinade just by itself. There are better marinades online that i have tried but this is still worth a shot if you are short on time and don't want to go crazy with the ingredient list.

This is a fantastic savory recipe!  It turns out even better when you have purest of spices. This is one for the records.

Making the marinade was a bit tedious and I was excited with the interesting mix of spices and jalepeno. I hoped it was worth it. Alas, it wasn't a hit with my family and the leftover chicken sat for days is the fridge until I begged my husband to take it for a lunch.

Excellent!  I make this with 2-4 chicken breasts and broil for 10 min on each side in the oven at 400 degrees.  I add an extra jalapeño with the seeds since I like it spicy.  I sauté one chopped onion and 2 peppers in olive oil  while the chicken is cooking and mix with the leftover marinade bring to a simmer and serve on top of basmati rice.  Yum!

This was the best jerk chicken I've ever made. I added 3 garlic cloves, 1/2 cup of pineapple orange juice and used 1/2 of a ghost pepper since that's all I had. It was so tender and juicy. Thanks!

This sauce is to die for! I left the seeds in the jalapeno pepper, and used extra-firm tofu in place of chicken (to make it vegetarian) and it was absolutely delicious. I marinated it overnight and it was spicy and flavorful -- better than the jerk tofu at our local Caribbean place. Served with Caribbean spinach soup (from this site)!

This was spectacular! Easy to make and full of flavor, but not too spicy. I did add a little crushed garlic to the marinade, and I boiled down the leftover marinade to use to baste the chicken while it grilled, which I highly recommend. The chicken came out juicy and delicious, every bit as good as any jerk chicken I've had in a restaurant.

This is probably the best marinade I have ever made. So so so good! I did what others suggested by adding 2 cloves of garlic and one extra jalapeno for hotness. We used it with chicken and grilled it. Then added sauteed mushrooms and jalapenos with melted pepperjack cheese on top. Oh my yumminess!

Ok I used this recipe b'cuz I'm currently pregnant and have a huge craving for jerk chicken and since the local negril restaurant closed I had to make my own. This recipe had lots of reviews and I thought I should try it out it was good but not the jerk chicken I was looking for. *Sigh looks like I gotta search google for an authentic Jamaican cuisine lol gotta fulfill my craving

very good taste, similar to what I've had in Jamaica.  Some say this is good on rice, I don't agree.  To each their own.  The well cooked areas of chicken with jerk were really good.

This recipe turned out to taste nothing like authentic  jerk chicken. The chicken taste alright but nothing to write home about. I don't see myself using this recipe in the future. This was way too sweet, the flavor of the onions where overwhelming and so was the soy sauce.

Tasty and tender, but definitely NOT spicy. Wasn't bad tasting, but was not what we had anticipated for jerk chicken. Still looking for a good jerk recipe.

I've used this recipe many times throughout the years and it is fabulous!  Great as is, or if you want a little more kick, substitute a habanero pepper in place of the jalapeno.  This was the first recipe I had ever used from allrecipes.com.  Loved it so much I first come to this site for my recipes.

This chicken is excellent!  I only gave it four stars because I don't think it really nailed true jerk chicken flavor.  It is still really good and I will maker it again.  I think next time I will double the allspice, nutmeg, and add cinnamon.

Very easy, as many users we used more jalapenos for the heat.  We used slit chicken breasts and served them over rice with bell peppers and the left over marinade.

23/Nov/09: I've been wanting to do Jerk Chicken for a while now and at last I have found an easy recipe to follow.  Maybe it's just the way it's been wrote out.  Will definitely be making this chicken this week.  Thinking of serving it with Caribbean rice and peas.  Too much?  Let me know.

24/Nov/09: have just done the marinade.  I can't believe how easy and quick it was to do it.  Took minutes.  Next time it will take seconds as I don't need to follow written instructions as I will know what I am doing after doing once already.

This dish was phenomenal! I halved the recipe, and it was still enough for me to marinade two breasts and two thighs. I added 4 cloves of garlic and 2 jalapeno peppers. Everything else I kept the same. The chicken came out juicy and flavorful. I took the leftover marinade and cooked it to pour on top of the chicken and rice. Can't wait to make again! Thanks!

I made this for my fiance and he absolutely loved it!  We cut the chicken in to chunks and and grilled it on kabobs with mushrooms, pineapple, bell peppers, and red onions.  I also reduced the marinate to make a sauce.  The flavor on the sauce was good, but the texture was a little off.  I think it would have worked better if I had strained it.  I think next time I will use more jalapenos or habanero to make it spicier.

This was pretty good but definitely not hot at all. I was really disappointed in the lack of heat.  I used 2 jalepenos and there wasn't even a kick to it.  I think I am going to try this again but use a habanero.  Other that not being spicy it had a pretty good flavor.  I served it with rice and fried bananas.

oh this was sooo lovely! totally a family favorite! The chicken, itself, had tons of flavor. I loved all the spices in the coating/marinade. It really was good, but instead of serving it on tortillas, I would recommend serving it over cous cous or rice, because when it's served on tortillas, the OMG awesome chicken doesn't show it's flavor as much as when served on rice. Still, this was awesome! I liked it cuz it had a nice kick and the pineapple adds an extra flavor boost! If I could give this a trillion stars, I definitely would! This is awesome awesome awesome! I HIGHLY recommend this dish! YUMMY!

Very delicious chicken. Will make this several more times. Definitely benefits from marinating, the longer the better. I served this at a b-day party with, mango chutney, fried sweet plantains, and yellow rice with pigeon peas. Everyone loved it, they came back for 2nds,3rds, and even took some home.  The attendees all came from different backgrounds. I'm very pleased with this recipe. thank you so much.

The flavor was good, but it could have used more kick.  Next time I will use a habanero pepper.  Also, the texture of the chicken was a little weird.  It was a bit stringy and kind of soggy feeling.  My son loved it, though, and he's uber picky, so we'll keep it!

I made this according to the recipe and it was tasty. I didn't taste much heat however and I am a big heat wimp! Next time I'll add another jalepeno. This did make a ton of marinade so I put half in the freezer. The chicken was nice and juicy, just needed more kick. I'll add red pepper flakes to the lefover chicken that is already cooked

This was really good! I had never tried jerk seasoning before and thought that it tasted great! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the amount of liquid. I wanted a nice coating of seasoning, so I cut down all the liquid measurements to a third of what was called for. It turned out perfect! Thanks for the great recipe!

Pretty bland for me...  Followed this recipe to the letter except instead of adding chicken breasts cut up a whole chicken. Marinated for 24 hours.  I'm sorry to say that it turned out pretty bland, although the color of the chicken was beautiful.

I really enjoy the flavor of jerk seasoning and thought I'd try this recipe. It was great except waaayyy too much clove!! I think I'll change it to 1/8tsp instead. I will definately make this again. Thanks for sharing

needs to be hotter/spicier. flavor is perfect. add some cayenne pepper or extra jalapeno with seeds and membrane. goes good with spanish rice and black beans or maybe even some fried bananas.

Very good.  The marinade really penetrated and flavored the chicken.  I used one Scotch Bonnet pepper instead of a jalapeno, and it still was not spicy at all.  Next time I'll try 3 Scotch Bonnets or Habeneros.

This receipe was great but I followed a few other reviewers advice and reduced the soy sauce ti 1/2 c.and added garlic cloves.  I served it at my husband's carribean beach b-day party.  My sister-in-law said it was the best bbq chicken she has ever tasted!  We will definitely be doing this again to remind us of our favorite place - Jamaica!

I didn't think this tasted all that much like jerk chicken, but it was still really good!  I added some garlic like other reviewers suggested.  Next time I will use hotter peppers to make it a little spicier.  But I will definitely make this again and again!

This recipe was OK, it didn't really taste like the Jerk Chicken we had in Jamaica; it was no where near as hot/spicy as I was expecting. I added more Jalapeno's than called for, I couldn't find any Habanero Peppers that are usually used in Jerk Chicken...also, I think traditional Jerk Chicken has Orange Juice in it too...so, not too sure if I would make this again. Thanks for the recipe anyway!!

im giving this review a 2 because it had an "ok" taste. everyone i made it for liked it, it was only ok too me. The clove taste was very intense and it was not spicy at all. Everyone agreed it didnt taste like jerk at all. i would advise to add a tablespoon of red curry powder and a bit of red pepper to spice it up.

When I was in Jamaica, I had jerk chicken.  It was well-seasoned, but not spicy hot. In fact, it tasted a lot like the chicken I made with this recipe! I did cut the onion in half. Next time, I will cut the liquid in half and marinate in a plastic bag. I did simmer down my extra marinade and used it to baste the chicken on the grill.  That worked well, but I still had way too much. Used dried thyme (1 tsp.) successfully. Well received by our friends and the two toddlers present.

Great recipe, But needs tweaking.  WAy to much onion flavor. I cut it down to 3 green onions, and half a white onion.  I used red wine vinegar.  And also added a little cayenne pepper cuz its kind of sweet.  The jalapeno works great, but I also added a couple of tbs of lemon juice to it. Great recipe though, and I marinated for a few hours for more flavor. Thanks

I had to leave out the allspice and cloves because I didn't have them and I also baked the chicken instead of grilling.  All-in-all this is a delicious recipe and I will be making this many times.

It wasn't bad, but not what I was expecting. I have made jerky chicken before and either the other recipe is not authentic or this one is just different. The recipe is fine, it is just not what I was hoping for.

This was pretty good. I used chicken breasts, and pounded them first, and I think this helped them suck up the flavor of the marinade. Served with cilantro rice. Yummy and nice change of pace from my standard chicken recipes.

This was a great change from the regular buffalo wings.  I marinated the chicken over night. Since it's still too chilly outside for the BBQ grille, I cooked the chicken in the marinade for about 10 min. and then set them in the broiler for about 5-7 min. on each side. They came out perfect. Loved it as did the family.

I didn't really care for the flavor of this chicken.  I haven't made jerk before but I won't make this again.  Might just be my personal taste.  DH thought the chicken was OK but he dipped it in BBQ Sauce.

Absolutely amazing!! I don't omit or change anything about this, because it is delicious. The chicken comes out so moist! I like to add a few slices of jalepeno on top of my chicken a few minutes before I take it off the grill- mainly for a little color and extra "zing!"

Great flavor. I didn't have any green onions so I omitted those (don't think they were missed) and cut the brown sugar to 1 1/2 tablespoons, and the fresh thyme to 2 teaspoons.

I grilled chicken breast strips on skewers for an appetizer and everyone loved them!  The spices smelled awesome and the meat came out sweet and tender after 6 hours of marinating.  The meat was NOT spicy as expected, so I will keep the jalepeno seeds in or use a hotter pepper next time for that kick.

It just didn't seem right to bake it in the oven; I used a stove top grill, and it came out incredible. It's a really nice, zesty chicken, and seeing as chicken tends to be on the blander side of most dishes, well, let's just say this is one of my new favorites.

I made this but used habaneros. There's only two of us and I used this marinade for 6 chicken breasts, so I cooked up two and then put the others in ziplock bags (2 in each bag) and placed then in the freezer. I also put the leftover marinade in another bag in the freezer. Very good with a nice after-burn.

Great!!  Didn't have allspice on hand so added 1/3 tsp cayenne, 2 cloves minced garlic, and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  Paired it with a spicy veggie so chicken was just right, not too hot or mild.  A keeper!

Really good!  This made a lot of marinade and I just couldn't bring myself to discard it after marinating.  So I brought it to a boil, simmered it to  thicken and then added some cornstrach.  It made a very nice sauce for my chicken breasts.  I used two small hot peppers from the garden, which were not hot at all.  This would be even better with  a bit more heat.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

My 12 year old is entering a cooking contest. He chose this recipe as a potential choice. It was a homerun! We used boneless, skinless thighs along with the breasts. I don't like dark meat, but everyone else perfered the thighs to the breasts. We're doing this one again.

I loved this recipe. I used jalapeno with some of the seeds.  It was a little spicy but not too hot.  I also marinated overnight.  The chicken was really tender.  It had a nice flavor, none of the ingredients overwhelmed.  I will definitely make it again.  Too bad my side dishes didn't turn out as good.  I served it with bbq pineapple and calyso rice, both of which I will not be making again.

This recipe was a nice change but my sister thought that the soy sauce was a bit strong. That could be reduced next time, but overall it was a good marinade.

Awesome recipe.  Great flavor, chicken was tender and moist.  We doubled the recipe and froze the extra breasts with the marinade in freezer baggies.  We will make these again because our extras are already gone.  This was not too spicy for our kids.

EXCELLENT recipe and so very easy!  I broke out the blender and put all the wet ingredients in first, did a rough chop of all the veggies, added the spices (which you can "eyeball") and turned the blender on to "liquefy".  This recipe is hard to mess up!  The only thing I did different from the recipe as written was to substitute a habenero for the jalapeno - but my family, which includes a finicky 11 year old, loves spicy food.  It's a great way to turn what can be boring chicken breast into a healthy, tasty meal.  Thanks for a winner!

I  was expecting a traditional jerk chicken recipe when I made this for a bbq, I was a little disappointed that its not the traditional recipe. This is not a jamaician jerk chicken recipe however it is really good. Everyone at the bbq loved it. The marinade was a little time consuming but I made it for 7 lbs. of chicken. The left overs tasted good as well. I recommend this recipe but like I said keep searching if you have your heart set on jamaician jerk.

This recipe was awesome!  I had never had jerk chicken before so I don't know how close it is to the original, but I don't care!  My husband, who is extremely picky and not usually a chicken fan, loved it as well!  We made the recipe as is, except with two jalapenos instead of one.  It still wasn't too spicy, so next time I'll use the habanero.  I will make this again and again.  Also make sure you check out the "meal ideas for this recipe" link.

This is not jerk chicken, but still very, very good.

I made a few modifications to the recipe, such as adding Jamaican hot sauce.  I only marinated for about 5 hours, but the flavor was still amazing.  My boyfriend loved it.  I served it with rice and beans.  Very good!!

Very good. Didn't really taste like authentic jerk chicken though. I didn't have all spice or fresh thyme. I used herbed thyme and added some jerk seasoning. Made with easy rum cake from this site.

This was a GREAT recipes. I do have to admit, though, that the smell, color, and texture of the marinade was a little strange. But the taste was FABULOUS. I let me chicken marinade in the refridgerator for 24 hours so that the flavor went all the way through the meat. My fiance doesn't like spicy stuff so I rinsed the marinade off the chicken breast. The meat still had a good flavor but didn't have the kick mine had. Great recipe!!! Will definatly use again.

I fed this to the gang at a family reunion and everyone wanted the recipe. The only thing I didn't have was fresh thyme. The first time I made it, I added dried thyme which was too strong. The second time, I just skipped the thyme and it was just fine. Next year I'll have to plant some thyme in my garden! Wonderful and worth the time to make this recipe!

I thought this was really good and would have given it 5 stars except I served the leftovers with a purchased mango chutney.  The chutney took this dish to a new level.  It was just awesome.  I will definitely make again and serve with the chutney.

I don't like a lot of spicy things, but this was fantastic!  I put in 2 jalapenos.  Hubby suggested habanaro peppers next time...., but that might be too hot for my taste.  Think I'll add 3 T of brown sugar instead of just 2 next time.  Thanks!

This is probably my most favorite of recipes in my recipe box. I've been serving this for about 4 years now and it's so darn good. I do use chicken breast instead of boneless thighs (mainly because boneless thighs are very diffucult to come by around here), but it is always a huge hit, and I have so very picky eaters. One other changes is that I do not add the peppers/onions. I just add a little onion powder in it's place. Thanks for such a great recipe. I've shared it many times.

excellent recipe...  i made this for a dinner party, marinating the chicken early in the day and grilling later that evening, and received rave reviews all around.  just the right notes of heat, spice, salty and sweet.  i served it with sweet potato fries and a corn and black bean salad - great combo of flavors, textures and colors.  one of the best recipes i've downloaded from this site!

Both my husband and I agree - This is some of the best chicken we've ever had!  Like some others, I was a little put off by the color of the marinade, but the whole "don't judge a book by its cover" phrase really comes into play on this one!  I only made one change to the recipe.  I didn't have any nutmeg, so I just put in some cinnamon instead.  This will definitely be at the top of our grilling repertoire this summer!  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious!  I usually don't like cold chicken leftovers, because most of the flavor is usually gone, but this chicken was delicous, even cold a couple of days later, and maintained the robust flavor throughout.  Moist and juicy, not dried out.  I substituted olive oil for the oil, and teriyaki for the soy, and it turned out great.  I think I'll make it a little hotter next time though, adding more jalapenos.

I wasn't impressed with this recipe at all. I would say that it tasted like green onions and soy sauce. I even increased the amount of jalapenos and it still wasn't even spicy. I wouldn't recommend using a habanero for more kick, maybe use less soy sauce, green onions, and more herbs and spices. This does not compare to any jerk chicken I have ever had.

This was great! Everyone loved it. I had to change a couple of things because I had run out of some ingredients... so, instead of soy sauce, I used 1/2 cup of "jerk" marinade from the store. I also added fresh lime juice from 1 key lime, and 2 Tbls. of terriyaki marinade, too. Oh, and, I didn't have any jalepon peppers, so I put in several dashes of cayenne pepper instead. We put the breasts on some great buns with lettuce and tomato, and had the best jerk chicken sandwhiches we've ever had -- we'll definitely make it again!

This was a great recipe!  I made it for friends and it was very well received. I added garlic, a kiwi and doubled the jalapeno.  It still didn't have enough kick for my family.  I made the marinade in the blender and let it marinate overnight.  It was really nice and smelled wonderful cooking.  I will make this again.

I hate to be the only dissenter in regards to this recipe, but.....I didn't like it at all.  I found the flavours too overpowering.  Having said that, everybody else that was at my dinner table that night just loved it.  The chicken was very tender.

I followed the instructions exactly and grilled it on the bbq.  Delicious.  After the chicken was grilled, i sliced it and used it for "sandwiches".  For the bread I used Pitas.  Instead of standard sandwich veggies, I mixed up a Carribean cucumber salad.
  to make:  cut cucumber lengthwise, scoop out seeds.  cut into 1/2" pieces and sprinkle with 2 teaspoons of salt.  let rest for 30 minutes.  then, i added 1 minced jalapeno pepper (seeded), 2 teaspoons of lime juice & 1 minced clove of garlic.  i covered it and let rest at room temp for 1 hour.  this made the "sandwich" a cut above all others.

I grilled this the other night. It was the best chicken recipe I have had in a long time. I used cider vinegar and instead of brown sugar added the same amount of coconut milk. It was wonderful and everyone is asking for the recipe!

Quite tasty!  I served with whole wheat couscous and raisins.  Leftover chicken (I made extra) was used in an entree salad with creamy ranch dressing. One big jalapeno was all we needed for heat.

We had this for dinner the other night with Cajun rice and cucumber salad.  I couldn't believe how good it was!  I was nervous when I saw the marinade, but it turned out wonderful, thanks for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper!!!

This is great for a large party! I cut into cubes, marinated over night and made into shish-kabobs. Served with California cole slaw and mashed sweet potatoes. It was a hit!

Next time I will make it a little spicier.  It was too cold to grill so I had to cook this in the oven.  I don't think it turned out they way it should have.

This is by far some of the best chicken I've ever eaten!  When we blended up the marinade, the aroma filled the whole house.  It was wonderful.  We'll make this again and again.  Thank you!

This recipe is the bomb.com yall!!! However, instead of marinating the chicken overnight I cook it in a slow cooker with about 2/3 of the marinade. I then either broil or grill the chicken after and use the remaining marinade as a dipping sauce. Also instead of breasts we prefer using whole cut up chicken.

Followed the recipe to the t,  yet didn't taste like jerk chicken.  No bite or spice, was missing something.  Tastes like soya sauce and onion marinade.  For the work involved in marinade prep, quite disappointing.

It’s very good. Next time I’ll add cornstarch to the sauce so it will cling to the chicken better and add more flavor.

This recipe makes for tasty Chicken....but it’s not Jerk!   This is aEuropean white man’s version of Jerk and not even close to authentic.   For example....Soy Sauce???   My Jamaican family, that have lived off the land for decades in the hills of Portland Jamaica and Jerk everything they cook...have NEVER had Soy Sauce in their pantry.  They prepare their Jerk with herbs and spices they grow from their Jamaican land...most of which you’d never heard of.  This recipe is an amateur Jerk recipe....very amateur.  Someone that knows how to Jerk will ask themselves after reading this amateur recipe...soy sauce???!  And where’s the beef mint???  :)

I wasn't so sure of the marinade - I over-pulverized it in the food processor and it was quite liquidy.  Yum, yum, and yum.  Made no modifications.    Okay, I only used the green onions I had remaining which was 4 - but they were big.  My 11 year old said it was the best chicken I have ever made.  There was a lot of excess marinade.  Perhaps next time I will freeze some to use in the future.  This is definitely going into rotation.

Sadly very disappointed. Expecting a Jamaican Jerk Chicken and not even close. No one wanted this. We choked down enough for dinner and tossed the leftovers. This was bland and made exactly as outlined. We like spice and this has plenty but the ratio must be off or something. Not a good Jamaican Jerk recipe. Don't be afraid to skip this one.

This pleased all of my family members, including the dreaded picky eater. I kept out the hot peppers, but followed it closely otherwise. I marinated chicken thighs for only 4 hours then bbq'ed and they were awesome.  Easy, fast, lots of flavor and healthy too!

This recipe is a keeper! I made a few changes based on some of the reviews I read... used 1/2 soy sauce, no Green onions, 2 jalapeños, 1 teaspoon allspice and cloves. I also cooked it down a little bit to thicken. I let it cool and marinated for 6 hours before throwing on the grill. The favor was sweet at first then spicy right after. It's not exactly like some one places I've had but it's pretty  close!

It was good, for sure. The marinade is a good bit of work and ingredients - so I'm not certain that I couldn't have enjoyed this just as much with stock BBQ sauce or something, but yeah, it was good.

Will I make it again? Likely not. I think I'd just as soon try something new.

After visiting Jamaica early the year, we have been craving Jerk Chicken since we got home. I came across this recipe and it is now a household favorite. The first time I made it, I used 2 jalapenos but it was not hot when we ate it. The second time I made it, I used 2 habanero peppers and was the perfect amount of hotness for us. I also added a tablespoon of minced garlic in the food processor for a little extra flavor. I currently have chicken marinating for supper! :)

I buy the skinless, boneless chicken thighs from Costco. I make a batch of the marinade in the blender. I divide the chicken into equal portions and add the marinade to the chicken & store in freezer bags in the freezer until ready to use. It's a family favourite!  Makes 4 serving of 6 pieces of chicken.

My favourite jerk chicken recipe. I have made it numerous times and I will play with the spice part. I find jalapeño to not be spicy enough so I use different types of hot peppers. I toss everything into my vitamix and marinade for at least 2 hours, best taste is when the chicken marinades for 24 hours. I've tried dried thyme when I didn't have any fresh and it made a huge difference I recommend fresh !

The wings were not spicy enough and not a lot of flavor. The marinade helped get the wings crispy on the BBQ.

My family really liked this recipe. I didn't add the heat. I think it might have been better with more spice. I also simmered the remaining marinade for about 20 minutes after dinner and placed the left-over cooked chicken in the marinade for storing. I made (Jamaican) rice and peas and a light butter lettuce salad with this, which really complimented the chicken.  I also cooked my boneless, skinless chicken breast on the grill (low heat) for 35 minutes and they were cooked through and super moist.

Tasty, although not quite what I remembered jerk chicken to taste like (possibly just a variation, so no comment on authenticity).  Got lazy and did not clean out my jalapenos, so it came out pretty spicy.  Other changes: doubled everything except the liquids and the regular onion.  Only used 1/4 cup of soy sauce and that seems to have worked out well enough, leaving a good balance of flavors.   Marinated overnight, then baked the chicken in the oven.  Had about half of the marinade left over, seems good as a dip or on bread.  Will probably make again.

This is the best jerk recipe I've ever tried, hands down. I've been to Jamaica and it reminds me of how the locals serve it up. I do make a couple tweaks it. I generally double the recipe and use one habanero or a scotch bonnet pepper in place of one jalapeño, I like the heat! I also add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon (1/4 tsp if not doubling.) Then instead of marinating for hours on end I put all the chicken and half of the marinade, enough to cover the chicken, in a slow cooker and cook on low for about 6 hours. After I place the chicken on a baking sheet, brush new marinade mixture on it, then broil the chicken.  (Or, I'll do the same but place it on the grill to get it crispy externally.)  I also reserve some marinade for dipping.

quite tasty and easy to make. I doubled the batch and it was perfect with a 4lb bag of frozen  wings and drumsticks.

Absolutely amazing flavour. I decided to make this as a slowcooker recipe, reducing the amount of soy sauce and replacing the brown sugar with maple syrup. Set it overnight for 12 hours and had it for brunch!

Great marinate! However, next time I'll use a whole cut up chicken & cook in an oven bag to lock in moisture. I don't have a grill, so the oven will have to do!

Not horrible, but DOES NOT taste like the authentic flavor you get in the Caribbean. Use Chef John's marinade from his Jerk Chicken Wings instead. And you might want to use Scotch Bonnet peppers instead of the Habaneros he calls for (but handle both with care). Finally, use either a smoker or grill with an aluminum pan of wood chips on top of charcoal to get the truly authentic flavor. Oh yeah, and don't use breasts. Thighs, drums, or wings will do much better.

My family loves this recipe. We use boneless thighs instead of breasts. The marinade gets mixed in a blender like a slushy. We buy the thighs on sale and put the thighs and marinade in gallon freezer bags, and then it goes in the freezer. We defrost it the day we want to serve it. It takes about 15 -20 minutes on the grill. It actually makes a quick and delicious dinner with all of the preparation in advance.

Very very good.   I love  Jamaican jerk chicken, and I'm not an expert, but this is pretty close to the jerk chicken I've had in Jamaica on a few trips.   Spiciness, less/more, that all depends on where you get the jerk chicken in Jamaica.   Every place has it's own taste.   I substituted Scotch Bonnet peppers for the jalapenos for a little more authentic taste, and I used chicken wings instead of SLBL breasts, other than those two revisions, I followed the recipe as written.   I will definitely make this again and again.   Thank you!

I've never been to Jamaica and we don't have any Jamaican restaurants nearby. However, we did have a Jamaican food truck that my wife and I only got to try one time before they moved to another city. This recipe nailed that flavor that we were longing for. I made it exactly as listed, with some rice and peas from another site. I was amazed that Kroger actually has a Jamaican section with rubs, scotch bonnet hot sauce and some plantain chips.

This was good, but I don't know if it's special enough to make again.  I also marinated zucchini and red bell peppers and grilled them, and that was good as well.  I put the chicken in one resealable bag for marinating and the veggies in another, and I had more marinade than I needed.  If I were just making the chicken and planning to marinate in the bag, I could cut the recipe in half.  You might need that much marinade if you're marinating in a bowl, though.

I didn't have alot of soy sauce so I had to top it up with worcestershire and I didn't have any spring onions either but this recipe turned out great and we'll definitely have it again. A nice alternative to the many sweet chicken recipes with honey and the like.

Tasted good, but just not the kind of "jerk" flavoring we were looking for.  We were looking for something a with a little more kick (and we even used habaneros instead of jalapenos).  We used a little less brown sugar, 5 seeded and minced habaneros, and the recipe was still a little duller than what we were looking for.  Would recommend trying it though!  We marinate it overnight and this makes the chicken very tender and moist when cooked.

Very Good - I used a locally grown hot pepper rather than a jalepeno and wish I would've gone spicier.  I would also cut back on the vinegar a little too - a tad too acidic.  Overall, it was a hit with my bf.

This is the best chicken recipe I've found in a long time. Made it for a tropical themed baby shower and everyone raved about the chicken. Was even told it was better than eating at a fancy restaurant! I'm going to make this chicken every week. It's sooooooo good! 

I was worried about it being too spicy for my pregnant friend so I cut the jalapenos by half, but it wasn't spicy at all, so I think next time I might add a few extra.

This is not spicy at all!  The flavor was nice but I spent some time in Jamaica and all of the chicken there knocked my socks off.  My husband hated it and my brother thought it was okay.  I guess you need to make it with the habaneros if you want is spicy.

I would like to be nice and give this a higher rating but I don't think I'll be making it again.  So I think that over all 3 stars is pretty generous.  We were not that impressed by it.  It didn't "Wow" us in any way, however I have to say that the dogs did love it...I just don't make things that are that elaborate for my dogs even it it was the 4th of July!

This is the BEST chicken recipe! I cooked this for my husband and he fell in love with it... We were just in Jamaica for our honeymoon and I thought cooking some jerk chicken would be a nice reminder. If you want it spicy definatly use a habanero as the jalapeno was not spicy at all.

We had to wash off the chicken and start over. Too much thyme and I used less than the recipe said. Did not have the problem of too much of a soy sauce taste. Will not try again.

Unfortunately, I did not realize that I am not particularly fond of thyme.  The strength of this flavor in the recipe was a bit overpowering for my husband and me.  Be sure that you like the taste of that herb before you decide to prepare this recipe.

This was quite tasty, though not as spicy as I was expecting.  It was my first time making jerk chicken, and I will definitely make it again.

I substituted 1 habanero pepper (seeds removed) for the jalapeno and convection roasted the chicken at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  All 6 people at our dinner party loved this recipe and gave it 5 stars!!!

The marinade doesn't look pretty, but it tastes great.  I served this with red beans and rice--not exactly Jamaican, but the combination worked well.  This is one of my favorite marinades.

Great taste with chicken and pork.  No real substitutions needed, but when at a loss for the jalapeno I have used crushed red pepper flakes and had equally great taste.

Loved it! Instead of using the chopped jalepeno i used a few dashes of hot sauce, and dried thyme instead of fresh thyme. Excellent!

Yum! Great recipe, unique flavor. It made a lot of marinade, so we divided and used half at a time.  Next time I'll add even more jalapeno pepper for extra spice.

I have used this recipe on several occasions and had success with it each time.  I customized the recipe to make thirty servings. I varied from the original by using bone in chickens halved and thick cut pork chops.  I also slow cooked the meat on the grill.
Not quite as spicy as the jerk chicken or pork I have had in Jamaica, but this recipe has a great flavor.  Definately a recipe to try.

I marinated the chicken overnight for my husband to take to work and prepare.  His assessment: "fantastic." An interesting and delicious blend of flavors.  He thought it went terrific with the Caribbean sweet potato salad from this site.

Although time consuming, this recipe was well worth the efforts. And I had all of the ingredients at home! I followed the recipe EXACTLY and marinated chicken thighs (with skin) to be baked in the oven. I wish it was a little spicer, so next time I will add another jalapeno. As I was making the marinade, it didn't resemble the jerk seasonings that I'm used to. The marinade was thinner and it covered a LOT of chicken. The jerk that I'm used to is more pasty, like a rub. But this was great! I will make this again tonight!

This chicken is awesome!  I left out the jalepeno pepper and used dried Thyme.  It made a ton of marinade, so I saved some & will make this again this week, love it!!

very good recipe. I did everything that the recipe called for the only change I made was to add some garlic. It will be made over and over thanks for such a good recipe.

Excellent!  I made the recipe exactly as it appeared, except for the fact that I let it marinate for a full 24 hours (as I get older, I think my taste buds are going).  The chicken was tender and very flavorful. I served it with Red Beans & Rice (I used Zatarain's. Living in Chicago,we're not exactly experts on Jamaican/Carribean recipes...we thought it tasted just fine) and corn on the cob.  Delish!

My husband loves chicken ... I can tolerate it. This recipe was absolutely terrific. It made a load of marinade, too. I was able to marinate a pound and a half of chicken breasts and a pound of chicken tenders.  We had a hot dinner right off grill and then used the leftovers for jerk chicken salads.  It was a huge hit - a recipe that I would definitely use when we have friends over.  Great flavor.  I followed the recipe pretty closely and as someone else mentioned - it didn't look all that pretty, but the chicken was fabulous.

Great!  Served over rice with the marinade (boiled first). My husband said that is was "phenomenal!”  Only changes: used onion powder instead of onions and marinated in the fridge ~36hrs. Yummmmm!!!

this was good but needed to be spiced up. I duly seeded and cored the jalepeno and either I won't do that next time, or I'll use habenero. Also makes enough for two dinners--we'll try it on pork or shrimp next time.

I am overseas and they don't sell allspice here so i used what they say is the closest thing to it which is 5 spice chinese blend, it was still really good, but a good friend came to visit from the states and brought me a container of allspice, I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY THIS AGAIN!!!!

This is one of the most flavorful chicken recipes on allrecipes.  I recommend what others have stated, use a habenero if you want some kick and use the leftover sauce to baste the chicken while it cooks.

Mmmm... good!  I only marinated it for around four hours after poking lots of holes in it with a fork.  I ate this with someone else too and we both liked it.  Another plus is that it's really quick to make it: just drop everything in a blender!  (Oh, and we don't like spicy stuff so we didn't put in any peppers in at all.)

This was a great recipe. Next time will not add as much vinegar or soy sauce.  I did add garlic and some lime juice and also did not have the peppers so I added some red pepper flakes. Very tender and will make again. My family liked it. A little different from when I went to Jamaica and tried there Jerk chicken but otherwise it was good.

This is a great marinade for kabobs.  The chicken ended up being a little soggy after marinating overnight, but I seared it over the grill at the end and it added much-needed crispness to the outside.  Thank you for sharing!

This wasn’t one of our favorite recipes. I followed the directions (except I baked the chicken), but it just wasn’t for us. It wasn’t too hot, it just has a very different taste…too different for us!

This recipe is sooooo delicious!  I made chicken kabobs with it and served it with "spicey mango salsa" from this site.  It has a very authentic fresh taste and I got compliments from every single person who tried it.  The marinade/sauce looks kind of greenish brown so it's not necessarily pretty but as soon as you taste it you won't care WHAT it looks like!

Could have had a little more spice.  Next time will use more jalapeno peppers.  The nutmeg and allspice were a little overwhelming.  Husband loved it though!

This wasn't spicy (especially not compared to the Caribbean Pasta), and I don't think it tasted like jerk chicken, but it was fantastic. We barbequed it at a tiki party and it was gone as fast as the beer battered coconut shrimp. I will make this again as soon as I get some more soy sauce.

I started making this recipe without reading the instructions, I just threw all the ingredients in a dish to marinate. I then realized that I was supposed to blend all the ingredients together. Oops!  Well, we grilled it up without bothering to blend it and it was fabulous.  So, in essence, I made it much easier and I didn't have to face the green/brown funky look that everyone talked about in their reviews.

Excellent flavor.  I cut out the oil to make the dish healthier and didn't miss it a bit.  This makes a lot of marinade.  No need to double it unless you have 4 lbs. of chicken.  I topped it with "watermelon fire and ice salsa" from allrecipes.com - excellent dish!

Excellent flavor to this chicken. We pounded the breasts before marinating so they were even. An added benefit is there is more surface for the delicious marinade. Next time, I plan on topping it with a pineapple salsa. We served it with beans and rice.

I gave this a 4 star simply because of the awful color of the marinade, I was actually afraid to use it, it was so ugly, brownish-green. HOWEVER, it tasted wonderful and after grilling the chicken, the color wasn't SO bad.  I followed the other reviews and added extra spice, and it was fab!

For this recipe, we made the following changes based on various people's reviews:  1/2 cup of soy sauce, 1/3 cup vinegar, 1/3 cup lemon juice, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 TBS Frank's red hot, and 2 cloves of garlic.  However, it tasted like there was too much soy sauce.  Sorry, but I will never make this dish again.

This is an easy and great tasting recipe.  I used chicken tenders on a a stove top grill pan.  They cooked up quickly and tasted great.  The meat marinated for 5 hours.  I used garlic flavored oil.  I served it with Indian Saffron rice on the allrecipes site.  A great dinner!  Thanks!

This was fabulous!  Everyone enjoyed it even the picky eaters.  Some people thought that it was beef since the marinade makes the chicken so dark and tasty.

First time I tried it, I invited my neighbor over to enjoy.  She had to have the recipe for herself and her daughter-in-law.  Next, I fixed it for my daughter and she demanded the recipe for herself and her mother-in-law.  All of these people have tried it and given the recipe to their friends.

This is the best tasting chicken I've ever had. Had Calypso Rice and Beans with it, and Jamaica Cake for dessert. What a feast! DELICIOUS!!   CHERI

Different and GOOD!  Tasty!!  Next time I'll try the garlic and the kiwi - bet that's going to be GOOD!  Cannot wait for my sandwich I have for lunch today!!UPDATE: We love this stuff, I've been making it for years now, cannot believe reading this I once tried it without kiwi and garlic.  Every time I make this I add 1 kiwi and 3 cloves of garlic.  This is one of our households all time favorites!

EXCELLENT!!!  I used Daves Insanity Hot Sauce instead of the pepper and added red pepper flakes.. Was GREAT!  Chicken wasnt dry, was very flavorful.   Also was great the next day as chicken sandwiches.. Will be adding this recipe to my box!
