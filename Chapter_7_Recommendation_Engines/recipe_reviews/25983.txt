Made this for Christmas Eve.  Delicious and beautiful!!  Make sure you bake cheesecake in a waterbath and after it bakes for indicated time, turn oven off and let cheesecake sit for an hour.  This way it won't crack!  Also, I added a teaspoon of almond extract to a cup of whipped cream and some powdered sugar and whipped for a VERY YUMMY whipped cream garnish!

I had never made a cheesecake before and this was SO easy and came out great both times I made it. My friends were incredibly impressed and amazed that it was my first. I cut back on the almond flavoring a bit  the first time as previously suggested but think the amount called for in the recipe is better. I served it with fudge ice cream topping drizzed over it. YUM!

this is a great cheesecake!  I used only half the amount of almond extract and only half the sugar in the crust.  it was great.  I also didn't do the "marble" thing, I just mixed everything together and it was perfect.  the best cheesecake ever.

I thought it had too much almond flavor, very overwhelming of the other flavors.  I followed the recipe to a "T", and it still cracked.  It is very rich!  I would definitly recommend it, but go easy on the almond extract!

Wonderful! Everyone raved about this dessert, especially the crust. The only thing that needed changing is the ratio of melted butter to the crust mixture. If you make the given amount of crust (3 cups of chocolate cookie crumbs, which yields a thicker crust) then you need a full cup of melted butter. If you make a thinner crust of 2 cups of chocolate crumbs, then a half cup should be fine. For the cookie crumbs, I used chocolate animal crackers, but realized after the fact that chocolate graham crackers would have worked great as well. I almost left out the almond pieces in the crust, but they were actually one of the complimented aspects. And for those who don't like nuts--you can't taste it at all. I did use the full teaspoon of almond extract, and although I could really taste it in the batter, didn't think it was too strong in the finished product. I definitely wouldn't use more, but don't feel that less is needed unless you hate the taste of almond. The marble effect turned out well even though the "swirling" method with a knife didn't work for me; I think this method will only work if you pour the smaller amount of chocolate batter on the crust first and then pour the remaining vanilla batter on top. Be sure to follow instructions with baking and cooling. I didn't refrigerate overnight (4 hours before serving was sufficient), but be sure the cake is at room temperature before chilling otherwise it might crack. This will surely be a hit!

WONDERFUL RECIPE.  I FIXED THIS WHEN WE HAD COMPANY, AND THEY ALL LOVED IT.  IT IS BETTER AFTER IT SETS A DAY.  THE ALMOND EXTRACT CALLED FOR IS JUST RIGHT.

Good and easy to make cheesecake.  I didn't have chocolate cookies to make the crust so I used other cookies and added some cocoa.  The taste wasn't quite as it should be but there's no way I'm docking a star for something I did to the recipe.  I'll be making it again with the chocolate cookies.  Served with whipped cream.  By the way, I followed the baking instructions - i.e. leaving it in the closed oven for an hour after baking and - NO cracks.

This is a really great recipe. I changed the almond for vanilla though, and made mini cheesecakes with it. One fell into a container and broke, and since I didn't have the heart to waste food, I simply kept it in the container and put it in the fridge. The next day there was only 20% left. I overheard it was so yummy, my sis ate it anyway. (despite the not too appealing appearence!) As usual, I didn't add sugar to the base, since the graham cracker crumbs are sweet enough already.

A nice, creamy cheesecake. Not great flavor, but very good. Like most cooks I have a few suggestions. 1) Wrap the springform pan with foil! The crust calls for A LOT of butter - next time I'd use half - so a lot of oil seeped out during baking. 2) I used chocolate filled oreos for the crust, gave it a great flavor. 3) added a dash of vanilla, too, as well as a pinch of salt: I always feel that enhances a sweet dish.

The baking times/methods were perfect, I just loosened the sides of the cake from the pan while it was still warm. No cracks (though , other than the initial presentation, I don't know what all the "crack-fuss" is about. So a cheesecake cracks, so what? It doesn't affect the taste one iota; and let's face it, after the first slice no one would notice anyway!

All-in-all, a nice creamy texture and not too dense (like some recipes in this genre tend to be).

This cheesecake was delicious! I did not add sugar to the crust and I substituted greek yogurt for half of the sour cream. I will definitely make this one again!

Very good and very easy. Only changes I made was 1 cup of butter for crust, and increased baking time to 55 minutes. Made for my daughter's 21st birthday, was a bit hit.

Delicious! Sweet and yet a bit tart. The whole family loved it.  I cooked it on a lower temp for about 25 mins longer, however it still ended up cracking.  Good thing cracks don't alter the scrumptious taste.

Served at Easter and everybody loved it, although my husband thought the almond flavor was too much.  I think it's just a matter of personal taste as I thought it was a perfect amount.  Also, I used gluten free chocolate cookies for the crust so that my sister could enjoy it and you'd never know the difference.  I'm glad I followed the advice of using the water bath although it did make me very nervous because the foil came off with all buttery water inside it which made me think the crust got water-logged.  But it didn't and was just fine.  Pretty great for my first attempt at cheesecake!

I've made this cheesecake 4 times now. It comes out perfectly every time! I have made afew adjustments. I add vanilla extract only. Add alittle pinch of cinnamon to the crust. I also add walnuts finely chopped instead of almonds. I've increased the nuts to 1 cup and it's very yummy. Also, I only use about 1 cup of the filling to mix into the melted chocolate.  Make sure the eggs/sour cream/cream cheese are all at room temp. I will even microwave my cream cheese in a bowl for about 30 seconds just to make sure it's nice and soft. Good luck and happy baking!!

ALMOND is the key word. That is the dominant taste. I will lessen the amount of extract next time.  May do 1/2vanilla1/2almond extract. Yes, there will be a next time. Creamy and easy to make. I suggest a water bath also.

The crust needed more butter for how many crumbs there were. Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before making, so the crust was very crumbly and fell apart when slicing. After mixing batter into the chocolate,  it was pretty stiff and didn't really swirl very well at all.  The cheesecake part could have been sweeter too. Maybe the chocolate was too dark and more than just bittersweet?

I don't know what I did wrong but this dessert turned out gooey even after 6 hours of cooling, it's still in my oven so this review may be false after time. If anyone would give me tips or advice? My filling even turned yellow and a little brown after adding the eggs and chocolate. Taste too much like cream cheese. Family was very displeased, but we will try it tomorrow after it's been cooled and settled (hopefully)

A good cheesecake, my husband loved it.  I expected it to be a bit denser but still delicious. We topped it with raspberries and freshly whipped cream. Thanks for the submission.

Loved it.  It was a big hit at Easter dinner.  I followed the recipe as written. However, next time I will use milk chocolate instead for a sweeter taste.

This is incredible. I used Oreo cookie crumbs for the base and used slightly less sugar. I also covered the top with slivered almonds which not only looked beautiful, it also added a nice texture and crunch.

Made for Thanksgiving.   Very easy for cheesecake.  Delicious.
