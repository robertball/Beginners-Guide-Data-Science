Recipe creator here!  Personally, what I think really makes the recipe is the use of sweet Italian Sausage, not ground, but links. I remove the casing and cut them in to bite size pieces. I cook that in the olive oil with onions. After several hours in the sauce, the bite size pieces are tender and have absorbed tons of flavor. This truly creates the chunky sauce. You can certainly add green peppers and I often use mushrooms. I typically use it next day to make lasagna or chicken Parmesan.
Edit: The sugar isn't necessary for the taste, but it isn't there for sweetness. Tomatoes contain a lot of acidity and the addition of a little sugar balances it and creates a "smoother" sauce (salt, carrots, and baking soda help as well). Also, a fairly standard size crock pot (5-7 quarts) will work just fine. *If you're having problems with burning, you've added the sugar too early/let it simmer too long with sugar in it. Hope that helps!

This is my go-to spaghetti sauce recipe. Only thing I do different is add in fresh veggies to really stretch the sauce (shredded zucchini, shredded carrots, chopped peppers, fresh sliced mushrooms, and spinach) and I double the sausage. This is great with turkey sausage and ground turkey or chicken. This also freezes well for those who like to make big batches and freeze to thaw out on busy days. Most of these ingredients can be bought cheaply at Aldi/Grocery Outlet for very little. NOTE: Using roasted canned tomatoes is a bonus added flavor, too. Also, if you pre-spray your plastic freezer containers with non-stick spray, they'll wipe clean when ready to wash and will not be stained.

To make dinner even quicker, prepare and freeze the pasta ahead of time.  Thaw it in boiling water, and in less than 2 minutes it's ready to use.  I always boil the whole package of pasta when I cook it then freeze leftoverrs.  What a time saver.

This sauce is fantastic. My husband ate every drop and is definitely not normally a spaghetti sauce fan. Some people were critical of the sugar in the recipe, but I don't know how you could call yourself a foodie and not be familiar with sugar as a part of a tomato based sauce, a very traditional preparation. It's a chemistry thing- all the acid in the tomatoes take on a smoother and more complex flavor with even just a little sugar. As others suggested I added some carrot in with the sauce, so decreased the sugar by just a smidge. My family loves garlic, so in addition to the first teaspoon of garlic powder I added several minced garlic cloves.  Thank you for the recipe, it's delicious!~

Sweet and savory often go together.  Also, here's a tip for those who say the sauce was watery.  Place a clean kitchen towel draped over the open crockpot and then place the lid on the pot.  The towel will soak up the steam and evaporation and help with this.  You can do this with other crock pot foods as well that tend to water down.  In the case of this sauce, be prepared to stain the towel.

The issue to not use sugar because this sauce is too sweet is really not valid. Sugar is used in tomato based sauces to mellow the acidic bite. I personally use brown sugar rather than white because I like the added flavor I get from it. 1 tablespoon of sugar in that much sauce will truly not make it sweet. It's like adding salt to sweet dishes. It brings out the other flavors. Give it a try :-)!

Don't get me wrong-- I'm no health nut, I'm just a foodie. I enjoy baked goods and desserts, but they are the only place that I want to see sugar; not in a spaghetti sauce. The only other problem that I had with this recipe (after editing out the refined sugar) was that the size slow cooker necessary was omitted. Nowadays there are many sizes available, including 2-4-6 convertibles, and size recommendations would have been helpful.

This is a great recipe; very similar to something I have been using for years.  Thanks also to the author for adding the bit about chunks of sausage, versus ground - I wondered where the chunky bit was supposed to come in!   You needn't worry about this amount of sugar in a crock pot full of healthy ingredients.  There will be no noticeable"sweetness", it is more like a "smoothness" that would be missing without it. It's all about balance!  Thanks for a terrific recipe!!

This is wonderful!  I am upset at the one reviewer who discounted it because of the miniscule amount of sugar.  I, too, am a foodie...and adding a little sugar to tomato dishes, as most foodies would know, is a great way to cut back on the acidity and blend the flavors.  I did add more veggies to my sauce, but otherwise I wouldn't change anything!

I'm very fussy about my spaghetti sauce and this is a winner.  I did take the suggestion to use a carrot in place of sugar and it worked very wel.  Thanks.  Will use this often.

Great sauce - very flavorful (and meaty!). I cooked this on high for 4 hours in the slowcooker because I didn't have time to wait 8. I did add a small can of tomato paste at the end to thicken it up a bit - otherwise made as written. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent sauce! I served it to my family (including DD's BF) and they all raved about it. I added bell pepper and celery to the sauce, and a little wine. Mushrooms would also be nice.  I must admit that since my rectangular slow cooker was too small for this recipe, I did simmer the sauce in a soup pot on the stove for about 4 hours. If you do this, be sure to check it regularly. We really liked the combination of ground meat and (turkey) Italian sausage.  Thanks, Ashley!

Well done.  The sugar cuts the tartness of the tomatoes and does not actually "sweeten" the sauce.  As for the "size" of the slow cooker, one might add up the fluid ounces (about 64) and the amount of beef (1.5 lbs) and decide to use a slow cooker to accommodate the stated amounts.  The only thing I omitted was the marjoram only because I didn't have any.  The sauce has a "sticktoitiveness" that doesn't run from the pasta.  I did increase the Italian sausage to equal that of the ground beef.  We loved it and it has become a favorite.  Rich, true depth of flavor, easy to prepare and a recipe I've shared with many friends and family.  All agree, it is delicious!!

This was a truly yummy and scrumptious sauce.  I followed the recipe pretty closely but had to make a few changes based on the ingredients on hand.  I sauteed the beef, sausage, and onions all in one pot, I used a 28 oz can crushed tomatoes in place of the tomato sauce, and used fresh basil and marjoram.  I rinsed the crushed tomato can with about 1/2 cup red wine.  I added a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic, and more herbs and spices.  Tripled the sugar, I like a sweeter sauce.  Since the sauce was very thick, I also added a cup of beef broth to thin a bit.  S & P to taste.  It was wonderful!  A keeper and a definite do over.  Plenty of sauce went in the freezer.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Spaghetti Sauce has always intimidated me a bit so I've never attempted making it from scratch.  This is exquisite and EASY.  I used pureed tomatoes instead of stewed tomatoes because I don't like big chunks of them.  It turned out amazing.  My house smelled like an italian restaurant!  Make this sauce!  You will NOT be disappointed!  I can't wait to eat more for lunch tomorrow!

I've been trying to use my slow cooker more in order to eat at a reasonable time when I get home from work. I was eager to try this sauce, as I usually make my mom's sauce on the stove and let that simmer for about 3 hours. 1. I didn't see a reason for the olive oil since the onion can sauté in the grease from the sausage.  2. I also didn't see a reason to brown the sausage and ground beef separately. Go ahead and cook that all at once. 3. Italian seasoning is basically basil, marjoram, oregano, rosemary, and thyme, but then the recipe calls for more of those individually later on. I'd skip the Italian seasoning altogether, and just use whichever individual herbs you prefer. 4. Just add all the garlic powder at once. No need to add 1 tsp in the first step, then 2 more tsp in the second step.  Or even better, use fresh minced garlic if you're not pressed for time. Having said all that, I ended up taking the recommendations from others and adding in 1 shredded zucchini, along with a couple shredded carrots and half a minced green pepper for added depth of flavor. I also added in an extra can of tomato sauce because I used more italian sausage than called for.  I only cooked it for 6 hours and it was very tasty.  You will likely need to add some salt to this in order for the flavors to really pop.  A great base recipe. Not watery at all, just place a dishtowel under the lid to absorb the excess moisture. I served this sauce over spaghetti squash for a lower calorie/carb meal.

This is excellent spaghetti sauce! I will also use this for my lasagna.  No need to brown sausage and beef separately.  I did them both together with the onions and garlic and it still turned out great. Instead of white sugar, I used brown. I also added 1 bay leaf and 1/4 t more of basil and 1/2 lb of sausage rather than 1/4 just because I had it on hand.  It was a perfect consistancy after only cooking for 6 hours. This is a keeper!

Sauteed Celery in a slow cooking sauce is a great way to add sweetness and not a ton of calories.. It also neutralizes the acidicity from the tomatoes

This sauce is so very watery it's not like sauce, it's like broth. The flavor is incredibly bland and I had to add nearly double the amount of seasoning to stop my spaghetti with red broth taste like something. I will never use this recipe again, nor wish this recipe on my worst enemy.

have made this twice, first in crock pot then stovetop because of last minute decision to make it. it is thick, tomato-ey. it's a keeper. i also increased the amount of italian sausage the second time. i used carrots the second time instead of sugar, which i think i prefer. i think i will try a can of fire roasted tomatoes next time, and some red wine. i like it. lots of room to play with it.

We loved this sauce! I did add a bit more sugar and doubled the Sweet Italian link sausage.  I'm glad you posted about the link sausage instead of bulk.  I removed the casing as stated and cut them into chunks.  It was like having mini meat balls.  The meat absorbed the wonderful flavor of the sauce.  Added large package of fresh sliced mushrooms. You need a big crock pot though my 5 quart wasn't big enough.  Had to slow cook some on the stove top but it was worth it. Spaghetti sauce taste better the 2nd and 3rd day. So I made it the day before. The chunks of tomatoes and the sausage makes for a delicious chunky sauce. Other than adding a little more sugar, mushrooms, and more sausage I followed the recipe as posted. Thanks Ashley.  This is printed and in my recipe book and is now our spaghetti sauce recipe. YUMMY!

I love homemade sauce and this is right up there.  I chose to do a split on the italian sausage & ground beef (equal amounts) and also chose to add 1/2 cup cabernet sauvignon to the sauce.  VERY good spaghetti sauce!!!

I made spaghetti for the football team one night, and had never made sauce from scratch. I saw this recipe and decided to use it. I calculated the recipe for 56 servings and started cooking. I used two roaster ovens, sealing the cooking pan with foil. Cooked all day at 200-225 degrees.  All  the parents that were helping asked for the recipe. Some of the football boys still ask my daughter  when I am going to make spaghetti again! Normally at Christmas we make baked goods for family and friends. This year, we are giving quart  bags of spaghetti sauce frozen and vacuum-packed with the cookies.  I think I will toss in the sweet Italian sausages in addition to the meat in the recipe for more flavor and chunkiness. Thank you for posting a great recipe!!!!!!

This is by far the BEST spaghettin recipe I have ever seen. I can't find anyplace to get the Sweet Italian Sausage other than in ground form but even using the ground Mild Italian Sausage it is FABULOUS. I used 1/2 pound of the ground Italian sausage to 1 pound of ground beef. I am not a huge fan of chunks of tomato in my spaghetti sauce so I used the "petite" diced tomatoes and replaced the stewed tomatoes with the same "petite" diced tomatoes.  They cooked down very nicely. Other than those few things I wouldn't change anything else in this recipe.  I will be making that a lot.

I have to make this sauce at least once a month, its incredible.  The longer it cooks, the better it tastes; my last batch cooked for 17 hours and was heavenly.

I also cooked the sausage and ground meat (I used turkey) together.  Very easy to assemble and tasty.  I will say that, for me, 8 hours on low was too long.  It burned some.  Six would probably be enough.

With regard to sugar being added due to acidity, there are particular brands of tomatoes that won't require that you add sugar.  If you're in the south, Publix carries Cento (canned) and Pomi (BPA free "carton") brand tomatoes.  These are both imported from Italy.  I have only tried the Cento brand and have been pleased with the taste.  I have not experienced issues with acidity using this brand.

It should be noted that all canned tomatoes are not the same.  some are very bitter and the sauce would be ruined without the addition of a tsp of sugar or two.  this also brings into play what all good cooks do.  taste the sauce before you add it, if you don't need it don't put it in.

You can also use Yves Veggie Ground Round to make this meatless.  I also add diced or sliced mushrooms, celery, diced green peppers, and zucchini.  This is so similar to the recipe I have been making for decades that it pretty much is the same, just minus the veggies.  I also add bay leaves but remove them when I put the cooked sauce in containers and freeze them for later meals.  Can't be a real sauce without garlic being added though.

Made with 1 lb hot italian sausage instead of beef/sausage mix. Substituted italian seasoning for oregano/marjoram. Used all crushed tomatoes and tomato paste. Thanks!

The flavor of this is so wonderful.  There is enough here to feed an army though, and since there is only two of us, we wasted most of it, but next time we'll freeze it, or have company over!!

I don't know why I tried this recipe because as I was making it, I couldn't understand why all the different types of tomato products and why all the different herb products.  Dried Italian herbs  (called for 1 tsp.) has oregano, basil and marjoram in it already so why add more.  No one in my family was crazy about this sauce.  We at it just to get rid of it and I did follow the recipe as written.

Fabulous, and easy! I skipped the onions (husband detests onions) and cut the garlic powder in half (ditto). Also, rinsed the cans out with a little red wine and added that too. (Can never hurt! ;-) ) I thought it might need salt and pepper, so I tasted it halfway through, but it wasn't needed. The ingredients have enough seasoning already. This is a keeper. Absolutely delicious!

This is just like the meat sauce my family makes and loves.    Not just for this recipe but other recipes also....if you put two paper towels inside the top of the slow Cooker the water does not drip back into the food. It will help keep sauces thicker.
I have not had that problem with this sauce. We also add a pound of Italian sausage out of the the casing and broken into pieces...it gives a lot more flavor than just the ground beef.

Fabulous sauce! I omitted the ground beef, used 1 pound sweet Italian sausage, used pureed tomatoes instead of stewed.  I simmered it on the stove for 4 hours.  My family loved it; I'm making more now to put in the freezer!

I haven't tasted this sauce yet, but to let people know, the sugar is added to add flavor to food , I 'm a cook and baker I've cooked for restaurants and they also put sugar in some of their foods to enhance flavor. Thanks Rose

This is a great recipe!  I too used linked Italian sausage and the next time, I'll increase the sausage and decrease the ground beef.  I agree that the sugar is necessary and doesn't really make the sauce sweet.  I don't care for sweet sauce and this isn't.

Fantastic! To thicken the sauce a bit I just vented the lid about an hour before serving. I used a 29 oz can of crushed tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce and added crushed red pepper flakes and mushrooms. I definitely will make this again; my husband and I loved it. This makes a TON of sauce so I'm looking forward to having leftovers for lunches. Thanks! :)

This is a GREAT recipe, Shortcut is to brown the ground beef and sausage all at once.  There is no need to have to go through browning twice with sausage, then beef!

Yum, yum, yum! My family and I loved this recipe! It was flavorful and tasty, and this easily makes two meals for a family of 5. The only changes I made were to use one pound of ground beef and one pound of bulk Italian sausage (my boys like meat!), I used 3 tbsp. chopped garlic instead of garlic powder, and I cooked all of the ingredients together to save time before adding to the crockpot. Otherwise, I followed the recipe, and it was delicious! Thanks so much for sharing!

This is super easy and SO good- I did add 2 pounds of hamburger and 1 pound of mild sausage to which I added italian seasoning and garlic when it was cooking-I also like to add chopped green pepper and mushrooms.  This is SO much better than Prego or Ragu and I hope to make enough after we pick our tomatoes in the fall to make, cook and then can with the meat. Since there is meat in the sauce it will need to be at 10 pounds of pressure for 40 minutes for quarts. (or 15 pounds of pressure if you are at high elevation). SUPER recipe!! TEN STARS!!!!

Loved this recipe.  I forgot to add the sugar and afterwards thought why add it with as wonderful a taste.  I also used lean turkey italian sausage and lean ground beef.  I then froze it in servings for later use, too.

Ok, this was absolutely delicious!  I have made this one before, but this time, I mixed it up a bit...For one thing, I used Blondprincess' take on it and used equal parts of Johnsonville Italian ground sausage and the leanest ground beef I could find.  The only other thing I did was mix some of the ground beef and ground sausage together and made some meatballs to make it more interesting.  The result was absolutely fantastic!!   THANK YOU to Johnsonville Sausage!!!

I was a little surprised at the Italian herb addition when browning the meat,along with the powdered garlic, and then add more of them in the form of thyme, basil, marjoram and oregano to the sauce, which are already included in the Italian herb mix, tsp of which would not have much effect on flavoring the recipe.  If I have them on hand, I always add grated carrots even to jarred sauce.  Nice and gets some veggies in there.  I am not a fan of stewed tomatoes as I don't care for the flavors.  I saw some comments about the sauce being greasy.  When the browned meat is drained, hardly any grease goes into the sauce.  I also have simply added the meat uncooked to the sauce (jarred or otherwise) and it cooks just fine in the sauce, like I do with meatballs or sausage.  You could probably skip the browning process altogether if you chose to.  If the sauce is a little too thin for your liking, simply leave the lid off and let some of the water evaporate while cooking.  And, yes, sugar balances the acidity of the tomatoes and does not make the sauce sweet, especially not the minuscule amount added.  I also noted no salt/pepper being added.  This is a taste-as-you-go recipe and may need some adjusting, along with a few red pepper flakes, perhaps, depending on the spiciness of the sauce you want.

THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BEST Spaghetti sauce i have ever made!!!  I did make three small changes. 1) I used sweet italian sausages and cut them out of the casings; 2) I used brown sugar, not white sugar; 3) I used a can of mild Rotel instead of diced tomatoes!  It was delicious!!! I am going to double the recipe this weekend so I can freeze it!

AMAZING!!  I doubled the recipe and put rest in freezer.  It is incredibly tasty.  Used deer sausage (1lb) to 2lb ground beef, did not add any sugar.  And Ashley's right....the longer it cooks, the better it is!

LOVED this!  I've never been able to make a decent spaghetti sauce that wasn't poured from a jar, so to finally know the sweet, sweet taste of success gives me the warm fuzzies.

Was scared at first, because I didn't read ahead enough to know that the sugar is added towards the END of the process, but everything turned out fine.  It has a nice tang without crossing the line to spicy, and the meat turned out really tender and delicious.  Can't wait to see how the leftover sauce that we froze holds up next week when we have pasta again.

I make a sauce very similar to this.  I always double the recipe and use 2 crock pots. Wonderful-delicious. I freeze mine in ziplock bags. Fabulous for a quick supper and great for company too. Add a salad and bread or not.  I love having frozen spaghetti sauce in my freezer.

This is a really great recipe although I've decided I don't really like ground beef cooked in the slow cooker.  Regardless, the flavor of this recipe is delicious and of course, it's much better the second day.  I made it exactly as the recipe was written.

I have been making different verions of the recipe for years due to what I have on hand and just tweaking it to my family's taste,  There is one in my family that also does not like chunks of tomato so I use crushed tomatoes.  Give it a try.

Delicious and easy.  I love slow cooker recipes! My apartment smelled so good. I couldn't wait to get to it.  I used a whole pound of sweet sausage in the casing which ended up being my favorite part. Thanks, Ashley!

Tasty.  I didn't use Italian sausage because its not our favorite but an easy "throw-together" meal for the weekday.

I omitted the oil and cooked all the meats and spices together.  In an effort to be a little healthier, I substituted 1/2 ground turkey for 1/2 of the ground beef.  I liked this sauce except for the fact that it seemed a little thin to me.  My husband wants one that has more of the spices in it.  I loved the ease of the slow cooker, but prefer a thicker, spicier sauce.  So I guess I'll keep looking.

This was an extremely tasty spaghetti sauce and I will definitely keep this recipe.  Instead of browning the sausage and ground beef separately, however, I cooked everything together before draining and adding to the slow cooker.  Also, the sauce was a *little* bit watery.  Perhaps this could be remedied by draining the stewed or diced tomatoes?  A great recipe, however!

This was delicious! Everyone including my 3 picky kids cleaned their plates! I forgot to put it in the crockpot in the morning so I just cooked it in a pot on the cooktop for a couple of hours.  I read the other reviews and followed a couple of suggestions. I used sweet Italian sausage links and removed the casings. I browned them with the onion and ground beef. I also added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar. I will definately make this again!

Granted for years I ate jarred, mostly vegetarian sauces because my husband is vegetarian. So when he went on a work trip and I made this, I felt like I was in a cartoon with the heavens beaming down and the Angels singing lol I used meat from my local butcher and tomato paste from a tube, not a can, and I always feel like high-quality ingredients make a difference. But in general this is just a great recipe that's easy to put together before work and to enjoy when you get home. (Jarring the leftovers makes it last a long time too.) thanks for posting!

I've only EVER had spaghetti sauce from a bottle; this is my first attempt at a homemade spaghetti sauce, and I can tell you it is now my GO-TO recipe! I doubled it, thinking that is the only way to have enough sauce -- wow -- totally unnecessary! My 8qt  pot barely could contain it all, and that's after adding 1 diced bell pepper and 8oz of sliced mushrooms. After we eat this tomorrow, I'm going to add the second container of mushrooms. Thank you for sharing! No need to add sugar, we liked it as is, and since it's sitting in the fridge overnight, I know the flavors will blend nicely, and not have that weird after taste I've become resigned to.

Making this sauce was a combined effort between my husband and myself. Using fresh ingredients was the best part of making it. My husband requested one carrot (diced) and one stalk of celery (diced) which just melted away into the sauce. He also added chopped fresh baby portobella mushrooms. Used fresh basil too. Cooked for at least 4 hours on low simmer. Wonderful sauce.

I looked at this recipe and saw over-reliance on spices, not preparation to allow a good base to integrate the spices. I started by making my own base, mixing 1/2 lb ground pork with 1lb ground beef and 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ground fennel, and 1 tsp ground sage to create a full 1.5 lbs of pork/beef sausage. After this was finished, I drained it and added it to the slow cooker. I added 2 tsps olive oil and added 1/2 cup red red wine, 4 minced garlic cloves, 2 onions, 1 stalk of celery, and 1 carrot. When that had softened, I added that to slow cooker as well and sort of followed the original recipe, skipping the Italian seasoning, but keeping to the rest. It was very good after these different changes.

I really wanted to love this recipe. I followed the recipe to the letter, and was very displeased with the result.  The consistency of the sauce was watery, the meat made the sauce ever so slightly greasy, and the tinny flavor of the canned tomatoes didn't cook out.

I have made this about 4 times now. This is my new favorite spaghetti sauce recipe and the only way I make it now. I usually add a little more italian sausage, but otherwise I stay pretty true to the recipe. It makes a good amount and I love that there's usually enough leftover to make lasagna roll ups or something similar later on in the week so I can eat more of this sauce. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this for the family yesterday and everyone LOVED it!  The only change I made to the recipe was to use crushed tomatoes instead of the diced & stewed.  No one in my family likes chunks of tomatoes (except me!) so I used the crushed. No other changes were made and it was phenomenal!  I did use someone's suggestion to put paper towels over the crockpot and then the lid and this worked great. At the end of the cooking I did put in one more 6 oz. can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce.  This recipe is very good and will be my new go to Spaghetti sauce!!

Awesome and Easy!! Only used one onion. Used 1 large italian link type sausage. Followed all other directions. Quantity was only enough for two large/man size servings and two appetizer servings. Increase the sauce if cooking for two or more people who eat "solid"/large servings.

Good and easy!  Nice to have it in the slow cooker.  Some water gathered on top of the lid during cooking and fell back into the sacue, making it a tad watery, so I started trying to drain the water that collected up there.

My 2 year old LOVED this.  She asked me in the mornings if she could have some!!  My hubby didn't like the chunks of tomatoes, although he liked the flavour, so I may have to fiddle with grinding/ cutting up the stewed tomatoes or just changing them to all diced tomatoes, etc.  Also, I had to fish some of my tomatoes back out after putting them in when I realized that the cans were about double the size of the 14.5 oz cans you mention!!  I assumed they were the right size without checking....good thing I caught that one!!  The sauce did end up being a little watery, so I will drain the tomatoes next time to see if it makes a difference.  Wonderful flavour!!  Thanks :)

Outstanding and So Easy !
 I made a few personal changes by doubling the Italian Sausage , slightly more onion, some diced bell peppers, and 2 small cans of mushroom bits and pieces. The sugar /sweetner amount is a personal preference and its easy to adjust.
This was a delightful recipe that is a favorite of mine.

This was very easy to make. My family wanted it served over nachos which tasted great. I did not have spiced tomatoes so used ordinary tomatoes and added the spice.

What a great way to get the deep, rich flavor of all day sauce.  For those of us who work and don't have all day to stand over the stove, this is a big win! Thanks, Ashley!

This was good; I used a bit more sausage than it called for, so it was a bit more sausagey than I'd like, but that was my own fault. I'm also not a fan of big stewed tomato chunks; next time I'll probably substitute extra diced tomatoes for the stewed. Overall, very flavorful, and I liked knowing what went into my sauce. Leftovers made great lasagna

I left out the sausage due to personal preference.  I added two additional tablespoons of sugar.  I cooked on low for 8 hours as stated but the sauce burned onto the sides of my crockpot and left the sauce with a somewhat burnt taste.  Even so, it was still quite flavorful and everyone else thought it was still better than store bought jarred sauce.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

This recipe was ABSOLUTELY delicious!!! My husband and in-laws are Italian and claim to make the best spaghetti and I am going to challenge them in a spaghetti competition with this one.  I might even substitute boneless pork ribs for the Italian sausage which is what my mother-in-law does.  Thanks for sharing!  Can't wait to make them eat their words :)

I use a full pound of ground sausage and, depending on the audience, switch spicy sausage for the sweet sausage.  Always a hit.

This was tastey! Kept pretty much the same except used real garlic and added mushrooms. I think this sauce also would be great for lasagna. Next time I will cut the cooking time in half. I have a strong crockpot and my meat wasnt as chunky.

I followed this recipe as best I could except I doubled it and used sweet ground Italian sausage and cooked it on the stove all day,  my crock pot died.  I was hesitant to use the sugar because when I tasted it it seemed a little sweet but I tried it anyways and it turned out perfect my kids ate a ton and so did my hubby,  he's even bringing a jar to his single friends house to brat.  Ty Ashley!

I'm not real keen on the sweet of the sausage, I'll probably go for non-sweet next time. Instead of using sugar in the sauce to cut the acidity - get a large carrot, cut the ends off, and clean it well (but don't peel it). Let it simmer in the sauce the entire time the sauce simmers. When you're ready to eat, scoop the carrot out (it might come out in more than one piece, depends on how soft it is) and throw it away. The natural sugars in the carrot cut the acidity, no added sugar needed. Be sure to get rid of the carrot. Don't leave it in the leftovers. Also, just as a side note, I like to add a bit of "Better than Beef Bouillon" to my sauce, which helps to cut the sweetness of the tomato sauce. I really don't like sweet spaghetti sauce. ;-)

I cooked it exactly as it stated. I found the sauce to be rather bland and tasteless. Next time I make it, I will add more sugar and spices.

My go-to recipe for meat sauce! Awesome! I did make one change which was to remove the sausage from the casing and cook it to make it all crumbly. Otherwise made as is and it's always a hit!

I will never buy a jar sauce again. This was wonderful!! I followed the recipe except the sausage I bought was a pound and I threw it all in instead of 1/4 lb. I also added sliced fresh mushrooms in the last hour. Love it and think we are going to make it in bulk and freeze or can for future easy meals.

Yes, I did make some additions, and I think it made this recipe just great !!This is a very good recipe as a base. It was excellent after I substituted fresh garlic,3 cloves, and added 1/4 cup red wine, and  tsp. fennel seed. To make it alot easier, I sauteed the meats, put them in pot,
Sauteed the garlic and onion in same pan, put them in pot. Then I added all the seasonings at once. Then added all the tomato products at once (I used all diced tomatoes, no stewed ones, and I drained them) and added wine last. Cooked on LO for 8 hours. Yummy !!

Thank you for the base and Idea! In the beginning I minced the garlic, chopped white onion, and green pepper, then added the hamburger and browned it. It really sets it off! Thanks for the recipe!

I wanted to like this, but it was way too salty. I left in cooking on low for 12 hours. Maybe I kept it cooking too long.

I haven't tried this recipe, but noticed the objections of the use of sugar.  My grandmother, from Italy, used sugar in her sauce.  On a trip to Italy, Florence, I had a cooking class from the gal that ran our Villa, and she suggested milk to get rid of the acidity from the tomatoes.  I start with a tablespoon, taste, add more if necessary.

Don't balk at the use of sugar! I'm no sugar fiend, but I add a bit of sugar to all of my tomato sauces. It does not add sweetness. Don't leave it out if that is what you're thinking. It just makes the tomatoes taste better. One tablespoon is not a lot. Some of the recipes I see on allrecipes call for CRAZY amounts of sugar. This is not crazy!!!

This is very much like the recipe I've used for years - my aunt was given the recipe by an Italian friend she worked with in California during WWII.  I frequently fix a huge batch of this for a church supper, and have always used loose meat, so I have our local Smokehouse meat store trim well and then coarse grind rump roast for the hamburger - the coarser grind makes it a big thicker and 'chewier' - never thought of using link sausage, will try that next time I make it!  And I've used the "left-overs" to make chili, stuffed shells and etc.  The chili is excellent, just add beans and chili spices and it's very tasty!

I've always used bottled sauce but recently decided that I want to start making something from scratch.  This is the first sauce I tried.  I like that it's done in the crock pot. It's not quite as simple as opening a jar but it's not difficult and it's much, much better.

I made this recipe for a diabetic family, and I left out the sugar. I also used organic tomatoes (paste, sauce, stewed and diced), organic sausage and organic sweet/yellow onion. I added a ton of organic white cap mushrooms and this was awesome! My Aunt was surprised that it tasted a little sweet since she knew I was leaving out the sugar. I do not see a reason or flavor purpose for the olive oil and therefore left that out as well. The onions will sauté in the grease from the sausage just fine. I just started my sausage first and added the onions once there was juice in the skillet.

I had to make a couple of small substitutions and used ground turkey instead of the beef. I added some finely chopped carrots as I usually do to pasta sauce. But in the end, this was the best homemade sauce I've been able to muster. Both my wife and I looked at each other in amazement as we started eating it!

It was GREAT!!  I used sweet Italian sausage out of the casings and the whole house smelled sooo good from it cooking.  My only problem was that I used a larger crock pot and it cooked too fast.  I will use my smaller one in the future and the tip about the paper towel under the lid worked great.

Not as good as everyone says it is.  It was missing something and I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  I had alot left over so I froze it and will use it, but add my own spices to it.  I wasn't impressed.

This is a great sauce, however, for all the dried herbs I used fresh herbs and 2 whole cloves garlic, not powdered. Also, I put 2 tbsp sugar about 10 min before serving.

Excellent flavor and easy version of a "bolognese" style sauce. Followed other recommendations and used two chopped carrots in place of sugar.  This recipe is a keeper!

This sauce is fantastic!!  My husband has been asking me for months to try making a homemade sauce - the jarred ones are just not good!  So this weekend, I made this and couldn't believe how great it tasted!!  This is now the only spagetti sauce I will ever use!!  The next time I make homemade lasagna, I am going to use this sauce!  Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a very good sauce. I freeze some of it for future meals. The sugar is fine especially if the tomatoes are a little tart. I have always added a little to my sauce since my husband likes a sweeter sauce.

I believe the sugar is added to cut the acidic taste of the tomatoes.  My mother and myself always put a pinch to a tomato sauce when cooking.  I can tell you though, it is a good sauce recipe!

This is very similar to my recipe.  I add roasted pork neck bones for even more flavor. I do wrap them in cheese cloth because sometimes little pieces of bone break off while simmering.  I was raised in an italian neighborhood & this is what my neighbor taught me.
Makes for an extra special sauce.

I'm with the recipe creator on this one!  You don't add the sugar for sweetness.  I've been making home made sauce (or gravy as they call it back in some neighborhoods in New York)for most of my life.  You add the small amount of sugar late in the cooking process to cut the acidity of the tomato product.  This is especially true when using canned tomatoes.  I must say that although I had never tried it in a crock pot this is very similar to the recipe I use, and I will definitely be trying it this way from now on.  I also agree with her later comments about using the sweet Italian sausage taken out of the casing and cut into chunks.  Adding fresh mushrooms and peppers is a must for me as well.  Great recipe and useful for many things besides spaghetti!!

100% what we were looking for - a meatier spaghetti sauce.  We did the store bought for awhile, but never liked them and decided to do our own knowing we wanted more meat.  Used ground turkey in place of the beef and left everything else the same.  GREAT sauce.  Double it and put it in our slow cooker and keeps our family of five with sauce for a couple of months at a time.  GREAT flavor/taste!

Easy sauce that tastes as good as in a restaurant! My family doesn't like "chunks" of tomatoes so I pureed the tomatoes in a blender then added with spices as in the receipe. Came out great! This will from now on be our family's spaghetti sauce receipe!

pretty tasty.some reviewers complained it was runny.this is true but it allows the meat to seperate from the sauce a little which I really enjoyed.I will definately make again.1/2 hour prep time makes this easy to get ready in the morning as well.

I gave it a 3 because of the title...this is a tomato lovers sauce for people who like a little meat in it...almost 65 oz of tomatoes and 1 1/4 lb of meat. I used 1 lb of burger and 1 lb of sausage and one less 14 1/2 oz can of stewed tomato and it just made it a meaty sauce. Nice base recipe is alls I'm saying!

Prepared on stovetop instead of slow cooker adding one carrot, grated and 1/2 lb sliced fresh mushrooms after browning the meats. Also omitted the sugar; carrot was sufficient and added the rind from parmigiano reggiano while it cooked. This sauce turned out amazing. EXCELLENT!!

Best meat sauce I've ever made. Substituted Fire Roasted Diced tomatoes for Italian, used 1/2 lb sweet Italian sausage(3 skinned Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausages), and added about 1 lb sliced mushrooms. Also used Sweet Walla Walla onions and omitted the sugar. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was amazing and the kids gobbled it up!  I added shredded carrots, mushrooms, and green peppers.  I used sweet Italian sausage and fire roasted tomatoes.  I did NOT add the sugar.  It was super easy and totally worth it.  We'll be adding this to the weekly menu!

A good recipe, but as others have pointed out, time can be saved by browning both the beef and the sausage together. I also used a minced clove garlic in place of the 1 tsp garlic powder. I didn't understand why the Italian seasoning and marjoram would be added to the browning meat, so I added it instead to the sauce, where it would blend with the other herbs. I also added the sugar at the same time.

this came out great! my mother came over for dinner and actually got a little annoyed at how easy and delicious this recipe came out because she makes the same thing on the stove and it takes all day. also, my 3 year loved this sauce and i was able to cut up the cooked sausage and put it on the side for him so he liked that. will def cook this again.

This was a hit in our house...changes I made: I used fresh garlic instead of powder, used fresh thyme and rosemary because I had them on hand. About 3 and a half hours in, I added two whole garlic gloves, about 3 tablespoons of butter and a half cup of dry red wine to give the sauce more depth. Those measurements are for a serving for four. Also I substituted pancetta for Italian sausage because I ha pancetta in the fridge and it was just delicious!!! Thanks Ashley

Fabulous! My family thought this dish was very tasty. I did use very lean meat so I cannot imagine what it would taste like with a higher fat meat.  Since we eat low-carb in our house I used Ashley's idea about serving it over chicken. I served it over low carb chicken parmesan.  Thanks Ashley!

This is an excellent recipe, even with the sugar. Only had to cook it 6 hours instead of the full 8 hours.

I love this recipe and have been cooking very similar version for years just not in the crock pot.  I also add a pinch of cayenne pepper to add a little zest and gotten rave reviews from all that have tried it.

I made this dish very close to the recipe but was pretty concerned about the amount of tomato sauce used. As it turned out, that was the dominant taste and was quiet unpleasant.

There are a lot of good reviews here, so I get the feeling tomato sauces differ quiet significantly from country to country. If you are from New Zealand I wouldn't recommend this dish without substituting the t/sauce.

Great dish.  I used more sauce than the recipe called for, and of course extra cheese and seasonings (garlic/onion powders and Italian spice mix), but this is how I always cook.  The most awesome thing about this spaghetti dish was that my two young grandsons BOTH ate it-  ages 2 and 4; all moms/Grammy's know how picky this age group are!  I was pleased, grown ups loved it too!   Will definitely keep in my recipe favorites and make again.

I added a half a pound of Italian sausage instead of 1/4 and I think Next time I will make it with 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef instead of 1 pound. I love that is was easy and no fuss by cooking in a crockpot. No sauce splattered all over the stove was a plus!! This is not your typical "Italian way of making sauce but I liked it! and my son loved it!!

EASY, and SO good!!!  I have 2 guys I cook for weekly.  We hadn't had spaghetti in quite a while, so I thought this would be a welcome entree.  BOTH guys like their meat, so I wanted to prepare a sauce that was meaty, but easy to do.  This recipe could not have fit the bill better!  So easy to prep, and let your slow-cooker do the rest.

I did make a couple of changes.  I used 1 lb lean burger + 1/2 lb spicy Italian sausage links.  I cut the links into bite-sized pieces.  This added more 'chunk' to the sauce.  Also, I used 7 large, chopped garlic cloves, in the slow-cooker, vs garlic powder.  
7 large chopped cloves of garlic, in the cooker, vs more garlic powder.  

AWESOME!!!

Made this exactly as directed minus the marjoram and the sugar. It was incredible. Incredibly meaty, robust, tonnnns of flavor. When it comes to pasta sauce the thicker the better for me and this one is a keeper!!! Amazing recipe! Thank you!

What a great recipe! My dad makes amazing homemade sauce and this definitely rivals his :) I did only a few things differently because of lack of time & ingredients; I only used 1lb ground meat (turkey) and added three small-medium green peppers (chopped into smaller pieces). I already had browned meat in the fridge so I put that and all the spices and ingredients in together then mixed well. I also omitted onions and added 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic as we love garlic. Another good tip for slow cooking is use liners; I didn’t believe how easy they were to use until I tried them! Very easy cleanup and it doesn’t detract from the cooking process at all. My family LOVED this sauce and it made enough to have plenty of leftovers for meals during the week. Next time I make this recipe, I will likely still omit sausage but use 2-3lb ground meat and simmer the spices while cooking the meat. I

This is a great recipe! 

I lower the calories by using ground low-fat turkey instead of beef, canola spray instead of olive oil, shiritake (tofu) noodles instead of pasta, and Splenda instead of sugar. When I have fresh basil or oregano, I add roughly chopped leaves.

I have a dozen or so slow cooker spaghetti sauce recipes. This one is without a doubt my favorite. I typically make it the day before and let it sit in the refrigerator at least 24 hours before serving. I add fresh mushrooms and a little less sugar but otherwise keep the recipe as posted.

I'm a retired househusband that does most of the  2 person meals these days. I make a great skillet spegittl but it's really messy. First time for a Crock-Pot sauce recipe and I hit a winner the first time . Don't think I'll be dragging out the skillets anymore. This was great tasting .Less messy and easy to make.

This was easy and delicious as is. I wanted to double it but was lazy so just used 2.25lb beef and 1lb ground Italian sausage . Sweet sausage would've been better so will try that next time like the author of this recipe suggested. I doubled all the ingredients plus added a jar of spaghetti sauce to compensate for extra lb of beef. I didn't have enough garlic powder used 2tsp plus a roasted bulb in the oven and added that. The whole bulb did not make the sauce taste garlicky at all. I used fresh thyme because I had it. Fresh basil at the end would be awesome next time but as I said it was delicious as written. Before serving I mixed some with noodles and dotted the top with one torn up slice of mozzarella and topped with parmesan. They loved it. I would have liked to add some mushrooms and olives and red pepper flakes but the kids would not like that. Definitely will make this again. I cannot wait to try it the next day!

Very good recipe. I followed to recipe exact, with the exception of the meat. I used 1 LB of ground beef and a 12 oz package of ground Italian sausage (I like a lot of meat). As it cooked it started to thicken up a little to much so I added a splash of red wine. Thanks for the recipe, I will be making it again.

If you do not think sugar is in spaghetti sauce,just look at the sugar content in most grocery store brands. At least this way YOU control the amount if any sugar.

Delish!  I am in my 60's and usually eat only my own spaghetti sauce.  Due to work commitments I decided to get my pasta fix via my crock pot.  Oh my gosh was this good. Not a whole lot different than my own sauce. Made exactly according to recipe.  Consistency of sauce was perfect. Flavor just right. An added bonus was on a cold rainy foggy night, I came home to a delicious hot meal. Pasta is my favorite comfort food. ??

Not a lot of meat for the amount of tomato products. Did not add sugar. Also, adjust the amount of seasonings.  What's called for is pretty skimpy.  We like all Italian sausage rather than hamburger.

Amazing sauce. I used ground turkey and sausage.....only because that's what I had. I also blended the tomatoes and the onions together to make a puree then added it to the sauce (did not saute the onion just pureed it) I did this because I was cooking for 3 kids who have a texture problam when it comes to vegetables in their food. It still came out great and everyone loved it.

I thought this was a great recipe. Easy to make and smelled delicious whilst slow cooking. I added a bit of water at the end because it got pretty thick. I agree with others-you can tailor this with more or less meat or different kinds. Tasted great with some Italian  parmesan or provolone on top!

Really a hearty meat sauce  & a meat sauce it is! I added considerably more seasoning and added rosemary generously. Couldn't find bulk sausage so used Italian sweet sausage (chicken) removing  the casings. I set the slow cooker for the time called for and went on to bed. The slow cooker cut its self off at designated time and kept it on warm the rest of the night. Next morning I could hardly wait to sample it. (Which I did even before coffee.) It was perfect! Because I had slept late I had it like an early brunch on a warm sesame seed bun with a little parmesan cheese. Fabulous way to start a week end.  (It was a breeze to clean as it did not stick to the slow cooker)

Good recipe.  As written it gets 4 stars from me.  I would give 5 stars with the add-ons I did.  I added 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes in place of tomato sauce, 2 1/2 t. minced garlic, chopped green peppers, and 1 more can tomato sauce.  We like this over angel hair pasta.

I will never buy premade spaghetti sauce again.  This is easy to put together and cooks so well in the slow cooker.  It's a good recipe that you can easily change up by adding different ingredients.  I highly recommend this recipe!!!

This sauce is absolutely amazing! My husband is 100% Italian who grew up in a home (in Australia) where his mother grows her own veggies, has chickens and every Saturday would make a massive pot of sauce. He told me this sauce is wonderful, if not better than what his Mamma makes - just don't tell her! Tastes so good and do cook it for hours - blends the flavors and brings out the taste. My all time go to pasta sauce!

I surely enjoyed this recipe -   it smelled like an Italian restaurant all day.   Could not wait to dig in and it did not disappoint.    I made it as directed though I left out sugar - don't care for a sweet sauce.   Thank you for this go to recipe

Made this yesterday. My husband and I both liked it very much. I am on a low sodium diet so I used no salt added tomatoes and salt. I upped the seasonings and I used minced garlic to replace some of the garlic powder. I just added it to the skillet while browning the hamburger. Enough for leftovers and a container in the freezer. The hardest part was smelling it cooking all day! I don't mind the sugar in tomato sauce, I did decrease it though.

Excellent recipe! Adding in peppers, carrots and mushrooms just stretched it a bit. The little bit of sugar is something Old School cooks have done for years, it cuts the acid from the tomatoes. Using ground turkey and turkey sausage works really well!

My family and I loved this recipe.  The only changes I made were to add minced garlic and a splash of red wine to the ground beef while I was browning it. I did not use sausage as I didn't have any, but instead I added another 1/2 pound of ground beef. I added green peppers and fresh mushrooms which I sauteed with the onions, and also added garlic to this mixture.  Once in the slow cooker I added another splash of wine and then just let it cook for about 6 hours...It was fantastic!  Wonderful blend of flavors! I wish I had made more to freeze!

This sauce was good. The taste made it seem like there was supposed to have some sort of chili bean included. It did make enough for a few meals. So I will freeze the rest, but probably not make again.

I had this for dinner last nigh and it was delicious.  I did a couple things differently, I used oregano instead of marjoram (did not have any) and used sausage links - mix of hot and sweet- took the casing off and cut into small pieces.  I cooked the meats and onion the night before and added them to the tomato mixture and let it sit in the fried overnight.  Yesterday afternoon I put I on the crockpot and put it on low for close to 5 hours.  Served with spaghetti and garlic bread.  Rave reviews!  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make this again.

I'm not a big pasta sauce fan, my the better half is.  He loved it and has asked for me to make it again.    This recipe leaves ample room for tweaking.  I used minced garlic when browning the ground beef and cut back on the onion so that I could add green pepper.  Did not use the sugar and added some more basil and oregano - just a personal preference.

easy to put together and the finished product was delicious.  I used what I had on hand: Italian sweet turkey sausage, threw in the remainder of a jar of pasta sauce to equal the amount of tomato products used in the recipe, then let it cook on low all day. The aroma alone was worth the effort.  I took time to caramelize the onions with the teaspoon of sugar rather than adding it in at the end of the cooking time.  If I'd had any meat bones left over I'd have thrown them in too. I thought it was interesting that the sauce was adequately seasoned considering you don't add any salt, it's all in the canned tomato products.  This is going to be my staple homemade sauce.

Very nice meat sauce.  I used fresh garlic and skipped the powder but otherwise followed the recipe.  Definitely a keeper.  I think this would be great "puttanesca style" with the addition of a couple of anchovies, capers and red pepper.

To those "foodies" complaining of the addition of sugar:  sugar is universally used to balance the acidity in tomato-based sauces and adds only 50 calories to the whole sauce.  Not nearly enough to get upset about.

This recipe is an old standard but is very tasty. Anyone can tweak it by exchanging sugar for sugar substitute, as well as adding a pinch of dried red pepper and two dashes of regular hot sauce, like Red Hott or your favorite brand, which will give a pleasant background but not overtaking the great taste of the sauce. Once your tomato product is in your cooking device, then go ahead and add what seasonings you like as well as the sugar. All additions should be added immediately after the tomato products are in.
As Ashley suggests, placing the sausage into the sauce does add a great flavor. This can be done by adding the sausage, whole in casings, directly into the sauce letting the sausage cook within the sauce and sharing it's flavors throughout the sauce. IF you use the sausage, I would question using the beef as well as you take away from the original sauce flavor and overpower it with the meats battling it out for the distinctive flavor, which should always the the sauce first, meat as a compliment to the sauce. 
Either way you choose, it's a delicious sauce and well worth the time to wait until it's thoroughly cooked.

We love this recipe; so simple, so tasty! I'll often add a splash (or few) of red wine in there with the sugar. I used it on a meat lovers pizza to rave reviews too.

Family likes it! Substituted 1/4cup wine for sugar, sautéed onion and beef in pot drained off the fat then added the sauces and seasonings. Used crushed tomatoes with thick purée instead of chopped tomato and stewed tomatoes. Let simmer on the stove about 40 min to 1 hour. Have made it with and without sausage.

Great sauce. Used ground turkey instead of beef and added chopped bell pepper and mushrooms plus 1 table spoon each, black pepper, chili powder and a few shakes of Tapatio brand hot sauce. Came out great with just a touch of spice.

I dunno, I made the recipe as directed, but it just wasn't a good recipe for me. The sauce was rather watery and didn't have an appealing taste. I'm keeping my family's spaghetti and meatballs recipe.

This is good but not great.  I added shredded carrots, doubled the sausage, and 2 tsp brown sugar at the end instead of white.  Also cooked on high 4 hours.  Likely better on low for 8.  Will make again.

Great Receipe....I always add a pinch of brown sugar and a few semi-sweet chocolate chips as well as worschershire sauce.  I simmered for approx. 4 hrs. and this was perfect!  Adding a few tablespoons of vinegar also reduces the acidity. Thanks for this one!!

Instead of sugar I always add a few carrots to  my slow cooker sauce.  It adds flavor and cuts acidity.  I try to remove them before serving but is not necessary.  Family liked this very much and I used linked sausage.

Foodie here and I love this recipe...
For the nay sayers on the sugar I tried the sugar and my usual shredded carrots...
As other reviews have stated and chefs they add a bit of sugar as a counter to the acidity of tomatoes...
The tastes are similar except with the carrots your getting additional vitamins not trying to turn this healthy ??

Made this using some carrots, celery, and bell peppers. Added more seasonings than it called for. I will be making this again, it is really good. I will spray oil inside containers before freezing as another reviewer advised.

I made it and letting it sit until tomorrow. I added about an 1/8 cup of Worcestershire sauce. That's the only thing I changed.  It gets four stars for now until I taste it, however, I'm sure it's an easy five star. Smells absolutely delicious.

I have made this sauce several times and it never fails. There are two things that I do differently.  One is, I don't add sugar to the sauce. Two, I cook the sauce in my stockpot. I let it simmer on a very low heat for several hours and this makes for a delicious pasta sauce. This is my mom's favorite spaghetti sauce.

Absolutely delicious. Reminds me of my Italian grandmother's recipe. Whoever says sugar isn't necessary is wrong. It cuts the acidity and makes everything balanced. I am making it again for the family for sure.

A good sauce mix!
The recipe is missing a lot of garlic  so I put in  5-6 cloves worth. 
Also not "meat-lover" enough for me,. so added more ground beef and sausage.   And included a slightly smokey beef sausage (12 kinks because double recipe)

This is a great recipe but I personally put two peeled carrots whole in the sauce and omit sugar. It takes the acidity away so you don’t need sugar!  People love my sauce

This is a great recipe and with it I made the best spaghetti I've ever had.  But as incredible as it probably sounds, I think I might make a little improvement on it.  And even more incredible, I'm a bachelor cooking by my instincts alone!  My idea is simple:  Substitute one or two raw carrots for the processed sugar and mix it in with everything else at the start.  Also add one fresh green bell pepper cut anyway you want and a couple of sliced raw mushrooms (chop out clumps, not thin slices).  The carrot(s) and pepper will add natural sweetness, texture, and nutrition, and the pepper will also add a little bit of a hot kick and color as well ;)

I blended the tomatoes and paste to make a less chunky sauce. It was wonderful. I also used a full pound of sausage along with the beef, and omitted (forgot) the sugar. I'll definitely be making it again and I'm saving this one!

This was pretty close to what I make. The only difference is that I get about three handfulls of live basil and chopped garlic  and sear at the very begining. The rest of the recipe looks pretty spot on...

My husband said our home smelled like an Italian restaurant when he walked in. I made this without any meat since I was serving meatballs and spaghetti. Delicious made just as the recipes says. Put it on the crockpot on low from 8-3. Keeping the recipe.

I was actually surprised with the results of this recipe. I thought I would give it a try just for the heck of it. After cooking the Italian sausage, I processed it several seconds with a blender so it resembled taco meat. This made the sauce very thick. The called for amount of sugar was just enough for my taste. When I took my first taste test, I was delighted. I will make this again.

My family loves the sauce!  I doubled it once and it ended up a little more runny than I like it.  I just mixed in a little corn starch and it was perfect!  I do use regular ground Italian (mild) sausage.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. 
 The next time I make it, I'm going to try the sweet sausage recommended by the original poster.  Try it, you'll like it!

I make this at least once a week. I add more ground meat another pound, one to two cups of red wine depending on my mood and sliced mushrooms. This is a great slow cooker recipe.

This was delicious!  Because of my husband's particular tastes, I left out the olive oil and used a pound of Jimmy Dean ground sausage rather than a quarter pound of the bulk Italian sausage.  Not quite an equal swap on the calories, but hey, you do what you can. :) Everything else I kept the same. The spices were spot on.  I served it over zucchini in a weak effort to be healthy, and we didn't even miss the noodles.  Go figure!  My husband requested that I put it on the rotation, which rarely happens. My compliments, Ashley!!

This is the best spaghetti sauce I've ever had in my life! A few changes I made: I did not use the recommended meat, but substituted meatballs. I also made this in my slow cooker, and added cooked onions and garlic.

I very much like thed sauce and it was well received by my wife which is high praise in itself. I would just change a thing or too in the prep phase.  Cut up and put the sausage in the pan first without the onions.  My sausage never got brown and it was hard to break up with all in onions around them.  Rather than use garlic power I prefer  to use fresh. Add to the recipe "garlic power or n number of cloves". I might bump up the seasoning amounts a little my thought being wow only a 1/4 teaspoon for this big pot of stuff.

Spaghetti sauce turned out great. I did not have Italian diced tomatoes are Italian  tomato sauce so I doubled the spices added some red chili flakes and whole fresh garlic; two large clubs! The flavor was delicious; rich and hearty. I froze the leftovers for next weeks camping trip.

At least as good as a gluten free jarred sauce, not quite as thick and meaty as momma used to make, but the fact that my wife can safely eat it with minimal changes despite her many allergy concerns puts it at five stars!

Rather than tomato *sauce* we used tomato juice and doubled the amount,  we skipped the sausage and replaced it with a bit of bacon, no onion, and substituted 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of a tiny bit of white. 

I enjoy it, my wife is over the moon as her regular menu is quite bland or repetitive, and we will DEFINITELY be making this again!

Wow.  Definitely a repeat keeper recipe.  I don’t consider myself to be cook, much less a good one.  However, it came out fantastic.  I made this sauce with 1 pound of whole Italian sausage and about 1.5 pounds of ground beef.  I used two sprigs of fresh thyme, and 4 large cloves of garlic because that’s what I had available.  If you use the whole sausage links, you can make a sausage sandwich with the leftover sauce.  I highly recommend this.  The slow cooker process worked great.  I even shortened the time to 4 hours by increasing the heat.  If I can make it and it comes out this good, anyone can.  Just Do it.  Thank you for sharing this, Ashley.

I added mushrooms which I liked but made it a little watery, herbs were a little strong for my wife, thought the sausage broke down and felt a little over cooked than I expected, didn’t see a need for eight hours in the cooker. But overall tasty and good.

Excellent recipe.  I did not have sausage but did the same thing another reviewer did and added some vegetables to the sauce such as carrots, zucchini, and spinach.  Great recipe and one that I will make again.

Followed the recipe and loved the flavors that developed, I used only 1 tablespoon of sugar and found that the sauce tasted amazing. Will definitely be making this often

My mother-in-law used this recipe and it turned out really good.  It freezes well too, so be sure to have some small containers on hand to freeze small batches to thaw for later.

made this spaghetti just like the recipe called for. It was very very good. When i make it again I might try to cut in half and use the full recipe for special gatherings. Makes a lot of sauce for sure.

This recipe was very easy as I had most of the ingredients already. It is packed with flavor and is hearty.  I didn’t have tomato paste so I added mashed cannelli beans instead which worked out really wel.

I did add a little more sugar.  We loved the sauce, but we do like a bit more sausage so I added up to a pound and it is nice and thick.  Some friends left their ?? with us for the weekend, and I made the sauce and sent some it home with them... will try to remember to send you what they think...... Lulus mom

I love this spaghetti sauce! I wasn't in the mood for a meat sauce so replaced the meat portion with sauteed shrimp and it was delicious!

This is my go to sauce when preparing dinner for family and friends. I also found that it doesn't need to be done in a slow cooker. I make this sauce on the stove top. Once all the ingredients are added, I simmer for 20 to 30 minutes and it is ready for serving.

I loved this sauce!  I made a few changes.  I used 2 cloves of garlic and sauteed them with the onion.  And still used 1/2 tsp garlic salt.  I used 1/2 lb of Italian Sausage instead of 1/4 lb.  Also, because my family doesn't really like tomatoes I used my immersible blender and pureed them a bit.  Simmered all day on the stove instead of the crock pot.  Picky kids liked it too so that always makes it a winner!

Excellent recipe and the longer, the better is so true.  Coked mine over 2.5 days, used fresh garlic and upped some of the other spices, but that's for personal preferences.  Also doubled the recipe and froze in several freezer bags.  This soooo meaty and good!

here's  explanation for adding sugar to any spaghetti sauce - sugar cuts the tomato acid for those of us with stomach/gerd problems.
sugar, regardless, should be added to any tomato based slow-cokker recipe to cut the long cooking sauce acidity.
try it, u'll  like  it from my son, chef Mike

You have to have some sugar in the sauce or else it's a little to tangy, but maybe if you like it that way .  . . .

Very good!  I have my own recipe that I like but sometimes like to try others.   Regarding someone's comment on the sugar, the sugar is necessary to cut the acidity - otherwise the sauce would be too sour.   As you mentioned, grated carrots work well for that too.   I do use chopped garlic instead of the powder.   Also add a little more meat (mixture of hot and sweet sausage along with the ground beef).    Thanks for sharing!

So easy and incredibly tasty! Make it the day before,  I had some as leftovers the day after I cooked it and it was even better. Could not find Italian sausage here on Australia so I just added chorizo instead.

This is everyone’s favorite spaghetti sauce in our house.  The ONLY change that I make is that I do not care for ground beef so I use ground Italian sausage and then I slice up sweet Italian sausage links.  TIP:  you can brown the meat with the onions in advance so, on the morning you plan to put it in the crockpot, you can just dump everything in and go.   It truly is the most amazing sauce.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe.  This one has saved me on many crazy weeks when I have no time to get dinner on the table.  A quick boiling of noodles (veggie noodles are great with this) and garlic bread toasting and we are at the table within half an hour of walking in the door.

Used hot italian sausage and no beef (just preference), and it came out really well.  Added green pepper to the mix too.  I actually didn't buy the correct tomato cans at the store and only ended up with a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes and the tomato paste.  I added all of the spice in and even with the missing tomato cans it was delicious!  Very flavorful with what ended up being double the spice, but we liked it.  PLENTY of sauce for about 8-10 servings still.  Loved the recommendation from another reviewer to add a towel under the crockpot lid (to reduce water condensation) and will be using that again for other recipes.

I always do a crockpot recipie once a week so that I always have a go-to meal.  I liked the reciple and made it last week.  It is chunky and very tasty.  I doubled the herbs because I like more flavor.  I also added a jar of marinara sauce with basil because I didn't have the exact amounnt of each tomato canned suggested.  I reheated it tonight, added a little more oilive oil, plated it with extra parmesean cheese and it was delicious.  I will freeze the remainder for another day.

I’ve made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe as written but added fresh garlic instead of powder (because it was sitting on my counter top). My husband called it the best sauce I’ve ever made, and even though he says that every time I make sauce (Gotta love that man!) I agree! It was delicious. After a couple of days of letting it sit in the fridge I went to use it again and found that it was a bit too sweet for my taste, so the second time I made it I cut the sugar by half. It’s every bit as good. An easy and delicious recipe that makes enough for several servings.

I did it without the sugar and it was amazing.  Also, I didn't brown the sausage separately from the ground beef.  I did the beef, onions, and relevant spices all in the same pan and then added them to the slow cooker.  I see no reason to do them separately when they are all going to simmer together for eight hours.

This was a great recipe, so tasty! I did change it a little, I didn't use a slow cooker because I was making it for dinner the same night but it still came out tasting amazing. I added mushrooms. It came out very meaty and so good, my husband said it was his favorite spaghetti so far. I didn't add as much sugar as it suggested and it still came out a little sweeter than I would've wanted it. I think I will leave that out next time, otherwise, great recipe!

I've made this several times and each time it was delicious.  Love the Italian sausage and the sugar makes it just the right sweetness.

I used two 28 oz cans of diced tomatoes, a 14 oz of tomato sauce and small tomato paste.  This is a great recipe, thick with meat and very flavorful  I would make it again.

This is an amazing easy sauce to make. I stick with the recipe as stated and used sweet Italian sausage taken out if the casing. This will be in my arsenal of repeat recipes.

I find there is enough sugar in canned tomato products (too much actually) so I never add the sugar at the end.  I also 
reverse the amounts on sausage and ground beef,  using 1 lb of Italian sausage to up to 1/2 lb beef.  I also add carrots, mainly to increase the vegetable consumption for my grandchildren.   It's easy and quick to make and freezes well.   My 6 year old grandson can't get enough.  It is becoming a family favorite.

I just put a tad of sugar...not a tablespoon. I was always taught a  touch of sugar helps keep the acidity of the tomato down.
I love this recipe and have made it many many times. Freezes nicely. I also just use whatever spices I have. I don't often have majoram around

I made this about a year ago for the first time. Now that's all we have. I even have a friend bring over her crockpot so I can make her a batch also. I've made it with both ground beef and ground venison. Both are great.

Very good and very easy. I used 3/4 lb. each of hamburger and sweet italian sausage, only because it was easier to purchase in those quantities at the store. Will definitely make this again. I might double some of the spices, but overall this was very very good.

This is EXCELLENT!!  I didn't have the large can of tomato sauce so I used a large can of diced tomatoes.  I also used garlic instead of the garlic powder and fresh herbs instead of dried!!  The flavor was rich and delicious..  There was some leftover Cabernet in the cabinet so I through in about a half a cup.

Perfectly seasoned !!! Delicious tasty sauce for spaghetti or stuffed shells.  I use the large can of Italian season diced tomatos rather than the smaller can...I also drain some of the juice off the tomatoes to create a thicker sauce

Just a few minor changes for personal taste, but mostly stuck to their recipe.  ( Used brown sugar) Don't think I can EVER get store bought again!  Really easy AND delicious!  I make enough to freeze!  Might need a bigger freezer. . .

My husband  had two huge plate fulls, he loved it!
Took a couple suggestions: I added meat ( .5 hamb. .5 turkey, 1/4 ground Italian sweet sausage) to cooked onions and added 3 cloves chopped garlic. Added 3/4 cup Merlot wine to meat after done cooking let it sit on low 10 min. Added 1/4 fresh parsley.
To the sauce I didn't have the Italian tomatoes but I thawed out  half 14 oz can tomatoes put some Italian spices in it and half can Rotell and put Italian spice in it (it just needed a smig in each) added the rest of the recipe then added can of mushrooms, but next time would go wth fresh ones it was soooo
Good, also for extra kick I added a almost table spoon of red flake chili peppers.  The sugar I added at the begining and I put in 1 tsp 1/2 tsp as I don't like a real sweet sauce yet I like to cut the acid.
One last note: i took a towel to solve the watery prob and put it over the top of the food (the crock po top) covered the lid over the top. For me my towel barely got wet and the lid did sweat, I'm so thankful for that persons review, I'll remb that trick! This is the BEST spaghetti sauce I've ever made it will be my go to one from now ON!

AWESOME! My first real spaghetti sauce and I am loving it! I had to substitute Italian Seasoning with Season-All, garlic powder with garlic salt and real garlic cloves, and I added about 2 more Tbsp of sugar bc it was pretty acidic based on the pungent tomato smell--the extra sugar made it more delicious, not gross-sweet like some may think.  My 2 toddlers love it, too and they're pretty picky eaters! Will make it again definitely!

Delicious and easy to make!

This is a good go-to for cooking big batches. Although we have a small family, I have plenty of use for it--I freeze it in smaller batches for use later, take it to potlucks, give it to friends when there's a new baby or the death of a loved one. Great recipe--meaty, tomato-ey, seasoned just right.

It was good, but I didn't LOVE the sausage in it. I have made another sauce from this site that we liked better. Like the idea of the crock pot though. So, maybe with a few changes, I will try this again.

My family really liked this sauce!!  I made this sauce yesterday...I feel I made this sauce exactly as written substituting ground turkey ( 1 lb.)for ground beef and sweet Italian turkey sausage for bulk...I used 2- 1/2 links, casing removed (was a perfect amount); other than that, exact.    It was of perfect consistency in the crock pot.  It needs addn'l seasoning and fresh garlic, but that's all personal preference.  It made a lot...enough that I tossed it with the uneaten noodles and had a medium sized bowl filled with sauce only.  Will definitely make again using more seasoning, including fresh added when done, since I grow fresh thyme & basil.  By using turkey ( I don't eat gr. beef, italian or bulk sausage) I found it comforting & tasty without heaviness.  Thanks for sharing :)))

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding green peppers and mushrooms, just a personal preference and really doesn't change the flavor. This is a great recipe, used it to make lasagna and froze some as it makes quite a bit and there is just my husband and myself. Someone made a comment about the sugar, if you are a cook you would understand that sugar is added to tomato based sauces to cut the acid in the tomatoes. This is a standard practice that in general anyone who cooks would know. In any case loved it, definitely added to my favorites and will make again.

I made this and it taste great. My husband likes it without the sugar added, however I did add a little sugar to cut down the acidity for myself. It is so easy to make I love it. This is a keeper.

OMG this is perfect pasta sauce. I followed the recipe except for very minor changes. I used 2 hot Italian sausage links, approx. 6oz, with casing removed, and reduced the ground beef to 3/4 lbs. so it was the same amount of meat. I added 3 cloves minced garlic to Italian sausage mixture. I used regular tomato sauce and stewed tomatoes, since that's what was in the pantry. I also reduced the sugar to 2 tsps. I don't have a slow cooker so I used a Dutch oven and simmered on stove top approx. 3hrs. Absolutely perfect. Thank you Ashley for this recipe. I will never have to buy sauce for any of my pasta recipes again. (Thanks to the commenter who suggested the towel under the lid.  It really helped to absorb the steam which would have thinned the sauce.)

Instead of adding sugar at the end of the cook time, I put a whole carrot chopped in two in the sauce at the beginning, The carrot contains natural sugars and sweetens the sauce. My boys would always fight over who got the carrot.

Great recipe. My two cents...the recipe doesn't specify the type of ground beef. I use regular and then spoon it out allowing a bit of the fat but discard the majority. I find the extra fat when browning enhances the flavour. I also bump up the garlic, but that's just personal preference. Overall a great and versatile pasta sauce recipe.

Sauce was great. For those who don't know sugar is put in sauces to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.

Very similar to mine but I cook the onions (and fresh chopped garlic, green peppers and mushrooms) with the meat in the microwave drain all the grease off before proceeding.

I made the recipe exactly except didn't have sausage - used extra ground beef instead.
Sauce was pretty bland.  Won't bother making this again.

Good.  I reduced sugar by half, and that was still too sweet for us.  Will go down to 1/2 teaspoon next time.  I liked this, but I'll move on to try other recipes before settling on favorite.  I did drain tomatoes, and it wasn't too soupy.

I'm very particular about my spaghetti sauces, and I liked that I could make this in the cooker for later. I changed up on the ingredients by adding 1 diced sweet green bell pepper when cooking the Italian sausage and onions. And used New York Style Sausage Company, "Roasted Bell Pepper and Caramelized Onion Sausage"  in place of the Italian sausage it turned out fantastic in my opinion!

Made this today and loved it. Had to tweak it just a little because of my families preferences. Didn't use the carrots because my crew wouldn't eat sauce with carrots (you've gotta love the power of a 4&5 year old on your cooking) and I skipped the cheese at the end because I was out. It was still delicious, and I would use it again!

I used 1 tablespoon of agave nectar syrup instead of sugar. Added sautéed mushrooms, onions, and diced green + red pepper. Amazing sauce.

Loved this dish and have made it several times.  I think the entire 29oz can of tomato sauce was more than necessary and yields a very 'liquidy' sauce.  So I wound up using half the can, and still strained some of the more 'watery' liquid in the sauce for a chunkier sauce. I also used 4 fresh garlic cloves INSTEAD of the garlic powder.  Also I think for the next time, I will use half the sugar as well. But other than that, it was delicious!

Delicious. Comforting.  I didn't have sausage.  Would have been better with the combo, but was fabulous without. Slightly tart, but I added some undrinkable (although sweet) red wine to the mix, so maybe that's why.  On scorching, I put sugar in at the start. I was on low the whole 8 hours, actually more like 11, and didn't have any scorching...

I normally don't leave reviews here because I don't have a lot of time, but I DO try MANY recipes from this site.
This spaghetti sauce is fabulous! The only thing I did differently was to add some veggis that I sauted first and I didn't have the tomato paste so I had to leave it out. My daughter, who loves spaghetti and always has to have Ragu sauce, said this was the best spaghetti she'd ever had. I'm glad because I control what goes in this sauce and it is much healthier than jarred sauce if you use turkey or chicken sausage and lean ground beef. My thanks to Ashley for sharing this with us!

The BF didn't like it all that much, but only because I used 90% lean meat, and he hates it. lol I, personally, really liked it and will make it again! I did tweak a few things, however. I didn't use the olive oil at all. I used brown sugar sausage, and cooked the beef and sausage together, then added the onions and 2 cloves of minced garlic. I also used brown sugar instead of white (which I also doubled), and subbed one of the diced tomatoes for a can of fire roasted tomatoes, and I threw a bay leaf in there as well. We prefer a sweeter sauce, and next time I would actually probably add a little more brown sugar, or maybe I will try it with white. But overall, a very good sauce that can easily be tweaked to fit anyone's preferences!

I added about 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1/2 tbsp soy sauce, and a few dashes of worcestershire sauce.

This is almost exactly like the recipe that I was using already, which I didn't really realize until I was putting it all in the crock pot. Why it never occurred to me before I don't know, so thanks for the nudge in the right direction!

made this recipe as written, only I used 3/4 pound of Italian sausage as I had to use it up...got a late start making this, so cooked in the crock for 6 hours, then simmered the next day for an hour and 20 minutes on the stove..this was delicious!  made the house smell amazing too! sauce was thick and meaty, and even my Grand daughter loved it! froze a quart for another meal..

I liked that although many ingredients were canned or dried, it still tasted fresh!  Simple to make, and I followed the recipe, except I didn't have marjoram so I omitted it.  Thank you for sharing a simple but tasty recipe, I will make this again!

I might rate this twice so I could give it 10 stars!  It yields a pretty big batch, but that was great too because I ended up making lasagna out of it which was amazing, and then the next day I cut up a leftover steak and made a steak sandwich with provolone topped with this sauce.  This has become my favorite recipe!

This is a great recipe!  I used the recommendation to use Italian sausage links (I peeled off the skin and probably used 3/4 lb because I love sausage).  I also blended the stewed and diced tomatoes before adding because no one in my family is a huge fan of large chunks of tomato.  Added a half jalapeno for a little spice and the result, YUMMY!  Oh..and I didn't have any Italian seasoning so I just doubled oregano, basil and thyme and added a little parsley.  Still tasted great. 
I agree sugar isn't that great for you but it is a staple in spaghetti sauce for this family at least.  It's one table spoon in a huge pot of sauce.  I say skip the cookie and and enjoy the sauce!!

Tastes great and easy to make. Love that you can stick it all in the crock pot on your way out and come home to a slowly simmered sauce!

good, only twist I added was a small amount of frozen fresh hot peppers during the onion and sausage prep.

This recipe the very similar to what I have been using for years.  And, yes, I put sugar in it too.  My grandmother told me many years ago to add a pinch of sugar to all tomato based dishes to "cut the bite."

I had to change some of the spices based on what I had on hand. I also used more meat so I had to add some more tomato paste and crushed tomatoes. Overalll a really good sauce. I can't wait to make again.

If you need to make the sauce in a crock pot this is a good recipe but not spectacular.
