A decent recipe. But I found it lacking.  It needs more sugar. I used the full can of milk. Didn't want any to go to waste.  So, I doubled the sugar and then some. I still think it needs more.  Some recipes call for a cup.  It did not specify how long to simmer. After 10 minutes it was still quite runny so I added a tablespoon of cornstarch dissolved in a tiny bit of almond milk make it thicker. I did have to stir it into the rice to coat evenly.  Overall, an okay taste.  But, will seek out a dif recipe next time.
