I made this for dinner tonight and both my boyfriend and I loved it!  I gave it a mexican flare by leaving out the soy sauce and putting this delicious combo in tortillas with a little shredded cheese and lettuce! I will definitely be making this again, so tasty and very healthy!

Awesome recipe! I made as directed but added the jerk seasoning as suggested by another reviewer. In addition I chopped a green pepper and lightly stir fried it with the onion so it wasn't too mushy. This added color and another veggie and tasted great too. I also sprinkled a little tobasco on top of my dish, 'cause I like it extra spicy. A nice recipe for a quick weeknight dinner - the whole family loved it!

Very yummy recipe as is, but if you're used to strong flavors, you may want to add more seasonings.  As we have two small children, neither of whom like shrimp, I actually used about 1/2 lb of shrimp and 2 chicken breasts cut into 1" cubes.  For some extra flavor I added approx. 2-3 Tablespoons of Jerk seasoning, which went really well with this recipe.  Family loved it, 4 yr old, 17 month old and finicky husband!  Extremely easy to make and will be in with our regular rotation.  Also good the next day as leftovers.

I loved it.  My husband and I almost ate the whole thing ourselves.  It's very tasty, but not too hot!  Perfect for my tastes.

HUGE HIT but don't forget to cut the tails off the shrimp (i forgot) My family love it i did add some stuff because i felt it wouldn't have been enough vegies...I added fresh green beans little over 1 cup, 1/2 cup of bean sprouts, and small can of water chestnuts i just but these things in with the onions. Turned out great and low in calories!

This dish is very colorful and easy to make, plus it does have a good taste, but it felt like something was missing... more salt? Not sure

Nope. Won't make this again. Almost had a bitter taste and I had to doctor it up with some sugar, plum sauce, etc. to make it palatable.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe! We make it often because it is healthy, quick, and it tastes great! I pretty much follow the directions except I add a little bit of carribean jerk sauce to the mix. This is a great weeknight meal.

after making a few changes i was very happy with this dish. i skipped the soy sauce and used a honey teriyaki marinade on the shrimp. i used the canned tomatoes that have mild chillies already mixed in, and added some vegetable seasoning i use on basically everything i cook. i kept it kinda soupy and served over rice, it was amazing!

I didn't like this at all - just didn't taste that good and not worth making again.  Also, the description says "no chopping" yet the 2nd ingredient is a chopped onion and the 4th ingredient is minced garlic.

This dish definitely had too much pineapple and not enough of everything else.  I gave it two stars only because it's so quick and easy to prepare.  My 5-yr-old gagged on the first bite. It is light and edible but I say leave out the pineapples, add more of all the other ingredients and then it will be a tasty tomato gravy shrimp dish!
