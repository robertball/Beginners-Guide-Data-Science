I made it in the pan it asked for and that was a mistake. Next time a different pan maybe Bundt. It took a lot of extra time to cook and by the time the middle was done the outside was burned. Then it didn't taste like anything so after most of it it sat on my table for the rest of the day I threw it out. And I had 6 kids here! What a waste of nuts and chocolate.

Everybody in my family LOVED it! Instead of using sweet chocolate i used crushed semi-sweet morsels. it was light and not too sweet -just exactly how i like my cakes. Definately will make again.

Good tasting cake. I used a tube pan and I iced it with chocolate ganache. The family enjoyed it.
