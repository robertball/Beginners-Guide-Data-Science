Wow! For a super easy dish, it def. deserves 5 stars.  In the amount of time it took to prepare 7 sandwiches , I had a much more nutritious (and filling) meal.  I sautéed the beef with onions and a small amount yellow peppers (chopped).  Used bill echol's taco seasoning I recipe and only had canned corn and green beans (needed to go grocery shopping). Put some aside for the child with dairy allergies and added way more cheese than called for.  We used our own smoked salsa. It would be better with frozen green beans.  All kids and hubby liked! I think this would be too bland with just chili powder.

This got mixed reviews from my family. Hubby, me and one of three kids liked it. The other two kids kept asking "how many more bites do I have to eat?", but I think it was because of the green beans for one child and the chunky tomatoes from the salsa for my other non-veggie loving kid. I made it mostly as written. Since I didn't have instant rice, I made regular rice on the stove top and stirred it in. Instead of using a whole cup of water that the recipe called for because I precooked my rice, I waited and added 1/4 cup of water at a time when mixing in the precooked rice until it got to a good consistency (around 1/2 C total). It was a quick and easy recipe with items we already had in the house. I'll make it again.

This recipe was a quick, relatively healthy, gluten free meal. Perfect for busy week nights. I took the advice of others and substituted 1 can (drained and rinsed) black beans for green beans to make it more "southwest". I think it made the dish a bit more hearty too. I added 1 T. taco seasoning to be sure it was spicy enough, and served in bowls with a dollop of sour cream. I think this would be great with the addition of sliced olives, also diced green chili as other reviewers mentioned. It's a keeper.

I love easy, throw it all in a pot meal for week night dinners! Just like others, I added extra chili powder, used canned corn and served it with a salad and southern beer bread. Wonderful, easy meal!

I used drained canned corn instead. Might add more chili powder and a spicier salsa next time though. It was tasty, but could use a punch.

used the recipe as listed except I didn't have frozen green beans so I used one can drained instead.  I think I used more salsa too.  Very good and a nice change.

This is an excellent dish. I sautéed some onions and red bell pepper in the meat. That's the only change I made. Not only is this a very tasty dish, it also has eye appeal. Served with a fresh tossed salad with tomatoes direct from the garden.

I only made a couple changes to this recipe...I used canned vegetables, Velveta cheese and added fried/canned onion rings sprinkled in top. I also used more chili powder to give it an extra punch.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It was very easy and husband and 2 kids loved it!

Good stuff. I used black beans instead of green beans and 1 packet of taco seasoning instead of the chili powder.  Otherwise, made as directed. This will become part of our dinner rotation.

So yummy!   Everyone had seconds.   I only made minor changes, black beans instead of green and instant brown rice instead of white.

This was a great meal for my family of six. We made a few adjustments based on what was in the cupboards, but it was delicious. The kids ate full plates with no complaints! Definitely an addition to our regular weekday rotation.

Very delicious and easy dish to make. Added banana peppers for a little bit more "zing." Will definitely make again.

I needed something easy to make after a long 11hour shift and this was perfect! I did use taco seasoning for the meat and also added french fried onions before topping with cheese. Will definitely add this to my recipe box!

Great and easy.  I added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies, but followed the remainder of the recipe as it states.  Turned out delicious!

This is good and so simple. I add onion and a red pepper like others suggest, and spice it up a bit more.  I've made it with both green beans and black beans- I recommend the black beans, but either works. Serve with a little light sour cream. Yum.

Super easy and yummy! Used chili beans instead of green and had some leftover velveeta which made it creamy. Great comfort food for cool/cold nights!

This is such a quick meal! I added a little more flavouring. I feel that if it's southwestern there should be some spice. Added some onion and jalepeno. I tried it with green beans once, but prefer it with black beans., and just used canned corn.

We all loved this meal! We added chopped onion and red pepper and used taco seasoning mix (instead of chili powder) and it is a hit with everyone! We even made it when my mother visited and she raved about it as well!

Everyone really enjoyed this dish.  I used a can of Rotel instead of the salsa because that's what I had.  I will definitely make this again.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made this recipe tonight, and it was a big hit with my family. The only change I made was to replace the green beans with canned black beans. Then I served it with tortilla chips. It's definitely going on the do-over list. Fast, yummy, pretty healthy, inexpensive. As quick to make as a boxed dinner, without the scientific ingredient names. Can't beat that!

My 2 young kids and I liked it, although I used ground turkey and thought overall it didn't have enough flavor. I added a little salt and black pepper, 1/2 cup green onions, and 1 tbsp southwestern seasoning mix. Also a few squirts of ketchup for additional flavor.

I live in Az and thought the green beans were a bit odd, so I added 2 cans diced green chili and a couple of jalapenos. Not blah any more, we like a lot of spice and flavor here. Will serve on tortillas next time, but overall my family loved the recipe. Thanks for a very good basic recipe, we will have this again.

Not bad at all--and easy to make!! If you go taco seasoning instead of chili powder or chili sauce--you can use a few drops of Tabasco or Tobasco "Smoked Chipolte" sauce per serving to add that yummy zip. This recipe's a keeper for me!!

Love this dish. Recommend adding half a large onion and a clove or two of garlic while you're browning the meat. Also freshly sliced avocado and sour cream make excellent garnishes!

Not bad. I cut the ground beef to 1/2 pound and added sautéed onions and garlic, then basil and oregano instead of chili pepper. Not a fan of chili pepper. I also used a little Worcestershire  sauce.   Of course this means a different flavor from the OP, but the results in general were still pretty tasty.

I make this all the time, it's so easy.  I omit the corn and green beans in favor of this frozen veggie mix that I can only find at ONE store, it's black bean/corn/onion/poblano.  It's also good with quinoa instead of rice.

This was really good. I made a few changes based on other's suggestions. I browned the onion and beef together and added two tablespoons of taco seasoning. I substituted green beans with canned black beans and used canned corn. I also made brown rice separately and added it in close to the end. Because I wasn't cooking the rice I only used about a half cup of water. This makes a lot of food, much more than four servings for us. I'm definitely going to add this to the rotation since we always have these ingredients on hand.

I quite enjoyed this. It was pretty good this first time and I will definitely make it again but next time I plan on using other reviewers suggestions and changing some things. This time I added 1 cup of frozen chopped onion and thought that enhanced the flavor. In the future I will swap the green beans out for black beans (or possibly use both) and will use hot and spicy taco seasoning instead of just chili powder. I love one pot meals and this is my new fave.

I just made this for dinner but I seasoned the ground beef with onion, garlic and other spices. I think it would have been very bland if I had flow the recipe as it is. With the changes I made I loved it and so did the whole family. Would make it again

I replaced the chili powder with taco season & the green beans with black beans. I also added red peppers & onions while browning the beef. Overall this was easy, but was lacking flavor. If I make this again, I will need to doctor it up more.

As is, the recipe was okay. It is a great fast meal, though bland. Next time I will increase chili powder, use beef broth instead of plain water, and add 1/4 tsp crushed chili peppers.

It was easy and tasty. I changed the green beans for black beans. I made rice and faro on the side to suit other family members. I also added chopped tomatoes and chopped green peppers and the taco seasoning. If adding taco seasoning and mild salsa, consider reducing the chili powder. Also served with sour cream on the side. Family really liked.

I love the idea of the black beans way more!  Wil make again but I think cilantro would be the cherry on top.

It was pretty good. I did use 1 tbsp chilli powder and then also added some chipotle pepper seasoning and hot salsa instead of medium to add a kick. The green beans were kind of weird, I would use black beans instead. Also added more cheese. Overall very good though.

I liked this real easy to make. I used Birdseye southwestern corn
for the veggies they add some extra flavor (I microwaved it for 5 mins)
then just added in place of the corn and beans. I think it still needs
a bit of something, tho I liked like this and will make it again and tweak somehow to jazz it up a bit.

This was so quick and easy! I used the suggestion of the fried/dried onions on top; I substituted canned pinto for frozen green beans and used my JD's salsa powder for plain chili powder. My family also added a dollop of sour cream at the end. Next time I would consider serving it in baked tortilla cups (like we use for taco salad).

This was a nice, easy, quick recipe. I like my food spicy, so I added a bit more chili powder. I also added onion, cumin, and a little salt. That really made it pop. I substituted white rice for brown. Oh, also I just added one fourth cup of water as suggested by another person, and I think that was better than using the full cup of water. I will definitely make this again!!

Excellent, and quite easy. Used a couple of other reviewers' variations (taco seasoning vs chili powder, sautéed chopped onions & peppers with the ground beef), and used 3-year sharp cheddar instead of Kraft Tex Mex, whatever that is; also used brown rice instead of instant white; took a little longer, but came out a little less "corporate/instant", and VERY GOOD. Several reviewers have suggested that this could be spicier, so I would suggest using more seasoning or hotter salsa; might try this next time, but for a first try, we were very happy with this dish. A keeper.

I added sautéed peppers and onions to this dish. As well as used long grain rice and canned vegetables. The dish itself is definitely a great starter with room to add your own personal flavor. After making this a few more times and adding this and that it should be down to a science.

I can't really give this a true rating because I didn't have chili powder or green beans.  I used taco seasoning instead, along with the salsa.  My family of 7 liked it okay.  My two girls (6 & 9) had seconds, having added ketchup, of course!  I will most likey make it again, as I always need an inexpensive meal for my large family!

Excellent! This was so easy. I used some left over rice and added onions and bell peppers to the meat while I was browning it. My 5 year old cleared her plate!

This is a great recipe for kids ! I wouldn't add more chili if serving to children, but I would for adults and also about a tsp of salt.
