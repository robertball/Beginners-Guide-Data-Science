Delicious! I used only the jalapeno peppers, no banana peppers. I added 1 green bell pepper, dash garlic powder, and 10 oz frozen peas (had them hanging around) and omitted the squash, though I'm sure it would be great. Awesome!

Made this recipe yesterday, but without the squash and added a bunch of cauliflower and broccoli flowerettes. Even more nutritous than the original!

Fantastic. Filling and low-cal at the same time. Just spicy enough with a rich hearty background of veggies. Just be careful with the shrimp. It takes way less than five minutes. Turn the heat off like a half minute before they look done and they'll continue to cook as the dish cools, coming out tender instead of rubbery.

great way to use up some of my summer okra. the only thing that might have made this better is a little spicy sausage to compliment the shrimp. I served this over quinoa to incorporate a whole grain. Very hearty.

Wow... I reduced the peppers by one each and added water and vegetable stock and it was still very very spicy. And I LOVE spicy.

I made this today according to the recipe and me and my husband were not impressed. He said it had no flavor, although I wouldn't go that far, I definately was not pleased enough to ever try making this again.

This was pretty good and I liked that there were lots of vegetables. I added 1/4 tsp celery and 1/4 tsp garlic salt since some said this lacked seasoning.
