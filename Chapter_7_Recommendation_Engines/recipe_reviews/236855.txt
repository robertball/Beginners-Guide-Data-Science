I used a frozen banana so my smoothie came out really thick (which I like). Not a bad recipe but I think the OJ overpowered the matcha flavour. I'd reduce the former or increase the latter next time.

I didn't have OJ so threw in a heaping TBS of orange juice concentrate with a cup of water along with the other ingredients and I really liked this one! This is the 3rd matcha smoothie I've tried, and it's actually my favorite so far. Simple, clean flavors. Adding in some more tropical fruits would be great, but I don't think they're necessary (mango and pineapple would go really well with this mix).

I think that maybe adding more fruits like peaces, mangoes, strawberries,etc. would have a huge and wonderful affect on the smoothie. It's just a little too plain for my taste.

I didn't know about matcha until Irene the Allstar made a matcha-based collection. I bought some at the bulk food store and tried this smoothie. We both loved it! I'll definitely make this recipe a lot!

I added dates and a little flax milk to break up the icy texture from the cup of ice. Flavor was different but not bad.. Next time I'll try a different OJ.

I added an extra third banana, found the flavour a little to plain. Not bad but think I will add some strawberry, mango, or pineapple next time as suggested in a previous comment.
