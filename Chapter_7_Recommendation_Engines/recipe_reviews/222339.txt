I changed it a bit. I substituted cream cheese & sour cream (6 ounces and 2 ounces) for the marscapone and used a kabocha squash instead of butternut. I also chopped up some portabello mushrooms and sauteed them in the butter and served over top. Outstanding!

If I could give this 10 stars I would. I have made these many times now and everyone always loves them. The only thing I change is how I cook my BNS. Our microwave broke about 5 years ago and we chose not to replace it so I roast my squash in the oven. Next time I make them I think I am going to try a gf flour. Yum, now I am excited to make them for dinner sometime very soon. I also think I am going to add them to our thanksgiving menu.

You can use pumpkin puree and ricotta in this recipe (substitutions for butternut and mascarpone) and it will be terrific. Don't be worried about not having sage. I didn't have any, and it turned out so mouth-wateringly creamy, salty, crispy that I didn't miss it! Served it with my fav. veggie side dish: garlic bread. :O...

The taste was fantastic, but I didn't like the texture. It was more like a creamy dumpling, than a gnocchi.

Pure heaven in your mouth and fun to make, too. I had a little back up getting these morsels from the boil into the frying pan, but discovered its no hurry - everything will come together in its own time. The light toss of cayenne just makes this thing pop with flavor!! Accomplishing this recipe so successfully means a lot - I really wanted this one for my wife and it paid off... she loved it.

liked the flavor but it needs more butternut squash to get past the butter fried flavor. also it becomes a freakish game of boil and fry to get them fried and not over cooked in the water. This made about 30 -40 gnocchi.

I don't live near a grocery store so had to substitute 1/2 cup cream cheese and 1/2 cup sour cream for the mascarpone.  It was a big hit with my foodie friends. I can't wait to try it with the mascarpone.  If you failed with gnocchi before, don't let it stop you from trying this!

We loved it! I halved this recipe and I had plenty. I used a mixture of cream cheese and goat cheese and I roasted the squash in my oven. I will definitely make this again.

I followed the directions exactly but it came out a wet sticky mess instead of a dough. I tried adding more flour but by the time it finally felt like dough it was too much flour..

I used purple sweet potatoes instead, and because sweet potatoes have a little sweetness, I added some apple when frying the gnocchi.  Yummy!

Delicious! But I did a bit of tweaking... I roasted my squash, as it has a much deeper flavour. I also found that the gnocchi wasn't cooked quite enough, so I turned on the oven to 350 and popped them in as I finished each batch.It firmed up the pasta just enough. Will be making this again!

Very good recipe. The texture felt a bit "off" to me. I think it could benefit from cooking the squash longer. I will definitely make this again, but next time I will cook the squash in the oven.

I loved the butternut ravioli from Chef John's website, but this was not as good. It just tasted like fried cheese. If I'm going to make something with butternut squash and mascarpone, then i want the ravioli. Maybe this would be better with less cheese.

It’s a crowd pleaser. I used a small scoop instead of 2 spoons. Smoother gnocchi don’t fall apart as much in the water. I also brought the water down to a simmer instead of a rolling boil. I cooked the gnocchi in batches through the simmering and sautéing steps then started the next batch. I prefer fresh basil instead of fresh sage.

The recipe sounded great and the flavors too. Unfortunately the dough was far too gooey and runny. I attempted to save it but adding more flour too away from the other flavors like the parm and squash. Next time I’ll ensure the squash is drained better and dec the wet ingredients.

These were a total disaster, I wasted so much time roasting a squash and refrigerating the batter for twelve hours. I knew right away they weren’t going to work when they started falling apart in the water.

I could not wait to make it after watching the video, and I was not disappointed.  It was so delicious.  I made it in NEWFOUNDLAND FOR MY SON’S family, I made it in Nova Scotia to share with friends, and I am making in tonight and tomorrow in Calgary for my family here.   I brought some when I came to Calgary. They loved it.  Worth the time.

I made it not once.. Twice. this recipe is fooling. I followed it to the exact letter and both times it let me down. I wasted a lot of money, time and gardening due to this recipe.  I am sure that it will work for some people, but be warned, there are pitfalls that will leave you with no meal at all.  Here is what I experienced: 1st attempt;  made as shown, and overcooked the items during boiling stage and it dissolved in the pot.  I realized I did not let the "batter" set 8 hours or overnight.. so night 2.. cold batter, set for 12 hours. attempted again, this time, making sure to pull the gnocchi off the boiling water at the 1 min. marker. I had butter prewarmed and ready to fry in a pan next to it. Even after being parboiled, the gnocchi,fell apart and crumbled during the last stage. I feel there are several caveat's left out of this recipe and it is made to seem much easier than it is. I will never attempt this mess of a meal again.

These gnocchi are so delectable eaten right out of the pan while they're hot.  But unfortunately it makes a mess and they cool off quickly so I put them in a 200 oven to keep them warm.  Also, you have to make them the day before.  Lots of time put into this. Otherwise, I'd give them a 5.

Having never made Gnocchi before I didn't know what to expect.  These little buggers were delicious! It was quite a lot of busy work but so good!  I made my little balls ahead of time and placed them in the boiling water about 15 at a time.  They did stick to the wax paper but it made the process go a little faster.

I agree with another reviewer that it mostly tasted like butter, and we had to fry them longer (until almost burnt) to make the texture so they weren’t falling apart or mashing each other when placed in a bowl.  To be fair, made it with ricotta instead of marscapone cheese, so don’t know if that would make any difference. A lot of work for a side dish...

These are amazing! I forgot to take a picture because I couldn't wait to eat them. Used Kabocha squash that had been roasted days earlier and was looking for a way to finish it off. Did not have Mascarpone so I used half sour cream and half finely grated Swiss cheese. I also used whole wheat flour because I didn't have white flour. They were still light and fluffy. This recipe is a keeper. Also, watching the video was helpful.

I followed the recipe exactly but they came out mushy. Perhaps my squash had too much excess water in it? I didn't want to waste the batter so transformed it into pancake batter. I added two tsp baking powder and 1 tsp baking soda, a bit of milk and a little more flour to get it to the right pancake batter consistency. They were great as pancakes and the maple syrup went nice with the light cheese flavouring.

This was amazing! Seriously, I can't rave enough about it.  Used precut butternut squash to save time. Also, didn't bother refrigerating it due to time constraints and it turned out great.  Will be making this again and again!!

Delicious and enjoyed by all.  The only issue I had was the consistency; it was not stiff enough for the gnocchi to maintain their shape, really.  I know I used a larger squash than what was called for, but I tried to compensate for that by using additional flour.  Also, I think there was way too much butter called for in the recipe.  Will have to experiment a little in future; the taste was fantastic!  Thanks!!

Amazing recipe...I absolutely love this!  It was a fantastic side to spinach and onions that I usually serve over rice.  This time, instead of rice, I opted for the gnocchi as an alternative.  This tasted more like a potato pancake than gnocchi, though.   

There is only two of us, so this recipe made a lot more than we needed for one meal.  We saved the left over mix in the refrigerator and cooked it like pancakes the next morning.  I did not cook it in water first like the recipe.  Instead I heated up a pan with a bit of sunflower oil, then poured the batter on like pancakes.  Serve with butter and syrup or sour cream if you prefer a more savory flavor. Delicious!

Followed the recipe without tweaking, but I must have gone awry somewhere.  I really liked the flavor, but my dough was too soft, even after chilling.  The gnocchi didn't get as firm as I thought they would.  But wow, loved the cayenne, it added a nice little kick that you wouldn't normally associate with butternut and mascarpone.
