My husband and I are OBSESSED with Taco Bell jalapeno sauce, so we were skeptical that this would not match up.  Wrong-  it is absolutely fabulous!!!  It is just as good made with light mayo, too.  It is also great to liven up a regular old grilled cheese, and on chicken.  Awesome, awesome recipe!

This did taste exactly like the taco bell sauce in the quesadilla.  I wish I read the reviews prior to making it.

Fantastic! I doubled the peppers (used fresh jalapeno/habenero/green pepper mix) and used green pepper juice instead.  Really spicy like we love it - very versatile sauce.  Try dipping corn on the cob in it, with some fresh lime juice...yum!

This spread REALLY kicked my quesadillas up a notch. A little bit goes a long way, but I quadrupled the recipe to make a bunch. Might be good on a burger or chicken sandwich too!

I have made chicken quesadillas several times for my family. I tried this addition tonight for the first time and everyone said they were the best I have ever made. I put a thin layer on each tortilla and layered premade tyson fajita chicken strips with colby/jack cheese. I have an electric quesadilla maker and they turned out restaurant quality. quick easy and delish. thank you for the recipe

I used this in place of sour cream with my quesadillas.  I was surprised that it was not as flavorful as I thought it would be, but not bad.  I think I'll stick with sour cream next time, though!

I really liked it, I didn't have jalapenos in cans therefore no juice so I just used fresh jalapenos. It was great neverthe;ess. Oh and I used Taco Seasoning in it too. Great for Chicken Quesadillas from allrecipes!

This stuff is awesome!  I omitted the sugar and used plain Greek yogurt in place of the mayo to cut down on fat and calories (not to mention, it adds a little protein) and it was wonderful!  I'll definitely make this again for MANY things in addition to quesadillas! :)  Thanks for sharing!!!

I used vegan mayo, and proceeded to make the most amazing vegan quesadillas.  A definite keeper.

Exactly what I was looking for to jump off from and customize.  I add a block of cream cheese and double the recipe.  I like things a bit spicy, so that usually means  5-6 peppers/jalapenos from the garden - and sometimes I roast the peppers before putting them in for a little more smokier flavor.  

Just blend it all up and YUM!

YUM! Only change was to double the recipe. I used this as a dipping sauce for 'Beer Battered Deep Fried Pickles' from here...perfect match! I did throw everything into my mini chopper, but the japs ended up not getting chopped up any finer, but I think I like it better this way. I will mix it by hand from now on. I've never had Taco Bell's version, but this was great! This would be a wonderful sauce/topping for TONS of different things! Thanks for sharing. :)

I did change this a bit but I am giving it 5 stars because as is would have been great for quesadillas but I added curry and mustard to this to make tuna salad with and it is absolutely amazing. Just want to put that out there so people know this spread/mix is versatile. :)

Very good. I added it to my cheese quesadilla. Does not remind me of Taco Bell, I think Taco Bell is better.

This is great as is. I hate to drag out the blender and have discovered that crushing dehydrated jalapeno peppers (new in the spice aisle) in a mortar & pestle to a powder and then mixing it in works very well too. We go through this like crazy at my house!

This was SO good.  I added green Tabasco sauce in place of the jalepeno's. It does taste very much like the Taco Bell sauce used in their quesadillas.

I really did enjoy this BUT it really needs something other than JUST mayo, like sour cream or yogurt mixed in.  It's pretty mayo-e tasting.  Other than that all the flavors are great.  Oh and I just chopped everything VERY small since i drastically reduced the ingredients, my blender would not have worked.

Substituted yogurt for mayo & used 1 fresh jalapeno. EXCELLENT! David thought it was Lizano Sauce from Costa Rica.

It was great.  I used all of the ingredients, but I did not follow the measurements at all, just kept adding until it tasted right.  If you like spicy don't be afraid to go heavy on the Cayenne!

Deliciously spicy!  I didn't have ingredients for a quesadilla so I spread it on a grilled cheese sandwich.  I doubled the recipe and it was gone within 24 hours.

This stuff ROCKS!  Doubled recipe and adjusted slightly for our family's tastes.  Sub a little sour cream for some of the mayo (about a third), kept sugar at 1 tsp and cumin at 1/2 tsp.  Used home canned jalapeno's pretty much just using heaping scoops directly from jar.  Leaves the most delightful *tingle* on your tongue.  Thanks SO much for recipe!

I loved this sauce! I just won't use a blender next time. The ingredients were so few that the mixture just splattered to the side of my blender and didn't blend. I will simply mix it by hand.

All I can say is that it was excellent. I used fresh jalapenos from my garden.

Very good. I added more jalepenos. Makes a boring cheese quesadilla not so boring.

followed the recipe exactly for a perfectly spicy quesadilla spread. quesadillas are my favorite snack to make, and this just brings plain old tortillas with cheddar cheese to a whole new level.

I can't decide about this recipe.  It has a very unique flavour.  I have made it a few times and served it as spread, quesedilla sauce and dip, as it makes an interesting change from salsa.

A nice spread with a kick.  I used pickled jalapeños rather than canned.  The next time, I would also like to add some fresh jalapeño to the mix.  It worked nicely on 'Fajita Quesadillas' from AR.  I also served 'Rice Elena' from AR.

Yum! This was SOOOOO good and a perfect condiment for our quesadilla burgers!!! I have never had a quesadilla from the popular chain (I know, shocking!), but if their "secret" sauce tastes anything like this, I'm hooked. :) Even my hubs commented that this had a nice kick and suggested using what tiny bit was left to dip our fries in haha! I guess it's a good thing that I made a double batch lol! Thanks for sharing your delicious recipe, ALLJER! :-)

Please forgive me I hate it when someone sayes awsome recipe but here is what I changed!!!! Well we had no mayonnaise. So I used sour cream in place of it. My wife and mother-in-law loved it. My only advice is to hold back on the juice from the canned jalapeno peppers and add it in the end. I added it and it was thin like a sauce. But still very tasty. I made a triple batch and we ate it all. Thank You for sharing this recipe. This will be a staple in our house for mexican night.

I really like taco bell's jalapeno quesidilla sauce and this tastes a lot like it.. I used miracle whip instead because i can't stand mayo. i wonder if it would be good with sour cream? I used this recipe on breakfast burritos very good :)

I thought there was a little too much sugar, but I just added a little more of the other ingredients and it tasted great. It tastes even better on the quesadilla and also tastes great in wraps, on burgers, and as dips. Thank you so much for posting-I will be using this again.

I've been making simple cheese quesadillas lately for quick meals, but they were really plain and boring. I remember seeing this recipe and decided to try it. I scaled it down to 1 for my one tortilla and it worked great! I didn't change anything besides using Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise (it was all I had on hand). It was just what I was looking for and it added a great kick to an otherwise unremarkable quesadilla.

I just got finished making this and couldn't wait for my quesadillas to get done to rate it. I LOVE IT! Full of flavor, and it does taste just like Taco Bells. I can't wait till my jalapenios start growing so I can use fresh instead of canned. I'm glad I went ahead and doubled the recipe because I'll bet that this will taste wonderful on the burgers I'm making for dinner tonight instead of just plain mayo. Thank You for the great recipe.

This is very good and close to the zesty jalapeno sauce at Taco Bell. I felt like the sugar was to much and I will leave that out next time I make it. I'm crazy about the sauce at Taco Bell and always order extra and then some on the side. I really think that if you leave out the sugar or maybe add just a pinch that it would be right on the nose for the actuall flavor of the Taco Bell sauce. Thanks so much for this recipe now I can enjoy this at home with all my Mexican dishes.

What a great recipe!  I had jalapenos coming out of my ears and decided to make this dip.  So I used fresh finely chopped jalapenos, I didn't use cumin, I added cherry tomatoes from the garden, tripled the garlic, and WHA-LA!  It was so pretty too!  The tomatoes gave it a great color, while using fresh jalapenos made all the difference!  Thanks for a great dip to work with!

Found this recipe on another site years ago and I can't make quesadillas without it! I add a little more cayenne pepper because my family likes things hot, but overall this is pretty close to Taco Bell.

Liked the spicy kick this dip had. I doctored it up a little by adding some extra chopped tomotoes, black olives, and onions. It made it more of a dip than a spread. It's a great recipe to start, but I was looking for more of a snacking dip.

It was not what I was expecting. But three stars because it is pretty dang good. I do plan to use it on my breakfast tacos and what not. It just doesn't taste like Taco Bell's CJsauce. I just wish they sold it in bottles. My life would be complete.

Excellent! I like it hotter so I increased the diced jalapeno by 50% and some used red pepper flakes instead of paprika. I used lite mayo and followed the recipe otherwise. Great on the buns of bacon cheeseburgers to kick off the first day of the NFL!

It was great. I'd make this again for sure.

so so so good! I may never make quesadillas again without this spread. It was so good and not to spicy either. I will be making this many many times in the future!!

This does taste a lot like the Taco Bell sauce, although I think the mayo is too much. The Taco Bell version seems lighter. I think next time I'll try it using sour cream instead of mayo or a mixture of both to make it creamier. Overall though it tastes great!

This is awesome!  I used this to spread on the tortillas before adding the other ingredients when making enchiladas.  It gave the enchiladas added flavor.  I will find other uses for this as well.  Very Good!!

I've been looking for this recipe for awhile now. I have horrible luck with recipes though and as usual, this didn't turn out perfect for me. It seemed a little sweet maybe but I did the recipe exactly as read. The aftertaste was pretty right on but overall is was a bit different. I hope to get it to taste exactly as the fast-food version does. Can anyone possibly give me a suggestion to make it taste the same? Thank you so much.

Hubby loves spicy stuff but when asked what he'd give this he said a 3. It was runny- thought it would be thicker.

i love this recipe, i use it every time i make a mexican dinner, my younger siblings love to just eat it as a dip, and to use it on their tacos as well as their quesadillas.

This is awsome. I don't think I've had Taco Bell's so I can't compare but tastes like somehting you would find there. I didn't measure the peppers or the juice so I got a nice sauce not a spread. I also used some of the onions that came in the can. Made our Ham & Cheese Quesadillas delicious. Thanks
