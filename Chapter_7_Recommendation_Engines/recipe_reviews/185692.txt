I followed this exactally, except for the onion, and it was AMAZING! This was perfect with the meal i made. It was very tangy but has a sweet after taste. The recipe makes ALOT so now i have some in my fridge and it has been in there for almost a week and is still awesome! =D

I found this a little too sweet for my taste.   I added a little more soy sauce to cut the sweetness and a bit of ginger.  Then I found it to be very good.

I'm giving this 5 stars because I made it with sesame oil instead of canola.  I used a fraction of the sugar and only had dried onion flakes so used 1/2 of what recipe called for with fresh.  I used it on bagged broccoli slaw mix and diced green apple.  So quick, easy, and delish!

Very Good! I cut the recipe down to only make 1 cup and subbed honey for the sugar (trying to keep it healthier), only using 2 Tbsps. (I think I could've actually just used one and it would've been plenty sweet). I just used this on a veggie type salad, but can't wait to try it on a mandarin chicken salad. The family enjoyed this! Thanks for sharing. :)

I've used this recipe over and over.  It's a favorite in our home.  The only thing I've changed is that I use onion juice now, rather than chopping and straining the onion through a cheesecloth.  It saves time and stinky hands.

Good flavor.  Way too much sugar.  Would cut in half next time. Ended up adding more oil and soy to get it somewhat reasonable.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this. I've made this several times now and have put it into our regular rotation. I only use 1 cup of sugar and use half canola and half sesame oil. I also add a healthy squirt of siracha for a little kick. We make a salad and add regular thin spaghetti noodles, mint and peanuts. It's fantastic.
