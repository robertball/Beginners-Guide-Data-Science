these are really good/easy/ and quick but they DO get chewy the second day. I made 2 batches now and the second batch I let the syrup and sugar cook a little longer-let it come to a boil rather than taking off the heat as soon as it bubbles. They stayed crispy in a container for 2 days. Also just a tip - I save cereal insert wax bags to wrap desserts like this. The waxed paper is better quality and food does not stick to it.

Not too hard to make. Tastes great! Next day they were really chewy, like the cereal was gummy. Makes a lot, if it was going to a party where it would all get eaten right away I think it would be alright, but they definitely don't hold up past the first day.

This was tasty, but nothing over the top special.  I think its large size (cutting a piece off the roll is a bit large) at a gathering with many desserts made this unpopular, as people didn't want a huge portion, but there's not really a way to cut a small piece.  It tasted good, though I'll stick to version of bars with the chocolate tops.  I also agree that after a couple days, the cereal here loses its freshness.
