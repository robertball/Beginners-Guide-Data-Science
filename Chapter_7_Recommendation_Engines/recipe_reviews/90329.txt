This was good but a little too much like Spinach.  A friend gave me a variation:  1 cup carrot 2 cups raw spinach, 2 apples peeled and cored, 1 cup OJ, 2 bananas and 2 cups of strawberries.  Tastes much better than it looks!!

WOW, WOW, WOW!! Who would have thought raw spinach could make a smoothie taste so good!  Even if you DON'T like spinach you should try this!  I followed the recipe except for the grapes.  Since I didn't have the grapes I put in the entire PEELED apple in chunks.  I didn't have vanilla flavored yogurt (too much sugar in that product) so I used plain yogurt and after tasting the recipe added 1 tablespoon ground flaxseed and 1 teaspoon organic agave (low glycemic sweetener that looks like honey).  To make the smoothie colder I added some crushed ice (this does make it thinner).  The smoothie will definitely become a BIG hit on this site!!  I will make this weekly!! I will use another reviewers suggestion to get the kids to try it by having a "green" food coloring bottle on the counter!!

This drink was really good.  We were reluctant to drink it for breakfast but by mid-morning, it was a sweet and healthy treat.  Surprisingly, it even looks good.

We love green smoothies, but I have learned a few things this recipe leaves out.  Spinach is boss and a green smoothie will taste like spinach if you leave out a simple ingredient.  a banana.  Banana is boss over spinach, so if you add a banana. any frozen fruit, yogurt, and a liquid, you will not taste spinach and the banana calms the overly fruity taste and does not over-power.  Kids would probably love this with this 1 additional ingredient. For an extra boost, we also add a packet of emergen-c vitamin c drink.  The kids won't touch that stuff otherwise.

I *really* don't like bananas, so I used a mango instead.  Also, I used plain yogurt instead of vanilla -- so to make it sweeter, I used some pineapple.  The only thing I didn't like about this recipe was that it was chewy.  This was mostly due to leaving the skin on the apple.  I would *not* do that again.  Our blender couldn't seem to handle it, and I was left with a chewy, apple skin aftertase.

Overall, good recipe.  Not something I would eat every day, but for a once-in-a-while health food snack, it was very good.

I made this for my 17 month old who refuses to eat her veggies, and she loved it! I didn't have any grapes, so I threw in strawberries instead. It was delicious, thankyou!

We pretty much decided that any fruit mixed in a blender with some ice tastes good. We would have never thought to put vegetables. Surprisingly pretty good. You could taste the spinach, but it was not strong. It is an amazing color of green! We did not have grapes, so used oranges instead. Still good.

Very yummy.  I was lazy and used 1/4 cup apple juice instead of the actual apple and it was still delicious.

4-star on taste, 5-star on health! You really can't taste the spinach...a great way to sneak those leafy greens to your kids! I have an anti-banana family and even cutting back to a half of one didn't stop the gags...next time I'll use pineapple (which will preserve the pretty green color) and I know they'll love it. I froze the grapes so they were like little ice cubes to make the smoothie extra cold. Dairy also bothers some in my family so I replaced the yogurt with vanilla almond milk and it was still delicious. This is refreshing change from the standard berry smoothie!

I gave this recipe three stars.  I liked it but it was a little heavy and not really my taste.  Once in a while this smoothie would be great and healthy.  But I try to drink smoothies daily and this was just a little heavy and not to my taste.

I was so suprised at how good this smoothie is!  I thought the spinach sounded strange, but you can't taste it at all.  Delicious!

This was way better than I expected it to be!! I will admit I was a little nervous I was going to waste all my fruit doing this, but it turned out great! I made it exactly as written except I added 2 apples & some ice cubes to thicken it up. I am amazed at how I don't even taste the spinach! It looks really nasty but it tastes great!!

THANK YOU for sharing this recipe! I can finally get veggies into my very anti-vegetable 2-year-old! I started out with this recipe, making it exactly as written. It was great, except that the texture of the spinach wasn't as smooth as I'd hoped. Still, myself, my 2-year-old and my 5-year-old liked it lots! What I've come to find since then (and I've made this recipe lots, in different variations) is that if you steam the spinach for 30-60 seconds, pureed it for 2 minutes and then refrigerate it until cold before using it, it is totally smooth. I just put spinach, a frozen banana, yogurt and some flax seed meal together and the kids LOVE LOVE LOVE it and I feel great knowing they are eating something so healthy and have gotten some greens into them. With my little guy, I just make sure not to put it into a cup that's see-through since I don't know that he'd drink it if he saw the green! THANK YOU again for submitting this recipe. Now when my little guy turns his nose up at the veggie with his dinner,  at least I know he's had some veggies in his morning smoothie!

Delicious! I used 2 cups fresh spinach and added about 8-10 ice cubes to make it nice and cold. ***This time I used a frozen banana and fresh spinach I had put in the freezer in marked packages for this drink. Perfectly chilled without the addition of ice cubes.

Great tasting healthy smoothie! I added more banana (I used two because I love bananas) and more apple. Also I would use half the spinach or less and add OJ as one reviewer suggested. I only added about 1/4 to 1/2 cup OJ (depends how thick you want the smoothie), and I also added two cubes of ice as another person suggested. Since I didn't have vanilla flavored yogurt I used plain Greek and added a touch of vanilla extract.

I was shocked at how little this tasted like spinach! My very picky girls both tried it, and they thought it tasted like grapes and bananas. What a healthy start to my day!

The only reason I was brave enough to try this was because of other reviews. Luckily, the did not disappoint. My son (who is not big on fruit) loved this and asked for 2nds! It was just a tad tangy for me (it was the brand of yogurt) so I threw in 2 tsp of honey. It did the trick. My Vita-mix just tore through this. I wasn't big on the smell and I ended up throwing in some ice. Overall it is worth trying and at the very least a great St. Patty's drink!

Absolutely yummy!!!
I did put a whole apple in as I didn't have plans for the other half. I took an idea of another poster and put the fresh spinach leaves in a jug and poured boiled water on them and let them sit for 10 mins. I them put them in the small wizz and blitz them to a pulp with a bit of milk. A very yummy an healthy smoothie thank you so  much as I would not have thought about using spinach in a smoothie.

I love this recipe. I weight train 6 days a week and have this post workout. Use nonfat plain yogurt instead of vanilla and add protein powder. I sometimes substitute different fruit but always use the spinach. Keep a glass in the freezer to pour it into. Delicious!

OMG!!! I would have never imagined adding spinach into a smothie. What a great idea for kids! The flavor is fantastic, you really can't taste any spinach. I wanted to try the original recipe, so I didn't change anything. This is a keeper and I will be making it often for the whole family. Thank you for this great recipe!

This was great- I told my son I had a "green slimy smoothie" for him and he was sold. I used watermelon (about 4 slices) instead of the apple, tasted and looked great! Also made great popsicles when frozen in a popsicle mold.

What a great way to get fresh spinach into the whole family.  The 1st time we made it I didn't want the kids to know it was spinach, so I set out some green food coloring next to the blender and told them that I just wanted to change the color for the month of March!  Then when they found out it was spinach they were kind of mad, but they still drank it all.  We add whatever fruit we have on hand.  Mangoes work well because they are so sweet.  I also added some Flax Seed and some dehydrated milk....bananas, apples....whatever we have on hand.  Also added some skim milk to thin it out a bit, and ice to get it super cold, and have added honey when the fruit isn't sweet enough.  Who would have ever thought that the spinach wouldn't over take the taste...  So excited that I can get spinach into my kids this way!  Thanks!!!

OK, I don't like to do this, but I didn't actually try this recipe, I tried the suggestion of the very first reviewer. It is unbelievably good just as suggested!!!!! It looks atrocious, but tastes heavenly. My 2 yr old and husband LOVE it!!!!
If you have a hard time with the color, get over it. Put it in an insulated mug with a lid.

Add blueberries and it won't look green! Although, you could get a lot of mileage out of Shrek and a green smoothie ;-)

So I made this recipe exactly as the recipe calls for. But, as someone who does not like bananas at all it wasn't quite for me. I also did not like having chunks of grape skin in my smoothie. However I did alter it some and then I loved it!!! I have a juicer, so I juiced two medium apples with the spinach and grapes. I dumped that into my blender with some honey Greek yogurt and ice. Tasted amazing!! And I got the added hidden nutrients from juicing all the fruit and spinach. ??

I substituted the spinach with kale because I didn't have any spinach. My blender is small so it took a little longer to blend. I like the taste of it, but it's a little too thick as there are some chewy bits in it. Great recipe the taste is great!

Change this way for a powerhouse smoothie: skip the yogurt, add 1T. almond butter, 1T. Flax seed, 1 cup coconut water, 1-2 cups ice, some berries, kale. Delicious!

Just got a Vitamix and this is our favorite green smoothie so far!  I used just a splash of milk instead of the yogurt, since we didn't have any on hand.  Still sweet enough, thanks to the apple and grapes!

Very good, and very sweet! A great way to incorporate greens into your diet. For those who are thinking this tastes too much like spinach: don't pack the spinach leaves into the measuring cup ;)

Good recipe. If you're concerned about food safety/contamination and are serving it to young children you might want to blanch the spinach first.

I liked the flavor, but not the consistency. I may just not be a fan of yogurt in my smoothies, but this one didn't work for me.  The next time I made this smoothie, I used almond milk and ice cubes, and it was much better.

Was looking for a way to get more vegetables in my 2 yo. Success!!! He even asked for MORE! Based on other reviews I pre-chopped the fresh spinach, so my blender would not have to work so hard. I also only used a cup of spinach (since it was the first attempt), used apple sauce instead of apples, and used red grapes for sweetness. I hid placing the spinach in the blender, as well as in a covered cup with a straw. He just wanted "more shake!" I will definitely make again.

This recipe really surprised me.  It tasted nothing like I pictured.   It is a delicious smoothie!!  3 out of my 4 kids loved it.  It took them a while to get over the appearance but after they tasted it they loved it.  I told them it was a Hulk Smoothie!

Very good. Definately a great base, well, I did cheat a bit like not having grapes, used applesauce in a cup, and go-gurts. This green drink reminds me of our favorite drink called Naked Green Machine.

This was pretty good but I agree with other reviewers, it was too thick. I had to add a splash of milk just to get it to blend evenly.

This was good, just not great. I love spinach, but I didn't care for the taste of it too much in this drink.  I followed the recipe exactly except to throw in some flaxseed.  It is not very filling as I like my smoothies to be. I might make it again, but probably just as an easy way to use up extra spinach. Thanks anyways for sharing:)

Very similar to Jamba Juice's new fruit and veggie smoothie. The kids LOVED it. Be forewarned, though, it is not as sweet as a typical fruit smoothie and that may throw some people off. Also, if making a double batch, you have to put the spinach into the blender in batches as it will not all fit at once.

This needs ice. That is my only real change. The ice cools it down enough and gives it a good consistency. I prefer to keep the peel on my apples but I know most do not. Some blenders can't break down the peel as well either. Just a few things to keep in mind. Can't wait until my daughter gets home from school and I can give her a Shrek smoothie!

The taste of this is delicious!  Mine turned out a little thick for my liking,(probably because I used Greek yogurt, it is thicker).  Next time I will just add some coconut milk until it is desired consistency.

Loved these!  Kids never suspected a thing.  Hahaha I love it!  I even added neon blue to try to tint it blue but it just made it a cool shade of grass green. So I quickly pulled out a bottle of yellow before the kids got home.  It wasn't as smooth as a smoothie but the taste was great.  The kids wanted them again for spring, St. Patricks Day, and as Green Goblin Goo for Halloween!  Spinach!...who would have thought!

Awesome smoothie.  Actually changed the whole way I do smoothies.  I add a stalk of celery, a cup of carrot and up the grapes to 1.5 cups instead of 1 cup.  I use plain Greek yogurt.

This tasted just like a regular strawberry smoothie. The spinach didn't seem to add any extra flavor. All it did was add a disgusting texture. If someone really wanted to use the recipe, I would get some spinach and really grind it into a paste and then add it.

Who knew eating your veggies could taste so good?! I'm excited to find that I can add some veggies here and there to my smoothies without ending up with a virgin Bloody Mary.  (Now THAT'S no fun!). I'm not giving this one 5 stars because I think this is a two step process if you have a crappy generic blender like mine.  I had to transfer everything to the food processor to get it going.  It ended up a bit gritty, so next time I'll finish it off in the blender. Could have been the skin on the apple, but I'll leave that on next time too, because that's where a lot of the fiber comes into play.

I admit to being skeptical about this recipe at first.  I wasn't quite sure if I was going to taste  the spinach.  I decided to try it because it is very healthy (we need our greens!). Surprisingly, my family & I actually enjoyed it.  I ended up adding 1/4cup of honeyed granola, two tablespoons of flax seeds, and a cup of ice.  It was very delicious and nutritious.  My husband wasn't used to seeing a green smoothie and thought it looked weird; but I got a kick out of the "greeness."

Yum! I used vanilla Greek yogurt. I didn't have any grapes so I used the entire peeled, cored, and chopped apple as another reviewer suggested. I tried this with kale and it was very good. First time making a smoothie. Will make again.

Absolutely fantastic!!! I added a little bit of coconut oil, so yummy! And the whole family loves it, they don't even realize how good it is for them & that there's vegetables in it ha! Just make sure you blend very well!

I made this in the food processor using all the ingredients.  I left the peel on the apple and only used approximately a cup of spinach.  It was absolutely delicious!  It wasn't completely smooth with the apples and other small chunks so you could chew it some which I liked!  This was my first successful smoothy!

This recipe is so good my picky 2 years old LOVES IT! We make it every other day and call them Monster Smoothies! I sub Skim milk for the yogurt and it is a little less creamy but I feel it tastes a little better! I also leave the skin on the apple (we use granny smith) cuz that's where all the nutrients are so we just run it through the blender an extra time to get the skin all chopped up and than pour it through a strainer to get the last few bits that won't break down. Very yummy!

Very good. I just changed the amounts of the ingredients a bit because I was out of yogurt. I had leftover coconut milk that I added. I added 2 cups of ice and 1/2 frozen banana. I went with a whole apple. I couldn't taste the spinach but I never can taste the greens in any of my green smoothies. There is texture to this but it could be the apple, grapes. or spinach. My kids drink them all.

You really can't taste the spinach in this! Who knew? I had to make a few fruit subs, such as kiwi for grapes and strawberries for the apple. I think I would use a frozen banana to make it a little more refreshing, but that's about it. Fantastic.

I have to say it sounded good in theory, maybe I didn't add enough fruit because it just wasn't my favorite...or maybe I just like my food as is?  Good idea though for sure.

The taste was good.  The texture was a little off-putting to my husband (it was fine for me).  You might want to use a strainer to get a majority of the fruit skins (apple and grape) out before you serve it.

My kids (ages 4 and 6) beg for this green smoothie. I like that you don't have to put extra sugar or honey to sweeten it. The fruit and yogurt do a fine job!

Me & my kids liked it, but I had a hard time getting past the color green.  I will try adding a bit of pineapple juice to thin it out.  I will also drink it in a tinted glass since the green color is a bit off putting.

I really thought this was a great breakfast/snack shake - I did mine with all the same fruits/spinach but subbed greek yogurt with vanilla extract and agave nectar mixed in it. I liked it but it was definitely "pulpy" from not peeling the apple. Today I made it again, but added a big handful of ice cubes and peeled my apple - MUCH better! My 18 month old LOVED it and even my picky husband said it was good. I found that if I toss in 1/2 the apple, the grapes, half the yogurt and then 1/2 the spinach and blend then do everything else and blend again, it worked much better. I let it sit on blend for a good 5 mins to really get the chunks out. This is definitely going to be a staple of my diet going forward!

I didn't follow the exact recipe, followed some suggestions and ended up using half a banana, one apple, pealed and chunked, half a pear, 1 cup spinach, 1/4 cup ice cubes, 1/4 cup plain yogurt, 1 tsp flaxseed, and 1/2 tsp agave nectar (or you could use honey). It was surprisingly delicious! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

I made this today, for 1 serving. I didn't have grapes so I used the whole apple, and used strawberry yogurt instead. (sorry, I don't mean to change recipe, but that is what I had on hand). I liked it! It was kind of weird looking, but good! I added ice cubes to make it more cold! Thanks!

Yum! I don't normally give 5 stars unless I don't have to change anything, which I didn't for this recipe. Followed the recipe exactly (and even added a little more spinach!) and it tasted great! It is a beautiful shade of green, too. I left the skin on the apple as well and I thought the texture was just fine. My 4 year old LOVED it, too.  Our new favorite smoothie flavor=) Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I thought this was excellent--lots of banana flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly but used a frozen banana and flavored yogurt (because that's all I had) and it turned out perfect.  My husband asks for this smoothie all the time--great healthy drink for both us!  Thank you for a great recipe!

This is a really great smoothie!  My daughter is not a morning person and needs something nutritious in the morning that she can take with her to school, so we've been on a smoothie kick.  I've made this one two times.  Once I used frozen spinach (it was all I had) and once I used fresh baby spinach.  I preferred the fresh spinach, but my 4 year old, 3 year old and 15 year old loved both.  I freeze grapes and bananas so that it's a nice thick smoothie.  Very good!  We're adding this one to our repertoire!

I absolutely love this recipe!  I make one almost daily.  I like to change it up by adding blueberries or strawberries. (Although that makes it a really ugly gray color, but still tastes delicious!)  Also, I add about 3 or 4 tbsp. of flax seed for some extra nutrition.

I made this for my girls for breakfast.  I substituted pineapple for the grapes and frozen spinach and they loved it.  Great way to sneak in some greens!  I've also been known to throw some sliced beets in their smoothies with some strawberries and other fruit.  Makes a great funky color.

This drink was fantastic!!! I asked my husband if he wanted any and he said no but I got him to take a sip and of course he changed his mind very quickly.  I preferred mine more cold so I added about 10 oz or about  1-1 1/2 cups of ice.  Perfect.

good tasting smoothie.  since trying this recipe i've discovered you can add spinach to almost any fruit combo and not taste it at all, I also add 1 tbs flax oil and a scoop of protein.

This was pretty good.  I used 1 cup cinnamon apple sauce in place of the apple, threw in some carrot and topped it with pineapple juice for sweetness.  The color was funky, but it tasted yummy!

This is SO good!  I used plain yogurt and frozen (dark) bananas.  I thought the kids would rebel and refuse to drink it because they saw the spinach go in the blender.  THEY LOVED IT!!!  My son who won't eat green things asked for seconds!  Two thumbs up from us!  It was WONDERFUL!  (And with plain yogurt it wasn't tart at all -- all the sugar in the fruits made it quite sweet.)

We didn't like this too much.  It tasted too much like strong plain yogurt.  I think it needed some more sweetness somehow - maybe it was the type of yogurt I used?  Maybe if we used part yogurt/part ice cream or something?  I may make it again with some modifications, because I'm trying to get my toddler to eat spinach!

Wonderful smoothie recipe! I made it just as the recipe stated, except I only had strawberry honey yogurt so I used that. I also blended with ice because I like for my smoothies to be very cold. So tasty! I have a 2 year old and 9 year old who are also enjoying it!! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was good for having spinach in it.  But it didn't wow me.  It came out a bit too thick for me.  I probably won't make it again

This is tastey, but a little too sweet for me. Next time I would use a plain yogurt instead of a vanilla favored one, and I would control the sweetness by using honey or agave.

I love this green smoothie!!! Helps me get my day going with greens and a great energy boost! I like to cut my banana up beforehand and freeze it so the smoothie gets cold and also love to add in a splash of coconut water for the electrolyte benefits! It helps to thin it out a little bit. Also, since grapes are rarely in season, or have to come from so far out, I vary the kind of fruit I use based on the season. Makes it taste that much better when everything is fresh!

I love this and so did my 4 year old son!!  It's hard to get him to eat his green. So this is a great recipe to get him to eat them without him even knowing it. I was out of spinach and yogurt, so I used what I had on hand...I used baby kale and soy milk.  Yummy.  Thank you and I look forward to trying it with the yogurt & spinach after I go grocery shopping :)

This is delicious, but a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I will  make it with plain yogurt and add some vanilla. I made it with unsweetened applesauce instead of the apple, as I had a jar open in the fridge, and the texture was great. Thanks!

What a great way to start the day!  I had mint on hand, strangely, and  it was a fantastic addition.  I used plain greek yogurt, thinking that I wouuld then have to add something to sweeten it up, but the grapes had done that enough already.  Thanks for this, we'll be making it often.

Wow, this is brilliant! I had to add a bit of sweetener to cover up the taste of raw spinach, but this is a great way to get your nutrients each day! I tried blueberry yogurt, and that was ok, but next time I'll just stick to vanilla. Also, don't peel your apple. A lot of the nutrients are in the skin, and if you blend it well enough, you won't notice the difference.

YUM. I definitely did not realize I could trick myself into eating veggies by slipping them into my smoothies, clutch! I didn't have grapes or vanilla yogurt though, so substituted with frozen blueberries and honey greek yogurt. Also blended in some ice to make it more smoothie-like as well. Delicious!

I loved this - my first green smoothie and it was delicious!  I only rated it a 4 b/c I made so many changes from the recipe.  I used 1/2 banana instead of whole, almond milk in place of yogurt, and added a plum b/c it needed to be eaten soon!  This was very good!

WOW I just had spinach for breakfast no way!! this recipe is really awesome... I had to add a little milk to help mine in the blending process.... I think this would taste even better chilled.... using frozen fruit such as frozen chunks of banana might help this... also if you are worried about the sugar plain yogurt would probably do the trick too... great recipe thanks!!
UPDATE: I made again using frozen banana and with the little bit of milk I needed to add to get it blending the consistency was just about perfect and the temperature was slightly chilled.... tasted fantastic

I have done a similiar recipe with spinach but I used  about 2c baby spinach, 1/2 orange, 1 small apple peeled and 1/3c of pineapple blended with water.  Turned out really good. I was wondering does anybody know if you could use frozen spinach instead of fresh?

Love this smoothie. Did however make a small change. I added about a cup of frozen raspberries, which makes the smoothie not quite as green (easier to get kids to drink it) and makes it the best smoothie!!! I have also added some protein powder...but prefer it without.

Tastes great.  The skins of the grapes and apple add a texture that I didn't really like though, you almost have to chew it.  Will probably make it again.

I would suggest juicing the greens and the apples first then blend the remaining ingredients in a blender.  Juicing would take the “chewiness” out of the greens.  It’s SO delicious!!

I used this recipe as my base but changed it up a little bit.
I didn't have any grapes, so I went with another reviewer and used a whole granny smith apple (peeled, cored and chopped into chunks), 1/2 cup crushed ice, 1/4 cup original almond milk, 1/2 a banana and about a cup or a cup and 1/2 of spinach.
It was excellent. Great smoothie to have on the go, or in my case, as a light meal an hour before yoga. =)
Happy blending!

Loved it! Didn't have vanilla yogurt so I used 6 oz. of greek peach yogurt, also added 1/2 cup of coconut milk and 8 ice cubes to cool it down a little more.  Finished the whole thing off myself! and its been a great addition to my post-workout snacks

Very good and way cheaper than buying a Naked Juice, but a little too creamy.  I might try using orange juice instead of some portion of the yogurt the next time around. I'd go for a juicier smoothie, but this is a good recipe to start with!

I have to be honest, I did not like the way this looked at all. It looked like green slime. The recipe didn't specify green or red grapes and I think green is the way to go for a prettier green colored drink. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to peel the apple or not? I wished I would have because I ended up with red apple peel bits in the drink. I would put the yogurt in the blender first, because my blender needed the liquid on the bottom to get it to start blending. The good aspect of this is it is packed with fresh fruit and a full 1 1/2 cups of spinach, love that. I think I would prefer the drink more cold though. It was just too lukewarm for me. It was also kind of sweet. I thought maybe from the grapes or apples, but I suspect it was the vanilla yogurt. I think plain might be better but the flavor was good overall, pretty much like a fruit smoothie, but missing the ice or frozen fruit that makes them cold.

Pretty good. A little on the sweet side.  I think next time I'll try 3oz vanilla yogurt and 3oz plain to cut the sweetness.  A good way to get extra greens in your diet.

This is an awesome smoothie. You can't even taste the spinach. I didn't have a tub of vanilla yogurt so I used plain nonfat yogurt instead but added a little vanilla and honey to it. Absolutely delicious.

I thought this was a great idea, and a good base recipe that you can use to suit your own tastes.  I have tried various versions - with vanilla flavoured yogurt, with tropical yogurt blend, with/without apple, etc....and I haven't really had a bad batch yet.  My only tip is to use frozen spinach and not dethaw it.  I just put it in with my ice and blend it, then add the rest of my ingredients and it turns out yummy....AND HEALTHY!

This is surprisingly good, and very good for you. I've tried it as is, and altered it some; it has room for experimenting. I will say it can have a tart/acidic feel in your mouth because of combination of grapes and spinach. Also, I would blend it for a long time to make sure there are no chunks of grape or apple skin. Maybe try it at a holiday, like St. Patrick's day, Easter, or Halloween, and they'll be hooked from there!

Good base for a fun recipe.  Feel free to play with this recipe with whatever fruits that you have on hand.  I have used different mixtures of strawberries, blueberries, mango, pineapple,half banana, etc.  I also use nonfat vanilla yogurt (delicious) and skim milk or light vanilla soymilk.  Add at least 2c of fresh spinach, you won't even taste the difference.  Adding 1T of ground flaxseed provides even more health benefits than what is already there.  Have fun with this recipe & enjoy :)

I haven't made this particular recipe but a variation. I am reluctant to recommend using flavored yogurts because of the addicitives, especially corn and high fructose corn syrups. It defeats the purpose of eating healthily when processed sweeteners are consumed. Of course, moderation is the key but so many processed foods contain those ingredients it is hard to practice moderation. Read lables and opt for honey, stevia and agave for a sweet taste.

I DO RECOMMEND if the skins bother you (if you forgot to skin the apple or the skins from the grapes bother you), stain the mixture.  Well worth that little bit of work. Very Good, very sweet.  I used about 3 cups of grapes just because I had that much and they were about to turn.  And a whole apple.  I could not taste the spinach (or banana) but it felt good to know it was there.

Green grapes, a Fuji apple and Dannon Vanilla Yogurt is what I used.  It was a wee bit too sweet (and this is coming from a person who can eat three Cadbury Cream Eggs one after the other!).  I will choose red grapes and a Red Delicious apple next time.  You have to see passed the color. I can see myself making this again and again.

I loved the idea, since my fiance gets bored with eating the same thing over and over again. I drank some, thought it was fine, and gave it to him blindly. He told me it tastes like drinking a salad. I will probably do this again because it has a lot of great nutrition, but spinach is very hard to disguise.

It was just okay.  I didn't have grapes so I used pineapple chunks. Turned out pretty good.  I thought it was a little too thick.  I would put about 3-4 ice cubes in it next time.

I really enjoyed this smoothie! I loved the fact that you have a serving of vegetables, but you don't really taste it. I told my friends about it and they can't wait to try it out as well. The only thing that I found that I didn't like about this smoothie was the texture. I had used green grapes and the texture from the skin of the grapes made it feel weird. I would recommend to quickly boil the grapes in a pot of water to loosen the skins so that they can be easily peeled off. Otherwise a great recipe.

Delicious! I used only 1 cup spinach as it sounded a bit weird to have spinach in a drink! but it sure didnt taste like spinach! Next time I would reduce the quantity of banana (perhaps put in 1/2 a banana), and add 1 1/4 grapes and some more strawberry!

Also made this recipe which someone suggested; it made about 4 cups. 1/2 cup carrot juice 1 cup raw spinach, 1 apple peeled, cored and chopped, 1 banana, 1 cup of strawberries. I added 1/2 cup blueberries and some soy milk which I had in the fridge. You can add any juice and friut to make it your own! Thanks for the ideas.

I loved this recipe! However, I did not like the spinach texture in the smoothie. So, I boiled several cups of spinach in about 1/2 of water. After about 10 minutes, I drained the spinach and bagged the wilted leaves for later use. The resulting green liquid has all the nutrients and amazing green color. Place the liquid in the fridge to cool. Typically I have this frozen in cubes since my children don't like spinach (that's how I sneak it into many different dishes! what they don't know is good for them!) Add the cubes to the dish as directed! great green flavor and nutrition without the spinach feel....

I was reluctant to try this but glad I did! I added more fruit since I was afraid to taste the spinach (I really don't like veggies) and it really came out great. I added an extra banana and a whole apple and ice. Delicious. Will make again. Thank you!

The picture of this intrigued me, but I wasn't sure what to expect as the addition of spinach threw me off!  Surprisingly, it was really yummy!  I used plain fat free yogurt as I didn't have vanilla and it was definitely sweet enough for me.  Next time I will add either a bit of milk or soy milk or even a splash of juice as it is quite thick.  Thanks for a new smoothie recipe!

DELISH !!!! The only different thing I did was I used applesauce because I had it on hand instead of the 1/2 apple, then added a little milk because it was to thick drinking this from a staw. Got my greens picked the night before and got my yogurt & applesauce measured, so all I had to do was throw everything into my blender, and off to work I went !!!

Was good but very, very sweet. I will omit one ingredient next time - probably the apple.

We have a similar recipe and we love this smoothie.  Both my kids, 8 & 3, drink it up!  We use white grapes and lowfat van. yogart.  We also add ice cubes to chill it.  Very Yummy!

We had this at home for our St.Patrick's Day breakfast.  It was just o.k. for us.  It had a nice smooth consistency and was just the right amount of sweetness.  We could mostly just taste banana however.  We like bananas but it just seemed overwhelming in this and I followed the recipe exactly.  Not sure if I would make this again but it was fun to do on St. Patrick's Day.

Very good. I tricked my kids and told them I colored the smoothie green, which them being boys.....they loved. Who would have thunk spinach could work in a smoothie? I did add some flax seed and a handful of strawberries that I had to use or lose. We all loved this one.

This recipe is so yummy and you really can’t taste the spinach. I did add half a cup of organic fat free milk and only 3oz of the yogurt to thin it out. It helped with some of the chewiness. Also if you want it smoother just add milk and forget the yogurt then strain the mixer after blending.

I was VERY skeptical about this one but was willing to try since I had an abundance of spinach that I needed to use. Very tasty. Even my kids liked it. They thought it was green from a kiwi until I told them. What a great way to get in your servings of fruit and veggies!

Wow!  I had no idea you could put a vegetable in a smoothie without dramatically changing the taste.   If it wasn't green, you wouldn't know it had spinach in it.  I used plain yogurt to reduce the sugar.  Lots of possibilities here, with different fruit variations.

This smoothie was impeccable! a delicious glass of health. Was too sweet for me the first time, but perfect when plain yogurt was substituted for vanilla. also, tried adding extra spinach in another take, but the recipe proportions were already perfect as stated. thanks!

This is a really good smoothie! Its a little thick though so next time a might add a little juice or something. You cant taste the spinach at all. I really like this and plan on making it a lot now!

Wow!! I never thought a spinach smoothie could taste so good! I have a feeling I'm going to be making this several times a week. I added 1T flax meal and 1/2 cup of ice to mine. Next time I might cut down on the grapes a little and try adding some soft tofu.

A unique and healthy shake! I used my standard smoothie mix of  light vanilla yogurt and light vanilla soy milk. I did not have grapes and used a whole apple instead. My blender is not very powerful and the spinach was still visible in little pieces. You can definitely taste the spinach which I enjoyed.

i made a variation of this just like the cook recommended - i used canned pineapples with the syrup, about 1/4 cup frozen spinach, 1/2 cup strawberry yogurt - that's it - i blended it all up and it was pretty good... i've been trying to get my almost 2 year old to eat carrots and other vegetables but she won't - so i've been sneaking them into fruit pops - when i saw the groovy green smoothie i thought i'd give that a try - but i freeze them into popsicles... thanks for the idea to add spinach! it's pretty tasty for mom, too :-)

I thought this was really good!  My daugter and I were both afraid to try it at first because it was green but it was very pleasant.  I didn't give it 5 stars because of the texture, but the flavor was on point!  I am going to make it for my friends at our next get together and I am sure it will be a hit!

This was awesome although I have to admit I changed quite a lot. I used 1 banana, 1 cup of grape, 12 oz of vanilla yogurt, changed the apple to  about a cup of frozen strawberries, 3 cups of spinach, and added about a cup or so of orange juice. Not really pretty but tasted fantastic and I loved all the colors that went into it.

My kids drinking spinach? Who would have figured! This was good, but needs to be colder. Next time we will freeze the grapes. It had a good banana flavor. We used baby spinach and added a couple strawberries... which made less green more 'muddy' looking.

The only thing I really took from this recipie was the spinach. I used a green apple, used a frozen banana, natural vanilla yogurt, baby spinach leaves and a few spoons of rolled oats. I chopped  the spinach and apple very fine, cut the bananna into chunks and blended the oats into a powder. It was very sweet and filling. I'll definately use the baby spinach leaves in my smoothies again.

This recipe was Ok. The only reason I tried it was because of the spinich, but you couldn't taste that at all! All you can taste in the yogurt and the bananas. Great idea, but I would not make again!

I was skeptical about this recipe also but we think it is awesome!!  What an easy way to get one of the heathliest vegetables out there into your diet.  If changed this up so many times with different fruits, juices, and carrots and everytime it is good.  Some better than others but the original recipe is great.  Thanks for sharing!!!

I've made this recipe before but instead of yogurt, I used some type of juice (usually apple or pineapple). You can't taste the spinach at all that way.

It's a really good recipe. I would've never thought to put spinach in a smoothie. The spinach taste was slightly strong but the banana made it worth drinking. I used strawberries rather than grapes and plan to try different fruits with this. Thanks for the recipe.

I added strawberry whey protein to my drink I tried it with vanilla yogurt but it was too sweet and the plain vanilla is better for you also you can buy a BIG container for a way better price. It is very good, I've been having one every morning.  I'm feeling good that I'm getting fruit and some vegetable in me. I'll be experimenting with some other fruits and vegetables also

This is awesome, It does not taste anything like it looks. and is great for those who don't like spinach because you can't even taste it!

Great smoothie! I didn't have any spinach so I replaced it with kale, I used 2 apples instead of the half which made it taste extra sweet but it was still yummy. Next time I'll use 1 apple and ditch the grapes or use some pineapples and half an apple just so that it doesn't come out extra sweet. You can add different ingredients to your liking.

This smoothie is delicious! It’s sweet without being too overwhelming and packed with nutrients. The only suggestion I would make is to add ice or make it the night before because it’s much tastier when it’s crisp cold

This is great! I added a splash of almond milk and blended it with the spinach first, then added/blended the remaining ingredients. My 6 yo loves this!

Good flavor, but it was to "chewy" for me.  Grape skins didn't break down totally and I'm not sure what else caused the chew

I definitely think some of the fruit needs to be frozen so that the drink is cold enough. I used frozen banana and frozen apple, and it probably would have been better if the grapes were frozen too. It was too sweet for me--I think too many grapes and the yogurt. I also didn't like the slimy consistency the yogurt gave it. I think it would be much better with unsweetened almond milk or even just water.

Excellent! It was a tiny bit too sweet for me but I'm thinking it was because I used a honeycrisp apple (supersweet). The apple was also huge so half of it was probably too much. Only change I made was blueberries instead of grapes (none on hand). Next time I will try maybe a Granny Smith (normal sized) and if that's still too sweet.. maybe plain yogurt instead of vanilla. Thanks for the recipe!

Good and easy recipe! I like to slice my bananas and freeze them. The frozen banana (or any frozen fruit really) gives the smoothie a great texture without watering it down like ice does. Freezing the sliced bananas also keeps them from going bad, so no waste! I also keep frozen grapes, cherries, pineapple, strawberries and avocado on-hand for smoothies.

This was very good, but I had to use what I had on hand:  non-fat Greek yogurt, with a splash of vanilla extract, kale, and a whole apple, (why waste 1/2 an apple).  My Blendtec did a great job, as always.  I can see why kids would like this.

I doubled this recipe, but it was hard to fit everything into one blender.  Do it singly as it recommends.  It serves more than two people.  I replaced the yogurt with one cup of almond milk.  It was still very good.

I think it's perfect! A really good way for me to get some veggies into my diet and a good replacement for coffee, I think! You don't taste the spinach at all with all the fruits and yogurt. Best to not use 6 ounces, but maybe 5 or 4 ounces instead.

Looks disgusting. Especially since the skins on the grapes and the spinach didn't get completely blended so it had a texture. It tastes amazing though

So far, this is my favorite green smoothie recipe. It's not bitter at all; it has a great fruity flavor. The first time I made it, it wasn't quite cold enough for my liking, so the subsequent times I've made it I added a few ice cubes and it's perfect. I have also occasionally added 1Tbsp of chia seeds.

I tried it twice and the 2nd time I used plain Greek yogurt and added a little
almond milk.  I ended up using a whole cored apple and left the skin on (that's where all the vitamins are!).  My blender was able to get the skin broken down so there were no chunks left at all.

I've only tried it once and I eyeballed the ingredients. I used one organic kiwi, one organic mandarin orange from our backyard (seeds and all), one yellow organic heirloom carrot, one green tomato (origin unknown), one old dehydrated looking conventional green bell pepper, some organic vanilla Trader Joe's yogurt, 3 or 4 handfuls of organic spinach, and about 6 or 7 ice cubes.

It tasted fine but next time I'll only put in one handful of spinach. I love spinach but I did put too much in even for my taste. All my ingredients were raw but I may try to blanch my spinach first as others have suggested to see if it makes for a smoother blend.

I used a vintage 10 speed Osterizer blender and only blended for about one minute. I'm happy to use our blender for healthy smoothie drinks! I will be making more smoothies as time goes by. I forgot to add my chia seeds for my first drink so they will get thrown in next time I use the blender.

UPDATE: I've since tried the following ingredients: organic celery, organic baby greens, organic heirloom carrots, organic chia seeds, Trader Joe's organic vanilla soymilk. Wow, this second smoothie tastes so much better than the first one I made. It has just the right amount of sweetness and healthy "green" taste to it. I will make it again!

UPDATE 2: In August 2016 I began to think that maybe I really put 5 or 6 handfuls of spinach into the blender my very first try using this recipe.

I loved this recipe!!!I made it exactly as written.  I thought it was perfect!  The granny smith apple taste was great!!!  Then I made it a second time and I added too much spinach and I did not blend it enough oh that was a little ruff going down but I think the 3rd time will be a charm!

Love it. Tastes like the fruit and yogurt, and the spinach is a hidden bonus. My 2 year old wouldn't try it though, as it looks so different from everything she normally eats.

A little too spinachy for me. I saved it with some more tropical fruits, but I would cut the amount of spinach in the future.

Honestly, my 5 year old who doesn't like anything green but loves mushroom is hard to convince. She tried it (original version) and would not swallow it down. I asked her, if I add vanilla yogurt ice cream would she swallow, sure enough she did. 

I didn't have grapes so I used 2 halo clementine's and instead of spinach, I used kale. I added a little more vanilla yogurt ice cream to make up 3 servings as this was only 2 servings. I loved it, my 8 year old loved it and it won my 5 year old over. My 5 year old can't wait until breakfast to have it again.

This was very good, not at all what I was expecting for my first spinach smoothie. Both my boys loved it. I didn't take the time to add the apple since I had blueberries on hand and washed, just threw a handful of them in. I will be adding this to our smoothie rotation. Thanks!

Love this smoothie. Only had to make a few changes to it to make it perfect for my 4 person family. Who all drink a smoothie at least once a day ;)  Doubled the spinach in the recipe and added a 1/2 cup lactose free milk along with a teaspoon of honey. Needed it to be a little sweeter for the 7 year old in the family to drink it. Was a big hit all around and most importantly got everyone in the family to take in spinach, a hard feat in this house!

This recipe is delicious & healthy! This is my favorite green smoothie that even kids will love since they can't taste the spinach! I totally recommend trying this out even if you are nervous about the spinach! :)

This is my first time making a smoothie, let alone a green one, and it was absolutely delicious!! I used eight ounces of Greek yogurt, one small green apple, and added two tablespoons of flax seed. I didn't add any sugar - this is the perfect smoothie for anyone who wants a healthy alternative to sugary breakfast foods!

Just made this for breakfast this morning. I'm doing a liquid fast and have been making smoothies for all meals. This one was a nice twist on the popular green smoothie.  I will only make one change in the future: less banana.  The taste was predominantly banana.  But otherwise, REALLY GOOD!

This is wonderful. So flavorful and healthy. I actually used 2 cups of spinach, and added to the listed ingredients 1/2 t flaxseeds, 1 T almond butter, 1/4 c soymilk (to thin a bit), cinnamon powder, fresh grated ginger, 6 black berries, 3 ice cubes, and 1 scoop of protein powder. So delicious and I think pretty much any combination of fruit will work. Thank you for sharing and also to the other reviewers who share their variations of the recipe.

for a healthy drink, this was good but for a taste aficionado like me, there was nothing spectacular about it. i followed the recipe exactly except for the vanilla yogurt i used vanillin flavored milk instead because it is not sold here.if you ignore color and consistency, this one tastes like a whipping cream save for a little pungent aftertaste (i suspect from grape seeds)
I also think there was a taste hierarchy in this one. first there was spinach taste, the weakest one, which was covered entirely by fruit(banana) taste which in turn was covered by the vanilla flavour.
all in all, it was all vanilla even though i liked the dark green exotic color of this smothie

This was delicious!  I will have it several times a week.  I used a whole apple and just tossed everything else in by hand.  I added ice and about 1/4 cup of water to bet it to blend nicely in my blender.  I also used nonfat greek vanilla yogurt, much less than 6 oz.  A great tip for rushed breakfasts (which mine always is) is to put the ingredients in the blender at night and refrigerate and blend in the a.m. on your way out of the door!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fine smoothie for those who still use dairy foods. For myself, I use unsweetened almond milk (I like the Silk brand best) about a half to whole cup per 1/3 banana, 2 cups spinach, strawberries, sometimes blueberries....really, any fruit you have around whose flavor won't get lost in the mix.

THE best green smoothie ever!  The grapes added such sweetness!  Hard to believe it is good for you!  Added some Vanilla Almond Milk too, so if you found it not sweet enough, that helped!  Next time I will add carrot and pear too!

Love it! Instead of using vanilla yogurt, I used fat free plain yogurt and added one tsp of pure vanilla extract. I bet adding raspberries would be tasty. :)

I bought a huge bag of spinach and wanted to use it before it got all slimy.   I LOVE this recipe.  I'm not a spinach lover (don't hate it, but don't love it either).  Yes, the green color makes it look a bit strange, but I personally can't taste the spinach.

Firstly, I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but i was inspired by it. I used a big handful of spinach, a banana, some canned pineapple and some of its juice, and some plain soymilk. DELICIOUS! Tastes like pineapple-banana but has an awesome green colour and a nice thick texture. I will absolutely make again!

Great recipe for a healthy smoothie. You have to add a bit of liquid, so I added some milk and poured it over ice. Next time I am going to freeze the grapes they night bedfore and see what that does to the texture.

I was very skeptical about this recipe. I've been trying to include more veggies in out breakfast routine and am glad I finally tried these green smoothies! Next time, I would use the whole apple and hopefully have the banana, grapes, and apple frozen.

I made some (well, ok..a lot of) changes and saved my version as a customized recipe, which was a huge hit!  First, I always use frozen bananas in smoothies, and I prefer using plain yogurt and flavoring/sweetening myself based on my preferences, and I like Greek yogurt.  Instead of the grapes and apple, I added a tube of apple carrot fruit sauce I got at Trader Joe's, and a splash of orange juice.  The smoothie tasted amazing! I then blended in a tbsp of almond butter for extra protein - it went nicely with the other flavors.  So yeah, my smoothie is pretty different than the original, but give credit where credit is due - I would have never thought to use spinach in a smoothies, and it really works well!  Give this one a try!

Even after reading the reviews... I just couldn't believe that you couldn't taste the spinach.  But with the banana...you can't! :)  I chose mango and blackberries for my first try- it came out red.  Also, I tried adding flaxseeds... yuck.  I won't do that again.  Maybe adding flaxseed meal would be better.  I can't wait to try different versions! :)

I doubled the recipe because I have a Home Daycare and needed enough for all of the kids. We all loved it! I wasn't sure how it would go with it being green but that just made it more exciting for the kids! It's very filling so they didn't even want a snack after gulping this down. I will be making this often!

Wow! A hit at breakfast for my 5 and 3 year olds! I didn't have grapes, so I used the whole apple (peeled, cored and chopped) and I used strawberry yogurt. Will definitely make again and again! Thanks!!

Tastes better than I thought it would, although the first taste will remind you a little of new-mown grass. I didn't use any apple.

Freezing bananas first adds great texture. (It's easier to peel and cut them, then freeze.) Also soymilk can be used instead of yogurt. It's healthy and light and does a lot for the texture as well. (You can't taste it very much, even my boyfriend who thinks soymilk is disgusting loves my smoothies when I don't mention that ingredient.)

My kids and I were very excited to make this green drink, but we all (2 adults and 2 kids) were not fond of it at all. I made it exactly as the recipe asked for.   On a side note, I did not taste the spinach at all!

Fun recipe!  The kids wanted to try it, just because of the green colour.  No one guessed what made it green, not even my husband (who guessed lettuce or broccoli).

Taste=delicious/Appearance=lots of fun/Texture=iffy    Didn't have bananas on hand so I substituted 1/2 a peach.  Taste was great, kids lapped it up!  They never questioned the green...they couldn't wait to drink it because it WAS green.  My only issue was the texture due to the grapes.  If only it wasn't so time consuming to peel, it'd seriously make it PURFECT.       I was so happy to serve such a healthy, yummy treat for after dinner for my 3 young children.  My oldest, a 4yo, asked to make more for tonight & if we could have some for breakfast.

GREAT recipe!  This was very tasty and my 2-year-old loves to drink one for breakfast.  I took the advice of another reviewer and used 100% apple juice instead of an apple.  This makes the smoothie a lot smoother and easy for a little one to drink out of a straw.

This was delicious! I couldn't taste the spinach at all...After making this one, I discovered that you can add spinach leaves to just about any smoothie recipe and it is bound to taste good...One word of warning: if you use strawberries, the color of your smoothie with be a little brown in color. If you are after color, steer away from red berries. If you are after flavor, add 'em! I'm not a big vegetable eater, so this recipe is a great way to incorporate a few more nutrients into my diet. Thanks for the idea!

I thought this was really good, and I couldn't taste the spinach at all! I froze the grapes to make it a more icy smoothie, and had to add a little milk to get it to blend. Sweeter than most berry smoothies I make!

Really good. I can't believe that you don't taste the spinach. I didn't have any grapes so I threw in strawberries instead. The color wasn't as pretty, but was very good. My husband doesn't like almost anything green (healthy) and he really liked it. My 2-year-old downed his and asked for more.

For something so healthy, with spinach, even, this qas quite sweet and tasty. Ironically, I made this for my toddlers to replace their Nutrigran bars but, while they did nto care for it much, I loved it. I plan on drinking this for breakfast 2-3 times a week. My husband liked it, too, drinking his own glass.  The only thing I would do is keep it blending longer, in order to not have the little chewy spinach pieces. I don't like to drink AND chew.

I can't believe my boys guzzled this green smoothie that has spinach in it! I have never been able to get them to eat spinach before. The best part is it's so good. Can't taste the spinach at all! I think it is my new favorite.

My two girls (8 and 6 years old) LOVED this! I did substitute the Banana for Kiwi because my banana's were still green though! But still it was really good!!

Fantastic tasting smoothie! I just made it for myself and four year old son who thinks a bright green smoothie is so cool. He wasn't watching me make it though! I peeled the apple and also added a handle if ice for a thicker more frozen like consistency. What a great tasting healthy recipe! Thanks!  Next time I may add a tablespoon or so of ground flaxseed. I add that to a lot of the smoothies that I make.

very good. I am not a huge veggie eater so this is perfect. You can make it a thousand different ways. I tried it with choc soy milk instead of yogurt and it was yummy.

This is so good!  To make this colder after buying the grapes I wash, dry and freeze them.  Also use a frozen banana.  I use non fat plain yogurt and if I remember I add half a teaspoon vanilla.

I substituted a pear for the apple and added a little honey for sweetness and a little milk to get the juices flowing.. It turned out better than I had expected,  but not my favorite.  I think it needs to be sweeter.

I followed the recipe except for using a whole apple and omitting the grapes, and it just wasn't good.  It wasn't cold enough, and the consistency was like yogurt, which some people might like but didn't appeal to me as a drink.  Neither my husband nor I liked the flavor.  The one positive thing about it was that we couldn't taste the spinach.  However, after tasting it I added apple juice, ice, and orange juice concentrate, and it was much better.  I'll probably make it again with those changes... but the original recipe gets two stars at best.

GREAT smoothie! I added about a tablespoon of honey and about a cup of ice.  Just had a tonsillectomy, so trying new things and this one was a great variation from the same ole same ole bananas and milk!

This is funny - the day before I came across this recipe, I was making my usual smoothie and saw I had some left over raw spinach (that was almost getting too dried out). I thought.. hmm.. should I add it? But then I figured it would be gross.

So I found this and gave it a try. I can't rate it as is because I definitely changed mine - added strawberries which is why I did not end up with that electric green color, omit apples.

Very very good and healthy.

My husband & I love this smoothie. It has become a morning staple at our house. My kids didn't like the banana in it (even though they like banana) so I added a whole apple and some extra grapes. Awesome!

Thanks for the idea to add spinach to a smoothie!  I never would have thought of that on my own.  Imade mine quite differently, so I can't really rate this recipe, but I definitely wanted to give you credit for the spinach factor. :o)

I thought this was a joke when I first saw Godiva's pic. It was really good, not the best smoothie I've had but good. Really great on days when I eat fast food & don't get my fruits & veggies in. Going to experiment with my fav combo. Also, I need a new blender - mine had a hard time with this. Thanks!

This recipe is really good.  I would have never thought to add spinach to a smoothie but you can't even taste it. I do like to drink it cold so I always make it the night before, stick it in the fridge and when I wake up blend it a little more. My 2 yr old loves this recipe too.

I was very impressed with the recipe. I tried some different flavors of yogurt and they all turned out delish.

I am a county 4-H leader and I took this recipe to the beginning cooking group as a learning tool.  The kids loved it and wanted more even when they ones that did not prepare it found out what was in it.  We did find that if we used very ripe grapes that it came out sweeter.

This is the first time I've ever reviewed a recipe on here, but I've been using this site for a LONG time!  This was sooo delicious and incredibly healthy.  I followed the recipe exactly and used "Light & Fit" Vanilla yogurt to cut fat and calories a bit.  I will be making this daily!!!!
