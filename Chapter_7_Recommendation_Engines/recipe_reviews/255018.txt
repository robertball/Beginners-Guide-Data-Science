I actually didn't think it looked all that appetizing while making it, but it has a nice rich flavor, offset by the sweetness of the yams, and adding the lime zest at the end is a nice tangy touch.  I nearly doubled everything (made it for family) but used a 40 oz can of yams and the balance was still good.  Didn't change anything else, I usually make recipes the way they're given to me first, then tweak it if I make it again.  Some prep involved but nothing too intensive.  Solid recipe !

I love risotto so I am always on the lookout for new recipes.  The yams were a great add.  This recipe does make a lot!!

This was so easy and tasted amazing!  I used green onions and fennel leaves instead of parsley because that is what so had.

as is.  I'd perhaps add a bit more broth but even my husband who doesn't like risotto thought it was pretty good. ill make it again.
