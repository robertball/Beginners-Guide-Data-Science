Made this with cream of celery instead of mushroom, and it was, in my husband's words, "Awesome." Very simple and easy to make. It was a little soupy. Maybe next time I may use cooked rice and omit the can of water.

I used Italian Sweet Sausage (it was what I had), I added mushrooms (since I had them on hand) and totally blanked on the bell peppers (DOH!). But even with those modifications, it came out really well! I think the bell peppers would have added a nice taste/texture, but I forgot to grab them when I got out all my veggies to cut. Good recipe!

This was AMAZING.  If I could give it 100 stars I would.  I just got the Jimmy Dean's hot pork sausage to save money and it was sooooo good.  I didn't change anything, made it exactly as was.  I thought it strange it didn't have any seasoning, however the spice from the sausage really brought all the flavors together in an amazing way.  I loved how this recipie did not include cheese, it seems like a lot of casseroles do.  We ate the left overs for 4 days after and each day the flavors just got better and better!  Am making this again tonight!

Made this tonight for dinner my husband loved it, I liked it.. he loves casseroles! After reading some of the other reviews this is what I came up with.. 
2 1/2 cups pasta (egg noodles) instead of rice
1 lb hot italian sausage crumbled 
seasoned sausage with: garlic powder, italian bread crumbs, oregano & adobo to taste 
1 can cream of chicken soup 
1 can cream of mushroom soup
2 small green peppers 
1 medium onion 
put all into a casserole dish and sprinkled some bread crumbs on top 
heated all the ingredients on the stove prior to baking, bake 15 minutes at 400 degrees covered and a additional 15 minutes without the cover to brown. 

Came out great, like I said earlier husband loved it and I am sure I will be making this again!!

When I was chopping up the onion and green pepper I thought it was going to be way too overpowering, but it came out really great. I agree with the previous review that it comes out a little soupy, but the flavor is amazing without any more seasoning than what was in the sausage. This one is one we will be cooking again.

Absolutely floored!!!  Stormy weather and didn't want to get out, so the only thing I had to cook was hot sausage.  This was soooo good!!  Like others, I used pasta (elbow mac) instead of rice. Didn't have cream of chicken, so I added a quarter cup of beef broth to go with the cream of mushroom (and omitted the water as suggested by others).  My family doesn't like onions, so I left that out (but I did use onion powder, they never know).  And as another reviewer suggested, I add some garlic.  But oh my wow! Simple but delicious!  After I cooked my sausage, I put it in the chopper until it was like crumbles, then baked 15 minutes covered and 15 mins more uncovered.  This has got to be my favorite sausage recipe by far!  Thanks for sharing!!

This was so easy and yummy! I made a few modifications because of what I had on hand. I had about 2-1/2 cups cooked rice, so I browned the meat and added the meat and rice to a baking dish. Then sauteed red bell peppers,  onions, celery, and mushrooms. Cooked about 5 minutes then added all that to the pan too. I had 2 cans of cream of chicken soup so I added that and on can of cream of onion. I omitted the water because the rice was cooked. Then mixed everything and baked it for about an hour. Will make this again!  So easy and yummy

This is such a great and easy meal to make.  My husband is not a big rice fan, so I substituted with egg noodles that I cooked before baking casserole. Only used a half can of water since noodles were already cooked. It came out great! Also added mushrooms. Just the right spiciness. My husband can' t stop raving about it. Definitely a keeper in my recipe box. Yummy!

Delish!! I used cream of celery instead of mushroom. I also used about 1 and 1/4 cup uncooked rice. No actual celery but about a cup of fresh broccoli! So yummy there were no left overs!

This is a family favorite! I like using both green and red bell peppers to give it some extra flavor. Because I have 3 picky toddlers, I also blend together the veggies, water, and soups so there aren't any vegetable pieces. It's all about presentation with toddlers!

Very good recipe and very easy to make. Like recommended by others I used only a half of a can of water, it was not soup like at all. However all the new Campbell's cans are now 10.5oz now and no longer 10.75oz so maybe that is some of it being less soup like. I think mushrooms would be great to add as well. I also added some red cheyenne, garlic powder and crushed peppers to spice it. I then added cheddar cheese on top for the last 15 minutes of baking. Would definitely make this again, it was a hit!

I liked it a lot. My husband didn't care for the celery, he thought it was slimy. I will make it again, maybe I'll try using cream of celery soup instead of cream of mushroom and add mushroom instead of celery. That way I get rid of the slimy green things without changing the flavor too much!

I used off-brand cream of mushroom and cream of chicken and only half a cup of water. It wasn't soupy but it was a bit mushy so I might omit the water entirely next time. Still, it was very good and the flavors mixed well together.

I love this. I make it for all my church gatherings. This time I pre cooked my rice somewhat because I use brown rice. Takes longer to cooked. So ill see how it does with the cooking time. Plus I added more bell pepper & onion.

I made this recipe, as is. Next time, I will use little or no water. After the 45 minutes, I uncovered the dish and it looked like a soup (smelled delicious). So, I sprinkled a little corn starch in and kept cooking uncovered for another 15 minutes. When I took it out, I let the dish sit for a few minutes and it had thickened up a little more. On the plus side, the dish was really tasty! My boyfriend said "Wow, this is delicious!" I will make this again, but with no water next time.

I took this to a covered dish dinner and it was a hit. I loved it!  If you're not a fan of spicy food, try regular sausage. I made it just as the recipe reads.

So Good!!  I used one can cream of mushroom, one can cream of chicken, and one can cream of celery.  I used spicy sausage and it was spicy, it really gave a  good flavor to the casserole.  I only had any onion, and it worked out just fine.  Made it as written and was totally happy with it.

In a pintch and short on funds to make a huge dinner this works perfectly. My husband isn't a fan of new things especially casserole's so I added cheddar cheese as a topping and he asked for seconds. Perfect go to for a busy weeknight

Great, simple casserole. Was more flavorful than I thought it would be. If it looks too soupy just leave the lid off for part of the cooking time. Delicious way to use up a green pepper. I cut down on one cream soup but kept the full can of water/milk so that is probably why it was a little runny. It thickened up after sitting.

was amazed that this recipe was so good. It being such a simple recipe, I didnt expect to love it so much. I did omit peppers because I hate them with a passion. I didn't have celery so that had to be omitted as well. Thought my omissiond would leave the meal bland but it didnt. Delicious!

I made this recipe with a few twists and within a week, my picky girlfriend wanted a repeat. The changes I made were to substitute the celery for 2 large carrots (chopped), added a jar of red roasted peppers, and 1 extra can of cream of mushroom soup. It's a great and fairly easy recipe to make...highly recommended. One note, the sausage can make a world of difference. The first round, the dish came out pretty spicy and second round, not so much...only change was the type of sausage used.
