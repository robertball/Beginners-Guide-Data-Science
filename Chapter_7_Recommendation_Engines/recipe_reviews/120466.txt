This turned out really good!  I did use sour cream instead of mayo and substituted 1 can of cream of chicken with cream of broccoli. I sprinkeled extra cheese on top.  Definately very quick and easy to make. The whole family loved it!

so good.  I added cooked rice to the dish before I layered cooked chicken, fresh steamed broccoli and sauce. I also covered the pan with sprayed veg oil foil- and removed it for last several minuted to brown the top. I will make this again!

I used one can cream of chicken soup and one can cream of mushroom. Also used fresh broccoli. My family LOVED this recipe, even my husband who hates casseroles. Served it over rice. Delicious, easy, fast, and uses ingredients I usually have on hand.

The first time I had this was at a church fellowship group. I made it at home for my husband and he loved it! It's quick and easy which is a definite plus. I used fresh broccoli instead of the frozen. This can be made with fat free or low fat ingredients.

This was very good!It was another unrated recipe and I'm glad I tried it!The only change I made was to add peas and to saute the chicken.I cooked the divan for 25 minutes but it didn't brown, so I put it under the broiler for 4 minutes.Then it got nice and golden! It is not exactly a low fat recipe, so I won't be making it too often.

Overall a good basic recipe. I doubled it and realized after I baked it that I had way to much sauce. I would say that I would probably use 3 cans of soup, 1/2 cup of the mayonnaise and 1/3 cup of milk when I make it again. The reason I doubled it is I have three growing kids, and we like leftovers. Quick meal for a weekday night.

I substituted one can of cheddar cheese soup instead of using 2 cans of cream of chicken. I give the recipe 4 starts because my kids really liked it and went back for seconds. I however thought the chicken was a little bland. When I make this again for the kiddos, I may saute the chicken with a little butter and some additional seasonings before layering it in the pan.

Great quick weeknight recipe! Only changes I made were to add some garlic powder and cayenne powder. First time I made it, it was a little too bland. I find the garlic and cayenne give it a little extra flavor. Note: I used cheddar cheese not the taco flavored cheese which may explain a slight lack of flavor in the original recipe.

Very yummy! I took the advice of others and used fresh broccoli. I also used fresh baby carrots and some fresh cauliflower. Next time I'm going to use sour cream instead of mayo. This was a big hit at my house! Leftovers were gone the next day :)

Better than I thought, but I had to make changes.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used, cream of broccoli & cream of chicken; sprinkled taco seasoning and garlic powder on chicken; and used sour cream instead of mayo.  I also used cream instead of milk, hoping to kill some of the artificial taste of the soups.  I also put under the broiler for few minutes to brown the top.  If you use frozen broccoli, thaw and drain completely.  I even hand squeezed mine to remove excess water.  Since I made so many changes I rated the recipe as written as a 3 star; however, with the changes, I'd rate it 4!

This was a bit hit!  I added approx. 1 1/2 teaspoons of curry powder to the soup mixture.  But that was the only change.  My family all loved it.

I fixed this for guests and it was a big hit. I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, which I think is easier than using frozen since all you do is chop it up and put it in. We will definitely be making this often.

Made as said...didn't change a thing. Should have doubled the recipe...we didn't have left-overs to "firm up".  Though the mumbling, I think I heard my son say it's "a keeper".  LOVED this...thanks for sharing

This was pretty good but I made a few changes.I added about a half a pack of taco seasoning which gave it a nice spice and a little bell pepper.The only thing that bothered me was it was so saucy when it first got done so I coooked some noodles to with it.I liked it better as a left over.After it had been in the frig it firmed up and was really good.My husband thought it was good either way
