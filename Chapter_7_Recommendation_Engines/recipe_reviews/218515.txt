VERY GOOD! I wasn't able to allow this to simmer for an hour, b/c I had to run out, but this was wonderful even w/o doing that. I only used 3 strips of bacon, and a bag of regular spinach that I tore up. This had great flavor, and, not that it needed it, but I think next time I may add a little crushed pepper flakes just for a little spice. I will def be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Definitely a keeper in our house.  I didn't use an entire head of garlic but it was still good.  It did need salt and pepper though.

I didn't have "navy beans" so I used Garbanzo Beans and Red Kidney Beans.  What a treat!

Pretty good.  I took a few bites before I realized I forgot the lemon, so I squeezed it on.  The lemon really adds dynamic to the dish.  I thickened the dish up with some flour and served it like a stew.

Have made this recipe several times and REALLY enjoy it!  Not a big fan of un-crisp bacon, so I cook the bacon first to a crispy state, remove it and sweat the onions in the bacon fat.  Do everything else as the recipe is written.  That way, the bacon taste stays for the simmering, then I sprinkle the crisp bacon on the end result.  Just my preference.

I just tried this recipe and I don't understand what I did wrong. It is very good but I didn't have any liquid except from the can of  beans. I kept looking at the ingredients to see if I missed anything. One lady said she thickened it by using flour and water. I didn't have any liquid. Did I miss something?

This was great! I let my onions get a little brown so they added a little caramel color to liquid, I also crisped my bacon, and added chicken broth because there wasn't enough liquid for me, AND I added some cubes of chicken tenderloin (seasoned and lightly browned) to satisfy hubby's "meat tooth".

Delicious!  What a great combo of flavors.  This paired nicely with chicken.  I used Northern beans, since I had them on hand.

Used dried beans (1/2 pound, soaked overnight).  Used bacon fat.  Used 3 cloves garlic (the recipe submitter must have meant clove not head of garlic).  Added one 15 ounce can chicken broth.  Used a combo of fresh swiss chard from my garden and beet greens since I had just purchased some fresh beets.  Yes, I made a pile of changes, but it was still the same basic recipe.

I forgot to add the lemon juice at the end, but it was still delicious. The only thing I didn’t like was the saltiness of the dish.

Haven't made it yet.  By stating to use use one head of garlic,,that will be much!  Did you wish to say, one clove of garlic?

Big change from your normal type of beans. This recipe is outstanding ! I varied quite a bit because I had dried beans, don't care for canned. Fixed beans on stove and added salt & pepper with chicken broth instead of water. Cooked until liquid almost gone, only 90 minutes. While beans cooked I separately sautéed onion & celery adding 3 cloves of garlic, about 10 minutes. I added to beans also adding 2 more cups of chicken broth and turned down very low. I fried nearly an entire 12 oz.package of bacon and tore into small pieces. I added 6 pieces when I dumped the baby spinach into the pot. I also squeezed half a lemon into the mix and turned the heat down on simmer for about 30 minutes so spinach would wilt. For sure a keeper and will be great when it's cold out.

We enjoyed this dish and I will make this again. The only change I made was, doubling the recipe and adding 1/2-3/4 teaspoon of summer savory (which I think compliments the  navy beans).

This is a recipe from my childhood. I don't remember it being served with bacon so I left it out and it tasted great. Family also liked it and have asked to have it again.

Easy and delicious.  I cut back on the amount of bacon, onion and garlic to fit our family taste but still so delicious.

I really like this recipe, but disagree with the number of servings.  I would say at most this would be 2 small servings or one large serving.  I followed exactly, except used 3 slices of bacon instead of 5 because I was using thick cut bacon and I didn't have pinto beans, so I used Cannelini beans.  It is a great comfort food with nice flavor!

Very good.  I tried with lemon and without.  Both great.  Love all the tasty and healthy ingredients.  Very simple to make.  30-45 minutes simmering time was plenty.

Fantastic soup!!  I didn't have canned navy beans so I used prepared  dry beans.  I doubled the recipe and so glad that I did so I would have a some to freeze!  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  The lemon made this soup!  YUM.

I didn't have navy beans.  Used cannaleni  [white
kidney beans]  beans instead.  I also added some grated onion & red pepper flakes.  Personal choice.
I like food with a bite.  Delicious & sooo healthy 
too.  Next time I might add a little shredded carrot
for color.  My grandma always liked to top her spinach dishes with chopped up hard boiled eggs so it would look more appetizing!
