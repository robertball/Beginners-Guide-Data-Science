This dish is pretty good. I made a double batch because I had guest coming, and I had lots of pork to use, I also added an onion. I think the cooking time is a bit long. Also it wasn't too spicy, which is okay because kids were also eating it and they liked it just how it was. But the adults added more red pepper flakes at the table. I was worried it was going to be "too" spicy because of other reviews, but it ended up to be too mild! This kind of food is supposed to be spicy. I also think one more piece of advice would be not to put in the peppers until later because mine were very soggy. I would make this again, but I would add the fresh peppers later, lessen the cooking time, and add more spice.

Oh my word!!!  This was so good words cannot express it!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only thing I did different was I only added 3 tablespoons of peanut butter instead of 4!  It was outstanding we served it with coconut rice for the best THAI experience ever!  I will be making this again and again...the pork was so tender it was unreal.  Thank you to whoever came up with the recipe!

This is great! I made a couple of changes...I didn't have time to cook it on low for 8-9 hours, so I cooked it on low for about an hour, and then cooked on high for 4. It turned out wonderfully. Near the end of cooking, I threw in some sliced shiitake mushrooms, took the pork out, and let the mushrooms cook down in the sauce. I think next time, I'm going to add a little sugar for a little sweetness, and I'm going to try to find some low-sodium teriyaki sauce...it was really salty. I served the pork with jasmine rice (that I cooked with 2 tablespoons of sugar to 1 cup of rice to counter the saltiness) and shelled edamame. I think this is the best thing that's ever come out of my slow cooker. I also recommend using a slow cooker liner for less mess. Definitely a keeper!

my one and a half year old devoured this and my six year old ate 2 helpings! It was a little salty, so maybe low sodium teriyaki! All in all, definately a repeater!

Fireguy, this is a winner at our house. It turned out so pretty, we enjoyed an impromptu candlelit dinner with chinaware, crystal, silver the works! I had to come up with a homemade concoction to dub teriyaki sauce (Worcestershire sauce, honey, and fresh ginger). This was just the right combination of hot, sweet, and smooth. Don't skip the lime if you can at all help it. Would give it another star, if I could. Served with a puree'd veggie soup, a tossed salad, and rice. Company special and so, so easy! Thanks for posting.

Absolutely the best pork chops I have ever eaten. Bar none. I did use quite a bit more peanut butter than called for but the gravy was just out of this world.

I thought this was swell, easy and very tasty. I used pork tenderloins and cooked in the crock pot for 8 hours as suggested. Next time, I'll not go out for the day! I could have cooked it less time and had some juice. I had to add some water in order to make the very tasty sauce. This has the potential for 5 stars!

Delicous!  this is now my favorite pork loin recipe.  To cut down on saltiness I used low sodium teriyaki.  I also only cooked for 6 hours on low and it was still moist and fell apart easily.  I served this with rice and the "Sweet and Spicy Swiss Chard" recipe from this site.  great meal!

Excellent, everybody wanted seconds. Made my own teriyake kinda combo after looking at a few recipes. 1/2 C low sodium soy, 1/4 c honey, 1/4 cup garlic wine vinegar, 2 t. red pepper flakes, and 3 T pickled ginger(because I had it. Puured over a 3 lb boneless pork loin roast. Slow cooker high for 3 hrs. AT 3 hours added 4 cups mini peppers, red, yellow and orange cut in quarters, 1 coarsely chopped onion and a 1/2 can chic broth (low sodium). 2 more hours at low. occasionally basted and turned pork. For pnut sauce, 2 Cups creamy pnut butter(because I had it) and mix w/the rest of the can of chic broth. Mixed well, removed roast stirred in and returned roast. 10 min-20 min max on warm. Serve on platter w/diced green onions, rice pilaf and a green sald. Yummy. Plenty of
leftover sauce to spoon on rice and pork. A WINNER.

I am giving this 3 stars - the hubby would probably give it 4 stars - I won't make this again...Cooking for 8 or 9 hours - the pork would be WAY overcooked.  I did mine for about 4 -5 hours and had to turn it to warm.  The peanut butter didn't really give a Thai taste to the dish - but more of a "film" of peanut butter taste in my mouth.  The peppers REALLY need to be added late in the cooking time otherwise they are mush.  Thank you for a good idea - but I won't make this again.  :(

Next time I will definitely use Low Salt Teriyaki and Peanut Butter!  It was great tasting but just too salty.  Will definitely it again.

Good stuff! I had an entire two pound porkloin. I used about 3/4 of it and put the rest in the freezer for some other use. I sliced the rest of the tenderloin into four very thick slices. I seared them, then tossed the minced garlic into the pan for 30 seconds to open up the flavor of the garlic. I put it in the crockpot with the rest of the ingredients including a couple dashes of fish sauce, a tbl of sherry, and LOW SODIUM (very important) Teriyaki. I put it on high for about two and half hours, took the meat out when it was cooked through, and just starting to turn tender to prevent it from turning into pulled pork, I then cut it into chunks, meanwhile whisk in the peanut butter (added one spoonful at a time until I got the desired peanutty taste) and added the sliced bell pepper. The slurry will taste a bit salty, but that will subside as the sauce develops with further cooking. Put the meat back in, and set it on low another two hours, before adding a few chopped green onions and a good amount of fresh cilantro. I love cilantro, and it really lends a nice fresh flavor to a dense dish. Served over Jasmine rice, with snow peas, and cool cucumbers on the side. Would make again!

This recipe was pretty good, a little bit too much peanut butter in my opinion, it came out a bit strong. One mistake I made was I put everything in the crock pot the night before and then just woke up and started cooking it. This didn't work out too well because the pork absorbed the teriyaki sauce and it made the port VERY salty. The pork tasted very different from the gravy because of this. Overall very nice recipe though.

We love this recipe! I made a few small adjustments:  I double the red pepper flakes, we like it spicy, and it was bland with the listed.  I also put in the fresh red pepper 2 hours before it is done so the skin doesn't fall off and the pepper disintegrate.  Also, for those of you who think this is too salty, you need to use a good, thick, sweet teriyake like La Choy, the taste is totally different than the thinner ones.  Great recipe!

I doubled the recipe. Upon reading a lot of the reviews and hearing that it was quite salty, I used 2/3 cups soy sauce and supplemented the rest of the cup with water (remember I doubled the recipe!), which seemed to do the trick. I only cooked it for 6 hours on low and that was more than enough. Added the bell pepper about 3 hours in. It was really delicious... Nice and peanuty with a really nice underlying, just right, spiciness!

I have made this recipe three times.  The first time with pork and the last two times with chicken.  I triple the sauce and add additional veggies (red, orange and yellow peppers, snap peas and mushrooms).  I add the vegetables at the end when I add the peanut butter so they are crispy. and cook for about 30 minutes.  I do not triple the crushed red pepper flakes.  My husband adds additional red flakes to his portion.

This is excellent. I did not use bell peppers as I am on the only one in my family who likes them. I also added 1/4 t of sesame oil and used 4 cloves of garlic (we are big on garlic). I also only had chunky peanut butter and I think the texture added to the uniqueness of this dish. Will make again and again. I also think I will try this with chicken to see if that will work. This was very well recieved by even the pickiest of eaters.  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy and good!  I used pork chops and cut them up into strips and used chinese noodles to serve it on.  Cooked the pork in the slow cooker for five hours on low, then turned it to high for another hour,  adding the peanut butter in the last ten minutes.  I also garnished with crushed peanuts and lime wedges.  Very tasty, and got six meals out of it.

This recipe was so delicious. Only change I would make is to double the sauce, just a personal preference. I made this again and doubled the sauce, wow so good.

Made this today and after reading lots of the reviews I was worried about saltiness or the pork getting overcooked but it was delicious with these tips I pulled from the reviews.  I used regular teriyaki sauce (it was what I had on hand) and to avoid sodium overkill I added a spoon-full of honey and about a 1/4 cup of water.  I also used all natural unsalted PB.   It cooked on low for about 6 hours and I basted the pork about once an hour and I would not exceed that time.  I also added an extra clove of garlic and about 1/2 tsp extra red pepper flakes, we like spice but this was not overkill.  I waited to add the red peppers with only ~2 hours left and (because I love them) added mushrooms after I mixed in the peanut butter. YUM!  My husband also really enjoyed it.  I think one key to keeping the spice and not letting the peppers get too soggy is to leave them mostly laying on top of the pork as opposed to swimming in the sauce.

I don't know if it was my teriyaki sauce (I used the kikkoman brand) or what but it came out so salty. I was able to save it, however, and it came out fabulous! Before I added the PB, I took out half the sauce and replaced it with water. Along with the PB, I added about 2T of honey and 1T of sugar and 1t of ground ginger. The flavor of the sauce came out amazing. I then added some green beans and broccoli to the crockpot and cooked for an additional 10 mins. Also, do NOT cook this for 8-9 hours! Mine was overdone at 5 hours on low.

Maybe it was the brand of teriyaki sauce I used but it was way way way to salty. Almost inedible, it was so salty. Also adding the peppers at the beginning ensures you will be left with mush by the end. Needs a few tweaks, then it will be good but based on as written, it left a lot to be desired.

One of the most terrible recipes I've ever tried. Don't cook lean pork loin in a crock pot - its way too easy to dry out/over cook. But even if you do, you should NEVER cook it for 8-9hours!!! That's insane! Mine was overcooked in 3 hours. Also, it was WAY too salty.

This was just excellent. I didn't have any teriyaki sauce on hand, so I looked online for a homemade teriyaki sauce recipe and used that. Other than that, I made no changes, and this will now go in my permanent recipe file for repeat appearances to my husband's great delight. Don't skip the garnish of green onions and peanuts!

I made this using a pork tenderloin and added water chestnuts and baby corn.  I served it on chinese bean noodles garnished with cilantro, green onions, peanuts and lime.  My terribly picky meat and potatoes crew loved it!

Excellent recipe! I do not own a slow cooker so I prepared it in the large non-stick pot on low heat with tightly closed lid. It took about 3 hrs to prepare. I halfed the teriyaki sauce, and used crunchy PB because that's the only type I had. It came out wonderful! All my family went for seconds. Next time I would add more peppers, more PB and maybe a splash of white wine to make more sauce.

I did not care for this recipe. I was skeptical of the "too salty" reviews, and I should have listened. The teriyaki sauce and peanut butter do not go well together.

I give this four because it definitely needs some tweaks but with them it was good.  8 hours is WAY too long!  I made it with chicken so cooked on high for about two but 8 hours still would have been too much for pork.  I added some garlic and didn't have teryaki so I subbed out an asian dipping sauce that's similar. 

I would also put the veggies in with or even after the peanut butter whatever veggies you use.  8 hours in a slow cooker does not a yummy veggie make!

But thanks for a great base to something my boyfriend just ADORED... and he can be very picky!

Awesome flavor!  I think cooking this dish on low for 8 hrs. makes the chops dry.  I think I could have shaved off a few hours and it would have been perfect!

I was excited to make this dish, but disappointed with the end result. The sauce was not very good, way to salty, tasted odd. The cooking time is off to as so many others have stated. I cooked my frozen pork chops on low for 5 hours and they were done. This is a good idea for a recipe, but I wouldn't make this one again.

This was very good. I followed the recipe exactly except I used pork loin roast instead of pork tenderloin, as I have not had good results cooking pork tenderloin in the slowcooker generally.  This was the right amount of spicy for me, but I do not like very spicy food.

This was an interesting one...overall, we enjoyed it, but I think maybe it depends on the teriyaki sauce you use? I used a more soy sauce consistency teriyaki- I think I would've liked more flavor. Anyway, I also loved really peanut-y peanut sauce, so I wished I put more peanut butter in. I already added a little more than I should've! But, it was nice to have a different kind of dinner- I put the pork and sauce over some whole wheat noodles and snow peas- I'll try it again with another teriyaki sauce.

Very good recipe. I didn't add the bell pepper until about an hour before serving time and that solved the complaint of them being mushy.  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have any rice vinegar, so I substituted apple cider vinegar with a pinch of sugar. The flavor combination of peanut butter and teriyaki sauce is delicious!

I made these by recipe but realized quickly the pork chops would get a little dry. make sure you keep the chops slightly coveed with liquid. to take the saltiness in charge either add a little water or honey. also if by the timethe chops are done you believe the sauce is too liquid you can always thicken it with flour or breadcrumbs. remember the peanut butter will take some the liquid and also of you serve over rice that the rice will sill soak up some liquid. Loved this recipe! My husband couldn't get enough of it and ate everything although he already felt full. Will definately make this again.

Wow, I was really surprised that this didn't turn out well after reading all the reviews here.  I followed the recipe except I left out the red bell peppers.  The pork was dry and the sauce was a little weird and salty.  I added a little honey at the end to doctor it up which helped a bit.  I don't think I'll make it again.

I got the recipe from the magazine and followed those cooking instructions, cook meat in sauce for 2hours, add red pepper cook until soft about 45 minutes. It was juicy and delicious. 9 hours Wow the pork would be all dried and tough!!

Always looking for quick and easy crock pot recipes my husband and son will enjoy - and this is one of them!  Easy to prep the night before, doesn't require alot of unusual ingredients, fast to get going before I leave for work, and we all loved it.  Would like to try to use leftovers in fried rice recipe, but there aren't any. Authentic Thai or not, who cares?  Love the peanuty taste - Winner!

These were fabulous!  My whole family loved them, even my picky two year old.  The only thing I changed was I reduced the red pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp because the little one doesn't handle spicy things to well yet.  I served them over rice noodles.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

I followed the exact recipe and it was pretty good. I will make it again w/ a couple of small changes. I'm going to try to find low sodium teriyaki sauce as it was almost too salty for me. Also, I'm going to cook it a little less as I think it was a bit over done. Loved all the flavors though and can't wait to have it again!

Made this tonight and turned out wonderful. I basted the pork loin throughout the day and loved the flavor of this dish. I omitted the bell pepper and the green onion as I had none and frankly didn't miss it. Will keep this one and make again!

My pork was plenty done and tender in 5 hours and ,as others, I added the peppers in the last hour. The teriyaki was a little overwhelming (I make my own teriyaki sauce so maybe mine was stronger). I could hardly taste the peanut butter and I added extra. BF enjoyed it more than I did but it's not an unpleasant dish, just not what I was expecting.

I thought I followed this recipe exactly but I think the issue was that I used thin, lean pork loin chops. I don't think the meat had enough fat and there was not enough liquid in the recipe. The result was that this was cooked to a crisp! Based on other reviews I might try again but I would go for a cut of pork that was not so thin/lean and I would add more liquid.

SUPER yummy!  We used Newman's asian dressing, lower fat than Kraft.  We also added a bag of frozen stir fry veggies and a can of water chestnuts.  Served with brown rice and it was delish!  Even the kids loved it.

Both my husband and I enjoyed the flavor of this dish.  Per other reviews, I was worried it would be dry and only put 2 chops in instead of 4 with the same volume of liquid.  I did cook it for 8 hours and it was a bit drier than I was hoping.  I also only used 2 TBSP of peanut butter at the end and it had a nice peanuty flavor that was not overwhelming.  I will definitely make this again, and cook less and try the meat thermometer to make sure the meat is cooked thoroughly.

Very easy. Used a little more peanut butter, and a little less teryaki sauce. Wasn't too salty, but missed the extra bite the right amount of teriyaki sauce would've provided. Will make again.

This turned out really dry.  I actually turned off the crock pot before the recommended time because it was so dry and was actually burning on the bottom.  It didn't have quite enough "spice" to it either.  It was really mild - didn't taste very "Thai" at all.

The pork was tender and fell right off of the bone when spooning out of crock pot. This was a pretty tasty recipe and I'm sure I'll make it again and will likely adjust peanut butter proportion. My family loves peanut butter- however, the recipe amount seemed too much for our palate. Overall, this was a fairly simple recipe to whip together before running Saturday afternoon errands. If you have a thermometer, I'd suggest using it after five hours or so as the pork took less time than called for and overdone pork is not fun to eat.

Very easy, tasty dish! I followed directions, but after five hours I checked the pork temperature -- it was already fully cooked... and we weren't eating for another three hours. I kept it on warm, but it was really more "done" than I prefer. Next time, I'll shorten the cooking time and maybe use just a little less peanut butter -- then it will be perfect!

I and my husband thought this absolutely delicious! The only changes I made was to increase the sauce (I had a scant 1/4 cup left in a bottle I wanted to use up) and I I increased the peanut butter to 3/4 cup - personal preference.  I cooked on high for 2 hours then decreased to low for 3.  The pork was perfectly tender and so flavorful.  I served this over coconut rice (not the one referred to here) with a side of steamed broccoli.  This is my favorite Thai recipe and will definitely  place this in our regular lineup!

I followed the recipe as presented here, served it over brown steamed rice and it turned out just like the picture. It was good, and certainly easy as can be, but I wasn't wowed. The taste was rather bland. Don't think I'll be making this one again.

In particular, I loved the red peppers in this.  At first, I thought there would be too many, however, they cook down a great deal. Now when I make it  I tend to add a bit more.  Yes, I've made this multiple times now.  And the leftovers are the best! If you put them in the oven to reheat, you get a bit of a carmelized crust around the edges and those are some of the most delicious pieces pork.

I did not have any peppers but followed the directions except for that item. Only had crunchy peanut butter also. The recipe was delicious. Very flavorful. My husband loved it too. Want to try it with boneless chicken also. Will definitely be making this again!

These pork chops are absolutely amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, except for the cooking time was a bit too long. I cooked mine on high for about 5 hours. This is definitely a dish I will be making many more times!!

This was really good and easy. I left out the peppers and added an onion.  I also made my teriyaki sauce and served the pork with Asian coconut rice.

My husband & I love this recipe! I used a pork tenderloin, marinated it all day in the sauce, then roasted it at 400 degrees for 45 minutes. I added the red bell pepper the last 15 minutes so it would have a little crunch, and maintain the red color. It's really not the meat so much as the sauce. I'm sure you could substitute chicken, and maybe even beef. Be sure to use the thick, sweet teriyaki. I used Soy Yay teriyaki with sesame seeds. I served it with Asian coconut rice, also from this website.

I made this tonight with some changes. First, this doesn't have to be made in the slow cooker... I took a large pan and cooked the garlic, peppers, and added onion in olive oil for about 5 min. Then added some cut up chicken breasts. After cooking for about 10 minutes I added the teriyaki, rice vinegar, and peanut butter and cooked for another 10 minutes.  I put it over rice noodles and topped with the green onion, peanuts, and slice of lime.   Very good recipe for general peanut sauce but it depends on how good your store bought teriyaki is. Mine was very good!

My husband and kids love this recipe, it has become an "once every two weeks dish" for us. The only change I made was that I prefer to use homemade teriyaki sauce instead of bottled. I serve it over Jasmine rice.

I'm not v experienced using a crock pot, so I didn't deviate from the recipe (oh, I did omit the red pepper flakes as my kids don't like them.) Have to say that this turned out WAY better than I expected! The sauce is soooo delicious, and it actually tastes just as good without peanut butter! The only things I would do differently is to cook on High for 2 hours - 3 hours was too long, and the chops had dried out a bit. Also, I would add the peppers after an hour so they retain a bit of crunch. But anyway, this is a wonderful dish. Thanks!

Definitely need to make more for four people (select 12 servings) for leftovers!  Family loved it!  We put 1 1/2 times the amount of red pepper.

Funny thing is that in spite of the fact that it did not turn out as expected, I loved it anyways more than I would have thought.  I ended up cooking about 2/3 of the amount of pork (adjusting the recipe accordingly).  My pork looked nothing like the picture, as it broke up (being very tender) after only about 5 hours.  So, it looked more like a sort of stew....but wow, was it tasty!

Based upon prior reviews, I doubled the red pepper flakes, added the red bell peppers towards the end and only cooked for 6hrs.  

I tasted this at 5hrs and realized that the meat didn't seem to have 'much' flavor so I added a bit more teriyaki sauce. 

I realized at the end of the 6hrs that I didn't have creamy peanut butter, only crunchy.  It actually worked out great by adding the peanuts as the peanut butter melted into the sauce.  

The changes made this a wonderful dish.  We served it over teriyaki noodles and will be making this one again.

My husband and I loved this dish! Only thing I'll do differently next time is put the peppers in the last hour of cooking. They were a little too mushy and the skins peeled off while cooking.

This was excellent! I sliced up a pork roast and layered it over the red peppers. I also added some water to the crock pot to bring the braising liquid up a bit. The cooking time was off as my dish cooked on low in six hours!
I will make this dish again and again!

Very good.  My only suggestion is be to make more of the teriyaki sauce mixture.  It melts into the pork after about four hours and it is really so good it can be enjoyed with thai rice.  I ended up adding more sauce and we loved it.

We did not like this recipe at all.  Pork was dry and overcooked even though I cooked it for half the time.  Sauce was extremely salty.

This made my house smell SO delicious!  But I wish I had not added the peanut butter at the end. It was way to much for for me (and I love PB) And it seemed perfect before I added it. Also the cook time was to long. I will try it again without the PB and for less cook time. I had it with jasmine rice, and will do that again!

Really lovely meal with Rice and a steamed vegatable.  I next time I will substitute half of the teriyaki with soy sauce - the flavor was very strong and could stand to be toned down a little.

I'm eating this right now, and it's pretty darn good! It was so simple to make and my house has smelt amazing all day!  I made it as the recipe states and served it over coconut rice (white rice in the rice cooker substituting coconut milk for water). I love the lime with it. It would be great with pad thai noodles as well.  Is it authentic Thai? I can't say and I don't care...will definetly make again!

This was a pretty good dish.  I used white wine vinegar since I didn't have rice vinegar and I added 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.  Instead of red pepper flakes, I used 1/8 teaspoon of cayanne pepper.  I found the dish to be a little spicy for my preschooler.  Also, the boneless pork chops I used were done in about 6 hours.

this recipe was disappointing. the terikyaki sauce overpowered the tasty pork. i made some additions including adding warm water, ginger, lime juice and a clove of garlic. i expected something a little more authentic,lighter flavored more like chinese. i would add roasted red peppers, and warm them through, the skins were stringy. i will try this again with some modifications

I made my own teriyaki sauce from a chicken recipe on the site and used low sodium soy sauce to make that.  Then when adding normal peanut butter there wasn't too much salt, but I still think it doesn't need the full amount.  Used the extra sauce on top of fried rice and it was amazing!

Amazing dish.  I followed the cooking time and my peppers liquefied into a beautiful sauce, I just shredded the pork in the pot and whisked the peanut butter in and let it sit for another hour.  The green onions, whole roasted peanuts and fresh squeezed lime over it was lovely.  It's mild so it's perfect for most people.  We added a ton of rooster sauce (hot chili sauce) and were in heaven.  Thanks for an amazing recipe and perfect for lazy cookers like me!

I was salty, I mean really salty. There needs to be something else in the broth to balance the saltyness of the teriyaki and vinegar. I could have used some spice too it as well. Maybe adding some sirachi chili sauce would have balanced the dish. Overall, not all that impressed

I halved the red pepper flakes because of my daughter's dislike of hot food, but for my own preferences, I would use 3/4 tsp. instead. I happened to have boneless tenderloin, and the meat was very tender. I used a gluten-free teriyaki. I also squeezed the juice of one lime into the sauce when I added the peanut butter and the rest when I served. My daughter suggested cashews if I make it again. Next time, I'll add either a squirt of honey or a couple tablespoons of brown sugar, 1/2 tsp. ground or 1" grated fresh ginger root, and though it's pretty, I won't necessarily spring for the red peppers but go with green instead. The fresh scallions on top and the lime really give this dish a kind of subtle complexity that I don't usually find in slow-cooker recipes. A definite keeper!

This is very good. I cut the recipe in half and it didn't seem like enough sauce, but it turned out very well. My boyfriend requested additional red pepper flakes next time, but all in all, very tasty.

I followed the directions exactly, and this dish did not turn out as well as I hoped. The flavor was nice, but not very Thai tasting, and the Pork Chops came out dry. I would have oped for a thicker sauce as well. Perhaps fattier pork and less teriyaki and more peanut butter? Not really sure, so I will probably try a different recipe next time.

Loved it!!! I used low sodium teriyaki sauce per a few suggestions.  I cooked it for 7 1/2 hrs and the chops were a little dry.  Next time I'm only going to cook for 6 hrs and I'm sure they will be just right. Thanks Fireguy

LOVED this! I couldn't stop eating it. I finally took the leftovers to my mom and sister who immediately asked me for the recipe. I didn't have rice vinegar so used red wine vinegar instead. Still was awesome and that is not a word I use often because it is so overused and I find it annoying - but in this case WOW. Very yummy. Can't wait to use it with chicken and next time I will double the sauce. Thanks for such a great (and easy) recipe.

Great! I could not find low sodium teriyaki and had to add one pint of chicken broth mixed in 5-6 TBS flour to reduce the salty taste. I added the veggies (+onion and fresh mushrooms) the last hour-perfect! Everyone loved this dish. I served over Thai-style rice noodles. I only cooked 3 hours. It was delicious and the meat was juicy.

Very Very good - My husband put a full cup of peanut butter in instead of 1/4 cup (completely by mistake), PLUS, I didn't have the time to cook it in a slow cooker, it still turned out excellent.  Will be making again next week in the crock pot!

Delicious! Knowing that slow cooking concentrates the flavor, I stirred in 1/2 cup water before stirring in the peanut butter.  So great!  Will definately be making again.

I made this exactly the way the recipe read.  I did not put the lime on the plate cause I forgot.  This was great, I wouldn't change a thing.  My husband and daughter loved it as well.  I was nervous about messing with the pork my husband likes a certain way but he was as crazy about it as I was.  I served it with rice and broccoli, poured the gravy that was delightful all over the rice and also added some of those green onions and peanuts in the rice and WOW!!!!!  You gotta try this recipe, it's the BomB!!!!!!!

My husband and I both loved this -- he's a meat-eater and I'm not, so I just broiled xtra firm tofu cubes and added them toward the end of the cooking time.  Added the bell pepper 60 minutes before the end of cook time and it came out perfect.  My husband said if he'd ordered this at a restaurant, he would definitely go back to get it again!  Thanks for a great recipe, this will go into our permanent rotation! (Also great with chicken.)

I made a 3.5lb pork loin and it was done in 3 1/2 hours on low.  It was done 3 1/2 hours before our guests arrived so I placed it on warm in the crock pot and I think that may have dried it out a bit, but  next time I will def. cook it less. It was very tasty as I had used the sauce as a gravy over the pork and brown rice that I made with it.  It was great!

I doubled the garlic and the peanut butter.  Shredded the pork put it back in the slow cooker with the peanut butter for 15 min more cooking, served it over basmati rice with a squeeze of lime on top.  I don't know if the natural peanut butter I used made a difference, but my version wasn't salty like others have said.

I used 4 boneless pork loin chops that equaled 1.32 pounds (twice the amount called for in the recipe), 1/3 cup low sodium teriyaki sauce (Kikkoman), added 1/4 cup water, and used organic peanut butter with no salt added, and the dish was still too salty.  I added some curry to make it spicier, but the recipe as it is must be really really really salty and the way I altered it, the food was really really salty, if that tells you anything.

So outrageously good. I wasn't sure about the two red peppers, but by the time they were done cooking in the sauce they were delicious. I did only use 1/2 teaspoon of the crushed red pepper flakes and it was good, but I think the full teaspoon would have been fine, too.

Well first of all my mistake was using SEASONED rice vinegar, which is all they had at the store. Big no no. Way too salty tasting.  Other than that, cook time is far to long on this one. You would probably be good at 6 hours. Should of monitored this one, but I let it go while i was at work. Overcooked.  Other than that, not to much thai flavor either. I have previously made thai style ribs from a southern living recipe and they were fantastic, but I think this recipe needs a lot of work to be tasting like thai or even worth the 4 star rating.

I followed this recipe exactly how it read. I cooked it for 8 1/2 hours and the pork was very tender and tasty, but the peanut butter flavor was too strong. Neither my husband or myself enjoyed it.

this recipe was very tasty but I had issues with the pork--the suggested time for it to cook was way too long and left it dry and flaky...everything else was great though and I didn't have the salt issue like others since I used low sodium teriyaki sauce...and there was a ton of sauce left over so I cooked up some noodles and now have a nice thai noodle dish for lunch! I will definitely try this again but over a weekend when I can watch the pork and make sure it doesn't get overcooked!! I recommend trying--the sauce was just like at a thai restaurant!

The recipe called for the meat to cook too long. It turned out more like a stew and that wasn't expected. Also, when it came time for me to take out the meat the  peppers had pretty much disolved in the sauce and nothing but the skins were left over. Gross! I might have to do some revising b/c the flavor I can work with.

I used the magazine version of this recipe and it was perfect.  Cook on low for two hours before adding bell peppers and cooking for another hour.  Soft, tender pork that was cooked through and delicious meal that my kids also enjoyed.  That's a win in my book.

This was extraordinarily bland and dry. I cubed the meat to gain some moisture. If I make it again, I will add more teriyaki and fish sauce.

My husband and I lobe Tai food so I was super excited to try this. I think it turned out great!! Definitely need the lime to cut the salt of the premade Teriyaki sauce...I think I might get a bottle of reduced sodium or just make my own (which kind of defeats the purpose of it being a “quick” dinner lol)

I will definitely make it again.  I used boneless pork chops which came out tender and tasty!  The creamy peanut butter thickens the juices and adds more flavor.  The toasted peanuts and green onions were perfect!

I bought a whole pork loin roast and cut my own chops for much less money than if I had paid for the pre-cut chops. I served it with the coconut rice and everything was delicious. I added some roasted root vegetables to complete the meal and served everything to our company. The reviews from them convinced me that this is a recipe I will certainly make again!

I’m giving this five stars because the flavor was amazing. I cooked the pork loin chops for 8 hours on low and I think it was a bit too long because the meat was somewhat dry. The next time I make this I’m going to cook on low for 6 hours.  Other than cooking time I wouldn’t change a thing.

I really enjoyed this easy flavorful dish, but my wife LOVED it.  So, obviously a great success.  I served it over nutty, brown rice and the flavors blended well.  I used regular pork tenderloins and their tenderness and flavor were super.  I thought it was a great recipe as presented......

We absolutely loved this recipe. I used 2lbs of country-style ribs and cooked them for 6 hours. I added the peppers half way through so they weren't over cooked. Otherwise I followed the recipe and will definitely make this again,maybe with chops next time.

Tasted pretty good but very spicy for our tastes. The sauce was thinner than we would have liked but the pork was really tender. We made jasmine rice to go with it, which went well with the meal.

We really enjoyed this meal.  The only difference we did was add a little bit more peanut butter and a few more red pepper flakes.  We served the Thai Peanut Port over rice and everyone swore it better than the Thai restaurant in town.

To begin the only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it was a slow cooker recipe. I am very unsuccessful with slow cooker recipes. In fact, the only one I use is one my mother made herself. Other than that the only one I would make again is this one. Pretty tasty for a slow cooker recipe.

i have made a lot of recipes from this site and have rarely been disappointed.  this recipe was stellar!  in my haste i forgot the pepper and in the end the green onions and peanuts - all which are now languishing in my fridge. the only thing i did wrong was to freeze the leftover because no sooner in the freezer than i wanted more. it was great two days later for unexpected company - who immediately asked for the recipe. i will most certainly make this again!!

This is quite good but don’t cook it 8 hours. This dries it out. Also, use only the amount of peanut butter in the recipe. If you use more it overpowered the sauce

This was really good! Only change I made was to add a little corn starch to thicken the sauce when I added the peanut butter. Heat was just right for me.....a little warm but not scorching! Will definitely make again!

My picky husband liked this recipe. Well I say this recipe, by the time he got done it was not the same. We did not use the Terriyaki sauce but instead used Sweet Chili sauce from Maggi and he would not add the peanut butter. We did put crushed peanuts over the top as it was dished. We cut the amount of pepper flakes in half. I would have rated it a 3 and he thought a five so I give it and average score of 4.

Will make again,  but made a few changes.  I added a chopped onion under the meat and because I made a double batch and used thick cut pork chops, it needed almost the full 8 hours to get really tender.  I added a bag of baby carrots and the red pepper when it had about  2.5 to 3 hours left, otherwise they would have been mush.  I cut the red pepper flakes way down or it would have been too spicy for us.  Thickened the sauce at the end with a cornstarch slurry to make it a gravy consistency. We did the whole green onion, peanuts and lime at the end and honestly,  it didn't need it.  Will skip all of those next time.  Had good flavor and was easy to make.

Delicious! I only used two pork loin chops, for two people. I still used the amount called for with the other ingredients. I doubled the amount of peanut butter, we love peanut butter in Asian recipes. I topped a healthy rice with pork chops and sauce, making sure to get a heaping amount of red peppers on top. Made a full meal. I only cooked it in the crockpot for approximately five hours. Started the crock on high to get the sauce bubbling, then turned it down to medium low. Will make next time for company to enjoy.

Only takes 4-5 hours to cook, not 8-9 and I added more peanut butter and nuts than the recipe calls for, but it was delicious and I will make it again.  Thank you for the receipe

This was excellent. Not familiar with Thai food, so this was a great introduction. My husband ate two helpings. Served over Wild Rice. I really didn't change anything except add one more pepper. I would add a total of 4 peppers next time with a white onion. I would also add some mushrooms, broccoli, snow peas and water chestnuts in the last 2 hours. There was certainly enough sauce to support the added veggies.

Delicious and easy to fix! Broth/gravy/sauce was a bit thin. Added onions and doubled the garlic as another cook mentioned.

Ugh the cooking time is way way too long for pork chops. The sauce cooked down so far it was almost burnt. Even used low sodium teriyaki sauce and it was still way too salty.

I added finely chopped jalepeno for heat. The teriyaki sauce I used was a little more saucy with some spices already added and slightly thicker than Kikkoman version (from Aldi).  I used very thick boneless pork chops cooked on low for 2 hours then on high for one hour after reading the reviews of pork being overcooked and mine was perfectly cooked. Also increased peanut butter to 1\2 cup because I like it peanutty. Served over brown rice. Everyone liked it and I would definitely make this again.

We used a 4 lb pork loin since that's what I had on hand.  I was trying to use ingredients that we already have stocked.  So I didn't have peanuts or green onions, but I did chop up some cashews to add.  If I would have had a low sodium Teriyaki sauce, I would definitely use that (I have an aversion to anything that is too salty).  I doubled all of the ingredients since I used 4 lbs for my roast, so may have also cut back slightly on the red pepper flakes.  Overall it was good.  We cut the roast into smaller portions and did more of a mix with the rice like a dish you'd find at a Chinese restaurant.  Next time I'd also add in some veggies (broccoli, peas, etc).

This recipe was very easy to make. I used one chicken breast instead of the pork, but used all the other ingredients. We had enough for 2 with leftovers for 1. I substituted sriracha sauce for the red pepper flakes. I would rate my version as a 5 star. I think it would be really good with cut up sweet potatoes in the recipe. Instead I made them (sweet potato steak fries) on the side. YUM!!!!

4/5 people ate the whole bowl, 1 passed.  was decent but he pork is too lean and is too stringy, the sauce not as thick and peanut-buttery as you would think.  Worth making, but the peppers after cooking for 8 hours disintegrate, so we added some broccoli at then end to have a viable vegetable.  Good, but needs some work.

For the ease and taste, I found this recipe well worth it.  I served with brown jasmine rice.   I added the red pepper a little later in the recipe, as one reviewer recommended.  I  left off the peanuts and scallions just because I forgot to add them, so in my opinion, those are optional.  I made a huge batch and froze some.  It was great.

This was a hit! I used a 4 pound pork loin roast and cut it into chops. Then doubled the recipe. After reading the reviews that stated it was very salty, I used a reduced sodium teriyaki. We also added chopped cilantro and mandarin oranges as a garnish, along with the green onions and chopped spanish peanuts. Will be making again.

Wow.  This one is a little rich for our taste.  The flavor is good but the sauce needs some thinning or something.  Maybe some chicken broth?  It's not a dish I'd want to choke down without a glass of milk.  I put it over fettuccine.  Maybe white rice would have been better.

Simple but used chicken thighs instead and baked in oven, as I don't have a crockpot. The taste was really good. Next time I think I will use pork shoulder, as I think pork chops would be too dry.

We loved this dish and it will be one of my favorites, even with company. We like things spicy but next time I will cut back on the red pepper flakes. I flattened boneless pork chops to lay on the bell pepper, and I whisked in crunchy peanut butter. Tender and tasty.

Very good on a bed of jasmine or basmati rice. I used a small pork roast instead of chops. I also doubled the peanut butter.  Right before dinner, I stir-fried a batch of broccoli and put a serving on top of the rice, then topped that with the pork and sauce. My husband packed himself a leftover container after dinner to bring to work the next day!!! (He liked it MORE than a Culver's Butter Burger! What a compliment...)

This was good. Sort of reminded me of PF Chang's kung pao chicken. Makes me want to cut the meat into chunks first and fry them a bit to get the crispiness of PF Chang's chicken and then just toss with the sauce.

Also added the chopped peppers for the last 10-15 minutes cooking! It turned out great! The only downside was that part of the sauce burnt and stuck to the side of the crockpot (maybe a result of the long cooking time?). Great dish all in all!! :)

I used pork strips since they were on sale. I fully intended to do the 'whole' recipe but the next morning when I was pulling the pork out I accidentally tasted a little and it was FANTASTIC just as it was! I will definitely add the peanut butter, peanuts & green onions next time I make this (heading back to the store for more pork strips while they're still on sale tomorrow!). This was so tender and pulled apart so easily for a nice helping of pulled pork sandwiches and the rest went on a nice bed of brown rice with some grilled carrots as a side the next day. I would have given this a "4 1/2 stars" if it was an option as this wasn't PERFECT, but it was pretty darn close...

I am so glad I read other reviews and cut back the cooking time significantly. I cooked this for 2 hours on high and then about 1 hour on low (plus the time after putting the meat back in after you add the peanut butter). That was probably a little too long as the pork was rather dry.  I also didn't put the peppers in until the last 30 minutes which was great because they were still intact and tasted like peppers not mush. Next time I will whisk some cornstarch into the sauce because I prefer it thicker. Oh, and it is very salty. Unfortunately I couldn't find a low sodium teriyaki sauce, but if you can, it would be a good idea.

Made exactly as directions called and it was a big hit. I didn;t think it was too spicy at all, but may cut back a little on the red pepper next time if making for guests. Father thought it was too spicy.

Got RAVE reviews from my family and especially my grandmother who is very hard to please who noted "pork was especially tender". Presentation is a little hard. I was not sure whether to "mix" everything in the pot (still finding my way with crockpots) or just let it sit as was. I opted to mix, but not until about 2 hours in which disrupted the "fat" from the pork. Next time I will mix immediately and then let sit for the 8 hours. A MUST-TRY! PS. Bonus attraction to get my kid excited about eating it was telling him ahead that it had peanut butter and peanuts!!

Jen mod's to make it easier to make and tastier:  Recipe is great but I made a couple mods that kick it up to 5 stars in my book.  Same ingredients cooked on high for 2 hours worked out just as well and the Planters 5 alarm peanuts (Albeit are good for nothing else) add quite a tasty kick and allow individual control of spicy if you are serving folks with different spice pallets.

I was very excited about trying this recipe.  Everything about it said simple and tasty.  It *was* simple.  I was able to throw everything together this morning in about 20 minutes before heading off to work.  When I got home my house smelled great, but when I tasted the broth I wasn't impressed.  I didn't allow myself to get too discouraged, though, since I had not added the peanut butter yet.  I may get some criticism for this, but I was not happy about how tender my chops were.  They were falling apart into pieces when removing them from the crock-pot, which would have been fine if that is what I was going for, but it wasn't.  I added the peanut butter, put the pork back in and let it cook a little bit longer and tasted the broth again.  Still not happy, I added a couple tablespoons of brown sugar to sweeten it up.  It helped a little, but I still felt disappointed with this dish.  The sauce was too thin, the flavor lacked "something" and I just wasn't happy with my chops falling apart into small chunks.  Overall, this dish just didn't for me.  Too bad.

I liked this recipe.  After reading some reviews I made sure I bought the low sodium teriaki sauce - otherwise I did not alter any ingredients.  Before I left for work, I set a timer so the slow cooker was on low for 5 hours.  I used a pork loin sliced about 1/2 " thick.  I sliced the peppers thinly and added them when I got home along with the peanut butter and cooked for another 20 minutes.  Very good.

We loved the flavor of this recipe, but I have to agree that the cooking time is way too long!  Mine was overdone after 6 hours on low.  Next time I make it I'll check it at 4 hours.  I didn't have any peanuts to chop up and put on top, so I just used my favorite natural chunky peanut butter in the sauce.  Worked like a charm!

This is an awesome dish from a slow cooker!  The fresh toppings are a MUST HAVE to make the meal complete.  Also if you want to stretch the meal cut the chops into bite size pieces and then you have a meaty sauce to serve over rice --restaurant style!

Me and My husband love this dish, I don't even measure anything, I just eyeball it, and I use more crushed red pepper and garlic because we love it. This dish is so easy to make, I must have made it about 10 times already in a year!!!  Yummy!! Thanks to the Firefighter who came up with this!

Pretty good dish.  You do need to watch the time, though, as pork does become dry if overcooked.  I made this in about 6 hours or so, but I started with frozen pork chops.  With defrosted pork chops, I'd say it would be closer to four hours, even on low.  This makes a lot of gravy; I was skeptical at first, but it realy does,  I guess bc of the cooking of the meat and the breaking down of the peppers, which I added in the last 2 hours or so.  I forgot the peanuts and didn't have limes for green onions, so I put dried minced onion in with the sauce and added about a teaspoon of lime juice as well.  This turned out pretty well; I served with yellow rice.  I like the gravy, which may not be exactly Thai but the flavors are good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good and super easy. I used chile paste instead of red pepper flakes, and low sodium teriyaki sauce.  The cooking time was too long, next time I will adjust it.  I took the pork out and cut it into bite sized pieces before I added it back to the sauce.  In addition to the lime and green onion, I topped it with cilantro.  We ate it over steamed jasmine rice.

Loved this recipe!  I did add more of the terriaki and rice vinegar so there would be more sauce.  The pork was tender and so good over rice.  Will definitely make this again!!!

This was outstanding.  I made some changes to add a bit more asian flavour, along with the thai flavour.  I didn't have a re pepper bell pepper so I used a yellow pepper.  Instead of crush red pepper flakes I used 1/4 - 1/3 cup sweet red chili sauce, I didn't have the rice vinegar so I used Oriental vinegar sauce instead.  I added 1/4 cup Hoi Sin sauce, used 3 cloves garlic.  Combine all including peanut butter and teriyaki sauce in a small bowl.  Set aside. Use the cooking spray as it will possibly stick   I used 2 pork tender loin in first.  I put in 1 cup of "Europe's Best" Imperial Blend Frozen veggies, which consists of Edamame Kernels, Snow Peas, Bamboo Shoots, Shitake Mushrooms, Water Chestnuts, Carrots, Red Peppers.  (I'm sure Green Giant Makes something similar).  I put veggies over the top of the pork tender loin.  Took the sauce mixture and poured it over everything.  Served it with white steamed rice.  Of course using the whole pork tender loin you have to slice it prior to serving.  The sliced pork and veggies were encircled by the rice.  I have a very fussy 12 yr. old son and he really enjoyed the combination of all the flavours.  If I can make the 12 yr. old say something then I know it worked.

Yumm! Great crock-pot recipe. This should be shredded pork, not sure why most of the pictures are of the pork still intact. Followed the recipe exactly excepted used bone-in chops. Served with Coconut-Lime rice . Good stuff!

Yummy! I added some more red pepper because I like it really spicy. Coconut rice was my side dish of choice and it went very well with the pork.

Great recipe but I used a teaspoon of Thai Red Curry Paste instead of the crushed pepper.  I also added a cup of water mid-cooking and served over brown long-grain rice.

I'll try this again, only to see if I can do something different.  My husband SAID he liked it but then said the peppers seemed to have a burned taste to them.  I served it with Basmati rice, which is what he likes.

My boyfriend is a very picky eater, and it is always challenging getting him to try new things.  After putting this in front of him, he scoffed it up and said it was the best pork he ever had.  I have now made it several times and will continue to do so!

I served this over brown rice with all the broth. My hubby and 2 year old daughter gobbled it up. I followed the recipe although I added mushrooms and 1/3 of a white onion.  Will def be making this again.

I do not have a slow cooker so I just cooked it all up in a pan.  Served it over some basmati rice with some Asian style veg.

I thought this was very good.  I didn't need food for eight, so I used three good sized pork loin chops (slightly over a pound).  I found that I had plenty of sauce for that amount of meat.  I probably had more than 1/4 cu peanut butter, but really like the peanut flavor.  I completely forgot to serve with the green onions & peanuts, but still liked it quite a bit.  Next time I will probably not add the peppers in until later in the cooking - they do fall apart.  I ended up taking this to work for lunch and bought a bag of Butter & Garlic Uncle Ben's rice because I didn't have time to make any the night before.  It was a good flavor match.

Not only was this dish incredibly easy tp prepare, it was incredibly tasty as well! The pork was fork tender and the sauce got rave reviews from the whole family. Yes, I licked my plate.   Since my slow cooker crapped out sometime during the cooking process, I can't weigh in on how long it cooked to get the desired tenderness of the pork.   I will definitley be making this again!

This dish is one that simply should have been better than it was.  I cooked my pork about 7 1/2 hours and it still went dry.  The pork floated to the top and didn't have much liquid to keep it moist.  The peppers were not substantial enough to keep the pork from floating to the top.  The liquid was a bit spicy for my family's taste and we like spicy.  The liquid was also very runny.  Might be improved with a thickening agent like corn starch.

I used low salt teriyaki and it was good but plain.  The final sauce was very watery.  I wouldn't bother to make it again, nothing bad just nothing memorable.

This was the bomb and so easy!  I added more red chili pepper flakes, because I'm addicted to the SPICE, but everything else stayed the same...WONDERFUL!  Even my semi-veggie roommate tried and loved it!

Not too impressed. The peppers were mushy. Cook time was perfect, but the overall flavor was a bit bland. Served with rice and edamame beans, and the kiddos ate those bit not the pork.

I thought the flavor was nice, but after only 6 hours in my slow cooker, the pork was so dried out it was nearly not edible. If I did make this again (probably won't), I may try making it in the oven rather than the slow cooker.

Excellent! But made a few changes due to time. I used a stone deep baker & cooked in microwave, uncovered for 20 minutes then covered for 15 minutes, then 5 more minutes after adding peanut butter....Done in 40 minutes! WONDERFUL!

I only cooked this on low for about six hours and most of the sauce cooked down and the pork came out tough, chewy and WAY overdone. Next time I'd use these same sauce ingredients but just cook it in a frying pan vs. a slow cooker.

I followed the recipe exactly and I enjoyed it however my husband did not like it as much as me. It was a little salty and the pork was a little dry. I'd say less cooking time might make it not as dry. Iloved the peanut taste to it though.

Great recipe and easy-- I added an apple (Granny Smith) as it was cooking.  I, also, added 1/2 cup of red wine with the peanutbutter and I used crunchy peanutbutter...........it was very good - In fact, my husband said " this is a keeper  don't loose this recipe".

I probably used more red pepper flakes and less peanutbutter as I was just eye-balling their measurements and it seemed like a lot of peanutbutter to add.  Really good flavour combination.  The only thing that I would do differently next time is to cut the skin off the red pepper first.  It was totally soft and separated from the skin anyway, more like crushed tomatoes were added. By taking off the skin it would make a nicer sauce.  I think the red pepper really added to the flavour, texture and aroma.  Will definately make again.  Made it this time with frozen boneless, skinless chicken breasts which worked well.  I'll try with the pork next time.

Really good.  I made exactly as stated except added the peppers about 3 hours before done - could probably wait another hour - and omitted the green onion garnish.  It had just a bit of spice.  I will increase the red pepper next time.  Also, the 9 hours was too long. Will cut to 7. Made with shelled edamame and jasmine rice.  A great meal!

Great, easy recipe.  I used 8 bone-in pork chops and cut out the bone.  I didn't increase any of the other ingredients.  And it was good - think 4 would have been skimpy.  My family loved it and I loved how easy it was to prepare!

Made with twice the amount of teriyaki sauce, peanut butter, rice vinegar, and garlic. Used 1.5 tsp red pepper flakes. The meat came out super moist and tender. The sauce was awesome. I didn't care for the dish that much but my husband says it's a keeper and ate 2 helpings! The lime adds a lime-ish flavor which was nice but I didn't think it absolutely necessary.

My husband is not a "fan" of slow cooker meats however this one was a hit - with a few changes.  I used chicken (put in frozen) and I had no teryaki so I used a mix of 1/4 cup soya, 1/4 tsp ginger, splash of red wine and 3 tbsp sugar.   Served with chow mein noodles and stirfry veggies - this makes a ton so yummeh - thx!

This was good, but a bit more dry than I would have liked. Had a great flavor, but I would have cooked it in the peanut butter a bit longer to add more of that to taste, and probably add more hot pepper taste as it is Thai and I exspected a bit more zing. It definately gave the pork a good flavor, and the residuals I used on the rice which tasted great. I also changed a couple of things, I did a pork roast, and I used Green bell peppers instead of red. Also I added water to the slow cooker, about a cup and a half due to me being afraid my pork would dry out more. Slow cookers cook differently so I would suggest checking it. I don't believe mine should have been in for over 7 hours. I did mine exactly to about 8 hours. Good dish for something different.

This wasn't really all that great.  Too much peanut butter, the peppers were mush, the sauce too thick and it needed more "kick".   Wasn't really thai at all.

This was wonderful!  I served this on top of a bed of coconut rice and it was just the right combination for the spicey pork.  I did double the red pepper flakes and added a cup of water and didn't find it salty at all!  It was just to easy.  I will make this again and again.

Wonderful!  I didn't find the peanut butter taste overwhelming at all, as previous reviewers stated.  It was the perfect level of spiciness too.  We served it over Jasmine rice.   I'll definitely make it again.

Way too salty.  The pork absorbed the teriyaki sauce and we couldnt eat it. Maybe a low sodium sauce would work better.  Disapponted.
