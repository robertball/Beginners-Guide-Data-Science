My kids don't usually like meatloaf but this one was a big hit. Great southwest flavor and it's fairly spicy - though not overwhelming. You may want to cut back on the peppers for mixed company. Probably want to chill it before grilling. I gave it about 4 hours in the fridge and that worked well.

This is a great meatloaf, great flavor in the sauce, just the right amount of spicy-ness. Loved it for a summer grilling recipe. If you can't find the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, look in the Mexican section - they're in a small can.
