Great recepie. I love this bread with onion soup or for a ruben sandwitch.
Just be sure to make sure the sauerkraut is very drained. The extra moisture will make your bread machine mix too wet.
ENJOY!

I'd give this recipe ten stars if I could.  The sauerkraut and molasses in the bread makes it so tasty.  I used it to make a reuben sandwich and hubby said it is much more flavorful than the one at our favorite deli, which uses plain rye bread.

To make in oven: bake at 350F for 35-40 minutes.

I was looking for something very rye, and found this one.  Sauerkraut is not much familiar in Japan except at German beer houses, but I have always more loved garnished sauerkraut than sausages.  I failed first time, though. I think I wasn't taking much seriously the advice to have the sauerkraut well drained.  So the second time, I duly followed that tip, and the result was just perfect.  I just love the aroma while baking, and in my kitchen where the bread is now sitting.  Thanks for this inspiring recipe.

I made this by hand and it came out so tasty and moist, not dry or crumbly at all. I might suggest chopping the kraut a bit before adding it so the pieces are shorter and not as stringy in the bread. Delicious on its own or as a sandwhich.

This is some great bread! I love the caraway and sauerkraut flavors. Next time I would probably use even more caraway and try beer instead of the water. I used the dough cycle on my bread machine, then shaped the dough into a loaf, let it rise for 1 hour, then baked at 350 F for 45 minutes. That worked perfectly. Oh, also, I was out of molasses so I used maple syrup. That worked in a pinch but I'd go for molasses next time.

Excellent! Bread is moist with a great deep brown color, already made twice this week. I did take note of others that said not to overdrain sauerkraut. Followed recipe exactly as rec'd breadmaker for Christmas & new to breadmaking. Our favorite recipe so far!You've got to try it - don't let the sauerkraut scare you off, you can't taste it, but it gives the bread the rich flavor - 5 BIG STARS!

I was attracted to LynninHK's photo of this bread, and although mine didn't rise much or produce as beautiful a loaf as her picture, the bread was dense, savory, and delicious. I added a heaping tablespoon of caraway seeds because I love the aroma and 2 teaspoons of unsweetened cocoa powder to make the bread darker. Had a slice with butter straight out of the oven, then used the rest for Reuben Sandwich I, on this website.

Nice rye bread. The bread had a medium density with a light rye flavor. The bread was small and compact from the bread machine. I liked the flavor and texture. Will make again.

I loved this recipe. The bread was so moist inside and had a crispy crust. Next time I make it, I will double the caraway seeds.

This bread is really good...I am now on my second loaf! When I have a lot of time, I make a poolish with 1 cup of water, 1 cup of flour, and 1/2 tsp of yeast and let in bubble for an hour or two before continuing with recipe....be sure to subtract what you use from recipe when continuing. It adds a lot of complexity for any bread recipe. I doubled the recipe to make one Pullman loaf for sandwich bread.  It rises while baking a couple inches above the top, but not over the edge. I chopped sauerkraut fine, dried on paper towels, and used 3 TBS caraway seeds for my double recipe. I coated parchment lined pan with pam and sprinkled with corn meal for extra crunch and slashed the top lengthwise before putting in oven to bake for one hour. Easy pop out from parchment to cool.  I use a thermometer to check doneness, which at 200', finishes with a crunchy crust and moist, but not wet inside. If you did not know sauerkraut was an ingredient, it is not really detectable, kind of like zucchini in zucchini bread for moisture. Makes a good all purpose bread for toast, any sandwich, and super Panini sandwiches. Only a two person household, so I pre slice, freeze first, and then vacuum seal in four packs, and it tastes like fresh. This recipe is definitely a regular in my bread cycle.

Made this bread as directed and followed some suggestions, like the addition of cocoa powder. I did only use the tsp. of caraway seed to test it out first and it was plenty for us. Nice crust and dense texture. It did well in the bread machine, also. We are glad I tried this. Sauerkraut does need to be dried and chopped. Wonderful. Will make this again. Served it up with Amish butter, keilbasa, potatoes and baked apples. yummy!!!!

Yummy! I am really enjoying this bread, very nice and moist (quite dense though). I used less sugar and butter than called for and it still turned out really well and rose nicely. I will definitely be making this again.

Baked in machine - was not done in the middle.  Also was a little too sweet and didn't have much of a rye taste.  Not as moist as I had hoped.  Just OK.  Disappointed after the rave reviews from others.

Loved this!  Don't rinse and drain the sauerkraut unless you want all the flavor to go down the drain; I just squeezed it out a little.  Really nice and hearty, I used it for French dips.  I dipped the tops in sea salt/caraway seeds/garlic powder before baking, and they were outstanding!  I made 9 rolls, they were a little small so next time I'll make 6 rolls.  It's a keeper, thanks for sharing!!

the sauerkraut adds a fantastic twist to an otherwise simple rye bread recipe. i tweaked the instructions a bit - added just 1/2 tsp yeast and let the dough rise for a much longer time -- 8 hours, punching 3x in 2-3 hour intervals -this gives it more flavor and a wonderful chewey texture. baked at 350 for 45 min. it came out with crisp, thick crust but packed and slightly moist inside -- just as i want my bread to be.... who says that bread is best eaten 12 hours after taking it out of the oven? this one won't even last that long in my kitchen...it's that good!

This was a very most bread.  At first I tought i messed it up but it came out wonderful.  I love it.  I made it into a bowl and filled it with the Hot Ham and Swiss Dip from this site.   I did change a couple of things first i add cornbeef to the bread mixture so it is just like a ruben sandwich.  then i used cornbeef in the dip.  Both are very good will be making this again.

I like the fact that I hardly taste the sauerkraut,  but it gives the bread a wonderful texture. This is excellent rye bread.  I used the dough cycle and made two small braids.  I let them rise for about an hour and brushed them with egg substitute right before baking to give them some shine. The smaller loaves bake faster, about 25-30 minutes in the convection oven.   The only change I made was adding a tablespoon of vital gluten.  I think it improves the keeping quality of homemade bread.

I was a little concerned when I removed this bread from my Wellbuilt bread machine and saw how small it was. In other instances a small loaf = doorstop. However once I tasted it, the bread was a bit dense but still acceptable.  If you would like a lighter loaf, I would recommend that if your bread machine allows you to pause the stage between rising & baking, push the pause button and give it some more time. Otherwise you may simply want to switch the bread machine off, let the dough rise for an extra hour or so and then bake it in your oven.

This bread is so good!  It's wonderful for sandwiches.  I didn't get a chance to use it for Reuben sandwiches before the first loaf was all gone!

The sauerkraut really adds moisture and flavor.  I doubled the caraway seed as others have mentioned.  I added 2 teaspoons of vital wheat gluten and the texture was perfect.

I made this on the 1.5 lb loaf white bread cycle with light crust and it was just right!  Thank you for the great recipe!

This bread is fabulous!  I made it in my bread machine, but I used the dough cycle, so that I could make 2 smaller loaves instead of 1 large one.  You can't actually taste the sauerkraut (which "disappears" as the bread bakes), but it gives a great, tangy flavor to this bread.  It was the hit of the church bake sale, and I got lots of requests for the recipe!

I had some leftover sauerkraut so I chose to make this bread with our dinner. IF I were to make it again, I would still let the bread machine do most of the work but would bake in my oven. It didn't seem to get enough "rising" time in the bread machine. (It is a Zojirushi brand) The bread tasted good but Darn--it was heavy and on the small size. I weighed it on my kitchen scale at 1.73lbs! We will still eat the leftovers and anything I have left after that I will freeze to make bread crumbs later. Thanks for submitting.

We love this bread!  The texture is wonderful, the flavor excellent.  We did check the texture of the dough during the first kneading, as recommended by our bread machine's instructions, and needed to add about 1/2 Tablespoon more of bread flour.

My husband loved this bread! I made it right before going out of town so I didn't get any fresh, but the one slice that was left a week later was really good.  I actually had to add a little water and give the bread maker some TLC and help with mixing - maybe I drained the sauerkraut too well.  Great bread!

I have made this twice this week -both times not in a bread maker.  First time the bread was fantastic but I did not bake it long enough so the centre of loaf was a bit chewy but taste was great and the error was mine - 40 minutes would have been a better cooking time then 35 in my oven.  I also took the advise of another writer who said she let it rise 3 times as I had the time. I would not hesitate to only rise twice if I was in more of a hurry. 2nd time I made this recipe, I formed into buns for the sausages we were cooking on the barbecue - again great taste - rose well and enjoyed by all.  We make this a regular bread in our home

I loved this bread! Came out perfect from the bread machine, I got a really good rise. Might try to increase the rye a bit next time! =)

Really good recipe.  I'm not a big fan of sauerkraut, but you can't even taste it in the bread.  Really good and moist.

Great flavor but I'll be working to fine tune it next time I use this recipe.  My loaf rose some but was a little too dense.  When pressed it does not spring back; it creates a gummy spot instead.  Also, I will chop the sauerkraut before use next time.  The flavor is good enough to make it worth the work to find the way to make this work in my machine.

I guess I shouldn't rate this recipe because I could not find rye flour in my store so I substituted whole wheat. I cooked followed the rest of the recipe exactly and still cooked it on the basic bread cycle. Even though I am sure not using rye flour drastically changes the flavor of the bread, what I ended up with was very tasty indeed. I served it with my home made borscht and it was great.

Very tasty - my family was surprised when I told them it was made with sauerkraut.  Left out caraway seeds because we don't like them so ours probably wasn't as pungent as usual.

I made no changes.  Made the dough in bread machine, then removed and finished in oven.  But the dough was very dry, had to add water.  I didn't find it tasty.   Now, it could have been the sauerkraut I used.  I may or may not make this particular recipe again.

I made a few changes that I was pleased with.
I used beer instead of water. 
I didn't rinse and drain the kraut (why?), but did chop it bit. 
 I left out the brown sugar (already had molasses in it). 
I used three cups of rye flour and one cup wheat flour for more of a rye flavor, adding in  3 Tbs. gluten flour.

Made twice.  Did not have any molasses so doubled up on brown sugar.  Second time ran low on rye and white bread flour so topped up with 3/4 cup of all-purpose whole wheat. Both times texture was even and bread was delicious.   Sauerkraut (from a jar) completely assimilated.

This is a wonderful base recipe! MashaAllah   I did make a few changes. First, I used whole organic grains, rye and  winter immer. I used my homemade red sauerkraut and I did not drain the juice. I also pulsed it the Nutriblend to make  it not so stringy. I didn't have molasses so I used Pomegranate syrup. Only used Himalayan salt .
I do not have a bread machine, I use my Bosh stand mixer and let if mix all the ingredients except the yeast for a good 15 to 20 minutes. Then I put the yeast in with the a bit of water and continue to mix for another five minutes before giving it a rest to rise.
My husband thought it was wonderful! And he was born and raised in Germany. MashaAllah

Baked at 400 degrees for 20 mins .

I only increased the ingredient content from 12 to 16 because I have a 2lb bread machine (hand kneading doesn't come out well for me). Never told anybody it contained sauerkraut. They loved it!
Slice and slather with mustard and piled with corned beef or pastrami sided with a dill pickle for a sandwich... yumm.
I'm thinkin" pot roast in the form of rolls next time.
Arrrgh!

I loved this bread.  I think that I will not rinse the sauerkraut next time, I like the flavor and I added more flour.  I don't know if that is because I didn't use a bread machine--but I need extra flour.

Wowee, wow, wow. This bread has great flavour and is incredibly moist. Truth be known, I've never had sauerkraut before, so I was very wary about baking this bread...but the flavour is subtle.   I used Rye flour as directed, but used whole wheat flour instead of white bread flour. Turned out great.   Will be making this again. Thank you!

The sauerkraut keeps it moist but you can't taste it. Even when I buy rye from the store sometimes it tates like cardboard it is hard to get a moist rye but this is very good. Thanks

Baked on 1.5lb loaf with medium setting and it came out ok, but a bit too crispy on the outside. I will try light next time. Didn’t taste sauerkraut at all. Great!

I was looking for recipes to help use up the sauerkraut we have and I found this. I tried it today and I have to say it's AWESOME! I expected it to be a heavier bread like rye normall is, but it turned out so light and delicious! Definitly a keeper!

not a bad recipe. I used whole grain rye flour (which was a mistake) and was a little disappointed that it was so grainy. It was actually better the next day and was  not so coarse

I made this bread while making the Slow Cooker Lancaster County Pork and Sauerkraut from this website.  I was pleasantly surprised by the taste.  You couldn't taste or see the kraut.  My mom wasn't a fan of the taste of caraway seeds but I loved it.  I also added Vital Wheat Gluten to the flour mixture.  Will make it everytime with the pork and sauerkraut recipe.  Thank you! Made this again on New Years Day and we really love this recipe!  We decrease the amount of caraway seeds since our sauerkraut already had the caraway seeds in it.
