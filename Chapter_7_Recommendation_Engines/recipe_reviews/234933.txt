Thanksssss!!!!!! I came from Argentina and polenta is really big , but you make it from an instant packet. Here I only can find it in the latin store and is very expensive. This is a great way of making polenta really chip. I found that using corn meal from the package doesn't come very tasty, I have a blender that I put corn for popcorn and makes it into corn meal.

I mix 1 c. of cornmeal with 1 c.  cold water stir into 3 c. of boiling water. Much easier than stirring in dry cornmeal.

Chef John you've done it again....this was perfect as promised. I was looking for a polenta recipe that didn't call for milk or cream and this was it! Followed the recipe exactly with grits (it's all I had on hand) except that I put in the grits into cold water to avoid lumps. Perfect side for meat!  And the leftovers.....glorious when fried on both sides, then covered with spaghetti sauce, cheese, artichokes, roasted red peppers - whatever you have in your fridge. I might start making polenta just for the leftovers!

Watching the video really helped! This was my first time making polenta, but most certainly won't be the last. Thick, creamy, smooth, warm, cheesy, perfect.

made polenta for the first time, but substituted 2 cups water to milk, turned out really nice. I should say be careful with salt, as the cheese also adds it.

This was really good and quite easy. It cooked up a lot quicker for me, I have a flat top stove so I probably needed to have it set on a lower setting, I'll remember that next time. Still it came out so smooth and tasty! And easier than I imagined, I've never even had polenta until recently, so I'm really glad to have a new option to serve with meals. I also watched the video so that made me feel a lot more confident to try this.

This was great! My picky preteen enjoyed it. He grunted and when done, went to the kitchen to put more in his bowl. I had powdered bouillon that I added to the water and it came out so very flavorful.

I topped this with roasted peppers, asparagus, meatballs and grated Parmesan cheese.

Thank you for the recipe!

Used this recipe, and topped with Italian sausage and red sauce, very good, just like mom's. 
P.S. "fun girl" :D it's Italian all right, but the f-word.

This was delicious. I made easy, cheesy baked polenta for years, but this took a bit more attention on the stove--well worth the time and effort. As suggested, I used low-sodium natural chicken broth and cut the salt in half, but next time I may not even add salt. Was fortunate to have stone-ground polenta meal from Napa Valley' s historic Bale Grist Mill. The fresh shaved cheese was great, but I did not have parm reggiano on hand. Used a blend of parm, asiago, and romano. Made a porcini tomato ragout to top it. Bellissimo.

Never made it before, but tried it with Chef John's Pork al Latte. It was outstanding!  My husband  usually complains about my cooking, but loved this. I made it with leftover turkey stock from Thanksgiving as my liquid. Next time I might try the vegetarian option and just use water.

This is my first time making polenta. Did not grow up eating it, but had it once from the grocery store and was not impressed. But I was looking for an easy way to use some coarse ground corn that I received. I only made 1/2 recipe, but it was done in no time. Only 2 minutes whisking before it thickened, and 10 minutes with the lid on. Added the butter, and some grated parmesan. Stirred, and served. It was very good by itself, but can think of 100 different ways to serve it or add different things to it. Can use as a replacement for pasta, potatoes or rice in so many applications. The rest of it is in the fridge in a round dish, waiting for breakfast! 
Thanks, Chef John!

I sauteed bits of bacon and garlic, then added it to this polenta recipe after the polenta had thickened up. The bacon grease substituted 1 tbsp of the butter. I also added a bay leaf, red pepper flake, and bouillon chicken flavor. Next time I will make with broth. Don't leave out the parm! It really makes it.

I use chicken broth instead of water and nix the salt. It's so simple to make and super delicious...I love to serve this with chicken and sautéed spinach.

Ok I admit that I only made this up until the end of step 2. Then I put sausage in a tomato-type sauce over it. But the polenta came out perfect and I'm sure it would have been great with the butter and parm cheese too. Edit: made this again and it was perfect. Best and easiest polenta recipe ever.

Italians eat polenta as a savory dish, but, you can also use it for traditional, American “corn meal mush” and serve it as a sweet breakfast food, similar to cream of wheat. It is also often cooled in a loaf pan, cut into slices and fried, then, served with syrup.  Delicious both ways!

If you mix 1 c. Cold water with  1 c. corn meal before adding it to the 3 c. Boiling water you will not have much of a problem with lumps. Thanks for the yummy recipe.

I just now used a finer corn meal from

It came out like jello! Still good though, I'm just afraid that 4-1 might not be enough water for the finer grain stuff if that makes any sense.

Not your every day rice and potato's! Great flavor and texture with roasted or grilled meat.  Be sure to taste. The butter, cheese, salt and pepper at the end are very important and not to be missed. Depending on the corn meal you may have to make seasoning adjustments.

I make this about once a month. My 10 year olds love the creamy texture. Sometimes I substitute grated Parmesan Cheese which requires a little more salt to be added to the ingredient list.

Very easy!  I wanted more liquid consistency so I added some chicken stock until it was just what I wanted.  Also, run short of cheese so I sprinkled in a little shredded cheddar.  Very tasty!  My skeptical boyfriend loved it.  Easy enough to make on a weeknight!

Love this version. I did something I have done with polenta over the years. I add three Bay leaves when I add the polenta. I cook through the recipe and pull them out when plating on the serving platter. You need to taste and smell to know why I do this. Once you go Bay you never go back. Enjoy

I used chicken broth instead of water, no added salt as the broth was already seasoned. It was the perfect accompaniment to my Porco com Kiabo (Pork and Okra, a Brazilian dish that is out of this world!)

Simple to make.  Tastes great and good for you when made with good ingredients.  This was my first time making Polenta.  I can think of dozens of recipes where this will be the ideal side dish.

Fantastic!!! I had some amazing polenta at an Italian restaurant, and I’ve been on a quest to make it at home. I can’t stand grits, so I was shocked that I loved polenta. It’s so creamy, smooth and delicious! I made mine using the chicken broth, and it was perfect. I served braised beef short ribs over it, and wowza, just wonderful!! Thank you, Chef John! This and your “airline chicken” are a perfect pairing! Keep sharing with us!

Loved it!  My wife, who is not a fan of polenta, cleaned her plate, too.  So, I guess we did something right.  Since I bought plenty, will be making again.

Wonderful flavor  rich and creamy as promised. Used regular grind cornmeal I had on hand (not a box or mix like Jiffy) and had to add  a bit more broth (bone broth made from Thanksgiving turkey). The finer grind cooked up quicker and required more whisking and stirring.  I halved the recipe (only 2 people), and served it with fried sausage and peppers.  And  we licked the platter clean! Next time I will make full amount. Thank you chef John

Great option to make if you want simple polenta base and not have to use milk or cream. I made this to go with a hearty stew we had left over but you can also just top with your favorite marinara or meat sauce. A little bland if you want to eat it on its own, but I don't make polenta without something to go with it

Very good! Creamy and smooth. I used 6 cups of water and 1.5 cups of polenta. Added sea salt and pepper as it sat and rested. To add some color and a bit of flavor, I added chopped scallions and chopped fresh parsley, as well. Served with shredded short rib.

I followed the recipe but in the last 10 minutes I added a splash of milk.   This add  on made the polenta nice and creamy.  Delicious!  I used the polenta as a bed for my breaded oven cooked pork chops and red beets as a veggie. Great meal and great polenta.

This was so yummy.  The only change I made was to use 4C chicken stock instead of water and I adjusted the salt down to 1/2 tsp because of this.  I served it under Chef John's Short Ribs with Mushrooms and Tomatoes.  What a devine meal!!  How lucky are we to have amazing recipes from such a gifted chef?!!  Thank you again Chef John

Thank you so much for advising 4:1 water ratio instead of the usual 3:1. It made the dish extra creamy and called for less stirring. Great classic recipe.

The only thing I didn't  use was the cheese.   We didn't have any on hand.  Trying to use what is in the house.   To cold here to go out and only one vehicle that starts so can't go shopping for another day.  Until it is warmer out...  that means maybe above 0.   

Just wanted to say best polenta we've had in a long time!  Thank you! 

No photo had to eat in a hurry!

We made it with 2 cups beef broth (leftover from making osso bucco) and 2 cups low sodium chicken broth. It was very tasty.  We will make it again.

I haven't made it yet, but I'm just curious why you say 1 cup of polenta, when what you really mean is 1 cup of cornmeal?  It is not polenta until you cook it.  This is super confusing.  Why?

Made this to go with a slow-braised oxtail recipe.  I took Chef John's advice and went a little light on the 1 c. corn meal, but I tend to get nervous about the batch thickening too much, so I borrowed a little bit of that great liquid from the oxtail pot when the going got a little rough.  The oxtail was very simple:  seared the large pieces, sautéed onions after I removed the beef, then removed the onions and sautéed the carrots and celery-then deglazed with red wine, and added everything back together, put in some bay leaf in cheesecloth, salt, covered w/water, and did the low and slow for 3-4 hours.  Note:  No tomatoes, at all.  Not that that is a bad thing.  So, that was the stuff of the gravy that I added to the polenta.
The polenta itself was cooked in 2c. chicken broth/2c. water, just under 1 c. corn meal, and salt.  I added the butter as the recipe called for.  The color was a little darker and not as lemony, due to the beef broth.  But no worries for me!  My son is a fan of Chef John, and oxtail, and polenta, and this one was a winner, all the way around!

I would have liked a *slightly* thicker polenta but it came out good. The reason I wanted it thicker is that I added sauce to it, which watered it down. So if you add sauces to it that are thinner than the consistency you want the polenta, I would suggest cutting down the water to a 3.5:1 ratio or maybe even 3:1.

Came out really good.  I did have to add about another cup of water, half cup at a time.  Really nice change from pasta or rice.

Super easy. Easy whisk pour in at rolling boil. It is a 4-1 ratio. If you say it's bland then use 3-1, your choice of stock-cream. Or don't be scared to salt your water. You want it heavy drip thick or when it just stops sticking to the side of the pan when you stir it.

Excellent.  Family made faces and were comparing the dish to "icky" grits until they tasted it. Everyone loved this polenta.

This was very easy to make!  I bought organic corn meal and this turned out perfect!  I would recommend making it with water. I made it with chicken broth and it was a little too salty.

Very easy to make and seasoned it according to my taste.  I grew up on Southern style grits.  The basic of cooking the Italian polenta wasn't that different.  The only difference is that this was made with yellow cornmeal rather than hominy corn grits.  Thank you for the recipe.

Easy, delicious! I used half milk and half water to boil because I wanted extra creamy. Unfortunately  I didn’t “slowly” pour in the cornmeal, and experienced the lumpy consequences, but easily remedied with my immersion blender. Great basic recipe!

It was delicious!  I used freshly ground corn made on an old fashioned grist mill.  The only thing, it took a lot longer than 30 minutes for it to thicken up to where it needed to be.  Closer to an hour.

Came out perfectly. Topped it with braised short ribs. Relish. Pressed leftovers into a pie plate and into the frig for polenta points the next day. Great snack served cold.

I am so happy I found this recipe!! i wanted to recreate the polenta and peperonata my dad used to make when I was younger. The instructions (and video) were easy to follow and I had fun making it. It just took some time , but all good food takes time.  I will definitely be making this again, but next time with a little less cheese. It had a distinct cheese flavor and, while it tasted good, I would prefer it to taste more corn-y. Side note, I used yellow stone ground grits because it was all I could find at my local grocery stores unless I wanted tubed polenta.

Brilliant! And very forgiving! The first time that I made it, I was alone and cooling for two very picky eaters. Forgot to use chicken broth so I added some bouillon powder. Didn't have fresh butter so I used some frozen herb butter from last summer. Didn't have parmesan cheese so I grated up some rather dessicated Emmenthal. served it with some sauteed chicken and asparagus - at least that was fresh! One satisfied and two full kids later, empty dish and asking for when we can make it again!

Chef John did it again, this is perfect, I used chicken broth too, I agree it gives just the right taste. It also sets up well so I can put the leftovers in a flat pan so I can cut it up for another meal and either fry them in a bit of butter, the best, or steam it if I need to have it lighter. So good my husband asks for it!

This recipe was great and the video was extremely helpful.  I used chicken broth instead of water and triple cheddar instead of the Italian cheeses.  The only thing I would change is maybe do half broth / half water or try a lower sodium broth because the salt was... a bit much (and that's coming from someone who LOVES salt!)  This is the perfect comfort food and gluten free to boot.  I will probably be making this all week for myself.. LOL.

This polenta was so delicious that we couldn't stop eating it. I'll be making this a lot now that I know it's much easier than I thought and goes well with so many other dishes.

You teach cooking like I teach metal working.  Humor makes learning easier and less stressful. So happy to not rely on the corn log. Thank you

Delicious! I added some hot paprika and powdered garlic. I also used white instant grits so it took 5 minutes to cook instead of 30.

Came out perfect. My timing was off with the rest of the meal, and this ended up sitting longer than expected, but it was still great. Got lots of compliments.

First time review here, this recipe was awesome! I did have water, and half milk. It turned out amazing :-) I also added a little more cheese and was happy with how cheesy it was. Next time, I plan to add a can of corn.

Never made polenta before, but can't wait to try it for a dinner party coming up. Can I double the recipe, or should I make this in batches, or ahead of time?? Thanks!

What makes this recipe great is that polenta is obviously more than just ingredients. This recipe teaches great technique on how to execute those ingredients and make the perfect polenta. This should be a staple in any home cook's repertoire!

Very easy to make and delicious! The longer you let the polenta rest, it will firm up. Perfect for a quick weeknight meal or as a side dish. I topped mine with sauteed zucchini and a little marinara.

Best decision I've made was to watch the video for this recipe. It was simple and delicious. My only adaptation was the chicken broth, I used 1 can as 1 of the water cups and BOOM! got the best flavor out of my polenta without any effort. The butter coming in during the low heat boil (last 15min for me) worked great, what a touch.

My first time making polenta and it turned out wonderful!  I can't wait to use the leftover polenta in the morning as a fried, sliced version with eggs or fruit.  I will make this again and again.

Fabulous!  Love Chef John, his videos,  easy ingredients make it so easy to cook and try new stuff.   Hubby and son loved it.  I made it with 2 cups of chicken broth and 2 c of water, everything else the same.  Yum!

Awesome recipe! Very flexible as well, I used my enameled cast iron pot so it cooked quite fast (20 min) Can't wait to start coming up w/more ways to make it my own. Thanks Chef John!, PattiD
