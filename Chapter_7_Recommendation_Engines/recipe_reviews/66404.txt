I have been making Pot Roast in the pressure cooker for some time now.  However, I just use pepper, season salt, and onion powder to season the meat after browning.  I also use beef broth only, no water and add a quartered onion or two, and some worcester sauce and gravy master to the broth.  Then I cook for 30 minutes after pressurizing.  Then I add carrots and potatoes and cook for additional 15 minutes. We like lots of gravy, so sometimes I add another can of beef broth depending how much liquid is in the pot.  Everything comes out perfect every time.  It takes a little longer waiting for the pressure cooker to pressurize twice, but the veggies come out perfect as well as the meat. I make a roux to mix with the gravy so it is nice and thick!  This is my favorite meal!

I love to cook. This recipe assembles packets. I followed the recipe to the letter. The problem with this recipe is resting on to much from packets for seasoning. Which contains to much salt. As for the cooking method, it was right on the mark. Meat was tender. 
I would go 2 cups water, one Goya bouillon cube. two onions, a large carrot, some pepper and any other veggies you have on hand. Thanks for your time and the right to critique your recipe.

Incredible! Very tasty, we really loved this one, and so easy to prepare. I just invested in a whole new Pressure cooker set and this worked beautifully. I made some slight changes that I think really improves the flavor. I cut most of the fat off the roast first. Then I mixed the only the Italian & Ranch dressings together, then I used only half of the mixture and rubbed them into the raw Chuck roast & let it sit all day refrigerated. The meat really absorbs the flavors this way. Then I browned the meat as described, and then spread the rest of the dry dressings & the brown gravy mix over the meat & added the broth and onions as called for. Mine was a 4.5 lb roast, I pressure cooked on high pressure 55 minutes, and used the natural release method. I removed the meat, defatted the juice & served! Perfect!

GREAT RECIPE!  The only thing I did differently was to add potatoes and carrots.  (I wouldn't recommend adding carrots...they were a little mushy, but the potatoes were perfect!)  A wonderful meal..everyone enjoyed!

Two yums up!  I didn't really taste the dressing mixes, just beef.  And moist tender beef it was.  I may use a can of French Onion soup next time instead of the broth because I had more liquid than needed and it might make the gravy a little thicker and add interesting flavor (hmmm, it might not be enough liquid for the pressure cooker).

Details in case there are other folks hesitant to use a pressure cooker:  I was nervous to use a pressure cooker, not because of the old stories of peril (or the previous reviewers need to repaint the ceiling, LOL), but because it was a method I'm not familiar with.  My chuck was 2 1/2 lbs., too large to brown in my 4 qt. cooker so I dredged it in flour and browned it in a skillet first.  Other than the addition of 6 medium whole red potatoes (all that would fit), I followed the ingredient list.  Because it was so full, it took a long time for the cooker to reach pressure and I had to keep the knob higher than expected (8-9 on an electric pressure cooker) to maintain pressure.  The potatoes were creamy and tender, though some might consider them overdone.

Now I'm disappointed there aren't more pressure cooker recipes here!

Ok, I thought the Dry Ranch and Italian packets seems really odd, but I made it because of the ratings!  This was very flavorful-I added a bit of Gravy Master Seasoning and Browning sauce at the end when I thicked sauce because I prefer a "browner, more beefy flavor".  I'm glad I did not trim fat, as the sauce was not greasy but I'm sure it added flavor.  I also added one large CARROT which is mashed in to the sauce at end for a bit of sweetness.  Served w/mashed potatoes and green beans.  Very nice supper!  Thanks.

My family and I loved this!  The meat was sooo moist. Next time will adjust the seasonings, because it was a little too salty, but still excellent!

This is by far the best roast I've EVER had.  I don't have a pressure cooker so I used my slow cooker and turned out great.  It made lots of juice and the meat was so tender and moist.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

Excellent recipe!  I donâ€™t have a pressure cooker so I cooked it in the oven at 350 for an hour and a half.  I also added potatoes, carrots, yams & mushrooms.  Turned out great.  My boyfriend raved about how good it was.  I passed the recipe on to a coworker, she went home that night & made it, after her family ate they called & thanked me for the fabulous recipe.  Her husband told me to keep sending the great recipes.

I have been cooking this recipe (and variations of it) for over a year now and it is by far the best pot roast I've ever had. I do think the original recipe is salty (but make it this way the first time- it's still delicious and everyone has different salt sensitivity) so I usually leave out the Italian dressing and just use the ranch. Also, instead of beef broth, I use a tablespoon of beef boullion and about a cup of red wine. I think the wine cuts some of the salt and adds some depth. And if you have a few fresh tomatoes to use up, chop them up and throw them in. Honestly, I haven't figured out a way to mess this recipe up and it is the one thing that is constantly requested for big family dinners. Love, love, love it!

I have tried this recipe and by itself I would give it 3 stars because the combination of packets makes it too salty. It inspired me to try a revised version though so I used only onion soup mix, worcestershire sauce, garlic powder and onion powder and beef broth (14 ounces). Put the worcestershire sauce and pressed garlic cloves on the roast with onion powder and garlic powder. Sprinkle half of the packet of onion soup on both sides and rub in. Brown the beef in pan sprayed with Pam. If you use oil it will be too greasy because of the natural fat in the beef. Put in pressure cooker after browned with chopped onions, the rest of the onion soup and the can of beef broth. Cook according to the instructions below for 30 minutes. De-pressurize and open the pot, add the chopped vegetables (potatoes, celery and carrots and red onions) add a little water if it looks really low and pressurize again and cook for 15 minutes. I used my Tefal Clipso Control Pressure Cooker with the timer that I picked up while living in Asia and 45 minutes later by the timer we were eating the best meal ever!

Being a rookie I tried this out because I had just bought a pressure cooker. It was easy, quick and the best pot roast I have ever eaten. 
My wife, who is a very good cook was even jealous! 
After the roast was finished I took peeled potatoes, sliced onions and two small bags of baby carrots and put them in the remaining liquid and cooked them 15 minutes. They turned out awesome, perhaps a tad soft of me but very good. 
After I removed the vegetables I used corn starch as needed to make a very good gravy.
For being inexperienced as I am this turned out very well.

I thought the ranch and Italian seasonings were a bit overpowering. I will try 1/2 a package or less and maybe omit the ranch. I thickened the gravy and added some kitchen bouquet for color. I actually baked it at 350 for 3 hours and added cubed potatoes and carrots for a complete meal.  Iâ€™m sure you could do the same in the pressure cooker.  Family loved it, I will make it again.

I added celery along with the onion.  Since some reviewers indicated it could be salty, I turned off the pressure cooker at about 20 minutes, added 6 potatoes and some small carrots to absorb the salt.  Reset the pressure cooker for another 20 minutes.  It was perfect.  The potatoes soaked up the extra salt.   My husband said it was the best pot roast I ever made.  Thank you for this recipe.

Very impressed!  I cooked the roast (2.5lb largest store had) for 40 min and then following another's advice, cooled 5 min, released pressure & added 6 peeled/cubed potatoes & baby carrots. Brought back up to pressure (high) for 15 min, cooled 5 min & released pressure again.  Baby carrots were a bit soft, potatoes were perfect and the meat was so tender and delicious! I used a baster to take all of the cooking liquid out and used cornstarch to thicken for gravy. Will make this often!!   NOTE: common packet sizes are ranch = .4oz, italian = .7oz

Incredible !!  I was certain that no one could cook a pot roast in 45 minutes.  Boy was I wrong.  45 minutes and it was perfect.  Tender and tasty.Strange recipe.  Who ever thought of throwing a bunch of dry mixs on top of a hunk of meat and blasting it in the pressure cooker for only 45 minutes.  It was inexpensive, EASY and great tasting.  I'll just have to remember not to remove the weighted valve off the top of the cooker before the pressure is released.  I will make this again next week-end while I am re-painting the kitchen ceiling.  Definitely a 5 star with a bullet.

This was such an amazing and delicious dish! I've made roasts before - even in the pressure cooker - but this was the favorite of them all. My brother in law made it the week before and he told me he got it from here so I thought I'd give it a try for a dinner party I was having. I stuck with the recipe and only made a few small changes. I did use everything low sodium. I used half of the seasonings to dry rub and marinate the roast for 2 hours in the fridge before browning it. To the ingredients I added 1 cup of Merlot wine and added a few chopped carrots and some fresh chopped mushroom. It came out perfect. I added a little flour to the gravy to thicken it up before serving. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes. We ate it all! Definitely making this again, especially for guests. Thanks for recipe!

LOVED THIS!!!  Made just as directed but added a can of diced tomatoes, a tbs celery seed and did half beef broth/half red wine. Took advice of others and put some corn starch  into the pan after removing the roast for gravy (love my immersion blender!).  Served with buttered noodles. Grandma, husband and two college age sons ate every last scrap of a 3.5 lb roast! I am not join to change a thing from the above and will definitely make again. This was my first experience using my pressure cooker for a pot roast as I have always used it only for canning. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I have a new completely sealed pressure cooker (Kuhn brand).  It doesn't have a rocker or a whistle unless you've gone over pressure and the blowoff valve opens.  With this type of pressure cooker, 45 minutes was way too long.  I'm going to reduce the time to 24 minutes next time I make this and see if that helps.

This is a SIMPLE recipe and tastes delicious! I used 1/2 Tablespoon of onion powder instead of real onions because onions get soggy in the pressure cooker. I cooked the roast on the second ring for thirty minutes, did the quick release method (cold water) and then added carrots and quartered roast potatoes. Then I brought it to the second ring again and cooked for 15 minutes. Then used the quick release method again. SIMPLE and DELICIOUS!

I have made and eaten many good pot roast in the past but this is the best I have ever had. I added garlic to the onions and I used beef stock. After cooking for 50 minutes I cooled the cooker and added potatos and carrots and cooked another 15 minutes. The dish was so rich it was to die for.

OK this was my 1st time ever using a pressure cooker. I really didn't think it could cook a pot roast in 45 minutes.. Since mine was 4lbs I cooked it for 1 hour. Now I did do some changes to the recipe, I rubbed in Lipton Soup & the Spicy Ranch dressing only used half a pack of both didn't want it to be too salty. I also added red wine to the broth added little more than liquid than this recipe called for but still was no more than 1/3 of the pressure cooker...OMG this turned out so good. I added the potatoes and the carrots last 15 minutes of cooking. The veggies came out perfect.. I served this with dinner rolls and Brussel Sprouts in a butter chicken broth sauce topped with crumbled bacon.. Since I did this on the fly this afternoon went to the market (Aldi) bought my Roast. I am going to marinate it overnight  before browning & cooking it in the pressure cooker

Awesome recipe, I added 1/2 can water before closing the pot and a half lb of mushrooms, and the gravy came out absolutely AMAZING!! Also, my pot roast was frozen, so I added 20 min to the cook time and simmered for 15 min with the pot open... Totally amazing! :) Thanks!

So easy, and good enough for company.  Everyone loved it.  Our priest (who was over for dinner) even asked for the recipe.   I browned the onion as well as the roast.  I also added two packets Italian and Ranch mix, since my packets were 0.7 oz., and used water because I didn't have any beef broth on  hand.  But, I forgot to add extra water, so the gravy turned out salty but still good.  I'll use water next time too, since it was very flavorful and I'm afraid the broth would increase the saltiness again.  Check your pressure cooker's cook time.  I had to cook a 4 lb. roast on high for 60 minutes.

This was my first time using a pressure cooker and after making this recipe I will retire my crock pot.  The meat was so flavorful and perfectly cooked.  I used corn starch to make gravy with the juices and this just made an amazing meal even better.

The first time I tried this recipe it turned out absolutely delicious.  Nice an moist and the gravy it made was wonderful.  A bit salty but that can be adjusted by using low sodium products.  I tried it again a second time and it was tough.  I did cook it at a lower heat and I am not sure if it was the same cut of meat I had the first time.  Definitely a keeper.  My husband is a hunter and I plan on trying this with venison.

Scared to use a pressure cooker but this turned out perfect! I added red skin potatoes & carrots ontop of the meat along with 3 cups beef broth & 1 cup red wine. I didn't use the dry ranch dressing, added 1/2 tablespoon onion salt.   Cooked for 50 minutes on high heat. Glad I added the 4 cups liquid because it was getting close to drying up!! I cooked a 3 1/2 pound roast.

This recipe is the first thing I decided to make in my new pressure cooker and boy was it a success!!  So flavorful and tender!  I made it exactly as instructed and the only changes I made for the next time were to double the beef broth, add a little garlic, and carrots.  YUM!!!

My husband and I decided to try the pressure cooker we received for Christmas, it was our first time to use a pressure cooker, WOW the roast came out amazing! We added carrots and potatoes and a little red wine, it's just wonderful. The fact that I can make this after work, with the help of the pressure cooker, puts it over the top!

Terrible! If I could give it a NO STAR I would.  The meat was boiled!   Find another recipe, this one is the pits.  Yes, I followed the recipe as directed.  Still in a state of shock, all that money spent on the meat just wasted.

so good!  based on reviews, i used 1/2 of each packet of italian/ranch dressings, the full gravy packet (i used mushroom) and i also added celery and about 1 cup red wine.  i cooked it for 35 minutes, then let the steam out and added carrots for the last 15 minute of cooking.  
amazing.  will definitely make again!  so much faster than cooking it in the dutch oven/slow cooker.  thanks for sharing the recipe!

I've made this over and over and it never dissapoints. I always use a chuck roast and make sure to trim all the fat off of it so the gravy isn't greasy. Easy and delicious.

This was so delicious! I have made this recipe with the pressure cooker and crock pot and both times it was so tender and yummy! I followed others suggestions of using low sodium broth, and think it helped give it the right amount of taste. It is such an easy recipe to follow for beginner cooks like me! I would definately make it again!

This is nearly the same as the recipe I religiously use in the crockpot!  The only exception is I don't use any oil.  Rub the roast with the three packets mixed and add rest to the crockpot.  To reduce the saltiness I use 2 cups of water in place of the broth and rump roast or bottom round instead of chuck (less fat).   It's a family favorite and has been for years.  I serve with egg noodles or dumplings.  Delicious and easy.  I can make it on the way out the door in the morning.

It was really good! I used Beef Broth, pkg dry onion soup,pkg beef gravy, yummy. I also follow the one sug. to cook on pressure for 30 min. and then add the carrots and potatoes back up to  pressure for another 15 min.The veg. were perfect that way:)Also thickened with corn starch,gravy was  just mouth watering.

Great recipe!  Did not have Italian Seasoning, used Onion soup mix instead.  Added a can of gravy, plus the broth.  The Whole family loved it.  I cut up and threw 
sauce and beef in with cooked egg noodles.  Delish!!!  Thanks.

Easy and the meat was tenderl but must say it was too salty due to the packaged seasonings. Easy isn't always the healthiest way to go. :(

Made this last night for dinner. Amazingly good!!! Even my children raved on how good it was. Based on others' reviews, I did make one adjustment to the recipe...I left out the Italian seasoning packet; used only the Ranch and brown gravy packets. Delish!!! I love to cook using my pressure cooker...the meat is always so tender. Yet, until last night, I had never made a beef roast in it.  Well, using a pressure cooker is now my new favorite way to make a roast and this is my new favorite roast recipe. Will definitely make again!!

This was wonderful. The only thing I did slightly different was add veggies.After about 40 minutes in the pressure cooker I took it off the heat, removed the meat. Added peeled red potato halves, 1 celery stick sliced, and carrots. Along with 1 1/2 cups additional beef broth.Placed the meat back on top brought pressure back up, reduced heat to low/med and cooked 30mins. I made gravy with the remaining juices.

This roast was awesome... My mom bought me a pressure cooker because I work full time and have 6 kids and I have never used other than making artichokes because I've heard horror stories about the lids blowing off, etc... I tried it last night with this recipe and my whole family loved it!!!

This recipe was great!!!! I read the other reviews on it being too salty. I didn't find that to be the case. The only size dry Italian salad dressing mix I could find was 0.6 oz so that's all I put in there. Which might have helped it not be too salty. This was so good, it fell apart like it had been in the slow cooker all day. Yummy!

I loved this easy roast. I mixed the packets together and "dredged" the raw roast in my fake flour mixture of the packet ingredients. I heated my oil and seared off the meat on all sides. I then added the chopped onion and beef broth, I also added 1/2 cup of red wine (I used Marsala) and 1/2 cup of V8. I cooked it as normal in the pressure cooker and it was spectacular. I then pulsed all of the dripping in my blender and put it on the stove with a teaspoon and a half of cornstarch to thicken. This made an excellent gravy. No extra salt needed. It wasn't too salty, but for those with salt issues, pick up the reduced sodium packets, its too good to pass up.

Very easy and awesome taste.  I made this for our church's "host the homeless" evening.  I made two roasts - the first exactly to the directions.  The second I took another suggestion and used the spices as a rub and put in the fridge while the other cooked.   Both were incredible.  The rub was more intense in flavor and thicker in juice (but then we also cooked it higher because we were running late).

It is an wonderful recipe that now has my fellow church members thinking I'm an incredible cook!

Thank you for sharing it!

This was the best Pot Roast I've ever made, but I did it in my slow cooker.  I also used Rita's idea of rubbing half the italian & ranch dressing mixes on the meat. I left it refrigerated overnight. The next morning I seared the meat & put it in the slow cooker with two sliced onions. I couldn't find brown gravy mix, so used mushroom gravy & the beef broth. It cooked for 10 hours and my husband called it "heaven".

I was being a little 'snobby' in regards to the ingredients in this recipe and almost didn't try it: I didn't think the "pre-packaged" seasonings could possibly make a 5 star recipe. But I was looking for something really easy to slow cook with the chuck roast I had bought at a great price, and wanted to try something new. The only thing I changed was the cooking method. I browned my roast on all sides and then put all in my slow cooker for 5 hours on high. Wow, great flavored broth! Will make this again!

I didn't do this in a pressure cooker but in a slow cooker instead and it was amazing! The ingredients made it so flavorful and tender. And it's very easy to throw together.

Very good recipe, I followed the recipe to the letter only substituting Knorr Pfeffer sauce mix for the dry gravy mix.  Not owning a pressure I cooked this in the oven @350 and even left in a little longer - it still was very moist.  I added baby carrots, red potatoes and mushrooms the onions to round out the meal.  I also added two celery stalks to absorb the salt, which must have worked since it didn't seem salty at all!  My DH raved about the gravy (which I didn't even have to thicken)and my picky six year old asked for seconds.  My kitties even loved it >^..^

I absolutely love pot roast and have tried for years to make mine come out decent. They have always turned out tasteless and dry. I ran across this recipe one day and decided to try it.  It was amazing!  I couldn't believe how good it was.  This is the one I will use from now on.  And using the pressure cooker?  What a time saver.  No more waiting for hours for it to cook. Thank you so much.

I'm very sorry, but my family did not like this recipe at all.  Cooking the potroast for 45 minutes seemed to be too long as the meat was very dry.  In addition, the seasonings seem to give the meat a sour taste, even though I cut them in half as some reviews had suggested.  Perhaps it was the ranch dressing that gave it that flavor.  I could see using the pressure cooker method with french onion soup and gravy mix and cooking it for a shorter time.

So delicious, and very easy! I changed it by making some broth using beef cubes instead of the canned. It still tasted great, although I think the bullion made it a bit saltier than it might have been otherwise. My husband and I were both devouring the tender meat, we couldn't believe it only took 45 minutes to make! There was a lot of juice and it wasn't thin, so we were able to spoon it over like gravy without any extra effort. YUM! 

We're going to have the leftovers for lunch today. This will become a weekly dish, I'm sure!

Used this recipe with my power pressure cooker I bought from an infomercial.  This recipe had fewer ingredients than the one that came with the pressure cooker.  It was really good... flawless.  The whole family loved it.  Thank you so much for sharing!!!!

I made this last night for supper.  It was very good but somewhat salty - and for me, that's saying something because I'm a salt addict!  I made it as close to the recipe as I could but I didn't have brown gravy mix so I left it out.  The meat was very tender and after it was done I took the meat out and added about 4 carrots cut into large chunks and cooked them till done then thickened the gravy.  I served this with the carrots as the vegetable, some mashed potatoes and the meat.  It was very good.  Don't know what can be done to reduce the salt because the mixes add a lot of salt - that's why I try to avoid mixes like this.  Next time I'll try to find at least a salt free dressing mix.  I will make this again with modifications.  Thanks for a great recipe I can work with!

Very, very good but I didnt use a full packet of dry Italian dressing mix (I make my own dry Italian dressing mix and used a tablespoon or two) and skipped the packet of gravy mix.  I dont like food very salty so this made it perfect and it still had tons of flavor. Pot roast made in the pressure cooker is seriously the best!

MamaShea this is outstanding.  Made it to the letter.  The meat (shoulder roast) was fall apart tender and the gravy was perfect.  I did add carrots and potatoes after 35 min and after reaching steam, cooked another 10 min.  Thanks for sharing.  This will remain number 1 on my pressure cooker recipes.

I used flour instead of the gravy mix. I also roasted some veggies to serve with the roast!! This is a simple and comforting meal for the cooler weather in the upper midwest!

This exceeded our expectations. My father said it was "the best roast he ever had!". So tender for 45 minutes! The only think I did outside the recipe is to use 2 gravy packets instead of one. We made gravy with the drippings that was to die for! Thanks for sharing this recipe and now I love my pressure cooker, can't wait to try more things in it.

Followed this recipe verbatim and it turned out "Ok." Between the gravy mix and the dressing mix, that's a lot of sodium. I'll do this one again, eliminating one, the other, or both.

This is an excellent recipe,  The personal touches I gave were: using reduced sodium beef broth & reduced sodium brown gravy mix.  I also followed one of the reviewers & cooked meat for 30 min, added 3 lg potato & 6 lg carrots & cooked for an add'l 15 min.  I thickeed the gravy w/ a small amount of milk/flour mixture.  It was a great tasty dinner that'll I will surely make again.

I made this in the crockpot instead of the pressure cooker,and it was great.  I used red wine for the liquid and added some beef base to get a beefier flavor.  I put in whole cremini mushrooms and added some chopped red bell pepper. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was delicious.  I added only a tiny bit of extra salt, and it was not too salty.  Hubby kept saying how good it was.  I did use a rump roast instead of chuck - less fatty and it was on sale.

The only change I made was to use non-fat, low sodium beef broth.  The roast came out perfectly.  It's the first time I've made pot roast in my pressure cooker and I will be making this again.

First tried the recipe, following it to the letter. Just tried it again this evening with a two adjustments:  First added 1C of Austrailian Shiraz (any red wine will do). Second:  Added whole, small red potatoes on top of the meat. cooked for 60 minutes under pressure.  Worked great!!

This recipie is definately one that I will be making til the end of time. I did make some adjustments though. I eyeballed about 2 cups of a cabernet sauvignon to the rest of the braising ingredients. Because of all the sodium in the seasonings, I also added about 1 to 1 1/2 cups of water. The wine made it 5 star! If you live near a Trader Joe's, they have a SUPER cheap but VERY tasty C.S. called Charles Shaw or better known as "2 buck chuck!" Enjoy! 
PS: Turn the heat off about 8 minutes before the timer goes off. TRUST ME!

This came out pretty good. I didnt use any thickeners to make the gravy, I just used my stick-blender to puree the onions into the juices and that worked fine. I will definately make this again.

This pot roast was very good in the pressure cooker and as written.  I made the recipe a second time, added carrots and potatoes, and threw it into a slow cooker and it was awesome.  No leftovers that night!

This recipe was great...I added an extra can of beef broth, a few potatoes, and a good handful or two of baby carrots...the fiance had just gotten back from a camping trip and said it was the best thing he's ever eaten!

I did this in my crockpot and it was excellent. I added some red wine in place of half the beef broth and thickened the suace with some cornstarch. I also added a few tbl. of creme freche at the end. Don't salt the roast before browning coz the mixes are really salty. Iv'e made this a few times and given the recipe to many friends and everyone loves it.

Great recipe! I coated the roast with soy sauce for a few seconds (thank-you Lorna Sass) to save having to brown the roast before placing the roast in the pressure cooker.  I used the 45 minute cooking time at pressure but then I let the pressure drop naturally (about 12 minutes) before opening the cooker.  I removed the roast and wrapped it in foil for few minutes.   I pureed the veggies with a small amount of the cooking liquid for gravy.  I only sliced as much as needed the first night and the rest made great sandwiches for the week.  This recipe is a keeper.

This pot roast was delicious!  I made it according to the recipe with no changes. The prep was quick and easy, and then I played with my son while keeping an eye on the pressure cooker. I didn't think it was possible to cook a pot roast in just 45 minutes, but the meat was tender and my 20 month old son, husband and I loved it!  I now have a new standby for an easy meal! Thanks for the great recipe!

delicious!  I don't have a pressure cooker, so I eliminated step one and threw the meat (still frozen) into the slow cooker on low for 10 hours with all the ingredients plus a cup of water.  At the end of cooking, the sauce was a little thin so I thickened it up with some cornstarch and voila!  Dinner was served...and it was delicious at that!  Thanks for the recipe!

Superb! My twist... I cook this meal in 16 minutes in the pressure cooker. First, I ask the butcher to slice the roast into 3/4 inch steaks. Then at home further cut the steaks into chunks about 1-2 inches. I usually add an onion, small bag of baby carrots and some potatoes. Everything comes out moist and tender. So tasty!  My point is...  why waste an hour, plus all the energy, to cook a full 2 lb roast in the pressure cooker? Divide and conquer! Some guests have told me this is the best pot roast meal they have ever had. We owe it all to Mamashea! Thanks!

This was such a wonderful recipe. I just put my pot roast on medium for 45 minutes rather than starting on high because with an electric stove it takes a lot longer to get the heat down. This recipe is a five star and made pot roast very moist with great flavors.

I followed the directions exactly and ended up with a tough, burnt on the bottom pot roast. I consider myself a seasoned cook and have made tons of pot roasts in my life but wanted to try one in the pressure cooker.

Fabulous; really, really fabulous. That was my husband's review. And I know his mom made the best pot roast ever - he said it was better than hers, which was his childhood favorite. Why? I've been cooking for over 30 years and using the pressure cooker keeps the roast much more moist than a three hour oven stint will. I cut back the dressing mixes to just a teaspoon each, to limit the salt, but kept the full package of brown gravy. I rubbed the roast in the dry mix and put it in the fridge for three hours (but probably not necessary for success.) I then browned the 3-lb roast in a separate dutch oven, a little bit burnt to bring out the meat flavor - then transferred it to the pressure cooker. I then deglazed the seared juices in the dutch oven (really just a big deep wide pot) and when the full 60 minutes of high on the pressure cooker was up, and the roast rested 10 minutes, I added the pressure cooker juices to the dutch oven and made the gravy there on the stovetop, thickening it with some cornstarch dissolved in water. Then added the roast to the finished, hot gravy. The added dry salad dressing spices added a richness to the flavor and made for a great gravy. Want to impress someone with your cooking skills? I think this one is a fool-proof winner that everyone will love. Five stars for sure.

Excellent....followed recipe exactly.  Resulting gravy in pot was perfect and needed no thickening.  Made carrots and scalloped potatoes on the side with a great sald.  Perfect meal.

4th time I've used this recipr and 4th time a big hit.  3 of the 4 times I used Italian dressing from the bottle and still real tasty but not over whelming. The texture (tender) and juciness (not dry) is enjoyed but picky folks (my daughter) too. i If your a "how does this work" type person, I suggest looking up the science behind pressurecooking and how different it cooks and flavors enter into the food. Of course, you modify with your other favorite spices like fresh garlic peices pushed into the roast.

I gave this 3 stars because this has such a high rating I'm wondering if I made a serious error. I don't believe I did, but in any case our meal was ruined. I'm never cooking meat in the pressure cooker again.

Love this recipe.  Easy, fast and taste wonderful. I don't care much for beef but this has alot of flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly and just added red potatoes at the end for an additional 10 minutes.  I'll be making this often.

Yumsssss! This was the first time I ever used a pressure cooker. I used low sodium beef broth and gravy mix and I didn't think it was too salty. I also used a little Cab as well since I had some on hand. The gravy was SO GOOD. Served with mashed potatoes and crusty bread. Can't wait to make again and thanks a million for this one!

The meat turned out great, nice and tender and in such short time! This is a truly easy recipe. I can't decide if I liked the flavor combo of ranch and italian, but I am used to a simpler flavor with my roast. I also added carrots, potatoes and onion and the result was wonderful. I will definately try this again.

Very good recipe for an inexpensive cut of meat.  I did mine in the crock pot - let it cook for 8 hours. Leftovers made great hot roast beef sandwiches. This one's a keeper!

I thought this was really good. I usually just make pot roast with the little flavor packet and bag, and wanted to try something different. This turned out about the same to me; It was good but no better than the easier version, so I will probably just stick to that. But it was good.

I have had my pressure cooker under the cupboard for a long time. It will be used much more now. This was a wonderful recipe. My 9 year old grandaughter raved about it to her Mom and my husband loved it too. I agree it was salty, but I used the beef cube with water for broth. Will definately make it again it was fabulous. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipes is fantastic.  The best pot roast recipes I've found.  I used a slow cooker instead of a crock pot and cooked it on low for about 6 hours.  It was perfect.  It is high in sodium, but you are concerned about sodium intake you can find low sodium substitutes in most health food stores.

I made this for dinner last night - it was SO GOOD! I followed another reviewer's tip and rubbed half of the seasoning mix on the roast a few hours before actually cooking it. I did not find it to be salty at all and the gravey was perfect without adding flour or cornstarch (I added some mushrooms to the gravey). This was my first time using a pressure cooker - I don't think I'll ever make my roasts in the oven again! Oh, one unexpected surprise, my roast was almost half the size that it went in after it was done cooking. No leftovers - this recipe is a keeper.

Tried this on the week-end with no changes and was very pleased.  Meat was tender and the gravy was great.  Will be using this recipe again.

I made this recipe, and the meat was very good, but the gravy, using the packets, was too salty.  I called all the companies and asked for lower sodium, and they said they would pass it on.  If anyone can give me advice on lowering the sodium while still using the packets, it would be appreciated.  Also, I added the onions when I browned the roast, and I added two large potatoes to the pot.  They turned out perfect.  Must be large or they will fall apart.

Very good!  I had been afraid to try a roast in the pressure cooker, I was using it for mashed potatoes or corn on the cob.  It was the best pot roast I have made so far.  Usually they are too dry or not seasoned well.  This was perfect and easy!

This was really good.  The only packet of gravy I had was chicken gravy, so I used that and it was really good.  My husband and son really liked it to.  It was so much faster in the pressure cooker and was very fast and easy to make unlike some recipes.

....I made it as stated in the Recipe the first time.... The 2nd time the same day... I used Cardenas Dark Balsamic Vinegar instead of the Dry Italian Dressing. I like using my Pressure Cookers... That mode of cooking renders down all the fat. Some people like the fat.... I don't!!  Semper Fi! Godspeed!!

This was super dimple, easy, and deliscious. It was my very 1st pressure-cooker recipe and it's amazing.  I work very long hours in healthcare and when my usually long day turns into a 15 or 16-hr day Its great to know I can have a great dinner and some lunches i  about an hour. Fantastic!

Followed recipe except for, used 1/2 of low sodium gravy packet and adjusted pressure  cooker (Instant Pot) time to 70 minutes for 3.3 lbs. chuck  roast. Shredded the beef. One pound of baby carrots was cooked in microwave then added to shredded beef. Served over mashed potatoes, Bob Evans style. Delicious recipe, tender meat. 5 stars but take care of adding too much salt with 1 whole gravy packet.

Made the recipe as instructed. Used the Power Pressure Cooker XL. I recommend cutting the 3 lb. roast into 3 pieces to allow even cooking and setting the "meat" timer to 60 minutes. 3/4 of the way through, I added celery stalks, carrots, onions, and whole red potatoes, then set the timer for the remaining 15 minutes. Best winter comfort meal I've made in a while. And everything came out perfectly tender and super flavorful. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Awesome!  Could only found 2.5 lb chuck roast at supermarket. But it was perfect size, came out medium on the outside, rare on inside, so EVERYONE was happy.  So soft and juicy too!  Thanx MamaShea!

The meat was chewy. It tasted like veggy gravy. I added potato, turnip, carrot and celery for the last 15 minutes of pressure cooking. The celery all but disappeared. The rest of the veggies were passable but overcooked.

This was my first experience cooking with a pressure cooker.  Couldn't have turned out better.  Doubled the beef broth and added red potatoes and carrots after thirty minutes of cooking as suggested by another reviewer.  Then made the juices into a gravy.  It was great.  Will do this again.

Thanks for this recipe and suggestions. I bought a pressure cooker after not being able to make a tender potroast with my slow cooker-now that we're in the southwest.  No problems in midwest.  We blame it on the altitude or type of beef out here.
Based on the too-salty reviews, I mixed one packet of 'McCormick's slow cooker potroast seasoning' and 2 tsp of Penzey's roasted onion pressing into meat, and cut up 3 garlic cloves and poked into the meat.  Refrigerated 2 hrs(while watching the dvd on how to use the pressure cooker!) After browning meat in olive oil, I added 2 c water. 20 min before finished I added large chunks of carrots and potatoes.  Best of all it was tender and tasted great.  Mr. loved it!  It was salty enough with the one packet of mix. Thanks for helping me get over the PRESSURE COOKER fear!

I had thawed a roast, but forgot to put in on early enough to use the crock pot. So, I was looking for a recipe I could use to teach my 19 year old daughter how to make a pressure cooker roast.  We just happen to have all of these ingredients so I put to it. It came out perfectly! My 15 year old son had to test a bite as soon as the pressure went down and said "Oh this is good & just falls apart so tender!".  We then just added some canned potatoes and canned carrots (since I didn't have any fresh) and just a little more brown gravy mix/water for more gravy. 
Needless to say my family thought this meal was 
"Da Bomb!"  and my daughter has one more fail safe recipe to add to cooking repertoire!

Not bad. I don't like ranch salad dressing thus I omitted it. Next time that I use this recipe I will use my crock pot instead because the meat always turns out more tender that way. The au jus was delicious though without the ranch dressing mix.

I didn't make this in a pressure cooker (as I don't have one) but used all these ingredients and put it in a crock pot and was THRILLED with how it came out! Super tender, and fantastic flavor!!

Since finding this recipe, I decided it's the only way to cook roast. You can't mess up with the simple ingredients. It's fast and the roast turns out tender and very tasty!

This is so good and easy! I didn't have brown gravy mix at the time so I used country gravy mix and it still turned out fantastic! I did add some of our homegrown potatoes and carrots to top it off.
This has made it to my permenant recipe cards and will be a weekly fixin'.

Wow... this is an awesome pot roast recipe.I added an extra cup of water to dilute the saltiness of the broth.  Also, I left it cooking for an extra 20 minutes and the meat literally melts in your mouth.

The meat turned out great, I hated the seasonings.  The prepackaged seasonings gave the meat a muddled muted taste.

Family enjoyed this receipe but I found it just a little too salty as some have previously said.  I live in the UK so maybe some of the ingredients are a little different.  Meat was very tender and it couldn't have been easier to make.

I cannot say enough about this recipe, it was absolutely fabulous, my family was literally moaning "MMMM" the entire time they ate it. The only altercations I made to the recipe were out of necessity, I used 2c water, instead of beef broth (I didn't have any) For the gravy, I added 1/4 flour, 1c milk, and a 2nd brown gravy packet to help make up for the absence of the beef broth. It was a perfect meal; if it were possible for a six star rating this would be it. Thank-you, Thank-you!!!

GREAT RECIPE! This turned out very moist. I do not have a pressure cooker so I did mine in the oven. I thawed the meat and cooked at 350 for 1.5hrs covered.  One other suggestion said 3hrs ... but theirs might have been frozen then, cause mine was done and prefect.

EXCELLENT! My husband & I both loved this, so easy. Lots of good suggestions in other reviews as well ie: adding a carrot and mushing it into the sauce and adding a little water. Don't add any salt it's right on the edge of being too salty.

My family liked it a lot. I added a couple of potatoes and carrots halfway through the cook time so they wouldn't get too mushy. Worked fine. I also substituted 2 cups of water and a bouillon cube in place of the beef broth. With the extra vegies, it didn't seem too salty. It's a good and quick recipe for those days when there just isn't much time. All in all, a fine recipe for an American classic.

I dug my pressure cooker out of the back of the top shelf... and boy am I glad I did.  This was awesome.  We are beef ranchers and eat beef all the time and my husband just raved.  I will keep that pressure cooker to the front of the shelf.

I don't have a pressure cooker so I just cooked it in a  350 degree oven for 3.5 hours after browning on top the stove. It is the best I have ever eaten! I would suggest not salting your roast before browning. It is salty enough from the seasonings in my opinion.

I agree re the last reviewer's comments about the sodium content.  This can be addressed by using a low sodium beef broth, and perhaps halving the dry dressing mixes being used, and using them in a pre-cooking dry rub marinade for the beef, as someone else suggested.  Otherwise, excellent.

It's easy and it turns out perfect every time.  This recipe may be high in sodium content but it's delicious.  I had never used a pressure cooker before but with this recipe it wasn't hard.

Simply wonderful.
I didn't use the whole packet of dressing and that seemed perfect to me.  Didn't want to hide the flavor of the meat.  Really easy too, in my pressure cooker.  Can't lose with this recipe!

Made it for Christmas and it was a huge hit.  Thickened the jus with beurre manier for a wicked good gravy on homemade noodles.  It's rich (greasy) though - I'd skim some fat before making the gravy next time.  Love how easy it is.

I gave this 5 stars even though I tweaked it a bit. I left out the Ranch dressing mix, I don't really care for it and there are already 2 salty mixes called for. I cannot cook without plenty of garlic so I added 3 large cloves, minced, added 1/4 tsp of fresh ground black pepper and a good sized sprig of fresh thyme and a good glug of red wine. Even though I prepped the side dishes ahead of time, what amazed me so about this was how in such a short amount of time we had such a super tasty and tender pot roast. I did strain the juices and using a rue made some nice thick gravy. It's a keeper.

I would make again.  I added a packet of Lipton Beefy Onion soup to the dry ingredients, and it came out really good.   Had no Italian seasoning packet, but proved to be no big deal.  I found using McCormick Au Jus packet for the brown gravy packet was more tasty than a plain gravy mix.  I used a half cup of Cabernet, and a half cup of Better than Bullion Beef, plus a can of beef broth as well.  Browned the meat in the Instant pot, added a two cans of mushrooms (drained), along with the onion, as we like mushrooms, and set the Instant Pot for 43 minutes, let it do it's own release, removed the roast, cut it up and served over mashed potatoes along with the liquid in the pot.  A very good and tasty recipe.

I made this recipe according to directions except I followed one reviewer's advice and mixed the packets and rubbed them on the roast and refrigerated all day.  I also only used half of the rub mixture because I forgot to put the rest in when I switched to the pressure mode.  The flavor was still great without the second half of the seasonings.  I'm somewhat new to using the Instant Pot so after browning the roast when I put it to pressure cook mode I got a "burn" message.  I turned off the Instant Pot and reset it.  My roast turned out a little tough in some spots according to my family.  My portion was tender so I guess I got the sweet spot!  My family did like it and I will make it again for sure!

Was looking for items to cook in my pressure cooker.  Turned out really good.  Added potatoes and carrots to the cooker.  Potatoes and carrots was season just right.  It did not last long in my house.  Would make this again.

A couple of things...roast in the instapot just aren't tender enough for me. And I couldn't turn mine down or change it medium pressure once it's on high and counting down  maybe I read something wrong.  Anyways I ended up after the 45 min opening it and stirring in egg wide noodles a little more beef broth then cooking another 8 min.   Flavor was delicious just my meat had to be cut with a knife

My husband does not like roast but this recipe has changed his mind!!! The only change I did was I set my instant pot for 25 min, did a quick release - then I added petite red potatoes & baby carrots & I set the instant pot again for 10 min & another quick release - the roast & veggies were cooked perfectly!!! Yum :)

I used my Instant Pot and the cooking time was way off. The roast was still tough after 45 min.  I added 15 mins. then after 15 mins. I added carrots, celery and potatoes. Turned out just okay. I prefer my slow cooker recipe better.

Since I got this recipe I have made it many times. My sister discovered it first, and it's really the reason I decided to purchase a pressure cooker. It really is perfect! The only changes I have made are adding vegetables at the start. I add potatoes, onions, celery and carrots, cut large enough that they don't get too done before the meat. This is also really good over egg noodles. It is one of my familys favorites!

Very good easy to make. I used a small roast, 1.5 lbs. cut the cook time a bit, but not much. It was very tender. I made to much gravy for it but that was fine too.

I plan to make it often.
Loved it! Tasted great, simple to make.
I wasn't so sure with the dry (salad dressing) mixes on my roast.
Glad, I tried it.

Thank You

The meat was incredibly tender, cooked with onion and mushrooms. I did the carrots, potato and celery after the meat on high 5 minutes in the meat juices....perfect.   The seasoning was good but WAY too salty!  Next time I'll leave the gravy packet out, the meat and broth is  enough beef flavour and that should reduce the high salt level from all those instant packets combined.  But the meat was perfect in the pressure cooker.

I've been making this exact recipe in the crock pot for YEARS. It's been a hit at holidays and even had it ready on warm when my first time mommy cousin brought her newborn twins home from hospital! This recipe is PERFECT.

I mostly followed this recipe.  
I used the ranch dressing and brown gravy as seasonings but couldn't use the Italian dressing packet because my wife is gluten-sensitive and the packet noted that it contains wheat.  I tried just rubbing the roast with bottled Italian dressing to get the taste.  
  Although the meat wasn't bland, I didn't think the seasonings made it taste different than other pot roast, it was good, but not unique.  
  I also deviated from the recipe by adding potatoes and carrots.  I actually followed the instructions in Easy Pressure Cooker Pot Roast, (on this website), to determine when to add the vegetables -- cook meat under pressure 30 mins, quick-release pressure and add vegetables, cook everything under pressure for 15 mins more.  
  It was a good pot roast and the suggested seasonings help you get the roast ready for cooking quickly.

I made this for a SPECIAL DINNER last week and it was a big hit. I always use more veggies because I love them. Also I cooked them at 5 min so that they weren't over cooked.

Made as instructed using an 8 qt Instant Pot.  Adjusted cook time to 50 minutes due to a larger roast.  Perfect!

I have never been a huge fan of pot roast. Most of the time it just seemed greasy or boring! After making this, I completely changed my mind. This is an AMAZING recipe. I did what a few other reviewers recommended and used half the dry spices as a rub, and browned it well. The other half I sprinkled over the roast and the veggies I added in. Oh My God it was so good!! As a matter of fact, I think I will make this tonight. Its cool out, and the kids have soccer. Its done so fast in the pressure cooker its now one of our weeknight favorites as well!

So Iâ€™ve always been an oven pot roast person. I finally broke down and tried this. Iâ€™ve been afraid to use my Instapot bc Iâ€™m not generally down for using cooking methods that can explode if you screw up. I WILL NEVER COOK POT ROAST IN THE OVEN AGAIN!! This turned out PERFECT! Even my picky- son loved it! This is a huge deal for me! I didnâ€™t change anything other than quartering the onion instead of dicing. Also, I browned my roast in a skillet and not the cooking pot. Donâ€™t think that makes any difference, but I figured Iâ€™d say it. I will do this again!

I've done this multiple times, but meat is always not tender unless cooked longer than this. Doesn't matter if browned/not browned, cut up into chunks/ not cut up. I add celery, then when meat is about done add baby carrots.  Sometimes I put in a can of mushroom soup or mushrooms. Same recipe works great in crock pot, adding less liquid. Great flavor! Love the recipe.

Thank you for posting your recipe! My Husband said it was the most delicious dinner he's had in awhile. I followed directions with this exception; My chuck was 3.25lbs and I cooked it for 30 minutes, quick cooled added chopped veggies... 2 cups carrots, 1 cup celery, 4 med. size russets, 2 turnips and 1/2 C sliced mushrooms.  Brought back to high pressure and cook timed for another 10 minutes. Quick cooled and served! Yum!!

Great flavor but a little salty. Next time i will use only a 1/2 packet of Italian and Ranch dressing and maybe an extra 1/2 cup beef broth.

I have to say I am a very good cook, and I have never mastered the pot roast to perfection. This is it. I didn't have brown gravy mix so I used onion gravy mix, I didn't have Italian dressing so I used onion soup mix. OMG this gravy was the best ever.  The pot roast wasn't dry either. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

Moist and tender.  Just a few minutes prep and 45 minutes in my old fashioned stainless steel Innova Pressure Cooker  on a gas stove after coming to pressure. Perfect. I'm happy for people with new Instant Pots, but mine is the same thing, just top of stove and I don't need to replace something that works.
I don't use packets. Just garlic, onion and salt and pepper. I did use 2 beef boullion cubes and about 2 cups of water.

Initially I was kind of underwhelmed with this.  I don't think it was due to the recipe at all however.  I could not find chuck roast and the butcher suggested top or bottom round, I cannot recall which one.  I ended up cooking it for 100 minutes and thought it was still kind of tough.  My husband liked it which is a miracle in and of itself.  He ate most of it. 
 Today, I ate the last 3 slices cold and it was wonderful.  I plan to make this again with the plan to eat cold later.  I was amazed as an aside at how well the red potatoes stood up to 30 minutes of pressure cooking.  I figured they would turn to mush.

So yummy. I made this in my pressure cooker. For a 2.5 lb roast, we pressure cooked it on high for 30 minutes and then added potatoes and continued pressure cooking for an additional 15 minutes. Guests and children alike loved it so this one is a keeper!

If you make this exactly how it's directed, you will have every kid in your neighborhood knocking at the door.  I made this last night, and when the kids came over to study, our dinner quickly turned into the afternoon snack!!  One can hardly blame them, it smells so good wafting all over the house.  Great recipe!!!

I personally found it too salty.  the flavor was good otherwise. is you can choose low sodium alternatives, I'd suggest it. I served it over rice and added potatoes and carrots to my pressure cooker.

I followed advice of some reviewers and cooked 35 minutes added potatoes and carrots and cooked another 12 minutes.   Also, I didn't have the Italian dressing mix.  My husband said it was the best thing he'd ever eaten so we will definitely make again often.

Super tender and tasty roast, in about an hour. I steamed small potatoes above the roast in the cooker. The roast juice, mixed with cornstarch, made a perfect gravy for the potatoes.

Outstanding recipe!  I didn't really want the ranch dressing mix so I omitted it. I used a 3lb chuck roast and cooked on high for 30 mins, depressurized and added some carrots.  Cooked on high for a further 15 mins and DONE!  Highly recommend for someone trying pressure cooking for the first time.

I made this but in the slow cooker and it was delicious.  I chopped up an onion and later it in the bottom of the crock pot than floured the beef, beat it , and layer it on top of onions.  I made the gravy and added onion mix and used beef broth instead of water.  I than cut up potatoes in half and put them on top.  I cooked it on low for 9.5 hours.  it was delicious!  I had some leftover so I brought some to my parents and they LOVED it!  The hubby loved it too!  I highly recommend making this at least once.  DELICIOUS!!!

It was dead easy to make ... just followed the directions.  Couldn't find chuck roast locally, used a sirloin tip roast instead as that was the cheapest cut they had.

Less than an hour from start to finish, very tasty, lunches for a week!

Just took a frozen roast out of the freezer, used this recipe, substituted regular ranch for the powder mix and threw some A1 and Worcestershire......
The rest is history...
Amazing flavor. I did have too cook it for about 1.75 hours

I read a lot of the reviews before making this, and I decided to add some potatoes and carrots to the mix. I added them about 15 minutes before the roast was done. This was the first recipe I've made with a pressure cooker, but this was also the best pot roast I've ever had. I think it might have been too salty without the additional ingredients, but with them it seemed fine to me. The roast came out very moist, and the texture, unlike when a slow cooker is involved, came out very steak like (if that makes sense - not pulled pork like as it usually does). I'm already in love with the pressure cooker. I used a instant pot pressure cooker,  by the way, not a traditional style top type. I used this recipe as a guideline for cooking times and it seemed to work perfectly.

Tried this last night.  Family loved it.  Quick, simple, delicious.  Did not make any changes.  My roast was really thick.  Maybe needed to cook just a smidgen more.

Boy this turned out great!  The only change I did was to add mushrooms to the juices for gravy.  Paired with a nice Merlot!  Awesome!  I will definitely make this again.  Too easy.

Oh my GOODNESS!  This recipe gave me the incentive to use the pressure cooker that has been sitting in my pantry because I've been scared to death to use it :)  I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out GREAT!!!  The gravy was thick and tasty - I highly recommend this recipe!

Excellent recipe! I can't resist adding garlic and since I was out of beef broth, I used a can of french onion soup. I add the potatoes, more onions and carrots after the meat is finished cooking since they only take 3-5 minutes to be perfect and not mushy.  Everyone in my family loves and begs for this recipe!

Turned out great.  I had to substitute as I can't get some ingreds where I live, but still turned out fantastic.  I cooked at 10 lbs. for 40 min. but it could still have used a few more minutes and would have been fine.  The gravy was divine.  Will make again.

My husband and my baby loved this Pot Roast.  Next time, I'll have to decrease the time to 40 min because it was a little too overcooked.  Will definitely make it again and again.

I've had a hard time being consistent with pot roasts (kids always picking out the veggies). I hate the idea of the packages but I have to admit it was  wonderful, I threw the carrots in as suggested, I should have thrown in more veggies while it cooked, next time I will. I cut this up and added boiled potatoes and more veggies and the kids ate it as stew.Although I woulds prefer no processed stuff, to watch all 3 of my kids eating carrots and peas and asking for seconds is a trade off I am happy to make. THANK YOU

This turned out excellent.  The meat was tender and very flavorful and made a wonderful gravy.  I followed the recipe except I used about 1/2 of the seasoning mixes to reduce the sodium.

I add water until it reaches the top of the pot roast.  Also add garlic, carrots, potatoes and parsnips too.

I don't have a pressure cooker so I stuck this in the oven at 350.  The taste was great but my only complaint is that it was a bit salty.

Extremely good.  The beef falls apart in your mouth.  High in sodium though.  I wonder how much?

This was absolutely the best pot roast I've ever had.  The flavors are exceptional, and it's so easy.  I made stew from the leftovers and it was also great.
