I was a little nervous making these b/c the previous review was not too positive. There seemed to be a lot of graham cracker crumbs so I cut it down to 2-2 1/2 cups.  I also ran out of peanut butter so I only added 1/2 cup to the chocolate layer.  I did increase the chocolate chips a bit on top to balance the peanut butter base. It actually turned out pretty darn GOOD!  My kids looked like they had died and gone to heaven when I served them.  My husband thought they were way too rich to be brownie-sized.  I just cut them into 1 1/2 inch squares (no bigger) and they are great small pieces of heaven-(if you are into peanut butter and chocolate like I am).  I'd totally make this again!

I love chocolate and peanut butter and I love simple, but it must have been the graham cracker crumbs-they made me feel like I was eating something with whole wheat in them. Now I'm not opposed to whole wheat, but I wasn't looking for "healthy" if you know what I mean! They were okay, but I would probably never make them again. Bummer!

Easy, easy recipe. I followed original recipe and it was quick! Really rich so I cut into small bars and they were gone so fast I had to make more...

I was looking for something with more peanut butter taste.  These are ok for what they are.  The graham cracker crumbs do make them a bit gritty.

These were easy and tasty, but a bit too heavy and rich, almost more like fudge than bars.

Where I'm living, graham crackers can't be found, so I substituted chocolate cookies.  The cookies had chocolate chips in them, and I think that made the base softer and wetter than it should have been.  If I make this recipe again I'll use plain cookies, to balance out the strong sweet flavor of the chocolate peanut butter top layer.

This is a great recipe and very easy to make. I have not made any alterations to the recipe and they are always a huge hit! The first few times I made these, I bought graham crackers and crushed them myself, but I recently switched to the graham cracker crumbs found in the baking section and it makes things even easier.  These bars never last long and are always a hit!

I took these to a New Year's Eve party and they were a hit! My chocoholic friends couldn't get enough of them! They are VERY rich, so next time I will cut them a bit smaller.   Next year they'll be in my Christmas cookie line up!

I made these exactly to the recipe and had to throw the whole dish away. Obviously there is waaaaaaay to much gram cracker in them. Being they where so dry that the chocolate didn't even stick to the peanut butter bottom. I would definitely cut the gram crackers by half. Or use a different recipe!

Too buttery on the bottom for me. Everything else was just wonderful. The chocolate-peanut topping is one of the best chocolate creations I've ever tasted.
