I sauteed the mushrooms with some onions before combining it with other ingredients. I also added shredded mozzarella to the mixture and on top. I added about 1/4 teaspoon of salt in the mixture as well. It was delicious and a definite make again!

This is a very nice basic recipe that has lots of room for alterations based on what you like in your frittata. I had a bunch of veggies in my fridge that I knew wouldn't be used quickly enough before they spoiled so I tossed in broccoli, mushrooms, green onions, and grape tomatoes. Sauteed everything except tomatoes in a pan before mixing with ricotta cheese and eggs. Instead of parmesan I used a Mexican blend of 4 cheeses I had leftover from a taco dinner. Added cayenne and nutmeg to the other spices. Sprinkled more cheese on top and baked for 30 mins. I might have baked it a few minutes too long because it was a little dry but it was definitely a nice change from same old boring eggs and toast breakfast! Next time I might add some garlic, green peppers and potatoes. Would also be great with some bacon or sausage in there too. The possibilities are endless!

This was good and healthy and also easy to make. The kids ate it up. However I thought it needed it a something else maybe a little strong cheese such as feta and a little nutmeg? However quite good!

Great recipe! I did make some changes to create a low fat version. I used 8 eggs (2 eggs and 6 egg whites)a bit of skim milk and 1/3 cup light mozzarella cheese instead of ricotta, omitted the Parmesan cheese & scallions and used 1/4 tsp of rosemary and thyme. I also sauteed the mushrooms in olive oil and garlic before adding them to the egg/milk  mixture.

Very easy, nice flavor. I substituted cottage cheese for ricotta because I had it on hand, and it worked nicely.  Will make this one again!

I used 9 eggs (because I used a 9x9 baking dish), 1 box frozen chopped spinach, some mushrooms, bacon, feta/parm/shredded cheeses. I had to cook a little longer so that the eggs weren't runny. Def gonna make this again but with more bacon and half the spinach (whole pkg was spinach overload, and this is coming from someone who loves spinach) **update** after making this 3 different times, the secret seems to be bacon, and some chopped up fresh spinach (not frozen). I forgot to get bacon last time and it turned out too dry with just egg/spinach/sauteed mushrooms. Sauteeing the shrooms was overkill and botched the flavor as well. Cook a bunch of bacon, then chop it and use lots of cheddar cheese for best taste.

Perfect for a lazy Sunday dinner.  Easy to make and you could easily have this as a make ahead meal that is good enough to serve up for unexepected guests.  My only change was to add 2 tsp of garlic powder to the mixture before baking.  It took me 45 minutes to get my frittata to set.  The texture was lovely - not too greasy but full falvoured.  I didn't need to saute the mushrooms beforehand to get a great tasting dish.

Excellent! A healthy option to a quiche with crust. I used an entire bag of fresh spinach, sauteed the spinach with about five scallions, a dozen sliced mushrooms, dried thyme, rosemary and parsley,  in garlic-flavored olive oil and a bit of butter spray, then mixed that with the beaten eggs (I used 6), crumbled blue cheese, some mozzarella and a bit of milk, put the whole mess in a glass pie pan and baked at 375 for 30 minutes. Was delicious! Perfect vegetarian brunch, and would be even better with some crumbled cooked bacon or even cooked shredded chicken.

Served this twice this weekend, at 2 back to back birthday parties for my daughter, and everyone raved.  I sauteed my onions and mushrooms first (added a few extra white ones as well), and used dry basil alone because I don't love premixed spices.  Also on the second day when I made it I sprinkled in a little nutmeg and that really worked well.  A bunch of people wanted the recipe and even the kids ate it!!

Great recipe to make your own!!! This recipe is easy to customize just add your own wet or dry ingredients.  I used the spinach with some left over salmon, carrots and various cheeses on hand.  My hubby loved it!  Thanks

Using Extra Virgin olive oil, I first sauteed a chopped white onion and sliced portobello mushrooms then added several handfuls of fresh organic spinach.  Continued to cook until the spinach wilted down. To add some spicy heat, I added a half cup of pickled jalapeno slices.  My egg mixture was a whisked blend of six whole eggs (whites and yolks), fresh basil, fresh cilantro leaves, freshly grated parmesan cheese, 1/2 tsp of salt, a few generous turns of the pepper mill, and 1/2 cup of water to help fluff the egg mixture when it bakes.  I poured my egg mixture into the pan with the veggies, topped it with a shredded blend of Mexican cheeses, and placed the pan in the oven at 375 degrees for 25 minutes.  Woooo, Buddy!  Those eggs had wrapped their arms around the spinach and mushrooms to make a perfect marriage of awesome flavors!  It was a very fine meal.  Yes, indeed!  My Frittata was given the Stamp of Approval (SOA) from Mi Gato Loco.

I liked this, my BF loved it. Very good for people on the South Beach Diet, like we are! You could mix up the ingredients if you don't like mushrooms, or if you have something else on hand you need to use up. Make an extra and freeze it!

So good! I substituted one whole onion in place of the green onions then sauteed the onions with the mushrooms until soft. Other than that, I followed the directions exactly. It turned out fantastic!

Very very good. Had it for dinner for 3 and we ate the whole pie. I did not have ricotta cheese or green onions so used cottage cheese with chives.

YUMMY!  This was great!  I added three more eggs along with onion and finely diced poblano pepper.  Oh, and five pieces of bacon... it was a great recipe and I am sure I would have enjoyed it the way it was written, however, I love to add extras!  We loved it!

This recipe was great! I added chopped fresh, organic rosemary and thyme...I also used feta instead of parmesan.  Added an extra 1/2 cup or so of ricotta because I used fresh, uncooked spinach instead of the frozen stuff and I was worried it wasn't going to cook as well.  Finally, I topped the frittata with more feta. YUM!!

Fantastic recipe!   I made a few alterations because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. Like a previous user I substituted small curd cottage cheese for the ricotta. Instead of grated Parmesan cheese I used a colby/monterey jack mix I had leftover in the refrigerator. I did not have portobello mushrooms on hand so I used 1/2 lb white button mushrooms instead. I sliced them and sauteed them with 1/4 medium yellow onion (again, I did not have any green scallions) in a small bit of butter until soft. I also added 1/4 teaspoon dried basil.   The frittata turned out fantastic!! In the future I may add some feta cheese and perhaps substitute the eggs with egg whites. This made a great lunch/ dinner!  Overall my family and I were very pleased!!!

This was great. Just made this based on what I had. I used fresh spinach 12oz that I wilted. I also used 1 cup of egg whites and added 1 additonal egg. I didnt have ricotta so used 1 cup of 2% cottage cheese and used less parmesan and added some fat free feta. Everything else remained the same but added 3 slices of turkey bacon crumbled. This was really good. Thank you.

Just made this, and it was BETTER than I imagined! Recommend a frittata pan. I can't say that I measured - just put in the amounts I liked. I of course, sauted the yellow onion and mushroom before hand. Add green onions as directed and a bit of NUTMEG as suggested by another reviewer. Will have guests over for this one - YUM!!!

I followed the recipe exactly and dont know what went wrong.  The middle didn't set.  I tried leaving the dish in for longer and it didn't really help..  Of what was cooked, the dish was good!  I'll attempt a second time, hopefully with different results

Although I had to make substitutions based on my pantry, I thought this dish was very good.  (Sub cottage cheese for ricotta, added feta & used less Parmesan, doubled spiced, added fresh jalapeno.)  It baked very nicely and had a rich flavor and texture.

A great base to play with. I swap out the filler ingredients and mix it up a lot - it's always delicious! Fast, easy and filling. Too bad my husband won't eat eggs...

I had a 16 ounce package and added 1 extra egg, so the ratio of spinach to egg was much higher, but we loved it!  I sauteed the mushrooms with onions, garlic, fresh basil, fresh parsley, fresh oregano and just a bit of butter for some creaminess before throwing it into a glass pie dish.  With a glass dish and all the extra spinach, the cooking time was about 25 minutes. It was still a little soft in the middle but after resting for about 5 minutes or so it was perfect.  Great recipe. Definite do-over for us.

Just made this and it was yummy! My husband loved it. I didnt have any mushrooms so I didnt add them I was also out of ricotta cheese so I used cottage cheese. Instead of parmesan I used grated cheddar. I will absolutely be making this again. Great meatless meal.

This was good.  I sauteed the mushroom with some onions first, then sauteed fresh spinach.

This was a great easy recipe for lunch. Like other reviewers, I too sauted the onions and mushrooms first before combining the ingredients. Came out so tasty. My picky eaters ate it up and wanted seconds. Will definately make again.

This was so delicious and easy to make.  Growing up in an Italian family Frittata was a regular dinner menu and making it brought back wonderful memories.
I added pre-cooked diced new potatoes about 1/2 cup just because my mom always put them in her frittata.  Enjoy...

As always I adjust the recipes to what I had on hand. I used fresh spinach and had no mushrooms or scallions. I added canadian bacon and lots of garlic! Came out awesome and a great healthy breakfast!

I make this whenever I have leftover ricotta.  It's delish and easy.  Just make sure you saute the fresh mushrooms and onions before adding them to the mixture.

This was fabulous! I did saute the onions and mushrooms first. I used low fat ricotta. I also added 10 links of cooked turkey sausage because I love meat in everything. It added a great spice! The cooking and cooling times were perfect. This was very easy and delicious. Will definitely make again very soon! Thanks for the recipe!

This didnt have much flavor, if I made again I would saute the mushrooms so they aren't hard when you take a bite, and I would add more seasonings.

i really liked this recipe, but my family thought it was just okay.  i like how healthy and flavorful it was.  i used fresh spinach and wilted it in a skillet along with the mushrooms and scallions before adding the eggs to them.  i replaced the ricotta cheese with cottage cheese (because that was all i had) and sprinkled some cheese on the top.  delicious!

This was great.  I had to use a block of cream cheese instead of ricotta. My mixture was a little dry so I added an extra egg and two splash of milk. I also used green onions instead of scallions and I used regular white mushrooms.  I needed to cook it longer than 30 minutes.  I'd suggest 40 minutes at least.

Used 6 eggs instead of 4 otherwise made exactly as listed except for a sprinkling of feta cheese on top. Excellent for our Meatless Monday last week alongside of Garlic Roasted Cauliflower also from this site. Thanks for posting. We'll be doing this one a lot.

So easy, and delicious.  I varied it a bit, using what I had in the house.  Instead of ricotta I added garden salad cottage cheese, and in place of the scallions, chopped onion.  I also added diced green pepper.  A wonderful recipe to have on hand for a quick meal.  Thanks for posting it.

Over the past few months, I have tried this recipe as directed and with many alterations.  It is a great 'basic' recipe.  Try ham, turkey sausage, sour cream, cream cheese or cheddar cheese, broccoli, substitute bacon cooked with a little Worcestershire sauce.  It's great.  I use an oblong baking dish that has a cover, take out the portions needed for the day and return to the frig for the next day.  It's great reheated in the microwave.

Followed the recipe except for the fact that I added mozzarella on top as one reviewer suggested and I used fresh herbs from my garden instead of dried.  Served with salad and pinot noir.

Would be really good with tomatoes.  Also, I used fresh spinach and cooked it and the mushrooms down.  Also, some fresh basil or cilantro would help with seasoning.

This is super delicious!  I sautéed the mushrooms, onions and spinach (fresh, not frozen).  I also added basil, oregano, thyme (all dried) along with salt and pepper.  I omitted the parmesan cheese and used cottage cheese instead of the ricotta.  It was so good, I would make this again!!!!

Great recipe, however I did play with it based on the ingredients I had on hand.  In lieu of ricotta, I used a 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt and a 1/4 cup milk.  Instead of spinach, I had red and green bell peppers on hand, so I added those along with the scallions and mushrooms.  I had mild cheddar on hand, so used that instead of the parmesan.  Finally, I added crushed up corn tortillas to the bottom of the pie pan before pouring in the egg mixture, to give it a density and "crust."  Yummy.  Will definitely make again!

I felt like this was OK, but not stellar. It didn't have that much flavor and came out kind of dry. I did have to substitute dried minced onions for the shallots and put in some mozzarella along with the parmesan. You couldn't even taste any of the cheese.

This turned out so yummy  - but I had to improvise with what I had at home!  I used 1 bag of fresh spinach and sauteed it with a little garlic, chopped vidalia onion and the portobello mushrooms.  Sauteed spinach until it started to wilt, then followed the directions.  Definitely a keeper, will be making this one again! Delish, husband liked it also.

Love this recipe! I changed it up a little- added artichokes instead of mushrooms because it's what I had on hand. I used fat free cottage cheese and a little more garlic and italian seasoning and it still came out great and a little bit more healthy.

This one is so delicious!  My family loved it.  I also sauteed the onions and mushrooms ahead of time.  we kept the leftovers in the freezer, but even those went quickly.  Thank you for putting this one out there.

This was FANTASTIC! I love when a new recipe becomes an instant favorite. ;)  I did change a couple things though. I didn't buy the mushrooms because you had to buy a large package of them. I tried diced red bell pepper instead. My middle was a bit moist as someone else mentioned but I am sure it is because I didn't drain the spinach as well as I should have. I saw a bit of green juice and I think that was what made it not set as well. It didn't matter it was still VERY tasty and I'll make this again and again! thanks for the recipe!

Edible, but just not my cup-o-tea. I found the spinach to be very overwhelming in texture as well as flavor. I couldn't taste the ricotta at all. I may try a variation of this again, but as written it just missed the mark for me. Thank you so much for sharing though, I'm sure others will think it is great if they are big spinach fans. =)

Excellent recipe. I added one additional egg, several strips of crumbled bacon, and for the parmesan cheese part, I added half parmesan and half shredded swiss. Also added a quarter cup of feta cheese. Delicious!

Liked very much, made it for a group gathering with a chili sauce to put on top. People raved, nice touch with the ricotta. I can't eat dairy, but tried a small piece anyway, didn't make any adjustments except the optional chili sauce.

Delightful!  Used it for brunch for 5, probably should have made two. I used fresh spinach and steamed it first, then drained it well and squeezed the excess fluid out. Since there isn't a buttery crust, it was a delicate egg dish that satisfied the craving of a vegetarian for an egg-bake.

I would give this 4.5 stars because it was very tasty!  I have made this recipe twice.  The first time I used regular mushrooms because I did not have portobellos.  It worked just as well.

This was great, and it was so easy to make!  I used fresh spinach instead of frozen, which I would recommend wilting before putting it into the mix.  I liked it so much, I will be making this for our Easter brunch on Sunday.

We really enjoyed this dish. It was my first attempt at making a frittata and with the exception of missing the oven temperature  being 180C not fahrenheit ...which I didn't realize until it was in the oven for 15 minutes (and not cooking)  it still turned out great for dinner....once I turned up the heat.   Silly mistake on my part...but, super tasty. Will be making it again this week!

Loved it!! The only change I made was adding garlic powder and cayenne pepper. I don’t like eggs that much and it was delicious. I topped it off with a dab of light sour cream and hot sauce. Yum!

I was looking for a way to use up some scallions, mushrooms, spinach and leftover ricotta I had in the fridge. Imagine my delight at finding this recipe!
I made it exactly according to recipe, except added two slices of  cooked bacon, crumbled (so my husband would be willing to try it).  
In the end, it was easy to make (set in the middle just fine), tasted good and once my husband added A LOT of salt and pepper, he ate two large servings.

A delicious and simple change of pace for egg preparation. Takes a little bit longer to prepare than some recipes but the results are well worth it. Feel free to substitute whatever vegetables you may desire and enjoy!

I sauteed half the mushrooms with garlic and shallots and used the other uncooked. Obviously, bacon and red pepper also were added. a smackeral of sharp cheddar and an extra egg. (Added too many extra things:)

Delightful.

Don't forget to squeeze out extra moisture from fresh cooked spinach

Very good! Although I did make a few changes/ substitutions. I used fresh baby spinach and sautéed them with chopped red onion, chopped garlic and sliced baby Bella mushrooms. I left out the ricotta in order to make it less fattening. I also didn’t have scallions on hand. I only had a 9.5” pie pan so I used 6 eggs and it filled the pan perfectly. Next time I may get creative with the seasoning because leaving out the cheese left it a little bland.

What an easy and nutritious meal! I sautéed onion, garlic, asparagus and spinach, added to the eggs with parmesan cheese and then added cut up campari tomatoes on the top and sprinkled more parmesan and baked.  It only took about 20 min in my oven.  This really is a make as you want kind of dish, perfect for anytime.

It was the night before Christmas Eve and the supermarket shelves were bare, so I did some substituting. No frozen chopped spinach so I used frozen broccoli florets instead and chopped them extra fine. I also used whole-milk ricotta and a fifth egg. Everything blended beautifully, but it took 50 minutes in the oven to firm up and get browned at the edges. It was delicious.

We just happened to get some fresh crab the day I made this, so I cracked and put fresh crab in it, yummy.  Also, since I am frugal and try to use what I have, I thought I had cottage cheese, which I use instead of Ricotta.  Oops out of that too, so I used sour cream, worked great!

i made this recipe as part of a Canadian Allstar Recipe Challenge #Dinnerunder30. i only rated this 4 stars because i mistook my sour cream for ricotta and therefore didn't stay true to the recipe as written, however, it was VERY GOOD!  it turned out to be i'm going to guess, somewhat lighter but still very flavourful. i also used fresh spinach as that's what i had, and sauteed it with the mushrooms. i prepped the spinach and mushrooms in the morning, so i made this come together quite quickly. Seeing i didn't have any ricotta, i just used a splash of  milk. This was very good. served with a Caesar Salad.

Followed instructions to a tee, but we just didn't like this at all. Way too bland. It was like eating a side dish of spinach for an entree. The hubby said the spinach taste overpowered the rest of the dish. We ended up going out for fast food at the Golden Arches, since it was too late to fix anything else. Neither one of us cared for this dish.

Hubs really enjoyed this. I used 8 oz. of mushrooms and subbed   a leek for the green onion. Due to dietary restrictions I couldn't add the cheese and added an extra two eggs to compensate. I too cooked the mushrooms before adding to the egg mixture. Thanks for sharing.

I substituted cottage cheese for the ricotta and used cheddar cheese in place of parmesan.  I also added the following:  1/4 tsp each of salt, pepper, onion powder, granulated garlic, and one tablespoon dried onion.   This made a delicious breakfast.  But it would work just as well for lunch or dinner.  It turned out delicious and I will definitely be making it again.

This was delicious.  I followed the recipe except for omitting the oregano, and I had fresh beet greens to use up, so subbed that for the spinach, finely chopped.  Used one large portobello.  Our guest loved it and so did we.

I used fresh spinach which I sautéed in olive oil with the mushrooms and green onions before mixing with the other ingredients. I also used 6 eggs. I baked it for 40 minutes. I will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe just as it is listed, but I added some zucchini squash, red bell pepper, and 1/2 can of stewed tomatoes (well drained).   I found that it was not cooked all the way through at 30 minutes (probably due to variances is oven temperatures, etc.), I put aluminum foil over the top to seal it and continued to bake for approximately 15 minutes longer.  The aluminum keeps it from drying out too much.  I've already made this recipe 3 times and have added different vegetables each time- always turns out great!

Make sure to really,really squeeze the spinach dry. I used yellow onion instead of scallions, added some sweet bell peppers, and sauteed them along with the mushrooms.  When the mushrooms were brown and had shrunk considerably (they lost their water) added the spinach and sauted a bit longer. Let cool a bit to avoid cooking the eggs before stirring in the remaining ingredients. Since I ended up with quite a bit more veggies then the recipe called for I added a fifth egg.  Turned out beautifully and I enjoyed this very much. It was 4 not-too-generous-or-gluttonous-just-normal-adult-meal-size servings for me.

I used fresh spinach and cheddar instead of ricotta cheese. Added fresh basil and cilantro and was quite pleased with the results. I'm definitely making this again for when family visits from foreign.

This was so delicious! I used a handful of fresh spinach and added a sprinkle of seasoning salt. I also added shredded mozzarella cheese on top and it took 45 minutes to set. Next time I may add some diced red pepper. Keeper!

Good.  I sauteed half an onion with some bacon first, then wilted the spinach.  I beat the eggs separately, then added the cheeses before mixing in with spinach mix.

I used fresh spinach, after washing just make sure you squeeze out all the water.  I loved the flavor but my daughter thought it had too much spinach.  May have been my fault, may have added more than asked for. I don't know what people were talking about being bland, I thought it had great flavor.  Next time I think I'll just slice the mushrooms instead of chopping. That way you can taste the mushrooms more, it was hard for us to taste them. I did use white button mushrooms.  There is a lot you can do with this base.

This was good, made exactly as written, maybe a little bland, possibly I didn't season enough, but I will certainly try again, it was a great start, might add some zucchini or shredded carrots next time.

A heartfelt WOW!  I made this frittata yesterday and, as usual, couldn't make it totally by the recipe - I had to modify it, so used 2C of baby bellas, about 3/4C scallions, whole milk ricotta, 1-1/2 tsp (coffee spoon, not measuring spoon) of Hoisin sauce (though I don't know why - just thought I'd put it in there), 1/4 meas. spoon of crushed red pepper and a layer of Chipotle Turkey (from the deli) at the halfway point of pouring into my 9.5" quiche pan, overlapping as I went, finished pouring mixture, then topped with more parmesan.  Everything else was according to the recipe.  OMG - One husband, one SIL and me and it was GONE!!  Super good and will make again.  Thanx for the recipe!!

I had some fresh beet leaves so I replaced the spinache with this.  I used 6 eggs and substituted the scallions with a small onion from my garden.  I didn't have ricotta on hand so I eliminated it.  This was so flavourful I can only imagine how good it would have been if I followed the ingredients to a T.

This recipe rocks. Just added an extra egg white but otherwise followed the recipe. Hubby kept on saying how great this was. Terrific summer recipe. Accompanied with a NY Times recipe of tomato, blue cheese, fig and pine nut salad. With a glass of Sancerrre was in heaven.

Subbed fresh baby spinach for frozen; added 2 chopped jalapeno peppers and fresh basil. Mixed 4 eggs, ricotta cheese, and Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl. With the veggies and seasonings in a large bowl, stirred in the egg mixture. Everything poured into a 9" x 13" baking dish. Super easy and fast, and very tasty . . . no leftovers which speaks for itself.

Very good weekend breakfast!  I am planning to freeze the leftovers and eat them for South Beach Breakfast.  I didn't have portobello or scallions, so I substituted white mushrooms and sweet onion.  Turned out great!  Definitely a make-again recipe!

Delicious!  I used regular button mushrooms because that was all I had.  Other than that, I made it exactly as written.  Easy and healthy.  4 WW PointsPlus if you say there are 5 servings in it.

I use the kind of spinach that comes in a bag instead of a box, so I could just add it to the mixture frozen and use as much or as little as I wanted. I also added frozen onions and peppers. (no need to cook prior to baking) I used mozzerella cheese because I didn't have any ricotta and it came out excellent with about 30 minutes of baking!

Great! Next time I won't use fresh spinach. I didn't like the process of steaming/wilting it myself. The spinach retains too much water. It was annoying trying to squeeze out excess water and boiling hot! I also didn't use portobello, just regular mushrooms and they were fine. I added my favourite Greek seasoning as well. Great recipe! But I found it poofed up like crazy in the oven and by the time it was ready it had shrunk really thin. My husband looked at it and said "that's dinner?". However, it tasted fantastic.

I thought it was great, I would use less spinach next time and I totally agree that it's a great basic recipe that you can add any type of veggies too and it would be good.

Added cajun fried potatoes, shallots, garlic and left out the spring onion. Cooked it a bit too long so was a bit on the dry side, but overall very nice.

I enjoyed this recipe very much!  I actually skipped lunch waiting to make this, and then ate almost half the pie plate :-)  I didn't have green onions, so I just used a yellow. I think it would be great too with some turkey bacon. This recipe is definitely on my make again list.

This was an easy and delicious recipe.  I added sauteed onions.  My family loved it, and suggested I add bacon next time, which would probably be delicious.  I would also try this recipe with a home-made wheat crust, although it certainly would add some calories and fat...

Its really good... I added more ricotta and i used Italian Bread Crumbs with Romano cheese. gave it a really yummy flavor. The mushrooms made it a little bit runny, but the taste was still really good.

This was really good. I think I would like it a little bit more as a quiche and my husband wasn't too fond of it. Very easy to make, and a good way to masque vegetables too! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a Father's Day Brunch and everyone loved it. Most everyone went back for seconds and there was none left over! Even got a recipe request. Baked longer than the listed time to achieve golden-brown top and enough cooking. Served with sourdough toast and fresh berry medley.

This recipe was pretty good. It would definitely be a great addition to a brunch. I made several change, mostly out of necessity. 

1 - I used red peppers and onions instead of mushrooms b/c I didn't have any. And yes, I fried them for a little before putting them in with the other ingredients.
2 - I used less scallions than called for b/c I'm not a huge fan of them. 
3 - I used basil instead of a mixture, and also added about 1/8 tsp garlic powder. Next time I'd definitely try the nutmeg.
4 - I used whole milk ricotta by accident. Don't think it made a big difference. 
5 - I threw in a little bit of feta. Not very much though.

The recipe says it's done with it's browned, but this didn't brown much except on the edges. It did set more than I was expecting though, so I could definitely tell it was done. (I hadn't made a frittata before.) 

So I'd definitely recommend this for a brunch or part of a meal. It tastes even better the next day!

Delicious!  I added fresh tomatoes & zucchini (instead of spinach, because I didn't have it!), and I cooked it in my cast iron skillet for about 10 minutes to brown the bottom before putting in the oven for the remaining 15 minutes.  My 4 year old proclaimed it "very wondeful".
