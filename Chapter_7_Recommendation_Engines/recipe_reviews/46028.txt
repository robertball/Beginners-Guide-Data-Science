While I always make sauteed mushrooms when Hubs grills steaks,  I've never seasoned them quite like this, nor have I cooked them with wine.  These had such great flavor!  Hubs and I both enjoyed them.  So you don't boil or stew the mushrooms,  make sure your heat is up high enough when you add the wine so that it reduces quickly.  I added the chives just before serving to retain their color and flavor.

Add a little butter near the end to finish the dish -- also, use a variety of mushrooms for a little extra boost...I don't salt the mushrooms until the very end, as it draws out too much moisture during the saute process..sprinkle with a little fresh chopped parsley and if you like, a little grated parmeseean cheese.

Mmmm. I just finished eating a plate full of "herbed mushrooms with white wine" and I am still a little dizzy from how delicious they were! They had all the incredible flavor you'd expect from some fancy restaurant and yet I made them in my own home for about two bucks and in about five minutes. Amazing. With garlic, white wine and olive oil you just can't go wrong. The 'shrooms were meaty and delicious.
note: I used half butter half olive oil
another note: learn from my mistake and don't add the garlic early! It will burn and get bitter. (Even with the toasty garlic though, this was SO yummy).

A wonderfully yummy and easy accompaniment to steak.  Remember that the mushrooms lose a lot of volume during cooking so be sure to start with far more than you think you'll need.

Superb!!  I'll make for my next dinner party!

I used Baby Bellas, and used butter instead of olive oil.  I found an italian herb grinder (disposable, filled w/ herbs) in my grocery store for about $2.79 and used that, it was sooooo yummy, tasted more like fresh herbs than dried.

A total hit & keeper- easy & delicious!

Its very good! I dont like mushrooms all that much but this recipe makes them taste wonderful. I added a pinch of oregano, basil, and thyme. Then I placed the mushrooms over pasta with alfredo sauce. It works for a very quick, tasty meal.

I absolutely love mushrooms! These herbed mushrooms were so tasty and full of flavor-nothing overpowering. I bought a container of white button mushrooms, cleaned it with a damp paper towel and cut in half. Since I am new to " white wine" I bought a small 4 pack of chardonnay, not sure where to start. The only thing I did not have on hand and could not find nearby was fresh chives. Towards the end I added a pinch of salt and pepper. This did not take long to cook and I could smell the wonderful wine, garlic and mushrooms. I made these with,"Grilled Delmonico Steaks," from this site, and with brown rice. I ate everything up!

Excellent recipe!!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the chives which I did not have.  My husband is not a mushroom fan but he really liked this dish.  I used it as a side dish but these mushrooms would be great on a burger too.  Thanks so much for sharing such a quick, easy and delicious recipe!

This is a great recipe but, there's no need to cook down the wine. I just heated it. We couldn't stop eating them.

Excellent mushrooms!  I used Belle mushrooms, I'm not sure what the difference between those and regular mushrooms are, but they looked good when I bought them.  I also used white cooking wine instead of "dry white" as directed and a little more olive oil than ordered, just a little because I wasn't sure what was going to happen to those poor mushrooms without it.  Turns out they lose a lot of their moisture into the pan and I probably didn't need to add any extra.  

I will definately make this again, it tasted and smelled great!!

The only changes I made were to halve the recipe as it was just my hubby & I. I topped the mushrooms off w/ fresh (I mean the fresh stuff) grated (fresh mozzarella is very pliable so stick it in the freezer for 30 minutes or so to make it easier to grate) mozzarella cheese before adding the chives. These were tasty but I think next time I will use butter to saute them in & add lots more garlic. The fresh basil is a good idea too...maybe I'll give that a whirl.

Very good recipe!  I sauteed in the olive oil, plus a small pat of butter, added the salt after the mushies were browned, sauteed the garlic for a minute before adding the wine to reduce.  Dont even think of skipping the salt, it's necessary to bring out the sweetness in the wine.  Yum!

This is now my go-to recipe for mushrooms to accompany meat dishes. Love it, and I didn't change a bit of the recipe -- it's perfect as is. Don't let the simplicity fool you!

This is a great recipe. I have made it several times and it's alway a hit. Over time I found that to make it really smashing you must use baby bella mushrooms in addition or instead of  regular mushrooms, and use a little bit of cornstarch to thicken that delicious wine sauce.

This recipe was really good except that the garlic was WAY undercooked.  The garlic almost needs to be added at the same time as the mushrooms...unless you like crunchy garlic.

Very happy with this recipe. I expanded it a bit and made it into chicken and musrooms by adding chicken strips and white wine and a little chicken bouillon powder. All I needed then was a salad and rolls. Great meal. Thanks!!!

Incredible. 

I only added another tablespoon of butter. Nothing else. If I were to make these again, and I will, I'd double the recipe. Even the kids loved these.

Loved this recipe! Will Make Again! I used half olive oil and half butter. I put the butter in with the garlic last. It was a definite treat to the taste buds. Kudos!

Excellent! These were very tasty on their own as a side dish, but I also envision using these again on top of a burger and as a great topper to fettucini alfredo! I didn't think the chives were necessary, however you may find otherwisw. Very versatile -- this is a keeper!

I liked it (and my guests did too) but I can't say it turned out fabulous.  I adding a little butter at the end (per some of the reviews) but it just didn't do much to enhance the flavor.  Will try again with some adjustments. Maybe more salt for the final step or fresh herbs instead of dried?  Will try again.

Delicious! Great as a side dish or serve over rice or pasta for an awesome vegetarian dinner. I followed the recipe as is except I love garlic so I tripled the garlic amount. I might have added a little extra wine too:)

I followed this recipe as written and would not change a thing!  Normally once I try a recipe for the first time, I will follow it as written and the next time I make it, I will tweak it to my liking.  This recipe needed no tweaking what-so-ever.  Everybody LOVED it!   This recipe was an excellent addition to Rack of lamb & Gnocchi with Fontina Cheese sauce (found at allrecipes).  I will definately be making this one again as well as other family members that asked for this recipe.

I love sauteed mushrooms but instead of white wine I use cream sherry and just butter. The chives aren't even necessary. The mushrooms are DELICIOUS just like that!

I just had a small amount of mushrooms that needed to be used, so I decided to make a scaled version of this recipe.  We really liked them and I’ll definitely make them again, but I’ll plan to have more mushrooms on hand next time!  I didn’t measure when making this and probably used a bit more oil and just poured in a glug of wine.  Very nice flavor

GREAT recipe! I cooked the garlic along with the mushrooms and it cooked down nicely. I also used more than 1/4 cup white wine and cooked that down as well.

These mushrooms sounded so good, but when I made it exactly according to the recipe, I thought they were pretty bland.  My three year old daughter loved them though and ate almost all of them.  I probably wouldn't make them again.

I really love the taste of these simple-to-make mushrooms.  I used small cremini mushrooms.  Don't forget that the mushrooms will "shrink" when cooked.  I also threw together a few herbs from my garden for the italian seasoning portion: oregano, rosemary, sage & thyme.  Probably about 2 tablespoons of that mixure.  Unfortunately my chives are not ready, but the dried chives didn't make a difference.

I followed the recipe to the T, using 50/50 white and chestnut mushrooms - the result was delicious.  It's the perfect accompaniment to Veal Fricassee.  Although I made enough for 6, the whole lot was devoured by 4 people and I was asked to share the recipe. ;)

Very easy, tasty side dish.  I used fresh parsley and oregano instead of italian seasoning, added a touch of butter and cut down on the olive oil a bit.  This is pretty much how I'd sautee mushrooms anyway, but it would be a very helpful yet impressive recipe for someone just starting out in the kitchen.

This was quick, easy and delicious and a nice savoury dish for my vegetarian son.  Those of us who like mushrooms, loved it.  I made one change and that was to use about a tsp. of chopped garlic from a jar instead of mincing my fresh garlic because I was juggling many dishes and wanted the short cut.  I'd do that again next time.

Very good. This dish is simple, quick and easy. Made it EXACTLY per recipe (which colors my opinions regarding other reviews). Complexity/Depth of flavor are my requirements for 5 stars, and I would not say that this dish satisfies that in either case. That being said, it is still a very good side dish. Showstopper? No. But, if you like mushrooms, you'll definitely enjoy this and you'll get no complaints at your dinner party!

I used a pound of whole white mushrooms cut in half.  Doubled the wine and used an extra clove of garlic.  To finish the dish I put in in a 400 degree oven. Some of the reviews said it was bland, I tasted it and added the salt and pepper just before I put it in the oven.  Served the mushrooms and sauce over pasta, the whole family said this was a keeper.

I enjoyed this so much.  It's so simple, yet it packs a lot of flavor.  I had ran out of italian seasoning, so I used herbs de provence instead, and it was great.  I will definitely repeat this one.  Served with grilled filet mignon and mashed potato.

OMG...just scarfed up a plate of these!  So...I didn't have any chives or "Italian Seasoning".  I used oregano, basil, thyme, and parsley and just 'guessed' when shaking the herbs over the pan.  I did add a pat of butter at the end when I added salt and pepper.  I also ate them while enjoying a glass of the same wine I used to deglaze the shrooms with - Kirkland Chardonnay.  Thinking about making a second batch right now...yummy!

This is a wonderful side and very easy to make.  It could probably be turned into a nice sauce for pasta or poultry as well. I didn't use Italian seasoning or chives because I didn't have them, just a mix of herbs I had on hand such as rosemary, thyme, and parsley.  The subtle flavors worked perfectly with the mushrooms. Enjoy!

I had an 8 oz package of sliced shrooms I had to use - this was perfect - quick, easy list of ingredients and tasty. Since mine were sliced I didn't cook a full ten minutes; just until they were soft. And I didn't have chives but didn't miss them as the Italian seasoning and garlic made my taste buds happy.

Yum! We don't have mixed italian herbs in one bottle, so I just used what we like that I had on hand - parsley, oregano and a tiny bit of rosemary. and the chives. Oh, and sometimes I add a little chunk of butter into the oil, so it almost sautees - we like it. This was so easy and delicious! will make it regularly.

These were delicious and smelled so fantastic cooking away. I covered them while cooking them and they retained a lot of moisture that I had to cook off later. Trials to cooking on my part. Thanks for the recipe.

These are insanely good, especially the minute they're done. If you plan on serving them, I would do so right away because they're not as good as they cool down, but otherwise, YUM!

I've been looking for a good mushroom recipe and this definitely fits the bill! Followed the recipe exactly and even my husband, who normally won't eat mushrooms, complimented me on how good they were. The dish is impressive enough to serve for guests as well.

A light and tasty side dish. As usual with mushrooms, don't hesitate to double quantitites if you like your plate full of veggies!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I cooked my mushrooms with red wine because that's the bottle that was open, and they were great.  They were even good the next day.  I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent recipe and very easy to make.  I took asparagus, cut into quarters (half of a bunch) and added a couple minutes before the mushrooms . . . what a GREAT additional.  I also noticed a lot of users saying that it was too soupy or that they couldn't get it to reduce.  I like making this recipe with half portobello slices and half white, which produces a lot of moisture.  Just extend your cooking time a little to allow the mixture to reduce before adding the wine.  The extra time it takes (just a few minutes) will pack all of that flavor into the moist mushrooms . . . the little juice that's left over is AWESOME!

Quick & easy. I sometimes make this as an appetizer if we're hungry for a snack while preparing dinner. A sprinkle of coarse black pepper before serving adds a nice kick. Great recipe as is that adapts nicely to additional ingredients if you wish.

Yum! Didn't have any white wine so I used red. The chives were a great touch and added a wonderful flavor to the cremini mushrooms I used. Because I was making a huge dinner last night, I cooked these up in the afternoon and just reheated. Delicious and thank you Laura!

I like to add a little balsamic vinegar to mine as well, and always end up adding additional olive oil and wine depending on how fast the mushrooms saturate the initial liquid.  Good base recipe.

This recipe is soooo good! I used sliced mushrooms and added this as a topping to fettuccini alfredo. Although about half of the mushrooms were eaten before I had a chance to serve the meal.

Very tasty. Brown or crimini mushrooms are great for this recipe as they won't release as much water as white mushrooms. Also make sure to use a drinkable wine for this recipe as the wine is an important flavor. Great for a variety of fresh mushrooms, but I have used this with success even on mushrooms that are a little "past their prime." Thanks!

I made this recipe with dried ingredients and it came out perfect. I switched the green onions for dried parsley and it was good. Best of all, it is ready in a jiffy and is a good side for those dishes in which you want the protein to be the main course and focus. I served it with roasted chicken thighs and it was nice!

Instead of olive oil I used butter, only because I like butter better. This is a really nice recipe. I didn’t find it bland or too garlicky, but I’ve made wine mushrooms pretty often with different recipes. I added shallots at the end and mixed it with a tomato Parmesan sauce to put into pasta.

I made this to go on top of pan seared pork chops.  I didn't have Italian seasonings (time to organize that spice cabinet) so I used basil, oregano and parsley.  Left out the garlic because I already seasoned the chops with it and I didn't want to overwhelm. Delish!  Perfect addition to any type of meat.  Will be making again.

Quite good. I have also used Marsala wine which pairs well with other Italian dishes. (3T dry white wine, 1T Marsala) Thanks for sharing your recipe. It's a hit.

Delicious!  I usually saute mushrooms with  red wine but I was out and decided to give this recipe a whirl as I did have the white wine on hand.  So glad I did.  I just winged it on the herbs using my own judgment and it was perfect.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe Junebuff1.

They were ok. Nothing fabulous. I might have cooked mine a bit too long as there was no "sauce". Nobody went back for seconds. Will use leftovers in something else. Used baby Bella's.

I followed the recipe.  It was way too garlicky for everyone in my family. You couldn't taste the mushrooms or the white wine, just garlic.  Not doing this one again.

We enjoyed this recipe. I made a couple of changes because I didn't have all the ingredients in stock. I used red wine instead of white wine and it was still tasty. I added onions to bulk it up since I didn't have enough mushrooms (used baby bella), and I used basil, oregano, and black pepper since I didn't have italian seasoning. I found mine took longer to cook than what was stated on the recipe, but the family liked it. I would make it again.

Super fantastic.  I used white wine vinegar because that's all I had, but oh so good.  I made it again for lunch with other veg and I'm going to make it again with veg and fish.  Yum.

I hate, HATE mushrooms but after trying this recipe I have developed a liking for mushrooms. Next time I cook this recipe, i'll cut the shrooms in half. Also, I added a little bit of fresh Rosemary to this one and it came out superb! Very good! Very tastey!!

Followed a reviewer's suggestion and added a little less than a tablespoon of butter towards the end, and I think I actually used a little more wine than called for and let it cook down... So delicious!!

My BF really liked this; I thought it good but not something I'd necessarily make again.  It wasn't bad, but the 1 lb. of shrooms is fairly expensive for a a bit-better- than-mediocre side dish for two people.

Delicious! EXACTLY what I was hoping for! I found baby button mushrooms in the store which were perfect for this recipe. I premade these shrooms, halving the recipe and following it to a t, and stuck them in the fridge till right before dinner time. I heated them up on the stove, letting the water that had accumulated from condensation boil off. I also sprinkled these with both parsely and chives. Absolutely fantastic!

This is simply delicious.  I have made these mushrooms so many times that I don't need to check AllRecipes to make sure I'm doing things right (I am a novice in the kitchen).  Everyone I've served them to has loved them! I don't have Italian seasoning, so I've never used it, but it is delicious without!

These are delicious and easy. I personally added more garlic and wine because my plan was to pour the mushrooms over some baked chicken, and I wanted the flavor to be strong enough. It turned out great!

This was good.  I used two tablespoons of oil and I seasoned with sea salt and pepper.  My guests loved this!

Fantastic dish!  Restaurant quality!!  I added 1/8 tsp. salt and 1/8 tsp. pepper.  These were wonderful with the "Grilled Swordfish with Rosemary" recipe on this site.  Thanks for sharing!

We love mushrooms in my family so I am always looking for new ways to prepare them...this is hands down, my favorite.  I used a light chardonnay and they look really elegant too!

YUM!  We happen to love mushrooms and made these tonight alongside Marinated Flank Steak (from allrecipes) and a green salad.  I didn't have italian seasoning, so just used some dried oregano and basil and aslo didn't have chives.  Nonetheless, they were so easy and sooo good!  Would be even better using a mixture of mushrooms such as cremini, portobellos, yummy!  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent - no white wine so I used red wine and a splash of balsamic. As I've aged I've come to enjoy raw mushrooms "as is" but these are my partner's favorite high on my list, too!

Smelled very nice cooking, and tasted pretty good too. I served these along a vegetarian nut roast, with tomato sauce.

I think maybe a pinch of sugar, or using a sweeter white wine will greatly improve the flavour, as i thought the mushrooms had a slight hint of bitterness to them

I did these things differently: i used some dried thyme instead of the italian seasoning, and chopped purple basil instead of the chives.

Thanks for sharing xx

Both my husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I made it exactly as written.  I think I may have cooked the mushrooms too fast and they dried out a bit - but the recipe has potential. I've added it to my recipe box and will  be trying this again.

I thought this sounded a little better than it came out for us.  After we put in the wine, the mushrooms began to release a lot of water, making it difficult to get the wine to evaporate down much.  We're pretty experienced cooks, but not so much with mushrooms by themselves, so it very well could have been our error.  We may try again!  It was still good.

These mushrooms are great, even cold the next day. I used portobello mushrooms. I served it with Scallop Scampi(from this website), and the mushrooms made the meal. These are great alone, but the really compliment a variety of dishes that would otherwise only be so-so.

Simple to prepare. I used an olive oil/butter combination to saute the mushrooms. Added more garlic than called for.
