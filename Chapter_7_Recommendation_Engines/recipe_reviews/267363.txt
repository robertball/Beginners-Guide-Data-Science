I happen to like these chia seed puddings and this one did not disappoint. The fact that it had chocolate made it even more yummy. I did add a bit more honey just because I like my puddings a bit sweeter.

This was great and so healthy! I didn't have any chia seeds but it worked out without them. Great taste and such a great way to use Carnation Instant Breakfast packets! Will make again.

I made it as recipe said and was amazed at how great this was.  My daughter loved it and was shocked that there was avocado in it as well as the Carnation Instant Breakfast.  A quick and delicious desert.

Breakfast with an avocado? Just try it! This was awesome! It tastes just like chocolate pudding. You can make this a few hours ahead and it will hold nicely in the fridge. I did add extra honey myself for extra sweetness. 5 stars for sure!
