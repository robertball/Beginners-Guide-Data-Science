Great Snack!! Important Note: For those of you who live in communities that also have bugs (roaches), PLEASE use purchased brown paper bags that come in sealed plastic wrap. Most grocerey stores and markets use chemically treated (pesticides) bags in packing groceries to ward off roachs. You do NOT want to cook you popcorn in these treated bags!!!

OMG - What a great recipe! This is so simple and so easy yet tastes so good! I've tried it with the olive oil (a little melted butter works great too), just watch your microwave times as everyone's microwaves are different. The possibilites are endless in terms of seasonings you can but on top - I've also kept it simple and light and just used butter spray! This is a great snack especially when you just want a little something to munch on... Definitely won't be going back to the pre-packaged stuff, sorry Mr. Redenbacher!

Yes, this is less expensive and healthier than the premade microwave popcorn bags and uses less oil than if popping on the stove. With this paper bag method you must be take care with the details & pay attention, in order to get a good final product and for safety. This paper bag method is best for small batches only, 1-2 servings. Use the brown paper lunch bags that come in a pack of 50-100 or so.   Fold the 2 open ends together and over 2-3 times, make two little vertical tears in the folded portion, to create a small tab.  Fold the tab over and this helps keep the bag closed.  Watch the popping carefully the first few times, till you get the hang of the amount of time needed, the power of your microwave, etc.  Once the popping slows to near stop, stop cooking immediately or it will burn or could start a fire. Some kernels will remain unpopped. Longer cooking may pop the rest, but will burn some of the already-popped kernels, so it is not recommended.  Use caution when opening the finished bag as the hot steam can cause burns.  Children should always be supervised by adults for this paper bag cooking method.  I pour the popped corn into a bowl, drizzle with oil, sprinkle with salt, and then mix around.  Garlic olive oil and finely grated parmesan cheese is a tasty topping.

So yummy! Classic way to prepare homemade popcorn! I just added lots of butter (I'm crazy for buttered popcorn) and there! Simply delicious. I also love how this recipe has olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Olive oil has such a nice flavor and adds GREAT to the popcorn!

No mess ... very economical to make and bags can be reused at least one other time depending what you add or don't add to your popcorn ... much healthier than commericial microwave popcorn because there are no artificial ingredients and the size was just right for a snack. Without any seasoning it taste like air-popped corn. I used a 10x5 brown bag and it was perfect. You have to be cautious when judging the time because you don't want to burn the popcorn that has already popped but you don't want too many "old maids" left behind. Every microwave is a little different but once you know your microwave's time it's a cinch!

I haven't tried the microwave technique yet so my rating is just for the olive oil/salt topping. It was a tasty, healthy alternative to butter. I'll use this regularly from now on.

This is a fantastic! The seasoning possibilities are endless: chilli powder, paprika, black pepper, lemon pepper, finely ground dill, whatever you like! The olive makes the flavour much richer and sophisticated than the microwave popcorn you purchase from the store.

This works very well without the oil - just put popcorn in the bag and microwave it.  A little spray butter and a shake of kettle corn seasoning!

this recipe rules!  i put it in my microwave for 2 min. 10 seconds and its perfect every time.  Make sure you put the kernels and salt in first then sprinkle the oil over it or it will burn and the bag soaks up all of the oil.

Well, I don't know how to rate this recipe.  The popcorn was popping, but I guess I should have known not to put the popcorn in a paper grocery bag that had print on it.  As I took the bag out of the microwave, the bag caught on fire.  If I try it again, I'll make sure it's a regular lunch paper bag.

It doesn't get any easier then this.  My husband didn't think it was going to work and then said "why have we spent all this money on popcorn over the years."  Thanks for sharing.

Absolutely perfect for a light snack. I wanted something quick to munch on but I didn't want a huge mess or a lot of clean up. This was just what I needed--thanks!

So simple and no mess.  I used a brown lunch bag and it took 2 minutes and 30 seconds in our microwave.  A great method if you just want a small batch of popcorn.  I also used this method to make 'Garlic Bread Popcorn' and 'Sriracha-Lime Popcorn' both from AR.

No bag necessary! Just a large bowl and a plate over it worked for me. Couldent find a recepie for that so winging it off of the side of the container we came up with the same result, just with a ceramic bowl that will be HOT. Good stuff, skip the bag hunt and go for it!

So so simple... I don't know why anyone would ever spend money on microwave popcorn ever... This method is so easy and you don't have all the oils so it is super super healthy... even like it plain without drizzling it with the oil... super cheap and super healthy snacks....

I love it so much that I got a special silicone 'microwave popper' to make it in!  Add other seasonings, too, like lemon pepper, Italian seasoning with a bit of parmesan cheese, chili powder, 5 spice powder, or nutritional yeast. My Husband's favorite is to add5 spice powder with a little powdered wasabi. To make it more like theatre popcorn, substitute virgin coconut oil for the olive oil!

Only way to make popcorn! And you can add whatever spices you like to customize  it to your tastes. Perfect! Make sure you have plain paper bags. Any kind of print WILL make a difference!
