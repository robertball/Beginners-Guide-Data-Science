It was perfect exactly as written, and I rarely think that. If I had wanted to add buttermilk and seeds and other junk I would not have looked for EASY coleslaw dressing. My husband loved it. He said, "now this is good slaw dressing".

This is exactly what it claims to be including the fact that you probably have the ingredients on hand. Easy, quick and tastes good.  And again, please do not rate a recipe to which you've made modifications. It's not accurate to do so. I realize it's much easier to post your comment with a rating based on your modifications, but it's simply not right and chokes up the comments, making it more laborious to find a true and accurate rating and review. Get off your duff, write and submit your OWN recipe.

Perfect! just the traditional taste one wants.   if you are doing something different to it, IT IS NOT THIS RECIPE!  Only a jerk  would rate this a 3 star and then proclaim their version a 10 star!

I rated this as a 3 because it is good, however by adding 1 tablespoon of honey, 2 tablespoons of buttermilk, 1 tbsp. of horseradish w/mustard, and a few shakes of celery seed this makes it 10 stars! Rest assured though if you don't have buttermilk,celery seed,or honey, it still would serve the purpose.

I rated it a 5 because I made it exactly as the recipe said.  It was great.  We ate it as a side as well as on a bun of  BBQ pulled chicken.  Really good both ways. If I had changed the recipe up, I wouldn't be rating this particular recipe.

This is a very good basic coleslaw dressing, not too goopy. For one medium bowl of coleslaw, use this recipe at 9 servings, with half a head of finely sliced green cabbage and 2-3 grated carrots.

Super yummy! I made it as is (with a little extra salt by accident) and it was great. I mixed it into a 14oz bag of coleslaw mix and it wasn't too runny or dry. I was afraid it would be too peppery because I'm not a fan of pepper, but it was well balanced. 
On my 2nd helping, I sprinkled a little celery seed on top (because I had some & I love that stuff!) and I liked it even better. 
Still, this recipe is great exactly as is and I appreciate that the recipe uses totally normal ingredients every regular cook would have on hand. 
Definitely making this again.

I made this several times already, but the first time I made it for my sons graduation party as a side dish. I shredded a whole head of cabbage and 4 medium size carrots. Prepared dressing exactly as stated the day before in frig, using white vinagar, but adjusted servings for 20. Kept dressing in separate container until I was ready to serve. WOW was so good and some of my guests would not leave party till they had the copy of recipe in hands when they left.  There was none left and this wasn't the only side dish made. I think the key was making dressing the day before and letting the flavors intensify overnight. Loved that it was simple and didn't need to buy anything to make this.

I went to buy coleslaw dressing at the store and it was almost $4!  I thought...this can't be that hard to make myself and it won't have all the artificial chemicals in it.  I found this recipe and it was sooooo easy.  Already had all the ingredients and took only 3 min to make.  Will never buy pre-made again! :0)

I made this for a school soccer team BBQ event.  People were raving about the coleslaw.  I purchased the pre-chopped slaw bags at Sam's Club and made large batches of the dressing right before the event.  It took 10 minutes.  I couldn't believe how many people were asking for the recipe.

Made exactly as written. This one will fool you. You have to whip the dressing together and let it sit for 15-30 minutes before you taste it. If not, you'll panic thinking that it needs sugar/salt/vinegar/etc. Just follow the recipe, wait for a bit, then taste it. It's perfectly balanced and my coleslaw was a hit! I served it at a church dinner along with pinto beans and cornbread. This would be a great coleslaw to serve on a hotdog or a bbq sandwich. Just the right amount of salty and sweet together. Try it. You won't be sorry!

This is excellent. I've made it many times since first using it June 25, 2016. Just the right amount of all the ingredients, I haven't changed a thing. Much better than any store bought dressing.

A perfect blend of sweet and tart! The only change I made was I used Apple cider vinegar. We loved it and will definitely make it again.

In my opinion, this is forks down the best coleslaw dressing!  I'm  comparing it to the many restaurants, corner diners, church pot lucks, and gourmet retail shops I have eaten and bought in for the last 50 years. Well done!  I've made it one of my MeMaw's Favorites!  BTW, MeMaw's Favorites is a highly respected place to be in our foodie family dynamics.  Welcome to the Fam!

First of all, to everyone bashing those who write honest reviews and make suggestions based on their own experiences, and go so far as to call people who do this jerks... get over yourselves. I like this recipe exactly as written and thanks to those who have made suggestions,  I have also tried it a few other variations which have all been just as good. Thanks for the recipe and the reviews!

This was amazing. I used lime juice instead of lemon because it's what I had, and added additional sugar because I like it a little sweeter. But it is absolutely delicious and not heavy like my old recipe.  My new go-to favorite!

No changes necessary; this is a perfect Southern style cole slaw. We all loved it, even my five year old, which is a small miracle in itself! Thank you for a great new staple recipe.

I was taught to make a similar dressing  60 years ago by a Jewish lady & it goes this way (no measuring - depends on amount of coleslaw you are doing) - Miracle Whip, 1-2 Tbsp. sugar, cider vinegar! thats it!   stir the sugar and mayo together....add vinegar a little at a time while mixing..... when it becomes creamy enough to ooze off the spoon & a 'taste' on the tongue has a 'tang' - it's ready.  Pour over coleslaw and mix well. Refrigerate for a couple of hours!  Easy & delish!

Excellent and easy. I did add about a tablespoon or more of dried onion. Adds quite a bit to the flavor. Also, you can adjust thickness with milk or cream.  Switching up the type of vinegar you use has a huge impact. I used both white wine vinegar, which is quite mild, and apple cider vinegar which will punch it up a bit. We are dieting, so I used fat free mayo, it worked perfectly! I will make this again for sure.

Love this coleslaw. Haven't eaten this much cabbage in my life. I am wierd about prepared foods so use 4 carrots and 1 head of cabbage in the food processor. Tripling the recipe makes just the right amount of dressing. However you make your slaw mix this dressing is great.

Very basic recipe that is perfect to add your own twist too. Some cilantro, cumin, lime instead of lemon and you have Mexican style. Ginger, soy, garlic, sesame oil, and you have Asian slaw. You can also use honey, pineapple juice or agave to sweeten. This is the Swiss Army knife of slaw dressing

3 23-2017 Delicious, very easy coleslaw dressing that uses ingredients I always have! I add this dressing to about half of a 16 oz. bag of coleslaw mix.

Modified just a bit - added some celery seed, upped the amount of black pepper, replaced sugar with Splenda (and reduced the overall ratio), used light mayo and added a bit more,  added a bit more lemon juice, and used apple cider vinegar instead of regular vinegar  (again adding a bit more than recommended in the recipe).  Turned out great with just the right amount of tang and spice!

I was in need of a basic coleslaw dressing and this fit the bill perfectly. I added a tiny amount of celery seed and some garlic powder but otherwise, stuck to the recipe. :o)

Good basic recipe, but I like sweet Southern slaw so added poppy seeds, replaced lemon juice with veggie oil, and added chopped onion.  Perfection!

the local fish night meal side dishes are catered but were shorted this time and I was asked to help by making coleslaw.  I picked up the mix at the warehouse store and then found this recipe.  EVERYONE loved it.  They have asked for me to make it every time now as it is so much better than the one they had catered in.  They ran out and I didn't even get to taste it !!!

Yes, it’s simple and very good! I’ve made it as written several times. My daughter and I are the only ones in the family that like coleslaw so I usually halve the recipe. This dressing is just the balance of sweet and tangy that we like. I think it tastes best if I let it sit in the bowl for 20 minutes or so to let the flavors meld. Then I toss it with half a bag of slaw for a simple and fast side to grilled chicken or fish and chips.

Great easy recipe. For those folks giving it 1-2 stars because it didn't include honey, seeds, horseradish, etc, either find another recipe that includes the ingredients that you want, or make your own recipe. This is a basic dressing and is good on
 its own. If you want to add additional ingredients then do so, but giving this a low rating is ridiculous.

I did use Splenda instead of sugar, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. This is the best slaw dressing I've ever tasted, hands down. It's just enough for half a head of cabbage....I also threw about 10 quartered strawberries to the entire mix. Wonderful!

I bought a head of cabbage by mistake...don't ask. In any event I don't like cooked cabbage much so I decided on coleslaw but I didn't have the dressing for it. I usually go out and buy the bag of shredded cabbage and buy a coleslaw dressing but really didn't want to go out anymore, I had already spent too much time shopping that day. I looked and looked and found this recipe. I had all the ingredients and  to be honest I wasn't sure it would be good but took the chance from reading the reviews and looking at the star ratings. I am so glad I did. It is easy, I always have the ingredients it called for and it is just as good if not better then any store bought dressing. Making this myself saves me lots of money going forward, I know what I am putting in it and it tastes delicious...you can't go wrong here!

Amazing! I was a little leery about this recipe since I made it with just out of the cupboard ingredients. It did not have very long to get cold in the fridge, so I was not thrilled with it at first. However, let it sit overnight, and--WOW!!! It is definitely a keeper, and one I will do again.

Great recipe and so simple with ingredients I already had.  After reading the reviews, I dared to use a specialty Serrano honey balsamic vinegar.  Everyone loved this.  The saddest part was I had none left over.  Good thing this can be made so quickly!

I've made this before and loved it. This time I made it for a crowd of 24 using 2 - 2# bags of shredded slaw cabbage. I made 4 recipes and it was the perfect amount. I increased the sugar and salt to taste, not a lot more though. I have always bit the bullet and spent the extra money for Marzetti's Slaw Dressing. But now, my family and friends said this is even better. It can't be any easier or inexpensive and be that good.

I was quick and easy to make.  I bought a two pound bag of precut slaw from Sam’s and used about 2/3s of the bag.  The recipe is great as is.  I did add 1 tsp of celery seed just because I love that taste, it made it more like my Mother’s recipe.

This was SPECTACULAR!!!!    But I did cut the sugar by 2/3, cut the mayo by 1/2, but it was still AMAZING!   The combo of the lemon juice and rice vinegar (didn't have regular, only rice and apple cider) made it amazing, you couldn't taste any one ingredient but together it combined to make the best slaw I think I've had.

Only changed sugar to 2 packs of sweet and low (diabetic).  Simply Delicious.  Will not ever buy coleslaw dressing again. My husband loved it  also.

My family and I really liked this dressing. Next time, I might just use 1 tbsp.  lemon juice as it was a little more lemony than I would have hoped.

It's great to have a yummy recipe you can make with ingredients you probably already have.  makes just the right amount for 16 oz. packaged shredded cabbage mix.  loved this!  next time I might add a little creamed horseradish just to change it up.  thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! I have never made my own coleslaw dressing and in the back of my mind I kept thinking KFC coleslaw because its all I had to compare to. Well it is very flavorful and not too gloopy, I think it tastes better if you let it sit an hour or so, but its good either way ??

Rave reviews on the coleslaw dressing.  Many people at our party today mentioned how much they they loved the coleslaw dressing!  It has multiple levels of flavor with the sweetness of the sugar, the tartness of the lemon and vinegar, and the unusual addition of the black pepper.

Never would've thought I would rate and save a cole slaw recipe, but this quick and easy dressing made the best coleslaw I've ever had. I used apple cider vinegar and a little more than half a bag of pre-shredded cabbage mix - perfection!

I chose this recipe because the ingredients are staples in my kitchen & it's so much less fattening then some of the other recipes. I used apple cider vinegar & because I had it on hand, added some lemon peel.  Perfect!

I'm honestly surprised that more reviews don't mention how tart/tangy this is from the lemon juice! In my opinion it was too overpowering. My suggestion would be to use only have of what it calls for, or leave it out altogether.

Wayyy too sweet for us, tried only 1tblsp sugar on the second time and it's much better. If you don't like coleslaw super sweet, I'd recommend adding a bit of sugar and tasting before using the full 2tblsp.

Made this for my boyfriend, who loves a juicy coleslaw, so I only mixed in 8oz of coleslaw veggies. I also substituted like for lemon and used white basalmic vinegar. He said it was "da bomb".

This is a good recipe to start off with. It is great with how it is or easy to add to if wanted but not necessary.

Quick, easy and tasty. Not a lot of ingredients, and they are not needed. Have made several times. Last time I made it I substituted pickle juice for the lemon juice, since my daughter ran out of the lemon juice.

Simple and wonderful! I used Miracle Whip instead of  regular mayo, so I doubled the vinegar because MW has less tang than regular mayo I think.

Wonderfully, perfectly typical coleslaw. Personally I just use one tbs of lemon juice, but you cannot go wrong with this recipe. I bring it for every office party bc it’s a great side, or excellent to top a burger or bbq - which is usually what our office parties have. Everyone loves it and I no longer have to worry about what I’m bringing or how much money is in the bank account.

Made as written except I used apple cider vinegar. I thought it was a little too sour, like it had too much acid. Also, I was not sure how much cabbage I needed for this recipe. I ended up using half of a 16 oz bag of slaw.

LOVED this, and loved even more how easy it was! I didn't have regular white vinegar, so I hoped and prayed Apple Cider Vinegar would work fine, and it totally did. Keeping this recipe in my back pocket for sure!

I made this twice this week. My boyfriend loves it. I did add a bit more sugar because we like it a bit more on the sweet side, but it's a perfect recipe as is. It doesn't need 3 million more ingredients added to it. That's why I looked for a simple slaw recipe.  I didn't want something complex on the palette. Plus they are all ingredients you would truly have on hand.

I’ve tried several cole slaw recipes on this site and this is my favorite! It won’t lOne recipe was perfect for a bag of cole slaw mix from target.  I think I’ll need to double the recipe for the sam’s club size mix.

Totally awesome. I did add a splash of buttermilk per some of the comments- but I don’t think it added to OR took away from the fantastic easy recipe. Excellent flavors.

Easy and delicious! I used Monk fruit sweetener instead of sugar and for vinegar I used a white balsamic vinegar. I’m super picky about coleslaw and this was amazing right from the start. I’m a Plant Paradox follower and will try this using avocado mayo next time.

Good but not like a traditional coleslaw taste.  It will do in a pinch if you don’t have all the right ingredients.

Nice recipe. Nothing out of the ordinary, but was tasty and easy to make. I substituted 1 T of stevia powder for the white sugar.

I hate grocery store pre-made coleslaw. It tastes bitter and terrible, and I’d rather just not. This recipe was quick and easy, and it can be made with simple things that most people have on-hand. I did add a bit more salt, but other than that, I made it per the recipe and used a bag of ore-shredded cabbage and carrots. Great compliment for our barbecue sandwiches.

My go to for coleslaw. Easy and tasted just like any store bought. I did need to add about a tablespoon more of mayonnaise to moisten it up more.

This coleslaw dressing was a huge hit with the family for Thanksgiving dinner. I made a slight change, I decreased the amount of sugar to 1/8 tsp., since my family doesn't care for sweet slaw.

Love it. Made it just as written. I didn’t have a full package of the coleslaw mix, because we used some for something else. So, I made the sauce and then just added as much as I need it for the right amount for the coleslaw mix.. Will make again for sure.

It was so easy, with ingredients most of us have. A bit tart for my taste, so I'll adjust a bit next time. It's a nice small amount too. No more need to buy coleslaw dressing - thanks!

Great coleslaw dressing, have made it a few times already. I do lessen the amount of sugar because it's a little too sweet, and do add a little more salt and pepper.

i think the lemon juice didn't help this recipe.  I added more ingredients to eliminate the off balance taste before taking this slaw to a fish fry.

I made this exactly as written. I’ve tried many Cole slaw dressings and my husband never like any of them, but this one he said was a keeper! It’s so simple, delicious and creamy.

I had great reviews from this when i made it fora party. 
I tweaked it a tad and added half again as much sugar and vinegar to mask the flavor of the mayo.

This is Amazing, and simple! I used everything organic for the recipe, my sugar wasn't white but it didn't matter. I used Rice vinegar because it adds a little something and I love it! My 7 year old son even loves it. This one's going in the recipe box!!!!

This recipe tastes just like the dressing I used to make at a restaurant. I did however use apple cider vinegar instead of white, and added turmeric, cumin, ginger and a little Cajun spice. But the recipe as it’s listed was fabulous.

I made it, had to double it, but very good and exactly right, it is easy and with ingredients that I already had. Much better than the store brand premade coleslaw.

The name fits... This was definitelybeasy.  It was good, but a tad too sweet for our tastes.  The "Restaurant Style Coleslaw" recipe (on this site) remains my favorite.

Some people don't care for pepper and I felt it was too peppery. That being said my husband really enjoyed it (but he loves pepper).  If you are like me and are not a big pepper fan you will want to reduce the pepper. Other than that it was decent for a savory coleslaw.

This was just what I needed! Simple, yet tasty. I didn’t have any lemon juice on hand, but the recipe worked well even without it. I’m sure I’ll refer back to it in the future. Thanks for sharing!

Simple ingredients and is wonderful. Really enjoyed the flavor of this dressing. Adjust accordingly if you want it on the sweet side or more of a vinegar taste. I cheated and just bought the coleslaw mix in the bag from the grocery store. Used this dressing and had a perfect coleslaw salad. Put some on my pulled pork sandwich for a little crunch.

Thanks for your recipe. I decided to cut down the amount of sugar so I only used 1 tbsp of lemon juice, 1 tbsp of sugar, no vinegar and the rest of ingredients as per your recipe and it turned out good. I’ve made it 4-5 times already and my family loves it.

We’ve made it twice this week!  We acquired a big head of cabbage!  We added chopped red onion and shredded carrots, too.  Before serving we sprinkle salted sunflower seeds and Craisins  for color.  So easy to make and we had all of the ingredients.  I will never purchase Coleslaw Dressing again!!!  This is DELICIOUS!

The BEST Dressing for coleslaw I've ever made/had!  I cheated and used an 8 ounce bag of Dole mixed coleslaw.  It was better than store bought! 

Thanks for sharing this EASY delicious recipe, it's a keeper!

Very good recipe, however, I found it was perfectly sweet using only 1 Tablespoon of sugar rather than the two that were suggested. But overall I was pleasantly surprised that I liked it, because I don't normally care for coleslaw!

I like the fact this recipe  way very easy.  However,  it had  way to much lemon juice and pepper.  If I try it again I will cut back on those two ingredients.

Perfect as written. I've made this a few times and it's a big hit. I have added poppy seeds to give it a nutty hint. Thanx for such an easy, tasty recipe. So much better than anything store bought.

Just mixed it and can’t stop eating it! Can’t imagine it getting any better after sitting. 
I did add some djon mustard but that is the only addition.

I just made this for the first time, and the hubby, who simply loves coleslaw, gave it two thumbs up! I doubled the recipe and used a little over half on a bag of tri-colored coleslaw mix, and the rest of it on a bag of Super Blend, and both came out great I did lighten it up a bit, I used Hellmann's Light mayo and replaced the sugar with Truvia Baking Blend, which lowered the calories to 50! Thanks so much for sharing this one with us, GarlicQueen, it is definitely a keeper! And it's exactly what it's name states... and easy coleslaw recipe!

I made this dressing as the recipe states... it is the very best... I get raves  on my coleslaw.  I usually double or triple the recipe as needed for the quantity of coleslaw I am making.

It is a good basic coleslaw dressing.  I always go easy on the sugar and add celery seed.

This was SO good that we ate the entire thing with dinner (and 3 of my 4 kids loved it too - THAT is a true miracle!). I've already made a second batch to take with a meal for a friend tomorrow! Made exactly as is!! Perfect amount for a 14 oz bag of slaw!

I quadrupled the ingredients and added it to a whole cabbage and 3 large carrots and I added it to my lunch plate.  I received orders for extra side orders of coleslaw!

OMG!  This is how I used to make it before I started using packaged (for convenience).  Never again because this is so easy and I always have the ingredients!  Thanks!  I make it in batches now since there are only two of us.

Wayyy to sour for my liking... and I didn’t even add all the lemon juice and NO vinegar.
I like raisins in it so I added that to sweeten it up a little bit.

I had some leftover cabbage and used this dressing on it.  Very good balance of flavors; definitely making it again, though with a bit less pepper.

This is a great very basic recipe. I left out the sugar because we don't like sweet slaw. Later we were looking for more of a New York deli taste, so I added some celery salt and celery seed, and voila! Coleslaw like in NYC!

As a general rule I view recipes as a guide line. Not this one! I would not change 1 thing!! This is awesome and simple.  My  only problem was with the prep time.  It took me 25 minutes.  15 to find my black pepper and 10 to mix it up.  Lol thanks for sharing.

So easy...and so good!!  We do a lot of cookouts in the summer, and this beats any coleslaw we bought or made in the past hands down!  I even have a couple of people that beg me to make it every time they come over, and that is about (3) times a week.

I used lime juice because: a) I only had limes and b) this was made to accompany pulled pork and cilantro...so I thought lime would work just fine. It did! Delicious. And I don't even like cole slaw usually.

Very easy and good. I used a 16 oz bag of slaw mix so I actually made a recipe plus 1/2 to give it a bit more dressing. I made as written except I added a little bit of celery salt. It was perfect.

Since I don't like it as sweet I changed it slightly. I used one less tablespoon of sugar then added a tablespoon of of yellow mustard, teaspoon of fresh grated horseradish, and two teaspoons of fresh dill. turned out great!

Awesome and easy. I substituted Erythritol for the sugar one-to-one. I also added a squirt of Dijon mustard. 
 It's great!  I'll make this a lot now. Thanks.

Super easy recipe with items most have in pantry! Love some suggestions for add ons, but perfect as is for the classic slaw taste I was going for. Will try some alterations for something different another time!

A great base for a simple coleslaw! I used raw apple cider vinegar, and it add a nice layer of flavor to an already great recipe!

This is my go to for cole slaw. Store bought just does not cut it now! We are low carb, so I use 3 packets of Truvia in place of sugar. I also add a little coriander and onion powder (maybe 1/4 tsp each or a little less), although it is also FINE without these (hence the 5 stars).  For the slaw I use 1 sm head or 1/2 lg head purple cabbage, 1 or 2 carrots. That's it! We use it as a side and then the leftovers go on "sandwiches" (rollups or low carb wraps) - especially good on pastrami.

So good! I used this on my keto diet and omitted all sugar or sweetener, just for my own benefit. It is totally amazing and will be my go to slaw dressing. In fact, it's so good I might even use it for dipping sauce for crudites. The lemon elevates this dressing to the next level. Well done!

I will definitely make this again and again! It is extremely easy to make, and really does use what you have in the kitchen. 
I did make a couple of changes to it. I usually use Sugar In The Raw, so I used that instead of white sugar. I also have Cranberry Orange salt blend, and I used that instead of regular salt. It has a somewhat coarse grind, so it did take a little extra whisking, but a little goes a long way and I can use a bit less than the recipe calls for. And the last change I made, was that I cut the mayonnaise down some, because I have a family member who doesn't like a lot of mayonnaise. I made up the moisture by mixing in some Creamy Cucumber Dill Vidalia Onion dressing. My dad likes dill in his coleslaw, and it seemed like a good compromise all around. The salt and the dressing are both made here in my local Southcoast area, so I usually have them on hand. It turned out great, so the recipe is super easy, and just as easy to customize!

Amazing. Easy. I made the dressing exactly as it was and added about half of a head shredded. It was probably 5 cups of cabbage. Then I shredded half a carrot with the cheese grater. It seemed like a good total amount… I don’t like wet soggy coleslaw. After two hours there was still dressing sitting in the bowl so I added even more shredded cabbage. This was awesome! It “dressed” a lot of shredded cabbage!

I like this recipe cause its easy!  I made it my own by using light mayo ( I doubled this  recipe to take to a party!) I only added 1 1/2 tbsp sugar,  added 1 1/2 celery seeds and more vinegar to taste!  I like my coleslaw tangy.  I refrigerated it over night before  
adding the extra vinegar just make sure it wasn't too tangy.

I would suggest to let it sit in the fridge for minimum  30 minutes prior to serving.

Good base, but slaw recipes are so personal there are probably 330 million of them. If you like your with a little more bite, halve the amount of sugar and double the amount of vinegar. We also doubled the salt, and used Trader Joe’s Organic Mayonnaise, which is not quite as sweet as Kraft or Helmann’s.

Most delicious coleslaw ever!!!   I added a little less lemon juice and only 1 Tablespoon of sugar, to make room for about 3 Tablespoons of pineapple juice, and maybe more like 3/4 cup mayo.  (I had a very large head of cabbage.)   Also put pineapple tidbits in the slaw and some shredded carrot as well.  Oh my, I could eat this daily!!!

Perfect exactly as-is. Not too sweet, not too sour, not too thick, not too thin. I mixed it with 8oz of packaged shredded coleslaw mix.  It was all covered and moist, but not too dressing-heavy.

This was easy and we all have the ingredients. Much better then throwing away 1/2 a bottle of old dressing.  I cutback the sugar because I found it a bit sweet.

I used apple cider vinegar because that was what I found  in the pantry -- otherwise I followed the recipe as written .  This turned out great with the ingredients I had on hand (and I have to admit, the head of cabbage in my boyfriend's refrigerator was not on the most-recently-bought-cabbage-list).    I am sure all the variations are great, too, so enjoy those (as I enjoyed looking at them)!   Thank you for the recipe!

I really love this easy coleslaw dressing recipe. It's always a hit in my house. I make it year round since my picky eating daughter  loves it so much and always requests it. I make it exactly how it is. No need to adjust perfection. :)

Easy to make. I used stevia and xylitol in place of the sugar and omitted the lemon juice since I didn't have any. Also I refrigerated my slaw for about an hour before serving. Will definitely make again.

PERFECT. It states EXACTLY what it is.....and it is EASY!
My wife is a coleslaw junkie and she LOVED it.
Kudos for sharing, sometimes simple is just perfect.
If you're looking for something as an easy delicious "go-to" (and a crowd pleaser), this is it. In a hurry because you've been doing a low and slow on the BGE all day? Yep.....this is for you.
There are plenty of excellent slaw recipes on this sight but they take time.
This one is a super excellent no brainer.

This is absolutely perfect as is. My family likes a bit of kick, so after making the original and tasting it, I did add a bit of horseradish and Dijon mustard. HOWEVER, if I were making for a group, I would make exactly as written. Restaurants and salad dressing makers wish their dressings tasted this fresh and tangy. And so quick and easy to make.

Classic slaw taste that everyone loved!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and it came out perfect for our potluck holiday weekend.  This literally took less than 2 minutes to put together and pour over a bag of shredded cabbage.

I made this in quantity for a function. so I tripled it and I used 16 oz bags of precut coleslaw. It came out perfect and everyone loved it! Only thing I did different was to sprinkle some poppyseed on it.

I purchased a bag of coleslaw, thinking that it came with the dressing.  Needless to say, I found myself in need of some homemade dressing.  I chose GarlicQueen's recipe, and I'm glad I did. So tasty!  Just what I look for in coleslaw dressing.

PERFECT AS LONG AS YOU ONLY ADD 1 TEASPOON  (OR 1/2 TEASPOON) OF SUGAR.
FIRST TIME I MADE  IT I NEW I WOULD NOT LIKE SO MUCH SUGAR AND ONLY ADDED ABOUT 3/4 OF A TEASPOON. THIS TIME WITH A HEADACHE,  WASNT THINKING & ADDED THE ENTIRE 2 TABLESPOONS.  I SPENT THE NEXT SEVERAL MINUTES ADDING MORE LEM TO N JUICE, AP.CID. VINEGAR & A TOUCH MAYO & KOSHER SALT TO FIX IT.   THATS A LOT OF TASTE TESTING! ??

l finally found a coleslaw recipe that produces in a fantastic result.  My kids would only eat store bought slaw till this one.  I have used a variety of different types of vinegar, all with good results.  I use coconut sugar and ~3 drops of high quality lemon essential oil.

I'll be making this again! My family loved it.  I think most people will enjoy as is.  I used 3 bags of coleslaw mix (each bag serves 3 &they came w\packets of dressing but I threw them away) and doubled the dressing recipe.  To suit my family's tastes I used 2 finely sliced green onions (green & white portions), fresh lemon juice (1 large lemon), and seasoned rice vinegar. I ended up adding just over a tbsp of vinegar at the end.

When you need quick everyday slaw dressing. This Really is easy and fast. Made it twice to coat 10 cups of pre-shredded slaw mix. Adjust amount to suit your preference on dry or wet coleslaw.

This is excellent as it is, but I used apple cider vinegar, added a little more pepper, some garlic and a touch of cumin for some smokey  flavor. I had to stop myself from eating it all before dinner!! Thanks for this one!!

I really like this dressing, but a little too much pepper for my taste, but I I also added a tablespoon of sour cream.

Loved it!  Had all ingredients on hand except lemon juice so I added 1 tablespoon more of apple cider vinegar and it tasted great.   I will never again buy packaged coleslaw again.

I wanted simple, easy, and delicious. This recipe is perfect exactly as written. I made it and put it over a bag of slaw mix (shredded cabbage). Perfect amount of dressing to make for one bag of slaw. Perfect taste. Took me less than 5 min to make and I had everything on hand to make it. Classic, summer taste.

I love this recipe. I reference it for measurements all the time. I do however never add any sugar or sweetener and instead add that measurement of either spicy mustard or horseradish sauce. It’s just the perfect base recipe for whatever saw sauce you’re trying to make.

I have made this several times, following the recipe EXACTLY, and it is great. Yes, I have also added celery salt, which is good, too. I have also used sugar alternative to make it Keto, and it is good also; however, I am rating this five stars as the author has written it. Yum!

This is a great classic coleslaw recipe. I’ve made it twice following the recipe exactly. It is sweet, so you could probably cut some sugar if you wanted. Using a good processor I shredded a small green cabbage, 4 carrots and chopped 3 green onion, added poppy seed and added a double batch of this recipe. It made a large mixing bowl full and was plenty for a 12 person lunch with leftovers.

I had gotten a bag of cole slaw at the store on sale but had know idea what went into the sauce. As usual I started my search at allrecipes.  Found this one right off  and knew it was the one I wanted. Came out great, will be using this one for ever.

I really love this recipe. The first time i made it, i made it for 3 portions. The second time I wanted to do the same.. i remembered how much mayonnaise i used, but i accidentally used the other ingredients for 6 portions. It turned out amazing! So i will always use now half the mayonnaise. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Perfect to go with my husband's smoke pork shoulder! Shredded 1 large head of cabbage and three large carrots and tripled the recipe.  I add crushed pineapple to my slaw, but would have been delish without!

As advertised--easy, and tasty.  I subbed Miracle Whip (Low Fat) as I didn't have Mayo, and eliminated sugar because the MW is much sweeter than Mayo.  I'm a huge fan of alliums, and wanted to add garlic and onions, but restrained myself this time.  Next--a new recipe:-)

This recipe is perfect as it is.  I repeat, this recipe is PERFECT as it is.

Do NOT add, subtract, substitute, or tweak anything in any way, or it will not taste the way it is supposed to taste.

If you are compelled to change ANYTHING about this recipe, then you are not making this recipe, you are making a different recipe, and should post it as such.

Chose it because it said EASY and I had everything on hand. Tastes great and serves its purpose. Exactly what I needed! If I want to riff off of it later I might, but this will be my go-to basic coleslaw dressing.

Excellent and easy recipe.  I made it according to the directions with a bag of coleslaw mix and it was perfect.  Not too much dressing and not too sweet or vinegary.

Finally, someone not only remembers what good coleslaw tastes like, they're also able to recreate it! I'm from NYC and there's nothing like the coleslaw from a great deli there. This is just like what I grew up eating. I didn't change anything but the amounts depending on how much I needed. So, as long as you can still do basic math, you'll never need another recipe for coleslaw. I can guarantee that! Great job!!!

This is perfect. I love coleslaw, and never thought making it would be so easy. Never buying store bought again. I didn't use exact measurements, but by eyeballing it, and it was great.

Made it exactly as written. Shredded half a head of cabbage and 3 carrots in my food processor,  and stirred in the dressing. It was that easy, and it turned out great. Will definitely make it again.

Too sweet for me, but I substituted an artificial sweetener because I must, following its recommended conversion... 

I think I just prefer a tangier dressing.

It turned out great. A bit sweet for me,  I have cut back on sugar so much, that a lot of stuff tastes too sweet. Will use less next time. But otherwise wonderful.

If I had put in all the sugar it called for it would have been way too sweet. She should specify what kind of vinegar to use and how much cabbage and carrot mixture this is enough for. Too mayonnaisey.

I agree with the commenters who give this 5 stars. Very quick and easy. I mixed this in a measuring cup and drizzled it slowly over pre-bought cabbage and carrots.  Easy peasy weekend addition.

I've been trying to get a coleslaw dressing just right for several years, I guess I was over complicating it. Simple is usually best, in cooking. I made this in about 3 minutes using ingredients as listed with two exceptions: I used apple cider vinegar because it's what I prefer & fresh cracked black pepper for a slight heat. The dressing was tangy, slightly sweet  not too creamy, not too watery and it turned out to be the perfect amount and flavor to dress 10oz of Brussels sprout,napa cabbage,kohlrabi,broccoli,carrot and kale slaw. 
I used the slaw in a bbq pork loin wrap and it was amazing. Husband approved. 

This will be my go to slaw dressing from now on. Thank-you for sharing this!

This is my go to for my pulled pork sandwiches. Quick, easy and sweet just as recipe is written. Perfect addition to the sandwich or as a side.

We love this recipe. It’s always tasty and creamy. Needed to make it vegan so...used Veganaise in place of mayo, also added celery seed and dill. My new favorite way to get a sulphur rich vegan side dish!

I’m also giving this four stars because it doesn’t advise how much coleslaw to use with it. I made one batch for a 14 ounce thing of slaw mix and it was really good but I thought I wanted it a little creamier so I made another batch of sauce and mixed it in. BIG MISTAKE, It was disgusting after that. Good recipe though.

I did make changes...I didn't have the lemon juice, so instead I did 1 tbsp of apple cider vinegar  (and no white vinegar). It was plenty of liquid...in fact, I think the additional tbsp of liquid might've made it too liquidy. I thought the slaw was great!

This is my first review ever here and I've made this multiple times without fail! It is easy and very flavourful, which I love. Only recommendation is that you have to slightly tweak the ingredients to your taste, but outside of that it is simply awesome!

Sure you can dress this dressing up with other ingredients but that's not the point.  This was a super simple dressing made in less then 10 minutes for a bag is pre mixed coleslaw after plan A for a salad didn't work out.  Use it as a simple base or as is.  Would make again.

It was good just tweaked it a little more with ?? pepper grinded a few times and like 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder and little more vinegar to take away  from the sweetness. Just put less sugar.

So easy to make and SO GOOD. Tastes like KFC cole slaw almost. Delicious and it lasts quite a few days in the fridge. Good for meal prep.

I wasn’t crazy about it as a salad dressing but rather than throw it out, I added a couple of teaspoons each of white sugar and honey and used it for a chicken stir fry sauce.  That was very good! Sauté the chicken in the sauce, add veggies, cook all and top with chopped peanuts.

This recipe was so good it made my picky anti veggie  husband shovel coleslaw into his mouth.  I didn't put in lemon juice in as I didn't have lemons. We also used a small bag of cabbage mix that was prepackaged.

This dressing recipe is really awesome. We adjust it a bit and use half mayonnaise and half baconnaise (yes its a real thing, we order it from Amazon of course) and also use cider vinegar instead of white vinegar, adds just a bit more zing

We have always picked up the bottled dressing-this was much better and you have control of the amount of sugar.

Was making some slaw for some hot dogs and pulled pork sandwiches. I picked this recipe I had most of the ingredients on hand with the exception of the lemon juice all I had key lime didn't feel like going to the store. I thought it came out pretty good might of been a little more tart for some with the key lime juice but I love keylime so I thought it was pretty good . No problem making this again.

This is our family's favorite coleslaw recipe! Perfect amount of each ingredient, I never alter it at all...the only thing I do (quite often) is double it to meet supply and demand, and even that keeps us wanting more!

Really good. A little tangy, which is fantastic with bbq. I used a 16 ounce bag of chopped cole slaw mix. ??

I made this recipe exactly as written and it is perfect. Just the right amount of creamy and sweet and spicy and tangy. I mixed it with a 16oz bag of prepared slaw mix and it didn't cover the slaw mix as much as I wanted but that's okay - I can just make more of the dressing!

I added heavy cream to make the  dressing more creamy.  Just a tablespoon or two.  I also  added some chopped green and red onion.  Also a a little chopped apples.  The basis for  the dressing is good but I  cut down the  sugar for a more tart taste.

I’ve made this so many times for parties and potlucks and I always get so many compliments even from people who don’t usually like coleslaw. Also I have used key limes for his recipe too and like it better that way but either one works. Highly recommend this recipe!

Just came back from a pot luck with cole slaw and this recipe.  People raved and begged for the recipe.  I live in Guatemala, and we eat a lot of cabbage here, but no one had eaten it with this kind of dressing.  I was reminded about the next pot luck and told I would be welcome to bring it again.  Good to know!!

This is a great baseline sauce recipe for anyone. Just for my own tastes, I added some brown mustard, extra pepper, and would probably have used less sugar, but this is still a great familiar-tasting cole slaw sauce.

This is a perfect  traditional dressing that you will like and is better than any of the store bought dressings . If you are adding to it or changing anything than it is not this receipe. Who ever rated this a 3 star and then proclaim their version is a 10 star  has no ideal how to follow directions  or is Nanarcissist! Horse Radish belong in cotail sauce not cole slaw dressing.

This is perfect!  Super simple and I usually have all these ingredients in my kitchen.  Today I didn't have any lemon juice but I squeezed some orange instead and it was brilliant.

I found this on the fly when I opened what I thought was a coke slaw kit, and it was just the chopped cabbages!  I had to make the dressing with just what I had in my kitchen and this was PERFECT!  It was delicious, tasted like something from a recipe and took all of 2 mins to make.

Great easy recipe.  We doubled it so we had leftovers.  It tastes better on the second day after the flavors mingle in the fridge.  16 yr stepson liked it and he never likes coleslaw.

Thank you for this recipe. I tried to make up my own but it was lacking. I had everything needed in the ingredients and I will never use another recipe. Why, when this was just right.  It was crisp, delicious and tangy.

Easy and tasty; but i did add an additional tablespoon of sugar to take the edge off the acidity of the lemon juice/vinegar combination.

So easy to make and so good!! We grew cabbage this year for the first time. Shredded up the cabbage, threw in some shredded carrots and poured this seriously easy dressing and it was a huge hit!

I'm not a big coleslaw fan, and most store dressings are just WAY too sweet for me. This was delicious and easy, with ingredients I have in my pantry anyway. I did cut the sugar by half (because I don't care for sweet coleslaw), and thought it was GREAT. If you like regular (sweet) coleslaw, make per the recipe. Definitely will make this again.

Perfect! Quick, simple, all ingredients on hand- made recipe as written.  Fresh lemon juice versus bottled added that extra zip needed on the coleslaw topping our pulled pork sandwiches!

I didn't have lemon juice so I used pineapple juice and pineapple and I added some celery seed.

I made this just as written and it was delicious and so easy! When I make it again, I will add a little more salt. Also, as with a lot of salads, this was much better the next day so I would recommend making it the day before you plan to serve it.

I’m not a huge fan of creamy coleslaw but had the ingredients on hand and figured I’d give it a shot. It is fine but not something I need to make again

I hated Cole slaw , with a Passion ... This dressing changed me in one try . I've actually made this dressing at least once a week for the last few month's ; my request. 
1st time :  followed directions was amazing , but I needed something a little different.  
2nd time and every time after I add apple cider vinager and we use agave instead of sugar. 2 TBS when doubling the recipe. 
Thank you for making me love Cole slaw!

Love this recipe exactly as it is. Used with 16oz bag pre-shredded coleslaw (red/green cabbage & carrots). Easy to make with ingredients readily on hand. This one's a keeper.

This is delicious. I made as listed except I added 1 packet of Splenda instead of the sugar. It was perfect. Not too sweet, not too tart. My hubby really liked it too. Definitely will have this again and I want to try on Broccoli Slaw as well. Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

Liked it a lot as-is; but my family enjoys a good "kick", so I added some creamy horseradish, more black pepper, and just a squeeze of spicy dijon mustard. Great both ways!

I had everything on hand except plain vinegar, I used red wine vinegar and still came out very good.  I add a little bit of dressing at a time to the cabbage.  That way it doesn't get too creamy.  We still like to taste the cabbage!!  Great recipe!!

Quick and easy! I found it a bit too mayonnaisey for my tastes so I added 1/3 cup of sour cream and swapped sweet pickle juice in for the vinegar. Worked great.

I love coleslaw, but I usually can't eat it because I'm allergic to raw carrots! I decided to try this website with some thin cut up cabbage to make it myself. I was hesitant because I am not a big fan of mayonaise, but this turned out perfectly! I did let the cabbage and sauce sit overnight in the fridge before eating it, so I don't know if they helped, but I will definitely be trying again (and maybe not waiting to refrigerate because I can't be wait to eat it!)

I followed the exact recipe for this dressing. I mixed it with 1/2 head of cabbage and 3 medium carrots (both shredded in food processor). I had all the ingredients on hand. Very easy to make. Perfect coleslaw!

This is a nice mild not too sweet not too tart salad. 
It's easy enough to adjust sweet or tart by adding  a teaspoon or two of vinegar or sugar. 
I like it fine, hubby sprinkled a dash of sugar on his. 
It's definitely easy!

I have never liked Cole slaw  , one day I wanted  it so I tried this dressing. I am so glad I did. I read the reviews first , thanks y'all ! I now make Cole slaw at least once a week.  
You can add or subtract as our tastes are not all the same with amazing results all the time!

I made this just as is and it was the perfect combo. I dont care for an overly sweet coleslaw so the combo of this recipe with the sweet and tangy was excellent. As another reviewer suggested I made dressing in advance so flavors could get acquainted before adding to cabbage mix. To my cabbage mix I added a bit of diced Vivaldi Sweet onion  and thinly sliced radishes. Wonderful!
Thanks for the recipe!!!

I love this recipe for its tartness! But I also like my coleslaw a little on the sweet side so I add just a bit more sugar. Overall, wonderful recipe! Thanks!

Decent recipe but it's way too sweet as is. I used half of the recommended amount of sugar and it was plenty sweet.

Almost perfect but was just a little sweet for our taste.  Suggestion is to reduce the sugar a little or, if too late, up the vinegar.  The bitterness of some celery leaves in the base slaw also helped us.  Overall, a keeper.

I agree with most of the reviewers here. This is a perfect standard more-tangy-than-sweet coleslaw dressing.  I'm all about the tang.  I used apple cider vinegar, too.

Here was my first review on AllRecipes.  I made this coleslaw dressing. I bought the pre-shredded coleslaw mix at the grocery store. That was a timesaver. The coleslaw dressing was good. It did not knock my socks off, no. But, would I make it again? Probably. I do recommend it.  It was a little too sweet and thin for my preference.

I’m not sure how to review this - it definitely tastes authentic, like the ones served in restaurants or delis. However I think maybe I just don’t like that style of cole slaw! The sugar makes it sickly sweet, and that’s about all I could taste. Yuck. Won’t be making this again, but if you like classic cole slaw, this recipe delivers that.

Very easy to make with ingredients that you usually have on hand. Much less expensive than store bought!  Can season to taste with pepper, poppy seeds or horseradish for a little more zing!

I had never made cole slaw dressing before, so the simplicity of this recipe attracted me.  It taste exactly like what it is, sweet mayo, with a touch of acid bite.  I found it bland and uninteresting.  It was easy to make, and I had the ingredients on hand.  Those were the bright spots of this recipe.  There are as many takes on cole slaw as there are people who eat it, but for me this won't be made again.

Great recipe, however, I thought 2 tablespoons of white sugar sounded like a lot.   I added one tablespoon and it’s pretty sweet!!   I would recommend one tablespoon only.

The only thing I did with this recipe was to buy finely chopped cabbage, and then I finely chopped red cabbage and carrots in my food processor.  I have no teeth so this made it very easy to eat.  The guys just loved it and want me to make it this way from now on.

I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 only because there was no mention of how much coleslaw (shredded cabbage, coleslaw mix, etc.) this amount of dressing dresses! I had a 4 cup bag of brocoli slaw mix and it wasn't quite enough, so I had to add more mayo and adjust the other seasonings accordingly. Otherwise, it is very good. I also added less sugar, just because I do not care for sweet coleslaw.

I made it the first time, just as the recipe called for and it was very good. This recipe is a keeper. Next time I may add some onion or celery seed, but really the base recipe is outstanding and simple!!

Very quick and easy. I followed the recipe exactly; It had a nice balance of tangy and sweet. I did end up adding some celery seeds, but it would be fine without them.

This is a good basic recipe. I doubled this to use on a sixteen ounce bag of shredded slaw. I thought it was a little sour and would use probably two-thirds of the vinegar next time. It was also not quite enough, even doubled, for the sixteen ounce bag. It would have been helpful if the recipe had stated the ratio of dressing to slaw. I ended up adding a half cup of poppy seed dressing I had on hand. All in all, a good basic recipe.

I loved this recipe..Delicious beyond..I used fresh Meyers lemon for their fuller flavor and I used Red wine vinegar. I also made it with the mayo and my family wanted miracle whip so I cut the sugar when I made it with miricle whip but I believe the texture and flavor for me I prefer mayo....I also added fresh ground pepper from peppercorns....Great recipe. Quick, easy and delicious..Thank you!!

I was looking for an easy recipe that I could lighten up a little and this one was excellent! All I did different was swap out half the mayo for plain fat free greek yogurt to help reduce the calories. I will definitely be making this again.

As much as I like this recipe, I wish there were guides for how much coleslaw.  Near as I can figure from the Dole bag,  3 oz. is a serving, so there are 4 servings plus 2 oz. in a bag.  So if you're using a Dole Coleslaw bag, use roughly 1 1/2 bags per dressing recipe. 

In my case, I'm making enough for 18 servings, so I"ll be tripling the dressing recipe and buying 4 bags of coleslaw.

I ran out of the bottled dressing that I usually use, so I found this recipe. It’s really quick and easy!! My husband and I enjoyed it, but my daughter found that it was too peppery, so the next time I’ll reduce the amount of pepper.

Love this simple slaw dressing. It was quick and easy to mix up and complimented our burgers nicely. Only change I made was to add extra cracked pepper to my helping because I absolutely love pepper!

I made this exactly as written.  It is a keeper.  Quick, easy, and tasty—and it calls for ingredients I already had on hand.  I made a double recipe and will use the extra as a vegetable dip.  I will definitely make this again.  And again.

Prefect combination of Mayo, lemon juice, white vinegar and sugar.  I added salt and pepper to taste.  I would suggest doubling the recipe.   So easy.  So good.

I thought it was delicious and crazy easy.  I saw reviewers adding a bunch of stuff, but as one reviewer said, then it's no longer easy!  I totally agree.  You can make it in about 10 minutes and it's FREAKIN AWESOME!

I wanted to give this a 4.5, but half stars aren't available. To make it five star, add in a half teaspoon of horseradish. I think a little bite makes for a wonderful slaw.

This recipe could not be any easier. It makes the right amount for a  bag of shredded cabbage. I used Swerve instead of the sugar.

This is exactly what traditional coleslaw tastes like, the perfect dressing for the perfect Picnic slaw.
I used half a large head of cabbage, and 2 shredded carrots. It came out Awesome!!!
***Side note,. My wife shakes on some celery salt to suit her taste, so this might be something some may like.

Got to admit, I was leery about the amount of black pepper, but it was spot on! Quick, easy, nothing fancy, but quite good. I'll be making it again.

This is how I remember Mama used to make coleslaw dressing, but this recipe has too much sugar for me; next time I'll use much less and add a bit of kefir. Oh... and I put in a teaspoon of celery seed - just because I like it.

It was delicious as is, I just added a bit more pepper. My mother who is difficult, and that's being kind, loved it. I doubled the recipe. I like a bit more dressing. Used pre chopped coleslaw. Ready in a short time. A keeper.

It’s pretty good as is. My only complaint with the finished product is that if you use purple cabbage for color it turns the whole dish purplish. But the dressing is pretty good.

Perfect as written.  The apple cider vinegar and lemon juice balances the sweetness of the sugar and cuts through the fattiness of the Mayo.  It’s perfectly sweet, salty, tangy and creamy.  This is now my ‘go to’ slaw dressing.

This was easy and very good. Next time I'll cut back on the pepper a little bit. I doubled the recipe and refrigerated it overnight. Added to a 16 oz bag of coleslaw mix in the morning. I will use this again.

The first time that I made this dressing, after tasting it, I found that it was too sweet, so I added more vinegar, mayo & maybe a pinch more salt, adjusting to taste. It all depends on personal preference, so be sure to taste the dressing before adding it to the slaw. It's a good, basic recipe.

Even my daughter ate it, and we all know kids can be sooooo picky! I added 3 cloves minced garlic because we love our garlic, but I tasted it before the garlic and it was better than any store bought dressing I've tried. Fast and so easy to make too, wonderful!

Good slaw dressing recipe.  I reduced the sugar to 1tbsp, just because I prefer my slaw a little more on the tangy side rather than sweet.  Also used lime juice instead of lemon, for the same reason.  Turned out great!

Great dressing! Quick and easy with common ingredients that everyone probably has on hand. My only recommendation would be to make it as far in advance as you can so it can sit and the flavors can meld for a few hours.  I did not do this and the dressing was still fantastic. It tastes just like the one on the dressing aisle with the blue lid, maybe better. This one is a keeper!

This is a quick and easy traditional coleslaw recipe.  Instead of sugar I use Swerve.  I double the batch since it doesn't last long around my house. Enjoy!

I made this recipe with some changes.  I used savoy cabbage and instead of using white vinegar, I used 1 Tbs. of seasoned rice vinegar and 1 Tbsp. of fresh lemon.  I also added 3 tsp. of extra garlic pickle juice,  a sprinkle of dill seed, caraway &  celery seed.  No sugar was added because the seasoned rice vinegar has sugar in it.  A splash of Louisiana hot sauce was added for bite.  I mixed it and let it sit for a couple of hours.  It was very good.  Yum.  I will make it exactly like that again.  My hubby thought it was awesome.  We served it with fish and baked Yukon gold fries.

Easy and delicious. I used balsamic vinegar that gives it a great flavor, though it made the dressing a darker color.

I wanted to make a homemade cole instead of store bought  so I googled easy cole slaw recipe and this one was the first one that came up.  This will be my go to from now on. Super easy to make!  I bought a bag of tri color cole slaw and added the ingredients and mix. I limited the amount of sugar on mine.

Simple, easy and the best.  I hate sugar so I cut it in half and it turned out much more to my personal liking.  I can see how other's would prefer the full amount though so I have it 5 stars.  I also added a tsp. of celery seed.

We all loved it! All I did was use lime instead of lemon (because it was all I had) and added celery seeds. Bought a pre-cut bag of choped slaw. Tastes just like Popeye’s and KFC’s! Thank you!!!

Very good dressing. I used white wine vinegar and that made it not so strong.

Easy dressing.  I didn't even measure, just eyeballed it, and it worked great.  Easy to alter to make variations.

This recipe was exactly how coleslaw should taste!! Simply, easy ingredients. The perfect amount for a bag of coleslaw from the grocery store. I did half the pepper but  just for personal taste. Saving this one!!

I made this for coleslaw to pair with pulled BBQ chicken sandwiches.  I did mess up a little I added 2 tbsp of vinegar instead of 1(??) but was able to save it. For my coleslaw mix I shredded 1/4 green and purple cabbage, 1 carrot, and 1/4 of a sweet yellow onion.  It was enough to even coat the veggie mix and still be creamy.

This recipe was great. I don't like coleslaw to be super sweet so I only put in 1/2 tbsp of sugar. I also added 1/4 tsp of Apple cider vinegar on top of the white wine vinegar I added according to the recipe. I used garlic salt instead of regular salt. Delicious!!

I bought packaged cabbage slaw, added onions, made the sauce and thought it was absolutely wonderful!  It is an easy recipe with pantry items and they work so well together and are a healthier option than store bought/pre-made.  Will definitely be making this again!

I made this alongside some pulled pork (recipe from this site)

I loved this! It was so easy and delicious. I did not chop up my cabbage thin enough however - I used purple cabbage and the color popped within the creamy sauce. I will def keep this recipe up my sleeve. Thank you!

REALLY good and healthy as far as coleslaw goes--- the 1/2 cup mayo across all of the recipe was very small.  I cut the sugar in half and added a bit more vinegar as I love my cole slaw on the tangier side.  Really excellent!

Always my go-to recipe for coleslaw.  We use apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar because we like our slaw a little more on the sweeter side.  If you're wondering how much cabbage and carrots to use, we use a little less than half a head of a cabbage and about a half of a carrot grated.  You can adjust if you want more/less orange color in your slaw.   It's good to let the dressing sit with the cabbage and carrots for at least 2-3 hours before serving to get everything incorporated.  Tastes like take out!

Good reliable coleslaw dressing. I find it too tangy and add 2 tbsp whipping cream as well. But it was great to use as a basic dressing. Way better than purchased stuff!

Was too sweet. Would use less sugar next time. Ended up adding about 2 tablespoon more of the lemon juice. Super creamy and delicious. Guests loved it. Served it over slow cooked bbq chicken sandwiches.

Great dressing, way better than store bought. After mixing, I did add a bit more salt, but that's personal taste. Makes just the right amount for a bag of coleslaw mix. Will be using this instead of buying from now on! :-)

Used two prepackaged Trader Joe’s coleslaw mixes ( the type that did not have any dressing included). This recipe for the dressing correctly coats the two packages to the right amount. Lemon- the quantity is about one lemon’s worth of juice. Salt and pepper - didn’t measure, just eyeballed it and added to taste.

Everyone liked it and it was requested for our next get together. We like it more on the 'refreshing' side, so I added more lemon and vinegar. Very yummy.

Except for inadvertently using 1/2 extra tsp of lemon juice, and purposely using less salt, and white pepper, I made this as GarlicQueen directed. I agree with the reviewer who said that if she had wanted to add buttermilk, etc., as another reviewer did,  after giving this recipe a 3 for being "good" as written, she'd have looked for a different recipe. I agree that this was perfect as written, and it was exactly the cole slaw dressing I wanted. .

I made this exactly as written. Let me start with I don't care for cole slaw but hubby loves it. So opted for this and he scarfed it down and said he loved how it wasn't over mayo'd. Then I tasted it...and ate 2 helpings!!! Just outstanding.

Great Recipe!  To all of the modification haters out there...  cooking is all about creativity.  I made a few modifications but the basic recipe is great!  Recipes should be an outline for personal taste and what you may have on hand...  I like celery salt in my dressing so I added it!  Next time I may use less sugar, but this is a great recipe base for anyone to use!  Thanks for posting.

Ok, for all those whinning about this recipe... get over it! It doesn't get any better than this... simple and tastes great! Winner! Sure, there are "different" types of slaw sauces. Doesn't take away that this is a  great sauce! Used about 1/3 head of red cabbage, which the recipe easily covered. Allrecipes comes thru again! Thanks!

I used what I had; 3 carrots and shredded. I used 1 tbspn of sugar, no lemon. I also added the salt and pepper to taste. It tasted like ranch sauce, but sweeter like a slaw (which is what it is). It tasted really good the next day, with oven baked chicken and rice.

It was as good or better than any coleslaw I have had in delicatessens. I did add a few shakes of groundmustard but I think it would have been just as good without it. I just saw ground mustard in another recipe so I added it. All I can say I say is  yummy!!!

Had a 1/4 of a cabbage left over so I love coleslaw and decided to find a easy recipe to make. So delicious! Added grated carrot,  used half the sugar and added celery seed. Will definitely make this again.

Easy coleslaw dressing that tastes great! I just had to use vegan mayonnaise. I put it on a vegan pulled pork BBQ sandwich, but it's really good all by itself. I highly recommend if you are looking for a quick, but tasty coleslaw recipe.

Great recipe and easy to make! Add shredded cabbage and carrots and you've got the best coleslaw in town! The only variation I made to the recipe was to reduce the amount of sugar by half--my wife prefers a more savory coleslaw, and I like mine a bit on the sweet side. The change was perfect for both our tastes. Pairs wonderfully with fish or BBQ ribs. Holds well in the refrigerator for several days without becoming runny, and tastes even better as the ingredients meld. This is now our new "go-to" coleslaw recipe.Enjoy!

I was at the grocery store and was about to buy a $5 jar of coleslaw dressing when I looked up this recipe. I tried it on some broccoli slaw and it was delicious. Tangy, creamy, and I knew exactly what was in it unlike the jarred stuff. Everyone that ate the slaw said it was good, and I'm happy because now I know how to make coleslaw dressing :).

Not creamy enough, liquid residue in bowl bottom. Tasty but could use the addition of a tsp Dijon for example.

I would give it a 5+ if I could.  Made it exactly as written.  Actually tried two different ones for an upcoming BBQ.  Both were very good, but the family vote was hand's down for this one.

I  have made this recipe twice. Once with apple cider vinegar and once with white wine vinegar. Both got high praise, but the apple cider vinegar was the favorite

Simple and perfect. I skipped the salt and tossed in some celery seed.

Cole Slaw is one of those dishes that just does not need to be "fancied up."

Wonderful creamy coleslaw dressing. Have made it many many times and everyone still ask where I bought it. It's the only one I use.

We were throwing a little party for the boxing fight,  and we didn't have any coleslaw dressing.  I was able to whip this up quickly with ingredients we had on hand.  Tasted great! The only thing that was unclear was the size of the serving,  so I ended up having to make a little more to cover my bag of chopped coleslaw cabbage I bought. But delicious!

As written, too much lemon juice and pepper for our taste. I reduced both and we liked it much better. Next time, I will try adding some celery seed, as that sounds delicious.

Pretty darn perfect.  I'm used to NY(LI) German deli cole slaw,  my husband likes a sweeter, more southern version and we both agree that this is a great dressing.

Perfect amount of sweet and tang.  Everyone loved it!  I'm sure some of the suggested additives would be good but I'm usually in a hurry so this is perfect as is.

This to me is the perfect traditional coleslaw dressing --- no tweaking needed! I used apple cider vinegar because I like the tang of that particular type of vinegar. It's rare for me to find any recipe that I don't want to make some changes to, but in this case,  I found this exact recipe to be the perfect blend of tangy and sweet. I'm sure you could experiment to make it spicier, etc., but as is, it's a 5 for me. And being super easy is a plus!

I had never made Coleslaw from scratch...I usually buy the one from the grocery store. I loved the dressing. This recipe  perfectly balanced the acidity and the sweetness, also  creamy enough.

This coleslaw dressing is perfect to make when you need a quick salad with a summer meal.  I made it following the recipe exactly and even my fussy guests liked it.  Tossed with finely shredded cabbage it also works well in fish tacos :)

This is a good dressing but we prefer ours a little less tart. I did add more black pepper than called for and next time I will cut back on the lemon juice.

I typically use a coleslaw dressing that is a little complex, but, needed something quick to make coleslaw for dinner.  This recipe fit the bill.  It came together quickly and had just the right amount of sweet and tart.

I needed to add celery seeds, which is still "Easy", and gives the traditional coleslaw flavor. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Just made this slaw for the 2nd time in 2 weeks. It's really good. No changes, except I used apple cider vinegar. Great as soon as you make it, gets even better after you refrigerate it a while (lets the flavors pop out a bit more). Way better than our old stand-by recipe that we thought was good... Definitely recommend.

Perfect. Made just the right amount to pour over a 16oz bag of coleslaw mix from the store. Great with some ribs and corn and super easy.

Super simple, first time making coleslaw and it was quick and easy. It's sweet and crisp, I added pepper until it took with sweetness away which was as called for in the recipe. Pair this with bbq pulled chicken in the crockpot and its amazing! Thank you for sharing

The cole slaw came out awesome....tastes exactly how I love my cole slaw....not too sweet and just the right amount of tang and creaminess!  The recipe is perfect just as is!  Measurements for ingredients are spot on!  I used Just Mayo (egg-free) mayonnaise, which I love.  I used to be a Hellmann's-only person, but since I tried Just Mayo a few years ago, it's all I use now.  I used apple cider vinegar for this recipe, which is what I use whenever I make my own salad dressing.  I've tried this recipe with a 14 oz. bag Dole fresh cole slaw in the bag, and it was very good.... But the second time I made it, I used Fresh Express cole slaw in the bag....so much better than Dole!  Fresh Express is shredded finer than Dole and it makes a difference in taste (in my opinion).  Perfection!

I halfed the recipe as it was all I needed and used a tiny bit less salt, and splenda instead of sugar, but otherwise the recipe was great! Will be our go to recipe.

This is my go to coleslaw dressing, it is amazing and cannot get enough of it! I do not change anything, to reduce the fat I sometimes use half fat mayo, but do prefer it with full fat mayo, so nice and creamy with that sweet and tartness from the lemon and vinegar.

No changes, made just the way the recipe described.  Yummy.  I use the pre-shredded cabbage mix and then add more carrots and sometimes a little red onion to save time and effort.

I was looking for a simple recipe to adjust for my special dietary needs.  This suits that fine and it looks just like my grandmother's recipe that had been passed on to the other side of the family without sharing.  I can taste her coleslaw now!  Comfort food for sure!  Mine will likely be used on broccoli slaw often, our favorite!  I'll be trying it in chicken salads also -- on greens or without!

Absolutely delish!  Easy and most folks have ingredients on hand. I made exactly  the way it was written did not add buttermilk, or any kind of seeds and I would not  make it any other way! Thanks for a good, easy coleslaw dressing.

I made it exactly as written and it turned out well. The use of lemon juice makes it taste slightly different than what I expect of coleslaw, but it was a good, solid recipe.

I made the dressing as directed and the recipe delivers an easy, plain cole slaw dressing.  It was a bit too bland for our tastes. so added a few dashes of celery salt and onion powder.  Next time I will cut the sugar a bit (maybe 1.5T instead of 2) as well as add the celery salt and onion powder.   I made with light may and it was nice and light.  Be warned, if you like a saucy cole slaw, make additional dressing or cut the amount of cabbage.  I was lazy and just used a bag of cut tri color slaw mix.  We will definitely have again.  In the last 8 days, we have had this twice more with fish tacos.  Definitely now a family favorite!!

We were split in our family as to how much we liked this dressing. I found it too acidic for my tastes. I will make it again, but use less lemon juice.

Quick simple dressing.  Thought in might have too much sugar, but it all balanced nicely when the total ingredients were added.

10 stars!! It is excellent. I am a coleslaw lover. I love the sweetness and a tiny bit of tanginess it has. It is delicious. I shred cabbage and a carrot. Let it sit in the fridge for atleast a few hours to let the flavors marinate together with cabbage/carrots.

Used a little Splenda instead of sugar (for the diabetic folks) and used a 16 oz bag of slaw. Wonderful! Lots of compliments and no leftovers with five of us eating it. Will try other variations of  vinegar for kicks the next time!

Easy and delicious!  Made according to recipe, with the exception of less salt.  I made 1 1/2 times the recipe and used 1/2 a large cabbage and 1/4 bag of shredded baby carrots.  It was just creamy enough without too much dressing.  I saved this and it will be a go-to recipe!

Excellent!  Very quick and easy. 
Grandkids loved it. Made it as a side for grilled hotdogs. 
I used a package of TriColor coleslaw mix from Walmart 'a produce section and added a little bit of white onion.   It was delicious.

I made this for a serving of 12 for a baby shower.  It was perfect as the recipe is written. The only negative I can say is that I didn't know how much cabbage to use. I used a 14 oz pre-mixed bag and a handful out of a second bag. When I served it, I realized I should have added more cabbage.

This is by far the best cole slaw dressing!  I did cut back on
 the sugar when I made it the second time. 1 tablespoon was enough for us.  But it's spook flavorful and creamy!

Would not make again. I actually dumped the first batch and remade it with half the lemon juice and a little less vinegar - still tastes too sharp. Added more sugar to make it bearable. If you are looking for something mellow and a tad on the sweeter side, this is not it.

Very creamy, but a bit too sweet for my taste, especially if serving with pulled pork. I made it again and used 1 T. sugar, and a bit more salt (I used Johnny's seasoning salt this time). It was much more to my liking and my family agreed!

We have made this recipe a number of times. It is the perfect amount for a half bag of precut slaw ingredients. My adult daughter likes to add chopped Granny Smith apple, mini marshmallows, and sunflower seeds like they did at some chicken restaurant in Phoenix. So I humor her. But the dressing itself is the best I have tasted and suites my pallet perfectly.

I gave it 5-stars because it was both very good and very quick to make.  Not the best I ever ate but darn good and I had all the ingredients.  I couldn't find my white vinegar, so used apple cider vinegar and that turned out fine.  I might cut back slightly on the sugar next I make it - perhaps 1½ tablespoons instead of 2, but this was very good.  I actually went back for seconds on the cole slaw, which is something I rarely do.

So easy and just right. Adjust salt and pepper by  taste. I also add dried cranberries and mandarin oranges for sweetness. This dressing compliments it very nicely.

Great - loved it.  I did reduce the sugar a bit, since I don't typically like over-sweet coleslaw.  Also I used mango seasoned rice vinegar, so I didn't want too much sweetness.  It was yummy.

This was delicious!
I did add some celery seed (and used white pepper for the pepper, and Meyer lemon for the lemon, but that wouldn't change the flavor much, just what I had on hand).
I then combined with slaw mix, dried cranberries & Apricots - best slaw I've ever had!!

I'm not a fan of coleslaw in general because it always seems to be too sweet. I do like a "dab" on my BBQ sandwiches though, so since I'm making slow cooker Eastern NC BBQ today I opted to try this rather than store bought. This is an excellent recipe for people like me... I loved that it called for only 2 tablespoons of sugar. I was lazy and bought a 10 Oz. bag of angel hair coleslaw (the pre-packaged stuff with no sauce on it) and the recipe as written was not enough to cover all of the slaw in the bag. I left some out , and put it in the fridge for a couple hours. When it came time to serve it, it was runny because I didn't use all the slaw. Next time I will use the full bag and the recipe as written and see what happens. Thanks for submitting this recipe... went great with my homemade BBQ sandwich!

I was looking for something idiot proof especially for my first time making Cole slaw. Turned out perfect! My husband even loved it and he is extremely picky with Cole slaw and rarely eats it. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Googled an easy slaw for my easy fish tacos and I had all the ingredients for this on hand. It tasted great when I tested as is, but I then added a tablespoon of hot sauce since it was for tacos and it went perfectly with them. I'll use the recipe as is again for bbq sandwiches.

Perfect, quick and easy dressing for coleslaw.  It's a good base recipe that can be changed if desired, but is also great just as it is.

It was excellent and a big hit with some pulled pork and baked beans. I did add just a few poppy seeds but other than that followed it to the letter.

I really enjoyed this easy recipe although I thought it had too much vinegar. I added about a tablespoon of honey to counterbalance the vinegar and it was delicious.

I made this white-sugar-free with organic Avocado mayo (chosen Foods) which is made with honey,  maple syrup (in place  of the sugar) and added some garlic herb seasoning. Turned out amazing with the added kick of being healthy. Will definitely use this as a reference henceforth. 

This is a wonderful recipe to work with. Loved it!

I  did the recipe as written. At first, I found it too tangy (vinegar and lemon juice) and I was worried about letting it sit overnight, because many recipes seem to turn to liquid by the next day and you end up with soup. I had a bit leftover so I tried it  the next day. Not only did the dressing not breakdown, but it had mellowed out!  And it managed not to be cloyingly sweet as some coleslaw recipes can be. My husband said he could eat a ton of it!

The recipe was very easy.  It was too "lemony" for my taste.  Next time I'll use half the amount of lemon juice to begin with and add more if I think it needs it.

Great basic cole slaw dressing. I agree with other posts - a little buttermilk, a little chopped onion, a little horseradish (if you like some zip) and definitely some celery seed. No reason to buy the expensive stuff at the store. Make this and adapt it to your taste.

I had my cabbage and other veggies sliced and I just added the ingredients right on top then mixed!  Perfect and so easy!  I used lime instead of lemon because that is what I had.  While living in the Lesser Antilles Islands I always grabbed limes first.  Just a little bit of St. Croix flare!

This was a fantastic recipe as written.  I made it twice and used rice wine vinegar the second time, was even better, but it is 5 star written as-is.

This was very easy to make  and tastes great. I used apple cider vinegar and added a little celery seed to mine.

I am sure it will become my go to for coleslaw dressing.

Fast and easy.  Added some celery seed but followed the recipe otherwise.  Next time I would cut back on the sugar as it was a bit too sweet for me.  Definitely a keeper.

Very good and so easy.  Made it right by the recipe with no changes.  I take that back...I added a tiny bit of onion only because I was already chopping one for a main dish.  But it's not necessary... I would rate it a 5 star just as it reads.

I made this as is as I wanted an easy quick recipe. I found it quite sweet so next time I'm going to try it with cutting the sugar in half.  But other then that I enjoyed it.

Instead of using cabbage, I used shredded green papaya.  I live in south florida and am always looking for ways to use the mexican papaya that I grow in my yard. It makes a perfect substitute for the cabbage and is good for the stomach! My whole family loved the recipe and I will be making it again and again in the years to come!

I use this recipe all the time and just realized I have never left a review for it. I use apple cider vinegar and also add some celery seed as others have suggested. I make my own mix with shredded cabbage (green or red, whichever I have on hand), chopped green onions and shredded carrots. This is my go to recipe for slaw dressing!

This is how I like cole slaw! The only change I made was to add another tablespoon of vinegar, and I used apple cider vinegar. I also made it vegan by using Just Mayo. This was perfect for a 14 oz bag of pre shredded slaw mix. Thanks!

Easy. Simple. Delicious. Double for a whole head of cabbage. I used Terragon vinegar. perfect! I make up the dressing ahead of time. I cut the cabbage and add scallions and put in a gallon size Ziploc. when ever you are ready to mix it, just pour the dressing in the Ziploc and shake shake shake!!!! no clean up and you wont lose your Tupperware.

I like sweet coleslaw dressings, so I did add a little honey (about 1 tsp.) plus some celery seed.  Very tasty!  Thank you!

Made this today and it was decent for a basic coleslaw! Added a little more black pepper and vinegar (1tsp). Used 1/2 head of cabbage and it wasn't too runny.

This is the Cole slaw dressing I've been waiting for!  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because it does not need as much sugar as listed. I used half as much and it was still excellent. Another time I made it I added a few large tablespoons of crushed pineapple which also adds some sweetness, for those who need it.

Delicious! I made this vegan with vegan mayo (just mayo is hands down the best vegan mayo) and everyone loved it! It dressed 1/2 a med head of purple cabbage and two carrots. I made it again and added 1/2 tbs of poppy seeds, what a great little addition to this awesome dressing!

First time making cole slaw, so I wanted a simple recipe. I had everything besides the lemon juice at home, so its the only thing I omitted. I think it turned out great, and I will definitely make this again! Perfect as a side dish.

This is an excellent recipe. I make it exactly as written if I am making it for a gathering. If making just for myself I add just a bit of red onion that I cut on a mandolin.

I love that this recipe can be made spur of the moment with things you have on hand. When I first tasted it by itself, I thought it was a little too mayonnaise-y, but it was perfect on my broccoli slaw. The second time I made it, I did half mayo, half plain yogurt to cut the calories. It turned out great that way too.

Tasty! Made as indicated, however added some optional ingredients recommended from another reviewer since I had it on hand. Additions to recipe were: 2 Tbsp. buttermilk, 1 Tbsp. Honey, 1 Tbsp. Horseradish & a few shakes of celery seed. Definitely my go to recipe from now on. PERFECT.

This recipe is very good. I followed the recipe as written then tasted it and liked it.  I ,also,  used cider vinegar. I did, however, add a little more vinegar just because I love it  .  I liked it both ways. I will be making this again.

I wanted a very simple coleslaw dressing that I could add to pre-shredded bag of coleslaw.  I detest celery seed and didn't want a fancy slaw as I was using it to top pulled pork sandwiches.  This was perfect!

I loved this!  It was on the lemony side but that's okay!  Perhaps it is because I used lemon juice concentrate... the lemon flavor was good though!  Will definitely use this a lot! Works with light mayo too!

I have made this several times just as is.  I double the recipe and keep in the refrigerator in a pint jar to use as needed.  It doesn't take much to make a delicious salad.

SO delicious! I did make a few changes. I used Balsalmic vinegar instead of regular and 1 tsp sugar instead of 2 tsps. I also added chopped peanuts, about 1/2 cup and some sliced and chopped up celery. Even though it  changed color due to the balsalmic vinegar, it was amazing!

Loved how quick and easy it was, I was honestly taken aback by the sugar amount but it tastes right when it's done. My personal preference  calls for more lemon and salt, and less sugar next time. But thank you!! Ive always wanted to make my own coleslaw.

I had some leftover coleslaw from fish tacos and this worked perfect  for the remaining coleslaw. Not only is this easy it's flavorful too. This will be my go to coleslaw dressing when I'm looking for something quick and flavorful.

So quick and easy to make! I was out of lemon juice once when I was making it and substituted it for apple cider vinegar and it was even better than the lemon juice! I recommend trying that, it tastes so good!

For sure a five star recipe.  I used Stevia for the sweetener and apple cider vinegar.  It's my go to for slaw and I mix the shredded cabbage, green and purple, some green onions and a handful of chopped cilantro and it's the bomb diggity.  My peeps love the flavor and crunch.

Creamy AND tangy!  Added a little more vinegar than what it called for and it was perfect.

Used low fat mayo, half the sugar, and added a few drops of red hot pepper sauce.
Not going to bother buying coleslaw dressing any more, it's that good and easy!

Quick and a guaranteed success. Swap half of the mayo for 3/4 cup of while Greek yogurt to have a lighter version (whisk it in last after you combined all the other ingredients)

So glad I found this recipe because I'm always out of coleslaw dressing when I think I have it. I usually have all these ingredients on hand so it's perfect in a pinch. Good flavor and consistency. Adding this to my recipe box. Thank you!

I used Balsamic vinegar and doubled the recipe because I had lots of cabbage... it was very good... as I had to eat a nice helping to get it to fit into my covered bowl!  I will probably add celery seed when I serve it tonight.

Super easy with ingredients all on hand. I used Splenda instead of sugar and it was wonderful. Since I have celery seeds I think I'll try them next time.

Excellent!  This tastes just like my Aunt's cole slaw, which is a favorite among my rather large extended family.   There is an old, very well regarded BBQ restaurant in my area and they are quite famous for their cole slaw around here.  I added a little celery seed and some additional fresh ground pepper to this recipe and my cole slaw tasted quite a bit like theirs.  Thanks for a simple but very tasty recipe.

I added 1/4 cup of evaporated milk, 1/4 teaspoon of celery seed and decreased the lemon juice and vinegar to 1 tablespoon  and 1 teaspoon.  I also added 1 tablespoon of Orange juice.  I used green and purple cabbage with the carrots.  Very very good.

I added a little more lemon juice and a dash of hot sauce for a kick.  I also added chopped cilantro to my pre-sliced cabbage/lettuce mixture before pouring the dressing over it.  The slaw was delicious on pulled pork sandwiches and my husband loved it!!

I  used apple cider vinegar and doubled the recipe for two bags of cole slaw mix. Perfect!

I didn't add all the sugar, about  1 and 1/2 tbsp.  Was good and fast. Will add celery seed next time to add a little more taste. However, it was a hit as it was.

Very good. Nice basic recipe...I added celery seeds, a touch of creamy horseradish,  3 tbsp 1% buttermilk , a little half/half, xylitol in place of table sugar and lite mayo.  Would have added a splash of pineapple juice but forgot! Turned out good as an accompaniment to my baked battered fish. Thanks!

Perfectly acceptable "easy" coleslaw dressing.  I've been trying to build an arsenal of recipes that I can memorize fairly easily for staples, such as coleslaw...  this one fits the bill perfectly!  You can adjust the vinegar (or use different vinegars) and up/down the sugar to the taste you want.  It's also a perfect base for branching out with other spices/flavors.  Thanks for this recipe - I'm sure I will be getting much use out of it.

Totally agree with other post didn't have to add anything I wanted quick and easy coleslaw to add on top of a BBQ pulled pork sandwich and this was perfect.

Just as it states, "EASY." Homemade coleslaw always seemed an intimidating task due to long ingredient lists. But this was so simple. I didn't have mayo on hand, so I used greek yogurt instead. It turned out amazing!

Very easy - messed up a bit and used a whole cup of mayo (was trying to do to much at one time).  Anyway, I am used to more dressing in my slaw, but this worked really well and I am sure much more healthy then it being drowned in dressing.  Thanks for sharing so we could try it.

Added a half teaspoon of celery seed and used light mayo instead. Worked the mixture into a bowl with a bag of slaw mix and in the fridge it went for a couple of hours. Delicious and easy, and better and healthier than the store-bought variety. Made a terrfic last minute side addition to country style ribs.

Added to a 16 oz bag of slaw and it was perfect! It is my new favorite EASY slaw, perfect with BBQ pulled chicken. I have to admit, I was a little nervous when I tasted it immediately after mixing because the lemon seems to over power but after mixing with the slaw and letting it chill for a few hours it was great!

I left out the lemon juice (didn't have any lemons) and used apple cider vinegar because that's what I had on hand and the dressing was fabulous. My dad, a very picky eater, thought the slaw was from a popular fried chicken chain. Fast, delicious and definitely a crowd pleaser. Thank you for the recipe!

Actually I was missing lemon but i had lemon pepper seasoning so i combined the amount and used a bit less than recipe suggested. It turned out tasty. Was better day after when sugar was mixed/ melted inside but some people may like that crunchy texture. 
Thank you for recipe

This is so good. It's light and flavor with just a slight hint of lemon at the end. The only change I made was substituting Splenda for the sugar. This is a keeper.

This is a super basic slaw  mix. One of the things I love about looking at reviews is viewing other culinary artists tweaks to adjust a recipe, maybe for different occasions, or being out of specific ingredients. Major kudos for sharing and, .... to others for their input. Ladies, and gents, surely we can all agree that everyone adds a dash of their own spice to life. This is what makes our creations unique!

I was right out of bottled coleslaw dressing but found this recipe.  I had about 1/2 cup of mayonnaise left in a jar in the fridge.  I added the rest of the ingredients to it, and shook it up and "wow".  Very nice.  NO more bottled coleslaw for us. Thank you.

This is a no fail slaw dressing! I always add finely diced spring onion to my  slaw (we love onion), and finely diced, seeded cucumber (creates a freshness to the salad). EXCELLENT!

This was so good! I've made it a few times. The first time, I made it exactly as written. The second time I used lime juice instead of lemon, just because that's all I had, and it was even better!

I used Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise and apple cider vinegar.  I also added 1 teaspoon of celery seed.  I used the one recipe on a bag of coleslaw mix and it was perfect!!

Made this exactly as made and it tasted was perfect. Not real sweet but not too tangy. I put it over a 16oz bag a pre shredded Cole slaw mix. It was ok but I like my coleslaw with a little more dressing so I added 1/4 cup more mayo to make it a little more creamy. Yum!

I made it just as is and it was very good.  I tried the recipe with honey and that wasn't bad either.  The addition of celery seed is good too.  I wanted an easy recipe for a Lenten fish fry dinner that we did at our church and this fit the bill.  I used the chopped cole slaw mix at Sam's and adjusted the recipe - worked great!

I swear these are the same ingredients I've always used, but my ratios must have been off as this recipe is much better than mine.  It's not too "mayonnaisey" nor is it too tangy.  It's just right!

I wanted something special for Easter, so I substituted apple cider vinegar, and added raisins and apples. It was quick and easy, sweet, tangy and delicious. It went beautifully with the ham but I think it would go great with anything. I'm going to be making this cole slaw all summer long!

Very easy and really good. I can't stop eating this stuff. I added some dryed cranberries and small amount of sugar sprinkled on top. This is great, just be aware, it's too easy to overeat on this one. Thanks for this recipe.

Loved it because it was so easy and I had everything on hand. I added just a little extra vinegar,  lemon juice and pepper but that was just for my taste.  This will be my go to coleslaw dressing.

I didn't  have all ingredients so i cannot give it 5 stars . I  made it twice the first time didn't have lemon juice, used half tbs more vinegar. Turned out very tasty but lacked fluid husband loved the flavor. second time I doubled the sauce and changed the vinegar to cider I added lemon juice this time. once again it was great more tangy then the first.

I was using a bottled dressing but did not have enough. This recipe saved the day. I added it to what I had already mixed and it tasted great! A big hit!

Easy and simple to make, I added some mustard as well just for a small kick which worked well! For the coleslaw I also added some slices of apple which gave a sweet crunch.

Easy and delicious!  I doubled the ingredients and it turned out perfectly.  Tangy from the lemon juice and vinegar, balanced by the sweetness and just the right amount of creaminess.  This is going in the recipe book!

My measurements were a little sloppy so I used a tad splash more lemon juice or whatever, but this recipe turned out super amazing and is super amazingly easy to make. It will definitely be our go-to coleslaw dressing for the forever future :)
Everyone loved it and it is soy-free which makes it better in our household for the couple people allergic to soy products. Excellent. And of course, gluten free which is something I need. So yippie. Winner winner coleslaw dinner! Absolutely full of flavour and excellent for pulled pork.

This was just too easy and tasted delicious.  I did add about a tablespoon of celery seed and a bunch of chopped green onion for a little extra zing.

I omitted the sugar entirely. That left the lemon and the vinegar to give a crisp freshness to the finished cole slaw. I doubled up on everything else for a 14 oz. bag of precut  green cabbage, red  cabbage, and carrots.

Easy and delicious. I doubled it because we like a "saucier" coleslaw and I'm glad I did. It easily took that much of this dressing for a large bowl of coleslaw that served about 6 people. I will definitely use this again and again.

Yes, I made changes. I use miracle whip instead of mayonnaise and add celery seed to liking. I put it all in a big jar and shake well until mixed. It's a definite hit at pot lucks and to give to neighbours. Of course I keep some for myself. Instead of going to the trouble of cutting and stuff, I buy the big bags of tri-colour coleslaw on sale and just add dressing as needed.

I gave it 4 stars because of one change I make when using this recipe: I use apple cider vinegar. I also add diced apples. I usually Golden Delicious (not red).

Really yummy! I used Apple cider vinegar also and used 1/2 a head of purple cabbage 3/4 a cup of chopped walnuts and 2 red thinly sliced apples and poured the dressing over the top. My family and friends love it. Crisp and creamy at the same time. Thank you for the recipe absolutely beautiful.

The only change I made was Splenda instead of white sugar. Added it a few grains at a time until I had the  sweetness I wanted. Will make this again.

This is so good I could drink it!  The only change I made was adding a few shakes of celery seed.

Pretty tasty :-) I didn't have lemon juice so I used lime juice. Has a nice tang to it. I hate it when I try coleslaw that has no zing

Did not like. Did not seem to be creamy because it was to thin. The taste seemed "off" to me. Will not make again
