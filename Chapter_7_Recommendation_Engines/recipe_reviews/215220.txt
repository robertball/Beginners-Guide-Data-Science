absolutely wonderful!  I added Aleppo and chipotle, just to spice it up.  What a wonderful and simple addition to my collection!

Delish!! I may never have ground beef tacos again. I used pork loin to cut down on fat. The second time I made this, I skipped the oven and put it in the crock pot, still wonderful. Served with corn tortillas, pico, sour cream, lettuce and cheese.

tasty!!! really like the citrus taste. its also one of the few recipes for pork shoulder that doesn't require 5hrs in the crockpot/oven. i didn't use any Goya products and was still able to create the recipe. Not spicy at all even though i added the jalepeno. Ate with warmed tortillas and homemade pico de gallo.

This was awesome!  I used a pork loin roast.  I didn't use the jalapeno, but substituted 1/4 tsp Chipotle Chili powder.  Served on whole wheat flour tortillas with fresh avocado squirted with fresh lime juice and sour cream in place of the pre-made guacamole.  Added some shredded lettuce too. Definite keeper for this house.

I did the pork to the T, and it came out great. Nice orange-y taste. My boyfriend loved it. I served it in warm tortillas, with shredded lettuce, made my own Pico de gallo, squeeze of lime, and drizzled it with some Salsa Verde. Good recipe to have.

I did use the optional pickled jalapeno, and it was spicy but really good.  I used pork loin since it was what I had, and it was delicious.

Spicy and tasty!  I used a pork loin roast instead of pork shoulder.  Very easy to follow recipe with great results.

Great recipe I did things a little different though. I used the bone from the pork shoulder to make a stock that I then cooked the pork in, instead of jalapenos I let it boil with habaneros and lastly used orange soda. It was spicy sweet and really good.

I made this with a pork butt roast I already had in the freezer. It came out a little dry and didn't really absorb the flavors as much as I would have liked. However, I think that was just the cut of meat because I've had that problem with pork butt before. I will def make this again but next time using the recommended cut of meat. I also threw in a couple of jalapeno into the braising liquid - and added Sazon before and after. I served it with fresh tortillas, guacamole, pineapple salsa, lettuce, and sour cream. On the side we had refried beans and Mexican rice. It was yummy - and leftovers even tasted good cold.

I will make this again.  I just season the pork with salt and pepper  simmering  in onion, garlic jalapenos , 8 chicken bouillon cubes and water.  I then drained the water and  browned the meat in oil, then added orange and 2 packets of goya sazon and put it in the oven like it says in the directions.   Put in abtortilla and drizzle with white sauce, green sauce or adobo sauce.  The family loved it.

Super easy to make, and the meat melts in your mouth. I didn't  add all the peppers  because  the  wife and I  prefer it that way.

Great as is, but on the second time I made it, I used 1 1/4 cup Oj and 1/4 cup lime juice. Holy moly that made the flavor pop!!
