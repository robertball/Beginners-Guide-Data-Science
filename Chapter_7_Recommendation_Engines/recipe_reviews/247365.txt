Fantastic sauce! Everyone loved it as it ended up covering the potatoes and the broccoli too. The Allrecipes printed instructions omit the part of adding the demi glaze back into the pan cream sauce. Luckily Chef John's recipes have amazing accompanying educational videos! When I printed it off a few weeks ago the shallots were also missing from the ingredient list, but it appears that they've been added back. I would suggest watching the wonderful videos first.

Fantastic !!!  Fun to make.  Ok, so I bought a packet of Demi glacé which made 1 cup, so I doubled everything except the mustard (my personal preference).  Now I made a mistake but I don't think it made much difference as hubby said one of the best filets he's ever had!  I used a cast iron pan and grilled the steaks with butter.  Laid steaks to rest on warm plate - added the onion (didn't have a shallot) to the pan and browned that up.  Added an airplane size bottle of cognac, lit it on fire, stirred it up, then added the cream, then here is my mistake - I then added the sauce, stirred it all up and then poured over the steaks.  As to whether that is no longer Steak Diane, I don't know but it sure was delicious!

I made this for New Year’s Eve and it was wonderful. I could not find Demi glace at my grocery store, so I made a quick version of my own. It was delicious. I’ve never made anything that I purposely set on fire before, and it was impressive. I used my trusty cast iron pan. For dessert I made cherries jubilee - also set on fire. Thanks for a great recipe that was lots of fun to make and enjoyed by all.

Excellent.  Made it following the recipe.  This is an old favorite that was a standard offering in many fine restaurants but you never see it any more.

This is amazingly flavorful and rich.  It quickly became a favorite in our household.  In true chef john spirit, I use creme fraiche instead of cream, which I think adds a little to the dish.  Also, I always do this with the best filet mignon I can find, rather than a pounded whole tenderloin—it's a trivial difference I suppose, but I feel this recipe is worthy of your finest steak.

Delicious!   I used the 2 cups / chicken broth method, with top sirloin and this came out fantastic.   Can't imagine how good it  would be with a tenderloin.   Great sides are mashed potatoes (perfect with the sauce) and grilled asparagus (olive oil, salt and pepper on high heat until charred).  13 year old daughter loved it.

My husband loved it.  My teenager took one bite and wouldn't eat it.  I thought it was way too salty with all the demi-glace and then added salt.  If I made it again I would cut back on the demi-glace and not add any salt or use beef broth.

We loved the Steak Diane served at Harvey's in Lake Tahoe, so I decided to give this a try. Very easy, very tasty!  Next time I'll skip the oil altogether I think. I did not have demi glaze so used the chicken broth &  was out of  tomato paste so subbed tomato sauce.  it was still delicious! I will make this again! i don't have the same flair as those waiters at the restaurant, but I didn't have to drive so far either!

I got some really good cuts from my butcher and used a decent brandy in the sauce; let me say I was quite nervous about ruining this dish because it was my first time making it, but it turned out great. Thanks for the recipe. It will be a go to steak recipe in my home.

This was awesome, I was a little leery using tenderloin since we love it plain anyway, but wanted something different so I tried it, I added mushrooms used johnny's au jus for the demi glaze  and brandy for the cognac, I would make this for company, Important to simmer it after you put everything together

Absolutely phenomenal! I couldn't find any demi-glace at my local grocery store so I looked up how to make it and found a simple substitute recipe using red wine and bouillon (I used "Better Than Bouillon"). The substitute was an excellent choice (IMO). The steaks were perfect and tasted amazing, the sauce was absolutely delicious! My family loved it, including my biggest dinner critic, my picky son. Thanks for another fantastic dinner, Chef John!

Really good! No Demi glacé in my little podunk town, but I subbed with Johnnys au jus base. Also a condensed beef base. Probably saltier, but still great! Served with roasted veggies. I made extra sauce for them too!

This is fantastic. I tripled the sauce recipe and added 3/4 cut of sliced mushrooms. Mine was a little too salty, will reduce next time. Served the Steak Diane with buttered peas and Potato Fondant. Wonderful

O. M. G. This was the BEST steak I’ve ever made! (And at 66, I’ve cooked a lot of steak!) I used brandy, not cognac, condensed chicken broth instead of demi-glace, did not flambe it (no need to), omitted the shallots (a husband thing) and cooked it in a cast iron skillet. TO DIE FOR!! I’ll never cook steak any other way again! Thank you, Chef John!

I made this for my husband's birthday yesterday.  Now he says he wants it every year.    I used a bone in rib eye because that's his favorite cut.  I used a cup of demi glace that I had to make myself since there was nothing in the supermarket, so I doubled the other ingredients.  That way we had enough for gravy for the mashed potatoes.   Also, I don't have any cognac nor brandy, so I used a white port that I had and my daughter lit it on fire.  That was so cool.  It was delicious.  I was afraid to simmer steaks, but they stayed rare in the middle and SO tender.

I tried this with moose steaks and it turned out absolutely delicious! Like another reviewer I added the sauce to the pan to simmer the steaks for a minute. Very tender meat with fantastic flavor. My family enjoyed the theatrical flambé as much as the steaks. Will definitely make this again!

I used top sirloin steaks   I marinaded the steaks in the sauce for several hours. I dried the steaks well before searing them. I followed the rest of the recipe. The results were great. I served with orzo and asparagus. 
A keeper!

I made only the sauce, and I had to change it a bit due to we were snow bound and couldn't get out to the store. I used 1 can chicken broth instead of demi-glace. Ketchup instead of tomatoe sauce, doubled the Worcestershire and added 5 chopped schallots cooked in butter. also thickened a bit with 1 tsp of corn starch mixed in a little water . Was excellent. Will make again!!

Amazing, and I even made the “cheater” demi glacé so I had it ready. I didn’t change anything but added 1 more shallot because we love them. DOES NOT NEED ANY EXTRA SALT! Came out perfect! Thanks Chef John!

I have made Steak Diane for years, and have tried countless recipes.  I have never seen one without mushrooms, either finely minced or merely sliced.  The mushrooms give an earthy taste that is the crowning point of the dish.

This is as good as it gets for a steak pan sauce. Its absolutely amazing, flavorful and rich. I add cracked peppercorns to the sauce as well and use just chicken stock because demi glaze is lengthy to prepare. It tastes great still. Chef Johns recipes are the only one's I use from online instead of my own and are always perfect.

I managed to really goof it up. It's such a good recipe that, even though I didn't follow procedures properly,  it was still a nice sauce. I'm looking forward to cooking it properly next time.

Wonderful taste. I used  well trimmed porterhouses steak and a cup of dry white wine  instead of brandy. I also used chicken stock which made the sauce reduction longer  but still tasted great.

Used the chicken stock rather than the demi-glace and while it did need to boil down longer, it was very good.  Used with venison backstrap and it worked great!  Will make again.

It was so good.  I will make it again. With these changes 1) Tenderize the stakes ( I used the top Sterloin) 2) Add two whole shallots. Very good for my frist time making steak for myself.
