Most awesome, I wouldn't suggest this for children as it is soaked in pure rum...with all it's alcohol content.  Ten ounces of rum in the glaze and a 1/4 cup in the mix is almost a whole pint.  Be careful, and remember that this cake is supposed to serve 14.

I've read that some cooks had a problem with the glaze; it's almost like making candy to make this glaze, you need to boil down the ingredients...the mixture will bubble furiously, and it needs to for several minutes before it will set as a candied glaze (not the easiest for an inexperienced cook).  If you need practice on glazing, read up; preparing the glaze correctly will help so this cake won't become a soggy mess...(as some reviewers have stated) It is most awesome and deserves to be made correctly and served at every winter holiday!

Wonderful in every way.  Nice weight, texture and great combinations with the spices and nuts.  I've added this one to one of the many cakes I make for the holidays.  Did have a suggestion -- add the glaze by injection.  I had about half the glaze left over.  Perfect.  I had a friend make this but I guess they did not follow instuctions and it did not work, but it was the best when I made it and my friend loved it too.

I was asked to bake the traditional Rum Cake and I want to surprise my family with something more impressive, I made it, this recipe was a hit.  But I think that for the next time I will lower the glaze ingredients, because is a little bit too much of glaze, I didn't use it all in the cake, so what I did is reheated when I served the cake and if someone ask me I will drip it as a sauce over the cake, that I decorate with chantilly cream and fruits (strawberries and kiwis).

AWESOME!  AND SO YUMMY! I had never made a rum cake before and wanted to try before Christmas gets here.  My husband said it's the best rum cake he's ever had.   When it was time to add the glaze I inserted a teeny funnel in the holes and put about 1/4 cup at a time in. It took a few minutes longer but was well worth the wait.  This is NOT for your kid's birthday party!  Thank you for a great holiday recipe.  

I made this a second time this week and it was fabulous!  This time I let it sit about 20 hours prior to serving.  The texture was wonderful and it held it's shape well.  The flavor was out of this world - sweet and spicy flavor was perfect.  I used spiced rum this time.  To make this work you really need to put some care and time into it.  If you do, you'll be glad you did!

This has become one of our favourite desserts!  It's well worth the effort and wait.  For a healthier version... substitute the 1/2 cup of vegetalbe oil for 1 cup mashed over-ripe bananas OR 3/4 cup apple sauce OR a little more than 1/2 cup plain or vanilla yogurt.    Some great additions to the recipe that I've tried include adding Coconut, Mashed Bananas, Chocolate Chips, Chopped Pecans or Raspberry Puree.  It's been delicious every time  :)

I do not know what I did wrong in preparing this cake, but it turned out horredously.  Maybe it was just my expectations of what I like in a rum cake.  I don't know.  I ended up with not a glazed cake but a soggy cake sitting in a puddle of sugared rum.  The glaze never crystallized.  Although I do like the taste of rum I could not even make myself eat a single bite because the smell of the alcohol was SO strong.  With all the good reviews though, I may have just done something wrong.  I had to throw out the whole cake though because nobody in the house would even try it and I won't try it again, just in case this is what it's supposed to be like.

I was extremely disappointed.  It turned out to be a soggy mess and smelled so strong of alcohol we could not even eat it.  Will not make this one again.

I made this recipe for our Thanksgiving get-together and it was a great hit.  I added a cup and a half of raisins soaked in rum for 48 hours, and that increased the cooking time slightly, your results may vary.  By the time the cake had soaked up most of the rum glaze, the cake had doubled in weight.  I think that this is going to become a staple of celebrations, especially ones where people don't have to drive.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe

Love this cake! I use Captain Morgan's Tattoo Black Rum. It is full of spice - so tasty. Depending on the group I'm bringing cake to, I will cut back a bit on the butter and add more rum for the glaze.

WOW! This is the best rum cake I've ever had.  I used dark rum and coconut rum, and the smell is incredible.  I could eat the whole cake myself!  Great recipe.  Thanks!

I have very fond memories of my mother's bookkeeper making a traditional rum cake every Christmas for my family when I was growing up. Inspired by the childhood memory I wanted to make one myself for our New Year's party this year. This recipe was a wild success! My only suggestion, make extra glaze! I served the cake with whipped cream and the extra glaze and very shortly after I received a standing ovation from my guests. I plan to continue the Christmas rum cake tradition with my family and this recipe! Thank you, Aunt T.!!!

Perfect in almost every way, but to reduce the alcohol and intensify the rum flavoring I add the rum and the butter first bring to a boil, add the sugar, and water, and bring to a slower boil, till it is a sticky glaze and no longer a syrup. I also glaze som walnuts to put on top for decoration. I just do not like the alcohol as much as the flavoring.

I have made this cake for years. It has become a tradition at my office during the Holidays. I do make sure that I use the expensive rum so the alcohol is not as strong. I also add a little extra into the glaze. It is so easy. I just make the cake, punch holes and pour the glaze over and let it sit overnight. AWESOME!!

I have made this cake on several occasions with rave reviews from family and friends.  I have never had a soggy cake as some have described.  The cake is always moist and I think the combination of the spices and rum is fantastic.  However, be forewarned that this cake smells and  tastes strongly of rum, and therefore those who do not particularly like the taste of rum may not like this cake.

After serving this cake at a holiday party many of my guest found it too strong and I sent 80% of it home with my brother. Well, he called the next day and begged me to please bake him another. He LOVED it and can't wait to "pour up a slice" to toast in the new year!

A cake with more pizzazz then most.  I baked this and never even got a slice.  The lucky ones that did -- loved it.  I'm baking another and keeping it for myself!  They all wated the recipe.  It was easy to make - I injected the rum glaze like another reviewer suggested and drizzled it over the top too.

This one has been with me for years.  Simply a fun classic. Make sure to let the cake sit with rum glaze for about a day.  it softens and blends the flavors beautifully. it also solidifies the cake like honey on toast. i love it best with raisins.

This cake is great on taste; however the appearance is a set back...especially if you are entertaining.  The end result looks quite soggy, but great taste.

Great combination of spice and rum,and very moist. We loved it!!! Especially the children, they couldn't get enough of it. Makes a great food gift by using color plastic wrap. A definite holiday tradition with this cake.

I thought the spice & rum combination was more than I wanted for a rum cake, but I did get excellent reviews from my family and friends.

This is a real rum cake made with rum. I've been making this every year for the last 10 years at Christmas. If you don't like using rum, don't make a rum cake!

If you're looking to get drunk off cake, this will work! But, if you're looking for something delicious, try again. My friends and I needed a chaser to eat this. I'm not the world's best chef, but I believe these effects are because of the recipe not me. I mean, if you're adding like 10 shots of rum on top of a cake, you can imagine what I'm talking about.

Very good but I think I like drinking my rum with coke better than eating it in a cake.

I made 3 of these for Christmas this year.  I cut the spices in half to 1/2 teaspoon each, switched pecans for walnuts and used half as many.  I also added a crusty rum glaze on top to dress it up.   It was a big hit and was better after a few days.

Made it. Wrote notes and can’t find them. So here I go leaving notes in review. This was a PERFECT CAKE. I did not have all ingredients so I improvised. I added 1/4 cup flour. I used coconut rum instead of dark rum. I added 1 extra teaspoon Cinnamon. I added a heaping tablespoon of applesauce and Greek yogurt,  I used regular walnuts. And 1 cup of shredded coconut. Baked cake 5 extra minutes topped with glaze as directed sprinkled with shredded coconut.

I was lazy and didn't poke holes into the cake but slathered the glaze over the cake. The glaze was a huge hit and people couldn't get enough of it.

This did not take the full 60 minutes to bake at 300 degrees. I set the timer for 50 minutes, and when I checked it with a toothpick it was already done so not sure how long it had already been done.

I made slightly less of the glaze and thought it would taste better with more. My family thought it was too strong. Best advice: If you like a strong rum taste you will like this cake. If not, don't make it.

I baked this cake for the first time this Christmas and my family loved it!  Upon pouring the rum on the cake, at first the scent is really strong.  But after about 6 or more hours, the rum saturated itself throughout the cake, and it wasn't that bad anymore.  It was really tasty!
