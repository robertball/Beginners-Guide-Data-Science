This was an awesome peach crisp.  I added just a little more cinnamon and replaced 1/2 of the flour with a 1/2 C oatmeal.  My boyfriend said it was the best thing I have ever made for him.  Thank you

I LOVED this recipe. (TIP: boil a pot of water and stick the peaches in for about 20 seconds. The skins will peal right off.) this peach crisp recipe is so versatile. I used a splash of vanilla and a splash of almond extract, about 8 medium sized peaches, and about 1/2 cup less sugar. To the peach mixture, I added a splash of fresh lemon juice and a tablespoon of flour because my peaches were super juicy. Awesome, I plan on making this many times in the future.

This came out SOOO good.  I doubled the recipe for a 9x12 inch pan with no problems.  Instead of adding cinnamon, I added ground ginger because I like the combination of peaches and ginger.  It was fantastic hot, and pretty great cold too.  This is the kind of sugar-y streusel top "crisp" I was looking for--- not the biscuit-y kind.

Excellent!  The name is not mistaken...this recipe is super juicy.  The only addition I made was about a 1/2 cup of Quaker oats to the topping.

I made the recipe as directed, but next time (and there will be a next time) I think I will cut the white sugar back a little. It was a little too sweet, but still delicious! A great way to use up fresh peaches before they go bad.

Absolutely fantastic!  I only had 4 peaches, though, so I threw in some frozen raspberries (maybe 3/4 cup).  I only used 1/2 cup of the white sugar, and I also reduced the flour to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of oats instead.  A HUGE hit!!

My husband took one bite, then looked at me and pronounced that it was "dangerous." He didn't speak again until the bowl was licked clean. Success!

I blanched the peaches to peel them, as some suggested (drop in hot water, then icy water). I used about 3/4 cup sugar rather than the full cup. I also used vanilla extract instead of almond (that's what I had), added a sprinkle of lemon juice to the fruit, and added about 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the topping. I think I might try replacing some of the flour with oats, as some suggested - I forgot until after the flour was measured. 

Thanks for this! Super easy, super delicious.

Yummy!  5-star, except I did what a lot of others did.  I replaced 1/2 cup flour with 1/2 cup rolled oats, decreased white sugar to a little over 1/2 cup and increased brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  Used 3/4 teaspoon Penzey's Vietnamese cinnamon, which is really sweet.  Left butter at 1/2 cup and rubbed into flour mixture with my fingers.  Put my unpeeled sliced peaches in a bowl and added a little more than 1 teaspoon almond extract and 1 tablespoon cornstarch.  Baked at 375 for 40 minutes.  It smelled heavenly.  Served hot with vanilla ice cream.  Husband asked what made the topping taste "like candy."  I'm glad I used the cornstarch; my peaches were pretty soft and VERY juicy.  My new favorite crisp recipe!  Thank you!

This was exactly the kind of "crisp" recipe I was looking for!  Delicious!! Per other reviews, I also used 1/2 the flour and substituted oats for the other 1/2.  Will definitely make again to use up the peaches from our tree!!

Very easy and very yummy.  Doubled the recipe and put it in a 13 x 9 inch pan. Used my handy food processor to mix the toppings.  Only a few minor variations: used vanilla extract because I didn't have any almond extract and I didn't peel the peaches.  I would definitely make this again.

Followed the recipe as written, with the exception of adding a touch of honey and vanilla to the peaches and adding some oats to the topping mix.  Ended up being more like a praline topping, because it was sooooo juicy.  If I make it again, I may try cutting the butter in half and also try adding some sliced almonds to the topping.  Was looking for more of a crumble/crisp topping.  Still enjoyed the recipe, just not quite what I was looking for.

Very good!  I have made this twice.  This first almost as originally written (used 3/4 cup sugar) and it was so juicy that it was pretty much slop the next day.  This time I mixed 1/8 cup sugar with the cinnamon and 2tbs cornstarch and tossed that with the peaches before adding the topping and it worked almost too well.  My crisp is excellent but maybe too dry, so I think 1tbs cornstach would be a happy medium.

This was good, but it was overly oily.  I used oat flour in place of white.  The taste is good but I think if I make it again I will cut down on butter or use more flour.  It would also be okay to cut back on the white sugar.

This was really yummy! I cut back the white sugar by half, which I think helped the fresh ripe peachiness stand out over the other flavors. I loved the almond extract, but I might use just a tiny bit less next time. As is, it was a very noticeable almond. As a lot of other reviewers suggested, I added some oats in place of some of the flour. In my mind oats and crisp just go together. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for a great recipe, and thank YOU StacyD01 for that tip on peeling!!!

Love this recipe!  Made it twice.  Made some changes the second time. It was too sweet for our palates. Less sugar, 1/4c brown sugar, 1/4c white sugar. Added cinnamon to the peaches, sprinkled in, did not measure. Only had vanilla extract, so I used what I had; very good with vanilla.  Used 1/2c white flour and 1/2c oatmeal. To the crumble, I added a sprinkle of nutmeg to the cinnamon, oatmeal, flour and butter mix. It added a bit of a nutty flavor.  It was great and will be making it again for company.

Yum!  I followed suggestions and added a 1/2 c of oats to the topping and substituted 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white instead of only white.  But I did not add any more butter or flour and it came out just wonderful!  I really think the almond extract is vital to making this tasty treat.

This peach crisp is one of the best I've had. Serve hot with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and you've got yourself one delicious dessert! Just to save time, I used canned sliced peaches instead of fresh peaches. Very Delicious!

This dessert is amazing. I followed the recipe exactly, and the only change I would make is using less sugar. I love the crumble without the oats. Will definitely make again!!

The filling for the peach crisp was so juicy that I added a Tablespoon of flour, but it was not enough. It was still so juicy that the topping wasn't as crisp as I would have liked because of all the juice bubbling up.  Along with the flour I used half vanilla bean paste and half almond extract and a splash of lemon in the filling; it was purely delicious with the natural goodness of the peaches shining through.  I am glad that I resisted the urge to add cinnamon.  I subbed oats for some of the flour in the topping and added some extra Penzey’s cinnamon.  I think that I would have enjoyed this more with a thicker layer of topping so I will increase the amount next time.  Peach season is worth the wait when you can showcase one of nature’s most delicious fruits in this crisp.

A very good recipe! My husband and I ate this entire tray to ourselves in one day. WOW!

I did make a few alterations... I was using very ripe peaches from my own tree, so I halved the amount of white sugar. I figured the peaches would be sweet enough on their own (and I was right). I like quite a bit of crumbly topping, so used 1/2 cup white flour and 1 full cup oatmeal.

Fabulous, simple recipe! Will definitely be making this again. Next time I'll probably double (or triple!) it so that it'll last more than 12 hours in our house. DEEEELICIOUS!

Be warned, if you're peaches are overripe and very juicy (or if you blanch them to peel), the topping will just melt into the peaches as it cooks.  I had a few areas of crispy, but only on top of tall chunks of peaches.  The flavor was good though.

Made this today for my church small group and since this year's crop of Georgia peaches has been so good I just had to try it. It was delicious! Didn't change a thing other than doubling the recipe to go in a 9x13-inch pan.  Ended up using about 8 large peaches until I felt like I had enough. Could probably cut back on the sugar just a bit, it is very sweet.   Everyone in our group raved about it!! Thanks for sharing.  (tip from other reviewer regarding blanching the peaches for easy peeling worked great).

Yum! This was excellent. Like others, I cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup (no more is needed), replaced half the flour with oats, cut the oil to 1/3 cup, and added a dash of nutmeg to the flour mixture. Straight out of the oven this is irresistible.

This is a fantastic recipe.  With the exception of cutting the flour in half and then adding 1/2c of oats, and omitting the almond extract I followed the recipe as is. The consistency was perfect, although I could have done with a bit more of the oatmeal "crunch". But that's just personal preference. I used only yellow peaches that were still fairly ripe. The peach farmer at the farmers market said if they were too ripe and soft (esp. like white peaches) the crisp would be runny.  I think he was right!   Oh, I also added a little nutmeg that added just a little something!

Used 1/2 c oats and 1/2 c flour.  Yummy.  Tried to cut the white sugar to 1/2 c but hubby found out and said it would taste better with more sugar.  :)  Will try again with more 1 c sugar.  Used fresh peaches from farm.  :)

I hav to do a 4 star, because I, too, tweaked this a bit.  I used vanilla extract instead of almond, cornstarch and sugar/cinnamon with the peaches, and added rolled oats to the topping.  I must say, my first peach crisp, and it was totally awesome!  Thanks for the post!

While camping in Virginia near the Shenandoah National Park, we stopped to pick some peaches one day.  I wanted to make a peach crisp for our dessert and found this easy recipe which requires minimal ingredients.  Perfect for camping since I don't have a full pantry with me.  It turned out delicious - and we even stopped at a store and got some vanilla ice cream to top it off!  I will probably be making this at home, also.

I ADDED 1/2 c oats to topping. Not substituted. ALSO added a dash of nutmeg and put under the broiler for about 3 minutes after baking for 45 minutes. It crisped up beautifully! Was hoping for a serving to have for later but no luck! The pan was scraped clean. I have a peach tree that overproduced and finally found a recipe to use up hundreds of peaches. Thank you, thank you, thank you!

Made this for a Labor Day bbq and EVERYONE loved it. Made a few small changes based on other reviews (added a bit of vanilla extract, cut down on the sugar, tossed the peach slices w/ a bit of cornstarch, used a blend of oatmeal/flour) plus one change of my own - mixed the topping with melted butter instead of cutting in cubed butter. The results were outstanding. I'll definitely make this one again next year when the peaches are yummy once again!

This is pretty much the same recipe (without the almond extract) I have in a recipe book I got as a wedding present 42 years ago, although that recipe uses apples.  I substitute oatmeal for the flour so my gluten intolerant daughter can eat it. You can (and I have) use just about any fruit. I mix the oatmeal, sugars and butter with my stand mixer. I don't peel anything - it's great stuff & couldn't be easier to make.

I added rolled oats to my topping mix, and this was ready in 30 mins (in a 8x8 pyrex dish).. so be aware of checking your crisp often.  I used vanilla extract instead, and that tasted great.

This was easy, not a lot of ingredients, and came together quickly. I had a handful of almost over ripe peaches which were sweet and juicy.   It was a huge hit, even without the almond extract -- turned out I didn't have that, but no one missed it.  Will definitely make again.

Doubled the recipe (except for the cinnamon) and cooked it in a very deep 9x13 and it came out AMAZING.  i used 1 stick of salted butter and 1 stick of unsalted because that's what i had, and it worked great.  i was worried it would boil over or that the crust would be too thick, but it didn't and it wasn't.  i baked it at 375 for about an hour and a half, and i turned it up to 400 towards the end to get a nice brown crust.  this is exactly the type of crumbly crust i was looking for, will make this again and again...

Delicious.  I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla instead.  My peaches were horrid (hard, and unripe) but it still turned out great.  Will definitely make this one again.

Made again tonight (August 2017).  So delici

I cut the white sugar in half and it was still a little sweet for our tastes. Other than that this was delicious! Tasted like shortbread on peaches. I sprinkled the cinnamon directly on the peaces.

So happy to see a fruit crisp recipe that does NOT have oatmeal in the topping. I prefer the streusel topping that this recipe uses. I served the crisp with fresh-whipped cream----lovely!

I made this for my mom's birthday and she loved it!  Doesn't make a huge amount but it's so simple and tastes great with vanilla ice cream.  I liked the addition of the almond extract.  It's the wrong season for fresh peaches so I just used 2 15 oz. cans of sliced peaches.

Easy and family loved it!! I took some of the other viewers suggestions and also used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1/2 flour and 1/2 oats. I also added a few blueberries as I only had 3 large peaches on hand. Would of loved a little vanilla ice cream to go with it but still still very tasty!

I made this tonight but used some of the changes other suggested. First off, i'd use a lot less Almond extract next time. It was very overpowering but perhaps it's the extract i have. I used Splenda, and only 1/2, 3 cans of sliced peaches since it's now out of season, and added two Madagascar vanilla beans with pods scraped to the peach mix. Yum! Served with low fat vanilla bean ice cream. Very yummy, but again, would use only a drop or two of the extract or leave it out.

This was wonderful, I made the topping with half quick oats and half flour as suggested by some reviewers, and I used 7 peaches and that made more than enough peach filling. I did sprinkle a bit of nutmeg over the peaches, and sprinkled the peaches with a spoonful of cornstarch to thicken a bit. The peaches were sweet and juicy, the topping had the perfect sweet crunchy goodness. Served warm with melty vanilla ice cream ~ WOW what a way to celebrate summer !

I wouldn't call this juicy as much as I would call it soupy.  The peaches I used were very hard and unripe but the dessert came out way too sweet.  I followed the directions as written and the best use we have for it is a topping for ice cream.

I cut my peaches in half and removed the pit before boiling them for 20secs to remove skin it made cutting them up a lot safer than trying to cut up a slippery round object. Great recipe I made a few changes, its def a keeper. Wish it had a little more crunch tho. Thanx!!

I have made this several times this summer, especially when we have extra peaches.  When the peaches are extra ripe I add a little cornstarch or flour to the peach mixture to keep it from being too runny.  However, either way the flavor is amazing and makes a great topper to vanilla ice cream.

Excellent peach crisp recipe!  I used peaches freshly picked today from the farm, and they turned out amazing! I did as other reviewers suggested and added a tbsp of cornstarch to the peaches as well as used 1/2 cup rolled oats with 1/2 cup flour.  I will definitely be making this again!  I also added a few apricots to mine, and it was delicious!

Very good recipe. I cut down on the sugar a bit, but otherwise made it as written. Thanks to the reviewer who suggested putting the peaches in boiling water to make peeling them easier. It worked like a charm! I made this for a barbecue, and my guests loved it. Will make it again.

While it did taste very good, we found that they top didn't really brown, remained gooey, and the fruit was too sweet for our tastes.  Perhaps it was the butter we used or perhaps the humidity ... But it's not on the repeat list

You can't beat this peach crisp!  I did leave out the almond extract as I do not like that flavor at all.  I added a bit more cinnamon in its place.  This recipe is very close to my Grandmother's recipe.  It is oh so good!

Good, but it needs oats or something.  The peaches I had were sort of bland so that didn't help.

Simply amazing! I didn't have almond extract so I left that out, and I used about 3/4 cup brown sugar. And about 8-9 peaches.  The teenagers are gobbling it up!

excellent recipe exactly as posted. Second time I made it, I used double the almond extract and added toasted almond slices, which made it even better.

holy  yummy!!! but i did add more peaches because 6 peaches barely covered the bottom of the dish. i did 10 peaches and glad i did because the topping made a lot and the ratio of topping to peaches wouldnt have been right.

My husband's words "I would not be upset if you made this one again, but I would not be upset if you tried another recipe either." The topping was really good. Used canned peaches though since they aren't in season. Quite tasty!

Simple and great! A keeper says the hubby. Added a handful of oates and to easy pealing I blanched the peaches, as other reviewers described-- 20 seconds in boiling water. The peachers were firm, not ripe yet, and they were just perfect for a warm crisp!

Delicious! I changed the brown sugar to Dark Muscovado and substituted two apples for two of the peaches. Next time I think I'll add a little corn starch to counter the extra moisture in the Dark Muscovado and thicken the consistency. The taste, though, could not be improved upon.   Thank you!

This was Very Good!!  I used vanilla extract because I didn't have any almond extract.  Next time I won't use any.  I used only about 1/2 cup of white sugar.  Next time I may use more.  I also took the suggestion of other people and used 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup quick cooking oats.  Turned out great!  Very delicious and easy to make!!!!!

Blanch the peaches and skins come off easily.  Peel and pit over a bowl so you catch all the juices.  I had fresh picked peaches so I doubled the number of peaches and the extract and put it in a 9x13 baking dish.   My peaches were super juicy so I added a little flour to the  the peaches before the extract.  I cut the white sugar to 1/2 cup and the flour to 3/4 cup and used 1/4 cup oats in the topping.  I also sprinkled some pecans in the topping!  Fabulous!

YUMMY! The topping on this almost tastes like candy after it bakes. The only changes I made were to use vanilla instead of almond extract, 1/4 cup less white sugar, and 1/2 cup oatmeal substituted for 1/2 cup white flour, as per other reviewers.

I love the almond extract in this recipe. I did a half cup of flour, half cup quick cook oats like other reviewer did only because I love oats. This was just so very good. A great thing to do with all those fresh peaches my friends give me.

I've made this recipe many times and I do not get complaints.
 It is a bit deceiving in saying six peaches.  Fill the pan you are using with peaches, leaving around1/2 inch headspace for dry mix and bubbling in the oven, whether that takes six peaches or 3 large peaches.

CUT THE WHITE SUGAR!!!  Use an overful 1/2 cup of sugar and dont skimp on the brown sugar.

If your topping mix seems to be too "dry" and not crumbly, add a few extra tablespoons of butter.

If you run out of cinnamon, substitute Allspice but cut it to a third of the cinnamon.

I used canned peaches that were already sweetened wth brown sugar and cinnamon. I put mine in a pie crust. I cooked the pie crust for 10 minutes before adding the peaches and topping. Then I cooked it for the recommended time. It was delicious!

I changed a few things with this recipe.  Instead of cinnamon, I used ginger and mace.  I also left the skin on the peaches.  Mace has always been my secret ingredient with peach dishes.  People always ask what I put in it.  I saw a very old recipe for peach cobbler that had mace in it.  I was the best peach cobbler I had ever tasted.

I decided to go against the grain and made this "as written" (note sarcasm). The TOPPING (per recipe) is what makes this recipe so good! I could not stop sneaking bites! Thanks for submitting recipe CLYN!

Growing up, my mom made the best peach crisp each summer with the over-ripe peaches. She, of course, didn't use a written recipe.  I have looked for years for a recipe like her's - I have finally found it!!  Thank you, my search is over.  I made it exactly as written and it came out perfect.  Not too sweet and not too soupy.  Good with or without vanilla ice cream. This is a permanent addition to my recipe box.

Took this to a dinner party where there was another All Recipe dessert and this was a hit!  Everyone loved it!  To reap the benefits of skins, I kept them on.  Next time, I'll reduce some of the sugar, since we thought so much wasn't necessary and it's possible to reduce the amount of topping and it would still be delicious!  This is the perfect crisp recipe and I will be trying it with other fruit!

Very good. Easy to put together. I liked the almond flavouring. I think I'd use a touch less of it if I make again, so that the peach flavour is a bit more prominent (I think the peaches I had weren't particularly flavourful though), but it wasn't overwhelming. Like other reviews I used rolled oats for half the flour; to me, "crisp" needs oatmeal in the topping. I also used a little more cinnamon and a little less butter. We didn't find it too sweet, nor too juicy as some other reviewers said. I was a bit nervous about the juicy thing since I've never made this type of thing without cornstarch, but it was fine, good consistency. I did make it ahead of time and reheat briefly later, not sure if that may have helped it thicken a bit on its own. Anyway, very nice and I would make again!

I'm allergic to nuts so I had to omit the almond extract. I added ground cloves and nutmeg. I also followed the others with more oats and less sugar. The peaches came right off the tree so I left the peel on as well. Fantastic!!!!

I had leftover fresh mushed-up peaches (is that a technical term?) from a batch of freezer jam.   I decided to give this a try so the fruit didn't go to waste.  I think THIS ended up being the star of the show rather than the jam.  It smelled so heavenly and was readily devoured by the family.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't have any fresh peaches in the house so I used canned peaches.  I didn't drain it enough and added a couple tablespoons of flour. The alterations I made took away from the crunchy top that I expect this recipe has.  I will make the recipe again, but with fresh peaches and without the almond flavor, which I didn't care for.

Served this at work for our Thanksgiving dinner. I added a cup of quick oats to give it a peach crisp texture and it was one of the only deserts that disappeared completely.

Great recipe!  The only changes I made was using a 1/2 cup of flour and a 1/2 cup quick oats.  I can't wait to try this with apples.

Delicious peach crisp recipe! Made it tonight and served it with rasberry ice cream. Perfect summer evening dessert. I also used half a cup of oats in place of half a cup of flour and baked it for 30 minutes instead of 45 to keep the peaches from getting too mushy. Thanks for all the great reviews - you all inspired me to try this and I am so glad that I did!

It's half gone and it isn't even cooled yet! The smell is fantastic! It does call for too much sugar, I backed off the white sugar to 3/4 of a cup and it was still on the too sweet side. After reading several recipes I used this one for the base but tossed the peach slices in lemon juice before I put them in the pan and used a teaspoon of both almond and vanilla extracts. Then for the crumble I used 1/2 c. of whole wheat flour and 1/2 c. of oats. It is something that we will be enjoying for a long time to come!

2017-08-29 - Update.  3 lbs of peaches, sprinkled top with 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/4 cup sugar (peaches were dull in flavor).  No almond extract.  Ginger instead of cinnamon.  Didn't blanch peaches.  Didn't grease dish.  Crust turned out too crunchy/sugary, so cut sugar next time.  Delicious!
2013-07-21 - This was delicious!  I used 10 peaches and ginger instead of cinnamon.  Butter was room temperature.  Thanks to other reviewers, I boiled each peach for 20 seconds, then dropped it in ice water to make peeling a breeze.  Including this blanching time, total prep time was one hour for me. (Personal: Used largest red-lidded glass dish.)  Definitely serve with ice cream.

Since we are vegan and gluten free, I used this recipe as a basic recipe but changed it to suit our needs.  I cut the peaches as it says; however, I used gluten free oatmeal as the topping with the cinnamon. sugars and vegan butter.  I also added about 1 Tbsp of rice flour to help it hold together.  It was just delicious.  We served it with coconut whipped cream and chocolate coconut milk ice cream.  Yum.

I doubled the recipe, but found that I really didn't need to double the topping ingredients.  I think using one and a half times the topping ingredients would have been sufficient.  I didn't have almond extract, so I used vanilla.  And I also added about 1/2 cup blackberries and a cup of blueberries - it came out absolutely delicious!!!!!

This was delicious.  The changes I made was I took advice from others on here and halved the flour and used oatmeal to make one cup. I reduced the sugar and omitted the almond extract as I didn't have any on hand.  This will now be my new "crisp"recipe for all berries and also apples.  Very yummy.

Yum!  Exactly what I was looking for.  I also substituted 1/2 of the flour for oatmeal, used 1/2 the white sugar, and 1/2 the butter.  Will definitely be a keeper recipe!

Simple to make and delicious!  I added both vanilla and almond.  My peaches may have been a little too juicy because there was a watery juice at the bottom.  But it was still amazing!  And I used the boiling water trick to peal the peaches and it was awesome how easy they pealed! This is def a keeper!

Yummy! I left out the almond extract as I didn't want to detract from the peach flavoring. I used 1/2 c. flour and 1/2 c. oats as suggested by others. The taste probably isn't any different if one uses the full cup of flour and leaves out the oats. I didn't make any other changes. Oven temperature and baking time were spot on for me. My sweet tooth did not find this too sweet with the full cup of sugar. My search for a tasty peach crisp recipe stops with this one. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

Mmmmm delicious!  I made changes to try to healthify it some but I don't think it changed the overall taste of this one bit!  I used 1/2 C soy flour, added in some oats, used Splenda, 3T brown sugar and 5T butter.  I will definitely be making this again and again!

Excellent recipe--Thank you CLYN for sharing.  I made changes--but not because the recipe was lacking--but rather, for our desire to reduce white flour and sugar in our diet.  I reduced the white sugar to a 1/2 cup and substituted 1/2 c brown flour for the cup of white and added 1/2 cup of oats.  Quick and easy to make when you are in a hurry.  Thanks again!!

I didn't have fresh peaches, so I used a 16 oz bag of frozen sliced peaches (didn't defrost). I used half the four and sugar, and added 1/2 c oatmeal. Don't taste the topping before you bake it, unless you plan on making extra toppong... Soooo good. My husband and 4 year old don't like peaches, but loved this dessert! My 5 and 3 year olds loved it as well. I will double or triple this next time because everyone wanted more, and I barely got 2 bites of the finished product!!

Absolutely delicious!  I did make a couple of changes based the reviews - omitted the almond extract (didn't have any), changed the white sugar to 1/2 cup, and did half oatmeal - half flour.  I used fresh peaches that were very ripe, and I was worried about them getting too mushy while they were cooking, so I only baked it for 30 minutes and then broiled it for a few more minutes to brown the top.  Sooooo yummy!

Great simple recipe! After reading the reviews, I cut the white sugar down to 2/3 cup, but I still found it a bit too sweet. In the future, I will cut the sugar even more, maybe to 1/2 cup. There is a lot of topping on the fruit, so I might add a couple more peaches next time as well. Otherwise, the flavor was great!

I just had some of this and OMG it's THE BEST.  If I could give this six stars, I would!!  I followed the recipe but added one Tbs of flour to the peaches and a little lemon juice, before I put them in the pan.  The topping probably had too much cinnamon in it because I didn't measure, just dumped some in -- I love cinnamon though and so it was perfect.  When you add the topping to the peaches it looks like a ton of topping but it bubbled up and melted and was divine.  We ate it warmed up in the microwave with some vanilla ice cream on top.  I can't say enough good things about it.. I think I'm going to go have another serving right now!    The topping would be good with any fruit - especially apples.

I decreased the white sugar to 1/2 cup and increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp.  It had good flavor and was easy to make.

I made this with about 1/2 the white sugar it called for as suggested by other reviewers and it turned out great! Best peach crisp I have ever tasted and my day care kids loved it too. (They don't like much!!) They even took some home with them for later!! The almond extract gives the peaches a great flavor!! I will be adding this recipe to my recipe file for sure. Thanks!

Excellent as written - I think I'll use 1/2 cup each white sugar and flour next time and toss the peach slices w/ the almond extract for a better mix.

Easy and excellent. Like others, I used half the sugar suggested and used 1/2 oats, 1/2 flour amounts.  When I made it, I doubled the recipe, used fewer peaches and added 1.5 cups of blueberries. The result was a fantastic purplish color syrup. Yum.

This was lovely. Instead of the almond extract though, I used imitation rum extract because I thought that would go better with the fresh peaches. It was very good that way.

I cut the recipe to accommodate 2 peaches that needed to be used. I only had vanilla extract but followed the recipe. Fantastic results! After reading reviews I wish I had oats on hand but only had some toasted walnuts that I threw on top halfway through baking. I added more cinnamon because I always do...we don't normally have ice cream, but had the last little bit of fig ice cream left over from this summer's crop of figs in the freezer to go with it for the man. Will do again!

Yummy! I did make some changes as the end of season peaches weren't very sweet. I prepared the peaches, sprinkled with sugar and refrigerated overnight. Other  changes made were to decrease the amount of white sugar in the topping and mix half flour with half oatmeal.  Came out great. Will certainly make this again. Thanks

This is an excellent Peach Crisp recipe.  Nothing says,"Summer" like a peach crisp and this is a definitely a must to  make.  I made the recipe as written without any changes.

This is great!  I made a couple changes not because I’m a great cook but....I only had three peaches so I used a bunch of nectarines too. All good. Also, I did not peel the fruit because I was lazy and you’d never know. It’s delicious!

Four stars because I made changes. To the peaches I didn't add any almond extract and instead drizzled them with fresh squeezed lemon juice and honey.  For the crisp topping I used about 3/4 of the white sugar called for and added a pinch of ginger powder and nutmeg. Made a double batch for an event and served with vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved it.

I cut the flour & sugar in half and used Vanilla Extract instead of Almond Extract. It tasted good, my husband liked it but it was too much of the flour mixture for me. I am going to make it again tomorrow and maybe add one more peach and cut the flour & sugar in half again

This was one of the best fruit crisps I have ever eaten. One thing that really adds a special touch is the almond extract instead of vanilla. I did add about 5 minutes to the baking time to make sure the topping got crisp!

Hi! I did make it and loved it. I did use halvies with the oatmeal. Here's my opinion. If you are new to baking as we all were once: if your using a glass pan be sure to decrease your temp by 25 degrees. Read your reviews take away from those what you need. Don't give up. I did use Blue Bonnet Light as my daughter can't have dairy. Keep in mind margarine has more water than real butter so you the end product may be soupier. I left my peaches in bigger chunks as they were very ripe. Don't be afraid to try something!

Love the crumble topping!   I grew up with this type of non-oatmeal crisp - it's perfect!   For my peaches they needed some flour mixed in because they were too juicy in the finished product.

I have made this several times and it never disappoints! This past time I made it without any extract ( had none in my pantry) and it was not missed at all since the peaches were very ripe and so naturally juicy. Have it with a scoop of ice cream for an added summer treat!

Great recipe!  I didn't have almond extract,  so I substituted vanilla instead.  A little heavy on the sugar,  but I think that depends on how sweet your peaches are too. I will make it again! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I really liked it. It was easy to make and satisfied my sweet tooth. I did use vanilla instead of the almond extract. I also combined oats with the flour. Overall very tasty.

This turned out amazing! I doubled the recipe and used canned peaches instead of fresh because it's currently winter where I am. I also substituted 1/2 cup of flour for 1/2 cup of oats which was a great choice. This is a super easy quick recipe!

For years I\d heard about cobblers and to be honest I'd never had one. So I made this. I live in Finland so I didn't exactly make a peach cobbler.  I had some lovely but very ripe Finnish strawberries, and some fresh black currants, and yes, the 8 peaches another reviewer called ro so I tossed all of these in there. I made the topping, as someone else suggested, with less sugar and substituting some flour for oats, as we are fans of crumbles in our home. I didn't have almond and we aren't fond of it anyway, so I used my vanilla mill to sprinkle pure vanilla, and added vanilla liquid as well. 
It was all veeeeery quiet when we ate this, everyone loved it so much. Using 7 peaches (fruit flies, grrrr!), a pint of sliced strawberries and a cup of black currants (and still yes, less sugar and same amount of topping) it made about 9 servings. I think I will make this again next weekend!

Yep it was ok, and very sweet. I think I was looking for a crisp that was harder on the top. This became very mushy - but I did warm it up a second time. Think I'll try another recipe the next time.

Peach Crisp is my favorite dessert, and this my favorite peach crisp recipe. The almond extract really enhances the peaches. The one thing I have tried based on previous reviews was to use 1/2 Cup oats and 1/2 Cup flour in the topping. But the recipe as written is great as well. This has a wonderful peach flavor with a crisp topping... perfection!

Eyeballed pretty much everything as I was making two of these in two different sized dishes.  This absolutely needs oats.  I did half oats, half flour.  Decreased the white sugar by 1/2 (ish) and increased the brown sugar a bit.  This was seriously amazing and REALLY easy to make.

Great recipe! Like some other reviewers, I used oats in place of half of the flour. I also had some candied pecans handy so I crushed some up and used them in the crumble. I did a plum crisp instead of a peach since that's what I had on hand. The only thing I might have done differently is add some flour to the fruit to reduce moisture in the crisp. Awesome recipe!

The only change I made was to add 1/2 cup oatmeal in place of 1/2 cup of the flour as did some of the other reviewers.  Since I was using frozen peaches I should have also added some cornstarch to the peaches as it was very juicy but tasted great.

This was so good. I thought it was a little sweet, my friend who brought the peaches thought it had too much topping and my best friend thought it was just right. I used a little less flour and added 1/2 cup of oats, added more cinnamon and used vanilla extract.  I will definitely make this again and soon.

This recipe is a keeper! The tip about putting  the peaches into boiling water for about 30 seconds was brilliant! Because my peaches were so big, I sprinkled a little more almond extract over them and added about 1/3 cup oats to the topping, without reducing the flour. Next time, I'll add just a smudge of brown sugar to the peaches and a little more cinnamon to the topping. Not too much of either, as it's close to perfection already. My adult son, who attended culinary school, and is a bit of a food snob, gave this an A+. Served it warm with a scoop of Bluebell vanilla ice cream. Heaven.
Update: this time, I added about 8 crushed ginger snaps to the topping, as ginger and peaches go together so well.

Quick, easy, delicious.  What more could you ask for?  I will definitely be making this again.  I've made it twice.  The first time I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan and it was gone within 24 hours.  The second time I mixed a couple of tablespoons of flour in with the peaches (following another reviewers suggestion) which made the peaches less runny after being cooked.  They were, in fact, the PERFECT consistency.  I also cut back on the butter in the topping a little bit because I was making it on a VERY humid day, and that too turned out perfectly.

I doubled the recipe and used a 13x9 glass pan for 45 min at 350 Fahrenheit. I used 1/2 the white sugar called for and changed the flour to a flour/ oat mixture and made it 1/4 cup more of each to compensate somewhat for the  white sugar I took out. It was perfection.

So simple and easy! Instead of almond extract, I used vanilla that I made with bourbon. When I make this again I will double the peaches. It was good, but my peaches cooked down quite a bit.

This recipe is delicious!!! I did not have fresh peaches but frozen. I placed them in the microwave a few minutes to defrost but not completely. I did everything else as written, except not as much sugar.  I will be making this again and again...

This peach crisp is so mouth watering and delicious! I followed the recipe as listed, although I added a cup of oatmeal for a little more crunch. Came out great and so good hot on top of some vanilla ice cream! Will defiantly make this again! Thank you!!

Fabulous flavor but not really a crisp. Made as directed and dough was pretty wet when put together.  Turned out more like a cobbler but we ate it up!

Made recipe as is.  Next time I will cut sugar in half, as it was much too sweet for my taste.  Also, might add oats or more flour to soak up more of the peach juice, as it was quite soupy.  Very tasty though!

I would totally make this again.  I don't have a pastry cutter, so I just cut up the butter with a butter knife and mixed it in the mixture with a hand blender on "stir" mode.

I took others suggestion & reduced the white sugar & used oatmeal instead of flour (my preference).  I did think it had to much marg so added 1/2c flour also.  I liked it except the peeling of the peaches, but hubby likes pie instead on peach crisp. If I made again I'd add more cinnamon & use my oatmeal crisp topping instead of this.

Excellent!!  I do not like oatmeal in my crisp recipes, that's why I made this one specifically.  The only change I made is that I did not peel the peaches, and you cannot tell.  I also made a 9x13 pan -- so glad I did, it is not going to last long.  Delicious!!!

If anyone rates this less than 5 stars ignore their rating.  And after note: using frozen peaches causes way too much juice and gets soggy

I also cut back on the sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Actually I did 1/2 cup sugar and 1/3 cup brown sugar.  I didn't have almond extract so I used vanilla.  And, I stirred a tablespoon of cornstarch with the peaches before adding anything else.  This was a great recipe.

I tried this recipe as an apple crisp recipe. I must say the crisp part was more than remarkable. I would have done it the way the recipe states but I didn't have any peaches. I had to make a few tweaks to the body, but I left the crisp. You should check it out at www.pantryexperiment.wordpress.com

I made this the other day and nearly followed the directions (I forgot the brown sugar - LOL). The topping still came out yummy. Next time I will add cornstarch to the peaches and add the brown sugar. I may omit the white sugar because the topping was just right with only one type of sugar. Thank you for sharing.

I cut the flour in half and added 3/4 cup oatmeal. I also cut the white sugar in half and added a little nutmeg!

this was a complete disaster. I'm willing to accept responsibility in that I doubled the recipe for a crowd -- and the crowd said it tasted fine -- but to me it wasn't even remotely crispy and just an ugly mess.

Excellent this way but I sweetened the peaches just slightly with honey and skipped the white sugar. I added granola to the topping, too. I also added 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg to the peaches. Made the topping just a little "crisp" and the family loved it!! Even my picky grandsons who won't eat anything!!!  :)

This a great/simple recipe. I made some alterations:

1. Didn't have almond extract. Tossed my peaches (these were slightly green) with rum and honey. 
2. Didn't have a pastry cutter; just used a fork. 
3. Also threw in some almonds and dried cranberries in a layer underneath the flour mixture. 

The 1 cup sugar has to be way too much. As per other suggestions, I only added half a cup and it was still a little too sweet for my tastes. When I make this next time, I'll definitely put in less sugar, but everything else was great.

We made with fresh peaches.  I added some oatmeal to the sugar water topping and it was excellent.  We only used 3/4 c of the sugar water on top.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, but was not impressed with the end result. It smelled amazing while baking, but after it cooled, the top was not crisp at all. The peach portion was okay but nothing special. Not the crisp I was hoping for. :(

YUM! I am not a cobbler or pie person for the most part. This recipe was a great alternative! Fixed it late last night and couldn't resist trying. The amount of butter didn't give it as much of a crumble as I would have liked so I'll be trying to work that a little differently next time. Otherwise turned out great and can't wait to share this with family!!!

This was really good. I didn't have almond extract so used vanilla instead. I bet it would be good with oats too next time. I only had 5 peaches and it still turned out good.

I used vanilla extract instead of almond, and it was a nice flavor!  I agree with other reviewers who suggested cutting back on the sugar if you use tree-ripened peaches.

This crisp is very yummy! I too, replaced 1/2 cup of the flour for quick oats and used vanilla extract rather than almond. Turned out great, though next time I will likely cut back the white sugar to 1/2 cup or so.

This is a yummy recipe for crisp. The only thing I added was to dust the peaches with about a tablespoon of flour to coat (I had really ripe peaches!) so that it wouldn't be too runny. Came out amazing!

When I first found this recipe I did not care for the pictures - the topping looks unattractive. I decided to try it anyways...I should have stuck with my gut and not made this recipe. The topping tasted very bland. The only reason why this recipe could be described as "juicy" is due to the peaches.

I like this recipe- Very tasty. Will be really good served with half and half or  with ice cream, I think. I think it could be a tad sweeter (maybe my peaches were just not as sweet as they could have been) but I will definitely make this recipe again. Would be good with other fruit also, as others have mentioned. I am thinking apples  and/or blackberries in addition to the peaches would be good.

Peaches are apparently close to out of season, so the ones I used were not the greatest.  But you could never tell when it was all cooked. This recipe was awesome...I think the almond extract is what really makes it.  It came out wonderful and I accompanied it with Edy's Butter Pecan ice cream, with No Sugar Added.  Perfect!!

I'm giving this 4 stars with the changes I made. I didn't have any fresh peaches on hand (they're a bit hard to find in Alaska during the winter) so I used frozen thawed in the microwave mixed with 1 tbsp of sugar, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and added 1/4c sliced strawberries(frozen). As suggested by another reviewer I substituted 1/2c of flour for oats (I used quick-cooking) and also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the topping. Instead of using a pastry cutter, I found it much easier to just put on some gloves and use my hands to mix the topping together. I baked it for 30 mins, sprinkled an additional 1/4c of oats on top, and finished baking the last 15 mins. Came out very good. Not too sweet, but not bland at all. Great with some homemade whip cream on top!

It was okay, but a little flat to my tastes. Maybe some vanilla?
