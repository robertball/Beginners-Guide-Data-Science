4.5.19  Certainly is a different way to make au gratin potatoes.  There is one thing that I’ll do differently next time.  Instead of cooking the potatoes in the pot until they’re “tender,” I’ll let them cook until they’re “just about tender.”  They go into the oven for 30 minutes at the end, so they’ll  be fully cooked and, hopefully, firmer.  The milk didn’t quite cover all of my potatoes, so I did move them around in the pot to be sure they all were submerged at one point.  When you stir in the cheese and breadcrumbs, even if you’re trying to do it gently, the potatoes tend to break up, so my potatoes were just a little mushy.  Putting the texture issue aside, they were easy to make using a food processor to do the slicing, and most importantly, did taste very good, even with having to sub swiss (what was on hand) for the Gruyere.
