This recipe is fool proof. I made a few changes in order to adapt it to personal taste. First, I used chunk pineapple rather than crushed. I drained the liquid, and reserved it. I also added a can of fruit cocktail (drained), mandarin oranges (drained), walnuts, and coconut. After mixing all of the ingredients, I added small amounts of the reserved pineapple juice until I got the consistency I was looking for. The juice definitely adds to the flavor of the recipe, and I would recommend using it. The end result has a nice tang to it, without being terribly sweet. This is a new favorite in my household.

I made this recipe for a potluck and everyone loved it.  I find that if you do not drain the pineapple, you have a much creamier texture. I also added 1 cup of chopped walnuts.  I would make this recipe again.

This always disappears in no time at potlucks. You don't need to drain the pineapple though, just mix it with the pudding. I also add 8 oz of sour cream to the mixture and 1/4 cup toasted coconut.

Back when I first met my husband, my mother in law made this for Christmas dinner. I'd never had it before I met her and I fell in love with it on the spot. It's one of my favorite "fluffy salads" to date. She taught me to make this using the whole can of crushed pineapple UNDRAINED and to use a full bag of marshmallows. Sometimes I'll vary it up with the colored marshmallows.

Hubby loved it! I did not drain pineapple juice.  Well actually I did at first then decided to add it because I wanted more pineapple "flavor".

I substituted instant cheesecake pudding (Jello brand) for pistachio and it was even better.  I also used a little of the pineapple juice from the can to make it creamier.  Try it!

This recipe was wonderful. I made it the first time for my daughter's college graduation party and everyone loved it. I liked the fact that I could have the recipe make enough for 60 people and then it gave me exactly what I needed for the ingredients. I did add maraschino cherries for decoration on the top.

My grandmother has made this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas as long as I can remember.  Everyone loves it, and it is always one of the first things to disappear!  It has a sweet, unique flavor that you will crave.  Super easy to make!  I use sugar-free instant pistachio pudding mix instead of regular, and you can't tell the difference.

This is an awesome recipe any time of year.  There has never been leftovers when I make it.  It is easy and delicious.  I always add pecans to mine and refrigerate it overnight.  That seems to allow the mixture to settle in a bit.  Enjoy.

I doubled this recipe.  I added three (8 ounce) cans of crushed pineapple (I did not drain the juice), two (3 ounce) packages of instant pistachio pudding mixes, and two (8 ounce) containers of frozen Cool Whip. I made a few changes.   I didn't have mini marshmallows on hand, so I added a whole bag of jumbo marshmallows.  I also threw in a 1/2 cup of slivered almonds.  Delicious!

I have been doing this recipe for 30 years.  I would always take it to our office party,  especially Christmas.  I also add pecans and the juice.  I whip the cool whip with 4 oz of cream cheese. Delicious.  No leftovers

I'm surprised that this got 5 stars. I think it would be a lot better with mandarin oranges and no marshmallows.

Loved it!  I used the suggestions people wrote in their reviews. Yeah, make sure you DO NOT prepare the pudding--use just the dry powder.  I didn't make this mistake, but the recipe should have been more clear.  I used colored/flavored marshmallows for fun.  Also added mandarin oranges.  Yum!

I made this for dessert at lunch for my husband and son, I did'nt have pistachio pudding but I did have pumpkin spice instant pudding and I also did add the juice and it was great. I guess that goes to show you can use what you have on hand and it will still turn out great!!

I really like this and have been making it for awhile.  Looked for this recipe again because I couldn't remember amounts to use, as it had been awhile since I made my last batch.  I added walnuts to this batch as I remember it needing the crunch.  Had forgotten it was pecans that I love most in this until I took my first bite.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

I love this recipe, but substitute real whipped cream for the frozen topping.  Others might be interested in the 'Pineapple And Pistachio Pudding' recipe from this site.

Very easy and so good.  I used vanilla pudding mix instead, added some maraschino cherries and omitted the mini marshmallows.  I can't wait to actually try it with the pistachio mix.

A keeper! Very similar to a salad my family made years ago, but it was much more complicated and time consuming (required grated cabbage, etc.) This is a great alternative. Tasty, light, and simple. I added mandarin oranges and used chunked pineapple instead of crushed.

I remember having this yummy salad as a small child at a church function.  I'm so glad that I came across this recipe!  Anything that is this quick to put together and devoured by my two kids is a winner in my book! They have already asked me to make it again. Thanks Margit!

I make this same recipe, however, I like to add fresh fruits like grapes, strawberries and cantaloupe.  My family loves it this way!

Great salad!  Really fast, and always a big hit.  I don't drain the pineapple, and I think that makes it a little creamier.  Thanks for the recipe!

Couldn't be any simpler! It tastes great and looks good. I just made this for Thanksgiving and the kids gobbled it up.  I used homemade whipped topping and added a little more than 8oz as called for because it was still too thick.  I also used the mini flavored marshmallows for added festive colors and flavor.  It's yummy and so easy!

We have been using this receipe for years and it is always a favorite.  We like to add maraschino cherries.  This looks great for Christmas with the green pudding & the red cherries.  Also we like to freeze it and serve it frozen.

This recipe is the first one I came across that drained the pineapple instead of adding the pineapple with the juice.  I used a recipe before that didn't drain the pineapple and the mixture was too soupy.  I liked the consistency of this recipe because the salad was still light and fluffy. It tasted just the way I remember my mom's pistachio salad tasting when I was growing up.  Thank you Margit for a great recipe and a trip down memory lane.

Very good, but sweet.  My husband loves how the pudding coats the crushed pineapple and (after chilling overnight) has the taste and texture of pistachios.  Personally, I prefer vegetable salads, but there are never any leftovers with this.

This recipe is an old one...from when I was a kid.  I was making a mother's day dinner and thought I needed some sort of a fruit salad & came across this.  I'm glad I did.  It reminded me of my Grandma(who is now passed), she use to make this....Good, easy and always a hit!!  This is in my saved recipes & I will use it again!

My Mom has been making this recipe for years!  When she went away for the weekend I had a BBQ to attend and couldn't remember the exact measurements that she uses so I came on here.  This tasted pretty much exact like her recipe, however like another user suggested she puts maraschino cherries on top for decoration.  My Mom tends to use this recipe for special occasions like the holidays and not one person can resist.  She usually doubles the recipe just so we have left overs! It's great, try it.  Just make sure you thaw out the cool whip long enough and don't put it in the microwave (even on defrost) it'll turn into soup and take longer for it to set up.

I have been making this recipe for years as a side for Thanksgiving. I do alter it a little by leaving out the marshmellows and by adding cottage cheese instead,and also madarin oranges which makes it healthier and still is yummy!!

My mom has been making this ever since I can remember but there's a few changes that she does to her recipe and I find it works well.  DON'T drain the pineapple.  Instead, dissolve the pudding powder into the pineapple and juice then add the rest as well as a can of mandarin oranges (drained).  So good!

Absolutely delicious! I used fat free cool whip and fat free, sugar free pudding mix. I used crushed pineapple in unsweetened pineapple juice, and half a bag of jet puffed brand mini marshmallos. Made this way, the whole thing is 28 Weight Watcher points. Divide into seven servings, and it is 4 points per serving. Wonderful!

This stuff is addicting.  It's the perfect thing to take to a potluck because it is so easy (and fast) to put together but it's delicious.  I also like to add nuts.  I also think that adding coconut to it would be good but I haven't done that yet.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

Yummy! I made this for a Hawaiian BBQ, it went fast. I added walnuts as one writer suggested. It was a nice touch. I liked the crunch they added with the softness of the marshmellows.Will keep this one file.

Love this recipe!  It is something my mother used to make and is every bit as good now as it was then.  Plus it is really easy to make and takes less than 5 min. to put together.

I've been looking for the recipe to make this childhood favorite for a few years now.  I'm so happy I found it...it was exactly the recipe I was looking for!

I didn't have any marshmellows, so I made the salad without them...it still tasted fantastic!  It took all of 60 seconds to make, and when it was done chilling, my husband and I ate the whole bowl!  Not very good for our hips, but our taste  buds sure are happy!

I bet this would be good if you added fruit cocktail along with the pineapple.  I'll have to try that next time!  Thanks Margit!

This is an excellent recipe.  I have been making this for years.  It is sooo easy and delicious.  I do not drain the pineapple.  It makes it easier to blend the ingredients and creamier to the taste!!  Try ground walnuts on top.

My mother, now deceased, used to make this for Christmas and thanksgiving, and it was always delicious. The only thing she did differently was she added a chopped apple to the recipe. It adds a little something more to it. Try it, you'll love it!

I was given this recipe by a friend, but then lost it when I moved about five years ago.  I've been searching for it ever since!!  This is an awesome, easy dessert!  I leave out the marshmallows because we don't like them and sometimes I add chopped walnuts.  Like many other reviewers, I don't bother draining the pineapple.  It's a pain to try to get the juice out without losing the pineapple and we like the creamier texture you get with the juice added.  This is always a hit at BBQs and potlucks.  I'm SO glad I found this recipe again!

SO easy. Next time I'll add chopped walnuts and that's all it needs. I used both sugar-free pudding and sugar-free whipped topping. And call me crazy, but I found this to be especially delicious when I dipped those square-type pretzels in it. Try it.. I dare you.

I should have just went by your recipe because after reading the reviewers and making a few changes it just messed it up! My husband loved pistachio salad, otherwise known as "watergate salad". But not the way I made it! He said, "That was really sweet of you to make this for me but I really just like for it to be fluffy... I think the kind I like just has whipped cream, marshmallows, crushed pineapple and whatever that green stuff us... I think there's something crunchy in it too!" So, if I would have just went by your recipe without addin all the other changes that everyone else made, it would have been a winner! I think that "if" I do make any changes in the future, it will just be to add some crushed pistachio's or walnuts just to make it a little crunchy! I gave you 5 stars just because I know that YOUR recipe would have been good! To anyone else who reads this, don't make any changes to the recipe if you like pistachio or watergate salad!

My family loves this recipe.  The only thing we changed however was we added pineapple tidbits, drained, and it was really good.  Sometimes at Easter or special occasions my mom uses the colored mini-marshmallows, and it looks cute.

TRY IT THIS WAY ---
Add about 2cups green grapes, and 2 sliced bananas before serving.  I skip the marshmellows... to sweet!

YUMMM!

This has been a favorite "holiday" dish in our family for years. We call it "Watergate Salad." The only thing we do different is added chopped pecans and keep the liquid in the crushed pineapples. Yum Yum Yum

Loved it! My son gave it a thumbs up too. This is a great dish for any occasion. This is really sweet though. I used sugar free pudding mix, and extra creamy whipped topping. I think I drained the pineapple too well though, it seemed a little "dry". Next time, I'll leave a little juice in it. So fast and easy to put together. I can't believe I haven't tried this before. This would be a great summer time dessert as it is light, cool, and not heavy. This was awesome just as it is, but I think it has great potential for lots of variations and personalization. Thanks for the recipe Margit!

I used this recipe except I did not drain the crushed pineapple.  It turned out fine!  I did not add nuts...oh and I used the colored marshmallows.  Super fun BBQ dessert salad. Everyone loved it. OH, before I made it I refrigerated the pineapple and don't forget to put the cool whip in the fridge for 4 hours to thaw before making!

This salad brings back a lot of memories of family get-togethers.  I made this today for a picnic and it didn't disappoint.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used light whipped topping in place of regular.

Took this to Thanksgiving dinner at 2 houses. It was a hit at both, with us leaving some behind for my mother-in-law! Even my step-mom(who can make everything amazing)said hers doesn't turn out well and wanted to know how to make this! Definately will make again and might even experiment with added fruit, or might just not mess with perfection!

Incredibly fast/easy/cheap and tastes great!! I think it would be a little less sweet to not add the entire container of whipped cream - and you don't need the entire package of marshmallows. I like to add a little bit of shredded coconut to mine.

This is my husband's favorite holiday treat.  Will admit I don't love it but it is a big hit with the kids.  It tastes surprising better than the ingredients show.  Best if made a day ahead of time for the flavors to gel.

I made this for a bbq/potluck and it was a hit!  I added mandarin oranges and coconut. I loved the texture the coconut added.

Very tasty.  I did add some chopped pecans - which gives it a really nice crunch and contrast to the soft marshmallows. Walnuts would work fine as well.

Just how it should be. I used sugar free pudding mix and it was fine. I also used non-gelatin marshmallows, which tasted amazing, but got a little mushy in the leftovers. Next time, I will mix up the rest of the dessert, and then just sprinkle the marshmallows on top of each serving as it's dished up.

This was a fun dessert to make and eat.  I used some of the reserved juice to mix in with the pineapple and pudding mix.  I also addes some canned oranges.  I used the low fat cool whip.  I really liked this, but it did remind of me of something my Mom might have made in the 70's (in a good way!)

I love this stuff!   I made it for a potluck and am having trouble not eating it all before it gets there!   I did not add all of the marshmallows.  I also added all of the juice from the can of pineapple, the whipped topping and pudding mix did not seem to combine very well without some liquid.  I will be making this again.

Very easy to reduce the sugar content by using sugar free pudding mix and sugar free whipped cream.  I also added a small bag of chopped pecans.  Tastes great, easy to make and with ingredients I keep on hand!

Was having a BBQ and needed a quick side/dessert item. Printed this recipe out and gave it to my husband to make. We both kept thinking the canned pineapple juice went in my mom's version of this recipe but couldn't recall for sure.  This was o.k. as written but I will definitely add the juice next time and possibly cut back on the marshmallows a bit.

The flavor is terrific! However, this didn't work quite as well for me- it was a teenie bit runny. I omitted the marshmallows and added a drained can of mandarin oranges. I chilled it in the fridge prior to serving, but it still seemed a bit too liquidy. I served it on little dessert plates on top of some baby spinach leaves (just for decoration) and sliced a few bananas (because we had fresh from the backyard) and arranged the sliced bananas around the salad. I sprinkled some walnut pieces between the bananas slices and put a walnut on top of the individual salads. So presenation and flavor still made this an incredibly crowd pleasing dish. I thought it might be better after being in the fridge overnight, but it was still a bit runny. So, I popped it in the freezer. It makes a nice frozen dessert. Next time I will leave out the juice from the tin of pineapples and see if that helps. I think you could add cottage cheese to this too for a nice variation.

This is a favorite at our house. Such a great way to get my kids to eat fruit. I don't drain the pineapple, and I use 16 ounces of cool whip (fat free) instead of only 8. I find this gives it a much lighter flavor. We also love it with 1/2 cup chopped pistachios. We like to add banana, peaches, pears, chopped apples, mandarin oranges, kiwi, whatever fruit we happen to have on hand. There are almost never any leftovers. This is one of my husbands favorite things, and it's requested for his birthday every year.

I agree with other reviewers about the amount of liquid.  I had drained the canned pineapple but at the end added the juice back in - it would have been too dry without it.  I also added a small can of fruit cocktail as others suggested.

Gave 3 stars because it is better if you chill it overnight like I did, so the marshmallows can start to soften.  Also, it would be better with some of the juice from the pineapple, I ended up having to add 1/2 cup of milk the next morning to moisten it up and make it more creamy.  Without the extra liquid it is too clumpy.

OH YUM!!! Only changed two things:  I did not drain the pineapple (as suggested by another cook), and I added coarse chopped raw almonds.  Toasted almonds would be fine too.  We do like a little crunch to this.

As another reviewer said this is a great basic start that can be tweaked to your taste! I personally add the following:a can of sliced peaches, a can of fruit cocktail, a can of mandarin oranges, and sometimes coconut flakes. aMAZing!!! Oh, and an extra 4 oz of cool whip with the extra fruit additions and I do NOT drain the pineapple. Yum!

This was at every family event, always, when I was a kid. I still like it as an adult, but I think I might cut the marshmallows in half next time - they sort of took over. Alas, I'm the only one in my family who likes it, so I don't see it getting made too often. I used fat-free whipped topping and it was fine.

Ok I have to admit I made a LOT of changes to this as I attempted to recreate my MIL's version for my husband. Ultimately it was a success but here's what I added....small can of drained mandarin oranges, 1/2 to 3/4 cup cottage cheese, 1/2 to 3/4 cup crushed pecans, extra pistachio pudding and extra marshmallows. The addition of the cottage cheese and pecans give it some added texture as well as extra pops of flavor.

I have made this at Potlucks, bbq's and even Christmas Dinner - not only is it yummy but it is super easy & affordable to make. It is not overly sweet so it seems to please both the kids & adults.  I did not drain the can of pineapple either.  I also made it about 7 hours before eating it and it was perfection. Just be sure to only use 1/2 bag of marshmallows. Last time I threw in a whole bag not thinking and the balance was definitely off.

This is a recipe I was introduced to through my husbands family. It is a side at every holiday meal. I brought it to my family's Christmas celebration last year and it was a huge hit! This is sweet enough to be satisfying, while light enough to pair perfectly with heavy holiday meals. The fact that it is super easy is a huge plus - hightly recommend!I do not drain the pinapple juice as it is what activates the pudding.

I really love this dip. I got this recipe from a good friend.Hers had a little difference because it contained two additional ingredients.  I also add finely chopped walnuts and marachino cherries halved. This adds more flavor texture and color. You can omit the nuts if allergic.

Thank you! I completely forgot about this dish.  My Grandmother used to make it often.  I loved it.  I quickly made it for my family.  I became a kitchen hero.  So again thank you, for bringing back lost memories, and making me look good with very little effort.

The hardest part of  this recipe is opening the can of pineapples. If you have a picnic and dont have time to make something, this is so easy and AWESOME.  The only thing i added was cherries and you really don't even have to do that.  You really need to give it a try.

I love this recipe!! I take about a 3oz. bag of Pistachio nuts,shelled. Then I finely chop them and ADD to my recipe. I also add a small amount of the pineapple juice, which makes is moist. I like it with out the juice too, but it's thicker. My family likes it so well, I have to double the batch.  Thank You for the Great Recipe!!  :~)    Kathy

My daughter and her family came to stay with us because they had no power due to a bad ice storm.  She brought some half thawed mango that I used in this recipe.  It was really good!  That demonstrates how versatile this recipe is.  Allrecipes.com came in mighty handy during those days!  Thanks!

I prefer the juice drained from my crushed pineapple. I also add 2 cans of drained mandarin oranges. the kids prefer that over adding a can of fruit cocktail. We don't add the nuts.

Tried this recipe for the first time at the request of a friend for her birthday bash. Followed the recipe as shown and it turned out GREAT!!  Light and flavorful.  This is now added to my list of quick summer desserts.

I made this yummy salad last night to take to our family's easter dinner today. My mom has made this for years but I always enjoy looking at different versions of it to try. Your reviewers have given me lots of new versions to try. I'm going to try adding the sour cream or some softened cream cheese the next time I make it. Those additions both sound yummy! I too made it with the pineapple juice and added a small can of mandarin  oranges. I used the mini marshmallows but I used the fruit flavored ones. WOW! Does this ever look like little colored easter eggs in there! It is so pretty! I had to taste test it and YUMMY! I know everyone will love it but.......I really hope there's some leftover for me to bring home!

This recipe is delicious! This is the same recipe my mom has made for years. It's a good way to get your kids to eat fruit (mine won't eat plain fruit). I make this for almost every holiday.

I make this all the time and it is easy and always comes out great.  Last time I doubled the recipe and realized I had bought one can of crushed and one can of chunk pineapple.  I just used them both and it still came out great.

It has a lot of sugar, pistachio flavoring, and pineapple, what could possibly be wrong with that? If I'm being totally truthful, I didn't have a whole 20 oz of crushed pineapple, so I added some mandarin oranges. It worked. Probably could have put just about anything sweet in there and it would have been ok, Skittles, Jujy Fruits, fruit cocktail, whatever.

Not sure how this recipe got 5 stars...the pineapple shouldn't be drained, you use the liquid to activate the pudding.

I'm rating the recipe as is.  I don't care for marshmallows and they are unhealthy so i subbed cottage cheese.  Used lite Cool Whip and in the future they will hopefully take out the trans fats out of Cool Whip.  You could use whipped cream.  Maybe not "healthy" but more of a natural food.  Still, it is cold and tastes good.

I think this is just too thick if you drain the pineapple. The consistency is just right for us without draining the juice. I've made this without any additions, but this time I added chopped walnuts and sweetened flaked coconut. My husband loves this salad.

I could not rate the taste since I just made it.  I will say that I did not experience any "runny" issues after I prepared it.  Wondering if it is runny right from beginning or after it chills as folks have posted.  Since this is the first time making it, I stayed with the original recipe, except that I did pour out some of the pineapple juice.  Left most of it in the dish though.  I do see putting in mandarins, coconut, and/or nuts in it next time.    All I can say is that I sooo needed a "green" dish to take to an event on St. Patty's Day and I am so happy I found this.  It was super easy to make.  Love that!

Easy peasy and absolutely a classic.  I used crushed pineapple and extra creamy whipped topping.  I also subbed pecans for walnuts because that's what I had left today.  It tasted wonderful!

I am almost embarrassed to say I love this!  I usually don't like cool whip pudding concoctions but after having this 2 years ago at a family function I always make sure I have three ingredients on hand!  Nothing like I expected it to be.

My mother found this recipe when I was a kid, back in the 1970's-80's. The recipe included adding chopped walnuts or pecans. We've made it every Thanksgiving and Christmas, ever since. It's the first thing the 'kids' (grown or tiny) ask for the weeks approaching the holidays and there's never any leftovers for the following day. I always leave the pineapple juice in the recipe, which makes the marshmallow salad more moist without being too wet. Yummm!

This recipe is actually on the box of pistachio pudding now. They call it Watergate salad. I didn't add the marshmallows (too sweet) and added about a cup of walnuts. Makes a nice compliment to a savory meal.

Tried and true recipe. This is one of those recipes where you can't share the ingredients until they've tasted it. If you're being fancy, throw some toasted coconut on top.

I've had store-made versions of this which tasted better.  I think that as-is, this was too much whipped cream, but I'm not overly fanatical about whipped cream to begin with.  I think it would have more flavor if less whipped cream was used.  The other yummy flavors are a little bit lost to all the whipped cream.  But other than that, I liked this recipe.  It was really super easy to make.  This would be easy to take to a pot luck.  I might double the recipe and not double the whipped cream.  That would probably be perfect for a pot luck.  I'm curious what it would taste like if the fruity mini marshmallows were used.  If anyone tries that, please let us know!

I was introduced to this dessert 6 yrs. ago when I visited my sister in the States. Since then I tried to look for the right recipe online.   As per other reviewer's tip, I also left the crushed pineapple undrained and mixed that with 2 boxes of the instant pistachio pudding mix. It gave a really good consistency as well as a nice green jade-like color. Then I folded in a can of mandarin oranges, with a bit of its juice, whipped cream, sliced almonds and marshmallow. Always a hit with the family as well as with company. I brought this once to a potluck and most thought I really slaved on this, lol!

Always a great classic holiday dish! I don't normally do this to recipes when first trying them, but I did make a few changes to make it more like I remembered it. I added a can of fruit cocktail, did not drain the pineapple juice, and used the colorful flavored marshmallows.

My boyfriend's grandmother passed away 10 years ago and he was telling me about this "green stuff" his grandmother used to make. I was determined to find the recipe and make it for him. This was it!!! I did not drain the pineapples and used the recipe as is. He really enjoyed it and was so pleased that I found the recipe. Thanks!

This is the exact recipe my mom uses!  She passed away a month ago and my 8 year old son wants this for his party this weekend.  I thought I had it at home but didn't.  This recipe is going to bring back many memories for my family.  I've never thought about the substitutions suggested by others so may need to give them a try.  This is a tradition at our Thanksgiving dinners and will continue.

I had this recipe a while back and lost it. I'm so glad I found it again.I did add a large can of mandarin oranges to this too. My boyfriend absolutely loved this! I've made it twice in the last week.

My step Mom has a similar recipe in which she adds about 3/4 cup of the juice from the canned pineapple to the dry pudding mix and mix well, then add other ingredients.  It's also good with some mandarin oranges mixed in.

Very quick and easy to prepare.  This makes a great side dish for potlucks or bbq's.
