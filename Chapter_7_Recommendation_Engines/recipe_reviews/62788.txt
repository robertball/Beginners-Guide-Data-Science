A little too much citrus going on.  For some reason it reminded me of the "slush"drinks we used to drink in the '70s.  And I've outgrown that.

I left out the lime juice only because I didn't have limes on hand. I kept to the recipe otherwise. DANGEROUS. I adore this drink. What's not to like?

Yummy!  Had limoncello in the fridge that just kept staring at me, so looked up some recipes.  This is a keeper!  Cool and refreshing!

Pretty good!  I didn't have lime juice, so I just left it out.  I tried it with plain vodka too instead of vanilla and I think I like the plain better.  Be warned - this is a very strong drink - but it's very tasty!

I was looking for a recipe to use my limoncello and I found this. I served it as a shooter and everyone liked it.

Enough sweetness without being too tart, reminds me of a Lemon Meringue Martini! Making my second after writing this review!

We had this for NYE 2020! We did not want to spend extra money, so we used this as a start and subbed for anything we didn't have. We used New Amsterdam lemon vodka for Limoncello and lime juice for lemon. I scaled up the recipe to make ~4 cups (1 jigger = 1 cup). I added 1/4 c simple syrup and 1 drop of lemon extract. This was so yummy and gone quickly!

Very good. Has a better balance than a traditional lemon drop. Will make again.

Made as written first and liked it, but it was a bit too tart.  Made again without the lime juice and we liked it better.
