Followed the recipe to the letter except I steamed the cauliflower in the microwave for 2-1/2 minutes instead of boiling. First, I must say that this breaks down incredibly well nutritionally, but I must be honest and say that the coconut flavor was negligible.  In spite of that, the onion and garlic powders add nice flavor to bland cauliflower, it does have a pretty smooth consistency, so this one's a keeper for me!

We steamed the cauliflower in the microwave and used whole milk instead of coconut milk. Even with thoroughly draining the cauliflower, this came out watery and bland. I wouldn't call it bad but it definitely needs something added to it to make it work well.

This was an easy recipe to make. I changed it a bit. I fried onion, minced garlic & red pepper in olive oil & added it to the mashed cauliflower. I didn't have coconut milk so I used almond milk. The recipe could use more flavor, even with the things I added. Cauliflower is always a bit bland for me.
