This was absoultely, positively, delicious!!!  It was very easy to make.  Because I made it in a stoneware bundt pan, I ended up cooking it an extra 20 minutes.  It came out of the pan beautifully.  The glaze pools around the cake, so I kept spooning it back on until the whole cake was covered.  Because of this, I'll pour the glaze on a separate pan next time and tansfer it to the serving dish when it has hardened a bit (just to make it a little neater).  I made it for Valentine's Day, so after adding the glaze, I added some pink and white heart-shaped sprinkles while it was still warm, and they set into the glaze.  It looked beautiful!  The glaze soaked into the cake at the bottom and made a crust all around and the taste was just perfect.  I will be making this many times!

I didn't change a thing when I made this recipe. It was very moist and because it didn't mention greasing the pan I didn't, and it turned out fine! I personally think it's flavor could be enhanced by adding some white or dark chocolate chunks to the batter... Something to think about as you enjoy the lemony deliciousness! My husband (who doesn't generally like cakes) really enjoyed this, as did all who had a slice at the BBQ we brought it to. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought 2 1/3 cups of sugar seemed like a huge amount, so I cut it down to 1 cup. I also used only 3/4 of the oil. I wanted to do half applesauce, half oil but realized I didn't have applesauce. Despite these changes it still worked out well. It was plenty sweet enough especially with the glaze. I didnt have lemon extract but substituted lemon zest, about 2 Tbsp. The texture seemed a little dense , probably due to these changes, but it was still worth serving to company.

The flavor of this cake is outstanding. Just the right amount of lemon flavor. I was surprised, I expected the taste to be more overpowering with all the lemon juice and extract in it.
I absolutely loved this.

The only issue I had, and that's probably on me, was that the glaze did not stay on top of the cake, it soaked into the cake. I reapplied every so often, and only used about half of the glaze, but I ended up with no glaze on top and a sugary, grainy, sticky  layer on the bottom. I think I didn't bake the cake long enough, it was done but still quite pale on top and extremely moist and dense inside. Definitely not crumbly. 
I will make this again, it just tastes too good, and that time I will bake it longer and see if that helps.

Absolutely delicious! I’ve made it several times and everyone loves it and it’s something I’m willing to make whenever relatives or visitors come over, I make little no changes and it has always came out fantastic! Highly recommend :)

The cake was very most but feel flat in flavor. Also after 30 minutes the drizzle never really hardened

This is by far the best lemon-bundt cake I have ever tasted and made. It is very moist, just the right lemon flavor and my husband loved it. I will definitely go forth with using this recipe...

I made this cake and instead of milk I added half - Half and Half and one 6 Oz container of Greek Lemon Yohurt. Every else was the same but I did not include the lemon flavoring and instead added 3 lemons grated peels rubbed into the sugar 2 cups only. Unfortunately my cake was horribly bland and the fresh squeezed lemon 1/2 cup I think curdled the eggs and milk. I would never make this again. I threw the whole cake out. I had just baked a perfect lemon bunt cake the week earlier and it was incredible. Probably one of the best lemon cakes I have ever tasted so this recipe was a huge let down.

The cake was very good, distinct lemon flavor, authentic lemon flavor due to the squeezed lemons. Also, I was looking for a recipe that did not use a box cake to start.
The glaze did not work for me, never thickened. But, I do not have much experience with cooked glazes and icing. So, this one is probably on me.

The texture was dense and very heavy (no 'crumbly' in sight), the cake looked underdone/spongy but was baked till a knife came out clean, and the flavour was blunted.  A huge disappointment.

Just the right amount of lemon taste, but dough too dense and "doughy".
