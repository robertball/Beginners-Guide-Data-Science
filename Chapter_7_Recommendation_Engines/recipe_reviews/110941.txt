These rule -- I made them with cayenne and upped the volume of pepper and they were fantastic.

This recipe is excellent!! This is the first time I ever made lemon squares and my husband went crazy over these.  The chili powder gives it something extra special.  I had to substitue some orange marmalade because I didn't have enough of the apricot and it was still excellent!

The crust is enough for two 9" pans so I doubled the rest of the recipe. The only substitution I made was mango for the apricot preserves. That's a really nice touch, and the custard is good. However, the chipotle is overpowering. I LIKE chipotle and was tempted to add more after reading the other reviews but didn't for a first try. Very harsh tasting. I'll save the crust (but halve it) and I'll save the custard (but tweak it). I have tons of leftovers and that never happens with my crowd.

I really liked the surprising kick from the chipotle. It is not overwhelming either. I used the entire baking time, because at 35 minutes I could tell it hadn't set. A few more and it was perfect. The last step of the recipe can be reduced though. The  1/3 cup powdered sugar and the 1/2 tsp of the chipotle can be halved. I used it all and it makes the bar harder to eat as a bar. It requires a fork and a plate. When I make it next I will only use a dusting of that part. It's more fun to eat with your hands!

i was a little skeptical at first... but wow, these were really good! I almost reduced the amount of chipotle, but I am glad I didn't. Highly recommended!

My family loves lemon bars and chipotle but we just couldn't finish one of these. The texture was great so maybe I will just use it as a lemon bar recipe without the chipotle pepper.

I've made these 3 or 4 times, and this year my husband requested them for his birthday, which is the true test for sweets!  We love the flavors so I added some extra lemon and chipotle.  The ratio of crust to custard is a little too high for my taste, so I'm working on scaling the recipe up but I'm no expert and haven't quite gotten it right.  No one will complain if I practice a few more times.

I made these for a southwest themed potluck at work and I love a bit of heat with my sweets, but these just didn't come together.  The crust was very thick and the lemon and chipotle just didn't find the harmony that would have elevated this lemon bar to something special.

I used chili powder in the crust and cayenne  everywhere else and I increased the preserves to 1/2 cup (I used peach) and OMG!
