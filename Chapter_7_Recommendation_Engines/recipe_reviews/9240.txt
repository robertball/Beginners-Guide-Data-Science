I rate this based on the extensive and detailed recipe. I have been roasting a goose for last 40 years and the simple European recipe is still the best. Only salt and caraway rubbed inside and outside. Never pick the skin until the last 30-40 minutes stage of roasting. It holds the precious juices that will come out for the sauce you keep. You collect the clear fat( very precious stuff for roux and even medicinal purpose) every 30 minutes. After you finally prick the meat you add broth from the neck and giblets. (You can fry the liver on the goose fat for the pate).Goose is not done ,until the legs move freely when pushed. Rule is the same as with the rotisserie roasting: do not rush to get the color on the skin. It will get golden when it's time comes!

I served this meal on Christmas Eve to my typically Midwestern family.  They couldn't believe how juicy the goose was without being greasy, and my mom loved the gravy the best!  I did turn the goose over for about 20 minutes to get it brown all over, but I will use this recipe again!

Excellent recipe, but 1 point to make. Use the fat removed prior to cooking by making goose-fat pastry. For the pastry: remove the large, visible chunks of fat you'll see inside the raw goose. They are obvious. Put them in a pan with some cold water and heat very slowly until melted. Cool, then chill in the fridge. Lift off the fat; freeze it. For ordinary shortcrust pastry use 2oz of fat to 7oz of flour, plus salt as usual. Grate the frozen fat into the flour, rubbing in in the normal way, then binding with very cold water. Rest, then use. PS I always add some lemon juice before the cold water.
(Goose fat has a very low boiling point, so it has to be frozen to make pastry).

THe meat was excellent and so was the gravy, but there was almost no meat on the goose.  Will make similar gravy again, but not the goose.

If ANYONE is silly enough to discard goose fat, please discard it my way.  The fat from 1 goose (rendered and frozen) will last even a New Orleans cook for a year. It yields the most incredible mouth feel and tase to any dish using oil, and you can't imagine the superior quality of a goose fat roux.  The port and sherry are great flavors with this, and adding fresh tarragon makes it even more out of this world. P.S. Way to go.....Saints are 13-0!!!! Laissez les bon temps roulle!!!!!

This was unbelievably good.  The sauce really made the dish.  This was my first time cooking a goose and everyone kept telling me that it would be very greasy.  It wasn't, it was delicious.  Thank you.

The goose was fantastic! I made it for my annual Christmas party and it was utterly demolished. I don't think a pack of coyotes could have left a cleaner set of bones!

We made two major changes: 
First, I put a traditional cornbread stuffing with chopped carrots, celery, and onion in the cavity instead of what they suggested.

Second, the gravy didn't turn out very well by out family's gravy standards, so very little of that was consumed. However, a guest discovered that the goose was ABSOLUTELY AWESOME when eaten with a bite of the spinach artichoke dip. Who knew?!?!

We will definitely make this again... Just skip the gravy.

I had never prepared goose before and relied on this recipe.  Although it was easy and delicious, there is no way it could serve 10.  We scraped every bit of meat from the carcass, and it would serve 4-5 adults.  The port gravy was delicious.

Taking all other reviews into account, I had the confidence that I would make a perfect goose my very first time. I followed the very clear instructions step by step. I removed my goose from the oven as soon as the thermometer registered 80°C, actually closer to 90°C and I was worried that I had overcooked. It turned out that the goose had a fatty, wobbly layer all around that it was hard to get a grip on it with my teeth.  No crispy skin and the meat was not dry. Possibly I should've used a different heat setting in my oven other than 3D-fan hot air. Perhaps goose is just not my thing.

We have never had goose before. I got an Excellent deal at the market for this after holidays meat. I cooked it the way it was writen but did not use the wine hence the 4 stars. My family Really enjoyed this goose! Hubby and I thought it tasted like a rich steak. My skin was not quite as crisp as I would have liked but I guees maybe I did something a bit wrong. I forgot to pour boiling water over it. Maybe thats what happend. I was using a sheet pan to cook it in and wanted to collect the fat for later use. Thank you Christine
