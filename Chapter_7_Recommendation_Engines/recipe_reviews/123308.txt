This can also be baked in the oven and you do not need to precook the noodles - they will cook in the sauce.

I'm rating it a five because the flavor was good and it wasn't the fault of the recipe that mine didn't turn out.  Just wanted to warn other cooks - I subbed medium wide egg noodles (that's what we've always used in our tuna casseroles) and it didn't work at all - the noodles fell apart and the casserole was really soupy.  Again, not the fault of the recipe!  I'm going to try the recipe as written next time!

I had to change this recipe around just a little because I didn't have time to let it sit overnight.  I had some already cooked plain macaroni in the fridge leftover from another recipe so I used it instead of the uncooked pasta and since the pasta was already cooked I decreased the milk to about 2/3 cup.  I also didn't have any green onions on hand so I used a can of onion rings.  I stirred half the can into the mixture before I cooked it in the oven at 375 for about 35 - 40 minutes. I then sprinkled the remaining onion rings on top and cooked an additional 5 minutes.  Very tasty.  The tuna flavor wasn't overpowering like some casseroles can be.  My family ate it up!

I cannot believe how easy this was to make and how tasty it turned out. I did as one reviewer suggested and added some garlic to it; I chopped up a couple cloves. I also cooked it in the oven since I don't like to use the microwave much. I'll be making this again.

Good casserole, and very easy for those who want to exploit the microwave! I think I'd try adding more tuna next time -- one little can didn't seem like enough for 4 servings.

So easy and tasty! I used ingredients in my pantry-- two pouches of tuna and cream of mushroom soup, I also used the quick cook pasta. Next time I would add a little garlic and cayenne pepper. The quick cook pasta decreased the microwave time. Definitely a keeper! Thanks.

Made this last night for DH to pop in the microwave since I had to work till 8pm tonight. Certainly couldn't have been easier to throw together and was easy for him to cook. However, it could have a bit more flavor to it. I used regular onions instead of green and next time I'm thinking maybe some red pepper for color instead of green pepper. Maybe change up the cheeses a bit. It could use some garlic and additional salt and pepper. I will totally make this one again because of how easy it is and the variations you could do with it are virtually endless. Thanks for a nice easy dish!!

This recipe turned out better than I expected.  As far as tuna casserole goes, it was just fine.  Good flavor and very easy to make.  That was my favorite part, the simplicity of the meal.  When I can come home and just throw something in the oven, I'm happy.  Try it.

Tried this subbing chicken, probably 2c or so.  Also used whole wheat elbows.  I baked mine in the oven & it turned out kinda soupy - as in wet, but also evident that canned soup was in it.  Not a bad thing necessarily, but obvious (as if you couldln't tell by the appearance!  :D)  I did cover it with foil so it wouldn't dry.  Maybe too long.  Anyway, it was okay.  Kind of like decent cafeteria food or so-so home cookin'.  I'll keep this in my desperate dinner file.  It'd be good if your choices are limited - to it.  Ha!  Surprisingly, it is quite cheesy with 3/4c in & 1/4c on.

Super easy, the kids love it, husband likes it, what could be better? I keep unintentionally forgetting to add the onions, but do add some additional seasoning to my family's taste (Salt, pepper, garlic powder, parsley).  This is a weeknight winner in my book especially with Lent fast approaching!

This is a great base recipe. I added dill, garlic, pepper, salt & tarragon. It turned out very tasty. I doubled the recipe and there was very little left. Hubby and son ate it up!  Thanks for the recipe!

I took another reviewer's idea about substituting fried onions for the green onions and used cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of celery (made it more kid-friendly). I used precooked seashell pasta and reduced the milk to 2/3 cup (another reviewer's idea). I didn't let it sit overnight, just cooked for 5 minutes in the microwave until bubbly, then put in the oven at 375 for 10 minutes until the onions were crispy.  This turned out delicious!

Very easy dish. It had a good flavor. I'm not a big fan of celery, next time I'll mix it with a cream of mushroom. My husband really liked it, and my 1 year old ate it.

I had a hard time deciding how to rate this.  This is the first tuna casserole I tried and I liked it, though I thought there were far too many peas.  However, it was made for my daycare and none of the 6 kids who all eat tuna casseroles at home would eat it.  Thank goodness for PB&J's!

This was a quick and easy casserole!  I didn't have any green onions, so I just left those out and it tasted just fine.  I am not a big fan of tuna, but I ate it up and even ate leftovers the next day!

I like this better doing half cup of mayonaise and half a cup of milk instead of the 1 full cup of milk it's creamier. I also like this recipe with cream of chicken.

So easy and so good! I added an additional can of tuna and used a little leftover yellow onion, instead of green onions. Also used cheddar cheese slices, because that is what I had. Will make again!
