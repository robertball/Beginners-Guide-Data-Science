Used leftover crawfish from a boil so adjusted seasoning, next time I make these I may leave some of the crawfish just coarsely chopped and add to the mixture after blended to add a little texture. Thanks for the recipe.

Made these for the first time ever today.  I had my first crawfish boulette last week at a little restaurant in Lafayette(yeah, don't know how I ever missed these) and have been dying to make them ever since.  Needless to say, myself and better half are absolutely NOT DISSAPPOINTED!! Easy to assemble and quick to cook.  Could not ask for a better recipe.  I did do as the other review suggested and left a few crawfish whole for texture.  Great idea.   Other than that, I followed as written.  I can't wait to make these again for my entire family!  Thank you submitter!!  P.S. Food processor is absolutely necessary. Glad I bought one especially for this!

WOW is all I can say about this recipe. The only thing that wasn't  good is that they were way too salty and I like salt. Leave the salt out and you have a 5 star recipe all of the way! These were delicious!
