Very disappointed.  Cake texture nice, but very bland tasting cake and frosting.  The frosting was not very attractive.  And, while I love apricots, the apricot flavor overpowered all other flavors and just really didn't seem to go all that well with the Kalua and white chocolate.

Very average cake, weak frosting and lacking in flavor. For all the ingredients and effort I felt let down. Couldn't taste the white chocolate at all, the apricot jam ended up being the predominant flavor. BLAND!
