I use to love White Russians made this way.  But for those that do not like Vodka it can be a bit overwhelming.   I have substituted Peppermint Schnapps for the vodka(My friends have named this The Girl Scout Cookie as it taste like a Thin Mint Cookie) or if you like butterscotch...try substituting ButterShots Schnapps.( My friend made this drink up one night when we were out of vodka... she has named it Smooth Criminal... cuz it goes down smooth but when it hits ya it's criminal)(LOL)

Perfect White Russian. I like more of the kahlua so I added a half of a shot to boost the flavor. Thanks for sharing!

These are good, but I put the ingredients listed here in a high ball glass, and then top it up with milk. I'm a bit of a woosie, and don't really like the alcohol to taste THAT strong. So, I thin it out a bit. These are great though!

I was a little more liberal with my liquor and I used fat free half-n-half for a lighter cocktail. I made this with a twist--I used Smirnoff Whipped Vodka. I've always loved White Russians.......using the Whipped Vodka made me love this drink even more.

Good stuff. I prefer Mudslides, but these are a great substitute and somewhat stronger. I've used vanilla vodka, but I prefer using praline liqueur in place of vodka... And I just made one with Kahlua Especial (70 proof coffee liqueur), so good! And half-and-half is preferable to heavy cream. Thanks for sharing, Patricia!

This one is much better than the regular White Russian on this site. I use fat-free half and half.

I love white russians but these were a bit strong for my taste. I added a little more cream and they were good.

Just vary the ingredients according to taste. White Russians are great.
