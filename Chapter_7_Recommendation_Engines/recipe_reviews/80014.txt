I saw this on tv and had to try it. My kids, the neighbor kids, anyone who came by & tried them loved them. Very easy to make, very tasty.

This was great. My picky eater really liked it, as did my husband. Not real good as left overs though.

My 4 year old pretty much summed up my thoughts on this recipe when I asked him if he had tried his sloppy jose. He said, "Mom, I tried him and he is NOT good." I didn't care for the flavor of the beef and taco sauce with the biscuits. Plus I thought the pre-cooked ground beef/taco sauce was a little on the expensive side for such an ordinary meal. I might make again but just use regular ground beef with taco seasoning rather than the taco sauce and try using a different type if biscuits (I used buttermilk last time).

This was such a fun recipe to make! It's a different twist to regular old sloppy joes. I did use my own ground beef and added the sloppy joe sauce and then some taco seasoning. Much cheaper that way. My husband wolfed down 3 before he came up for breath!! This will be a family favorite for us!
