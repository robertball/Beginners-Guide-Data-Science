Excellent & refreshingly different! I used walnuts instead of pinenuts & used all broccoli instead of broccoli & cauliflower...

I used raspberry vinegar rather than balsamic and it was delicious!  Served at a dinner party and everyone raved about it.

A great twist on a salad. Be sure to slice the kumquats small otherwise you might get a big surprise in a few of your bites. Didn't have celery and didn't miss it. Used feta not asiago and it was still great! Thanks for sharing!
