We used petite diced tomatoes & left them as is.  We omitted the salt, used extra minced garlic (3 cloves – total) & veg. stock instead of bullion cubes.  We added close to 1T Italian seasoning, about 6 oz. fresh mushrooms (personal preference) & a couple shakes of LA Gold (hot sauce).  This is a great week-night “quick fix” dinner.

Don't use 3 beef stock cubes if making this in the Uk or Ireland - just use 1/2 a knorr stock cube. They're much smaller in the states.

This is such a delicious recipe.  I only make 2 small changes.  First, I use small pasta shells instead of the larger.  Second, I use a spicy ground sausage instead of ground beef, it gives the recipe a nice sweet and spicy taste.  Excellent recipe!!

This was a great Monday night dinner! I thought it was really tasty- had a sweet, tangy flavor that was SO comforting! I did add 2 more cloves of garlic but and cut back onthe sugar a bit. So good- kids LOVED it.

This was super simple, and tasty too! I like my sauce thick so I used 30 oz. crushed tomatoes (which I didn't grind) and 16 oz. tom. paste. I also cut down on the bullion and added more garlic. The kids loved this!

I made a few changes--very minimal and it was awesome!  I only had 12 oz of ground beef so I mentally scaled the recipe (using 1 can of stewed tomatoes, 2 bullion cubes, etc).  I used macaroni noodles (what I had), threw in a can of kidney beans and some mushrooms that were in the fridge.  I sprinkled a little bit of cheese on top of each bowl just before serving.  ALL of us loved it--even my picky eaters, and I have lunch for tomorrow.  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!

Tasty and fed eight with ease . I did add green pepper and fresh mushrooms only because I needed to use them up before they went south. I  used two cans of stewed tomatoes and added one can of Rotel for  the spice factor. Might have been on the bland side without the Rotel though. Thanks for sharing ! I love this site , I hate making the same old stuff all the time.

This was pretty good. I'm one of those cooks that I try to use stuff I already have in the kitchen, so the tomatoes were not Italian spiced but just regular diced and crushed. I did have one can of very liquidity salsa so I dumped that in there.  Dropped it down to two bouillon cubes and I had a lot of roasted beef. Used rotini noodles. This turned out sweet with a slight hot kick.

I scaled the recipe down to 2 since it was just me for lunch & I used leftover ground beef (pkg had more than the recipe called for so I fried all of the pkg & refrigerated what I didn't need) ...since my meat was already cooked, I used frozen chopped onions & like Darene, I used a can of rotel instead of diced tomatoes. I just put everything in teh skillet at the same time & let it simmer while I cooked the pasta. I used fresh minced garlic (3 cloves) & I subbed season-all for the garlic salt. I iddn't puree the rotel either & I also added about a cup of beef broth, using a little bit of tomato paste to thicken it up a bit. Topped my plate w/ mild, shredded cheddar cheese....it reminded me of a Tex-Mex type of goulash. Thansk AngelBeliever!

We enjoyed this very meaty sauce.  It had just the right amount of sweetness to it which l liked.  I think l would try adding mushrooms as one other reviewer suggested.  This is a good recipe to play around with adding spices you enjoy in other sauces.

I thought this was really bland so I added cheese and chili powder before serving it and then I kind of enjoyed it. My husband, on the other hand, said "You made that from a recipe? I thought you bought a cheap jar of sauce on sale or something." - Then he apologized, of course!

We loved this.  Only changes I made was to use 2 cans of Rotel tomatoes with green chiles for a kick in place of the Italian stewed tomatos we did not blend it, just stirred tomato mixture till fine. Added 1 cup of 99% fat free beef broth, used garlic powder instead of salt and added a tsp. of Italian Seasoning.  Like all recipes on this site add ingredients that you like.  Yummy!!

This makes a big pot of good 'noodle stuff' as my dad calls it.  I usually add a can of tomato sauce and leave 2 cans of diced tomatoes just as they are.  The leftovers are great heated up!  Perfect for a cold fall day.

I liked this quick fix dinner.  I added celery when browning the beef.
