Delicious, and though Smirnoff makes fine products, I have to take issue with the drink name.  It is NOT a "classic martini", it is a "vodka martini".  Even James Bond knew to order one correctly.  A classic martini is made with gin.  Gin.  I can't order a martini anywhere without the server asking me, "Gin or vodka?"  Gin, of course; if I wanted a vodka martini, I'd ask for one.    As for the recipe itself, it should specify "dry" vermouth.  There are dry and sweet vermouths, and anyone who needs a recipe to make a vodka martini may not know the difference.  I had to knock off a star for that one.

I drink this classic vodka martini, but I prefer it extra dry, so there's less vermouth. The other review about gin vs vodka obviously is a stuffed shirt. If you prefer gin then specify.

I completely agree with HJoe!  I don’t know how the term martini ever started being applied to a vodka drink, but I have a theory that the Cosmopolitan somehow had something to do with it.  It was about this time way back in the early 80’s that the Cosmo caught on and shortly thereafter, other new vodka based concoctions were born.  In any event, this Smirnov “martini” makes a fine drink provided that, as HJoe noted, dry vermouth is used. A Really Stuffed Shirt

I like my martini on the dry side, so I use less vermouth. When ordering, I always ask for a vodka martini on the rocks with a twist of lemon and an olive.  No problem, no questions asked.  I must admit, I usually like my drink at home better. It's exact.

For simple summertime fun using the shaker provides for a nice effervescent cocktail that will cool you off.  I have used 1 once of Smirnoff Vodka and a 1/4 onuce of Smirnoff Citrus to lighten it up a bit and provide some enhancement to the lemmon twist. As far as the vermouth goes I just wave it over the shaker and that is plenty for me.
