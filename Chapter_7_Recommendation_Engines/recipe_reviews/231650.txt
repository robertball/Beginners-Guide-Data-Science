Made these at the last minute for a family party and they were a HUGE hit.  Delicious!  I did use regular brown sugar and white sugar as I don't keep sugar substitutes around.  Thanks!

Good spice mix! I only had almonds and peanuts, so I used those and added some millet. The millet made it into a fun crunchy topping. I also reduced the chili powder and added pumpkin pie spice since I made it for the holidays.

Overall these are really good and easy to make. I used real organic sugar instead of sugar substitute. You have to mix the egg whites and sugar really well.  I rated these a 4 because the cumin flavor is a little over whelming. Next time I will try 1 teaspoon instead of two. Also they are more sweet then spicy.

I didnt have enough nuts in the house so I added enough quick oats to make up for the missing nuts and it came out like a kick a** granola!! It's so delicious! I can add raisins, dates or coconut to it and it's a wonderful trail mix! I love it!

Tasty, good alternative for those who cannot have sugar.  I also used Pumpkin Pie spice since I was out of cinnamon and cloves. I added an additional 1/4 t of ginger (it wasn't needed). None of the flavors overpowered the others. I couldn't taste the sugar substitutes.

These are the worst tasting nuts I have ever tasted. I followed the directions to the T so I don't think I did anything wrong but maybe I did.
