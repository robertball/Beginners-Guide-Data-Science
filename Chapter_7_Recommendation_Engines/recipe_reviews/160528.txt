Um, yeah.  I probably about doubled the cheese cuz I always do.  Mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes, and cheese.  The only way it would be better is if we found some way to add chocolate to it.  Everyone liked this one.  I did have to add a little milk to the white potatoes so they wouldn't be dry.

First of all, mine did not fit in a 2 quart baking dish. I think I could have gotten away with using a 13x9 inch dish.  Also, I used a whole cup of sour cream and added 4 ounces of regular cream cheese to the white potatoes. I used a half a cup of sour cream in the sweet potatoes.  Also I used a half cup of Parmesan cheese in the white potatoes and a half cup of Sharp Cheddar in the sweet potatoes.  With those changes, this dish is AWESOME!!!  So so good and I am not a fan of sweet potatoes.

Wonderful!  If you are looking for a sweet potato casserole that doesn't play up the sweetness, this is perfect.  I also added extra cheese and used plain cream cheese but added garlic and onion powder.  Served with pork tenderloin, green beans and a salad.  Everyone loved it!

My hubby's family had a dinner where everyone had to bring a dish they'd never made before and I was assigned "potatoes".  AAAACK!  What haven't I done with a potato before? I saw the rave reviews for this recipe, but still was NOT confident it would turn out as good as the reviewers said.  I was wrong - the dish was wiped out in a matter of minutes!  My 10-year old nephew went back for the fourth time only to find the dish empty.    I couldn't find chive and onion cream cheese, so followed the advice of other reviewers and added 1/4 tsp each of onion and garlic powder to plain light cream cheese.  I also nuked my potatoes, but found they didn't cook evenly.  I'll either bake or boil them next time . . . and there WILL be a next time!  I've been ordered to bring these to our family Christmas.

This was pretty good. A bit too rich for my tastes due to the crm cheese. I only used 1 swt potato because it was HUGE! I prepared in advance and stored in frige which worked quite well. I baked at 350 for about 30 minutes (covered). I then topped it with a Panko/butter/spice crumble & baked another 15 minutes uncovered. I will use much less crm cheese or none at all if I try this again. Thinking a chipotle or pepper jack cheddar would be my other change vs plain cheddar. If you like dense rich potatoes then this ones for you.

Not only did this taste great, it was unique and company worthy.  The sweet potato taste did not come through very strongly so I would not be afraid to serve this to people who didn't care for the sweet variety.  I used russet potatos for the white layer, but had to add additional sour cream to make it spreadable.

Made this dish for a large potluck......BOY! It was a hit!! The youngest baby at the party would only eat this and grapes, and everybody went back for seconds. The only change I made was that I used more cheese, it just didn't seem like enough for a cheese lover like me!  I was surprised at how easy it was to make as well. I had never cooked with fresh sweet potatoes, nor have I mashed them, but their texture was delightful!  Needless to say this dish is a star, and if you care to make it, you will not have leftovers!

I made this, froze this, and took it to our family beach vacation. It was a nice treat and much easier to put together at home.

Edible, but the flavor combination's were weird.  Out of 5 in our family, no one liked it.  I thought it was tolerable, but I definitely won't make this one again.  Sorry, I'm pretty easy to please, but this one is a 'no'.

Didn't care for this. It was rather dry & bland. if you like your sweet patatoes to taste sweet, I don't suggest this. Otherwise, it's okay.

Yum. Made exactly as written and it turned out great. Like another reviewer stated, the white potatoes were a little dry so I had to add a couple splashes of milk.

I usually make this for Thanksgiving & am now putting it on the Easter menu. Took this to a potluck at Christmas and it was a hit. When asked what the ingredients were, a couple people who don't like sweet potatoes said they had gone for seconds, thinking the sweet potatoes were white potatoes mixed with cheese.

Really great recipe!  I couldn't find the chive and onion cream cheese so I bought plain and added minced garlic, onion and chives... turned out great but I am going to keep my eye out for the chive and onion cream cheese to try for next time :-)

Awesome! I had to cut the recipe WAAAY back for only two of us and forgot the sour cream, but this was wonderful. I used left-overs and will make sure to have more in the future so we can enjoy this again and again. Thanks so much - this is definitely one of the best!

I Made A Few Changes, For One I'm Not a Big Fan Of Sweet Potato, So i Used Red Potatoes Instead, And I Added Hamburger To the Layers. Over All It Turned Out Awesome, Plus I Added Minced Garlic, To the Boiling Potatoes And The Hamburger. I really Enjoyed It :) Will make Again!

I loved this recipe, though no one in my family did; none of them like anything mashed and this was no exception.  I usually do not like sweet potatoes, but it totally works here.
