This cake was just ok for us.  I am not sure that the sweetened condensed milk is necessary  in the boxed cake mix.  I don't know that it actually did anything for the cake considering a box mix is already sweet.  The pears stuck to the bottom of the pan, so, I ended up losing part of them.   I also after cooking the pear filling I tasted the pear mixture before putting it in the cake and we did not care for it, so, I left it out.  I did think the frosting had good flavor.  It was very light and not overly sweet.  It was soft because it is a whipped cream frosting, so, as the recipe author states it is better after refrigerating.
