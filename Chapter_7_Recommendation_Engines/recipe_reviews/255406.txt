OMG! This is awesome. I wanted a recipe to use some homemade apple butter and this was IT. I did reduce the sugar and spices  because I used my homemade apple butter which is already heavily spiced. I added some apple pie filling in dollops across the top, but this was great with or without the extra apples. Will definitely make again.
