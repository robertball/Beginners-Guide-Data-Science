**EDIT**  i made this again and realized that the first time i made it I accidently used only one stick of butter instead of the 2 (1 Cup) it calls for.  2 sticks of butter was too much and made it oily and greasy.  1 stick or 1/2 cup of melted butter was plenty.  I also prefer using crushed pinapple instead of chunks.**

Delicious!  I used 1 C whipping cream instead of milk, brown sugar instead of white and added raisins and cinnamon.

I made this for a church Potluck Fellowship Lunch.  I thought this sounded delicious but being that it's December (just after Thanksgiving) I added a cup of fresh cranberry's to the originial recipe.  IT WAS AWESOME!!!  Everyone that tasted it loved it and wanted the recipe!  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I will definitely make this again and again!

Making the recipe "as is" I gave this dish 4 stars. To make it 5 stars, I made the following changes:
1.) I used about 1/2 loaf of Italian bread. The "crust" pieces are really delish. I took the dish I was going to bake this in & then tore pieces to kinda fill the pan. If you don't have enough bread it can be too "wet".
2.) Use 4 eggs
3.) Add 1 Tbls vanilla
4.) Only use 3/4 cup sugar, it will be plenty sweet.
5.) Use 20 oz. can CRUSHED Pineapple, untrained.

I love this dish, and serve it to my B&B guests for breakfast.  However, after baking it the original way many times, I have found you can do the following with equally good results and not so many calories:  replace 1 C butter with 1/4 C butter and 3/4 C low fat buttermilk; I use plain almond milk (no sugar) for the milk, and use 1 C sugar rather than 2 cups.  With these changes you've eliminated >500 calories by replacing the butter and 775 calories by eliminating a cup of sugar.  The dish is still sweet and you don't have to feel so guilty about eating it. Oh, I did increase the bread by 3-4 slices to soak up the extra buttermilk. Enjoy!

I used Italian bread for this recipe and it was fantastic!!  My mom said it was even better than what my Great-grandmother made and that was pretty great!!  I made it for Thanksgiving and I am making it for Christmas dinner too!! My husband loved it!! Toasting the bread makes a big difference, it keeps the casserole from being soggy!! Soooo Good!

I have to say, this was awesome. Next time I will try splenda instead of all the sugar. It was very sweet...If your diabetic do not eat! I will be making this again I'm sure. Family loved it. I wanted to take some for work but it never made it out of the house. Thanks!

thanks for reviewing my recipe; great ideas!  i never really thought about adding anything to it, i love it so much the way it is.  i think that if you make it with whipping cream it will add too much more fat to keep the butter content at one cup, too.  the one thing i do to this recipe that VASTLY improves on it is make homemade wheat bread with stone ground wheat flour and use that for the toast.  thanks for the pic too!

This recipe should be called pineapple bread pudding not scalloped pineapple. "Scalloped" dishes do not have bread in them! Add a little Burbon sauce spiked with Malibu rum and you've got an awesome recipe for Pineapple Bread Pudding!

Made it for Christmas dinner.  It was very sweet.  Had a nice flavor, but was more like a dessert than a side dish with ham.  My family didn't really care for it.  I probably won't be making it again.

Pretty good although I have nothing to compare it to, I've never had bread pudding before.  I think if I make this again I might play with it.  I might add some cinnamon and some Malibu rum for a tropical taste.  I think it can be improved on, that is why it only got four stars.

I make this recipe all the time and absolutely love it.  I don't sprinkle the powdered sugar over the top, but other than that, I make this recipe exactly as originally written.  If there is any left over, it actually even freezes well, so I freeze in single-size servings and it's perfect to have on hand for the times you bring home a doggie bag from a restaurant, but it's not quite enough to fill you up--add your single serving of this pineapple dish and you then have a wonderful meal.

My husband and I did not like this at all, everything about it was totally unappealing from the way it looked, smelled, tasted and even the texture. Obviously the other reviewers enjoyed it so I guess there are some people out there who like this sort of thing. Not us.

I followed the recipe except I made two of the recommended changes by other reviewers.  I cut the sugar in half and added a touch of vanilla.  It was plenty sweet and had good flavor. But the consistency is very unpleasant.  I thought perhaps I had undercooked it so I returned it to the oven for an extra fifteen minutes.  That did nothing to improve the consistency. It's like eating wet undercooked eggs. I was embarrassed to serve it to my guests. They were polite but didn't accept seconds.
