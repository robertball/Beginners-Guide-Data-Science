I substituted coconut milk for 2 cups of the milk, and add 1 tsp of cinnamon. It was very good, but a little to sweet for me. Next time I make it I will half the sugar.

EXCELLENT! To save some time and trouble and a dirty dish....just melt the butter in the 9x13 while the oven is heating.

This was just like I remember when I was a kid!  I did add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon because I love cinnamon, and left out the raisins..because I don't like raisins.  Texture was perfect, and flavor wonderful!

This was soo good.  I used a can of lite coconut milk as part of the three cups of milk and it really added to the flavor.  With or without raisins, this is delicious!

This is excellent - the only change I made was substituting brown sugar for white sugar.  Yum... will make it again.

I scaled the recipe down to 6 servings & cooked it in an 8" by 8" pyrex dish. I used leftover rice from Chinese take-out, used coconut milk, subbed dried mangoes (snipped into raisin-size pieces w/ kitchen shears) for raisins, subbed dried ginger for nutmeg & probably should have subbed coconut extract for vanilla. I was afraid of the coconut flavor being overpowering but it was fine....I'll make the sub next time. I also decreased teh sugar a bit & won't next time... I like my puddings sweet.  I dished the pudding up into sherbet glasses & drizzled w/ a little cream of coconut. Thanks for the recipe...we enjoyed it!

So easy a dad can make it (take it from a dad). I had to make this a 2nd time to see if I didn't just get lucky the first time. It is super easy and very good!  We make extra rice now on purpose so I can use the leftovers for this recipe. Very popular in our home.  I skip the coconut and use cinnamon instead of nutmeg, but otherwise really love this recipe.   Thanks for sharing!

I tried this once and didn't have much luck with it.  The custard is hardly substantial enough to hold the rice and coconut together.  The flavor was fine but I prefer the presentation to be every bit as outstanding as the taste.  I'll move on to another rice pudding recipe perhaps with better results.

Just finished my first bowl of this. I'm not a rice pudding fan in general, so was apprehensive...but this was delicious. I usually find it far too sweet, so in preparation halved the amount of sugar (and used dark brown).  I upped the coconut and used cinnamon and cloves instead of nutmeg.

It's quite runny even after making sure the temperature was at 160 as directed, and sitting for 15 minutes before serving, so I'm hoping it firms up further as it cools.

Overall...simple to make with ingredients on hand and delicious.

Totally to die for. EVERYONE who has tried this raves over it!! I have served it warm at many parties now. It's so quick to mix together, so I mix it up right before I serve dinner. Then, while we are eating, the pudding is baking. After it comes out of the oven and cools slightly, I put a scoop in a pretty martini glass or other stemmed dessert glass, then a blob of fresh whipped cream (which starts to melt on the warm pudding making a delicious sauce) and then I top it all with a maraschino cherry. SO, soooo good!

I just made this recipe. I omitted the butter and just sprayed the pan with Pam. It was good and I agree it is a great recipe for left over rice. Very easy, too. The 4 of us felt like it was more like flavored rice and not like rice "pudding". We added cinnamon also.

I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup based on other people's recommendations that the recipe is too sweet.  The pudding was still very sweet.  I think I'd reduce it to 1/2 cup next time.  Also, there ended up being waaayyyy to many raisins for my preference.  I think next time, I'll reduce those to 1/4 cup, too.

Excellent and easy.  I've made this several times and it's as good, if not better, cold rather than warm.  My grandkids had leftovers for breakfast this morning and helped make a fresh one this afternoon for a snack.  We are gluten free and it's really nice to have a tasty, simple dish we all enjoy.  I made it as written the first time and it was way too sweet for our taste.  I now make it with 2/3 cup sugar and add the coconut to the mixture rather than putting it on top.  We also prefer it with cinnamon.  By spraying canola oil on the baking dish I can eliminate the butter and we actually prefer it without it.  I also agree with others that the title is misleading because it doesn't have the smooth creaminess of a cooked pudding.....but it's so good who cares?!  Make this today!

This is a semi firm pudding that will dish up like a loose cake.  Its not liquidy but doesn't need to be to be wonderful! I made it as directed except I stirred the coconut in instead of waiting to put it on top.  I love coconut and this one didn't need coconut milk to have the coconut flavor i crave.  I also liked that it used a lot of rice.  Excellent.

This was amazingly good.  I was hoping that it wouldn't be the creamy kind you get in the deli and it wasn't.  I misread the directions and put the coconut on top before ever putting it in the oven.  I don't think that hurt anything at all.  In fact, I didn't measure the coconut--more is better!  It reminded my of coconut custard pie filling without all of the calories or effort.  I also left out the butter completely and just sprayed the pan.  It still had a buttery flavor.  I cut the sugar down to about 2/3 of a cup and it was still plenty sweet.  I don't like teeth-screaming sweet!  I also left out the raisins--I never was a big fan, except in chicken curry or tossed salads--go figure!  I also left out the nutmeg but exchanged it for cinnamon.  I added a teaspoon of salt to the rice prior to cooking it and didn't add more to the dish.  I did need to bake it longer--about 20-30 minutes more.  It's an amazing flavor combination and I will be forever grateful.  My dad used to make rice pudding regularly and I've been trying to find a recipe that came close for decades now!  This not only came close; it surpassed my wildest expectations!  I will forever be in your debt!  I will never cook rice again without being sure to cook and extra 2 and 1/2 cups!

Pretty good. I made some changes: Decrease milk by 1/2 c, decrease nutmeg to 1/2 t, add cinnamon 1/2 t, add ginger 1/2 t, used brown rice. Sprayed my muffin tins and used a scant 1/2 c in each cup. Made 20 servings. Next time I will serve with a carmel sauce and whipped topping.

Delicious! This was rich, creamy and a great twist on traditional rice pudding. I added twice the amount of coconut, half in the pudding itself and the other half on top like the recipe calls for.I will make this again!

a great recipe! super easy and almost no prep time. I followed the other suggestions and added extra raisins, nutmeg and cinnamon, and decreased the sugar to 1/2cu to compensate for the extra raisins and because my coconut was sweetened

Very good the first time I made it.
Fantastic the second time with some 
adjustments. I omitted 1 cup of milk 
and the cup of sugar. I added a 
can of creamed coconut. And used pet 
milk instead of regular milk.  WOW!

This isn't really a pudding - it's more of an egg custard with rice in it.  Mine turned out watery, which I think is because I didn't use whole milk?  According to a google search, that could also be from cooking at too high of a temperature or for too long.  Also, be careful about when you add the coconut.  The top of the custard hadn't set by 30 minutes in the bad oven in my rental apartment, so when I sprinkled the coconut, it fell down into the wet custard and never became browned and crunchy.  Overall, I have to say I prefer my father's rice pudding, which has no eggs in it at all and involves lots and lots of stirring over medium heat on the stove top.  I only tried this recipe because it didn't involve so much stirring, but now I think I just wasted some good rice and milk!

Great rice pudding. I used craisins instead of raisins and added some slivered almonds.

This recipe brings back great childhood memories! I would call it Arroz con Dulce rather than rice pudding. I see that some people have complained about the texture; and, I believe that is from the "rice pudding" name, which has a consistency expectation that is not intended with this recipe. Some reviewers have used coconut milk, which would be a truer Arroz con Dulce, but this recipe gets thejob done with far fewer calories and much less fat. I used fat free margarine instead of butter, Egg Beaters instead of eggs, skim milk, and Splenda instead of sugar. It still turned out sweet and delicious!

Everyone loved it.  Didn't have nutmeg so used 1/2 teaspoon of  cinnamon.   Otherwise followed the recipe.   Might soak the raisins in a little rum the next time to add the rum flavor.  Otherwise this was well liked by a real rice pudding fan and even one who normally does not like rice pudding.  Also baking is so much easier than the cooktop reciepes.

We liked this pudding but would cut down on the coconut next time I make it. Or maybe sprinkle toasted coconut over the dessert dishes before serving.

Tasty and simple. It's one of my husband's favorites. I've never made it with raisins, and generally use a can of lite coconut milk as part of the milk, as others have suggested.

Cinnamon instead. Brown rice, short grain. A little dry. Good warm.

I would make this again because it is such a good way to use up left over rice. I added heavy cream b'cause that's what I had. I wish that I had used cinnamon instead of the nutmeg. We prefer that flavor.Next time I will and I would like to try coconut milk as well.

One of our favorite fall deserts. Prepare as directed for best results. I found that subbing coconut milk for some of the milk made the pudding not hold together as well and didn't really add much to the flavour.

This recipie did not work for me at all.  The cooking time was not correct and it took longer to cook.   The inside was still very runny after 30 minutes.  I am very disappointed that it did not turn out the way I thought is would.

This is a pretty good recipe. I followed it as directed with the exception of adding some white rum that I soaked the raisins in for a short while. I think the only thing that I wasn't too wild on was the texture; the coconut and possibly the egg created this top layer with the rice underneath. My tastes run towards a more homogenous sticky rice texture so I may try another recipe, but I think for what it is supposed to be, it is really good.

This is a wonderful recipe. It has the perfect consistency. The only changes I made were to add a 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins. I love dried cranberries and it just seemed more festive for the Christmas season. Thanks! I'll be making this one again.

I whipped this up as an alternative to the traditional Christmas pudding.  I substituted dried cherries for the raisins and it was delicious.  Very easy to make, too.

I've made this twice now.  The first time I didn't have any nutmeg so I put in just a little cinnamon.  I think I liked that better than the nutmeg (personal preference).  I left out the raisins, but added about a teaspoon of coconut extract.  I also broiled it at the very end to toast the coconut a little more.  Very easy and tasty.
