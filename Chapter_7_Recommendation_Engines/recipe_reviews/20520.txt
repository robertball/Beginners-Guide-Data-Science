I JUST served this for a 4th of July brunch. It was literally inhaled!!..lol

If I could give this MORE then five stars I would! Talk about a "wowzer" for company! Also... beyond SUPER FAST -EASY yet a real show stopper when served!! Lots of OOOOO's...and Ahhhhh's...lol


This is one of those unsung hero kind of recipes.  It's a wonderful base just waiting to be filled with whatever fruits your hearts desire!

I followed the recipe to the letter except for adding 1 t Mexican vanilla to the batter.  I used real butter and a glass 13x9 dish. It was cooked to perfection in exactly 20 min, but I KNOW my oven is right on the mark for temps.  

I had mashed up fresh Strawberries yesterday, and reserved a few whole for the top.  My company was HERE when it was pulled from the oven.  As it started to fall I poured the strawberries over it... topped it with whipped cream, laid out a few sliced berries on top, sprinkled it with powdered sugar, and a hint of cinnamon.  I put a small American flag right in the center.  No kidding... it was absolutey gorgeous!!! 

Next time I'm going to make it in two smaller dishes, and one will be filled with sweetened stewed apples/sour cream mixed with whipped cream and powdered sugar/cinnamon.  Other one will be served with the strawberry mixture. 

It looked like I had been working for HOURS and I'm not kidding you... it took less then 10 min to prepare this to pop into the oven!!

This variation is good. We've used a similar recipe in my family for years without the lemon and sugar. I usually make two - one with sausage, mushroom & cheese (sometimes green peppers) and a second with fruit pie filling (peach is our favorite.) If you melt the butter in the bottom of the pan before you add the ingredients it doesn't stick.

This was really good! Even my 2 year old enjoyed it. Like the other reviewers I did not use the lemon, my family doesn't like lemon flavorings.  I did saute some bananas in a little butter and brown sugar and topped half the pancake with this mixture. The other half I dusted with powdered sugar an drizzled with maple syrup. Yum! Keep in mind the pancake itself is bland, much like a pancake and crepe, it tastes like a mixture of the two.  I did add some vanilla extract to the batter as well. The most delicious parts are the golden brown edges that are slightly crisp from the butter.  If you have never tried an oven pancake, this may not be for you, but if you love crepes you will enjoy this. Bonus is it is SOOOOO easy and looks beautiful coming out of the oven.

Sehr gut! My family is very very German and we thought this would be an excellent venture for a morning breakfast.  There was a problem with it sticking to the bottom of the pan, even with the butter, so I am thinking that a dark-nonstick pan would suffice instead of an aluminum one.  Many layers, very fluffy and flavorful.  Try adding a variety of extracts into it.  I used almond this time, but you can try lemon, maple, vanilla or anything else that strikes your fancy.  The pancake will bring out its flavor beutifully.

Hubby made this for me for breakfast because I love German Pancakes. These were very comparable...maybe even better considering they have a lot of "cool" factor. They looked like top hats when they puffed up! He poured it into 2 8" cake pans & we topped one w/ the typical lemon & powdered sugar & one w/ Strawberries in Wine (from this site ... I used white zin & I did add a bit of chopped mint to the recipe) & whipped cream. Hard to pick a favorite, they were both excellent. Served it on the patio w/ orange cream mimosas (from the foodnetwork site).

I make this recipe for may family at least once a month. For my husband and I, I divide the batter into two round cake pans and bake up 2 individual Germans. We also use much more lemon and powdered sugar, and less butter than called for.

My husband is a diabetic so I make it a bit differently, but he LOVES this! I use WW flour & only 2 T butter. I added about 2 t lemon juice to the mixture & use skim milk. Skip the sugar. I microwaved a cut up apple with sugar free pancake syrup & my homemade pumpkin pie spice til soft. He loved that over this pancake. Said it was like a dessert. Thanks for the recipe!

Not a big fan of this one.  I have never had German pancakes, and I don't think I will make again.  It was very dense and very eggy.  It was also very bland (even with the syrup and fruit).  I think I will stick to my regular breakfast pancake.  Thanks anyway for the post.

This is a fantastic recipe. One thing I did differently was to bake it in a round 9" cake pan. Our local Pancake House serves it like this and each pan is an individual order. I serve it with fresh lemon wedges and powdered sugar. When my son's friends spend the night they request this for breakfast every time.

I have made this before and loved it.  I am so mad because I couldn't remember the name and just searched German pancake.  I made one of those recipes which called for 6 eggs.  They tasted awful compared to this.  Ugh!  I will be making this again soon and I am glad I finally remembered the name:)

Great recipe.  A little too much butter to be healthy, but you can substitute  olive oil for much of it and it still comes out fantastic. I only use about 2 tablespoons of butter now and 3 tablespoons of olive oil.  I also use a teaspoon of REAL vanilla extract..yummy!

I agree with the other reviewers, needs more vanilla and maybe lemon juice in the batter, and less butter.  I will try again, next time I will jazz it up a bit.  Different.

I've been making this for years.  In fact, I have a printed recipe from here from 2000 that had to be scaled down to use 6 eggs.  The directions are exactly the same wording but the ingredients are not the same.  Interesting but still a fabulous breakfast treat.  We always eat it with maple syrup.

This recipe is PHENOMENAL!!! OH my goodness, this is light and delicious breakfast NIRVANA!!! I added a teaspoon of vanilla, warmed up the eggs for five minutes before I used them, whipped them up prior to pouring them in the mixer and I heated the milk for about 20 seconds. While the batter was mixing, the pan was in the oven with the butter melting. About few minutes later I took the pan out of the oven with the now melted butter, (sprayed the sides of the pan with a quick spray of Pam) poured the batter on top and that was that. 17 minutes later I had a fabulous, puffed up German pancake. I covered it in lemon and powdered sugar and it was PERFECT!! My husband was thrilled!!! He said it was better than The Pancake House! That is high praise in our house!! In regards to people saying this was bland...I found that using salted butter kept it from blandness. This is a really simple, delicious way to start a Saturday morning!!

This was an excellent recipe.  I doubled it and fed my family of 6. I followed the recipe measurements precisely but sprinkled with granulated palm sugar/cinnamon.  I passed this recipe to my church family and several made it the very next day, all with rave reviews.  Reminded us of a cross between a pancake, donut and flan.  Will make this regularly.  Thanks!!!

This is a great breakfast treat! Easy to put together, and tastes even better when backed in a well seasoned iron skillet. :)

I thought this sounded too good to be true, and it was! This was absolutely delicious with lemon juice and powdered sugar sprinkled on top. 
Our four year old helped me make this and was so excited to taste something that "she made"! Hubby LOVED it and couldn't stop eating it, even plain. 
Next time, we will try half with fresh strawberries and whipped cream too.
Thanks so much for sharing this one...this is definately a keeper!

Easier to make than other german pancake recipes just because this recipe uses a bigger pan and you don't have to make several individual pancakes in seperate pans. Will use this in the future instead of other recipes.

For the topping we put on a layer of sourcream, sprinkle brown sugar over it, strawberries (frozen thawed), banana slices, and crushed pinapple over that. Even people that don't like sourcream can't taste it because of the brownsugar and fruit. This is our favorite breakfast on special occasions.

YUM! What a great idea for pancakes or french toast that usually takes forever to make one by one! This reminded me of a crepe/french toast. It's eggy without being overwhelmingly so. I skipped the lemon though - didn't appeal to me. We just used maple syrup and dusted with powdered sugar. I didn't believe that it only served 4 and I tried to serve 5 - nope! It really does only serve 4 - less if you're really hungry!

I made this recipe for a special 4th of July breakfast and everyone loved it. I also leftout the butter and used Pam. I used sliced apples and strawberries for the filling.

This has been our family favorite tradition for Christmas morning. One of our favorite toppings is thawed strawberries (the frozen kind in sugar) with a dollop of sour cream.

Dutch pancakes are so easy and the perfect breakfast for busy mornings.  I love them served with fresh fruit and pure maple syrup.  Half this recipe fits perfectly in a 7 inch cast iron skillet.

This was easy and fun to make.  The sides of the "bowl" rose up so high in my oven, the tops were touching the coils. It's very entertaining to see. I sliced up strawberries to put in the "bowl",  but I found just the lemon juice and powdered sugar added the perfect flavor. 

I will note that there was a shallow pool of butter in the bottom of my eggy pancake, which didn't bother me. I like buttery pastry, but I wanted to mention it.

My family has been making this for years and with the lemon and powdered sugar.  Everyone loves it.  We have found that they cook best in a buttered glass pie pan and each person gets their own plate size pancake....

My kids loved this version, especially with the lemon juice and sugar. I did the recipe x 1.5 and used a 9x13 pyrex and an 8x8 pyrex. They fit well.

This recipe is perfect!  We live at 7600 feet and the puff still works.  I believe the key is to use an iron pan, mix the eggs and milk first, then sift in the flour.  We used to have to drive an hour to a breakfast place that made these, but now we just wait till Sunday and make them.... much better than the restaurant!

Excellent recipe, much like the one that my Mom used to make.  I made two batches, one like the original here (with a tsp. of added vanilla extract and one additional egg) and the second with 12 cut up sausage links, whole chopped green pepper, 1/4 chopped onion, and a small can of olives.  Once out of the oven, served the "loaded" one with option of salsa and sliced jalapenos as a topping.  

I would recommend adding diced tomatoes to the mix as well as cheese as an additional topping option.

I liked it... it reminds me of a mixture between a pancake and french toast.. the lemon juice and powdered sugar on top gave it a nice sour contrast... very good... will make again.. and possible divide the batter between two round pans.... good recipes I am glad i tried them....

I have given this recipe many attempts, always convinced I am doing something wrong as I have read so many good reviews on this site and others.  I find it to be dense and egg-y, more like a heavy crepe than a pancake.  Maybe that's what a German pancake is but this failed in my attempt to find a Weekend Family favorite.  My kids wouldn't finish it even with powdered sugar or syrup.

WoW the whole family LOVED this. I love that I can sit down with the family to eat it with them unlike regular pancakes. I sliced up several different types of fruit to top it with. Thanks for the wonderful recipe, I have made this about 5 times now.

I have probably made this 30-40 times. It comes out wonderful if you read and follow the instructions. We just came back from or Lakehouse and I gave the last copy away. So I had to look it up and print some more copies. This is one of the best receipes on this site. Sure you can play around with the toppings and probably make it better to suit your taste. I normally make a starwberry topping and put whipped cream on it. As far as it not raising you have to melt the butter in the pan and then add the mixture. I always use a glass pyrex 9x13 and have never had a problem. I would like to thank JEANIE BEAN for sharing this wonderful receipe. Maybe some people have to have their oven calibrated. I promise if you follow the receipe people will want you to share it with them.

These pancakes are so close to my husbands grandmother who passed away. Not eggy at all. It's also similar as "Dutch Babies II" by babara_hengels, the only difference is the yield amount. So since it was just me and hubby eating, I halved the recipe (big germans that is) and used an 8x8 baking pan and cooked it for 10-13 minutes until slightly brown and crispy. I also drizzled it with lemon icing (AR recipe by Carol) which by the way was soooo good. And for those who had a problem with the sides browning first than the middle, try covering the sides with a foil and leave a 6x6 opening if using a 8x8 pan.

I tried this out minus the sugar and lemon juice. I also only use 3 eggs the second time, because I personally do not like eggs so it cuts down on the slightly eggy flavor. These are -very- easy to make, which is also good when you are cooking for kids! My daughter loves them just plain. It is true that they are bland, but that is the beauty of it. You can sweeten them as you go. I've also made some more savory version using a cup of shredded cheese, another big hit. They are very versatile. You can use all kinds of toppings depending on if you are going for sweet or savory. If you want to try something different for dessert, serve with a scoop of your favorite ice cream (we did cookies and cream). It is out of this world! You can also make them in smaller portions like mini pancakes, which I recommend. I'll be making them using whole wheat flour next.  Great recipe! It gives me a lot to play around with in the kitchen. Certainly a family favorite!

All I have to say is OMG!!!!! My boys loved this. They would give it 1 million stars if possible. I used maple sausage, eggs and cheese. It was amazing. I also made a second one with apple pie filling cinnamon and powdered sugar. Hubby and I loved watching it fall. This will definitely be put into the rotation. Thanks for sharing!!

This is actually a dutch pancake. A german pancake is flat and thinner than the amerikan version. But this is actually a dutch version. Must have been this little confusion with dutch normally meaning deutsch...but this time is actually means dutch. Good recipe and the picture really shows how it should look like. Super.

This is such a delicious, easy, and impressive dish to serve for breakfast!  We have it at least once a week, and sometimes more!  For a while, I was following the recipe exactly, but found that 1/2 the butter and a mix of 1/2 C AP flour and 1/2 C Whole Wheat flour tasted great, and made it a little more healthy.  I am very liberal with the lemon juice, and garnish this with sliced oranges.  My toddler simply calls this "pancake."  He has no idea what actual pancakes are because we have them so rarely!

Great tasting and super-easy breakfast.  I used a 10 inch cast-iron skillet rather than a baking pan (as it is shown in the picture) and mine came out looking just as gorgeous and with a lovely brown crust on the bottom and sides.  Instead of using lemon, I topped mine with a small can of Dutch Apple filling (I had been storing this impulse-purchase for some time, unsure what to do with it and THIS was the PERFECT solution!) and a dusting of powdered sugar.  A lovely change from savory egg dishes. Thank you!

This recipe was just o.k for us. I think next time I will try it with some fruit and some sweetened whipped cream. It was just a bit on the bland side, but not bad. I think there is room to improve on this and I will edit this review after I make it again.

This was great!  It had more of an egg flavor than I like but the texture was great.  We added unsweetened applesauce and powdered sugar and it was yummy.  the best part were the crispy brown pieces...can't wait to make again.

We tried this recipe the first time this morning and the kids loved it.  I recommend less butter, a non-stick baking pan, and more powdered sugar.

After reading the reviews I was really torn on how to proceed with this recipe.  My nephew whom I have not seen in 10 years brought his German wife to America for the first time this month after seven years of marriage.  I wanted to welcome her with some homecooked German food.  She loved these and some other German food recipes that I found on allrecipes, so for the people that have German relatives, give this a try.  Though she liked some of the American foods that I served she really disliked our fast food, fast dinner lifestyle.

This was very easy to make. I made it as an after school snack and cut it into squares then put whipped cream and sliced bananas on it for my kids.  It did have a very strong egg flavor.  It was good but they have not asked for it again so I don't know if I will make it again.

This recipe was easy as could be and very yummy.  My 3 1/2 yr old triplets inhaled it as did I.  I will definately be making this again and trying it with fruit and whipped cream on top.  This is a keeper.

This is just like the baked pancakes my mom used to make, delicious! I replaced half of the AP flour with whole wheat flour and added a little more milk, it turned out great.

We've been making this recipe for years.  We call it oven pancakes or puff pancakes.  We also like to serve it with jam.  My kids have all learned how to cook using this as one of their simple and succesfull meals to learn from.

Great!  My family liked it better than the shortcakes bought in a store for strawberries (I made individual servings using petite corningware).  Would also be good for holding roastbeef hash, pudding ect.

This was a great after-church brunch.  I divided the recipe between two 10 inch pie pans and cooked them the amount of time given.  To save time, I microwaved frozen baked cinnamon sugar apples to serve on top of it along with real maple syrup.  It looked so pretty when done--especially with the powdered sugar on top.  My husband ate an entire one!  Great served along with with maple flavored sausages.

This is very simple to make and pretty tasty too.  It actually seems to get better as you eat.  We didn't use the lemon juice.  We topped it with strawberries, powdered sugar and syrup.  I also added vanilla extract in the batter, about a teaspoon.  I think next time I will add some cinnamon also.  It was fun to watch as it cooked.  It is not something that I would want all the time, but if you are in the mood for something different this is highly reccomended!

My whole family loves these pancakes!  They are wonderful Saturday morning with fresh strawberries.  They have also become a favorite dessert in the evening with butter and powder sugar.  They are super easy to make and because they are done in the oven they leave room on the stove top for cooking up the rest of breakfast.  One of the few treats all 6 of us agree on!

Recipe was very easy, I did add vanilla and used Pam to spray pan(instead of 5Tbs butter), lowers calories but didn't effect taste I feel. apples and cinnamon on top were delicious.

I used the powdered sugar, but not the lemon and instead served apricot preserves and maple syrup as optional toppings.  I enjoyed a similar type of 'pancake' at a Bed and Breakfast during a trip to Washington. This was just as good and easy to  make! Thank you.

I like to split the recipe in half.  I pour each half into 8x8 pans.  One I leave as is and serve with strawberries and powdered sugar.  The other half I mix in things such as bacon, sausage, cheese, mushrooms, etc.  Both bake with normal directions and are DELICIOUS!!

I use this recipe, but with the 1/8 tsp salt and the 6 eggs  (sometimes as many as 8) from German Pancakes II recipe and generally omit the confectioners' sugar.   The whole family loves it.

This was my first attempt at making this type of pancake and it was great. This is such an easy recipe. I would, however, either cut back on the amount of salt or use unsalted butter. I'll definitely be making this again and experimenting with different toppings, both sweet and savory.

This was wonderful I added cinnamon & vanilla to my batter. I also topped with caramelized brown sugar & bananas. Then I sprinkled it with powdered sugar. This would probably also be good topped with blueberry pie filling :) 
My only complaint is the amount of butter used ... I will try to half it next time I make this.

I liked this recipe but there is definitely too much butter for my taste. My family is SUPER picky and none of my 3 kids or my husband liked it. I may try to make again for company and use less butter.

Awesome awesome! I've used a couple other German pancake recipes on this site and was not getting the puffy results I wanted. This is the one that worked, and my entire family loved it! Since I love sweet, I added a tablespoon of honey. Instead of the lemon glaze, I used a yummy sauce that consisted of butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and cream. Oh yum!

Oh my gosh, delicious!  I prepared as directed, divided the dough in half, and added cinnamon and sugar to half the batter.  I put the two batters in two different 9 in cake rounds. When they were done, I put sausage and cheese in one and put it back in the oven with the broiler to melt the cheese.  We added strawberries and powdered sugar to the other.  Simply awesome! Great texture.  Pretty easy!  Will definitely be making again!

Turned out perfect! I put my 12" cast iron skillet in the oven when I turned on the oven, so the skillet would be good and hot. Key...eggs need to be at room temp. I warmed my milk then mixed in my room temp eggs. Mixed in the flour and salt. Let rest until oven was warmed. Pulled out cast iron skillet added butter to pan, let melt, then added batter, returned to oven,baked 15min. It was perfect! Don't open oven door it let's out the heat.

I preheated my oven to 400f with a large cast iron skillet in it while it was heating, made my mixture and then added the butter and to the skillet and bake for 35 mins. It turned out much lighter and not so eggy, also added 1/2tsp vanilla extract to boost flavor and aroma, absolutely delicious! Thank you very much for the recipe, very happy man!

I worked at a resturant in Denver when I was younger that had these. I just started making them at home a few weeks ago and we can't get enough. There are a few different textures going on. It's really cool how they climb up the sides of the pan but, must be served right away because they start to collapse as soon as they are removed from the oven. Great for guests. They will be immpressed.

Delicious and so easy to make. The hardest part of this was the waiting time while it baked. I used a 9 inch deep dish pie plate and it worked great. My favorite part of this was the browned fluffy edges but the thick dense solid custard looking center where the pool of butter was sitting was great too. I like this with the lemon juice and added even more after tasting it. I didn't have plain milk so I used canned condensed milk. I never really cared much for this dish in the past, but this time I really liked this so Thanks for the great recipe!

This was great, and very easy to make. One thing; when the butter melted in my glass pan and I poured in the batter, i was so nervous because my batter was enveloped in melted butter. In the end, although most of the butter was soaked, i still had a lot of butter remaining on the top that i had to drain off. Overall, although not healthy, it's good and you have a lot of freedom with your toppings-- good treat for once in a while. I used a cinnamon sugar topping, and a peach topping.

This was amazing served with 'Blueberry Sauce' from this site! This recipe is similar to a pancake in that you probably wouldn't just eat it plain. I will definitely make this next time we have breakfast guests. The only change I made was to sprinkle cinnamon on top along with the lemon and confectioners sugar.

I'm giving this four stars for the flavor and how easy it is to prepare, but I can't give it five stars because it didn't rise! I followed the directions exactly, but the center stayed flat while the sides rose up a bit and started to turn brown.  I'm pretty sure it's a cooking temp. issue so I'll be playing around with the oven to see if I can get it right, but man was it a bummer when I looked in the oven :(

Was super easy to make but didn't quite work out.  It started to puff just around the edges and then started to brown while the center was still flat as could be.  I think I might have used too much butter or didn't let it cook long enough.  Maybe it was because I used whole wheat flour.  I'll try again with all purpose and see what happens.

These pancakes are fabulous!  I add a dash of vanilla to the mix, and split the mix between two 9" pie pans so we can each have our own.  Make sure you bring your friends/family into the kitchen to see how beautiful they are all puffed up - they'll deflate before you hit the table.  Easy to make and always in demand on Sunday morning!

WOW...delish! Quick & easy to use blender for mixing. I followed directions exactly, but instead of 5 tablespoons of butter I sprayed a 9" glass pie plate with olive oil spray and then put 2 tablespoons of smart balance light and melted. Poured batter on top after butter melts and WA-LA.  We topped with cherry pie filling and powdered sugar. Can't wait to make for my husband...YUM!!!

We made the BIG GERMAN in place of our usual Sunday morning pancakes (much to my family's alarm), and...it was a huge hit!  My husband prefers this dish over both pancakes and waffles and the kids said they were equally good.  I followed the recipe as written and used the lemon juice, but next time will probably try some kind of fruit or other filling.  Thanks for the great recipe!

this was the first oven pancake I've tried and I really enjoyed it, the only thing I didn't like is there was way too much butter, and it still kind of stuck, but other than that it was crispy and light.

This was quick and easy to throw together.  It's surprising to see what it looks like when it comes out of the oven!  I sprinkled powdered sugar and squeezed lemon on it.  Nice and light.

I make these every once in a while.  The first we tried it we didn't care for the lemon juice and sugar.  The next time i made these we used homemade chokecherry jelly. WOW.oh WOW!!!  The kids couldn't get enough.  I use my cast iron skillet and it works great!  Just writing this review makes me want to go make some for supper!

This was pretty good - I think I could've left it in the oven for a few more minutes so next time I will... Tastes almost like French toast in a fun presentation.  I tried it with the lemon juice and powdered sugar but ended up drizzling on some maple syrup too!  Fun, easy breakfast treat!

Aunt Svea was a wonderful Swedish cook. I followed her around the kitchen trying to write down her recipe for "Oven Pancakes."  I thought her recipe was gone when she passed away, because she never measured. It was always "a pinch of this and a dash of that." BUT THIS IS AUNT SVEA'S RECIPE! To Jeanie Bean, submitting this recipe -- Thank You!!

Yum!  I've made these twice already.  These are really good for something different for breakfast on the weekends or for when you have breakfast for dinner.  We used applesauce and cinnamon sugar as a topping.  Mmm!  Thank you!

Well, what do you know, it's a German pancake! Lol. My family and I have been making this for years - we just called it a  French pancake. Anyway, we always mix it up in a blender or food processor. We melt the butter in a cast iron skillet in the oven, then pour in the batter. We save the salt for last and sprinkle it on top of the batter before putting it in th e oven. It always bakes up with a nice tall, golden crust around the edge. We then sprinkle the top with a healthy (or perhaps unhealthy) dose of powdered sugar and a good sprinkle of nutmeg. Serve it up with syrup! My father is the only person I have met so far who didn't like it. Go figure.

Love it!  I added the sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg cause we're snowed in and can't get whipped cream.  It will be what we will be making when we have company at Christmas time!

This ia a fantastic recipe. I used "Microwave Lemon Curd" and powdered sugar instead of the lemon juice. It makes my taste buds sing.

just as I expected. I added white sugar in the batter before baking, though, because we like it a little sweeter (I think about a 1/4 cup). 
Also works using vanilla soymilk instead of regular.

Although this puffed up nicely and was served immediately, it turned into a big rubberish hunk on my plate.  It was the only thing left at brunch.  Who knows, maybe I did something wrong?

Just made this last night for dinner and my hubby LOVED them. We put sour cream and strawberry jam on them. Oh so good. I didnt find them to be like scrambled eggs at all. I too added a bit more sugar. I will make these again. They are super duper easy. Thanks!

Excellent.  I used 3-4 Tblsp butter, and probably ended up with more sugar on it.  I might have had to cook mine a little longer than directed.  If you're looking for pancakes this isn't for you; this is more like doughy scrambled eggs.

I am always searching this site for a great pancake/crepe recipe. This, I thought, had promise. I cut the butter back as others suggested, I used 2 tablespoons.  I found the pancakes very dense with too much egg. I made these twice, I won't make again.

My husband was so excited when he saw me making this...it triggered a childhood memory.  A German family friend used to make these for him and his brothers.  The only complaint I have is that the butter sat on the top and looked unappealing - and fattening.  Next time I will use much, much less.  Other then that this was a delicious breakfast served with the "Sauted Apples" recipe from this site.  This will be a regular Sunday breakfast in our home.

Wow!  This was a great Saturday morning breakfast for the family.  I made two batches and filled one with a quart of fresh strawberries that I quartered and covered with sugar and let juice up while the pancake baked.  The second I topped with the lemon juice and powdered sugar and served with extra maple and/or blueberry syrup.  The kids and their friends gave this recipe a “thumbs up”.  Hubby coined it as a healthy alternative to a funnel cake.  Big Germans will definitely be a Saturday morning regular!

The family loved these, I doubled the batch (to feed 7) and they cleaned me out! I gave the kids an option of strawberries, or bananas and walnuts. The only thing that was iffy for me was they seemed a little chewy? But they tasted fantastic!

YUM YUM YUM!!!  This is a definite keeper!  The whole family loved them.  I baked it in 2 pie tins.  I found that unsalted butter works best because it doesn't turn brown when it's melting at that high temperature.  I've also substituted margarine when I didn't have butter on hand.  And lastly, I've cut down to 2 Tbsp. butter/margarine per pie tin (total of 4 Tbsp. for the recipe.)   If fresh strawberries aren't available, try making the Supreme Strawberry Topping using frozen strawberries (recipe found on this web site)

I've been looking for a recipe for these puffy pancakes for ages, and I've tried several that claimed to be it, but weren't.  Finally!!  This is it!!  They're delicious.  I divided the batter into 2 pie plates before baking and it made it easier to serve for me, plus more of the puffy sides that my family loves the best.  Thanks so much for posting it!!

Just like the German Pancakes from the local pancake house.  Now I can make them at home.  Delicious and easy to make.  I make them healthier by using egg substitue instead of whole eggs.  Still takes great, but it has a little different texture.  I also mop up the extra butter with a paper towel before eating to cut down on the fat content.

This was so easy and everyone was impressed. I did cook it a little longer to make sure it wasn't soggy in the middle, and it came out really well...add some syrup, and it's an impressive breakfast offering with fruit on the side.

Great recipe, easy very pretty presentation and delicious. I added some sliced peeled apples on top with a sprinkling of cinnamon sugar. Just delicious. Going to be my Christmas morning breakfast.

Outstanding!  Exactly what I was looking for.  For those that found it slightly eggy, I will agree but it was hardly noticable topped with stewed apples.  The extra syrup in the apples sank in and covered up the eggy-ness fine.

These were pretty good...not too eggy I didn't think. I must say however, if you are going to use whipped cream...put it on the individual pieces you cut because it makes this dish go very soggy. Otherwise...not bad...kids loved it and hubby said it was ok.

the only rising agent was eggs so i knew this would be rich.  it tasted like frech toast.  used sauted apple recipe from this site and it was great.  I halfed the recipe and made in an 8 inch cake pan, them removed onto a plate to eat.  Good presentation.  Make this one for guests.

Hmmmm, this sure was *interesting*. I didn't care for it one bit. It was thick and VERY eggy. My girls ate it and thought it was okay. I topped them with lemon juice, powdered sugar and strawberries. I will not be making this again.

I've been using this recipe for a long time now and thought I'd give credit where credit is due. It's one of my son's favorites. Easy peasy for a yummy breakfast. Sometimes I add fruit for a sweet one, sometimes I add ham and swiss cheese for a savory one. And then, of course, sometimes I just leave it alone and eat it in its purest form with powdered sugar and lemon juice. Good stuff.

My college roommates mother used to make these whenever we visited. These were very yummy, the whole family loved it. I used soy milk and added a little vanilla and topped it off with the powdered sugar and fresh fruit.

I forgot to add Vanilla, and it was ever so slightly overcooked, my son ate it with just butter, and he enjoyed it. I used butter, lemon and powdered sugar on mine, so good! Now I'm thinking of making a warm raspberry topping to put on it.

Very good.  I didn't think we would like the lemon but we loved it! We still used maple syrup too, old habits die hard.  This was way easier than standing in front of the stove, flipping pancakes!

here's how I made this - I used my 10 inch cast iron skillet and put it in oven and preheated to 475 - while heating I made the batter and added a pinch of nutmeg - when oven gets to temp - lower temp to 425 and CAREFULLY remove very hot skillet - add butter till melted, add batter and bake for 15 - 20 minutes

Next time I will cut recipe in half for two people but the cast iron skillet is the key - When it comes out butter and put in lemon juice and powdered sugar to make a glaze - fill with fresh cut strawberries and blueberries
UPDATE: I now make this with 3 eggs, 3/4 cup flour, pinch of salt, pinch of nutmeg,  1 cup of milk , only 2 tbs of butter- everything else  the same - it creates a less bulky pancake - perfect every time

Just made this for Mother's Day and it turned out FANTASTIC! made it exactly as the recipe calls for (minus the lemon and sugar topping) - instead I made a raspberry/blackberry/strawberry compote with real whipped cream for the topping....it came out very light and like something in between a crepe and a pancake, perfection with the topping! Also, the way I did it was to split the batter into 4 pie pans so each one of us could have an individual dish and t looked beautiful!

It's fantastic!  I used to make this for my kids. Just me know on made smaller batch. Didn't change anything except the topping. Put some strawberry jam in the microwave for about 30-40 seconds. Makes a great syrup.

This is my favourite recipe for oven pancakes. My kids call them "snow pancakes" because of the sprinkled icing sugar at the end. Whole family loves them and they are great for a casual brunch with friends. I serve them up with lots of berries and some yogurt on the side.

Replaced all purpose flour with whole wheat. After baking I divided it up so kids got syrup on their serving. For mine I added shredded Monterey jack cheese and topped with green chilles with some Frank's Red Hot sauce. Yummy breakie for all.

I make this as a special weekend breakfast at least once a month, and it is always SO delicious. I started using this recipe because it only uses 4 eggs, when my previous one used 6, and I have never looked back. I usually add some cinnamon and vanilla directly into the batter, which is very yummy. Most of the time it rises impressively and looks great, but I would say that maybe 2 or 3 out of 10 times it doesn't rise up. I don't know why that happens, but even then, the taste is the same - very good!! The concept of there being any "leftovers" of this dish is absolutely inconceivable.

I have made this several times and it's always great except the time I used a 9x13 pan. I always use a cast iron skillet like the picture. The 9x13 is too large and difficult to grease adequately. A good addition to this recipe is sautéed apples on the side.

I made this last night as a quick sweet dinner and I wasn't disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted lactose free milk and butter.
Doubling the batter, I made two pancakes. They took exactly 20 minutes to bake and they puffed up to enormous proportions. It looked spectacular! Everyone oohed and ahhed as it came out of the oven!
I chopped some fresh strawberries in advance and sprinkled them with sugar. We had nice sweet strawberries and syrup to put on top, along with some lactose free whipped cream. On the table I put a bottle of lemon juice and a shaker with some powdered sugar.
Let me tell you, the taste was heavenly! It was very similar to eating strawberry shortcake, except with very little effort. I'm going to be making this again and again!

Mrs. liked this.  I felt it was ok. A tad too much butter perhaps.  I used unsalted in this recipe.  Will make it again since she seemed to enjoy it.

I just took it out of the oven and it was delicious! I did add 1 teaspoon vanilla and served it with real maple syrup instead of the lemon, its divine! I used only real butter and added the butter to a cast iron skillet and put it the oven during the pre heat, the butter melted and browned before I added the batter... The Dutch Baby Pancake rose beautifully and did not stick to the skillet. This recipe will be a keeper!

This has been my family's go to oven pancake for just over ten years! My husband is German, and this is his favorite! We sometimes fill the center with fresh berries and whip cream, but our favorite is the lemon juice and powdered sugar. We often double it and place it on a large baking sheet if we're having guests. Perfect for a before school breakfast for kids because it is so quick and easy to make!

I used a cast iron pan (following what others put in the reviews) but that was a bad idea the sides were getting too done while the center wasn't, next time I will use a 9x13 like the recipe states. I had to cut off the sides and bake longer for the middle to get done would work in a cast iron pan if use a pyrex pie pan along with it so it cooks all the way.

Easy, quick recipe. Don't forget the butter in the pan! The first time I made this I couldn't get it out of the pan and I think this was the problem. Every time I've made it sense it's been perfect. I like to add a little vanilla and sprinkle some cinnamon on top, but it is a good recipe on its own.

This was pretty good, but not as good as another recipe that I rated 5 stars. I actually made this three times over several weeks. I found that 18 minutes was about the right baking time for me. I made it exactly as written. I guess I found this too eggy for my taste, though. But I did like that I learned from this recipe that lemon juice and powdered sugar are some traditional toppings for this dish - it added something extra that the other recipe didn't have.

The pancakes were very tasty and tender inside but were dark on the outside. I think I made a mistake by using two 9" cake pans. I guess I should have known better. Please only use glass or prytex.

AWESOME!!! Doubled the recipe and put it into 3 pie plates and baked for 18 minutes.  My boys scarfed them up with no lemon but powdered sugar, butter and syrup.  Will make again for sure.  P.S. I only had 7 eggs but it still was great, the germans were just a little thicker than normal
