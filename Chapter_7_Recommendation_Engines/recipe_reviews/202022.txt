I love how easy this is with super simple ingredients. Almost a buttermilk flavor and with all this lettuce, one I'll do over again. Great timing. Thanks for sharing cooks4forty!

Was not for us.  Tasted like milk, vinegar, and sugar. Maybe try it with rice vinegar?

Although I thought it was good, hubby thought it was too tangy.  I would probably add less vinegar the next time I made it.
I made this again but added about 1/4 cup of mayo.  And it was just right for us.
