Omitted the pine nuts because I didn't have any and added some chopped cucumbers because I love them! Good combo of flavors, caesar dressing was a little heavy... tasty but heavy. Might try a vinagrette to make it more summer-y. Still very good!

This is an excellent salad. I tweaked it just a bit though. I roasted two ears of corn on the grill and cut the corn off the cob. I also used two avocados....cuz we love them :)  I tossed all the vegis with dressing, minus the the romaine and then served them over the romain. By the way, this will not take an entire bottle of dressing. Just eye it and add accordingly.

I thought it was a good salad. And it was different, which is nice when you eat a lot of salads. It would be good with chicken or steak on it too, if you wanted it for a full meal, rather then a side salad.

My husband and I enjoyed this salad.  I made it exactly to specifications and everything was great, except it was a little bland.  I sprinkled some Season All over the salad and that did the trick!

This recipe was alright, but nothing special. I made no changes to the recipe and felt it was sort of bland. It could have been the dressing I used. I do not plan on making this again. My boyfriend did enjoy the recipe but said the leftovers were uneatable.

We love salad, but we really didn't care for this, the corn and pine nuts did not go well together.

Agree roasted corn is better. Didn't add dressing, let family use their favorites. Good side dish.

Was a good salad. We only had creamy Caesar, but I think I'd prefer ranch dressing next time.

This was OK.  Nothing special.  Also, the I think the calorie and fat content is very high for a salad.  I may have to think twice before trying (and tweaking) it again.

I have made this salad many times, just love it!!!!  I made a couple changes.  You MUST toast the pine nuts for their full flavor to come out!  I also use ranch dressing and mix it all up with fresh spinach leaves! AWESOME!!!
