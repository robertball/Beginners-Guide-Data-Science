If you're looking for a quick recipe, this one is not it. At least for the time invested, the cookies come out looking great and tasting just as good. I plan on giving my as Chirstmas presents, which hopefully will make a good impression!

This recipe didn't work at all.  There wasn't enough liquid to make a dough so I started adding a little more rum until there was, at which point, the butter started melting and then it was too wet.  Maybe if you mix with your hands to melt the butter and add a little more rum than called for it might work.  I tried baking them anyway, but they really didn't taste all that interesting, so it wasn't worth trying to save the rest of the dough.  Just kinda like chocolate cookies.  And mine came out looking more like brown pretzels than crowns anyway.
