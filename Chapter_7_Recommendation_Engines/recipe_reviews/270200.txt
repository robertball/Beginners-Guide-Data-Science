Really good! Could use a bit more filling and mine were a little dryer than I would have liked, but the flavor and instructions were excellent!  Thanks for your contribution!

I made a few changes to this easy recipe.  I couldn't find fresh cranberries, so I used dried ones instead.  In making the filling, I eliminated the nutmeg, but added 1 C. chopped pecans plus 1 C. brandy to make up for not having the fresh fruit.  The filling. pastry, and icing all turned out great.  Delicious outcome.  Will be sending some of these to several friends in the USA and Canada.

Pretty straightforward....not difficult but really fun to make! I want to try the recipe with cinnamon instead of the cranberry-orange. I certainly will use this recipe again!

I used brown sugar Splenda instead of sugar so they were a bit dry, but with the icing no one noticed but me!  My husband thought they were unbelievable!

I really enjoyed them. My boys and husband still prefer regular orange rolls, but they liked these too. I did, however, check my orange roll recipe and see how much zest it called for, which was 2 oranges' worth instead of 1 TBSP, so that is what I ended up doing because I wanted a more orangey flavor and I'm glad I did. I also put more orange juice (the full squeezed orange) in the cranberry sauce and just let it reduce a little more. And because I love cream cheese frosting I added 2 oz of cream cheese to the glaze posted here and it was delicious!

This was a great and flavorful recipe. A bit time consuming, but if you're up for the challenge and love to bake/cook...you'll really enjoy it! *Used CrasisinsÂ® to substitute for fresh cranberries.

I love the tart of the cranberries.  Lot of work but good directions helped made the recpie easier. I wrapped them lightly  in plastic wrap for the last proof.

I cut the recipe in half. I did not like the way the dough turned out. I seemed to be more like a bread dough. Otherwise it was a very good combination . Will definitely make again  with a regular sweet roll dough recipe.

Very pretty!! We LOVE cranberry and oranges in anything, so they were a hit in our house!  The only change I made was to the glaze.  I used orange juice in place of the cream, as we wanted a little more orange flavor.
