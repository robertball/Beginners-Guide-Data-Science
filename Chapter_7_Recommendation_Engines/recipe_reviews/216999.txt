At first I was not blown away by the flavor- which there is plenty of- but as I was eating this the symphony of flavors were playing on my palette and I realized I really liked it.  I made double the recipe without doubling the oil.  I used chicken bouillion instead of vegetable broth (that's just what I had on hand).  Also for some reason I imagined the directions had said to finely julienne the carrots, so I shredded them in a food processor instead of slicing them.  I didn't have lime juice either.  Otherwise I kept to the directions and it turned out great.  There were no leftovers.  My family loved it and at least one person had extra helpings.  :)

This was good and I will make it again, but with less oil. I will put the vegetables in at the same time as the broth, quinoa and spices, so they aren't overcooked. I think it needs one more spice, I'm just not sure what that is. I will also use a bit more onion and a bit less lime juice next time.

Easy to make!  If anything, the amount of turmeric and lime juice should be cut down, but otherwise you get used to the taste!  Thanks for the recipe!

Great meatless dish! I used chicken broth instead of vegetable stock, I added a pinch of cumin and just a pinch of turmeric, much better flavor.  And forgot to add the lime and still I devoured it!

This is a really good recipe. I cubed the carrots & actually liked the veggies on the softer side (in response to the reviewer who suggested not pre-sauteeing the vegetables). Level of turmeric was just right & the lime juice added a nice brightness right at the end. I'm hoping no one eats the leftovers so I can have them for lunch today!

I really enjoyed this recipe and I have been using it as a base to experiment with.  My flavorite so far was adding 2 leafs of shredded cabbage (which I cooked 1st for a few mins), i also added thinly sliced asparagus.  I use fresh basil which I add at the end during the simer.  And I don't add salt at all...the veggie broth is loaded with sodium. Oh and I also used half red quinoa, half white. Yee-Haw good stuff...wife gave me a check in the plus column she did ;P

This was really good.  I used curry powder and a pinch of cumin; I don't know much about turmeric, so I just picked something I thought would go with the other ingredients.  It made more than 3 servings, though.  More like 6 or 7 for what my family eats.

Nice quinoa recipe, very good with a subtle flavour, nothing too overpowering.  I used organic red quinoa - it was a nice healthy and colourful dish!

We love this recipe around my house! I just made it for the second time, I doubled the recipe, to be sure there'd be leftovers!
Both times I've made this almost exactly to the recipe, so I don't really recommend any changes. The first time around I made it with beef bullion, dissolved in (water per the directions on the package)since that's all I had, and it turned out a bit too salty. This time I used beef bullion again (no other broth on hand)but used 3/4 of a cube in the same amount of water, and it was perfect. 
I used probably a little more veggies than the directions call for - extra celery, for sure, since I love it. My toddler loves this, I love it, and any guests we have over gobble it up, too, even those afraid of a big bowl of quinoa and veggies!! This is now a staple for us!

I switched it up for my traditional(not spicy, boring) family.  Instead of the turmeric, I used stuffing spices, sage, marjoram and thyme.  I ended up cooking it for about 40 minutes as well as most of the people eating it had never had quinoa before and I wanted it to have more of a softer texture.  I had 2 requests for recipes and the rest liked it so I will definitely be making this again!

Great! Whole family loved it - even the kids.  I was tight for time so cooked quinoa in stock and mixed together at the end.  Probably better as vegetables still had a little crunch.

Made tonight and we really enjoyed it, just felt like there was a little something missing. Will make again but will have to play with seasoning. Really good though.

Very flavorful dish that I whipped up at the last minute.  I didn't have much quinoa left and was looking for a recipe that would work well as a side dish.  I didn't have chicken broth, but used water and added 3/4 tsp salt.  I also didn't have celery so left that out.  It certainly didn't taste like it was missing anything.  I also didn't have tumeric, but going off of suggestions from other reviewers, I added 1 part cumin to 2 parts curry powder.  The flavors blended very well.  I also might add that I agree that cutting the oil in half is about right. I definitely will make this again!

Made the recipe exactly as written, except I didnt have any turmeric.  substituted curry powder in the same proportion.  It was excellent and will get added into the rotation.

Very flavorful, pretty, and tastes healthy. I didn't have lemon juice so I squeezed half a lemon on it instead. I liked the tangy flavor it added.

This was delicious! And easy! The only changes I made: I added cumin instead of the lime juice, as another reviewer said, and I used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock.

I didn't realize I didn't have onions or garlic until I started cooking (of course!), nor the lime, but it turned out delicious anyway!  Hubby and I both loved it and I'll absolutely make it again.  I'm curious to see what the lime does to the taste, and I can see how garlic and onion would give the dish a more well-rounded flavor.  Quite yummy!  I'm happy to have another way to prepare quinoa!

I really enjoyed cooking this and it was easy.

This was my first time using turmeric. My roommate and I both noticed right away our tongues tingling from it. It went away soon after eating. Not a bad thing..just weird.

Texture: mushy
Flavor: strong and bland at the same time.

I would give this another try and replace some of the turmeric with something spicy and add some chicken or texture of some sort.

My kids and I really liked this. I used water because I didn't have vegetable stock and needed to add more salt. I also used fresh basil instead of dried, so I tripled the amount called for. I toasted the quinoa in a pan over medium heat for a few minutes before adding it to the sauteed veggies, than I added the spices and stirred before adding the water. It took around 30 minutes to absorb the water.

I modified the recipe to give it a bit more kick and freshness.  I added a couple of Thai bird chiles, fresh (not dried) basil, lemon juice (rather than lime), and like others have noted, I used a mandolin to julienne the carrots.

This is a simple, easy recipe with great flavor.

i'm going to add pine nuts next time.

So far, I have not been a huge fan of quinoa, but this recipe might change my mind.  It is easy to prepare and quite tasty.  I have to admit that I did not use turmeric because I did not have any in the house, but I used curry instead and it is very tasty.  I will try this again with the turmeric and who knows what other variations I can come up with.

OMG!!!! This was absolutely delicious! My first time making quinoa! I wanted something that will go great with grilled lemon pepper chicken and sautéed green beans, and this was perfect. Only change I made was omitting the lime juice, only because it tasted great as is. highly recommended:)

Not one complaint from the family on this one!  Doubled the mushrooms as mentiioned by other reviewers and used half baby bellas/half regular mushrooms. The mushrooms were fantastic. I used chicken breasts that weren't quite thawed went they went in the oven, and the 45 minutes was perfect for cooking them; very moist.  If using completely thawed chicken, I'd cut the cooking time down by 10 minutes to keep them from drying out.

This was excellent. I made a couple of small changes: I diced all the vegetables quite finely before sauteeing. I added some red pepper, and I substituted green onions for regular onions, to add a bit of color. I increased the bouillon to 1.5 cups, and increased the quinoa to 3/4 cup, in order to make this a 4-serving recipe.  My husband has never cared for quinoa but he LOVED this.

This is now in permanent rotation in our house.  had a bag of frozen miripoux so i used that in place of the initial veggies, toasted the quinoa.  I followed other reviewers suggestion and added 1 t cumin.  I went light on the turmeric.  I also added peas and will likely add additional various veggies.

Surprisingly good.  I used the juice from half a lime and didn't have celery so used some mushrooms.  Double the recipe if you want leftovers--was enough for 1 meal for 2 people.  If you use vegetable bouillon to make your broth, I'd suggest 1 teaspoon bouillon. Add some beans to make it a full meal.

The recipe turned out great and tasted wonderful the first time. 
Another time I prepared the recipe up until the final simmering. I placed it in a casserole and put it in an oven at 200f and stirred the casserole and served it at a pot luck 2 hours later. It worked great.

Loved this savory side dish.  Especially good with baked chicken.  Quick,  and easy prep. Great size for just two but will double when serving more.  
 Looking forward to trying as a main dish with Italian lamb sausage added.

This quinoa was as described; simple and savory.  I found the tumeric and basil fit nicely and the lime just topped it off.  The quinoa was done in 15 minutes for me.  I added an additional small purple carrot for more color and a half rib of celery additional as I wanted more vegetables.  We ate this with some fresh grilled white fish and it was a good combination.  Since this dish has a grain and vegetable, I served only this item with the fish and it worked well for taste and presentation.  I will also serve it with grilled chicken in the future.

Very tasty! I made this without the basil and lime juice as I didn’t have any on hand and used rosemary and lemon juice instead. I packed it for lunch to have at work and really enjoyed it. I will make this again using the proper ingredients it’s a nice way to dress up quinoa. Thank you for the recipe.

I will be making this again, again... and again. I boiled some collard greens with onion and garlic on the side, drained and added to my serving. Tumeric really gives it a nice flavor with the lime/ lemon. Added some white pepper for a kick of spice. Delicious.

VERY tasty. This is a great recipe even if you don't have all the ingredients on hand. I didn't have vegetable stock so substituted water, didn't have dried basil or turmeric or lime juice, so added a dash of cumin, oregano, and pepper for seasoning. It was delicious, I didn't want to stop eating.

I liked this and used a little less than the tsp of Turmeric because other reviews thought it was to much. It's a strong flavor for me so I might just use 1/2 a tsp next time. I used lemon juice instead and bumped it up to 1 tblsp because I couldn't taste 1 tsp. I also added peas that I took out of the sugar snap peas that I had on hand. I added these at the same time  I added the quinoa.

Not bad.  Not good, but with some added salt and maybe some chilis, it would be.  This is a keeper, but needs some altering.

My only suggestion for improvement is just to double the spices. Mild flavors are for some folks, but definitely not for me! Especially double the curry powder and you'll have a great-tasting quinoa dish.

I love this recipe! This is the first time I've made a quinoa dish that tastes great and is vegan.

I've been looking for ways to cook quinoa that tasted GOOD, not too earthy. This recipe did it!  I served it with black beans, acorn squash, and salted avocado slices. Killer meal.  I am not vegan but this would serve as an A plus vegan meal. My teenagers gave it a thumbs up and even suggested we use it in a wrap or taco.

I made it for 12 servings and ended up adding a third cup of Quinoa because it wasn't cooking down. Either way it was a big hit. I also added two red bell peppers and minced all the vegetables so everything was smaller in it. I had several people asking for the recipe, Thanks.

Smells great while cooking. Sauteed onion and garlic with the spices (totally forgot about the celery) and added 1/2 tsp curry powder and 1/2 tsp cumin with it. I actually ran out of carrots so I used frozen California mix minus the broccoli because I feel carrots and cauliflower and curry are heavenly. Added chicken stock (plus a bit extra by accident) and red quinoa. Verdict? Not bad; I personally think there's room for more spice but that's just my palate! Kiddo liked it though.

Sorry, didn't enjoy this recipe. I cooked it on medium heat and it was still crunchy, so I then added another cup of vegetable broth and lowered the stove even more, still ended a bit crunchy. What I was read elsewhere is that you should let the broth come to a boil first, then add the quinoa. And everywhere I looked had more water or broth ratio to quinoa than this recipe, and I agree, it's not enough broth. I'm willing to try it one more time, with a few tweaks since it has a lot of promise, but was very disappointed.

We really enjoyed this.  Instead of celery and carrots i substituted frozen carrots and peas.  I put them with the onion still frozen.  They thawed nicely while the onion cooked.  I used chicken broth and lemon juice because I didn't have vegetable broth or a lime.  It's hard to get the family to try some of the healthier options like quinoa.  This is a great way to get them started!

I made this according to the recipe and it was far too bland for the adults.  I'd have to double the spices to get any flavor.  It passed muster with the five year olds however.  I struggle to find something to make with quinoa that really tastes good. I'll probably not make it again.

This was very good! I liked the use of turmeric, as you dont see it used often.  I forgot to add the lime so can't comment on the flavor completely.  I used chicken bullion since I also had no veg broth. I added kale for a boost of nutrients which was a nice addition, used fresh basil, and did not add salt.
