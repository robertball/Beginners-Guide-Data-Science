This is so good!   I even did a quick version by just using instant ice tea mix 
and real lemon concentrate with the almond and vanilla but no carbonate drink.  
Taste great either way!!!

Loved this.  Was a big hit at my open house. Take heed to the instructions of adding the soda just before serving...and use only the portions you think you need.  I made the entire batch at once and the leftovers went "flat".  Hated that I did that because I would have LOVED to enjoy it several more days!

This tastes very much like my favorite coctail (ammeretto sour)but without the kick.  My whole family liked it.  By the third day, only 1/4 a pitcher was left, and boy it was sour and gross.  Be sure to drink it all the first day and maybe into the second.  Next time I will only use 1 lemon, and not squeeze it into the pitcher, too lemony.  just let them float around for a nice presentation.

Totally yummy! This is a very fun non-alcoholic drink which I offer to drivers at parties. Easy to drink, and exceptional on a hotday. Make sure you make lots of it, because it disappears quickly. ***It is very, very sweet though...so if you're not used to drinking non-diet pops, you probably will find it a bit overwhelming.

I made this for a baby shower.  It's a really nice alternative to punch.  Looks just like tea, but with a little fizz, and the almond flavoring is awesome!

This is my favorite tea recipe for when company is coming!  I have never put the soda in, which I would think would cut the "shelf-life".

What a waste of a perfectly good batch of iced tea.  The only thing I'm taking away from this recipe is the idea of adding almond extract to a pitcher of tea in the future (might as well since I now have the extract).  The addition of lemon-lime soda ruined it, but for us, the recipe was headed down the wrong path with so much lemon.

This was just not for me. I tried this because another reviewer said this was like an amaretto sour (which I love), but I was VERY dissapointed and highly upset at wasting a pitcher of tea.  I may try this without the soda and less lemon, but will experiment in a smaller glass!

This is a wonderful, refreshing "mocktail," punch, or afternoon pick-me-up. It's light and fruity tasting. I made it waist-line friendly by using Splenda and diet 7-Up.
