A great recipe - I wanted something for the barbeque, so made up the sauce (using the white wine and doubling the fresh dill). I brushed some of the sauce on both sides of 4 salmon steaks and let them sit for 15 minutes. I also used some of the sauce for basting during grilling, saving about 1/2 for serving at the table. The salmon was delicious, and the sauce so tasty. Will make again.

Absolutely delicious. And my first time broiling fish! I will be adding this to my list of weekly recipes. Would have given 5 stars except... the cooking time was way off, I broiled first side for 4 minutes and the second for 2 minutes. The mayo sauce was much too runny to be a dip, however, there was no need for a dip because the fish retained so much flavour.

I am not a mayonnaise fan so I used plain yogurt instead. It was very good. Good quality salmon is key but this sauce made it fantastic. My 10 year old son loved it too.

Excellent, creamy sauce to top your salmon with!  Cooking times are a little off.  9 min under the broiler was fine, but edges started to burn.  Flipping salmon over, the backside started to burn being under for 1 min (we kept the skin on).  Instructions should clarify to do this with skin on or off - this might make a difference.  Alas, our salmon was not cooked all the way through.

Oh, wow. This was delicious, and more would have been eaten if I had any more! I tend to put in less salt than a recipe calls for (unless it is necessary, like for bread baking), but in this case, I think it needed a little salt, which is not included in the recipe.
