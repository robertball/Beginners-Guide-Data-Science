This was really good! I made a 2 layer cake out of it and put the pudding mixture between the layers and the whipped topping mixture on top as icing. I might try putting pineapple in the cake next time too, but overall, delicious!

Instead of the yellow cake, I used an orange cake.  Even more tropical with the flavorings!

This cake is so delicious.  It is light and creamy with the perfect blend of pineapple and coconut.  I thought I lost it though because taste of home has changed the recipe on their site, but this is my favorite version.  I made it just as the recipe stated.

I have made  this several times now.  I had no pineapple so I used canned Mandarin Oranges.  We lied it so much I've made the recipe several times and stuck with the oranges.  Everyone really likes this dessert: not overly sweet, fairly light. One of the earlier reviewers said the cake doesn't come out like the picture...I find it quite the opposite.  The cake maintains its shape really well, even after sitting for over 24 hours.  I used Vanilla Pudding from this site instead of the packaged stuff.  I also used real whipped cream instead of the dry topping mix.
And, lastly, as other reviewers commented: watch the oven closely when toasting the coconut.  I burned two lots before I learned my lesson:-D  300f for about 10 minutes should do it but watch it anyway.  Ovens vary.  The coconut makes it as far as presentation AND taste - so don't omit it.  We're serving it to 50 people at our local Senior Activity Centre for lunch tomorrow.

This cake is sooooooooooooo good!!! I used a tub of Cool Whip instead of the envelope stuff, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Be sure to watch your coconut very carefully! It takes a few minutes to do anything at all (even on high heat), but once it starts browning it is very easily burned!

Fabulous Cake! I used pineapple juice to make the cake with, other than that I followed the directions as posted. My guests all loved it, took the left overs to work and got rave reviews with many requests for the recipie. This is the perfect summer cake...light, not too sweet. Thank you for sharing.

This cake was so good. I wasn't paying attention and added the pineapple without draining it first so the pudding layer came out a little runny. Next time I will pay better attention. This is definitely go into my "all time favorite" list.

I absolutely LOVE this cake!!! I have been on diet so I made this cake using a sugarfree cake mix, sugar free fat free pudding, fat free cream cheese, cool whip free and 2% milk.  It was awesome!!!  Took it to work and no one knew the difference.  One of the Docs I work for is diabetic and he even ate it without any problems with his sugar!!!  For calorie/fat watchers....TRY IT :-)
