OK, so I wasn't really crazy about the broccoli, cauliflower, and carrot idea, so instead I used red, green, and yellow peppers, cucumber, celery, red and green onion, and LOTS of garlic. Turned out great, with these variations. :)

This was really good. I used an organic Italian dressing instead of Caesar, just due to personal preference. Otherwise pretty much followed the recipe to a T. Thanks for sharing!
