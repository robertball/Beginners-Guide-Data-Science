I made this for lunch today.  I don't care for curry powder so I left it and the sugar out of the recipe.  I added a few splashes of seasoned rice wine vinegar instead.  I loved it!  I will make it often with my changes.  PS, try adding some salad shrimp....wow!

This was excellent. Made for 2. I cut everything in half. I didn't have cilantro so I added 2 tbls of Epicure salsa seasoning. I used 3 tablespoons of Real lime and added two chopped up tomatoes. Would have been enough for four.

First, I cut the cucumber into thirds crosswise. Then I took an apple corer/slicer (NOT a peeler/corer/slicer) and pushed in down onto the cucumber to remove the seedy core before dicing the rest. Perfect!

This is a wonderful recipe and should be made just as the recipe states  (I'm not even a curry fan but I love this recipe).... the only recommendation I have is to let it sit for an hour or two in the fridge before serving to let your flavours really mingle.

This was positively the BEST! I love the change from regular vinegar dressings with adding the LIME..the flavor just pops on your mouth. I did forget to p/u cilantro and added a 2tsps of veg oil. I was skeptical about the hot sauce (not much of a spicy gal) but it wasn't spicy at all. My husband even liked it, but did not care for the avacado. I loved the avacado in it, a personal preference I suppose. Thumbs up on this recipe!! I am making again for this weekend. :)

I think this is just personal preference, but we found this a little on the sweet side.  Did enjoy the combination of cucumber and avocado.

DELICIOUS!!  I omitted red bell pepper/hot pepper sauce and substituted in a chopped fresh jalapeno.  This salad is so unique and extremely healthy!! My boyfriend and I were extremely surprised at how satisfying the salad was without any oil.

I also used regular cucumbers from my garden that had lots of seeds, so instead of using hothouse cucumbers and using salt to draw out water, I scooped out regular cucumbers and it worked beautifully.

I also did not put the avocado in because I was making a large portion to store in the fridge for later.

AMAZING! :)

OMG! I could eat this til my belly popped. It is so DELICIOUS, however, I did make one change. I eliminated the sugar and replaced it with balsamic vinegar. GREAT sugar FREE vegetarian and gluten free dish.

Easy, healthy and delicious! This was a great recipe and forced me to learn how to zest. It's not hard at all! I followed the recipe except held the red onions. It turned out fabulous!

I made with six cucumbers. The differences I changed 1/2 c red onions,1 1/2 red pepper,1/2 teas curry powder, 1/2 teas salt. I loved this recipe. My five and eight year loved it. So for that reason also, it is a keeper. Great summer salad.

Hubby and I don't like bell peppers so I subbed jalapenos and it turned out great (quite spicy though!).. great recipe.. the curry adds a nice change of flavor and the heat from the cilantro and hot sauce contrasts nicely with the cool cucumber and avocados! A summer salad favorite for sure!

Even though my outdoor temp gauge now reads 9 deg F and there's 5 ft of snow outside, I still enjoyed this cool and refreshing salad! I halved the recipe and enjoyed it as a dinner salad. I worked with what I had on hand so I had to use bottled lime juice (so no zest). I also topped it with a very light sprinkle of sea salt and cracked black pepper. Great flavors and textures. Will have to keep this in mind for the warmer weather, when it gets here! Thanks javaqueen!

Unique way to dress up summer's garden veggies, and the recipe lends itself well to add-ins or subs.  In my version I used a regular cuke and added chopped tomatoes (both seeded); a drizzle of avocado oil for extra pizazz and flavor. Delicious to drain and spoon into pita bread that is spread with hummus.

We all liked this a lot! Used 3 T lime juice, so maybe 1.5 limes worth? didn't want it so tart. Rogan josh curry powder was awesome. I only had one avocado and think it was delicious!

Wonderful, easy salad! I left out the curry intentionally (not a fan), so adjusting to personal preference is simple. I might add tomatoes or feta next time as they seem like they would complement the overall flavor.

The one draw back to this recipe is that it is fairly labor intensive. On the other hand, the results are terrific. Even a guest, who does not like avocado, found this to be very flavorful. I followed the recipe as written.

First time, I didn't use the red pepper or the red onion as I didn't have.  I also used the small Persian cucumbers (peeled).  It was so good, I made it the 2nd time, including all ingredients, same cucumbers, this time we put on top of grilled swordfish, which was an excellent addition to the fish.  All the lime juice also kept the avocado from turning brown.  This recipe will be made many more times this summer.

Loved the flavors. The only thing I will do differently next time is adding more avocados and cutting the cucumbers smaller. They overpowered the dish a bit.

Very yummy salad! I cut this recipe in half, and my husband and I shared it for lunch. I added double the amount of curry and put in a nice big squirt of Sriracha for the hot sauce. I had to use lemon juice as I didn't have any lime. I will definitely make this salad again! Thanks!

Surprisingly, this didn't have much flavor.   Maybe it just has to sit longer.

Very nice in a hot summer day. The curry is an unexpected surprise.  I will probably salt the cucumbers with more salt and let them sit longer before rinsing.  The dish was a bit soupy by next day.  I’ll be making this again.

Good recipe. I added a jalapeno pepper and some diced tomato. It had a little bite that I like in salsa.

This was perfect in every way.  The small amount of curry powder is the key.

Delicious! I wasn't sure how it would taste with so much lime but the dressing is amazing. I will be making this again for sure.

I made this for dinner tonight.  I didn't have any red onion so I used a mild yellow.  It was great.  My husband could not get enough!  this is definitely a keeper.

Very good. I didn't follow the recipe to a 't', as most users seem to have done. Even without the tomatoes, sugar and curry powder this recipe was a success.

Excellent. I wasn't sure what to think, but my husband and (unexpected) guests loved it.  I made it as written.  Thank you for sharing it with us!  I paired it with Grilled Fish Tacos with Chipotle-Lime Dressing = complemented each other wonderfully.

Delicious and healthy. Love the intense lime flavor. I also left out the curry and sugar - just sounded a little strange to me for some reason!

Loved this recipe. I originally was going to pair this with chicken tacos but I ended up rolling it in a wheat wrap and eating it without the chicken it was so good. Very flavorful, you can't go wrong with fresh lime and cilantro. I think next time I might add a can of corn too.

One of the best refreshing salads I've had in a long time.  This is definitely a keeper and one I'll serve to company.  Didn't change a thing. AWESOME!
