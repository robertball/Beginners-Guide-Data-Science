As this was cooking I thought it may end up a little bland, but it didn't. I added a few spices that were mentioned in other reviews, but other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out great.

OMG is this good..I did make another recipe out of this cause it is easy to and I just made it now...here are some changes though..yeah yeah...browned up (5 thick boneless)chops..set aside..to same fry pan added 1 diced pepper, muchroons, a bit of onion (1/4ish cup)plus, 1 and a half cup FRESH green beans halved, pinch of basil and oregano and a dash of cayanne pepper, saute until it start to smell nice, add 1 cup long grain rice, stir until rice is opaque, add 1 cup fresh skinless diced tomatoes, 1/2 cup tomato juice ( I used V8) and 3/4 cup water...simmer 5 minutes. Add a bit of basil/oregano/ chili pepper to outside of Pork chops. Transfer rice mixture to casserole place chops on top, cover and place in preheated oven to 350 degrees. Cool 1 hour and 15 minutes. I am doing this here because to get a new recipe publish here is  insane and I did use the basic recipe with mods...sorry

Great Recipe, just lacked abit of zest for my taste.

I used the 6 portion (for extra rice) with 3 pork chops.

First, I covered the chops with chopped garlic, onion, all purpose seasoning (on hand), and sprinkled 1/2 packet of Zazon (in the Spanish isle-not hot, just tasty)on both sides, poked it a little, covered and put into fridge for a couple of hours (I had the time).
I browned the chops with the garlic etc.  I set it aside.

For the rice mixture I used 1 can of green beans drained (also on hand). Added some more garlick, onion, seasoning, and the other half of the Zazon packet.

WOW - even my finicky father loved it, whose afraid of many seasonings.

It was completely gone.  Good thing I used the 6 portion!

The recipe is great, I just needed a bit more seasoning.

With a family of 8 everyone liked this recipe thus the five stars. However I did season my pork chops with our "house seasoning" (salt, pepper, garlic, and onion powder) other than that I made the recipe as is and the whole family raved!

This was a great family meal for us. I used a frozen package of broccoli instead of the peas, and mixed in a half can of cream of broccoli soup.  I also seasoned the pork chops with Greek seasoning (our favorite seasoning). Next time, I will try it with chicken, as we thought this was a great recipe on days that you do not want to heat up your house with the oven.  Thanks for the post, this will be cooked often in our house!

this is very good, but very bland. An excellent recipe to build upon. Add your own spices or some pepper.

This recipe is super easy and very good.  DH loved it.  I thought it could use a just little more spice.  However, I really liked the flavor of the thyme and onion with the peas, and I'm not usually a huge fans of peas. So I wouldn't go overboard with additional spices because I think they would overwhelm the thyme. Next time, I'll try adding just some black pepper and use garlic salt instead of regular.

Delicious!  We like our chops seasoned heavily and I added a bag of mixed frozen veges rather than just peas.  It was great!

This was quite good.  I had no thyme so I substituted marjoram and basil, and for a flavor twist I cut the salt content in half and added some soy sauce to taste as it cooked in the rice.

This was ok.Easy and simple just what i was looking for.With that being said...The flavor of the rice was good but needed a bit more,the pork chops were moist....again needed more flavor.I like that this was quick and easy.So, i would make it again.But, i would also make changes so  i would get better flavor in the end.

Very quick and delicious weeknight dinner.  I made the recipe as described expect for browning the pork chops in butter versus oil and adding some additional seasoning (lots of course ground black pepper, garlic powder, and some ground sage).  I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty this recipe was!

This was really good. I messed it up by using basmati rice. Next time I'll use regular white rice or the long grain as suggested but basmati was all I had at home. It was still delicious and hubby and I ate all of it so can't wait until I use a better type of rice for this recipe.

Was pretty good but nothing spectacular.  Added some instant onion soup mix to give it some more flavor.  A good way to provide a large dinner for a family and use up that family sized package of pork chops you got on sale.

Didn't really care for this one. It wasn't bad but it was pretty bland.  I like a bit more kick to my dinners. A bit more spices might live it up a little but Iwouldn't be sure which ones to try.

A good base recipe.. was very bland for my taste. Although, I do have to say that it was better the next day reheated. Also, the rice takes longer to cook than stated.

This was one of the worst meals I've ever made.  The flavor... well, what flavor? It was incredibly bland and the meat was bone dry.  Perhaps a can of cream of chicken plus lots of seasoning may perk this one up...  My two year old who loves peas more than anything took one bite and said "this is yucky mommy"...

We really liked this, especially the rice.  I added coriander and miso paste to the rice which made it almost like a fried rice.  The pork chops were okay, just not a lot of flavor.  I'd definitely fix this again, but I'd probably do something different with the pork chops.

I made a couple of changes due to on hand ingredients. I used chicken & rice soup and chicken broth. I seasoned the chops with cajun seasoning. I also left out the peas because one guest doesn't eat veggies very well. Great taste! reminds me of a dish my mom made but much easier!

These chops didn't turn out as tender as I like, but for how quick and easy this recipe is, I'm pleased! I followed the recipe, but seasoned my pork chops first. The rice turned out nicely flavored and just perfect.

Although this recipe wasn't as flavorful as I would have personally liked, I am totally sold on it because my two picky kids both loved it! I have a five year old and a seven year old. They both like peas, but I've never had success getting them to eat peas mixed with anything else. This was such a big hit with my family that for the first time in a long time, the entire skillet was eaten! Thank you!

I love this recipe for a base. I made instant rice, cooked the peas, added chopped onion to the pork chops and the added it all to the skillet with 1/2 can of chicken broth, Tbspn of soy sauce, and the spices. Easy, quick and really yummy!

The pork chops were really dry, but my family LOVED the flavor of the rice.

Hubby LOVED this, I added a small can of pineapple chunks, substituted the liquid for the 1/2 cup of water and used some onion and garlic powder as well.

This was a great find. My husband loved it and my kids were willing to eat some of it. I thought it could use a bit more flavor but I will make it again.

I asked for pork chop recommendations on recipe exchange and this is the recipe I got.  I thought the pork chops were a very bland, even after sprinkling them with seasoning salt.  I would spice them more next time - if there is a next time.  I left out the peas since I can't stand them and served a zucchini side dish, so it looked a little boring.    We only eat brown rice, so I had to double the broth and simmer until it was soft.  The rice was tasty.

This is a good method for pork chops to keep them moist and juicy. I did mine on the grill rather than fry in the skillet for a better flavor, and seasoned the chops with lawry's. Also did not add peas to the rice, had them on the side.

Okay so I made this recipe, and it came out bad. I don't know why, but I did it exactly like the recipe called for and it was not right. The rice took over an hour to cook, and i've cooked rice before and it still didn't work out right. On the plus side we added cheese to make it taste better.

Great quick meal to make on nights when you are busy. I had everything in the pantry and I was able to whip this up without making a trip to the grocery store. Next time I may season the chops just a bit more than called for, they were not as seasoned as I like them. Other than that, they were great!

This is a good skillet meal.  I browned the rice with the onions as suggested, then deglaced the pan with some sherry and added some paprika, onion powder and italian seasoning before adding the broth (I used boullion and skipped the salt).  I also left out the peas and served it with honeyed carrots.

Made this dish last night with a couple minor changes (used chicken broth made from oxo and didn't measure anything exactly) and it was great. Will definitely do this recipe again.

First time reviewer!  This was a great outcome. Had leftover port chops and nuked them instead of cooking.  
Thanks.
