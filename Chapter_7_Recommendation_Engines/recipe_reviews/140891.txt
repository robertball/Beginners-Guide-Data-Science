This is very similar to a recipe I use - only additions are I add a small mashed clove of garlic, a cup of chicken stock and finely sliced onions and peppers to sauce before adding roux. It is amazing - my husband is the pickiest eater ever and not only does he not suspect anchovies - he loves this recipe!

Outstanding. I love vinegar, but even my husband (who does not like it as much as me because he had to clean with it as a child!) loved this dish. The vinegar is not too overpowering - just very mellow. The anchovy roux is delicious - and I've never considered myself a fan of them. I was really surprised by how much we liked this dish. Can't say enough about it. A must try for everyone who comes across it!

Loved this dish!  I'm  a huge vinegar fan, so i tried this receipe as soon as  i found it.  So glad I did!  Simple to prepare & delicious.  The pork was tender & so flavorful.  Loved the vinegar/anchovy combination.  Doubled the sauce and sprinkled the tiniest bit of sugar in it at the end.  Other than that, wouldn't change a thing.  Reminder - this is a white wine vinegar sauce (not sweet like a balsamic sauce), so a little goes a long way.  You might want to serve it on the side.  Thanks so much for posting :)!

The flavor was not that good and my chops came out dry; I'm wondering if it could have been because my chops were thicker than 1/4".   I also used anchovy paste but I couldn't really taste it;  the vinegar overpowered it.   I will keep attempting to get nice succulent pork chop but I don't plan to make this recipe again!  :)

Amazing flavor for such a simple recipe. I used anchovy paste instead of the filets and butter and still got amazing results. This one will become a regular!

Love this dish!  It has the 'tang' of pork chops and sauerkraut (which I LOVE) but gives me something different to make with the same basic flavor.  I made one change...I used capers instead of anchovies...YUM

I guess I don't care for tangy gravy-sauces. I like vinegar, but not like this.

The flavor seemed a little bland to me. Next time I think I will try adding a few spices to it to suit my taste better.
