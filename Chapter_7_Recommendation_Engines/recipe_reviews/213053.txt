I opted for diced carrots instead of peppers and tomatoes (my family wont eat those!) and to make it a little simpler, I used some Italian dressing I already had in my fridge! Delicious!

This is a really good poor man's italian sausage pasta salad. This isn't a gourmet  meal but a good everyday meal. The only thing I did different is I did not add vinegar because my husband doesn't like it.

This was okay.  My nine year old loved it.  My two year old liked it.  I substituted spaghetti noddles for rotini and carrots for the pepper, based on what we had in the house.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exact.
