The use of the pie filling is a good idea and makes for quick preparation.  I modified the topping a little by using 3/4 cup flour and 1 1/4 cup oats.  I also used 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup walnuts.  Serve warm with ice cream, yum!

Still a great recipe, although I used less flour and I always add more spice. I NEVER use margarine, but I used fresh butter instead. I have been meaning to pick up fresh apples for days and I never did and I really wanted to bake apple crisp, so I used a can of sliced apples I already had. Tastes fantastic topped with cinnamon, whipping cream and caramel.

I used Jen Marshals suggestions made in Sept. 05.  It was the best apple crisp I have had.  I used the apple pie filling, the spices and procedure that this recipe had and the rest I used her directions.  If you want a good easy dessert this is wonderful.

The crumble topping for this is excellent. I decided not to cheat with the filling. I used 4 fresh sliced Granny Smith apples, teaspoon of cinnamon & all spice, teaspoon brown sugar and a couple of cap fulls of dark rum. 
Was perfectly cooked after 45mins. Very yummy served with vanilla ice-cream.

I'm not an experienced baker, and I didn't know butter should be cold and firm.  I let it soften and batter came out creamy and doughy instead of crumbly.  Next time should be much better.  The flavor was good.

The topping for this was disgusting. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out all gummy and tasteless.  I even cooked it for about 20 extra minutes for a total of 40, and the top still didn't really brown right.  To much flour, not enough butter and sugar?  I'll go back to my oatmeal topping thanks.  I gave it two stars only because I hadn't thought of using pie filling for apple crisp before.

Don't waste your pie filling.  The 2 cups of flour made a gummy topping with no absolutely no flavor.  There was nothing "crisp" about this recipe.  Stick with a good oatmeal/brown sugar topping.

very easy to make, although the topping was a bit heavy, next time I will use less margarine, I also added chopped nuts to the topping which was very yummy!

This recipe gets 5 stars for easy and another 5 for ingredients on hand!  3 or 4 stars though for the flavor...  The ideal topping is: 1/2 c. flour, 3/4 c. oats, 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/3 c. chopped walnuts.  We'd prepared it according to Jen Marshall's review and it was far too much topping for our liking.  Lesson learned: If it looks like too much topping, don't add it!  :)  I used her ratios for these suggestions, but she was certainly right in adding the oats, it would just have a strange cakey topping.  We made it with peach pie filling and it turned out wonderfully.  I'm sure you could use any pie filling available.  Thanks Sarena!

Was good, but make sure the butter isn't soft. I also mixed 1/2 with oats instead of flower and added extra brown sugar on top. The guys ate it up super fast.

I prepared this dish like the first person (Jen Marshall) rated it and it was delicious!!  I doubled the recipe, did not add nutmeg (I just don't like nutmeg) and I used 1 1/2 cups of butter instead of 2 cups.  It was so easy to make and it tasted so good.  I will make it again because it was so easy.  We ate it hot with some whipped topping and yum yum!!!

I liked the idea of using pie filling but I changed the recipe.I used a 1/2 cup of quick oats,1/4 cup of butter(chilled)1/2 cup of brown sugar and a 1/4 cup of flour.Did use a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg.Put in 9 inch glass pie pan and did the 350 degrees for 20 minutes.The original recipe had too much flour and margarine and not enough brown sugar.Most fruit crisps also have oats.

I've had some cans of apple filling for a while and was craving apple crisp. I didn't have any oatmeal so I tried this recipe and made it *exactly* as written. I'm extremely disappointed and the only way I think it could be made better is to not bother wasting perfectly good apple filling on it at all.

This was really good!  I followed Jen Marshall's amounts of the topping, and it turned out good.  The only problem was, that I felt it made a TON of topping!  Also I found the nutmeg too strong for my taste.  So next time I will use only a pinch of nutmeg and half the crisp topping.

I will definitely make this again but as one reviewer said with rolled oats.  If you make the recipe as is, it's too "floury."  It needs at least half as much flour and more sugar in the topping.  With that, I think it would make 5 stars.

Taking in time as a consideration, this recipe had promise, however, I think I'll stick to a more timely recipe to achieve the results I require...a good taste.  This recipe had absolutely no flavor, and the butter was way to much. Maybe if the butter was cut in half it would be ok.

Excellent and super easy!  I followed the suggestion of adding walnuts to the mix for some extra crunch.  Browned and crisped up nicely after about 30 minutes in the oven.

This recipe turned out AMAZING!! I ended up putting two cans of the apple pie filling in and adding just a little more brown sugar than the recipe called for.  For those of you getting gooey toppings, try using chilled margarine instead of letting it soften. Hubby let it soften the first time and it came out a gooey and runny.

This recipe calls for waaaay too much flour.  It needs to be cut in half at least.  It turned out all doughy and I had to scrape it off and run with the topping listed in my Betty Crocker to recover this dish

This recipe is mushy and tasteless.  There is wayyyyyy too much flour in the topping and it does not "crisp" like you expect that an apple crisp recipe should.  I'm not sure if the topping should just have less flour and more sugar or if a different topping would work with the canned pie filling, but I'm guessing your best bet is to go the old fashioned way and use fresh apples.

Well been staring at this can apple's from holidays. Its Monday no school so I decided to see if I can do crumble with canned apple pie filling. Honestly I'm a homemade kinda girl. My son had won a raffle came home bag of goodies and this was in it. So, long story short looked it up ended up on my Allrecipe site so decided give it a whirl an all. All I can say is I love from scratch but for quick pain free easy clean up and quick Nummy it was worth the easy way out. Having with vanilla ice cream just made it even better. Not sure be any left for Daddy when he comes home from work. All I can say Round 2 30 minutes out of my day big smiles from my son made it taste even better. Great after lunch treat.
THANKS Allrecipes for another great easy make yummy!!

It was so good I made it twice.  Excellent recipe if you are looking for an oatmeal-free apple  crisp.
 I used butter. And added more cinnamon and nutmeg than the recipe calls for, plus added a little  to the dough. It made enough dough for 2 crisps (my dish is a 7 or 8 inch oval and is smaller than the recipe calls for). I used the whole can of apple pie filling, but wrapped and froze half of the dough. Then with another can of pie filling made the 2nd one the next week. Excellent with vanilla ice cream. Great recipe! Thanks!  Note: consider removing the photos that show oatmeal covered crisps.

I found the crumb mixture was more  like a crust. It was definitely not crumbly. The only change I made was adding a little more sugar on crust

The flour alone would  make a gummy crisp! I made it half flour/oatmeal. Should have omitted the flour completely. Will not make again.

I received a bunch of homemade apple pie filling as a gift and had to use it up. I made this recipe only I incorporated Jen Marshall's alterations and had to bake it nearly double the length of time in order for it to get bubbly and the topping to saturate. But then it turned out pretty good. I will make it again like this.

This is good.  Reduce the flour by half added an extra can of apples and cooked a bit longer. The topping is more like a pie crust.  I actually renamed to fit its look and taste when I introduced it to my family for the first time, "Apple Pie Bake"  After all its more like an apple pie with out the round dish and the bottom pie crust.

This was ok, I had to cook it longer as the top didn't seem to brown.
