These were delicious minus the "fake" cheese. I used shredded cheddar and baked this in the oven to ensure the crispiness of the chips. Great appetizer for a large group too. Thanks!

Velveeta just didn't taste right or have the texture I expect in nachos. Definitely needs "real" grated cheese to be 5 stars.

This is just not my favorite way to have nachos.  I made this recipe because of the other ingredients, but processed cheese is not the way to go if you want real nachos.  I came from California and out there cheese is grated not squeezed from a package.  I wanted to try this combo because I like the ingredients, but should have known the processed cheese wouldnâ€™t make this all that good.

We love this meal!  It's kid friendly and it's easy to divide into sections.  Some of us like beans, some like tomatoes, etc.  Everyone gets what they like.  I have three kids under 5,  it's nice to have at least one meal or snack that pleases them all.  For me, I toss my nachos into a salad and make a taco salad.  It's also a great movie dinner for our family dinner and a movie night.

These were very yummy!! one thing I would say is that the re-freid beans made them a little mushy, even though I put them in the oven instead of the microwave. Also instead of processed cheese (ick) I used shreeded monterey Jack and chedder cheese mix, and then melted it in the broiler. Next time I make these I will add lettuce and some sour cream :)

What a fun and messy meal. We all loved it! I did not use the processed cheese and milk, but instead shredded some chedder. We also omitted the refried beans but added black beans, sliced black olives, lettuce, green onions, diced avocado, sour cream and salsa. Yes, I added a lot but man, was it delicious. This will be our meal for Cinco de Mayo

I use fresh shredded cheese (cheddar and Jack)and add pickled jalapenos to this base. Drizzle a little smooth taco sauce and some dollops of sour cream on after you pull them out of the oven and grab the cold beer and napkins.

Born and raised in SoCAL and you will find this standard recipe for nachos is really good, especially for kids.  Not too spicy.  If you like it spicy and are looking for a bit more complex flavor - this might not be the recipe for you.  My kids love it however.  I usually put a bit of salsa in with my Velveeta and omit the chopped tomatoes for the kids.  Fast & easy - also very tasty.  Thanks!

This is GREAT! I've made it several times. It taste great exactly as it is, but I always make the following modifications to add an extra zest: add salsa, jalapenos, and diced tomatos w/ green chilis to the milk/processed cheese mixture. I also top it off with green onions and sour cream. I make this for my daughter and her friends all the time and if they had their way we would eat it everyday. This is so good and easy to prepare.

Took the basic idea of the recipe, and changed it a little to suite our likes. First, I didn't use the Taco seasoning (I don't like that stuff!) Instead I sauted my beefe with a little Franks red hot sauce, garlic powder, and a little black bean sauce. Also, I didn't use the processed cheese (icky!) I used some nice aged cheddar instead. Baked mine in the oven instead of the microwave. Yum! :)

These are pretty good except next time, I will definitely use a different cheese.  The processed cheese is too overpowering for our tastes.  Other than that, great quick snack.

These were pretty tasty.  I'm normally a huge fan of processed cheese, but it just wasn't working for me on this one (it could be because i used the entire pound of cheese so it was a bit overwhelming).  Next time I will either try adding salsa to the velveeta, or just scrapping it altogether and using grated cheese.  I added sliced black olive and jalapenos.  These make a ton, so make sure you're hungry!!
