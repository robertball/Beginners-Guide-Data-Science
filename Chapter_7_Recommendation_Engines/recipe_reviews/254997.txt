I only had organic chix broth (instead of veggie broth)and I used 32 ounces.  I did not have fontina cheese so I used a 1/3 cup of grated organic parm cheese.  Instead of nuking the acorn squash I baked it (cut in half, seeds out, face down in a little water for 40 mins on 400).  Turned out great!

I used chicken broth constituted from Better Than Boulion, because I reserve veg broth for vegan recipes, and I've made risotto with chicken broth before.
I used brown rice and had to stir in broth for about 10-15 minutes more than max. I used extra broth though as well, (40 oz). The squash took 10 min to cool, probably could have microwaved it for less time and nexttime I'll prick squash to make some vents. Overall this tasted really good, even though I didn't have fontina cheese and used Marsala wine.

I was pleasantly surprised with this recipe.  I made it as written except I needed another half cup of broth to get my rice cooked.  Also, it's good the next day, not as sweet, but still so good!

I have made this twice, but substituted chunked cook butternut squash and cooked pumpkin chunks. It was absolutely delicious!
