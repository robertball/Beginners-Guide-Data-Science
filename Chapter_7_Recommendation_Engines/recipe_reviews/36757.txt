I just made the hummus, didn't bother to make into sandwiches.  Recipe was very good and very easy.

I loved this but found it a little heavy on the garlic.  I'll probably reduce the amount used next time I make it.  Very good sandwich though.

WOW! this was great! my entire family LOVED it and wants me to make it again. Not only that, but it was EASY and healthy. The hummus was the best I've ever tasted - I made extra to use as dip with pita crackers. Please try this! Its a keeper! (only alteration - a thin slice of mozzarella cheese tastes great in this sandwich)

The recipe was great, although it was a little too garlic-y for most of my party guests. I ended up adding 6 T. of Yogurt to try to "tame" it when I checked the taste, and although it didn't make it any less garlic-y, it did enhance the flavor and texture. I'll just use less garlic next time (you can always add more, but you can't take it out...)

I made the hummus without the yogurt, cumin and garlic.  Great sandwiches - only next time I will try using untoasted bread, as I found the toasted slices a bit hard, which made the whole thing rather difficult to eat.  Still, very satisfying!

Very tasty and rich.  The hummous alone could go with anything. My boyfriend who dislikes hummous wanted me to make it again. A definte keeper.

Very good, but it still doesn't beat the hummus sandwich I had in Berkeley.

I just made the hummus, not the rest of the club sandwich - but it's a quick and delicious hummus which is very smooth and satisfying.

Great twist with the yogurt.  Will definitely make again for a quick, healthy lunch.

This is my favorite recipe for hummus. I typically double the ingredients for the hummus spread, process the mixture in a food processor, refrigerate, and eat the spread throughout the week over toasted bread. It is absolutely delicious.

These were so good!  I used wheat dinner rolls from the bakery since these were for a Father's Day picnic.  They made the perfect mini sandwich!  I also used Athenos roasted red pepper hummus instead of making it from scratch, just b/c I had never made hummus before and I was a little nervous about it.  I'm giving 4 stars only b/c I didn't make the hummus part, so I don't know if it was good or not.  This is a healthy and easy summer lunch and I'll definitely make it again.

Who would have imagined that vegitarian could be this satisfying?  Even my three year old liked it.
