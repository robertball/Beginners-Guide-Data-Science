Very tasty!  I didn't chill the dough and the cookies turned out just fine.  Also I only cooked them 15 minutes.

Delicious! A big hit at my cookie exchange. Pretty, with a chocolate shortbread flavor--rich but not too sweet. I just dusted them with powdered sugar instead of rolling them--it was easier and just as attractive, I think. Don't know why dough has to be refrigerated first--I skipped this step with one batch and the turned out just fine. Highly recommended!

Kids and I made these, delicious! we omited the nuts because they don't like nuts and we substititued some oatmeal to keep the dough stiff, they didn't stay round like a snowball but they got eaten SO fast. Fun and tastey recipe we will make again!

I love these cookies! I know them as an old family tradition. I was given the exact recipe by my mother-in-law, who received it from her grandmother. I was pleasantly surprised to see it on All Recipes. These are a Christmas tradition for us, and I look forward to them every year.

These cookies were dry and bitter. I think there wasnt enough sugar to sweeten all of the cocoa it calls for. 20 minutes is too long to cook them too.

Very good - like someone else mentioned, kind of like chocolate shortbread. I didn't have any nuts so I just left them out. They were a hit at work!

My nieces loved these, however, I have to say I do not care for them at all. THe chocolate somehow removes the original yummness of the cookies original taste. Muddies it sort of. I'll go with the original. But thats just me.

I was not too fond of this recipe.  It was not as sweet as I thought it should be.  I was not alone either, my entire family thought they were a little too bitter.  Needles to say I had about 5 dozen leftover cookies that ended up in the trash.  Very disappointing.

I made these for a cookie exchange and people seemed to like them.  We don't like nuts so I substituted mint chips instead and thought they tasted great!

I can sum these up in one word- YUM-O!  Will definitely make these again.  I didn't chill them before rolling the first batch, but I did pop it in the fridge in between batches.

These did come out more like a shortbread but that's why I liked them. They weren't too sweet and held together well. I recommend this one if you like chocolate cookies that aren't overwhelmingly sweet.

This was an OK cookie.  Not really very chocolatey and a bit dry.  The powdered sugar was a nice touch - added a bit of sweetness - but I found it to be dry and not too impressive.  My family didn't really like them either.  They gobbled up the other cookies first and these were left in the dish for quite a while.

A tasty little cookie.  It is more like a shortbread..not too sweet and on the dryer side.Wonderful with a glass of milk or some hot cocoa. I followed the directions to a tee, and I had good results. We enjoyed them and I will make them again.

I love these!  I used dark cocoa powder, and I left out the salt because I cook low sodium.  I ground the nuts in my food processor to get them really fine.  I don't know why the cookies did not retain their round shape very well, but they were really cute anyway.  They also didn't hold the confectioner's sugar very well, but I didn't mind.  These were just what I wanted, cocoa-y and not too sweet.  I only got about 56 little cookies out of a batch, rather than 72.

I didn't like these cookies at all. The dough was very crumby, did not come together well, even with refrigeration. They didn't come out very sweet and fell apart really quickly. I thought about taking them to a Christmas party the next day but they were already stale, even though I kept them in an airtight container. I ended up throwing all the cookies out. Overall, a total disaster.

The two hours of cooling is a bit of a delay for a kid project.

The good news is that the dough looks like dirt, and is fun to pack into balls for baking.

Made these with my Mom and daugther. Very bitter and flattened completely when put into the oven. Definitely way too much butter. Would not use this recipe again..

These are good I froze my dough it helped with keeping them shaped. However, I have just chilled them and they are good that way as well.

Tender is an understatement. They are fragile and melt in my mouth. They turned out really yummy.  I only chilled them for 15 minutes.  the dough isn't gooey  or sticky ... more... oily paste.. it was easy to roll them. The full 20 minutes cook time was the perfect. Yum

These are one of my favorites and have been our family Christmas tradition for many years. I also put 1 1/2 teaspoons of instant coffee in mine. The trick with the powdered sugar is to wait 15 minutes after you take them out before rolling them in it because if you try to do it right from the oven the sugar does not stick. This is probably why a lot of people throught they were too bitter. Also, the refrigeration before baking is so that the chocolate balls will hold together and not fall apart before they are done. This is a great cookie with  the combination of bitter chocolate with the sweet powdered sugar!

Don't let the photo fool you since it looks disgusting but these are the best cookies.  Easy to make and absolutely delicious.

loved it!  Everyone said good with a cup of coffee.  I drizzled chocolate over the top of the cookie instead of powder sugar.

I've used this recipe for years and love it every time. Since becoming vegan I wanted to see if it was possible to make it vegan friendly...but it already is! SO GREAT
