This is an excellent recipe!  I was a bit afraid of ruining an expensive cut of meat.  Not a chance--everyone loved it.  It was still rare at 2 hours, so gave it another 1/2 hour--tender, juicy and still some rare for those that like rare and medium to medium well for others.  We will be having this one again!  Thanks so much.

This recipe would be better on a pork tenderloin.  If you are looking for a traditional prime recipe, than this is not the one for you.  It did make the best sandwiches the next day.

This was delicious!  We made it for Thanksgiving and it was so tender.  My husband thought there was too much garlic, but I couldn't disagree more!  We used this recipe for a little over 3 lb piece of prime rib and I have one word for it.....YUM!

This turned out very good.  Couldn't taste the marinade alot, and definetly coat your pan with tin foil because it made a mess in the pan.  Had to cook about 30 minutes longer till it was 145 degrees.  That made it a nice medium after letting it sit 30 minutes

This is now my Christmas staple!  People remember the wonderful tenderness and aroma of this meal, and it's so easy.  (I highly recommend choosing Guinness.)

The only changes I make to this recipe is using a nice sweet hot mustard instead of the mustard powdr and hot pepper sauce.  The taste is a bit smoother.

I've had a lot of prime rib, but this is the best! And he's right, the sandwiches are out of this world! My husband has requested this several times since last Christmas.

My Mom said this rib roast turned out better than hers ever has- and that's saying something!  The marinade is excellent, and my roast was juicy and tender.  I marinated mine overnight.  Awesome!!

I just made this and it was delicious, even though I forgot the garlic so it can get better. 
I had my family over tonight and served it with roasted read potatoes and asparagus.  Very very good.  Not bad for the first time.

A good prime rib dinner is my all time favorite and this recipe was really good but not the best that I've made.  For some reason the orange marmalade left an after taste.  I've never had a bad prime rib but some recipes are better than others so I'll stick to my regular way to prepare.

This recipie was a huge success for us at Christmas. It was simple to make, and very flavorful. The mairnade did make the meat tender and added a succulent flavor. I even made a rue with the left over juice by adding a little flour that topped off the whipped potatoes perfectly! Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!!

I'm don't seem to be a good run lately in terms of not liking recipes that others have rated highly. I had high hopes for this based on all the positive reviews. I made this tonight but my family and I thought that this marinade just didn't at all compliment the flavour of the beef. It was Ok but not great. I doubt we'll be having this again.

Although, due to allergies, we had to replace the soy sauce with worcestershire - this was wonderful.  We had a boneless roast and, at a guests' request, we overcooked it but it was still tender, juicy and very tasty.

This was the best prime recipe I have ever come across. It was definately a hit on Christmas Eve! The fresh ginger root/beer marinade made all the difference!

I also thought this recipe was wonderful.  I used a Penzy's Cajun Rub on the pork first, then the BBQ sauce.  I didn't use 'baby' back ribs, I used a much larger cut of meat & they still turned out wonderful.  Thanks great recipe!!

Phenomenal! Everyone not only ranted and raved, they devoured the entire prime rib roast.   I will make this a yearly tradition.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I don't use the Ginger, but that is just our preference.

Very good, used a boneless roast. I added some boiler onions to the carrots and celery. Easy to make.
