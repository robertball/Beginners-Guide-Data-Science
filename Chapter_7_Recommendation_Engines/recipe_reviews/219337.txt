Amazing tilapia recipe.  All three of my kids loved this.  I didn't have Sazon seasoning on hand so I used a mix of onion, garlic, paprika and parsley.  Love the fact it is low carb!!!

So good that my husband wants to serve to company three days from now!!!!

This dish was really good!  I would recommend doubling the parmesan mixture so that you can use it also as a dipping sauce

SOOO good, probably one of the best fish recipes I've tried. For those people who don't like fish this recipe doesn't have much of a "fishy" taste so you should try it. This is better than the "Broiled Tilapia Parmesan" Recipe that is also on allrecipes, I think because of the added seasoning step. I searched for a recipe for Sazon seasoning on google and though it's a little extra work to mix up yourself you can definitely taste the difference (I've tried both with and without the seasoning and it's huge!). I too had difficulty finding Sazon in my grocery stores - so I made my own after searching on google, 1 tsp each of: salt, garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, cumin, corriander.

Like many cooks I substitute for what I have on hand. Having no idea what miami style seasoning is I used a sweet-hot seasoning and italian herbs instead of basil. The result was wonderful and complemented by the brown rice that accompanied it. The next day I saut√©ed the leftovers of both with onions and carrots in olive oil which was equally delicious. I will use this two-day formula again. Thanks for sharing.

I don't think I've ever eaten tilapia so quickly! This recipe is divine. I even licked the plate when I was done. Thanks for the fantastic recipe!

This was a fantastic recipe. My wife is extremely critical of fish recipes and she just gobbled this up. I didn't have any sazon seasoning, but I had something called 'Spike' seasoning which is a similar all-purpose seasoning that we used instead. Other than that, we followed the recipe exactly. We might use less butter (used actual butter not margarine) next time as I felt it was richer than it needed to be to impart all the flavor. I also used low-fat mayonnaise instead of fat free. The extra calories from the low-fat instead of fat-free mayo & full fat butter probably also contributed to rich taste. Either way, super yummy and will definitely make again!

I'm a person who never really liked fish, but I wanted to start eating it since it is so healthy for you. I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try. It was very easy and quick to prepare and cook. Online recipes that I've tried before lie about the prep time and take much longer. This one was true to it's word. The tilapia came out great. As I said before, I don't really like fish, but I like this. It is very flavorful, and following the instructions allowed me to prepare it without a fishy taste.

My husband almost licked MY pate. LOL! Next time I might put a little less parm to bring out the lemon, but over all it was awesome.

I made this the other night using catfish because that's the only fish my husband will eat.  He told me,"you can make that for me anytime.  It was fantastic!"  That is a great compliment to this recipe.  The only thing I added was 1/8 tsp of garlic powder.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

I made this last night, following the recipe as best I could because I used fresh catfish, as my husband does not like tilapia, and I could not find miami sazon, so I used Tony Chachere's instead.  This was great, I doubled the recipe using 10 pieces of fish for three of us and there was not a piece left.  I had one piece, and my son and husband devoured the rest.  I made salad, a side and a vegetable, and the fish still dissapeared.  Will definitely make the a lot.

This is by far one of the best recipes I have ever had along with being so easy to make! The sauce is light and I always make a little extra to go with the rice or couscous. Wonderful recipe and a keeper at our house.

Delicious.  I only changed a few things. No sazon seasoning so I used a combination of paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic salt, ancho chile. I used melted butter instead of blend and dill instead of basil, which was yummy! I also didn't have onion powder so I chopped up some scallions.  I liked my additions and would make it again.

I have to post because this dish is delicious!! I hate fish but am on a low carb diet and heard Tilapia is one of the least fishy tasting fish so I was looking for a stellar recipe....this is it!! Thanks to another reviewer who posted this:  I too had difficulty finding Sazon in my grocery stores - so I made my own after searching on google, 1 tsp each of: salt, garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, cumin, corriander

I followed the recipe and made the seasoning above. AMAZING!!

Amazing Idea for a great recipe. I altered it to make it much healthier and It turned out AMAZING! Rather than using butter and mayo I used olive oil and Greek yogurt. I would recommend this to ANYONE and to try something simple like swapping fat for yogurt in your cooking.

Excellent recipe! My husband does not like fish but he came back for seconds and thirds. I did substitute Old Bay for sazon seasoning, and I had to broil the fish for a few more minutes at the end to get the golden brown coating. The fish was moist and very flavorful. A definite keeper! Thank you.

This dish was amazing!!!  I used Cavendar's seasoning in place of the sazon seasoning and omitted the celery salt.   Turned out great.  I will be adding this to my dinner rotation!!!

I don't know what sazon seasoning is, so I just use a little old bay and some thyme.  This is probably my most used recipe on this site.

Cooked this tonight after reading the rave reviews. It is quick to prepare, beautiful to look at, moist, and just too salty. If I do it again I'm not using any salt at all.

This was WAY too salty for us, and I used celery seed not salt! If you DON'T like fish, you will like this recipe b/c it hides the flavor of the Tilapia. IF I try this again, I will use a FRACTION of the amount of Parmesan. Disappointing.

Really easy to make and really yummy!  My husband does not generally like fish, but since having this the first time, he's asked me to make it several more times.  A great, healthy choice.  I replaced the margarine with olive oil, and omitted the mayo, and it's perfect!

My husband LOVES this recipe! Don't change a thing! The only thing I did different, is I double the sauce. Used half on the fish while cooking it, and the other half I heat up in the microwave and use over the veggies, rice or whatever I cook with the fish. I don't have Miami seasoning, so I just sprinkled onion, garlic, paprika, and parsley over the fish before cooking per one reviewer. This recipe is true to the prep and cook time. I think it too longer for me to make my sides than this delish fish!

I made this last night for dinner and everyone loved it! My husband pronounced it restaurant quality. (I used real butter and light mayo.) Made up a batch of sazon as suggested by a reviewer since I had everything including dried cilantro, and ground it up in a spice mill. Worked great. This recipe will be terrific on any white fish.

It was good.  I think I need to add more seasoning to give it a little more flavor.  I used a real lemon and that gave it a little more zest.  I will do it again. Had corn on the cob and salad with it.

Yummy! I thought that the strong flavor of the parmesan might be to overpowering for the tilapia but it turned out to be really good.  I only seasoned the fish with salt, pepper and lemon juice and added some breadcrumbs to the cheese blend, it gave it a nice crunch.

HOLY TILAPIA! There's nothing fishy about this recipe... it's flawless and delicious. Don't change a thing. I doubled the parm mixture and I could have made more, every milimeter of fish needs to be slathered in its goodness. YUM! Will make this part of my regular rotation.

Will make this again for sure, love the sauce.  Added chili flakes and my own take on the spices for added heat and was amazing.  Will try this again on other meats; a must try.

Fabulous!  Best fish recipe ever (from my kitchen anyway).  I didn't have the Miami-style seasoning so I used Chinese five-spice.  The cinnamon in that threw me off a little but my family raved anyway!

This recipe is very good. My family has had me make it twice this week, and so easy to make.

I love this recipe!  I did not use Tilapia because it seemed really expensive so I used Alaskan Pollock.  I made it for supper last night and lunch today.

If I could give the zero stars I would. I didn‚Äôt have that weird seasoning that was called for like many others so I used the suggestions as listed in the comments. Absolutely the most disgusting thing I‚Äôve ever made. There is so much salt it‚Äôs un edible. Run away. Far away.

I prepared this for my SO in an attempt to divert from eating so much fried fish.  It was a winner!! The fish literally melted in your mouth. He now requests this particular preparation on a regular basis. I use a Creole or Blackened Seasoning in lieu of Sazon. For a little herb flavor, I sometimes substitute Italian Seasoning for the basil, which is included in the blend. I have used both the bottled parmesan as well as the fresh grated; I think I prefer them mixed, but the bottled ie Kraft, does the job just fine. I am thinking about trying it to prepare flounder.

Excellent!I have made this recipe for years and my teenagers love it! I  use low fat mayo, I can't bring myself to use the fat free stuff.  But, either way the butter adds a lot of flavor. Just make sure when you top fish with mayo topping that it's hot and bubbly before removing from oven.  I also double the mayo/parmesan and lop it on.

We usually use the fiery fish tacos recipe from this site whenever we cook tilapia (very cheap fish).  We grill the fish for the tacos.  Well, as luck would have it, it was pouring rain whenever it was time to start preparing dinner.  Luckily, I found this recipe. I used Old Bay seasoning (sparingly) in place of the Sazon whatever seasoning and low fat olive oil mayo vs the fat free because it was what I keep on hand.  My husband and three teenaged sons all liked it.  This is a very nice recipe to turn a cheap piece of fish into something eveyrone would eat :)

This has become a favorite. I've served it for company several times over a bed of small leaf spinach and it continually gets rave reviews.  It works fine to make the lemon-cheese paste up a day ahead and store in the frig. until ready to broil the fish.  I cover a jelly roll pan with foil and broil the seasoned fish for 2 minutes and turn.  Apply the lemon-cheese paste to the second side and slip under the broiler for another 2-3 minutes.  Quick and delicious!

I made this for dinner tonight. We have one in the family that is on a low sodium diet so I only sprinkled a little sazon seasoning on and I didnt have celery salt so didnt use that at all.  My husband suggested maybe try a little garlic next time, which I will try, but everyone came back for seconds so it was a hit! Not an easy task for a large family! Thank you for posting.

Great recipe! I used a light coating of Old Bay (I live in MD :) in place of the Miami style seasoning which was FANTASTIC! I believe that Seasoned Salt would also be suitable in place of the Sazon.  Also, before serving, I sprinkled each filet with a little lemon juice as well.  Everyone just loved this dish! I will definitely be making this again.  Next time, I may make my version of a spicy remoulade sauce for dipping.

A delicious Tilapia recipe.  I had no Miami style seasoning so I substituted seasoned salt and it turned out wonderful. Next time however I would make a little extra Parmesan sauce. This recipe gives a already wonderful tasting fish  a new spin.

This was good but seasoning was a bit strong, I did not have Sazon seasoning so tried with a mix of cumin, coriander, paprika, garlic powder, salt and pepper, as recommended in one of the reviews.  Next time I might just use lemon pepper.  My girlfriend really loved it though but she is not a fan of fish and I think she liked that the seasoning pretty much obliterated the fish taste, lol.

Absolutely love this recipe! My husband and kids love it too, they were licking their plates! I didn't have sazon seasoning so I just sprinkled garlic salt, pepper, onion powder, and paprika on the fish and it came out perfect. There is a tremendous amount of flavor. 

Almost better than how yummy it tastes is the fact that this recipe uses low cost ingredients that I always keep on hand. Great to throw together quickly without worrying about whether I have all the ingredients or not.

This was a big hit!  I used low-fat mayo and real butter, used dried lemon peel (available in the spice section) since I didn't have fresh lemons on hand, and forgot to add the basil but didn't miss it.  I also made the homemade sazon seasoning another viewer recommended since I couldn't find it in the store.  I broiled the fish for 2 minutes on each side before adding the crust but had to broil it 7 minutes (the last 2 on high broil) to get the crust to brown a bit, and the fish seemed a bit overcooked.  Next time I would put the crust on after broiling on just one side for 2 minutes, and there will definitely be a next time!  Very delicious and easy!

This was good, but not great. Be careful with the lemon a little goes a long way. My Tilapia cooked really quick and I followed the directions exactly. I felt like the mix should have gone on sooner.

This dish tasted amazing! Since I also did not have Sazon seasoning, I used fresh parsley, fresh onion & minced garlic to season it! This was also my first time cooking fish & I recommend this recipe to anyone who enjoys a great fish dish!

I really liked it, but my husband did not.  Felt the Parmesan was overwhelming.  And it was a bit salty.  Will try again, but will cut back Parmesan and add some plain or seasoned bread crumbs and a little less mayo and salt.  I didn't have sazon so used lemon pepper - should have tried what MsLisa did.

It has good flavor,  but a little over powering for my taste. Next time I personally would use less sazon and no mayonaise.

I just don't think my family likes parmesan cheese that much because we didn't like this recipe at all.  It was edible, but I won't make it again.  We don't like fish flavor, that's why we use tilapia; however, the parmesan, lemon and seasonings in this dish really emphasized the fish flavor, not hid it.

FANTASTIC!!!!!   Even the family members who don't usually like fish, loved this!  Omitted the lemon zest, since others commented on it being too lemony. Couldn't find sazon salt so made the homemade version using salt, garlic powder, pepper, paprika,cumin, creole seasoning, onion powder. These were all seasonings I already had on hand.

What a wonderful recipe for Tilapia. That sazon seasoning really makes this dish and can be used on other seafood. Just google sazon  or search one of the her reviews for the ingredients. Try it you'll love it.

fantastic!  I made was to grill on the grill instead of in the oven.  I've made both ways and my family preferred the outdoor grill. Added smoked paprika to the mayo mixture. Also, used fresh basil minced on top just before serving instead of putting dried basil in mayo mixture. We will add this to our rotation!!!

As most have said, everyone I made this for loved this receipe.  I did have to search for the Sazon Completa in 3 different stores but it turned out to be worth it.  I finally found it in Publix on the internation isle.  Badia is the company that makes it, but I also saw some by Knorr.  I had never tried this spice combination before, but I put it in a lot of receipies now.

Really delicious and fast! I didn't have sazon seasoning, so I sprinkled the fillets with cumin and garlic powder (two which I read are in sazon). Other than that. I made it as written and it was great. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This was incredible! I did not have sazon so I used Old Bay seasoning. I grilled the fish to start, then put the sauce on and broiled to completion. The sauce seemed just a tiny bit too thick to spread, so I added a bit of the lemon juice. it was very flavorful! Even my picky kids ate it, and I was not inclined to open the tartar sauce. This is definitely a recipe I will make again soon. Thanks so much!!

One word, Amazing!
I'm cooking more for my good friend so he can give it a try!...... One thing though.. I didn't know what to bake it on so I just went with 400 but for some odd reason it took a while to get the crust brown.. and even then, it wasn't as brown as the picture, but ultimately... WILL be cooking again!

I'm NOT a fish eater. Completely grosses me out, yet I know the health & weightloss benefits, so I thought I'd force myself to get used to it. OMG...no need to force myself with this recipe! Just to say it edible to me it a huge compliment but it went beyond that to actually GOOD tasting! Love it!

Very good and very tasty! The first time I made this I followed another reviewers advice and made more of the sauce to put on top and it was just too much.  This time I followed it precisely and it was wonderful! Very moist, very tender, and very flaky! Also, extremely easy to prepare which is a plus in my household!

SO GOOD! i didn't have the sazon seasoning, so I used Goya Adobo. This tastes like it's from a fancy expensive seafood restaurant, and it was very easy. Thank you so much! I think i'll have to make tilapia like this everytime I make it now!

Sooo good!  I couldn't find Miami-style sazon seasoning (discovered McCormick discontinued it) so we used Old Bay seasoning and it was great! We have had this each week now since trying it because we like it so much and it's not very many Weight-Watcher points.

I served this for Sunday dinner to my 19 yo daughter and her boyfriend and she declared it "the best meal you've ever made, Mom!"  I served it with steamed broccoli and my own recipe for French Onion rice.  I made it exactly as written except I used Garlic Pepper instead of just pepper, and I added some cayenne, in the topping and I didn't have any sazon seasoning so I sprinkled it with Old Bay Garlic Herb seasoning before broiling it.  I also doubled the ingredients for the topping because I had ten pieces of fish and I recommend making more anyway because I covered the fish completely with the topping and I think that's what made iit!   Great, great recipe that I will be making many, many more times in the future!

I was looking for quick, painless and delicious and this fit the bill!  There was enough cheese spread to cover 6 filets and since it was all I had, I used regular seasoned salt (just sprinkled, not 2T), butter & regular mayonnaise.

This dish is really beautiful, and if you want a dish that covers up the taste of fish, this is perfect!  We love fish, however, and enjoy lighter, delicate flavors, but the lemon is very nice in this dish.  DO USE fat free items as you can in this, because it is rich. The broiled topping turns this lovely golden brown color and looks great on the plate!  We used barramundi fish.

We loved this recipe, the topping makes a lot and you could cut that in half to save on calories. A quick, easy recipe which made my tilapia skeptical meat loving husband eat fish. A keeper for me! Thank you.

I am eating this now and am definitely enjoying it.  It was very simple to make.   I didn't have everything the recipe requested, but I don't think that affected the taste any.  I didn't have any lemon zest, so just omitted that.  I didn't have any fat free mayo, so used regular.  I didn't, as many reviewers have stated, have the Sazon seasoning, so I used the recipe so nicely shared by another reviewer:  1 tsp each of: salt, garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, cumin, coriander - this was more than enough for the four fillets.

One reviewer said she makes a double batch of the Parmesan topping to save as dipping sauce.  I kept back a little of the liquid to try that and find it adds a really nice flavor to the finished fish.

The children haven't finished eating yet, but they haven't turned their noses up.  Lol.  I definitely will be making it again for myself.

The recipe for sazon seasoning looks a lot like that for Madras Curry, which I had here so I used that.  Also, based on complaints of the fish being too rich the first time I made it, I reduced the butter and mayonnaise by nearly half the second time around.  Much better reviews in my crowd as a result and the cheese browned more too.  This recipe is fast and easy and looks great on a plate.

We love this.  It's very good, and still works great if need to tweak or substitute with other spices if you don't have all that is here.  I have sprinkled with Slap Ya' Mama seasoning and then did mince garlic & other with the butter, parmesan & mayo mixture.  Definitely staying on my regular list of things to cook.

we really liked it.  I am always on the lookout for new ways to cook fish since my family gets bored with it, we eat fish a lot!  Good flavor and easy to do.  Thanks for another great  week night option!

Wow - this is a really good and different way to serve fish.  Would definitely make again.  Thanks to one reviewer who provided the ingredients for Sazon seasoning I made my own using ingredients that I had in my pantry. No need to buy Sazon seasoning when you most likely have everything to throw it together!

THIS WAS SOOOO GOOD!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have the light versions of some of the ingredients.  I typically don't like fish that much, but this was absolutely delicious!  Pretty easy to make, too!  I'll be adding this to my repertoire - will be making this a lot going forward.  No need to change a thing about the recipe!  It was amazing.

I couldn't find anything called Sazon Completa.  I found Sazon Goya Sin Achiote at my local grocery store.  It was orange colored.  Not sure if it's exactly the same as Sazon completa, but was soo good!

Didn't have sazon seasoning so I just used equal parts paprika, cumin, coriander, and garlic salt. I also substituted 0% Fage yogurt for the mayo but used real butter.

I added extra lemon juice so the topping was too liquid for the parmesan to brown (I used finely grated cheese so it mixed well), but it became a nice thick sauce that tasted great.  Served he fish with seasoned brown rice and lemon-garlic broccoli.  Will definitely make it again.

This is by far the BEST recipe I have ever used for broiled fish.  I used Old Bay seasoning instead of Sazon  because that's what I had in the pantry.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

Had this for dinner tonight and it was sooo good. Will definitely make again. Just be careful of broiling times; watch the fish because talapia is a delicate thin fish that cooks quickly.

Delightful and very tasty!  I made a few substitutions because of 2 ingredients I did not have on hand, but it was very tasty & will definitely keep this one as a regular.  (Did not have the Miami seasoning, so I used Nature's Recipe with a little Tony Cachere's.  Also, used 1/4 c mozz & 1/4 c parmesan.)

Didn't have sazon, so just used hungarian paprika,salt, pepper.  Used fresh basil and real mayo, real butter.
I prepare fish often and this is the best tasting ever.  Only broiled a minute on one side, 2 minutes after adding the parmesan mixture.   I like my fish flaky.

This was awesome. HurdBird admitted having licked the plate, I sopped up every dab left on my plate and then scrapped up all the little curmudgeons off the foil before throwing it away. The only thing I'll change next time is we will have a nice glass of White Wine with this dish! I had no idea what Sazon was. So not having it, I used Durshi's homemade recipe and it turned out great. Thanks Durshi!

Really enjoyed this! Used Paul Prudhomme's Seafood Seasoning instead of the Miami Seasoning, and didn't melt the butter first just kinda mashed it in with the mayo. Got 2 thumbs up from hubby and my 6 year old son!

This was a very good recipe.  The only thing I didnt have was the corriander for the seasoning. It didnt matter.  I was expecting a strong flavor but nope, it was perfect!  I even coated it in seasoning like the video shows.  I will be making this monthly :)

Followed the recipe almost exactly, except I didn't have any lemons so I left out the zest. I even made my own sazon seasoning, as another reviewer did. Huge hit with my husband and I loved it as well! We'll definitely be having this again!

The best received Parmesan Tilapia recipe on this site.  Everyone ate it and I followed the recipe as best I could, using the regular Sazon and some Old Bay in place of the suggested seasoning.  The lemon and lemon zest really give the fish a good flavor.  Next time I may sprinkle some panko crumbs on top.  It is a keeper.

WOW!WOW!WOW! I have always thought of tilapia as the "bland fish" until trying this recipe! Amazing!! I have tried many recipes but this is the first time I have ever used my broiler...and I am no a broiling woman! These fish came out so juicy and seasoned. I sprayed cooking oil on them first then used sea salt, garlic powder and some cayenne pepper on the tilapias. I didn't have any lemon but a tangerine in the fridge and I used the juice on the fish. I tasted the fish before adding the Mozzarella-Tangerine (Had no Parmesan on hand either) and these were so delicious I only placed the dressing on two of them and they all came out great! Thanks MOM2398 for making me a broiler and tilapia fan!!!

4 stars because I changed is slightly.  Used Citrus Grill seasoning since I didn't have Miami style, so I left lemon out since it was already in the seasoning.  Didn't use any other seasoning. Added some Old Bay to the mayo/cheese mix - the fish was great!

This was excellent! I didn't have celery seed or lemon zest, but otherwise made as written. Will plan farther ahead the next time. It did make a lot of topping though. Plan to try the leftovers on chicken in a few days.

Absolutely WOW!  Probably THE BEST FISH RECIPE I've ever tried.  My husband kept raving over and over again how good this was.  I did not make this low-carb, so I used real butter and real mayonnaise (which would still work for serious Atkins dieters).  The taste was spectacular.  I made my own sazon seasoning per another reviewers suggestion, and it was wonderful.  That would have been great even without the parmeson cheese blend, but then that parmesan cheese blend was fantastic.  We will be making this a regular dish in our house.

I used garlic powder and salt instead of the sazon season simply because I did not have the sazon season on hand.  I also used a teaspoon of very finely chopped onion instead of onion powder.

Tried this last night and it was a hit! Hubby said to add it to the dinner rotation! I had Tajin (that I usually season fajita meat with) on hand, and I was glad to find a tilapia recipe using it.

Based on all the 5 star ratings, I made this last night for company without testing it first and everyone loved it!!  Delish.  Based on another's suggestion, I made the sazon spice:  1 tsp each of: salt, garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, cumin, corriander (I crushed the seeds).  Definitely a keeper!

My kids don't like fish, they ate everything!
I didn't have any Sazon, but read the other reviews and used their suggestions (1tsp each garlic, pepper, paprika, cumin, parsley, and creole seasoning for the salt).  I did add a dash of dill (personal prefference).  It was wonderful!  Served with Quinoa and corn/carrot/asparagus vegatable mixture.  Kids asked for seconds!

Easy to make.  Everyone likes it.  I usually go a little easy on the lemon juice and, as others have advised, make a little more of the sauce than is called for.

Great recipe. I used bass instead of tilapia and baked it in butter instead of broiling it. I also didn't have the Sazon so I used seasoning salt. My husband said it was one of the best meals I've made. I also loved it and since I'm not a huge fan of fish it says a lot. it was also very good with sauvingon blanc. A must try!

This was a great recipe.  Like many others, I could not find Sazon so I just used a seafood blend spice that I had. My 13 year old daughter love tilapia so I wanted to try cooking it at home. I served it over rice with a side of beans.  I thought it was great but my daughter thought it had a little bit too much lemon. We will try again with less lemon!

This was quick and delicious. My husband really enjoyed it and told me I should definitely remember this. So I put it in my recipe box. Thanks so much for a delicious spin on tilapia.

This was excellent and easy. I too didn't have sazon seasoning but I googled it and found some substitutes.  I will use this on other fish too.  I was out of basil, so I used Italian seasonings.  Found the basil afterwards :) Do not add salt to this recipe.  Will definitely make this again.

This was VERY good except I thought with the lemon zest it was too lemony.  Next time I will try without the zest.

My husband lived in Hawaii for 5 years and became a 'fish snob'. He turns his nose up at fish from a store here in the mountains. I made this for him and made him try it--he ended up eating the most of it! Such a good recipe. I couldn't find Sazon so I mixed Caribbean Jerk seasoning with a little bit of Fiesta Lime seasonings. Also, if it's a bit too 'lemony' try using orange zest, it tones down the tartness a bit.

Delicious.  I did not have any Miami-style sazon seasoning on hand.  I added 1/4 tsp each garlic powder and paprika.  I will likely add a little more garlic and celery salt next time if I don't have the sazon.  My husband and daughter (not a fish lover) both liked this a lot.

Yum!  Husband raved!  I too did not have all the spices, but what made this recipe wonderful was the Parmesan crust.  We will be making this again.  I would imagine even a person that did not like fish would like the flavor of this dish.

I didn't have sazon so I used mccormick cajun seasoning. I served over steamed carrots with mashed potatoes. I did broil the fish about 5 minutes longer than suggested as I like it a bit crispy around the edges. This meal will be served often. Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious! I don't know what sazon seasoning is, so used a mixed herb seasoning that I had on hand. Followed the recipe apart from that and so glad I did! My boyfriend has declared this his new favourite dish. I'll be making this again often.

This is a recipe that my husband requests! I love it. It is easy to make and relatively healthy with the use of the no fat mayo. I have read that some other reviewers have trouble finding the sazon seasoning. Look for it in the hispanic section of your grocery store.

I tried this recipe based on the excellent reviews it received and boy were they right. Hot diggity dog! I will be making this again! Delicious healthy way to eat fish, and so fast and easy. Went great with my vegetable medley. The only substitutions I made were out of necessity, since I didn't have exactly what it called for. I used olive oil instead of butter, regular mayo since I didn't have fat free, and for the sazon I mixed Mrs. Dash, cumin, and garlic granulars. When the fish was done I squeezed some fresh lemon juice on top of the concoction and devoured the whole thing.

This was a big hit.  I wasn't sure what was in Miami-style sazon seasoning so I used Italian seasoning and it was yummy.  This is a quick easy dish, great for beginner cooks and looks nice enough to serve to company.

This was delicious, My family has two types of people. The lemon lovers and the non. This was perfect for both! I substituted sazon with season salt. next time I'll broil it a little more after I put the mixture on, but other then that. This was delicious!
