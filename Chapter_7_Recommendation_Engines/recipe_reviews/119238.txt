I thought this recipe was very good. It was fresh and tasty. I took the advice of another reviewer and used black beans instead of kidney beans. Delicious! I will definitely make it again.

This is a tasty salad! I needed to find a recipe that allowed me to use up some things in my fridge, while also not using a lot of ingredients that I didn't have around because they are too expensive in the winter. This recipe came to the closest to meeting those requirements. I had to make a couple of changes, but not too many. Having previous experiences with similar salads, I used only about 2 to 2 1/2 cups of rice, and I used brown rice for health reasons and because I already had it cooked up in my house. I used pinto beans instead of kidney, and cucumbers instead of peppers. I had no green onions, so I used regular white onion instead. Other than these changes (and using olive oil instead of canola) this salad was great! Because I used less rice, the salad was more flavorful. Thanks for sharing the recipe...I'll make it again!!!

Replace red beans w/ black and rice w/ basmati rice. Becomes exceptional. Try Kroger's Chipolte Lime Chicken breast w/ it. Grill and slice. Serve on top as complete dinner salad.

Made this for an office potluck.  I got many good reviews from my co-workers.  This recipe as written will make a large amount; I anticipated around 25 servings but ended up eating the leftovers for about 4 days.  Very good, and very filling.

This is excellent! Made it for a "Mexican Fiesta" dinner with the British in-laws. I substituted black beans for the kidney beans, and used red pepper as well. Everybody LOVED it. I will definitely make it again! Very fresh-tasting and attractive, and a nice change from traditional mexican side dishes. One thing--this recipe makes A LOT! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a very refreshing, colorful way to serve beans and rice.  I used black beans and red pepper (my preference) and it was delicious.    I made this a second time using cooked orzo in place of the rice and that was very good, too.  You need more dressing, however, if you use orzo.  Very nice recipe and I plan on serving it a lot this summer, as it holds well in the refrigerator.

Fantastic! I too swapped black beans for the red - added a can of corn for color- and my gang likes more prominent taste so upped the garlic, cilantro, cumin, and lime juice.  A big hit , will certainly make again!

We loved this salad.  I added 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper, and doubled the cilantro for our personal taste.  I used yellow and orange peppers because that is what I had on hand. Thank you for a great recipe.

Very tasty. I've made it a few times now. Once using kidney beans & twice using black beans. The black beans won, plus the extra red chili pepper flakes are great for those who like it spicy. :)

Yum. Loved it. A nice way to use black olives and they go very well with the beans, I found. I did not have any green pepper, but I added finely shredded carrots instead. Also used parsley instead of cilantro. Add a green salad and you have a nice meat-free meal.

Not a huge fan of this.  Very very lime-y is the only way I can describe it.  My daughter ate one bite and that's it and husband ate it and said it was okay.  The olives were kinda weird in this as well.  :(

New go to side dish for us! Made this as a side with a Mexican main dish the other night.  Used black beans and red pepper as had been mentioned by another reviewer.  Not only was the salad beautiful, and sooo tasty! I forsee this dish on our table many more times in the future!

I loved it for the most part, but it seemed to be lacking something, maybe I'll try some salsa next time. I will say I think this would be great as the stuffing for enchiladas smothered with cheese and enchilada sauce! Yum.

Awesome dish!!!  I actually didn't need to change anything or add anything to this recipe and it was delicious.  If you don't like kidney beans just switch it out for your fav beans.  Thanks for the recipe
