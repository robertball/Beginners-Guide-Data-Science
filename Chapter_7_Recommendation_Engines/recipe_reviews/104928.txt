Here is a variation on this recipe which I have always made, and everyone always loves. (I love the idea of using zucchini and yellow squash and putting tomato slices on top! New additions to my old favorite.)
3 cups grated zucchini, 4 beaten eggs, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup grated/shredded parmesan, 1 cup Bisquick (baking mix), 2 chopped large onions, salt and pepper. Mix all and put in greased pie dish. Bake at 350 for 1 hour. Serve hot, cold or room temperature.

I am so glad I tried this recipe.  It was delicious and easy to make.  The only thing I did different was that I sprinkled the top with an Italian seasoning blend that included parmesan cheese, oregano, basil and garlic.  That made the pie look and taste impressive.  It looked so good that a coworker asked me, "Where did you buy that quiche?"  As you may have guessed, I told her I made it and was very proud to say so.

Absolutely to die for.  If you are looking for a Zucchini Quiche recipe...look no further.  I chose to shred my zucchini and squash because the kids tend to not want to eat it if they can see it.  Experiment using different types of grated cheese.  My husband likes bacon bits added.  I have made this 3 times in the past month...great addition to any meal.  I even ate a piece for breakfast!!

I made this for the first time for a family gathering, everyone loved it! I did do a "test run" and decided to add another layer of tomatoes. I poured half of mixture into pan and put a layer of tomatoes and parmesean, then poured the rest of "batter" with the other layer of tomatoes and parm. I had to cook a little longer but it was better with more tomatoes!

This was fantastic! I love squash and zucchini and was excited to find a new way to try them. This recipe did not disappoint. I'm giving it 5 stars because it meets my three requirements of a great recipe--easy to prepare, few ingredients, and delicious. I used only about half of the oil and use more squash than it called for so also added one extra egg. I baked mine in a 8x8 glass baking dish so had to cook it for closer to an hour. I often find quiche recipes to be too eggy--too heavy and rich. But the Bisquick in this recipe made it light and fluffy and not too rich at all. Now that I know this trick, there are all sorts of variations that I can't wait to try! Thanks for the great idea!!

I had way too much produce this year. Thought I would get rid of it at a church pot luck with this recipe. Did I ever!! Wasn't any left when I got up there and had to make another to see how it tasted. This was delicious. Added garlic (because I love it) and was very nice looking for presentation. Will keep this one handy. Have used different summer squashes too!

I AM REVIEWING THIS RECIPE EXACTLY HOW IT WAS WRITTEN.  it was good 'as is' and could be improved upon with more cheese(s), herbs and spices-as most reviewers suggested.  but it's a great starting out spot in which you can build upon

This is excellent!!  I found that it didn't need quite as much oil as the recipe called for (I used olive oil and it was a little greasy--maybe because I used cheddar cheese on top).  I also added olives and green onions.  Yum!!

Moist (not runny) bread like (but not too bready).  I shredded half the veggies and sliced the rest. (otherwise I followed the recipe exactly)  The tomatoes are great on top. Next time I'll try Roma tomatoes and feta cheese sprinkled on top. Perhaps some fresh basil, spinach, and mozzarella mixed in too?  Update: 2nd time making it I didn't have baking mix, so I used 1 cup of flour 1tbls baking powder, 2tsp sugar, 2 tbls melted butter,

This is a great recipe that is easy to prepare and uses a lot of zucchini.  I loved the flavor and texture.  I did add an extra half up of bisquick like others had suggested and I drained some of the liquid from my zucchini but not all.  Next time I think I will saute the onions before mixing them into the mixture because they were still slightly crunchy after being cooked which I don't usually care for (but it didn't take away from the great taste).  This is definatly a keeper and I will use it often.

This is an excellent recipe! The only changes I made were to substitute with  brocoli as that is what I had on hand, stewed tomatoes for fresh as I was making stewed tomatoes from a recipe on this site, cut the oil to about 1/8 cup of EVOO and baked them in a lined/sprayed muffin tin for about 15 minutes for a grab and go morning meal. Next time if I have a group to cook for I will make it into a pie. Thanks Mimi!

This recipe is a summer favorite!  Great to bring to those summer parties and use up the rest of those zucchini's in your garden or your neighbors!  I used 3 eggs, 1/2 cup Parmesan on the inside, plus an additional layer on top, I add nutmeg, pepper, hickory bacon salt, and some garlic to taste, top with roma tomatoes and fresh basil leaves for a pretty pie!  I recommend adding the top layer of cheese & tomatoes during the last 10-15 minutes of baking.  Putting the tomatoes ON TOP of the cheese makes for a prettier presentation in my opinion.  If you use fresh basil leaves sneak them under the tomatoes when you pull out the pie because they'll burn in the oven.

We liked this a LOT. It was breadier than I thought it would be (I was expecting more of a quiche), but it doesn't claim to be a quiche, so I can't knock it for that. I used a very sweet red onion and also sprinkled some cheddar on top with the parm. I had seconds, and we topped it with sour cream and sided it with a sweet salad. Excellent meal!

Perfect summer dinner! After a trip to a local farmer down the street, I prepared this perfect pie with fresh picked corn on the cob as a side. I used half as much oil as called for and I used 4 cups zucchini/squash, a couple cups of mushrooms, a handful of chives, and some fresh basil leaves from my neighbor's garden. I also topped the pie generously with garden roma tomatoes. My family really enjoyed the results!

Absolutely fantastic.  I only had yellow squash so I used three cups yellow squash.  I also used about 1 cup sliced onions.  I put half the mixture in the pie pan and then put sliced tomatoes on top and then put the other half mixture with slice tomatoes on top.  I then sprinkled with parmesan and cheddar cheese - soooo goood!

As I popped the recipe in the oven, I realized I had forgotten to add the 1/4 cup of Vegetable oil with the eggs.  I took out of the oven and added the oil, using a knife to work in as best I could.  I kept telling DH that I would probably be making scrambled eggs for supper, but, this recipe is very forgiving as it turned out perfect.  I used 1 cup each of zucchini and summer squash and added 1 cup of cubed ham.  Threw in a bit of fresh spinach I wanted to use up.  DH kept saying "this is delicious" and when he reheated left-overs for lunch today, he said it again.  I did bake at 350 degrees for one hour.  Probably because of all that oil that needed to cook in.  Thanks, Suzanne for a wonderful recipe!

Be sure to use lots of salt, pepper and Parmesan, otherwise this is very bland.  A whole tomato is probably too much, because that's really all I could taste.  A disappointment, since it sounds good and looks pretty.

I LIGHTENED this up by using Egg Beaters, reduced fat Biscuik, and only about 1 Tbl of oil.   Added more zucchini (cuz I love it and I can't help myself......this is why I don't bake!!); mixed the parm and some fresh basil right into base;  chopped instead of whole tomatoe slices so I could have tomato in every bite.    Could not find my pie dishes (really??!?!!! cuz I KNOW I have two of them !!!.......guess it's been a while since I baked a pie !!)   Used an 11x7 and had to bake an extra 20 min for over 50 min total.  
Would also be great with spinach and/or artichokes added !

Good, but needed some "zing". Would be OK, if you have a blander palate.

I customized this and it was fabulous! I made the recipe as described, but added lots of chopped, fresh dill and added 2 T shredded cheddar. I also made it in a round, glass casserole dish, which increased the cooking time to about 55-minutes. I can't wait to make it again!

This was delicious.  Like another reader, I put a center layer of tomatoes and Parmesan and then more tomatoes and Parmesan on top.  This is good for brunch, lunch and dinner.  Just use a little imagination on the "go withs".  I see lots of possibilities in substitutions using the basics.

Pretty good. Recipe calls for way too much oil. 1 tbsp is enough. My family doesn't eat cheese, so I sprinkled Italian bread crumbs on top for a crust. For flavor, I put fresh garlic and Italian seasoning into the mix. Next time, I'll try adding a ham bouillon cube or chopped ham. The tomatoes make this dish so don't skimp!

I L-O-V-E this recipe!  It is sooooo easy and yummy.  I add extra parmesan on top b/c I like lots of cheese.  I also use seasoned salt instead of regular salt. I highly recommend this one!

This is a very tasty pie.  It didn't remind me of quiche, more of a thick crust pizza. Good way to use zucchini and summer squash.  I used dried onions instead of fresh, tasted just fine.  Will make this one again.

Yum! My daughter didn't love this but the rest of us really enjoyed! I used the baking mix recipe from this site and made it low fat by using oil instead of shortening. Thanks Suzanne!

Super!  Both my husband and I really like this.  The only changes I made were to add bacon and 2 cloves of garlic.  I did have to bake it for about 45/50 minutes rather than 35.

Excellent recipe!  I tried to reduce the fat by using 3 eggs and 1/4 cup Egg Beaters, 1/8 cup olive oil with 1/8 cup skim milk, and Reduced Fat Bisquick.  I used a can of drained, diced tomatoes with basil and garlic and I threw in 2 oz of leftover crumbled Feta with the Parmesan.  Different texture but great!

Yummy!!!  I added fresh basil from the garden and skipped the diced onions. I sprinkled in some onion powder. I also added some cheddar cheese to the top then covered with the tomatoes then parmesan cheese. It was very beautiful in and out of the oven. I was leery at first, afraid my husband wouldn't like it but he loved it!!!!

I added some miscellaneous spices, but wished I had added a bit more salt.  For those of you who don't know what "to taste" means (like me!), I would suggest at least a tsp of salt.  I added just a dash, which was not enough for my taste.  However, I salted my lovely slice of quiche-y pie and really enjoyed.  You can always add more cheese to enhance the flavor, but as is, this is a tasty and healthy dish.  I really enjoyed and will definitely make again!

This recipe was great! I did the recipe as is and it cooked perfect. I did broil the top at the end to get cheese melted and browned. This will be a great recipe to use this summer when I have tons of fresh veggies from the garden.

I was a little disapointed with this.  It was more cake like than quiche.  I add a spice minture and did love all the vegies.  I may try again using on reviewers half mixture a layer of tomatos and cheese and then another layer.

We were disappointed in this crustless quiche.  It was "bready" instead of "eggy" and kind of dry.  My other crustless quiche recipes include milk and some type of cheese in the mixture, which makes it more moist and creamy.  We tried.

Really good....I shredded the zucchini, yellow squash and onion in my food processor and also added the grated cheese to the entire mix instead of just on top. I also added some fresh cracked pepper and a lil sea salt. Tasty!

So good!  I was looking for recipes to get my non-squash loving husband to appreciate summer squash and this fit the bill.  He now gets excited when he sees me making it.  I'm sad summer squash season is at it's end.  I follow the recipe exactly and add about a teaspoon of dried thyme.  Yum!

Came out awesome.  I baked in a round bottom casserole dish and had to cook for 55 minutes on 350.  Didn't have tomatoes on hand, but still turned out good. Our picky 6 year old daughter didn't like it, but our 2 year old son (who helped me make it) thought it was quite tasty! :)

Delicious. I reduced the oil by half, added a middle layer of tomatoes and about a teaspoon of thyme (because it's great with both eggs and zucchini). I'll definitely be making this one again.

This was not at all what I was expecting.  I made as directed with the exception of cutting by a 4th as I was only making for myself.  I found the taste to be very reminiscent of an egg and biscuit sandwich (with tomatoes & squash).  I felt it was better after having sat for 10 minutes (I was starved and wolfed the first half right out of oven).  I'd like to try this again, only adding a little diced bacon & perhaps cheddar cheese.

Allrecipes reviews did not let me down on this one. Because of the high rating, I gave this recipe a shot, and it was delicious! I've made it 4 times now for different events, and it has been a hit. Adding basil, italian seasoning, and oregano is a great way to add more flavor, to your liking. I served it with turkey sausages and toast for brunch. Yum!

This recipe has been in rotation since the first time I tried it.  Just delicious and always gets raves.  The first few times I made it, I only used zucchini, instead of half zukes and half yellow squash.  I finally tried it with both, as the recipe calls for, and prefer it that way.  It makes it slightly more moist and adds to the flavor.  I sometimes use part EVO and part regular olive oil or canola oil.  I make sure to cover the entire pie with generous slices of ripe tomato.  That's the piece de resistance.

This is an amazing way to use fresh veggies! I love finding recipes for vegetables that don't rely on copious amounts of cheese. I followed the recipe exactly, plus added 1/2 a large carton of fresh mushrooms. Spectacular. I did have to bake it longer than 35 minutes to cook the baking mix in the middle, ended up being close to an hour. Delicious. This one will be made often in my apartment :)

Its a nice idea and looks great, but it was bland and I just didn't like the texture. It was too bready. The vegetable combination is alright, but the tomatoes do overpower the rest of the pie. In the future I will probaly make it as a real quice,  leave off the tomatoes. and double the cheese

I thought this was good. Although I had to cook it an extra 15-20 min. I would suggest cooking the pie without the cheese and tomato for about 15 min, then add cheese and tomato and cook the remaining 35. Also without adding alot of cheese and seasoning, it could be bland. But with a few changes, I would cook again!

I actually had a homemade crust left over from pies, and misread the recipe when I started it and didn't realize that the bisquick would create the crust, so I modified the recipe and left out the bisquick & oil, added 1 Tablespoon flour, 1/2 c milk, used 1/2 cup Parmesan (half in the mixture, and half on top of the tomatoes) & only used 1/2 teaspoon baking powder (I'm not sure what baking powder does!). It came out GREAT! I LOVE that the veggies are crisp! Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Just made it for dinner, served with a Greek salad, and it was delicious exactly as written.
The slice tomatoes keep it moist - no  need for a sauce, and the parmesan cheese makes the kitchen smell delightful.  I baked it for 45 minutes and then ran the top under the broiler for a few minutes to brown the cheese lightly.  Couldn't be better!

I made one and as it came out of oven we ate it. So I had to make another that we have been eating for breakfast for two days now. My second one I added fresh garlic and the parm cheese to the batter. This is a very good recipe. I will make this again.

I was a little disappointed with the texture, but that may be because I used the new HeartSmart Bisquick.  I would prefer either a more quiche-like texture, or texture more like a pizza crust, like one reviewer said.  Instead it was neither - a little too cake-like for me.

This was enjoyable.  I thought the flavor was very nice.  I especially loved the tomato on top.  I think next time I may add hamburger to it to make it more of a "main dish".  Great way to use up that squash!

This was OK (made as written). I did not like that it was very bred-like. I wanted it to be more eggy. Next time I will tweak it by adding an extra layer of tomatoes and cheese in the middle (that was my favorite part of this dish) I think this will be better if the baking mix was cut by half and a splash of milk/cream would not hurt. Also but some more seasoning in it (HOWEVER kids love it AS IS with no heavy seasoning). I like that I found this recipe it's something NEW and I love trying new things. Just tweak it to YOUR liking.

This was wonderful!!!  I did not have any "baking mix" but substituted some home-made self-rising flour (the recipe can be found on All Recipes) and added an additional tsp. of baking powder and about an 1/8 of a cup sugar; it turned out just great.  As many of the other reviewers have noted, playing with variations of cheese or even the addition of some herbs can make this a very versatile recipe.  My favorite variation:  the addition of some chopped fresh parsley (not quite a "mince" but more than a "rough chop") and mix it in with the batter.  Perfection!

WOW!  What a great dish!  Followed recipe exactly.  Only thing I'd change is cook maybe 5-10 mins longer.  Might add mushrooms next time.  So pretty my husband took a picture when it came out of the oven, and he even left 1/2 his chicken uneaten in order to have a large second helping.  I'm eating a slice for breakfast.  Prep only took about 10 minutes - Fast, Easy, Healthy and Delicious.  Will be a regular at our house.  thanks for the recipe!!!

I have to agree with some of the others.  This pie is tasteless.  It needs more flavors.  I could taste the bisquick and not much else.  Definitely won't make this one again.

It was okay, I had to bake it for 50 min. a little on the bland side.  I threw in some garlic powder too.  I baked it in a 8x8 square dish.

I enjoyed it, although after following some other peoples' advice (adding some seasoning, etc.), I think I would add cheese to the overall mixture, along with seasonings... or do something to make it a little less dry/more flavorful...

Very simple and fresh, I did toss the squash and onion with some basil before folding it into the batter. My teenage daughter sighed and said, 'I just love this stuff'! The baking time was right on, perfectly tender squash. I'll make this again for certain.

Made as written, very good. It was a big hit with my husband. I also made one cutting the amount of oil in half as some reviewers suggested, it was much drier and had  a more cake like texture, but still tasted really good. My husband preferred the less oil one, I preferred the more oil one, lol. This is going to be a recipe we use a lot, and I am looking forward to playing with the recipe for more variations. Thanks Suzanne S. for a great recipe!!!

This was pretty good. Mine turned out a little dry but could be because I had a little less parm cheese called for. It also was somewhat bland so I followed other recommendations by adding garlic and Italian seasoning. I also shredded the zucchini, squash, and onions for the kids. I passed this off as an egg pie to my kids so they asked for sausage. it actually was very complimentary to the dish, surprisingly. I'll def make this again but will add the spices again, more parm, and try adding bacon as another reviewer recommended.

A bit bland, but oh! so forgiving.  I made two while on the phone last night.  I only used 1/2 C baking mix in the 1st, but it came out fine.  For the 2nd, I forgot the baking soda until everything was in the pie pan.  I shook it over, stirred it in & bet it tastes just fine when I try it tonight.

Yum!  My whole family loved it!  Used broccoli and  yellow squash because I didn't have zucchini-also, didn't have onions so used 3 cloves of garlic crushed in with the eggs.  I did add a healthy amount of salt and pepper and a little bit of Italian seasoning too.  Great texture and taste, we all had 2 helpings.  Thanks!

This was great. I added fresh basil, upped the spices, added more cheese, and sprinkled bacon on top, which was an awesome addition! I don't think it needs to cook longer, unless you want to cook the life out of it. It was more bready than I was expecting.

Made this with homemade baking mix, used all zucchini (no summer squash), and left off the cheese while baking.  Our son has a dairy allergy, so we just added some raw cheddar on top of our slices after it was dished up.  The pie was hot enough to melt the cheese and it worked out well for the whole family.  It took longer than the recommended time to bake.  I think I had it in the oven for about 45-50 minutes.  I also added some paprika and a clove of garlic, minced.  It was a nice way to prepare zucchini.  We paired it with a salad and fresh baked bread for dinner.  Even our three year old son liked it.

OK, so I am a bad girl and I followed the recipe that was included in one of the comments (3 c shredded zuchinni, 1/3 c oil, 1/2 c cheddar, 1/4 cup parmesan, 1 cup baking mix, 1 onion, salt, pepper.  Mixed all together, topped with 1/3 cup shredded cheddar and 1 Tablespoon parmesan).  I am one of those cookers who like to play when I bake, so I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but OMG it was incredible.  I plan on making this again and again.  I will try it a little closer to the original posted, because the bones of this recipe are good and easy to manipulate.

This was super easy and it came out great.  I added spinach to it as well.  When you're mixing the ingredients it may look like there is not enough batter, but it bakes up fine.  I will definitely make this again.  Next time I plan to add feta to the batter too.

We were expecting it to be more like a quiche but had a biscuit texture.  I only put tomatoes on half of it as my daughter didn't want any and didn't use onions because we don't like them.  I also mixed some parmesan into the egg mixture.  I will try this again but with a regualr crust and some other seasonings.

I didn't have summer squash so I used 3 cups of zucchini instead and  the result was delicious. I like to purchase the   shaved Parmesan, so I sprinkled that on top of the tomato slices.

Great easy recipe. Healthier than most quiche recipes. I do add a little basil and oregano on top. Great thing to make for dinner then reheat for work lunches.

This was really good. I chopped the tomatoes and mixed them in with the other ingredients instead of slicing and putting on top. I also mixed the Parmesan in. Then sprinkled paprika on it. Next time I may mix a pinch of cayenne pepper into it just to give it a spicy flavor (only because I don't like bland flavors).

Superb! Thank you Suzanne! Not just for breakfast, Made it twice, I love the texture of this, its not a Quiche, much lighter I'd say Quiche like. I liked the original recipe for breakfast or early lunch. 2nd time making this I decreased the recipe to 4 servings,  I added just a sprinkle or less than an 1/8 t oregano, basil, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, nutmeg, added a sautéed  1/2 chopped onion in 1 Tbsp of butter until translucent, 1/4 C of cheddar cheese in the mix, decreased the oil by 1 Tbsp & added a chopped tomato with the pulp removed. I baked in a 8x5 square casserole dish about 45 min.

I had to make by scratch the baking mix about 1 cup, I need to add that by using the baking mix found here at site I didn't need to use the salt to season to taste. Next time I will use other veg's, spinach, mushrooms, cheese. Good for supper with a salad, its hard to quit eating this :D
 I'm thinking now I could add  some corned beef also with this & another veg. Thanks again

I made this today and my husband and I loved it. I left out the tomato and squash because I didn't have it on hand. I put a little bit of lite sour cream on top and used 3 year aged cheddar instead of parmesan. I also added some garlic powder.

I made this recipe but I added mushrooms and an extra tomato.  I also added some smoked gouda which gave it a smokey bacon favor without the meat. It was so good I am going to make it again this week.

i used this as a starting point.. seeing as how most ppl had complaints as this being bland or too bread-y i made the following changes/additions.. i used shredded mexican squash.. added green bell pepper and garlic.. sauteed them along with the onion.. used cheddar instead of parm and doubled it.. mixed it into the egg mixture instead of topping the pie.. added majoram and season salt.. halved the baking mix and baking powder.. think i could have decreased the oil and wish i would have thought about adding some cayenne.. maybe next time.. thank you for the inspiration

I used this basic recipe to use up broccoli I had on hand... So my review is based on a broccoli cheese version of this recipe. It was super easy and delicious. I think this basic recipe could be used to create any variation you would normally see in a quiche for a lot less effort and good results. It was not as rich as a quiche, but looked beautiful and tasted great in a snap. I plan to try a spinach-feta-sausage version next. Great general recipe-- thanks very much.

Yum!  Light and healthy but full of flavor.  Perfect way to use up fresh garden veggies.  I grated the zucchini and squash for the sake of my picky kids. Putting it on the favorites list.

This smells SO good when it is cooking!  I didn't alter the recipe much, the only change I made was that I didn't use a crust.  It doesn't need it, it's good without it so why add the extra calories, I say!  So tasty.. I will use this base recipe and make this many more times with some changes and see what I can come up with :)

I took a reviewer's advice and grated the zucchini and squash.  Also I sprinkled italian seasoning on top.

I love this easy little recipe! I've made it so many times for breakfast, brunch, lunch or even a light dinner. I've made different variations depending on what I have on hand. I've made it with fresh or frozen veggies (zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, baby carrots, spinach... ) some of the times I've added ham, green onions, fresh herbs like basil and shredded mozzarella on top. I've also made it with a few teaspoons of spaghetti or pizza sauce and every time it turns out delicious! 
I always add the Parmesan to the mix instead of on top and I make it with the "Biscuit Baking Mix" I found on this site. I also bake it in a square 8 in dish and it turns out great!

This was fantastice!  I made per recipe and hubby and I ate half for dinner - lots of yums from him.  Just finished a piece for my lunch and froze the last big slice to see how it will taste after it's been frozen.  Nice recipe!

Delicious!! Sliced veggies very thin to help cook thoroughly, added almost 1/2 cup of finely diced onion just because i love onion. I was looking for something light as i hate heavy foods in the summer/heat and this was a perfect meal, thank for the recipe!

I have never made anything like this so I didn't know what to expect. I LOVED it. My husband thought it was good...he ate it with some ranch to add a little flavor I guess. I recommend more tomatoes, my husband isn't a fan of tomatoes so I only put tomatoes on half. And I put in way more cheese than it asked for! very yummy. I think it was even a little better the next day as left overs.

This is always a hit even among those who do not like eggs. I do add some extra spices they differ depending on the day. Simple, quick and there is never any leftovers.

Sooooooo good!  My 5 yr old and 2 yr old ate it, too!  (she said, completely stunned)  I made some changes: I used all yellow squash, and grated it.  (To hide it...)  I didn't have an onion, so I used onion powder.  I also nixed the tomato, and mixed spinach into 2/3 of it once I poured it in the pan for the grown-ups.  I put cooked ground bacon-sausage on top, then sprinkled with the parm.  I used a glass 8 1/2 x 11, same cook time.  Thanks!  We all LOVED it!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe pretty much to a T but I added 2 oz of Gruyere cheese (which I shredded) and 5 pieces of Turkey Bacon to the batter (crumbled).  I did not add onions, rather I added some onion powder.  Quick side note, I used the "Heart Smart" version of the Bisquick.  It came out great & will definitely make it again!!!

11-12~Since the first review I made this again for a work potluck and this is the ONLY thing that was totally gobbled up in the end.~This has endless possiblities...you could add almost anything. I went with the cheese cubes idea and topped with avocado...super super good

I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it was very good.  The tomatoes make it in my opinion - don't leave them out!  I will absolutely make this again.
