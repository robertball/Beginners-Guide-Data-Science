FANTASTIC!  I read the other reviews and made the following changes based on my families preferences and reviews.  First I simmered a ham bone with ham (for the recipe), carrots and onion in 12 c. water for 2 hours.  I removed bone and veggies and discarded.  I then took out ham and chopped.  I used exactly 6 cups of this broth to start this soup instead of water.  I also chopped up the 2 onions very small and carmelized in olive oil before adding to the broth and ham.  The rest I left intact except for substituting 1c. half & half for the 1 c. milk. I read where some reviwers didnt add the flour 'paste' and also left out the milk...I think if you don't use the flour 'paste' you wouldn't need the milk?  The 6 c. broth (or water) is perfect.  I used the full amount of cheese (velveeta) as this really is a HUGE pot of soup and I felt half wouldn't do the flavor justice. It was great!!!!

LOVE this soup!!  I had an extra ham bone (well my mother-in-law gave it to me) so I simmered it for a few hours w/ 6 c. of water, 2 carrots, 2 celery stalks (w/ leaves), and an onion (discarding the veges before adding the other ingredients).  Doing this made an excellent broth, enhancing the flavor of the soup even more.  I skimmed out most of the onion before adding the cheese because there was WAAAAYY to much.  Next time I will add celery & carrots as well & maybe mash up a few more potatoes to thicken it some.  Thanks Donna, this is a great tasting soup!

This is very good, basically a potato soup. By cooking the ham and potatoes together, you will get a heartier tasting potato ,, great idea.
Bacon makes it great too! I toasted bread cubes seasoned with parmesean cheese in the oven for a great and tasty topper for your soup.

Very, very good!  I added a few cloves of fresh garlic, as well as some grated Swiss cheese.  Since I didn't have Velveeta cheese, I used about 8 ounces of fat-free cream cheese.  This made for a very tasty, creamy, and lower-fat soup.  I wil definitely make this one again!

I made this for a holiday party and both kids and adults loved it. I changed a few items because of what I had onhand. First I browned 1 1/2 small onions chopped in the big soup pot. 1 3/4 packages of instant mashed potatoes (10 servings) constituted with 3 cups of low-sodium chicken broth took the place of 7 potatoes and the smashing. I boiled the other 5 potatoes, ham, and onions in enough broth to cover. It seemed a little too thick, so I added enough broth to make it soup-like. Then to get in some veggies, I threw in 1 cup of frozen mixed at the end. At the party, I served the soup from a crock pot on low. Don't recommend that because the soup burns on the side - not pretty. Definitely will make this again - mmm, mmm!

Hubby actually said "to die for" and my 6-year old also gave the thumbs up.  A couple of changes: cut recipe in half, added a stick of celery and a cube of veggie boullion, used 1/2 pound of velveeta instead of a pound, and forgot to add the milk.  It was still fantastic, thanks!

Loved it! My husband who is always a critic, liked it a lot! My kids liked it as well. My changes were that I sauteed the onions with some chopped baby carrots and one chopped stick of celery in olive oil and then I added sour cream instead of milk. YUMMY and very Filling. Makes a lot of soup. If you have a small family I reccomend cutting the recipe down by half.

This soup was delicious! After having left ovr ham in a variety of different ways, it was nice to see a recipe for a ham soup that didn't have beans in it! I made this soup and we as a family has just loved it. It was very good. I will make it again.

YUM! I used 8 potatos (we love our taters), 1/2 lb of Velveeta, 6 cups of water, and 1/2 lb of ham. I didn't make the flour paste. Once I mashed about half of the potato mixture it became thick enough for my taste. I also added oregano for color and taste. It certainly was YUM! though not much different from any other potato soup I've made.

Here is what I did and it came out AWESOME! I put 6 cups water in a stock pot then added 3 tbsp onion powder, 1 tsp. dried parsley, 1/8 tsp black pepper, 2 cups fully cooked chopped ham, 6 cubed medium potatoes. I cooked it about 20 minutes or until almost all the water evaporated and most of the potatoes were mushy. I then stirred in 1/2 cup of cream and a 1/2 cup of whole milk with 1 1/2 pounds of Velveeta cheese until melted. I made sure it was heated through and served with Double Quick Dinner Rolls from this site!! YUM!

Made Italian bread bowls from this site to put the soup in, and it was a BIG hit!  Loved that there weren't many ingredients and easy and cheap to make, yet tasted so good!  Picky husband, two-year-old AND three-year-old approved.  Stuck with the recipe (except for adding salt) and it was perfect.

This is the best! I didn't really like the ham in it, because the ham lost a lot of flavor. I will have to try a better ham or just more veggies next time. It is soooo good. I didn't need the milk.

I made this soup to help me make use of some leftover Christmas ham.  It is super easy to make and hands down the best potato soup I have ever tasted.  Thanks for this easy recipes my only changes were adding carrots and only putting one onion because the first was sooo strong and it turned out perfect.  Yum

Ive made this a couple times now, and it is delicious. I left the onions out and used onion powder instead. I also added a little garlic powder and parsley. My husband loves this soup and likes to bring the leftovers to work for lunch.

This is the first time I have written a review on this site, but I just had to for this recipe. I followed it exactly, except  I forgot to add the milk. It turned out perfect. I will be using this recipe from now on and will omit the milk every time. My husband and his co-worker, who was here, loved it. Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was a fantastic soup! I have made it several times and enjoyed it each time. I added salt which was yummy, but is fine without and I substituted cream for the milk. Really good on a cold day!

I used red potatoes for this recipe and left the skin on. I think it added a burst of color to an otherwise bland colored dish. It was a delicious recipe though. I did add some chicken bouillon to my potatoes as they were cooking. I also used only 1 lb of velveeta. I think 2 would have been overpowering. I have a large family and 4 out of 7 loved it.

I thought this was a great potato soup.  I did add some more spices.  The only thing I didn't like was adding the milk at the end.  It seemed to separate something in the soup, but it still tasted great.

This soup was quick, easy, and delicious. I halved the recipe because I didn't want 16 servings. Also, I didn't feel like peeling potatoes, so I bought a bag of O'Brien potatoes at the store. Just covered in water with the ham, boiled to heat through, and followed the rest of the recipe. It was so easy, and the peppers in the potatoes added a bit of color. Highly recommend!

I've made this two times now, once the full version the second I cut the recipe in half. Both times it just didn't turn out great. I've tried yukon gold's and russet, water and stock, both variations turned out the same. Not as cheesy as it should be and thin. Both times I had to use a corn starch slurry to thicken it up. I'm just not convinced that using the ratio of "cover with water" is good enough. I don't think I'll try this recipe again, it's time for me to move onto a new one.

This was great. Quick and simple. I like Bacon in my potato soup so I cooked 1Ib cooked bacon in the pot, drain on paper towels than crumbled them andput them back in the pot along with half of the drippings and followed the recipes as stated (well I halfed the reciped). Turned out great my husband loved it and this is a keeper for us!

Very easy and delicious.  I used ham stock I made (from a leftover ham bone - boiled w/celery & onion for 2 hrs) in place of the water and chicken bouillion.  I also mashed the potatoes once cooked, but that was for personal taste as I don't like cubed potatoes in my soup.  Will definitely make again!

I have made this several times and it is very tasty and so easy.  Works as a great base for any other soup.  I've had variations with asparagus, crab, broccoli, I bet anything that tastes good with cheese would be great in this soup.

so good! I used chicken stock and water to cook the potatoes. Makes a huge amount, great for large group or freezing for a 2nd meal.

This was awesome! The only thing I changed was instead of water I simmered a ham bone, 1 cup of carrots and 3 celery stalks for about 2 hours. Then I discarded all the veggies and used the broth for the soup. The whole family loved it!

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used sharp cheddar instead of Velveeta and added a bit of broccoli.  I took one bite and a huge pot of soup went down the drain...absolutely disgusting.  It was so bad I'm not even sure I'd try it a second time with Velveeta, since I've already wasted so much time, food, and money.

I absolutely love this recipe and encourage people to try it! My mom made this recipe when i was a child. She passed away a few years ago and i never got her recipe for it so i decided to see if it could possibly be on here and to my surprise it was! although i believe she left out the onions and used packaged cubed ham instead. either way its great and very yummy during the winter.

This recipe was just "ok"... I used heavy cream in place of the milk and added chicken broth because I found my soup was too thick. I also used sharp cheddar in place of the Velveeta and a shallot in place of the onion. After all the changes it was pretty good.... but still tasted like it was missing something.

This is a great recipe! Very easy and fast to make and tastes wonderful. The only thing I did differently is I added some chopped celery while it was cooking and I also used baby red potatos and did not skin. I will definitely be making this over and over again!

Yumm! Really good. I made some changes though. Firstly, I had a ham bone, so I boiled the ham bone with water and one onion. I boiled it for 1 1/2 hours, discarded the ham bone and then added all the other ingredients. I did use real cheese, not processed cheese, just because I don't care for the taste of processed cheese. Then I added some spices, and it tasted delicious! I made it a little too salty, but that it totally my fault.. Thanks for the recipe! It was very good and the whole family loved it!

GReat soup! I made a few changes, instead of water I used chicken broth. I also browned the ham in the pot before adding the other ingrediants. To give it a little extra kick I added some dry ranch powder. So yummy!!

Great recipe!  I covered the potatoes with chicken broth, cut up the onion and let it simmer.  Save yourself some steps, no need to sautee the onion first, or even strain the onions out.  They will be well blended by the time the soup is done.  I did not use flour, if you let it simmer enough, it will thicken up nicely.  I mashed up the potatoes right in the pot, so I had a nice mix of mashed/cubed potatoes.  I almost skipped the milk, like some suggest-but after tasting it before/after it really needs the milk to get the right flavor/consistency!  I cut back on the cheese to about 3/4...this recipe was wonderful and even my picky 10 year old loved it.  I almost skipped on adding the velveeta-I didn't want a cheesy soup-but I swear this is the "secret" ingredient in potato soup.  Very delicious!!

Oh my goodness!  This is the very best potato soup I have ever had in my life!  I cut the recipe in half and it still made a lot, but this will be great for lefovers or for our lunches.  Very good flavor and nice and thick, but not too thick.  Perfect!  I did not change a thing!

This soup was really good but it was very bland so it needed a ton of salt & pepper. After a dash of garlic powder to give it a little more flavor it turned out ok. I made it in combination with the Double Quick Dinner Rolls recipe from this site & my family enjoyed it.

I hate the way the cheese sticks to your spoon and inside your mouth and the pot was EXTREMLY hard to clean! Though it did taste excellent besides that.

This is a souper easy meal. It was so good on a below 0 night.  I added frozen peas for color and used white pepper to hide the black specks. Otherwise I just used half of what was called for and it was perfect for a family of four! Thank you!

Husband really enjoyed it.  "Too many potatoes" was his comment.  We might make it again, depends on how much ham we have left over after the next holiday meal.  I followed the comments from other readers and skipped the "flour and milk" directions.  Right amount of cheese.  Also, I used chicken broth instead of water.  I think this makes a huge difference in flavor.

I didn't have Velvetta so I used shredded cheddar and instead of flour I used a package of country gravy. It was so cheesy and delicious!

Had some leftover ham and needed to do something with it besides just more leftovers.  This recipe was a HUGE hit at my house--my 12 year old actually looks in the supermarket flyer to see when ham is on sale!  I increase the recipe a bit so we have enough for leftovers and lunches--this is the best with warm rolls on a cold night.  YUM!

I made the following changes: used broth instead of water for extra flavor, added a bit of celery, didn't use as much onion, added about half a bag of baby carrots cut up, and a handful of fresh green beans cut up. I think next time I should cook the carrots and green beans a bit before adding the potatoes since they didn't cook quite as fast. But all in all, this came out VERY good. Not too runny, not too thick. Even my picky boyfriend had 2 bowls. Thanks for the amazing recipe!

I cut the recipe to 4 servings.  Had a ham shank bone left from Easter so I simmerd it in Chicken broth for an hour - then added the potatoes and onion and a couple stalks of celery. The soup very tasty.  Served it with muffins and a salad.

Loved this recipe!  Instead of water, I used chicken broth to cook the potatoes,celery,carrots etc in.  I had all these things in the frig as left overs, so it was perfect to make an all new meal out of the ingredients! A wonderful surprize to clean out the frig and have an excellent tasting soup to come out of it, what could be better??? Thank You So Much

I scaled this recipe up to 48 servings for our lenten soup supper and it filled an 18 qt roaster to the brim.  Got great reviews! We added the Velveeta when the soup was very hot and I think it melted too quickly.  Would recommend turning the roaster down some before adding the cheese, just before serving.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This soup turned out fantastic!  I am new to making soups, but this was very easy and the flavor was wonderful.  I added sliced carrots and a bag of frozen corn to this recipe, and put everything in the slow cooker for several hours.  Served this to my family and some friends after a day of skiing, and everyone asked for seconds.

I definitly love this recipe. I love the milk in it. I did alter it a bit. I used 1 onion, a stalk of celery and one chopped carrot. I also used salt and pepper and basil and some shredded cheddar cheese. Very delicious. :) will make again before winter is over.

Eleven grams of fat is a LOT less than many of the recipes AR calls 'healthy'.  And look at the detailed nutrition...very good.  The most unhealthy thing about this recipe is the sodium.

This is great comfort food!  I rarely buy Velveeta so used grated sharp cheddar instead.  Added 2 smashed garlic cloves and some parsley.  Served with the Sky High Yorkshire Pudding recipe from here.  YUM!

I started with stewing a ham bone with carrots, onions and celery.  I used the broth to cook the potatoes and followed the recipe after that.  I served it with whole grain dinner rolls.  My whole family loved this soup!  The leftovers did not last long!

This was very easy to make. I halved the recipe and it still made enough for an army. I added a large handful of sharp cheddar cheese and it tasted much better and next time I would use bacon instead of ham. It had my 20 month old asking for "more youp" for days!

This came out very good. I used Sierra Gold potatoes, only half of the Velveeta (by the way- I was very leary of ruining my soup with velveeta - we cant stand it! But, it did melt nice and provide a subtle flavor with no oily separation). I then planned to add 2 cups of cheddar but decided it was plenty cheesy for our taste. I started soup in the morning, pureed the onion and potatoes after cooking with a hand blender, then added our leftover ham with bone from Easter and let it simmer all day. Added the cheese and milk about an hour before serving. Came out good! Would make again.

Wonderful.. We had cooked a smoked pork shank, and reserved the liquid, removing the fat when it separated.. used that liquid and chicken stock to cover the ham and veg..I also sweated off the onions before adding the ham and potato, to sweeten their flavor. We loved this and will do it again. Also, the leftovers seem to freeze well for a short period of time.

I read the reviews before I started. I recommend that everyone do that. I used one can chicken broth and 1 can water to cook the veg.  I made the recipe for 6. Added less onions than it asked the recipe asked for, I also added about 1/4 cup thinly sliced celery and 1/4 cup thinly sliced carrots. It turned out great and I will be keeping the recipe in my collection for a long time. I appreciate Donna for the recipe and everyone who reviewed the recipe before me.

Very easy to make, takes a while for prep but very worth it in the end. Recommend using 1 onion unless you love onion. It can overpower the overall taste.

My husband had a favorite potato soup that he liked me to make but once I tried this on him he says the search for the best is over!  He LOVED it!  I made it exactly as called for and it's great!

Very good.  I started to make this thinking I would use Cheddar cheese, but when it came time to add it, I didn't have enough. The only thing I had was Mozzarella.(I wasn't sure if that would work out) I tried it anyway and it ws very good.  My cheese did not melt very well though so it was a good thing it was only for my family.  Next time I make this I will do according to the recipe and use Velveeta.

This was very easy to make and delicious! I made a few tweaks though - I substituted onion salt for the onions, and added 1 can of creamed corn at the very end.

This soup was good. I wish the water measurements were more precise however. The soup was a little thin but overall very tasty. I had to add some salt otherwise it was a little bland.
Husband liked it and it was something new to try.

This soup was awesome.  My 11 year old son had 3 bowls all at one meal.  I cut the recipe in half to get 6 servings.  The only thing I did different was use half of a small onion and I used 2 tablespoons of flour and 2 tablespoons of liquid.  I will be making this many more times.  Thanks for a great recipe the whole family enjoyed.

We had a local resturant close and they served this soup.  I've been looking for it since and now I can make it.  My whole family loves it and whenever I have leftover ham I make it.  Very easy too.

Good soup but made some changes along the way. Without the changes, I would have rated this lower. Added a can of Campbell's chicken broth (10 ounces); also celery seed, heavy cream instead of milk and more of it; blend of russet as well as Yukon gold potatoes, seasoning salt, more black pepper etc. This was better the second day. Really comforting and relatively easy to make.

This is the best potatoe soup I have ever had! It is so rich and creamy. I used a box of American deluxe cheese (I found it next to the velveeta) and a 1/2 lbs of mild cheddar. I like velveeta, but I prefer other cheese personally. This will be a family favorite.

Awesome soup!  I added seasonings, mashed 2 cups of potatoes instead of just 1 cup, and used only 1 pound of cheese.  I made the Cheddar Bay Biscuits from this website and it was a nice meal.

I love this recipe. Ive made it twice and the second time didnt watch it close enough and over cooked the potatoes. Which is'nt necessarily a bad thing, because it saved me a step, just drain the water add the cheese, mix and youre done. It just changes the consistency of the soup to a thicker pureed soup. And I always sautee the onions first,instead of boiling them, I just think you get a better flavor that way. Awesome recipe, thanks Donna!

Great great soup!  Beware though - this makes a huge amount of soup!!  The only thing I changed about this recipe is that I didn't add the milk at the end.  I think I may have had too much water in the pot to start with and adding the milk at the end would've made it too runny.  I served this soup with fresh garlic croutons, bacon pieces and a few chives sprinkled on top and it was a huge hit!!  It just doesn't seem right that something so easy can taste so good!

Everything you want in a soup, taste good, takes only a few ingredients, and is easy to make.
I used skim milk and cut the amount of cheese down to 1/2 lb.

This recipe is perfect! I've been searching for the perfect potato soup recipe and this one is so simple and yet so delicious, I'll be making it often. I only used one onion instead of two because my family doesn't care much for onions and I added a clove of minced garlic. Yummy!!

I love this recipe and have shared it with many friends.  Even my picky 9 year-old likes it.  Great for left-over ham.  Have made it with half Velveeta and half cheddar.  It's hard to mess up!

This was a very delectable entree. I substituted chicken breast for the ham, New York sharp cheddar for the velveeta, and a small variety of fresh vegetables for the potatoes. Quite yummy if you ask me, and the children just adored it as well!

This is one of my favorite soups not only because it tastes great but because it's simple to make.  The only change I make is using chicken broth instead of water.  I have made it without ham when I don't have it on hand, but I add a packet of Goya Ham Flavored Concentrate to the broth as the potatoes cook to give it some of the ham flavor.  I love it both with and without the chopped ham.  Next time I will add some crumbled bacon on top before it's served.  This is so good served with crusty bread or rolls...you can dip it right into the soup.

Oh so yummy.  The taste is heaven!  I didn't need to use any flour, but did need to reduce the Valveeta by 1/4.  Enjoy....it's DANG good.

I sliced the peeled potatoes in the food processor to save time and the consistency was very good. Thanks Donna, I'll make this again.

I am not a fan of soup due to living in SE Texas where it barely ever gets below 60 degrees and we have so much humidity. But yesterday was a very cool day and I made this soup...and believe me, I will defintely be making it again! I loved it and so did the entire family! The only thing I did different is added some broccoli to it! Thanks so much for sharing this one!

My husband and I enjoyed this for three nights - and that was after taking other people's recommendation to cut the recipe in half.  I served it in bread bowls and used 3/4 of the Velveeta and one 8 oz pkg of cream cheese.  With the use of leftover Thanksgiving honey-baked ham this was an awesome recipe.  Thanks so much!

Very easy and incredibly good!  I also halved the recipe. . . used 1/2 cup half & half, 1 tbsp cornstarch and didn't mash the potatoes.  It was very creamy and got rave reviews from my friends!  A definite keeper.

This was a great recipe!  My mother says all the chefs she watches on TV saute' celery and onion before they add water to their soups, so I did the same.  I also added a couple chicken boullion cubes, and since I only had about 3/4 lb. of Velveeta, added some cheddar cheese along with it.  My daughter who is a soup fantatic loved it!

This was delicious! However, I was diligent about adding additional vegetables (diced & sautéed carrots, celery, corn & onions) & seasoning each layer of flavor. The prep & long, slow cooking (took about four hours!) paid off. I used diced cheddar instead of Velveeta (2 pounds is a lot of cheese product?).  Made so much we shared with neighbors!

Excellent flavor and texture.  I used chicken stock in lieu of water and added bacon and celery as well as Velveeta Sharp to boost the cheese taste. If you like a cheese soup, you'll like this recipe.

I make this recipe but I add chicken boullian. Would love to know a more specific serving size instead of 1/16.... I guess I should just ladle it out into 16 servings?... I think not. I also only use one onion because two sounds like a bit much.. but it's a staple and a favorite at our house.

I've made this recipe twice & it turned out great both times.  The first time I added broccoli like several others suggested.  The second time I substituted chicken broth for the water, deleted the ham, substituted half the Velveeta for cheddar & added broccoli.  It was delicious!

I made this for my parents and they loved it. My mom said it was the best potato soup she has ever had, even better than her favorite steakhouse. I substituted bacon for the ham because I had that already.

The best potato/broccoli,  cheese soup I ever had.  First I cut the ham off of an old ham bone that I had and then made a broth using  the  ham bone, carrots, celery, onions, and peppercorn covered everything with water and simmered for two hours .  Discarded all but the broth.  followed the instructions exactly except I added some  broccoli  too.  This made an amazing soup.

I adjusted the recipe for 4 people since the original was for 16 and that is to much for two  people. 
I will definately make this again. I am thinking some crumbly bacon would be a nice addition . Yum!

Omg this is so good!!!  The only things I did differently is when the potatoes, ham and onions were in the pot I added a ham bone to boil with it. I also added low sodium organic chicken stocks long with the water, and 1 stick of butter. This is an AMAZINGLY SIMPLE RECIPE!!! Thank you, it turned out perfect

We really liked this recipe. I did exactly as written, except I used chicken broth instead of the water. It came out very smooth and creamy, with a lot of flavor. I used Honeybaked Ham, and even though I originally considered using the bone to make the broth, I found this plenty flavorful without the added time and fuss.

This is literally the BEST ham, cheese, potato soup I have ever made.  So easy.  I cut it in half, and it was plenty with leftovers for my family of 7.  Who would even have a pot large enough! I filled my dutch oven.  It is so good.

I had a small amount of broccoli which I added.  Also had 4 oz of cream cheese. I had saved celery leaves for soup and added those. I sautéed the onion in oil and added flour to the cooked onions. Solved the problem of smashing potatoes. It is on the stove simmering.  It turned out fabulous.

AWESOME! I took the advice of some reviewers and used what I had on hand. But the start came from this recipe. I diced about two cups of red onions - it was all I had. I cooked two slices of bacon in a large pot, removed it, and added a large chopped onion and two chopped garlic cloves. When that was soft, I added the chopped bacon, a little chopped ham, salt and pepper. I simmered that for about 20 minutes in about 4 cups of chicken broth.  Then I added the potatoes and more  ham. I followed the directions for making the paste and stirred it in. I didn't have processed cheese, so I added shredded cheddar, some cheddar slices and a little shredded Monterey Jack. Melted it and added about a half cup of cream.  Of my, this is definitely company food!

this turned out great. followed directions almost exactly. the only thing that changed is my fiancé got regular cheese instead of processed cheese because he didn't see any of the one. also because processed cheese is a bit more creamy then regular cheese I used heavy cream instead of milk and it turned out great. full of flavor. with just some onion powder and 2 cloves of garlic chopped up fine like. will be making this again!

I also used my ham bone and about 1 1/2 lbs of cubed ham. Leftovers from Christmas dinner. I made the stock the night before with water (enough to cover ham bone) small sweet soup onions, carrot greens, pepper and Sazon Goya without Annatto . This I let simmer for about 2 hours. I then added 6 cubed  potatoes,  cut carrots, and let it simmer for about another 1 1/2 hours. I then removed them and let them cool in fridge. Next day, I boiled 3 large potatoes in the stock, removed the potatoes and all but 10 cups of stock (saving remaining stock for freezing an future use). I mashed the potatoes  to make the paste with the flour and two cups of the stock. At this point I turned down to low and added the paste and vegetables from the night before, along with a can of sweet corn, drained. Then comes the 2 lbs of velveeta cubed and the cup of milk. Stir continually on low, so the cheese doesn't burn on bottom of pot, until cheese is melted and soup is smooth. It turned out fantastic. This may be my new favorite soup.

I followed the recipe except instead of water I used chicken broth. I also cooked my onion in olive oil and a spoonful of minced garlic before adding to the potatoes. I also used a can of cheddar cheese soup along with a cup of shredded Velveeta cheese. Used some seasoned salt instead of plain salt and a little garlic powder. I also added some bacon I had leftover from breakfast as well as the ham (from Thanksgiving). It is a good base recipe for the soup but unless you like it bland I suggest adding your special touch ;)

I love this soup! Its so easy to make; I cook up some chopped bacon and add it with some of its juices to the mix as well - Typically I do all the prep work at home and take with us camping during the fall or spring months... Warms your insides after a chilly afternoon of riding :)

Made it gluten and additive free*** What I made I really enjoyed. However I made some major differences. I used sweet potato instead of regular, mild cheddar natural cheese, coconut floor instead of wheat flour, and natural uncured ham. This way it was gluten free and additive free! Oh also added 3 cloves of garlic.

I made this recipe today and it was GREAT! I tweaked it a bit by doing the following: I had 3 ham steaks I needed to use and I put them in a baking pan, layered with 5 slices of bacon and then cut up two onions and 2 stalks of celery. Added about 1/2 cup of water, covered tightly with foil and baked at 275* for about an hour. When it was done I put that oven juice in a stock pot with 32oz of chicken broth,1 cup of milk, a tsp of minced garlic with 8 of the potatoes and a 1/2 cup of bacon bits and boiled that while I cut cup the 3 hams steaks and slices of bacon. when the potatoes were in the stock pot were almost done I added the ham and bacon from the oven and the velveeta.  With the other 4 potatoes I sliced them very thin, and boiled separately, poured the water off  added the flour, a bit of juice from stock pot and mashed together. then added it to the rest of the stock pot mixture.  This was great!!!!I bought cream cheese, but forgot to use it and we tasted before I added the velveeta and it was good that way too. I added season salt, pepper and accent to taste.

I followed others advise and made my own soup stock by boiling a ham bone with carrots onion and celery using the inside of the stalk as well (leaves) After simmering for about 3hrs I strained and discarded the veggies.  I also cooked potatoes separately.  I  added some concentrated chicken flavor to the mix. It was very good!  Will definitely make this again

Fabulous! The only thing I changed was I used chicken broth instead of water. Thanks for sharing! Even my picky eater loved it!

I have made this recipe 3 or 4 times now, each time adding something different.  We love ham and so its loaded with it! I cook the potatoes in chicken stock, use half & half instead of milk, add bacon (everything's better with bacon!), for a little different texture I use instant mashed potatoes to thicken, and last time I added some red pepper flakes just to give it a little kick.  It was just what it needed according to my hubby!  Making it again today just because we like having the quick leftovers!

I loved this simple and fast soup. I did the flour paste but instead of milk I added 1 8oz cream cheese and 1/4 cup sour cream, plus a bit of garlic and salt. So amazing for a cold snowy day in Colorado!

I made it with no changes.  Good but a bit too cheesy.  I would recommend using half the cheese called out.

Really good!!! My Man said that I could make it any time. (Of course it is a man's meal - meat, potatoes, and cheese :) I added some additional seasonings of parsley, garlic, and a 1/8 tsp. of celery seed.

I make this all the time, usually with enough leftover that my boyfriend takes it to work and all of his employees love it just as much as we do! I also make a few adjustments, first by boiling a ham bone with fresh garlic for about 2 hours. Then I discard the ham bone and use the water and garlic for the soup. I don't use as much Velveeta and in place of it use shredded mozzarella. Also, I add baby butter beans, garlic powder, and a tiny bit of parsley.

This soup was scrumptious! The only thing I changed was using 2 cups chicken broth in place of some of the water. Tasted like cheesy au gratin potatoes with ham in soup form. Super duper delicious, will definitely be making again!

New comfort dish! Halved the recipe. Used what was available, 2 cans "Rico's Cheddar Cheese", ham steak diced, half an onion and 1/3 cup potato flakes to thicken. Will be adding in broccoli to left-overs for tonight.
