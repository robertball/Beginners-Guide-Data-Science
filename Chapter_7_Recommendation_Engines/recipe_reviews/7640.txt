This is SO YUMMY and does taste like a gob (whoopie pie).  I did not use the frosting.  I used a much easier, fool proof recipe.  Beat 3 cups powdered sugar with 1/3 cup softened butter.  Add 1 teaspoon vanilla and gradually beat in 1-2 tablespoons of milk until frosting is spreadable.  MMMMM!

My husband can't stop raving about this cake.  However, I didn't use the icing it suggested.  I used a cream cheese icing instead... just because I had it leftover from another cake. We're originally from PA and this reminded us of home.

I have to say, I have never had a whoopie pie or a "gob," but this cake tastes exactly like those little hostess chocolate cupcakes with the cream filling I remember eating as a kid. My husband, who is allergic to eggs and can't have most cakes, absolutely loved it. For me it was very easy to make with ingredients I always have on hand. It tasted great with caramel frosting. Next time I might try to inject some cream into it and frost it with chocolate frosting... maybe I'll even try cupcakes. There was no question in my husband's mind that this recipe gets 5 stars.

I tried this recipe because I wanted to make a gob cake, but didn't have a chocolate cake mix on hand and had no time to run to the store.  I was a little skeptical as to how it would compare to my usual recipe that contains milk, eggs, and instant pudding, but it turned out great and everyone loved it!  I baked it in two round pans lined with parchment for easier removal of the cake, and used my own recipe for the filling, which is very light and fluffy.       Imitation Whipped Cream Filling:    Combine 5 T. flour and 1 c. milk, and cook until thick.  When cool, add 1 c. sugar, 1/2 c. softened butter and 1/2 c. shortening.  Beat at high speed for several minutes until smooth and fluffy.

I'm not sure that I'm entitled to rate this recipe because of the extensive changes that I made.  I was originally going for a whoopie pie recipe which led me to gob cakes (a name apparently limited to PA borders since I'm in MD and have never heard it called by that name).  This recipe sounded the best of the gob cake/whoopie pie selection.  One thing I didn't take into account was that this was a "cake" so after mixing it, it was way too runny to be used for individual whoopie pies.  I added an additional 1 - 1 1/2 cups of flour (I didn't measure, I just kept adding until the consistency was right).  For the icing, I used a previous reviewers recipe of 3c powdered sugar, 1/3c butter, 1t vanilla, and 1-2T milk just because the butter and shortening in icing sounded too greasy for me.  Overall, the whoopie/gob pies were very good and snack time after school for my 3 children was silent (they were too busy devouring the pies to talk).

I love Gobs from PA and this recipe tasted just like them.  I have made the cake twice and it is very moist.  The second time I made it, I added a little peanut butter to the icing and it was delicious!

I used two round pans for this recipe, and put the icing between the layers.  The cocoa could definitely be tasted in the recipe (a bit bitter), but the cake is extremely moist.  I used my own gob icing recipe and this really did taste like a large gob.  Good recipe.

The cake portion of this was incredibly moist and wonderful and tasted just like the cake portion of a gob. The icing, however, was a bit of a mess. While beating it for the 10 minutes, it became a kind of runny mess - maybe it was the shortening?  I finally added some confectioners sugar, which made it a little better.  It still tasted good, but looked strange.  I'll make again with a different icing.

This cake is delicious. I have made it 4 times now and everytime it turns out wonderfully. Everytime I take a bite I am reminded of whoopies pies from Pennsylvania. It is even better with peanut butter frosting.

I didn't care for this recipe, my frosting turned out a bit on the runny side and the cake a bit hard. Chances are i won't make this again.

I was nervous-this was such an odd blend of ingredients and no eggs, I was encouraged to try it from other reviews. It worked beautifully. I followed others advice and did not use the icing recipe, I chose the mocha icing recipe from this site. WOW, really a knock out dessert.

The cake recipe is great because the ingredients are often on hand in the house. The icing recipe was really bad and tasted like shortening. I just made a fluffy white icing instead. Grease/flour the pan even though it says not to. I didn't and it stuck to the pan.

I thought this cake turned out great, It was super moist and tasted awesome, just like a GOB, But the icing tasted like shortning, I think it could've used more sugar, Or confectionate sugar for a sweeter taste. I will make this cake for my family reunion, but I will use a different icing,I also emptied the whole cake in a pan and then cut threw the middle, putting the icing in the middle and nothing on the top so that it had a more Gob effect. But it is still being eaten, So the icing isn't too bad.

I made this cake for work today and everyone was shocked at how bad it tasted. I cook for work all the time and win awards on occasion. I was in a hurry last night and thought I'd try this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand. My coworkers compared it to meatloaf with icing. I don't know what a gob is, but my guess is that I don't like them.

This is the best egg-free cake recipe I have found yet! My son is severly allergic to eggs and peanuts and I have had some horrible experiences with egg-free recipes. I actually made cupcakes with this recipe and they turned out SO YUMMY!!! They are a great texture and perfect for decorating!

Very good! I had no idea what I was making before beginning this recipe and never had even heard of Gob cake before...But, just had a craving for cake and happend to have all the right ingredients. I can't believe how soft this turned out. I actually made them into cupcakes...they really melt in your mouth even 3 days later. Will likely make again! If I had anything I would change, is I would add chocolate chips into the mixture to give it a stronger chocolate taste.

For the life of me I can't figure why some folks did not like this recipe - it truly was Excellent! Moist and sweet, everything you'd want in a rich chocolate cake...It's even better the next day! Three very simple changes I made: #1)added 1/2 cup of light brown sugar...#2) used 3 tblspns of regular Hershey's Cocoa and when I ran out I used 3 tblspns of Dark Hershey's Cocoa...# 3) Make sure you realize the last 5 ingredients are for the author's icing...I make my own as follows: 1 stick of softened butter (salted), 1 stick of softened cream cheese (Philadelphia), and add powdered sugar to desired sweetness (approx. 1-2 cups) and  you're done!  I used a 13x9 rectangular non-stick pan and left it in there when iced and served (even decorated with Easter Sprinkles!...felt like a kid again).  Great recipe, especially if you don't have any eggs handy. My hubby and guests asked for seconds! This recipe is definitely a keeper, would be a great birthday cake.

I followed the recipe and divided into 2 9" pans. I only used 1 and cut it into 2 layers. I put the whipped filling in between and topped with raspberry preserves. I then frosted with chocolate frosting. The Raspberry really enhanched the flavor. Excellent recipe.

This is delicious.  The first time I made it, it had lumps of flour in it.  The second time, I mixed the dry ingredients first and then heated the water before adding the remaining ingredients, which helped a lot.  And also, I use my own butter cream frosting recipe (butter, vanilla, confectioner's sugar, and a tablespoon half-and-half.  Moist and delicious!

I loved the cake!  It tasted great!  I had to adjust the cooking time slightly as it didn't seem quite done.  I used a peanutbutter frosting recipe as someone had suggested, and it was a hit with my family!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this cake for my mother-inlaws birthday. The cake is very easy to make and really tastes like a gob. I will be making this many more times in the future and would recommend the recipe.

I made this for my moms birthday. I'm not a big baker so I was a little nervous about it. I added some melted chocolate drizzle to the top just for fun and it turned out delicious! Everyone loved it!

didnt go over well at our house.  Frosting could have been sweeter for our taste.
