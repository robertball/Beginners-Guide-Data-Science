so is it bad that I made these last night and after tasting them I hid them in the back of the fridge hoping no one finds them?? WOW these are good!! Listening to other reviews I melted the butter and added the sugars to melt (I used splenda brown sugar and xylitol instead of sugar to make them as a sugar free version) used sf hersheys dark chocolate chunky natural pb for the topping and cut them into brownie size squares so I don't over indulge. SOO GOOD!!

These were extremely quick and easy to make. I used crunchy PB and semisweet chocolate chips for the topping and they turned out great. I found that the bottom oaty layer was a tad crunchy though so if I make them again I think I'll melt the sugars with the butter so that they dissolve because I didn't really like the undissolved crunchy sugar crystals. The taste was amazing though (the topping is to die for!!!) so maybe I'll try them again with the variation I said. Some of my family refuses to eat them due to the crunchiness...more for me:)

I made these as a sugar free version. I used splenda splenda brown sugar sugar free chocolate chip and natural peanut butter. They were very very good!

I run my own cafe and am proud to make all the sweets homemade. I visit this website often and was looking for something quick and easy when I found the recipe for the butterfinger bars. I received rave reviews from those (not to mention from myself) that ate at my cafe that day. Thank you for such a quick easy and fantastic recipe!

Very good! They sorta taste like chocolate covered granola bars. My only complaint is that the bars are hard to cut into. Maybe melting the sugar with the butter would help that.

These take virtually no effort to make and are perfect when in need of a quick dessert. (They look similar to rice krispie treats with chocolate on top!!)

My family loved these! Even my mom who is not too fond of peanut butter said they were great. I baked them for the right amount of time but instead of being "toasty" I found that it was quite bubbly...not toasty at all. I still took them out of the oven at the point and they still turned out perfect...not sure what went wrong.

These were awesome! They were super easy to put together. There were a couple of things that the recipie should have mentioned -- When you heat chocolate chips in the microwave you need to do it at half or less power for small intervals so the chocolate doesn't burn. Also you need to put these bars in the refridgerator for a couple of hours after you make them to make them harden. I agree they were a bit sweet so I might cut some of the sugar next time.

This was very easy to make and tasty. It is too sweet for me though. I may try it again with putting the peanut butter and chips into the mix and cutting back on the butter and sugar.

Without any doubt THE fastest cookie recipe in my collection. What is more the ease and speed of baking didn't result in a lack of taste. Will bake it again. Thanks for sharing.

This is one of the few recipes I actually took the time to bookmark. I add a few more chocolate chips to the top but the rest is perfect! One of the most popular desserts I make!

These are sooo good. i've made 4 batches since 2 days ago! i made my own little alterations and it was to die for. I added a little honey and cinnamon and raisins to the oat mixture. then before i poured the chocolate mixture i laid down coconut and fresh blueberries. then for the chocolate mixture i took honey roasted creamy peanut butter. and melted it with Hershey's chocolate reeses cups Pay days and babe ruth bars. OH MY GOD. I cant describe to you how amazing it was. Make sure to top with raisins!!! there are so many thinds you can do with this. i cant wait to try other fruits with it like strawberries!

I am so sorry to burst everyone's bubble! I made these exactly as directed. They turned out VERY sweet and extremely crumbly. I couldn't even cut them into squares once they were cooled. I was disappointed

I didn't think these were as great as other reviewers but it is hard to give a low rating to a dessert! Maybe I would prefer it with semi sweet chips and crunchy PB... It is very easy so I may try it again.

Very yummy. Perfect if you're looking for something sweet and crunchy to eat. I've had the same problem as other reviewers in that they crumble a lot when you try to come them into squares so I might suggest looking for something different if you plan to bring them to a party or something.

I really wasn't impressed. The recipe is very well written and it was easy to make but we just didn't care for the whole combination. My kids did enjoy making it though so maybe we will try some other things with oatmeal. Thanks for sharing sorry we are so picky!

This was a very good recipe. Like the other reviews I melted the sugars with the butter prior to mixing with the oats. I added a little bit more chocolate and peanut butter than what the recipe called for and the dessert came out great. I put it in the fridge to harden the chocolate faster. My family absolutely loved it and the dessert was gone within the hour.

These are great quick and easy cookie bars. The crust didn't stay together well the first time I made them so I added 2 tsp. flour to the crust mix and it made all the difference. I also used crunchy peanut butter and they were great!

it was great!! fast and easy. The only problem is tht it takes a while for the chocolate to dry. i would recommend letting this set overnight so that the chocolate can harden. Thanks

Taste-wise these were great but they were a mess to serve. As some suggested I heated the sugars with the butter and also cut down on the white sugar to 1/4 cup. Since I had an open container of applesauce I decided to replace a 1/6 cup of the butter with that and probably saved 10 calories lol. I realized that my big pan was still at someone's house so I used two pans. I had trouble getting the topping to spread on the bottom without it pulling everything up. When it had cooled I cut is as well as I could and just scooped up the remnants with a fork. It was plenty sweet with the sugar reduction and tasted great. It was amazing how the peanut butter shone through even though it looked like it was just chocolate. I think the mixture needed more moisture in it to make the bottom stay together. FYI- I used Old Fashioned Oats. I had oatmeal yesterday for breakfast and then a few of these treats and couldn't eat dinner last night. Plenty of fiber going on.

An excellent recipe! Quick only 6 ingredients and tastes great! I think you'd be able to change it a little too.. I used crunchy peanut butter (I did a half-batch and used an 8x8 inch pan so I used maybe cup of peanut butter to allow for the peanut chunks) and it turned out excellent! Next time I'll try adding some finely chopped nuts to the crust maybe try a peanut butter icing and sprinkling with chocolate chips. Thank you for the recipe!

Love this recipe and so does everyone I shared it with. I have made it a few times now. The first exactly as it was written and it was excellent no issues with having the base being too hard it was firm but not overly hard. The next batch I used almond butter instead of peanut butter. The batch after that I used almond butter again and mixed in some dried cranberries into the base. The final batch I made I used a mix of peanut and almond butter and mixed into some coconut flakes and dried cranberries into the base. Extremely versatile and flexible recipe. This is a keeper!

Excellent dessert! After reading other reviews I melted the butter in a saucepan and added the sugar until dissolved. Then I added the oats and proceeded as in the recipe. YUMMY!

Delicious and I didn't change a thing! They also keep very well in the fridge or in tupperware at room temperature.
