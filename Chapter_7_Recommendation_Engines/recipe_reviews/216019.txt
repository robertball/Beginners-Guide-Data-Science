This is very good, I like the touch of orange.  The only thing I will change is to bump up the cinnimon by 1/2 teaspoon, which is personal preference.  Will make again!

My family loved this recipe and ate it up in no time, but I gave it four stars because I found it too tart for my taste. It definitely needed that scoop of vanilla ice cream on top to balance out the sweet and sour flavors. In the future I might try using less cranberries, and more apples and sugar. However, I still think it's a great recipe, especially if you're a fan of cranberries:)
(note: the recipe says a 9x12 pan feeds only 6 people! It really serves about 12)

Won't be making this again, so glad I only made half a recipe. Made like recipe said, but did use more cinnamon as others suggested.  I have better cranberry crisp recipe, but thought since this had apple it would be a nice change. WRONG.  If we'd liked the filling better I would've made my usual topping because this didn't have any flavor & seemed very buttery.  I like the ones with flour in with the oatmeal & butter because it gets crispier.  Sorry, but not worth keeping for us.

Just made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I think next time I'd use less nutmeg.

Was more of a cranberry/apple sauce than a dessert cran/apple crisp.  Lack something to bind it together (that's why it was a sauce & I followed the directions to a T).  I would not have chopped the apple, but slice them.  I like flour added to my topping for more of a crispy chunky texture.  I would not make this one again.

I cut this recipe in half and baked in a 9x7" Pyrex dish.  The only thing I changed was to add about 1 T of flour to the topping.  I think it turned out perfectly.  People complaining about tartness shouldn't be making cranberry anything.  This definitely isn't a sweet crisp, but I prefer it that way.  I used Cameo apples.

This was and awesome recipe! Nice change for a dessert instead of cookies, cakes and pies. Its sweet and tart and perfect just the way it is. I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I had to double the topping, just because I like the topping. The family loved it! I'll definately make this one again and again :)

This was less sweet than I expected but we enjoyed it with ice cream. I don't cook with cranberries often and usually the sugar in the recipe hides more of the tartness. Hard to know that up front. The filling was runny but served in a bowl with some vanilla ice cream still looked festive. I used an empire apple, didn't peel it, and added a little flour to the topping. I only made one serving (but used a whole, small apple) and ended up with a 4x7 dish that served 4 with ice cream.
