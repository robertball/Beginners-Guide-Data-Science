This cake is delicious! I made it into cupcakes (12 mins in the oven - made about 28) for a bridal shower and got tons of compliments. I did not think it was bland at all. Great flavor, great texture, and so easy to make. Frosted the cupcakes with the Cream Cheese Frosting II - had a bit left over. The two go together very well and many people have asked me for the recipe. Even someone who normally hates carrot cake loved this! I highly recommend it! UPDATE: I have made this recipe many times, in cupcakes and regular cake. It's always a huge hit. In cake form, you can use all of the frosting you make from Cream Cheese Frosting II. UPDATE 2: Still making this 6 years later and still a huge hit. Fills a 13 x 9 pan quite well and baked in 50 minutes. For that size, you need only half of the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe to frost the top.

This is the easiest carrot cake to make. I have had this recipe for over 32 years and have had restaurant owners ask me for the recipe.  It is a very moist cake.  Delicious!!!!!

This is a wonderful recipe! My fiance and I both don't care for the texture most carrot cakes have, from the grated carrot. The baby food in this recipe takes care of that problem nicely! I've made only this recipe since I first tried it, and I have always had a nice, moist, fluffy cake. I've followed the directions exactly, and never had the problem with the cake under-cooking, like some people are talking about (and my oven heats on the lower side, too).

I really recommend this cake!

I'm diabetic, so I use Splenda instead of sugar, and I used Neufchatel instead of regular cream cheese in the frosting, but the cake was delicious anyway - and not expensive at all to make.

This is a really good, moist recipe...BUT, I think using baby food as opposed to real carrots provides a WAY muted carrot flavor, so it was not what I was looking for : )

I have made this recipe now probably a good hundred times, work gatherings, Sunday dinners, Holidays.... and Just because. Everyone always loves it. It has never once failed me. This is THE best recipe I have found I always have to make two batches. One to keep for home and one for the function I am taking it to. This has the perfect blend of spices and a lovely texture.

This carrot cake is delicious! I've made this three years in a row for my husband's birthday. It always comes out moist and delicious with the perfect blend of flavors. The baby food really cuts down on prep time, and I like that it doesn't have pineapple or raisins in it. If you're looking for an easy and delicious carrot cake, you've found it! :)

I love this recipe!  I use it often for cupcakes.  I have also added grated carrot because I do like the texture. It's perfect with the Cream Cheese Frosting II Recipe.

Wow!  I made this for my aunt's birthday, and I don't even like carrot cake, but this was wonderful!  The icing was great, too.  I didn't have cloves, though.  I'll most certainly make this again.  Thanks!

I followed the advice of another and pureed a can of carrots in the blender in lieu of using baby food.  The cake was absolutely delicious!!!  My step daughter said it was the best cake she ever had, and I'm not exactly known for my good cooking.  Frosting is phenomenal!

This review is for the cake only, as I used a different recipe for the frosting.  I made 28 cupcakes out of this recipe.  I chose this recipe because the cupcakes were easy for my 3 yr old to help make with the carrot baby food; no grating carrots.  He and his friends loved them, and my husband did too.  My FIL thought they were gingerbread instead of carrot, so not a strong carrot flavor, but overall very good and moist.  Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe but it tastes stronger than your regular carrot cake b/c it has a bit of a kick.  I liked it for a change.

The first cake I have ever made from scratch and the first carrot cake I have made. My husband loved it! It was very moist. The icing was really rich. I thought this cake was very easy to make. I left out the pecans and I didn't have cloves and it still tasted yummy!

I've always been a fan of chunky carrot cakes, but this is the perfect recipe for the picky people in my family! It has all of the carrot and spice flavor, with none of the chunks of carrots, thanks to the addition of baby food. The directions and amounts were perfect. I'll definitely be making this again.

This was easy and AMAZING. Made them for my husband's birthday party and everyone couldn't believe how good they were and that I made them myself. I had extra icing and used it for a chocolate cupcake as well...the result was absolutely heavenly.

EXCELLENT! It is better with applesauce instead of oil. I made cupcakes with the batter and had twice as much icing as I needed. So the icing recipe is big enough for cupcakes, and a 2 layer 9 inch cake. VERY tasty though.

This cake is pretty good.  I didn't have any of the issues others reported with the batter not cooking through.  I did modify the recipe as follows: 1) Used 2 3.5 oz cartons of carrot baby food 2) Added one finely grated carrot 3) Added 1 cup of crushed pecans I made them into cupcakes and frosted with a simple cream cheese frosting.  Will make again!

This was so moist, and soooo good. Spendy baby food is unnecessary. All you need is 1 can of carrots and a blender. Voila! instant baby food with no added preservatives.

I made this for a special family celebration.  I halved all the ingredients (but didn't use cloves because I don't have any) and the batter made 24 medium size cupcakes baked about 15 minutes per pan.  I put the icing in a quart size zip bag, snipped the end and piped the icing on the cooled cupcakes.  They were a big hit and people were suprised by the baby food!  It tasted more like a spice cake than a carrot cake to me but either way it is YUMMY!

I love carrot cake but hate shredding all those carrots. I believe this recipe is for me so, I tried it and found the temperature is wrong. Because this cake is so moist, the temp needs adjusting. It needs to cook longer at a lower temp. My center never cooked while the top continued to burn after another 10 minutes of cooking. I'm going to try 325  for 40 minutes next time. All in all, though, this was a very delicious tasting cake. (At least the edges were. LOL). I like this recipe but plan to adjust it a little. Maybe half white half brown sugar next time. The baby food idea sold me on this cake, though. I also used walnuts instead of pecans.

I just made cup cakes with this recipe. They are perfect consistency, moist, and delicious. The icing is amazing. On top of all that, it is a very easy recipe that is from scratch except baby food.

I've been baking a version of this carrot cake for years and it is one of the best cakes I've ever tasted. I add an 8 oz can of crushed pineapple (drained) to the mix. It's out of this world!!

The best carrot cake I've made! Super moist.   This recipe never fails me and I get requests for it every time I serve it.  My sister-in-law substituted the carrots for pumpkin at Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  The only change I make is in the icing.  Instead of 4 cups of icing sugar I use 3 and omit the nuts due to allergies.  It makes a lot so I usually half the recipe.  Simply the best....a must try!

I just made this.  It doesn't even have the icing on it yet, but I was a making a shaped cake, so I cut some extra off and ate it solo.  It is delicious.  I can't wait to serve it tomorrow for Easter.  I am sure it will be a hit.

This is a wonderful carrot cake, particularly for people who like the taste of carrot cake without a lot of "texture" from grated carrot.

It reminded me of some kind of carrot-spice cake, but it was really good. Everyone enjoyed it and had a hard time to STOP eating it.  The second time I made it I added 1/4 cup raisens and that came out good as well.

Pretty good carrot cake, but for some reason mine turned out really dense, almost like pound cake.  But, I'm still giving it 4 stars because it still tasted great and was really easy.  Maybe I'll try this one again and see what happens.

Finally! I found a carrot cake recipe with carrot baby food instead of the dreaded grated carrots. My mom used to make it with the baby food and I haven't tasted a moister carrot cake since.  Thank you for the baby food.

We love this recipe for cupcakes!  The only thing I would do differently is add additional spices since we prefer carrot cake to be spicier.  Also, I substituted part applesauce for the oil.  We liked the texture of these; very moist.  The frosting recipe makes a large batch, but I was very generous with frosting the cupcakes, so there was very little left over.

I have been making this cake for over 8 years now and I always get compliments.  My husband loves carrot cake and finds this to be tasty but more of a "spice" cake than a traditional carrot cake with all the texture.  But everyone else I make it for raves about it.

I made this for my co-workers.  They LOVED it.  I only took out the nuts due to someone having an allergy.  Two of my co-workers don't like Carrot Cake at all, but really liked this one!!  One liked it because the spices weren't over powering.  This is definitely
 a keeper!

I tried it and this cake is so moist, I felt the temperature is wrong. 
Although it tastes good with all the spices but it was tooo moist and sticky I couldn't get it out of the pan, very hard to serve.

Great, but not the best I've ever had. I grated two carrots to add to the batter with the baby food, and I added some walnuts I had in the cabinet instead of putting pecans in the frosting. The cake is very moist, but I kind of wish I had used brown sugar instead of regular. I think that would give it the "something extra" I'm looking for. It really is good, but the frosting makes it great!

I have bought some carrots a few days ago, and realized I overstocked, nervous that they will go to waste, I began my quest for an easy carrot cake recipe. (Which is my favorite by the way :) I came across this wonderful recipe, and decided to give it a try. Of course with making a slight change, substituting carrot baby food , with real carrots. Keep in mind that a) this is my first time baking anything from scratch b) I am almost incapable of following cooking instructions c) I am a queen at craziest ingredient substitutions. Nevertheless, somehow I managed to pull it together this time, surprisingly I had all the needed ingredients, so no need for substitutions, and I actually managed to follow the instructions, as they were clear and simple (THANK YOU)! The only other change I made, was to frosting, I added it some lemon zest to it, just for little extra kick.My cupcakes , came out great ! I would have never in million years would have thought it was possible. Thank you so much for a great recipe ! Definitely a winner !

This is a delicious carrot cake recipe for those of us who don’t like the texture of shredded carrots! I made a half batch as cupcakes, and they are flavorful, light, and fluffy. The frosting is wonderful. I like to add a bit of cinnamon to the frosting - not so much for flavor but to give it a speckled look. Will definitely make again!

great recipe EXCEPT - please cut on sugar and you will see the difference. I used 1 cup instead of 2 for cake and half cup instead of 4 for frosting! and it was sweet enough. I don't know who could stand that sweet if you put all sugar. You should taste cream cheese for frosting not loads of sugar

I loved this cake, but my husband says it tastes too much like cinnamon and not enough like carrot cake.  The recipe calls for two 4.5 ounce carrot baby food jars, but the baby food I found came in four-ounce jars.  Maybe it's my oven, but I had to bake it at least a full ten minutes longer than the recipe called for.  The cream cheese frosting was yummy!

These were good, made them in cupcake form for my son's birthday. I prefer the traditional carrots/pineapple version for a cake. These were more a spicy carrot muffin.

My daughter's birthday is St. Patty's day. She asks for this cake every year. We often have a big party - we're the Ryan family - & this cake gets rave reviews. Sometimes I use the cream cheese frosting, sometimes I just dust it with powdered sugar. Either way, it's delish!

I tried this! And it turned out really well. But I used fresh carrots instead.
