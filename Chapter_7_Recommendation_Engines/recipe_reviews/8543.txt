This was really very good.  First time I made this I followed the directions by spreading the rice on top of the chicken, however the rice on top did not cook all the way through. After it was finished baking,I also had to take the chicken out stir the ingredients together. The second time, I mixed all the ingredients together in a bowl including the rice, and poured the mixture over the chicken.  If was wonderful!!

My family loves this.  We double the soup & onion soup mix and add 1 1/2 cups rice & 3 cups water.  This way it's not as mushy & doesnt seem salty.  We also add mixed frozen veggies. 
I wish everything was this easy.

Totally Yummy!!! Here is how I did it and the taste and texture was amazing:
Layered bottom to top, melted butter quarter cup, chicken, sliced mushrooms, 1 pack onion soup mix, 2 cups rice, soups and water mixed first on top.  I did then add broccoli half way through cooking.  This was so good for us picky eaters in my home!!!!  Try it!

This was delish! Everyone gobbled it up. I saw a few reviewers had issues. This is what I did. -Melted 1/4 cup of butter at the botttom of the 9x13 pan.  -Placed the chicken in and sprinkled some garlic powder and pepper on top.  -Mixed the rice, onion mix, mushroom soup and 2 cups water (skipped the salt!!) in a bowl and poured over the chicken.  -covered with tin foil and baked it.

the best I can say is that the chicken was cooked. I read everyone else's reviews; I should have found another recipe. This recipe ought to be removed! Horrible.......

Our family loves this recipe and it has become a staple for us at least twice a month now.  The best thing is that we put in frozen chicken breasts and just add about 10 more minutes to the time.  It saves a lot of time and we can throw it together at the end of a busy day.

This was not good.  I used half the soup mix, more rice and less water and the rice was still mushy and overall the dish was way too oniony. (And I like onions)  I won't make this again.

I am NOT impressed at all. I was disappointed at how bland and digusting it tasted. I added some mixed veggies on the side to give it some color and the meal was still not improved. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone--it is a waste of your cooking time, and your chicken. Just look at the picture--major grossness!

Very good chicken dish... my Mom used to make this when I was little, about 35 years ago. We always called it "no peek" chicken.

pretty oniony in flavor.  so much so that I took the what remained and added a soup can full of milk.  Also, I chopped up some water chestnuts and let the dish bake again for another 30 minutes.   not sure if i would make again

This was a wonderfully delicious meal; I would definatly make it again.  I stirred in the soup mixture and rice together, then placed the chicken on top, placed foil over top of dish.  I had to cook longer then suggested in order for rice to be tender.  It turned out great and my five year old son loved it.

Good flavor, but way too much butter. I made the following changes: cut each chicken breast half into three of four pieces, added frozen vegetables, and added 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese. Next time I will omit the butter and double the amount of rice and water.

Fast, easy and quick to make...the taste was pretty good too! I think I might mix the rice and soup mixture together in a bowl before pouring over the chicken the next time. I skipped the salt on the chicken since the soup mix is pretty strong salt wise and used Mrs. Dash...it was wonderful!!!! This would be great to add some mushrooms to as well. Thanks so much Melissa..this was good stuff!!!!

Good and most of the family liked it.  I did change the recipe though.  Used butter flavored Pam instead of the stick of butter, placed chicken on it and sprinkled with pepper.  Mixed onion soup, can of cream of celery soup, 2 cups water and 1 cup of long grain and wild rice and poured over chicken, and then topped with broccoli.  Came out a bit watery but everything was cooked fine.  Very strong onion flavor but still very good.  Keeper for this family.

This didn't turn out at all. It was way too salty and the rice didn't cook. I even cooked it for an extra 15 minutes just to be sure the rice cooked. It still didn't help. I will not be making this again.

This was a great, easy recipe that is quick to prepare.  I used 1/4 c. butter and that was plenty.  Next time I'll probably leave out the butter all together and just spray the pan.  Thanks for the recipe!

This tastes very much like a recipe I used to make years ago and really enjoyed (have since lost the recipe).  My only problem was the chicken ended up very dry; I used chicken breasts and the cooking time was probably too long for them.  The rice part was good; I did have to cook a little longer so the rice mixture wasn't soupy.

Boyfriend and I both really enjoyed.  He likes pastas more than rice so I was surprised how much he liked it.  I made it exactly as stated, but I don't think it needed all the butter.

Very good and so easy to do. I did follow one review and mized the butter, onion soup, mushroom soup and water together first. Then poured it over the rice and chicken. Also, after it cooked about 50 minutes, I uncovered it and put some fresh shredded Parmesan cheese over it. Put it back in the over and let that melt.

Good, but a bit salty. My husband likes it.

It was soupy when I took it out of the oven; I added perhaps 1/4 to 1/2 cup rice and baked for another 30 minutes. Turned out fine after that. Perhaps that's because I used brown rice?

Will use half the onion soup mix and half the butter next time to cut down on salt and fat.

I'm afraid I had bad results for this. I took the advice of some and eliminated the butter, other's advice to combine the ingredients before cooking--both seemed sensible. I had the same problem others have mentioned that the rice did not cook properly. Possibly using instant or minute rice would be the answer. I can vouch that flavor was excellent--I used Campbell's soup and Knorr Onion soup mix, and it was seasoned very nicely. I would suggest others try my suggestion of the type of rice to use and give this a go, but as written, I think they might be disappointed.

I really enjoyed this dish, I didn't have any onion soup mix so I skipped on it and it would have had a lot more flavor if I had not, but with a little extra salt and pepper it still tasted good.  However I think I will put less butter in next time, when I reheated some for lunch this afternoon all I could taste was the butter.  I also had to cook it a bit longer than the recipe recomended because my oven was on the fritz, but the rice was cooked all the way through and was not runny, I wonder if some of the other reviewers needed to cook theirs longer?

I had to bump this recipe up to 5 stars because it's very good yet super easy. Here are some minor changes I made, based on the other reviews: only used 3 pieces of chicken, which I cut in half (about 1.5 lbs chicken total)-- next time I will use about 2 lbs; did not add extra salt, but I did use about 4 turns of the pepper mill; used 98% fat-free soup; used about 2 Tbs. Country Crock in place of butter. I melted the butter, poured it in the dish and added the chicken. I mixed the remaining ingredients and poured them over the chicken and baked for about 1 hr. It was a little soupy at first, but the dish I used was too big. Once I mixed it all up it was perfect. Can't wait to make it again.

This was very tasty. I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup, melted it in the microwave, them combined it with the rest of the ingredients (minus the chicken) in a bowl, as others suggested. I poured the mixture into the baking dish, placed the chicken on top, and spooned a little bit of the soup over the pieces. I also only used 1 pkg of the dry onion soup mix - which was plenty (considering one pkg has over 600mg of sodium!). Again, it was very tasty and I don't think we missed much by using just one. I also used Campbells "Healty Request" crm of mushroom soup which has 30% less sodium than the regular type. I didn't find this dish salty at all... Just right. Very easy to make; this will go into our regular rotation. Thanks!

This was great!  I put it together before I left for work, stuck it in the frig - called home to have hubby put it in the oven.  The kid's loved it!  I used only 1 pack of soup mix.

This is a basic recipe that is mostly instruction and is intended to be one that you adjust and season to taste. If you cannot make this taste good, you are a moron. Get out of the kitchen.

simple, does well as left overs, great for busy busy students and people on a budget who prefer to not "Just add Water" or eat out of a prepackaged box. just toss it all in the pan and let it cook while you do dishes, catch up on homework, chase the young ones. I would not serve this to anyone I was trying to impress.

This is very good but I made some changes that I think make it much better than the recipe here. I used 11/2 cups rice and 3 cups chicken broth rather than the water. Used 1/2 the butter called for. I mixed the soup, seaoning pack of onion mushroom and rice together with 1 cup of the chicken broth then poured over chicken then adding the remaing 2c broth to top. Baked at 350. Due to being to watery I mixed 2 TBS cornstarch with a little broth and poured into casserole cooked another 10-15 min and it was perfect. Family loved it.

I'm with some other reviewers that said this recipe was a bit bland!  I didn't think the rice had much flavor at all and neither did the chicken.  Won't be making again.  My kids love rice and they didn't eat much of this at all.

Absolutely delicious.  So easy to prepare & pop in the oven while I take care of other tasks.  I tried it with vegetable dip mix instead of onion soup mix & it was fabulous!  Definitely a repeat dish.

I used half packet of Beefy Onion soup mix and added a small can of sliced mushrooms. The 1 1/2 cups Instant brown rice I used was not enough (too soupy til cooled). Next time will use 2 cups. Great! thanks

I followed the suggestion to mix the rice in with the water and soups and was very pleased with the outcome.  I would give it 5 stars for a tasty, easy week night meal for which you most probably have the ingredients all ready in your pantry.  As suggested by others, no extra salt was needed.

This dish was very tasty and easy! Even the my very picky step-children ate it.  A couple of changes I would make for next time. A little less butter, maybe only 1pkg of the onion soup mix (2 made it a little salty for our taste) and maybe add some broccoli to the mixture. I was also out of cream of mushroom soup so I substituted it for cream of chicken and it worked out great!
Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this many times, and I was reading the reviews and saw that alot pf people were saying to salty or to much onion. Try it this way. Pre heat oven to 350 melt 1/2 to 3/4 stick butter,when melted take out from oven and pour 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cup rice, put chicken tenders on top of rice, (in bowl mix one can cream of mushroom soup and one can french onion soup add one can of water mix well) pour over chicken and rice (make sure chicken and rice is all covered) cover with tinfoil, make sure tinfoil is tight, bake for 1 to 1 1/2 hours and 350...this is not salty nor to many onions ..very juicy and very good, a family favorite..I hope I helped

A recipe that is easy, and the whole family, including my picky eater eats! I didn't think it was possible! I did reduce the butter by 1/2, and only used one packet of the packaged soup, and it was wonderful!

This recipe was outstanding. Thank you for it. I did, thanks to someones review, add everything together with the rice first. Added in some green beans as well. Didn't have onion soup mix but still tastes wonderful. Put some dride onion crisps on the top. Great for cubed chicken. No matter how its made it always seems to turn out for me and everyone loves it. Definately a favorite.

I thought the recipe turned out very well.  I substituted Pam olive oil spray instead of using the butter.  Also, I used about half an envelope of the onion soup mix.  The chicken turned out to be very juicy and the rice turned out perfect!!.  Would definitely make this again.

Wow!  This was a great recipe!  I mixed the soups, water, and some green beans together and then poured it over the chicken for a complete meal in one.  I also only used one of the Onion Soup packets and sprinkled about half of one over the top!  I will definately make this again!!

My mom used to make this for us all the time. She changed it a bit though. Instead of 2 packages of onion, she used 1 package of garlic herb mix. She also used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom soup, and half the butter.

Mediocre at best.  Rice was mushy & salty. Used one package of soup. Though it was very easy to make....I wouldn't make it again.

Not one of our favorites. Used only one package of soup mix (based on others comments) and still thought the onion soup mix flavor was overpowering. Rice was mushy. Chicken was ok. Won't make again.

very easy and quick and quite tasty.  I
didn't use all the onion soup - only one package because we have cut back on salt and it was very good!  Will make this again.

I'm sorry to rain on Melissa's parade, but I did not care for this.  I prefer to cook the chicken with 2 cans of mushroom soup and cook the rice on the side in the microwave (makes good fluffy rice!) It is quicker to prepare this way and the rice isn't mushy.

Oh boy was this great!!!  I made the following changes:  I cut up the chicken breast meat into about 4X4 inch pieces and placed them onto the buttered pan.  Put a can of cream of chicken soup (what I had on hand) and a half cup of milk into a bowl and microwaved for 1 minute.  Whisked together to combine.  Then added 1 1/2 cups raw rice, 2 1/2 cups of chicken stock, the package of onion soup mix and a good grab of dried parsley.  Mixed it all together and dumped it over the chicken in the pan.  Baked at 330 degrees covered with foil for 1 hour.  PERFECTION.   Oh man oh man is this good eats.

This is a family favorite and I do make adjustments to this recipe to make a huge panful. A lot of versions of this recipe simply don't make enough rice.  So I use cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soups, two cans of each (4 cans total) of the 98% Fat Free kind, 4 cups of rice, 2 cups of water and 2 packages of the dry onion soup mix. Top it with as much boneless skinless chicken breasts and thighs I can fit in the pan. I use a huge roasting pan that I spray with baking spray, eliminating the need for butter. Cover and bake at 350 for two hours.  Perfect!

I also used 1 1/2 cups of rice and 3 cups of water and mixed it all in a bowl to dump over chicken.  I left out the butter and just sprayed pan with Pam.  Instead of the spices I just used Mrs. Dash.  Use it sparingly though because mine ended up really spicey.  My Husband loved it so much that Mr. 'I hate leftovers' wants it tomorrow night also!

Yummy, thanks for sharing this recipe!  I was in the mood for some comfort food and this did the job!  I made a few tweaks: used 3 breasts (my Publix only sells in 3's) and cut them into bite-sized peices; browned them in the butter (i used a mixture of butter, olive oil & smart-balance) on the stovetop and added all of the other ingredients over a low flame to get it all mixed up; also added a little chopped onion, water chestnuts, canned 'shrooms, garlic powder, white wine and about 1/2 cup of sour cream -- oh, and about 4 tablespoons of grated parmesean sprinkled on top; poured it all into a 9x12 baking dish, well-doused with "Pam", spreaded it evenly (very important to get the rice distributed...i had a few "lumpy" spots) and covered tightly with foil; baked about 1 hr, 10 mins and let sit covered for another 10 mins.  Served with steamed spinach and bread...yummy-yum.  Thanks again for sharing Chicken Something!  This is a keeper for those nights we need greasy comfort food.

I hate to give a bad review but this was not good at all.  The only reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because it is as stated, quick and easy... but it also tastes like it was effortless.  The chicken was blah, and I added seasoning, and I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic.. I can't even find anything good to say, I guess the rice tasted good, but definitely not good results.  I'm sorry.

This is so good it's ridiculous! My family loves it! The only thing I would add is to put extra cream of mushroom on top of the chicken. My family likes it with more sauce. The rice in this dish is sooooooooo good!!!! I would recommend everyone try this recipe! Thanks Melissa

I was disappointed because the rice came out like soup.  I followed the recipe exactly except i only used 1 pkg of soup mix.  The chicken was cooked and very tasty so i gave it a 3star rating. I might try it again with less water.

Great recipe- very tasty. However I think the pan may be too big unless you mix all ingredients (except chicken and saving a little onion soup) together and pour around the outside of the chicken. Then sprinkle a little onion soup on top of the chicken. The reason being that the rice that is on top of the chicken will not cook without the liquid!
I also used 1.5 packets of brown onion soup (reduced salt kind) and it was not too salty like others have mentioned. Also added a splash more water as I added a splash more mushroom soup. It came out just great- the chicken was nice and moist too! Will definitely make this again.

This was too salty for me, too oniony for my husband and our 3-year-old wouldn't touch it. After reading all the great reviews I thought we'd have to like it. Guess it's just not a recipe for us.

This definitely was "Chicken Something" ! Since We have someone that is lactose intolerant I substituted chicken broth for the cream of mushroom soup.  The chicken was tender and the rice was cooked throughout.

I can't rate this since I made my own chicken broth, cooked chicken tenderloin in herbs from the garden, fresh portabella m-rooms, herbed chicken soup probably and some other changes. This sure motivated me to use things I actually had on hand! Mine was deelish & I bet this is too :)

In my opinion, it was way too salty. Also, it was a bit dry.  I used saffron rice and I probably should of added 1/4 cup more water.  I did not add any extra salt or pepper.  Cooked this in a cast iron casserole and the chicken stuck to the bottom.

Not Bad. I doubled the soup & rice to make more.  It is mushy, but it's still good.  Don't expect a firm rice mixture, it is in the oven, not fried on the stove.  Onion soup mix could have been cut in half. Chicken was cooked. Not bad. I will try it again and tweak it more.

This was really easy to make, very good and fast.  I mixed all ingredients together in a bowl (except the chicken and butter).  I sprayed the dish with pam.  Placed chicken and butter squares at the bottom of dish.  Then poored rice mixture evently over the top of the chicken and then put it in the oven to bake.

This definitely needed some modifications. You don't need the butter, it made it way too greasy. I will add another can of cream soup next time and I added about a cup of peas. The concept is good though and the baking time was almost right on. Mine baked for 1 hour and 10 minutes and everything was cooked just right.

I absolutley love this receipe. It is great if you have left over chicken from a previous nights dinner. However, I do alter it to my liking by not adding the onion soup mix in and just putting different spices in a bowl with chicken and shake it up to coat. I also add 1 can milk to the soup mixture and microwave it for 1 minute and stir it up then add in 1 1/2 cups water. The result is a nice and creamy sauce baked into the rice.

Pretty good in my book!  It reminds me of a dish I once found on the back of a can of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup - yum!  I used a package of boneless, skinless thighs instead of breasts, and forgot to salt & pepper, but it still tasted great.  I baked in a 9" glass covered dish at 330 for an hour and while a little of the rice in the center (Oh, I mixed everything together, then put the chicken on top) wasn't cooked, I'm sure that would have been remedied by a quick stir about halfway thru baking.  Oh, one other change - I used 1 1/4 cup rice and omitted the butter (just sprayed the dish).  I'll make it again!

Great tasting.  This must need instant rice since I used long grain and had to cook 1 hour and 20 minutes at 325 and 20 more minutes at 400.  The second time I made this I used instant brown rice and it still needed to cook a little longer.  Will make this again.

I decided to use dark meat with the skin instead of white meat.  Use half the butter or less if you do! I also skipped the dry onion soup mix (couldn't find it here in Sweden).  Added two small cans of mushrooms which was a nice touch.  Came out very good and was delicous as leftovers.

I modified the recipe after reading the reviews; I used pam to prepare the casserole dish, used frozen chicken breasts, mixed a package of onion soup mix with one can of mushroom soup and 1 cup brown rice and added 2 1/2 cups of water, then poured all of that over the chicken.  It took 1 1/2 hours to cook and was really watery after the first hours so I took off the foil so that the liquid would evaporate. It turned out okay, but even though I didn't add any salt (only sprinkled a small amout of black pepper on at the end and added 1 Tbs. chopped fresh parsley it was really salty tasting at the end.  It wasn't all that good or exciting in the end, I probably won't make it again.

This is a great throw together meal.  I didn't have white rice or the dry onion soup mix, so I used a wild rice with the seasoning package and still used the mushroom soup.  It was wonderful!

This was a great and easy recipes.  I used chicken breast tenders and it turned out just as good, I think.  Next time I will probably use chicken broth in place of the butter - a whole stick makes this horribly unhealthy.

This receipe is horrible.  Lose the butter.  The rice was too mushy.  The chicken was not done.  I had to cook it longer than what was called for.  Overall, I would give it a half a star.

This was EXCELLENT, however, I made 4 changes: 1) I used Basmati rice (all I had) 2) I used low fat soup (1/2cup of butter made me feel guilty) 3) I put a sprig of tarragon on each breast 4) I turned the breasts over a few time to get the soaked in the butter.
This was really great and easy. I think next time I will try to cut the butter by 50% and replace with milk; it was pretty rich as it stands. If you don't like tarragon, try another fresh spice. The rice came out fine, perhaps the other people did not pre-heat the oven, or seal the foil..? (just an idea)

I made this tonight and it was soooo good!!!  Comfy meal.  I didn't have any onion soup pack, so I just left it out and followed the rest.  My hubby said "now this is his favorite!"

This is a great recipe but I have made a few changes, instead of rice, use chicken and rice soup, cream of mushroom soup and lipton onion mushroom soup, mix together and add your chicken breast of chicken tenders to speed up cook time. A great winter time meal served with a salad

This was a good recipe for the adults but the kids would not eat more than a few bites.  It was too oniony for them, and honestly for me too.

I'll probably make this again, as it is so easy and tasted good (not gourmet, but a good mid-week, easy dish).  However, I would use all Low Sodium soup products because it was very salty.

Quick and easy!  I didn't have dry onion soup mix, so I substituted with a spinkling of Dry Chicken broth granules, and Dried Chopped Onion to taste.  Put the ingredients in, throw it in the oven, and relax for an hour!  My husband even really liked it, and he is a little picky.

I liked this a lot and I will probably make it again. I only used one package of onion soup mix, and I added frozen broccoli florets to make it a complete balanced meal. It was very tasty!
