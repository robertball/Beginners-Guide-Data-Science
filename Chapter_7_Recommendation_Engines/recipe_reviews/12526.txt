I will be upfront.  I submitted this receipe several years ago.  It continues to be my favorite apple pie.  I should have suggested some additions and alternatives that I use when I submitted this recipe, so I will now.  First, you can substitute the first 1/2 cup of "white" granulated sugar with brown sugar.  I also often add spices, such as cinnamon, nutmeg, or ginger.  Finally, I usually use orange juice instead of apple juice.

Great flavor. Had to tweak it just a little. Took the suggestion from other reviewers and added a teaspoon of cinnamon and reduced the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup. My husband thought it was perfectly sweet with the reduced amount of sugar. Also added a tablespoon of lemon juice that I read from another recipe. Personal tip: I found it easier to remove the apples and thicken the syrup and then stir the apples and syrup together. I wanted to be sure that I didn't have any clumps of cornstarch in the bottom. Will definitely make again! Thanks, Darcy.

This pie is really good.  I've always made apple pie the traditional way but would fret the whole time it cooked wondering if it was going to be too runny, too tart, etc.  Its so much easier making it this way, pretty much fool proof.  I added 1 tsp cinnamon and used macs cuz thats what I had. The only tip I have is to cut the apple slices pretty thick so they stay in tact. I think I'll use this recipe from now on.  Thanks.

I wish that I could give it 10 stars...this is the apple pie recipe that I have been looking for.  I am a professional cook/baker and have tried hundreds of different apple pie recipes. In the past they have always been to runny, or the apples were too hard, or the bottom crust not cooked well enough, but not with this one.  

This is the one that reminded me of the great pie I ate as a kid.  It will be the only apple pie that I will ever make again.  I did raise the amount of cornstarch to 4 Tablespoons and also added in fresh nutmeg and cinnamon.  This is a keeper....YUMMO!

I made the apple pie last night and it taste absolutely delicious. However next time I will cut back on the sugar (too sweet) and I will more than likely put 3-4 tbsp of corn starch to prevent runny apple filling.  I added some vanilla extract and cinnamon to taste. I will definetly use this recipe again.

This is THE BEST apple pie I have ever tasted.  I am not fond of pie in general, but wanted to try it as my family loves it.  I used the orange juice, like someone had suggested, added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 2 dashes nutmeg.  A keeper!

I love this recipe! It is sooooooooooo easy my 12-yr-old actually made the pies all be herself.  She actually made two - One just as it appears for the potluck luncheon at church (everyone loved it!) and one for herself & her daddy who are diabetic. For the "diabetic pie" she replaced the sugar with Splenda, used Old Orchard Healthy Balance apple juice (75% less sugar, sweetened with Splenda) and cut the butter in half. The "diabetic pie" was so good we felt guilty eating it & she had to tell us which was which.

Just the BEST!!!! I also paired it with the french pastry pie crust recipe and it was perfect, the flavors/texture combine so well. I only made a lil change, instead of apple juice I added a splash of white wine, WOW!!!! you only have to wait for the alcohol to evaporate. Maybe next time i'll cut down on sugar because white wine makes apples mixture even sweeter. I made this pie yesterday night and i'm sure iÂ´ll have to make it again next weekend!! Thanks for sharing this great recipe, Gracias!!

This recipe was awesome!!! I had to tweak it a little but it still came out great. I would add cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, vanilla extract, brown sugar instead of white sugar and lemon juice.

This was my first attempt at an apple pie. I followed the suggestions of others by using orange instead of apple juice, added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, and a half teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg, plus a quarter teaspoon cloves and ginger. I added all of the above in whith the juice/sugar mix, plus I subbed a quarter cup brown sugar in and cut the white sugar by a quarter cup. I also only had one prepared pie crust, so I topped my pie with a crumb topping from this site. It came out wonderfull! My only complaint is that next time I'll make more of the filling as it didn't fill the crust to my liking, maybe I needed more apples. ;) Great recipe!

This pie was really good but I did one thing a little different.  I like to be able to pick up my piece of pie in my hand and eat it.  I added a bit more cornstarch and when the apple were cooked I used a potatoe masher and ran it down into the apples to make the apple pieces very small.  It was wonderful.

I loved this recipe using apple juice.  I changed the recipe a little using 1 cup apple juice and only 1/4 cup sugar and added 2 teaspoons of cinnamon for the filling.  For the crusts I used my Miracle Baking Powder Pie II recipe.  My father and brother says "Yummmmy".

Best apple pie I've have had.  Made it straight from recipe without any changes.  Froze it uncooked for 2 days and then thawed it and cooked it and it came out great.  Will definitely make this again.

I used his recipe as a base recipe and tweaked it to make it my own. I used less sugar and added a little lemon juice and some cinnamon. I also used more starch than called for so it wouldn't be runny. Turned out great!

okay...what I liked: got to taste the filling and adjust before putting in to pie. Didn't have to cook as long, thus pastry was golden instead of tan.
What I didn't like: took much longer to prepare than a reg. apple pie and basicaly came out the same.
Think I will just stick to the regular apple pie recipie, thanks anyways

I was looking for an apple pie recipe to make for Thanksgiving, and oddly enough I didn't have one. I love this recipe. I added cinammon to it and it was perfect. I cooked the filling, put it in the crust, and did a lattice work top. I then froze the pie to bake a few days later. It turned out awesome and everyone loved it.

This pie is awesomely good.  I substituted pineapple juice and a little lemon for the apple juice, as I didn't have it on hand.  Taste was yummy.  I lowered the sugar to 2/3 cup total, of which half was brown sugar, added a teaspoon of vanilla, cinnammon, and a dash of nutmeg.  And I used Gravenstein apples, as they offer a little tartness.

Very good but too sweet especially with the juice (I used OJ) - I recommend using 1/4 cup brown sugar and then later 1/4 cup white. Must add vanilla and cinnamon! For a treat add 1/4 cup dried cranberries. So good.

I'm glad to see that other cooks make the pie filling first as well.  I started doing so when my wall oven always seemed to be at too high a heat no matter what temp I set it on.  In order to delay replacing  an old oven, I started making the filling on the stovetop, then filling the crust and only having to worry about keeping the crust from burning.  It seemed like extra work at first, but there were never any surprises.  Not only did that work for the apple pies, but for others as well.  I made this recipe as written--only added some cinnamon and nutmeg and it was very good.  It's a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

I used the Pie Crust IV recipe for this pie. I skipped adding 1/2 cup of sugar and substituted 1/2 cup of maple syrup for the apple juice. I did not add any cornstarch.  I baked this for 40 minutes at 350F. The results were excellent. I will definitely make this again.

Used the recipe for its pie filling and I was not disappointed.  Had to substitute double flour for cornstarch and it was still great.

Exceptional! The changes I made were from other  reviews.  I did use oj instead of the apple juice only because I had oj on hand.  Also, brown sugar in place of the first 1/2 c. white sugar and I had apple pie spice, so I used a tsp. of that and 1 tsp of cinnamon.  Best Yet!!!! Thank You!

Very good.  I made changes as suggested by others.  Orange juice, brown sugar and white sugar, cinnamon and a touch of nutmeg, tablespoon of lemon juice.  I also added about 1/3 cup dried cranberries.

This pie was a hit at the Thanksgiving Dinner that I hosted for 25 people! Only thing I did different, I used 1 tbsp of Apple Pie Spice. I just sent my dad the recipe for him to make it for his co-workers in Austin. Great recipes!!! FOOL PROOF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Very good recipe! I also took suggestions from other reviewers: add 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and 1 tbsp lemon juice. I used orange juice instead of apple juice, and reduced sugars to 1/4 cup each. Butter was halved as well. Still, the taste was great! Not too sweet, not too sour. I will definitely use this recipe again!

As written, the recipe would definitely be lacking--at the very least, cinnamon is a necessity in apple pie .... for me, anyway.  I used Nitin apples that I got at the farmer's market--WONDERFUL for pie!  They gave up so much liquid that I think half as much apple cider would have been plenty.  I did use 4T cornstarch, 3 would probably have been just right.

This recipe is GOLD! No doubt it would be great as is, I'm just very particular about my apple pie and made the following changes. I added 2 tbsp of gingerbread syrup and substituted vanilla with 1 tsp of maple syrup. It was the most delicious apple pie I think I have ever had and when I used this recipe http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Easy-Pie-Crust/Detail.aspx reducing the salt by 1/2 and adding 2 tbsp sugar, it was also the easiest pie I have ever made. 15 minutes prep time for EVERYTHING!

This was a perfect recipe for me.  My husband actually does not like cinnamon.  So, if I make it for us, I can leave it out.  If I make it to take somewhere, I can add the spices I want.  Loved it!

Apple mix was too liquidy when poured into crust didnt solidify when baked. Will cut apple juice in half next time.  Except for that little point the recipe is great.  Along with other reviewers I really liked being able to taste the apple mix before baking.

This pie was delicious.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and 2 dashes of nutmeg, like another reviewer suggested.  I also replaced apple juice with OJ, since that's what I had on hand.  I didn't care for the orangey tang that it added, so next time I'll use apple juice.

Oh yeah, baby!  This one is amazing!  Combined with http://pie.allrecipes.com/AZ/BasicFlakyPieCrust.asp -- this makes an incredible pie.  As usual, I brushed the crust with egg whites for a beautiful golden brown appearance, and the filling from this recipe was fabulous ... a great Thanksgiving desert.  Thanks!

I love these recipes where you pre-cook the pie filling. It makes it so much easier to go light on the sugar and/or spices to start then perfect it as it cooks down - it's a great secret to having perfect fruit pies every time instead of guessing how much to add depending on the sweetness of the fruit. ;)

This was a very easy recipe. However, I found the pie to be too sweet for me. what I did was cut down on the sugar by half a cup, even then it tasted a bit too sweet.

Love this recipe!  All fruit pies and cobblers should always require you to cook your fruit first!!!  Only thing I did differently is that I made my own crust.

The first time I made this was for my husband, who was boyfriend at the time.  His favorite pie was an apple pie, and I succeeded during the test!

This Pie was AMAZING!!! We made it in multiples for a pie party- a bunch of us got together and made two pies per lady- one to donate to charity and one to take home--- I had my pie and this was the best apple pie I've had!!! The only change we made was adding a tsp of cinnamon! YUMMMMMMYYYYYYYYY

Great recipe and the first time I cooked the apples instead of just putting the apples in the pie crust.  This way the apples don't sink down.  I modified and added cinnamon and substituted cranberry juice for the apple juice.

I have a huge sweet tooth and this pie was way too sweet for me. I should have listened to some of the other reviewers and cut down to 1/4 cup sugar in each application. I did add lemon juice, cinnamon and a tad nutmeg. The flavor was there. I should have also not cooked the apples as long as I did, and I thought I was taking them off the heat too soon as it was. 

All that said, I thoroughly enjoyed this pie. I will make it again and use the knowledge I learned. It'll be worth it, I'm positive.

Wow. I won't need to look for anymore apple pie recipes. Added some cinnamon and vanilla, used granny smiths instead of macs, and did everything else as directions suggest (all this was personal preference, though), and it came out superb. Hubby and I downed it in two days. My two-year-old didn't like it, but he doesn't like fruit, so he doesn't count. The pie didn't hold together when I served it, but who cares? Didn't affect the taste at all.  :)  Nice recipe!

Mmmm,     I'm actually eating a slice now and it's sooo  good,  buttery but it's worth the calories!   I used a butter crust found on this website,  and organic golden delicious apples,  didn't have cornstarch so I sprinkled the apples with flour while they were cooking...   and let it bake.   My sortof mistake was that the crust didn't brown by the time the apples were done (dripping out of the pie-  use a cookie sheet underneath the pie pan while baking)  so the crust wasn't done and I broiled it   and it burned really quick but I think it made a flavor that wouldn't otherwise be there and it's caramelly delicious.   I used all brown sugar too,  and a bit of cinamon and cloves...   it's so good I don't mind one bit that it's burned.  "So don't broil it if it's for company"

Excellent recipe, best apple pie yet. I modified it a bit to cut back on butter(fats). Added a little cinnamon to apples while cooking, and this is a sure keeper in my book.

Absolutely spectacular! I used orange juice instead of apple juice, but otherwise followed the recipe. Because of the pre-cooking, you can adjust the seasonings to ensure pefect flavor. I don't see a need for any other apple pie recipe!  Thanks!

I just made this apple pie filling and it was very easy to make.  I did add cinnamon, nutmeg to taste and used orange juice instead of apple juice since that was what I had on hand and I took the advice from the other reviews.  I tasted it while it was hot and yummy is all I can say.  I can hardly wait for it to come out of the oven.  I turned it into an apple cobbler this time.  I gave it a 4 star only because I had to tweek it a little to make it taste a little more like apple pie vs.  cooked sweet apples.

Just made this pie and it is delicious!! I can truly say it is the best apple pie I have ever made. I did add cinnamon and nutmeg to flavor it up. Beware though...it is very sweet...this makes it taste yummy but if you or any family member is watching their sugar intake it can be knocked down by a quarter of cup or so and still taste great!

I am not an expert baker and this recipe comes out perfect every time. Maybe it is because I am just helping my 10-year old girl making it. We don't even bother looking for another recipe.

This was my first attempt at apple pie and it came out wonderful! I used Macintosh apples because thats what we picked at the orchard and it was perfect! I was a little skeptical about the apple juice, but it definitely worked.

Absolutely wonderful!  Very easy; very quick.  The only change I made was to add 1 1/2 tsp of apple pie spice.  I had numerous compliments on this and will use it again and again.  Thanks!

Wonderful pie..even without the taste of ground cinnamon!! However, there may be too much cornstarch...which makes the apple filling kinda thick...but overall, a great recipe!

This was great. As a beginner it was nice to know that the apples were cooked and the spices were just right. I took the advice of others and added cinnamon and nutmeg. Also removed the apples before thickening the liquid..great idea from another review. The only thing wrong was that I used a pie crust recipe from this site and the crust was terrible, it didn't do the filling justice. So be sure to choose a good crust recipe!

The BEST apple pie I've ever made! I used only 5 apples and 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup. I also added 2 tsp. of cinnamon. Shared it with 12 of my friends and they all loved it. Will make this again and again!

I made this pie twice this week and it was a hit both times! I followed others' suggestions to add vanilla and cinnamon.  I also took another person's suggestion and paired it with the french pastry recipe for the crust and it was a great combo. I am a first-time pie-maker and the recipes were easy to follow and yielded great results...Thanks!

I made this pie for the first time about 5 years ago, and I've made it on every holiday since! My whole family loves it! I can't tell u how many times a slice of apple pie has been ruined for me after biting into an undercooked piece of apple. This recipe eliminates that from happening with cooking the apples before baking. Its perfect....especially with a dollop of whipped cream on top!

I made this recipe, but I substituted apple cider instead of juice and cut back on the sugar. Definitely added more corn starch. I also added some cinnamon and vanilla. I had to make a gluten free pie crust and everyone loved it so much that they didn't believe that it was gluten free!

I guess no cooking times were listed since equipment, size of apple slices, etc. will vary, but here's what it took for me: 10-15 minutes cooking the fruit, 2-3 minutes with the cornstarch, then 45 minutes in the oven. I actually preheated my oven to 400, turning it down to 350 right before putting the pie in.
I chose this recipe to use some golden delicious apples. It wasn't as good as a more tart apple, but it was nice to have the filling done before the crust got burnt. When it was fresh, I thought there was too much liquid, but it firmed up well in the refrigerator. The recipe was good, and I'll keep the method in mind for the future, but I'll need to tweak it and use tarter apples if I make it again. Definitely add cinnamon and other spices if you want a more traditional apple pie taste!

This is the first time I tried this recipe.  I under under cooked the apples a bit before I put them in the pie crust and it still seemed mushy and sticky in my mouth.  I will be sticking to my old recipe.

I was looking for a recipe that had the apples cooked before baking and this is the one.  It's simple to make and the only thing I did the first time was overcook the apples. I tweaked it a little by adding some lime juice and a teaspoon of cinnamon and it came out great.

This was the 1st time I've made apple pie and I have to say this is the best apple pie I've ever eaten. Waaaaay better than store bought. I did change it based on others reviews such as adding cinnamon and using oj instead of apple juice and using brown sugar for the first half cup. I did find it alittle sweet so next time I'll probably cut the sugar. Definitely going to make it again...I'm actually going to make it again for thanksgiving tomorrow :)

This recipe was amazing, veryone at my house loved it.  I didn't have any white sugar so I used brown sugar instead, and I also added the lemon juice and cinnamon. Although make sure you don't let the apples cook too long then they get really mushy. But the pie was great!

Very very good apple pie recipe.  The only suggestion I have is to add cinnamon.
