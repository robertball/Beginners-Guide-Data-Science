It was reminiscent of the good old chex mix from my past.  I doubled the seasoning because I like a bold taste, decreasing the salt a bit so as not to be too heavily salted.  Got rave reviews!

This is a great base recipe. Mix 13c of your favorite cereals, crackers, pretzels, and nuts then drizzle the melted butter (with sauce and spices mixed into it) over the mixture. Put in pan and cook as directed. I love that I can make a low sodium Chex mix.

Six minutes in the microwave works well too.  Stir three times.

We never tried anything but original Chex Mix. This was a new twist for us. We did put a 1/2 cup of sunflower seeds into it. OH my goodness everyone just LOVES this.

I have tried a lot of “Chex Mix” recipes and this is definitely the best. You can change up ingredients as you want to depending on your crowd. I like to make up the mix and then add honey peanuts and cinnamon almonds so that we have some sweet in the savory. Put it in after you season the rest. A lot of the other mixes I’ve tried are way too salty or overpowering in their flavoring. You get pretty sick of the salt in those and they take over all of your other foods. This has a great taste and my only complaint is that I cant stop eating it once I start. Perfect tailgate or man cave snack!

The flavor tastes like I remember the original from the 50's tasting.

This is one of my DH's favorite munchies.  First time I've made it adding the goldfish crackers. The mixture has great flavor without any one item overshadowing the other.  I used extra large dry roasted peanuts as that is what I had on hand.  A fantastic recipe, that is sure to be made again.  Thanks Christie407, for sharing your version!
