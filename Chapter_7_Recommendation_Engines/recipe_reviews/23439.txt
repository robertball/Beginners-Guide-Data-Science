Delicious! This is an easy tip and makes a big difference in taste - in a medium pan over low heat, heat up the canned pumpkin puree, spices, and salt. Heating the pumpkin puree up takes out the "canned" taste of the pumpkin and melds the spices together nicely. Then, pour the mixture out into another bowl, and let it cool a bit before adding the condensed milk and eggs.  This little change makes the pumpkin taste much fresher!  My family loves this recipe, and I use a ready-made graham cracker crust, so easy and so good!

This is the best pumpkin pie recipe! I get rave reviews on it every year.  I always use a ready-made graham cracker crust, and it comes out great.  One suggestion is to let the pie cool on the oven rack, because it cools more slowly that way.  If you take it out onto the kitchen counter, the filling sometimes cracks because of the cold air.

Outstanding Flavor and very easy to make.  Two combinations I love.  A very sweet pie, nice appearance, and make sure to top it off with whipped cream.  This recipe is by far a 5 star!!  

Tips:  I did not use the ginger nor the nutmeg; instead I added 2 teaspoons of "McCormik's Pumpkin Pie Spice" (which includes: Cinnamon, Ginger, Nutmeg, and Allspice), along with the 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  My wife loved it but she thought it needed more cinnamon.  So I made the next one with 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and she loved it.  If you like a lot of cinnamon, that's the way to go.  For me, I preferred 1 teaspoon, but I'd eat it either way.

Thanks EAGLE BRANDÂ®

I have never made pumpkin pie before...us Australians don't eat pumpkin pie. But I am now a convert...you guys in the U.S of A are sooo clever. 
I want to make and eat pumpkin pie breakfast ...lunch...and dinner !!!
I can't believe we don't make this over here...I am going to make it for Christmas Day again for all our visitors...if i can keep my husband and myself away from the pies for just long enough to let the visitors have a slice or 2 each.
WAY BEYOND YUMMY ...HEAVENLY and DIVINE are words that come to mind.
I wonder if i should go down the street and buy another butternut pumpkin and make one more before Christmas Day...they say practise makes perfect lol. We don't have tinned pumpkin or pumpkin spice over here so I have to do everything myself...but maybe that makes it even nicer.

The easiest and best pumpkin pie I've ever made.  I followed a suggestion that someone else had made and used 2tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 2tsp of ground cinnamon instead.  The bottom of my crust was still a tad underdone so I would suggest pre-baking the crust for a bit.

This is a very tasty, traditional pumpkin pie.  I used fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned pumpkin, which I would recommend because it is fresher and gives more texture.  Also, if you are using a homemade pie crust, I recommend you bake it a tad before adding the filling.  Otherwise, the crust will get mushy.  I cooked my pie for almost an hour (cooking time varies)and then, cooked for 15 minutes on the very bottom rack to finish the cooking of my crust while also lightly browing the top of the pie.  You end up with a perfectly spiced product, perfect with Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner (or anytime you crave it!).

This recipe was awesome !!! Stick with the other reviewers tips and us 2 teaspoons of McCormick's Pumkin spice instead of ginger and nutmeg, I also added one teaspoon of cinnamon and warmed up  the spices and pumkin on the stove on low heat, cooling than adding the eggs and sweetened milk, it really made the spices meld together great like the other reviewer said to do. I have NEVER baked before and was able to make this recipe just perfect.  **TIP**- Where it says bake 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees....take my advice and try this- bake it at 350 degrees (after you've done step 1 on directions of course) Bake it at 350 degrees for 35 minutes, than turn off your oven and set your timer for 5 minutes while you let the pie sit in there, this way it will still cook for an additional few minutes while the oven is off but still hot and this way the oven will cool enough so that you can let the pie cool off on the top rack the remainder of the time. Doing this will prevent the pie from cracking when it hits the cool air of the counter when it's still very warm. I topped it off with cool wip and graham cracker crumbs, great texture....Thanks EAGLE BRAND!!!

Very good pie.  I always have soggy crust so I Bake the crust a tad before putting the filling in, I also let the pie cool in the oven. 
I also like it a bit spicier so a little extra spice makes it extra well for me (I like ground cloves in mine as well). I make extra filling and overfill deeper pans and bake the extra filling in oven with the pies for that special taste for the cook.
Maple syrup also adds real nice flavor.  How I make it depends on my mood.  Often I make several and make one spicy and one not for different taste to please all.

I have been baking pies using this recipe for years, and the requests keep coming in for me to make more and more.  My brother alone gets two - one to share with the family and one just for himself *grin*  This year alone I made 10 pies, and plan on making 5 more for Christmas.

Definitely a big hit, and I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

Absolutely delicious and the only recipe I ever use. I do add my own twist to this recipe, though. Firstly, I heat the canned pumpkin and spices on medium heat for a few minutes, to get rid of the canned flavor. Secondly, I use 2 teaspoons of McCormick's pumpkin pie spice, 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1 tablespoon of vanilla, and 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom. I use one and a half 14 oz cans of condensed milk (I love that sweet, rich flavor - the extra condensed milk really adds an outstanding richness to this) instead of just one can, and 3 medium eggs (to compensate for the extra liquid). Even with the extra half can of milk, the filling fits in a standard 9 inch pie crust (I use a store-bought crust). I bake at 450 F for 20 minutes, and then I cover the top of the pie with aluminum foil, and then bake at 325 F for 1 hour. I then switch off the oven and let the pie cool in the oven for an hour, before I refrigerate it. Tenting with aluminum foil while baking prevents the crust from getting burnt, and letting the pie cool in the oven ensures that the top does not sink and that the center is cooked. This pie tastes best when made a day ahead and refrigerated overnight - this gives the flavors a chance to blend. I have forgotten to add salt before, and not noticed any difference. I have always received rave reviews about this - this recipe is a keeper !

This pie tastes perfect and it is very easy to make.  It is the only pumpkin pie recipe I will ever use!  I recommend doubling the ammount of spice and using freshly grated ginger root unless you like your pumpkin pies very mellow.  

Don't forget to protect that crust with foil!

I recently made two pies for my cousin, who requests this as his birthday gift every year.  I usually make them with pumpkin pie mix from the can, eggs and evaporated milk, the trad. recipe I was taught.  This year I came across this recipe on the McCormick Pumpkin Pie Spice label.  So, I made one of each and I put them to the test.  This recipe using the sweet. cond. milk & McCormick spices was definately the winner!  It is so easy and so wonderful.

This is the greatest pie I ever made with fresh pumpkin.Great color, texture and taste. The sweetened condenced milk makes it the "Perfect Pumpkin Pie"! Try thawing then piercing a deep dish Pillsbury pie crust all around the side and bottom pop it on oven rack at 400 degrees for 8 min. remove & let cool. Then fill the shell and line the crust edge with strips of foil before baking. No more soggy or burnt crust!

This has always been my "go to" recipe, the best one ever.  To alleviate a soggy crust I brush with egg white before pouring in the filling.  I saw this tip on television back in the 80's.  Works on all pies, even turkey pot pie which is difficult not to be soggy.  Really works.

Not impressed. I followed the recipe to the letter. A thick skin developed on top of the pie that ballooned in the oven. The end result looked like a shar pei. The pumpkin itself was mild in taste and over baked.

This is the BEST pumpkin pie recipe!
I use a 10-inch KEEBLER READY GRAHAM CRUST which says on the label 
"2 Extra Servings".  This is a slightly
larger, deeper crust than the regular
9-inch so the filling all fits in perfectly without overflowing.  Also, the
trick to using a ready-made graham crust
is to place the crust in the freezer for
at least 3 hours or overnight.  Remove
from freezer just before filling and
baking.  This keeps the graham crust from
over-baking.  I place the pie on a cookie
sheet to bake and I shield the edges with
a pie crust shield.  I also add an extra
1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. of
allspice to this recipe.  Delicious!

I did bake this the full 40 minutes after I reduced the temperature.  I thought about leaving it in the oven with the door open after I turned off the heat to prevent cracking but after looking at this pie, I knew it wasn't going to crack out in the cold air of my kitchen so don't bother.  I added the spices it called for and didn't make any adjustment to the measurements - tasted great to me!  :)  Are the reviewers that are complaining about it not being sweet enough using sweetened condensed milk like the recipe calls for or are they mistakenly using evaporated milk as some other recipes call for?  This turned out with the perfect amount of sweetness in my opinion!

NO NO NO! If you don't regularly bake pumpkin pies (and I don't), you would not see the flaws in this recipe!  I made the mistake of just trusting the Eagle brand name, printed it off and made two pies for Thanksgiving. 

We ended up throwing away both pies and wasting a lot of ingredients we could not really afford to waste. It baked up as a tasteless custard pie!

First flaw - this recipe uses nutmeg instead of cloves. Could be a personal preference, but I like cloves in my pumpkin pie. 

The second BIG flaw - this recipe leaves out SUGAR! You have to have sugar with canned pumpkin. I didn't taste the batter, and I wish I had - I might have been able to rescue it. When we cut into the pie and it was so bland and just plain bad, I pulled my spices to see if they were "dead"!  My spices were fine - it was this recipe! I pulled a few more pumpkin pie recipes,and quickly saw the sugar had been left out, and the change in the spices.  

AVOID this one - it was truly horrible.

WOW!! This is a delicious and EASY recipe. After reading several reviews I decided to take some suggestions. I used a heaping teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon, a pinch of ground ginger, a dash of ground cloves, a 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla. I also used 2 & 1/2 cups of fresh pumpkin that I pureed in the food processor until smooth. I used all the other ingredients and poured them into a graham cracker crust, and let me just say it came out so good it's even delicious without whipped cream. Thank you for a great recipe and all those helpful suggestions.

Took some advice from others. Flipping perfect. My husband said it was the best he's ever had. And this was my first time making a pumpkin pie.
  First: I preheated the oven at 425. I put fork holes all through the bottom and sides of the crust. I pre-cooked the crust for exactly 10 minutes. I mixed the one can pumpkin, 2 eggs, 1 can sweetened condensed milk (YOU DO NOT NEED SUGAR.) The sweetened condensed milk IS the sweetener. I mixed 1 tsp. salt, 2 tsp.pumpkin pie spice and 2 tsp. Cinnamon. Then poured the mixture in the pre cooked shell and cooked 15 minutes at 425 as stated. Then covered my crust edges with foil, lowered the oven temp to 350 as directed and cooked another 30-35 minutes. If you have a big beautiful bubble, it's usually ready to pull out. Perfect non soggy crust, excellent spice ratio and thank goodness I didn't add the sugar. I love sweet and fattening but sugar is not needed at ALL in this. Excellent Pie. I will never buy or use any other recipe. It's perfect. Thanks for all the reviews and insights everyone.

I have made this recipe before and I lost it! this is the best pumpkin pie recipe I have ever tasted in my life and I am a huge pumpkin fan! I am so happy to see that I could find it at allrecipe.com the best flavor comes from using a real fresh carved pumpkin! just cut up the meat of the pumpkin in cubes and boil in water just like potatoes till tender then you puree in blender. You will never again us canned pumpkin! enjoy!

Yum!!! Don't even bother spending the extra time to heat this stuff up as recommended by "jdc4him". I've made this both ways and it doesn't make any difference. This is a great pumpkin pie recipe as written.

don't forget to put foil around the crust before baking then take off foil 20 minutes before pie is done. If you don't put foil on the crust it will burn!

Only 4 stars because I feel it is lacking some spices. I use this recipe and always incease the ginger to 1 teaspoon, add in 1/2 teaspoon of allsprice and 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves. These changes make a world of difference. I throw all the ingredients into a stock pot and heat it over medium for about 5-10 minutes before pouring into the shells. This cuts baking time by about 15 minutes and saves your pie crust edges from getting burned!

WONDERFUL!  And SO easy!  I whipped this up in one bowl in 5 minutes and poured it into a store bought crust and in to the oven it went!  Some other reviews said they thought it wasn't sweet at all with out adding extra sugar. I found this to be VERY sweet with the use of the sweetened condensed milk, and believe me I am a sugar addict so I would add more sugar if necessary!  I suggest tasting a spoonful of the batter before adding extra sugar so it won't become too overwhelming. I did add an extra tsp of cinnamon and it was perfect!!!  Happy Thanksgiving to all you bakers out there!

This is one of the first pumpkin pies I ever made. It always comes together quickly and it never fails to turn out awesome. The only change I make is using 1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices.

Excellent pie. Got a tip from a pie cooking demonstration a couple of years ago to eliminate soggy pie.
Coat pie crust with egg white before filling, it will act as a barrier and pie crust won't be soggy.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I made one small change - instead of a pie crust, I combined 1/2 stick of unsalted butter (melted and cooled) with 3/4 C. graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 C. firmly packed light brown sugar, 1/4 C. granulated sugar and 1/2 C. finely chopped pecans. Press the mixture into the pie plate all the way up the sides and chill for 1 hour before adding the pumpkin filling. My husband loves the graham cracker crust better than the pie!

I have been making this pie for Thanksgiving for 12 years since my son's pre-school class made it and he began requesting it every year. Our recipe calls for 1 c. sugar (white or lt. brown) in addition to the sw. condensed milk and 1 tsp. vanilla. They freeze well too!

This is basically the recipe from the McCormick pumpkin pie spice label, except that they call for 1 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of all the individual spices. I've made it this way for a few years, and it always comes out great! Keep an eye on your crust (edges) so it doesn't get too brown, and always place your pie on a cookie sheet to bake--just in case of bubble-over.

Replaced spices with 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice and 1 teaspoon cinnamon.  Still wasn't too spicy.  Baked on preheated cookie sheet to help bottom crust crisp up. (Put cookie sheet in oven while preheating...took it out when ready to fill pie, then put pie plate with pie crust already in it on to sheet, and then poured in filling.)

#1 PROBLEM w/ this recipe = It wasn't sweet enough....

It's a good pie and a great start, but every pumpkin pie I've ever eaten has been sweet (go figure...it's a pie~).  This pie wasn't even close to as sweet as I think it should be.  Therefore, I recommend the pie (especially if you're cooking it for an older crowd) but if you like your PP sweet, or the crowd is a bit younger.... I'd definitely recommend adding a 1/4cup of light brown sugar and a 1/4 cup of white sugar to it (if you look at other PP recipes, most of them have 3/4 cup of sugar so even more would be okay).
Goodluck

This pie came out perfect, and so delicious.  As others have, I tweaked the spices, ommitting nutmeg, and adding ground cloves and pumpkin pie spice along with the cinnamon and ginger.
This recipe will go in the permanant box of recipes we use for our family.  It was wonderful and I highly reccomend it!

Perfect! I put 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice plus 1 Â½ tsp. ground cinnamon in place of the spice mixtures. I also added a 1/2 cup of light brown sugar to the pumpkin pie mix. I used, âGrandmaâs Secret Pie Crust,â from this site. I must mention this is a nice and flaky crust but not crumbly. The filling is smooth, creamy, rich- a perfect amount pumpkin pie filling with the right amount of spices. This was easy to prepare and nicely sweetened. I covered and protected the crust loosely with aluminum foil right before baking then remove it in 20 minutes before the pie was done! It was an outstanding flavor and the warm spices blended together nicely. I baked the pie at 425 degrees for 15 minutes, then lowered the temperature to 350 degrees for 35 minutes, then turned off the oven and let it sit for 5 minutes to let the pie cool down along with the oven. I let it chill for a while in the refrigerator before slicing. I topped it off with fresh homemade whipped topping. Using both the sweetened condensed milk and combination of spices was definitely a winner. The pie crust was also a hit! A wonderful way to end a huge Thanksgiving meal!

This recipe does not contain any sugar and was awful.  No one at Thanksgiving liked it and I ended up throwing the pie away. This should be labeled as a diabetic recipe.

Ok I have NEVER given a bad review in my life about any thing but, I have to with this. I have baking pumpkin pies for years now, 5 this week alone. I decided to try something new and do this recipe and it came out AWFUL!! The condensed milk is all I can taste in my pie!! way to strong for a pumpkin pie. If you can drink condensed milk out of the can and you like it. This is the recipe for you. If not DO NOT TRY this recipe it should be called condensed milk pie not Pumpkin pie.

This was the worst pumpkin pie I have ever made.  I make pumpkin pies every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas and decided to try a new recipe.  I was very sorry that I did.  I made two pies and decided to try one before Thanksgiving dinner and I was glad I did because after trying it I decided that I needed to make  another one using the recipe that I normally use.   I had made four pies this  pie, my original pumpkin pie, a pecan, & an apple.  Every pie was eaten except for this one.

Wonderfully easy to make. Although, I like my PP a little spicier, so I added 1 tsp clove, 1 tsp PP spice and increased the cinnamon and nutmeg to 1.5 tsp. This is my new fave!!!

Too much nutmeg, no clove, and no sugar - so it ended up tasting like gritty pumpkin flavored quiche.

The Libby's recipe on the pumpkin can is far better, I'm sticking with it, since it doesn't have that grit.

This is my third Thanksgiving, and the first where it's been just me and Husband. He said he wanted Pumpkin Pie, and I was a little nervous about making it because I had no idea what made a good recipe! I am very happy to say that I followed this recipe EXACTLY (VERY unusual for me!) and it turned out wonderfully. I was anxious that there wouldn't be enough filling for the 9 inch deep-dish crust, but it was absolutely spot-on. Husband ate half of the pie in a few hours. This will be the only recipe I use in the future. Thanks so much! And Happy Thanksgiving to all! :)

This really is a perfect Pumpkin Pie! I like to be able to taste the spices in my pumpkin pie so I 'toast' the spices a bit in a dry frying pan to release the oils. You have to measure a bit more for the spices as some get left behind in the frying pan. For the topping, I add 1/4 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to 2 cups of Cool Whip. It is quite nice.

My first pumpkin pie, it was excellent! Would have been better if I had all of the ingredients. Didn't have ginger so I took the advice of other people who rated this and added 1/4 tsp allspice, used 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and 3/4 tsp nutmeg. Next time I will try w/o the allspice.

My pie looked and tasted fantastic, my hubby had to try it even before the meal! I usually make a pumpkin cheesecake, since I never really liked plain pumpkin pie, but hubby requested one special for him, and while I did add a little ground cloves, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out beautifully!

Definitely Better Than Libby's Reccipe

I used to use a recipe with evaporated mil and sugar but this one has that beat by far. The textyre is creamier and I feared it wouldn't be sweet enough but it was perfect. I did add extra cinnamon and cut the nutmeg and ginger in 1/2 since we love cinnamon. I also added a drop of vanilla. I filled a Keebler graham crust and 3 mini crusts. They were yummy. My daughter took a mini to school and was the envy of classmates and  her teachers. This is the one I will use from now on.

Yummy!  I added fresh grated nutmeg and increased the other spices for a bit more kick.  I also used a gingersnap crust.  Just crush 1 1/2 C of gingersnap cookies and add cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, 6 T of melted butter and a bit of brown sugar if you like it sweet.  Pat this mixture into your pie plate and then the filling.  I topped it off with fresh whipped cream and a sprinkle of chopped pecans. Thanks for a great recipe I will use again!

The best pumpkin pie recipe ever! I tried it for the first time last Thanksgiving and my family and friends could not get enough of it. I followed the recommendation of heating the canned pumpkin, spices and salt in a medium saucepan over low heat to get the "canned" taste off.  Also, instead of a pie crust, I used a home made graham cracker crust with roasted chopped pecans... and OH MY! this pie is to die for!! try it, you won't regret it! Happy Holidays!! ;)

This is SOO Goo + so easy to make! I did however made one change, I replace the condensed milk with Nestle La Lechera Dulce De Leche-caramel condensed milk found in the Hispanic section of your grocery. Everyone loved it (: Try this making this easy + tasty pie, you will won't be disappointed?

My pie ended up looking store bought! Nobody believed me!  I used a sugar pumpkin that I bought at the pumpkin patch instead of canned pumpkin.  It was easier to prepare than I thought and the kids loved preparing it. Remove stem, cut the pumpkin in half & discard the seeds and stringy pulp. Brush some oil onto the edges and place face down in a roasting pan. Add 1 cup of water and bake at 350 for 60-90 mins until tender (test with a fork). Once the baked pumpkin has cooled, scoop out the flesh and puree or mash it.  Line a sieve or colander with 2 coffee filters and let puree drain for at least 2 hours or overnight.  If the recipe calls for a 15oz can of pumpkin, that is equal to 1 3/4 cup of puree.  I got a little more than 2 cups of puree out of a normal size sugar pumpkin (not enough for 2 pies).

WOW! The best Pumpkin Pie recipe EVER, hands down! I followed some other reviewerâs suggestions for a more perfect pie: I pre-baked the crust while the oven was pre-heating; I heated up the canned pumpkin, spices and salt in a medium sauce pan over low heat, and also added 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves. After I let that cool a little I added the condensed milk and eggs and whipped 'til smooth. What a great treat. Will make again and again!

This really is perfect and couldn't have been easier to make! I was a little worried that I'd screwed it up by using pumpkin that had been frozen; it defrosted kind of grainy and clumpy and I had trouble getting the filling mixture smooth. It evened out in baking though and the texture was great in the final product. I used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual spices but added a little extra cinnamon as well. I used Grandma's Secret Pie Crust for the crust, it's my fave pie crust recipe, highly recommend it! Served with homemade whipped cream lightly sweetened with vanilla sugar.

This was my first time making pumpkin pie. I was a bit nervous about letting my boyfriend try it--he had had pumpkin pie for the first time the night before and was NOT a fan...anyway, when he took the first bite, his eyes lit up and he gobbled the entire slice and asked for seconds, than thirds! He said it rivaled any dessert he had at Cheesecake Factory =) I omitted the ginger and nutmeg and used McCormick's pumpkin spice as per other reviews. Delishhh!

This recipe is the best. To those who said you need to add sugar,you are probably using evaporated milk. The sugar is in the Borden's so no additional sugar is necessary.

This one is so great! Super easy and no weird ingredients. I've been using this recipe for about 4 years. This year I added about 1.5 tsp of Vanilla as well and it was even more perfect. I used it with a graham cracker crush this year and it was great. Serve cold with whipped cream and pumpkin pie spice.

a good easy quick STANDARD pumpkin pie -  BUT the best EVER that people who don't even LIKE/Can't Stand pumpkin pie like -  is from the NY Times Cookbook and has sour cream and whipped egg whites incorporated in the filling - which gives a mousse texture rather than the custard texture - and almost EVERYone loves it -   it's more work than this - and worth it -  Ina Garten/the Barefoot Contessa has a FABULOUS, The Best Ever pumpkin mousse with grated orange rind, whipped egg whites that is a LOT of ingredients and a LOT of work but it is To Die For - if you have the time -

I have made this pie many times now. These pies are devoured by all who try them. I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of the pumpkin. I used FRESH ROASTED PUMPKIN and pressed the mixture through a sieve before adding it to the pie pan. the roasted pumpkin recipe is here at this site also. It couldn't be easier and is so worth it. Cut a pie pumpkin (small ones) in half. Scoop out the goo. Lay face down on cookie sheet. Cover with foil. Bake for 60 to 90 minutes at 375. cool completely. Cut away any dark brown bits. Pumpkin is done when it can be scooped easily from shells. Puree in blender before adding other ingredients. You will never go back to the can. I also read somewhere that most canned pumpkin is actually 82% butternut squash.

Great pumpkin pie! I had doubled the spices, as some said they would at least double them.. but the spices were way too overpowering. I would make this again, but follow the recipe exactly. Adding more spices made it way too spicy! Also, I had bought a 9" frozen ready to bake crust.. and the pie crust was just not deep enough to hold all the pumpkin filling. I would recommend buying a deep dish crust for this.

I accidentally used a 20 oz. can of pumpkin, but I would definitely do that again.  It turned out so big and fluffy - my family loved it.  The pie was SO deep.  Also I used a bit more of each of the spices - about double.

2006: I made this and was thrilled by how easy it was.  I made it using 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and a couple dashes each of allspice and cardamom.  My husband's been asking when I'll make more!

2019 update: always find I have too much filling for a standard pie crust and bake the rest as a stand-alone pudding.  Perhaps I'll cut back a bit on the recipe in the future.

This is by far the easiest pumpkin pie to prepare and excellent taste!  I have made this for years, if you like your pumpkin pie spicier, I add a teaspoon of allspice along with the other spices.

This was the first pie I've ever made and I'd say it was a sucess considering my boyfriend went back for seconds, then thirds and then fourths! 

I used fresh japanese pumpkins which are nice and sweet. I cooked them by cutting them up into small chunks without the skin, placed them into a freezer bag and then cooked them in the microwave for 10 minutes. They came out nice and soft so it was really easy puree in the food processor.

Yummy with a capital Y!!!!! This is a wonderful version of pumpkin pie and much easier than the old evaporated milk recipe.  I made two pies for t-day and two for Christmas and received rave reviews both times.  The only change that I made was to add 2t of pumpkin pie spice in place of the other spices.  Very simple that way and just as good.  I'm already looking forward to next year's holidays and making this again!

This recipe turned out PERFECT!!! I went through and took bits of advice from many reviewers.I used real pumpkin that had been purred. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used 2tsp of all-spice and 2 tsp of cinnamon. I also added some vanilla (I never measure out vanilla). I used a ready made graham crust which was the perfect thickness and complimented the pie perfectly. I took others advice on cooking times and baked for 15 mins at 425F and then 35 mins at 350F then I left it in the oven after turning it off for 5 mins. This pie was better than any store bought pie, probably better than any pie, I have EVER tasted! I LOVED this pie and will definitly make it again...soon!

Delicious! I was so excited to find a recipe that called for condensed instead of evaporated milk because I only had a can of evaporated. I also used a really easy graham cracker crust recipe from this site instead of a pre-made because I had some graham crackers and couldn't go to the store. Delightful!

Gotta say... Only made Pumpkin Pie for the others. Dh and I do not USUALLY like it. But, this ONE changed our lives, in the pie world that is! We all loved it! It was the first pie gone after our annual holiday meal. Didn't last an hour! Making it again for this Christmas. Two of them infact! I did buy today pumpkin spice to try this time around( as others suggested). I know it will only add to it. Thank you!

I have been making this recipe for years rave reviews. I make a few minor modifications by way of increasing the cinnamon and ginger. I also mix in a little cinnamon and sugar to the dry crust ingredients to liven up the crust a bit. Also, for those of you who were complaining of a soggy crust bottom, you may want to try a trick my Grandma taught me years ago: after placing your uncooked pie crust in the pan, trim and flute the edge. Then take a dinner or salad fork and place multiple fork pricks all around the side and bottom of pan. It comes out perfectly done and if you have not over handled it, perfectly flaky every time.

I changed the recipe up a little.  I made my own pumpkin puree and I added about 1 tsp of vanilla.  I also used 2/3 condensed milk and 1/3 low fat milk.  I'm going to try to reduce the condensed to make it a little lighter but didn't want to attempt it the first time. Everyone loved my pies - I also made mini pies with this recipe.

this is the best pumpkin pie ever. it was easy to make and my kids love it. i ended up having to make two this weekend. i cut the salt to 1/4 teaspoon, baked the crust about 6 minutes so it wasnt soggy, and added a dash of pumpkin pie spice to the mix. i will be making this again at thanksgiving.

I cooked up a few pie pumpkins last week and was wanting to test a recipe before Thanksgiving so I decided to give this one a try.  I used a homemade graham cracker crust and the fresh pumpkin puree and it turned out quite yummy.  I didn't want to burn the crust so I only heated to 400 to start and it came out just fine and the filling was set after the additional 35 minutes at 350.  The pie was rather heavy on the ginger and I'll probably cut that in about half the next time I make this.  Otherwise, a great recipe and I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe is "tried and true," as my mom would say.  Last year I decided to try something different and made a graham cracker-style crust, but with food-processed ginger snaps.  BEST PIE EVER!!

This pie turned out GREAT! It was very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly as stated the first time I made it. I thought that there needed to be a little more cinnamon so the second time around I added a pinch more cinnamon and that seemed to do the trick. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

The texture of this pie was lovely and it was incredibly easy to make. I don't much care for pumpkin pie so I don't know if this is an especially good one (US-born hubby said it was) but as a "non-pumpkin pie eater", I thought it tasted pretty good and even had a second slice.

It does NOT get easier than this.  Whisk it up, pour it in and bake it.  Great, great, great!  (And even better the next day, if that's possible!)  I used with Best Ever Pie Crust and 2 cups of real pumpkin.

This will now be the only pumpkin pie recipe I will use.  The filling was a lot thicker than some of the other recipes I've tried, which made it much easier to get it in the oven without making a mess.  And it tasted great too.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving this year since every year my family ends up running out of time and rushing to the store to by a pie.  This time I told them I would just make one.  I personally don't like pie in general, but several people that do told me it was great!  Also, for those of you who don't know this trick yet when making pies....when you have to cover the edge to keep it from burning, the easiest way is to actually cut a circle out of tin foil (use your pan to measure before filling it with pie filling).  You want it about an inch wide and then you can just slip it off and on!  No more strips to mess with!  Just a tip when you're baking this holiday!

I made this for a pot luck, and frankly, the other store bought pumpkin pies people brought were better.  As written it's bland. Extra 1/2 t. cinnamon, 1/2 t. allspice and 1 scant T sugar make it SO MUCH BETTER!

I've tried TONS of pumpkin pie recipes, ranging from Libby's to one's using coconut milk & cardamom, but they were never quite right, even with tweaks to the recipes. I wanted a custardy, smooth as silk, light textured pie, and I FINALLY have that in this recipe, with a couple changes. The first time I made this, exactly to the directions, it was tasty, but heavy.

Some tweaks I highly encourage: I doubled the recipe (for two pies), added an extra egg (for more lightness & more custardy texture), doubled the spices b/c we like lots of flavor, added some fresh ginger (maybe 1/4 tsp), and ground cloves. Then we carefully monitored the baking & made sure not to overbake it. Amazing pie, equally as good as my MIL's (the pie we compare all pumpkin pies to)!

Really the best recipe ever! I have been complimented many times to make this over and over. Very simple.. followed the recipe as followed and it turned out great! Also, this was my first time making a pie and it was perfect. Tweaked the nutmeg and cinnamon combination a bit to my liking.

First of all I added no salt what so ever and added less nutmeg (didn't want the spicy taste) and a hint of vanilla extract with a wee bit of cinnamon and it came out perfect!

This pie was extremely creamy. I used a blue hubbard squash from my garden in this recipe. I'm surprised at all of the rave reviews for this recipe after trying it myself.  The condensed milk was so sickeningly sweet, that it is all you taste in this recipe. I added 1/4 tsp clove and allspice to this , and thankfully it came out tastier than i think it would have, had i not. I think people who rate this a 5 don't really know what a real pumpkin pie should taste like. This pie recipe lacks spice and proper flavor, and is just way to sweet. If i were to make this again, i would only use half of the recommended sweetened condensed milk.

....this was not very good at all. If you like sweet pumpkin pies, this is NOT the pie for you. I guess it could be okay if you don't want a sweet pie, but we found it very bland.

Followed the recipe exactly, turned out sooo good!! I've made this pie a few times  now and everyone always raves about it. The texture and taste are to die for. I could definitely eat a whole pie to myself.

I love this pie!  It's so easy and turns out perfect every time.  It's pretty mild, and we like that it doesn't have cloves or allspice in it--those can be overpowering in a lot of pumpkin pie recipes.

Fool proof recipe.  You can't screw this one up!  This has been the same recipe used in our family since I was a kid.  We change up the spice mixture to our liking.  Delish!  Don't forget the whipped cream!

I was expecting something with more of a pumpkin flavor. It was good, just not as good as I wanted it to be. I also think that it could use more spice to it.

Made this for Thanksgiving--Never made a homemade pumpkin pie before, and this was really simple!  I even made a crust from scratch (shortening free recipe):  1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for rolling 1 cup (1 stick or 4 oz) unsalted butter, very-cold, cut into 1/2 inch cubes 1/2 tsp salt 1/2 tsp sugar 2 to 4 Tbsp ice water Cut butter into 1/2" cubes freeze for 15-60 min. (the longer the better). Combine flour, salt, & sugar in a food processor. Add butter & pulse 5-10 times, until mix resembles coarse meal, with pea size pieces of butter. Add ice water 1 Tbsp at a time, pulsing until mixture just begins to clump together. If you pinch some of the crumbly dough and it holds together, it's ready.  Place dough in a mound on a clean surface.  Knead the dough just enough to form into a 3/4"-1" thick disc; do not over-knead. You should be able to see little bits of butter in the dough--those are what will allow the resulting crust to be flaky. Sprinkle a little flour around the disc and wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour, and up to 2 days. Remove disc from fridge and let it sit at room temp. for 5-10 min. Roll out with a rolling pin on a lightly floured surface to a 12-inch circle; about 1/8 of an inch thick.  Carefully place onto a 9-inch pie plate. Gently press the pie dough down so that it lines the bottom and sides of the pie plate.  Trim excess dough with kitchen scissors along edge of the pie dish. Fill with pumpkin filling & bake!

This is so easy and affordable to make!  I grew up eating sweet potato pie and my boyfriend really likes pumpkin pie - I never made pumpkin pie before today and he LOVES it! This beats out a store bought pie any day!  I read several reviews and decided to add extra cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of allspice, and about 2 Tbsp of brown sugar.  I warmed the pumpkin and the spices first and I used a graham cracker crust. I turned off the heat and opened the oven door after it finished baking to let the pie slowly cool in the oven so it doesn't crack on the counter.

Awesome recipe.  I used to never make my own pumpkin pie (just got store bought). No more store bought for me...I am now an offical pumpkin pie snob! =) I did follow suggestions from several reviews, so here are the changes I made: 1) I heated the pumpkin with the spices; 2) I added brown sugar to the heating pumpkin as well (1/4 cup); 3) Added 1 tsp. vanilla to cooled pumpkin; 4) baked for 10 minutes less than directed, turned off heat and let sit in oven for about 20 minutes (top never cracked...looked picture perfect!).  Thanks!

This is definitely a Thanksgiving tradition. I used 1 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. Top with whipped cream or cool whip - simple and delicious.

This was a good and easy recipe, I used a regular sized pie crust probably would have been better to use a deep dish or a larger size pie crust.  My family really liked this.

Very simple!  I did go ahead and use fresh pumpkin instead of canned, but the ease of using sweetened condensed milk was fabulous.  It came out so light and with the perfect blend of spices!  Definitely a holiday keeper.

Both tastes and looks fantastic.  It is actually 'pretty', and slices wonderfully.  Nice and firm, good texture, not too pumpkin-y or sweet.  I almost didn't manage to bake the pie at all because the batter tasted so good that my family members kept stealing spoonfuls when my back was turned.

This is SUPER easy to make and comes out great! I followed the directions exactly and it tasted wonderful. I'm not sure why some people think it's "bland". 

The spices were perfect. The only thing was that it had a little sweeter taste than I would have liked, but I guess that's to be expected with the condensed milk. I might use a little less next time. 

I will definitely make this again. I'd also use a deep dish pie crust because I had some filling left over when I used a regular crust.

As written a 3 with the changes I made to it it was a 4 1/2. I added a lot more spices, and I added some brown sugar ( I do love the creamy texture of the condensed milk) and I also added vanilla extract to it. I made this recipe into pumpkin tarts and I used the (cream cheese tart shells) on this site. That recipe saved this recipe(Cream cheese how can you go wrong?). Now that I have given this a test run I now know what to do with it for the holidays, happy cooking cooks.

This is my first pie, and I can't believe how easy it was!!  Took less than five minutes to prepare and thought I didn't eat any myself, my family loved it and said it was perfect, not too sweet and had good texture.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

Awesome pumpkin pie - I used fresh pumpkin, but followed the recipe exactly from there. I've always made the recipes that called for evaporated milk, but figured I would give this a try - it was so much better. It looked, held together, and tasted GREAT, way better than my usual recipes (from the evaporated milk cans). I HIGHLY recommend giving this a shot!

Let me first say that I am not a big pumpkin pie fan and I liked this recipe better than anyone else who tried it.  ~~  We had 10 people over for Thanksgiving and I made 4 desserts; pumpkin pie, pecan pie, apricot cake, and cheesecake.  Not one of our guests touched the pumpkin pie and went straight for the other desserts. My husband (who adores pumpkin pie) finally had some last night and he did not care for it.  He said it was okay, the one I made last year was better (Libby's recipe) and that there wasn't much pumpkin flavor.  My mother on the other hand said it tasted too bland, just like pumpkin from a can! I personally liked the texture of this one and may try to add more spices and maybe use canned pumpkin pie filling.

The name doesn't lie.  Perfect it is.  The only questionable area is in the crust.  I used a frozen (thawed it first) 9 inch.  I should have baked it slightly before adding the "stuff"  The bottom was too soft and I had to put foil on the top to keep from burning, but still no complaints here.  This is the rich, moist, flavorful pie you never thought you could make.  Really!

Love this recipe. Instead of the pumpkin I used oven roasted butternut squash and added 1/4 cup raw sugar. Also substituted spices for pumpkin spice. I think I prefer the ginger, allspice and cinnamon  for my spices.

Followed the recipe to the T. The seasoning in this pie is off. And, the biggest flaw is leaving out sugar. How can you leave out sugar when you are using canned unsweetened pumkin and the condensed milks sweetness is not enough.  Do NOT waste your ingredients on this recipe.

I made this yesterday with a couple of modifications, it was delicious!  I used a 796ml can of pumpkin puree to make 2 pies.  I added 3 eggs and one can of low fat condensed milk (that's what I had).  I warmed the puree first as per others suggestions, and used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and a bit of cinnamon, rather than what the recipe called for. I also baked the pie crust for 6 mins before adding the filling.  My pies turned out wonderful!  Perfectly sweet and light.  I will definitely use regular fat condensed milk next time to compare.

This recipe leaves out the sugar!!  It's an easy recipe if you know that you need to add 3/4 cup. My 10 year old made this recipe all by herself. d.  I ended up making a late night trip to the store at 10:30 pm in order to help her remake it the right way.

YOU GOTTA TRY THIS ALTERATION:
I used the Nestle' brand Dulce de Leche (caramel) Evaporated Milk instead of the regular white evaporated milk. 

OMG! It was fantastic and imparted a deeper flavor to the pie! You'll definitely have to stop yourself from eating it right out of the can!

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and will make it again this year and every every year! This is by far one of the best recipes for Pumpkin Pie ever! I think the use of the sweetened condensed milk is KEY for this pie. I also add extra cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger to taste.

Give this five stars although I did make modifications or shall I say substitutions.

First, I used two cups of steamed mashed fresh pumpkin equivalent to 425 grams. 
Second, I used a different brand of sweetened condensed milk. 
Aside from that, I followed everything else and it was just perfect!

I loved this pie! It was my first pumpkin pie ever and it turned out perfectly. It's important to let it cool in the oven (I opened the door so it cooled quicker) so that it doesn't crack. Overall this is a great recipe!

I used this recipe the other day to make my frist pumpkin pie.  I choose it because it looked really simple.  The pies looked amazing when I pulled them out of the oven, yet when I tried a slice it was really bland, and it was not sweet at all.  This was the worst pie recipe I have gotten off of this site. This recipes name is misleading and I would not recommend it to anyone.

I made 2 pies this year.  This one and the Traditional Libby's recipe.  This recipe was ok and will do in a pinch even with the 1/4 teaspoon of cloves that I added but the flavour of the recipe for Libby's in my opinion was just better...

Pretty good.  I like using sweetened condensed milk, in place of sugar and evaporated milk.  For our taste, I increased spices a little  and  added 1/4 tsp cloves.

This is the best! I've been making this super easy recipe for years and just pulled one out of the oven this minute. It is perfect! I have been wanting to use fresh cooked pumpkin for a pie, and when I do--this is the recipe I am going to use. Yummy!!!

It was ok, we made 2 of them and they turned out a little different. UPDATE: Made this again, it was so good. It took much longer in the oven. I think it depends on a pumpkin. This time I used a different pumpkin, that was a little liquidy. So I should have drain the pumpkin pure.

I like this recipe which uses the sweetened condensed milk in place of milk and sugar. It seems a little light in color-but maybe that was my fresh pumpkin... It sure is easy though, and set up beautifully! p.s. I had only powdered eggs in the house- 1 tablespoon plus 1/4 cup water makes 1 egg. I wasn't sure if it would work in a pie-it did, and very well (we could not tell the difference).

I have never eaten Pumpkin Pie before (not an 'Irish' thing and very hard to get pumpkin except at Halloween) but gosh was this pie simply amazing!!!  So good I went out and bought another 2 pumpkins (I used fresh and just pureed as we would never get the tinned variety here - it wasn't stringy at all) and made another 2 pies and froze them because having to wait another year to make this again wasn't an option!!  Simply brilliant, couldn't recommend more.  I followed recipe exactly except I cooked the base slightly first before adding the filling. 10 out of 10 for this one!!!

o what deliciousness!!! this is the pumpkin pie recipe you have been searching for.  the traditional "libby's" recipe has always left something to be desired, both in flavor and texture.  but this is it - smooth and creamy, rich, perfect amount of spice.  not to mention it is ridiculously easy to throw together - its in the oven in less than 10 minutes.  don't mess with perfection!

Sorry but this was a mediocre pie.  The pie was too heavy with the condensed milk.  I don't agree that lack of sweetness was an issue as other poor rating say.  One of the reasons I love pumpkin pie is for its light, cool, creaminess and this pie was nowhere near light.  Libby's is better, though it could still use a slight tweaking too.

I'm not a big fan of traditional pumpkin pie because they are too dense and heavy.  This recipe makes a thick but creamy pie.  Very easy, and very good flavor.

This really is the perfect pumpkin pie!  Use the large graham cracher crust.  It's so yummy you won't even need a whipped topping!

This is the recipe I always use.  I did add an extra egg to it this year, and it seemed to make the pie alot more firm, which I prefer.  I can't stand a pumpkin pie that is mushy.  This worked perfectly.

Just made 2 of these pies, the only thing I did different was use pumpkin pie spice instead of the listed items.  There was a slight skin on the top, the inside is light, fluffy and creamy.  Yes they are a bit sweet but they are still very good.

This is a simple recipe which yields a very tasty result.  The spice mix is well balanced, producing what I consider to be the traditional flavors of pumpkin pie.  The custard produced was excellent- slightly firm, but not tough.  I did pre-bake the pie crust for 5 minutes.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written.

This is an excellent recipe for children to make, with supervision.  My two boys, 9 and 11, have been in charge of making this pie for about 2 years now.  We always use a graham cracker crust.  Turns out delicious.

This recipe was great, I have made this twice, once with 2 9" regular pie crusts, and once with a 9" deep dish pie crust. The deep dish definitely worked a lot better! I've tried many different recipes from this site, this is the easiest and the best taste wise.

This really is perfect pumpkin pie! I made it for our Thanksgiving "feast" in our classroom and it was a HUGE hit! The only tweak I made was to add 3/4 tsp of vanilla extract, primarily because I'm convinced that everything tastes better with vanilla extract... I also recommend baking it for exactly 37 minutes on the second temp. It was perfect. We ate it warm with cinnamon whipped cream. OMG it was good.

I have always been a fan of the Libby's pumpkin pie recipe, but I live in Japan, and the evaporated milk that the recipe and just about all pumpkin pie recipes call for is pretty hard to find here.  They do have sweetened condensed milk in all the supermarkets however, so that is why this recipe appealed to me.  I used kabocha (Japanese pumpkin) instead of the canned pumpkin.  My kabocha was 2 lbs and produced about 2 cups of puree. I also added 1/4 tsp cloves, and I baked the pie in a ready made graham cracker crust.  It turned out great!  I will definitely make this a few more times while kabocha is still in season.

This pumpkin pie isn't as thick as I'm used to. In fact, it's more like pumpkin "mousse." However, the flavor is absolutely outstanding!!! I always double the amount of cinnamon because I like the extra warmth it gives off. The ginger gives it that perfect amount of spiciness that everyone notices but no one can guess what it is. No need for pumpkin spice here! To prevent it from cracking, I always cool my pie in the oven with the door open - this is very important! Serve with whip cream, and everyone will be begging for more!

Oh wow!! This is the ONLY pumpkin pie recipe I use! I had never tried pumpkin pie before, so I decided to try this recipe. I used another person's suggestion and used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 2 tsp cinnamon, but that's all I changed. I place a baking sheet in the oven while it's preheating, so by the time I place the pie on the sheet, it's hot enough to cook the bottom of the crust evenly. This is absolutely delicious!!

This is a great recipe.  I heated the pumpkin, spices and salt, let cool, then added the milk as someone suggested in a previous review and  I also cooked the pie crust for 7 minutes before putting the "stuff" in and the pie turned out perfect!

I rate this recipe 5-stars for how easy it was to make.  I don't eat pumpkin pie, but my family rates this 5-stars for great taste/consistency.  In fact, after my husband tried this pie, he turned into a pumpkin pie snob!  I've never seen him turn down *any* pumpkin pie, but he let a store-bought pumpkin pie turn into a shriveled lump in our fridge; he refused to eat it.  I guess this was a good pie!  UPDATE (2008/12/31): I made this again for Xmas, and since my mom hinted later, after Thanksgiving, that it wasn't as sweet as she was expecting, I followed a user review suggestion and added 1/4 c. brown sugar to the pumpkin and heated it with the spices.  She RAVED, so I think I'll keep the brown sugar addition.

Libby no more...this is amazing.  My husband and I both agree that this is the best pumpkin pie we have ever had.  I precooked the crust for eight minutes and it was perfect in the end.  WOW!  We loved the spiciness.

This recipe is delicious! I made these last year, and they didn't last.  I did add a tsp of vanilla and use the pumpkin pie spice. I left out the ginger b/c I like my pies more on the sweet side, rather than spicy.  This year I might try adding brown sugar too.  This recipe is a keeper and I will use this for years to come!

This was a winner with my family.  We don't have tinned pumpkin in South Africa so I cooked Butternut and processed the pulp.  Some of my family are not partial to pumpkin but this pumpkin pie had them all asking for more.

The mixture was too much for one 9" pie crust, so I froze the leftovers.  Good and rich recipe.

I substituted Keebler's Graham Cracker Ready Crust instead of regular pie crust. Served with Cool Whip. Seriously the best pumpkin pie I've ever had.

I will never buy another frozen pumpkin pie again!  Based on the suggestions of prior reviewers, I used 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice plus one teaspoon of cinnamon.  Before filling the crust, I also brushed with egg white mixed with a little water to prevent sogginess.  This will be a new tradition in our home.

Perfectly perfect! Why have I been making the pie on the back of the Libby's can all these years???? This is the best, I will never make anything different. My 9-year-old has been breaking his poor mother's heart all these years by declaring that he doesn't like pumpkin pie... and what do you know? He tried this. He loved it. He had two pieces and another the next morning for breakfast. My life is complete.

I made two pies, one the way I usually do (with evaporated milk and sugar instead of the condensed milk)and this one.  I totally expected this recipe to taste the best, considering all the favorable reviews.  I was really surprised when the traditional recipe tasted WAY better than this recipe.  It was much smoother, better texture and better flavor. One thing this recipe is lacking is cloves, which I think really gives pumpkin pie a good flavor.  It wasn't just me, though.  I gave 6 people pieces of each and EVERYONE thought the traditional pie was much better. Very disappointed in this recipe.

I cut the pie crust into little circles, so they would fit into a mini muffin pan. I used Pumpkin Poie Spice like someone else suggested. The mini-pumpkin pies were a BIG BIG hit!!

I was really excited about trying this pie with all the positive reviews but I was honestly a little disappointed with the results! It was tasty, don't get me wrong - it did get eaten! But I thought it was quite bland. Not sugary, which I knew it wouldn't be, but it really did need more spice - pumpkin pie spice or extra cinnamon or something. I do wish I had taken more of the reviews to heart and added more spices to my pie. The texture is very nice, it's very smooth. But it was just lacking... something. I'll definitely make it again but next time with MORE spices!

This was so easy to make...and there was a suggestion of heating the pumpkin, spices, and salt before mixing the milk and eggs was an excellent suggestion. It really does help take away the "canned pumpkin" taste. This was my 2nd ever pie to make and it was so easy. The length of baking did cause burning edges on the pie, so I just covered in aluminum foil and it came out just perfect!

I wanted to try this right before Thanksgiving, and I am glad I did. It did come out very firm and dense. No complaints there, however I agree with some in regards to it not being a tad bit sweeter. Next time adding some sugar along with some brown sugar. It was not grainy at all. It seemed though every once in a while you would get a bite full of spices, but that is probably due to not having enough sweetness to balance it out. I am going to try it again one of these days.

Wonderful "classic" pumpkin pie recipe. Everyone loved it. It does need more spices for my taste but 5 stars for ease alone. Took me all of 3 minutes to mix the filling. This would be a great first time pie for new pie bakers!

This Pumpkin Pie was awesome!  I used a Ready-made graham crust as many have suggested.  Make sure to cook it the full time.  My first pie looked a little brown so I cooked the second pie for 10 minutes less.  It turned out the first pie was perfect and the second pie was runny.  It's not gonna burn so cook it the full time!!

Good standard pumkin pie recipe. I have a convection oven and baked it at 425 for only 10 minutes instead of 15 then I turned the oven to 350 coverd the edges of the crust with foil to keep it from overbrowning then  baked for 25 minutes instead of the standard 35 to 40. I used a homade crust. I grated 2/3 of a teaspoon of fresh nutmeg and used 1 1/3 teaspoons of cinnamon This pie had more volume and set up with a more dense texture than most Pumkin Pie recipes it is quick and easy.

I do not like pumpkin pie because I do not like the spicy taste of them.  I prefer sweet potato pie instead. I made this pie for one of my customers and they loved it. So I am giving it a 5 because of my customers. The only thing I did different was to make my crust from scratch and I sprinkled powder sugar befor serving.

Really nice once it was allowed to cool completely!  We were eager to try it so cut it while still warm and personally I found it too sweet and not spicy enough - but by the next day it was absolutely delicious, and the spice flavor had developed fully.

I was a little hesitant to try this recipe, I've always used the traditional evaporated milk.  This pie was amazing, and a little less sweet than what I've had before.  I did stick the crust in the oven as it was preheated as suggested in previous reviews to prevent sogginess.

If "perfect" means "the pie you remember mom making" this is it. It is the traditional pumpkin pie. Very easy to make and the pumpkin pie eaters at our Thanksgiving said it was good. I used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and I think the seasoning was just right that way. The reviewers who said they had to add extra spices to suit their tastes must like their pie *really* spicy (or maybe their spices aren't fresh?).

My family loved it!  I made a pie exactly like the recipe. Next I made 2 pies filled only half way(one recipe worth), cooled them and then topped them off with no-bake cheesecake, for Thanksgiving, but the family already ate them and asked me to make more.

If you're going to go to the trouble of making a pie in the first place, why this one? You might as well buy one already made at the store. I found the texture was nice, but everything else was pretty bland.

Good!  Used slightly less condensed milk so it wouldn't be too sweet.  Also I used 2 tsps of pumpkin pie spice.  Would definitely make again!

This was the first pumpkin pie I've ever made but everyone at the party thought that it came out very good.  As per other's advice, I upped the spices.  In addition to the recommended spices, I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves and also cardamom, plus a little more cinnamon than was recommended.

It was tasty, but not all that special. Seemed to have kind of an earthy taste... possibly not enough sweetness?

I made this pie using the low fat sweetened condensed milk. I also baked a regular pumpkin pie using evaporated milk. The regular pie was good; this pie was outstanding. I was baking them the day before Thanksgiving at lunchtime. The kids were home from high school and college and begged for a slice, warm out of the oven. Even my son who isn't a huge pumpkin pie fan took a big piece. There wasn't any of this one left for the next day! I really liked the idea of not having to add additional sugar to it. I did add a bit more pie spice as suggested. It's a new favorite now.

Condensed milk does the trick. I'd never heard of using it before, but this recipe yielded the smoothest, most uniform pie I've ever seen. Tastes great as well. I used 1.5 tsp cinnamon and 1.5 tsp allspice, which is what I usually use and it came out perfect.

For someone who doesn't really like pumpkin, this pie was awesome! I didn't have any ginger, so I put in an extra half teas of nutmeg. I also chilled the batter for a half hour before pouring it in the shell. I would recommend baking the shell (i used graham cracker) prior to putting in the batter.

Nice thick creamy texture pie.
I didn't have nutmeg, so I added about 1/4 tsp. cloves. and I upped the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp.
Also my crust started to brown a little to much so next time I will foil the edges. 
My family loved the pie. I thought it was alright... better than other recipes I've tried. But I had a slice after it was chilled in the fridge overnight, and now I think this is a keeper recipe. Next time I'll also add more cinnamon and perhaps pumpkin pie spice. =)

Instead of the pumpkin I use 8 Granny Smith apples, and instead of the sweetened condensed milk I use Â¼ cup of water. I leave off the eggs and instead use  Â½ cup of butter and 3 tablespoons of all-purpose flour.  I substitute the nutmeg for Â½ cup of white sugar and Â½ cup of brown sugar. My husband loves this and he doesnât usually like pumpkin pie.  ;)

This is such an easy and great recipe. I saw someone comment the suggestion of heating the pumpkin up in a saucepan with the spices to rid the pumpkin of that "can taste". Totally worked! While that mixture cooled in my freezer I prepared the crust. I also mixed the eggs and the sweetened condensed milk together before I mixed it in with the pumpkin/spice mixture. I added 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves. I opted to use pillsbury premade refrigerated crusts due to lack of food processor and time. My mom was kind enough to give me the tip to fold foil over the edges of the crust to avoid burning or overcooking.

Great! I did use 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice (instead of the ginger and nutmeg) and 1 tsp cinnamon. I also heated the pumpkin puree and spices first, then cooled and added milk and eggs after. Can make the filling and freeze, add to the crust later and bake.

As a pastry chef, this is a very good recipe.  Sure it is not my own, but it is good non the less.  To those that complained it was not sweet, or more like quiche, I am making an educated guess that you used condensed milk, not sweetened condensed milk, the two are not the same, and it does make a difference.  And you must use 100% pure pumpkin, not a can of pumpkin pie filling, again there is a difference. And as for spice, always make sure your spices are fresh, not a year old, spices do go stale and lose taste within a month of opening them and exposing them to air.  Hope my tips help.

Made this Recipe this afternoon.  It wasn't bad.  I think it was Missing something though.  I think next time I will Double the Cinnamon and Omit the Ginger.  Maybe add a little Sugar to sweeten it up a little.

It really tasted great before baking. During baking, a dome of skin bubbled up over the pie then sank back down on top. Very wrinkled looking skin on top. We haven't tried any yet, as it is for tomorrow

For all those negative reviewers out there that complain there is no sugar in the pie, that's what the sweetened condensed milk is for. No, this pie is not very sweet, it actually showcases pumpkin, not sugar. I will say I do tweak the recipe slightly, only because I like LOTS of spice in my pie. I double just about everything except the nutmeg and I add plenty of cloves, to me it just isn't pumpkin pie without cloves. For those who complained that the pie is grainy, you didn't beat the ingredients together thoroughly. Same with the people who said a skin formed on top. You really have to beat the heck out of this but when you do it's a great pie.

SWEETENED condensed milk, if you use the proper ingredients then the pie is perfectly sweet and delicious.  If you use evaporated milk it does lack sweetness.  Before you go bashing a recipe, make sure YOU are using the correct ingredients.

I'm a first-time pumpkin pies maker, and usually not very successful at baking. I found this recipe for pumpkin pie to be fool proof, even for baking dummies like me. I used fresh pumpkin puree instead of canned and didn't have sweetened condensed milk on hand, so I made a concoction of evap milk and sugar boiled on the stove top. This was the BEST pumpkin pie I've ever had in my life! Not bad at all for the first time! My family loved it and I am definitely going to use this recipe again!

Very tasty and easy recipe! Like many other reviewers, I suggest that you bake the pie crust before putting in the filling. I also warmed the pumpkin puree and used 2 tsp of pumpkin spice seasoning + 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of the original spices in the recipe. Highly recommended!

I doubled the amount of spice. I didn't have any condensed milk, so I added an extra 2 eggs, tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 cup brown sugar.

I'm not a fan of the usual pumpkin pie.  This one is a little sweeter and everyone in the family loved it.  Our kids, nieces and nephew (2-7 years old) all cleaned their plates.  I made it with a gluten-free graham cracker crust and topped it with rum whipped cream (for the parents of course).  I'll do that again!

I followed other reviews and cooked the pumpkin, salt and spices on low heat for a few minutes before adding the eggs and condensed milk. Instead of ginger and nutmeg, I used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, and I increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp. Prebaked my crust for 5 minutes, added filling and baked at 350 for 35 minutes. Once the edges were set and the middle jiggled slightly, I turned the oven off and let the pie cool with the door held open slightly with a wooden spoon. This prevents the top from cracking and gives the filling a silky texture. Served with homemade pumpkin spice whipped cream. Perfect!

Best pumpkin pie I've ever made!  I used a box of refrigerated pie crusts to make mini pies in a muffin pan.  I also reduced the spices just a tad.  Will be my go-to pumpkin pie recipe from now on. Will post photos.  Thanks for sharing.

The important thing is using condensed milk, not evaporated milk. This makes the smoothest, silkiest pie. As far as using fresh pumpkin - go for the canned with this pie! Fresh pumpkin makes a grainy, gray pie. This is one case where the easiest way is also the best way....

I made this pie for Thanksgiving. I followed the recipe for the filling exactly as is but used a graham cracker crust instead of a pie crust. Family and friends loved it. I will definitely make it again.

I just wanted to point this out- this recipe does not fill a deep-dish pie shell.  It is for a regular-sized pie.  I couldn't judge it, and I ended up filling my deep-dish pie shell and there's about 3/4" of crust to the top of the shell.  It's a nice pie anyway, very easy.  Just make sure you don't make the same mistake that I did.  I wouldn't mind so much if I wasn't taking it to Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow.  It's a little unsightly.

I use this recipe all the time but in stead of using the condensed milk I replace it with 14 ounces of eggnog. I find that you do have to bake it longer. But it is sooooooo good. Enjoy!

This is by far the best pumpkin pie recipe ever.  Very easy to make.  The only change I make is to use fresh pumpkin.  Once the pumpkin is cooked I let it sit over night and then drain about half the water.  It gives the pie a more creamy texture and isn't as heavy.  Wrap the pie in freezer paper and foil and the pie freezes well.  I have made this recipe for years and have received only rave reviews.

MMMM!  I never made pumpkin pie before. Like one other reviewer suggested, I pre-baked the (thawed) frozen crust for a few minutes before adding the filling, so as to be sure it cooked thoroughly.  I also reduced the cinnamon from a full teaspoon to a little over a half, because the one thing that always bugged me a little about pumpkin pie was the overwhelming cinnamon.  For me, this was just the thing because this is THE MOST delicious pumpkin pie I've ever had!

Always a hit! I've thoroughly impressed my mother-in-law with this recipe. I recommend covering the pie crust with a tin foil circle after the first 15 minutes (when the temperature is lowered) to keep your crust from getting too dark.

An absolutely FABULOUS pumpkin pie! It's the only recipe I've used since I discovered it back in 2001 or so. It is NOT a typical custard-type pumpkin pie, so it's very nontraditional there. But the pumpkin flavor comes through so very well, and it sets beautifully every time! I typically make 20 at Thanksgiving and Christmas; 3 for our family, plus 17 for my co-workers' tables, at their request! YUM!

This is the only pumpkin pie recipe I use. I do 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg to make an easy recipe even easier. This one is in my recipe box permanently! I am actually baking one right now!!!

I am an experienced home cook, however had never made a pumpkin pie.  Tried this using real pumpkin instead of canned and everyone went wild for it.

This was easier than going to the store and buying a pie.  Plus, it tastes much better and you get the kudos for making your own.  I change a few things, adding more cloves or nutmeg according to taste, and it always tastes great!

GREAT RECIPE! I did however follow someone elses advice and let the pumpkin and spices cook for a little bit on the stove first so the spices could all cook in together. THEN I added the condensed milk. Turned out GREAT! Usually my pie will start to pull away from the crust when refrigerated and this one didn't do that :)

This was a delicious and super easy pumpkin pie.  Everyone enjoyed it, and the flavors and cooking time were perfect.  I used a graham cracker crust which really complimented the pumpkin mixture.

This pie is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!  Oh my goodness!  I did what other reviewers suggested (2 tsp pumpkin spice and 2 tsp cinnamon instead of ginger and nutmeg...only because I needed my ginger for another dish).  I also prebaked my pie crust.  

I whipped the mixture for about 10 minutes in my mixer.  Made it really fluffy and heavenly.

PURELY awesome.

Made this version of pumpkin pie for my husband who absolutely loved it!!! He actually got up twice in the middle of the night to have more! I found this recipe in my Grandmother's recipe box from many, many years ago.  It is the same recipe on the Eagle can today... Good to know that it has remained the same over the years.

Hands down, the best pumpkin pie I've ever had!  I make it with the gingersnap crust from the "Gingersnap Pumpkin Pie" recipe on this site (adding an additional Tbl of butter to the crust, and omitting the sugar).  If using that crust, one tip is to pour the filling almost all the way to the edge, that way, not so much crust is showing (the molasses in the cookies makes the crust look burned, although it isn't).  Wow!  Thanks for the recipe!

I was anxious to try this because of all the high ratings. I thought it was very good, but it was just a little different than the traditional Libby's recipe I always bake. I decided to have a taste test with all of the family since I made both. The children and the grandchildren all had many comments, but in the end, Libby's traditional recipe, that's been on the side of the can for many, many years, won hands down. Eagle Brand is a wonderful product and I use it in much of my baking, and I love it. As far as the Thanksgiving Pumpkin Pie they all voted for pie marked "B" This was still a wonderful pie, so thank you Eagle Brand!

Mmmmmm, I don't think I'm ever going to even try another recipe for pumpkin pie. This was delicious and everybody kept asking for more although they were absolutely stuffed from our Thanksgiving feast =P I followed this recipe to the T except for adding a tad extra cinnamon and a pinch of ground all spice. I baked this at 218C for 15 minutes, and then at 175C for the next 33 minutes. I used Mauigirl's recipe of '$2000.00 Pie Crust Recipe', to make my pie crust. It's a fool proof recipe that compliments this pie very well. Thanks are also due to the reviewer who gave the tip on heating the canned puree before using it to avoid a tinny or canny taste.

This was a really good pie. However, like a lot of other bakers, I had to add more cinnamon and nutmeg. Also I added about two teaspoons of vanilla because I never bake without it. Poured into a home-made graham cracker crust and it was pretty flawless.

Pumpkin pie is too plain for me.  It needs something.  Perhaps I'll try a crumble topping for it.  I'm not a fan of cool whip.  One restaurant served a caramel sauce with their sweet potato casserole... Perhaps a marshmallow creme?

I have to say that I love LOVE love this pie. I substituted the can pumpkin for real pumpkins. I followed the rest of the recipe, and the results were amazing. This is going to be the ONLY pumpkin pie recipe at our table in years to come.

I had been using the same pumpkin pie recipe for years but this one will be replacing it. I followed the recipe as written but I used the fat free Eagle Brand condensed milk to save some calories.  It was absolutely delcious!  So simple and so so very delicous!

Easy and delicious! I used the 2 tsp pumpkin spice and 2 tsp cinnamon as some other reviewers suggested and the taste/texture was top notch. This will be my "go-to" pumpkin pie recipe from now on.

As written, the pie does not have nearly enough flavor. I tasted it before adding the eggs, and it was so... blah. SO, I added two additional teaspoons of cinnamon. The flavor was great. However, the pie was very DRY and almost gritty as if I had used ricotta cheese. Maybe that's because I used extra cinnamon? I honestly can't see 2 tsp of cinnamon absorbing THAT much moisture, though.

On the other hand, my boyfriend said it was the best pie he's ever had, but as a pumpkin pie lover and a seasoned baker, I will definitely not be making this again. I'll definitely be going back to the old sugar and evaporated milk recipe.

Made this for my first Thanksgiving outside the US. I don't like pumpkin pie that much but when you make it from scratch -no canned pumpkin- yum! This was a hit with all the guests too.

Perfect!  Somehow I got nominated to make all the pies for Thanksgiving today.  I did what I always so, which is check out all the recipes on Allrecipes.  I found this first thing....looked easy enough.  Then I followed a reviewer from 2007 who said to heat up the pumpkin and spices then let it cool before adding the Eagle Brand and eggs.....then cook.  I want to thank that person as well!  Pie was great!

Normally, when you bake the pie, the bottom is flat and not all done.  If you put a couple of weights and on the crust and then cook the crust, the bottom turns out to be just right.

I just made this recipe and it was delicious! Can't wait to share with the family for Thanksgiving! Love using the sweetened condensed milk instead of using the granulated sugar. I feel like it isn't so "grainy".. better texture. The only thing I changed was instead of using ginger, I used ground cloves. I like cloves in my pumpkin pie like I grew up with. ;)

I have been searching for this recipe for years!  I once tried baking this pie from a recipe I had on an EAGLE BRAND recipe booklet from a local grocery store.  It was the best pumpkin pie I had ever baked; I then lost the booklet...  Thanks for posting this recipe!

What a simple recipe!  I decreased the amount of condensed milk, used fresh pumpkin, used organic spices, and made a pie crust with oat flour.  It was a smash hit!

Always the best!  Perfect outcome every time for me.  The only thing I do differently is replace the spices with 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice.  Thanks for a recipe that has become a tradition in our family.

My boyfriend said this was the best pumpkin pie he's ever had.  I used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 2tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp salt instead of the spices called for in the recipe and used a ready made graham cracker crust.  It was delish and super easy! I would definitely make this again.

This is the pumpkin pie recipe I've been using for 20+ yrs, and it's never failed.  I would recommend slightly over -filling also.  I've never had to bake my crust before hand, but it may just be my crust recipe (?)  It's great having a traditional recipe that my family can look forward to ever fall/holiday!

My crust got a little burnt which was unfortunate because I didn't want to take the pie out early just to save the crust. Otherwise everything was delicious.

First time to make a pumpkin pie, it turned out great.  Made it for Christmas Dinner.  My Dads' favorite pie.  I had a cookie cut out of a Deer with horns and my Dad being an avid hunter really enjoyed the pie and the decoration.

This Pie recipe was a great hit, and the topper to our Thanksgiving Dinner.  It was delicious, and i had rave reviews and an empty pie plate.  Just like suggested I brought the canned pumpkin and spices up to heat in a sauce pan, let it cool before adding the eggs and then right into the oven. 
Very pleased and will use this again.

Light and fluffy!  Just delicious.  I added another 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg for that 'holiday' flavour, which made the pie truly perfect.

only four starts so far, because it didn't seem to have enough spice flavouring to it.  i baked it for much longer than listed because a knife or toothpick never came out of the centre cleanly, after a while i took it out anyway and the centre was creamy but not raw.  will try this one again with more spices. used Ruth's Grandma's pie crust recipe found here. nice and flaky but not crumbly

This is wonderful!  I brought pies last year to Thanksgiving and spent all Fall perfecting my apple pie.  Then made this pumpkin, too, and THIS is the one everyone raved about!  I really liked that it used sweetened condensed instead of evaporated milk.  I made my own pie crust because the butter makes a big difference (and I actually enjoy it - throwback from 7th grade home ec!), but other than that I followed it exactly.

I loved this!  I skipped the canned pumpkin and used fresh pumpkin puree (cook the pumkins in the oven @ 350 until they are soft enough to cut through, scrape and puree in a blender) and my favorite home-made pie crust; this was exactly what I was looking for!  I had a very traditional tasting pie.  I've already got requests to make this again once the fresh pumpkins are in season.

Yummy, will definitely make again! Reminder, check the size of the cans of puree you bought before starting the recipe. I had to run to the store to get more condensed milk once I realized I had doubled the recipe by using the bigger can of pumpkin. Haha.

I just finished making this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner (tomorrow). It's so easy and quick! Sets up beautifully! Smells luscious--and I don't even like pumpkin pie. I might actually taste this one!  :)

My husband said this is the best pumpkin pie I have ever made...and I've made quite a few! It's a great combination of pumpkin, spices, and sugar-not too much of any of the above. This is definitely a keeper!

I followed this to the T except for a few things. I added a bit more spices to taste and took the advice of another and covered the edges of the crust while I cooked half the pie then uncovered the last half for a nice crisp crust. The pie itself was..AMAZING! The best I've ever had! I made my crust from scratch and pre-baked it. Seemed to come out rather well. Great recipe. And not I'll be making this for every special occasion!

5 minutes to prepare this pie.  This is the pie that when cut, makes perfect looking slices!  Ideal texture and taste.

If I could give it a million stars I would! My husband lives for pumpkin pie and when i first made this I didn't know a thing about making it.... and my gosh did it blow him away! So then I wanted to impress his family on thanksgiving so I made two more.... they were gone by the time we were ready to go to another home (which the second pie was intended for!) for dinner... amazing. just go with it and its incredible. I used a butter pie crust from here, but zI cant remember the name of it, so this year i've been using pilsbury crust from the refridgerator section.

Awesome recipe. I followed it to the letter and it is delicious! I made both this pie and the Libby's Pumpkin Pie at the same time to compare and I liked this one better. It has a great creamy smooth flavor without being overwhelmed by spices. If you like a more spiced flavored pie, try the Libby's, which is also very good. Also, I used a smallish pie pan and so had leftover filling. I added a small amount of flour (maybe a tsp) and then poured into a two cupcake tins and removed them from the baking process about 15 mins from the end. They were awesome also!

This recipe was very easy to make. However, some of the filling burnt, and the filling itself is too sweet. I think the pumpkin should be increased and the condensed milk decreased. The ginger flavor was also a bit too much. Otherwise, it was pretty tasty!

This is the best recipe for pumpkin pie. I have been using it for years. I always get asked what is in it, and it is the sweetened condensed milk that makes it so good. Can't go wrong with it. Better than the Libby's recipe ;)

Sooo delicious! I did as someone mentioned previously and heated up the pumpkin to get rid of the "canned" taste. Everyone in my family raved over it. Can't wait to make it for Thanksgiving!

I made thsi pie for my boyfriend to bring to pot luck lunch at school. It was gone long before the turkey was gone. I used pumpkin pie filling instead of pumpkin puree but still added all the flavorings called for as my boyfriend specifcally asked for a stronger cinnamon flavor. It was extremely easy to make. All in all, best pumpkin pie recipe EVER!

This is such an easy and delicious recipe...almost like a custard consistency.  I had fresh pumpkins to use and it turned out great!  I have made 2 pies this week :)   It's almost as if you could doctor it a bit and make it into a flan...

I would have given this a 5 star, but I baked the pie using an unbaked pie crust as stated in the recipe; however it came out with a doughy crust on the bottom, not cooked at all. Next time I will bake the pie crust for a few minutes before I fill it with the pumpkin to see if that works better!

Pretty good once I made some changes. I added 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp vanilla, and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I used a mixer to mix it up which I think really helped. The consistency was good but next time I'd like to add more spices. It was a little bland for my taste.

Simply the best!  The easiest pumpkin pie I have ever made.  I used frozen Marie Calendars deep dish pie crusts, since I have the worst time making crusts and these are quite good.  I use about half a cup more canned pumpkin than the recipe calls for and it fills the crust nicely.  My grandmother thought this was the best pumpkin pie she'd ever had.  Thank you for such a simple and tasty recipe!

I made two of these pies, one for each of our Thanksgiving dinners, and both my husband's and my family loved it!  I love that it combines two ingredients (sugar & milk) so it's a little quicker to prepare. This really is a perfect, traditional pumpkin pie.

This is the exact recipe that my mom always made when I was growing up.  The only difference is that she used pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices.  I've been making it now since she passed away in 2000.  I made it this year for Thanksgiving and my 8 year old nephew ate almost the whole pie by himself and proclaimed it the best pie he had ever eaten.  That was all the praise I needed!

I have been making this pie now for 2 years. I will stick with this one permanantly. I made four this year and for Christmas I make it again but instead I drizzle melted caramel on top after it bakes and sprinkle roasted chopped pecans on it for a different taste at Christmas.

What's not to like?  This recipe is so easy, and it always turns out perfectly.  A fantastic standby.  I always follow the recipe exactly, but maybe I'll branch out a bit in coming years.  I use my electric mixer to get the filling very smooth, and watch closely to ensure it doesn't overcook.

Prebaked piecrust WARNING! I am a little new to baking pies but I wanted to share "the wrong way to do it"...I read the reviews and wanted to prebake the piecrust (homemade basic pie crust), however i did not know how long/temp to do it so I put it in the oven at temp the pie was to bake at...and for 5 min. The sides pulled down, the crust shrunk,bubbles.. it wasn't ruined...but it wasn't pretty anymore. If I were to do it again, I think I would poke holes all over the crust with a fork, only bake it as the temp is rising to 425, and for only a minute or two while watching it. Other than that...I like pumpkin pie with cloves so I added 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves and it was still fantastic!

Wow, this is probably the best pumpkin pie I have ever had.  And this was the first time I have made the pie!.  I did as other reviewers suggested. I used fresh pureed pumpkin and warmed it up with the spices first.  I also used 2 tsp of cinnamon as suggested. Also best tip ever is to let the pie cool in the oven with the door cracked. I will be definately be making this pie again!

It isn't called PERFECT for nothing!  Can't mess this one up!  So thick and creamy!  As noted by another review, I did cook the pumpkin and spices together on the stove... will do this every time!

This pie turned out perfectly.  I added 1/2 teaspoon of the pumpkin pie spice at the recommendation of some of the reviewers.  This pie was light and airy, almost like a whip!  My family RAVED about this!  I will be bringing this to our Thanksgiving Day table for certain!  Thank you Eagle Brand!!

This is my mother's recipe.  We've been making it for years!  The only difference is that we use 2 t. of pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices.  It's quick, easy and delish.

I've made this pie TWICE this season - one time w/ canned pumpkin and one time w/ fresh roasted pumpkin. BOTH times I got rave reviews! Be careful NOT to overfill your pie. I tend to have a quite a bit of filling left over, so next time I'm gonna use a 10" pie crust. I think it will be perfect :)

Perfect basic pie. We love it! Next time I make it I will definitely up the spices - I found it slightly too bland for my taste - I love my pies flavorful. No change otherwise. As for the crust, I used a really good, foolproof pie/tart crust recipe: Rustic Autumn Fruit Tart, also found on this site. Both these will be on all my festive dinner tables for years to come.

Very easy, truly perfect pumpkin pie.  I buy organic sweetened condensed milk to avoid all of the preservatives and nasty ingredients of regular condensed milk.  I also make my own crust out of oats and the seeds from the pumpkin I bake.  This is a fool proof recipe.

it is delicious..the only thing I do for any filling pie. I take out the yoke of an egg, and wisk a little egg whites on the top of the pie crust,before I add the filling. The crust doesn't go mushy, and cooks great

This was my first try at pumpkin pie and my whole family was very impressed this Christmas.  Noone could believe that it wasn't from a bakery.  I used a traditional frozen crust instead of a graham one- couldn't imagine a graham crust with pumpkin.  and I think the realy secret to this recipe is the sweetened condenced milk instead of evaporated milk many recipes use.  definately worth the work on this!!!!

This was GREAT! My hubby loves pumpkin pie and said this was the best he's ever had - that was the first time I ever made the pie (now, I'm an old pro)!  I just put all the ingredients in my cuisinart to blend everything consistently before pouring in pie crust.  This is foolproof, you cannot go wrong with this recipe.

I used fresh pumpkin from Halloween and was afraid it would come out gross but it was great. I also prebaked the crust for about 6 minutes because some of the reviewers said their crust came out raw in the center. Mine was fine with the prebake and not overdone. I also increased the spices as recommended by some users. I only gave it a 4 because I still want to tweek the spices a bit. But I'll be making 2 for Christmas this year!

This pumpkin pie recipe is extremely easy to make and it comes out delicious.  My grandmother told me that from now on I would always be in charge of making the pumpkin pie.  This pie is better than store bought and it doesn't really take very long to make it! Give it a try you won't be disappointed!

This pie is rich and delicious. I loved this creamy spicy flavor. The spices are the key ingredient. I made this with cookie crust and I added walnuts.

This is the first time I have reviewed a recipe on allrecipes.  My mother is the real cook in our family and usually makes every meal from scratch.  On Thanksgiving, the only things that are purchased are the ham and the pumpkin pie.  I have no idea why she buys that pie because she makes all the other desserts from scratch.  However, this year, I decided to take it upon myself to make a pumpkin pie and I stumbled across this recipe and read many of the reviews first.  I like to bake more than cook so I was excited about trying this recipe (although I do not eat pumpkin pie.)

Well, I sure am glad I read the reviews and made a few changes because my family LOVED this pie.  Even my two year old loved it and we all know how picky a two year old can be!!!  The changes I made were I substituted 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon for all the spices and then I added a 1/4 cup of brown sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I used a deep dish pre-made crust and made sure I forked the bottom and covered the sides with foil to keep it from burning.  It came out beautiful!  My father raved for hours...and he is not the "raving" kind!  My husband made his homemade whipped cream so I am sure that helped.  You will NOT be disappointed with this pie!

I used fresh pumpkin from a medium sugar pumpkin, which came to about 4 cups of pumpkin.  So I doubled the recipe to match, except for the condensed milk - one can of the fat-free variety was sweet enough.  Two cans would've been overkill/diabetes-inducing.  I also used homemade pie crust, which I pre-baked prior to use.  Great!  Also note that 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice is 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  So using pumpkin pie spice instead of the recommended spices is really no change; they're the same spices.

Excellent! I added an extra TSP of cinnamon and a 1/4 TSP of ground cloves for a more spiced flavor, and it was perfect. I baked in a store-bought graham cracker crust, and it took just about 40 minutes at 350F to be finished. I had some dark splotches on the top of the pie, but they tasted fine and weren't hard at all. I checked the pie at 35 minutes and the center had not yet set, so I don't think I could have put it in for less time. This will be my go-to recipe for years to come. Thanks!

This was an awesome recipe.  I was so upset at first since I hadn't printed it up and lost my power and internet the night before Thanksgiving however I found out that the recipe comes with the Eagle's brand sweetened condensed milk so our day was saved.  I did change it by adding some Tastefully Simple Mulling Spice along with the ginger and cinnamon, as well as heating up the spices and pumpkin together first as another poster suggested to blend the flavors and get rid of the canned taste.  My husband thought it was great and he is a big pumpkin pie man.  I've never been too fond of pumpkin pie but made it since he loves pumpkin pie. After this pie I am a big fan too!

"Perfect" is the only description for this pie!  The only thing I did differently was to A: Heat up the pumpkin puree with the spices, and B: Add cloves.  Satiny smooth, fluffy and absolutely divine.

I gave this 5 stars because of it's ease of prep.  I doubled the recipe, added a TON more pumpkin pie spice.  It was a bit on the sweet side for me, but I can fix that next time by making it spicier.  I used an extra large graham cracker crust for one and made the other, which only filled about half a pie pan, crustless.  Basically, made one pumpkin custard to eat while the pie was saved for Thanksgiving LOL.  I tried to make pumpkin pie YEARS ago and failed miserably.  I tried this and will be making this from now on.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

This is by far the best pumpkin pie recipe out there; it's the only one I will make! I follow another person's suggestion of using pumpkin pie spice in place of the ginger, which is really nice. You can use a ready-made graham cracker crust, but if you take just a little extra time to make a home-made crust, the results are so worth it! Truly a 5 star recipe.

I tried the suggestion that jdc4him made, which was heating the pumpkin and dry goods before mixing in the liquids and it worked for me! I served it warm, which I highly recommend. So creamy. I haven't yet had it chilled so I hope it's just as good.

This pie absolutely lives up to its name! I have tried many pumpkin and sweet potato pie recipes, and this one outshines them all. I placed a small piece of aluminum foil around the edges before baking to prevent burned crust. **Make sure to follow the directions exactly and bake at 425 for ONLY 15 min. before reducing heat to 350. I forgot one of the times I made these and the result was a disaster.**

This is a very good pumpkin pie recipe. However, I made some personal changes to make it better! I love a thick creamy texture to it, so I always blend all my ingredients in the blender before filling the pie shell. I cut the sweetness almost in half by using a half a can of condensed milk (or doubling the recipe!) and adding a few tablespoons of sugar. I also cut the nutmeg in half, the ginger down a little bit, and added a bit more cinnamon (I don't like a heavily spiced pie). Delicious!!!

I was really disappointed with this recipe. After reading the reviews, I expected a lot more from this recipe. For one thing, it was too blank. I think cloves would help a lot. Also, the texture was not good. My traditional pumpkin pie recipe (you know, with the evaporated milk) is so much better, a much smoother, creamy texture. I would only use this recipe again if I were out of evaporated milk and only had the sweetened condensed milk on hand. Actually, I think I would run to the store and get the evaporated milk!

It was a very good pie, however we thought it could use more spices (about twice as much). I doubled the recipe to bake it in a deep 9 inch dish, but found that the normal recipe would have been enough. Next time, I will just increase the spices and keep the other ingredients as they are. Thank you!

So good! I had never tasted or much less made a pumpkin pie before this, but decided to after tasting one at a Thanksgiving work party. I was not disappointed with this recipe. I followed another user's suggestion of cooking the pumpkin with the spices and cooling before incorporating the eggs and condensed milk. This did not taste canned at all!
I've actually made three pies this past week for friends and family. I think this actually tastes great cold, but it's just as easy to warm up so everyone at the table is happy! h, and did I mention how incredibly easy this recipe is?

What's great about this recipe is that it's KID FRIENDLY.  The condensed milk creates a thicker filling for the pie than evaporated milk, so the filling doesn't slosh around when you try to put it into the oven.  I use this recipe anytime I'm cooking with my nieces.  I can't tell you how many times the filling spilled all over the inside of my hot oven when I used evaporated milk instead.

To really spruce it up, I add an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, plus a 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves and a 1/4 cup of brandy or cognac.  I also melt 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter with 2 tablespoons of dark brown sugar and swirl the mixture into the top of the pie filling before baking.  This gives the pie a spectacular aesthetic value!

I am giving the recipe "as is" a 4 star rating.  I made a few changes (based upon a pumpkin bread recipe) and would give the pumpkin pie using the changes a 5 star rating.  I started by using a graham cracker crust and then changed/added the following spices: 1/4 tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp nutmeg, plus I used evaporated milk ( instead of sweetened condensed milk..as I didn't have any) and added 1/2 cup white granulated sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar.  Came out delicious!!!

This definitely tastes better the day after you bake it.  I took a bite while it was almost cool and thought that it was not very good, but by the next day, the pie was sweet with a nice, creamy texture. VERY easy- it didn't even take 5 minutes to mix and prepare the ingredients.

I accidentally made changes to this recipe and it turned out perfect.  I used a 30 oz can of pumpkin and a 14 oz can of sweetened condensed milk and 2 eggs.  It all fit exactly into a 9" deep dish pie crust.  It turned out soft and not too sweet or firm.  I like it this way, I think the original recipe would be too sweet and thick.

This was the first pumpkin pie I ever made, and everyone was so enthusiastic about the wonderful creamy texture and taste. It is so easy to make and is a sure winner! Wished I had made two at the same time because it went so fast. I used Libby's canned pumpkin for a no hassle already cooked pumpkin puree. What's also divine with this pumpkin pie recipe is a graham cracker crust. Use any recipe and add one beaten egg white to the mixture for a better holding together. I didn't have to pre-back the crust because the whole thing can go in the oven and bake together. Highly recomment this recipe. Super yum.

For prep time, it was great. Compared to some pumpkin pies I have tasted, this one is not that great. It was too sweet and I added a ton of homemade pumpkin spice to jazz it up. The texture was not like a pumpkin pie either...too dry. I will stick to traditional recipes with evap milk.

I should have given it 5 stars but since only my husband tried it, I'm giving it four.  This was the first pumpkin pie I had ever made and the night before making this, my aunt, who is the equivalent of Martha Stewart, told me I had ruined my pie by adding Sweetened condensed milk.  Said it should have been Evaporated milk.  By then, I had thrown out the piece of paper I had this recipe on and looked thru cookbooks to find she was correct that most pumpkin pies do have Evap. milk.  So I did not serve this pie to anyone even though it was beautiful!!!!  My husband then tried the pie a couple days later and said it was "Wonderful!!!"  better than the one I actually served!   Easy for my first pie too!!

Made six of these for all my Thanksgiving stops. Got the best compliments! Instead of three different spices I used  1 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Very important to get a good quality crust. The wonderful creamy taste makes you think it was bought at a high end pastry shop. Faboulous!

I gave this recipe five stars because it was so easy and tasted so good. I brought it to my family's Thanks Giving dinner and they really liked it. They said, "from now on you are in charge of making the pumpkin pie every year."

So easy! I followed the recipe exactly as directed and it came out perfect. If you're looking for something "different" this is not your recipe - this is a good 'ole fashioned, traditional pumpkin pie. Very good!

I baked this pie for Thanksgiving 2006 and it certainly is the perfect pumpkin pie. I did make one exception that was very well recieved. Instead of a tradional pie crust I (accidentally) used a grahm cracker pie crust. My wife got a big laugh at my expense, but I got the last laugh with everyone praising my "innovation"! It was delicious!

You need to add a lot more spices... Not very flavorful, but it's pumpkin pie so it's always good.

Great pumpkin pie - thank you!  I added a bit more spice and some ground cloves, and it turned out perfect.  Make sure you use a deep pie dish, as I used the frozen store bought type and there was a bit of filling left over.

I used this recipe to make pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving this year.  My father-in-law has now requested I make them again for Christmas.  He said it was the closest recipe to the pies his mom used to make.  I think I've just started a new tradition in our family with this recipe!!

This is the first pumpkin pie I have made and I found recipe is very easy although a little dry and a little bland.  I cooked the pie about 10 minutes longer than the maximum time stated as I thought that the pie was not cooked since the edges were puffed up but the center was not.  Quite likley this is the reason for it being slightly dry.  I will make this again but cook only for the time stated and increase the spices by 50%.

The consistency and color were perfect.  I added more spices than the recipe called for based on previous ratings, but I (who love extra spices) thought it was too spicy. I should have tried the original recipe first.  Easy and turned out beautiful. I baked the crust for five minutes before putting the pie mixture in, then made sure to cover the edges with foil for the last 15-20 min.  Perfect!

Super easy!  I did hold back a fourth of the condensed milk, I didnât want it to make it too sweet. Also a pinch more cinnamon,nutmeg, & ginger, just a pinch more :)

This is a very easy recipe and it tastes amazing. This is a good place for a beginner baker to start. I just don't understand how people are making this and saying that it isn't sweet? Are you using evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed milk? I promise you, if you follow this recipe, it will be perfectly sweet. My tips: If using a frozen crust, let it thaw and then pre bake at 400Â° for 8 minutes, let it cool, and then add the pumpkin mixture and bake according to directions. Just remember to rent the edges for the first 15 minutes. Also, I personally just add premade pumpkin pie spice until it's to my liking. I always add eggs last so I can test the batter to make sure my spices are right.

EASIEST pumpkin pie recipe ever. I followed another reviewers suggestion about heating the pumpkin and spices first and wow what a difference! This will be the only way I make pumpkin pie from now on.

My first time making pumpkin pie of any kind. I did make a few changes. I used fresh pumpkin (2 cups) and added 1/2 teaspoon of allspice. I also baked the crust first, per pie crust directions. Since I used a little more pumpkin, I had a little extra filling, so I baked it along with the pie in a separate little pan I had. That turned out great too!  My mom was worried it might be too sweet with the condensed milk, as she uses the recipe with evaporated. I went ahead with the condensed though, as I felt it would go better with the fresh pumpkin. I would make this again for sure.

I made this last night to use up an opened can of pumpkin. I was brave and decided to try using my 15 ounce can minus a half cup. I put the spices and pumpkin in a saucepan for a few minutes on medium low while putting my pie crust together as another reviewer suggested.  I was in a hurry so didnât get all of the sweetened condensed milk scraped out of the can either.  I also added a bit more cinnamon than called for. This turned out great. My husband said it tasted better than the Costco pie he had at work which was a huge compliment. We tried this while it was still warm because we couldnât wait. I used half shortening and half butter in the flaky butter pie crust recipe from this site.

I've  made this recipe so many times. People love it!  No problems with flavors or over baking.  I've gone as far as experimenting with different flavored crust which people enjoy.  ( especially the Oreo crust) I would recommend this recipe to others!  My newest pie is currently in the oven baking lol

Usually one piece of pumpkin pie a year is enough for me.  I made pies for our Thanksgiving dinner this week and made this recipe for the traditional  dessert, along with an Apple /pear and a strawberry/rhubarb.   We ended up bringing about a third of the pumpkin pie home.  This morning I decided to try a piece with my coffee.  I have to say it was the best I had ever eaten!  Wish I had made another!  I would highly recommend this recipe.  Thanks allrecipes!!

I will make again. I used 1/4 tsp of clove ( from Libby recipe) in addition to the spices listed in the recipe. I heated all spices and pumpkin in a saucepan prior to cooling and mixing with the sweetened condensed milk and eggs.  I also put in in a separate oven to cool slowly after the lower temp baking at 350 for 35 minutes. No cracks, no skin on top. Significantly better than the recipe on the Libby can!!!  I compared them side by side.

Terrible.  I wasted a lot of ingredients/money on this pie.  After tasting it, I realized it didn't have sugar in it.  I went back to the ingredients to make sure that I hadn't just missed that ingredient.  Nope.  It wasn't on there.  I should have paid more attention.  Bleck.

I make this recipe regularly.  As in- once a month or more.  It is my daughters favorite dessert.  Since I have made it so often, I've tweaked it to our family's taste.  We prefer the flavor of fresh versus canned pumpkin.  So we use 15 oz fresh, which is more liquid than its canned counterpart.  I add a tablespoon of cornstarch to the pumpkin to make it less liquidy.  I also use double the amount of cinnamon and add a half teaspoon of nutmeg.  Cooking time is perfect.  I also use a graham cracker. Rust because it adds an extra crumbly sweetness factor.  We love it.

This was the first pumpkin pie I've ever made. It's never been one of my favorites. However, it got rave reviews from everyone. I needed to make 2 pies, and I didn't have enough sweetened condensed milk, so I used half sweetened and half regular pet milk . This was the only change I made. I did bake the pie crust (with a pie pan placed on top of the crust to keep it from bubbling up) for 8 minutes and then poured in the filling. Turned out perfect!!

I warmed the canned pumpkin on the stove with the spices as many have suggested, but didn't change anything else and our large family loved them so much I had to bake 4 more after the initial 2 were gobbled up quickly. I actually never liked pumpkin pie, but I assumed the role of the pie baker after we lost the person that usually made them. (Family squabble, not death). And, after trying this recipe, I discovered that I just didn't like the pumpkin pies I had in the past.  This one is fantastic!

My pumpkin pie turned out perfect thanks to a few suggestions from previous commenters! First of all, you're going to want to bake it at 425 degrees for 25 minutes to start with so that your crust ends up throughly cooked rather than soggy and mushy! After that, you're going to want to cover the crust with some aluminum tenting so that it doesn't burn. Once you do that, turn your oven down to 325 degrees (leave the pie in the oven the whole time) and bake for a full hour. Lastly, be sure to leave the pie, aluminum tenting and all, in the oven once you turn it off so that the difference in temperature from the oven to your kitchen doesn't cause the filling to sink or crack while cooling. Remove the tenting once you remove the pie from the oven, and allow the pie to cool to room temp before covering with wrap and placing it in the refrigerator overnight!

The pie was really good. The filling was the way I liked it! The only changes I made was that I used acorn squash and less nutmeg since the nutmeg scent is really strong. I seen a lot of people saying that "it has no sugar", well the sugar is in the CONDENSED MILK.

A good pie, but I'll stick to the traditional with evaporated milk rather than the condensed.  The texture and flavor seem richer and better to me than this recipe.  This also seemed a bit too sweet.

Yum!  I have a family that likes its desserts super sweet and extra-flavorful (okay, so its me that likes it that way but I'm the cook!) so I added about a 1/2 cup of light brown sugar to this recipe. Also, in addition to pumpkin pie spice, I added extra cinnamon and nutmeg. So good. The hard part is letting it cool before eating it. It's even better the next day for breakfast. I liked everyone's tips about putting the crust in the freezer for a bit first and putting the pie on a tray before placing it in the oven.

FOOL PROOF! Let me first say that I went to culinary school, studied pastry arts, have made pumpkin pie every way known to man -- including making my own puree.   Often times, the extra work yields the best result; in my experience, that's not necessarily true for pumpkin pie. You can absolutely use fresh puree instead of canned here.  But for beginners or those crutched for time, make this. Make two. Hell, make four and freeze a couple!  
*Tips:
Like many others, I heat the puree, double the spices, and blind bake my crust first. 
Enjoy!!

I took the suggestion to heat the pumpkin with the spices. I also partially pre-baked the crust. Took the pie to a neighborhood Halloween party & there wasn't a crumb left!

Finally.  FINALLY.  A pie that looks and tastes like the kind you buy at the store, meaning the color, sweetness and texture.   (But better, because it's homemade.)  Using condensed milk instead of evaporated makes all the difference in the world.  I actually added 2 tablespoons of white sugar to the mix as well because I was afraid it would not be sweet enough, and it came out perfect.  Mine took less time, only 27 minutes on 350, and even then it came close to getting a little overcooked, so watch it at the end.  Oh as per my personal taste, I left out the ginger and nutmeg, and I thought it was perfect with just cinnamon, nice and mild.  This is my forever pie, lol.

I was surprised to like such a simple pie, as I usually make one with half & half and brandy that is my family's fave. I Took off one star due to too much time at  425F, causing the crust to  over brown. It was totally dark with 22 minutes left to bake. I did double the ginger and halve the salt. Children and adults all enjoyed this.

Baked exactly as posted, came out perfect!  I think the people that said it wasn't sweet enough used evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed milk by mistake.

Not sweet, gritty, nearly flavorless, weird "skin" forms on top. Whipped cream doesn't improve it and it leaves an after taste..
The Libby's recipe is better and the pumpkin pie recipe from the book "Spoonbread and Strawberry Wine" is phenomenal compared to this one.

I made this recipe by following it exactly, though I did use a ready-made graham cracker crust. I put the pie on a cookie sheet like advised to, but the crust did burn a little. The filling was almost to much for the crust, so it did flow over a bit. Love the taste, will definitely do it again, but use an unbaked crust as directed, and pour less filling in.

Super easy recipe and the pie turned out so delicious! The best one I've made to date! I followed the suggestions and pre-baked my pie crust for about 8 minutes. I used Trader Joe's frozen pie crust. Very forgiving and flaky! I used a tablespoon of McCormick's pumpkin pie spice in lieu of the listed spices. It was perfect! I also warmed up the canned pumpkin and let the pie sit for 5 minutes in the oven after I turned it off. It was set perfectly! This one's a keeper for me!

I did this recipe exactly.  

Pros: recipe was easy to follow, the cook time was perfect, the consistency was great, and no cracks in pie. It was custardy, smooth, and had a great finish. 

Cons: if u don't like desserts that are too sweet, this pie is for you. I feel if I'm going to have dessert, I want the calories to be worth it, & like desserts very sweet.

Big hit at Thanksgiving! Very delicious. The only issue I had was the pie shrinking a bit after baking. But that is more  of a crust or glass pie pan issue. Also I would suggest covering outer crust with tinfoil to prevent burning.

Delicious with Graham Cracker Crust. Mixed pumpkin and spices on stove top first before combining with other ingredients. Used no salt due to "special" diet and still super yummy.

I made this recipe using a muffin pan, making mini pies. They were delicious! Not too sweet, and great texture. My new go to pumpkin pie recipe. Next time, I may attempt the boiling tip from another reviewer and see what difference it makes.

I think I actually used 14 or 14.5oz of pumpkin and used 12 mini pre-made graham cracker crusts, which was perfect for the amount of filling.  I also followed someone's suggestion of heating the mixture of pumpkin and spices to help blend all the flavors and allowing it to cool before mixing in the eggs.  I'm not sure if it made any different had I not heated the mixture prior, but it was my first pumpkin pie and it came out delicious! :)

Very tasty and simple.  I did heat the pumpkin and spices on the stove top first the the top review suggested.  This drastically reduced the cook time.  Mine was done in 30 mins. I also put my crust in the oven for about 5 mins before I poured in the pumpkin to avoid a soggy crust.

If I rated this by beauty and how simple and quick it was to go from "hardly baking" to "amazing pies" I'd certainly give it a 5 star. What wasn't a 5 star was myself who forgot to add the sweetened condensed milk.........hence, a yucky tasting pie unless you have an affinity for bitter. Needless to say I am going to try again come Monday afternoon. Maybe my kids won't be too traumatized and I can come back and amend my review. :)

Lol. I love this recipe because it is 'word for word' the exact same recipe on the back of the canned pumpkin. Wish there was some sort of variation instead of a copy.

The best!  I used 2tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of ginger and nutmeg and doubled the cinnamon. The compliments was best pie ever!  Ver flavorful but not overly strong.

I made this for thanksgiving with a premade uncooked crust from the grocery store. I was in a rush so instead of leaving it at 425 for 15 mins then 350 for 50 mins, I left it in at 425 for 40 mins on the bottom rack. It cooked perfectly with no soggy or burnt crust but the spices which tasted awesome in the batter were a little strong for my taste when it was cooked.except for the cooking temp/ time I followed the given recipe exactly and am really glad I didn't follow the reviews and up the spices since it would have made it even worse. I also did not precook my crust or cover it with foil. I did brush some egg yolk on the crust though and it browned nicely. I will try another slice tomorrow to see if it was truly horrible or not but for now i am not a fan.

This was my first time making a pumpkin pie and thankfully it was easy to do. My daughter is a big fan of this pie, loved it.

I tried this recipe today..Thanksgiving day..and I felt like I really liked the texture of the pie and how nice and even it cooked but I did feel like a little flavor or spices were missing. I think the sweetened milk might have overpowered the spices because I used the same as I usually do with evaporated milk. But overall it was a decent pie I think I will make it again and maybe adjust seasonings.

At first I thought the sweetened condensed milk was a typo because all of the recipes on the cans of pumpkin say evaporated milk. I took a leap of faith and made it exactly as written. I regret that I only made 1 pie since my 10 guests devoured it and I don't have any leftover :(. Very yummy!

Line the pie plate with bottom pastry. Beat one egg white and 1 tablespoon water; brush over crust to keep crust from getting soggy.  Learned this tip when I was making a raspberry pie one summer.  It works great and you can use it for any type of pie.

I just made this today to have for thanksgiving. I had a little of the filling left over that I put in a dish and baked, and it tastes phenomenal!! The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because it definitely needs more spices. The base of the recipe is really good and sweet, but it needs more of that pumpkin pie spicy flavor. It will be fine for Thanksgiving as it still tastes great, but in the future I will add more spices. Thanks for a great recipe!

those that say the recipe is bland and needs sugar are most likely using regular condensed milk, you need to use eagle brand sweetened condensed milk,  easy to make wonderful pie

Excellent. I followed the directions with a couple modifications based on prior reviews. I heated the pumpkin with the spices first. I changed the spices to just 2t of pumpkin pie spice and 1t of cinnamon.

I have been searching for the perfect pumpkin pie recipe and this is the closest I've got. It's pretty good. The consistency and spices are just right. It just doesn't taste as pumpkin-y as I would like. I plan to keep tweaking it, perhaps cooking the canned pumpkin first or using real pumpkin.

I used a deep dish for the pie. I also added 1/4 tsp of clove and 1tsp of vanilla.  Kept some of the pumpkin from the jack o lantern when we carved it to make the pie.  Turned out perfect!

I love pumpkin pie and this was my first time making it. I doubled the recipe cause I could only find a big can of pumpkin. I've made it twice since it was so good the first time.
The first time I used half condensed milk and half evaporated. The second time I used all condensed. I much prefer half condense and half evaporated. It was too sweet with all condensed. I took the advise of other reviewers and used pumpkin pie spice but I also added more nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger.Great recipe and I'll make again next year for thanksgiving!

easy and very good.  I followed the suggestion to heat the pumpkin and spices together in a medium pan over low heat and would agree that it makes a difference.

This was absolutely delicious. Made with a home-made graham crust and used another reviewers suggestion of heating up the pumpkin to rid of any potential tin can taste. Thought the flavor was just right. Wouldn't change a thing!

This is my go to recipe when I don't have cream cheese to make pumpkin cheesecake, don't have enough sugar to make better recipe that uses condensed milk pumpkin pie, don't feel like hassling with either pumpkin cookies, muffins or pumpkin bread but still find myself craving something pumpkin and baked. This is easy to whip up. Instead of making a pie I pour the filling into individual serving size dishes, set them in a water bath/bake them and then serve with a plop of whip cream, Cool Whip, Jiffy Whip, Dream Whip or Marshmallow Fluff - whatever I happen to have in hand. My sons like it cooled but still the slightest bit warm with a scoop of gourmet vanilla bean ice cream on top and a little caramel topping drizzled over that along with some slices of Granny Smith apple wedges on the side to dip/use as spoons.

IMHO, this is truly the perfect pumpkin pie. I always follow the recipe to the letter and it tastes like my Mom's thanksgiving standard. It wouldn't be a holiday without it! Try it, you'll like it.

The taste is not to my family's preference. It needs some sugar in my opinion. The flavor is a nice light pumpkin but lacks a little bit of sweetness.

It's really perfect! I use cookie crumbs for the crust and fresh pumpkin puree. I always get compliments :)

I made this recipe the exact way the recipe suggests, but I didn't like it very much. I didn't think it was very sweet nor did it have much of a pumpkin flavor. Also, the 9" pie crust was not big enough to hold the filling. The recipe wasn't horrible and wasn't even that bad, it just wasn't good. I would never recommend this to anyone.

This was great! My kids have made this twice now, and it's simple, and has a creamy, sweet, not too overpowering pumpkin taste. We used a graham cracker crust, which was perfect.

Became a pumpkin pie eater over the last year. Decided to try making my own. Couple we had over really enjoyed it and staff at work who got some slices thought it was among the best pies they had had before :) Plan to be making for Xmas dinner!

Perfect Pumpkin Pie is Perfect!  Instead of measuring the cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg, we just used 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice.  We used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe from this site for the crust.  With an egg-white wash on the crust, these two paired for an excellent combination!  Best part:  no crack in the top of the pie!  Woo hoo!

This is the first pumpkin pie I made as my husband loves pumpkin pie and we had guest over ,Everyone liked it:) I thought it was ok,don't know what was missing but maybe it's something I did wrong.did take other suggestions and baked my pie crust for 15 mins at 375 degrees F before adding the filling and I baked the pie at 375 for 40 mins and lowered it to 325 for the next 15 minutes and the last 12 minutes I put the pies on the lowest rack and it definitely helped to give the crust a nice golden brown color.

Yummy! I do a lot of baking with pumpkin and find there is a difference when you use "pumpkin pie spice" instead of putting the individual spices together yourself. I followed the recipe as directed. Based off of other reviews, I heated the pumpkin and spice mixture and added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 tablespoon of vanilla.

Yummy! Although I did tweak the recipe slightly. I cooked the pumpkin puree with spices on the stove and slowly added some light brown sugar until I was able to get rid of most of the bitter taste of the canned pumpkin. After I let the spiced puree cool then I added all the other ingredients. Also instead of using 2 eggs I added 1 whole egg and 3 egg yolks. Last time I cooked this pie I had a crack this time there were no cracks after cooling.

its a good recipe. For a more fresh pie you can use 15oz.-16oz. of fresh boiled or baked pumpkin (blended) instead of canned pumpkin. I also felt this recipe was not sweet enough so i added 1/3 cup of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla extract for more flavor.

Followed the recipe precisely yet the pie is gross. The flavor is off and the texture is terrible.  Also a large skin developed during the baking process and created a balloon. When the pie cools, the balloon collapsed and the pie was ugly.

I was looking for a great pumpkin pie recipe and this one was highly rated.  It was  VERY bland and as one reviewer mentioned after it baked it had some funky looking leather like coating on top.  I ended up trying and falling in love with Mom's Pumpkin Pie that I found on this sight.  Turned out beautifully!

I've been making this recipe for the past few years. The only changes I made to the recipe was using pumpkin spice mix and an extra dash of cinnamon, and sometimes I'll bake it in individual tart shells rather than one 9 inch pie crust. Everyone loves it. It's the perfect ratio of sweetness to pumpkin mixture.

Loved the depth from the sweetened condensed milk, my whole family thought it was sweet enough. I, unlike other reviewers, would not add any extra sugar & we like our sweets. I do however think you could double the cinnamon.

This was my first time baking a pumpkin pie and I loved the results! A word of caution. I added evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed milk so I am willing to bet that it would have tasted way better had it not been for that mistake. I gave the recipe 5 stars because that was an error on my part and even with a wrong ingredient it came out great. I just wanted to point the milk out to other beginning bakers.

Thought this was really good and easy to make. The only change I would make would be is to add 1 tsp of spices instead of just a half tsp. I didnt feel the spices were tasted enough.

Awesome pumpkin pie! First off I have never made a pumpkin pie so this one seemed simple enough. I did follow the other instructions, heated up the canned pumpkin and seasoning first in pan and then mixed the other ingredients. I did bake it for 15 min and then turned off the oven and let it sit for about 45-1hour and it came out perfect! My friends and family ate the whole thing. I should have made 2!

This was just OK for me. We had three different kinds of homemade pumpkin pie this past Thanksgiving and this was the least favorite. Easy recipe to follow but, I won't be making this again.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe! The sweetened condensed milk was just enough "sweet" for my family. I used a 9-in deep dish ready made pie crust. I made several pies and the crust turned out the best when I let in bake in the oven for a few minutes before pouring in the batter. Similar to other reviewers, I substituted the ginger and nutmeg with Pumpkin Pie Spice. I also added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Finally, I used tin foil on the pie crust edges to prevent burning. I removed them about 15 minutes before the baking finished.

GREAT!!! Next time I'm going to add more spices. I, also, used fresh pumpkin puree which seemed to have a different effect as opposed to using the can - was more wet, and not very pumpkin-y flavored. I'll be experimenting more though because THIS is a GREAT Pumpkin Pie recipe=)

This is my go to recipe for pumpkin pie, or even a sweet potatoe pie and today I used it to make a calabaza (west India, or Cinderella pumpkin) pie and it always turns out amazing.

I made my own sweetened condensed milk: 1 quart regular milk and added 1 cup sugar in sauce pan. Then simmered it on low for 2 hrs till it turned to a caramel color and the amount reduced to half. Then added 1 Tbsp butter to it, let it cool in fridge and used only "12oz" of it in the pie because it was very thin. I followed the rest of the recipe to a t. Since my  homemade Sweetened condensed milk wasn't thick like caramel-as it should have been, I had to bake it an extra 15 minutes. I was very concerned about the consistency but it turned out to be as  smooth as velvet and it tasted great! Even my 8 year old Stepson gave it 2 thumbs up!

I will never make pumpkin pie another way again.  For years my pies would be "so-so", but this turns out perfect every time.  I also added 2 tsp of Vietnmese cinnamon which really addes to the flavor (instead of regular cinnamon).

Perfect! I LOVED this pumpkin pie! :) The only modification I made was adding 1/4 c sugar, 1/4 c light brown sugar and 2 drops of vanilla to the mixture. I also followed the advice of another user and heated the pumpkin, salt and spices on the stove to get rid of the canned taste. The pie really couldn't have tasted any better! It did take a lot longer to bake then what the directions stated.

Wow, that is sweet!!!! I might have a bias being that I moved to Denmark, EU 3 years ago--I have probably become accustomed to a different level of sugar, but when I brought this to a dinner party with myself, a Dane, and three Italians we almost fell out of our charis from sugar shock. In the past I have used evaporated milk and white sugar so I can control the amount. I think I might try doing half the can of condensed milk and an equal amount of heavy whipping cream.

Hi everyone,
My 8 year old son usually does not like cakes or pies but he asked me to make him a pumpkin pie and he thought this one was super delicious. I followed some suggestions as follows; I used 2 teaspoon of pumpkin spice since I did not have ginger and nutmeg, also used 2. (9 inch) unbaked pie crust. cooked over low heat pumkin and spices and for the last 5 minutes cooked at lower rack for crispier crust. before putting inside oven I covered the side crust to prevent from burning. Follow the rest per recipe. Thanks to all the suggestions & reviews This pie came out perfect and very delicious. My pies were done in 25 minutes (Instead of 35 to 40 minutes) probably cause I separated mixture into 2 pie dishes. Thank You everyone.

So I altered this recipe to magnificent. Not from my doing, mainly from accidental or "in the moment" additions. This recipe I read as being too "condensed milky" so I decreased the amount of condensed milk by 3 oz (about a fourth of the can, slightly less). I noticed it had no added sugar and well, pumpkin pie should be delicious so I added about 1/2 cup of sugar. I noticed it had no cloves so I added 1/8th tsp (it would have been 1/4th tsp if I didn't add another 1/8th all spice!). I bumped up the nutmeg to 3/4 tsp (pumpkin pie people!) and with everything else the same it was splendid. 

An accidental part: One time a little while back when I was baking this pie, I poured too much batter into the crust (I just use the graham cracker crusts, I prefer Arrowhead Mills), so as an amateur to pies, I turned the pie into the batter mixture to pour some out. I didn't know how tough or flimsy the crust was but to my displeasure, the crust fell in with the batter and broke apart into small pieces. I beat it and used it nonetheless. It was truly magnificent. This last part may be odd but really, it worked. People in the house who normally hate pumpkin anything really thought it tasted good but still preferred not to eat pumpkin.

Thank you though, recipe maker that sold it to Eagle Brand. You created the foundation for this recipe. :))

I follow this recipe exactly, it is outstanding. My advice after making this many times is to use Libby's pumpkin and the Eagle Brand condensed milk - this results in a wonderful fluffy texture. When I have used cheaper ingredients, it resulted in the bland, flat pumpkin pie you find in grocery store bakeries. I buy Wholly Wholesome organic wheat crust because it is so awesome, but I have had good luck with any crust I have tried with these ingredients.

Made this for my hubby whose favorite pie is pumpkin pie. Flavor was amazing! I did have extra batter though. Not sure what happened there. And it did require longer time in the over (~15 mins extra). But the combination of spices and the sweetened condensed milk made this pie irresistible!

This is a great recipe but...  I advice a taste test before pouring a full can of sweetened condensed milk into it. Some squash is already very sweet. Taste test. I would give it a 5 but not all squash is equal.

I used steamed butternut squash(almost 2 cups) from my garden instead of pumpkin puree. I made the pie and froze it on the weekend. I had it on Thursday. It had very good body.  This blend of spices was very gently and mild on my sensitive stomach.  Next time I will try it with no crust and just butter the pie dish. My boyfriend and I loved it!!

This was incredibly easy to do and it tasted delicious. This was my first pumpkin pie that I made, and I'll most likely keep using this from now on.

Absolutely delicious!  When I served this, I added a dollop of Cool Whip and sprinkled some cinnamon over it.  I will definitely make this again!

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and it was not good.  I was reading all of the other reviews and don't know where I went wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly and the pie just did not have any flavor.  I don't think I was suppose to use just a regular can of pumpkin, maybe the can of pumpkin pie mix instead???  We ended up throwing the pie out, just not enough flavor.

I was really torn between this recipe and the Libby's recipe, but I went with this one.  It was SO good!  I followed the recipe exactly, but I added some extra nutmeg and cinnamon to make sure it was flavorful.  It was a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner!

My teenage daugther made this for Thanksgiving.  Came out great!  Followed suggestion of other reviewers and heated the pumpkin puree in a pan with the cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger and salt.  Cooled it a bit and then added the condensed milk.  Yummy!

This pie is one of the best pumpkin pie recipes ever! I used one of the crust recipes from this website. By suggestion from another review I heated the spiced and canned pumpkin in a saucepan for about 10 mins then let it cool down before adding the milk. I did however forget to add the eggs (I had a crying baby who needed to be fed and put to bed) but the pie turned out great!! Can't wait to make this again WITH the eggs. I'm sure it will be much better.

I used pumpkin goop, so this was made from scratch, other than the pie crust. It tasted great. I was glad I left one pie at home. It gave me something to look forward to after dinner with the in-laws.

I've never really had pumpkin pie.  I'm a sweet potato pie man.  However, for my wife's sake I made this one over Thanksgiving and it was, to my surprise, very good!  I followed the recipe to the letter and did not read suggestions for amendments.

This was absolutely amazing!!!! AND EASY!!! This recipe was a hit! Everybody loved it! My father-in-law wanted to know where I bought it! He was totally shocked when I said I made it myself!! The only thing I would change would be to use the deep dish pie crust. This was recommended by another reviewer. Deep dish is great!

This was really good, though it probably would have been better if I had been able to give it my full attention! I used more cinnamon(I really like spices!) than the recipe said, and it turned out pretty good.

A great way to end a Thanksgiving meal! I listened to the other reviewers and used 2 spoons of pumpkin pie spice plus another spoon of cinnamon. I left it in the fridge overnight after having it cool off in the oven. While cooking it I was a little skeptical of the taste and since I couldn't try the finished pie until serving it, I was a little nervous. However, it came out great! Everyone had something good to say about it. I didn't even want to admit how easy it was to make.

I made this recipe and the Libby's pumpkin pie recipe so I could compare and see which one is better.  This one was by far a better pie!  One of the reviews said this recipe was too sweet so I tried the other one in case.  The pie made with this recipe was devoured, and the other one only sampled to compare.  The votes are in and this is a winner!

After reading the reviews, I thought this would be a great pie to try this Thanksgiving.  Sadly, I will return to my Mom's fresh pumpkin pie recipe as the flavor is much better.   The Eagle Brand just doesn't do it for me.  Sorry!

I follow this recipe to the letter and it truly is perfect. The only thing to consider is the crust you buy...in my experience, spending a little extra on a good quality crust is worth it. I became an instant hit with the in-laws when I showed up with this pumpkin pie at christmas, and now its a yearly staple for both sides of the family.

This is basically my mom's recipe that I have been making for over 40 years and is always a hit - I have to make several of these because they go so quickly and buddies want to take some home.  I also add ground cloves to mine.  Serve hot with lots of whipped cream but also excellent when cold - of course with whipped cream.

My 7 year old wanted to make a pumpkin pie for our family several weeks ago.  We followed this recipe exactly, I only opened the cans for her and poured mixture into the shell.  It turned out fantastic.  She decided to make it for the teachers at her school.  Based on some reviews, we used a graham cracker crust.  I can't tell you how many compliments we received from the teachers.  It made my daughter very proud!!!  This recipe is a winner!

This was my first time making a pumpkin pie. I made one for work and one for home and they were both gone in a flash! I didn't have pumpkin spice but I had apple pie spice so I used that, cinnamon and a pinch of ginger. I also used a graham cracker crust. I will definitely make this again!

My daughter wanted Pumpkin Pie for her birthday and this was the recipe I made...It was awesome! The best I've ever tried. I didn't have the ginger or nutmeg. So improvised with 2tsp Cinnamon and a 1/2tsp allspice & also used a graham cracker crust.....it was such a hit with all my family that I've been nominated to make the pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving! Soooo soooo good :)

This was so much simpler than I was worrying pumpkin pie would be! It would have been even simpler if I had used canned pumpkin but I was happy to use the sugar pie ones! Great recipe, thanks Eagle Brand! Also thanks to the folks who suggested pre-baking the shell a bit.

An easy and tasty recipe that makes an excellent pie.  I used butternut squash from my garden instead of the pumpkin and it was perfect.

Very good! Added a little more than called for on spices, plus cloves. Delish! Used with basic flaky pie crust from allrecipes...also, mine took 15 minutes longer than stated to finish. Thank you!

This is a fantastic recipe and I always get great reviews for it (even requests!). My only suggestion is to use real pumpkin instead of canned, and it's still very easy to do. Simply cut a pumpkin in half, remove the seeds and bake in the oven for 30-45 minutes at 375 degrees. You'll know when it is done as the outer skin gets a dark orange. Let it cool, then remove the pulp and puree with a little water. Out of 1 pumpkin, I was able to make 5 pies the first round. I froze the other half and am making the rest for Thanksgiving dinner .

This was EASY and yummy, even my picky 6-year-old ate it! I substitute the canned pumpkin for 2 cups fresh though. The consistency of this pie is wonderful.

This is a decent pie. I used a graham crust and I took the advice of heating the pumpkin puree along with the salt and spices beforehand. I also added 1/4 tsp of cloves in addition to the other spices. Next time I will increase the spices a bit and add some white sugar to the mix

This pumpkin pie is delicious and so easy to make! It has great flavor and uses the perfect amount of spices. It's not bland and plain tasting like most pumpkin pies I've tasted. We used a cooked sugar pumpkin instead of the canned pumpkin and it was fantastic! I will definitely be making this for Thanksgiving dinner.

So I combined a few suggestions.  I used fresh ginger and heated the pumpkin with the spices before adding the milk and eggs and used a gram cracker crust.  WONDERFUL. A huge hit at this year's halloween party.  Next time I might make a homemade cinnamon whip cream.

I typically don't usually like pumpkin pies, but this recipe is delicious! I roasted a 4 pound sugar pie pumpkin and pureed the innards to make the pie filling and used organic sweetened condensed milk from Trader Joe's instead of my childhood favorite Eagle Brand...The Trader Joe's version tastes like it has less sugar in it, so I didn't have any problems with sweetness. Also, I baked the pie crust for a few minutes before adding the filling...If I hadn't I think the crust would have been undercooked and soggy... Oh, and I added 1/2 tsp of allspice and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, to give it a slightly "warmer" flavor. Everyone in the family loved it!

The pie itself is very sweet. Add whipped cream to that & it's just too much (& you HAVE to have whipped cream on pumpkin pie!). I'm giving it 3 for ease & the fact that it was edible just won't be making again.

This recipe was definitely than anything I've ever had. I used fresh pumpkin puree (made a surprising difference in taste!), but this recipe was definitely too sweet for me. I'm absolutely head-over-heels for pumpkin foods, but I didn't want anymore after one piece. It was probably the sweetened condensed milk. In the future I'll try using the same recipe and just substitute it for evaporated milk and see how that works out.

Sooooo easy and sooooo yummy!  This is the only pumpkin pie I make each Thanksgiving.  I've tried making special variations like pumpkin gingerbread pie; caramel apple pie; using a non-traditional graham cracker crust - don't do it.  For Thanksgiving, you're not just baking dessert, you're recreating fond memories.  Stick with the tried and true perfect pumpkin pie & you'll hear rave reviews from your guests.  Don't skimp on the whipped cream either.  This pie deserves fresh whipping cream & it only takes a few seconds to add vanilla & whip it up with a hand mixer.  Leave the spray can and tub at the store.

Ok, I did mess up the recipe a little bit.  Instead of sc milk, I accidentally threw in 12 oz of evaporated milk.  Oops.  So, to compensate I tossed in 3/4 cup white sugar.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  I took this to a friend and he & another guy devoured the whole pie before anyone else could even call dibs on a piece.  Apparently, it was pretty darn good.  ;)

I followed this recipe exactly 2 times on 2 different occassions and both times was let down, the crust was over cooked through out and there was a strange tough top layer on the pie.  I'll be going back to my old recipe....

This is THE only recipe I will make and eat. It is the recipe that my grandma used and would bake me little custard dishes since I didn't like the crust. I do not alter it at all because for me, it is absolute perfection.  For crust,  I get the Pillsbury ready made and form that in the pie plate. This recipe is super easy and wonderful!

I love pumpkin pie and I make it all the time. Out of the dozens of recipes I've tried this one knocks them all out.  It was so easy to make since it uses sweetened condensed milk instead of evaporated milk and sugar. I followed the recipe exactly although I do like my pie spicy so I did add a little extra nutmeg and also added cloves, and also topped it with a brown sugar streusal, It tasted great! It also had a wonderful, creamy texture. This one's a keeper for sure!

ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!! My husband is very picky with his pumpkin pies because his birthday sometimes falls on Thanksgiving and a pumpkin pie is his birthday cake every year. Usually his sister makes him a pumpkin pie for his birthday because she uses real pumpkin, not the canned stuff, which is what I use. The only thing I did different was use 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice which has all the spices you need. I made 6 of these pies through out the month of November (2 to test before Thanksgiving)...They turned out perfectly every time!! My husband even said that he preferred my pumpkin pies this year over his sister's pie that she made him for his birthday!! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING!!!

This recipe was fantastic and the whole pie was gone within minutes. I took the advice of others and baked the pie crust for a few minutes and I also heated the pumpkin and spices for a few minutes and let it cool before adding to the pie crust. The pie came out perfect and everyone loved it!

In my own side by side taste test (with the extra opinions of some co-workers)...this was a good pie, but if you want the BEST...go with the Libby's recipe instead.  It was creamier and packed a bigger punch.

This is my new favorite pumpkin pie! Delicious! & easy...I doubled the spices, by accident acutally. I think it would have been too bland if I didn't..I did not double the salt, just a little less than double...will make this again!

This was an easy and delicious pie.  As recommended by another reviewer, I heated the pumpkin, spices, and salt over low heat.  I set the mixture aside and let it cool before whisking in the condensed milk and egg.  I served it while it was still warm with some whipped cream and it was great!

I have been using this recipe for several years. It is so easy and scrumptious.  I always get raves and requests for the recipe.  The best pumpkin pie recipe I've encountered.  I make two very minor additions.  I add 1/4 tsp cloves and 1 tsp pure madagascar vanilla extract.  I place pecan halves around the outer rim of the pie as soon as I take it out of the oven.  Let is cool or serve barely warm with brandied whipped cream( 1 c. chilled whipping cream, 1 Tbsp. confectioners sugar and 2 tsp brandy(folded in after whipping) Sprinkle with a bit of nutmeg...Decedant!!

A great pumpkin pie!  I added 5 minutes to the cook time wanting to be sure the center wasn't too liquid and it turned out a little dry.  Totally my mistake.

Very good recipe, used 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice instead  of the ginger and nutmeg, then 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Instead of the unbaked pie crust, I used individual cracker crumb shells, and the results were wonderful. I was hesitant about using them, but they taste amazing. Thanks for the recipe.

So easy and perfect. I love the fact that I don't even need to use anything more than a wire whisk to prepare, yet I get astonished comments of "You made this yourself? Wow!" My mom has told me she will never buy another pumpkin pie from the store again after eating this.

This is the ONLY pumpkin pie recipe I use!  It is fast to whisk up and delicious.  The texture is smooth and creamy which I have always attributed to the condensed milk.  I do as other posters, and add just a touch more cinnamon.  This pie can't be beat!  And if it does crack... that's what whipped cream is for!

Trying out recipes for Thanksgiving...this worked great!  Husband couldn't wait to eat it...had it warm out of the oven and he said it was delicious and he could really taste the spices.  I didn't make any changes or additions to this recipe. I thought this tasted better than the Libby's recipe I usually make.

Okay, I am shockingly dissappointed with this pie.  I made it exactly as written and it was not bad, just okay. (It was made with The Best Ever Pie Crust from this site.) The reason why I was shocked was that I *assumed* with these ingredients it would be a home run. (Plus all of the 5 star ratings!) Maybe my expectations were set too high. Even my husband commented that it was "missing something." It had a good pumpkin flavor, but what was missing, I'm not really sure. More spices? Sugar? I'm still in search of a good homemade pumpkin pie. And I'm glad this was the trial run and not the actual Thanksgiving Pie!

I use the real pumpkin  instead of canned, just cut the carved pumpkin up, boil it down just like you are going to make mashed potatoes, drain all the water out and then freeze until you get ready to use it.

I also followed some previous reviews about cooking crust for 5 min before filling and also added 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice for more flavor.  This was by far, the best pumpkin pie I've ever made.

I have made this pie forever.  I always make several for Thanksgiving and I always make them the day before and then refrigerate them. They really seem extra creamy when this is done.  Topping with whipped cream is a must! Make this pie and I guarantee you will adore this too!

My entire family loved this pie. They even requested that I make it for Thanksgiving.   I did not pre bake the pie crust and it still came out perfectly cooked.  This pie tastes even better the next day.

This is a GREAT pie. For the first time we tried the graham cracker crust (homemade from a recipe here) and it was so good, not something you put up with like a pie crust. It melded with the filling and was so moist! We are making this again for Thanksgiving! (Made with homemade puree, turned out great!)

This was my first atempt at making pumpkin pie or any pie at all for that matter. It was really easy and turned out really good. It was exactly what I was looking for, I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing.

My 3 year old daughter said that we had to have a pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving because "the Care Bears had one at theirs."  Makes sense for a 3 year old.  No one in my family has ever liked pumpkin pie, but everyone raved about this one.  My daugther was so proud of her pumpkin pie.  Will make again this Thanksgiving.

So good that I will never buy store-made or frozen pumpkin pies again!  And very easy!  Make sure to heat up the pumpkin in a saucepan prior to using it so it gets the can taste out!

Okay, seemed a little tart, maybe if I added a little more sugar next time. It looked BEAUTIFUL though, I have never had a pumpkin pie turn out so nicely.

this recipe was just ok. i rated it four instead of three because it came out just like the reviews said, kinda fluffy almost. not the way I think of pumpkin pie. I think I'll stick with my tried and true pumpkin pie recipe.

Made exactly as written. I did have to cover the crust after 15 minutes. Then I had to cover the pie after 10 minutes because the top started burning. But, my oven cooks quickly. I am giving it four because although this was a very good recipe, I like my pumpkin pie to be sweeter. So, I will be looking for a better recipe if anyone knows of one. Thanks anyway.

To me, these tasted pretty much like any other pumpkin pie I've tasted. However, everyone else that tried it said it was awesome and asked for the recipe. Instead of the big pie, I used the mini graham cracker crusts for mini-pies. They came out cute and everyone ate them up real quick.

Excellent recipe!!  I decided to try a different pumpkin pie recipe this year just for fun, and this recipe was preferred to my old recipe, hands down!  I use fresh boiled pumpkin in my pies, and it worked beautifully!  My 5 year old picky son tried the pie because he helped me mix the ingredients and got a taste of the sweetened milk, and he literally ate a whole pie himself in 2 days!!!  I make about 4 pies at a time.  If my son will eat it, IT'S A WINNER!  Enjoy!!!

Excellent! I made two of these pie for Thanksgiving. I replaced the spices, except the cinnamon, with 2 tsp of Pumpkin Pie spice. As someone suggested I did add 1/2c  of light brown sugar and a touch of honey.  Your best bet is to taste the batter (I know a bad thing with raw eggs!) and if in your opinion it needs something...add it.  

Everyone raved over my pies, not a bite went to waste, and it has been requested that I make two more for Christmas.

you should have seen my Mother's face when i told her i was making both pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving with sweetened condensed milk rather than the normal evaporated milk!!  I had to try, but hadn't tried it out first and instead trusted all the reviewers to be dead on.  Well, the first pie was gone within minutes and there were only 7 of us, the second was gone by the third day and we were left wishing the choc. cream pie my Mom made was one of these pumpkin ones instead!!  Very good, will always use this recipe.  Thank U!

Delicious!  My 71 year old mother said this was the best pumpkin pie she'd ever tasted.  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and heated up the canned pumpkin and spices on low heat to get rid of the "canned" pumpkin taste.  I also baked the pie crust for 15 minutes at 350 degrees and let it cool before adding the pie filling to prevent it from getting soggy on the bottom.  This is an amazing pumpkin pie recipe!

The title says it all, this is the "perfect pumpkin pie". I made pumpkin pie last year using the pumpkin pie mix in a can and was very disappointed. This recipe however gave me hope and everyone who tried it loved it. This recipe is a keeper and I will be making it again and again years to come. The only additions I made to the recipe was that I added a tad bit more spices and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.

Very easy recipe to make.  I substituted a pre-made graham cracker crust instead of a regular pie crust.  Only suggestion is to pre-bake the crust...I didn't and it turned out soggy, but the pie was still really delicious.  I would recommend pre-baking whatever crust you use to avoid sogginess if you like a crispy crust with your pie.

I would give it a 4 1/2 stars. It had a good flavor but I prefer the Libby's recipe overall.

Awesome pie! I made it with a graham cracker crust, but I probably would've prefered a regular pastry crust. I found that 40 minutes was the perfect amount of time. Thanks for this simple recipe!

One of the best I have ever eaten. Pumpkin pie is something I love if it's good and hate if it's not so good.  I doubled the spices and it still wasn't quite right.  It also puffed up in the middle when it was cooking and fell after I took it out of the oven.  It wasn't very pretty.  This was my first attempt at this particular recipe and I will be making it again and again.  With some very, very slight tweaking, it will be MORE than 5 stars.

This pie is AWESOME! A huge Thanksgiving hit this year! Sorry to the condensed milk company LOL I did not use that brand I bought organic.

This is the first time a pumpkin pie has turned out well for me. I took the advice of another review and put extra cinnamon (1.5 tsps) all of the spices are perfect!

It didn't even crack well cooling. YAY!

I got this recipe off a can of milk 14 years ago when I first got married. Every Thanksgiving, I make 8 or 9 pies. We have a couple for dinner, and every family gets to take one home. Everyone looks forward to getting them, it's one of our favorite holiday traditions. I'd hate to see how they would react if I ever tried to change the recipe.

This pie is THE simplest pie to make (and eat)!  I would recommend this recipe to any newbie, as there are few ingrediants, instructions are easy to follow, and the results are amazing.  I made 4 of them for Thanksgiving dinner and each and every single one turned out exactly the same, despite quadrupling the recipe.  Perfect!

This was very good, but to my taste the texture was a bit too firm -- almost like it was jelled. Flavor was great, but I'll stick with my Joy recipe, which is almost a replica of the Libby's can, and results in flawless pies that never crack and are firm, but not gelatinous.

Very good!  I also subbed 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice for the nutmeg and ginger in recipe.  All else I kept the same.  I made this pie twice, once I did not precook the pumpkin from the can with the other spices, and this time I did precook it per another reviewer.  I thought they were great both times and really did not notice any difference.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I don't even like pumpkin pie, and I LOVE this recipe!  But because I can never resist experimenting in the kitchen, when I make it, I double the nutmeg and add 1/2 t. ground cloves and 1/2 t. vanilla.  Gorgeous!

I make this recipe every year using fresh pumpkin.  I always cook down my pumpkin from Halloween and freeze it.  It makes a very light pie.  Lots of times people who don't like traditional pumpkin pie will like this variation!  I use 2 teaspoons of McCormick pumpkin pie spice in place of the spices listed in the recipe.  Thanks, Eagle Brand!

Everyone loves this one!! It's a tradition now to make this pie at Halloween & Thanksgiving. I use egg-replacer instead of real eggs. I've made it with fresh pumpkin, canned pumpkin, and this year I made a mistake and made it with a can of pumkin pie filling (i.e. spices already added to pumpkin) plus I added the spices the recipe calls for. I thought it would be "too spicey" but everyone said it was the best yet!!

I've tried pumpkin pies several times before and only received "mediocre" reviews, however, when I tried THIS recipe on Thanksgiving, my family kept telling me that it was AWESOME!

This was great. Nice, thick filling. It didn't sink and get flat like pumpkin sometimes does. Also, I used a frozen pie crust and baked it according to the recipe and I the edges didn't burn like they usually do. Yummy.

Excellent!  I added a sprinkle of clove and and extra half teaspoon of cinnamon.  And took the suggestion to let it cool in the over (with the door open) - pie looks beautiful.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. It was very easy and I used a graham cracker crust to cut down the fat and calories. It was delicious.

The only thing I did was I used fresh nutmeg in this pie. It was easy to make and it came out absolutely perfect.  It was quick and effortless.

I roasted fresh pumpkin but followed the recipe exactly after that. Everyone loved it. I will definitely make this one again!

I followed the suggestions from other reviews and heated the pumpkin mixture first. I also used an extra 1/2 teaspoon of cinamon. It made the bigeest difference. My family's had both the original and this way and voted this the best.

This is the best!!  I did howevermake changes, especially after reading other reviews- I like a less spicy pie and some vanilla- I only used the teas. of cinnamon and not the other spices- I added a little brown sugar and a little white sugar- also a tablespoon of vanilla- I know that sounds like a lot but my pie was without a doubt the best pumpkin pie we had ever tasted--  I baked until you could tell at a glance that it was set- and used my crust covers to keep my crust perfect!  My husband's favorite is pumpkin pie and he was bragging to everyone about my pie!!  Easy even for a beginner!!

Perfect taste - I like the idea that there are no cloves in this pie. Will use again and again and again. The baking time was off but I'm sure it's the differences in ovens. Thanks!

The flavors of this pumpkin pie are great! I didn't rate it a 5 because I found it to be just a bit sweet for our tastes. I also just made the custard rather than as a pie (to cut calories). I made the filling and poured it into a 1qt corning ware dish put that in a baking pan in a hot water bath (surrounded by about 1 inch of warm water) and baked it at 325 for 45ish minutes! I've also tried the same recipe using evaporated milk instead of the condensed milk and adding 3 tab. sugar...very tasty and less caloric!!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving but by the time dinner was over no one had room for dessert!  I did like the texture and the overall ease of the recipe but I did as others suggested and added half again the spices and to my taste it was too much.  I will definitely make again but next time will follow the recipe more closely!

This was a very simple recipe.  Came out great.  I took the suggestion of another reveiwer to heat up the pumpkin from the can w/ the spices in a sauce pan before hand to release the canny taste, and that was great.  Also put some extra Cinnamon in there.  :)

The hole family loved it!!! I made three of them for thanksgiving and they were all gone by the end of the night.I did as others suggested and added an extra pinch of cinnamon and a little extra pumpkin. I also used fresh pumpkin.PS if you use fresh pumpkin make sure you let it sit and drain in a strainer for a while to let all the water drain out or your pie may end up with to much liquid in it.

My brother-in-law ate the whole thing. I love this recipe. I made a double-batch because I had a deep dish and it was super. I will never need another pumpkin pie recipe. It is just a hint spicier than most, to set it apart. Fabulous.

My father-in-law and my husband always say they hate pumpkin pie, saying it is too spicy or too pumkin-esque. So I made this pie thinking it could be mine. I was wrong and am planning on making my self a 2nd one to hide because they both gobbled it down, asked for more, and are suddenly big pumpkin fans.  Thanks for redeaming the pumpkin in my house!

Even with low fat sweetened condensed milk, it is the most delicious pumpkin pie I've ever had. The texture is awesome, unlike those other pumpkin pies that are mushy and running. This is so easy to make and so tasty!

I took the advice of others and heated the pumpkin and spices. The only other thing I changed was to add a quarter teaspoon of allspice and a teaspoon of vanilla to the filling.  The filling is thick (easier to get into the oven without sloshing), but be aware that if the surface is uneven when it goes into the oven, it probably won't smooth out much while baking.  Mine wasn't picture perfect, but no one seemed to care!

Was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner!  Very smooth, thought it was perfectly sweetened.  Made a few changes:  1.5 tsp of cinammon, 1 tsp of nutmeg, 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp of ground cloves.  Nicely spiced pumpkin pie!

I thought that this was a really easy and really tasty recipe.  It's not the best I've had but for my first time making pumpking pie, it worked well.  For those reviewers that said it made enough for two pies, I think you probably used the wrong sized can of pumpkin.  Make sure you get the 15 oz can and it's perfect.  That might be the case for those that said it wasn't sweet/spicy enought too.

This pie was VERY easy and tasted pretty good, but not THE BEST pumpkin pie I have ever had. I only made this one pie, and there were a few pieces left at our family Thanksgiving gathering. Not a good sign since there were 9 huge, food loving adults there along with 5 children.

This pie was just okay.  Both my husband and I felt that it was simply lacking something.  It fell short on flavor, sweetness, and, as some mentioned, it was a little gritty.  Not a bad pie, but nothing special, and I think I'll keep searching for a better recipe.

I first must begin by praising this website.  I've been coming here for a few years but never registered until now.  I've found some awesome recipes here but this one.. ( perfect Pumpkin Pie ) finally inspired me to join.

This recipe is simply the best!!  In the past my pumpkin pies have been OK but I wanted to try something different this year.  So I did a taste test two nights ago making this pie and the libby pie.  This one won hands down!  Right now I've got two more in the oven for tomorrows thanksgiving meal.  I make it as is with no addition.  I can't imagine adding more sugar.  For our family this has it all.  5 stars all the way.  Easy to prepare excellent taste.  A bit of advice... tastes bests chilled.  Dense in consistency and perfect blend of spices.

This was the easiest pie I have  ever made! If you are looking for a quick pie to whip up, this is definitely your recipe. And it was delicious, as well. I brought it in for a 5th grade class that was having a Thanksgiving celebration, and every one of them loved it. They ate 2 pies and were looking for more. Thanks for the 'perfect pumpkin pie' recipe - I know I will be making many more of them during the holidays.

This is a great pumpkin pie recipe as is, but the second time I made it I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, half as much ginger and just a couple dashes of nutmeg.  YUM!  Fabulous for Thanksgiving and SO easy!

the base for what could be a very good pie. definitely needs improvement though. when i made it as directed, it had very little taste. i added more pumpkin, spices, and even a bit of brown sugar, it was much better. i actually had some pumpkin butter on hand, which, because of its concentrated pumpkin flavor, helped majorly. i would use this recipe again, but only with the adjustments i made.

This pumpkin pie ROCKS!  I added about 1/8 tsp. of cloves along w/ the other spices, and used fat free sweetened condensed milk.  I highly recommend it!!!!!

My first pumpkin pie! Or rather, my first miniature pumpkin pies. Instead of a 9 inch crust, I bought six mini graham cracker crusts. I cooked the pumpkin, spices and salt like another reviewer mentioned and doubled the spices (I also added some nutmeg). They were in the oven for about 20 minutes. I took them out when they started to brown. I just had a bite and it tastes great! Sweet and spicy. I can't wait for my boyfriend to get home so he can try one too!

This is one of the better pumpkin pie recipes.  I baked it about 10 minutes or so longer than the recipe called for. It's nice to have just the right amount of spices in a pumpkin pie (in my opinion too many bakers over-spice their pies) and using the sweetned condensed milk gave the pie a richer flavor. My mom said it was better than hers! The pie lasted about 20 minutes.

I agree that this could use more spices, BUT I liked that it tasted like pumpkin and not a mouth full of spices. I like the texture created when using sweetened condensed milk better than when using evaporated milk. It also makes it not as liquid, so it's easier to get into the oven without spilling! I'll be using this recipe from now on just pumping up the spices a tiny bit.

This is the recipe I found on the web when I was trying my first pumpkin pie, it was on a different site and called Magic Pumpkin Pie. When I made it I had no idea that traditionally evaporated milk is used. When I tasted it, I thought it really was magic because it tasted SO much better than the average pumpkin pie. It's a lot more fattening too, but sometimes you just have to splurge and this recipe makes it worth it. The sweetened condensed milk makes a much smoother, denser, more decadent pie and elimates the need to add suger, it is perfectly sweetened, sometimes the recipe makes too much for a store bought pie crust. I microwave the leftovers for 1 min. and eat them warm out of the bowl, yum!

This was a great pie. I used a homemade pie crust and real pumpkin for this recipe. The texture was a little off due to the fact that I didn't "puree" the pumpkin. Next time I will use canned pumpkin or be sure to puree my fresh pumpkin. The taste is wonderful when using something that isn't out of a can! I will be making this again and serving for the Holiday dinner!

This makes a terrific pumpkin pie with lots of flavor and just right on the spiceiness. Really easy to make this one, I used egg beaters and you couldn't tell any difference from real eggs. Yep, it's a perfect pumpkin pie alright!

This is a traditional pumpkin pie recipe. Although it turned out perfectly, one thing I will say is that it tasted basically like every pumpkin pie I've ever had, which is a good thing and a bad thing. I like my desserts to stand out above the rest, and this just tasted like your standard, run-of-the-mill pumpkin pie. Which, we all know pumpkin pies are GREAT, but I prefer something a little different when serving food to guests. I'd like them to be able to tell my cooking and frozen pie / Kroger bakery cooking apart.  =] I did use the pumpkin pie spice in lieu  of all the individual spices and it turned out fine. I probably will make again, but I'll find something else to take with it. Thanks for the recipe.

The first pumpkin pie I've ever made... we've always settled for bakery-bought. I will NO MORE! This truly is the "perfect" pumpkin pie. No frills... nothing fancy. Just the perfect slice of that pumpkin pie you remember having as a child. Perfect!

This pie was very quick and easy. I did add about one fourth of a cup of brown sugar to the mixture before baking to give it a little sweeter taste. But I also have a huge sweet tooth!

This was the best pumpkin pie I have ever had.  I can't believe it never occurred to me to use sweetened condensed milk instead of the evaporated that so many recipes call for.  The filling was so creamy and dense and just wonderful.  I will definitely be switching out my old go to recipe for this one!

This was fantastic! I used fresh, cooked pumpkin and the pie was gone in hours. I didn't know how to cook pumpkin, but got the info on this site in the "how to" section and I'm glad I did.  It was fun and easy! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I made two of these for a party and they were both gone within minutes. People loved these! The only thing I would suggest is a little more spice all around. I think it was great, just needing a little more "umph."

The name says it all!  This was a very easy recipe.  This was the first time I made pumpkin pie and my 74 yr old mother said, 'I've had a lot of pumpkin pie over the years and this is the best I've ever had'!!  
Thank you for making my first pie so memorable!!

This recipe was a bit sweet for me. Next time, I will only use 1/2 cup of sweeten condensed milk.  Instead of the other spices, I used 2 teaspoons of pumpkin spice.  I also used the ready made unbaked Graham Cracker crust.  It was a bit sweet. Despite the sweetness, this was a great recipe.  Easy and fast to make.

I doubled the recipe and used a deep dish frozen pie crust. Then I covered the edges while it baked and it came out perfectly. Great recipe!

Pumpkin pie shouldn't be hard... and this recipe is NOT!  So easy!  This was the first time I made a pumpkin pie (Grandma use to do it) and I decided to bake is right after the turkey came out of the oven.  When we were ready to have dessert the pie was still warm (I've always eaten it cool) and I preferred it, especially with cold Cool Whip on top.  YUM!  The only thing I might do differently is add a pinch more of all the spices - but not too much more.

I served this pie for dessert on Thanksgiving.It was very easy and quick to make. My guests really liked it but I thought it needed more spices as others have said. I am not one who likes a strong flavored pumpkin pie as I like the flavor of the pumpkin but this needed more. Maybe half again the amount. I will definetly make it again just with more spices.

Excellent!  Even my picky mother gave this pie two thumbs up.  It only takes about 5 minutes to prep.  I increased the amount of seasoning (all fresh) and added pumpkin seasoning and it was excellent.  The best pumpkin pie I have ever had.  This is definitely a keeper.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and didn't change one thing and it came out perfect. I don't know why people have said it was bland because I believe it was far from bland, in fact I thought it may have been to spicy until after it was cooled for a few hours in the fridge and it turned out perfect. A few people in my husbands family claimed they never liked pumpkin pie but helped themselves to seconds on this one. I also brought an extra pie to my Husbands precent on Thanksgiving night and all the cops were licking their plates clean looking for more!! This recipe will be our traditional pumpkin pie every Thanksgiving and Christmas!

Came out like your traditional pumpkin pie. I think however that the pie should be left in the oven alittle longer. I cooked it to exact times, and my oven is fairly new, and came out alittle on the moist mushy side.

My husband could barely wait for the pie to cool before eating a piece.  We used fresh pureed pumpkin (which had been boiled and mashed) and 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice, 1 tsp. of cinnamon and a few sprinkles of allspice.  Next time I may try adding even a little more spices.

I had never made a pie in my life and chose this recipie. It was easy and fun and a smash hit at the big family Thanksgiving feast. I used pyrex glass pans and the Pillsbury crust from the dairy case. My sister's mother-in-law thought I made the crust from scratch!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving, and I amazed myself as well as my family.  It turned out perfectly.  It looked dense, but tasted light and airy.  The amount of spices were perfect.  I know for a fact that I'm terrible at making pie crusts, so I cheated and used a frozen pie crust from Pillsbury - the kind that come in a box, and you just roll them out.  I got creative with the leftover dough cut from around the edges, so I made a decorative crust that looked like leaves, all the way around.  It was really the most beautiful pie I've ever made, I even took a picture!  Topped with fresh whipped cream, this recipe was to die for!

Very good basic recipe for pumpkin pie.  The can of condensed milk makes it sweet enough without all the hassle of measuring sugar; just open can and pour.  I noted the comments of others and baked this pie for the minimum baking period; I might bake a little longer next time in my oven.  Felt the the filling never fully came together in the baking process but maybe just me being critical.  Definitely increase the spices if you prefer a spicier pie; I used 2 tsp. of fresh (this is important---spices only last so long) pumpking pie spice and 1 1/2 tsps. cinnamon.

Lived up to it's name! Everything was perfect: Taste, texture, color, etc. I was a bit apprehensive as I have always used evaporated milk in my pumpkin pie (not sweetened). I thought this might be too sweet but it was wonderful. Here is my new pumpkin pie recipe!

VERY YUMMY!!  Deffinatly the PERFECT pumpkin pie!!!  This recipie will replace my old recipie for now on!! My whole family raved over it!  The Condensed Milk made a big difference in the texture of the pie which was nice and thick and rich!  MUCH better then recipies with the evaporated milk!  It cooked easier and I didn't have to "recook" when the center was runny like i have had to do each time with the evaporated milk!  Be sure to get a DEEP dish pie shell or be prepared with a SECOND pie dish!

Really good and very easy to make. I added almost twice the amount of spices as other reviewers suggested and it was fine. Seemed to take a bit longer to cook than it was supposed to.

Very good. My 11 year old made this pie and it came out beautiful.  He covered the crust with foil.  One thing though, was a bit sweet, so next pie will have 1/4 cup more pumpkin puree.  This is a definate keeper.

One of the best homemade pumpkin pies I've had for flavor, texure and color. I would have added a bit more spice and baked it for a few minutes less for a creamier texture.

Absolutely divine!!  My son is a pumpkin pie lover (10y.o.).  He loves the filling/custard, not the crust.  What I have started doing is adding a 1/2 to 1 cup of biscuit mix to the filling and pouring it all into a pyrex dish.  It gives the filling a more bread pudding texture, but it still has a wonderful pumpkin pie flavor.  I used 2 cups fresh cooked pumpkin with this recipe and 1 cup biscuit mix.  I let my son make/mix it up and he was "doubly" proud of his creation.  All we needed extra was a dollop of whip cream!

If you like traditional pumpkin pie, you'll like this.  It had great flavor, nice texture, and very creamy.

Just as the name suggests, this is the perfect pumpkin pie. Not only is it tastey, but it is so easy to make.
I had a potluck and instead of using the filling for a pie, I used mini tart shells instead. It filled 36.

THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PUMPKIN PIE.  I DON'T NORMALLY LIKE IT BUT I AND EVERYBODY ELSE LOVED THIS ONE.  I HAD PEOPLE ASKING ME TO MAKE IT AGAIN AND AGIAN.  I DID USE PUMPKIN PIE FILLING INSTEAD OF PUREE AND IT IS AWESOME!!!

I have made this pie for 10 years and it is awesome!  I use fresh pumpkin and it makes a huge difference.  I add a bit more cinnamon & nutmeg, I also add 1/4 tsp of ground cloves.  On Thanksgiving & Christmas, everyone calls to make sure I make a few more pies than I did the year before.  We call it "Pumpkin Mousse Pie, because it's so rich and creamy!

I made this pie last minute yesterday for my Thanksgiving dinner.  It was delicious, and I got a lot of compliments.  I think I forgot to add the salt, but it was good anyway!  I first made pumpkin tarts with this fluffy pumpkin mixture, but I decided at the last minute (like 3 pm last minute) that I really wanted a traditional pumpkin pie so I searched frantically on All Recipes knowing that I owned a regular frozen pie crust -- not a deep dish like most of the pumpkin pie recipes call for.  This pie was perfect, and it really does taste homemade.

Hello! Loved it! I doubled the recipe last night and took one to work- of course I'm the coolest person right now for all the "hard" work I put into it. My pies came out perfect, although I maybe should have cooked 5 more minutes or so but was afraid I'd burn my crust. That's ok, I'm making 4 more tonight for Thanksgiving- my family thanks you from the bottom of our stomach!

this was really good and so simple. I added a bit of honey and a bit more seasoning. here's a tip, add the eggs last so you can taste it until  you are happy with it. I made mine crustless since I can't eat gluten. I sprayed a casserole pan with oil and baked it according to the recipe. I served it like a pudding with gluten free vanilla wafers.

I improvised quite a bit with this recipe and followed a few suggestions. I used a Graham cracker crust. I also heated up the pumkin sauce with some water for about 5 minutes on a low simmer, added the salt and spice, and heated that for a few more minutes. I then cooled it a bit in the freezer, added the milk and eggs, and added more salt and spice till I was satisfied with the taste. Then, put that on 350F for about 35-45 minutes. And refrigerated it to cool it some. It was a hit!

I always use this recipe, everyone loves it. I use pumpkin that I cooked down myself. Instead of ginger and nutmeg I use 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice along with the teaspoon of cinnamon.

The easiest pumpkin pie to make. This was my first time ever to make a pumpkin pie or any pie for that matter. Mild in taste and came out of the oven so beautiful! I was very proud of myself and grandbaby because she helped to. I'm about to make another one today.

I made this pie according to the recipe exactly and it's DELICIOUS. This will be my go-to pumpkin pie from now on. I cheated and bought the ready-to-bake Pillsbury crust and topped it with heavy whip cream. 10/10 pie.

My first time making a pumpkin pie. It got great reviews! Easy and very yummy. I blind baked a thawed store bought crust. I did cook the pumpkin and spices per one of the suggestions in another review. Not sure if it matters because I have never made it, but it was easy to do so I figured I may as well.

This pie was amazing. It was my first attempt making a pie and it turned out perfect! I did mesh a bunch of the suggestions together. I used 1.5 cans of pumpkin puree and heated it with spices on the stove before adding the sweet condensed milk and eggs.  I used all the spices, plus added some pumpkin spice seasoning and cinnamon. I just kept adding to taste while heating on the stove. The sweetened condensed milk made the pie plenty sweet. I used a frozen pie crust, allowed it to thaw as instructions on package suggested, used a fork to poke holes throughout pie crust, and baked the crust for 10 minutes before adding the filling. And tented foil while baking to prevent crust from burning. Beyond pleased with the results!

This is the easiest, best pumpkin pie I have ever made! I think it is the sweetened condensed milk. It is smooth and has just the right spices. I used whole nutmeg and baked it the full 40 minutes when temperature changes. I did cheat and use a refrigerator crust bought at the store....

This recipe has a really good flavor. I added a bit more cinnamon and I like cloves and nutmeg so I used them also. I found the pie to be perfectly sweetened. Maybe some of the reviewers accidently used evaporated milk. I baked it on "Ruth's Grandma's  Pie Crust" recipe from this site (the only pie crust I make now).

My boyfriend loves pumpkin pie and said this is the best he's ever had. I have to agree. Typically I don't love pumpkin pie, but this recipe is creamy and delicious. This will be my go-to holiday recipe from now on.

Love it. Baked it yesterday and took some of it with me to a gathering of girlfriends today.  They all loved it and said it was like candy.  Made it just like the recipe said but I would blind bake the crust a bit next time before I think that would mean it slight better.

I add 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Best tasting pumpkin pie I have ever tasted. Even my kids who have never liked it gobbled it down. Made 2 for Thanksgiving and they didnt last! My husband loved it as well!

Nice enough, but a bit bland. Needs stronger spices, so I added a tsp of fresh grated ginger along with 1/2 tsp of ground ginger.   I used fresh ground nutmeg instead of ground powdered nutmeg. That did the trick.

I have made 7 of these and the first had an error that ruined it. But it  was purely my fault... I used Evaporated Milk instead of Sweetened condensed milk. It was a pretty looking but bland mess.

 You do not need to add sugar as the condensed milk is plenty sweet. 

 Another person overcooked their pie and blamed it on the recipe and this is just wrong... two cooking temps and if you do not lower to 350 when advised it will burn.

 You can be a bit flexible with the recipe and it's pretty rugged.  

 I used 3 medium eggs instead of 2 large and it came out fluffier.

 You will want to be sure to blend properly or you may get patches of seasoning...

My pie did rise slightly but it came down as I cooled it  and I used a non traditional pie crust... Graham cracker pre filled from the dollar store.

 You won't want to over bake or the crust can get hard... 

I will add 4 pix at the end if it will let me.

I followed the recipe exactly using a pre-made graham cracker crust. It was delicious! I LOVE pies, pumpkin being one of my favorites, and this one was the best I have ever tasted. It was soooo creamy and moist with excellent flavor.  Everyone at Thanksgiving loved this pie.  Just make it!!!!!

I really liked this pie. I did follow the advice of others to use pumpkin pie spice, and cinnamon I could have added more cinnamon, but over all it was good. I did follow some other's advice about baking the crust first, bad idea it shrunk my crust, but over all everyone enjoyed it!

Super easy, very quick, and really good. As some others suggested, I used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and about 1.5 tsp of cinnamon. I did not use the nutmeg. I heated the pumpkin & spices on very low heat, let it cool then added the sweetened condensed milk and eggs. Mixed together and poured into the shell. First time I used a premade pie shell which I did NOT prebake, just egg washed, and the other time I used the 9in Graham cracker crust. I liked to Graham cracker crust the best.

I heated the canned pumpkin with the spices and then let it cool off to room temperature before making the filling in order to eliminate the canâs taste.

I followed this recipe perfectly....however, I felt something was missing, but couldnt figure out what, until the pie finished cooking. It took 15min longer to cook, and, the recipe is missing sugar. This pie taste so bland and nothing like pumpkin pie, it's disgusting. I hope the store is open thanksgiving morning, so I can get another can of pumpkin pie, and make again, Correctly.

Made a dairy-free version of this recipe by subbing the condensed milk with coconut condensed milk (same amount). Also added 1/2 teaspoon allspice and an extra teaspoon of cinnamon. Turned out perfect!

Turned out beautiful. Havenât tasted yet as itâs for thanksgiving! Didnât bake at higher temp for 15 min but upped the 350Â° cooking time until the pie poofed up like a dome and wasnât runny anymore! That was about 45 minutes. Will definitely use this recipe again. Bad reviews must not follow directions well!

I thought this was a delicious pie! I did make a few changes, though. First, definitely warm up the pumpkin purÃ©e and spices in a separate pot to really mix the flavors and to help get rid of the canned taste. I also recommend making your own pie crust. I made a simple flour, butter, spices crust and it turned out perfectly! Also, with the crust, I would pre-bake for at least 10 minutes. I also added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon for some extra flavor. I also made a homemade whipped cream with heavy cream, sugar, cinnamon, clove, ginger, nutmeg, and a little bit of vanilla extract. It was the perfect touch!

I used fresh pumpkin not canned that I had cooked a week ago. So it is more liquid. I added flour, extra teaspoon cinnamon, and substituted pumpkin pie spice.

Iâve made this recipe about 4 times and it is delicious.  I make it in a deep dish pie plate.  I use fresh pie pumpkin which yields about 2 cups purÃ©ed pumpkin and add 1/4 tsp ground cloves to the mixture.  This is my go-to recipe for pumpkin pie.

I doubled the recipe, added allspice and pumpkin pie spice, and I made it in an 18" x 13" baking pan. 

This is my favorite pumpkin pie recipe!

Awesome pumpkin pie! I always doctor up any recipe plus I wanted to make two pies so hereâs the changes that I made: 
30 oz canned pumpkin
1 can Eagle Brand milk
3 eggs
4 tsp pumpkin spice
2 tsp cinnamon
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 C brown sugar
1 tsp salt
Prepped by warming the pumpkin and spices as per other suggestions. And then baked at 425 for 15 minutes, then 350 for 30 minutes. I then turned the oven off and left the pies on the rack for an additional 10 minutes. Enjoy!

I add 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves and slow heat everything in a pot over low-medium heat until everything is liquefied. Pour promptly into pie crust and bake normally.

I find that this removes the metal can taste and reflects that fresh cooked pumpkin taste.

Easy to make and a pretty good pie. Not much better than a store bought pie though.

I used egg whites instead of whole eggs (a carton of organic "365" brand from Whole Foods):  1/3 cup plus 1 TB = 2 large eggs, so I used 1/3 cup egg whites, then added one whole egg to get the yolk in there.  I whipped the egg whites, then added the condensed sweetened milk, then added the other ingredients.  I also used a pumpkin, rather than a can of pumpkin puree, and it turned out more liquidy and a much larger batch.  I filled two pie crusts with it, and the pies came out DELICIOUS.  Even the teenager was licking her chops (of course, I also supplied whipped cream and ice cream to sweeten the deal).  This was a great recipe and will go in my permanent file!  There's nothing else quite like pumpkin pie.

It really did taste like something I would eat on Thanksgiving and tasted exactly like pumpkin pie. Although the top was strange because it had made a strange soft/hardened past. Besides that it was great!

I adjusted it, and if I hadnât it would have been too sweet for me. I tasted as I added the sweetened condensed milk and stopped at 10 oz, which was plenty sweet for me. I also used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and a sprinkle of nutmeg. I prefer the normal Libbyâs recipe (with less milk and sugar), but this was fine and even easier (the other is really extremely easy too). I am not likely to make this again though.

Very easy to make. I loved how it came out, but was just a little bit too sweet. Next time I'll probably use less of condensed milk.

I made this  pie today with the following changes:
Added 1/2 tsp allspice
Added 1/2 tsp pure vanilla
Followed another reviewer's advice and heated the pumpkin and spices prior to adding the sweetened condensed milk and eggs.  Wonderfully blends the pumpkin with the spices.  Great recipe!!

I use this recipe over and over and I get the best compliments on it but, more importantly, my nine year old grandson calls it " nanna's best pie ever" and that is good enough for me to continue making it all the time.

This was good. A little more on the creamy side then the pumpkin side and I used a frozen crust which came out kind of soggy. Iâll have to make this one again with different crust.

Super simple and tasty! I recommend par- baking the crust for 5 minutes. It helps give a solid foundation for the pie batter. Let it cool thoroughly before messing with it. Helps make sure the batter sets correctly and doesn't split.

I have a confession, I hate pumpkin everything, but my family loves it. I made this pie for the first time last week & am now making another one because my family & my daughter's friend devoured the first one. I heard a lot of "this is the best pumpkin pie I've ever had", "when are you making this again?", "I can't stop thinking about that pie". Needless to say, this is the best recipe & I now have to make it weekly. Thank you for this recipe!

Very good recipe, but I used unsweetened coconut cream due to an allergy. Cooked the coconut cream with 2/3 c sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and a pinch of salt. Then, using other reviewers' suggestions, cooked the pumpkin and spices together, let cool, then mixed in eggs. Mine needed a longer cook time to properly set, but was delicious. Note, I also added 1/4 tsp Allspice to the pumpkin mixture with the other spices. My kids loved it and requested me to make another!

Probably the best, if not the best, pumpkin pie if ever had! The only thing I changed was adding 1/2 more of a teaspoon of cinnamon. I had a bit of extra filling which could be used to make mini pies. It was great, eaten within a day!

Everyone here loves this recipe. Pies come out full of flavor. I usually do like another reviewer mentioned and put pumpkin and spices in a pan on stovetop to warm before mixing with milk and eggs. I also like to use a Grahm cracker pie crust. In our electric stove it is usually 15 minutes on 425 and then 44 minutes at 350

It needs sugar or something. It had no sweetness. I followed the directions exactly. It cooked perfectly.  The flavor was not sweet at all. 2 stars just because it cooked perfect.

I loved it!!!!! Super tasty. My tip is to be extra careful when placing your pie in the oven because the mixture fills the crust all the way to the top!

Be sure to follow the directions exactly as to not undercook. The pie turned out lovely with a nice shiny top. I used McCormickâs Pumpkin Pie Spice and added ginger powder and extra cinnamon powder. Then, I topped it off with real whipped cream in order to boost sweetness.

This pie was a HIT !!

I heated up the pumpkin with the spices, waited for it to cool down before mixing with the eggs & eagle brand.
Topped with whipped cream.

I used store bought shells and this recipe made enough for 2 pies for me. We didnât have any ginger or nutmeg and it tasted just fine. My biggest problem with this was the bottom crust was severely undercooked. Crust definitely needs to be precooked before filling is added. Also I put foil around edges at 15 minutes in, otherwise outer crust wouldâve been burnt.

It doesn't actually require that one specific brand, all you need is any sweetened condensed milk. (cream doesn't work, though, I tried)

Delicious - the sweetend condensed milk gave the pie a great consistency.  I added a bit more pumpkin spice to accommodate my familyâs taste.

Pumpkin pie is my husband's favorite so I make these pies quite often. This couldn't be easier, especially using a store bought crust. I highly recommend a shortbread crust if you can find it!

Savory.  I made it with 15 oz of fresh pumpkin and 2 tsp of homemade pumpkin pie spice, and blended all of the ingredients in a blender.  Savory and smooth without being too sweet.

My husband is a huge pumpkin pie aficionado,  and to deviate from his "preferred" recipe is to invite disaster!  That being said, I didn't have any evaporated milk on hand yesterday so I came across this recipe and figured I would give it a go.  I must admit that I changed the spices a bit because - like some other posters - I like my pumpkin pie with cloves, nutmeg and allspice in the mix, along with the cinnamon and ginger.  Otherwise, I left it like it's written.  It was a HUGE hit with my husband, who never noticed any lack of sweetness or complained about texture.  In fact, he RAVED over the pie!  I cooked it per instructions, however, my pie was done MUCH sooner than the recommended time, so I removed it to my counter (I live on the coast of Ecuador and it's just beginning summer here, so no worries about "cold air" cracking the top!)  I did use fresh pumpkin that I steamed, we don't have anything like canned pumpkin here!  Anyhow - it's a huge success and now my go-to pie recipe!

I followed the receipe except that I mistakenly used evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed milk. To remedy this oversight, I added 1/3 cup of white sugar to the pie filling. It turned out great: not too sweet.

I used the filling recipe for mini pumpkin pies in the shape of pumpkins. I just used a cookie cutter and cut pumpkins and then put a rounded table spoon on the bottom and then one top with some egg wash to bind them together. Turned out amazing!!! I also made a traditional pumpkin pie and turned out very good as well!

So yummy!! Has turned out perfectly each time Iâve made this recipe. I use two 9-inch regular pie crustsâif you use a deep dish pie crust this recipe will fill a single 9-inch crust. No changes made, just some whipped topping added once itâs cooled & refridgerated! My husband is a dedicated pumpkin pie critic & had only good things to say about this recipe. Hooray!!

I added a little more of the spices, used a graham cracker crust, and split the recipe between two crusts. After they were baked and cooled, I topped them with a box of no-bake cheesecake made by the instructions on the box. Made my own whipped cream and sprinkled with graham crackers to serve. It was legend.... wait for it.... DARY.

I'm not sure what happened to my pie but, it was more like pumpkin pudding rather than a pie, for some reason it didn't gel, I'm not sure what went wrong but the taste was spot on it was a consistency issue.

I donât make pumpkin pies often, so this review looked good based on the reviews. It was a huge disappointment. After looking up other recipes and comparing, I realized this one didnât turn out because of the lack of sugar.

Whoever  thinks this is a good pumpkin pie has never had one. Pumpkin pie is not health food... it is a dessert...it needs sugar.
This recipe is for a pumpkin flavored quiche. Please for all that is holy do not make this travesty. Nice try Eagle Brand Condensed milk review writers.

I Asked the Community for tips on baking the pie in a store-bought graham cracker crust and followed Bookie's advice to bake at 400 for 10 minutes, then at 350 for 40 to 45 minutes. It turned out beautifully.

The 5 minute in-oven cool down that a couple of reviewers recommended helped the pie finish setting without cracking. I already knew to pour the mixture into the crust already on a baking sheet on the oven rack.

I doubled the spices, added 1/4 tsp. cloves and a few drops of vanilla (same amount of salt). I whisked it all together by hand

I didn't expect the crust to turn out crunchy, so people who are going for that with a graham cracker crust should stick with a no-bake recipe rather than this one.

Such a simple and tasty recipe! I used some of the suggestions I found in the comments and replaced the cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger with 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice, as well as heating the pumpkin, spices, and salt on the stove, then letting them cool before adding the eggs and milk. this pie turned out delicious.

This was easy and very good. There were about 5 different pumpkin pies at my family dinner and this one by far got the most compliments. I followed the suggestion on subbing in pumpkin pie spice plus one tsp of cinnamon and it was great. Also followed another tip of adding pumpkin and spices to a pan and melding the flavors together before adding eggs and condensed milk. I believe this made a huge difference although it made the filling darker. I used graham cracker crust and felt it was a little too sweet, Iâll try again with a basic pie crust. Looking forward to making this one again.

My first pumpkin pie! I made this with homemade crust. I followed previous reviewer suggestions of cooking the spices and pumpkin together for a few minutes before  putting it in the shell. I also upped the spices to a full teaspoon each. I used nutmeg, cardamom, cinnamon and ginger. This piece came out great, and so easy to make!

This recipe was delicious! When I made the pie I accidentally bought the âLibbyâs Easy Pumpkin Pie Mixâ so this purÃ©e already had seasonings in it, but I used it anyway. I followed the recipe exactly but halved the spices. It turned out fantastic. Everyone absolutely loved it.

I made the recipe as written for Thanksgiving and give it 5 stars.  Today I made a 2nd one warming the canned pumpkin with the spices - using 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp of cinnamon as suggested in some reviews.  I preferred the one with the recipe as written.

I was unable to find the 15 oz. can of pumpkin, so used the 29 oz. can and doubled the ingredients, except for the spices.  After reading the other reviews, used 3 teaspoons of a homemade pumpkin spice recipe and added an additional teaspoon of cinnamon.  Heated the pumpkin with the spices and cooling before pouring into two 9" crust that was pre-baked for 10 minutes.  Baked the pies as directed and it came out perfectly.   Taste is mellow compared to the store bought pies, but perfect for my husband's taste.

I made this recipe for several people who ordered pies for Thanksgiving from me. I used McCormickâs pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon instead of the spices listed. I also heated up the pumpkin along with the pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon before adding the other ingredients. Pies came out perfect.

Being new to baking, I bought the pumpkin pie spice. I just added 2teas of the spice instead of the individuals and I think it turned out great.

Super easy and very few ingredients. I substituted the individual spices with pumpkin pie spice.

This was hailed as the best pumpkin pie my brother in law had ever eaten despite the fact that I forgot the salt! And added 1/4 cup of Aldi's apple butter because I couldn't eat any more of it. 

I doubled the recipe, and they were almost overflowing in the crusts, but set up perfectly, no cracking. It was a simple and delicious recipe that I'll likely make again!

Absolutely delicious! It has replaced my old recipe and needs no tweaking! I used a homemade pie crust with it, and it was fabulous.

Hands down this was the best pumpkin pie Iâve made. Everyone agreed that the texture (itâs so creamy) and flavor was absolutely delicious. This will be my go to recipe from now on.

It is SO easy!! My only  issue is the mix always has more than the crust can handle. I end up throwing out about half a cup of mixture.

Edit: years later, I realized I was not using deep dish crust. My bad. All is well!!

Always remember itâs the quality of the ingredients you put in that gives you the end results... the recipe is easy to follow.. foolproof, and I had good results, enjoyed the pie, and of course tweaked my spices for the preferences of my familyâs tastes..  itâs a great read recipe.. ????

Happy Thanksgiving everyone! I have almost  always used this recipe. It is tried and true and comes together very quickly. I used a ready-made Pillsbury pie crust this year; the kind you unroll into your own pie plate. It did take a bit longer to bake to have the center set - around 12 extra minutes. The only change I made was to add 1/4 tsp of finely ground black pepper to the spice mix. That's the latest "secret ingredient" for pumpkin desserts  around here. It doesn't make it peppery at all. If you have ever had black Chai tea, that also has black pepper in it but you can't taste it really. No, it doesn't give the pie any sort of chai taste, just some added depth of sweet-spiced flavor. If you like a spicier, quite sweet pumpkin pie, this is your recipe, especially if you add just that little pinch of pepper.

This recipe is missing some serious sweetness to it. Once i added a few tablespoon of sugar it tasted soooo much better. Taste the batter before placing it in the oven to make sure it taste like you won't it.

This is so tasty! The family loves it. I do heat up the pumpkin with the spices. If I cool it for 20 minutes in the oven then move to a cooling rack on the stove, it looks perfect.

Only thing I did different was add molasses. It gives it a richer texture and adds a little more flavor that's not overwhelming the other flavors of the pie ??

I made this pie 3 times in the past week. All my friends loved it! I changed the recipe a little and added 1/4 of brown sugar to add a little sweetness. I also heated up the canned pumpkin and its spices as recommended, and it really got rid of the canned pumpkin taste. Highly recommend this recipe!

This was not nearly sweet enough and also needed more spices I think.  My family loves pumpkin pie and we have tried a few recipes.  Right away everyone agreed something was missing.  It was sugar!  I thought it was odd that there was no sugar in this recipe but with the sweetened milk I assumed it was ok.  It wasnât.  Will go back to my old recipe.

I have made this Pumpkin Pie and used this recipe for 3+ years now, and will never go back to any other!  I love that it's sweet and rich enough for me to add the extra spices that I enjoy without overpowering the pumpkin flavor.  I do add 1tsp vanilla, and my own spin on the spices is; 2tsp McCormick Pumpkin Pie Spice, 2tsp cinnamon, 1/4tsp nutmeg, and 1tsp allspice. I also always sprinkle the bottom of the crust with a dusting of powdered sugar before adding the mixture to prevent a soggy crust. I got that tip from another reviewer years ago from this website and it has been foolproof for me ever since!

I made the pie using a frozen pie crust from Trader Joe's that I defrosted and put into a 9" pie pan (unbaked and chilled).  I followed the advice of others and warmed up the canned pumpkin, spices and salt.  Then I cooled the mixture in a bowl and added the cond milk and eggs.  It was quite yummy!  Make sure to serve it with some fresh real whipped cream!

Amazing! Iâve never made pumpkin pie before but this came out perfect! I heated up the pumpkin and spices, used a graham crust, and cooled in the oven like other reviews mentioned. Will definitely keep as my go to pumpkin pie recipe! But my crust did burn a little so next time I will put the crust in the fridge before filling and cover the edges before baking.

This is the easiest and most delicious pumpkin pie we've ever made! We use a graham cracker pie crust, however, and we've found that it goes really well with the pumpkin.

Better than Costco pumpkin pie! Although I attribute half of that to the crust you decide to make. This pie beat out a blind taste test against the popular Costco alternative.

Turned out perfectly.  I used freshly baked pumpkin and a homemade graham cracker crumb crust.  I did substitute/add 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice as suggested by other bakers.

This is a very simple and easy pie recipe. I made this, but I started with a fresh organic pie pumpkin. My son wanted pumpkin seeds to I reserved them for him, cut the pumpkin into large chunks, rubbed them with a bit of olive oil, salt , pepper, and roasted it in the oven. I had to wait until the next day to bake, because I didn't have condensed milk. (Generic version from Aldi worked just fine.) The next day I mashed the peeled chilled pumpkin chunks with the condensed milk, 2 eggs, nutmeg, and cinnamon. (I didn't have any ginger.) I used an immersion blender on the mix after mashing it together, poured the puree into a Gluten Free Graham Cracker Crust, and baked it according to instructions until a wooden skewer came out clean.
THIS IS THE BEST PUMPKIN PIE I HAVE EVER TASTED!!!

My mother in-law is the queen of pumpkin pie. 
My husband and I made this and now she is relying on us for family pumpkin pie making.  Sub organic ingredients sub 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice instead of individual spices.

This pumpkin pie is going into my favourites! I made this pie and another âcomplexâ pie, and this one was just fool proof, it turned out perfect! I love how this uses minimal ingredients, and still allows you to devour it fresh and warm. Iâll definitely be making this again, but I think Iâll use others suggestions of 2tsp pumpkin spice and 2tsp cinnamon for a bit spicer taste.

How can anyone like this is beyond me. I regret having tried this. The top layer crusted like it had a disease and it lacked any flavour. If you do not use their promoted condensed sweetened milk youâll end up with no sugar. Keep that in mind, most comparable recipes call for 3/4 cups of sugar. This one only relies on the sweet condensed milk...

This recipe was very good but it didn't quite taste right to me. It had less pumpkin spice taste and more of a creamy sweet taste. My husband said it just didn't quite taste like pumpkin pie should but it still disappeared quickly, my family thought it was very tasty. I didn't use canned pumpkin so the pumpkin itself might have made it sweeter.

OMG I don't even like pumpkin pie that much and this was the best I've ever tasted! I did make my own pumpkin puree from fresh pumpkin so I don't know if that's what made it better, but it was fabulous! Instead of the spices I used 2 tsp pumpkin spice and 1 heaping tsp cinnamon. I also used a Graham cracker crust. I followed step one then baked for 35 minutes at 350 and let it cool 5 minutes in the oven with the door open. I made this for my husband's Italian family who asked me to make "the American pumpkin dessert" and they all loved it! I will definitely make this again and always use fresh pumpkin (they don't sell  canned pumpkin here anyway). I made some fresh whipped cream to add a dollop to each slice

Followed the recipe and it came out perfectly. This is much better than using pre spiced pumpkin in a can. Husband was a huge fan. I will definitely make this again.

It was very tasty. It is your classic pumpkin pie, nothing more, and nothing less. If you don't have all of the spices, you can just use 2 teaspoons of pumpkin spice.

Tried this recipe after loosing my go to.  Never again!  Followed the directions and had to throw the entire thing out.  It cooked up just fine, but the taste was beyond bland.  No sweetness to it whatsoever.  I may as well have chopped up chunks of raw pumpkin and warmed it in a pie shell.  Disgusting!

This is a good, simple recipe. You may want to adjust the spices to your own personal taste, as the amounts called for are on the mild side.

Did you know that cans of Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk from Canada are smaller than those sold in the US? I didn't, until I was just about to mix up the ingredients and went to convert the can's millileters to the recipe's ounces, juuuust to be sure I had it right. The 300ml variant sold in Canada is about 10oz. I wasn't about to make the trek to the grocery store for 4oz of the white nectar, but at the same time, it was not a significant amount to omit. To make up for lost volume, I increased the amount of pumpkin by about .2 cups, added a couple tablespoons of white sugar as well as a generous splash of whole milk.
The baking process was straightforward but I left it in the oven nearly 10 minutes past the recommended baking time to achieve optimal jiggly-ness.
Having strayed from the recipe, I was worried about the end result. Those worries were unfounded and I got rave reviews for the pie. Some people said it was the best pumpkin pie they have ever tasted. 
So, why only four stars? Because the millileter volume of the condensed milk needs to be declared, and I think the "jiggle test" needs to be mentioned as a method of determining doneness. If I had taken it out when the knife came out clean, it would have been underdone in the centre.

This is the only pumpkin pie recipe I will use. Been over 10 years and its still the pie Im asked to bring to every event. TIP I add a bit more of the spices because we like to kick it up a notch...I tried all spice and pumpkin pie spices but we  still  like it better when we mix our own spices. #loveeaglebrand #eaglebrandfan

A tip to get the filling perfectly cooked (without cracks) is to cook the pie until it is about 85% done, then turn off the oven, and open the door a little to let it cool down while it finishes cooking. I did 15 mins at 425, 30 mins at 350, then turned off and cracked the door open. The pie filling was perfectly cooked and did NOT crack! Beautiful presentation. Pour into an un-cooked pie crust.

I discovered this recipe because I did not have evaporated milk on hand, so tried the condensed milk recipe.  Generally I am not a fan of anything made with condensed milk, but my husband (the pumpkin pie lover) and I both preferred this recipe to my old standby.  Because I had it available, I used fresh pumpkin and a bit more spices, which I do with all recipes, just because we like them.  Very easy to make and turned out beautifully.  I did bake for a little longer than recommended, about 55 minutes.

An excellent recipe- and truly, the condensed milk method is far superior to the evaporated milk and/or gelatin methods. The texture is much better and the recipe doesn't suffer from the addition of brown sugar. I make this with a gluten free shell. My boyfriend typically hates pumpkin pie. I have come to make this regularly with a half-jar of Nutella swirled in just after filling with the pumpkin mixture. A crumbled, spiced hazelnut topping makes this pumpkin pie go from kitsch to elegant with almost zero effort. I'll never make pumpkin pie without hazelnut again.

Instead of nutmeg & ginger, use 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice w/ 1 tsp of cinnamon. I also added 1 tsp vanilla. I used fresh pumpkin & homemade whipped cream. For the cream: Just 1 cup whipping cream, 1 tsp vanilla & 2 tbsp confectioners sugar, blended until stiff. At my altitude the pie only required 30mins at 350 degrees.

I tasted the pie filling before I put it in the oven, and it tasted very bitter.  Then I realized there wasn't sugar included in this recipe.  I added 1/2 cup of granulated sugar and it was delicious!  I am very happy that I tasted it first, though, or I would have been very disappointed in the final result.

Very good pumpkin pie recipe & easy to make. Used frozen pie crust (slightly thawed) & used a little extra cinnamon, nutmeg & ginger than called for. Whisk well for great results.

I was in a hurry, made a double batch, and  so followed the first recipe as listed.  Unfortunately, it was this one!  There was NO sugar listed!  Needless to say, we went without pumpkin pie on Christmas!!!   I will NOT be following this recipe - or this website - again.  Very unhappy!

I donât like the Libbyâs pie recipe, so I wanted to try something different. I followed the recipe exactly and man did the pie look amazing. Key word look...though this pie looks great, the lack of sugar in the recipe made it taste horrible. I think it might only have been horrible because I was taking a bite expecting sweet and delicious pumpkin pie. Be warned...add sugar if you want a sweet pumpkin pie.

It is simply the perfect pumpkin pie. I have been making it for years. This recipe is right from the Eagle Brand label. I sometimes add 1 tsp vanilla extract. This pie is requested at every holiday dinner. 
Cover the last 15 minutes with pie ring or aluminum foil just the edges and the pie crust will be perfect. Test with a knife about 1" from edge and if clean then the pie is done. Cool on rack for at least an hour before cutting. You will not have any leftovers!!

Great base recipe! I did not use Eagle Brand anything (lol) and it came out great. I followed another reviewer's tip and warmed up the pumpkin puree and spices over medium low heat. I added a tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tsp almond extract, and a tbsp of cornstarch to thicken it up a little. This gave it a really well-rounded pumpkin flavor than just spicy. I also blind baked my butter/shortening pie crust first. Then i covered the edges with foil during the final bake so it wouldn't burn. Seems like it also kept the edges of the pumpkin mix itself from overcooking as I got a nice even bake -- no sinking or bubbles. I baked at 325 degrees (low and slow for an even bake) for about an hour as well. Taking off the foil in the last 20-15 min. My pie did not crack during cooling.

I love this!! I've made it 5-6 times now everything exactly as stated except I use mini pastry cups (store bought). This recipe makes about 20 mini pies & they are always a hit!! About 20 mins in my fan assisted oven at 145c.

Like others I made some changes to the flavoring which included using pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, and adding molasses. I used a frozen pie crust and baked it ahead of time for just a few minutes. The pie set perfectly for me and had great flavor and texture. I served it with maple whipped cream.

Iâve followed the recipe and also traded the spices for 2tsp of pumpkin pie spice....my family of 4 eat the pie in one night. For the pumpkin pie spice I started with 1 tsp and added 1/2tsp til I got to 2tsp because I did not think it had enough flavor.

It was very good. I heated up the pumpkin and spices on the stove top first like another review had recommended, but to be honest I couldn't tell the difference between this and store bought. Maybe I just needed a better pie crust and a little more seasoning. Thank you

Just made it for Thanksgiving.  Instead of Sweetened condensed milk , I used coconut milk with honey simmered for 25 min.  No complaints , everyone loved it.

Not enough spice and it was a bit to dry. I followed the recipe exactly as written and did not make any modifications. Iâll be going back to my recipe that uses evaporated milk instead of condensed.

It was an excellent dessert after a wonderful Thanksgiving dinner! Everyone raved about the flavor, and I made it as is, with no changes. This one is a keeper.

This recipe is super good, I added everything the recipe called for, the only thing different is that I heated the pumpkin and spices in a saucepan on low and let it cool before adding the rest of the ingredients and pouring it into the crust (another review suggested this, itâs necessary!)

Giving it a 4 for a preliminary rating....I didnât have lemon zest or cardamom...and added a bit more spices than the recipe. Everything else I did follow...baking it today for our actual holiday gathering tomorrow - so Iâll update the review then :)

Update: no one really LOVED this pie recipe, and even after Iâd added extra cinnamon, and everything else for that matter it was extremely bland. I love pumpkin pie and this wasnât the best Iâve had...

This was amazing!! I made it for my family and they enjoyed it very much! Today was Thanksgiving, so I made it for them! Thanks so much! The only change was that I added sugar, because I like to see the reviews on others experiences. The only thing I didn't like was the crust. It was a little overburnt, but I think that was my fault. Catch ya later!

This is a great recipe. This was my first time making a pumpkin pie, and it turned out great. Only thing I did a little differently was added a 1/4 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice, and used a graham cracker crust instead of  a regular crust. Will definitely be making this again!

I would definitely recommend this recipe to someone else!  It was easy to make!  I did make a few changes.  I added 1/2 a cup of brown sugar and I also added 1/4 tsp of cloves to the recipe.  To make sure the crust did not get soggy I brushed the crust with egg whites before adding the filling.    For anyone who complained about the taste of the pumpkin pie not being sweet enough or not being able to taste the spices enough, the number one rule in baking or cooking is to make sure you taste your product before you bake it/cook it so you can fix it.  Just something to keep in mind.  Happy Baking!

Followed the advice and warmed pumpkin and spices in advance. After it cooled - prepared as normal. Make certain to get as much air out of the batter so that bubbles do not form. I doubled this recipe but forgot to get extra deep pie shells, so this actually made a third pie with graham cracker crust as that's what I had on hand. Will bring both to Thanksgiving tomorrow and see which one wins.

I have done this recipe straight from the can and heating up the pumpkin and spices first like another commenter suggested. I will never do it straight from the can again. Hearing the pumpkin and spices first makes a HUGE difference in taste. Itâs more than worth the little extra effort. This is also by far my fav pumpkin pie recipe.

My go to pumpkin pie recipe!  I use a frozen pie shell and pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices listed  in the recipe. Not sure about the bad reviews, I've always gotten compliments. The only recipe I've used for many years. I only use One Pie brand pumpkin and think that makes a difference in flavor.

My family loved it.  I actually saved our halloween pumpkin & cut it into chunks & froze it.  When ready to use, I steamed it in a covered pot until it was soft. I then pureed it and put in the fridge. The next day, I used all the ingredients as described along with our pureed halloween pumpkin.  Not only did it turn out great, the kids appreciated having the halloween pumpkin. :)

yummm! So good and really easy to make! It tasted like it was missing something, something small  - maybe I added too little salt or maybe I've been use to the store pies that I've actually been missing out on the real deal! Either way, this is a great recipe. Now I can say I've made a pie - everyone in the house loved it so its a winner!

I made a few adjustments to mine but it turned out great! My boyfriend was raving about it, added some happy birthday lettering because it's his favorite and I made it for his bday but this is a great recipe. I only added a scoop more of canned pumpkin and a dash of pumpkin pie seasoning, and and egg wash on the crust, so I don't think there would be a huge difference if you stick to the exact recipe but definitely recommend this recipe!

The reviewers who were missing the sugar probably used evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed milk. I needed more spice. First time around lacked enough spice using 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp cinnamon. Doubling it this time.

So I altered the ingredients kind of.. I just added some to the recipe. I used a gram cracker crust, and added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. It was a complete hit in our house! Definitely making this again.

Did the 2 tablespoons of pumpkin pie spice and 2 tablespoons cinnamon instead of all the singular ingredients, turned out AMAZING.

did have to cook it a little longer, but kept checking in 5 min increments. prob for about 55 mins total after dropping it to 350

Easy to follow and it turned out great. Next time I have to use less of the sweet condensed milk - it is too sweet for me this way!

DELICIOUS! I made this today and it was absolutely delicious!!! This will definitely be my go to recipe for Pumpkin Pie! I actually used purÃ©ed ginger and it added a nice hint.

This pumpkin pie recipes is the best I've ever made.  Use a fresh pumpkin instead of a can to make it even better (such an easy swap and SO worth it).  I will be making this multiple times this month for different events.   I consider myself a pumpkin expert and lover of all things pumpkin. Trust me.

I made this with real pie pumpkin puree. I used two cups of puree after I dried most of the water off using cheese cloth. I added 3 tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice after reading some of the reviews. I bought store bought pie shells and when they were thawing looked real gooey so I bakes them for about 5 min. and the bottom was flaky after the pie was cooked and not soggy like usual. I will be making this again.

I used the easy pie crust by BIBMOM which was a breeze. 

For the salt, I reduced to pinch, used coconut milk (30% less ) instead of condensed milk and use the flesh of half a small pumpkin ( microwaved for 25 min ). 

The first part of the baking, I tweaked the baking to 200C at 13 minutes and did the second part at 180C for 35 minutes. Hubby was like, WOW! can we have something like this tomorrow?

So yup, it was a success. Thank you!

My favotite pumpkin pie. I add about 1/8 to 1/4 tsp of ground cloves as well and freshly grated nutmeg. This always turns out well.

This was so good! I took it to my friend's place for Thanksgiving and her husband enjoyed it so much he said he wasn't going to share what was left with his kids and that I was welcome to bring it anytime I came to visit (or preferably, everytime!) - better than any pumpkin pie he'd ever had in a restaurant. So yeah, it was delicious.

Too sweet for my tastes, all I could taste was the sweetened condensed milk. I notice some reviewers said it wasn't sweet enough, I wonder if they used unsweetened condensed milk instead?

The five star reviews for this recipe are all from people who changed the spice mix. I made this filling as directed in the recipe and it was bland and did not even taste like pumpkin pie. I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and felt embarrassed after I tasted it that my guests had to eat it.

As a base recipe, itâs 4/5. Incredibly creamy and absolutely delicious. However, second time I baked it, I added vanilla extract and a pumpkin pie spice blend and some extra cloves & cinnamon, I also used a graham cracker crust because thatâs just what I prefer and it was 5/5! Absolutely delicious, cheap and easy. Iâm rating the recipe for the way it was written but just giving some small suggestions :)

This recipe is great! It turned out beautiful! I made a couple of changes like others have suggested. I used 2 tsp. of Pumpkin Pie Spice & 1 1/2 tsp. Cinnamon instead of the other spices. I also mixed the pumpkin with the spices and salt and warmed it on the stove before making the pie. The only other thing I did differently was that I brushed the pie crust with melted (real) butter before adding the filling to it. I've made this several times now and my husband and I absolutely love it!

Great flavor! The condensed milk makes it a five star,I made my own crust,my daughter told me to bake the crust a few minutes so it wouldn't be soggy ,I didn't do it then I was panicking thinking maybe I should have listed to her. The pie and crust came out great!

This recipe was great.

Followed the recipe step-by-step and got great results.

The pie comes out in an autumn orange color, and a graham pie crust works just fine.

You really can't go wrong with this recipe.

Wonderful pie! Couldn't be easier either! I didn't have ginger (wonder when I ran out?), so I added 1/2 t of pumpkin pie spice to get at least some ginger in it. Wasn't overspiced at all. Baking time is right on. Puffs a bit when baking and settles as it cools. Great recipe!

I made this as instructed with my own graham cracker n butter crust. My picky 5 year old son is begging for a third slice! I made it in a springform pan for appearance and was generous with the cinnamon.

Made this for my husband (who was a chef and a culinary graduate), and he absolutely loved it.  I did follow the recipe, and some of the tips.  I  cooked pumpkin, spices and salt on medium heat for a few minutes first, and also par baked the crust for 8 min. at 425 (put parchment and rice down to avoid puffing up) to ensure no soggy bottoms!  Once pumpkin was cooled off, added milk and eggs.  Then cooked at 425 for 15 min, then 350 for 37 min. and shut the oven off.  Took out an hour later.  Crust is perfect, no soggy bottom, and the pumpkin is also moose like in texture.  Husband has made thousands of pumpkin/squash pies, and he liked this the best!

What a disaster ! Grandma's pumpkin pie was the farthest thing from perfect; unless you like some sort of pleasant tasting slop in a pie shell. What a disappointment. This is not my first pie - I have made countless pies with great success. This one was an absolute disaster. Was grandma into the Brandy or liqueur when she formatted this recipe. I followed the recipe to perfection. I checked the pie in several locations before pulling it out of the oven (it looked fabulous). However, when it cooled off and we served it - it was a complete sloppy mess, like a mess of crud in a pie shell that came out of the bottom end of the garbage disposal. My god!!!! Grandma would have had to be almost through the bottle when she came up with this recipe. My guests must think I am some sort of loser of a baker. If I missed something - let me know. I followed the instructions well - the result was dreadful - a tasty sloppy mess from hell.

I'm an Aussie living in Canada, never eaten a pie with pumpkin in it in my life. Boyfriend says it's the best pumpkin pie he's ever eaten (and it's his favourite). Thank you!!

Nice and simple recipe. Loved that. I did make some key changes so that's why I couldn't give five stars. First off, my boyfriend got fresh pumpkin from the market. About a pound and a half. We boiled it out in the double boiler to soften and then we made a puree using the blender. I made the pie crust from scratch as well using this recipe http://addapinch.com/pie-crust-recipe/  and used Nestle Betty Sweetened Condensed Milk. The recipe was a good foundation though and for someone who doesn't like pumpkin, I really enjoyed how it turned out.

Just ok. The temperature was way too high in the beginning and burned my pastry crust. Saved it for the most part with aluminum foil, but ruined the display. The top cracked terribly. As far as flavour goes, it was very mild. I prefer a spicier pumpkin pie filling. Libby's is much better and I will stick with that one from now on. Thanks anyway.

Not impressed. The top of the pie had a thick layer   and the bottom of the crust was still raw. I would suggest baking pie crust before you put in filling.

Attention to those who are rating 1 star because there is no sugar. . I think maybe you're using condensed milk.  The recipe calls for SWEETENED condensed milk.  The sugar is in the milk.  If you get unsweetened condensed milk it's not going to taste delicious.

Been making this recipe for years now.  Very easy and very good!  Tip for those complaining top of pie burns, halfway through cooking I loosely place a sheet of tin foil over the top.  This helps prevent pie crust and top of pie from burning.

I made this with a Crisco Flaky Pie crust recipe...it is the best pumpkin I or my family has ever had. Absolutely delicious! I also followed the advice of others and used 1 1/2 tsp of McCormick Pumpkin Pie Spice. And I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract. This will be my go to for pumpkin pie!

It is in the oven so I can't rate it but I added sugar because pumpkin is bitter without a little. I looked recipe over 4 times. Need sugar.

I made this pie for thanksgiving this year and it was amazing. People who said they don't usually care for pumpkin pie thought it was delicious and asked me to make it for christmas  as well. I followed a couple suggestions from the comments. I blind baked the pie crust (that I made from scratch) at 350Âº F for 10-15 minutes, I used fresh pumpkin, and I also mixed the pumpkin, spices, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat then added the condensed milk and egg and let it cool. The pie turned out amazingly both in looks and taste.

This is simply the perfect edition pumpkin pie recipe in my opinion. This is what I expect pumpkin pie to taste like. Good spice, but not overdone.  Great texture. Gets better as it sits in the fridge. This one is so good I don't even add whipped cream on top, though others will still want to. My friends and family raved about this pie. It will be a staple for me every fall.

With the addition of 1/8 tsp of cloves, then it becomes the perfect pumpkin pie.

I have made this for years.  It is my family's favorite pumpkin pie.  The pumpkin is creamier than traditional recipes and it is so easy to make.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

Very good...not sure if there is much difference between this and the Libby's recipe.  Used 2tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp cinnamon.  Prebaked the crust for 8 minutes at 400 degrees without edges covered.  Added foil around edges for entire baking time.  Set timer for final 35 minutes and left pie alone to cool in oven afterwards with oven off for 5+ minutes.

Easy as pie! I followed the advice of other reviewers and heated the purÃ©e and spices and pre-baked the crust a bit before pouring the mixture in and baking it. Also I allowed the pie to cool in the oven to avoid splitting.

My pie was a hit! So much so that my dad asked me to make him another one just for him!

Oh, and a tip for those folks who said it wasn't sweet:  The recipe calls for sweetened condensed milk, not evaporated milk. There is a HUGE difference and believe me if you use sweetened condensed milk your pie will be plenty sweet enough.

I made this with a graham cracker crust (using cinnamon graham crackers) and added 1/4 tsp cloves. Two different people told me this was the best pumpkin pie they've ever had. I will definitely be making this again.

I received compliments on this pie.  I'm not a pumpkin pie fan,  so I'm always looking for good recipes.  This one is a keeper.  I used my own pumpkin that I boiled down from pie pumpkins.  Worked like a charm.

I made two pumpkin pies using this recipe for Thanksgiving and they came out so good!!!  I used Trader Joe's frozen pie crust which is a little difficult to use because it breaks apart but can be pressed back together...it's the best tasting pre-made pie dough I know of.  I also used 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice (I used Trader Joe's brand...not sure how it compares to other brands) in place of the ginger/cinnamon/nutmeg.

I felt that the spices were lacking a little flavor, so I threw in a pinch of pumpkin pie spice and it tasted right. My family said I'm now in charge of making the pie - so I guess they liked it!

I've made this 4 time now for Thanksgiving (twice in 2015 with Libby's canned pumpkin and 2016).  This year since I live in NZ and wasn't able to find canned pumpkin, I had to make my own purÃ©e.  I used a crown pumpkin, roasted in the oven with skin on. Once cooled, the skin peels right off! With the exception of the fresh pumpkin, I didn't change anything.  This will be my go to recipe for pumpkin pie.  The Kiwis love it too!

I backed off the nutmeg a bit and added ground cloves to get to the measurement, which was the right amount of spice.  Thanksgiving crowd loved it.

I followed the recipe exactly but opted to make the crust from scratch. This turned out perfectly, the flavor of the filling was subtle and classic and had the creamy consistency of egg custard. Would make this again.

This recipe is absolutely great. I did make one lil slight change. Instead of using all white sugar. I used half Brown sugar and half white granulated sugar.

I used half the can of sweetened condensed milk and replaced the liquid with buttermilk and it came out delicious!! I also didn't have nutmeg so substituted with allspice and added a dash of ground clove. If you prefer deserts that aren't overly sweet, I highly recommend the substitution. Enjoy!

This recipe is terrible; the author left off adding sugar and unfortunately i didn't realize it until after making them for Thanksgiving dinner!  The pie was inedible.

This was not as sweet as I am used to and I found the nutmeg overwhelming.  It wasn't bad, just didn't wow me and I'll go back to what I usually do.

The pie turned out fine, but what I can't get over is how hardly anyone's reviews mention the recipe not having sugar in it! No one in my family would eat this pie! My husband said it tasted like you needed to add some butter and salt rather than whipped cream to it.

Love this Pumpkin Pie. I live in Bangkok, Thailand so I always adjust the recipe to make it more affordable to make here. They have amazing pumpkin/squash.  I just steam it and use it, throwing in a bit more than it calls for. Also never have allspice but do without. And add freshly grated ginger as I love it, about a Tablespoon. So yummy!

This pie did nothing for me or my guests.  I used fresh pumpkin but this shouldn't have mattered.  This pie was not sweet but had a distinct saltiness.  After cooking preparing according to the recipe, the most sweetness I got was in the whipped cream I put on top.

This was perfect. I let it cool in the oven and there were no cracks.  Out of curiosity, I'm going to add 1/4 tsp of cloves next time.

Perfect! I did take the advice of other reviewers and mix all ingredients except the eggs in a sauce pan to simmer for a bit. My hubby says" way better than store bought! " it's a keeper. 

And below someone mentioned a "skin" on top of the pie. I can't help but wonder if the egg wasn't all the way incorporated into the pie. 

Thanks for this great and easy recipe!

I made the mistake of using the can of pumpkin sold in all the grocery stores at this time of year, which is 29oz. Yes, this is twice the amount of pumpkin to sweetened condensed milk. Why do they not sell a smaller amount of pumpkin in cans? Maybe so you can make two pies at the same time; maybe so I can mess up recipes like these. In any case, this means it will not be nearly as sweet. Fortunately I did double all the other spices. We'll see how it all turns out!! So I am not rating this recipe up or down since it is already a disaster. Regardless, Happy Thanksgiving all!

I normally make the Libby pumpkin pie every year and felt that it was lacking something. Not enough spice  maybe. But then while on my search to find a different pumpkin pie recipe, I found this one. So glad I did, because it's excellent! Has a great flavor, plenty of spice and all around surpasses the Libby recipe. I topped each slice with home made whipped cream sprinkled with pumpkin pie spice. Happy Thanksgiving!

I have made so many pumpkin pies and this is my favorite. My family loved it as well, and I have some very finicky palettes here . It's very basic but the texture and taste is delicious. I used a graham cracker crust. The only change I made, after reading several reviews on here, was to double the amount of all the spices which worked out great.

This is my go to recipe for pumpkin pie.   I always puree my own fresh pumpkin for this recipe.   I do add more spices than it calls for, but that's just me.   I have made these pumpkin pies for years, and I always get raved reviews.  You do not need to add sugar to this recipe, as one reviewer said.   If it needs more spices according to your taste, add it.   Who cooks or bakes anything without tasting it?  Always taste!

This was my first time making a pumpkin pie completely from scratch and I couldn't have done it with out all the tips from this recipe. I made the crust from the buttery flakey pie crust recipe on this site as well. I think the biggest help for this pie was using a water bath to avoid the pie cracking. I also put foil on the edges of the crust to keep them from over baking. I may take the foil off sooner to get the crust a little more golden brown next time, but other than that the pie was perfect!

I love this pumpkin pie! I also substituted the ginger and nutmeg for 2 teaspoons of McCormick Pumpkin Pie Spice and added a 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract just to make it my own. This is definitely a family favorite and will be for may years!

I have been making this pie for years with the following changes:  Use 2 teaspoons of Vietnamese Cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of ground ginger plus 1 tablespoon of grated fresh ginger and 1/4 teaspoon of hot chili powder, 1 extra egg yolk.....everyone raves that it is the best pumpkin pie they have ever had....

Was not impressed!  I had high hopes for this recipe since it uses my favorite ingredient; sweetened condensed milk.  I made a few modest changes - added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice,  2 tbsp of maple syrup, an extra yolk, salt, and vanilla.  I also heated the spices and puree in a pan before baking - the resulting pumpkin filling turned out bland with a gelatin-like consistency.    I am very disappointed and will not make this again.

I made this pie last year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. It was such a hit with the whole family. And of course I got asked to make it again this year. And I didn't change a thing, it came out perfect! This will continue to be my "go to" pumpkin pie recipe.

I made this pie this afternoon. The directions were easy to follow.
I liked the structure of the filling, it was really soft.
However, I did not like the taste. The pie was way too sweet in my opinion.
(But that may be because I have never tasted pumpkin pie before)

Absolutely amazing. I've had lots of pumpkin pie in my life, and this one stands in the top 5 for homemade. I used the tip someone posted about warming up the puree, spices and salt, letting it cool and then adding and condensed milk and eggs. This pie was beautiful next to some vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream!!!!

I have been using this recipe for a few years and it is fantastic. I am constantly asked to bring it to family gatherings, and there is never any left. I heat up the pumpkin and spices in a pot until the spices are fragrant and let it cool before mixing in the condensed milk and eggs.

This is my go-to for the holidays. I discovered this recipe five years ago and this is the only pumpkin pie recipe I use since. Everyone loves it, I have to make two just for the people in my house. I do add extra spices.

So easy. I made it in my blender. Instead of all the spices, I just added two scant teaspoons  Trader Joe's Pumpkin Pie Spice. Excellent flavor. Also,  to prevent burning edges of the crust, I use a silicone crust cover.

Such an easy recipe!! I made my crust from scratch, but it would be fab with any crust! I followed the suggestion of others and used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp of cinnamon instead of adding all of the other spices. In addition, I mixed the canned pumpkin and spices on the stovetop on low heat, then let that cool and added the eggs and condensed milk. Fun tip that momma taught me: when adding liquid to a mixture (like this one, or pudding, or jello) always add it in a little at a time. That way it all mixes well! I also sprinkled a little pumpkin pie spice on top! Topped it all off with homemade whipped cream. SO yummy, quick, and easy. :)

I made this with freshly made pumpkin puree and 1.5 tsp pumpkin spice that included clover. I think it needed more pumpkin (I used 350 grams). Overall, it was a success and I loved it.

So I did this using real pumpkin instead of the can, I wanted to use up some of the left over guts from carving our pumpkins. It turned out good! I'm not even a pumpkin pie person and I liked it. I did add one extra egg because the real pumpkin is looser than the can stuff. It was a fun experience!  Never done that before. Thanks for the great base recipe!

this recipe is one of the best I've used. Instead of using canned pumpkin I used fresh. If you decide to go this route, steam the pumpkin for 25 minutes +/-. This really makes the pie much better.

This is a super simple recipe that I have made a few times. This time however I added a touch of molasses and bourbon.  Plus I added a bit more seasoning to my taste. Everyone loved it!!

This turned out very well, with a few alternations (as per the suggestions of others). I heated the canned pumpkin with the salt and spices beforehand and let it cool prior to adding the egg and condensed milk. I also doubled the ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg, as well as added 1/2 tsp of ground cloves. Poured the whole mixture into a pre-prepared graham cracker crust and baked until it set (with the knife coming out clean). It took much longer than the recommended time, and when it was nearly set, I turned off the heat and let it cool inside the oven (to prevent cracking). Topped with light cool whip and caramel drizzle... Everyone loved it!

what's not to love. 
I used 2 cups of fresh pumpkin puree; blind baked the crust so it wouldn't soggy and pumpkin pie spice as a short cut for the spices.
we ended up with enough for 2 pies. one we added a crumble on top, yum yum.

Could be excellent with the right changes.  As it stands it is rather bland and you should add sugar and clove to the recipe.  If you want to go the extra mile and skip excess sugar try substituting a real sugar baby pumpkin (the actual kind meant to cook not the Halloween decoration type there really is a difference) cut in half, remove seeds ONLY, not pulp, coat shell with canola or vegetable  oil, and bake for approximately 45 minutes or until pulp is tender.  This will be sweet and fresh naturally, no canned pumpkin needed, continue with the regular recipe from there but try clove with the other spices.  Yummmm, turned out perfect, no "sharpie skin, no bland taste just moist sweet and delicious.

Amazing, I used my great-grandma's homemade pie crust recipe with this and it was perfect! Also, a tip to home bakers, using real pumpkin that does not come from a can makes it taste a million times better. :) Also, adding some cloves gives it a little bit more of the traditional taste of pumpkin pie. My family always has me make the pies for our big family holidays.

I have made this pumpkin pie recipe for the past few thanksgiving dinners and it's always a hit with most asking for the recipe.  I can never seem to find a 14oz can of the Condensed Milk, only the 10oz can.  I just use the 10oz and add extra pumpkin Puree to make up for the 4oz shortage.  I actually think it's perfect this way... not to Sweet  (which I prefer) with excellent pumpkin flavour and a hint of spices.  I will not be looking for another pumpkin pie recipe... this is definitely 'the one'.  Enjoy!!

Worked out really well for me!  I did not change anything, only added walnut toping the last 30 min I baked it.  The kids loved it, we won't buy pumpkin pie from the grocery store anymore. :-)

It was terrible...the filling is bland due to the eagle brand condensed milk.  Traditional pumpkin pie is made with evaporated milk. Loom for traditional recipes.

This recipe is a winner. For sure there are ups and downs, but overall a great recipe for the autumn season. When pulling the pie out of the oven, a skin formed on the top, which is a hassle to deal with. The flavour itself is delicious, and makes up for the skin. Nonetheless, a great  recipe and will definitely make again.

I made this using fresh pumpkin and a tsp of fresh ginger. The batter was a bit bland so I added a bit more salt and about 1/4 tsp of ground cloves. I also used a homemade pie crust (BUTTER, never shortening!). The results were PERFECT and easy pumpkin pie. I imagine if it were made following the exact recipe, it would taste like a store bought pie. Which is good... unless you're used to homemade.

Perfect. Made with real pumpkin. Easy enough for kids to make. Made this a second time with caramel flavoured condensed milk (which I accidently bought). Turned out great. an excellent mistake.

I made this with just a few changes and it was pretty good.  I added some brown sugar and sugar, not a lot, but some...and I also made a homemade pie crust.  I've had better pumpkin pies, but it was still pretty good.

I used fresh pumpkin. I baked one medium sized pumpkin (about basketball size) 2 hours at 375. Scooped it out and drained. I weighed out the amount in the recipe, but the batter was too runny. I added 1/4 cup all purpose flour to thicken. The stringiness looked unappetizing  (my first pumpkin pie so I didn't know if that was supposed to be that way). I blended it up in a ninja for a consistent look. 

Perfect temperature recommendations. I didn't get a thick layer like one reviewer had. Moisture and texture was light and perfect. One person who ate it thought there was too much salt. I disagree, but whipped cream is the great pie equilizer. I used Pilsbury ready made crust. It was yummy!

This is definitely my favorite recipe for pumpkin pie.. I also made the Libby's recipe but I prefer this one more. It spicy and sweet.. I didnt follow the recipe and listen to all other reviewers with 2tsp of pumpkin spice and 2tsp of cinnamon. TASTED REALLY GOOOD! My tip are: use eggs white to brush the crust instead of foil bc the crust sticks to the foil and hard to remove. breaks up the whole crust! egg whites makes it perfect golden and shiny. Another tip is use like 75-80% of the condense milk bc its really sweet! can hurt your throat but other than that perfect..

I changed the directions a bit to bring out the flavors alittle more before baking...

1.	Whisk canned pumpkin, spices and salt in a medium bowl until smooth.
2.	Heat in a saucepan using a low heat.  Let mixture cool
3.	In a separate bowl, beat eggs and sweetened condensed milk to together
4.	After mixture has cooled, mix the pumpkin, egg and condensed milk mixture together (insuring to smooth-out the lumps) then pour mixture into pie crust

This was so easy and delicious! For those who said the pie wasn't sweet at all, I wonder if they used evaporated milk instead of condensed?

I made this recipe because of one of the reviews. It was the review suggesting us to, âin a medium pan over low heat, heat up the canned pumpkin puree, spices, and salt. Heating the pumpkin puree up takes out the "canned" taste of the pumpkin and melds the spices together nicely. Then, pour the mixture out into another bowl, and let it cool a bit before adding the condensed milk and eggsâ. And it turned out great and this was my first attempt at pumpkin pie. Of course I went on-line to find a great pumpkin pie recipe and I ended up, as I often do, at AllRecipes.com.  
Thank you and Good luck allâ¦

I do not like this recipe. Although it uses sweetened condensed milk, it was not sweet enough. It needed sugar. It needed sugar so badly. Im sorry but I hated it.

This was my first attempt at a pumpkin pie. It was great! Here In Canada condensed milk is sold in a 300ml can.. Which is just shy of 14 ounces. So I added in a splash of whipping cream to make up for the moisture. Also added in about 1 tablespoon of vanilla. I took the advice of others by heating up the Pumpkin and spices first. My can of Pumpkin was larger.. So I used almost 2 cups of puree. Used the butter Flaky pie crust recipe from this site.

This pie recipe is easy and results are great every time. I butcher our jack-o-lanterns every year, steam the pumpkin in chunks, let it cool, hand squeeze out the excess liquids, and package in 2 cup amounts for freezing. One of these two cup packages of frozen pumpkin work perfectly for this recipe. I thaw it well and blend in the Vitamix with the other ingredients before pouring it into the crust and baking. Apart from using my own pumpkin from scratch, I follow this recipe exactly and it works out well every time.

This was my first time making a pumpkin pie, I was nervous because I was bringing it to Thanksgiving dinner! It looked great and had a nice texture... But everyone  who had a slice had to load up on the whipped cream: it wasn't sweet enough.

I have been making this pumpkin pie for years.  I found the recipe on the Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk website and it is the only pumpkin pie that sets up and is easy to slice as well as amazing to eat.  The only difference I see on the recipe listed here, is it calls for canned pumpkin.  My recipe calls for canned pumpkin pie filling.  Either way, if you LOVE pumpkin pie, you have to make this one!

Absolutely delicious! I randomly made this pie and it turned out amazing. Every bite was mouth-watering and as I write this, I'm wanting MORE. Luckily for me, with this recipe I surprisingly had enough batter to make TWO pies!! The only changes that I made to this recipe was: (1) heating up the canned pumpkin pie and mixed in the spices/salt in a skillet over a medium heat. (2) chill the pumpkin mixture in the refrigerator until slightly firm. (3) pre-heat the pie crust for three minutes (4) pour mixture into pie crust. I will most definitely be making this recipe again!!!!!

I followed this recipe precisely with one exception to the McCormick Spice ingredient. I couldn't find it at Koger so I just purchased the cheap off brand of pumpkin spice and it worked out wonderfully. I have never maid pumpkin pie before but it was so delicious! My whole family enjoyed as well.

Came out great - used 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice because I was lazy. Used Crisco pie crust which I did not pre-cook at all and it came out amazing - no crust savers, no pie birds, nothing special other than a glass pie pan which makes a world of difference.

For a light, melt-in-your-mouth heavenly tasting filling-- Follow this  EASY SIMPLE WAY to make your pie extra light and silky smooth, almost like a chiffon style.
     Separate the eggs, adding the yolks to the pumpkin mixture as directed (make sure it's cooled if you heated it).  In a separate bowl, whip the egg whites until have nice firm peaks and just before you're ready to pour your pie into the crusts, GENTLY FOLD the whipped egg whites into the pumpkin mix, incorporating them completely. Then pour mixture into your waiting pie crusts. 
    Since this method makes a taller pie, you might want to use a deep dish pie tin if you have one (I use a 9 in deep dish).  The finished pie is light, airy, silky smooth and just melts in your mouth. I get more compliments when done this way vs the usual way. Try it next time-- you won't regret it!!

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and followed the instructions and tips from other reviewers as far as spices goes. My husband said it tasted good but like it could have been cooked a little longer. I am going to try again.

My bf and I made this pie yesterday, and followed recipe exactly as written. We let it cool for about two hours, then tried a slice. It was wet and grainy, and flavorless. We were surprised because of all the positive reviews. Today, he decided to try another small slice to figure out what went wrong, and to our delight, it was AMAZING! We now know we sliced it too soon, and from now on will make it a day ahead of when we need it. It was so delicious, perfect consistency and the flavor was right on! Truly a Perfect Pumpkin Pie! PS-If you are searching for a simple pie crust, try the Land O Lakes Butter Pie Crust recipe. So easy and goes great with this pie.

Super easy, quick and yummy! I used 2 tsp McCormick pumpkin pie spice plus an extra tsp of Cinnamon. Also used a ready made graham cracker crust that I put in the freezer for a couple of hours. It was indeed PERFECT!

This pie set up PERFECTLY when allowed to cool.  I have never had a pie look so perfectly after it was cut.  It was DELISH as well.  Perfect amount of spice and sweet and SUPER EASY (my 6 year old mostly made it with minimal supervision from me!)! I wanted to make sure I saved it to my recipes for Christmas.

I just made this for Thanksgiving, and everybody said it was amazing! Per another review, I heated the pumpkin and spices up in a saucepan pan on low for a few minutes while stirring continuously. I also used a gram cracker crust in place of the standard pie crust; the upgrade was appreciated :-). I will keep this one in my recipe box!

Too sweet for me! I made 2 pies at one time and tasted the mix after only adding only 1 can of sweetened milk. It was perfect for us. If you don't like your dessert overly sweet, consider substituting half of the sweetened milk for evaporated milk. You can always add a bit more sweetener, having more control over it.

Second time making it. 1.5 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp allspice, 1/2 tsp cloves, and 1 tsp vanilla. Using a graham cracker crust. We'll see how it turns out.

Right now they look perfect! I made three batches of this and had enough from each batch to make a 4th pie! I'll leave my remark on the taste tomorrow. I kept the recipe the same however I added a teaspoon on pumpkin pie spice to it too.

WONDERFUL!  First time I've made a pumpkin pie.  I added the caramel condensed milk in place of the regular condensed milk.  I took advice and heated the filling, as well as prebaking my pie crust.  I will definitely make this again.

Took a reviewers suggestion and pre cooked the pumpkin and spices. Let that cool and then added the egg /condensed milk. Used my own crust recipe which I pre-baked for 10 min and BAM... Awesomeness! Thanks for this recipe.

I made this into 6 mini pies using  fresh home made pie dough. I also utilized the tip of heating the pumpkin with the spices and they turned out perfect. Freeze the mini pies crusts first then do 10 minutes at 425 and drop oven to 325 for an additional 20 minutes. The crust was crisp and flaky and the pie filling was smooth and 
silky! I used a fluted tart pan with a removable bottom, it helps if you have problems with the bottom of the crust not getting fully cooked.

I dont like a strong ginger taste so I reduced the ginger by 1/4 tsp. To add a bit more flavor I added a small sprinkle of ground cloves. I will definitely make it again.

I used real pumpkin (roasted in a covered casserole dish, a little water, 1 hour @ 350) and followed instructions to the letter. The taste was sheer perfection. The only concern I had, as previously mentioned, was the skin which bubbled throughout the cook and left a wrinkled, tougher exterior. Any tips on eliminating this?

Perfection! This is the easiest and tastiest  pumpkin pie I've ever made. The texture was great!  I especially love that there isn't extra sugars added other than the sweetened condensed milk.

I use a graham cracker crust, crisp it in the oven for 5-7 minutes before you add the filling to make a crispy, crumbly crust! Super easy and quick to make.

I used all organic ingredients and left out the ginger(only because I didn't have any) and the pie turned out to be the best pumpkin pie I've ever had. It was so easy I'm making a second one...the first is already almost all gone!

wonderful!  delicious!
I made 2 pies, so doubled the recipe.  2 cans of evaporated milk was way too much, so I used 1 and 1/2.  Also used home- cooked pumpkin, a T of molasses,  and not quite so much sugar :-)
Everybody LOVED it!

With pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon. Loved it. Leave in oven for15 min after oven I'd turned off. Does wonders for the crust too.

OK but only used because I ran out of brown sugar.  Really too sweet for my taste, but great alternative for those in a hurry!  Remember SWEETENED condensed milk not plain condensed milk.

Very good! I made the mistake of noting the reviews that said it tasted like medicine and that it had no sugar . . . I added a 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it was WAY too sweet. I think they used evaporated milk rather than a can of  SWEETENED CONDENSED milk. I DID double the spices and it that was a good plan!

This is a classic that works like a charm! The only modification I made to this one was swapping out the actual pie crust for a pre-made graham cracker crust (since I wanted an easy clean up). I had no issues whatsoever and this pie was an absolute hit at our family gatherings last year! I plan to make this several times as the holidays approach.

This is a great recipe, I added a bit more cinnamon and some brown and white sugar for my sweet tooth, but overall a really great recipe. (The only reason I did it was because I was out of sweetened condensed milk) Anyway, five stars, loved it.

Followed the recipe exactly. Seemed dry and not a lot of flavor. Lacked that creamy custard consistency I really prefer. I'm going back to my recipe with evaporated milk.

So I'm eating this pie right now and I must say....wow!! I followed the instructions, but like many of the others, I tweaked it a bit. I added a 1/2 cup of light brown sugar, a tablespoon of vanilla, a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice, and all of the originally listed ingredients above. 

I then poured the batter into a ready-made graham cracker crust and followed the instructions, baking it at 425 degrees for 15 minutes and then lowering it to 350, but instead of baking it for only 40 minutes, it took an hour for my pie to get done. Once I saw that it was done, I turned the oven off and let it sit in the oven for an hour so it could cool properly. 

But MAN this pie is amazing! You've got to go with graham cracker crust, too...it accents the pumpkin pie's flavor so well!!

I loooove this recipe. Last Thanksgiving I made one pie with this recipe and another with the recipe that comes on the back of the Libby's can. I don't know why but this recipe is 10 times better, my whole family agrees. I do heat the pumpkin puree first with all of the spices (I just use Pumpkin Pie Spice) and add a little extra cinnamon as other reviews suggested. Tasty pie and wayyyy better in a gingerbread crust than a traditional pie crust.

I made this last thanksgiving. I usually dislike pumpkin pie but this  version was very creamy and elegant and very lovely.  i am lucky I got any at all because everyone loved it esp the little kids. I baked my crust just a little before filling.you could put foil around the edges if your worried about it getting too brown. And I warmed the pumpkin up and let it cool to get rid of that tinny taste.

Easy!  Wow!  Very tasty and got great family reviews.  Used the tip of heating up the pumpkin and spices a bit before baking, which seemed to work out well, and used a graham cracker crust for the first time with a pumpkin pie.  I made this for my Dad's 75th birthday as it is his favourite, and it was a hit!

Amazing recipe and so easy to make! It will be great if it is less sweet, wonder if I can do that by put only 3/4 of condense milk! Will it alter the texture?! I used freshly steamed and mashed pumpkin instead of canned. Definitely a keeper, will do it again and again! By the way, I used 'Easy pie crust' recipe from allrecipes (doubled the sugar and halved the salt), baked for 10 minutes before adding pumpkin filling and baked as mentioned in this recipe, works great!

I made this for my husband since he loves pumpkin pie.  He really liked it so I made it again for a potluck at work and got rave reviews!  I have made it as written and with coconut milk, both ways were great and no one could tell.  This is a keeper!

I think the people who are giving this recipe 1 star must not be using SWEETENED condensed milk, because my pie came out very sweet.  I don't like nutmeg, so I omitted that.  I also used fresh pumpkin puree from a Halloween pumpkin, and I added about a tablespoon of blackstrap molasses to darken the color and add the flavor that I loved of my grandma's pumpkin pie which was sweetened with table molasses (her recipe used evaporated milk, but I didn't have any on hand, which is why I chose this recipe instead).  It was easy came out well!  I do recommend adding the blackstrap molasses!

This was my first time making pumpkin pie and it turned out great. I took one of the reviewers suggestion and used 2 tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of the nutmeg/ginger and just doubled the cinnamon. It turned out great and everyone loved it.

My husband & children liked the pie;  I personally didn't care for it.  The texture was not appealing to me, it felt "rubbery".  I'm going to look for a different recipe next time.

EXCELLENT!  I substituted pumpkin spice for the ginger and nutmeg.  I also added about two tablespoons of brown sugar.  The pie was SO delicious!  The recipe was easy and I'll definitely make it again!

I tried this recipe and was really excited since this was my first pumpkin pie. I followed the recipe exactly. I glad it was a test pie because it was horrible. All that I tasted was unsweetened pumpkin.  I thought I overlooked sugar but after reviewing, this recipe didn't call for any!!!! The sugar was left out of the ingredients needed and after checking out other recipes, I knew I had obviously goofed. I was just surprised that others hadn't commented over the oversight. I made another with sugar, eggs, and pumpkin pie spice added instead and my husband loved it!!!!

I added 1/2 tsp cloves and used fresh pumpkin.  I also baked just the filling with no crust.  I made some crepes and spread a scoop of the baked filling onto the crepe, folded and cut into slices and topped with whipped cream.  Delicious!

I had to add extra sugar (1/4 cup of brown sugar). I also replaced the spices with 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice - .  Definitely put foil over the crust, and I wouldn't put it as high as 425 - I think that's why people are getting the rubbery skin on top.

I loved this pie! So did my granddaughter, who ate almost half the pie, and she's just six!! I used 2 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice to spice it up a little more for my daughter-in-law. It was so good, I will make it again for Christmas.

Five stars!  This was delicious and so easy to make!  The texture is nice and the flavor is just right.  I only added one additional spice (pumpkin pie spice), otherwise it needed no tweaking.

Holy cow, this recipe was phenomenal! 
Perfect blend of spices and sweetness! 
We made it for Thanksgiving - my boyfriend made it by following the recipe. It was so easy, he proposed to me afterwards. :)
Great recipe, very easy, and we will make it again. !

Tried this recipe for a few years in a row and it is very easy to make. Not to mention, a complete crowd pleaser! 
I will be trying out the heating the canned pumpkin with the spices and letting it cool prior to proceeding part to see if it makes a big difference. Love that tip!

This  is a very great pumpkin pie and has been my go-to at holidays for several years now.   There are no changes needed.  Update mostly for my own notes:   For baking in the Panasonic CIO oven, reduce heat to 325 and set timer for 30 minutes.   Perfect every time.

This is a great recipe. I read the majority of the reviews and decided to follow the recipe as is. I did add 1/2 tsp ground cloves. I used a field pumpkin,(got it from the store for Halloween but never carved it.) Using fresh pumpkin, in my opinion, makes for a fluffier and lighter pie. I also made it in a graham cracker crust. The finished product was a light, fluffy, well balanced tasting pie. Other reviewers added sugar, I don't think it needed the added sugar. The sweetened condensed milk has sugar in it and if you make it with a graham cracker crust, that also has sugar in it too. I will use THIS recipe only. It's very easy to put together. This is a very good recipe.

Made this recently with some changes. I used graham and a shortbread pie crust. I also used 2tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1tsp of cinnamon instead of the spices listed (except for the salt). First pie was just the pie in the graham cracker crust. As other reviewers mentioned it did have this weird film on the top but it didn't detract from the flavor.
2nd pie, I used the shortbread crust (which I prefered), and I also added a pecan praline top to it that consisted of chopped pecans, dark corn syrup, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla extract.
Extremely delicious!! I think by itself, the pie is just fine, but with the added sweetness of the praline top and the shortbread crust, it made this over the top yummy!

I used fresh pumpkin rather than canned.  It was an excellent pie without being overly sweet.

I read the bad reviews first because that makes total sense. I was afraid it would be bland or WAY too sweet. It was neither! One of the BEST recipes I have ever made. I made my own crust and used homemade pumpkin puree. It was amazing and well encouraged!

The first time I made this pie, I used the Graham cracker crust.  It burned on me.  But when I used the regular frozen crust, it turned out great.  I used 2tsp of pumpkin spice and cinnamon.  Thank you for taking the time to post this recipe.

Fantastic. Made as written except I used a graham cracker crust. Will make for Thanksgiving.  My bake time was 10 minutes shorter than called for.

I've never made a pumpkin pie before, but I've eaten my fair share, so I know this recipe is fantastic! Just had it for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was perfect. I did double the cinnamon though, as I LOVE cinnamon. So I figured I'd take a chance. Glad I did. I will definitely make this again!!

This pie recipe disappointed completely. It lacks all sweetness, in part due to the lack of sugar, and was a unpalatable.

very good recipe, however I had some issues with it. First, I cant get a 15oz can of pumpkin in my grocery store, so I had to get a big can and measure. Second, I cant get a 14oz can of eaglebrand either so I had to use the size I could get which was a bit less. Other than that the pie turned out perfect.

Sometimes a mistake works out...

Easy recipe so I love it.  However, when I picked up the milk I apparently wasn't paying attention and bought the dulce de leche instead, and didn't notice until I poured the whole can in. LUCKY ME! It's sooo delicious!

I used half the ginger... But the rest stayed the same.

I really enjoyed making this pie, and it was so very easy to make. I loved the smell it gave inside the house, the smell reminded me of all the holidays past with loved ones. You should try this one.

One thing fun to do to taste the end result for impatient people like me is use a tablespoon of the pie filling and roll out the pie crust scraps.  Put in a bowl in the microwave for approx. 1 minute.  Yes it's not fine dining, but it gives me a taste of how awesome it's going to be, especially as I can never try it until the actual big dinner!  Fun for kids too.  Put it in the microwave for 45 seconds and keep doing in intervals of 10 seconds until filling doesn't stick to fork when poked in.
And yes this pie is amazing, I am so glad I found it!  I made two pies from this recipe by doubling it but only had one can of evaporated milk.  Just added a bit of extra sugar and it still turned out fantastic!

I have never made pumpkin pie before and this was a delicious and simple recipe to start with. The only problem I had, and this may be because I have an older oven, but my crust was done within 20mins and started to burn. I had to cover the edges with foil before I continued cooked. Next time I will probably just cook the crust before hand.

Delicious! This was the first tine I've made pumpkin pie and it turned out great. I didn't have ground ginger, so I used 2 teaspoons of 'pumpkin spice' and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon instead. When the pie was baking, I thought there might be too much filling for the pie shell but once it cooled it was perfect.
I am new to baking pies but this turned out great. Thank you!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great! I will definitely make this pie again and the only thing I would change is lowering the temp a little for first 15 mins. My crust turned out slighty darker than I'd prefer, but my oven seems to run hot.

Love this recipe, I make it every year now. It has just the right balance of spices and tastes the most like my grandmothers of any pumpkin pie I've had in years. My family are always asking me to make it and it really is easy.

I made this last Thanksgiving and the whole pie was gone by the next day (it was only me and my boyfriend). I didn't use separate spices though, as I had already mixed up own pumpkin pie spice a week before I used that so I don't know exactly how much of each went in. I also used a but more spice then called for because I LOVE pumpkin pie spice and wanted it to be stronger.

I used this pie for a recipe for a food modification class. I used puree'd beans in place of half the pumpkin. It didn't come out the same but close. This is a good recipe on its own, just remember to keep your pie in the middle of the oven to avoid over-browning.

Just made this pie tonight. Loved it! I wanted to make something quick and easy for dessert and happened to have E.D.Smith Pumpkin pie filling on hand so used that. I did not alter the recipe except to add more spices - The pie filling is spiced and very sweet (definitely taste the batter before you put the eggs in) I love ginger though, so I grated a a good big tsp in there. I added more cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves and all spice. 

I gave it 4 stars because it is really simple and tasty. I made a bunch of tarts too!

I have been making pumpin pie for YEARS and I decided to try a twist so I tried this recipe and took it to a dinne party.  Well everyone thought I had purchased it from a bakery.  Absolutly the best tasting pumpkin pie.  It is now after 35 years of pumpin pie making my new recipe. Can not wait to make it again

Today was my first attempt at baking a pie so I decided on giving pumpkin pie a go! Am so pleased I got this recipe. The pie was just so delicious! 

I used freshly pureed pumpkin and not the canned ones and I added 2 tablespoons of sugar but next time I'll just leave out the sugar. I also used freshly grated ginger instead of ground. 

Thanks so much for sharing. Am currently having a slice with a cup of tea. So yum!

Hubby was begging for pumpkin pie, he was satisfied but I was not, it developed a thick skin on the top while baking which was very unattractive. I was able to pull that off and the pie underneath looked right. The pie itself was on the bland side for me. Not likely to remake this one.

This worked very well. Like others, I used a prepared graham cracker crust, and I doubled the amount of cinnamon. I even used light condensed milk because my grocery store was sold out of the regular.

HALF a teaspoon on nutmeg?! Holy cannoli!  If you have too much ginger in a cookie/pie, it can have a soapy taste.  This also rings true for nutmeg. This recipe has way too much of BOTH.

This was okay. I messed it up though and didn't realize until later that I had used nonsweeted milk. Had to add sugar and it still wasn't sweet enough. Came out of the oven with lots of cracks. Very disappointed. Far from the perfect pumpkin pie I anticipated.

Super easy to make!  I used pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.  Turned out great!  I also covered the crust with aluminum foil after the first 15 minutes of baking, to make sure it didn't burn.

I live in Brasil, so had to puree my own pumpkin to make this.  But I did a bunch and froze it in 2 cup measurements, so that'll make it easy for future pies. :) But the recipe is perfect as is, didn't change a thing! Thank you for posting!

I've never made a pumpkin pie before, and this looked fairly simple. I didn't want to buy all the different spices, so I just used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and a little cinnamon. It turned out absolutely beautiful! I will definitely be making this one again next year.

Loved this recipe! I did add a bit more cinnamon and I used the tip about heating the pumpkin and spices prior to filling the pie shell. It really seemed to make for a smoother, richer taste in the finished pie. For years I used a recipe almost exactly like this, but it called for sugar and evaporated milk - I like this much, much better with the condensed milk and eliminating the sugar. Thanks for a super easy, super delicious pumpkin pie recipe!

Following the recipe to the letter yielded a rather bland pie in my opinion.  It needed a little more sweet and spice.

Delicious!   Followed the recipe but following other people's comments increased the ginger and cinammon to 1 tsp.  Just sweet enough and great consistency.   Will make again.

My first time ever making a pumpkin pie & it turned out perfect!  I did make a few changes.  I added 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar & used 2 tsp Cinnamon, 1 tsp Nutmeg, 1/2 tsp Ginger & 1/2 tsp Salt. (more than recipe called for).  Pre-baked the store bought crust (edges covered) for 5 minutes & then poured in filling & baked (with edges still covered) for 40 minutes until knife came out clean.  Set on counter to cool/set for 2 hours & then refrigerated.  Took out of fridge the next day (since I made this a day ahead) 1.5 - 2 hours before serving so it wasn't so cold.  Served with fresh made whipped cream!

Very easy and very good.  I used a whole baked kabocha (Japanese pumpkin) instead of can pumpkin.  I also reduced the sweet condensed milk to half and it was still very sweet.  I actually used whip cream instead of condensed milk on the last pie and that was even better, I need to experiment more.  It is so important to use fresh ground ginger.

I made this for Thanksgiving.  My family LOVED it.  It was a huge hit.  I followed the recommendations of several others of warming the canned pumpkin with the spices before filling the crust.  It worked out great.  Our neighbor's daughter who is super picky about pumpkin pie ate two pieces.  Several compliments from the guests as well.  Don't hesitate to try this!

I had really good results with this recipe and loved how simple it was. I didn't understand some reviewers feeling the need to add more sugar as I found the sweetened condensed milk was comepletely adequate. I also wouldn't add to the spices unless you really like a a spicy pie. It's a great recipe as is.

Good Recipe! Warmed up mixture (tip) and used the Pumpkin pie spice plus the cinnamon called for (tip).  Delish.

Not yet tried but sounds good. I might add allspice to it thus making it a little less sweet.

I always go overboard when it comes to reading the reviews and then I become stuck! I was afraid of messing the pie up because I was using a fresh pie pumpkin instead of the canned stuff and I wanted it to be sweet enough. I used all of the pumpkin innards (it was exactly enough when mixed with everything else), 1 - 14oz. can sweetened condensed milk, 2 eggs (they were not large), 2 tsp. cinnamon, 2 tsp. allspice (I was not about to spend $6 on "pumpkin pie spice"), 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 tsp. salt. It came out perfect. My first ever pumpkin pie. I like mine sweet, though, and it was exactly how I like it.

Very good classic pumpkin pie, nice and creamy and not too spicy. However, I prefer another pumpkin pie recipe from this site with streusel topping, which is fantastic.

Delicious, but I live in Canada and Eagle Brand only sells 300ml cans (10.14 oz). Very annoying having to buy two and throw away most of the second can.

This recipe is soooo good! And will be the ONLY pumpkin pie recipe that I use from now on! The only change that I made was adding an extra 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.

This recipe is brilliant. I can't cook at all but the recipe is so clearly described it came out perfect. The only problem was that in Wales we don't have pumpkin in a tin so I had to prep a full pumpkin, but it was well worth the effort!!

Amazing!! The first time we'd made pumpkin pie and we are in China so had to make it from scratch. We used the French Pastry Pie Crust and cooked and mashed the pumpkin ourselves. We also did not have nutmeg so we substituted it with 1/2tsp vanilla. Served alongside vanilla icecream this was heaven!! Wil def make again.

This pie was a hit at Thanksgiving! I skipped the nutmeg as I'm not a fan of the smell or taste. This pie still turned out scrumptious! Made a homemade crust I found on this site as well. This will be my go to pumpkin pie!

I made this following the recipe exactly and it was delicious! I did buy a frozen Tenderflake pie shell, and followed the directions on the box to bake the pie shell before adding the filling. Once it cooled, I added the pie filling and baked as the recipe called for. No soggy crust! I will be making this recipe again.

I make this every year with REAL pumpkin. I slice and steam our halloween pumpkins (which we only draw on, not cut). Once steamed the pumpkin is moist and the skin comes off easily. I mash all the ingredients together and follow the rest of the recipe. I get rave reviews. I have a couple of friends that "order" these pies from me every year!

Turned out "perfect" even for first-time pumpkie pie maker.  Followed suggestion by others to use 2 tsp. each of pumpkie pie spice and ground cinnamon + 1 tsp of vanilla.  After pie has baked for 30 mins. at 350 deg., I sprinkled streusel-pecan topping which I found on the Eagle Brand website with this recipe.  Doubling the recipe and using 29 oz. can of pumpkin filled up 2 deep-dish pie crusts.

This recipe is so easy and delicious.  The only different things I do are to use pumpkin pie spice instead and graham cracker crust. Making the pies today and I'm sure they'll be a hit as usual!

I was expecting more from this pie, but then again, it used sweetened condensed milk. I may look for a different recipe that doesn't use this ingredient. It just didn't blend in with all the ingredients. Brown sugar and milk might have worked better. Thanks again for the recipe.

Delicious!  I used a store-bought graham cracker crust, which was delicious, but the regular 9 in. size didn't hold all of the filing I had made.  I would recommend a deep-dish 9 in. size pie crust instead.  Otherwise, yum!

Best recipe out there! The only one I use for my pumpkin pies. My husband is not a huge fan of pumpkin pie, but loves this recipe when I make it with real pumpkin puree. Wonderful recipe!

I think this would be a better recipe if you used fresh pir pumpkins instead of using a canned pumpkin. Other than that it is good. Also, I think you should make your own pastry!

This was a very good tasting pumpkin pie. Although people who rate recipes while changing them annoy me to no end, I did leave out the ginger because I don't like ginger. That was the only change I made. The texture and taste of this pie was excellent.

Very easy to make.  I don't like pumpkin pie, but my family really liked this.  Just make sure you cover the outer part of the crust with aluminum foil or a pie crust guard - it will burn if you do not!  Also, make sure you read some of the top rated reviews - they are very helpful!

This pie was so easy and tasted perfect!! I think you need a deep dish pie crust to hold all the filling. My regular crust wouldn't quite hold it all. I elected to add a bit more cinnamon. Will use again.

I followed the instructions as written, but I increased the cinnamon to two teaspoons, added an extra teaspoon of freshly grated ginger, and 1/2 tsp of allspice. Very delicious. I'm keeping this recipe!

Made it as stated, no modifications.  With the exception, I heated up all the ingredients first before pouring into the pie crust.  The flavor was great and so was the consistency.  I usually make the Libby's recipe, but as of yesterday,  I have officially switched to the Eagle's pumpkin pie recipe.  Everyone loved it and said they preferred this one.

I took the advice of a fellow reviewer and warmed the pumpkin with the spices first.  The pie was pretty, but average.  Certainly there was nothing wrong with the pie, but it was just ok.

I loved this pumpkin pie. I'm picky about flavor and texture. This was perfect. I took the other reviewers suggestion and heated my mixture first. What a difference! Loved the sweetened condensed milk versus evap milk. Making this again!

I really didn't like this pie. Followed the recipe exactly. It came out leathery, not creamy like traditional pumpkin pie. Stick with Libby's recipe!UPDATE: I let it sit in the fridge overnight and it was MUCH better. Everyone really liked it.

I'd never made pumpkin pie before (since I'm not a fan), but my step-son always lamented not having it on Thanksgiving, so I told him I'd make it if he helped. It was easy and foolproof (I realized too late that I was out of nutmeg). I used the Eagle Brand sweetened condensed milk rather than evaporated milk, and it turned out so well that I didn't mind having some (and the kids all had seconds). My step-son gives it 5 stars.

Best pumpkin pie we ever ate!  Made it with a scant 2 C of fresh pureed pumpkins otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Our son in the past didn't like pumpkin pie, but not only devoured his piece but asked for seconds!

This recipe is very easy and tastes great, I do think it needs more spice though.  I like cloves in mine and I aslo like to use fresh pumpking puree.

I won't make this again, easy, yes, but I didn't like the texture, not nearly as custard like, as when I use evaporated milk with the pumpkin, too much ginger for my taste, but that's easily fixed, I will go back to my old stand by

This is really good! I'm Australian and this is the first time I've ever had pumpkin pie, so I don't really have anything to compare it to. Pleasantly surprised. I will try this with sweat potatoes next time. I used fresh pureed pumpkin instead of tinned.

Rave review right here! i was forced to make an adjustment in that i had evaporated milk instead of sweetened condensed, but its fine as long as you don't use all the evaporated milk (makes it too thin) and add a lot more sugar to taste.

WOW! Very Easy, cheap and delicious! I used fresh pumpkin (boiled and drained), a sheet of uncooked pastry in a pie dish, and skim condensed milk. Fabulous!

I cannot express how easy this recipe is.  And on top of that, it is very very good. As per other reviewers, heat the pumpkin and spices and let it cool off before mixing with other ingredients. I don't know if that was the reason or that i made it the night before and let it chill till Thanksgiving dinner (8pm, ugh). Heck it could have been both.  But this is really the easiest and best tasting. I want to get up and make it right now. But I just happen to be too lazy of an .  One day soon hopefully.  Tas

Perfect texture and flavor! Took the advice and took the pie out when a knife 1" from the crust came out clean. Everyone was impressed there weren't any cracks in the middle.

Really good and easy to prepare.  I gave 4 stars because I added just about double the spices and a couple tbsp brown sugar.  This pie bakes up nicely and doesn't crack when it's cooling like some.  Also bakes in the time posted in recipe.  Too bad I don't have a reason to make another one.

So simple and easy! I got so many compliments when I brought this to Thanksgiving dinner, and little did anyone know that this recipe is as easy as opening a couple cans and cracking open a couple of eggs!

The title says it all: PERFECT!  For the best pie crust I recommend The Marie Calenders frozen pie crust. A little more than the other brands but worth every single penny!

We don't eat pumkin pie in our house (and frankly, I don't like it at all) but a friend asked me to make her one for Thanksgiving.  I decided to give this one a try.  It came out beautiful and I decided to make one for us too...this pie really tastes good! While sweet potato will always be my favorite, this pie will do in a pinch.

This is the first pumpkin pie I ever made and it was definitely a hit with my friends!  Easier than I thought it would be!  I used some of the other reviews suggestions and heat the canned pumpkin and spices through first.  I also added 1/2 tbsp of vanilla.  Yummy!

Perfect and so easy!  If I knew making great pumpkin pie was this easy, I'd have done it years ago.  Cut back on the nutmeg - it overpowered the first pie.  Used the Kitchenaid to mix everything.  It's also a great base recipe to tweak.

This really is perfect! I just made it a couple of hours ago for dessert. My mom loved it; she even asked for a second serving! The only thing I changed was instead of using 1 tsp. of cinnamon I used 1/2 tsp. Delicious!

Wow wow wow, this was AMAZING! I made two for my family Thanksgiving and they were instantly devoured. Rich, creamy, with just the right amount of sweet. And not to mention, so simple to make! No alterations needed. Best pumpkin pie recipe I've come across yet.

Loved it and got rave reviews from the family for Thanksgiving. The condensed milk made for a thicker filling and the tip to warm the pumpkin puree with the spices really did make it taste more like fresh pumpkin

Everyone loved it. I do agree to pre bake the crust as i found that even after leaving the empty crust in the oven for 15 min. it still came out a bit soggy. Overall the taste was great. Thank you

GREAT recipe!  I followed it exactly for Thanksgiving Day, and everyone loved it.  I made two pies and followed the advice of another reviewer, and switched the pies to the other oven shelf halfway through the cooking process so they would cook evenly.  I made them a day ahead and then just warmed them in the oven while we ate our main meal.  Everyone raved about them.

I've used this recipe twice now for Thanksgiving... Last year, it came out beautiful. My mom doesn't like  pumpkin pie, but she LOVED this one. The texture was great... this is big in my texture-sensitive family! The only difference I made was I seasoned it to taste. Excellent recipe!

pretty good. I made it how the recipe said.It seemed to be missing something though... I used a marie callenders deep pie crust and doubled the whole recipe. I had a little left over that i used to marble a butter pecan cake mix i prepared as the box said then put the extra mix on top then ran and swirled a knife through it to marble. baked around 40 min at 325 in a 9x13 glass pan. it was AMAZING! 2 good desserts out of one recipe

I'm not one who really likes pumpkin pie, but I tried this anyway. It was delicious; I had two pieces!! I followed the directions of some of the other reviewers and put 2 tsp cinnamon, and heated the mixture a bit before putting it in the crust.

Very delicious indeed!!!! Made as directed, but used 2 1/2 tsps of Pumpkin pie spice. This is definitely a keeper. Whip cream and a bit of vanilla ice cream makes it even better.

I added 1/4 tsp ground allspice and an extra 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon, and I followed the tip to heat up the spice and pumpkin before mixing. (I did that until the mixture was very warm to the touch; it took a few hours to cool down!) The result was ABSOLUTELY DIVINE, I love this pie, so delicious! Tastes better if you leave it in the fridge overnight for the pie to firm up a bit. Great recipe!

DELICIOUS!  The changes I made were that I used only 1 whole egg and then 2 egg whites.  I also left out the salt.  The pie turned out very good.  This recipe is a keeper.

This is OK but it's definitely not as flavorful as Libby's recipe! It was too bland - it needed more.... I wasn't impressed with this and Libby's is just as easy to make and tastes a lot better.

With all the fancy schmancy pumpkin pie recipes, you simply cannot beat this recipe for pumpkin pie that has been baking in American households for generations!  Delicious!  I used Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust recipe here.. used a little less shortening than it called for.. flakey and butter (using butter flavored crisco).  Just SO GOOD!

Delicious! I didn't have sweetened condensed milk, so I made some by blending 1/2 c. hot water, 1 c. brown sugar, 1 c. powdered milk, and 3 T. melted butter. I used my own frozen pumpkin puree from the farmer's market. Great recipe!

Great recipe! I also had an unbaked pie crust that I put in the oven for about 10 minutes at 425 degrees so it wouldn't be soggy.  I also heated the pie from the can as suggested.

Okay, so I changed it up a bit, but still felt the need to review it. I doubled the recipe to make 2 deep dish pies. I made it with 1/2 pumpkin puree and 1/2 sweet potato puree. I also doubled the spices (plus a little bit extra), added 1 tsp. of vanilla, 1/2 tsp. cloves. Put into pre-made deep dish pie crusts. Cover edges with foil or they'll burn! Very good pie.

I have made many attempts to make pumpkin pie, all ending in disaster. This recipe has given me hope that the perfect pumpkin pie can be made from my hands. Simple and full of sweet pumpkin goodness no cook should ever turn this recipe down!

Read others reviews, added what others stated and then some. Used graham cracker crust. Heated the pumpkin along with the spices and salt. Instead of spices used 2 tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice and 1 tsp of cinnamon. When adding the milk and eggs also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Yummy!

Puree your fresh pumpkin! The flavor was good but I read somewhere that you can just mash your fresh pumpkin. WRONG. The texture of my pie was spongy and stringy- I'm assuming because I didn't puree it. Flavor was pretty good. I did substitute allspice for the nutmeg.

I didn't like this.  Maybe it was something that I did wrong but I dont know what because I followed the recipe to the T.  It tasted grainy to me for some reason. It wasnt the smooth pumpkin pie that I was used to.

excellent. I never really like pumpkin pie. I was more a pecan pie lover but this is a pit that competes. A pumpkin farm down the street always made great pumpkin pie extra sweet. and I know this is their secreat, sweet condensed milk instead of evaportated milk, makes it some much better.

This tasted great but the texture wasn't as solid as I was hoping for, more custard-y. The filling also made too much for the crust. I think I'd try less condensed milk next time.

Fabulous pie! The best ever! I adjusted according to others reviews: 1t PP spice in addition to the cin/ginger/nutmeg, and a pinch of cloves as my mix of pp spice doesn't have it in it. I heated pumpkin and spices first. Also wisked the eggs, added the scm and wisked into eggs before adding to pumpkin. I've never tasted a pp so good. Thanks!

Very easy and very delicious recipe! This is the first time I've made pumpkin pie and it's very nice! I used a ready rolled shortcrust pastry, I recommend blind baking it first otherwise the bottom might be a bit soggy. I baked for 15 mins, then another 35 and it came out nicely. The spices are very strong btw, so if you like it a bit milder then I suggest reducing the ginger and nutmeg a tiny bit. Great recipe, great pie!

I found that the texture wasn't as smooth as it should be. maybe should have used a mixer rather than whisk... the taste was delicious! did add extra seasonings as others suggested.

Very good pumpkin pie. The middle pie crust was a bit underdone. I might pre-bake the crust a bit before adding the filling next time.

From all the rave reviews, I was expecting to love this pie, but I didn't. The flavor was too mild for me. I'm used to a denser filling, with a stronger pumpkin flavor and more spice.

This pie is SO good!  I made it exactly as the recipe states and it came out fantastically.  I left the pie in the oven for about an hour after it stopped cooking and had no problems with cracking.

My first attempt at a pumpkin pie turned out delicious, thanks to this recipe and the No-Fail Pie Crust also found here.  I was out of ginger (oops) so had to use pumpkin pie spice instead.  Also added a dash of allspice.  The result was still superior to anything found in the store.  Looks like this will become a Thanksgiving staple from now on!

This is an excellent solid recipe, the pie is absolutely perfect -- just the right density and texture.

My only recommendations is to warm the crust for about 5 minutes first. And double or triple the spices, if you like a strong cinnamon kick like I do.

My husband says that this is one of the best pumpkin pies he has ever had.  I have never made a pumpkin pie and this was so easy.  I did change to 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice and 1 cinnamon.  I don't even like pumpkin pie, but this was good.

Not a crumb left on the pie plate!  My family loved this so much and it was easy to make.  I think this could possibly be the first fool-proof pumpkin pie recipe that I have made.

I was never a big fan of pumpkin pie, but since my husband is, I first made this for him years ago.  It is the best pumpkin pie I have ever had - very creamy, not too sweet or spicy.  I omitted the ginger, because it was never a spice I had regularily, and I don't miss it.  This is the only recipe I will use - a success every time.

This recipe is great, but I did heat up the canned pumpkin with the spices first before adding it to the condensed milk and the eggs.
Also to refine the taste, I add two tablespoons of pure maple syrup. It gives that little extra.

The name says it all! This pie is perfect. I made two of them to serve at Christmas, and they were a big hit. I thought they were best without any whipped cream so you really got the full effect.

I tried this for the first time on Thanksgiving.  My fiance credited it as the best pumpkin pie she ever ate.  Definitely, allow the spices to settle, I would recommend overnight.

This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever made.  I made these last year for the holidays and they were such a hit that I have been asked to make them again this year!  I love this recipe as is, but I am currently using pumpkin pie spice instead of all the seperate spices.

This was my first pumpkin pie attempt-- I have always opted to make something fancier-- so I was nervous about being the sole supplier of pumpkin pie at our Thanksgiving dinner.  I needn't have worried.  These pies (I made 2) were delicious and beautiful.  And easy! Perfect!

I made this pie and an apple pie for Thanksgiving.  By the end of the weekend the apple pie was long gone but the pumpkin pie was barely touched.  I felt like the condensed milk overpowered the flavor of the pumpkin.  I like a strong pumpkin and spice flavor, which is probably why I do not prefer this pie.  My mother in law said she liked the heavier denser pumpkin pies, so she thought it was ok.  I will not be making this again, but to be fair, if you are like my mother in law and like the heavier denser pumpkin pies, you will probably like this.

Amazing pumpkin pie recipe! The pie is so easy to make and tastes delicious. The only suggestion I would make is to use a deep dish style pie crust (if using pre-made crust) as it tends to overflow a bit. I've made this recipe two times already this season, and I'm sure I'll make it many more times in the future.

This turned out good - but the batter was quite dense, which made the pie pretty dense.  I will keep looking for 'my' pumpkin pie recipe.

Everyone raved about this pie.  I did cook the mixture for a bit before filling the crust as another reviewer suggested. I think it made a difference.  I also made my own pie crust.  Iâll make this again and again.

I guess with the other reviews I was expecting something out of this world. I usually make the traditional pumpkin pie with Milnot, however, short on time, I thought I'd try this version. It was good but I believe I like the texture of the traditional Libby's Pumpkin Pie as well as the overall flavor. However, this is a good pie recipe to keep on hand if you happen to have sweetened condensed milk rather than evaporated milk.

Followed recipe completely. This pie set up perfectly and looked beautiful. However, the only one out of 23 who did like the flavor was my 9 year old son. I think it's just too much ginger.

The pumpkin pie turned out great. We especially liked how thick and full the pie was. It settled very nicely to ending up mushy/runny like other recipes we've tried, perfect slices. One thing I would probably do next time I make this recipe is try to sweeten it more. I aslo would add more cinnamon, but the pie did taste good. Thankyou ^_^

you can substitute the canned pumpkin with fresh pumpkin and it tastes really good. just slice up the pumpkin and boil it for 20 minutes, peel the skin and mash it up. not as sweet  and still perfect!

I loved the taste and texture of this pie.  I enjoyed the ratio of spices, as sometimes I think that there is a tendency to use too much cinnamon.  This will replace the Libby's recipe as my go-to Thanksgiving pumpkin pie recipe.

This pumpkin pie was ok. It was very easy to make. I made this pie and my grandmothers recipe to compare and my grandmother's won hands down by everyone at our dinner.  It was more dense than I like it and not as flavorful.

Devine!

I made the crust from scratch and blind baked it so it would be flakey.  Other than that, the only change I made to the recipe was doubling the cinnamon.  

The pumpkin pie was easy to make and came out absolutely perfect.  It was truly the best pumpkin pie I've ever had!

The texture was light. I like that the flavor isn't too sweet. I added 1/4 tsp. of clove and 1/2 tsp. of allspice. I also followed the suggestion to heat the spices and pumpkin on the stovetop so that the flavors could meld. I used a deep dish crust, and the filling fit perfectly.

This is an awesome pumpkin pie, I've never heard of making it with condensed milk! This is my go-to pumpkin pie recipe from now on, hardly 'bland and horrible' IMO. The only change I made was a little extra cinnamon and a tiny bit of ground cloves. Great texture, super easy to make!

The BEST pumpkin pie recipe.  This was YUMMY.  I did use my own fresh pumpkin, not canned.  I did add one tablespoon of "pumpkin spice" only because I used fresh, and the canned is loaded with 'stuff'. (another word comes to mind)
I absolutely loved this.  Again, cracked an egg into the pie shell to 'seal' it, prevents soggy crust. (roll the egg around the crust til it's covered, then dump the egg in the sink)

This recipe was awesome.  We have 0 slices left of two pies.  It worked out easily and great.  I did heat the ingredients over the range for a brief time to get things together.  I also used pumpkin pie spice instead of the collection of different spices, with adding extra cinnamon.  Thanks!

Very easy, very good. I used a graham cracker crust and added 2 tbs of pumpkin pie spice instead of the individual cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. The only thing I should have done was bake the crust a little before filling. It mushed up a little in the middle.

As others suggested, I combined the canned pumpkin puree and spices over low heat to get rid of the "canned taste."  I used a graham cracker crust instead of a pie shell.  The only thing I would change is to reduce the baking time from 35 to 30 minutes.  But overall, this recipe is extremely easy and produces a classic, delicious pumpkin pie.

This really is the only way to make pumpkin pie, simple and to the point - everyone else just tries to do too much. However, I never use canned pumpkin.  I buy 3 pumpkins at a farmer's market every fall, bake them off and freeze them for use over the holiday season.  It really is worth the small amount of time you'll put in doing it! (No worries about that "canned" taste here!)

Hmmmm YUM! This is so easy to make, and so delicious! I used the mini graham cracker crusts for single serving pies (10) and it came out really good. I do think though, next time I might increase the spice.

This version of a pumpkin pie had a richer taste than the old evaporated milk recipe. With my DH's enthusiastic backing, I am now making this one our Go To pumpkin pie recipe.

Great!  We had some sugar pumpkins to use up, so we made this with the real thing rather than canned.  Turned out lighter and more delicate than most pumpkin pies I've had.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it didn't let me down. I was the first in my family to actually bake a homemade pumpkin pie and they all loved it. My husband asked me a few weeks after to make him another one.

I'm giving this 5 stars despite the fact that I didn't have any since I don't like pumpkin pie. My son has always wanted a fresh pumpkin pie, so I made both, this is the one he loved.

This was the best Pumpkin Pie recipe. I hadn't made Pumpkin Pie before but it was very easy and came out great. A few of my guests told me that they weren't big on Pumpkin Pie but after some great reviews from the rest of the party tried it and LOVED it! Will def. be making this again.

I have never made a pumpkin pie before in my entire life....unfortunately it is my hubby's favorite!  This pie is awesome!  I took some suggestions of heating the pumpkin puree and I added 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp cinnamon.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I'm no cook, and even with my 'skills' this pie came out wonderfully! A big hit at our Halloween party. I used a little less egg to give it a lighter texture, and a gluten-free crust so that I could actually eat it - Wonderful!

The is truly THE perfect pumpkin pie recipe. This was actually the first pumpkin pie to ever grace our Thanksgiving table this past year. We've had pumpkin pie before, just never on Tgiving. But I wanted to make it and it was delicious. My top wasn't smooth at all so it wasn't the most pretty pie, but that didn't affect taste. Also, I needed to put foil over the crust edges toward the end to prevent burning. But my aunt said it was the best pumpkin pie she had ever tasted. It only lasted until lunch on Friday for leftovers. This will be the recipe used from now on!

This recipe is great. Very easy to prepare and ready in no time. I had a hard time finding the ground ginger so I decided to omit the spices and just used allspice. My family loved it!!

This turned out VERY well. I did follow the suggestions of warming up the pumpkin mixture and using pumpkin pie spice along with a couple extra teaspoons of cinnamon. Great flavor, great texture, and I could not have been happier.

Delicious.  Like the others, I did add some pumpkin pie spice to the other spices called for, and it turned out perfectly!

SO GOOD!  Instead of using a regular pie crust, I instead used a gingersnap & graham cracker crumb crust...really complemented the flavor of the pie!

I found this a reliable pumpkin pie recipe. I liked how the sweetened condensed milk affected the outcome - it was good & firm, yet tasty. Definitely recommended in my book!  I thought the balance of sweet was just right (and I tend to have a sweet tooth, FWIW).

MMMmmm! This is the perfect pumpkin pie. I tried this recipe because I had opened the can of pumpkin and then realized I didn't have evaporated milk like my usual recipe called for. So I scrambled and found this recipe and am so glad that I did. This will be the recipe I use from now on.

This turned out so good! My family absolutely loved it! I received so many compliments. I followed the advice of warming the pumpkin puree and spices before adding the sweetened condensed milk and eggs. I did not use the nutmeg, but instead used 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, and 1 tsp of ground ginger. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was well recieved. I've made many different versions of pumpkin pie in the past (including Martha Stewart's recipe) and this pie is the best. This pie converted my husband, an admitted pumpkin pie hater. Now that's something.

I made this pie for the first time the night before Thanksgiving, and it was really easy and delicious. I used my own pre-baked pie crust recipe. Added 3/4 cup sugar to the filling mixture and used 1/4 teas cloves instead of nutmeg. After 30 minutes in the oven, I covered the edges of my crust with tin foil, so the crust stayed nice and golden brown.

This recipe was fantastic!!  I did substitute a store bought graham cracker crust for the traditional crust and it was delicious...would recommend trying it, it gives the pie that much more flavor!!  My mom who is not a fan of pumpkin pie even loved it!!

I have never baked a pumkin pie before, but received a lot of requests for it this Thanksgiving, so I thought what the heck...It was a big hit, everyone said it truly was the best pumpkin pie they had eaten. I used pumkin pie spice and I turned off the heat and let it cool in the oven. No cracks at all, picture perfect.

Very good and very easy.  I used fresh pumpkin: it's only a little extra work, and it turns out better than the canned version.  Don't be afraid to boil some pumpkin, it's even easier than making mashed potatoes :).

I made this pie the week before Thanksgiving and OMG I had a slice everyday! I couldn't stop eating it. The only thing I did different was that I added pumpkin pie spice instead of the ginger and nutmeg, only because I didn't have those here at home. I'll definitely be making this pie again.

Awesome pumpkin pie! It was exactly how it was suppose to be. The thing I liked about this recipe is that it wasn't too sweet like a lot of store bought pumpkin pies are. It had just the right amount of all the spices. I would definitely make this again!

Excellent!  My first time making pumpkin pie and it was so easy...prepping was so simple.  I made the pie crust and all in all, it took 15 minutes to the oven!  I can taste the nutmeg well balanced with ginger and cinnamon.  Be careful not to add too much nutmeg, it will over power all the flavor in the pie.  I love nutmeg but too much of it can taste very unpleasant.  Just follow the recipe and you'll just love it!

This was my first time making pumpkin pie. Everyone loved it and it was so easy to make. This recipe actually had enough pie filling for two crusts. This was less spicy than pumpkin pies I'm used to, but delicious!

Wonderful pumpkin pie!  I used 2 cups of cooked fresh crookneck pumpkin in place of the canned and it was excellent.  Very creamy.

This is a very easy pie and by using a glass pie plate, I had a pumpkin pie without a soggy bottom crust. I did add one additional egg white along with the two whole eggs and a 1/4 tsp. salt , a tsp of vanilla extract and an 1/8 tsp of ground cloves. My Thanksgiving guests loved it!

This was the first time I ever made any kind of pie. I read some of the reviews and based on that ended up adding about a third cup of sugar and a pinch of ground cloves. It came out absoultely delicious (actually had to make it with cooked fresh pumpkins since I was in India and canned pumpkin is not available there. I was a bit concerned about how the consistancy would be with the fresh pumpkin, but it was just fine). Definitely a keeper!

Great pie! I absolutely loved the consistency. I also loved the graham cracker crust. Here's the combination of spices I used, and it came out to the perfect combination of spice and sweet.

-- 1 tablespoon molasses
-- 1 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
-- 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
-- 1/4 teaspoon allspice
-- 1/2 teaspoon salt
-- 1 teaspoon vanilla
-- 1 heaping teaspoon dark brown sugar

I chilled for about an hour before serving, and then garnished with maple-flavored leaf shaped cookies, as well as a sprinkle of ground cloves on top. Served with Cool Whip.

The batter was so thin and pale I was afraid it wouldn't turn out. But it baked up just fine. Very light and moussy. I found it was a mild flavour and may try more spices next time. That might have also been the pumpkin I used- it was a fresh Crown pumpkin and I'm not sure how suited to pie it is. My five guests, none of whom had eaten pumpkin pie before said they liked it.

My husband and youngest son gobbled this pie up in no time. The only negative comment was the crust that I used. I used a crust thats rolls out (dough boy) and I did have it in the fridge awhile but not expired and that will never happen again. Only fresh ingredients for this recipe.

This was very good!  It turned out creamy and delicious.  I did add more cinnamon, and like others warmed up the pumpkin and spice mixture before adding the milk and eggs.  I will make this recipe again.

Simply delicious! I didn't change a thing about the recipe. The only mistake I made was only making one pie. It was gone so quickly, that I didn't even get a slice for myself! I only had one bite of someone else's slice. Everybody loved it!

I try to add a new recipe to our holiday tradition each year. I am a grandother and this is the first pumpkin pie I have ever made. I made it for a family Thanksgiving dinner! It was so easy! We all agree with the name . . . it was perfect! Everyone raved about it! Our grandsons had seconds and took some home. It is now a part of our family tradition.

Oh my Goodness. This was DELICIOUS!!!! Better than my Mother in laws, which says alot!
I used pumpkin spice instead of ginger and nutmeg, like one reviewer said, and it really made a big difference.  My husband and I also love lotsa cinnamon so I ended up putting 1 and 1/2 teaspoon of it in the recipe.
Fabulous Idea. everyone will be stunned when they eat it up tomorrow! :)
thanks so much!

YUMMY, My hubby loved it! 

I took the advice of a reviewer and didn't use the salt, ginger or nutmeg, instead I used 2 tsp. of pumpkin spice and 1 tsp. of cinnamon, I thought I'd try it since I had a new pumpkin spice jar. Anyway, this pie came out great! thanks!!

I didn't change a thing! This was the easiest pie to make.  I was nervous about the fact that it didn't call for any extra sugar, but it didn't matter.  I agree with an earlier review that it was nice not to have the filling sloshing around and spilling.  I made one for the family and one to share at Thanksgiving with the extended family tomorrow.  I'm anxious to hear what others think.

this is a very yummy pie!  i normally don't like pumpkin pie...i think this one tones down the pumpkin flavor.  i did heat the pie and spices on the stove first (and oops, the condensed milk as well!) and i only used half the amount of ginger to make it less spicy for my daughter's kindergarten class.  i also used fresh grated nutmeg.  she helped me make it and loved the flavor as well.  i can't stop eating the leftovers!  sooo good even when snuck straight out of the fridge.  i don't think it needs added sugar...there is a lot of condensed milk.

I used this recipe for my first pie ever, and it was a success! I wasn't sure how much of the spices to use, since every reviewer seemed different on their preferences, etc, but I used the 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp cinnamon that was recommended by others, and it was a tad bit too spicy for me and my mom's likings.. next time I would probably just use extra cinnamon, but that is only my preference. I used an already-made frozen pie crust. The edges were a little dark (even when I covered it with foil), and it bubbled a little on top (it dried with 'bubble' imprints). Otherwise, the consistency and taste was great. 
Very easy recipe to follow as well.

We like pumpkin pie anyway, but this was fantastic! It made a lot of filling, so for Thanksgiving, I am going to try to get 2 pies out of 1 recipe.

The easiest pumpkin pie recipe. I always add 2 Tablespoons of molasses. I  think it needs that little bit of extra sweetening. Also, use "One Pie" pumpkin, if you can find it. Doesn't have the tinny taste and smell that some other brands have.

Excellent pie!!  Made a few adjustments per some other reviewers (more cream cheese and spices) and it turned out wonderful.  I'm not a great fan of pumpkin but as a cheesecake it was great.  Had some extra better so I'm gonna put that in some graham cracker tarts to have mini cakes.  YUM !!

I've been using this recipe for years with great reviews. Instead of "fresh" pumpkin-which is very grainy-a local farmer's market suggested I try Hubbard Squash. It's fanastic! I bake it covered with an inch of water to steam until soft; and scoop it out when cooled. 2 and 1/4 cups of the squash is substituted for pumpkin. I like a little extra cinnamon too. It makes a very creamy texture. Whipped cream a must!

This was great. I have always used evaporated milk as my Mother, my gradmother did. But now this will be the only way to make it. I always use fresh pumpkin, I think it makes a big differance  in the taste of the filling and this just made this recipie better!

honestly, i do not like pumpkin pie - but the family loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly - no changes.  boy did the house smell great while it was baking.  I do have to say - the pie took much long to back then the recipe said... no big deal - just FYI!

The absolute best classic pumpkin pie recipe out there!  I make sure to stock up on the ingredients at the beginning of fall so that I can bring a pie when invited over.

This was really great. I had tried another pumpkin pie recipe from this site a few days earlier and was not happy with the results. I DON'T like the souffle-like pumpkin pies, I like them dense and "set" - this recipe did it. 
I used a pre-made graham crust, added a little more cinnamon than what was called for... delicious. Top with lots of whipped cream. Just don't go overboard with the nutmeg - do exactly what it calls for and none more because you can really taste it in there.

I thought everyone made pumpkin pie this way! It's the only way I've ever known, and it's fool proof and perfect each and every time. What could be easier --canned pumpkin, egg, cond. milk and spices! (Especially if you an "Already Pie Crust" from the refrigerator section of the super market!)  --It's home baked!

This is the pumpkin pie recipe I've been making for years. I occasionally try others, just for the fun of it, but this tried and true recipe is always a hit. A dollop of whipped cream on top and you are in good shape.  :-)

This is my signature pumpkin pie recipe.  My husband says that I make the best pumpkin pie ever. I double it and use a large can of pumpkin so we have one to eat and one to share. This recipe is amazing, and as it's name indicates a "perfect" recipe. I do not change a thing.

This is a wonderful pie. I only made a few additions: added cloves, made a homemade pie crust, and also added homemade whipped cream. Wonderful! My husband said it was my best pumpkin pie yet!! Will definitely be making a lot this season.

Amazing!  So easy to make, it's pretty much idiot proof (which I found very handy:))  I used the light condensed milk which still tasted great and saved a few calories...

This was the first time I ever made a pumpkin pie! very easy,I used a shortbread crust that turned out really good, and it was the perfect sweetness, I did not add any extra sugar.

The best pumpkin pie - always a hit.  I am not a big fan of nutmeg so I refuse to own any. Instead I use the pumpkin pie spice but double the amount suggested - otherwise it comes out very bland. Not overly sweet so I might try others suggestion to add sugar. However, it is excellent as is and the pie usually picks up some sweetness from the whipped cream we put on top.

I made two of these pies, both turned out wonderful. Next time I will actually make it the day before to let the spices settle. Tasted even better the second day.

Excellent recipe.  This is such an easy pie to make and it always comes out perfect.  The only change I made was using fresh pumpkin (I think it tastes much better than canned).

I definitely liked this pie, wouldnt say I loved it. I loved the texture but I feel like it wasnt very sweet compared to most other pumkin pies I have tasted. So if you'd like it more sweet, use slightly less pumpkin and make sure you scrape out absolutely all the condensed milk from the can.

So good!  And easy!  I used a shortbread crust and it really gave it extra taste.  The only difference I did was add an extra half to the spices and a pinch of cloves.

My grandmom said it was the best pumpkin pie she has ever eaten, and she's fussy.  :)

This was the first time I made pumpkin pie.  I didn't think it was the best but other people told me they liked it.  I might have messed up the spices.  Since this recipe has such high ratings I think I will try it again with a different brand of pumpkin and being more careful with the spices.  I used the Best Ever Pie Crust from this site which I really like.

Great recipe!  I did not change anything in the recipe.  The only thing I had to add was foil to the edge of the pie crust because it was starting to brown when I checked it to turn the heat down.  It came out great.  This was my first time making a pumpkin pie so I was thrilled when everyone liked it!  I will definately make this one again!!

My 12 year old daughter,13 year old niece and my sister-in-law, all loved this pie.  No leftovers here!  I did add 1 extra tsp of cinnamon, a pinch of cloves and a couple shakes of pumpkin pie spice to try to overcome the "blandness" that some people mentioned.  I thought it was a little too much, but everyone else said it was wonderful!

This was a very good recipe; however, I prefer my pumpkin pies a bit sweeter. For this reason, I probably will try a different pumpkin pie recipe next time. This recipe did turn out very well though, it is just a matter of prefrence.

My son loves pumpkin pie and he really liked this recipe. He said it was the best. Everyone at Thanksgiving enjoyed it very much. I had never made homemade pumpkin pie before. This was ridiculously easy - I will NEVER buy the box pie again (sorry Mrs. Smith). Very easy and so good!!!

Perfect!  I did make my cinnamon on the "heaping" side and added a shake of ground cloves since previous reviewers mentioned this was a bit bland.  It just goes to further my theory that almost anything is better with sweetened condensed milk. :)

This pumpkin pie was so easy and good. 

I had never made a pumpkin pie before, and it turned out great. Everyone loved it. 

The only change I made was adding an additional 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.

It looked great, too. Nobody could believe me when I told them it wasn't store-bought.

Great recipe. I liked it just as much as my other recipe, and it had less ingredients! I used the conversion to 2 servings and made it in the mini pie shells, they were done in 20 minutes!

Was delicious. my crust was a little burned but I believe that is the fault of my oven.  All but that crust was great!  I'll make this again.

Very easy to make. Made this for T-Day potluck dinner and people loved it. I added some more cinnamon though, as other people in the reviews mentioned. Very delish!

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out delicious!  It is a bit of a surprise to see the puffiness when you first remove it from the oven, but be assured that it does flatten out into a "normal" looking pumpkin pie.  Super creamy and super easy!!

This was a great and simple recipe!  I thought the texture was a little creamier than the evaporated milk version.  The flavor was good, however I would add a bit more spice to mine next time.  I put foil on my crust edges while baking and it came out perfect.  I will be using this recipe again next year.

This pie was well received.  Would make again, but just didn't see anything spectacular about it.  It is a very good pie, though.

This was my first attempt at pumpkin pie and it turned out great. The only change I made was to add a bit of ground clove along with the other spices.

I have to say this is very good pumpkin pie.  I myself am not a pumpkin pie eater, but my husband is.  The only thing he commented on was it was a little dry as if I may have baked it too long, but he says the flavor is very good!  HAPPY THANKSGIVING!!!

This is a great fool proof recipe for beginners! I use a 6 oz. graham cracker crust.  Just enough spices but not overpowering.

I was a little disappointed in this pie.  I thought it was bland and I didn't care for the consistency.
