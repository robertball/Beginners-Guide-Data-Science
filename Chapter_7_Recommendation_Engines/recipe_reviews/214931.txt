I make this all the time, and it's unbelievably good!  I use this recipe exactly, except I've never tried it with garlic.  I'm going to try it next time! Also, instead of tossing the asparagus with the parmesan, I toss with all the other ingredients and lay in a single layer, then sprinkle the parmesan all over the top.  I bake mine at 350 degrees for 10-12 minutes, depending on the thickness of the asparagus.  Oh, and a hint: if you line the baking sheet with aluminum foil, there's hardly any clean up!

I prepared the asparagus exactly as the recipe indicated, including all the optional ingredients.  It was delicious, but very salty.  I recommend reducing the salt to 1/2 tsp or 1/4 tsp.

I make asparagus this way all the time!  Didn't know it could taste so good!  Do add the garlic though...I don't use the lemon juice.  400 degrees for 10 minutes works in my oven.

Best way I've cooked asparagus yet!  I coated the asparagus with everything but the parmesan cheese.  Then when I put it on a foil lined cookie sheet, I sprinkled the cheese.  When it cooked the cheese got crispy and gave it a kind of deep fried texture.  It was great, and easy and will make it this way everytime.

Optional Parmesan, garlic, and lemon juice - a definite yes to all three! This is excellent and turned out perfectly.

Nice recipe, however I prefer my asparagus to be a little crisper. 12 minutes was too long for the thick stalks I had... 8 minutes would be about right at 425.

A tasty, easy-to-prepare asparagus recipe. Like other reviewers I would say 12 minutes is altogether too long for thin stalks. Six to eight minutes works for me. I added all the optional ingredients, except the lemon juice, halved the salt and oil (there was lots) and served with Salmon with Brown Sugar Glaze (also from this site). Thanks for the recipe.

Be sure to follow the footnote tip to remove tough part of stem by snapping the asparagus in two.  The fresher it is, the better this works, so I do this as soon as I get home from the store (also makes weeknight cooking quicker & easier when I am ready to make).  I also like to line the baking sheet with aluminum foil for easy clean up.  Instead of tossing with olive oil I spray with cooking spray after the asparagus is spread in an even layer on the sheet.  I promise it tastes just as good.  Then I sprinkle with coarse salt & fine pepper (sprinkle from up high to more evenly distribute the seasonings).

Made this last night, and boy, was it GOOD!!!!!!!  I did not use the lemon juice, because I thought the garlic, salt, pepper and parmesan would be enough flavor...it was so tasty, my hubby and I ate the WHOLE bunch!  We prefer our asparagus to be a little more crisp, so I only roasted it for 10 mins as opposed to the 12-15.  Don't think I'll ever make asparagus any other way!  Thanks for sharing!

For the taste to effort ratio this recipe comes up trumps. I didn't use the lemon juice and didn't measure the ingredients just kinda did it by eye so I used less oil and salt than was needed. I also sprinkled the parmesan over before baking. Yum and so easy. Thank you

My husband brought home fresh asparagus today and having never made it I quickly started searching for recipes.  I followed the recipe exactly and did not use the optional lemon.  It was amazing!  I've always disliked asparagus finding it reedy, bitter and occasionally a bit slimy.  This was perfect, in every way!

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.  My husband said it is the best asparagus he has ever eaten...and that's really saying something!

Loved it! Simple good dish. I did add some Italian seasoning to make the flavor mesh better with our Italian meal, but that is the only change I made!

Great recipe if you add all of the optional ingredients. I would prepare the dish directly in the baking pan in lieu of a separate mixing bowl in the future. I also recommend less olive and shorter cooking time if you prefer a crisp asparagus, otherwise this is a perfect flavorful side dish. Husband loved and it was easy to make!

Used EVOO, salt and pepper, garlic powder and parmesan. Tossed asparagus in olive oil, generously sprinkled my spices, baked it and it was HEAVENLY. My dad who hates "rabbit food" (vegetables) raved about it and everyone wished I made more. Keep a careful eye on them, mine only took 6-8 minutes at that hot of an oven. I lowered the temp to 350 and they browned a little slower - less chance of a quick burn.

Excellent recipe because it tastes great and is super easy & quick to prepare!  I put the asparagus and oil in a bowl with a leak-proof lid and shake it together first.  Then add the rest of the ingredients and shake again until the asparagus is evenly coated.

Just perfect!  Easy and delicious!!  I put my asparagus in a ziploc bag and tossed them with all the ingredients.  The garlic is a must!  The only thing I did different was added garlic salt instead of regular salt.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I am blown away by this. I had no idea it would turn out this good. Even my husband said it was really, really good, and he's a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy. I halved the salt and still think it's salty, so maybe next time I'll use 1/4 teaspoon, but that's my only complaint. I did sprinkle some sliced almonds over the asparagus after it was spread out on the baking sheet, and that was a nice touch.

Love this. I don't use lemon juice but I do add frozen broccoli & cauliflower and I wait to put the parmesan cheese on until the last couple minutes. I can eat a cookie sheet of veggies all by myself

After removing from oven, cover to let flavors build. Five to seven minutes for crisp-tender spears.

I made this along with another asparagus dish (asparagus with junk from this site) because I wasn't sure which way our guests would like the asparagus. I followed the recipe except I cut down the sea salt in half, I think if you use regular table salt you can use as much as stated in the original recipe but sea salt gives it a way better flavor. I also only had parmesan & Romano cheese blend in fridge. I cleaned the asparagus drizzled with olive oil in a bowl then added the rest of the ingredients after I put the asparagus onto a cookie sheet lined with tin foil. I rolled the asparagus in salt, pepper and garlic then sprinkled the parm and roasted in oven at 325 for about 18 min. This was a huge hit, every spear was devoured. Thank You for sharing

I just found this recipe yesterday and made it with 3 other allrecipes recipes last night.  Very tasty and easy to make, even with other items cooking that needed attention.  I did not use the garlic, but I think that would be delicious too.  The parmesan was a great addition without being overpowering.

I made this as is with no additions and alterations and we loved this! Will def. make again. However, I will use less sea salt and pepper. I don't think it needed that much

Great asparagus recipe!! I don't even usually like asparagus (my husband loves it though so I have to cook it every now and then) but these came out so flavorful and tender it was impossible not to like it! I will definitely be making this again!

I accidently over cooked my asparagus, but I won't give the recipe less stars over my mistake.  Other than being over cooked, the flavor was there. It was a light, yummy side dish!

Wow.  Now, I have ONLY ever eaten asparagus steamed, leaving me under the impression of a gross-tasting vegetable.  My husband has had the same experience.  But this recipe ... wow!  Delicious!  I had no idea asparagus could taste this good!  I halved the recipe for my husband and I, used very thin stalks of asparagus, and omitted (by accident) the lemon juice.  There were no leftovers.  I think I'll use a little less salt next time, as the amount called for is a bit too much, but I KNOW this recipe will be in my rotation of side dishes!  Thank you!

This was superb.  Everyone wanted seconds and my daughter who hates asparagus ate every single bit I gave her.  I followed the recipe to the tee except for adding extra parmesan cheese on top before putting in the oven.  I didn't use lemon juice either.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.

Use less salt.  Also, instead of using olive oil and minced garlic, use garlic olive oil.

I should have heeded the other reviewers who said that 12 minutes was too long for thin asparagus.  Mine turned out dry and chewy rather than tender.  I may try again with a shorter roasting time.

So good!!! I followed another reviewers advice and tossed in everything  but the parm cheese, put on a baking pan then drizzled the left over oil/garilc over the asparagus and dusted with the parm cheese after layered out on the baking sheet. Baked for 20 mins to get crispy tips. So good!!!!

One of my favorite ways of eating vegetables is roasting, and this is no different.  I sprayed the asparagus with my olive oil pump so ended up with much less that the recipe calls for.  Also, the Parmesan browned too much, almost burned.  Next time I'll add the cheese later in the cooking process.  Left out the garlic since my main course had a lot of it.  I did include the lemon juice, that really adds a lot to this!

A picky eater loved it. I substituted crushed bread crumbs for parmesan cheese simply because I didn't have it on hand at the time. Incredibly easy to make. Mine was ready in 8 minutes @ 450 degrees. Thankkkks!

Love this recipe! I was afraid to try to roast this vege until I read some of the reviews. I followed all rules maybe a little tweek of mine, which only means a little less of this and that, but on the whole this recipe rocks! Heat is right on target, what you add to "season" is your choice, but use amounts of oil or butter as this recipe states and you will not be disapointed.

I just prepared this recipe...and followed the recipe to the T.  What a sad waste of good asparagus! I did read over 30 reviews before preparing this so I was excited to serve this for dinner....it got thumbs down all around. I love this site so I will continue to look for a new recipe for this veggie.

This was the first time I made Asparagus and it was delicous. I didn't read the directions right and mixed them with the lemon then baked and they were great. I also didn't add the Parm to the mix, but sprinkled it on after I had laid them on the baking sheet, which was lined with foil to clean easily. Oh and finally I cooked it at 400 for 10 minutes with a piece of Tilapia, which was cooked perfectly when the Asparagus was done.

Parmesan cheese, garlic, and lemon juice were not optional in my book so I used all three.  The flavor was good but I would use caution with the cooking time.  My asparagus was thick so I checked it the first time after ten minutes and it was a little overdone for me, although my husband thought it was perfect.

I didn't use the parm cheese and this was delicious.  Next time I might use the cheese for a different flavor.  Either way, this recipe is so easy and great.  I spread the asparagus out on a foil lined baking sheet and brushed on about 1 TB of olive oil then sprinkled with a roasted garlic seasoning blend, salt & pepper.  Yum

Loved this recipe!  My husband - who doesn't like vegetables at all - said he really like this!  But it is VERY salty....I only use 1/2 of what the recipe calls for.

This is the ONLY way I will prepare asparagus now - it is absolutely delicious!  I don't measure out the ingredients, I just eyeball it (I don't think I get anywhere near a teaspoon of sea salt - I just sprinkle it over the asparagus after it's on the baking sheet).  12 minutes is the sweet spot in my oven for the average, grocery store bought (maybe 1/4" wide?) stalks I've used so far.  Oh, and I use shredded parmesan, not the grated stuff that comes in a can - it makes these delicious little parmesan crisps from the bits that fall onto the pan :)
Try cutting up the asparagus & throwing it into an omelet the next day - YUM!!

My husband rated this a 10 and said it was restaurant quality!  My only complaint was that I felt there was too much oil.  It began to smoke a little in the oven and I took the baking tray out partway through and wiped quite a lot of oil off the tray.  Next time I'll use about 1TB total.  Unlike others, I didn't feel it was too salty.  I did use all optional ingredients.  Great recipe!

This is the first recipe that I've bothered to take the time to rate.  I put the lemon in during the cooking time (didn't pay attention to the recipe), omitted the salt (health reasons) and it was amazing.  My new go to recipe for asparagus!  Will recommend to my cooking friends.

I made this last night to add with our grilled tilapia.  It was great!  My husband absolutely devoured it! My youngest didn't care for it as he preferred when I steam it better.  My favorite part was the way the Parmesan cheese hardened and gooey.  The asparagus was very crisp and tasty.  We will surely serve this again!  Thanks!  :)

Loved it! I added some sliced baby bella mushrooms that I didnt want to go to waste and added the minced garlic. The taste was spot on! The only complaint was that I should have made more, and trust me, I'll be sure to do that.  I also cooked the veggies at 350 for 15 minutes and they were nice and tender. Thanks!

I didn't measure out my ingredients, but just sprinkled with what amount looked good. It is a great combination of flavors that work perfectly with the asparagus!

Yum! Although if you have really thin spears, cook them less than 15 min. and use less oil. The flavoring was delicious! So easy and nutrious for you! Goes great with the Marinatted Mushrooms II recipe, a little rice, and salmon.

This turned out perfectly.  The asparagus tasted good and it had a nice texture.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic and I didn’t have the lemon juice.  Since the Parmesan cheese was optional, I just sprinkled a little on top.

Loved this, and it's easy to fit in as a side dish.  I mixed the asparaus, olive oil, garlic  and romano cheese right on the baking tin covered with nonstick reynolds wrap, using clean hands.  Then I  sprinkled lemon juice and a few turns of the pepper (this saves having to wash another dish).  Also left out the seasalt, as the romano cheese and lemon seem to pick up the flavor without it.  Ok, I'm a lazy cook...

Super easy and super tasty. I was a little worried about the negative comments all claiming that the recipe was a little too salty. So I used half the salt the first time, and the full amount the second time. I really enjoyed it!

Not sure what happened, as I followed the recipe as-is, but the asparagus turned out extremely salty. We took one bite and had to throw it out. Disappointing, because it looked so great in the photos!

Cooking time and the rest of the seasonings were ok, but this was waaaaaay too salty! I couldn't eat it, had to throw away the batch after a few bites. Maybe 1/8 tsp salt would be more appropriate.

Great recipe - FYI - I skim the edge of the asparagus with a potato peeler (this enables asparagus to be softer to eat) and I do not use salt and I found when I added the parmesan cheese - the cheese burnt - so next time I will add cheese when close to finish cooking

Very tasty recipe and definitely husband approved.  I did not use the optional ingredients only the oil, a small amount of salt and the pepper.  I did not use a separate bowl just put the asparagus on the baking tray and coated with the oil and salt and pepper.  I did not have thin asparagus so I used a trick that I saw on a cooking show and peeled the asparagus stalks. (after snapping off the woody part of the stalks.)  This was the most tender asparagus that we have even eaten.  I also baked for 10 minutes at 350 degrees since I had the main course cooking at that temp and it turned out perfect.

I will never eat asparagus another way! It is so good roasted! It comes out great with just olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper. Most of the time I don't even use the cheese or lemon juice.

Husband is the asparagus lover - he really liked this but thought it was a bit too salty.  Would change oven to 400 next time as it looked "doner" than I like!  I didn't think it was too salty, but easy fix for the next time!

This is a delicious way to make Asparugus. They make this at the Cancer Treatment Centers of American in Tulsa, OK where I go for treatment. This is the first time I tried Asparagus and will not make it any other way. The only thing they don't add is Parmesan cheese and I have not tried it with Parmesan.

I actually like the taste of asparagus.  I made the recipe as written here, but discovered that I don't care for pepper or garlic or parmesan cheese on my asparagus.  I'd also recommend using vegetable oil vs. olive oil.  At this high temperature, the olive oil will impart it's flavor, and maybe overpower the asparagus flavor.   However, I am grateful for the time (12 mins) and temperature (425 degrees) because the spears came out nicely done but still firm!

This was delicious and very easy. I made this almost exactly as directed. I forgot to add the lemon juice at the end and I did not have fresh garlic on hand so I used about a tsp. or so of garlic powder, which seemed to work well. I will be making this again and will definitely try with the lemon and fresh garlic. I lined the baking sheet with foil for almost no clean up. Thanks for the great recipe!

Hating asparagus since I was a child, this recipe has transformed my opinion of it. It is delicious when prepared this way! Many have said that the timing is too long, but I found 12-15 minutes to be perfect. I used a Pampered Chef grill basket lined with tin foil. I also tossed in some mushrooms. Then I loosely covered the top with tin foil as well. Yum!

This is a nice recipe, and definitely something we'll make regularly. We did make a couple of changes from the stated recipe: Definitely cut down on the salt, as others have stated. We did not use the lemon juice, and we sprinkled with shredded Parmesan after we took the asparagus out of the oven. 10 minutes at 425 yielded a very nice finished product.

This is incredibly tasty, and very easy. I will roast my asparagus from now on! I used a little less oil than the recipe calls for, and a little less salt. Line your pan with foil for easy clean up! I also turned them over halfway through roasting.

I gave this recipe 3 stars simply because it's a tad too salty and 3 of the 7 ingredients are listed as "optional." Huh?

Unfortunately, I felt this was too salty (although I used 1/2 to 3/4 tsp. of salt) and used way too much oil.  Next time I will use half the amount of oil called for.

Just made this for dinner; the asparagus was very, very salty, they wrinkled up looked wilted and stuck to the pan. Definitely would not recommend this recipe and definitely won't make this again.

Nice and easy way to make asparagus.  I overcooked it a little, but it was still very good.  Will likely make it (hopefully better) again.

Waaaay too much salt. Cut the salt in half at least. Then I think it would be great. Parmesan cheese was good.

Roasting vegetables is the greatest.  I find I will eat and enjoy almost any of them - even ones I didn't like before.  This asparagus recipe is really good - just keep an eye on doneness to your preference.

Delicious! The lemon juice and parmesan cheese give a nice twist on a simple way to prepare asparagus. I added the salt by eye, since some reviewers commented on the recipe being too salty. I also baked them at 400 degrees, since I put them in with some salmon, and found that 12 minutes was just about perfect.

I liked it. Hubs loved it. Nice crunch. Nice flavor without being overpowering. Could have used a little less olive oil. I tossed the asparagus with the olive oil in a plastic bag. Asparagus well coated with some residual oil on bottome of bag. Will definitely make again. Easy with most ingredients on hand in pantry.

Made this recipe as written and it was delicious!!  I mixed the olive oil, lemon juice, salt, pepper and garlic in a small bowl.  Drizzled that over the asparagus, and tossed them all together on a foil lined baking sheet.  Then sprinkled with the parmesan cheese.  This is how I will make my asparagus from now on!!

Delish! The picture doesn't do it justice. This is a beautiful, tasty, easy way to cook asparagus. I left the garlic out, since my husband doesn't like it, and it was still out of this world!!
Served it with Starflower's "Maple Salmon" and the contrast of the savory asparagus with the sweet lemony tang of the salmon was fabulous! This is something I will make again and again!

This is the best asparagus I have ever eaten! I forgot to add the lemon juice because I tasted it right out of the oven and couldn't stop eating it. I ate the entire pan if it. Didn't even share with the family. They had burgers! Thanks a million!

This was a really good recipe. However, I think the Parmesan is absolutely necessary. Next time I will add more. Overall it's a delicious recipe though.

I thought this was very delicious! I accidentally added the lemon before cooking, but it turned out just fine! I ended up adding the lemon juice at the end again and the flavour was really good! I had thicker asparagus so cooked it for about 15-17 minutes.

Put the oil and seasonings in a zip lock bag.  Add the asparagus and let marinate in the fridge for 15 min. to overnight.  Put on a foil lined baking sheet, sprinkle with parmesan and roast.

I was hungry for asparagus but I needed some inspiration and a new way to cook it. Oven roasting worked great. Unfortunately I forgot to add the lemon at the end. Otherwise I made it as listed. Thank you!

All I can say is WOW.  This was a huge hit for Easter dinner.   It was the one thing everyone had seconds of.  Even my 10 year old son who doesnt like any cooked veggies.  Didnt have sea salt or lemon just used table salt and added the garlic

This is a WOW!  The asparagus tips got almost crispy.  I loved this preparation and will use it again and again.  I lined my pan with a sheet of tin foil for super easy clean up.  I will also experiment with the amount of oil.  I'd like to do with a little less.

Loved this recipe. We always tried to grill asparagus and seemed to overcook it each time. Scratched the grill for the oven and this was awesome with the garlic, cheese and salt (we used kosher salt). Asparagus was cooked but still had the right amount of crispness rather than being mushy. Recipe is a keeper!

This asparagus tastes AMAZING! My family loves asparagus, anyway, but this preparation is so sinfully delicious! Take care with the oil and the salt, though, and make sure is right for the size bundle that you have! I was guessing on the amount of asparagus the first time (because we shop at a warehouse store and a bundle is like 3 lbs.) and it was just a touch too salty and a little greasy. Still amazing, though! And that definitely wasn't the last time I made it and I will continue using this recipe frequently!

This asparagus was fresh, crisp and delicious.  I tossed the spears in EVOO, sprinkled with salt, fresh ground pepper and minced garlic-tossed again.  After placing them on a foil lined baking sheet I drizzled with fresh lemon juice and finished with parmesan.  I agree with only leaving them in the oven for appx 8-10 minutes on 400 for thicker spears.

Always tasty, even if just using olive oil and sea salt.  Make sure to watch them carefully so they don't overcook and get mushy.

I just love asparagus and this recipe is really great!  I made it with Garlic mashed red potatoes and the garlic and parmesan in them complimented each other perfectly.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Excellent recipe.  Made as recommended without cheese, but more lemon juice and accidentally more salt.  12 minutes was perfect in my oven.

Delish!

This was way too salty; the salt completely overpowered the flavor of the asparagus. I would try this again, but I would use 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of salt.

When I think of asparagus, I think healthy. I assume healthy means I should steam, which is all I've done with asparagus before.  I haven't really enjoyed it that way.  But the author is right when she says that the natural bitterness is killed when roasting.  I LOVED this recipe!  I will be making asparagus much more often now!  We added mushrooms to the recipe and they were also fabulous.  Thanks so much for posting a healthy recipe that tastes so yummy. :)

Very good. I didnt add lemon or garlic but i would next time. I put a little too much salt but that was my fault. 10 mins in my oven at 425 made them come out perfect.

I have made this recipe a common day to day sidedish, sometimes I even make them just as a snack. I am not a veggie lover and this recipe made me change my mind about asparagus. It was very tasty and simple to make.

Just made these for dinner tonight...only thing I missed was the lemon, but it would have been great I'm sure!  I took them out 4 minutes early because everything else was ready (roasted chicken, mashed potatoes)  Boyfriend dug in before I got to the table and I heard him say "asparagus is good hun"...he was right mmm!  Fantastic, thank you.  Will definitely make this for the christmas dinner I'm hosting this year.

I made this last night with seared sea scallops and garlic angel hair pasta. The only downfall to me was, there was too much olive oil, but that is a super easy fix. Otherwise this turned out awesome and my fiance went nuts! This is super delicious and easy!

Wow! This was awesome! Instead of asparagus, I used fresh green beans. I used about 1/2 tsp garlic salt instead of garlic clove because I felt lazy. Also, I threw in about a 1/4 tsp toasted sesame oil, but I don't think that made much of a difference. I baked them at 425 as suggested but for about 15 mins. We couldn't stop eating them!!

I really like this.  I had roasted asparagus one time with balsamic vinegar and it was gross.  But this was amazing.  I drizzled with EVOO and used only garlic salt and pepper.  10 minutes in a 400 degree oven was PERFECT!!  I like it a little crisp. Update 11/8/2017 I still roast this way but now I don't add anything except the oil to cook and parmesan cheese when done. Even my husband who hated asparagus can now stand to have 4-5 pieces!!

This has great potential, but very salty and oily as written.  Next time I will do 2tbsp oil and no salt.  The cheese offers enough.

It was so good! I added a extra garlic and on time I forgot the pepper, it didn't matter it was good every time! My 4 year old even ask for it for her birthday dinner!

This is delectable! I used about 1/4 teaspoon of table salt and it was slightly more salty than I cared for. My husband said this was the best asparagus he has ever had. We will make this again and again!

Yum! This was delicious. I will use this recipes every time I make asparagus. The only change I made was I only cooked it for 8 or 9 minutes because I like my asparagus slightly crunchy.

This is so good! The asparagus cooks perfectly and the garlic and parmigiana added great flavor. I simply used minced garlic from a jar and kraft sprinkle cheese. I didn't use any lemon juice. The asparagus were laid out on foil on top of a cookie sheet.

This was awesome. I reduced the amount of olive oil by about half and would reduce it even more next time. I didn't have quite enough asparagus, so I added some broccoli as well. Both of them were done to perfection in 12 minutes. I loved the flavor!

I made this following the original ingredient list, plus all the optionals, except I cut the salt in half per other reviews. It was amazing! Very versatile - would go with brunch, lunch, or dinner. I had to bake at 400 F due to another item in the oven but it was still done in about 15 minutes. Hubby and I actually scraped the pan clean, and he asked if I could figure out a way to bottle the sauce - only half-jokingly! It'll be a good addition to the rotation when asparagus is in season.

Lovely recipe. When roasting vegetables the browner the better. Until you get some brownish color you don't know what you are missing!! Because of this I use 450 degree oven. This is great with green beans as well. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Great way to cook asparagus, fresh grated Parmesan should be used, it really works great with the minced garlic and the sweet/bitterness of the asparagus. I drizzled a bit of mornay sauce on mine, and my family went nuts over it. I ended up having to cook mine at 350 because of the veal I was cooking (first time cooking veal, so I wanted to follow the recipe to the t). At 350, I kept it cooking between 30 and 35 minutes and it came out perfect.

Easy to make! Just followed the EXACT recipe. Everyone loved it and ate more than I expected.  I added a few cherry tomatoes per serving "just to add pretty holiday color".  (I would do that again but I would only add the cherry tomatoes in the last few minutes because I am not fond of cooked tomatoes.  The red color made the dish pretty and everyone commented about that.) I just served it in a 9x11 baking dish so it went from over to the table. EASY-EASY-EASY. YES I should have taken a picture!!  sorry

It was good, but way too salty. Would recommend half the salt, or wait until the end to add salt to taste and let the garlic flavor it. I will be doing this next time I make it.

Here's a fun tip for asparagus.

While snapping the asparagus is certainly the fastest and easiest way, you can also use a potato peeler to shave away some of the bottom rather than throwing it all away. The woody part is on the outside, the interior is still soft and delicious.

By peeling the ends rather than breaking them you can get almost double the amount of deliciousness, if you're willing to do a little bit of work

I found this recipe a couple years ago and it's the only one I use now.  I add extra parmesan and sliced mushrooms and everyone loves it!   I will definitely keep making this over and over :)

Very good and accurate cooking time and temp.  If you want to step it up a bit for a nice dinner, wrap 3 or 4 sprigs with pancetta.

Super quick and simple recipe for asparagus. I'm not a fan of asparagus and normally the only way I will eat it is grilled. However, I really liked this!

I’ve made this several times. Sometimes with parmesan cheese sometimes without. Either way this is by far the best way to make asparagus. I like how the parmesan cheese gives a bit of a crunch especially to the tops. It’s not watery like it is when you boil it and the flavour is great. It’s important to coat the asparagus with olive oil and to use a pan large enough for the asparagus to be in a single layer. I also go easy on the sea salt. Just a light sprinkling. I’ve not used the garlic because I think it would be too overpowering but that is just a personal preference. I got some flavoured olive oil and will try that next time.

I didn't seen the point in the cheese and lemon juice it didn't enhance the flavor of the asparagus at all in my opinion. I would rather cook asparagus in oil, butter salt and pepper.

This is very yummy! The changes I made were to place the prepared asparagus on a baking sheet (lines with aluminium foil for easy cleanup) then I brushed it with olive oil.  I then sprinkled the parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper  and sea salt on it.  I baked as per the directions.

My wife had sworn off asparagus since they were always stringy. As I made these, she prepared a side dish of another vegetable for herself. When they were done she tried one and immediately by-passed her side dish and went for a full serving of these delicious asparagus, giving me a big smile and “kudos” for the excellent recipe. Now she’s ready to try them again! This is a great recipe & so easy!

Super good! I just cut down the oil to 1T instead of 3. The asparagus I used was rather thin and some of them burned, so I'll use thicker stems next time. Hubby loved it! Said it's the best I've ever made -- that'll make it a keeper!

This was the best asparagus I have ever eaten, and so unbelievably easy to make.  It tastes like a dish that would be complicated to make but isn't.

Because I dislike parmesan cheese, I used freshly grated Romano and 2 cloves of garlic, and squeezed  fresh lemon over  it  as soon as I pulled it out of the oven.  If this was the way people tasted asparagus for the first time, I can't imagine anyone not loving it.

I can't understand all the reviews. I have had way better.
I did use 1/2 tsp. of salt and had no problem with it being salty  but it just seemed dry or something and some of the asparagus burned. Just didn't like it, threw the leftovers out. Parmesan cheese didn't add a thing to it.

Followed recipe as written. Delicious!!! The last time I made this I had some fresh mushrooms I needed to use and added those at the same time as the asparagus. Everyone loved the change as well. Thank you for an awesome recipe!

Absolutely delicious!  Will definitely be adding this to my regular menu plan.   I did have to pull it out of the oven at 10 minutes, it was already done.  I also didn't add any additional salt, as parmesan cheese is salty enough.

Very tasty!  I agree with the other reviewers that said it was a bit too salty.  I will also not bake it for as long next time.  Still, it was delicious and I will absolutely make it again.

This was the first time I made this. Instead of putting this on a baking sheet I put it in foil wrapped it with all the ingredients and a couple shakes of Parmesan popcorn topping. This rocked!

I love roasted asparagus and the addition of lemon at the end really brightened up the flavors.  There are several problems with this recipe though in my opinion.   Cooking thin asparagus at 425 degrees for 12-15 minutes would result in mushy asparagus.  I cooked mine for 7 minutes and it was a little less than crisp tender.  I probably could have taken it out at 6 minutes.   I also think 1 tsp of salt was a little too much for our taste.  I reduced mine to between 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. and i was plenty for us.

The partisan plus the salt made the recipe too salty.  I recommend reducing or even eliminating the salt.

This was awesome & easy - tasted like it was way more fussy to make.  I will definitely make it many times again , and I also had a thought that some crispy bits of bacon added to it might be a nice variation.   I made it with just  a good sprinkle of salt though and included the garlic & parmesan, and roasted it on parchment paper on a cookie sheet, and then added the lemon juice before eating.

No changes made. I have made asparagus before but it was normally bacon-wrapped. I wanted a simple recipe and found this one. My husband and I loved it so much we made it for the next 3 days lol. Ugh it is so good and I am glad it is so simple. I have a new found love for asparagus now.

I made this as an Easter dinner side dish. I don't care for asparagus at all, but my family does. I tried this and couldn't believe how good it was. It was my favorite thing out of all the other sides I made!!! I liked it so much that I've made it four times since Easter.

This was overpoweringly salty. I would halve or quarter the amount of salt. Also I had thin stalks and think 12-15 was probably too long to cook it. Otherwise, good flavor ... and I agree with others who lined the baking sheet with foil to save clean-up. :-)

I cooked at 350 degrees for 12 minutes, perfect. sometimes I leave the parm cheese and lemon off and only do salt, pepper, and garlic kids love it either way.

I have used this recipe twice now to cook asparagus, and I love it!! I have always sauteed mine in a skillet on the stove, which isn't bad, but baking it like this is so much better! It's tender and full of flavor!! I didn't put cheese on mine because i'm allergic to dairy, but other than that I did like the recipe said!

Who doesn't like quick, easy and delicious.  I heat high for 6-8 minutes personally, but the flavors are simple and great.  Goes perfectly with grilled/baked salmon with some Cajun seasoning and rice.  A nice dinner is ready, from start to plate in 30 minutes!

This is the best recipe! I was shocked when my 22 year old son who is extremely particular with vegetables (he's not crazy about most) had 3 helpings!!! I almost fell back in my chair. I'm planning on making this dish for Easter dinner. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe, it's a keeper!

I love this recipe and make it often.  I do not believe you need the full three tablespoons of olive oil.  I use about a Tablespoon and put it in a gallon ziploc bag.  I add asparagus and toss to evenly coat.  I then take out and put on cookie sheet.  I do think you need all the salt, but it important to see that sea salt is is large flakes and that is what makes up a teaspoon of salt.  You can use regular salt, but need to cut in half.  I make with and without the garlic and everyone loves.  Good low calorie vegetable side.

The only way I'll ever cook asparagus again.  Didn't think I liked asparagus until trying this cooking method.  Not bitter or slimy like steamed or boiled.

There are two ways my husband loves asparagus: wrapped in bacon and this recipe. This recipe is wonderful. I personally would like a bit more flavor so next time I'll be adding some smoked paprika and maybe some tarragon. This would be very good with other vegetables too, perhaps mushrooms or carrots. 
It's also amazing just as is too and super easy to make!

Lovely recipe. You should add all the optional stuff..parmesan, garlic and lemon juice. It makes for a lovely side dish. I only had lime juice the last time I made this and it was lovely too. Thank you for the recipe, Swedishmilk. : )

I tried this tonight, alongside some lettuce wraps.  It was really good. Hubby liked it too, and he usually doesn't care for asparagus.  

Next time, I'll probably cut the salt in half.  Although, the saltiness might have been because I forgot to put the lemon juice on at the end.

So simple and delicious! Why haven't I made this in the oven before? I usually steam, but this worked well tonight since I had potatoes and chicken in the oven. Just reduce the salt - a lot - I used maybe 1/4 tsp (a few twists of pink himalayan salt) and it was plenty as the cheese is salty. A drizzle of balsamic vinegar is fantastic if you don't have lemon juice.

To save dirtying a bowl,  just pile my asparagus on a cookie sheet and drizzle the oil over the top and add salt & pepper. I take two turners and toss the asparagus a bit to evenly coat; then spread them into one layer. Sprinkle on the Parmesan with a handful of almond slivers. Baked 12 minutes is good for us. The cheese gets sort of crusty...yum!

I'm taking off 1 star because my first batch was really, really overcooked. My asparagus is pretty thin but the garlic was also almost burnt so I feel like the temp/time is off (and I even took it out early). For the second batch I cooked it at 400 for 8 minutes and it was a lot better. I didn't measure, just drizzled some oil, used a few turns of my salt and pepper grinders and used a big clove of garlic rough chopped.

This was "OUT OF THIS WORLD" GOOD!  I read some reviews and then I watched the video.  I like watching those!  LOL

I went right by the recipe.  The only thing I did a little different was, I just put all the asparagus in a big zip lock bag and then added the other ingredients (except the lemon juice).  I shook the bag up real good and then baked it.  Since I'm one of those people who like those brown edges and getting something just a little done, I baked this for 20 minutes.  I did stir it around every 10 minutes or so.  The result was a wonderful, light browning of the cheese and the garlic!  IT WAS INCREDIBLE!  After I took it out of the oven, I squirted some lemon juice on it.  I like using a real lemon.  What a wonderful topper, too!  I will definitely be making this again!  It was the BEST asparagus recipe I have ever had, in my life!  I highly recommend this.  I'd give it 10 stars, if I could.  :-) A big thank you, to Swedishmilk, for sharing this recipe.  I see why it has a 5 star rating!!!!

DELICIOUS! !!  Although a bit too salty.  Didn't have sea salt I used regular, and 3/4t & still too much; next time will cut it way back.  Parmesan is salty enough.  I used 1/2t of lemon pepper in place of pepper & lemon juice.  Still this is so good even my kids loved it!  
Will make this again, and even with other veggies like zucchini & squash.

I did not put the cheese on during the roasting and it was much better during the last 2 or 3 minutes.  Maybe my bunch of asparagus was small; I had a pound,  but it was very oily and salty but still took 25 minutes to roast to tender crisp.  The flavor was good, just needs some adjusting.

I followed the recipe as is. I did a double serving and it turned out great. I did sprinkle a little lemon juice on it but did not use any garlic. The boss, my wife, tells me I can make this one again.

Since I found this recipe, it is the only way we cook asparagus. We eliminated the salt altogether, because the original recipe was way, way too salty. We salt it at the table if we like...wonderful recipe!

This is a terrific recipe.  I grill asparagus often and didn't add the parm cheese.  This is a big improvement and much easier.  You might substitute Old Bay for the pepper and get some additional flavors and more garlic is ALWAYS better.  Costco has the biggest spears around.

These were awesome. A great quick way to make asparagus, it really cut the bitter taste. My one recommendation is to use way less salt. I cut the salt in half and it was still to much. Next time I will just sprinkle them lightly with salt.

Delicious! I mixed everything together except the cheese and coated the asparagus. I didn't measure anything just made it how I thought I would like it. I was out of fresh garlic so used garlic powder.  I grated fresh Parmesan cheese on it and roasted for about 10 minutes. So good. Had it with a baked chicken breast.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was an excellent choice.  I did not use the optional lemon juice but didn't think it needed it.  The flavor of the asparagus came through and the crispy bits of the Parmesan cheese were a nice taste addition.  I look forward to having this again soon.  Thank you!

Several other reviewers have mentioned that they thought 12 minutes was too long for the thinner stalks but I hardly ever find those at my local grocery. The thick stalks are perfectly done after 15 minutes. This has become my new favorite method of preparing asparagus.

Good.  My asparagus were thin, took 13-14 minutes until done, so you really have to watch them.  I tossed everything into a zip lock bag (used less than 2 tablespoons of oil & thought that was too much).  Like others I spread the parmesan on top before going into oven.  Will try with lemon next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've never been a huge asparagus fan, always finding it chewy with an odd taste. These were excellent, however. The seasonings were perfect though it could use a little less salt. The freshly grated Parmesan cheese and (fresh squeezed) lemon juice really made these exceptional. I broke them off using the cooks comments of bending and letting them naturally snap and they were not even a tiny bit chewy or stringy. Thank you for a new excellent recipe for me.

This was by far the best Asparagus I have ever had. It was amazing and I couldn't stop eating it. This will be a regular recipe for me. The lemon juice added the perfect finishing flavor. I've just recently started to like asparagus and this will have me coming back time and time again.

I liked this fine, but I thought the asparagus was a little bit bitter.  It was easy to make though which is a  plus. I'll work with it and see if I can figure out how to get it perfect. Maybe it was the the asparagus I bought.

This was delicious!  Made it for Easter 2013.  My asparagus was pretty thick, and I cooked it for 10 - 12 minutes, and it was perfect!  Love the lemon juice on it at the end.  Will be making this again!

Made this for our Easter dinner and it was a huge hit! I used all the "optional" ingredients (parmesan cheese, garlic).  Will make this again for sure!

I only gave it four stars due to the amount of salt.  I used a half teaspoon which was still a bit salty.  Otherwise, this was the best asparagus I have ever cooked and the only way I will use from now on!

Easy and delicious. I used dried minced garlic, soaking it in the bowl with the olive oil for a few minutes. Then rather than drizzling the oil on the asparagus, I tossed the asparagus in the bowl with the oil. I kept an eye on the asparagus and pulled them when the tips began to brown. The lemon juice brightened the flavor. Husband said it was the best he'd ever had.

Well I would've sworn that I didn't like asparagus, right up until yesterday when I tried this recipe! Left out the sea salt (I'm cutting back) and the lemon juice and it was spectacular. Served these up with Chicken Cordon Bleu II and that incredible creamy wine sauce (also from this site). I've got to say that this was the best vegetable side dish I've ever had in my life! Thank you swedishmilk!!!

Simple and fantastic recipe. I like to trim the stalks, then peel the lower half of the stalk with a vegetable peeler to reduce the toughness of the asparagus. I had thicker asparagus from Costco, baked for 8 minutes and it was perfectly cooked -- any longer and they would have been way too done. Don't leave out the lemon juice -- it really brings out the garlic/parmesan flavor. Thanks for a great recipe!

My son, who usually picks on his vegetables, absolutely loved this recipe.  Since I doubled up on the asparagus, I doubled up on all the ingredients, except the salt.  Instead of parmesan, I used a hard greek chesse called mitzithra, which in essence is quite salty.  Even with half the salt, it came out rather salty.  Next time, I'm only going to sprinkle a pinch of salt. :)

Awesome. Roasts perfectly at 400 degrees for 12 minutes. Do not omit garlic or lemon, consider cutting the salt back a bit.

This was great!! I used two garlic cloves as well as fresh lemon juice and it was a huge hit! When I baked it I used the stove top and set the temp at medium and let it cook for about 10 minutes, covered. It still turned out well, but I did add some more freshly grated parmesan at the end. When I make it again I will use the oven.

It was amazing. I used mild cheddar instead of Parmesan and sprinkled it on the top before i put it in the oven... I used everything but lemon juice.

This recipe has made me love asparagus. I include all the "optional" things in the recipe, plus add an extra clove of minced garlic. I will note that the 1 tsp. of salt called for is WAY too much, and I've found that 1/2 tsp is plenty.

Great way to cook asparagus. The thicker asparagus is generally tenderer and better flavored, and I prefer to peel it before cooking- should develop browned patches when done- I use a 500 degree oven.  I would skip the garlic and cheese- the dish doesn't need them, they won't stick well and will burn.

I love roasted asparagus, and I make it all the time, but for Easter I wanted something a little more special. This is a fantastic recipe. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make again. Thank you.

Just ok.  My kids wouldn't eat them and they normally like asparagus.  My husband and I thought they were ok, but way to oily.  If I ever made these again, I would use maybe half the amount of oil.  I followed the recipe exactly minus the lemon juice.

Delicious!!!  Next time I would halve the salt, this dish was quite salty, and I doubled the garlic.  Everything else I did as directed.  I paired this with the "Blender Hollandaise Sauce" on this site and what happened was quite magical!!!

Great recipe. The asparagus was so tender and the parmesian accented its taste very well.  I did not have lemon so i did not try it but im sure that would be good as well.

What a nice recipe for asparagus! I made the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious. I will reduce the amount of sea salt I use next time to aprroximately half a tsp, as I believe the parmesean cheese adds a little salt alreay. 

We eat asparagus quite often, cooked many different ways, but this was great! My husband raved over this preparation. I will definitely make this again.

Yumm!!! I'm so happy to have another delicious way to eat asparagus! I used shredded parmesan and added mozzarella too. And I was very generous. When seasoning I added some cayenne for a little something extra. No need for lemon this time. I'll be making this again.

My absolute favorite Asparagus recipe. If your asparagus is too thick, cut them in half length wise to make them thinner. So easy & wonderful!

I did not toss the asparagus but drizzled with the OO and then sprinkled the other ingredients (no lemon) on the stalks. 350 oven along with some fresh beet and potato wedges. 

The asparagus was crunchy both because of the lower temperature and the Parmesan/garlic crust that was formed. What a treat.

Wow! This was amazing, I will make this recipe as often as possible. I used a lot less salt, 1/2 tsp but I think I will only use 1/4 tsp next time and see how that tastes. I drizzled a little olive oil on the asparagus so probably only used 1 Tbl. I used ALL the optional stuff...not an option to leave them out! Seriously! When the asparagus was ready I ate them on a wrap with just a little mayo and some mixed greens. Soooo good! But I couldn't keep away from it and ate the rest with my fingers. lol You simply have to try this recipe. :)

Excellent recipe. I cooked mine on 425 degrees for 10 min. I used minced garlic in a jar and added a bit of the juice as well. Will definitely make again.

I often roast my asparagus and love it so I really didn't think adding the grated parm. would make much of a difference.....WOW, YUM! (I personally use Colivita Fruittico extra virgin olive oil for this and feel this gives it that extra tang ). Thanks for your recipe...I'll always use the parm now too!

Flavor is really good, but it was tough to find the balance between ensuring the asparagus is cooked enough, to when it starts to get a little stringy.  Use freshly-grated Parmesan for best results, not the dry stuff in the can.

Fabulous. A winner all around the table, and that is not an easy task in my house (without butter too).
Thanks for making the greens tasty.

very simple and tasted amazing! I used thin asparagus so I only cooked for 10 minutes. I used more cheese then it said and it turned out really flavorful. Definitely use all the optional ingredients!

Excellent flavor---made exactly as written, including optional ingredients---and it was absolutely delicious.  My asparagus was very thin and only took about 9 minutes to get done.  I do think I'd only use 1/2 the olive oil next time simply because there was so much left in my bowl after I took the asparagus out.  Hate to waste the good stuff!

Made this as my pot luck item for a Christmas party. Huge hit with everyone. Like others have noted, I cooked them for less time to maintain a little crispness. I also skipped the lemon juice (because I forgot to get some). I've had to give this recipe out to about a dozen people so far.

Yummy! I gave this recipe 5 stars because I don't like asaragus and was agaisnt eating it for the longest time. I tried this this morning and it was AMAZING FOR ASPARAGUS! It's still asaragus but I believe this is the best way to eat it. Modifications: 2 1/2 caps full of veg. oil (no olive oil in home) Sprinkled the parmasean on after i had it on the baking sheet with foil. (not on purpose just midread) and baked for about 12-15 mins. Loved it. Will be a healthy snack for me!

We make it with the canned parmesaan, garlic or garlic powder and olive oil.  I marinate for several hours then stick it on bbq grill or in the oven.  We love it that way.

My family and I aren't usually big fans of asparagus, but this was fantastic! The asparagus didn't taste at all bitter and bleh like it normally does. I actually took seconds!

Absolutely sweet and delicious. I peeled the ends of the asparagus with a potato peeler as to not waste. Cooked about 10 minutes longer, watching them closely. Will use this recipe often, thanks

Very tasty, we used garlic salt instead of fresh and sea salt, as we did not have any on hand, we normally grill the asparagus, but with winter approaching this is a welcomed change.

This was wonderful. We made it exactly as written except for substituting some regular salt for sea salt (we didn't have any on hand) as a side dish for chicken cordon bleu, and it was a hit with everyone! Thank you!

This was amazing! I used to only eat canned asparagus but now I will be having this. This is seriously one of the best recipes I've had in a while! Soooo easy. Soooo good. It's especially great that all these things are usually on hand. My boyfriend loved it too. I am going to try wit other vegetables.

really good, I used all ingrediants and wouldn't do it any other way. Even my little 3yo whom hates all veggies and won't eat them, ate them! I also lined my pan with foil which always makes clean up so easy. Husband, wish I'd made more than I had, and is having me make them again with dinner again. Keeper!

Loved this. Such an easy way to prepare asparagus! I followed the advice of another reviewer and lined my pan with tinfoil for easier cleanup.  I also skipped the step of mixing everything in a separate bowl.  I just sprayed the tinfoil-lined pan with cooking spray, spread out the asparagus on the pan, drizzled it with olive oil, sea salt (to taste... definitely did not use a whole teaspoon), cracked black pepper and parmesan cheese.  I tossed it together until it was well-coated right on the pan, then spread them out into a single layer.  I had really thin spears (my favorite!) and they were done in about 8 minutes at 425 in my oven.  I skipped the garlic and lemon juice this time (just plain ol forgot) but will definitely use them next time!

Although leary about trying new recipes when company is coming for dinner this one seemed perfect with the roast chicken I was making.  I am glad I made it, company raved about it.  I used frozen asparagus spears because I couldn't find fresh at the local store and really didnt have time to shop around.  Even my children liked it.  I will definately make this again.  Thank you for offering this recipe.

I forgot to add the lemon juice before serving so I can't give it five stars, just because I don't know. What we ate was delicious and always a favorite for me - EASY. I'll definitely make it again.

Simple and very tasty. Did not add the garlic but did add the fresh squeezed lemon at the end for freshness. Sea salt and cracked pepper a must. We love asparagus. Great veggie with our ham.

My mom made hers like this and my kids loved it.  She left it in longer under the broiler to get a crispier texture to them.  It really added another dimension to the flavor.

Absolutely delicious! I couldn't stop eating them. I used herb infused olive oil, and pre-roasted minced garlic. I did have to cook it a little longer, since the asparagus was on the thick side. I totally missed the lemon juice option, guess I'll try it next time. Going out today to buy more asparagus. :)

These were excellent. I didn't really measure the seasoning, I just sprinkled it well. I used garlic powder instead of the clove. Thank you for the recipe. Definately a keeper!

"Delicious" "Gourmet" -- This is my husband's review since I hate asparagus!!  He loved it made this way.  I have to admit that making it this way didn't make me like asparagus but I was willing to eat a few spears and it wasn't horrible. LOL!!

Fantastic recipe!  The only thing I changed was to use  half a teaspoon of salt and half a teaspoon of Mrs. Dash in order to cut the sodium down more.  Next time, I will not use so much Olive Oil, it really didn't need that much.

Awesome!  Didn't have the correct ingredients so I improvised.  I do that a lot.  I got my inspiration from the recipe and it was GREAT.  Much better than just boiling it which is my usual way...never again.

My family loved these! the garlic made all the difference... I used minced ( almost pureed but not) garlic so it created like a sticky feel to the asparagus and that really seasoned every bite. I left out the lemon juice as I didn't care for it.

This is a super way to serve asparagus.  I followed the recipe except I used lemon infused olive oil instead of olive oil and lemon zest.  It was excellent!

Definitely a keeper.  both my husband and I ate our serving first before. Excellent taste.  I did use shredded Asaigo instead of parmesan cheese and forgot to add the lemon juice.

Left out the cheese & lemon juice and it was still fantastic if a bit too salty. My asparagus was a little old so the snap-stalk trick (which is awesome) probably resulted in more waste which may explain the oversalting. Still had to stop myself from eating it all at once. Can't wait to make again!

I like how simple this recipe is. It doesn't take a lot of time. I used a lot more parmesan cheese, which made the asparagus slightly crispy and good. I tried it at room temperature, but it may taste better right out of the oven.

Well...this was my first pie ever and it was delicious. For the chicken I had some left over from Thanksgiving so it was already seasoned. I cooked the veggies by themselves and made my own poultry seasoning (since many of the reviews I read people had added some type of additional seasoning) as follows.  1/2 teaspoon of each dry oregano,  ginger powder,  thyme,  sage and rosemary.

Only change is the cooking time.  I found it took much longer to cook (45 min in my oven).  I will make again though.

Gee wiz this is good!  We've NEVER been fans of this veggie, but oh yea of little faith.  This recipe had me making a second batch since my 13yr old and I devoured the entire first pan.  The only change?  I mixed Romano cheese with the Parmesan cheese.  Grazi! Grazi! Grazi!

First time making asparagus and enjoyed it! Made it as a test run for Thanksgiving and it was a success. However, next time I will not add as much salt.

I used grated Parmesan since that’s all I had, but it came out amazing! It was so tender and juicy. The lemon really adds to the dish. Can’t wait to make it again!

I made this almost according to the recipe. I put the fresh parmesan on the asparagus once it was on the baking sheet. I HIGHLY recommend using the lemon. Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly.  Excellent recipe as written.  make sure and get the thinner asparagus they just taste better.
next time I'll add a little crushed red pepper (pzza pepper) because we like a little heat.

thanks for the recipe

I got some asparagus that turned out to be quite bitter, so I came here looking for something to take away the bitterness - this works!  I had some shredded Parmesan on hand, so I added the cheese on top instead of mixing it with the salt & pepper.

I lined the baking pan with foil; the asparagus stuck to it a little (possibly because I used shredded instead of the drier, grated form). Next time I'll use No Stick foil.

I like my asparagus very young and slender; 12 minutes was a bit too long. Next time I'll start checking it at 8 minutes.

Made it almost exactly; my parmesan was shaved and my salt was kosher. My pepper was white, because my husband gets kidney stones and black pepper is one of the no-nos. It was so good, there wasn't a fleck of green left in the serving dish. I would make this over and over. And it is so easy! Thank you for this fabulous recipe!

I've always made mine this way.  My husband " thought" he hated asparagus, but he really loves this.   He never had it this way before.  I don't measure anything, sooo.   As far as the garlic goes I cheat and use the garlic in the jar already minced so I use less oil

Simple. Easy. Pretty fast. Easy cleanup. (I put it in aluminum foil.) I’ve made this a few times and it’s great! I didn’t find it too salty, but I think that’s because I sprinkled it on, and not all of it stuck. I don’t remember the parmesan cheese even being on the list—did they change the recipe? Either way, it’s optional, and I obviously “opted” out.

This was delicious!  I did make a few changes: I used canola oil instead of olive oil and baked at 375 F to avoid smoking. I used 3 cloves of minced garlic, and eyeballed the salt and pepper. I mixed the salt, pepper, garlic, lemon, and oil in a bowl then tossed the asparagus to coat evenly. I only baked for about 10-12 minutes until the spears were soft. This side was fantastic! Will definitely be making again!

I've made this several times. It's a great side dish that goes with just about everything. I toss the asparagus in a zipper bag, to cut down on dishes.

This was the first time I tried making asparagus and it was delicious. I sprinkled a little salt so it wouldn’t be salty and used grape seed oil instead. Will be making more real soon.

Followed the recipe but didn’t have lemon juice and instead added a bit of lime juice and grated lime peel and that lime peel in this dish made a huge delicious splash!

Good, but not as tender. Will use less oil next time. Too oily. Could be I didn't cook asparagus as soon as I bought it. Microwave it makes it more tender.

It’s the best asparagus you’ll ever eat. I used fresh grated Parmesan, lemon juice, garlic, and added red chili flakes for some spice and it was the best vegetable I’ve ever tasted. I just eyeballed all the ingredients and it turned out perfect. Go light on the salt to start since the Parmesan is salty too.

DO NOT use iodized or table  salt!! People commenting this recipe is salty must be using one of those instead of KOSHER salt, and they would produce the saltiness they’re complaining of. I have been making my asparagus like this (minus the lemon juice I now add) since my family became so large and it became impractical to pan sauté as I have for years. Also, if your spears are of the slimmer variety, you’ll need to reduce cooking time 4-5 minutes. Happy eating.

I realized that I didn't have garlic on hand, but made it anyway.  I put extra parmesan and lemon.  I will certainly make it again, but I'll try it with the garlic next time.

I used parchment in the pan and served it with the Hellman's parmesan chicken breast recipe.  They cook at the same temperature for close to the same time.  All of it was bang on.

No pepper, lemon juice or garlic. Used lemon pepper instead. Real good! Doesnt need the parmesan cheese, but nice touch if you want it.

Used grapeseed oil instead and really could have used less.
Garlic powder sprinkled worked
worked well and no lemon.  Next time, I'd use parchment paper or spray with a nonstick spray.

For the last 30 years, my husband has done most of the cooking in our family. He has made asparagus many different ways. Today I made this for him and he said that it was the best asparagus he's ever had. That means a lot, coming from a master chef like him.
We both especially liked the little bit of crunch that you get from the parmesan. Truly delicious!

I loved this!  Really tasty and wonderful!  My daughter who doesn't like asparagus even took extra.  I would make a few changes next time, though...I'd use half the oil and salt.  It was just too oily and salty!  Otherwise it was really good!

Loved it. Did not use the optional ingredients. Did not use the olive oil but used cooking spray. Just eye-balled the spices and used a little more garlic powder and less salt because of dietary restrictions. Also, used the aluminum foil to speed on cleanup. Baking time will vary due to size of asparagus. My husband said it was "awesome".  Thank you for a great recipe. Will probably only use this recipe for asparagus.

Very good!! Just a great short cut / I put all the ingredients in a large (gallon) size Ziplock bag. then add washed & trimmed asparagus into the lZiplock bag and seal and just roll / shake and it coats the asparagus so much more evenly. And no mess! I just sprinkle the parmesan cheese after its on the baking sheet, prior to going into the oven.. I’ve also just sprinkled the cheese after it’s cooked  it sprinkled on after. All personal preference I suppose.

Didn't have grated Parmesan so I used the shaved Parmesan we had. Very good!

Very much different than my usual asparagus side (steamed or baked) used freshly ground parmesan Romano and the lemon gave it a perfect balance love it, and will have it often.

I will definitely make this again!! My husband and son LOVED it. I halved the salt, as suggested, and sprinkled the parmesan last, also as suggested. FABULOUS!

It was amazing.  I think I tried this recipe before with my own modifications  and it was blah.  This time I did the recipe as written.  It was nearly perfection.  A classy recipe that you would find at a really nice restaurant.  I used butter (that's not much of a modification - is it?!), included the parmesean and the fresh lemon juice.  I will try it without the optionals next time and see how that is also.  I paired it w/brown sugar/soy basted salmon; and jasmine rice.  Just a perfect combo.

I love asparagus and decided to try something other than steaming.  I left off the parmesan cheese and garlic and just did olive oil and veg seasoning.  Awesome

This is an easy side dish to prepare. The whole family loved this dish.
A word of caution.  If you're using parmesan  cheese cut the salt amount by half.

It was excellent. I do agree with another reviewer that 8 - 10 minutes at 400 degrees is enough. It keeps the asparagus crispy. It is good with or without the lemon juice. Will definitely  make again.

These were a hit!
I made this as a side dish for my Passover Seder.
I didn't use Parmesan cheese and I roasted them at 450 degrees for about 15 minutes. They came out so tasty.
Thank you!

Best asparagus I've ever had! It's seriously hard to believe it's healthy. I do prefer this without the cheese and the lemon, though.

You can do the same thing with many other vegetables, though you may have to adjust some things (carrots for example, take longer to cook because of how hard they are).  I pick 2-4 different vegetables, cook them in 2-3 large pans, and I have plenty of vegetables for the next few days.

This recipe was very easy to make and was so good. My daughter wanted the recipe to make for her husband and she rarely cooks. The only change I made was to add a little more Parmesan cheese than recipe said. Definitely will make again.

This was so good.  We loved it with shrimp and a baked potato for the Hubby.

As good as it was, it would have been better, if I had realized the oven was on convection and watched them closer.  Husband still gave them two thumbs up!

This was so good! My mom and my future in-laws came over for dinner last night, and they loooved the asparagus. I didn't use the Parmesan or garlic this time, just oil, salt, pepper & paprika, and a little lemon juice; but the cook time was spot on and we ate all 2 bunches of asparagus! :o

Yup, it's definitely too salty as it is, but if you half or quarter the amount of salt it's absolutely delicious. They turn out so tender and juicy. You can use just two tablespoons of olive oil too and it turns out just as good.

I love this asparagus paired with salmon. Even my 4 year old can't get enough! I don't measure any of the ingredients-- just use enough olive oil to lightly coat and season with salt and pepper to taste. Then I sprinkle generously with shredded parmesan cheese, I don't use the optional garlic or lemon. I usually bake it at 400*F for 15 minutes, which is the temp and time my baked salmon calls for.

Loved the recipe, BUT.....if you have a meyer lemon or lemon tree,they are the best.I used a microplane grater for the garlic which melted basically into the olive oil. Sea salt has more flavor and grate the cheese also on the microplane grater it will melt into the asparagus. I'm making these tonight and cut them up into a salad along with grilled salmon  on top.Have my special dressing I make and that has marinated for 2 days.

This has become a staple in our family! I would suggest finding stalks that are all similar in thickness so that they all cook evenly and you don't end up with some stalks burnt, shriveled, and looking like tooth floss! Lol! Other than that, you really can't go wrong with how much of the seasoning suggests. Add or lessen according to your taste!

I've made this two nights in a row. So simple and so good! I used Avocado oil and Lime juice instead of lemon (it's not as tart). A spoonful of garlic (no such thing as too much) and cook for 11 minutes. So good!

What I Did:  
I didn't really measure, though amounts of oil and cheese were pretty close to that listed.  I didn't add lemon juice, and used powdered garlic instead of fresh.  

I lightly sprinkled garlic, a few pinches of kosher salt, and generous coarse ground pepper over the oiled spears, then mixed again with the cheese.

Since today's spears were the smallest I've ever bought, I took them out at 10 minutes. 

My Comments on This Recipe:
Thank you for posting this. It helped me in a pinch (I just didn't want plain steamed nor bacon-wrapped again)!  

This was a good solid recipe, that I will use again, likely increasing the cheese next time and adding it last as recommended by other reviewers.

I made the recipe as is and it was delicious. My nine-year-old even ate it and went back to eat the leftovers the next day. I coated the asparagus with the Parmesan cheese in other ingredients in a gallon size Ziploc bag because it’s easier for me. I will definitely be making this one again.

I had very thin asparagus spears. They were stringy until I put them back in the oven and cooked until crisp.  This I'll try again with thicker spears, but will also make them crispy to snack on.

I love this recipe but modified it. I put the aparagus in a bag of olive oil to coat, then transfer to another bag with the dry ingredients. Then I wrap several in a slice of bacon and put on a grill pan in the oven. I serve with baked salmon filets over cauliflower rice.

As suggested by others, I didn't add any salt. I used 1 tsp of black pepper, 1/4 tsp of garlic powder, lemon juice and tossed all of it together and let it sit for an hour. Sprinkled 2 tbsp. of cheese over the asparagus and roasted it for 10 minutes. They came out very good. We will make them again in rotation with other recipes for asparagus.

Pretty good as written. The only change I made was using garlic powder instead of chopped garlic for better coverage.  I also lowered the temperature to 400 degrees.  Otherwise, it's all good.

This is so good, so easy and my teenagers and husband love it. I use whatever asparagus is available and have to roast longer for the thicker ones, however after making them so often I can eye them to see if they are done. Smells so good and a very forgiving recipe

B/c we are trying to be low on dairy, I used very little Parmesan cheese and used garlic powder instead of garlic, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  Delicious!  (I served it with thin  chicken breasts sauteed in olive oil and butter and fettuccine in lemon caper sauce.)  My teenagers loved it.

Simple, easy, perfect. Lemon works great drizzled over vegetables with asiago  (parmesan,  etc). A lot of Greek side dishes use them together.  I frequently  make sauteed  spinach (w/olive oil and garlic), sprinkled w/asiago and lemon.  But you can omit the cheese, but definitely  keep the lemon.

It wasn't as crisp as I expected.  We enjoyed asparagus this way nonetheless.  I'll use this method again soon.

I have made this recipe many times! I always use freshly shredded parmesan cheese. Once you try good parmesan cheese, it's hard to go back to grated can cheese! If you use fresh shredded cheese though, it does work out better if you sprinkle it over the top after you bake it, otherwise most of it ends up in the baking dish. So yummy!

The cooking method on this is my favorite way to make asparagus. My 9 yo loves helping. We didn't care for the lemon or cheese. I only sometimes add the garlic. I decreased the oil to about 1 T and just sprinkle a little salt on it. It's really the cooking method I'm rating I guess... but I highly suggest you try it! We just roll the asparagus around on the pan in a little oil.

I've made roasted asparagus before but was looking for something a little different.  This recipe added garlic and that is what I was missing!  My asparagus was a bit on the thin size so I only cooked it for about 10 minutes.  It was so good that I ate most of it before I thought to take a picture.  I will make again and include a picture next time.

Yummy! I changed it a little bit. I used 1 pound asparagus,  3 Tablespoons of olive oil, I used 2 minced garlic cloves,  3 Tablespoons  of Parmesan cheese and the juice of one lemon
salt and pepper to taste. It was sooooo good!

Made this in a toaster oven, turned out amazingly and it's a great way to cook asparagus if you don't like it mushy (pull it out a minute or two early and you're good).

Really enjoyed this asparagus recipe. It’s simple and easy to prepare. I didn’t use any lemon juice and only about 1/2 tsp of salt. Everyone enjoyed this recipe.

This was a really good recipe!  Since I was cooking a Baked Pork Chops recipe from this site at 350 degrees, I put them in the oven with the chops and let them cook for 20 minutes.  I took them out and let them sit on the counter until my pork dish had 15 minutes left to go.  The asparagus turned out perfect!  You don't have to go high heat if you've got other things going on in the oven!

This was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. I gave it 4 stars because the cook time was a bit too long. My asparagus was very soft. I like it with a little crunch. Next time I will lower the temp to 400 and cook for about 7 minutes.

No changes needed! Awesome as is. I’ve been making this for sometime now, just never got around to posting a review. I like it when the tips get a little crisp... great flavor.

I added candied bacon. I cannot recommend this recipe enough, whether you choose to add it or not. The bacon is a great addition, though.

I can't tell you how ridiculously simple this 5 star dish is to make. I didn't make many changes except that break my asparagus close to the top so that there is very little tough stem to deal with.

Also, I nix the fresh garlic for garlic salt and omit the sea salt. I combine 2 steps in 1 and it turns out great! I use fresh ground pepper from my pepper mill and omit the lemon juice. It simply doesn't need it.

You won't find a better recipe out there. This one is the ONE to use always!

This is a very tasty was to cook asparagus.  Followed the advice of others and with thin strips, I cooked at 400* for about 8-9 minutes and that was enough.

I enjoyed the simplicity of the recipe so much! It was tasty and very flavorful, but slightly too salty for my taste. That might have been my bad though, I didn't use a full bunch, so I should have cut back a little more than I did. Overall very satisfied with this recipe!

I used all the optional ingredients besides lemon, and it was amazing! My family ate all of it VERY fast.  I will definitely be making this as a side dish more often. Side note, a lot of people in the reviews say its too salty, but I dont think it is. I'd only cut it down a 1/4 of a tsp if you want less salt.

I made these for my husband as a side to go with salmon, and he absolutely loved them. He ate probably 25 spears of the asparagus! They're very nicely flavored. My suggestion is to put them in the oven for 15 minutes (not 12), so they're a little bit crispier. Super yummy and super easy! It also doesn't take very long to throw together.

I've made this many times and it never fails. The only thing I notice is if I get a bunch of asparagus that is thin, I will cook on the smaller end of timing. It's perfect each time. I'll make this every time.

It turned out very good, to salty for my taste so I made it again with less salt. Baked up nicely.

I used Kosher salt instead of sea salt and I didn’t use parmesan cheese. I tossed it all up in a gallon Ziploc. It was delicious but salty-  but that was my fault. Ooops.

This recipe is wonderful and SO VERSATILE!! Made it a few times using different vegetables. Basically, you can use it on any veggie that you can oven roast. I’ve used it not only on asparagus but, zucchini, yellow squash, grape tomatoes and mushrooms. It’s definitely a keeper!

If my mom had made asparagus this tasty when I was little, I probably would have eaten way more vegetables. I really love this simple, yet flavorful recipe.

These were so good! If I made them again, I would definitely mince 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1 as well as well as add less salt at the beginning and add the rest of the salt at the end.

was really good. I don't use a lot of salt when cooking, so it was a bit salty so I will cut back on the amount of salt used.  Other than that it was great.

My husband LOVED it! (and so did I, for that matter!)

It is very spicy (not hot spicy, just full of spice flavor),  but I didn't use as much asparagus as I suspect I was supposed to because I had to cut a lot of my stems off because they were woody.  However, it was still very, very, very delicious!

I served it with iron skillet fried hamburgers and corn on the cob.  Yummmmmmy! I will definitely make this again (and again and again....)!

The family loved, loved, loved  the roasted asparagus spears with minced garlic, olive olive oil, salt, pepper  and the parmesan  cheese; it  was delicious.  Certain members of the family don't care for garlic so I minced it especially fine and the roasting at 420 degrees for  20 to 5 minutes was perfect; I mixed the spears 1/2 way though.  We'll add this dish to our rotation.

I added some bacon prices and shredded cheddar jack cheese. I sprinkled the cheese first then the bacon so the bacon stayed on top of the cheese as it melted and didn’t slide off of the asparagus.

The photo is not of 'thin' asparagus. Good thing; thin asparagus are the 'male' of this bisexual plant species and are tougher if not picked fresh and prone to desiccate if overcooked. Thick female stalks will retain their superior tenderness even if they are not cut fresh and are more forgiving with regard to overcooking. I substituted melted butter for the olive oil and made sure the pan was coated nicely with a basting brush. I added a few slices of Vidalia on top of the asparagus. I removed a roast to rest from an oven at 300 F and put in the two pans of asparagus raising the temperature to 425 F. I checked through the oven glass at 12 minutes and opened the oven at 15 minutes to test their doneness, added 3 more minutes. I drizzled the juice a whole lemon over two bunches in two pans and let it sizzle with the butter. Perfection. No parmesan needed.

This is an amazingly tasty recipe for asparagus.  When asparagus is in season and inexpensive, I make this a couple of times a week.  I do a couple of things different:  Instead of adding the parmesan in the mixing bowl, I sprinkle it on top just before going in the oven.  I also use a roasting rack covered in foil.  I don't ever add the lemon juice... and I adjust the bake time to match the temperature of whatever else I've got in the oven.

Also, one of my favorite restaurants has an asparagus dish that is topped with a fried egg.  I highly recommend trying that with this recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I didnt have olive oil so I used margarine butter and I didnt use lemon juice because I believe it tastes yummy without it. I now fix my asparagus like this every time I have it on hand. So good!

This was my first time making or roasting asparagus so I followed the recipe in terms of the heat at 425 degrees.  I think it was too hot, and ended up taking it out much sooner, maybe 8 minutes after it was in the oven.  I would recommend lower heat setting or else watch the asparagus very carefully.  Mine was starting to smoke so I turned the oven off right away and let it cook/cool on its own outside the oven.  Otherwise, a good recipe.  I used everything but the parmesan.  It was yummy.

I mix everything except the cheese together and roll the asparagus in it and then drizzle what's left over the asparagus. I add the cheese after cooking or sometimes a few minutes before it's done so it won't burn.

The only change I made was that I froze the Asparagus. As tasty as it was the Asparagus had a lot of water which made it mushy instead of crispy. I would make it again but not to freeze it

It may have just been the asparagus I had, not very firm, but this was delicious! Definitely will make it again and again.
My son is a vegitarian so his will be perfect for him.

Second time I’ve made this recipe. Simple and turns out great every time.  I changed it up a bit and substituted different infused olive oils to pair with the main dish!

I have made this about 3 times and every time I do it is a hit!

The only difference I make is instead of using fresh garlic I used the minced garlic that comes in oil.  I'm a garlic lover so I usually add more than what is called for.  I also have a bottle that spritz oil and it makes it easy to put on the olive oil.

I've had to print multiple copies of this for friends!

Delicious!! I made this for Easter and it was a big hit.  Based on the reviews I cut back on the olive oil and was glad I did. I also cut back on salt. Remember the parmesan will be salty.  I mixed the oil with the seasonings, but not the parmesan. I put the asparagus in a ziploc bag and then poured in the oil mixture in the bag. I rolled the asparagus around until it was evenly spread. I sprinkled  parmesan on one batch, but forgot to use it on the other,  so I just added it on after taking it out of the oven. Great recipe. Will be making many times in the future.

Made it exactly like the recipe says, then cooked on Convection Roast at 400 F. The time was unaltered and the taste was fantastic. This is my new go to recipe for asparagus! Wonderful.

4 3 18 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/214931/oven-roasted-asparagus/ ... Well, this sure was easy & good!  Too salty, but I kinda deserve that for following the recipe.  Haha.  'Seemed too much at reading.   I didn't add the parmesan, but did add the lemon juice.  A bit too lemony for me, but not for most, I'm sure.    While I'm not much for cheese & vegetables, I think I'd like the parmesan with this; at least give it a shot.  :)

I cut the salt in half! And that was on the edge of too salty for my taste. Had I put a full teaspoon of salt I wouldn’t have been able to eat it.

This is a great recipe.  I read the other comments and cut the salt to 1/2 tsp and oil to 2T.  First taste was rather salty and then remembered the lemon juice.  Once I squeezed some on, it was perfect, the salty taste disappeared and it was one of the best asparagus dishes I've ever made!

Husband loves it made it a number of times.  He's not really a vegetable person but has asked for this! Followed recipe, came out great! If I don't have fresh garlic, I use garlic salt and just salt them when they come out of the oven.

Made the recipe as written. Loved it. It could be too salty for some, but using less salt wouldn't take away from the flavor.

What a great recipe! The one thing I did that others  had mentioned was the amount of salt. Even with the amount cut in half I felt it was still on the salty side. I plan on making it again tonight with 1/4 of the recommended amount.

This is an easy and delicious recipe for asparagus.  My 4 year old (who is very picky) even approved and ate the (small) helping I served her.  This is how I will serve asparagus from now on!  I did not add as much salt as the recipe called for.

My first roasted vegetable and it was delicious. Please use all the optional stuff - garlic, lemon juice, etc. Just follow the recipe. I may never serve steamed asparagus again!

I tossed with EVOO and used a teaspoon or so of garlic from a jar of minced instead of fresh. I splashed a dash of white wine over the pan before putting it into the oven. I did not add lemon juice after cooking. The flavors combined tangy and rich and the end result  was AMAZING, though it felt like twas missing "something." I paired with from-scratch Chicken Marsala. The only thing I would add next time is some lightly-toasted almond slices for a perfect 5 star rating.

DELICIOUS!!!!!I usually sauté my asparagus, this method is a lot better. I did a vegan version (no cheese), added garlic sea salt, and a tad bit of paprika. It was great. I also added some colored bell pepper slices. I loved how it cooked evenly and was super tender. I will never sauté again.

This is the ONLY way to make fresh asparagus. You can do it in the oven or on the grill the same way. We have a gas grill with a temperature reader on the outside, so basically the same way. Our favorite recipe for our favorite vegetable!!!

Delicious!  This is my third time preparing this dish; however, I had to simplify because I hate washing greasy dishes.  After washing and drying well the asparagus.  I laid them out on parchment on a cooking tray, sprayed them with some cooking spray, lightly sprinkled some salt and pepper (no measuring) due to the salt in the cheese, then sprinkled with triple the cheese (about 1/3 cup).  Because I'm not a fan of crisp-tender vegetables, I baked for 15 minutes, lightly covered with some foil on top, and baked another 8 minutes.  Came out perfect for my taste and clean-up was a snap.

Really great. I used half a teaspoon of garlic salt instead of regular salt. ( I ran out of garlic). It was really good but a little too salty for me. I usually don’t cook with salt so next time I’ll cut it in half.

Roasted asparagus is amazing. The cheese and garlic give just the right flavoring. However, next time I will decrease the salt and use less oil. One tablespoon of oil and 1/2 tsp. salt would be an improvement.

I was skeptical but it turned out perfectly! I love asparagus but can never get it the right texture, I was able to with this recipe! I ran out of olive oil (only had just over a tbsp) and it was still great. I used all of the optional ingredients with the exception of Parmesan (I will try with next time, I just had some hollandaise to use up)

Oven or Grill Roasting Veggies is nothing but great taste added to any meal! Adding the fresh zest of squeezed lemon is an added change to my beloved appetite for asparagus!

I made recipe as written,  made the appropriate sub of garlic powder for the clove per my garlic powder bottle.  Used a fresh lemon wedge for the lemon at the end. I used fairly thin asparagus and 12 minutes made it tender like we like.  Easy and fast, will make again.  Very yummy!

I really liked the flavor, but I forgot to adjust for a higher altitude and even though I cooked at the least time specified, some of the asparagus were a little overdone. I'll try again adjusting the time to a lower amount, because the flavor was GOOD!

Quick, delicious, & a great way to eat vegetables for the family.  I used a flat square plate instead of a mixing bowl to coat the asparagus with the oil and the other ingredients. I did not use the garlic. I will definitely use this recipe again. My husband complained because I didn't make enough.  I don't often get complaints about not having  enough vegetables.

I made this as a side to Chef John's Stuffed Sole and loved the crunch of the garlic and parmesan on the asparagus in contrast to the fish. I actually liked it better than the fish. As a side noted, I did not have fresh cheese and used powdered parmesan, and I would do it again.

I've made this around a dozen times because it has become our favorite asparagus recipe. I hate to dirty a bowl so I lay the trimmed asparagus on a foil lined cookie sheet, drizzle a little oil across and then toss them around a bit on the pan. Then I spread them out in a single layer and sprinkle with salt, pepper and a heaping teaspoon of minced garlic. I use a micro-plainer to finely shred parmesan cheese before putting them in the oven to bake at 375 for 10-15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the asparagus. Sometimes I drizzle a little lemon juice when they come out of the oven, but sometimes I forget... either way, it turns out delicious.

Excellent and easy recipe.  The asparagus spears that I got were quite thick, and 15 min was a bit too much.  13 or 14 would have been perfect.  Very easy, very good, highly recommended.

I have made this several times following the recipe exactly for a 5-star rating.  This past Thanksgiving I had some cauliflower I needed to use so I tossed it with the asparagus and the other ingredients.  Cooked perfectly and was a nice addition to our Thanksgiving dinner.

Nice basic recipe. I used an herb infused olive oil for some extra flavor.   I like the crunch and it is less stringy than steamed or boiled asparagus

I basically put all the ingredients with the asparagus in a zip lock bag and made my own shake and bake to coat evenly. I let them sit for 5-10 minutes to soak up the flavor before baking. These were gone in minutes. So delicious and easy. I love recipes that make veggies so incredibly good

I found allrecipes.com while searching for easy/tasty asparagus recipes, as I tend not to like asparagus.  This recipe is easy and so delicious!  I've made it twice since I found it, and made it just as written. Looking forward to trying other recipes on this site!

Phenomenal asparagus! I loved it. I wouldn't make any changes unless you just want more, less, or different seasonings.  I will be making my asparagus this way every time!

Asparagus is something that my husband and I enjoy very much.   Not so much our daughters, until I made this.   Again, based completely on the recipe without any changes, it was a hit.  The girls ate the asparagus which I made along with Chef John's Greek Lemon Chicken and potatoes.  There was just enough left over for my husband to take to work.   Only one of the girls did say the asparagus was a bit salty, nobody else felt that way so it could just be her own personal level of salt taste.  I recommend this one for anyone who wants their kids to eat more healthy fresh green veggies.

I will never make asparagus any other way! This is a family favorite- and that includes three picky little girls. I have discovered that my family prefers it at 350 degrees for 10-12 minutes. Don’t forget to line your baking sheet with foil for easy cleanup.

It was delicious! I'm not a vegetable lover, and have been exploring palatable vegetable dishes - and this worked for me! I used a little less oil and kept it in the oven a bit longer to make the asparagus soft. The Parmesan and a hint of lemon made this dish very flavorful and enjoyable to eat.

I LOVE THIS ASPARAGUS!! To save dishes, i drizzled the olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic (powder instead of minced) onto the asparagus already on the cookie sheet then spread them back out again. so quick and easy and so good next to just about anything!!

Made this as is and EVERYONE loved it.  I've never had asparagus before.  My son (20yrs old) came home and mentioned he had some and really liked it.  I looked up a recipe and decided to try this one.  You should have heard my husband complaining and insisting he does not like asparagus and he was NOT going to try this recipe!  I made it anyway, insisted that he try it (i mean 20 years of marriage and IVE never seen him try it) well.....HE LOVED IT!!!  My son loved it, I loved it, my 80yr old father loved it!

I used the super thin asparagus, followed directions to the T but mine turned out a little tough and woody but I will say the flavor was spot on and will try again, could have just been the batch I got.

Lemon, garlic, salt and pepper are so good on roasted veggies.  I admit.  I ate the whole bunch of asparagus in one evening.

This recipe was fantastic But I did change 2 things. I didn't add any salt because the Parmesan cheese is salty enough. I also used a lot less oil, I would say maybe 1 tablespoon would be enough.

 I didn't want to dirty a bowl and a pan so I mixed and baked the veggies in the glass baking dish.  I didn't measure anything either. I sprayed some Pam on the baking dish,  added the asparagus, the pepper and the minced garlic. I lightly drizzled the oil then gave it a good mix to coat everything! You don't need the extra  oil pooled at the bottom of the dish!

It was so easy roasting them in the oven, I definitely will make it this way from now on. I set the oven to 425F and my timer to 10 minutes, 12 minutes tops! We like a little bite to our asparagus also, as it sits for a couple minutes they still cook through a little more. Just before serving squeeze a touch of fresh lemon over the dish. 

My usual way to cook asparagus is in a skillet and I use the same ingredients. It's just as good but I have to watch and stir it more. That's why roasting is so much better. I'm sure if it's too hot outside, you would probably elect to cook them on the stovetop. Grilling them with these ingredients tastes fabulous too!

If you haven't had oven roasted asparagus, you have to give it a try. I know you'll get hooked too! By the way, I ended up eating all of them. It was the best dinner I've had in a long time! Lol
If you don't care for the ingredients suggested on the recipe, at least the te

Very good. Used 2 tbsp oil & that was great. Used garlic powder, the pepper stated in recipe, a pinch of salt& right after getting out of the oven sprinkled it w/freshly grated Parmesan.

I love this recipe! I make this often and always add the optional ingredients, especially the garlic! I make this in my toaster oven on a flat pan lined with parchment paper for easy cleanup. Like others, I adjust the cook time based on the stalk size and do not cook as long as we prefer ours firm. I do not add salt while cooking, remember the cheese is salty too. Great recipe!

Very tasty.  I topped it with long thin slices of red onion before I put it in the oven.  At 1.5 hours it came out perfect.  Excellent recipe. I served it with roasted asparagus with garlic and Parmesan cheese and red potato salad with Dijon mustard and buttered garlic bread!

I was rushed and didn't remember the parm cheese, but I'll try next time. I've tried asparagus several ways, including sautéing.  This is by far the best I've ever made.  Tender and tasty.  Between my 11 year old and myself, we ate an entire pound. He usually eats on piece.  Not this time!

I left out the Parmesan cheese and used two garlic cloves. I also cooked the asparagus at 400 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. I found this to be some of the best asparagus I have ever eaten. I will be using the oven-roasted recipe from now on. I like it better than pan-cooked.

Family favorite. Sometimes it's too salty, other times it isn't, even though I make it the same for all.  Seems to matter what you pair it with (with beef - salty, with fish - not so much, etc) and using the fresh squeezed lemon while cooking (not just putting on at the end) helps a lot. The acid really tames it.

tasted great, but I found that 10 mins at 425 was a bit too long, at least for thin spears.  I will try 8 mins next time.  Otherwise, no complaints.

I make this frequently.  A delicious and easy vegetable dish.  The family loves it.  I do tend to use less salt and more cheese.

Very tasty.. I only used a fourth of a teaspoon of salt, I thought it was fine but a guest commented that it was a tad on the salty side. I skipped the cheese and the lemon (Actually I forgot about the lemon :-))  and added extra garlic (Because I'm a huge garlic fan!)

Made a big pan of this tonight and everyone loved it... my toddler had thirds! Followed recipe pretty much as written, except I always just eyeball amounts for this type of dish vs. measuring ;) Slight modifications  made based on other reviews: Sprinkled on Parmesan AFTER tossing the asparagus with the oil, S&P, and garlic and baked for  only 8 minutes as my asparagus was quite thin. Will definitely make again!

Easy and delicious. I prefer thicker stalks for this recipe, but if using thin ones, reduce the cooking time by several minutes. Unless you enjoy very salty foods, you may want to reduce the amount of salt by as much as half. I use the optional ingredients, except for the lemon juice. If you don't have any grated parmesan, it will still be fine, but by all means, add the garlic. Don't forget to line the pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper to make cleanup a cinch.

This was delicious except....much too salty.   Cut the salt in half (at least) and you've got a winner. (Depending on your oven, you may wish to decrease cooking time a bit as well to retain some bite.)

This was pretty good. If you like crunchy asparagus though its not for you. I didn't put any lemon on it and I sprinkled the parmesean on it before I stuck it in the oven.

I would give this 10 stars if I could. OMFG, roasted asparagus is LIFE ALTERING!!!! You could even skip the Parmesan and pepper and still have the most delicious side dish at the potluck. I made 10 spears to go with my duck breast dinner tonight....ended up making 20 more for desert, haha!

Followed the cook's footnote to bend/snap the asparagus & we didn't have any bitter bites. I mixed everything together, except the cheese & let it marinate in the fridge until I was ready to cook it. I accidentally added the lemon juice before cooking, we didn't think it caused a problem with the taste. And, I forgot to add the cheese but it was still very good. Will make again as my asparagus hating husband like this.

Great recipe! This was my first time preparing asparagus and wow did this recipe not disappoint! It was super easy and very delicious, I kept sampling and sampling and decided to stop before serving so I could serve at least a few asparagus. I followed the recipe exactly except the 12 minutes. So after reading the reviews I baked mine for about 9 minutes and it was perfect. Just the right amount of crunch and tenderness. I am going to start eating asparagus from now on!

Loved it!!!! I didn't  have fresh garlic on hand so I used garlic powder and it worked fine.  So happy I found this recipe I've already used it twice and the second time I used it with fresh green beans.

This is incredible!  I snapped off the woody ends and then cut  in about 2 inch pieces, sliced an onion and put in the bowl with asparagus as I was seasoning with garlic, salt, pepper, oil and Parmesan cheese. This makes you want to never boil vegetables again, it's quicker and just plain tastier than boiling or cooking on top of the stove. It also helps preserve the vitamins in the veggie.  I will definitely make again. My husband said to make sure I put this on the keeper list.

The only change I made was to add some Italian herbs and cooked it in a 9x13 glass pan. Otherwise I followed the recipe as is. Yummy!!

Made it twice, and enjoyed it each time! Make sure you mix the  OO , S&P,  fresh ground parmesan cheese and mince your garlic finely in a bowl. Pour over the Asparagus. Get it all coated well and lay it flat on a baking sheet. You might even add additional Parm for a bit more flavor and texture.. I cook it 13 minutes and sprinkle with lemon juice if desired.  Perfect!

My children automatically protest eating anything unfamiliar. Asparagus had not even been presented before it was being balked at. The word itself is not terribly appetizing, admittedly. However, honoring our usual agreement, after the first child braved it and raved, the others soon fell in line. Now all three picky eaters claim asparagus as their favorite vegetable. I agree with the shorter cook time for extra crunch. Also, I recommend that you soak it in cold water for a really crisp and fresh finished product. I skip the lemon juice and use balsamic vinaigrette instead. I've also skipped both with great results. Go for it with this recipe, it's a definite show stopper!

I made this with 2 bunches of Asparagus. Roasted as directed. These were thinner, so time was about 7 -8 min. Came out perfect. I did not use the cheese. Used Olive oil, salt and lemon pepper. My granddaughter said "I guess my taste buds are changing.... I like asparagus now!!!!"  That is a compliment. Thank you for the recipe!

Absolutely delish!!! I didn't feel like pulling out my Cuisinart grill. I looked for an oven recipe and this was the first I found. I followed the recipe -- except I had no sea salt so used kosher salt and I made a mistake and added lemon juice in with the oil vs. after the asparagus was cooked. However, it still turned out delish! I also like mine a little crunchy so I cooked 8-10 mins. Simple but delicious recipe. I highly recommend it.

This is a quick, easy green for dinner.  I have topped it with salt/pepper, garlic salt and occasionally parmesan.  Each is delicious.  Just over do it with seasoning.  A little goes a long way.

This is a great recipe for roasted asparagus, but a little too salty for me. I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp. And for all those of you who reduced the temperature to 350, that is called baked asparagus. Bleh. A true roasting temperature is 400 degrees or more, which caramelizes the asparagus. Try it again at the correct temperature. It will be much better!

This was AMAAAAAAAZING! I've only made asparagus once or twice, and so glad I found this recipe!  I only had canola oil and used that, and used 1/2 the salt called for, and omitted the lemon juice. Cooked for 15 minutes and it was soooo good. The only bad part is, is that I want more but it's gone! This is a keeper and I'd give it a million stars if I could! Thank you so much for the recipe!

So so so good! I omitted the lemon juice (didn't have any on hand) and the Parmesan, and oh man, was it tasty. It was more tender than any I've made before, and I kid you not, I left home for a meeting after dinner, came back, and thought about having some dessert while relaxing, but decided to have the rest of the asparagus instead! Weird. The tip about bending the asparagus until it snaps was key, I think, for knowing how to get rid of the woody part. I think I also cooked it for slightly less time than called for. Just waited until it was fragrant.

This is my new  go to recipe for asparagus. So quick and easy. I prepared everything and left it on the sheet tray for my husband to put in her oven. Even he couldn't mess it up.....and he usually does. Thanks for the quick and easy recipe. Other recipes I've used never cooked them to the right doneness either to soft or under done.

Tasty! I added the zest of a lemon during cooking. I also just drizzled a small amount of olive oil.. Maybe 1 tablespoon.. No need for too much. Served mine with some eggs.

I used frozen asparagus, and over baked it.  I  did like the flavor even though it was way overdone    I intend to try again with fresh asparagus.

Everyone raved about it at Christmas dinner. I inadvertently added the lemon juice in with the olive oil but I don't know that it made any difference.  Best asparagus dish I've ever had.

Yummy!  I was thinking the roasting might blacken the asparagus pieces slightly, but either I left them in for too long, or they were too close together and steamed too much.  Either way, they ended up limp rather than crunchy after about 15 minutes and one stir.  Next time, aim for 12 minutes, as I think they would have been perfect then (peeking in the oven door at that time, they were bright green).  For blackening, try grilled!

Absolutely the best I have ever had. I used garlic infused oil, which I made, instead of fresh garlic for dietary reasons. I will make this again and again and am sharing the recipe with my loved ones.

I followed instructions exactly as written.  Successful on 2 fronts, first I grew my own asparagus and second used this recipe and both were very successful.  I don't understand why cooks rate a recipe after they have altered the original recipe, try the original, rate it and then change it up a little and re-submit with changes.

As I've been pushing myself to retry certain vegetables, asparagus was one of them. Truthfully, I've not had a whole lot of exposure to them, but after trying this recipe they are now a constant in our household. I've also tried this recipe with Brussels sprouts (another that I've been "retrying") and it's a hit as well. I bake them in a dish in the oven at 425 for 17-20 minutes.

Followed advice of some reviewers and mixed everything together except cheese. Sprinkled cheese on before putting it in oven. I reduced salt to 1/2 tsp but still too salty for me (used coarse sea salt). Next time will use even less salt. I roasted 1 lb fresh asparagus. I also used 1/2 tbsp lime juice because I did not have lemon. Tasted delicious and will definitely fix it again.

This is my favorite dish...and I sometimes make it with fresh green beans if asparagus is too pricey.  The only change I make is that I omit the lemon juice as I do not see a need for the added flavor.  The parmesan cheese really makes this dish special.

I'm not a big asparagus fan, but this is the best way to prepare it. I usually grill it in foil, but this is easier to work with and tastes better.

I am not naturally a fan of asparagus but made this way it tasted like candy. This was also extremely easy and quick to make. This is the first asparagus dish to make it into my vegetable side rotation, my boyfriend loved it!

Was very good, but do not bake for more than 12 min., my asparagus stalks were young and I should have baked for only 10 min. They were a little over cooked, but tasty. Will make this again.

This was so good that even my husband, who's not an asparagus fan, asked for more!  The only changes I made were to lightly sprinkle salt on the vegetable (it was more than enough), and to add the parmesan once the spears were on the roasting pan. Definitely a keeper!

Good as is - only change I made was using grated ramano instead of parmigiano. That's a great cheese to use too. Also you gotta double the recipe cause everyone loves them!

First time I made this I thought it was to salty, because Parmesan is a salty tasting cheese. So I reduced the salt amount.

Made it just as the recipe said.  My picky 11 year old boy who likes nothing but cheeseburgers, pizza, tacos, and ice cream said, "This is the best asparagus I've ever had!"  The recommendations don't come higher than that.

My whole family loved this recipe! Someone recommended using half the salt which I tried and loved, but I've also made it with the called for amount of salt and it was great too! Highly recommend.

mmmmm... just thinking about this recipe makes my mouth water! I never used to like asparagus until I tried this recipe. My entire family gobbles it up! We never have leftovers! 

Tip: If you have very thin asparagus, take it out WAY SOONER than 12 minutes, . unless you want it super mushyEven for thick asparagus, I take mine out at about 8-9 minutes. We also add a lot more garlic... so yummy.

This  is  a  keeper!  I  used  himalayan pink salt, and  a  lesser  amount. The  asparagus I  had  was  very  small in diameter, so I  set  the  timer  for  15 minutes,  but  checked  it  at  12 minutes. It  came  out  slightly crispy, Just  like  I  like  it. I always  line  the  cookie  sheet  with aluminum foil for  easy clean  up. Sometimes, I  add  bacon bits  for  a  little more  flavor. (Just  be  sure to  adjust  the salt accordingly. This  is an easy, tasty way  to  prepare  this  lovely vegetable.

I never liked asparagus until this recipe.  Now, when I make it I have to double it because all my kids love it!     We have salt-a-holics and salt-sensitive people in our house.  As with most of my cooking, I skip adding the salt and let them do it at the table.

FABULOUS RECIPE!!!

This was delicious!  My only experience with asparagus has been canned asparagus and I was not inclined to eat  to them again.  I will make these oven roasted asparagus again. I didn't use Parmesan cheese or lemon juice.  Next time, I will lessen the cooking time. I cooked them for 12 minutes and the tips were charred.

Great and easy. The asparagus I bought was thin, so the 12 minutes was perfect timing. I used 1/4 to 1/2 of the salt after reading the other reviews-- and I was glad I did. It was plenty salty!

Loved it! Didn't add the garlic or lemon juice just because I didn't feel like it, and it was delicious. I'd be glad to add them another time, but it's good without them, too.

This recipe was great! I cooked mine for around 10 minutes in my oven. I didn't use any Parmesan, but I did include the other ingredients. I used a little more than 1 tbsp of fresh lemon juice, which made it a bit too lemony. I think that if I had used the right amount, it would have had the perfect tang. The texture was also very nice - not too stringy.

This recipe minus the lemon and Parmesan is how I normally make asparagus.  Adding those two ingredients significantly improved the taste and response from my wife.  I do double the pepper and garlic and cut the salt in half.

This was the first time I ever baked asparagus.  Following this recipe was very simple to do.  I didn't have Parmesan cheese so I just left that out.  I added extra garlic though because I love it.  Also, my baking time was about 5 minutes because my asparagus was pretty thin.  They turned out simply delicious!    Wonderful recipe!

Just made this for the first time tonight. 
This is a great dish to make for beginner's like myself. 

I agree with other commenters on here that there is way too much salt. I followed the recipe (though I forgot the lemon - next time!) and the salt was the dominant flavor by far. Fortunately we could still taste the other flavors and it's easy to tell that with less salt, this is a great recipe.  So, as others said - use about 1/3 or even 1/4 of the salt in the recipe and you should be fine. I'll definitely be making this again :).

I made it as directed.  I had to leave the asparagus in the oven longer to soften it up.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't as amazing as some of the reviews made it out to be.

I really liked this recipe  I found it was a little too much olive oil and would reduce it a bit next time. Definitely a keeper!

Quick, easy and yummy. Love the health factor, and how soft-to-the-bite yet still firm the asparagus turns out. 

NOTE- imo this recipe calls for too much salt. The first time I made this, ruined it for me. Use just enough salt to **lightly sprinkle.

I usually pan sear asparagus using these same ingredients plus sliced almonds but since I needed two pounds for a pot luck dinner I tried the oven roasting.  It turned out quite good, however,  it was very difficult to determine the correct amount of cooking time to reach the al dente stage.

super easy and delicious.  I didn't use all the salt, added a little melted butter with the garlic, lemon juice and olive oil and poured it over the asparagus on the pan.  Then I sprinkled the salt pepper and cheese on top and roasted.  I didn't measure the cheese just put it on until it looked good.

I loved the recepie, but used garlic powder instead of real garlic because that was all I had.  Also the tip at the end of the recepie is real.  I love salt and I used a lot less than what the recepie called for and it still came out salty.  But otherwise, enjoy!

My husband LOVES this! I don't eat asparagus so I'm going by his opinion that it's perfect. I did not add salt as parm cheese is salty enough otherwise I made it exactly as written and it was a huge hit.

I usually toss asparagus in olive oil, balsamic, and some spices then grill.  Or sometimes I steam.  But I really liked the way these turned out.  Be conservative on the time and keep an eye on them to get them just right and not overdone.

I think that, if you use Parmesan cheese, you should reduce salt because Parmesan is salty.  Otherwise, 1 tsp salt is fine.

Absolutely delicious. Completely took away the bitterness and the perfect amount of salty goodness. My new "go-to" for asparagus. Even my picky, hubby loved it.

So healthy and delicious and yet so simple to prepare!  Simplified it even more by skipping the mixing bowl step and just drizzled the olive oil & sprinkled the other ingredients directly over the asparagus arranged in a single layer on the foil-lined baking sheet.

Awesome and easy to make.  I used kosher salt, pepper and tons of minced garlic.  Ate the whole bunch by myself.  It was like eating candy! Onolicious! (Hawaiian slang meaning it was delish)

Everyone is right when they say cut the amount of salt by at least half if not more for this recipe. Very very salty. I love salty food so I didn't heed the warning but it was even to salty for me to eat. You honestly only need to sprinkle a dash of salt and pepper into the mixture. Other wise very good side dish and I can't wait to give it another try.

It was great! I made it two times; the second time was substantially better. The second time, I made sure to not overcook it (12 min max), not to overuse the oil, and to cut off the hard parts of the stalks. I omitted the parmesan cheese on both occasions because I didn't have it.

I have seen this done on tv cooking shows, but still didn't think we would love it as much as we did!  When The Kid steps up and says "That was really good," we have a winner!!  As someone suggested in an earlier review, I spread the asparagus on a sheet tray, mixed the oil, etc. in a bowl and poured it  over the asparagus and rolled it around to coat.  A new favorite vegetable in our house.  Thank you so much.

I did not use the lemon. Baked it at 400 for 20 minutes. Did not measure the salt, pepper or cheese - just spinkled it in. Used Garlic powder instead of a clove.

Mixed olive oil, garlic powder, salt & pepper - poured in a ziplock bag. Added the asparagus and shook. Placed in a baking pan and sprinkled with Parmesan Cheese

I just made this for Easter. I had three bundles of asparagus so I tripled the ingredients. Totally awesome. All of my guests raved about this dish. I wouldn't change a thing! Use all ingredients mentioned ~ you won't be sorry. Totally delicious!

This dish is very good, but I agree with the person who said 1 teaspoon of salt is too much. I used 3/4 teaspoon per bunch of asparagus and that was still too much. I actually doubled the recipe, so with 6 TBSP olive oil and all those spices there were quite a few drippings in the bottom of the pan. So, I boiled 5 potatoes and mashed them up and mixed in the asparagus drippings along with some milk (I actually used cashew milk). Both the mashed potatoes and asparagus were delicious.

Great recipe!  I added some shredded Emmental cheese, more minced garlic and garlic-infused olive oil (cuz I love my asparagus that way!)  Would omit some or all of the salt next time though, as the cheese added enough saltiness for my taste.  Was delicious and easy though!  Thanks for the recipe!

I put my asparagus back in the oven after the initial 15 minutes; it was a little underdone at that point, but perfect with another 5 minutes.  We loved the flavor, and loved that it was tender-crisp.

I always make asparagus this way minus the parm cheese. I was out today so didn't get to try it. Next time!
I also like to place my asparagus in a plastic  feezer bag and put sea salt, fresh pepper, garlic and olive oil inside. I then close and shake around. Gets everything nicely coated without another dish. Pour onto your lined cookie sheet and simply toss the bag in the trash. Easy!

I tried this recipe for the first time and it worked well.  To make your life easier and one less dish to clean up... line your baking sheet with foil, lay down the asparagus and drizzle with olive oil Roll the spears in the oil and straighten out into a nice row.  Now sprinkle on the garlic, salt, pepper and lastly the Parmesan cheese and bake.  So simple and so tasty.

I've been making a similar version for years.  To save time I lay the asparagus on a tin foil lined cookie sheet, lightly spray (or drizzle) olive oil over asparagus, sprinkle with salt&pepper then shave Parmesan over the top and bake.  Oh some yummy and easy clean up too!

This is the best asparagus dish I have ever tasted.  I added three times more parmesan cheese though.  You definitely don’t want to skip the lemon juice.  Love this!!!

I always use garlic and it adds so much flavor but add a teaspoon of sugar.

Very tasty, healthy and easy to make. I'd cut down on the roasting time next time but that is a matter of oven temperatures and preferences.

This is now my new favorite way to fix asparagus. I needed to make 2lbs because my 2 teenagers and husband all love asparagus. I doubled the garlic and added a little more evoo, and shredded fresh Parmesan cheese to mix in and put on top as well (probably totaled 1/4 c). Was so busy I forgot the lemon juice (will try next time) but everyone LOVED this recipe! Thank you for the simple, but very delicious dish!!!

I make this all the time!  I've even made it on the grill, on tin foil. It's fabulous!  I have to chuckle at the description which states that the roasting  takes away the bitter taste of the asparagus.  Because this is the ONLY way I've ever made asparagus, I never knew asparagus could be bitter tasting!  I usually follow the recipe exactly although I've made it on vacation and forgot the cheese or I've occasionally left out lemon and it still tasted great but it really is best with the Parmesan!  It's  great. My family loves it and my one Daughter is VERY picky about, especially vegetables and how they are cooked.  Honestly,  have never made it with the garlic but willing to try.

No changes except eyeballs ingredients rather than measure and, due to not paying attention, squeezed fresh lemon over spears BEFORE roasting.  No matter - could not have been better. I ate the entire 1.05 lb. Standing in kitchen.  Headed to store for more asparagus.
Wanted to update.  Tried cooking this again but this time added lemon juice before SERVING as recipe indicated.  Delicious, but frankly, I liked it better when I added the lemon before cooking.  Today the lemon juice was a bit overpowering.  Either way it's still a 5 star in my book.

I ate almost all of the asparagus myself!  It's delicious.  The only difference I will try next time is using only 2 TBS of the olive oil; 3 just seemed a little too much.  Other than that, though, it's an outstanding recipe!

I usually don't pay attention to reviews.  Most posts change the recipe and don't like it.  I did not change anything however  I made 2 batches.  The original is a five star! Way to go!

Having spent years where asparagus grows in the ditches, instead of cutting the ends off, hold the butt end and snap it. A lot of the woody bitter stuff is gone. 

If your spouse likes mushy vegies, par broil for 3 minutes before popping it in the oven.  Want to kick it up?  A pinch of cracked chilies.

Made this as a snack today!! I eyeballed all the measurements and the asparagus turned out incredibly delicious!! I only cooked the asparagus for 8 mins in a 400 degree oven, as other reviewers suggested, and they turned out PERFECT! Will definitely be making this again.

Excellent results from this recipe. I make it often.
In a pinch I substitute a good quality garlic salt.
Tip for quick and easy clean up, instead of mixing the ingredients in a bowl ,use a gallon size zip lock bag . This makes it easier to distribute the olive oil and seasonings evenly, empty the contents on to a foil lined baking sheet and discard the baggie, no bowl to wash!

This was so simple & very delicious.  I used Romano in place of the parmesan, it has a stronger flavor. Next time I will definitely cut the oil in half. Hubby loved it.

This was excellent. I didn't measure anything, just tossed it all together and it turned out exceptional. Other than grilling this is the best way to cook asparagus.

I like the tips on breaking the woody ends off and hot baking.  When I make this item, I'll use _80%_ less salt, spray the oil on from the olive oil can, and probably use even more garlic.  Baked, garlic gets very mellow, so I use more.  I wish I had some in the fridge to make it right now.

My step daughter showed me how to make this a couple of Christmases' ago, I loved it. Your recipe reminded me of it.
I mashed then minced the garlic and added to the oil then just brushed it on the asparagus.   I always just salt and pepper to taste so mine was  just fine.  Think I'll make it tonight!

I make this recipe all the time. My entire family loves it. My daughters ask for asparagus for dinner frequently now.  I just lay the asparagus in a baking dish, drizzle some olive oil over and toss it a little, then I add a spoonful or two of minced garlic and grind some sea salt and pepper over it. Toss again and cover with grated  parmesan. After the first few times I made it I quit bothering with measuring anything!  My family says the more cheese the better. I usually forget to put the lemon juice on, but we like it just as well either way. This goes great with anything on the grill too. We never used to eat asparagus and now it's requested frequently .

This is an awesome recipe but I tweak it a bit and wrap a piece of thick smoked un-cooked bacon around the stalk and coat with melted butter and garlic powder.

If you are serving this with grilled meat (salmon?) just roll these spears onto the grill for a few minutes. They are fabulous.

This was amazing, my husband who doesn't like vegetables even said it was delicious and all three kids couldn't get enough.  I will make this again and again.  I only gave it 4 stars because it really doesn't taste like asparagus at all, and I love asparagus!

I never cared for asparagus before I tried this recipe. I've made this probably a dozen times, and my family keeps being me to make it again and again. I have a very picky 7 y/o, and toss dish gets high marks - even from him! 

I always chop about 2 cloves of my own fresh garlic, and use the recipe for everything else. Always a winner...

Very flavorful, but way too salty as is. Easy and fast. This is my version of the recipe:

Ingredients
-1 bunch thin asparagus spears, trimmed
-3 tablespoons olive oil (or just cover them with olive oil cooking spray)
-1 & 1/2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese 
-1/8 tsp garlic powder 
-1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
-1/2  tablespoon lemon juice 

Directions
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F. Wash the asparagus then pat them dry with a towel, cover them in olive oil, and then place them in a large ziplock bag. In a small bowl, combine the parmesan, garlic powder and pepper. Sprinkle the mixture into the bag, then sprinkle the lemon juice in the bag as well. Shake the bag until the asparagus is coated evenly. Arrange the asparagus onto a cookie sheet in a single layer (put tin foil on the cookie sheet first for easy clean up). 
Bake in the preheated oven until just tender, 8-10 minutes depending on thickness. 8 minutes for thinner asparagus.

I have made this several times, on the grill and also in the oven.  This is a big hit with the family. I didn't mix in a bowl, I put the asparagus in a shallow pan and drizzle olive oil and all the other ingredients. I also used sea salt, I think it taste better then regular salt. I made this with salmon... YUMMM

Great recipe!  Like others, I added foil to the sheet for easier clean-up.  We like it with a lot more garlic, and we leave it in longer to get really crispy.  This is so good already, I haven't been brave enough to try the lemon, but will have to sometime in the future.  Thanks.

washed & trimmed the asparagus and then put them back in the produce bag. Added other ingredients and shook them all up. Dumped it out on foil lined baking sheet. Next time will use parchment because it got sticky.

I used lemon pepper spice because I didn't have fresh lemon juice, used my own homemade Cajun spice, and sea salt, was perfect and my boyfriend who didn't like asparagus, loves it. Will make it again and often

this turned out pretty good for being so simplistic.. i used all optional ingredients and think it could have been great even without the parm.. only made a couple of changes.. used 1/3 the olive oil and 1/4 the salt (kosher).. i think i'd like mozz more on this as it melts better.. maybe next time.. ty for the recipe

We made this without the lemon juice and only a teaspoon of Parmesan and we did not put any salt or garlic. So instead we put garlic salt on them.

Awesome recipe.  My changes are mainly in the prep although I did not use sea salt (none on hand) and cut the amount of salt down to 1/2 tsp.  I mixed everything except the parmesan cheese in a shallow dish and let the asperagus steep in the mixture while the oven preheated and then once placed on the baking pan I sprinkled generously with the parmesan!  Absolutely delicious.

This is a great recipe! Easy to prepare and bakes on a foil-lined pan for easy clean up. The asparagus is tender and flavorful. Be sure to use fresh, healthy stalks.

Yep! I made this for my mom and dad and we all really enjoyed it! I did not have minced garlic at home like I thought,  so instead of running back to the store I substituted it with garlic salt instead. It was soooo good,  better than 2 thumbs up!

Excellent recipe. I will make it again. I will make a couple changes to the recipe next time though. I used the full tsp. of salt and it was way too salty. I'll use half that next time. I will also cut the amount of olive oil in half. No need for that much oil to coat the spears. Also, I'll reduce the cooking time to about 10 minutes. The ends of the spears were a little too crispy. I did double the minced garlic because I love that extra flavor.

Easy and delicious. Although it was a little too salty. Baked at 375 with medium sized spears and turned out great. Will use half the salt next time.

Was looking for an easy and quick recipe for roasted asparagus and found this one. I used all the optional ingredients except for salt and lemon juice. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

This asparagus is delicious!  The first time I made it, I used the recommended amount of salt and found it to be too salty.  I've since stopped adding the salt all together as, for my taste, the parmesan cheese does provide enough flavor.  Also, I've added a squeeze of lemon both before baking and after--the first time I misread directions and squeezed the lemon juice prior to baking by mistake. The asparagus is just as delicious either way.

I've only made this once but OMG! This recipe is the best I've found for asparagus. It paired very well with my baked tilapia. I will definitely continue to use this recipe. It's my new go to!

I'd give this 10 stars if I could. I love asparagus and this is the only way I make it from now on. I've made this many times and tried both the Kraft Parmesan (in a can) and a high quality, freshly grated parmesan. Trust me, it makes a BIG difference in the flavor if you use the good stuff!!! LOVE this recipe!

Best asparagus I've ever eaten. I made two batches. The first  was too salty so I cut the salt back by half. The second batch was incredible. The garlic and lemon juice made for a decadent side dish to serve with any meal.

My family claims to not like asparagus but i talked them into trying this recipe and they wanted seconds of it. This is so delicious. I went with half the salt due to others comments and it STILL was very salty. Really be careful on the salt. I will try it again with 1/8th the amount of salt. 
Thanks for the recipe. Must Have Side!

Delicious!  I was asked to bring asparagus to Thanksgiving dinner and this was perfect :)  I made twice the recipe and didn't  really measure anything and came out great..I forgot to do the lemon at the end, but I don't know that it mattered!  Thank you for the recipe, will make again for sure  :)

Made mine with garlic and it was super tasty.  The asparagus was just right-not too mushy or crunchy and had a nice smoky flavor.  Next time I will use a little less salt.

So good!  This is the only way I'll be making asparagus from now on. I didn't add the lemon juice or pepper.  The parmesian cheese and garlic were the perfect additions to make this really tastey.  Even my 1.5 year old begged for more!

Very yummy, very easy. It took longer to cook than the recipe said, but I think that is because I used glassware instead of cooking sheet. this was my first time cooking asparagus And it turned out really well!

This was excellent and my kids wanted seconds!!! The recipe says the lemon is optional but I wouldn't make it without it, it added a fantastic flavor! We did extra garlic but otherwise kept it the same. Absolutely delicious and will be doing this one again!

I added a little balsamic vinegar to the bowl when tossing the asparagus and it came out incredibly. I was baking something else at the same time that had to be on 375 for 20 min and it worked perfectly! will be adding this to my recipe box!

This was very good!  I made it per recipe but cut down on the salt. I do think that there was way too much oil for the amount of asparagus. You really only need enough to moisten it so the seasonings stick. It would have been a little crisper, I think, if there had been less oil. Thanks for the recipe, though. I enjoyed the flavors, and so simple!

Wow, who knew asparagus and parmesan cheese pared so well??  This was so delicious!  My attempts at roasting asparagus before turned out pretty bad as I didn't know the trick of snapping off the inedible end of the stalk as suggested by this recipe (the stalk naturally snaps off where the more dense and fibrous part is that is not edible.) I steamed my asparagus for about 3 minutes or so first as my stalks were pretty thick. Did not use the lemon juice. Turned out great and would make again!  Thank you!

I make the basic recipe of this but I don't use pencil-thin asparagus, and I use Kosher not sea salt.  The Kosher salt provides a zing of saltiness in places rather than an allover salt bath.  I will try it with the lemon and cheese, although the four-ingredient(olive oil, salt, pepper, asparagus) dish with more substantial asparagus spears and Kosher (not sea) salt is heaven as is.

I liked this recipe very much but the next time I make it I won't use as much sea salt as the recipe calls for.  It was way to salty for me.  Also I cooked it for 12 mins. and it was still pretty hard.  So I put a piece of foil over it and cooked it for 5 more minutes.  My husband has a hard time with anything that needs to be chewed a lot.

Love this recipe. I prefer the thick asparagus spears and this recipe worked great on that size as well. I have made these in the oven and on the grill with good success.

absolutely loved it. Had almost a bunch of asparagus so I reduced some of the salt and pepper. I added the garlic and it gave the asparagus a nice savory taste. I didn't add the lemon bc it was just one more step. Cooked it for 15 minutes in an electric oven.

I prepared as recipe indicates using all optional ingredients too.  Very easy.  I think I would prefer without the garlic and lemon, it seemed to overpower the asparagus.  Next time I will try with just salt and pepper

I followed others suggestions and used Pam spray in place of oil. I baked at 425 for only 8 minutes and it was perfect.  I really enjoyed the crispness of the asparagus.

I make this recipe exactly as written but leave the lemon juice as a side addition for those family members who like it and for those who don't. It's so hard to find vegetables that my kids want to eat but this is a commonly requested. Simple, easy and quick to make! Thank you swedishmilk! You helped to make my life easier!

It was delicious. Because we were already cooking chicken in the over to begin with at 350 degrees, we placed the asparagus in at the same time for the last 20 minutes and it worked great. We did reduce the salt to about 1/4-1/3 tsp.

I love this recipe! I use olive oil, minced garlic, pepper, sea salt, and lemon juice and it is amazing! Put everything into a large freezer bag and shake well. then line a cookie sheet with nonstick aluminum foil and bake. Easy to make, delicious, healthy, and easy to clean up!

This dish was very, very good. I tossed everything together except garlic and parmesan, placed it on the cookie sheet, then topped it with the garlic and parmesan. Baked 10 minutes, was nice and crisp still.We had it two nights in a row, we enjoyed it that much.

I really like this recipe, although I did refer to other reviewers and cooked it only for 9 minutes or so. Also I didn't have fresh garlic so I used the already minced garlic that I generally keep on hand. Came out wonderfully! Definitely a keeper!

I was making frozen beer battered cod fillets and frozen sweet potato curly fries in the oven.  I had fresh asparagus in the fridge too so I made this too.  I stirred the asparagus in the olive oil and 1 tsp refrigerated jarred minced garlic and some salt and pepper.  I generously sprinkled Parmesan cheese on top.  I skipped the lemon juice.  I was able to cook everything in the 425 degree oven together.

Perfectly done in 12 minutes using all ingredients called for except salt.  However, I really like the flavor of asparagus and found the parm and garlic masked this.  I'll keep the technique but serve with a little lemon aioli in the future.

Very good! This is a nice change to how I normally make asparagus. I did spray aluminum foil and line my pan. I tossed the asparagus in everything except parmesan. My stalks were pretty thin, so I roasted them at 400 for 5 minutes, tossed them, then in for another 5 minutes. I then turned the oven off and sprinkled the parmesan on and let them sit in the oven for a few minutes. Awesome!

Delicious but too salty. I would make this again with less olive oil, less salt and no parmesan cheese. My oven started smoking after 10 minutes. Lining the baking pan with foil made clean up easier.

Just cooked this following the recipe exactly and it was perfect. Roasted at 400F for 13 min and it was cooked and a little crunchy, just as it should. For easy clean up, toss in a ziplock bag and line the baking sheet with foil.

I mixed it up and cooked it in a casserole dish at 350 since I had other items in the oven. it still turned out great. The only thing I would change is to hold off on sprinkling the cheese on until almost at the end. Will definitely make again.

So glad I listened to other reviewers and halved the salt it was perfect. I didn't have any fresh garlic so just used 1/8 of a teaspoon of powdered.  Did layer the asparagus on pan before I sprinkled the fresh parmesan on top. Absolutely delicious, this will be my go to asparagus recipe.

I tried this recipe and loved it. The asparagus was not bitter and full of flavor. Even my husband enjoyed it and he is not a fan of asparagus.

I'm not even a huge fan of asparagus, but we're trying to eat a bigger variety of vegetables so we gave this a shot. It was awesome. Don't skip out on the cheese, garlic, or lemon juice. It's all good.

Made this tonight for dinner, exactly as written with everything except the lemon juice which I did;t have on hand. 
Unfortunately it was WAY too salty. The other flavors were good and I will definitely try again with 1/4 to 1/2 the salt recommended. I wish I had read the reviews first.

Great recipe however I like my asparagus a little more firm so I shortened the baking time to 8 min and it was perfect.  I added all of the "optional" ingredients and the only change I would make is use less olive oil. I made it to go with my Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. It disappeared so fast that next time I will double the recipe. Thanks for the terrific recipe I will use it again and again.

This tasted AMAZING. I cut the asparagus into 3-inch pieces and coated them in all the ingredients (including the lemon juice). Then baked for about 10 minutes. Turned out absolutely delicious!!

Made recipe as is. It was good, but seemed a little salty (and I do love salt!). I would omit the salt as the Parmesan cheese will add a salt taste to the dish, but perhaps that is dependent on the type of parmesean cheese used fresh vs. pre-made. If you opt out of adding cheese, add the salt.

The blend of seasonings on the asparagus is absolutely DELICIOUS!  My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe BUT agreed that it is WAY TOO SALTY (we did make it with the optional parmesan cheese which is salty in itself so perhaps you don't even need to add salt if you use the parmesan) and is A LITTLE TOO OILY.  For these two reasons, I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  But with the right amounts of salt and oil, this can definitely be a 5 star recipe!

This is quick, easy and really delicious. I used less than half of the salt and it was salty enough for me. I am vegan, so I used nutritional yeast instead of parmesan cheese and it worked perfectly.

Tasty & quick to make.  I'm not a big asparagus eater, but have been trying to make healthier food options for the family.  The asparagus was very flavorful & a big hit with the family.  I would recommend to others.

My family had limited and unpleasant experiences with asparagus when I first made this recipe.  I followed it to-the-letter and the result was a new family staple.  In fact, it inspired the planting of our now two-year old asparagus plants.  I sometimes add crushed red pepper flakes and I'm considering experimenting with Sriracha.  So, it's a great base recipe, too.  Thank you for posting this, swedishmilk!

I needed an incredibly easy, reliable, fast technique to use at someone else's crowded kitchen. Thank goodness for Allrecipes iPhone access! The only thing I did to the asparagus was brush them with garlic oil, lay them single layer on a cookie sheet, 450* oven till tender @ 10-15 minutes (I kept an eye on them). Every one of them was eaten!

Just tried this super easy but delicious recipe tonight that even all asparagus haters loved and asparagus lovers loved more! It's very difficult to get my 20 year old boyfriend to eat vegetables and this did the trick! Easy prep, easy cooking, easy clean up, and a happy belly. I didn't measure out the amount of salt, pepper and Parmesan cheese I used, I sprinkled how much I wanted as well as the lemon juice and it still turned out pretty tasty. Perfect and super simple recipe.

This is SO good! The only thing is it's very salty with both Parmesan and salt. I only used 1/2 tsp of salt and it was still way too much but still very, very good. Next time, I will use less salt, a little less oil, and maybe shredded parm rather than grated.

My family totally loved this recipe. Instead of cooking the asparagus in the oven I cooked them on the BBQ. Was amazing! Usually there is always leftovers when I cook asparagus but this time we were looking for more! Definitely a keeper!

The asparagus tasted good but they were hard to bite or cut. Even though tender it was still too sinuey. Either need to cook it shorter or at a lower temp.

We loved this recipe! Even my boyfriend, who hates asparagus, loved it. He said that's the only way he will eat it now. I added the Parmesan when I put the spears on the baking sheet and used a little less salt, otherwise I followed the recipe, including the garlic. Great tip about removing the woody part of the stems too!

I tried this tonight with just the salt, olive oil and parmesan cheese.  Delicious!  Looking forward to adding additional ingredients next time my fridge is fully-stocked!

Delicious! I use all the optional ingredients, a little extra garlic, and use just a few shakes of salt and pepper. This is also wonderful with thinly sliced cauliflower, increasing the cook time to about 25 minutes. Thank you!

Excellent recipe, lots of flavor and great taste. I always follow the recipe and go from there. I would cut down on the pepper by half and will use fresh lemon instead of bottled lemon, as to the fact it was what I had on hand. Living in Arizona, I made this on the grill in a alum pan, and had nothing but great raves from the family. A keeper for years to come. Thanks Swedishmilk!

This recipe is amazing.  My husband & I love asparagus but our kids, not so much.  The first time I made this, they could not get enough.  Everyone loved it.  Too bad the season is so short.

I made this recipe minus the lemon juice as I dont like citrus on my asparagus unless in a salad. My husband really liked this, as did me and my kids. Will definitely use this method again. I liked that I did not have to blanch them first like when I saute them.

Delicious! I halved the salt as others had mentioned, and it was still too salty, although I have no idea how the quantity I had compared to "a bunch," since it was from a friend's garden. I also didn't have lemon juice. Asparagus is a new veggie for us, and both my husband and I enjoyed it.

Tried it last night and it was perfect. Paired it with fish and couscous and my husband love the asparagus the most! Also the fact that we own our own diner and he liked THIS recipe better than our sautéed one speaks a million! 

Try to uses a thicker asparagus for the baking. Enjoy and don't forget to sprinkle the lemon at the end. It gives it a kick!! Enjoyyyyy

I had such high hopes for this asparagus, but it didn't turn out as I had expected. It tasted fine, but it certainly wasn't extraordinary. The parmesan added a nice texture, but it needed more flavor overall - perhaps some chili flakes or seasoned salt.

Amazing, easy to prepare, and the ability to "customize" the flavor to your own liking.  I backed off a little on the salt and it was perfect.  Might add some bacon next time to offset the slight sour taste of fresh asparagus.  Love it!

This asparagus was a hit at Easter dinner! My 13 month old didn't each much else. :) I covered my cookie sheets with aluminum foil before lining up the asparagus. Just before putting them into the 350 degree preheated oven, I sprayed them liberally with cooking spray, and sprinkled with salt, pepper, and a little bit of garlic powder. They were in the oven for 10 minutes, and then I sprinkled them with parmesan and a little lemon juice. Tasty! Thank you for the recipe and the cook's note about removing the woody ends--what a huge difference! Thank you.

WAY too much salt! (That's because the parmesan cheese is also salty.) Even 1/2 tsp. was too much for us. Otherwise, the recipe is great!

I'm a huge asparagus fan.  My family not so much.  I made this recipe the other night and WOW they gobbled it up.  Easy to make and prep. Full of taste! They have asked me to make it a weekly staple.  I recommend only 10 minutes in the oven.

Only giving it four stars because I modified mine slightly.  Left out the pepper, lemon juice, and garlic.  Parm adds a nice touch, but isn't exactly necessary.

Delicious! I did not measure any of the ingredients, just sort of eyeballed it. Also, to keep clean up at a minimum, I lined my baking sheet w/ foil and just mixed everything up right on the sheet and baked...easy peasy! I will def be making these often~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

You made me a fan of asparagus.  I read the reviews and only used 1/4 tsp of salt, and sprinkled the parm. cheese on the asparagus right before I put them in the oven which gave them some "crunch"....Very easy and delicious recipe...

This same recipe is excellent on the BBQ. I put it into a Z-loc bag to mix and cook it on one of those bbq pans with the holes in it, about 5 minutes is plenty.

Solid recipe. Awesome taste with extra garlic & the parm & lemon. This isn't possible to screw up unless you add TOO much lemon juice. This is also amazing on the grill (charcoal, of course) on some foil. Double yum!

The flavor was really good but mine were cooked too long. I think 8-10 mins would have been good. I don't think mine were thin so may want to keep checking them.

Delicious-didn't measure the ingredients, just mixed a little olive oil in bowl with minced garlic. Spread over asparagus with pastry brush, then sprinkled it with some sea salt and Parmesan cheese. Baked for about 8 minutes....PERFECT!!!

A tasty and quick way to prepare asparagus. Only 2nd time cooking fresh asparagus. Used all ingredients except lemon juice. Also, added salt and pepper by shaker which was very minimal. Added plenty of parmesan which made it very delicious.   Cooked for approximately 10 mins. Turned out great. Will definitely make again.

This was good and would be even better with less salt.  I will use this recipe in the future but cut back on the salt.

Made this tonight to go with the Baked Salmon II recipe on this site. I took the olive oil, put it on a plate and just took my hands and rubbed the asparagus with it. I then placed the spears on aluminium foil on a cookie sheet where I then sprinkled on the pepper, and instead of garlic and sea salt I used garlic salt, about a half teaspoon. I used fresh grated parmesan cheese and sprinkled it all over then rubbed it all together to ensure all the asparagus was coated. As I'm typing this I just realized I forgot to use the lemon at the end!! Baked at 425 for about 10 minutes and it came out pretty darn good! I'll make this again with the baked salmon.

Made this tonight. It had WAY too much pepper. I saw the amount and cut it down but it was still too much. I will definitely make this again because it was very tender and quite tasty, not bitter at all, BUT next time I will only use 1/8 tsp of pepper.

Followed the recipe to a T and it was delicious and not too salty. Wasn't sure that I liked asparagus (still not) but at least this recipe made it tolerable.

Loved it. For all the too salty people make sure you are using sea salt and not table salt! And remember in every recipe that you control the amount, it is easy to add salt at the table, but hard to remove it!

Where we live is the #1 producer of asparagus in Canada, so we eat A LOT of it and I'm always looking for new ways to prepare it. This is the best recipe I've tried.
I had just used the last of my fresh garlic in the chicken I was making for dinner, so I used a garlic/sea salt blend instead and didn't use quite as much salt or oil as the recipe called for. I also only cooked it for 8 or 9 minutes. It was fantastic! Even my husband, who isn't super fond of asparagus, really liked it. The asparagus kept it's colour and had a great flavour. Will be making this again in the very near future.

I've never roasted asparagus before, and I was a little apprehensive especially with my 6yr old being a little if-y when it comes too the asparagus. This was AMAZING!! I did cut the salt down per some of the reviews and I will have to say the lemon juice drizzed over it when it was done was just the touch to make it taste nice and fresh :-)

Used only the lemon pepper seasoning, oil & fresh minced garlic.  Baked in toaster oven at 375 for 12 minutes, stirring occasionally to blend in flavor & to avoid over cooking on any one part of the asparagus (i.e. getting it burnt on its side).  Very tender. Do not over cook or it will shrivel up.

The parmesan cheese is salty enough to leave off the additional salt.  Especially if you generally low salt your food.  10 minutes is enough for really thin asparagus.  But this is an awesome recipe.  I add rosemary to mine which amps it up a bit.

BEWARE! The recipe its very good, but you MUST closely watch the cooking time, or the asparagus will shrink and wilt quickly. I think 425 is too hot, so maybe 375 is a better temp. Good otherwise.....

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe.  I have to say that I have always disliked asparagus...and this recipe was terrific.  I wouldn't use quite as much pepper (maybe 1/2) next time as it was a tad spicy for my two kids.   It looked great too.  I baked it in my small countertop convection toaster oven and it took only 6 minutes.  It was done perfectly.  I will definitely make again.  I used all of the ingredients.

Very yummy! I followed the recommendations of other reviewers and changed the salt content to 1/2 tsp and added the Parmesan right before baking it, after it was tossed with other ingredients. This was my first time making asparagus and it will now be my veggie of choice!

First time making asparagus, and I used this recipe. This is a great recipe, that I will used this again. I modified the recipe slightly....I used dry garlic seasoning, because I didn't have fresh garlic. I did use the Parmesan grated cheese and fresh lemon juice. My son loved it also, and wanted 2nd's.

I buy asparagus for two reasons. My husband LOVES it and my kids need to eat it - (it's nutritious and it's always important to expose your kids to different veggies!). I however, have NEVER liked asparagus... until now! Wow. I used all of the optional ingredients. I'm not certain that it made a difference but in a pan over medium heat, I browned the chopped garlic in olive oil first, then drizzled over the asparagus. Then added the other ingredients. VERY GOOD, this would have easily been a 5 star from my husband because anything with asparagus is 5 stars to my husband. My kids ate it without coming up for air, so another 5 stars from them, and YOU MADE ME LIKE ASPARAGUS!!! So 5 stars from me as well. Thanks for this delightfully simple and YUMMY dish! I see more asparagus in the future for us!

Just made this recipe today for lunch and it was very good. However, the baking time is too long. I stopped at ten minutes and the asparagus was a tad overdone. (the spears I used were young and VERY thin) I would have preferred them a little crispy. And there is too much pepper in the recipe even though I love pepper. I would make this again but perhaps substitute Italian dressing for the oil/garlic/salt/lemon and bake for only 8 minutes.

Don't add the parmesean until the last 5 minutes or so, or else it sometimes burns. That said, this is our offical favorite asparagus recipe. Especially in the spring when we can pick wild asparagus. But it tastes delicious with store bought as well.

Easy to prepare, tasty. I opted not to use garlic and forgot about the lemon. Started cooking ten minutes before I expected to serve dinner, but my husband and guests opted to watch the last ten minutes of the Jets football game. Asparagus were still delicious and firm after being in a warmer at 200 degrees for another 20 minutes. P.S., Jets won 27-20.

I had never made asparagus for my family and they absolutely loved it. I have boys that prefer meat over veggies and this recipe was a winner for them. Very flavorful and easy to prep and cook.

One of the best ways to eat asparagus!  I highly recommend this easy and delicious recipe.  I leave off the parmesan (mainly because I forgot it the first time and it was still good), but it's good with or without.

Loved the recipe.  I thought for sure it was going to be way too salty but it wasn't.  I followed the recipe except for the lemon which I will try next time.  My husband took one bite and said mmm what is this seasoned with.  It simply was delious, it will now be my go to recipe.

Great! Definitely reduce the salt. Also, keep in mind if you have thin asparagus, it won't need to cook as long as the thicker ones. I liked this a lot more than my usual steamed asparagus. It stays hot on the plate longer.

Delicious! I used a little less oil and salt than called for and I was in such a hurry to eat I forgot the lemon juice. It was still yummy but it will be even better next time with a little less salt and the added lemon juice! Oh, and my asparagus was really thin so I only cooked for 8 minutes.It was just right!

Absloutely wonderful but used only 1/4 tsp salt. Also had to sub garlic granules and forgot to use the Parmesan. Can't wait to make again and do it according to recipe, because we love anything cooked or baked with Parmesan.

Great easy recipe!  I had about 10 minutes to figure out how to prepare asparagus to go with dinner and this did it!  I didn't follow amounts, but rather used garlic salt, pepper, and parmesan cheese after spraying the asparagus w/ PAM.  Couldn't be easier!

The recommended cooking time is going to be a bit long for most stalks.  I like my asparagus to have a bit of crunch, so next time I make this, I will check them at about 8-10 minutes.

This was an amazing dish! I didn't cook it as long as I should have but it was still really good. I liked the garlic touch to it (considering hubby doesn't like asparagus but he loves garlic...and he loved it!) so I'm planning on making this again :)

I made this with dinner last night and my husband who does not like asparagus loved it!! My three year old had five whole pieces! I did use butter instead of olive oil though, and i think it made it just our style. I cooked it for 15 minutes.

Tonight my grown sons came home for dinner, and I served this dish as a side with a roasted leg of lamb seasoned with garlic and rosemary and potato pancakes.  The asparagus turned out to be the biggest hit of the entire dinner.  Perfectly crisp and tender.  The only thing I did differently was omit the salt because I think the Parmesan adds enough saltiness.  My husband insisted that I make this again, and as soon as possible!

I didn't follow the ingredient amounts exactly.  I drizzled olive oil over the asparagus and then sprinkled salt, pepper, parmesean and garlic over the asparagus.  I roasted the asapargus for 6-7 minutes until it was tender.  I spent most of my life not eating asparagus and now I'm a huge fan.

Delicious! I used Italian dressing instead of oil and the seasonings, which was very easy to do. I added large slivers of sweet onion. Yum! Baked at 435 for 16 minutes. I couldn't get enough and I can't wait to make this again.

I've made this several times now. Like some of the other reviewers, I reduced the salt (by about half) and the cooking time definitely varies based on the size of the stalk used. My family found it delicious both with and without the addition of lemon juice. All in all, this recipe is incredibly forgiving, and has earned nothing but compliments from guests.

Delish! I haven't had asparagus much and am new to cooking it. Simple and fast. I didn't use lemon and did add the parmesan cheese. Best asparagus I have had. Hubby and two year old loved it as well.

I made this dish almost exactly as the recipe said, and it was delicious! The only thing I did differently was I added the lemon juice directly to the mixture before roasting, which I thought helped spread the lemon juice more evenly and added a tangy flavor to offset the saltiness. We served it at a dinner party last night to rave reviews!

Awesome! I usually add at least one bunch of peeled garlic to the pan and add the lemon juice before hand (because I'm forgetful) and it always turns out fantastic. Crunchy and the garlic is usually nicely roasted. Also good with tablespoons instead of teaspoons.

Savory and delicious! I love this recipe!I've never really enjoyed eating asparagus spears until now.Didn't have any parmesan cheese at home so grated some chedder instead. I also substituted orange juice in place of lemon, but it still came out delicious.This is definitely a keeper.

This was fantastic! The only thing I changed was using lemon pepper instead of lemon juice. I usually cook in the frying pan but this kept the flavour and didn't make the asparagus mushy.

Love this recipe. Used all the optional ingredients and will make it again. I agree that with my oven and thin asparagus, 6-8 minutes is perfect.

I made this exactly to the recipe (Choosing to opt out of the lemon juice.) I also added a handful of shredded mozzarella cheese on top and found it to be the best asparagus I have ever had! I love this vegetable, but my husband usually doesn't really care for it. He was amazed. I will make this my standard asparagus recipe!

I went with what others suggested and only roasted for 8 minutes. Then I stuck the pan under the broiler for about a minute to get the cheese nice and crispy. In the future I might not even add salt because Parm cheese is quite salty on its own. Overall, very tasty way to eat asparagus! :)

Very easy, very tasty, very quick. I'll only give it four stars because it wasn't mind meltingly amazing or anything, but it's a great dish to add into the dinner rotation and uses ingredients I ALWAYS have on hand.

This recipe is great! I served this at a dinner party and I unfortunately let it sit for an extra unwanted 2 minutes in the oven. The tips of the asparagus burnt a bit, but they still tasted nice and crispy. I served this with a buttermilk and garlic dip.

Four-and-a-half stars!  I love being able to utilize produce that grows in our garden, so this recipe was a perfect way to try something besides the usual steaming method. I omitted the parmesan because of dairy issues in our family and only used about half the salt and pepper. It was a hit. :)

followed the recipe exactly and found it to be a bit too salty the first time I made it. but I could tell it still had a great flavor, so the second time I  just cut the salt and YUM! 5 stars for sure! Delicious!!
