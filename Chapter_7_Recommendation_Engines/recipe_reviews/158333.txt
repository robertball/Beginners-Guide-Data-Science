I changed somethings around, instead of lemon extract I used 3/4 the zest of a lemon + 1 tablespoon lemon juice...the cupcakes to me were closer to the consistency of a pouncdcake. For Icing I used store-bought cream cheese icing + 1/4 cup milk + 1/2 cup cool whip + 1/4 zest of a lemon.

The day that I baked these, they were yummy. Once I refrigerated over night, they were SO DENSE, I really did not care for them.

I think it has a lot of possibilities just by changing the soda flavor and extract.  I used raspberry ginger ale and raspberry extract, as that was what I had on hand.  I had to bake my cupcakes for 30 minutes.

So these looked pretty good but I wanted to make them lighter, so I added a teaspoon of baking soda and left out an egg.  It worked!  I was a bit worried, as I've never tried that before, but these ended up as lighter, lemony cupcakes, which is what I was going for.  I just frosted with a storebought frosting I wanted to use up, and it worked well.  This does make a lot of cupcakes, so bear that in mind.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was the perfect recipe for my Margarita Cupcakes!  I used a cream cheese frosting, unsweetened coconut flakes at the "margarita salt", a gummy lime and real straws cut to the perfect size.  I used Roundabout cupcake sleeves as the base ... nice touch!  (see pictures)  Also we don't drink soda but we do drink Mike's; I replaced the soda with 3/4c Mike's Hard Limeade.  The base is a Roundabout sleeve: http://momstart.com/2011/01/roundabouts-the-fun-way-to-have-a-cupcake-giveaway/.

This cake was tasty and unique but it was really dense. The only thing I changed was I made it in a 13x9, but it was a really humid day so that could have made a difference. I put a cool whip frosting on it. Everyone liked it!

The cupcakes were very good.  Made them twice so far.  Flavourful.  I did not have lemon extract and used 1 tbsp lemon emulco instead, which was just about right.  The cake was fine even after sitting in the fridge for a week.  It was still soft and tasty.  Goes very well with cream cheese frosting. Edit - added 2 tbsps of strawberry flavouring with strawberry soda & 1 tbsp of strawberry jam - got very tasty, pink strawberry cupcakes.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for!  I made a couple of fun St. Pat's changes.  I didn't have lemon-lime soda so I used Jones' Green Apple (which is green) and added a little green food paste.  FUN!  I also made a cream cheese buttercream for on top and dipped a tiny shamrock cookie cutter in the food coloring and dabbed it on top.  FUN AGAIN!  My boys loved them.  I'll definatly make this again without making changes.  Thank you for a great recipe!

These are fantastic! I often make poundcake trifles, and now I'll be using this recipe to make the poundcake instead of buying frozen - it's worth the little extra work. For the lemon flavor, I did add the zest of one lemon along with the other ingredients - didn't find it to be too much, since the flavor is subtle. I did manage to get about 2 1/2 dozen cupcakes out of the recipe, and if I'd filled them higher it would have been messy. These are so rich, they don't really need a frosting, but I did make one out of reduced fat cream cheese and powdered sugar (with vanilla extract and a little water) - piped heart shapes on them. My children loved them and luckily I have enough (unfrosted ones) to freeze and serve later in the week.

I've used this exact recipe for almost the last 30 years.  I've always used it as a 7-Up Pound cake.  I've never tried it as cupcakes.  The only difference, I cook at 325 degrees for 1 to 1 1/4 hours (as a pound cake).  This is a very moist cake.  I've occasionally added 1 TBSP banana flavoring and a few TBSPs of pineapple juice.  It gives this cake an excellent taste.  This is my all time favorite pound cake.  I've also made this cake as a 3 layer cake.  ~ Absolutely Delicious! ~

This is a heavy textured cake. Not something the kids will like.  Good flavor though.  I topped mine with cream cheese frosting and coconut.

Okay soo I had to make these. But I was disappointed by the look of the cupcakes, they were flat looking. No puffy round top. They all seem to spread like a wafer cookie on the top of the pan and crust up. When making the 1st tray, I used the square muffin pan, sprayed liberally with non-stick spray(well~they stuck)...and every one wouldn't come out at all. All had to be dug out. So I then made sure that all the rest of the cupcakes were done in paper liners...And they were fine but did the same as tray I made...they rose to the top of the liners and spread out like wafers...and again stuck. They sure weren't pretty. They sprang back & had great flavor. I am not sure if adding baking soda & salt would have helped but it might be something I'd consider another go around. And less whipping. Because like I said....they were flat. The taste was wonderful. Topped with a pineapple cream cheese icing.

I did not care for this recipe. They were dense in an unpleasant way and there was an odd eggy taste to them. Didn't get the lemon/lime flavor at all. I think the soda was what did the recipe in for me.

Very happy with this recipe.  I wanted the denseness described in previous reviews.  I made them in a mini muffin pan and turned them into pettit fours.  I replaced the lemon extract and lemon lime soda with the zest and juice of one lemon and one lime.  If you needed a bit more moisture you could add a couple spoonsful of 7-up.  they really worked out for my purposes.

Yum! We did not find these to be "dense" at all. They were light and sweet and the kids gobbled them up without any frosting. Even the 4 yr old who likes "only chocolate cake".

These are great.  I have made them three times. They come out of muffin cups at the top but that makes them taste like a cookie on a cake.  Very good with cream cheese frosting.

These were so tasty it was hard to quit eating them! The flavor was nice and lemony and they were sweet rather than tart. It sounded like a lot of lemon extract but didn't taste too lemony or tart. I only had 4 eggs though and had to manage with that. This is a very moist, very delicate, fine cake, and it didn't need any frosting. In fact I had trouble with them after baking as the middles tended to sink and the edges cracked and they were very fragile. The taste was excellent though and the crumb was very fine and delicate and definitely these are worth making! Wedding cake quality texture and flavor but the mini cupcakes were a disaster and the regular sized ones cracked and fell in the middles although the cake was done.

I followed the recipe as-is (with exception of using a diet lemon-lime soda because that's all I had) and these came out great overall.  They were very lemon-tasty.  The tops of the cupcakes did go flat throughout the baking process.  The tops looked like cookies sitting on top of a cupcake.    This didn't bother me at all and what I did was mix some store-bought cream cheese frosting and mixed 2 teaspoons of lemon-extract per each container of frosting and piped the frosting on.  I went through two containers of frosting for a little less than 36 cupcakes (a few of the cupcakes went without frosting).  The cupcakes are good without the frosting but even better with them.  Definite lemony goodness.  My husband ate these up like mad!  I will be making these again!

I thought it was an amazing, moist, dense cupcake.  Tasted like a citrus meringue pie!  Some lemon curd to fill and whipped cream flavored with some citrus peel would be divine.  I want to try ginger ale with some ginger fresh ginger next time.   *Did want to mention, my husband wasn't fond of these, but citrus flavored desserts aren't his thing.

I did not like these cupcakes.  They turned out incredibly dense and while all of the flavors were mild, there was a hint of egg taste that was about as strong as the lemon-lime taste.  I do like the idea of using lemon-lime soda in a cupcake.  Next time, I think I will try it with a different batter.

These were fantastic!  We didn't even put frosting on them...they were perfect just as they were.  Followed the recipe exactly with no problems.  Thanks!

Nice! I didn't have 7Up so I used Pineapple flavored Fanta and omitted the lemon (obviously).  Took way more than 25 minutes to cook through but they were worth it!

Great taste, great texture! The only change I made was 2 more tablespoons of lemon extract for a more rich taste.

Didn't care for the aftertaste of the lemon extract. Would probably choose to use 2 TBS of lemon juice, instead of lemon extract.

I love making these cupcakes!  Not only is the end result really good, but I like to lick the spoon at the end because the batter is fizzy.  I've made these for my class of 28 kids with some cream cheese icing and a gummy worm on top, and everyone loved them.

I made these for the first time.Unless with cooking with baking one has to follow exactly the recipe or it will end up as a failure. As the receipe doesn't say anything about the butter, I was wondering how to measure exactly 1 1/2 cups of butter without melting it. So I cutted the butter in small cubes and estimated the gaps. I think for that quantity of butter it would be easier to measure it in grams or ounces. Well, what I got at the end was really good and my wife loved them too. As for the butter, I rated it only with 3 stars.

I made this recipe for the first time to take to a carnival for a "cupcake walk" and it was a hit. I frosted the cupcakes with cream cheese frosting and added Sweettart candies on top for garnish.

Only reason I didn't give it 5, because the taste was amazing, is it was way too much batter. I made a small loaf of it too even after 24 cupcakes :D

These are very good! The only thing I changed was that I used lemon essential oil instead of extract. I followed the directions alternating the flour and 7-up and the texture of the cupcakes aren't pound cake like at all!

I omitted the soda and extract added lemon juice 2T. And zest of both lemon and limes.  I added 1t of baking powder, and homemade lemonade for the liquid as needed. I iced them with a cream cheese frosting with lime zest. I am a cupcake fan. I put a squirt of frosting in the center of the cupcake for an added flavor punch.

I happened to have cherry-flavored 7-Up on hand, so that's what I used to make these wonderful cupcakes! I baked these cupcakes as directed; No changes. My daughter is taking these to school for her Valentine's Day party and I know the kids will absolutely love them.
