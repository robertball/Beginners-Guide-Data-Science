The sauce was fantastic for the this recipe. I have to add a couple of comments though. The recipe does not mention what to do with the bacon grease after cooking the bacon; I drained the majority of it after cooking, leaving a teaspoon or so to saute the shallots. I think much more would have made the sauce too greasy. Also, be warned that cooking the sprouts as recommended on a cookie sheet leaves them very al dente. I prefer mine a little softer. If I make this again, which I probably will, I most likey will steam the sprouts instead. Soaking them in the salt water did a nice job of removing the bitterness usually associated with the vegetable and was a good trick - one I will use again. Thanks for a nice recipe!

These are so delicious. I can imagine brussels sprouts haters being converted by this recipe. I did make two substitutions. I used half-and-half in place of cream and button mushrooms instead of criminis. (Both items were on hand and a grocery run was out.) My sherry was just regular "Dry Sherry", also. Normally I try to avoid a lot of substitutions when making a recipe for the first time, but I don't believe these changed the final outcome significantly. I loved the depth of flavor that roasting the sprouts added to this dish. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Excellent!  My favorite brussel sprout recipe.  The flavors were outstanding. Roasting the sprouts gave them a unique taste and texture that  I liked much more than boiling.

I really like this recipe it is really good, I live alone and made the full recipe for myself, it does keep well cold for about a week. I made a few adjustments i quartered the brussels sprouts when i roasted them, and I also added some parm cheese to the sauce which i really throught added a little bit to the sauce. I have made this few times now once with fresh sprouts and once with frozen either way was good. Fresh was more crisp.

Wonderful recipe!  I have made this several times now.  I brought it to Thanksgiving dinner expecting to have leftovers (my family is a little picky) but they all raved about how delicious they were and went back for seconds.  The second time I made it, I strained the bacon out and reserved it, then sprinkled it over the top before serving.  I thought that added to the texture.

The sauce is simply AMAZING!  You can can easily substitute green beans or asparagus, and the more bacon the better!

This was just okay.  I had a bag of fresh cranberries that I bought on a whim.  Added them to the sauce while cooking.  I let them cook until they started to burst.  They were great and really added to the flavor.

The sauce wasn't as robust in flavor as I'd expected, but still very tasty and satisfying.

I would recommend that the brussels sprouts be quartered if they are on the larger side as the oven roasting method doesn't cook them quite enough for most people's taste.

Mmmmmm...the sauce is delicious.  I used onion instead of shallots and button mushroom instead of crimini because I couldn't find them at the grocery (but I don't think it radically changed the flavor).  My husband is not normally a fan of brussel sprouts but loved these.  The leftovers were great too!  Definitely a hit at our house.

Made this for dinner party and kids loved it! I did make a few substitutions, used baby bella instead of cremini mushrooms.  I was not sure how the parents would feel about sherry with the kids I used 1/8 cup apple cider vinegar and 2 TBSP vanilla.  This was a huge hit!

This was the first time I ever made brussels sprouts for my family.  I was very nervous as they took their first bites, but all of them (including a 9-yo and a 7-yo) ate it and complimented it.

Marvelous!  My husband loves brussels sprouts and I've always been kind of iffy, but we both really loved this. Roasting the sprouts really makes them nice and tender and brings out a good flavor.  The only minor change I made was to add a bit of Worcestershire to the sauce, which always gives a little extra savoriness (we think).  We'll definitely be making this one again - thanks for sharing!

I'm rating this recipe 5 stars with modifications, so take it as you'd like. First of all, I had a bag of brussels sprouts I needed to use up and was hoping to make something healthy. Although this recipe had lots of great reviews, I did not want to use cream or even half and half as some reviewers suggested, so I instead substituted in skim milk. Both my boyfriend and I agreed that this recipe came out delicious. I also left the mushrooms out (personal preference) and used regular onion instead of shallots since that's what we had on hand. I think that we'll be making this again, an excellent way to cook this veggie.

Hands down, this is the best thing that has EVER happened to Brussel Sprouts.  I can hardly bring myself to eat them most of the time, let alone my sons!  I have searched and searched for a great way to do these...this is simply amazing!   I made this over Thanksgiving for my wife's family and my son's girlfriend, who is an extremely picky eater.....gone!  And i doubled it!  

Roasting is the key at the highest heat you can.  I let my sauce sit and simmer while I roast and then immediately toss.  

Highly recommend this recipe!

If I could give it 100 stars I would. I soaked the sprouts in water in a pot then boiled them for a few minutes before roasting. Beautiful flavors. Hubby thought restreraunt quality.

LOVE. THIS. RECIPE!  If I could give it 100 stars, I would!
Brussels Sprouts are, by far, my favorite vegetable and these were absolutely delicious - unhealthy, but delicious!
I believe the only modifications I made were:  
pancetta instead of bacon, 86 the mushrooms (simply because I didn't have any at home), and I added a little red wine vinegar in addition to the sherry.

Excellent!  I'm allergic to mushrooms so left them out, but got rave reviews from the 22 people we had at Christmas dinner!  This is actually a dish I will make again, but will make it one day in advance...it's even better the 2nd day as I'm finding out right now!

These are awesome.  They have a very good flavor and texture.  We are not normally fans of brussels sprouts, but we liked these!  They are even good re-heated the next day.

I'd give this recipe a million stars! It is FANTASTIC! Made it for Thanksgiving dinner. EVERYONE raved about it. Made a double batch & followed the recipe ingredients exactly as stated (added 1 lb bacon for a double recipe - who could go wrong with more bacon?). Used the cheapest bottle of cream sherry from the liquor store (only $6). This is, obviously, not low in fat, but it's totally worth the splurge!

This recipes is fantastic. It can convert even the most steadfast Brussels hater! The only changes I made was adding about 2T of fresh thyme leaves to the Brussels along with the olive oil, sea salt and pepper prior to roasting and I used cremini and shitake mushrooms in the sauce. Everything else I followed just as the author posted. I would recommend this recipe hands down to any holiday meal or any meal for that matter. Definitely worth 5 stars.

PHENOMENAL!! The first time I tried this, I was in a pinch & used frozen Brussels &, though it was tasty, it was a tad mushy for my liking so I prefer to stick to raw/fresh now. Draining the bacon grease is blasphemous... don't do it... it's needed to sauté & season the mushrooms & shallot. On a side note, Criminis are also labeled Baby Bellas so don't think you're cheating if you just wanna deal with Wal*Mart's baby bellas ;) If you're sauce isn't thickening, you're not letting it heat long enough...just keep it on Medium & it will reduce...have patience. I always double the sherry & cream amounts simply because I'm a saucy gal ;) I've also used sweet red wine when I don't have cream sherry and it's still good though not QUITE as good as the sherry. I'm in love with this recipe! Thank you so much for providing it!!

Sooooo good! Next time, I would skip soaking the sprouts for 1 hour as we found no noticeable change in taste. If wanting softer sprouts versus crunchier ones, soaking for 10-15 minutes is sufficient. The extra moisture creates steam while oven roasting. Roasting is what gives sprouts a sweeter flavor than when they’re sauteed, steamed, or boiled. Overcooking sprouts will release a sulfur compound (glucosinolates), producing an unpleasant smell and flavor that contributes to why people dislike this veggie. Having no cream sherry, paired equal parts oloroso sherry & semi secco marsala thereby tempering the sweetness of the sauce a bit. The sherry bacon cream sauce is so darn good that it’s hard to resist eating it straight from the pan. A great dish for any occasion!

This was DELICIOUS!  I used Shitake mushrooms because I couldn't find cremini.  This is amazing.  I soaked the sprouts as directed.  I baked with the CUT side down for 10 minutes, flipped them and then baked another 10 minuted.  PERFECTION.  This is suitable for a special occasion.

LOVED this!  Someone mentioned the brussel sprouts being a little al dente through roasting.  You need to roast them about 5 minutes longer that the recipe states, and they're perfect. My sauce didn't thicken much at all though, but it was still delicious.

This is such a suprisingly wonderful vegetable dish! I did not place brussel sprouts on my "favorite vegetables" list until tonight...Thank you so much!!!

As a side note....I doubled the sherry and cream and added a lot more garlic to suit my family's personal tastes...I also cooked the bacon and crumbled it.

WOW! I made this for Thanksgiving on a whim, because I love sprouts and nobody else will touch them... Sure enough, everybody LOVED them - and even called to request that I bring them to Christmas dinner, along with the recipe. They fought over the very small amount of leftovers afterward.  LOL  I didn't change a thing; these were absolutely fantastic.

Amazing.  I was given some fresh brussel sprouts and made this recipe last minute with what I had on hand.  I didn't have any shallots or cremini mushrooms, though I did substitute button mushrooms.  It might be the best vegetable dish I have ever eaten.  It's earned a place on the Thanksgiving dinner menu.  Thanks for sharing!

Best Brussels sprouts recipe ever!  However, it is not a light and healthy dish.  I omitted the mushrooms, and would substitute the bacon for prosciutto next time I made it.  Definitely makes a difference when you soak the sprouts in salt water.  Also don't forget to toss in olive oil and salt and pepper before you bake them.  I thankfully caught that about 8 min. into the baking period.  Cream sherry adds great flavor, so don't omit.  ps. It's a liqueur, so you won't find it in the grocery store.

Loved these. Use a good quality bacon and there will be no grease to drain. I had to substitute apple cider vinegar and water for the sherry. It's a nice delicate sauce for the sprouts. Make sure you put your sprouts face side down or they will dry out completely.

My Brussels sprout haters said these were the best they'd ever tasted but still would rather not eat them. Those of us new to sprouts loved them.

This recipe was amazing just as it was.  I made a nine pound batch for Christmas dinner.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  Had to extend the roasting time to about 30 minutes because of the large quantity.

This was my first time cooking brussels sprouts so I was a little skeptical. The sauce is delicious, my only negative is that the sprouts tasted a little bitter but maybe that is just they way they taste? A tasty recipe regardless!

My fiancee and I kept stealing spoonfuls of sauce as it was cooking since it was SO good, and when we were done eating, he said "that sherry cream sauce is a keeper." The brussels sprouts themselves were just okay. I have roasted brussels sprouts before without soaking them beforehand, and in my opinion the soaking beforehand didn't really do anything (especially if you're going to smother them in the cream sauce anyway). We both agreed the mixture sans brussels sprouts would be amazing over pasta or chicken or...ANYthing. Make it!

Made this recipe as written, but omitted soaking the brussels sprouts in salted water as I wasn't sure what that would add, and also roasted them at a lower oven temperature.  This was truly amazing, can't wait to make it for company now.

Fantastic recipe.  Like others, I doubled the sauce, but could have used even more.  It was wonderful served over basmati rice.  To thicken it up a little faster, I added a touch of grated parmesan cheese.

I was cooking a lot of bacon for another dish I was making.  I simple kept 1-2TBS of the bacon drippings to sauté the shallots, mushrooms and garlic.  Excellent recipe!

Decided on this recipe since my oven was already taken up with a roast. I soaked, seasoned and roasted the sprouts earlier in the afternoon then about 20 minutes prior to dinner, started the sauce, reheating the pre-roasted sprouts in the pan. Wow, what a wonderful way to serve sprouts!! I left out the mushrooms as we were having mushrooms as a side dish and unfortunately the sherry I though I had was marsala wine but even my Brussel sprout hating daughter ("I though you loved us!" she said when I told her this was on the menu, lol!) ended up going back for a second helping. Perfect side dish that impresses!!!

Awesome recipe.  I've had many people decide they like Brussels sprouts after all but only when made this way.  I only soak them for about 10 minutes because they don't steam  as much when you roast them so they come out a little crisper

What a fabulous dish! I cut off some of the fat prior to frying the bacon. I used what was left in which to cook the rest. Definitely a keeper recipe.

I decided to experiment with this recipe. I thought this would be great for Christmas Eve dinner but I have to work Christmas Eve until 2. So I decided to try this recipe ahead of time to see what would happen. So I roasted the Brussels sprouts a day ahead and also made the sauce the day before. I must first add that I followed the ingredients and most of the instructions exactly as written. I prepared the Brussels sprouts exactly as written and put them in a casserole dish after they were roasted, covered with saran wrap. Then I made the sauce exactly as written except after it began to boil I put it into a container and put it into the fridge, I did not let it reduce by half. The next day when I was ready to try my experiment I put the Brussels sprouts into oven at 325 because I was roasting a chicken, and let them heat up in oven for about 15 min, meanwhile I put the prepared sauce in a sauce pan and let it heat up. When the chicken was done and the Brussels sprouts were hot I poured the sauce over them and mixed the sauce and Brussels sprouts together. (Oh sorry, I forgot I doubled the cooked bacon and made sure to cook it until crisp) (I have bacon lovers)  I left a few teaspoons of bacon grease in pan when sautéing the onion and mushroom and garlic. I could not believe how good this turned out. I will be making this for Christmas Eve 2013 thanks to your great recipe and my experiment.  Thank You !!!!!!!!!!!!!

We are not brussel sprout fans, but keep hoping to convert.  This was our second attempt at a brussel sprout recipe and it was good.  In fact, my husband said "this is gooooooood".  We made only two changes: used regular sherry instead of cream sherry (because I couldn't find it) and added more mushrooms.  A little of this dish goes a long way - it is very rich.  I might try reducing the heavy cream a bit next time.

I finally got some of the brussel sprout haters in my family to try them thanks to this recipe. Turns out the trick was to smother them in bacon and booze. This was very rich but also very good.

I have a whole bottle of cream sherry that I had no idea what to do with....and found this recipe, very good! Cream Sherry is such an interesting flavor, combined with the bacon, cream and mushrooms, it's even better! 
This sauce would taste good with any kind of green veggie, or maybe pasta?! Thanks for sharing!!

I use this recipe all the time for family functions. People that swear they don’t like Brussel sprouts will be converted. I would recommend draining the majority of the bacon fat before adding in the shallots and bacon.

I made this once before and it was the first time my wife enjoyed brussel sprouts. This time I had to substitute ham for bacon, yellow onions for shallots and sliced garlic cloves for the mushrooms. It still came out awesome! Great recipe.

I have never liked Brussels sprouts (ew! yuck!) but I'm trying to incorporate a greater variety of vegetables into our diet. I made this version and was surprised to find myself actually eating ALL of my Brussels sprouts! My hubby really liked these a lot! I did add salt and pepper to the sauce while it was cooking. I'm glad I did because the sauce was quite mild in flavor despite my adding the salt/pepper. I will make this again but may use a little more salt/pepper in the sauce next time.

This is our new favorite Brussels sprouts recipe. I have substituted prosciutto for the bacon and added extra mushrooms and results were fabulous. Have made this for two dinner parties and they received rave reviews!

Definitely don't skip the salt water soak! it's how I prepare my sprouts every time now. I'd say also keep an eye on those Brussels sprouts once they're in the oven, mine got a little too charred. Unlike previous reviewers, I left all of the bacon grease in the skillet. The sauce was so rich and creamy. I only make this for special occasions, but each time I've turned a brussels sprout hater into a brussels sprout lover!

Couldn’t find creamed sherry at store, so just went with regular cooking sherry. I also was short on time when I made this and used fully cooked bacon pieces from the condiments and salad dressing aisle (I do this often for recipes to cut back on mess and time) and a couple teaspoons of bacon grease from our grease pot. Also just used remains of white mushrooms vs cremini aka ‘baby bella’ mushrooms. Flavor would have been more robust with the cremini, I’m sure, but trying to use up what was on hand to save money. 10/10, would make again! Great, rich finish to this. Served alongside a balsamic marinated pork loin, perfect pairing!

I sliced the sprouts and put on grill to brown a bit on each side. I added sliced red peppers and topped with parmesan cheese and a squeeze of lemon. mmm.

Sooo.. I made this for Christmas.. I followed it according to the recipe but added extra bacon. I wish i had crisped the bacon up more than I did. I don't know if it was the bacon I used or what but It didn't have the flavour I was imagining. Im giving it four stars only because It didn't WOW me as much as I had hoped. Like another reviewer I would have steamed the brussels first because I like them softer than the recipe method. Everyone else liked them. Not a bad recipe.

Made as directed, although I roasted the brussels sprouts a few hours earlier to free up the oven for the main course. This was good, but a little heavy with the cream sauce.

Crowd pleaser. I combined this with elements from the actual Toro Bravo recipe they published. No mushrooms, more cream, and chiffonade sage added after the sherry and before the cream.

Simple and delicious!

After making this for Thanksgiving as a side dish, I keep getting requests to make it again.
The flavor of the bacon and sherry sauce, along with the crispiness of the roasted sprouts, give this dish an amazing texture and wonderfully complex flavor.

I never cook brussel sprouts but was trying to find something different to take to Thanksgiving lunch and this recipe caught my eye.  When I would make brussel sprouts in the past they would always taste bitter.  But this recipe is a real winner.  So much rich flavor and I will definitely be making these again.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving last year. I have since made it several times. It was truly awesome.  I however did not initially  realize the  brussel sprouts have to soak for one hour prior to cooking so factor that in.   left out the mushrooms, as my family is not fond of them,  We truly love it

Wow, these were delicious! I had to sub onion for the shallot, and unfortunately didn't have any mushrooms on hand, but I don't know how they would've been any better with them?!  I used half & half and probably reduced that delicious sauce a bit too much, but no biggie. I generally roast my sprouts for about 25 min at 425, so that's what I did. I also season the sprouts with some garlic and onion powders, along with some pink himalayan sea salt and freshly ground pepper. These little gems will definitely be made multiple times in the future! Delish!

Delicious  recipe! One suggestion: make sure the bacon is crispy before adding the sherry and cream. I cooked it until the edges were brown(as directed), and the bacon stayed a bit rubbery. Other than that, a very tasy dish.

Wonderful recipe! Thank you for sharing this. I made this ON New Year and it was a hit. My step son realized after eating this he loves Brussels sprouts . Love the sauce and the trick of getting rid of bitterness worked well.

It went down very well last night with a crowd of Cambodians, Brits and Germans. I did cook the sprouts a lot longer than in the recipe. I also used German lean bacon so no worries about the fat. Oh, and I had no Sherry and used white wine instead.

We loved the sauce especially.  Followed the steps to the letter and it all coalesced wonderfully into the finished product.  I did triple the sauce mixture as well as add some bacon bits for extra protein.  I did not use cranberries as I prefer a savory dish to not have sweet components.  Did not drain bacon fat and just let it add to the flavor of the sauce.  I also did some Angel Hair pasta on the side to make it a potential stand alone dish.  FANTASTIC.

I will make this over and over. There were no leftovers at Oktoberfest. Unheard of. I DID change the mushrooms.  I sliced, and cut once in half, HUGE Portabella tops.

11/23/2017- made again for Thanksgiving exactly as written. awesome.  Could eat these every day.

I didn't feel like I needed to soak the brussel sprouts as long as it asked, I did 20 minutes. This dish was phenomenal. Absolutely amazing. LOVE.

Yum! I love that brining the sprouts gets rid of the bitterness they can have. I quartered the sprouts because the ones I had were very large.  I will definitely make this again and again. Can't wait to see what everyone else thinks at dinner!

Since Turkey Day is most definitely NOT about cutting calories, this is what I did. Made it easier and EVEN TASTIER! 
Instead of olive oil, used some leftover sausage/bacon grease from the stuffing in the skillet. Just added the brusses to the skillet with the grease and roasted them right there. Also, I added about a tablespoon or two of brown sugar to the salt and pepper to toss. 
When they're done roasting, dump them in a bowl and cook the sauce in the same skillet. 
Tasty + lazy bonus= DECADENT!!!!

I made this last Thanksgiving to rave reviews, and it is now mandatory for all holiday meals.  Frankly, I was surprised because we've got some very picky eaters in the family, and I really thought I was taking a risk the first time I made it. I follow the recipe exactly though I use the increase it to 12 servings, and though there are only 7 of us, there are never any leftovers. I do use a nitrate free bacon which is more like a Spanish bacon or pancetta than traditional hickory smoked American bacon. The combination of flavors is incredible - the slightly bitter Brussels sprouts (the salt water soak really helps), the sweet and savory sauce with the cream sherry and bacon, just yummy.

Got my two young boys and husband to eat brussel sprouts! Success! Made it dairy free by substituting the cream sherry with sherry and heavy cream with coconut milk. Was great for a gluten and dairy free side dish.

This was amazing. I actually thawed a bag of frozen sprouts and then halved them. Made it w/o mushrooms and used regular sherry and heavy whipping cream. Came out phenomenal. I don't usually change recipes that I find in any way. I like to try them out just like the cook made it first, but I had to use what I had at home, glad it worked out! Great recipe!

Super tasty- however, as others have mentioned, drain off the majority of bacon grease before adding shallot (or in my case onion) and garlic.  Otherwise, very good.

I have been making this recipe for over 2 years and it never disappoints!  The only thing I do differently is roast the sprouts for 15 minutes cut side down then another 5 cut side up.  We found that the extra 5 minutes worked best for our taste.  
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe starshinesMonet.  I have yet to make them and hear anything but praise.

Have to admit, I was worried. The roasting sprouts put out an awful odor, so much so, I shut the oven off and good thing because they were done in half the time. I just kept thinking next time I am boiling them, BUT, in the end it was worth it, they made the dish beautiful being browned and the cream sauce delicious. I grew a love for sherry. I felt it came out a very fancy dish and will make again on the holidays. A keeper!

This is an absolutely scrumptious, restaurant quality recipe for Brussels sprouts. I made it for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.  I savored the leftovers which only became more flavorful the next day.  I added lots of mushrooms, a bit more than called for.  I'd like to try it with milk instead of the heavy cream to cut down on calories.  I didn't have the sherry, so I added a bit of red wine. Best recipe ever for Brussels sprouts!

Very yummy.  People who don't even dig brussels sprouts, loved this side dish.  I substituted port wine for cream sherry.  This compliments the "Beef Tenderloin With Roasted Shallots" recipe also on this site (which also uses port wine).

This is delicious My family doesn't "do" green food in general especially things like Brussel sprouts.

I always thought brussel sprouts were awful and bitter. Cooking them the right way makes them so good.  I didn't want to turn on my oven so I boiled them for about 6 minutes and then browned them, the mushrooms, onion and garlic in my bacon grease until they browned a bit. Add the cream and sherry. Turn off burner, cover with lid and let them sit for a bit to soak up the cream sauce.  If you can wait, refrigerate overnight.  These taste even better to me as a COLD SALAD.

Excellent flavors, easy instructions. Double batch disappeared during Thanksgiving dinner. Might substitute half and half or light cream for the cream component next time, otherwise, spot on.

WOW. I skipped the pre-soak routine.  Think it's not needed.  The whole family devoured it.  The sprouts melted in your mouth after the high temperature roasting and the creamy, smokey sauce is just perfect.  I skipped the soak and the mushrooms and it was divine.

This is amazing!  It is like a real comfort food.  My daughter even made the comment that it was now one of her all time favorite things.  I followed the recipe as it was written except I just had plain Sherry, instead of cream sherry.  If you think brussel sprouts are bitter then don't skip the salt water soak.  I've never really notice bitterness before but my daughter has and she said this did make a difference.

My daughter who doesn't like sprouts ate this up. I had to substitute shallots for red onion. I also increased the garlic to compensate for the lack of shallots. I see why it has been getting 5 stars. It would be great for a company dinner also. Don't bother to make it without doubling it. Everyone will be glad you did.

What an amazing recipe!! I didn't have time to soak the Brussel Sprouts in salt water, and they still came out amazing!! Sauce was delicious. Note: the tablespoon of salt  is ONLYi if you aren't going to soak them in salt water. I'm going to add that sauce to chicken, fish and other recipes too! Oh, and I used turkey bacon the second time I made it and it was just as good but a little bit healthier and less greasy.

These were delicious.  The only substitution I made was white wine instead of sherry (I didn't have any).

This recipe was fantastic!  I deviated only a little, using half and half instead of heavy cream, and baby bellas instead of creminis, but I don't think these substitutions hurt the dish.  I also used thick sliced bacon, and I think next time I'll stick with regular bacon, just as a personal textural preference.  Also, I ended up quartering the sprouts because they were just huge, and due to conflicting oven temps for the rest of the dishes I was preparing, they soaked for more like 3 hours.  In any case, they were delicious, easy, and a huge hit, and I'll definitely be making them again.

My boyfriend liked this, so I'm giving it a four. Its not a five since it hasn't changed my mind in not liking brussel sprouts.

This recipe was a hit with my family, dispite the smell.  We've never had brussel sprouts before so this was a nice recipe to ease everyone into a new veg.

OMG – indescribably delicious.  I don’t generally succumb to hyperbole but this recipe warrants the excess.  Of course, I made changes…  I didn’t have bacon, I had sausage. I had two small turnips and so I sliced them up and they got roasted along with the Brussels sprouts.  I likened it to stroganoff for Brussels sprouts and turnips.  Can’t wait to try it with bacon.  Or pancetta.  And maybe carrots – or whatever vegetable that can be roasted.  Carrots, parsnips, maybe even squash…

DELICIOUS!  Had fun finding the Sherry Cream, but once I did, this came together perfectly!
