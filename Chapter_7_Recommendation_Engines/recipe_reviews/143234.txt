I have never liked the rye bread that local eateries use for reubens. The pumpernickel is why I tried this. I bought deli corned and roast beef, turkey and ham(kids are picky). Also used swiss, american, and pepperjack cheeses. I laid everything out on table and let each assemble their own to their liking. I made mine as stated in the recipe. Except we all used ff thousand island. This was excellent!! My fiance had never tried a reuben and fell in love with this. He tried one later at a local eatery and HATED it!! I swear its the rye... yuck. Anyway, we have made these on the grill, campfire, and in the oven. I dont check the time really, just check the food. The thicker ones were still cold in the middle when the kids sandwiches were done. We will definately keep making this one!!

This method reuined my ruebens, so I had to make a second batch with the skillet method. I was drawn to grilling because I do not have a large enough non-stick skillet to cook 2 sandwiches. I followed the directions to a T, and my bread was, burned, soggy, and stuck to the foil (along with the soggy mess of toppings). This was the only recipe which didn't call for buttering or oiling the bread prior to cooking, so I thought it would be a healthier alternative. From now on I will load the toppings on two slices of buttered rye and cook till golden and melted in a skillet (I'll either get a larger pan, or we'll eat at different times!) The recipe has flawless reviews other than mine, but it really didn't work for me.

I think you will find this much easier if you buy a set of campfire irons. We know them as "Pudgy Pie" irons. Don't go for the lightweight ones - be sure to get the heavy duty variety. Available at camping stores and in many dept store sports sections. They are also great for making pie sanwiches (bread and apple or cherry pie filling; PBJs (bread and peanut butter and jelly; Reeses sandwiches (bread, peanut butter and plain Hersey bars) Or whatever you can dream up. We've even done it with Prego and cheese

I didn't mark down since the write-up mentions using as much or little as you like but 1/4 C dressing and wrapping a sandwich in foil can result in a soggy mess. We grill these in an openfaced fashion and use less sauce. You really can't tell when they are "lightly toasted" if they're all wrapped up. I don't like to use the meat and other fillings straight from the fridge because it's nearly impossible to grill them to a warmed through state without burning the bread. I also use "thousand island dressing" fromthis site but with Frank's Redhot rather than a sweet chili sauce. I have found that about 10 min on the grill is usually adequate and if the bread is toasting before the cheese melts you can easily slide them off the direct heat and let them finish without burning.

These were very very good! I didn't get to grill them though, we were packing for a picnic and so I just made them cold and they were still very good...though I am sure they'd be even better warm and melty!

Love this sandwich!  I made this a couple of years ago while camping and just placed them on the fire grill.  They turned out great and everyone loves them.  Now we are going camping again and will make them again.  Took me awhile to find this recipe again.  Glad I found it!  The only change I made was that I used sourdough rolls instead.

The instructions were perfect- I didn't change a thing when I made these for a camping dinner tonight. Even the kids ate every last bite.

I agree with a few others,  what a soggy mess. You're better off leaving the aluminum foil off the sandwiches altogether,  and throw on the grill!!

Soggy mess.  The bread steamed rather than crisped up.  I prefer to butter my bread and put it in a skillet over the fire.  I also warm up my sauerkraut and corned beef in the skillet first and then assemble the sandwich.  The cheese melts much quicker this way.
