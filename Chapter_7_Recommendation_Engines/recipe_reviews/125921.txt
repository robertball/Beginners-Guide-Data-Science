Even my non-vegetarian husband loved these!  I used jarred roasted peppers and made the sauce with a couple more of them in the mini-food processor.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was so good! The roasted red pepper goes so well with the Asparagus. The swiss cheese didn't overpower the taste of the asparagus either. Toasty and tastey. The dressing was a little runny, but it was good. I think this sandwich would make up nicely as a paninni too.

This was a great, very filling lunch.  I was testing things that would be good for Lent, and came across this recipe, though I made a few changes to mine: Used 1/2 lb asparagus for one sandwich, fresh mozzarella, multi-grain bread, and left out the peppers, since I did not have any on hand.  I didn't find it too messy, but I only eyeballed and probably didn't put in as much lemon so it could spread better.  I loved the texture of the mozz. with the asparagus, and creating this with the peppers and a more flavorful cheese will definitely be on my list in the future.  Especially with all of the possible variations, this one is a keeper.

OK, this sandwich is MESSY! Asparagus, tomato slices, mayo sauce - all just sliding or running out as you bite into it.... Maybe I didn't do it right, but it was still really, really tasty! I'm a card-carrying carnivore and the only veggie sandwich I've ever even considered is the standard Portabella/grilled pepper/goat cheese sandwich. Well, this asparagus sandwich can definitely compete! I'd think twice before throwing those burger patties on the grill. Really! Very, very satisfying!

Great Sandwich....Roommates called it the BLT for Vegetarians. I substituted Asiago in place of Swiss. Quick n Easy - Certainly worth trying!!

Absolutely delicious!  My husband and I will make this again and again.  My husband wasn't quite sure about the mayo/lemon juice/garlic condiment at first, but I convinced him to try it and we both just loved it.  A definite favorite.

This was great!  Made this along with french onion soup and everyone loved it. Only suggestion is I will s&p the veggies before roasting. I added less lemon juice to the sauce as suggested by others and let it chill in the fridge for a bit. The sauce is so simple but so good on this sandwich. Will definitely be making again!!

This recipe was great, especially for a recent vegetarian! I was really looking forward to the sauce but at the last minute realized I did not have any lemon. Next time I will make sure I have all ingredients. Regardless, this recipe is super yummy!

I wasn't sure about the asparagus part, but I was desperate to try something different. As it turns out, I LOVED it!! It's going to become a staple for me. I think everybody should give it a try. I used roast beef on my husband and son's since they are meat instead of veggie people. We were all happy!

I added roasted red bell pepper and extra minced garlic to the mayonnaise, was it saucy!!  Also added lettuce to the sandwich.  Whole family loved it, even my 5-year old!  Very easy to make, will make again.

Absolutely awesome! Really, an amazing sandwich, I just wish I could find more of these. No meat, yet I was completely satisfied with all of it. The "aioli" used in this recipe was definitely good, sure beats having to make it from scratch. Used provolone instead of swiss cheese. I also pulled a few leaves of fresh basil from my garden to add and used marinated red bell peppers I prepared a few days prior. When I have asparagus, this will definitely be the dish I'll be makin' first!

This was delicious and so filling. I used cheddar cheese instead since I don't like swiss and it was divine. We used these yummy fennel and pepper rolls from our supermarket and it was the perfect combo of flavors. We had some left over last night, so we had them again for lunch!

One of the best recipes I've tried on this site! And I don't even like tomato, and I've never tried asparagus.... so delicious. The sauce was very runny though *shrug* tasted good!

These are pretty good.  I found them to be a bit on the boring side though.  If I make these again, I will add some spices and herbs to jazz it up.

I added spinach and used mozzarella cheese instead. Also put some seasoned salt on the asparagus and red pepper as they cooked for more flavor! Used a whole wheat roll as well. I eyeballed the lemon but it really made the spread for me.  This turned out great!!
