I'm doing my holiday baking and my mom just reminded me on the phone, "Don't forget that mailman cookie!" This recipe is really easy to make and very tasty. It's a great cookie for people who don't like chocolate or are just plain tired of it.  A nice flavorful change from the standard holiday cookies.

These cookies were OK but they were missing something.  I might add lemon extract if I make them again

This is not just another oatmeal cookie!  I did not have raisins, so I used dried cherries.  This is a keeper.  Will definately make again.

Coconut, dates, nuts and oatmeal ~ great ingredients for a cookie.  These cookies start off  a little crunchie on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside.  After I put them in a container with a lid they lost a little of the crunchiness.  Still a very good cookie and I would make again.  Thanks Valarie for sharing your recipe.

These cookies were great.  I love to bake and I'm always looking for a new cookie recipe.  I make dozens and dozens of cookies at christmas to pass out to friends and family.  I try to switch up the recipes each year so they get something different.  They might just get these this year quite good.  All of my co-workers loved them when I took them in to work.  I did make some with the dates and some with raisins instead.  Very Good Thanks.

These cookies are REALLY good! Super easy and fun to make.  I was about 1/3 C short on brown sugar and used white sugar to make up the difference and they turned out good.  Used pecans instead of walnuts and they worked great!  It's a keeper!
