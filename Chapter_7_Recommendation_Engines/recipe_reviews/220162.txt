First of all, this would have to be made in a HUGE crockpot to get SIX breasts in. It was disappointing. In principle this is a good idea, but needs work. I made half the rice recipe with 4 breasts and they fit fine in my large size pot. The chicken turned out very bland. The breasts should be seasoned. At the end, I shredded the chicken and mixed everything together. I didn't use carrots because I am allergic, had I put them in this would have been even blander (and mushier). Also, the long grain and wild rice boxes have less than 1 cup mix so prepare to buy several to get the amount needed. The dish in general is NOT visually attractive. If you are looking to WOW guests, don't choose this one. I suppose it would be good to feed a large group of people but only fixing the flavor. I will mix in some light cream and Parmesan cheese to make it look like a risotto.

This cooked well (the chicken was moist & tender, the rice was cooked & had the right amount of moisture to it, the carrots were not mushy), but I personally did not like the taste of the rice, although normally I like wild rice.  My family was not enthused about this, either.  I used 2 boxes of wild rice & supplemented w/ 1 cup instant brown rice.  I think you could get by w/ 3 boxes of wild rice, though.  Also, I would omit the carrots, they don't add anything to the taste.  I think this would taste better made w/ plain rice.

Very disappointing.  I didn't read the other (few) reviews before making.  Thought the ingredients would make for a good basic dish that all in my family would like.  The only changes I made: used 2 large turkey breasts rather than the chicken breasts, and used vegetable broth instead of plain water.  Still, my 6qt crock pot was full to the brim.  I was hopeful as it cooked, but ended up disappointed in many ways.  The turkey was tender and tasted fine, actually did have a seasoned taste.  However, the overall dish did not look appetizing and was certainly not satisfying.... and my family loves both rice and carrots.  The rice was just rather strange tasting and the bottom was overcooked, some of it burnt.  The carrots seemed out of place, adding nothing to the dish.  In hindsight, I'd prefer to cook the meat in the crock pot and prepare the rice and carrots separately.  I think all would turn out better that way and look vastly more appealing.

I used 4 huge chicken breasts, cut into 8, used the carrots and it all fit perfectly. I used one can of crm of mushroom and two of the crm of chicken.   So yes, I added some ground black pepper...added a little Kosher salt.  Works very well.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

I followed this recipe, thinking that my slow cooker was adequate. Wrong. You need something larger than a 2.5 quart cooker for this. The meal overflowed my cooker during cooking and pushed a generous portion of liquid out. The chicken didn't cook thoroughly, and I had to finish it in a skillet. Mechanical errors, nothing more. The food itself was good, but needed a little help. I tossed in a packet of onion soup mix, and it seasoned it nicely.

It was good. I used wild rice mix (4boxes) and 3 chicken breast, everything else i followed direction. I agree with other, carrots aren't really necessary. I think I'll try adding some onion and bell peppers next time.

Ok, next time I will read reviews instead of going "wow, I have all the ingredients". This was terrible and yes I did use Uncle Ben's Wild Rice - one with flavoring. For one thing the rice came out pasty and extremely bland. I thought seriously about adding ingredients but decided to stick the recipe. mistake!

I made this last night.  I added a package of sliced baby Bella mushrooms, and some chopped onions.  I also replaced one of the cans of soup with Cream of Mushroom Soup just for some contrast.  It made a lot, and was really yummy!  My husband took leftovers for lunch today, and I had it for lunch today, too!  Will DEFINITELY make this again!

I followed to the letter, and reviews I read, beforehand  were right! This slow and low cook made the rice a mush mess! Should have cooked separately.

No changes, it was delicious. I made the entire recipe, which was unfortunate. I live alone and it was entirely too much. I had to freeze some.

Rice is not meant to cook in the crockpot. Way over done. Next time I will cook the chicken and carrots in the crockpot but the rice separate.

Tasteless!!  And had I not added a container of chicken broth, would have been a gelatinous blob.

I used frozen chicken breasts and it worked great. I was able to stir half way thru cooking which made a huge difference.  I only had one box Uncle Bens wild rice, so used 2 more cups brown rice. Worked great.  Added chicken bouillon to the water and chicken seasonings as well as garlic and onion powder.   Everyone liked it.  But we had enough for 3days, so I will put more veggies in next time, and maybe reduce the rice.

Love the taste and moisture in the chicken but the rice was way too much
