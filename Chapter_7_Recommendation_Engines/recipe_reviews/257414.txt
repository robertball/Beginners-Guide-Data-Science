These were pretty good, but even if I had enough chocolate to do the outside coating, I don't think I would have had enough (I only had 1 & 1/4 C chocolate chips, but 1 & 1/2 C was called for). Out of the 22 dough balls this recipe made, only half were coated with the amount of chocolate I had, so try using 1 & 3/4-2C for the coating. I didn't have any white chocolate to drizzle on top. I also wish the recipe indicates how many balls this would make. It says 15 servings... (I'm guessing 2 each=a serving), but I made 22 using a cookie scoop. I would make these again for an event, but would increase the chocolate coating... and thin it out better (I did add a touch of EVOO but the chocolate was still thick).

It was good! I would leave out the coating or leave out the chocolate chips in the dough because the chocolate chip flavor is a bit overpowering. Will definitely make again!
