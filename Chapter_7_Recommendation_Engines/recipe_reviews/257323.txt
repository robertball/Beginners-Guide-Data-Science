I don t usually make unrated recipes but I thought I d give it a try since I had some prosciutto and fresh asparagus. It was good! I made a few adjustments. Substituted cheddar for provolone since that s what I had. Added little salt and pepper before the herbs. Getting everything wrapped was a little awkward but not impossible. I would probably make this again. I think you could make a number of substitutions depending on what you had in the fridge.

This was a simple and very good recipe. I did it exactly as specified except that I used parchment paper instead of spraying the cooking sheet.
