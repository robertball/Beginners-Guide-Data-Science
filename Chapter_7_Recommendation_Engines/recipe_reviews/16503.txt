I have been making this for years , but I do mine in the frying pan and I add ground beef and cumin and garlic for more flavor.  Then I eat it with tortillas.

Super easy, and was a hit for my family. I used canned, diced tomatoes that were seasoned with Italian herbs.  I also sprinkled some extra herbs on tob, and added mushrooms.  Great taste!

Mine needed a lot more than 20 minutes.  I had an 8x8 inch pan.  I did like it and will make it again.  It was better as leftovers!!  Next time I will put the cheese on 10 minutes or so before it is done.  Maybe because I had to cook it longer the cheese got kind of stringy.

I saute the onions first and partially cook the zucchini on the stovetop or in the microwave until slightly tender. I use fresh tomatoes. Layer the zucchini, onions, tomatoes adding salt and pepper on the onion layer. Then put in the oven uncovered for 20 min. adding the cheese the last 5 min. Delicious!

This recipe is excellent to use all those 
extra tomato and zucchinis from the 
garden.  I sprinkle italian herbs over 
top of the veggies before adding the
cheese.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Modified it a bit by adding 3 cloves of minced garlic, seasoned tomatoes, italian seasoning and a dash of cajun seasoning.  My cooking time took longer, but it may have been the amount of zucchini.  Put cheese on last 5 minutes to just melt.  Yummy!

This was a pretty good side dish. It served 5 of us as a side. I layered the zucchini and onions then added the tomatoes on top. I would recommend draining the tomatoes because it had a lot of liquid in it by the time it was done cooking. I used canned tomatoes with basil, garlic and oregano. And used provolone cheese, its what I had on hand. Thanks for the recipe.

I had to cook it for about 40 minutes, because the zuchinni in the center wasn't becoming tender. Not much flavor. I added butter, garlic salt, and a dash of Lawry's seasoned salt

I made this for my husband and I.  We didn't really enjoy it.  There wasn't much flavor.  I could have used the zucchini in a much better recipe.

As is it lacks flavor. My version is to use mexi or italian herbed canned tomatoes and mozzerella cheese. Both are very good but I prefer the spicy one.I dont normally use onions in this unless I carmelize them first.If you do this in a pan and get it all(Zuke too)browned a bit it has more flavor. Then top with cheese and broil til brown and bubbly.Yum!

I have made this several times and really enjoyed it. I do have to bump up the cooking time and I add extra seasonings that I enjoy to it. Overall it's really a very easy and yummy recipe!

This recipe had no flavor, I even added minced garlic to it and that did not help.  I also had to bake it longer than 20 minutes.  I know I will not be making this dish again.

I made this tonight.  I read others review a used the Italian diced tomatoes.  This was tasty however I would drain the tomatoes next time.  I added the cheese for the last 10 minutes as others suggested with the lid off.  add italian seasoning to your zucchini/onion mixture and drain the tomatoes and it is good.

I sautee the onion first along with a clove or two of minced garlic. I also increased the cheese to 3/4 cup and added crumbled bacon. OMG! So good.

Fabulous- Build like lasagne, sprinkle with the onions, season and sprinkle with parmesan, layer by layer; the top layer is complete after straining the juice from seasoned diced tomatoes and dividing over top, there is lots of cheese and my additional touch- seasoned bread crumbs

I used red onion and fresh tomatoes (with the juices and seeds) and a bit of vegetable juice because I didn't have canned tomatoes. I added garlic powder, anchovy paste and a dash of cayenne for a kick of flavor. Then I threw in some fresh basil because its the last growth of the season on my plant. I was out of cheese but didn't want it anyway, turned out pretty good! Great way to use up vegetables!

I made this exactly as the recipe says (minus having a lid on... I don't own an oven-safe baking dish with a lid).

As a few people mentioned, it came out watery (from the juices of the can). Not too much flavor, but the dish overall seems to have potential (adding in your own seasonings: just read some of the other reviews).

This would be a good dish if someone is passionate about food and wanted to create something "new". I just wanted a quick healthy meal.
I feel like if I added more cheese, I would like it better (but kinda defeats the whole thing of being healthy).
The cheese seemed to have gotten lost in my dish (as in its flavor). I wonder if it would've tasted better had I added the cheese 5 min before it was done.
Def. going to put more cheese when I have the leftover later.

If this recipe was altered (like what some other people have done), I would've probably rated it higher as it would've had more flavor.

I followed  the recipe except I used stewed tomatoes and added Italian seasoning and garlic powder on top. I covered and baked 35 minutes. It was good and didn't take long to make. I will make it again.

Very good. I used a 10 oz can of Mexican tomatoes cuz that’s all I had. Then added a little water and 3 Tbs of tomato paste. I sautéed the onions first, as someone recommended. We are vegan so I used vegan Mexican cheese on top, added the the last 5 minutes and it did take 45 overall.

I used one large zucchini and 2 cups of cheese. Wished my dish was more spread out. The bowl shape required 5 min. more of cook time. I'll try again with some added meat or mushrooms. I didn't feel like the onions were cooked enough.

Watery and bland.  I love zucchini and couldn't even finish this.  Will not make again.
