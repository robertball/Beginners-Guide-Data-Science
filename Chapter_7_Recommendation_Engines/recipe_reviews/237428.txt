This is a great opportunity to make a tasty and healthy dinner. candidly, I omitted the brown sugar. it was a tremendous hit. next time I will serve with either rice or roasted potatoes.

I agree with those who thought there was too much onion. I kinda think there was too much tomato as well. I made this to serve two, using 2 1/2 onions and 2 tomatoes. My husband was leary at first
about cooking all the ingredients together, so I baked the fish on a parchment lined sheet along side the vegies.  When I served it, I put a layer of brown rice on the plate, and the fish and vegies on top of that. My husband and I were both in agreement that the recipe is a keeper.  Next time I will use a little less onion and tomato, and maybe cut the onion into smaller sections because some of the onion was not sufficiently tender. I'm glad I have found a recipe that doesn't drown the fish in some canned cream soup!

This was delicious!! The hake was perfectly cooked and the flavors were great. Admittedly, I used red wine instead of white, and added some salt and pepper before topping with the brown sugar. And used a healthy amount of basil. The only thing was that it was just a LOT of onion for the amount of fish. You could either cut the onions/tomatoes in half, or add more fish. We have enough veggies left over for at least 3 or 4 more servings.

This was my first time cooking hake. It came out OK because I hear there is a fine line between cooked and over cooked with this fishand I may have cooked it too long. The recipe is simple and the results are a healthy dinner albeit a little bland.
