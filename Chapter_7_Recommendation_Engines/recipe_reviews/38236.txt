This ice cream was delicious.  I liked that there are no eggs and no cooking required.  All you do is dump your ingredients together and let your ice cream maker do the rest.  I added 1 cup of sugar and found it to be too sweet; half a cup is plenty.  One word of caution: if you cut your peaches instead of puree them, your ice cream maker may "freeze up" as the chunks block the paddle from churning.  If you like little peach chunks, puree about 3/4 of the peaches and chop the rest.

This was very good ice cream and very easy to make. I used 4 15 oz. cans of sliced peaches in lite syrup (draining the syrup) instead of fresh peaches. I also opted to use more sugar (1 cup). I put everything in the blender to mix it well and to puree the peaches. I will make this again.

I made this ice cream for a family gathering.  Everyone loved it.  I used fat free half and half and 1% milk.  I also used the full cup of sugar.  Next time I may try using fat free condensed milk.  Or maybe not, since this combination was so good.

This is an outstanding recipe!  Very easy to make!  The only thing missing is salt!  One should always lightly salt an ice cream to bring out the flavor!  1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon.  I found it rather funny the handful of reviewers who indicated that this recipe didn't have any flavor.  If your ice cream doesn't have any flavor the peaches you used were junk!  Probably store bought, pick green weeks ago, no aroma, no flavor, shipped hundreds, if not thousands of miles, mass produced junk!  When you're searching for the right peach, pick it up, hold it to your nose and sniff.  If there is an excellent peach aroma that makes your mouth water, that peach will be good to eat or use in ice cream, or a baked good.  If you smell little or nothing, the peach is junk and you might as well just use canned.

This is a very solid recipe for any ice cream. I omitted the evaporated milk but only because I ran out of room in my ice cream maker. I have made this recipe with strawberries and coconut now and both were excellent.

This tastes like summer!  We used the old fashioned gallon ice cream machine.  To trim the fat we used fat free condensed milk and evaporated milk. We used the full cup of sugar and added 3 cups of whole milk.  Also we didn't puree the peaches, just left them in small chunks-- it makes the ice cream more fun to eat.

This is a wonderful recipe-a little expensive to make, but well worth the extra expense.  I bought the 10 peaches, but it was more than needed.  I think about 6 or 7 would have been plenty.  The leftovers froze really well and did not become "icy"-just as good!  Thanks for a new recipe.

I made this recipe with no-fat 1/2 and 1/2 and low-fat sweetened condensed milk, so in all fairness, I changed these two items, but would it affect the taste that much? I don't think so. Texture was good, color was dirty, not much taste, more sugar would have helped. We were so disappointed in the taste, it just had none.

This recipe was so easy. I had to take something
to a picnic and was tired of taking the same old
thing so I decided to make ice cream and surprise
everyone. Everyone loved it and even came back
for seconds. I would make it again.

Super easy ice cream recipe!  Just got a new machine (one that does NOT need ice and salt, hallelujah!) and this was the very first recipe I tried.  It couldn't be easier....the most time consuming part was peeling and pitting and dicing the peaches.  You could easily turn this into any flavor by using different fruits or extracts.  My only thought is that after the ice cream froze in my freezer, the next day, it was not as creamy as maybe an egg based custard ice cream would be....it was a bit "icy" when first taken out, and then a bit "watery" the parts that started to melt.  But for a quick, easy ice cream, this one is definately a winner, especially if you are going to eat it that first day.  By the way, this recipe makes a gallon of ice cream, my machine I found out will only hold a half gallon, so I stored the other half in a container in the fridge and made it the next day.

Mmmm this was great and easy, thanks! I made it a nice light peach color by adding 2 drops red and 6 drops yellow food coloring before freezing.

Wonderful! So simple and delicious! I used 4 LARGE peaches (blanched them in boiling water then transferred to an ice bath - the skin peels right off) and 1 cup of sugar. I was happy to find the recipe didn't call for raw eggs - that always makes me uncomfortable! Will definitely make again, and may try changing up the main flavor ingredient as I bet this makes a perfect base for other flavors!

easy and adaptable, I used drained canned peaches, 2 28 oz cans pulsed in the processor.  Pure Madasgascar Bourbon Vanilla & a pinch of salt sealed the deal.  Perfection!!

Not my favorite peach ice cream recipe, the texture was somewhat off and the flavor just wasn't very peachy -- and the peaches we used were excellent and juicy.  It might have been better with a full cup of sugar?

I loved this! my ice cream maker is small, and I ended up not adding any milk at the end ( just the evaporated milk and sweetened condensed milks) I had very ripe peaches so I just mushed them up well and left some chunks. I think the flavor was great- the additional milk seems like it would dilute it too much for me! Am buying more peaches tomorrow to make more!

Delicious!  I had a hankering for peach ice cream.  Started this recipe but discovered that the kids had eaten some of my peaches!  I had two ripe mangos so I completed the 2 1/2 lbs needed with chopped up mangos and it was to die for!  I followed the recipe exactly other than adding the mangos, everyone loved it.  Definitely a keeper.

The only error you can make when making this ice cream is not using ripe soft peaches.  If when you pick up a peach and put it a few inches from you nose and you can't smell instant peach goodness, it means your peaches aren't ripe.  This recipe was awesome and I'm so happy to know you can make an awesome ice cream without eggs!  Yay!

Really good.  I followed the recipe with everything but the milk, I mixed everything together (I had ommited the peaches though) in the mixer, except the milk, poured it in the container, and then added the rest of my whipping cream, and whole milk up to the max. fill line.  After it was done being made, I froze it longer, because reagular ice cream makers, you know never get it like store bought ice cream does, a little slushy, so popped it back in the freezer for another 10-15 min.

My hubby loved this ice cream! We had a huge box of peaches and ice cream just sounded good, so I pulled out the ice cream maker and whipped up a batch. I followed the recipe completely other than I cut it in half which filled two, 2 pint containers. YUM!! Very light and refreshing without being to sweet. I did not add the extra sugar and it was fine :)

This was the first time I'd made this kind, I'd changed it a little by adding a quart of half and half and omitted the whole milk completly to give it a creamier taste and I'd also added a cup of sugar instead of a half of cup, tasted wonderful! Winning reviews at Church!

This ice cream is absolutely one of the best homemade varieties I've ever tried.  Every year when we travel through Georgia, we stop at a peach plant off the interstate to buy tons of fresh peaches to bring home - and this ice cream is almost identical to the one they make at their cafe.  The only changes I made were that I used fat free for the 2 canned milks and 1 % milk not whole - all to cut down on the fat content.  The batch froze extremely well in our home machine.  We made it twice in one week it was so popular with friends and family while our peaches were still fresh!!

Very Good!  Next time I might use a little more sugar and I was hoping for a little more peach flavor but we solved that by using canned peach preserves and whipped cream for topping.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Not bad! Than again I dont have that much experience in homemaking ice cream. I used 4 cups of chopped drained canned peach slices. I like how easy it is, I'm not too crazy about cooking the ice cream base before putting it in the ice cream maker.

This ice cream was INCREDIBLE. So creamy and just the right amount of sweetness and peach...I took others suggestions and added 1 c. of sugar...and I don't think it would have been sweet enough without it. Yum!!

This was nice and easy to make and tasted amazing. However, I'm not sure if my ice cream maker is smaller than it is supposed to be or not, because I didn't need to add any milk to the ice cream....

I added a full cup of sugar as others recommended but was very disappointed anyway. I can't decide if it was the evaporated milk or what but something is very off with the flavor. Sorry to have wasted the peaches which were sooo good. The texture wasn't any too good but that probably comes from my ice cream maker novice status. I will try it in smoothies to keep from wasting the ingredients.

This was so yummy!! I used a 28 oz. Can of peaches that I pureed and 5 ripe peaches that I chopped. I also didn't need the milk, which I was planning on just using extra half and half if I did, because I thought maybe that was why some people said it was "icy".  Thank you for sharing this recipe.....it was the first time I made ice cream and it was perfect:-)

I tried this recipe because of the high reviews, but was very disappointed.  Granted, it was a simple, inexpensive recipe compared to the cooked custard peach ice cream I usually make, but the end product was "icy" and not at all creamy.  Next time around I might modify it by adding a couple of eggs and cooking up a light custard with the milk/cream mixture (decreasing milk to offset the egg addition).

This was delicious.  I followed the directions exactly, but it makes a lot.  Next time, I might half the recipe.   I didn't puree all of the peaches.  I left some chunks, which worked out well.

Excellent recipe.  Make the ice cream with no changes.  Easy, fast freezing time.  Great as soft serve consistency and even better after it spent some time in the freezer.  Recommended.

It's great but I doubled the sugar and vanilla that the recipe called for.. It was a hit with everyone, but next time I will chop have the peaches and purée the other half.

Very good recipe!  My peaches were not ripe enough, so I cooked them a bit to bring out the sweetness.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written.  It was a hit on the 4th!

Very good. Once it is frozen it is not too sweet at all. Omit the peaches and this is a pretty good base. I might try adding 1/4 - 1/2 cup more sugar next time to make it a little sweeter.

This was very easy to make. It took me about 8 hours to freeze to my taste.  I used regular ice cream containers that I had saved so that might have been why it took so long, otherwise the ice cream would have been runny.
The taste was great and not as sweet as regular ice cream and goes great with a warm peach cobler!! Great recipe, thanks so much for sharing. I might try it with strawberries, yummy!

Quite good ,if you like peaches don't blend themto the point of having pureed peaches. Pulse the peaches with the blender so you get some good chunky bites of the fruit and add that to the cream mix.

Good start, but I would make some adjustments if I make this again. The ice cream was a little thinner than I was used to, so I'd try using heavy cream instead of half and half. I'd also like a more peach-forward flavor. I blended three large peaches and chopped a fourth one to add some chunks (don't add these until the end). Next time, I will leave slightly larger chunks of peach to add in, but I might also add an extra peach to the mix. But because peaches are so high in liquid, I might cut down on the milk to compensate. This is a great recipe, and I'd like to see it a little thicker and a little peachier.

This recipe tasted like sweetened condensed milk and nothing else, in our opinion. We felt like the ice cream had no taste. I doubled the sugar, but kept the recipe the same otherwise.

This recipe was delicious! I liked it because you do not use eggs. I followed the recipe exactly except I did chopped up a few peaches, extra fine to get that  peach bite. It was plenty sweet enough with the sugar and condense milk.

Add a half cup of sugar and a few more peaches for a richer, sweeter flavor.

Very good ice cream. I did add 1 cup of sugar; am glad I did because it wouldn’t have been sweet enough with just 1/2 cup. I puréed the peaches, but I will not purée them all next time as I like bits of the fruit in the ice cream. It was as if I had put in peach flavoring. I will take one person’s advice that rated this and only purée part of the peaches before adding.

I used canned peaches for quickness sake, but would definitely use fresh ripe peaches next time. The canned peaches didn’t lend enough flavor to the ice cream.  But it was still delicious!

If you have never had homemade ice cream you might think this is good.  It's not bad, just not as good as I was hoping.  The finished product needs to be sweeter and the airy consistency of the ice cream left me wanting eggs in my next ice cream adventure.

Rather good. I did combine the peaches and sugar the night before and allowed to sit in the freezer. This allowed the peaches to become quite sweet.

I liked this recipe; however, I added 1/4 cup more sugar, for a total of 3/4 cup.  The amount you use may depend on the sweetness of the peaches.  Taste test for yourself.  I also followed someone's recommendation and added 1/4 tsp. of kosher salt.  Next time, I think I will reduce the evap and increase the half and half.  I am not a fan of the taste of evaporated milk.  I pureed the peach mixture in the blender in batches, leaving the last batch a little coarser for texture, and used a one-gallon electric ice cream churn with ice and rock salt to freeze the the mix.  Even allowing for blanching, cooling, and peeling the fresh peaches, this was quick and easy to make.  It can also be done in stages if you are short for time.

I really like this recipe! Living in Savannah, GA is the BEST place to be for GREAT,FRESH peaches!  I followed the recipe as written, however, I felt like it should have been just a little bit sweeter.  Not overpowering, but maybe a few Tbsp. more.  Other than that, I think it was a good recipe!

The only thing that I did differently is I substituted more 1/2 and 1/2  and whole milk for the evaporated milk since I didn't have any.  It was absolutely delicious.  I gave the recipe 4 stars because it wasn't creamy after it was frozen.  Maybe it has to be a custard to be creamier.  Also I used white peaches which were so flavorful! and just made this a hit for our Memorial Day!

My only changes were using less sugar (since peaches were very sweet) and using fat-free condensed milk, fat free pet milk and fat-free cream.  This ice cream was absolutely fabulous!!

The flavor is great!  But mine did not freeze in the ice cream maker.  I stuck it in the freezer and we ate it a few hours later.  It did not have the wonderful, creamy texture of ice cream.  But we'll it all of it cause it tastes terrific!

I used whipping cream instead of the half and half. It turned out to be a little more creamy. the fresh peaches really made a difference. I made sure the peaches were good and ripe. Got all raves when  served.

I have been dying to make homemade peach ice cream for years!  So glad I went with this recipe. Absolutely delicious. I did purée most of the peaches and left a few small chunks. Wish I puréed all. Didn't like the texture of the chunks. First taste out of the maker...I was worries it wasn't sweet enough. But after freezing it for hours....it was perfection.

Super easy recipe..  most recipes I have seen have eggs, this one didn't, which is nice.

I added more sugar and substituted the half and half milk with heavy cream.  I only added half of the pint of heavy cream, then I added a touch of whole milk to make up for the amount needed from what was called for from the half and half.

turned out super delicious and sweet.  It took 3 hours in my electric ice cream maker.

The taste was wonderful but it was grainy, was almost like sherbet instead of ice cream.  About the only thing it will be good for is to make milkshakes.

I love how simple this recipe is.  It was my first time making peach ice cream.  I'm thinking that  I may add a little more sugar next time.  I will be making this revipe again!

Good!  Used frozen peaches (made it in December) and I should have not processed them quite so much....I think some peachy "chunks" would have made it better.  I have a standard size ice cream maker and it almost overflowed without me adding ANY whole milk!  And I only used 2 lbs of peaches....so next time I will probably use 1 3/4 lbs and lessen the half and half.  Not super sweet which was how we liked it.

Next time I make it I will definatately put more than 1/2 cup sugar.  It was very bland tasting to me and my family.
