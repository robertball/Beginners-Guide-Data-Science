YYYUUMM!!  I cut the recipe in half, subbed 1 tsp of garlic powder & 1/4 tsp salt for the garlic salt, it was perfect!  My 11 year old son told me that it was the best garlic bread he ever had!  Next time I will sprinkle the paprika on top instead of mixing it in, like my mom used to!  Thanks Denyse!!

I’m updating my previous review. This has always been a great recipe recipe for me.  I use it often and am using it again today for garlic bread.  This recipe works so well with mashed potatoes, etc. and sautéed vegetables.  I will never lose this recipe and I’ve been using it since 2002.

This flavorful butter goes with so many things it would be impossible to list them all.  I make up triple batches, making them into logs and freezing them.  That way they are on hand at a moments notice to put on fish, slip under the skin of chicken, or melt over a New York strip steak.

I read the other reviews so I figured I was safe in adding a TSP of garlic salt rather than a TBSP. It was still SUPER salty and next time I won't add ANY. The original poster must have used unsalted butter or have no taste buds. I used it to make shrimp and they were edible but I would have liked them HALF as salty. Other than that it tasted really good so it was quite unfortunate. I will give it a try with no added salt at all (garlic powder instead) or unsalted butter next time for sure.

I did not use the whole tablespoon of garlic salt--what I did was use a teaspoon of garlic salt and added in two teaspoons of garlic powder (three teaspoons equal one tablespoon). Other than that, I kept to the recipe. I used this as a schmear on the outside of bread to make Italian Grilled Cheese Sandwiches. The family loved it.

This mixture is DELICIOUS.
I used fresh garlic (not out of the jar!) half  of the butter but all of the other ingredients in amounts as as listed.   Emeril's Italian Essence, Lawry's Seasoned Pepper, Granulated Garlic, just a teensy bit of salt and sprinkled the Paprika on top of my pre-toasted, butter spread Italian Bread. I do believe this made for the best we've had at home in quite awhile. Going to be keeping the mixture in the fridge to try on potatoes and other things... Thanks, Denyse!

This is great on garlic bread!  I didn't have garlic salt which was probably good after reading the reviews, so I used 1 tsp. of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. of salt.  Other than that I didn't change a thing.  I spread this over half a loaf of italian bread and baked it at 425 for 10-12 minutes.  I'd love to try this over steak next time.

I made a mistake with this recipe by using the entire tablespoon of garlic salt before tasting it.  Next time I make I will add the garlic salt a little at a time, it was too salty to make garlic bread with.  Although, I did use some on a baked potato today for lunch and it was great that way.

I used margarine and thought the 1 tbsp garlic salt made it way too salty so I cut down to 1 tsp the next time. Much better. I didn't have italian seasoning so I used what I had on hand - 1/4 tsp each of dried basil, oregano and thyme, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Superb.

Oh my gosh, I will use this on everything but my morning cereal!  This makes the best garlic bread.  For the italian seasoning I used Emeril's Italian Essence.  Very easy and super tasty.

We enjoyed this on our focaccia bread, but got THE BREATH from so much garlic!  I think what I would like to do is to leave out the garlic salt, add no extra salt, and increase the amount of parmesan cheese (salty enough) to about 3/4 cup.  Instead of Italian seasoning, I like to add basil, thyme, oregano and parsley flakes to taste.  We will continue to enjoy this one!

Denyse, thank you.  Garlic Butter is such a basic item that you wouldn't think a recipe would be needed, but I never seem to get it "just right".  This recipe is SPLENDID!  I'm not a fan of Parmesan, so I omitted that and substituted 1 t. onion powder.  I followed the other's suggestions re: salt and used 1/2 T. garlic salt and 1/2 T. garlic powder.  It turned out GREAT.  I cut open a medium sized loaf of Italian bread and spread a nice layer on the each face, popped it into a 450d oven for about 10 min. and enjoyed one of the best garlic breads ever with some spicy tomato soup.  I still have a nice little tub left in the fridge and can't wait to try it on some pasta or some nice seafood.  Great job!

I have been making this for years. I buy the soft butter in the tub, it is about 15 oz. I take it out of the tub and put it into a bowl. Then I add Italian seasoning, garlic powder, minced garlic packed in water (mash out the water) if you choose to use salt then make it garlic salt. I use Lawry's garlic salt with parsley. It has a green cap. I buy it in a big container at Costco. If you don't want to use salt then use garlic powder. I mix all the ingred. to my taste then I put it back in the original container mark it garlic butter and put back in the frig. I use it for everything. It stays nice and soft so you can use it easily.

I followed most peoples' tips and used garlic powder and a little salt because I don;t keep garlic salt in the house.  I was out of butter and used stick " I can't believe it's not butter" margarine and it turned out just great !!!!  Next time I'll use real butter although, quite frankly, you couldn't tell the difference with all of those yummy ingrdients.  I'ved used this to top fresh grilled steaks too - WOW !!!!

Love, love, love this garlic butter.  I follow the recipe except for the salt.  For that, I just eyeball how much looks right for the amount of butter, then add more to taste if necessary.  But you can pretty much eyeball any of the ingredients, as it is a basic recipe that can be easily adjusted to personal preference.  I first made this to use with baked potatoes, though it is good on anything.  I served it on Christmas with mini-ciabatta rolls and called it "Herbed Butter".  I also used it to saute broccoli on Christmas.  People raved.  Tonight I made the best spinach I have ever tasted (and I eat spinach regularly) by just putting this butter in the pan and adding spinach and salt.  My husband loved it so much that he ate his entire portion at the counter before serving himself any other food or even getting a utensil.  That's right, he ate it with his hands!  And he is a major meat-eater, seeing veggies as completely optional in a meal.  Anyway, preparing this butter and keeping in on hand is like having a way to instantly season pretty much anything, so it makes cooking so much faster!  I'm a huge popcorn fan and lately, I've been drizzling this on my popcorn.  I also rub it on chicken breasts before baking them and voila!  Love, love, love it!

I make this butter in bulk for parties where I'm serving a vegetable medley.  It gives the veggies a little something extra rather than just serving steamed.  I roll in plastic wrap, chill, then slice rounds into steamed veggies to season.  Extra's can go on garlic bread... or whatever!!  Great basic!

After reading a few reviews I decided to try it and well I didn't have any garlic salt so I didn't have to worry, all I did was add a little more garlic. Tastes very good. If your hesitant just don't add the garlic salt.

Fabulous! I followed the recipe exactly and this was a hit. A local restaurant serves a butter mixture like this with hot rolls; however, they melt it and drizzle it on a plate then put the rolls right in the melted butter. I might try doing the same with with recipe. Yummy!

WAY to much salt. Cut the salt in half(more possibly). Tastes just like the garlic butter I make, but ALOT more salt.

I could live on garlic! This is coming from a gal who at the age of three, her "Oma" would butter a slice of russian rye and mince fresh garlic on top. I would come home from a weekend at her house and my entire family would run the other way! This is excellent, however, I used garlic powder in lieu of the garlic salt. Really good job Denyse!!!!

I make this all the time, only I omit the garlic salt and the paprika. I slice a loaf of French Bread lengthwise and spread both halves with the garlic butter then top with shredded Italian blend cheese and wrap it all in tin foil and pop it in a 300 degree oven for about 15 minutes. It's quick, so simple and delicious!

This recipe could be the best garlic butter recipe I have ever had, if one simple modification was made. I use the same measurements for everything listed here EXCEPT for the amount of butter I use. I double the butter. So I use 2 cups instead of just 1. This makes the garlic butter not so strong, and I can apply it directly to things such french bread, or use it as a spread, or however I choose to use it. Nothing else as of yet has compared.

I am actually re-reviewing this recipe since I had to change servers, screen names, etc. and I decided that using margarine is no different than butter ( I was Mrshiggmed before in an old review )  I did try it with butter, half butter - half margerine - to be honest with you unless you are a real purirst you cannot tell the diffrence using it on bread, veggies, steak - whatever.  The only thng I have changed is I don't bother with any kind of salt - garlic or regular anymore since the Parmesan chese is salty enough.  This  recipe has been passed along to all of the office crew, neighbors - you name it  !!!!!! Make a batch and freeze one in a log to slap on top of anything at the last minute for a real treat.  Thanks so much Denyse -- you have a winner here !!!!!!!!!

This stuff is great.  The only thing I did differently is to diminish the amount of salt a bit.  I can't wait to use this again.

Good Recipe.  I measured my ingredients free hand and spread this over a french baguette for garlic bread.  I used garlic powder and no garlic salt (didn't have any). Made this along with the Artichoke and Spinach Lasagna on this site.  What a grand meal. Thanks for submitting this Denyse.

I make this, and keep on hand at all times!!!  I too cut down on the salt as I use salted butter.  About the only difference I do is I use roasted garlic, because I dearly love the sweetness the roasting releases, it gives a little different taste---try it!  Thanks Denynce!!!

I read through several reviews and was concerned about saltiness. I customized this a bit by using 1+1/2 tbsp minced garlic (which I sauteed for about two minues), no paprika, and subbing Garlic & Herb Mrs. Dash for the garlic salt. I also added a touch more Italian seasoning than called for because I was using this on a noodle side dish. I used an electric mixer to evenly distribute the ingredients in the butter. Complete hit with my modifications!

Excellent garlic butter if you use only 1 t garlic powder, 1/2 t salt and 1/4 t fresh ground pepper in place of the garlic salt it calls for. The amount of garlic salt posted in the recipe will make the butter way too salty, otherwise the recipe is absolutely perfect! The absolute BEST garlic butter I have ever tasted! I'm giving it 4 stars for the amount of garlic salt it states, but with the small adjustment it definitely is a 5 star recipe! (I've used it on toasted bread, sauteed shrimp, melted and brushed onto soft bread sticks, stirred into mashed potatoes, and even on top of pizza! The choices are endless for the use of this garlic butter!)

This recipe was extremely salty. I believe you could omit the garlic salt altogether, especially if you're using salted butter. Even if you were to use unsalted butter, you still would not need a tablespoon of garlic salt. I won't be using this recipe again.

I made these, spread them on wheat bread and toasted it, then cut them up in small pieces for my salad. They turned out GREAT! A few days later when I wanted to get some on my toast, they were already gone! That good.

I wasf looking for a recipe for Garlic Bread when I found this recipe.
Many of the earlier reviews described this Garlic Butter as too salty. But many of them said that they used salted butter instead of sweet unsalted butter. I always use sweet butter for cooking and thought I would be okay with this recipe.
I was wrong!
Even with the sweet unsalted butter this was way too salty for Garlic Bread. I suspect it may be okay as a butter for vegetables or perhaps grilled steak.
I will try this recipe again but I will use Garlic Powder or possibly Granulated Garlic instead of the Garlic Salt.

Wow, I  made this tonight and it was unbelievably delicious on crusty French bread.   I read another review that said it is too salty but I always salt to taste rather than measure.   Instead of Italian seasoning I used Mccormick's De Herbes  Provence mixture,  and I added touch of sugar.   Still I give the recipes all the credit. I have to change things but I need a place to start.   I will make this regularly.  Thank you!

I made this but only after reading most of the reviews..So glad I did..I took Sarah Jo's recommendation of using only 1 tsp of garlic salt and 2 tsp of garlic powder..(Instead of the 1 tbsp of garlic salt) It would have been way too salty had I not... I also added 1 tsp of parsley flakes to this .....LOVED IT!!! DELISH!!

Actually, you can make it a bit tastier by adding some pesto. It gives colour and extra tang to it ;-) Try it, it is fantastic :-)

I didn't use the garlic salt at all because I don't use salt very much, if at all. It is excellent on garlic toast and for sauteing meat. I might add an extra spice or two next time just to see what it's like.

I've made this garlic butter many times and I will never go back to store bought garlic bread again.  I love to use Texas Toast style bread but plain ole white bread is delicious too. Make sure and really slather it on all the way to the edge of the crust. YUM.

First, use FAR more garlic than what is called for here. I use 3 to 4 large Elephant Garlic cloves. After all, it is called GARLIC BUTTER. ;°) Use only real Salted (high end) Butter & along with (to taste) dried Chives add Onion Powder, Cracked Pepper, (10 twists or more. personally, i use 20 for that incredible steakhouse cracked pepper taste) 1/2 tsp. Italian Seasoning and dried Parsley. Allow butter to cool slightly & place on cling wrap in a bowl. When butter starts to cool & thicken, roll it up in cling wrap and form an elongated, square/round mold. When ready to use, slice generous 1" pats & place on your sizzling steaks! The garlic & chive flavor should be the predominate flavors in this butter! This butter also testes great in Corn In The Cob and Baked Potatoes!

Taste before you add the garlic salt to determine if you just need to add more garlic powder, or if you actually need garlic and salt. Follow that advice and you will love this recipe :)

So good! I made as pretty much as written however I used garlic powder & less than a tsp. of sea salt (I was using salted butter). I used Penzey's Tuscan Sunset as the Italian seasoning and freshly grated Parm. I let it rest an hour for the flavors to meld. We used on grilled French bread and added a tad to our grilled steak as well. Yum! I'll never be making plain ol' garlic butter again. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe is to die for.  I used margarine the first time I made it because I was out of butter and too lazy to leave the house.  With all of the other ingredients you can't tell the difference.  I left out the garlic salt.  Instead of mincing the garlic I just put 3 cloves through my Mouli.  I keep a container of this is the freezer.  You can just whack off a piece for topping veggies or whatever.  You have to try this one!

Turned out pretty good! When reading reviews about it being too salty, I was sure they were just wimps! I am friends with salt, usually...but it was pretty salty. I will try to use less garlic salt next time. It was edible and still pretty tasty, but yes. VERY salty.

Simple, easy, and effective. The Italian seasoning is what we found sets this recipe apart from other garlic butter recipes, it's delicious on toast, making a sort of 'garlic bread', and if thickened, I thought it made a great pasta sauce.

I have to agree with everyone else--this garlic butter is fabulous!  I was running late preparing dinner and expecting guests, so I decided to forgo my usual more complicated garlic bread recipe for a simpler one.  And boy am I glad I did!  It was ready in under 5 minutes.  Because of the severe time crunch I estimated most ingredients.  I also  halved the recipe, which was more than enough for one large loaf of French bread.  After I spread the bread I broiled it for about 5 minutes.  It was so good that I had a hard time not commenting on how delicious my own bread was in front of our dinner guests!  LOL  I'm going to have to try it on chicken, because if I have to keep eating bread to get my fix, I'll gain 50 lbs this year!  Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

Very good! Next time I'll cut down on the garlic salt or substitute garlic powder. I love salty food, but it was too much, even for me. Otherwise, it was perfect!

Use garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Salty stuff otherwise! But very good without the extra salt.

This was delish. I didn't actually know garlic butter was soo simple! I thought I would doomed to always buy garlic bread from the store but this was so simple to make! I just spread it on toast and like yummo. It's great to know I can sub in reduced fat, heart friendly magarine, great for the rents. Also, I omitted alot of the recipe and it turned out great anyway!

Cut back on salt (maybe use garlic powder in place of some of the garlic salt?) and it's a winner!  I also added a few roasted garlic cloves because I had roasted a head of garlic for another recipe.  5 stars with less salt!

Indeed very good and went well with both French Bread, Italian Herb Bread (also found on this site) and even good ol' toast. I did have to lessen the amt of minced garlic and little to better suit our tastes and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt per other suggestions (again-a little less of it). The smell is very potent but the taste is very good! Thanks for sharing this one Denyse!

This recipe turned out quite well. At first, it didn't taste 'garlic-y' enough for my tastes, so I added some garlic powder as well. It was a tad too salty because of this, but I tried it on bread and it was delicious, nonetheless.

This was much too salty.  I would recommend using half the amount of suggested garlic salt, and substitute garlic powder for the other half.  Other than that, it was very good! I used it on breadsticks.

I have used a similar recipe for years but I omit the salt. I find that if I use salted butter, and real minced fresh garlic plus a tsp of garlic powder, the result is much less salty. Parmesan can be added either to the butter or sprinkled on top of crusty rolls split or thick Texas style bread!  :-)

This was absolutely delicious! I made this to go on a loaf of storebought Italian bread, and the family raved about how good it was! I did 1/2 tsp of garlic powder instead of garlic salt, as the Parmesan made it salty enough. A couple of days later I added a bit of the leftover spread to some canned green beans, and there were no leftovers. I will definitely make this again!

Very simple, but with tasty results. I didn't have any garlic salt or powder, but I don't really think it needed it; just a touch of salt did the trick.

I used this recipe tonight for garlic bread and it passed the test, it was so delicious.  I only made enough for the bread that I had, but I will make more to freeze.  I will not be wasting my money on store brough garlic bread again! I can't wait to try it on steak.

I love this recipe and make it all the time.  BUT, it's too salty.  So after the first time I just added 1 tsp of garlic salt instead of a whole tablespoon and it was great!

This really tasted good. I was waiting for my youngest daughter to finish eating so I could eat her leftover garlic bread. Unfortunately, she ate all her bread and she never does that. Made 4 servings which was enough to do 4 slices of Italian bread on both sides.

Tasty! The only thing I did differently was to leave out the garlic salt per other reviewers' advice. I tasted before adding as suggested and it was salty enough. Had this on beer bread with lasagna. We have a ton of leftover garlic butter to use on various things now!

Nice!
This tastes like the perfect combination for garlic bread. I used it for some pasta noodles and it was nice. My only modification would be to hold back on the garlic salt. I love salt but it ended up being a bit salty. However, this is a really nice, flavorful recipe and it tastes exactly as you would expect it to taste. It gets 4 stars just because I thought it was a little too salty (for my taste).

This is so easy and flavorful... turns anything mild into a tasty treat. I had store bought breadsticks and found them bland - used this and everyone wanted more.
UPDATE: I make this on a regular basis and my family thinks my garlic bread now rivals the best restaurants... all in the butter (and crunch to the bread.)

I scaled this down to yield 1/4 cup of salted butter. I had some fresh roasted garlic so I minced that to equal 1 full Tablespoon, added 2T parm cheese, a pinch of italian seasoning, a shake or two of garlic salt, no paprika. After reading other reviews I decided to ease up on the salt content. I made five 1 inch balls from using the TABLESPOON measuring spoon. I froze the rest that I was not using right away for later use. Very easy to put together and I like that I can control the amount of seasoning and garlic in the butter. Garlic butter turned out terrific and I used it to spread on garlic bread. This is a good base to add other herbs, serves for many uses and most of all it is readily available when I need it.

It's funny how people's tastes are so different. I see most like this recipe like me, but some are saying it's too salty. In order to avoid that, I added garlic POWDER instead of garlic salt and then added a small amount of salt for a little flavor. It turned out exactly like I wanted. Bennihana cooks their steak with garlic butter that tastes just like this. I've been looking for a recipe that came close and this one is about exact! LOVE it! And yes, it can be used on almost ANYTHING! Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

A garlic lovers dream come true.  Made with tub butter spread and used 2tsp garlic powder instead of the garlic salt.  Used it on corn on the cob, baked potatoes and steak.  Love it!

Excellent and very easy, but do not use garlic salt especially if your using salted butter.  I use one tbsp of garlic powder with salted butter and it turns out perfect everytime.  Will make time and time again. Thank you for the recipe.

Very Good!  This will be a staple recipe now!  The only thing that I might change is to reduce the garlic salt due to saltiness.

This recipe is good but I recommend leaving out the garlic salt, instead use salted butter. I also would recommend roasting a whole large garlic clove, with half an inch cut off the top, in a packet of aluminum foil with 2Tbs of olive oil in an oven until tender. (Approximately 35min@ 375 degrees)  Then add the oil, and squeeze the garlic cloves to the softened butter.

OMG!!! Way salty!!! I tried this intially with a baked potato and it was delicious! Then I made it for garlic bread and I questioned whether I put too much of certain ingredients. Not the case. The garlic salt is a little heavy in this recipe, works good with starches but lessen the amount for breads. Great spread!!

This is wonderful! Like others I swapped the garlic salt for garlic powder. I also didn't have Italian seasoning so I used a basil/thyme blend. I think next time I'll leave out the paprika - it made the butter an ugly color.

This is so versatile!!! You can use it to butter noodles, make garlic bread/toast, dab some on a steak, add to baked potatoes... The possiblities are endless.  I have to make a batch on a weekly basis since we use it for EVERYTHING!  I would either use more butter to make up for the garlic salt or less garlic salt with the stated amount of butter.  I also nixed the paprika as I didn't know exactly how that would make it taste and it still tasted great!

Verrry good! I only gave 4 stars because, like other reviewers, I didn't use the garlic salt. Instead, I used 1 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp salt. This was perfect and can be used in many ways!

This is a great recipe.  I don't use the garlic salt, just a little extra fresh garlic and I have made it with or without the paprika.  I always try to make enough to keep in the fridge because it's so versatile.  We have used it to saute shrimp or to put a "pat" on top of grilled steaks.  Being able to control the amount of garlic butter on your garlic bread is fantastic.  The store-bought variety generally drip in "butter".

Not a success, but we had to substitute soy margarine for butter and omit paprika because of food allergies so its probably a great recipe but my family didn't care for our safe version.

A good starting point from which to customize -- I expect I'll have better results by using garlic powder instead of salt next time around!

Sorry, only 1 star as it's written here. Drastically reduce the salt and it would probably be 5 stars.

Really, really good.  I did not use the garlic salt (didn't have any), use extra fresh garlic and kosher salt.  Came out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

I used this recipe as a garlic butter sauce for pasta. I melted the butter, pressed garlic into melted butter, then sauteed for a few minutes before adding the other ingredients. After making my pasta, I tossed the butter sauce, with my hands (to evenly coat the pasta)into the pasta. This was used as a side dish at a dinner. I got many compliments on this dish. Will definitely make again and again.

Way too salty for us!  I think I will try it again, but use garlic powder in place of garlic salt.  Hopefully that will reduce the saltiness and make it as tasty as it sounds.

Excellent.  Yes, Previous Reviewer, that's how I've always made garlic bread:  butter and granulated garlic.  But I've played around with adding parmesan and/or Italian seasoning, looking for a certain flavor.  The results were OK, but the combination of seasonings here is a bull's eye!  I don't typically use garlic salt.  (Why pay the price for the salt when what you want is the garlic?)  I used granulated garlic in this recipe, Land O' Lakes Light Butter with Canola Oil, and shredded parmesan.

Made this today for our Italian dinner, planning on only smearing it over the bread. Instead I used it on the bread , pasta, AND green beans! GREAT butter!

Delicious!  I was looking for a sauce I could dip pizza and breadsticks into, and this worked really well.  Since that's what I was using it for, I melted the butter and sauted the garlic in it.  I also omitted the pepper and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt (though in the future I might do garlic salt).  I was also a little hesitant about the paprika, but it gave it a nice little something extra.  I liked this a lot for what I used it for and can also see how it would make fablous garlic bread.

I've been making this recipe for over a year and it is great every time. We love it. The only change I make is to use garlic powder, instead of garlic salt.

This is fantastic for garlic bread.  I scaled the whole recipe down by 1/2 and based on other reviewers comments about the saltiness I only used 1/2 tsp. of garlic salt.  Spread it on a split baguette and broil for about 2 minutes.  Delicious!!!

Awesome, but next time I will cut down on the garlic salt, too salty for me, but I am very sensitive to it.  I spread this on fresh baked bread and put under the broiler till it was nice and toasty.  Mmmm Mmmmm Good!

OH my gosh, my husband and I are addicted to this. We are making garlic bread and garlic bread with cheese every night! Also good if you put this on toast and put in the oven then top with Ali's Amazing Bruschetta!! YUMMMMM!!!!!!!!!! Definately lessen the garlic salt though, i used 1/2 the suggested amount or less and it's PERFECT!

Waaaaay too salty as written -- I had to add half again as much butter, as well as some milk to have it be edible.  I wish, wish, wish, I would have used garlic powder instead of garlic salt...which I would have if I'd read the reviews first!  Other than that, the flavor was excellent.  I'll definitely make it again, but with the garlic powder adjustment.

We loved this recipe.  I did as another person suggested and used garlic powder instead of salt.  I used this on meatball subs.  I spread it on the bun and grilled it first before adding the meatballs, sauce and mozzarella cheese.  VERY good.

Great & super easy recipe.  I typically have all ingredients on hand, so I loved that.  My only changes were garlic powder instead of salt and basil & oregano in place of italian seasoning.    I tried it on angel hair pasta for dinner & used it on butter bread - very garlicy dinner, but delish!  Can't wait to make garlic bread!  I plan on freezing some in small containers for future use, as well.

I added extra garlic since I didn't want to use garlic salt.  Also added extra parmesan, and a little red pepper flake.  I mixed it all then put it into my fun shaped ice cube tray and put the tray in the fridge to harden up.  By the morning I should have Mickey shaped garlic butter.  Can't wait.

YUM....YUM! I made Shrimp Scampi using this garlic butter tonight. Tossed a little in some Linguini, and still have some left over for Garlic Bread tomorrow night. What GREAT flavor! I will definately keep some on hand at all times. I bet it would be great for sauteing veggies in.

Fantastic! A great recipe to use on so many things! I used garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt instead of garlic salt - at the recommendation of other reviewers.  I used this recipe with the recipe for "Paula's Breadsticks" and they were a huge hit.

I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars, it is outstanding! Like other posters, I also reduced the amount of garlic salt. I freeze what's left after buttering up a loaf of sliced Italian bread. Tastes like garlic toast from a restuarant!

Thanks for this. We love garlic and this was very good. I melted it and made croutons too!

Fantastic! I spread it on small individual pita breads and broiled for 90 seconds. Far better than anything I've ever bought in the store.

It was Alright... but to be honest I’m not the biggest fan of Garlic. Crazy I know being Italian I should be, but I’m not. But I was making “Italian Dunkers.” For date night. I wanted to add a little some thing extra for the cheesy Bread.

Disgusting as is! Holy smokes, is that amount of garlic salt a typo? I didn't even use that much and it's still too salty. If I ever make this again, I will probably completely forgo it.

I love this recipe!  I've made it several times and always get raves!!  I make extra for use later.  I also make my croutons using this recipe.  Delish!  I as others used half the garlic salt but wouldn't change anything else.  It is great on steamed veggies, a little on top of grilled steaks, so many possibilities.

A tablespoon of garlic salt is WAY too much. It was overwhelmingly salty. We couldn't eat it. I threw out the whole loaf of bread I used this on. I will MAYBE put in 1/4 teaspoon next time.

Awesome!!!! Didn't have celery salt and I love garlic so substituted more garlic salt for the celery salt. Used unsalted butter like you should in recipes like this and was not too salty.

This is great, I used it to spread on pizza dough before baking to make a garlic pizza. I also think it is great as just a spread, I did use a little less garlic salt.

Followed the recipe exactly as it is and it turned out excellent! I made it to roll up in my homemade dinner rolls so  I'm happy I ended up with extra to keep in the fridge to melt and dip pizza crusts in :-)

The garlic salt was too much! In the future I'll reduce it to max 1tsp or substitute it. Besides that it was way too salty, everything else was great!

Very good.  A dollop of this on top of a medium-rare ribeye steak, just after it's come off the grill and is "resting" --- adds something really special.

I made this in a hurry for unexpected guests. I didn't have any minced garlic so I put garlic powder (no garlic salt nor additional salt) and kept the rest of the ingredients as listed. ...the result was fabulous.

Man, this stuff is great. Makes really excellent garlic bread. I saw another reviewer say they used it on grilled cheese sandwiches so I gave that a try, and my boyfriend regaled it as "the best grilled cheese ever." I made a cheeseburger and spread this on both parts of the bun and toasted it, added some Japanese mayo (mmmm MSG) and the two flavors combined beautifully. I imagine it would work on a burger with Hellman's too though :) Basically, if you're toasting something, this will probably be tasty on it. I do agree that it would be too salty to use as a spread though.

I made the recipe as stated, but with 1 tsp garlic salt. Used unsalted butter and fresh garlic. I make double batches and freeze half in smaller amounts. Defrosts very fast and wow, can't even begin to list how many ways this can be used. GREAT STUFF!

I thought this was pretty awesome.  All things I had on hand.  I left out the garlic salt because I feel there is enough salt in the butter.  I am very glad I did too.

Love this recipe!!! I didn't put in the minced garlic or the garlic salt - instead I used the garlic galore from Wild Tree which has about 4 different kinds of garlic in it but I only used 1T+1t and it was perfect :-)

A bit too salty, decrease the garlic salt by half, if not more.  That's my suggestion.  Other than that, great recipe.

Just made this this morning. I doubled the recipe. I am not a fan of food being really salty so I used unsalted butter and did not use the garlic salt. I used fresh garlic. Very delicious. I made 3 logs of the garlic butter and froze them. Took one of the garlic butter logs out if the freezer and cut several slices off to put in the center a homemade hamburgers. It kept the burgers nice and moist and added great flavor. I also spread a piece cut off into some toast. Really like this recipe. I'm glad I omitted the salt.

This gave me a delicious start!  We don't like a lot of salt, so I used salted butter, and substituted garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I put it on bread and broiled it for about 10 minutes and it was fantastic. Thank you!

Made this to go with New York Strip steaks, and those who tried it, loved it. If you like garlic, you should love this on a steak. I used some of the leftovers on spaghetti the next week, and loved the taste.

I used unsalted butter and made no alterations. A recipe on another site said to use 3 garlic cloves and a garlic press so that is what I did instead of trying to measure fresh garlic. All I can say is YUMMY and really made my steaks on the grill outstanding.

I made this last night for garlic bread and it was WAY too salty.  I'm going to try this again, but with a lot less garlic salt.  The other flavors seemed ok, but it was hard to get past the saltiness.

One more note on this garlic butter - I used the garlic butter to make a fast shrimp scampi with already cooked shrimp then put on pasta - OH SO GOOD - I will be making a pile of this garlic butter to use in more applications (I could not figure out how to add/edit the first review - so now there are two reviews!) Hope this is an 'edit' - making a lot I froze some for future use. It looked a little funky - but when whipping it a little with a fork - it became visually pleasing again - and the taste is still wonderful

Absolutely loved it. I read how many people said it was too salty so I just used garlic powder instead of salt. Oh and I guess I used the powdered parmesan cheese. Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't use as much butter, and used 3 large garlic cloves sauteed in 1/3 of the butter, then added to the cooler butter and mash.  It was better than store bought and tasted great.  I did not add Italian seasoning or paprika or garlic salt, instead using a pinch of sea salt. Next time I would add green onions.

So ridiculously delicious! It's so incredibly versatile, it would taste great on pretty much any vegetable, potatoes, bread, etc...best part is, you can basically add any ingredients that you have on hand, red pepper flakes, different kinds of cheese, etc...I had fresh basil so I chopped it up and put it in too! Soooo Yummy! Watch for the salt though, parm cheese is salty so there is no need to add any more salt!

Needed a bit more garlic flavor. I would add a dash of cayenne for a kick next time. Overall, a decent switch to traditional garlic butter. We served this on top of rib-eye steaks.

Turned out great! I didnt have any garlic bread on hand and wanted something quick and easy and this was certainly it! I  took another reviewers suggestion and used garlic powder and regular salt as opposed to the garlic salt.

Made as is.  Definitely too much garlic salt.  Possibly too much Italian seasoning but that would depend on personal taste.  Will make again with adjustments

This stuff is GREAT.  I used it with the Soft Garlic Breadsticks recipe from this site - the two go hand in hand. Instead of the Italian seasoning, which I don't have, I use dried basil, oregano and thyme, if I have any in addition to a pinch of red pepper flakes if I'm in the mood for it. I use 1/2 instead of 1 tablespoon of salt, not garlic salt. I simply use a spoon to brush on the garlic butter on the garlic bread before baking it on a foil lined cookie sheet - makes for an excellence appearance and flavor when using jarred minced garlic.  Highly recommended!  Thanks

This was really good. I used it as a base for a Spinach Feta Pizza so i left out the parmesan and used feta- probably didn't look as nice as with the parmesan but it worked great for it's purpose! I'd like to put this on the outside of a grilled cheese!

I first tried this recipe in 2009 and have been using it ever since for garlic bread and seasoning steamed vegetables.  I make a batch and then freeze  2-3 tablespoon clumps in a container. I transfer the amount needed to a small container in the fridge for garlic bread or veggies.  It is one of my favorite recipes!

This is really quite tasty. I didn't have garlic salt, so I substituted with garlic powder and salt. I used this butter to make my own Texas Toast. I used a recipe from a cookbook to make French Bread, cut it into thick slices and then used this butter to coat both sides. Then I froze the toast, ready to put in the oven later when I wanted garlic bread.

Halved the butter, but kept other measurements the same.  Omitted paprika.  Did the 1tsp garlic powder + 1/2tsp kosher salt instead of 1T garlic salt per other reviews.  Will never buy frozen garlic bread again.  This was soooo good spread on warm crusty bread!  Thanks for a wonderful alternative to the store bought stuff!!

Absolutely amazing recipe for garlic butter - good enough to eat on just about anything!  Easy to make using my magic bullet - just add a capful of milk to make mixing easier.  Cut the black pepper down to 1/4 tsp and traded the 1 tbsp garlic salt for 1 tsp salt and 2 tsp garlic powder.  Also skipped the Italian seasoning.  Delicious!

It was awesome!  I used it to make garlic-cheese toast.  We love butter, so I buttered one side and put it under the broiler for 2 minutes, then buttered the other side, too, and broiled it for another 2 minutes.  It came out perfect!

I made this today and it was so yummy! I used it on thick texas toast that I had left over from making french toast. I didn't have parm cheese so I used mozzarella and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. I think that avoided the "salty" taste some were complaining about. Very tasty and a great way to get rid of some old bread. My hubby & 16 month old loved it too. Thanks!

Tried this tonight and my hubby and my guests loved it!  Paired it with my homemade spaghetti (from scratch).  We all loved the garlicy flavor in it. And don't forget the added benefit of garlic...its good for your heart :) ...the only thing i changed is..i did not add garlic salt like the other reviewer said and used powder garlic instead...The 4* is because i had to alter it a little other than that its very good!

What a great recipe!  The only change we made was that we melted it all in a saucepan so that it was ready to use. We used it to put on top of sirloin cooked on the grill with potatoes and corn on the cob!  Will definitely use this again!

Too much salt for my taste so dropped it down to 1 tsp.  Also next time I will half the Italian seasoning as I thought it overpowered the spread, especially for kids.  Other than that I definitely think this is a winner Garlic Butter and I will keep it close for Summer grilling.

I agree with other reviews, too salty (will leave out the salt next time), but other than that: DELICIOUS.  Have paired it with steak, my husband drizzled some on homemade hot wings and even works for just simple buttered bread as a snack.

I made a half a batch yesterday to spread over French bread and it's nearly gone! I make flavored butter often but have never thought to add Parmesan. I prefer using unsalted butter and then adding salt to taste when making flavored butter.

I was in a hurry and needed a quick recipe for Garlic Butter.  This fit the bill perfectly.  The only thing I would change is to not add the garlic salt.  The cheese and butter already have enough salt that adding more seemed redundant.

This is an excellent recipe.  I just omitted the salt and it was perfect.  It can be used as a spread or to use when cooking garlic bread in the oven.  My husband doesn't even like the regular butter anymore!  I think the salt issue is just a preference and can easily be adjusted to the family taste.

As is, the recipe is way too salty.  With my own alterations, I give it a 4.5.    I used margarine because that's what we keep in the house...1/4 tsp salt and 1 tsp garlic, but it was still too salty.  I added about 1 1/2 tsp of sugar to try and balance it out and it worked.  Next time, I will leave out the salt entirely!

Very good---used garlic powder instead of garlic salt--great for corn on the cob, garlic bread, etc..

This is my go to garlic butter.  I use it on italian bread...its much more cost efficient to make garlic bread this way.  I also use it on steaks, or a quick pasta sauce, just add your favorite noodles.  It is great on grilled halibut as well.  To make help mince the garlic, chop it coarsley, then sprinkle with the garlic salt then using the side of you knife drag and crush it together to make a paste.  That way you don't get unwanted chunks of garlic.

Outstanding!  I used it on steaks, on crab, to make breadsticks and I'm going to use it to make garlic bread.  Like others, I used a tablespoon of garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  It was perfect.  This recipe is a keeper!

Very tasty! I zapped mine a bit so it was melty. We just spread the melted butter on our sourdough bread, but it would've been wonderful toasted in the oven, too. We don't mind raw garlic; however some people do and I would encourage them to toast theirs :) Thanks for the recipe! EDIT: I just realized I didn't use any garlic salt in mine and it was a little on the salty side (from the Parmesan and the salted butter). Would use unsalted butter next time and I never use garlic salt, so I think those changes would make this perfect for me.

This is a very good recipe, excellent for bread and potatoes I can see.  Definitely do go easy on the spices, you can always and should flavor to your taste.  I did only 1 tsp. of garlic salt, and about 1/2 tsp. of regular salt. From there I just fine tuned it.  The paprika is just good for color.  Thanks Denyse.

This is the most amazing garlic butter anywhere.  I was really worried when I made it that it was just way too garlicky, I even had my son taste it on crackers but we decided it was ok.  I use this specifically to make garlic bread toasted in the oven topped with Mozzarella and its amazing.  I made it a couple house ahead, put in the fridge to chill and then microwaved a bit before placing on the bread.  The garlic bread I have even made.  This one is a definite keeper.   I can;t wait to try a pat on some grilled steaks!

Because I was using this butter for a different recipe that already had a lot of parmesan, I left out the parmesan; also, I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, warned by other reviewers.  This is a wonderful and incredibly flavorful butter, and this will be my standard garlic butter recipe from now on!

This is such a handy recipe! The only reason I didn't give it 5 star's was due to too much salt in the original recipe. But I followed the advice of other's here and reduced/omitted the garlic salt.

This is extremely easy and tastes great both toasted on bread or raw on cold bread.  Or on crackers!  It's just plain AWESOME.  I've made this numerous times for work; it's a great snack with french bread (not a healthy snack, but a delicious snack).

The first time I made this I used Garlic Salt and it was WAY TOO SALTY, I dumped it and remade it with garlic powder. Terrific once the switch was made.

Wonderfully simple!  Put it on bread, vegetables, eggs, just about anywhere you put regular butter on and the garlic gives it the enhanced taste and flavour.

Very good!  i cut it down to three serving because I really try not to eat that much butter all the time.  i also used garlic powder because that's all i have and a dash of sea salt.  I think you are suppose to use unsalted butter for this recipe.  i spread this on a baguette i made right out of the oven...heaven!

This had excellent flavor. I used sweet cream butter salted and then spread this on some hamburger buns and some sandwich bread then broiled them. Super Duper! Thanks!!!

I agree with others in that this recipe is too salty. I had read the reviews but as we like salt, i figured i would make this as written. It was okay and i will probably make it again but with little or no garlic salt.

This makes the best garlic bread ever!  We used it for "emergency" garlic bread on hamburger and hot dog buns and now we won't go back to the store bought garlic toast!

Delicious!  Based on other reviews, I added much less garlic salt but increased the minced garlic a bit.  I thoroughly coated made-from-scratch garlic breadsticks with this before putting in the oven and got rave reviews!

This was okay.  I make a lot of garlic butter so I thought I'd try this recipe based on the high rating - it was definitely not my favorite but wasn't bad.  Something was overwhelming but I'm not exactly sure what.  Other reviewers mentioned the garlic salt so I cut it back a bit, but found the balance of the italian seasoning and/or paprika a bit odd and dominating.

I never knew how easy it is to make your own garlic butter.  This stuff is good!  The only reason I would not give it 5 stars is because as-is there is way too much salt.  Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.  Also don't make the mistake I did when using it after refrigerating it- either let it sit out for a while or reheat it a 50% power for 30-45 sec.

Wasn't bad, pretty much the typical garlic bread recipe but a little on the salty side so I cut down the salt by half (you can put more salt according to your own taste) and popped it in the broiler. As long as you cut down on the salt, it's delicious.

I had a loaf of french bread left over from Christmas morning brunch, and decided we'd have garlic bread with our lasagne dinner tonight. This recipe made the bread taste just like restaurant-style garlic bread. All my picky eaters loved it!

I made a large batch of this recently to go over whole wheat pasta. I needed to get my 12 year old brother to eat it, and he LOVES garlic. We both really enjoyed it! I saved the leftover sauce and used it to make shrimp scampi a few nights later. Again, it was delicious!

My SO and I enjoyed this recipe.  It was really tasty!  I do have to agree with everyone that it uses too much salt.  Even if I halved the amount of salt, it was still a little salty.  Next time, I will use a scant amount or even no salt at all.  By the way, I couldn't find garlic salt at my local supermarket.  So, I used kosher salt and added more garlic just like what some of the reviewers had done.  Thanks for the recipe!

Warning of the salt!
I had read the other review so I cut the Garlic salt in half.
It was still way too salty, we couldn't eat the bread I had baked.
Both me and my husband like salty food, but this was un-eatable.

I will use my old way to do garlic butter.

Wow.. I really wish I would have read the reviews before I made this! 1 tbsp of garlic salt is WAY TO MUCH! Especially since butter is already salted. I think next time if I used way less garlic salt, this would have an awesome flavor! The paprika and all the seasonings really give this butter a beautiful color.. excellent for presentation!

I used this to make garlic bread, and thankfully I realized that a tablespoon of garlic salt would be way too much, so I substituted garlic POWDER and used a dash or two of the garlic salt.  It was delicious that way!

I made this garlic butter, then put it on Italian bread slices and froze it.  When I needed to use my garlic bread, I pulled it out of the freezer the night before, and broiled it, then sliced it.  I liked the taste of the garlic bread better then just drizzling butter or olive oil on it then garlic.  It was evenly distributed.  The paprika gave it a little extra zing.  I did not have italian seasoning so I did not put that in but it was still great.

I used to always use the garlic bread fantastique recipe from this site, until I tried this recipe tonight. Best garlic bread I've ever had or made. I thought the proportions of the ingredients were perfect. I'll be using this recipe again and again.

This is the one! Just like others this is the perfect butter spread for making garlic bread. You can change what medium you use but the ingrdients are solid. Paprika is such a huge unused spice try it it adds sooo much to many things!!!

I have to laugh at all the reviews that say this recipe is "simpler than [their] usual recipe" - don't you all just slap some butter on the bread and sprinkle with garlic salt/powder???!!  I didn't know there WAS another way to make garlic bread! LOL!

Anyway, having said that, yes, this recipe was simple and very good!  I used unsalted butter and I beat it with my hand mixer to make it easier to stir.  I also didn't add the full amount of garlic salt (I was just shy of what was called for as I ran out) and I did find it a tad on the salty side.  Like others have suggested, it is great for baked potatoes!  I also used powdered parm cheese (the kind you would put on spaghetti) and it still tasted fine.  Oh, and to the garlic lovers out there - definitely try this!!

Perfect! 5 star recipe! This should be in everyones recipe box. Used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. It was salty enough without the garlic salt. We used this for garlic bread, I can't wait to have it on pasta, rice, potatoes, steaks, grilled corn etc.

I made half of the recipe (it was still plenty) and spread it on a split 9-grain Italian loaf.  To simplify, I used Emeril's Essence in place of the spices.  I baked the bread at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes and then broiled for a couple of minutes.  It was delicious-- thanks for a winner!

This recipe is really great. The only thing I did differently was to add my own roasted garlic instead of raw. The sweetness of the roasted garlic just enhances the entire recipe

The sauce came out great. I must admit I substituted the garlic salt with 1tbsp of garlic powder and added a pinch of salt because I am not a big salt eater.  I also used complete seasoning to replace the Italian seasoning.  Thanks so much.

Amazing!! Unsalted butter is a must in this recipe.  I didn't cut back on the garlic salt but if you don't care for salt you may need to.  My 6 year old ate 3 sliced of garlic bread with his dinner tonight! Needless to say I didn't have any leftover! I will never make garlic bread with out this butter again! Thank you so much for this great recipe!

Made this today since my byfrnd was making spaghetti for the family.  I sub. the garlic salt for garlic powder and it turned out well!  Omitted the paprika because we didn't have any.  BF liked it and that's enough for me to rate this a 5 star.

Delicious--I spread on sliced Honey Sourdough from this site and broiled till melted & the bread was crisp on the edges. I followed LadyJayPee's lead and downsized the garlic. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt as I agreed 1 T of garlic salt is a lot of garlic and a lot of salt, especially when using salted butter.

Very good recipe. I used it with the "Yeast-Free Bread" recipe from this site. I used 1 1/2 sticks of butter instead of 2, so I scaled everything down just a bit. Also, to make mixing everything together easier, I used my potato-smasher and it really worked out well. Thanks!

Nice flavor, but much too salty as the recipe reads with salted butter, salt in the parmesan, and an entire tablespoon of garlic salt!  I subbed granulated garlic for the garlic salt and only used 1tsp vs 1T; thought there was enough garlic since it also called for 1T fresh minced garlic (I used 2 large cloves); we LOVE garlic, but so glad I downsized on it!  This was a nice topping on a warm slice of the French Country Bread I made from this website today.  Thank you, Denyse!

I used just dried garlic not garlic salt and did not add any salt and thought it was wonderful.  I'll never buy store bought garlic bread again.  I used 1/4 of the reciped and 1/2 a loaf of bread and it worked out great for 4 people.  Of course, I also added mozerella cheese on top!

Very good!  I used 1/2 T. garlic powder and 1/2 T. garlic salt to cut down the saltiness.  I spread this on thin slices of english muffin bread from this site and broiled it for a few minutes and it made wonderful garlic toast!  Thanks.

Spread on thick-cut italian bread and broil for a few minutes.  Yum!  I usually use garlic powder and add a little salt.  Fantastic!

Why didn't I think of this?  This is so delicious, not really much else to say.  Next time I will use garlic powder instead of salt, but other than that, perfect!  Thanks to the Quality Cooks for the great recommendation!

Followed others advice and used garlic powder instead of salt (used salted butter) and this turned out great.  FYI, 1/2 the recipe is enough to butter one whole loaf of french bread.

Made this the other night with a huge plate of pasta and some Italian bread - - let me add to the list that you can't find a better garlic butter than this.  Turns the same ole garlic bread into something so amazing.

Incredible! I made a batch of this and melted it for dipping a homemade pizza into. Absolutely beats delivery garlic butter hands down! I will use this on just about everything from here on. I cut the garlic salt in half and added garlic powder in its place, but otherwise left the recipe in tact. The best I've ever tasted!

Yum!  I halved the recipe and used garlic salt with salted butter and had no problems with it being too salty.  It's just personal taste I guess.

This was very yummy and garlicky.  I made a half batch, and it was plenty enough for my fam.  We have lots left over too, for later.  We used it on a fresh baguette to go with dinner, it was great.  It was a little orange-looking from the paprika, but it tasted great.  I used salted butter and used garlic powder instead of salt.  One should probably use unsalted butter if they are going to use the garlic salt.

thanks so much for this recipe!!  I found myself w/o the garlic bread sprinkle I usually make garlic bread with, so I searched for a recipe here.  I did however, leave out the paprika and parmesan (not a fan) and substituted garlic powder for garlic salt (don't keep that on hand).  I used fresh garlic in Country Crock spread on Italian bread--it tasted great!  Wonderful compliment to my lasagna. Thanks!

We loved this recipe! It's a "keeper" for sure.  Made it for garlic toast and ended up using it on potatoes too.  Delicious! (I didn't have any paprika so I had to leave it out and exchanged the garlic salt for garlic powder because that was what I had).

This butter is delicious! I had to bring butter to a party where the host was serving lasagna, searched recipes for garlic butter because I didn't want to bring just butter. I brought it and everyone loved it. Thanks Denyse! I'm packaging the dry ingredients in little bags, with the directions to add the butter and garlic clove, as little gifts to my Bunco club.

Excellent!  I mainly use this for garlic bread so I eliminate the garlic salt and pepper, and use crushed garlic in a jar rather than minced. It's also very good without the parmesan cheese, and parsley can be used in place of Italian seasoning for variation. I store it in a small covered tupperware dish.  It keeps very nicely.

Mmmm... I halved the recipe and used calcium-enriched country crock, so that made it healthier and it was already softened. Just did some additional garlic powder instead of the garlic salt, but other than that, didn't change a thing. Ate it on corn on the cob, and then today had it on some bread broiled in the oven topped with tomato slices. Delicious!

I think that this would be a 4 or 5 starer but it had to much salt in it for bread. The next time I make it I will reduce the amount of salt and re-rate.

This is sooooo good!  Made turkey melts with cheddar cheese and fresh salsa on them using buttered toasted french bread, sounds wierd but that is what the kids requested, and it tasted pretty good. Also used on a leftover bbq steak excellent!  New staple in my fridge.  Didn't use garlic salt, used a pinch of Kosher salt instead since I prefer the flavor of Kosher salt.

Very good.  Although the garlic salt made it way too salty for bread but perfect for potatoes. I know that sounds weird but true.  I would omit the garlic salt next time and add more minced garlic then add salt to taste.

I was looking for a roasted garlic butter, couldn't find one so I adjusted this one.  It was amazing!  Here's what I did. I used a head of roasted garlic instead of 2 cloves fresh and also added 1 t juice from a jar of garlic.  O MY!  Will make again and again!!!!!!!! Not something you want to make on a first date though.

Very nice. Not enough garlic, but that is easily remedied to each person's taste. Will definitely use this in the future.

This was so good and so simple. I left out the Italian seasoning and zapped the minced garlic quickly in a hot skillet with a little bit of olive oil to get rid of the crunchyness of raw garlic. This will become a standard in our fridge.

Made this recipe the other day and used it on egg noodles as a side dish to chicken from the oven.  I made about 16 oz noodles and added about 3 tbsp of the butter to the noodles.  Kids added a little more to their own when it was on the table but everyone liked it.  I placed the rest in a tupperware container and placed int he fridge for future use.

I felt like the garlic flavor was a bit too strong for me.  However, my husband LOVED it!  He spread the butter on french bread and baked it in the oven.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I have made this so many times now and I keep a small bowl of it in my fridge--in a pinch, I just spead it on regular bread for garlic toast, but it's wonderful on french or italian bread!! I wouldn't change it at all--it's perfect! Everyone loved it. My family requests it every time.

I had to modify this just a tad because I didn't have the parsley. But I had the rest of it. This is a delicious recipe!! This would go well melted on roasted veggies or even mashed potatoes. You could put it on anything!

Delicious as long as you don't use garlic SALT. Use fresh garlic and a bit of garlic powder, and just a pinch of regular salt. The parmesan cheese is salty, so there is no need to use garlic salt.

I din't have cayenne and added 3 times the minced garlic. It was made initially for the butter spread on my flat bread pizza. Works great. I also used it for garlic bread and mashed potatoes.

Being  Italian garlic is great on everything. I modified the recipe for a 2 pound container of  butter. I use it on seafood , steak , and chicken. I also like to make my own garlic bread with it as well. YUM.

We really liked this!  I cut the recipe in half--I used real butter, added 1 1/4 teaspoons jarred minced garlic (drained of water) + 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder and 1 teaspoon garlic salt and remaining ingredients.  I used what I needed and put the rest in the fridge for another time.  It was perfect!!!

Didn't use garlic salt, instead used 1/2 tsp of salt, garlic, italian seasoning and paprika. Excellent on french bread!

This was great!  Easy; I didn't have a mixed Italian seasoning so I used Herbs de Province.  As others have said, I definitely cut the garlic salt to 1/2 teaspoon and it was perfect. I made this to use on steamed green beans.- excellent!  I didn't use to make garlic bread as the contributor suggests,  but I will definitely try that next.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.  Thank you!

Thank you. I changed NOTHING, except I added salt once it was almost done. Reason for that is every one has their own palate and each brand of cheese has  own sodium contents. For those who find it toooo garlicky, let it stay wrapped and in fridge.  Great flavours after 2/3 days! Never buying either garlic or garlic bread  from store anymore.

Delicious recipe with these changes: 1) 3 large cloves of fresh minced garlic, and 2) garlic powder instead of garlic salt. The salted butter I used made it plenty salty. This is also delicious on hot pasta. In the future I plan to make a bigger batch and freeze the extra, as other reviewers have suggested. Thank you to the author!

This is exceptional, in my view. I have been making boring garlic butter for years, until today. I only omitted one thing: paprika- just for personal taste.  I substituted, as some readers suggested, the one teaspoon garlic powder plus 1 teaspoon salt for the garlic salt, which I did not have on hand. It was a great idea, so thank you to the person who initially added that.

I made it to recipe, if for a smaller serving, and my family loved it. I did use unsalted butter because of my dad's high sodium intake so next time I might use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.

Love the flavor! I didn't add the garlic salt-watching my sodium-but may try a pinch or two just to see the difference.  I added a couple of dashes of dill too to give it a bite!

Way too salty. . But, I think its a good recipe overall. We are going to try it again but i stead of using garlic salt, we are going to use garlic powder.

This is pretty much a staple in our household now. It's great stuff for on-demand garlic toast, topping steaks, and with potatoes. I've also brushed it on pizza dough-under the sauce or eggs- when making regular and breakfast pizzas. Once you start, you'll find yourself trying to use it everywhere. It's good as written, but we're a low-sodium house, so to cut salt, I use garlic powder (not salt) and low-sodium parm now. Even with that it still seems a little too salty-tasting sometimes, but I think that's got to be from the strong garlic flavor.

Made a very small batch of this for my family for garlic bread slices. Its good but my girls did not like the garlic salt. It's WAY too much in my opinion and I reduced the amount tremendously. Next time I'll try this but leave out the garlic salt.

Absolutely delicious!!  I used this to copy my mother-in-law's homemade garlic bread.  I will never buy the frozen Texas Toast again!  I heeded the advice of other reviews and replaced the garlic salt with 1 teaspoon garlic powder and about an eighth teaspoon of salt (I used salted butter), and I left out the parmesan because I didn't have any.  It's so good I don't know if it will make it to tomorrow's dinner!!

Since I taste my food as I go Thank God!!  Yes this recipe is way too much garlic SALT. I replaced it with A TSP of garlic powder, add a pince of garlic salt since I used a salted butter. Also I add parsley.

This was really good, but (like others mentioned) it was a bit too salty for my taste.  I will definitely make this again, but follow the advice of others and do a tablespoon of garlic power and a teaspoon of salt.  We put it on grilled steaks and it was spectacular!!  It was also good in mashed potatoes.

I did not use the garlic salt as I used salted butter. Instead I doubled the amount of fresh minced garlic, and added a touch more of the parm. 
I served it in conjunction with homemade garlic soup. All in all, it was a huge hit within my household!

I made this as a spread for garlic bread! It was amazing!!! Since the recipe was so large my husband used the rest of it to cover some wing he cooked on the grill.  He melted it and tossed the wings in it.  AGAIN AMAZING!!!

I make this and use it on salmon fillets in the oven. Delicious! But I cut the recipe down for a half stick of butter because the recipe calls for a cup of butter which is 2 sticks and that’s just way too much for salmon. But I have made the full recipe and refrigerated the rest to use later in the week for garlic bread and garlic noodles. Both of those are delicious as well. It’s a very versatile recipe.

Guys. This is seriously the BEST garlic butter. The first time I made it was to melt over resting steaks. Incredible. I rolled the rest and put it in my fridge and just made some garlic bread with it over Italian bread. It was probably the best garlic bread I’ve had in a long time. PERFECT!

Was tasty but too salty. Next time I will use garlic powder instead of garlic salt, salted butter all ready has enough salt in it. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for the first time today and I know I'll be making it again and again.  I didn't have butter on hand so I substituted ICBINB and the results were still very good.   I made home made bread and cut in thick slices, buttered the bread with it and enjoyed it with our stuffed shells.  My son and DIL...even the kids...were asking for more!

I would have given this recipe 5 stars, but it was way too salty. I will use only half the amount of garlic salt next one, hoping it will fix the too much salt taste!  Otherwise, perfect flavor....!

This is such a winning recipe!!! If you make it, they will come! I've used this so many times and it is a hit each time. One time I made it, then shaped it into little balls and after my husband cooked steak, I let the butter melt on the steak, it was amazing. It is so good, you'll be tempted to eat it with a spoon. The most recent time I made it, I used it for garlic bread and even though I put some on the bread before cooking it, people were dipping their bread it in afterward. Also, I used it to sauté vegetables when needed. 

It is a bit salty so I use garlic powder instead of garlic salt and you can omit the parm cheese and not feel like something is missing.

Really delicious!  I used salted butter and substituted 2 teaspoons of garlic powder for the garlic salt, which I don't have.  We used it to make garlic bread.

Oof Delishhhhh~ and SUPER quick (quicker if you don't melt it) & easy to make! Only thing I did differently was that I actually melted the butter in a metal bowl over boiling water (my fav method for melting foods) just so it could infuse the seasonings more as well as the parm. I can't tell ya how long to let it cool if you melt the butter as I used the tried and true Yooper Winter Cooling technique (used to cool like anything) and just stuck it outside in the snow and mixed it 'til it was solidish but soft. Thank you for an awesome recipe that goes well with like everything! ^w^

I made this to put on the bread for steak sandwiches as the reviewer for that recipe had pointed to this recipe.  I happened to be making baked asparagus where I use only EVO on my asparagus.  I put this one the bread for the steak sandwiches and on the asparagus and it was amazing and fabulous on both. Wish I hadn't put it on the asparagus because now I don't want asparagus without it.  I did as other reviewers suggested and used real garlic and only a tinge of garlic salt.  It was FABULOUS.

After reading the reviews, I cut the garlic salt in half and added garlic powder for the other half. I used this for garlic bread to be eaten with spaghetti.

I made this the other night to use on steak. I read some of the reviews and many people had mentioned it was too salty so I decided to use garlic powder is stead of garlic salt. It came out amazing! Super simple and delicious.

I halved the recipe and used 1 part garlic salt to 2 parts garlic powder, and it was delicious. I made it the night before to go with a steak dinner, but stole the remains in the bowl on a piece of bread for myself! Yum.

Pretty  delicious.  Didn't have Parmesan cheese, but other than that it was great.  (I highly suspect it would be even more amazing with the zing from the missing cheese)

This was really good! It turned out much better than the pasta sauce, which was a disaster, so I created a kind of buttered noodles with it. I found that adjusting the recipe to 2 servings (as opposed to 16, or about 2 Tablespoons' worth) was right to accompany a meal for my small family.

Good recipe. But one major change I made was too leave out the garlic salt all together. Instead I added a tbsp of granulated or powdered garlic. I didn't add any salt at all. This way your able to taste the garlic instead of salt. We have enough salt in our lives. Just leave it out.

This recipe is amazing, but you need to add 3 tablespoons of minced garlic to really get the right flavor.

GOOD HANDY   I used a full lb. of salted butter and doubled ingredients except garlic salt because of reviews. I just used sprinkling of garlic salt. I froze for the summer for breads and steak. Shared with daughter. Very handy.

How could garlic + butter = anything other than wonderful!?
I over-roasted two whole bulbs of garlic in the oven (dunked the bulb in water, wrapped in a foil sheet, 350 degree for about 20-30 min.) so I could have a garlic paste versus minced garlic.  Slicing a bit off the root end, before or after roasting, lets one squeeze the garlic out, much easier for me than mincing by hand.  I don't add garlic salt; I only add the other ingredients to suit for whatever I am making as needed at the time.  Oh-So-Garlicky-Good!

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fabulous!  Used unsalted butter, like I do for everything.  So glad I forgot to buy that frozen Texas Toast for spaghetti night and made this from scratch instead!
Update:  After sitting a while, this seemed way too salty.  Next time I make this I will cut the salt!

I should have read the reviews, but was in a hurry, and just looked at the overall rating.  Way too salty and too much garlic.  We had my son's girlfriend over for dinner, after my husband tried it first, he got out the plain butter to use on the fresh bread.  I ate it, but have almost the entire recipe left, I used some for oven fried chicken, but  not sure how to use the rest of it.

Awesome garlic butter.... use anywhere you'd use butter in a savoury dish. Makes a flavourful fried egg and butter dip for seafood. Got the recipe from a women while camping.

Spread this on some hoagie buns that needed to be used, then turned them face down on my hot electric griddle. Not long, just enough to get crusty, then I turned the buns over to quickly warm the other side. DELICIOUS! Have enough to do this again tomorrow night! BTW, I used granulated garlic instead of garlic salt. The amount recommended was perfect!

It's good.  I halved the recipe and it made a lot of butter.  Only thing I'll do different next time is cut the Italian Seasoning in half.  Recipe calls for too much IMO.

Wow salt!! I made the recipe exactly as written with the exception of adding fresh parsley and used it for toasted garlic bread. Although my guest were gracious and said they loved it I personally found it really really really salty. I did like the flavors and will definitely make this again omitting the garlic salt for garlic powder and adding salt to taste.

This is pretty amazing stuff! I did cut down on the salt by only using 1/2 teas onion salt and that was plenty for us. I put it on our steak (better than steak sauce) our baked potato and garlic bread. Outstanding! I will keep a tub of this in the fridge at all times! Yum!

This was great. Made it and put it on top of steaks. Once mixed, I formed it into a bar with parchment paper. Should get a few uses out of the one batch. Will definitely make again. The only thing I left out was the garlic salt.

This is so good! I made modifications based on family preferences, but I'm sure it's just as good with no modifications. I leave out the pepper and paprika. I've made it with and without the parmesan (mostly because I forgot it the second time), and it's delicious both ways. Even my 4yr old loves it!

Wish I'd read the reviews before I made this! Cutting WAY back on the garlic salt would have made this better.  I used tons o fresh garlic, this was the only change I made. And cutting the recipe in half would also be best!

I use salted butter and garlic powder instead of garlic salt, otherwise it is just too salty.  I double it and keep it in the freezer, then chip off a chunk when I need it.

Turned out great. The only change I made was substituted garlic powder for the garlic salt.

I used the exact recipe, but  I replaced the paprika with chili powder. Instead of just mixing the ingredients, I melted the butter and added all (minus the Parmesan) to the pot and stirred til well combined.  I then poured the melted butter into a container, and added the Parmesan just before I put the butter into the fridge.  I shook the butter up every 15 minutes so that everything stayed well combined until it returned to a solid state.  When I'm ready to use the butter, I pop it in the microwave and brush over bread for the perfect garlic bread!

Delicious!! 
I made this recipe to make garlic hogie rolls for French Dip sandwiches (which were also delicious and found on this site) - Fortunately I read the comments prior to making the butter and used less garlic salt (1 teaspoon plus 2 teaspoons of garlic powder). This makes enough garlic butter so I have plenty left over to use in other recipes!

My family loved this recipe!  I didn't have garlic salt so used sea salt instead. I minced a large clove of garlic then followed the recipe as was. I put everything in my food processor & it came out perfect! We're all happy & will use this continuously since it's easy, fast, & delicious on Fresh Pane bread! Won't buy the store garlic butter bread again!

I just made this tonight, but had to substitute  McCormick Grill Mates Montreal Chicken seasoning, 1/2 tsp, for the Italian seasoning.  (That was the closest thing to Italian seasoning that I had).  I didn't know if it would be any good so I used less than called for of the Italian seasoning.  It turned out great!   I'll definitely make this again.

I have made this MANY times and always get rave reviews!  I did take other reviewers suggestions and cut salt and just add  more garlic.  It's great on all kinds of bread and is quick and easy to prepare.  I usually make a day or two ahead of a dinner party so it's one less thing to do.  Fantastic!!

This was a super easy recipe to follow. I melted the butter in a small saucepan and added the garlic and spices to the pan. This worked out well because the consistency allowed me to spoon it over my tilapia before baking. I also spooned some over the rice. My husband loves it.

Really good BUT way too salty!! I will reduce the garlic salt next time. I will probably use garlic powder with a pinch of salt. You can always add salt but can't take away.

My husband used this tonight with some tweaks.  He used garlic powder rather than salt since that's what we had and he left the paprika out (for the kids).  He didn't use salt at first, then ended up adding some.  I have to be honest since I didn't watch him make it, I'm not sure if he used the measurements listed or not.  It did turn out okay.  Not the best, but okay.  I feel like it's missing something and that could be from the powder and minus the paprika so next time we'll use that and see.

It wasn't great but it wasn't awful either.

WAY too much garlic salt. Added more butter to make it less salty, other than that it was pretty good. I would use 1 half teaspoon of the garlic salt.

I think garlic is a personal taste.  I made this recipe just as it was written and for me it was not garlicky enough.  I will add more next time.

I made this because it looked delicious and served it the first time I made it to my dinner guests.  They all kept asking for more bread so that they could use some more of this wonderful garlic butter.  Leftovers can be kept in a sealed container in the fridge, but they don't last long around our house.  Everyone adds this to bread, potatoes, meats, etc.

This recipe already has many reviews, but what's one more?

This is outstanding! I was looking for a garlic butter recipe to toast bread for a patty melt. As some others suggested, I used plain garlic powder and added about a 1/2 tsp salt into unsalted butter.  I used a microplane and grated 3 large cloves of garlic and it mixed in wonderfully. I put about 3/4 tsp on each side of the bread and toasted in a hot dry skillet.  No need to buy the frozen garlic bread anymore!

Great Butter, my boyfriend and I both LOVE garlic, and garlic butters. After reading all the reviews, I omitted the garlic salt all together. Instead I put in 1 1/2 tsp garlic PEPPER, still got my garlic flavor, but none of the added salt others mentioned. I just made it, and haven't gotten to try it on anything, but it smells great and I'm looking forward to using it in almost everything I can!

good basic recipe to grow off of... i never use garlic salt since all it is is salt with a little bit of garlic, that is why people are saying its too salty. just use garlic powder instead then salt to taste and it is a perfect spread!

Do not add garlic salt if you are using butter with salt. It made it and it turned out far too salty. I will be making again just without garlic salt just garlic powder!!

This was great, I had to tweak it a bit.  My significant other is a vegan, so I used 'I Can't believe it's not butter', no cheese, freshly minced garlic, and I used a variety of my fave herbs, instead of the ready made ital. seas.!  I used the garlic butter to saute Tofu, and it tasted Wonderful.  Thanks for the tips!

Awesome! Per the reviews I read I used 1T. garlic powder instead of garlic salt, then added S & P to taste. We are having it on breasticks tonight, but I can't wait to try on veggies, steak, baked potatoes, rice, shrimp....and POPCORN!!!! Thanks for a keeper!

Delicious! I omitted the garlic salt as some other reviewers had suggested, and the paprika because I didn't have it on hand. Very very easy recipe, absolutely scrumptious....borderline addictive! I will be making this in a few batches to freeze and reuse as needed. Thanks!

Love this recipe! Ended up making it more like a sauce, and then put my rolls in the bowl. Basically, flavor was just what I was looking for. Only thing I'll do without next time is the paprika, mainly because of the color it made.

This is an amazing recipe! Although I did cut the garlic salt down to one teaspoon because I used salted butter, I found the perfect garlic butter. I used a 1/2 and 1/2 butter and margarine but other than these two minor changes I followed all other ingredients to a T.  Thanks Denyse for sharing this recipe.

Amazing recipe, the Paprika is just such a great twist to regular Garlic Butter.  I don't keep Garlic Salt in so I just added a little regular salt.  Can't recommended enough - GREAT on Ciabatta

This recipe was great, but the salt was a bit much and I love salty foods. After reading the reviews, I cut back on the salt, but it still came out a tad too salty. I 1/2'ed the recipe and called for 1.5 tsp of garlic salt, I will only put 1/2 tsp next time. Otherwise, great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

Store bought garlic bread tastes nasty after discovering this garlic butter. My family loves it. It is also a great gift idea. I buy the soft butter that comes in small tubs (of two) which is about the size of a cup, and bust it out whenever we have pasta nights. Thank you for the great recipe!

You can’t go wrong with this recipe.  This is a good, basic garlic butter that utilizes staples most of us have on hand all the time.  It’s easy to whip up and nice to have on hand in the fridge or freezer.  Based on some of the reviews, I did choose to omit the garlic salt.  Next time I might increase the Parmesan, Italian seasoning, and pepper for a little more oomph

I followed the recipe exactly, except used softened butter instead of melted.  Our garlic bread was excellent, and I refrigerated the unused garlic butter to use another time.

I made it without reading any of the reviews, and I did find it a bit too salty...I would cut down the amount of garlic salt next time, maybe half garlic salt and half garlic powder. Great recipe though!

Really good! I used minced garlic in a jar, and half butter and half margarine. Oh, and I didn't use garlic salt, instead I used garlic powder and a few good shakes of salt. It's easy enough to add salt at the table if desired. Thanks for sharing, Denyse, even our six-year-old loved it!

What a nice little spread! I've had my eye on this recipe since last weekend. I was planning to make dinner for my mom's Bday, but after my cheesecake and breadsticks went "flop," (yes, good cooks have off days every now and then lol...), I tossed in the towel (literally) and made resies at a local Italian restaurant. I was planning to use this to complement the breadsticks (many reviewers of that recipe suggested doing so). I already pre-mixed my spices, so all I had to do tonight was soften my butter and mince some garlic cloves (only fresh here!). My fiance made Bacon and Parmesan Penne Pasta (SusieQ). This complemented the French baugette slices we served with it nicely! My only regret is using garlic salt. I should have tasted beforehand.... This was SUPER salty! I even used unsalted butter (I don't keep the salted stuff on hand). Next time, I will be SURE to substitute 1 T garlic powder or use 1/2 garlic salt / 1/2 powder (just don't decrease the amount called for!!!). I think using granulated powder is your best option tho - Parmesan cheese is salty enough. I'm going to try this on steak or baked potatoes this coming week (I have a LOT left). Thanks for sharing, Denyse! :-)

Basic recipe indeed but it works very nicely. I don't have garlic salt and I couldn't find my mincer, so I made mine with finely chopped garlic and a dash of salt. Chopped gives you nice little "spikes" of pure garlic flavor and texture that you won't get with minced, try it!

This was fabulous.  The rolls I made didn't turn out so good, but when I put this butter on them, they all were eaten and raved about.

This was great!  I halved the recipe for my family of 3 and had plenty left over for future use.  I used 1 huge clove of garlic but was out of garlic salt so subbed in a little under 1/2 tsp (a little under 1 tsp for the whole recipe) of garlic powder.  I noticed that some other reviewers said the recipe as written was a little salty and think this cut back on the salt as well.  Brushed over Italian breadsticks to round out our meal... we'll definitely be making this again!

I modified this by using twice the garlic, and garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  I found it was salty enough, because I had used salted butter.  The garlic spread was used on french bread, and tasted amazing!!

Awesome recipe. Used a little more garlic, half-salt butter, omitted garlic salt, added a dash of salt, and only a sprinkle of paprika. Very flavorful, and not too salty!

It came out awesome. I improvised a little and put garlic powerder instead of salt and omitted the paprika. I also added 3 tablespoons of minced garlic, a garlic grill seasoning, and regular salt. since I didnt have much parmesan, I used about 3 tablespoons. This recipe was for my fettucine, broccolli, and shrimp pasta. ITS DELICIOUS

Awesome! It's been hit or miss trying to make my own garlic bread, but the is perfect. Tastes just like the store-bought kind that my husband loves!  I subbed garlic powder for the minced variety, and it tasted just great! Thank you for sharing!

Wow is this stuff good! I used salted butter and only 1 tsp of garlic pdr and it was still a little to salty. Not salty enough not to eat... it's way to good to throw out! I only used one clove of garlic. It was great on our steaks and baked potatos!

This is some tasty garlic butter spread. I normally buy  the pre-made store garlic bread but since food prices has been on the rise I decided to make my own garlic bread with cheaper loaves this past Xmas season. The only thing i omitted was fresh garlic and subbed it with roasted garlic granules.

I loved this recipe!  Even my picky daughter was impressed!  I used it to spread on pieces of Italian crusty bread, and also, melted some to spread on the crust of my pizza dough.  It was awesome!!

Easy and yummy. I had to use A Lot of garlic salt and granulated garlic to get it as potent as I wanted it. I'll try real garlic next time.

I made this last week for a garden party I had. I did not have italian seasoning or paprika on hand, so I had to omit them. It still tasted so good! I used the butter for our corn on the cob we grilled. I just buttered the corn, added some thyme leaves, and wrapped them in foil. Everyone was raving about it. We used the remaining butter for just about everything else!

So versatile!  WE didn't care for it on bread, but i've put it in potatoes, on corn, it made InCREDIBLY easy buttered noodles.  I've decided i'm going to keep this on hand. I used garlic powder instead of salt and halved the itatlion seasoning and paprika.

Found the recipe to be very bland. So my wife and I used 6 cloves of garlic and it came out great. We will use this recipe for our garlic bread and grilled steaks. A helpful reminder to all, 2 sticks of butter equal 1 cup.

very good cut out the garlic salt I try not to use salt in things I dont have to.  I find it a little strong on bread if not put under the broiler and just used as a spread.

This was awesome!  Who would buy store bought garlic bread again after trying this?!  I halved the recipe to make a loaf of garlic bread and cut the 1/2 tsp. of garlic salt down to 1/4 tsp. just to cut down on the salt.  HIGHLY recommend!

This made really good garlic bread. I may never buy pre-made garlic bread again. I scaled the recipe to 4 servings (just my husband and me), but it made more like 6 servings. I used light butter, omitted the garlic salt and it was just as delicious.

I have been making this recipe for a while now and it is the best garlic butter I ever tasted. I make the recipe as is without any changes and we love it. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe. I didn't have the minced garlic so I just left it out. It was still great. I used the left over butter in mashed potatoes the next day. Will be making this again and again.

Superb.  I used freshly grated parmesan because there is so much more flavor.  This stores great in the fridge/freezer.  Now when I make mashed potatoes or steamed veggies I just grab a tablespoon and add it in and "instant flavor".

Mmm, Mmm, Good!  I just made this for the first time and I love it!!  I did halve the garlic salt amount just to be safe (due to other's suggestions), and it was perfect! Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this garlic butter, I made one change and that was instead of garlic salt I used garlic powder and just a pinch of regular salt. I've only used it for garlic toast so far but I don't think I'd buy garlic bread again.

I didn't have all the ingredients so I ommitted the minced garlic, ground pepper, and paprika, but I must say I that loved the outcome! It was SO yummy! I scaled it 8 servings which is 1/2 cup of butter which I spread on a loaf of french bread that was cut in half lengthwise and put it under the broiler for a few minutes. My husband and I gobbled it up!

I took this recipe to a Christmas party with artisan bread, and it was a huge hit.  I omitted garlic salt, because I didn't have any and added a touch of sea salt.  Turned out great!

I used this recipe in a crunch to make a loaf of garlic bread. I wasn't a huge gan of the parm chees it made for a odd texture. I think this would be a great spread without.

Was pretty good. I used margarine & cut it back to 8 servings. It made enough to coat each side of 8 pieces of bread generously. I didn't have any garlic salt on hand so I just used garlic powder and added a little salt. Two things I will do differently next time: lessen or omit all together the Italian seasoning (I always think Italian seasoning gives food a freezer burn taste) and I will add more garlic. Other than that, it was okay. Next time will be AWESOME I think though!

This was surprisingly good. Scaled the recipe down to 4 and added half a teaspoon of oregano for that extra zing. Also added half a teaspoon more of minced garlic and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Used unsalted butter, and added only quarter teaspoon of salt, and it was just right. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe! *** Edit: Made again and used one whole roasted garlic with the ingredients scaled down to 4. Even better, I think.

I made this for a family gathering. I left out the last two ingredients of black pepper and paprika because they just didn't sound like they went with garlic butter. Everyone loved it! I thought it was a little too salty, so I'd probably cut back on the garlic salt a little.

I needed to find a good garlic butter recipe to accompany an Italian dinner that I have prepared for a friend, and came upon this one.  I struck gold!!  I roasted some fresh garlic and omitted the paprika (didn't have any), and it turned out PERFECT.  It adds an intense garlic spicy flavor similar to what you would find in a restaurant.  Thanks for the post- this simple recipe is now taped to the inside of my spice cabinet for easy reference next time I need it!

This was too salty for my taste, from using salted butter, salty parmesan cheese AND garlic salt. Garlic POWDER or better yet, fresh garlic is a much better idea.  Pretty tasty with these adjustments.

This is fabulous. I actually reduced the amount of garlic salt based on the reviews. However, because I used unsalted butter, the recipe could have handled a bit more than I went with. I will play around with the salt levels but this has definitely earned its place in my recipe book. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good! Very garlicky but very good! I used the spread on slices on italian bread, and place it in the oven at 350 for 7 minutes, then turned the broiler on for about 2 minutes.  They came out perfect! Crunchy on the edges and soft and buttery in the middle! YUMMMM!!!

This makes great garlic bread.  I use margarine and then spread on store bought sub rolls which have been sliced lengthwise.  I close them and freeze for easy use.  Just pop in the microwave for 30-45 seconds (enough to open the split roll) and bake about 10 mins and then broil for about 3 minutes. Tasty and less expensive than Texas Toast.

I saved this in my recipe months ago and just finally used it.  I didn't even have the parmesan and it was sooo good!  Usually my husband is the garlic bread addict, but I was pretty excited about this too.  I cut the recipe in half and it was perfect for one big loaf of french bread.

My original review was 3 stars and my comment was that I didn't like the Italian Seasoning taste in the butter.  I decided to give this recipe another try and am glad I did.  I am Canadian, and we have a spice mix called "Italiano" (made by Club House).  It is ground up finer than traditional Italian Seasoning and tastes way milder.  The rest of the recipe was the same except for I used 1 tsp of garlic salt rather than 1 tbsp.  I also whipped it a bit with my hand blender (due to another person's comments about not liking the texture of the parmesan cheese).  It was awesome, tasted restaurant quality, but rating it 4 stars as even with the reduced garlic salt, it definitely was still a bit too salty.  Next time I will use garlic powder and unsalted butter.  Other than that, this recipe is a keeper.

Super quick, easy, yummy garlic bread!  I think I will use mozzarella cheese in place of most of the parm next time though.  Also will try using fresh basil and oregano just because I have an abundance of those in my garden right now for the dried Italian seasoning next time.  Great and super quick as is though.

Yummy! I had some slices of Italian bread that I wanted to use up before it got stale. I spread them with this garlic butter, warmed them in the oven just until the butter started to melt, then broiled them until they were browned. They were a hit. Thanks for the recipe!

I halved the recipe but otherwise followed it.  I put it on some broccoli and on the Best Bread Machine Bread from this site.  Very good!

I liked this recipe, but would have preferred mozzarella to parmesan cheese. I will also add more garlic next time (not that it wasn't enough, I just love garlic!). I plan on trying this again with my own tweaks.

Very good on garlic bread. I'm not sure how it will taste on other foods. It seems very garlicy.

I used this recipe to make some garlic bread as well as to flavor the pasta and vegetables we had with our dinner.  It tasted great.  I love garlic so I could probably even add more garlic and spice to it and would think it was even better.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy! We really liked this recipe. We tried this with some pasta fagioli soup. It was a great addition to our Italian themed night. It was a little salty for my taste. Next time we will use less garlic salt.

Very Good!  I made homemade italion bread and did not have time to bake it with garlic butter on it, so I served this butter at the table with the fresh bread.  It went over really well, my company and my kids loved it!  Thanks.

Love this! I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic because my kids don't like "stuff" on their food, but I could go either way. I also cut the garlic salt in half but I wouldn't omit it personally; I think it tastes better with just a touch of salt. I will definitely use this recipe again & again! Thanks!

I came up with a similar recipe years ago and make it quite often.  It is really tasty and beats store bought garlic spread by a mile!  Sometimes I add the smallest dash of Worcestershire Sauce in with the mixture--nice addition!

This was yummy! Spread on french bread slices and broil. I did substitute plain garlic powder for the garlic salt but it came out a little too bland. Im going to try 1/2 and 1/2 next time. Try this on a baked potato!

Wonderful recipe!  This is the best homemade garlic butter I've ever tried.  
Try to use it all withing a day or so. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 only because all of it must be used rather quickly.  Leftovers did not seem to last too long.

Like many others, I had cut way back on the garlic salt, only used 1 tsp and substituted garlic powder for the remainder.  It was still too salty for my taste.  However, I will make it again and eliminate the salt completely, or perhaps just add a pinch of kosher salt to the mix.  Also, I used a garlic press instead of mincing the garlic which added a whole lot more flavor, but only required two large cloves.  Make it a few hours ahead of time and give the flavors a chance to meld – you won’t be disappointed.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is absolutely the best!  I participated in a cooking(grilling) competition at my job.  I got it to add to some veggies we were cooking on the grill.  We also added it to some fresh baked sliced baggettes which we also grilled.  What can I say...we won the competition($100 a piece per team member).  I later kept the left overs and used it on some home fries I made for breakfast...I love this!

The only reason this did not get 5 stars is that it was OBCENELY salty!  I only used 1 tsp. instead of the 1 Tablespoon of garlic salt and it was still too salty for our taste.  I wish I'd read the reviews beforehand.  Anyway, without the garlic salt, this is a great recipe which will become our standard for garlic bread and more!

It is becoming pretty redundant... but this stuff is freaking AWESOME! I feel like I am going to gain 20 pounds with this discovery, because it will be a regular in our house!

this is WONDERFUL!!!  I doubled the recipe, and keep it in the fridge now so that I can make fresh garlic bread at a moments notice.  Even cheap bread tastes great with this yummy garlic butter spread.

This is the best garlic butter I have ever tasted! I did take other's suggestions and used less salt. I also added a little extra parmesan cheese. We had this on some fresh italian bread with our dinner tonight and my husband said it was better than the garlic butter he absolutely loves at our favorite steak restaurant.

Excellent!!  I did not have time to go grocery shopping this past week and was making due with what I had.  I made the garlic butter and brushed on white bread slices (one side.)  I then broiled the bread lightly and the taste was excellent.  Served with Lori's Beef and Spaghetti Macaroni from this site.  Thanks for helping me out with a great recipe!

The flavor was good but I should have read more reviews before making this!  It was very salty when used for garlic bread.  I think the suggestions to substitute garlic powder for the garlic salt would have made it perfect.  However, I do have some of the garlic butter left and will try in on potatoes as one reviewer suggested.

I had a taste for something quick and desparately wanted some buttered noodles.  After looking at this recipe it sounded PERFECT!  Added some sour cream and buttermilk to the noodles to help everything stick even more and all I could say was YUMMY!

This is simply awesome. I saved and refrigerated the leftover butter and keep finding reasons to use it.  I omitted the italian seasoning as I didn't have any, and it was STILL awesome!

I was in a pinch for garlic bread for dinner. The only thing I had was some refrigerated rolls to bake. I made this butter for them and I'm not sure anyone could tell me what else was on the table. This is a keeper and soooo easy.

Excellent recipe! I've made it several times. I like garlic so much that once, I roughly doubled the minced garlic than it calls for, but I found that it was really too much. I've stuck to the recipe faithfully ever since, and have never been disappointed.

Everyone thought it was way to salty.  I will use this again, but I'm going to use 1/2 of the salt, 1/2 of the italian seasoning and more garlic, butter and parmesan.

This is wonderful!  We always have some on hand and eat it with almost every evening meal.  I used margarine and taste no difference.  Grated parmesan works much better than shredded if you are store buying.

Holy cow!!!  Who woulda thought that a garlic butter sauce could be this dang good?  I made about a fourth of a cup and pureed it at high speed with a handheld blender.  I poured it over quartered red potatos and microwaved it for 7 mins, stirring it about half way through.  Made a great, quick, and easy side dish.

Very good. I've made it twice with varying amounts of garlic salt. I would say add salt to your taste.

This garlic butter is very good. I spread it on a pizza crust to make garlic wedges. I used garlic powder instead of the minced garlic because I didn't want a strong garlic flavor and omitted the salt because I figured it would be salty enough with the parmesan cheese. I would definitely make it the same way again!

Outstanding! I left out the Italian Seasoning since I don't care for it. This butter was great on my homemade loaf of Italian Bread.

Excellent! I added more garlic, of course, but I placed dollops on top of the Savory Garlic Marinated Steaks as they were cooking...wonderful! I have frozen a batch to use as needed.

So good and so easy.  I made this a couple of hours before I needed it to let the flavours blend and it was amazing.  I used it for homemade galic bread and my husband raved and I ate way too much!!  It was so worth it though.  I will never buy garlic bread again!  It will also be good to put on so many other things I can't wait to try it out!!

Pretty good!  We served it at room temperature with italian bread since we had some people that didn't like garlic at our party...I will try again making it as garlic bread and I think it will taste even better!
