I should have known this was going to be delicious. Chef John has never let me down. This was an easy recipe with fabulous results. The only change I made was to leave out the Cayan Pepper. Thanks Chef John. You (and your recipes) are the best.

I've never made a brisket before,  so I followed Chef John's recipe to the letter.  Served it to some  guests and the raves are still coming in.  Juicy, very flavorful and tender.  Too bad I couldn't give this a 10 star  rating.

I will most definitely make this beef brisket again soon!  I followed the instructions without any changes except that I didn't have the Rosemary and omitted cayenne pepper as we don't like cayenne pepper, and everyone loved the brisket.

This was delish! I did everything as written, only I only used a dash of cayanne, because we aren't huge on spicy food. YUM! Thanks!

Amazing and easy. Made exactly as written. I used a whole brisket and it took about 3 hours on the low setting. The gravy is delicious. Thanks Chef John.

This recipe came out wonderfully for Christmas dinner. Followed the recipe but doubled the ingredients for a whole brisket and added 90 minutes of cooking time. Thank you Chef John for a wonderful meal!

Made exactly as described, and it was phenomenal (but Iâ€™ve come to expect that from Chef John!). Fork tender with a delicious, savory gravy. Highly recommend!
