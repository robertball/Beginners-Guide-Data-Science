I really liked these. I messed them up the first time because I didn't follow the instructions carefully enough. Make positively sure the egg whites are a ROOM TEMPERATURE! They won't get the consistency that's required if you don't. Also, unless you have a stand-up mixer, you will kill your arms. I put the mixture with the whisk attachment on my KitchenAid (on FULL BLAST) for a full 5 or 10 minutes to get the right texture. (Did I say make sure the whites should be at room temperature--LOL). Another great tool for these cookies is a cookie scoop. I don't use mine much, but it was invaluable for these. My last suggestion is to cut the amount of sugar. I used the 1 & 1/4 cup amount the first time and they were a bit too sweet (and I LOVE sweet). I reduced the sugar to a SCANT cup. Everyone loved them.

I was looking for a recipe that was similar to the one I used working in a bakery. This was the closest. It is a good replica to what I used to make. It comes out light and tall and not gooey like other recipes with condensed milk.  I was surprised to grease and flour the pan (prepare) as I have always used parchments before, but it worked very well. The macaroons must cool completely before removing and they just pop off. I dipped them in orange flavored chocolate and they were a hit! Enough to make for my daughters wedding reception. Word of caution...egg whites must be whipped in a very clean glass or metal bowl...with no oil or yolk, to get a high peak.

I just finished making these and they taste very good. I have a suggestion for those who had a hard time with the egg whites. Apparently you have to add the sugar in a steady stream on the side of the bowl. If you just dump it in (like I did) the bubbles in the egg whites will pop and the whole thing will be ruined. I'm going to try it again the right way!

These were delicious! I upped the amount of coconut to 3 cups for more chewiness and I lined the pan with waxed paper before dropping the cookie dough onto the cookie sheets. Very easy clean-up and saved the grease and flour step. Be sure to let the cookies completely cool before trying to remove them. They'll just peel off the waxed paper.

I have made two batches of these in as many days and everyone loves them, most of all, me!  I did tweak the recipe just a bit, as follows;
-egg whites at room temperature
-1 c. of sugar not 1 1/4
-I used unsweetened coconut
-I doubled the almond extract
-I added the extracts after the whites were whipped to stiff peaks
-I refrigerated the batter for about 1 hr. before putting the cookies on ungreased parchment paper to bake
-I got 20 cookies out of one recipe, and took the full 20 min. to bake them at 300.
HOPE YOU LIKE THEM AS MUCH AS WE DO!

Very nice little cookie, but definitely not a traditional macaroon. It's good, light and very sweet. I cut the recipe in half and that made more than enough little cookies.  These really didn't brown, even after I raised the oven temp. to 325.  I'm not sure I'd even want them to - next time I'll put a cherry in the center and make these at Xmas time.

I love these cookies...much lighter than condensed-milk macaroons, with a great consistency.  I replaced 1/2 cup of coconut with 1/2 cup of coarsely ground toasted almonds and it tasted fantastic!  I also toast the coconut before adding it to enhance to flavor.  However...this recipe does NOT make 48 servings...I barely got half that using heaping tablespoons of batter.  Highly recommended!

One word..."FABULOUS"!  This was my first attempt at making macaroons of any kind and they came out absolutely delicious.  Shape can be improved and probably should use a little bit less sugar but nonetheless, crunchy on the outside with chewy and moist center.

I whipped the egg whites in a small steel pot (took a good 15 minutes or so by hand), used only vanilla extract, and substituted creme of tartar for 3x the amount of lemon juice.  I was careful to fold in the dry ingredients into the stiff egg white and sugar mixture.

While baking, my spooned heapfuls stayed airy but became quite a bit flatter.  So, after about 8 minutes of baking, I removed the pan and using 2 spoons, reshaped them.  Maybe I will try to chill the mixture a little bit next time to see if shape holds better.  Although my macaroons do not quite look like the store bought macaroons I'd say mine came out tasting nicer.  I'll definitely use this recipe again!

Wow- this was the first macaroon recipie I've ever made- and I must admit, I was a little worried..now, as I sit here munching on one of the most heavenly cookies ever, I wonder why I was worried! Crispy on the outside, chewy in the center- they turn out a little more flat than I expected, but who cares when they taste so good!!

Very good, though a little sweet. Mine also took about 30 minutes to cook and never did get very 'golden.' Great texture, will probably cut down on the sugar a bit next time. Thanks!

Terrific recipe!  The hint of almond flavoring makes it perfect.  The cookies turn out moist and tender.  I used a fork to spoon the dough onto foiled lined cookie sheets (shiny side down or the cookies will reflect too much heat and brown too quickly.)  Then i can form it into more of a circle with the fork and make a little dent in the top for the candied cherry.  Once the cookies cool completely, they peel right off the foil.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a real macaroon recipe!  Freshly whipped egg whites, rather than sweetened condensed milk.. just the way I like.  The only thing I changed was to decrease the sugar to only 1/4 cup - because I used sweetened flaked/shredded coconut.  It's plenty sweet, although I like my desserts to be not *too* sweet. :)  I baked for 20 minutes (and turned the trays halfway through), but they were barely browning.  So, I increased the temperature to 350 for an additional 2 minutes, and it did the trick.  I baked them on parchment paper that I had smeared with a little bit of vegetable oil (using a paper towel).  After they had cooled, they came off simply.  I drizzled mine with melted semi-sweet chocolate..  divine!  Thank you for this recipe. .  I had been searching for it.

Absoloutely delicious recipe! In less than a week I've already made two batches of these, neither of which has lasted more than a day or two.

The steps were easy to follow, easier than even a traditional cookie recipe. As suggested by other reviewers, I made sure that my egg whites were almost room temperature when I whipped them and added my sugar in a steady (but slow!) stream at the side of my bowl. Didn't have any problems getting my whites to whip up. Although I did end up baking them for much less time than recommended: both times my Macaroons were baked in 10 minutes or less.

The cookies came out light and delicous, one of my favourite recipes yet. I would recommend this to anyone craving a quick, sweet treat! :)

I have to say these tasted a lot better than the last Macaroon recipe I used from this site called "Coconut Macaroons", but the consistency was not right.  I added extra coconut to try and help it, but they were way too soft & needed probably an extra 1/4 cup of flour and 1 cup of extra coconut.  My egg whites were very large, that may be part of the reason, but still I think something needs to be adjusted.  The flavor was very good though, I dipped them in dark chocolate, and for some I drizzled it over the top.  I have to say WITH modifications I will consider making this again, but for the recipe on it's own, I have to give it 3 stars....sorry.

Use medium egg whites or you may find yourself with a meringue with coconut instead of a coconut macaroon.

This is soooo delish I can't stop eating them.  And it was very easy to make.  It held it's shape and browned so nicely.  I could only find sweetened coconut flakes so I used the whole bag, about 3 cups and lessened the sugar to 2/3 cup.  I also added about 1/2 cup of small chocolate chips and it is wonderful.  I added the chips to the coconut flour mixture and folded in the egg whites.  I will definitely make this again.  Tastes better than Mounds.  Also, I used parchment paper and had not problems taking these off the sheet without grease and flour or spray.

I made these yesterday for a neighbor's BBQ. Most of the guests were older and have a better appreciation for this classic cookie. They loved my macaroons. They turned out great, but I did use wax paper like suggested and tehy were tricky to get off the wax paper. I will try to grease the cookie sheet next time. I also used sweeted coconut and used only a half cup of sugar and they were perfectly sweet (at least to my palette) I will make these again really soon, maybe for the Mother in Law. Thank you for a great recipe!

Great Recipe! 
I had a couple of egg whites to use up, and thought I'd give this a try. So glad I did. Made a 1/2 recipe and they are not only picture perfect, but the taste is perfection. This is going into my list of favorites.

Thanks for posting Juanita

This is  the the macaroon recipe I have been searching for!   Perfect for using those leftover egg whites.  Next time I will increase the coconut by 1/2 cup to try to get that "haystack" look. Mine rounded out more like a cookie.

These were so good!  I baked them for about 24 minutes at 300 degrees so they would turn out a bit firmer.   I couldn't find unsweetened shredded coconut, so I only used about 1/3c sugar with sweetened shredded coconut. I don't think these cookies will brown (mine came out lily-white), so if you want them to look like traditional macaroons you're going to want to toast the coconut.  Very nice recipe!

I had been looking for a recipe like this for a long time. These are soooooooo good. They taste very close to the ones my mom bought from local pastry stores.I used unsweetened coconut and added more coconut than the recipe called for until the dough was thick and all I could see was coconut. Very tast. Thank you.

I really like this recipe.  It is not so heavy, sticky sweet like some recipes.  It is lighter, more "meringuey" than other recipes.  I did take another reviewer's advice and add almond extract to the recipe and people raved about them.  Highly recommended!

I tried what a previous reviewer suggested and added a candied cherry on top.  The cookies turned out so pretty and they are new family favorite- I can't keep the kids away from them.  These were also surprisingly easy and quick to put together- a  keeper.

Delicious! Took advice from others and added less sugar. Also refrigerated 1 hr. so they would better hold their shape. Drizzled milk chocolate over them once they'd cooled. Very good!!

These cookies are absolutely delightful and very easy to make.  I took the recommendations of others and used only 1 cup of sugar, refrigerated the dough for approximately 2 hours and used parchment paper while baking.  I don't know if I made them too large, though because I only got 28 out of the batch rather than the 48 the recipes said you would get.  Just means I'll have to bake up another batch tomorrow cause I know these won't last until tonight.  Thanks for a keeper.

Wonderful! These are always a huge hit when I bring them to potlucks. Everyone always asks for the recipe. They're not like the usual macaroon. They're lighter with less coconut. Everyone tells me that this is exactly why they love them so much.

These macaroons were awesome!  The only thing I would not do again is flour my pan.  The first batch stuck a little to the pan. I used baking spray the second time and they came right off. So, either baking spray or wax paper would work better than the flour.  Taste, texture and overall rating is JUST GREAT!!!  MAKE THEM, you won't be sorry!

This recipe was very easy and unlike some of the other reviewer, I did not have any difficulty getting my egg white stiff (room temp egg whites work best).  Everyone seemed to love the flavor of this recipe, but it was way to sweet for my liking.

I just made these and they taste amazing..love the chewy texture inside and crispy outside...Mine did brown unlike some of the other reviews I have read but they did not turn out like this picture. They are flatter...next time I will make them smaller than the heaping tablespoon they call for so I can have more little cookies. Thanks for the great tasting recipe!

Very good. I cut back on sugar to less than a cup. I also added ground almonds. Very nice macaroons that do not use condensed milk.

This was my first time making macaroons.  I read all the suggestions and was very nervous making.  They turned out great! Using the suggestions, I did only use 3 eggs since my were large. I used sweetened coconut, increasing to 3 cups and I did toast it first. I cut the sugar to 2/3 cup, perfectly sweet.   I greased & floured my pan and they came off perfectly. I used a cookie scoop and only yielded 30 cookies. They do come out quite white so I'm thankful I did toast the coconut.  I dipped half in dark chocolate and they are scrumptious!  This is a keeper!

I used a half cup more of sweetened coconut (slightly toasted beforehand), 1/4 cup less of sugar, 1/4 tsp baking powder in lieu of cream of tartar, and baked on wax paper. I topped them with melted 85% cocoa extra dark chocolate, which gave a nice dark contrast to the sweet lightness of the macaroon itself. :)  Delish!

I was not happy with these. They came out flat and pale in color. The texture was chewy and hard. Flavor was decent. I had no trouble whipping the stiff peaks into the egg whites, however is it possible to over whip them? While the first batch was in the oven I kept the batter in the fridge hoping that would prevent the flatness. It didn't work. I may try these again someday, but for now I'm going to work on cakes. I seem to be better at that...

I'm not a HUGE coconut fan, but these were pretty good.  It was my first time making a macaroon.  These were very light and fluffy.  So simple to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and used another reviewers suggestion to make sure the egg whites were room temp.  I made them for a baby shower so I drizzled melted pink almond bark for a nice touch.  The only thing I may try different next time is to add a bit more coconut.  Mine looked like white clouds.  I would like them to have more of a "haystack" look next time.

These were wonderful and look amazing which is important in my cafe!  A couple of hints:  1) Use an icecream scoop with the release mode to scoop out even and round macaroons 2) To make them even prettier, add a cherry to the top before cooking 3) to make them even more WOW, drizzle them with chocolate when they come out of the oven.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These are the best. I didn't have any almond extract so I substituted pineapple and made pina colada instead. Instead of cookies, I baked them in mini cupcake pans and took them to church and returned home with an empty cookie tin. Delish!!!

Beware! These are so good, you might not be able to stop eating them. I just made a batch and already I have eaten 4, they are so yummy. They are a very delicate cookie made by whipping egg whites into a meringue type batter. The cookies are moist and soft--not crisp like a meringue cookie. Much lighter than the dense chewy macaroons made with sweetened condensed milk. I followed the directions exactly as written and they came out great. The only thing was I baked them about 10 minutes longer.

Very good recipe. I followed some of the suggestions on the reviews and reduced the sugar to 3/4 of a cup and they were plenty sweet enough. I also added a marchino cherry to the tops of some and on others melted some semi sweet chocolate for the tops. It was a very good recipe, I will definetely make them again.

I was disappointed.  Too sweet, didn't brown in 300 deg oven, not what I consider a macaroon.  After tasting the first batch to come out of the oven, I added another cup of coconut to the rest of the batter, they needed more coconut.  I used sweetened coconut as there is no unsweetened coconut available in the store.  Apparently the recipe should state "unsweetened flaked coconut" because these were horrendously sweet.  So, if using sweetened coconut, cut the sugar WAY back.  All-in-all, save yourself some trouble and pass on this recipe.  There are better ones out there.

I give this 4 stars because I didn't like them at all but everyone at my husband's office LOVED them! lol They were easy to make and I reduced the sugar as suggested but I don't think I should have. I also used sweetened coconut. (Yes I have a big sweet tooth) As an added touch I drizzled melted semi-sweet cocolate on top then sprinkled crumbled Andes creme de menthe candies on top!

I love, love, love coconut macaroons.  These are great!  I was worried that I didn't beat the egg whites enough, but they turned out perfect.  I did switch to a smaller scoop for the second batch and decrease to 1 cup sugar.  I also added 1/3 cup finely chopped almonds into the flour mixture. The small scoop is about 2 tsp.  I also baked until light brown around the base and then moved them to the top rack until golden. These are fluffy and chewy and so yummy!  Thanks!

These were very good. I decreased the amount of sugar by about 1/2 a cup because I used sweetened coconut shreds. I also added more coconut than the recipe called for because I wanted it more chewy rather than hard and meringe-like. I baked it for 18 minutes and then put it under the boiler for another 2-3 minutes just to brown the top. 

Then dipped half of it in chocolate and laced the chocolate portion with a bit of coconut shreds. 

Came out beautiful!

Maybe it was just me...but these cookies came out almost flat as a board. I found it difficult to deal with the whipped eggs two times after they were whipped.  I couldn't tell what consistancy they were suppose to be at each different stage. They probably had the air worked out them.

Not quite what I was looking for in a macaroon. The flavor was very nice but they were more like a coconut merangue.

Not the best recipe.  It was really airy and practically hollow.  I was looking for something a bit more dense.  My little ones loved them though.

These cookies were really good but,the recipe never told you when to add the salt,almond or vanilla flavoring.I could'nt seem to get the mixture to form soft peaks so my dough was runny and my cookies never formed or browned.I wish I knew what I did wrong because the flavor was sooo good.

I made these Macaroons for a bake sale. I had my husband try them and they turned out excellent.  

2 things that I had to do to the recipe is add another 1/4cup of flour and Bake it at 350.  Changing the batter it was still somewhat thin, but they turned out good.

I would definitely make them again.

I'm always trying different macaroon recipes and just can't find that "one" Finally found it! These are without a doubt the best I ever made! I think I went a little heavy on the coconut but I just love coconut! Oh, and I do think parchment paper works better than a greased pan!

I might leave the almond extract out next time. As it was I only used 1/8 tsp and I still felt it was a bit strong, but I'm not terribly partial to almond extract in the first place. I also had them flatten out a bit on me even though I put the batter in the fridge for an hour before cooking. The egg whites were as still as I could get them. Maybe more coconut next time? Also, they stuck to the pans a bit. I used a non-stick pan and followed the directions about butter and flour. Next time I think I'll buttering and flouring parchment paper and see if that helps. I'll try them again though. Nice and crispy on the outside, chewy in the middle.

Finally a trust-worthy coconut macaroon recipe that uses 4 egg whites! I always make a unflavored gelatin salad around the holidays that uses 4 egg yolks.  I've been trying out macaroon recipes every year for many years and was never satisfied until now.  This one is a keeper.  I made it without making any changes or additions.

My daughter which is a coconut fanatic LOVES these cookies! Thank you for the recipe. They were very light and delicious. I used every suggestion in the other reviews to get them to stay puffy, to no avail. they were somewhat flattened but still very good.

Turned out reallly tasty. Followed what others said and added a bit less sugar, i also opted for 1 tsp lemon juice instead of cream of tartar since I don't have it (and I was halfing the recipe, and they turned out without lemon flavor, :) They did flatten out a little bit, but not bad. Also, I put them on a pan greased and covered with corn starch instead of flour and they came off just fine, fresh outta the oven (i like to eat them warm AND i have a small oven so i had to use the same pan twice). Only thing i'll do next time is drizzle dark chocolate on top!!!

I reduced the sugar to 1c. It might help to use eggs that are at room temperature and also, toast the coconut before hand to enhance the flavor.

I think these taseted great!  I am looking for a thicker type of macaroon, like a bakery in town.  These did deflate a little bit, but tasted very good!! Oh, I did reduce the amount of sugar to about 3/4 C and did use sweented cococut.  They were still sweet.  I might try to reduce the sugar some more next time.

Tasty but too much sugar. I used less than 1/4C sugar and sweetened coconut. That's already very sweet.

This was my first attempt at macaroons.  I wanted to make something different for the cookie exchange at work.  This was so easy. I bought sweetened coconut so I cut back the sugar to 1/3 of a cup.

I just made this recipe and while they taste very good, they don't look like macaroons, but more like flat coconut meringues. If I try again, I may add more coconut and maybe chill for a bit to see if they hold their shape better.  I was really hoping for macaroons like you buy in the store so it was a bit disappointing when I took my first pan out of the oven and they were no where close to that.  Taste gets a 5, shape gets a 3.

These were wonderful macaroons! I did feel that the recipe calls for way to much sugar, so I cut it down to 1 cup. I also used half unsweetened coconut and half sweetened. I added about 1/2 cup of extra unsweetened coconut for more flavor. My family absolutely loved these; I will be making them again!

These were OK. However, I felt there was too much egg and not enough coconut. It came out more like a meringue with coconut in it.   I added a splash of lemon juice instead of almond extract and about 1 tsp of nutmeg. The flavor was good, I was just a little disappointed with the consistency.

This recipe is fantastic! WAY better than Coconut Macaroons III recipe from this site. I would not recommend any macaroon recipe that calls for condensed milk. It's a nifty shortcut, but you will be sorry you took it; the taste is overwhelming and obnoxious. I loved how these macaroon cookies turned out. It's true - they are more like meringue cookies, not exactly what I was looking for, but still delicious. I used unsweetened coconut and they were plenty sweet. Also, on an advice from another reviewer I added 50% more coconut to each portion hoping they would hold their shape better, but they still turned out quite flat like cookies, although I was happy with the result anyway. Melted chocolate drizzle on top - is a must.

I was craving a coconut cookie, but was almost out of butter so I tried these.  They did not disappoint.  A little crunchy on the edges and soft and chewy in the middle...  I followed some other's advice...  I used 1/2 c ground almonds instead of the almond extract. (I liked the added texture that came from the almonds.) I threw in about 1/2 tsp of coconut extract.  I didn't have cream of tarter so I substituted a good squeeze (1 tsp?) of fresh lemon juice.  I upped the flour to 1/2 c and was very generous with my cups of coconut.  I wasn't paying attention and I dumped the sugar into the flour/coconut mixture before I whipped the egg whites... Luckily I had only put in about 3/4 c, so I went ahead and whipped about 1/4 c into the whites, not sure why, other than peace of mind.  I used a 2 tsp-ish cookie scoop and got 41 cookies.  I baked them 10 min on the middle rack and let them finish on the top rack (about 8-10 more min).  They browned up nicely, but were a little smoother in appearance than the photo.  Next time I might try rolling them in a little coconut before I bake them, just for appearance.  Love that they are a bit healthier than most.  Will make them again.  They would be heavenly with a whole almond on top and drizzled with chocolate!

Mine are just coming out of the oven now - they're not 'spiky' like other macaroon recipes I've tried, but they're elegantly smooth, and just melt in the mouth.  The outside is a little crunchy and the inside is chewy and coconutty.  So good!  I'm drizzling semi-sweet chocolate on the tops and taking them to a brunch!  The only things I altered were using sweetened coconut and baking on German parchment paper.

Not bad tasting but nothing like a macaroon, more like a meringue with coconut in it. Hard to eat because it is so flaky.

These are the Best!!!  They looked like little fluffy pillows when they came out.  Was not too happy the first time I made them, but did'nt whip the whites long enough.  This time it was wonderful.  Thanks

These were really yummy, but not the kind of macaroon that I'm used to.  This turned out to be more of a meringue with coconut in it.  I think there was too much egg white in the recipe, and/or not enough coconut.

They were tasty but DEFINITELY not what i had in mind. Mine looked like what some other reviewers have termed Coconut Merengues.  I was expecting what was shown in the pic, a nice chewy macaroon, they are hard as rocks today 
:( probably will not try again.

this recipe was Awsome, I had no problems with it, I thought that I had made the meringue to stiff, but it was perfect and then I used the spray grease with the flour in it on the pan and then I used a Icecream scoop to drop on to the pan and it cooked perfectly and did not stick to the pan at all!   Thank you for this recipe it is one of my new favorites now!

These are very tasty. I added some more almond extract, but I do think the baking time needs to be a tad longer.

The absolute best cookie I have ever eaten.  I can not believe how easy something so amazingly delicious was to make.  I was worried about whipping the egg whites so I did my research and made sure I didn't use my usual plastic bowl and instead used a glass one.  They were beautiful and tasted like the ones my mom used to bring home from the bakery when I was a kid.  If you like macaroons, TRY THIS RECIPE.

these turned out like a coconut chewy center encased in a merang outside, well whatever it was they were really yummy and a hit with all the people that tried them! I would make again but maybe cut down on the sugar a bit next time.

This was a great recipe.  But, it was different from other macaroon recipes in that it was like a macaroon encased in a meringue puff.  They were a hit with my husband.

These were really easy to make and sooo yummy - just what I was after.  I cut down the sugar to 1 cup and next time I'll cut it down a bit more as they are a wee bit sweet for me but otherwise this is a great recipe.

These are pretty bad. The outside was hard and chalk-like. They are almost inedible. The cocunut is good, but everything else about this cookie is horrible.

These were a real treat.  I used an airbake cookie sheet for the first bacth and would advise against it.  The second time I switched sheets and with light greasing and flouring they slid right off!  They had a great flavor and consistency and looked like pieces of heaven after I wrapped them for a bake sale.  My first and last macaroon recipe.

Excellent recipe!  Not your traditional macaroon.  More of a coconut meringue.  Light and delicate cookie with a sweet and toasty flavor.  A definite keeper!  Keep your drops high and small for easier removal from pan.

These are tasty cookies but not your typical macaroon.  The consistancy is somewhat of a combination of a macaroon and a meringue.

I used A 24 oz bag of sweetened coconut flakes that I had on hand.  After looking at the other reviews, I  used the whole bag.  Also had no cream of tartar so substituted 1/4 tsp lemon juice.  I had no trouble with the meringue -  I used the regular paddle in my KitchenAid at top speed and had firm egg whites in just a couple of minutes with cold egg whites.  I  added chocolate chips, used a medium cookie scoop, and baked at 325 for 20 Minutes and turned off the oven and left them for another 20 minutes or so to cook through and finish toasting.  They came out beautifully.  Toasty brown and round and were the best tasting macaroons ever!

Perfect christmas time cookie, should have doubled the batch. Turned out light, perfect sweetness and were not gooey like the condensed milk recipe. These are the macaroons I had as a kid when people didn't use shortcuts to make the recipe easier.

I haven't actually made these cookies. My father is staying with me and he is type 1 diabetic. I wonder if anyone has made these using Truvia baking "sugar"?  I made some macaroons for him last week (he loves coconut) but that recipe didn't use flour or cornstarch. They weren't bad but not really what I was hoping for.

IT was too sweet for my tastebuds, actually the whole family. I followed the recipe as it was my first time making macaroons. I guess i did something wrong at the egg stage as they spread in the oven and looked more like macaroon cookies. Were chewy like cookies, the texture I think needed less sugar and more coconut and maybe a little more flour............next I will experiment............will come back when I have done so...............

Wonderful cookie, I love the fact that it uses simple basic ingredients, not a can of this or a box that, also a great way to use up extra egg whites,(used the yolks to make noodles) I will definitely make these again.

I tried this recipe today for a cookie exchange but I must have done something wrong, they did not look like macaroons nor taste like a good macaroon.  I measured all ingredients exactly.  Maybe, my idea of Stiff Egg Whites is wrong.  When the eggs whites stood up without falling, I thought this was stiff. The did not get done in 18-20 minutes in a 300 degree over. The macaroons were flat,sticky, and tasteless.  I am not through with Macaroons, but I will try another recipe next time.  I ended up making Rum Balls for the exchange. I had a previously used recipe for them. I would rather not rate the recipe since it may have been my problem, but I have to to send.  Clint

I wanted to get a little more color on these and they ended up being a tad dry. My fault. Dipped bottom in milk chocolate then chopped toasted almonds.

Love these.  Make them all the time so better share a review. A sweet, weightless, treat. I make them small - 20 to a large cookie sheet.  They freeze beautifully in zip locks then in tupperware to protect them.  Very different but just as good as the heavy chewy version macaroon that uses sweetened condensed milk.  But more elegant if you are doing a special event or tea

Really good.  Would have given 5 stars but I added a 1/2 cup more coconut and  1/2 tsp more vanilla. Make these for sure!

I started by following the recipe as written, minus a little suger since I was using sweetened coconut. After I had combined everything it was very obvious that there was far to little coconut for this to make macaroons so I added about another cup and a half of coconut. It still looked a little to meringue cookie instead of macaroon but I gave it a try. The first batch I left in a little over the 20 min. because it wasn't browning. When I took them out I had a crisp meringue cookie with a bit of chewy coconut in the middle. The second batch I took out before they crisped and ended up with slightly undercooked meringue cookie that was reminisent of a macaroon. As a meringue cookie with some coconut I would rate this 3 stars, because it was ok, just not great even if you aren't wanting macaroons. If you want macaroons this recipe would have negative stars. I gave it 2 stars because they are ok cookies but they dont' come close to chewy, slightly sticky, toasted coconut delight that is a real macaroon.

Outstanding cookies, even the kids liked them and they don't like coconut very much.  They melted milk chocolate and put it on the ones they ate.  They never turned brown so when I took them out I hit them with with the blow torch and that browned them up quick.

It was way too sweet (even with only 1 cup of sugar). I don't know what's with me and not able to follow directions, but I blended in the flour instead of folding it. It made the batter extremely creamy so I ended up putting it in a muffin pan, and baked it at 350 for 20 min. This made it ridiculously difficult to get out (even with it oiled). However, it wasn't all that bad. I ended up flipping them over and dipping it in chocolate, then sprinkled it with coconut shavings (they were so ugly I couldn't stand it). Chilled them in the fridge - very sweet but not bad at all. However, I don't think I will make them again.

Great recipe for a change from the traditional, heavy sweetened condensed milk version of coconut macarrons. They are very light and fluffy. Many that tried them said they preferred this version!

Suggestions: Use only 3 eggs for chewier macaroons, instead of wheat flour use grounds almonds, use only 3/4 cup of sugar, use 2 tsp. vanilla extract, and 1.5 tsp. almond extract

These definitely need more coconut!  I made them as suggested with 3 cups coconut and more flour.  I think they could use even more coconut as they are still really meringue-like and didn't come out looking like the picture.  Yummy smells and good flavor, however!

These were so yummy.  I made sure that my egg whites were room temperature, increased the coconut to about 3 3/4 cups.  I also toasted the coconut.  I baked them using a silpat liner on top of my cookie sheets.  After they cooled for a few minutes, they slid right off.  They were very sweet, but delicious.  Next time I'll reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup.

The recipe as writtten is more like a meringue cookie.  They were ok, but a little sweet.  On the next batch I added 2 cups more of coconut and 1 cup slivered almonds.  Flattened a little before baking and the result was great.  More like a macaroon and a little crunchy on the edges.

I can tell these WOULD taste good if they had come out.  But they didn't.  I had read everyone's reviews about making sure the egg whites were room temperature, and made sure to beat the whites to form stiff peaks.  I think my cookies might have gone awry when I put them in the refrigerator like another reviewer said to do.  I will try them again and not do that.  The ones I made did not come off the waxed paper.  Maybe second time's a charm!

I decided to use the original recipe first.  Way too sweet.  I would cut back on the sugar (perhaps only 3/4 c) especially if you're using sweetened coconut.  I was going to drizzle dark chocolate onto these but that will make them way too sweet.  And I would agree with a few reviewers - these are more like meringues than macaroons.  Bake for 30 min instead of 20 if you're oven is cooler.

I tried three recipes for Macaroons this year after my 20 year old daughter decided she liked them.  I always stayed away from them thinking they were too hard to make.  After reading all of the comments and trying the recipes, my family has decided this one will be added to our collection.  It was the best testing and very easy!  The egg whites whipped up fine being at room temp and fresh.  I did use a 14 oz bag of coconut, reduced the sugar to a cup, and used parchment paper to cook on.  I also had to cook them at 325 for 18 minutes. GREAT Recipe!!

These were good, but not a traditional macaroon.  They were more like coconut mirengues (sp??).  They tasted good, but VERY sweet if you use sweetened coconut like I did.  You might want to cut the sugar down a bit.

A bit airy and fluffy compared to a traditional macaroon, but considering the nutritional info is GREAT, I will compromise on its consistency.

So quick and easy to whip together. I only had 3 egg whites so I used them, and cut the sugar to 1 cup. I increased the coconut slightly per some other reviews. They turned out moist and delicious - very nice! They were extremely sweet though, probably due to my coconut being sweetened (it was all I had).  I would make again. Thanks!

These cookies came out soooo flat and stuck to the cookie sheet. I was expecting a thicker macaroon. They taste good when they first come out but end up hard.  My husband ended up taking them out of the oven every 5 minutes to fluff them back up into a ball-then it looked like a macaroon but we didn't figure this out until our last batch was in. Definitly not what I expected-will not try again.

These looked great and tasted good, just not as moist as I like my macaroons.  Also, I did not have any cream of tartar so I just skipped that.  I beat the egg whites lightly as well.  On parchment paper they were fine and took about 16 minutes to cook nicely.  I think maybe next time I will try one of the macaroon recipes that calls for sweetened condensed milk.  I dipped half of these in dark chocolate to give them as gifts.

This recipe has a very nice taste, but just not quite what I had in mind for a macaroon, they turned a bit dry when they cooled completely.  I will make again and dip all in chocolate coating to try to maintain the moisture.  Thank you for your recipe!

By far the absolute best macaroon in the world.  They are light, chewy and taste like heaven.  Everyone that tasted them were impressed.

I'd give these four stars right out of 
the oven, BUT they ended up very hard 
and chewy once they cooled. I was disappointed they hardened up so much.

Very light in texture and very sweet. I cut the sugar down to 1 cup, but 3/4 cup would be enough. These are a nice cookie for company. I will surely make them again!

I needed a recipe for a gathering, this was wonderful! The only time consuming part is whipping egg whites, otherwise it is very easy! My husband couldn't stay out of them!!
Thanks for sharing this!!! Sharon

My batch turned out perfectly.  Remember that room temperature egg whites whip up better than cold ones... my cookies ended up like meringues on the outside, with a chewy center.

I had the same problem with not being able to whip the eggs into peaks.  My batter turned out runny, so I made a second batch with more flour (but did not like the cakey consistency).  The runny ones (alhough flat) were REALLY good!
