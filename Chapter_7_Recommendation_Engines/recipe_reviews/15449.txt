As others have suggested, I used Marla's Meatballs & Jessica's Sauce.  Didn't do anything different with the meatballs.  To the sauce, I added 1/2 pint of sour cream, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1 tsp fresh ground pepper, 2 tbls of creamy horseradish sauce, and fresh mushrooms sauteed in butter (just enough to shed some water).

Put everything in a slow cooker, set on three for 4 hours (Certainly doesn't have to cook that long, it was just easier that way. I put everything together over lunch so it would be ready for dinner).  Served over egg noodles along with French Bread & Ceaser Salad.

These were the best Swedish Meatballs I've ever had.  (That's saying something from a guy who grew up on the Iron Range of Northern MN.)  Thanks Jessica & Marla.  

PS:  I've got the combined recipies along with my additions saved on my computer.  If the original people don't mind, I'll post it as a new recipe under JMJ's (Jessica, Marla & Jimmy's) Swedish Meatballs.

I don't usually leave feedback, but this one deserves it.  I doubled this recipe, used frozen meatballs, added crushed garlic, sour cream, nutmeg and canned mushrooms.  I baked the meatballs breifly and then threw everything in the crockpot and it was the BEST swedish meatball recipe I have every fixed. Adding some of the juice from the mushrooms made this sauce a very nice consistency. Will make this again

Great dinner but made modifications according to our preferences and other's suggestions.  I used low sodium-low fat soups; scratched cream of wheat and used 1/2 c. Italian bread crums; added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to meatballs; 1 T Worcestershire to sauce and 1/2 can evap. milk.  Served with mashed potatoes.  There wasn't a ton of sauce though.  Other than that we loved it.  My husband stuffed himself and said these meatballs compete with this Mother's!  I'll definitely make this again.

People who say this recipe was too sweet are definitely using the wrong kind of milk.  Must be using condensed rather than evaporated.  It's not sweet.  I used Marla's Swedish Meatball recipe for the meatballs and this recipe for the sauce.  Very good combination!  I used the cream of mushroom with roasted garlic and it was really good.  I will definitely make this again.  Baking in the sauce gives the meatballs a lot of flavor.

Very Tasty!  I did make a few changes though. I used Italian bread crumbs instead of cream of wheat, and added salt, pepper, and a little nutmeg to the meatball mixture.  I also added 1/2 cup sour cream and about 1/8 tsp nutmeg to the sauce.  Even using reduced fat soup it was very rich and creamy.  Definitely a keepr!

I made my own meatballs (1 LB ground beef, ½ onion, a few shakes of worchestershire sauce, seasoning salt, pepper, a little nutmeg, ½ cup or so of crushed Ritz crackers, and some milk) and fried them up on the stove. I then drained them on paper towels, placed them in an 8x8" dish, and prepared the sauce in the same frying pan (after draining the grease). I sauteed a small can of mushrooms in a little butter then combined with the cans of soup and two small cans (5 oz each) of evaporated milk. Next time, I'm going to use two cans of mushroom soup as the chicken soup added a not-so-great sweetness to it. And I'll probably only use 5 oz of evaporated milk and add a half-cup or so of sour cream. We served it over egg noodles, and it was good... But I think it'll be much better with the changes I want to use. Thanks, Jessica, for a great starting point. :)

I followed Beanhead's idea below.  It was SO yummy and tasty!  My husband was so impressed, he wants to have that specific recipe at least 3 times a month!!  My children ate it up.  Main thing is to make sure you are using EVAPORATED and not CONDENSED milk.  Was VERY yummy!  Thanks Beanhead!

I used the pre-made meatballs - which reduced all the time.  It was a great quick meal.  I will definately make again!

This is great comfort food. I added about 1 tsp of tastefully simple seasoned salt and some breadcrumbs to the meatballs, and a dash of nutmeg, pepper, 4 oz sour cream, and sauteed mushrooms to the sauce. After baking the meatballs as directed, I put them in the crockpot with the sauce for 5 hours on low. Heavenly! Thanks for the recipe.

I too used frozen meataballas from Costco (yum) put 2 cans of golden mushroom (much better than cream of mush) 2 cans of cream of chicken, 1 can evaporated milk, sour cream, worteschire sauce, a dash of red wine (I drank the rest) some garlic salt and lots of pepper.  All in the crockpot and then put in frozen meatballs.  Stirred the pot and sat back and let it cook.
Spooned over egg noodles and it is the best comfort food ever!  Have a nice salad and pretend it is healthy

I really liked this.  It was so much better than the frozen TV dinners my daughter eats all the time.  I used some meat balls I had previously made and frozen rather thant he ones in the recipe.  I mixed together the sauce and put them in frozen.  An hour later dinner was done.  It was great.  All the recipe needed was a little salt and pepper and some sliced mushrooms to be perfect.

Part of the fun of this site is reading other reviewers comments and tweaks - we can all pretty much look at a recipe and know if we'd like to add something to fit our personal tastes...tho sometimes we're not exactly sure what to add or how much...there's where the other reviewers come in - and all I can say is "Thank you everyone out there !"   I too made only the sauce from this recipe...with a few tweaks from other reviewers - added one small finely diced onion with two large finely grated cloves of garlic sauteed in butter..added to two cans of Cream of Mushroom soup...kept the amount of one can evaporated milk...about 8 to 10 oz sour cream...one tablespoon Worcestershire sauce...a few good shakes of black pepper...a pinch of salt - And let me tell you...this sauce is the bomb !...turned out something similar to what my Mom made for us as kids...tho she called it Russian Meatballs  - therefore...I am rating this recipe 5 stars as an excellent base.

I followed this recipe to a T. It tasted like something was missing from it. My husband absolutely loves swedish meatballs and was not happy with this recipe. I have to say though, the meatballs were ok, the sauce just needed something else.

This was good but made some tasty tweaks. 
1. I had frozen meatballs so I went ahead and used those.
2. I sauteed 2 cloves garlic and one small onion in a pan.
3. Then I added butter and fresh mushrooms.
4. Stir these into the soups in the casserole pan. (The casserole pan does not need to be greased)
5. Add the baked meatballs and cook as directed.
6. When it came out of the oven I added a few dollops of sour cream and stirred it in.
7. I then added the fresh parsley and a couple squeezes of lemon was KEY!!!
Yum!
YUM!

To be fair, I just don't "do" processed foods, so the condensed soups were a major stretch for me, but I needed something kind of quick. There just doesn't seem to be a good Swedish meatball recipe available on this site yet.

I used the sauce from this recipe (but made the meatballs described in Swedish Meatballs II).  The sauce was too bland for my tastes. It tasted like every other recipe that contained cream of mushroom soup, so I amped it up a bit.  I sauteed some garlic & onions & added it to the sauce. I didn't have any sour cream, so I added a bit of buttermilk that needed to be used up.  I also added ground black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, onion salt, & allspice. I don't know what REAL Swedish meatballs taste like, so I'm sure my changes don't do the authentic version any justice, but I did what I could with it. I also added some grated parmesan (I know! Definitely NOT Swedish! Sorry!). . .but it really is not bad with these additions.  Thanks for the start-off point though!  I really appreciate it!

This was a good recipe. I rated it 4 starts rather than 5 because it was good, but wasn't exceptional. Everyone in the family thought it was good. I followed it exactly except replaced the beef with ground turkey. I served it over mashed potatoes left over from Thanksgiving. It was so simple...I used my crock pot...put meatballs in it for a couple hours, and put the sauce over it for the last 2 1/2 hours. I love simple crock pot recipes!

Delicious! 
I found the sause a bit stiff even using the evaporated milk as suggested- I mixed a small amount (apx.1/4 cup each)of milk and sour cream together and added to the heated sause.  I also added a splash of White Wine, WOW what a spin!!!  This is a new family treasure, Thanks

What would we do without condensed soups?!  The sauce in this was so good and no one would know how easy it is.  I made this entire dish pretty true to recipe with few minor modifications.  I thought it turned out great but I may experiment more with the meatballs for more of a flavor pop next time.  Served this with mashed potatoes and it made a great comfort meal for a cold winter day.

I made these pretty much to the recipe.  I forgot the onion (how did I forget the onion??) and added salt/pepper and garlic powder to the meatballs.  I loved the texture that the cream of wheat gave them, not as heavy as a bread crumb meatball.  The sauce was good - I added salt/pepper to that also.  A solid 4 1/2 stars (5 stars only for things I'm dying to make again) for an easy dinner.

Good, I made a few changes.  I only used 1 Can of cream of mush soup (no cream of chix soup), then I added 1 beef boulion cube & about 2 cups of milk.  This is how my mother makes it.

In reading reviews and suggestions, I used frozen Swedish Meatballs. I used the crock pot and added Cream of Mushroom with Garlic, Cream of Chicken, fresh sauteed mushrooms, 1/2 cup sourcream, 5 oz of ev. milk.   ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!  My husband said it was the best Swedish Meatballs sauce EVER.

This was delicious - I will be making this again.  I used 2 cans of cream of chicken/mushroom soup because I didn't have just cream of chicken or just cream of mushroom.  I made my meatballs large and we sprinkled parmesan cheese over it.  It tasted a lot like alfredo - very good and very easy.

I was so excited about this recipe and sadly it was a let down.  The meatballs lacked flavor and the sauce was quite bland.   My husband only ate a few bites...always a bad sign.

We loved this. I actually used bought meatballs and then added 1/2 cup of greek yogurt just because I didn't have sour cream. I also added some garlic, fresh chopped onion and mushrooms.

This sauce is amazing, however I followed the lead and used Marla's meatballs instead. Between the two is a perfect recipe for Swedish Meatballs.

I wanted to try out a new sauce recipe and because this one was highly rated this was the one I chose.  I was not a fan of this.  I normally just use sour cream and a brown gravy or a can of cream of mushroom soup, so I've never used evaporated milk before.  It made the sauce strangely sweet.  I had to add some garlic salt and pepper to curve it more towards what I was expecting.  I don't plan to use this recipe again.  The sauce *looked* right, but it didn't *taste* right...to me.

I was trying to figure out how this was going to turn out without nutmeg or even sour cream and sadly it just tasted like meatballs with cream of chicken and mushroom.  Had to do a lot of doctoring...add salt and pepper, nutmeg, worsterchire sauce and sour cream, and a tad bit of sugar and it turned to taste a lot closer to swedish meatballs.

My review is on the sauce only, I cheated and used frozen meatballs. The sauce was pretty good, not wonderful, I felt like it was missing something. I likely won't make this again.

EXCELLENT flavor! Hardest part is making and browing the meatballs. I used ½ grd pork & ½ grd beef...and substituted can of cr/celery for the can of cr/chicken; and Italian bread crumbs for the cr/wheat cereal. DELICIOUS! I also tried it using grd turkey, and that was great too. The people who complained this was 'too sweet'..I'd be willing to bet $$$, they used CONDENSED milk instead of EVAPORATED milk by accident.  A keeper!

I have not tried this recipe,
but it sounds really good and
easy.  I prefer to brown my
meatballs on a cookie sheet
in the oven, especially in
large quantities.  It is even
quicker, easier, and healthier
than pan frying.

I've been making this recipe since 2004 and my family enjoys it.  I have made it both as written and also with slight tweaks.  It is tasty both ways.   For those times I don't have cream of wheat in the house, I have used crushed ritz cracker crumbs and they give a good taste in the recipe.  For the past few years I have come to prefer the ritz cracker crumbs in this recipe instead of cream of wheat.  In the past I've also substituted cream of celery soup for the cream of mushroom with excellent results.  
This recipe is excellent served with mashed potatoes or with egg noodles.
Thank you Jessica for sharing this.

This is a good easy weeknight dinner! To make it a little easier even, I used store-bought turkey meatballs. Since my husband HATES anything mushroom, I used two cans of low-sodium Cream of Chicken soup. 

It's very easy and this recipe came in handy when my father-in-law popped in unexpectedly for dinner. These meatballs, with a side of egg noodles, is a delicious quick meal.

It was okay - a little bland. The sauce is good, but this needs something more in the sauce - maybe some basil, garlic salt and pepper. The meatballs also took a little longer to cook through than the recipe said, but this could have been due to me making the meatballs too large.

I followed the directions except for using frozen store bought meat balls.  In all honesty, I felt it was a bit too thick and lacked in flavor - somewhere!  I will try it again tho using maybe Golden Mushroom soup with the chicken, the golden has a richer taste to it.  Thanks for the easy prep dish Jessica!  :)

I'm sure I did something wrong but it wasn't as creamy as I would have liked.  It seemed that the soups didn't completely integrate and it was too thick.  I'd love to try it again sometime but would have to fix something so it's a little creamier.

mmmm this was really really good.  i am rating 5 stars for the way i altered it, not the original. i took other reviewers comments and added 1 cup of sour cream and some nutmeg.  i also left out the cream of wheat (i didnt even see it there until the second time i went to cook it lol).  this dinner is very very good and i recommend it highly

I followed the suggestions of others and used some pre-made meatballs I had in the freezer, added some sour cream and Worcestershire and a can of mushrooms and these were delicious!

Delicious!  Well, the sauce is delicious I cheated and bought the meatballs.  Popped the soups and meatballs in the crockpot.  I browned some mushrooms with shallots and a couple cloves of garlic then added those to the crockpot too.  After it all cooked together I thought it was a little too thick so I added maybe a cup of chicken stock.  Just before serving I stirred in a little more than a cup of sour cream.  My entire family loves it, even the kids!!  Thanks for sharing!

What a great recipe. Swedish Meatballs are one of my all time favorite childhood foods and this was the first time I have ever made it for my children. I added a few additional spices to the meatballs (Jamaican Allspice, Nutmeg, Garlic Powder, Onion Powder & Paprika) and used crushed Ritz crackers. My 5 year old told me that I I was ever in a cooking contest that I would win for sure if I made this!

I usually avoid recipes with condensed soups - and was weary that this used TWO cans. But the salt levels were fine. What I was surprised at what there was no depth of flavor. Definitely something missing.

Everyone really enjoyed this recipe so I had to give it 5 stars.  On my end, not only did I enjoy the flavor of it, it is a supereasy recipe to make.  A bonus for me is I successfully substituted ground turkey for the beef and onion powder for the minced onion and this worked great for my son who has Crohn's disease.  I will note that this is one of thoses dishes that tasted even better the second day.  Thanks!

wonderful!! I didn't have cream of wheat on hand so I used dried bread crumbs instead. Still turned out super. The last 15 minutes of cooking I added the cooked egg noodles to the dish of meatballs and sauce and baked it off.  Delish!!

I follow this recipe to the letter, but unfortunately, I really didn't care for it.  I understand that everyone's tastes are different, but I found that this particular recipe was pretty bland.  I thought about adding some seasoning to the meatballs, but I since this was my first time trying it out, I followed it exactly thinking the soup would help with the flavor.  That didn't really happen.  My boyfriend and I only took a couple of bites and decided it wasn't for us.

I was looking for a meatball recipe and came across this one along with Swedish Meatballs II.  After having read all the reviews, I did what alot of other reviewers did and combined the two.  I used the sauce from I and made the meatballs from II.  I also used 1/2 package of onion soup mix. garlic powder and sour cream in the sauce.  I used regular bread crumbs in the meatballs.  Served over mashed potatos and all was good.  I will be making these again.  So comforting and easy.  Thanks!

This tasted fairly good with another reviewer's additions of sour cream, garlic and horseradish. This was actually my first time having swedish meatballs. I am still not a fan of beef with a white sauce, but it certainly doesn't mean the recipe is not good.

These weren't quite Swedish meatballs but they were good. I added a few extra spices- like garlic salt and fresh ground pepper. Good comfort food and easy especially using prepackaged meatballs.
Thanks for sharing.

I made this for my family a couple of nights ago and they loved it. I was looking for something to do with the frozen meatballs that I had in my freezer and this was the perfect recipe to accompany them. The only thing that I did different was I added some beef bullion to the soup mixture to make it have more of a "beefy" taste to it. Thanks for sharing.

I usually don't like to open a can of soup for sauce, but this was GREAT!:  Marla's meatballs, baked like Jessica suggested.  Jessica's sauce, with Jimmy78's seasonings (minced garlic, black pepper, sour cream, sauteed mushrooms, easy on the horseradish to taste!).  Paper towel drain and baked in sauce per Jessica. FABULOUS!  It takes a while to make but is well worth the time! A+++

I was a little nervous when I was mixing the soups, told hubby what was in it and he gave me the "eww" look but who would of thought that cream of chicken and cream of mushroom would make swedish meatballs. My husband said that he would rate this 4 stars, as he was reaching for more...:o)~ thanks for sharing

This was very good. I used three cans of cream of chicken soup as we like thicker sauce. I also added nutmug, paprika and pepper to meatballs and sauce to add some kick. I recommend adding butter and caraway seeds to the egg noodles as the caraway does a good job complimenting the meatballs.

I have been looking for a good Swedish Meatball recipe for a long time. This one is a simple, easy version, with a nice sauce. If you do like more flavor to your sauce, you might want to add some wine and/or garlic. The evaporated milk (make sure you don't use sweetened condensed milk) helps to minimize the canned taste of the soups. I think next time I would use even more parsley, or I have even thought about trying dill, which many other Swedish Meatball recipes call for. I prepared my meatballs (actually used my own meatball recipe) the day before and then put them and the sauce in the crockpot the following day. I cooked them on low for 5 hours. They were a big hit and I didn't have one left. Thanks Jessica for a great recipe.

This was a really good recipe...I had to make a few modifications, though. Instead of the cream of wheat, I used Italian bread crumbs, and I used 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup. Also, I only used half of the can of evaporated milk, which made my sauce a bit thicker. Finally, I added about 1/2 tsp. black pepper, otherwise it would have been a bit bland.  This way, it was wonderful.  My husband, normally a picky eater, said I could make this dish again anytime!

I substituted evaporated milk for 3/4 cup milk and 1/3 cup melted butter for the sauce. I added 2 teaspoons garlic and 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce. I did not make my own meat balls; instead I bought frozen Italian meatballs. My family loved it!

Rating is based only for the sauce, it was awesome with very few changes as suggested by others. I did not make the meatballs, but will give it a try next time since the sauce was delicious! I added half cup of sour cream, 2 minced garlic cloves and 1/4 tsp fresh grated nutmeg. This sauce can stand alone with some pasta as a meatless meal. I think it would taste delicious with grilled or sauteed chicken breasts. going to try and make with reduced fat versions of the soups and sour cream for a healthier version. going in my recipe box!

if you want an even quick and easy way with great taste.  Do the following.  Use frozen meat balls and then take 1can cream of mushroom, 1 can french onion and 1 can of golden mushroom put in a crockpot.... so easy

Sorry, but this recipe was not very good at all. Made this last night for my fiance who had been craving Swedish meatballs and it was embarrassing to say the least. Followed the directions to a tee. The meatballs had very little flavor with the exception of the onion, and the sauce was way overpowering. The condensed soups mad it way to strong. Sorry, may be good for some people, but not for us.

I found this recipe almost a year ago and have made it regularly since then.  My boyfriend asks for this weekly.  I use ground turkey since we don't eat much red meat.  I use italian bread crumbs instead of the cream of wheat since I rarely have it on hand.  I also mix half evaporated milk and half chicken stock as it helps with flavour and I use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of one mushroom one chicken.  I serve mine with rice.  Thank you...I can't say enough about how delicious this is.

Delicious.  I was actually looking for a way to use up some cream of wheat cereal that nobody was eating.  I followed the recipe, mincing the onion very finely, and only using about 1 tablespoon to please my kids.  I also put the meatballs in my slow cooker with the soups and cooked on low for about 6 hours.  They were tender, moist, and flavorful.  We had these served over egg noodles, but they would also be good over rice.

Mmmmm.  This was easy and delicious!!  Next time I might try to add some brown gravy into the sauce.  Bread crumbs were a great substitution for the cream of wheat.

This was very easy to prepare and I got rave reviews from the entire family!  The only change I made was to put the onion in a blender, sounds funny but my boyfriend doesn't like the texture of onions.  It made for a nice, smooth meatball.  We'll be making this again!

This was very tasty.  I made this for my family using a crock pot and frozen meatballs.  I added 1/2 pint sour cream, mushrooms, 2 cloves minced garlic and a dash of Tony Checheree seasoning to the other ingredients and put everything in the crock pot at one time.  Everyone liked this dish.

Made these for a retirement party and they were a huge hit they were delicious and I like that by baking them you can drain off the grease half way through the cooking time.  I made one change and that was using Italian Bread Crumbs instead of the cereal.

I used frozen meatballs and used other reviewers suggestions and made changes to the sauce. I used a can of cream of mushroom with roasted garlic and a can of cream of chicken with mushrooms and sautéed a small package of sliced fresh mushrooms with margarine and minced garlic. I was afraid it would be too "mushroomy" but my husband suggested next time I add even more mushrooms.  My husband is a pretty picky eater and he loved this and I definitely will be making this again! Quick easy and very good!

This is a winner especially if you need something fast & simple.  I used the packaged meatballs and made a few additions as did others. On the sauce I used 2 cans of almost fat free cream of mushroom, added worstishire, nutmeg and regular milk (2%).  I also added some some onions & garlic which I quicklly sauteed in butter. It was fast & yummy.  My picky husband ate it and the kids loved it.  I will use this often during softball season, nice switch from meatballs with red sauce.

My kids LOVE the Swedish meatballs at IKEA, just didn't want to make the drive out there.  Was afraid of making the meatballs but bought frozen SWEDISH meatballs at our Ralph's grocery store (owned by Krogers).  Was worried about the evaporated milk, but this recipe was SOOO Super easy!  I served it with cheesy banquet potatoes.  Will put this in my "MOST FAV RECIPES" category!  Thank you!

This is so yummy.  I can't really speak for authenticity, but it is an easy recipe that my family and I love.  The meatballs are easy to make if you use a mini ice cream scoop - the kind that you use to make cookies.  I also cooked them in a frying pan instead of the oven to speed up the process.  I serve it with mashed potatoes.

This was VERY good.  I took a little advice from a few of the other users...I added a little Worscheshire Sauce and sour cream to the sauce.  I sprinkled a little paprika on top before I baked it.  This is a keeper!

Wow! This was great! I doubled the recipe,used breadcrumbs instead and added some garlic. This makes alot of sauce and I even left out a crm of chicken. Next time Ill still double the meat but only use 1 crm of mushroom and 1 crm of chicken.(same amount of evapourated milk)  Also added some mushrooms and a few dollups of sour cream. I Threw it all in the slow cooker for 3-4 hours on high and it turned out excellent. Very Creamy and Rich.

I did not use the meatball recipe - I used frozen meatballs...I only used the sauce ingredients as a base.  I also used my Crockpot.  I put together 1 can Golden Mushroom, 1 can Cream of Mushroom, 8 oz of sour cream, 1/3 can of evaporated milk, salt, pepper, and dried minced garlic - probably about a teaspoon total.  (I just shook it in and stirred a couple of times!)  It took about an hour to an 1 1/2, but this Crockpot is older and cooks slower than my newer ones.  Everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.

These are fantastic! I do not sprinkle with parsley - We're not that fancy. I use plain bread crumbs instead of the dry cream of wheat and they still turned out great! One of our new favorites!

I used another recipe for the meatballs, but used this sauce.  I did not care for the sauce..it was too heavy and tasteless to me. I think next time I will omit the cream of chicken and use milk and sourcream with the cream of mushroom and maybe some cooking wine.  However, my kids loved it

This was a very easy recipe to make, I pre-made the meatballs and then combined everything in my crock pot and I was all set to go.  My husband and I really enjoyed the flavor of the "gravey".

These were delicious!! i followed the suggestion to use italian breadcrumbs instead of cream of wheat. i forgot to get worchestire sauce while at the grocery store but i look forward to having that next time. i served with egg noodles, but will server with mashed potatos next time. either way, it was delicious and made for superb leftovers the next day.

Easy & fast for those nights when you don't know what you are going to fix. I usually only use 2 cans of cream of mushroom. Also didn't have cream of wheat so I used crushed cornflakes.

Ii am rating this a five star cause I changed the recipe. I only used the sauce from this recipe. I used the meatballs from recipe swedish meatballs II. I cooked the meatballs just like that recipe calls for. Please do not confuse EVAPORATED MILK with CONDENSED MILK. They are very different. It turned out excellent.

This recipe is so great!  I have made these meatballs so many times.  On busy days I just buy pre made meatballs, fry them, and then throw them in the sauce.  My family loves the sauce it has become a favorite to everyone that knows me!  Also this sauce is really good to use for sausage gravy and biscuits... It almost taste like Bob Evans!

As other reviewers recommended I used the meatballs from "swedish meatballs II" combined with the sauce from this recipe.  I added 2-3 tablespoons of tomato sauce and used only half the can of cream of chicken soup.  Husband loved the results.  I will definately make this again.

Traditional Swedish meatballs are made with hamburger and ground pork. Just because they are small in size doesn't make them Swedish.

WOw!  Great recipe.  I'm a busy woman and didn't take the time to make the meatballs.  I buy the Armor frozen already made meatballs.  Italian or Original both work.  Then I just mix the canned soups, evap milk and parsley and add the meatballs in a crock pot and cook it for awhile.  FAST EASY AND GREAT!!  I serve it over mashed potatoes.

Having never made Swedish Meatballs before, I found this recipe easy and tasty. Per the other reviewers suggestions, I added salt and pepper and substituted the bread crumbs for the cream of wheat. I served it over egg noodles...yum! My husband liked it, and devoured the leftovers for lunch the next day!

I added Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper to the meatballs for more flavor.  This made them so tasty, my 2 year old was taking them off the counter.  Also, I found the sauce very rich. I would either use low/no fat evaporated milk, or combine skim milk with half of the evaporated milk.  Otherwise, it tasted good and my family liked it.

I used the meatballs from this recipe and the sauce from another (carnation).  The meatballs were... pretty bad. The onions added a very bitter flavor to the meat, and even without the onions, the meatballs were especially bland. The recipe required no salt, and I strongly believe this is its major downfall. Even after being added to the sauce (which is very similar to the other) the meatballs did not very good. I highly feel I have wasted a perfectly good pound of ground beef and 1/4 cup of onions. My family choked down the meatballs, and I felt horribly bad about having made such a meal for them. We used the same ground beef and onions in other meals and they all turned out fine. Sorry for the bad review. If you look down on the comment page you will see that other people have said they used additions (such as  mushrooms, A1 sauce, allspice, and garlic) to their recipes and found it made a better meal (which we were robbed of). This is a sincere review and im sorry that it is negative one.

The good news is the kids loved it.  However, 
the meal was extremely bland.  My wife and I
had to add lots of salt and pepper to make the
meal palatable to our tastes.  Definitely agree
that the recipe calls for too much evaporated
milk.  I cut down the amount of milk from 6 cans
down to 3 and it was STILL too much!!!!  Next
time my kids ask for swedish meatballs, I'll
go to my freezer and pull out a box - they taste better and are much easier to
prepare!

On advice from others I added salt, pepper, parsley and a hefty dash of allspice
to the meatball mixture. I also used 1 can cr. celery and 1 cr. chicken, 1 15oz can
evaporated milk, + 1 c. milk and 1 can mushrooms, drained. Simmered it in the crockpot
, excellent recipe, would absolutly make it again. Thanks Jessica!

Overall an ok recipe. I doubled the amount of everything except for the sauce, and there was still way too much sauce. Definately could cut back on about 2 to 3 cans of evaporated milk. I also added a lot of black pepper and some thyme to the meat mixture and I couldn't even taste it. I might try it again with some more seasoning. It's a good base recipe, and is better served over egg noodles.

The sauce was perfect, but I too used the other recipe for the meatballs. Combine the two together and it was amazing. First time making Swedish meatballs and the whole family wants them again!

I used a half pound each of ground beef and pork. I added a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce to both the meat and sauce. Also added a little more than 1/4 cup of Ritz crackers in place of the Cream of Wheat. After reading a review, I used two cans of just Cream of Mushroom soup. I had 2% milk that needed to be used so I subbed that for the evaporated milk. I also addded some plain Greek yogurt and white horseradish to the sauce. A little garlic/onion powder can't hurt either. The sauce had a good consistency, and the whole dish was delicious!

I have tried this recipe several times as my family loves it. I have tried tweaking it at times like adding some cinnamon, omitting either the cream of mushroom and doubling the cream of chicken or using bread crumbs instead of cream of wheat. Whichever way it still comes out good. It's an easy inexpensive and tasty dish.

This was a great help. Already had meatballs made with a mix that comes in a box.  I find it near the packaged gravies and season bags.  What I didn't have was gravy! What a quick easy way to add gravy. I had all three ingredients. can't wait to taste em!

Have tried this about 5 times in the last 6 weeks. Read a lot of the reviews which helped.
I have made this with full fat cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups with full fat milk and sour cream. Turned out very creamy and rich. Also made it with 98% fat free soups, skim and low fat sour cream. Tastes good too and heart healthier. Not as creamy of course.

I add 1 tbsp of steaksauce to the meat. The cream of wheat really holds the meatballs together better than when I tried bread crumbs. Evap  milk made it a little too sweet for me. 
Everyone I makes this for loves them. So easy

Did not like this recipe.  I took the advice of others and used Marla's meatball recipe and the meatballs themselves were good.  The sauce turned out really thick and frankly the color is off putting.  That may have been overlooked if the sauce tasted amazing, but it doesn't.  Definitely won't make this again.

My husband is Swedish, so I may be a little biased. These meatballs were easy a bit mushy, I used breadcrumbs instead of the cream of wheat, which may have been why. The sauce was a little bland for my taste, so I doctored it up w/ misc. spices. Overall, it was a good recipe.

Very good. Followed others suggestion and used Marla's meatballs and Jessica's sauce. I also added fresh chopped garlic to sauted onions and then sauted some fresh crimini mushrooms as well to add to casserole before baking. I like to keep things lower in fat so used low fat/low sodium cream mushroom, cream celery soups, and evaporated milk. Also sauted vegetables in butter spray. Even with changes, it was excellent.

Like a lot of other reviewers, I combined the recipes for Marla's meatballs with Jessica's sauce. I did end up adding some sauteed mushrooms, about 3 tablespoons of fat free sour cream and about a half cup of milk to the sauce. I was skeptical at first because I thought it would be too salty with the soups, but it was actually really good. Italian seasoning, garlic powder, ample ground black pepper and a pinch of allspice in the meatball mixture kept it from being bland. My husband says this is a keeper. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good and so simple!  I did personnalize a little.  I used frozen prepared meatballs.  I used roasted garlic soup, and because I needed more gravy, I added another can of evaporated milk and a can of cream of celery and about 1/2 cup of sour cream.  Everyone liked this!

This review is just for the sauce - and actually, it's for Jimmy 78's version.  As written, Jessica's sauce gets three stars, which is perfectly respectable, but it's basically canned soup.  Jimmy 78's version is inspired.  Loved the horseradish; it gave the sauce a zip that plain condensed soup wouldn't have.  Worcestershire sauce would probably do the same thing.  I might play with this a bit more and find a way to make the sauce without the cans.

YUM!  Thanks for the recipe.  I followed other suggestions and added a few dollops of sour cream and a dash of nutmeg to the sauce.  I ended up with plenty of sauce!  I also used garlic bread crumbs instead of the cream of wheat, and added a teaspoon of garlic powder to the sauce.  The only change I'd make next time is to mix salt into the meat balls before forming.  They could really use some, and I forgot to add it this time around.  I will definitely be making this again!

We used lean beef and the sauce was very greasy. The meatballs tasted like meatloaf - not what I hoped for at all. Not a lot of flavour, maybe better for people who like plain food.

This was really good and easy with a few modifications. I can only rate the sauce since I used premade frozen meatballs. I threw the 2 cans of soup and evaporated milk in my small crockpot with about 1 tbsp garlic powder and let it heat until warm. I then poured it over the frozen meatballs in a 9x9 pan and baked at 350 for 30 mins. Before serving, I mixed in 1/4 cup sour cream and served over egg noodles (I also omitted the parsley). I will definitely make it again!

Family loves these I thought the sauce was missing something. I omitted the cream of wheat and used bread crumbs isntead (no cream of wheat on hand) I did enjoy the texture of the meatballs I just felt like the sauce didn't have the depth it needed but not sure what to add to make it better.

I made this for a friend who was visiting.  His mom always used to make Swedish Meatballs with mashed potatoes, so I agreed to give it a shot.  I used Italian bread crumbs instead of the cream of wheat and I didn't add any onion.  I also doubled the recipe, because we were having several other people over.  I don't think the recipe doubled well, the sauce was a little too runny and the meatballs took about 10 extra minutes to cook.  Despite all that, we still really enjoyed these.  They were very tasty and the sauce was yummy.  Went well with both mashed potatoes and noodles!

We all enjoyed it but we didn't care for the leftovers.  I used packaged meatballs which I think ruined it.  I will make my own next time.

We love this sauce with the following additions: 1 c sour cream, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 tsp pepper, 2 Tbsp creamy horseradish sauce, and lots of sliced mushrooms sauteed in butter. I have used the crock pot on low for 4 hours and simply made it on top of the stove. Either way works fine. I tried Marla's meatballs from this site "Sweedish Meatballs II" as suggested by others but found the frozen Swedish meatballs a more reasonable choice for time, energy, and effort.

This is a good recipe. I stuck with the original recipe and made no alterations to it. The meatballs could have used some seasoning. but all in all, a very quick and easy meal.

Love this recipe!  I am a beginner at cooking and this recipe was easy enough for even me.  I made a few modifications to make the recipe lighter... I used 94% fat free cream of mushroom and cream of chicken and I also used half a can on 2% milk instead of evaporated.  Will be making this recipe again and again!

I love the sauce for this recipe. I made a few changes: frozen "Swedish style" meatballs, cooked in the oven. Sauteed onions, garlic and mushrooms before mixing in soups and evaporated milk. Add cooked meatballs to sauce. Salt and pepper to taste. Serve over egg noodles. Simple, quick and delicious! I double the recipe, so we get dinner and lunch for a few days.

My first attempt at making Swedish Meatballs and it was a success.  My sauce had a few adaptions to accommodate what I had on hand.  I didn't have any evaporated milk, so I used some 2% milk and added a couple of spoonfuls of sour cream to help thicken it up.  I also had some leftover sauteed mushrooms that I tossed in, mainly b/c I didn't want to throw them out.  This is a definite keeper!!!

This recipe is good.  I made a few adjustments, like bread crumbs instead of shredded wheat and adding a bit of sour cream.  This isn't a five star recipe because it is a bit bland, it needs garlic or something to punch it up, but it is good.

Like other I used already made Meatballs. I went to make sauce didn't have evaporated milk, use Heavy whipping cream instead. Put meatballs in crock pot, with sauce over it. Cooked 3hrs, on high. They were great. No leftover in this house.

the sauce on these is awesome.  We had a side of mash potatoes with this and the gravy tasted wonderful on them.  I did alter the recipe just a bit, I used 2 cans of cream of chicken instead of the mushroom soup as my family doesn't like mushrooms, it tasted great.  If you don't like onion flavor these meatballs won't be for you.  I found they had a very strong onion flavor.  We had some left after our dinner, I ate them the next day for lunch and thought they were even better as leftovers.

This is a great base recipe and my family loved this dish. I used bread crumbs instead of cream of wheat. I thought it was missing the allspice, nutmeg, or cardamom I usually use and needed more onion flavor, it's not like any swedish meatballs I've had before, sure needs more oomph, but overall the dish was good and my guys had seconds. They didn't notice anything missing. This was really easy. Thanks!

I found this recipe to be extremely bland.  I tried to add pepper but it didn't help.  Unfortunately, my kids hated it too.  It was disappointing; but since this is the first time I've made Swedish Meatballs - I will have to just try other recipes.  No offense to anyone, and maybe you'll like the creaminess; but our family loves flavor and this just didn't have any.

Note: I only made the sauce from this recipe. Consistency was wrong (not light and creamy). Taste was wrong (not remotely like "restaurant" recipes). Very glad I didn't put all my meatballs into this sauce.

The leftovers were eaten right out the container by my 23 year old brother ... he loved them (we had just been to IKEA and had some at the cafe so we were on a meatball kick).  I used bread crumbs (instead of cream of wheat) and added Tony Chacheres seasoning to the meat and soup mixture.  I could not mince the onion enough for my taste, next time I may use onion powder or flakes instead.

This was a very easy and great tasting version without the sour cream.  Even my teenager liked it.  I did substitute bread crumbs for the dry cream of wheat cereal because I never liked the cereal.

This is a nice "convenience" meal.  The meatballs were the most time consuming, but the sauce whipped up in seconds (open a few cans, and you're good to go).  I doubled the recipe, but used only 3 cans of "cream of" soups instead of 4 and the sauce was just right.  I used 1 can each of cream of celery, cream of chicken, and golden mushroom.  The whole family (including picky 7 year old) enjoyed this.

I added onion soup mix to the meatballs instead of minced onion and added some different spices to the sauce (garlic powder, salt, pepper, etc.) It was a hit with my husband and I. Not so much with the kids. They liked the meatballs dipped in ketchup.

I only made the meatballs, not the sauce.  My husband I love them!  I added some Italian seasoning, a clove of garlic, and some parsley to the mix.  They still taste a little bland, but when we put them on bread with cheese and sauce to make subs, they're awesome!

Great sauce!  I cheated on the meatballs and used pre-made frozen Italian Meatballs.  I defrosted them for 2 minutes in the microwave and then pan fried to get extra crispy, then followed the baking instructions with the sauce.  Turned out great!  Thanks!

Really good recipe. I used bread crumbs instead of the cream of wheat since I was using ground turkey and didn't want the texture too "weird", and they came out fine. The sauce is really wonderful. I ended up using two cans non-condensed cream of mushroom soup, and the consistency was a litte bit wet. Next time I'll try with one condensed and one non-condensed. This one's a keeper!

This is a GREAT recipe, but I could tell it would be a little bland for my husband and I.  So, I added paprika to the meatballs and italian seasoning to the sauce.  Also, I didn't have cream of wheat on hand, but old fashioned bread crumbs worked just as well.

I made this last night for a party and it was the biggest hit of the night. Very tasty and easy!!! I added about 1/2 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs that made it even better.

The cream of wheat in this was strange it gave the meatballs a different texture, but the sauce was really good. Probably going to use saltine crackers or bread crumbs next time I make this.

Thanks for the Recipe. Its just I shouldn't have tried it. It is the TV dinners of Cooking. I LOVE AUTHENTIC COOKING. Ground Pork, Beef, ground allspice,cardamom,ginger made meatballs all served over MASHED POTATOES...that's cooking.

Made as is and thought this was pretty good.  Only cream of wheat I had was brown sugar and had my doubts about that, but couldn't even taste it.  Since I'm not much fond of making meatballs, and the sauce was really the good part of this recipe, I'd probably use pre-made ones next time.  Used with an 8 oz. pkg of thin egg noodles.  Quite filling this way.

This recipe is so easy it's ridiculous! I've never had swedish meatballs before (what can I say? I'm from Los Angeles, not Minnesota). I added an extra egg and some crushed Ritz crackers to the meatball mixture so they wouldn't turn into mini-hamburgers while cooking (it worked) and served them over egg noodles. Yummy!

I too used bread crumbs instead of cream of wheat.  This was a good meal, but not anything awesome.  I sauteed my meatballs instead of cooking them in the oven that first 20 minutes.  I think that worked well.  I also added a splash of white wine to the sauce, which gave it extra flavor.  Served over egg noodles.  Good meal.

Yum! Making your own meatballs is always a treat. Store bought ones are always tough and full of fat! These meatballs are lovley with delicate flavours. Make sure to use extra lean gr. beef for less fat and a lighter taste. The sause dose need fixing if serving over noodles, to bland other wize. The second time I added 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 cup no fat sour cream + a few healthy dashes of freshly ground pepper.

Easy and simple. I really liked using cream of wheat hot cereal as the filler for the meatballs. DELISH!! Next time I'll probably add a little more seasonings to the meatballs themselves as we love spiced foods but this has a lot of flavor and is so easy to make! Thanks Jessica!!!!

my kids loved it.  I was in a hurry so I used frozen meatballs, which made it almost too easy, if there is such a thing.  Not too sweet.  I think people who thought it too sweet might have used condensed sweetened milk.

The recipe takes some time to prepare, but it's well worth it.  I made it for my hubby two weeks ago and he's asking for it again.  This time, I'm going to prepare enough for eight servings and freeze the extra six for additional dinners.  We like it this much.

Very tasty recipe. (Makes a boatload of gravy....) I used fat-free evaporated milk, which cut down on a lot of the fat, and it still came out very creamy.

I served it for Christmas Eve dinner - it was a big hit!!!.  Definately add salt & pepper...Swedes aren'tknown for their spicy food.  I doubled the recipe and cut out a can of evaporated milk and there was still too much sauce!!!  It was even better than the Swedish meatballs that I loved as a child.  Very easy - able to enjoy talking to guest rather than stuck in the kitchen.

Makes plenty of gravy,  next time I would cut back on 5 oz. of the milk.  Excellent recipe that is definitely "kid-approved"

Very easy and a big hit with my family.  I would only suggest to add a little pepper and a dash of salt to the meatballs.

This recipe was like eating the "McDonalds" version of swedish meatballs. Quite bland with just a creamy soup taste.

I liked these; however, I thought the sauce was a bit runny.  I would reduce the amount of evap. milk next time.  My husband suggested adding some pepper as he thought they were a bit bland.  Otherwise, a good recipe.

This is the best Swedish Meatballs recipe I have ever made and my whole family loved it! Easy to prepare and I really liked baking the meatballs first and getting rid of the fat.  The gravy is very creamy and I just added about 1/2 t. Nutmeg to the meatballs and then to the gravy too.  I would make this for company, it is that good!  Karen

Came out great. I used bread crumbs instead of the Cream of Wheat. 
For the meatballs, I used a combination of ground beef, veal and pork, instead of just beef. 
I also added a tablespoon of Dijon mustard to the meatballs for a little zest. 
For the sauce, I added some fresh sliced mushrooms browned in butter and oil.

Haven't made it yet, but I already love the recipe because it includes a can of cream of mushroom soup; which is what I want. I like the idea of the dry Cream of Wheat, but I would substitute the milk for sour cream; or use less of both.

I doubled the recipe and everyone loved it! I chose this one because I liked the simplicity of this recipe, but added nutmeg, allspice, black pepper, and a hint of ginger to the meat mix.  I also added nutmeg, allspice, pepper, 8 oz sour cream, and 1/2 c heavy cream to the gravy, and used 1 can cream of chicken, with 2 cans cream of mushroom.  Served over mashed potatoes. This is definitely a new go to recipe for family get togethers!

These have very little  flavor  they need the basic Swedish meatball flavor.  Allspice, nutmeg and ginger, a little brown sugar and these would taste more like authentic. Too much goopy sauce.

Best Swedish Meatballs recipe ever.  I made it exactly as directed.  Have made several times.  I especially like that you don't have to fry the meatballs, they are baked.

This recipe was a big hit at our house. Everyone had seconds!  Next time I might add some seasonings to the meatballs and maybe add some carrots and/or mushrooms to the sauce just as an easy way to sneak veggies into the kids food, but it was good as is. We ate it with egg noodles.

I find this recipe just ok as written.  The meatballs are lacking in flavor for me, but the sauce is good, and over some buttered noodles are a decent dish.  I have tweaked this over the years and actually use a combination of this recipe and another swedish meatballs recipe from this site with a few more minor edits in how I make this.  I know everyone says rate it as it is written without any changes, so this is my just my opinion on this recipe as written.

Will definitely make again.  Used frozen homestyle meatball.s.  Added two teaspoon of relish to sauce. ( from an old recipe)  added minced shallots, garlic powder and a little dill.  Cooked  slowly on top of stove.  Served hot sauce on side.   We really enjoyed the flavor and the easiness of this dish.

This is one that you need to make time for, but it is worth the wait. Inexpensive, easy to prepare (if I had kids in the house, they could easily help out!), and it makes enough to feed a large family. I served this over egg noodles and MMMMMM MMMMMM!!!!!! Delicious! I will definitely make this one again!

I've made this recipe following the recipe exactly and with some of my own changes..both were amazing. Tonight I only had cream of chicken soup and I usually use my own ground turkey recipe. I added half a pint of sour cream and a tablespoon of paprika to the sauce this time. Yummy.

I used frozen meatballs and made the sauce subbing the evaporated milk for half heavy whipping cream and half water (5 oz each) and it needed something else so I added nutmeg, garlic, and sage. Then the sauce was perfect! I didn't have a recipe I liked until this one so I will make this again with the same modifications. Thanks

This has become a family staple! It works very well on a work/school weeknight. I found pre-cooked frozen meatballs at a local store. We prefer the ones with sausage mixed in. I added sliced "baby bella" mushrooms (about a cup) to the sauce. The idea of adding sour cream sounds good so I might try that next time.

This was one of those comfort meals. We added salt, pepper, garlic, A1 and Worcestershire sauce to it, just to flavor it up a bit.  Served it over rice (hubby prefers rice over noodles).  Added a tossed salad, steamed veggies and toasted buttered sourdough bread to the meal. It was a yummy one, thank you for sharing Jessica.   8~)

I used Italian Bread Crumbs in place of the cream of wheat as others did and the meatballs were wonderful.  However, I did not think the sauce was good.  I think it overpowered the meatballs.  Next time I will use a brown gravy recipe.

This recipe is not an upper level high class recipe but for normal daily meals the taste is excellent and it has a low difficulty factor which is good for me. So if you need a tasty daily meal recipe this is one to seriously consider.

Turned out delicious... just what I was looking for, thanks!  Made with ground turkey.  Next time will also try the lowfat soups so it's not so heavy.  I substituted Italian bread crumbs for the cream of wheat.  Onion was a little overpowering for my husband, maybe next time I'll use the dried minced or just onion powder.  Served over No Yolk egg noodles... yum!!!

These were wonderful!  Meatballs are always a favorite in the house and we needed a way to change them from time to time.  I do wish I had used more than 1lb of beef, it's not much for a family with 3 growing boys :)

I'm 33 and this was my first time making meatballs.  It turned out well, thanks for tonight's dinner idea.  Next time I'll throw celery into the meatball mix.  However, I'm looking for a more authentic sauce recipe... any suggestions?

Super yummy meatballs (I didn't make the sauce).  I didn't have cream of wheat or ground meat so I used ground turkey and bread crumbs.  I added 1 tbsp of butter and reduced milk to 2 tbsp because the meat was so lean.  Also added about 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp of pepper.

This was ok but I thought it was a bit bland. I used homemade cream of chicken and had to substitute cream of wheat for Malt O Meal.

AMAZING-- with Jimmy78's changes. :) I also added wheat bran to the bread crumbs (in place of cream of wheat), and added some beef bouillon to help beef up the flavor a bit. Next time, I'll double the recipe to make sure there are enough meatballs to go around & have more leftovers... also, might increase the creamy horseradish & nutmeg to add zing. This is a definite keeper and will be on our permanent rotation!

I made some adjustments to this recipe and the family loved it! I prepared meatballs as recipe states, however I used lean ground turkey breast instead of the beef and added garlic. I lightly floured the meatballs and cooked them in canola oil until brown. I placed them in casserole dish and added sauce and baked for 45 min. I did add a pint of sour cream to the sauce to help thin it out and give it some more flavor. We served the meatballs over cooked brown rice and garnished with flat leaf parsley. This is a slightly healthier alternative to the original recipe. The meatballs were moist without being too soft. I crowd pleaser. =) YUM-O

Meatballs were pretty good, slightly too moist, but tasted pretty good.  The sauce was in need of something along the lines of beef broth and sour cream versus the canned soups...but the ease of the recipe was great!   Kids would not eat the meatballs but ate the noodles.

The sauce is so simple to make and the results are very yummy.  I've made this quite a few times, the first time I used made meatballs and the results weren't that great considering the amount of time required.  The other times I made this recipe I simply used store bought frozen meatballs.  By doing so, this recipe is a great for last minute dinner ideas.

This was pretty tasty...and EASY!!  I did cheat though and used the pre-made frozen meatballs (I just like them...why go through the trouble of making them yourself).  By using pre-made meatballs (don't need to defrost), and mixing the soups and milk together...I was able to prep this meal in no time.  Tasted great over egg noodles.

Yummy Yummy Yummy! We used the recipe for the meatballs only and then added the IKEA swedish meatball cream sauce...I could've licked the pan out!  The meatballs turned out really well. Alterations to recipe: We added onion salt and only cooked them for 16 minutes the second time around since the cream sauce we used is not as "saucy" and the meatballs were already cooked through with the first 20 minutes.  I have found the meatball recipe that I will use from now on in any dish I make!!! (I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't try the sauce.)

Meatballs were breat, but I messe up the sauce. It was lumpy and I felt like a failure. I substituted Lingonberry for Cranberry. I'll use tinned soup next time for the sauce.

Meatballs were good, sauce was okay-not the taste that we were looking for though!  I did make a few minor changes to the meatballs, which  had a really good taste and really good texture.  Guess we need to keep trying to find recipes to get the taste that we are after for the sauce

Although this recipe was good, it didn't really taste like Swedish Meatballs to me and my husband.  It was good, though, and pretty easy.  I made it with some German Knoedels.  (Sort of like dumplings.)

I actually only used the meatball recipe from this, my father in law gave me the other half, but they were outstanding! I did add a little garlic to them and only baked them for 20 min, (i threw them in the slow cooker with the sauce afterwards) and they were delicious, first time I making meatballs... it was great!

Used this recipe for my most recent party, and was a big hit!  I implemented Jimmy's changes and the sauce was great, had many compliments.  Will definitely make again.

This was great! And much quicker and easier to make than the completely from scratch recipes. I also added some garlic for extra zip.

Meatballs were good. Sauce was not worth making... Simply was a horrible recipe. 4 stars for the meatballs. NO stars for the sauce!

pretty good. My kids loved it. We used frozen meatballs for convenience and I added .5 tsp garlic powder & .25 tsp of onion powder & an extra can of mushroom soup.

My family liked this but a Swedish friend of ours said that this really is nothing like what her family's recipe is like.  I felt it was good, but it seemed a lot like an American comfort food recipe - like tuna casserole or something like that.  I added garlic and bread crumbs in lieu of the Cream of Wheat and added a little nutmeg to the sauce before baking.  All in all, this is a good recipe, just not very authentic.

Used Italian bread crumbs instead of cream of wheat and I think that made a huge difference in the flavor of the meatballs. Added some Worchestire to the sauce. Good recipe when you're in a bind and need to use ingredients on hand.

I used this recipe for the sauce with some modifications. I made my own meatballs basically using Marla's recipe with the addition of Beefy Onion Soup. Served it over wide egg noodles for myself and rice for my picky eater boyfriend. The sauce was easy to make and tasted good, however the consistency seemed off to me, as it was a little too thick. I did add more pepper and nutmeg to taste. Don't be afraid of the nutmeg, it really makes or breaks the sauce. I will make this again, but I will have to figure out how to get the sauce a little thinner. Picky boyfriend who doesn't do "creamy" things said this meal is one he'd be willing to have again.

This was very bland to us and feel it would take quite a bit of tweaking to suit our taste.  We did eat it after adding a package of dry onion soup mix to the sauce to give it more taste so we didn't waste the meal.

Overall, making this recipe as is is rather bland.  Where's the nutmeg?   
It seems as though nutmeg is the central ingerdient, what makes them swedish meatballs.  I added lots of nutmeg to the sauce, and that was fine.
I also made Marla's meatballs with it, and that improved the recipe quite a bit.

I was really excited to try this dish, and so was my husband. Well, I made it and we were disappointed that it tasted so bland. Just didn't taste like Swedish Meatballs at all. My kids took one taste and wouldn't touch it after that.

As many of the reviews stated that the meatballs were bland; however I think I will need to follow tips from the others and add spices to the meatball mixture. However I found this recipe to be incredibly easy and the kid's loved it and wanted seconds.

Oh I was so bummed :( My roommate and I made this last night, and I was expecting something spectacular from the reviews, but it came out sooooo weird. We took Jimmy 78's advice(added 1/2 pint of sour cream, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1 tsp fresh ground pepper, 2 tbls of creamy horseradish sauce, and fresh mushrooms sauteed in butter)cause the basic sauce of just condensed milk and soups seemed a little bland. Instead of browning the meatballs in the oven, we browned them in a skillet (used bread crumbs instead of cream of wheat) dropped them in the bowl, then dumped the soup concoction on top and baked for 40 min. My meatballs were good, but the sauce was very strange. I dont know if it was the additions I made or what, but when it was finished it had the same consistency of the condensed soups when we first poured them out. We made sure to mix very well before dumping on top of meatballs, so I dont know if stuff started to separate or what (amateur cooks, btw :) ). Also, in the picture and in other recipes the sauce had a nice color, mine was really white, with flecks of spices sooooo dont know how that happened, but it didnt add to the appeal. Was I supposed to stir while it was baking in the oven???? I don’t know maybe it would’ve helped, but I don’t think my meatballs could’ve held up to the abuse.

I have to admit that I'm surprised about our reaction to this dish considering the great reviews it's received.  We found the consistency of the sauce to be very thick and gluey - really unappetizing.  Not to mention I was *slightly* disconcerted at seeing chunks of chicken (from the soup) in my my meatballs!  I don't think we will attempt this one again.

Amazing!!!  I had never made meatballs before.  These were so good.  I did double the recipe because we had company.  I used 1 lb. ground beef and 1 lb. Italian sausage.  I also added 2 cloves of pressed garlic.  to the meatball mixture.  I like a lot of fresh herbs so I also minced some basil and added that to the meatball mixture as well.  This recipe made it so easy to make a wonderful dinner that everyone enjoyed.  Thank you!

After trying a few different swedish meatball recipies that ended up in the trash, I decided to take things into my own hands =).  I used Marla's meatball recipe and changed several things and then I used this sauce.  

The only thing I changed on the sauce was that I added 1/4 cup of white wine to spruce it up a bit.

This is now one of my favorite meals.. I Love it !!!  I have had authentic swedish meatballs in Sweden and this was even better =)

I rated this 4 stars a year ago, but have revised it to 5 now that I've had a chance to play with the recipe (it was a family favorite all along, but we just try to improve on it every time).  I like to use IKEA meatballs, but when I make them myself I use italian seasoned breadcrumbs rather than cream of wheat, and I add worcestershire and some garlic.  I combine 2 teas beef base with 1/4 cup white wine to add to the sauce, as well as some dill.  Dresses up this up to five stars!

I spiced up the meatballs a little bit, and after baking them for the initial 20 minutes, I let them slow cook (crock pot) in the soups, milk PLUS a some chicken broth for several hours.  Lots of dried parsley in the "broth." Muy savory meal or party food - just set out a jar of toothpicks.

This was just ok. It really tasted like canned soup with meatballs in it (which is what it is, I guess). I'll probably make it again since it was pretty darned easy.

Used this recipe once before with success, didn't change anything except for using frozen, purchased meatballs. I suggested a stroganoff for dinner tonight and instead my husband asked for "that Swedish meatballs you made before." Thanks!! I agree with other reviewers: anyone finding this too sweet had to have been using sweetened condensed milk by mistake. Hint: if it pours out slowly, it's the wrong milk!

Great appetizer!  I used 1/4-1/2 cup bread crumbs instead of the cream of wheat and added salt, pepper and worcheshire to part turkey and part 95% lean beef.  The sauce is plentiful enough to easily support another pound of meatballs!  Next time I might even try baking the meatballs on a broiler pan to drain the grease.

Jessica - Thanks!  Last year I made used your recipe for Swedish Meatballs and served them as an appetizer at my Christmas party.  This year my ex-husband (ex of 4 years by the way) contacted me for the recipe since a mutual friend raved about them!  Enough said!! 5 star!!!

I loved this recipe although we did as Beanhead did and made a few substitutions.  My wife got a kick out of your name Beanhead.  She has a friend named Bean.  Anyway, I don't think children should be a part of reviews because they are so fickle.  One day they will like something and the next they won't.  This was a wondeful meal with the addition of noodles, boiled potatoes, mixed vegetables and a spinach salad.  My wife entertained both sets of parents and the evening was great.  Food was wonderful.  Thanks Jessica.

I was disappointed with this recipe. My family found it horribly sweet and I was dismayed that not one of my children finished their plate. The whole thing went in the trash! All that work for nothing. Definitely not the Swedish Meatballs Grandmom used to make!

I tried making this, it was really sweet for some reason.  The evaporated milk I used was only 8oz not 12oz like she says to use. It was pretty good but way too rich and sweet it almost tasted like dessert to me. Perhaps thats why the kids like it?  I'm reverting to my moms recipe of it since I know it tastes much better.. Instead of this rich gravy.

Not fond of making the little meatballs, but that's the worst of it.  Don't like all that sodium in soups. My kid doesn't like onions.  Flavor was mediocre.  Probably won't make again.

After misplacing my own copy of the recipe, I was looking for a good, simple, and basic recipe for Swedish Meatballs and I found it! I did substitute bread crumbs for the cream of wheat and added salt & pepper. Other than that, I did stick with the recipe. I thought these were very good and this recipe will definitely fill the shoes for the one I lost. Thanks!

My children loved this.  My husband thought it was too bland, but he puts hot sauce on everything, so he thinks anything that doesn't burn his mouth is bland.

I will make this again for the kids.

Great recipe.  I took reviewer's suggestion and added ground pepper and allspice.  I also substituted the cream of wheat for 1/2 C of breadcrumbs, and the evaporated milk for 8 oz of Fitmilk.  I usually don't make substitutions, but had to improvise.  Again, it was a great meal on this snowy night on the first day of spring ... yes, New England!

This was a big hit at our Christmas party!!  I needed a quick appitizer to put together -- I did substitut seasoned breadcrumbs for the cream of wheat, and had to use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of 1 can of cream of chicken-- but it was still wonderful -- It got so many compliments that I have already stocked up on the cream of chicken soup for the next time so I can do it right!!

This is a great base recipe.  It was extremely simple and with a few personal touches it will be a really big hit.  I made this for my husbands Christmas party at work and he said everyone raved about them.  I used a 2 lb. bag of prepared italian frozen meatballs instead of making my own to save time and doubled everything.  I used 1 golden mushroom soup in place of 1 cream of mushroom.  I added SALT and pepper and NUTMEG which really did the trick.  Super fast, easy and delicious.  I can't wait to make them for us!

The meatballs were not tasty enough.  Seems like something is missing from this recipe, but I could not figure out what it was.  Overall, still pretty good, but could be better.

MMMMM, my husband and I LOVED this recipe, the sauce was VERY good.  I think most of the reviews on here are before the correction to the recipe was posted.  What I did differently though is that I put everything in the crockpot after I cooked the meatballs for 20 min.  We served it over the wavey egg noodles, it was DELICIOUS. Another Keeeper!

Delicious! Cut the evap. Milk by 2 cans. Add coarse ground black pepper, and allspice. Cut some sodium and fat with Special Request Campbells soups 98%fat free and very lean ground beef 93/7. Try adding mushrooms also. Peas on the side are great mixed in is even better. This would be a very good dish for children since it is not real spicy. Taste like you were in the kitchen all day.

This was very easy.  I opted to use frozen meatballs which made it even more of a time saver.  My husband loved it because for years we would buy the frozen Stouffers product.  This was my first time making it and it came out perrrrrrfect.  Thanks

Overall, the dish turned out pretty good.  I think the difference between good & excellent would be a little thicker sauce and spicier meatballs.  However, this is an excellent recipe to begin playing with.

This was a pretty good recipe, although, there needed to be some more seasoning.  I added additional pepper and onion salt, but I don't think it was sufficient.  It needed a little more flavoring.  Overall, it made a good hearty meal.
