These are delicious! I made them with pepperoni and black olives, I left out the tomatoes because I do not like them, and it turned out great! We also have a large muffin pan, that makes oversized muffiins, so I made it in that, and they turned out perfectly. Mine turned out moist, possibly because I was watching it so closely after using a larger tin, but I do not beleive these would be good if they were dry, so moniter them closely. They also reheat well, and make for good lunches.

These are very adaptable to changes, just like pizza.  Add your favorite toppings.  I substitued part of the flour with 1/2 c whole wheat and 1/2 cup corn meal.  I used less cheese and added green pepper and pepperoni.  Very quick, adds a flavorful side to a simple meal.  I also used soured milk (milk and vinegar) in place of the buttermilk with no problems, and I like that there is no fat other than the pizza toppings.

Very good and very pretty. I used 1 1/2 cups cheddar and 1 cup jalapeno havarti, because that's what I had on hand. (If only using cheddar next time, I will add some hot pepper flakes.) Next time I will add some garlic and a couple extra tomatoes. I will also use only 1 tablespoon of sugar. Using a standard muffin tin with "Large" size papers, I made 16 muffins (the batter filled the tins to about 2/3's full). Baked for 15 minutes, they were perfect.

theses were awful, WAY too much cheese, we didn't even use all of it. Honest to god, we're teenagers too, so we're supposed to like cheese. Wow, way to go.

Very yummi. I made 14 of them. I added stuffed olives, jalapenos peppers and some extra tomatoes. They were great. I filled the muffin cups almost to 3/4 and that was a mistake :), cheese spread all over my pan. But still delicious.

This recipe was fantastic!  My then 16 year old daughter made it for the county fair & took the show!  She reduced sugar to 1 tablespoon and the cheddar cheese to 1-1/2 cups. Mixed 1/2 cup of the cheddar 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese & sprinkled over top of muffin for added color & texture.   She made with & without minced pepperoni.  Wonderful flavor!

I used whole wheat flour as it was all I had at the time and they turned out well.  Added a few extras - chopped up ham, olives and red bell pepper but cut back on the cheese because it seemed to be a bit too much for my liking.  It took a while to chop up the ingredients but the finished product was well worth it!

This is a great foundation recipe.  I cannot give it a five because I changed a lot of it.  I stuffed my muffins with pizza sauce in the middle by putting part of the batter in the muffin tin, added sauce, and placed the rest of the batter on the top.  Then, I drizzled more sauce on top of the muffin.  This is a great recipe because it is fast, easy, and versatile.  My family devoured these muffins, including my picky toddler.

Very good and easy. I added a tablespoon of garlic powder with parsley to the dry ingredients. I also added a tablespoon of chopped green chilies and some finely chopped pepperoni when I added the sundried tomatoes. In answer to Amanda...I combined the flour mixture and egg/buttermilk mixture before spooning into tins. I made 20 with one batch and did not have a problem with the cheese overflowing. This is definitely a keeper!

i just made these.  they came out good!  i used fresh tomatoes and basil (put them in oil).  i didn't have sundried tomatoes.  probably with sundried tomatoes it would've been better.  still, delicious.

Delicious! All my boys munched these down, 17 months, 5 years and 40 years (husband). It may have just been 4 stars, but I gave it 5 because of the versatility. You can vary the 'pizza topping' ingredients all you want. I did replace some of the white flour with white whole wheat and cornmeal like others suggested. The texture was great. Next time I make these I will make a kid batch and an adult batch. Then I can add garlic and onions and pepper flakes! Oh my.

Great recipe, similar to the one in the Chatalaine Magazine. I added a cup of diced pepperoni, I fried them first then added it to the batter, delicious!

These sound great, but do you add the buttermilk/egg mixture to the other bowl or do you brush the tops of the muffins with it?

Overall these were pretty good, but a bit bland.  I added some chopped pepperoni and omitted the sun dried tomatoes because my kids don't like them.  But it lacked overall flavor.  Next time I will add in some dry garlic (I'm normally a huge fan of fresh, but I don't think the garlic flavor will permeate the batter using fresh), and I will also add extra sharp cheddar.  I did use old cheese, but the flavor was too subtle.

These muffins are very good.  I did however modify the recipe. I omitted the tomatoes but  I did add Chorizo sausage, finely diced green peppers, black and green olives and fresh garden onion.  Amazing flavor combination.

These are really good, i omitted the onions and added pepperoni, salami and ham (making meatlovers muffins) this is a good base recipe which you can tweak to your liking, ham and pinapple is next on my list.  Thanks Karen, simple low in fat (when using low fat cheese) and tasty!

Good! I used 1 1/2C APF, 1/2C of whole-wheat flour and cornmeal like another reviewer have done, added pepperoni and cooked minced beef on top of the batter, then sprinkled mozzarella and cheddar mixture on the very top, baked for 17 min.   They taste good (wouldn’t go wrong with meat&cheese in it LOL ) although hubby said it lacks of “pizza” flavor so he consumed (a lot of) them wiz ketchup... so next time I’ll try add some homemade pizza sauce into the batter, decrease the buttermilk, maybe sprinkle some ground pizza seasoning on top.....Came out 21 medium size muffins.

Really good! I messed up and put two eggs instead of one, but I think I'll do that next time too. I won't use muffin cups again though, as these really stuck with the gluten free flour I used. other than that, delicious! I may sub out the sundried tomatoes for pizza sauce next time, but would have to use more flour then, I guess. very yummy!

When they were made them with sun dried tomatoes, they turned out doughy and not very yummy, but when I used artichoke hearts instead of sun dried tomatoes, they were wonderful!

I didn't care for them, but my extremely picky 3 year old ate them like there was no tomorrow.  They didn't have a muffin like consistency to me.

I found these bland on their own.  The muffin itself is great though so I upped the herbs and pizza ingredients (ie: peppers, onion, pepperoni, etc) and added a dollop of pizza sauce to the top before cooking.  5 stars with the changes.

I just made this recipe - not bad at all.  I did make some changes as per the other reviewers.
I still used white flour as that was all I had but next time I will try whole wheat.
I added 2 tsp of Italian Seasoning Herbs which was good, I also added 1 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and (which I may increase next time) and 1/2 tsp onion powder.  I didn't added the sundried tomatos, but I did add about 1 c of minced green pepper and about 1c of minced turkey kolbossa.
I only used 1 tbsp of sugar, no onions - due to picky toddler - 1.25c buttermilk and .25c olive oil.  I added 1 c cheese into the flour mixture, added 2tsp finally grated parm cheese and finally I topped the muffins off with pizza sauce on top with some mozz cheese.  I also made another batch and put pizza sauce in the middle as well as on top and topped it off with cheese.  They are really good.  We will see how good in a day or two though ;)

the sun-dried tomatoes add good flavor, definitely add something else too or they come out a little bland. would be perfect with marinara sauce, just like pizza to offset any blandness. great recipe!

Tasty.  Although, instead of the oil soaked sun dried tomatoes, I just rehydrated 1/2 cup of dehydrated ones making about a cup of plump sun dried tomatoes.

Quite tasty. I added a can of diced tomatoes with chipotle peppers, made them VERY moist. Sprinkled mozzarella cheese on top. Yummy!

These were pretty good. maybe a little wet. I think I was worried about the dryness and over compensated. Used  some sun dried tomato bruschetta in place of the tomatos (couldn't find what the recipe called for). Proabably won't make again though.

These muffins were a good idea but pretty dry.  You might be better off making french bread pizza as a side dish.  It would take less time too.

Delicious! It was a little cheesy for me, but I think that's because I tried halving the recipe and accidentally mismeasured the cheese...so yeah that was my bad. But on another note, I do think it's worth noting that the instructions regarding the incorporation of the buttermilk+eggs and the dry ingredients is a little vague
