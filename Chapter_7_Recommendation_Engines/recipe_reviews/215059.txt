This salad is amazing. Surprisingly the candied walnuts are super easy to make. This will definitely WOW the people it is served too.

Delicious and so easy! I've used the sliced onion or chopped scallions in the past, and have subbed goat cheese for the feta but I pretty much love this salad no matter what small changes I've made.  I like whisk together the oil and vinegar with a tsp of dijon mustard, too.

Incredible salad! The ingredients are so fresh and summery tasting! Everyone at the party wanted the recipe. I made it exactly as written with the addition of sliced blackberries.  5 stars!  Wish I could give it 10!

LOVE this salad! We are not huge fans of spinach in my house but wanted to find a healthy salad to add to our routine and came across this, it is great! The only changes I made were leaving out the nuts and rather than vinegar and oil I used a fat free sweet onion dressing, DELICIOUS!

This. Salad. Is. The. BOMB! I make this for a side salad many times during the week - much more flavorful than a plain old salad. I also add mandarin oranges and craisins. I can't believe how well all the flavors go together - a taste explosion in my mouth!

I love spinach, feta and balsamic vinegar so I was really looking forward to this but I found that the strawberries overpowered the dish. I will make this again but I'll whisk the vinegar and oil together and omit the berries.  Thanks!!

I used Blue cheese crumbles instead of Feta, personal preference, and it was the best Strawberry Salad I've fixed in a long time. Will be making this again but will be adding grilled chicken as well.
