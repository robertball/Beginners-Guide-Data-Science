Awesome salad! I only put half the olive oil and just a little extra lime juice, and I added a cup of canned pinto beans...just because I was in the mood. Served with tortilla strips on top for some crunch, and it was perfect. I can't wait to make it for our family on vacation!

As guacamole salads go, this was average, but as salads in general go, it was great. I tweaked it a bit: used half the avocado (I like a salad to have more of a varied texture), fresh garlic, fresh roasted green chiles instead of jalapenos, and just a drizzle of olive oil (the avocados add enough of a creamy texture). I thought it could have used more lime juice for more of a vinegary bite, but my lime was pretty dry. I added hot sauce, and that put it over the edge.

Very good salad. I did not use as many avocados. I chopped up one avocado for the salad and mashed 1/2 of another avocado with the seasoning and used it as a dressing. (I omitted the olive oil.) I will make this again. It was tasty and creamy and very filling.

I would say it's one of the best guacamole salad for me. I'm not a lettuce fan and this suited me well! I'll be sure to make this one again.

What I did with this recipe was omit the cucumber and the jalapeno for my kids and just mashed the avacado and added all the other ingrediants but only a tablespoon of olive oil and made it like a guacamole dip with corn. I had it for dinner one night with corn tortillas and I smeared it on with some grilled chicken and crushed tortilla chips and it was terrific!!

I thought this tasted pretty good. I liked all of the texture and the color. It would make a nice side dish to a grilled flank steak or something similar. I made a 1/2 recipe to try it and got about 3 servings. I used frozen defrosted corn, peeled seedless cucumber cubed, and added the minced red onion and the lime juice to taste. I realized after I made it I forgot to add the garlic salt and didn't add the jalepeno to keep the heat off. I might just sprinkle some garlic salt on top. It is definitely a make fresh kind of salad too.

Delicious, refreshing salad.  Added one stalk celery sliced for a little crunch.  Leftovers good the next day.  Easy, make ahead preparation.  I made it with chili verde and it was a hit.  Will definitely make again.  Highly recommend.

I made this recipe (without the corn, but otherwise exactly as written) for Cinco de Mayo.  Served it alongside Ancho Chicken Tacos from another site, and we all really enjoyed this as an accompaniment!  Thanks for sharing; I'll be making this one again, for sure.

I only used 2 avocados, omitted the olive oil and garlic salt. Use 1/2 tsp minced garlic. I forgot to scoop the seeds out of my tomatoes, but it turned out fine. I juiced two limes and used about a tsp of sea salt. I only used half the jalape√±o and half the red onion-finely chopped. The cucumber didn't really belong here. I will replace it with cilantro next time. This is great on nachos. I added the avocado last so it wouldn't brown. Great starter recipe and way better than any store bought.

I used 3 ears of fresh corn, no jalapenos but added cayenne pepper to taste. In the dressing, I made a mistake and added too much salt, I compensated by adding honey to even it out.  Delicious!

This was simple to make and delicious. My husband gobbled it up and it went well with fish tacos. I will definitely be making this again.
