Delicious!  I will definatly keep this recipe--husband and young kids loved it and I've passed it along to all of my relatives.  
My changes: I was out of broth so I used boullion and cut the total liquids to 4 cups as my roast was 5#.  I used plain old black pepper; not freshly ground.  I didn't baste every 1/2 hour (wasn't home) and found that it didn't need to be basted--just extra work.  Put it in there and forget about it.
Next time I'll chop the veggies finely in the food processor beforehand so I don't have to smash them or strain them. The sauce is so rich and good. 
Oven temp at 200째F was a bit low so I upped it to 215째F after 3 hours and watched it closely.  I let the internal temp get past 140째F, and at 145째F it was just a little too overdone for me (not red in the middle), but excellent nonetheless.
I served this roast after setting for 1 hour (instead of chilled overnight) and placed the leftover portion cut-side up in a bowl so as to retain the juices.
This is by far, bar none, the BEST roast beef recipe I've ever tasted!

This was outstanding. The flavor was as I remembered the sandwich that was at festivals in NW PA dduring my youth.

Fantastic flavor, very similar to roast beef I have had in New England delis.  Didn't use the carrots because I didn't have them.  Do brown the roast before cooking to give it a lovely color.

Wonderful deli style homemade roast beef. Reminds me of when I worked in a deli in NY state. This is the roast beef I've been missing since I moved from NY.

I grew up in the Ox Roast epicenter of the world... Erie, Pa.   This is really, really good.... worth noting when reviewing the pictures, you do not have to use a Steelers crock pot... although, it does add flavor...

This is fantastic and a great money saver!  Smith's brand ox roast can sell from $5 to $7 a pound.  There were two things I did different.  1.  I used bottom round ($2.89/lb) and 2. I didn't have time to baste as suggested so I placed plastic wrap over the roast and veggies and covered it all aluminum foil to try and lock in all the moisture.  Great recipe!

I had no idea that you could just buy ox roast so I made this recipe.  Not bad, but not good either.
