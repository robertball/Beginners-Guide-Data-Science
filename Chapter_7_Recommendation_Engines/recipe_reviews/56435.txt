I was surprised that this recipe had such a lack luster response!!!  It is a great basis to go from when making this type of turkey burgers!  After reading the review, I decided to slightly modify the recipe:
I used tomato/basil feta cheese, used sweet and spicy banana peppers chopped, chopped onion, garlic powder, extra basil, and cracked peppercorns (ground).  I couldn't put these down!  I only made two small patties (i only had a small amount of ground turkey), and I wish I had more because I would have eaten them all!

I did not deviate from the recipe's ingredients.  However, I made the burgers and let them refrigerate overnight.  I think this was the key to ensuring the burgers retained moisture and the banana peppers really marinated/tenderized the turkey meat.  The burgers did not fall apart either and no, I didn't add any binders i.e., eggs, bread crumbs, etc.  Yes, the feta disappears into the burger (ref: Holly's comment) but you can still taste it.  I really like this but I think the key is putting all the ingredients together and letting it marinate overnight.  So easy and tasty that I will make again.

I am giving this five stars both for the taste and ease of preparation.  I did add two tablespoons minced onion and about 1/4 cup finely shredded Mexican blend cheese because I was cleaning out the fridge.  I used Athenos reduced fat tomato and basil crumbled feta cheese.  My entire family, including picky boys 2, 9 and 11, thought they were delicious.  Thanks for the recipe-we will be using it again!

This is one of my FAVORITE turkey burger recipes! There is such a nice melody of flavors between the peppers, feta and meat. This is a huge hit at my house. Give this recipe a try!

All I can say is... WOW!!! These were fantastic! I didn't change the recipe one bit and the burgers came out great. Up until now, our favorite turkey burgers were a recipe from this site called "Spicy Chipotle Turkey Burgers", but now after trying this one, there will be some serious competition between the two in our house. This recipe was SUPER SIMPLE with very few ingredients and SUPER FLAVORFUL results. I used a bit of A-1 steak sauce on mine and my husband used mustard on his... both ways were extremely tasty, but truthfully, they were even good just plain. My thanks to JENA-RATOR for submitting this one. Definitely worthy of more than five stars!

I am a bonfide beef lover.  For me, ground turkey is not a good fit in many dishes - mostly due to the texture.  However, I am now sold on turkey burgers and I see that they are very popular.  This is the first one I tried - loved it!!!  I happened to buy a ground turkey that already  had italian seasoning in it and the burgers ended up tasting like a mild sausage.  The texture was thick and hearty.  My entire family enjoyed them.

The recipe as stated was a starting point for me...I was afraid they wouldn't hold together well so I added 1 egg and 1/2 cup bread crumbs, 1/2 can black beans, 3 cloves garlic and 1/2 cup cheddar cheese...cooked on the Forman and topped with more cheddar cheese, a little salsa and avocado...served with Broccoli slaw (see the Coleslaw with a difference recipe)...really good...even my 3 year old loved 'em.

Decent attempt, but the recipe doesn't really provide for a quality turkey burger that differs from a normal turkey burger.  I thought the addition of the banana peppers and the feta cheese would provide for a unique texture and taste, but both failed to really get the difference that I was looking for.  

Good taste, but a normal turkey burger is less work and tastes about the same.  Go for another recipe.

Delicious! So simple, yet so good. I did add a little garlic powder and ground black pepper to the mixture. I also patted the burgers in cornmeal before putting onto my George Foreman grill, which gave them a nice crunchy exterior. The banana peppers from my garden are super hot, so I only used 1 large pepper, which was more like 1/8 cup chopped. Fantastic flavor. I will make these again! Thank you for sharing! :)

I added a bit of basil, fresh garlic and red onion as others suggested.  It had a decent flavor, just kind of weak, and they were super dry.

I had a 2 pound package of ground turkey from Costco so I doubled the recipe.  Took the advise from others and added chopped onion, garlic and dried basil.  I added zero salt.  Let this sit in the fridge overnight and cooked for lunch.  My "I'll never eat diet food" hubby ate 2 and was eye balling a third one.  Can't wait to take in my lunch tomorrow.

I don't typically like turkey burgers but the feta cheese and peppers were just the right mix for our late night business planning session!!

Sorry. I wanted to like this. But it wasn't for me. I think it was the peppers. I love all the ingredients but I didn't like the way it turned out for me. The 1st batch was a completed disaster....all burgers were soo soft on the grill....the crumbled right threw the grate when I tried to flip them. Oh I was so upset. Tried a 2nd time. And that's when I found that the peppers where too overwhelming for me. I liked the feta. Don't think I'll make this combination of a recipe again.

Boy do I need to read the ingredients closer. I saw banana and thought sounds interesting. When it was time to make I had the bananas ready when I noticed it said banana PEPPERS.  Oh well I threw the banana in anyway (no peppers) found some chili pepper and cayenne adding just a pinch of both. SURPRISE! it turned out tasty. I will have to follow the recipe closer when I try it again.

I expected my husband and son to groan at these, but they both liked them.  My husband even had seconds and claimed another for his lunch.  I made them the night before and froze the burgers, then took them out to defrost in the morning.  No problems with them falling apart.  I usually get ground turkey in a 20.8 oz. package, so I increased the peppers to 1/3 cup and feta to 2/3 cup and the # of burgers to 6.  I bought a jar of banana peppers and couldn't remember if they were supposed to be hot or mild, so I just got mild.  When I reread the reviews, seems most people used hot.  My husband had barbeque sauce on his.  I think lettuce and tomato would have been a good addition, but I only had grape tomatoes.  I may add cheddar or pepper-jack on top next time, but that's just because we really like melted cheese on our burgers.

I had to switch out the turkey for organic lean beef, as no lean ground turkey meat on hand and also used diced red peppers as no hot banana peppers. I recommend using more diced peppers then the recipe calls for though. Great on the grill!

I love the idea of feta and hot peppers but had to give a 4 because you need some more seasoning, an egg, breadcrumbs, bbq sauce and garlic cream cheese makes this the ultimate moist burger.

I made these exactly as suggested: just banana peppers, feta cheese, and turkey.  I was skeptical and worried that they might be too bland or that the patties might not stick together, but I was wrong on both counts.  These were DELICIOUS and so, so easy.  Ever since I made them my boyfriend has been asking when we're having turkey burgers again (and this from a guy who formerly would have said, "Turkey burgers?! That's too healthy! Gross!")

I thought these were great. My family thought so too.  Very easy yet flavorful. I mixed ground light and dark meat which  I think helps with the flavor and keeping it from falling apart. We will certainly have these again.

These are awesome.  Hubby is a true meat & potatoes kind of guy and he said he liked them better than regular hamburgers.  Definitely a keeper.

LOVED these burgers! What a wonderful flavor from so few ingredients. I used pickled banana peppers because that's all I had at the time, but I can't wait to try this with fresh banana peppers! Because of the juice from the pickled ones, I had to add some whole wheat bread crumbs. I also added an egg to bind it together since my ground turkey breast had so little fat. These were a hit at my dinner party, even the men enjoyed them! :o) FYI: I added minced garlic and mixed the ingredients together and formed them into patties in advance as per other reviewers recommendations for the flavors to develop. Delish!

We liked these just as written. I didn't add any salt as my pickled peppers were salty enough (as was my cheese). Thanks for the recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Tasted good but nothing special.  Had more banana pepper flavor the next day.

This has become one of our favorite turkey burgers.  I only gave it 4 stars because I have altered it some to our likings.  I make them with 1 lb gr turkey, 1-2 chopped pepperoncini, 5-6 small roasted peppers (chopped), 1/2 lb feta crumbled, 7-8 chopped calamata olives.  When grilling, make a well in center of burgers.  Spray grill w/ olive oil before placing burgers on .

Great Burger! I made it 3 times now--my teens are addicted. The first time I used ground turkey breast and it was healthier but a little dry for the grill. The next time I used regular ground turkey and at the last minute, keeping with the greek theme, I decided to chop a handful of fresh spinach and mixed in greek seasoning and it was AWESOME. The third time I used ground sirloin, blue cheese and jalapeno  peppers at my kids' request and ended up with another great burger. So simple. I can't believe I never thought to do this before. When my teenagers have friends over, this will be THE burger. For a beautiful presentation, I lightly toasted artisan bread and served it open-face with the burger on one slice and the other with a smidgen of mayo & fresh spinach and a slice of both red and yellow tomato.

Burgers are burgers, what sets each one apart is/are condiments, ground meat choice (as well as texture), and meat mix ingredients. This one is a good pairing of tastes, and places easily onto my "We do burgers like this" list....I probably would use the "surprise inside" approach as feta melts easily and I cry when any cheese drips onto my coals. I will be loving this....John out.

Simple but gourmet!
I love the cheese mixed in with the burger; would make camping so simple. That said I made these on my stovetop. Also, the banana peppers eliminated any need for pickles for topping.
Next time I will add some extra feta since with the suggested 1/2 cup you could hardly tell it was there. Could also use some basic spices (but not necessary)

I did use a little bread crumbs to help the burger hold together.  THE BEST TURKEY BURGER EVER! Don't be afraid of the hot banana peppers, it was not too spicy.  Just moist and tasty.  I would say better than a ground beef burger!  YUMMY!

this was excellent, but you definitely need a binder. i defrosted a pound of ground turkey and it was way too wet for the patties to stay together!   i added italian flavored breadcrumbs, montreal steak seasoning, and probably more feta and banana peppers than the recipe called for. splashed with some worschestire while it was grilling and served on really soft ciabatta rolls with bbq sauce. so yummy! and my husband and our friend agreed!

Since turkey burgers are the default 'burgers' at my house, I'm always on the lookout for something different.  And this is it.  No extra binders or fillers to muddle the taste of the feta and banana peppers (I used the hot variety).  Topped the burgers with tzatziki sauce, lettuce and tomato... fantastic!  ~thanks JENA-RATOR.

Another excellent turkey burger!  I have made a few from this site and this one did not let me down!  I added a couple cloves of minced garlic and the hardest part for me was finding banana peppers!  My grocery store didn't have them (well, fresh anyway), so I opted for what I think was a yellow hot pepper (tasted a piece while I was dicing and it definitely had some bite).  It was a long (about 6 or 7 inches), skinny pepper, yellowish in colour (not bright like a sweet yellow pepper).  Regardless, it was yummy and I diced the whole thing.  The feta does kind of get lost in there (taste wise), but any way you slice it, great burger!

I was hoping for more flavor.  Guess I used mild banana peppers instead of hot.  Would definitely add more feta than called for.

I had to look up what what a banana pepper is and once I figured out that I found it. I really liked these burgers. Different taste which I find refreshing. I did add barbque sauce to it and that was delicous. Thank you for sharing!

These were really good. I recently started the south beach diet and these fit in perfectly with my meal plan. The only thing I did differently was, I added some sun dried tomatoes and seasoned it with Spike all purpose seasoning (love that stuff!) Would definitely recommend this recipe! Thanks for sharing it with us :o)

Very good and so so easy!! I have made other tukey burgers from this site and always have trouble with them sticking together.  I was shocked that without any egg or breadcrumbs these stuck together perfectly! I did pour in just a little of the juice from the peppers to the meat mix, trying to up the flavor just a bit (maybe like 1/4 cup). Also, I let the meat mix sit in the fridge for about 6 hours before patting out, to really soak up flavor.  Otherwise, made as is.  Would make again for sure!

I really wanted to give 4.5 stars if I could.  I never used any peppers in a burger before, but the burger came out flavorful and full of freshness.  Just not as much as I hoped for.  Also, the Feta cheese was excellent, and I felt no need for cheese slices in the burger.  Just tomato and red onion slices and low-fat mayo.  I used the Foreman grill, and the burger stayed together.  I will try more tips from other reviews in the future.

I loved these burgers!  It was super easy to make them, too. I poured some of the juice from the peppers on top of each burger for extra moisture, and let them sit in the fridge for 1-2 hours.  I had a hard time finding the right condiment for this burger, with its unique taste; I topped it with avocado and next time will make some homemade gauc for a condiment. Great recipe--thanks!!

These turned out juicy and tasty. We added a packet of Italian salad dressing mix to the mixture and it added a lot of flavor. I also used our pattie press to form the burgers (I love this gadget!), and the 8 mins per side cooking time was right on the money. You want an internal temp of these to be between 170-180. Thanks for this!

This was awsome and healthy!!!  I used a lite bun to cut back on the calories as well as using the ground turkey.  I also added a sprinkles of garlic powder and onion powder.  Delish... I'm having it again tonight for the second night in a row.

Watch out.  I cooked this in a skillet using olive oil.  What a mess.  Spatter everywhere. I used a 85-15% grind of Turkey.  Flavor is good, but you need to be more creative with seasoning than S&P.  Do what your family likes.  I added sofrito (hispanic touch).

These were simple, quick, and delicious!  I used garlic salt and added a slice of 2% pepperjack cheese on top, and served on a whole wheat bun...yummy favorite in our home now!

You don't need a binder. Either use semi defrosted frozen ground turkey or put the patties in the fridge or freezer for 15 minutes. This is a great throw together meal for me since I always have frozen ground turkey.

Great taste.  But the burgers fell apart.  I should have known to add my old stand by binders.

The feta kind of disappeared in the burger, but it did provide some extra taste. I think I will stick with "actually delicious turkey burgers" from this site as they stay more moist and maybe add the peppers and feta to those.

Why are these called BBQ?  I don't get it.    I accidentally tried to use a Hungarian yellow pepper instead of a banana pepper.  Luckily I tasted it first and it was so hot I almost cried.  SO, I put in a green onion instead of the banana pepper - I also seasoned these with Old Bay - I thought they were the best turkey burgers I ever had; although I didn't exactly follow the recipe, I have given this 4 stars.

These were great!  I didn't have Feta cheese on hand so I used crumbled Bleu Cheese instead - very tasty!  Would highly recommend!

These were wonderful. Made them just as the recipe stated. I didn't know if my picky husband or son would eat a turkey burger, but we all loved it. My daughter grew banana peppers in biology class last year and I found this recipe for them. Definitely will make again.

I cooked these on the stovetop, following the recipe as written, and thought they were delicious. That being said, I'm 85% positive that the extra-lean ground turkey I used probably wouldn't have held together on the grill; I had to be extremely careful when turning them to keep them from crumbling in the pan.

I thought the flavor was great – I topped my burger with a little mayo, lettuce and tomato, and used a regular hamburger bun. The banana peppers I used were more sweet than hot, and they provided a subtle flavor that was a nice change of pace. My husband said he couldn't really taste the peppers or feta, but he's heavy-handed with ketchup, so he may have just drown out the flavor.

I'll be having a leftover patty crumbled over salad for lunch today, and I'm already excited to try this recipe again with a higher-fat-content ground turkey to see if it will hold together better. It's good enough that I'll find a way to make it work!

This is one of the best burgers I've ever made!
Adjustments: 
- add 2 eggs to ground turkey
- add avocado
- sub feta for goat cheese
- sub bun for sautéed green beans with sliced almonds and garlic
- add ginger spiced mustard from farmers market (place in odd shape on burger)

great recipe! My red seal chef husband was skeptical. But they turned out great! I did not add egg or bread crumbs. I used pickled banana peppers because it is all I had on hand. I doubled the feta and added some chopped red onion. mixed and formed about 2 hours ahead and put in fridge. Burgers did not fall apart and stayed nice and moist on the BBQ. Hubby had 3 burgers and actually bragged about them to the neighbor! Its a keeper for sure! Thanks!
