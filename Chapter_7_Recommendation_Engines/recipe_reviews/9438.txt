Yum! My boyfriend couldn't keep his hands off of these! 

I took advice from some of the other reviews and made a few changes. I cut the spices down by half and upped it to  3/4 c of eggnog. I also made eggnog frosting using powdered sugar,  eggnog and a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon. I dyed the frosting bright yellow to make them a bit more cute.

Yes, the nutmeg flavour is strong, they are great warm, but also great when they harden.  No, they are not a fancy cut out or decorated cookie but they are so easy to make!  I have given them to many people and used them for a cookie exchange and they were a big hit with everyone.  My oldest son loves them, my youngest doesn't like them at all.  If you like nutmeg, cinnamon, and eggnog, you'll love them.
PS.  If you don't like them crunchy, substitute brown sugar for all or half of the white sugar; they'll stay soft.

My family loved these.  I did make a few changes, more eggnog in the cookie dough.  Baked for only 15-17 minutes.  Made frosting with eggnog, powdered sugar, and nutmeg.  Garnished with sliced almonds.

Made these yesterday and can tell I will need to make again this week. For those who don't think they look pretty; roll dough into 1" balls and bake. When cool sift with combined powdered sugar and nutmeg. Beautiful!

This is the BEST eggnog cookie I have EVER had!! The only thing I changed was I put about 1/2 cup of eggnog as opposed to the 1/4 cup of eggnog it called for. I think if I had put the requested 1/4 cup in, it would not have been enough to give it that distinctive eggnog flavor. It was just right ~ not too strong, but not bland either. Yummy!! I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!

Very yummy!!  As others have suggested, I used half the nutmeg (ie. 1/2 tsp) and they were perfect... I did not find them "ugly" like some other reviewers said.  Not exactly an elegant cookie, but not ugly - just make your teaspoons of dough a little bit "rounded" and they should be ok.  However, I only cooked them for 8-10 minutes -- not the 20-23 minutes called for.  Whoa!  I would've been calling the fire dept. by then!!  DO watch for brown edges on the cookies, and then take them out right away - they will remain nice and soft, even after cooling.  I also made sure to use butter, as I had some fairly disappointing results with another cookie recipe recently when I substituted margarine for butter.  These are wonderful cookies to share!!

I tried this recipe last year at Christmas.  It was requested again this year.  It is now a holiday tradition!  I used a cookie press this year, which makes more attractive cookies.  They are the best!

This recipe is nice and easy to make.  I tried one of the other eggnog cookie recipes and my 4 year old took one bite and gave it back. I tried this one second and everyone loved it.  My husband who's a picky eater kept coming back for me.  Also, definitely cut the nutmeg portion in half.  Otherwise, it will overpower the cookie.

These cookies are very good. However, it did not come without changes to the recipe. Let me start... first, is used butter flavored crisco instead of the butter, used half white sugar and half brown sugar and added only half of the vanilla with the other half being rum flavoring. Plus I'm using a simple cookie frosting using eggnog and rum flavoring. Very good cookie, this is a keeper!!

I like the Eggnog Cookies II (also on this site) better than this one. It adds more flour and helps make a more stable cookie. Both recipes are very easy to make and have a fairly mild eggnog flavor. That is why I like to give them as gifts. The eggnog flavor is not too overpowering. If you are a die hard eggnog fan, these cookies will be too bland for you.

I love these cookies and have ever since I found the recipe in a Christmas cookie cookbook.  Easy to make and always a hit with friends.  My recipe always had 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I use that or less when making these cookies and don't sprinkle any on the top.  Instead I make an eggnog glaze to drizzle over the top- 1.5 cup confectioner sugar, 1-2 tbs butter very soft, 1 tsp vanilla- mix together.  Than add eggnog to drizzle consistency.  Fantastic way to increase the eggnog flavor.

I had just purchased some Eggnog cookies at a bake sale and they were so good had to run home and recreate.  This recipe was exactly what I was looking for!  I did tweak it based on others reviews (I used a little more eggnog and only 1/2 tsp. vanilla)..but the one thing I copied from the bake sale cookies that I thought really added a lot of flavor was after the batter was mixed, I folded in about 1/2 cup pecan pieces.  I used the powdered sugar/eggnog frosting and then sprinkled a few pecan pieces on the top.  I also shaped them into longer cookies..just because that's what they looked like at the bake sale, but I'm sure they'd be just as cute round.  A yummy addition to my cookie swap this year.

My oldest daughter hates cookies but loves eggnog, so I thought I would give these a try.  She ate them up so they must be good.  I personally am not an eggnog fan but they sure made my house smell good.  As with other reviews, I cut the nutmeg in half and used 3/4 cup eggnog.  I also used a bit more vanilla.  I made a frosting using 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 1/2 cup of eggnog.  They look and smell great and they passed the test of a non-cookie eater.

YUMMY!  I'll need to make another batch to give away because hubby and I keep eating these!  Another review suggested a glaze of 1 cup confectioners sugar with 2 Tbsp. eggnog (we used 3); this was a nice finishing touch to the cookie, especially with nutmeg sprinkled over the glaze.  I got 24 cookies out of this recipe and, since they didn't spread much while baking, will definitely make them smaller and flatter next time.  And there WILL be a next time - did I say yum?

These cookies are VERY rich. Like others, I increased the egg nog to 3/4 C, increased the flour to 2 1/2 cups, decreased the nutmeg to 1/2 teaspoon and used 1/2 tsp rum extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla. They were done in 14 minutes. I coated the cookies in colored sugar because anything else would've been too much. The dough is way to sticky to put in a press and they come out 'ugly' if you don't do something. I dropped it onto a cookie sheet and the lightly rolled it into a ball before sprinkling the sugar on it. The cookies came out round and not as ugly.

I did what the other reviewers suggested and upped the eggnog to 3/4 cup of eggnog and went half and half with white sugar and brown sugar.  They weren't turning out to be the most beautiful cookies so I chilled the dough in the fridge and rolled them into balls and then flattened them a tad right before sticking them into the oven. Flavor was great, just perfect for me and my family!

This appears to be the exact recipe i've been using for several years now.  I can't remember my source, some other now unknown website.  Regardless these cookies are great!  

I'm not an eggnog drinker, but love these cookies.  They're soft and have just the perfect amount of spice.  You will always find Eggnog Cookies amoung my holiday baking goodies somewhere.

Good recipe with the changes suggested by the other reviewers.  I also cut the amount of nutmeg down to 1/4 tsp.  I changed the sugar to 1/2 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown.  The dough is a little strange when you drop by a teaspoon so I put the dough into a ziploc bag and then cut a corner to make my cookie mounds.  I then wet my finger with water and pushed down in the middle of the cookie to give it a better shape.  This made beautiful round cookies.  I did not sprinkle any additional nutmeg on the cookie since I feel it is such a strong spice.  After baking, I iced the cookies with a powdered sugar icing mixed with rum.  This gave the cookie an extra zing.  I only wish that the recipe would have used up more of my eggnog but I am now looking at a bundt cake that uses leftover nog or french toast.

Pretty good cookies, I did use 2x as much eggnog and did the sugar 1/2 brown 1/2 white.  Tasty and different.  Mine stayed soft - maybe should have cooked longer so they would get crispier. But still enjoyed them for something different.

These are pretty good - my husband who is not a fan of eggnog likes them.  I used brown sugar and added extra 1/4 cup flour and 1/4 eggnog, baked at 325 for 15-20 minutes and glazed with eggnog icing.   However, this recipe does not make 6 dozen as stated - I got 3 dozen out of the batch I made and had to make an additional batch for the cookie party I was going to.

You could definitely taste the eggnog flavor of these cookies.  Yum!  Very sweet, especially with a glaze.   GLAZE:  1 cup powdered sugar mixed with 2 tablespoon eggnog.  Like others, I increased the eggnog to 3/4 a cup and used brown sugar for half of the amount of white called for.  Would make again.

I liked this recipe as a base since it did turn out nice, soft, cakelike cookies. I did use salted butter and added a 1/2 tsp of salt which was not called for in the recipe. Additionally, I added a generous teaspoon of rum extract along with the vanilla. After they baked I frosted them with a frosting I'd made with conf. sugar, butter, eggnog and more rum and vanilla extracts. With these changes the cookies real tasted like eggnog.

the eggnog flavor is mild with a little nutmeg flavor which is perfect, crispy on the edge and a little chewy in the center...so delicious. it took me 30 min of baking to have the bottoms turn light brown.

Amazing!!! I'm not an EggNog fan but my husband is, so I gave the recipe a try. I made a frosting to go with the cookies: I blended cream cheese with icing sugar, eggnog, pinch of cinnamon, and a pinch of nutmeg.  The perfect pair to these cookies.

Made these cookies combining the changes that were recommended, they were great. I ended up using 1/2 brown sugar, and a little more eggnog. A basic glaze-frosting worked out the best.

Great cookies, yum! Although, they were made a LOT better with a dash of Rum Extract... I would definitely suggest that!

While not a fancy looking cookie, the taste is absolutely awesome. My family loved them!!  Upped the eggnog a little and decreased the nutmeg only slightly.  (Note that nutmeg is notorius for overpowering a recipe, esp if it's good quality and a fresh new jar - so go easy...you can always add more).  I iced them with eggnog frosting to dress them up for a cookie exchange, but they were delicious on their own.

Yummy recipe!  I agree that the nutmeg needs to be cut in 1/2.  The first batch I made was a little strong on the nutmeg.  Also, I mixed sugar and cinnamon and sprinkled those on the cookies before baking.  That was a nice addition.

These cookies were great, a very different taste from all the other recipes I've tried. I went with some of the other reviews and cut down to half a tsp of nutmeg. Also, I made them smaller, about 2 bite size and that made them better for gifts, but for at home, I made them a little bigger.

These were great.  I did 1/2 white sugar 1/25 brown and reduced the amount of allspice.  I also made a glaze out of 1.5 cup powder sugar, 2 tbls soft butter and enough eggnog to get the consistency I wanted.

I made these cookies for Christmas and my entire family devoured them. Even for people who don't like eggnog these could just be considered your normal sugar/spice cookies with a little extra kick.

I took the others suggestions and cut the nutmeg in half, increased the eggnog to 3/4 cup and used all brown sugar. I did have to bake them for 20 minutes, but I am at high altitude too. I also made a frosting of powered sugar, eggnog and  1/2 teaspoon  rum flavoring, then sprinkled chopped pecans on top. Hubby was skeptical, until he tasted one - Glad I made a lot!!

These are great!  Like others have said - they won't win any awards in the looks category, but they taste wonderful.  I love the fact that outside of the eggnog - I always have all the ingredients on hand for these and they are not too expensive to make.  I made these exactly as written, except for using half white sugar and half brown.I took mine out at 17.5 minutes and they were just brown on the bottom, crispy on top and soft in the middle.  I work at a university and we provide cookies for our students during finals and I am sure everyone will love these tomorrow!

If I were to try this recipe again I would follow it exactly.I took some other reviewers ideas and cut the nutmeg in half and added extra eggnog. They turned out, but were bland and did not have a very nice texture.

My family loves eggnog, but you can hardly taste it in these;even if you let them sit a day so that the flavor matures...I've tried them twice, can't say I'll do it again.

so delicious! since i wanted a cookie where the eggnog flavor actually shined through i went with what others suggested and upped the amount to 3/4 cup of eggnog, and then added a few more tbl spoons of flour. I also added a big fat pinch of salt to the dry mix. As for sugar i did 3/4 cup white and  1/2 brown.  I only got 3 dozen cookies out of the batch, but i DID make larger ones. I put the batter in the refrigerator for a few minutes so i was able to roll them, so they would come out puffier and more round. sprinkled the tops with sugar and cinnamon after they came out of oven. Super nice fluffy cookies, i believe putting the batter in the fridge for a while helped out. Will be making these again around the Christmas season. Thanks for sharing!

This is a cake-like cookie.  I should have known that when I saw the baking powder in the recipe.  If you're looking for a more dense, sugar cookie"ish" texture, keep looking!

These cookies are out of this world!! They are so incredibly soft, and be sure to make the eggnog icing for the top. I colored it with orange food coloring to be festive. 

My husband said they are the best cookies he's ever had (in the soft sugar cookie category).  I too fell in love. We will be sure to make these often. Ohh and I too used 3/4 cup of eggnog as I am a big fan of it :) ENJOY

This recipe turned out wonderful!  I made these cookies for our neighborhood cookie exchange and everybody loved them.  I don't even like eggnog very much, but I enjoyed the softness of these cookies and wonderful flavor.  Only change that I made was to add extra eggnog (about 3/4 cup).  Wonderful!

I love these cookies.  They are not too sweet and they are sooooo simple to make.  However, the guests at my cookie baking party didn;t like them too much.  The reason they didn't like them is because they didn't have much flavor and weren't sweet.  I really likes the subtle flavor and the fact that they weren;t sickly sweet.

I have to say these were just OK. They did smell great as they were cooking, and looked beautuful when they came out of the oven (I had dusted them with red and green sprinkles) They were a little bland though.

These cookies are awesome!!!  A great hit with my family and friends!!!  It's best to use only 1/2 tsp of the nutmeg.  Also I put my batter in the refrigerator for a while to let the dough harden up, otherwise it's a gooey mess.  But once it's firmer due to the refrigerator, it's very easy to roll them into small balls.  Great recipe!

Rave reviews--especially my 5 year old who loves eggnog.  I took advice of others and cut nutmeg to 1/2 tsp.  Used a small cookie scoop to make 1" balls and baked 20 min.  They came out perfectly!!!  Can't imagine how small you need to make these cookies to get 6 doz---I only got 4 doz.   Definitely a keeper!

What a great cookie!  I made these cookies for my husbands office, my kids teachers and of course, a few for us to nibble on.  They were VERY easy to make and have a wonderful light eggnog taste.  Even people that said that they don't like eggnog enjoyed these cookies.

These cookies are great! I made just a few changes (by accident) that makes them even better.  I used 1 cup (2 sticks) of butter and 3/4 cup of eggnog.  I also made a powdered sugar icing drizzle with a sprinkle of nutmeg and cinnamon.  Getting lots and lots of compliments on it!

I love eggnog but thought these cookies were just okay. I wouldn't make them again. The nutmeg was a little strong for me. I even tried sprinkling with cinnamon instead but the nutmeg taste was still too much.

Added my own touch to this recipe. Increased the eggnog to 3/4 cup, and the cinnamon to 1 teas. as we are not fans of nutmeg but love eggnog also lightly sprinkled the top with cinnamon, they are great.

Awesome tasting cookies! I'd say definitely reduce the time and keep an eye on them, unless you make them larger (which I did).   Instead of 1 tsp of vanilla, I did 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp rum extract. These cookies are easily adjustable to your own tastes. Use less/more nutmeg, less/more eggnog (might have to add more flour in that case), less/more extract. :D

I made this recipe with soynog instead of eggnog and it came out fine. The batter was very lumpy before the dry ingredients went in, but then it was just fine. The cookies came out with a scone-like consistency, but were quite tasty. The nutmeggy flavor was great!

I made these exactly as the recipe stated except I used Sugar Cookie Flavored Egg Nog.  Next time, I would skip sprinkling the cookies with additional nutmeg.  The spice in the cookie without it is just right.  Mine turned out crispy with chewy center.

I agree with some of the other reviewers, not the prettiest cookie.. but who cares, they taste amazing! I made several dozen as part of a holiday cookie collection for friends and family and these were a huge hit. I will make them every holiday season from now on.

These cookies taste exactly like eggnog! I added a dash of ginger when I made them. I really think the sprinkling of nutmeg over the cookies really add to the taste. I have gotten a lot of compliments from them.

I make these every year for Christmas and my family can't get enough.  I have to ship them around the world because they love them so much.  I also put a little more eggnog to make them better.

This cookies were really good! I did some of the recommended alterations like, half white sugar and half brown sugar, and 3/4 cup of eggnog. But I also used 1 teaspoon of Allspice(instead of nutmeg), and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon. They have a nice flavor, and it isn't overpowering!

I used a very rich eggnog in the recipe so I thought that would add extra flavor...still very very mild cookie.  The eggnog icing helped make it a little more flavorful.  My son who does not like  rich sweet things enjoyed them, however....

I made these last night and they turned out beautifully! Followed another reviewers advice and substituted 1/2 the white sugar for brown.  They stayed very moist.  Sprinkled the tops with powdered sugar. Very pretty!  So easy to make, especially for a novice baker like myself.  My husband (who doesn't like eggnog) loved them as did my two year old!

too bland and boring.  if you don't tell people what the cookie is they would be hard pressed to know it is eggnog - just a cookie w/ some spice but definitely not enough.

We very much enjoyed these cookies.  Followed the recipe exactly as written - I was a little worried, the dough seemed "sticky" but the cookies themselves were wonderful and the last few were still good 48 hours after baking.  Thumbs up from my family!  Will definitely be making again.

Awesome cookies. I have had so many people ask for the recipe. I would definitly cut the nutmeg in half and up the eggnog to 3/4 cup. The first batch I rolled into balls, and it was a very messy process, so for the second batch I used a pastry bag to make the cookies. The cookies were so much prettier and much easier to handle. Also, make sure to use parchment paper for easier removal from the pan. Will definitly be a yearly thing!

These were good but I made some changes. I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar. I increased the eggnog to 3/4 cup and reduced the cooking time to 18 min. They came out nice and soft in the middle. next time I will reduce the amount of nutmeg(it is very stong tasting) They weren't bad for the first time making them.

I didn't care for these at all. I sprinkled powdered sugar and nutmeg on the top as suggested by another reviewer but they were still too bland and the flavor that they did have was unappealing to me.

The cookies dont taste as good as the cookie dough! I tried making icing from egg nog and powdered sugar. I tried rolling them in sugar. They were just okay. I had to up the temp to 350 because they just werent cooking and were very very flat after coming out of the oven. But I'd eat the cookie dough anytime!

These smelled great baking and were good.  Next time I will cut the nutmeg in half though, very stong.  I also think I'll take some other reviewer's advice and use more eggnog.  Thanks!

I have to preface this review with admitting I'm not a big eggnog fan...having said that, I liked these okay. They had a strange kick to them that kind of bothered me, but overall were pretty good. Not my favorite, but worth the effort.

They were good.  The texture reminded me of a (soft) sugar cookie.  The taste was more of a nutmeg cookie. I really could not detect the eggnog, I think the nutmeg over powers it.

These cookies have become a tradition for the Holidays!   And this from someone who did not like Eggnog!  Love them!!   I do substitute the Egg yolks with egg beaters! (1/4 cup for 2 egg yolks).

I love this recipe. If you enjoy eggnog and nutmeg these are for you. If you don't like the spiciness of nutmeg you may want to pass. These seem to be 'love them' or 'hate them' cookies. I've not yet met anyone on the fence with them.

I didn't really like this recipe. The cookies did not bake up tasting like eggnog.  Although the rough dough, yes, of course I tasted it, tasted more "egg noggy".  I won't make this again.

Great flavor!  Did use 3/4 cup of eggnog as others suggested (and a bit more flour) and used a cinnamon spice blend to sprinkle on top.  Tried one topped with cinnamon sugar but cookies are already sweet enough so liked the spice blend better.

I make this recipe every year during the holidays, and everyone loves them!  A couple things that I have found enhance the cookies: put them in the oven for 15 minutes to make them soft and chewy. And if you have no nutmeg, then add cardamom instead! It works equally as well and brings out the flavour of the eggnog nicely!

These cookies were a big hit with my family I did make a small change another reviewer suggested and used 3/4 of a cup of eggnog instead of 1/2 a cup. I also didn't sprinkle any nutmeg on top of the cookies I think they had enough spice as is.

Made the same changes as other reviewers. 3/4 Brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 cup eggnog, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp rum extract. Mine took 15 minutes at 300 degrees. LEAVE ON COOKIESHEET a few minutes before transferring to wire rack. Used medium scooper. Came out great! Going to frost mine.

Made this cookie a few times prior.  I don't use all butter instead I use one stick of butter and half a stick of margarine preferably Imperial.  I did add maybe a tablespoon of brandy into the mix.  I'm pretty sure the alcohol is burned off during baking.  One recipe makes a lot of cookies.

Easy recipe.  Tasty cookie.  It really tastes exactly like egg nog!  Used Deans egg nog for the recipe and since I ran out of vanilla, I used a hazelnut liquor instead.  Bringing them to a cookie exchange tonight!

It's a good recipe!! I followed the  recipe with some tweaking. I added 1 1/2 cup of eggnog instead of what the recipe states, and I added 2 dashes of nutmeg to the eggnog. Make sure that I didn't overmix it! The result was yummy fluffy cookies!! Good for edible Christmas gift.

The eggnog flavor came through! Delicious! The only problem is that its appearance is dull, so I use Christmas sprinkles on top to appeal to the eye. Otherwise, great cookie recipe!

I made these cookies tonight and I have no idea what must have gone wrong. They taste okay but they sure don't expand... They're super tiny cookies! :( Was hoping to make them for a cookie exchange at work next week but I think I am going to have to make something else instead...

I found these to have very little taste, particulary that of eggnog.  However, they have a pleasant soft texture and are not too sweet.

Very good cookies. I did as other reviews did and increased the eggnog and flour. Rolled them in yellow and blue sugar. Nice eggnog flavor. Thanks!
Update: After making this for several years, I've tweaked this to enhance the eggnog flavor. I leave the spices as is, use 1/2 tsp salt, as I bake with unsalted butter, and combine not quite 3/4 cup egg nog and some Malibu rum to make the total liquid a hair over 3/4 cup. I increase the flour to 2 2/3 cup and chill overnight. Roll in colored sugar and bake as directed. This is a great recipe as is, but the modifications really bring out the eggnog flavor. Thanks for sharing it!!

I made some recommended changes, and I don't feel they affected the overall idea of this recipe. I LOVE eggnog, and eggnog milkshakes, but cookies?  Nope, I chilled the dough to make it more manageable, but still just did them as drop cookies. They spread but weren't ugly per se. I added the extra half cup of eggnog and equal extra flour, and did half and half on the sugar with brown sugar. I kept the spices the same, and even sprinkled the extra nutmeg on top and they still weren't spiced enough for me. Oh well, it was fun to try!

Substituted molasses for 1/4c. of the sugar, and doubled the cinnamon--- they were great! They smelled amazing and the molasses kept them soft and awesome. Definitely will be making this again!

These cookies will sadly not win any beauty pageants.  Mine turned out lumpy and bumpy after trying to manhandle the sticky dough into a passable shape, and I can see that the suggestion to use a cookie press or pastry bag would have resulted in a prettier product.  That being said, the taste and texture is very nice, which was a happy surprise.  I don't think these cookies will "wow" anyone or be highly sought after on a cookie plate, but they are a tasty addition.

I took the advice to substitute brown sugar for a little more than half of the white sugar.  This made them nice and soft, just a bit chewy.  I really like these cookies, and am hoping that the rest of the family does also.

Perfect cookies! I subbed brown sugar for white as someone has noted. It did take the full 20 min at 300 to bake. So soft and very tasty (not bland)! These cookies are so easy. Great way to use up the end of the eggnog. They will be a regular during the holidays with our family.

So, I loved it.  I increased the eggnog to 3/4 cup and added a touch more flour to compensate.  They are VERY sticky going into the oven but come out fabulous. They do look opaque after cooking so I recommend the nutmeg and/or frosting for color. Very moist & a winner!

Left a lot to be desired. Even with modification (3/4 cup of eggnog and slightly less spices), these cookies aren't necessarily worth the time investment. They're a bit boring, and perhaps a little dry, but not completely disappointing.

I would highly suggest making a simple eggnog icing to make them sweeter/bring out the flavor.

I will never make these again.  They were terribly bland even with adding extra spices as a few readers suggested.  They also fell apart pretty easily.

Not a great recipe!  The house did smell good though after baking these.  I think there should be more egg nog in them.  I found them bland!

These were OK, I liked them because they weren't too sweet...others thought they were bland and didn't have much taste though.  I couldn't tell it was egg nog, just tasted like a nice, mild spice cookie.

Great Cookie! I am not an eggnog lover, but I love this cookie. Very Easy to make, however add about 3/4 cup eggnog and you really need to grease cookie sheet or the bottom don't look very pretty. Decoration would also help since they are a little lackluster. Overall a great cookie and goes well with coffee too!

Simple to make.  I cut the nutmeg and cinnamon in half.  I also rolled cookies in powdered sugar once cooled.  They look very plain without some type of decoration.  Everyone who tried these absolutely loved them.  I'll be making these every christmas!

I probably will not make these again.  The dough definitely needed to be chilled before making the cookies.  After they were baked, they were very unappealing-looking.  I made a simple frosting of powdered sugar and eggnog, then sprinkled the cookies with red and green sugar; they at least looked better.  My husband liked them, though.

Nice change from Chocolate chip or oatmeal cookies.  I used 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon.  Also, I sprinkled red and green sugar and other decorative sprinkles on top to make it look more festive.  Everyone seemed to love them.  And my 2 yr. old likes the taste too! =)

These are great cookies, very chewy and light. Everyone who sampled these loved them. They are especially good right out of the oven, but if you don't overcook them, they are still soft and chewy the next day. I had to grind up fresh cinnamon sticks because I was out of cinnamon, and I also added a capful of rum extract. They don't make six dozen though, going by what most people consider a cookie (2 inches diameter). My batch made 2 dozen. My compliments to the chef, this recipe is a keeper.

These were great cookies.  My husband, at first, thought they were so simple looking, they couldn't possibly be good...he said they were awesome and couldn't get enough.  To make them more attractive, I added 1/4 of a maraschino cherry before baking and icing sugar at the end.  They taste like a mixture between sugar cookies and shortbread.  I'm using them for a cookie exchange that I'm hosting this weekend!  We'll see how they fare with 10 other people there!

We enjoyed these cookies - it is a nice change.  I found that by using a decorating bag, the cookies looked much better.  My 3 & 5 year old children really like these cookies but they also like egg nog to drink.  Thanks!

There was nothing special about these cookies. They're good, but not all that attractive for the holidays, and I really didn't taste the eggnog, only the nutmeg. Good warm out of the oven, but not as good once they're hardened.

A novel idea, but nothing too special.  Watch them carefully, or they can become too crispy.  I added a little rum flavoring, I think that gave them more flavor.
