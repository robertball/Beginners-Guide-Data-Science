We've made this for years.  Always cooked the kielbasa first so I could drain the grease, blot the pan w/paper towels to get rid of the grease but keep the brown bits.  I use red cabbage - they say it tastes better.  We like our cabbage crunchy so we fry it no more than 20 min.  If we have them, we add a chopped apple to the cabbage, then add kielbasa & bacon to warm.  Fantastic quick meal.  Stars are for as written.

You can make it your own by draining the grease after cooking the Sausage first, but I think the grease adds flavor to the dish. Thank you guys for voting and for your reviews. I would add a photo, if I could but it won't allow my photo for some reason.

This is a simple, humble meal that is a “must eat” if you love fried cabbage and kielbasa as much as I do.  Serving the two together is a bonus!  I like this recipe because it‘s pretty bare bones, which is generally my preference with cooking and with seasoning.  If you’re working with good ingredients they don’t require a lot of camouflage.  At the submitter’s suggestion, I did “build” on this to “make it my own.”  First, I used our Milwaukee’s Usinger’s fresh Polska Kielbasa, the very best. (As opposed to fully cooked smoked kielbasa which is also very good! I usually like a mix of both, truth be told) I cooked and browned it in advance, refrigerating it until I was ready to put the dish together.  I did add minced garlic along with the onion.  When cooking the cabbage I helped it along with a little water and covered it for a bit.  With the cabbage cooked and the fresh kielbasa cooked, ready and waiting, all I did was combine the two and heat it through, the one hour simmering time, in  my view, not only unnecessary but quite possibly even counterproductive.  Tiny boiled red potatoes with butter and parsley rounded the meal out nicely.

I make this about once a month.  I will add sauerkraut once in a while for an extra flavor. I don't usually make it with the bacon.  I fry the kielbasa with the onion,  add the cabbage and a pat of butter.  I have never had to drain anything.  I put this over mashed potatoes.  It is a comfort food of mine.

Made this today. Only change was I added 2 finely grated carrots because we like carrots in sauerkraut so I wanted to see how it went with this recipe. 100% hit with the entire family. For the person who had to much liquid...just reduce it...flavor is enhanced

I was looking for a recipe to use up a head of cabbage and this recipe worked since I also had kielbasa on hand.  My husband loved it...he even asked if I could make it again next week!  We simmered less than an hour; when we checked it at 45 minutes, the cabbage was cooked perfectly for our tastes.

This was actually really delicious, I didn't think my husband would eat it (he hates cooked cabbage) but he even went back for seconds!  The only thing I did different was added some brown mustard near the end because I thought the flavor was lacking with just salt and pepper.  Tasted amazing!

This is the second time I made this dish, which I first tried after acquiring a big ring of kielbasa and not knowing what to do with it. I do love cabbage and sauerkraut, and it was hard to decide between several recipes, but I chose this one for its simplicity, and decided to see if I wanted to change it at all.  This time I added a half a cup of red wine per the advice of another reviewer of a similar recipe, which I liked very much. It's good to note that a good dollop of Polish mustard on the side is delightful with this!

We love this recipe. The only changes I make, is to add fresh basil, Worcestershire sauce, a little water and Wurze (a German condiment sauce I picked up in Berlin per a recommendation from our Italian bus driver Enzo and a second from our German tour guide Roland.) I can't vouch for it by the exact directions, it just seemed to need more juice when cooking for an hour.

My fiancee` and I loved this! I did make a few changes - instead of using bacon, I just used pork sausage links. I sautéed the cabbage in the sausage drippings once the pork sausage was done. I also added garlic seasoning and diced tomatoes. It didn't take as long to prepare since I cut out the bacon.??

I am sorry. I followed the recipe exactly. The result was that the mixture was steamed
and produced a lot of liquid which made the bacon soggy.The results for me was not so much fried, but more like moist and soupy. Thank you 
for the recipe to try.

Our family love Kielbasa and we also loved cabbage so I thought this would be a great meal.  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except i only used a little of the bacon grease (per other reviews)    it turned out OK but probably not something I will make again.

I've been making cabbage and Kielbasa for a long time. I'll use coleslaw mix to save time and the mess. Bacon and onions are in the mix as described. The only difference is that instead of frying, I'll bake it in a roasting pan @350°. Precook kielbasa let cool, slice thin and layer cabbage, kielbasa onions and season with zesty Italian dressing. Cover with foil and bake for about an hour. You don't need to precook cabbage. I usually make it using 5 pounds of cabbage and Kielbasa for a large crowd and it freezes well.

Added a clove of garlic which I cooked with the onions.  I also added some small potatoes that I microwaved first and then cooked in the bacon fat  thus making it a one pot meal. Otherwise followed the recipe.  There was nothing leftover.

This recipe is better than I thought it would be.  I had Kielbasa and didn't know what to do with it.  I added some Italian turkey sausage, 2 apples (peeled & sliced), 1/2 cup apple cider & a dash of ground mustard.  I only simmered 15 mins as I don't like mushy cabbage.  It was great!  My husband even liked it and he's not a cabbage fan.

This recipe popped up after I inventoried my frig and freezer and then plugged cabbage and kielbasa into the ingredient search.  I cut the recipe in half but used the full amount of bacon. I also knew it could have a tendency to be greasy because of using the bacon grease, so I did not use the full amount. I just added a little, enough to sauté  the onions and cabbage. I cooked this only until the cabbage was wilted to my liking. I didn't want to cook it another hour, so I didn't. This dish made my husband a very happy man tonight.

I make mine similar to this recipe, I haven't used bacon before...but I think I might next time!  I slice a green pepper or 2 along with the onion and boil about half a bag of egg noodles.  When everything is done, drain the noodles andq toss in with the cabbage and sausage. My grandma made this often & called it "haluski".

My grandma could always do amazing things with cabbage and bacon, and I was looking for something that sounded familiar to her cooking. This was so close! The only thing I added was a dash of garlic at the end.

I made it once as written and thought it was pretty rich and kinda greasy.  The second time I just fried it with whatever grease came from frying the kielbasa, then added real bacon bits.  Cooked it down then tossed it with boiled, drained  pierogis with sour cream on the side.   Make my baba proud.

Quite bland following the original recipe.  We added spicy mustard the second time we made it which was rather good.  Does not reheat well, does not keep for more than one day.

Very good. Couldn't find actual Kielbasa so I got some farmer's sausage that the butcher assured me was "very similar". I hope not because it found it rather plain. I'd definitely make it again with stronger seasoned sausage. Not sure I'd cook it in the grease again though.
