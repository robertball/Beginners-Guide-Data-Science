Really, really tasty! Super healthy too!  The only changes I made was I used a whole avocado instead of half and added a little salt and pepper.  Perfect!

This is not bad rec but need some improvement. Basil leaves tasted bitter to me so next time I will use cilantro. I cut about 1/2 can black olives and added them to the salad as well as pepperoni. It also need at least some salt and pepper. For kick would be great jalapenos.
