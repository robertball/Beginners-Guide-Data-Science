This is a wonderful and unique recipe. It is a little high in fat for our taste so I modified the recipe and it is better than ever.  Reduce the olive oil to 1 to 3 tbsps.  Use a "no stick" spray for both the almonds and the chicken when browning.  Omit the butter altogether and increase the cornstarch to a tbsp and the marmelade to 4 tbsp.  Delicious AND Healthy!!!

This was very good. It made about 1 1/2 c sauce that went great mixed in rice. The lemon was not strong(marinated for 1 hour). I thought the amount of almonds(1 cup) must be a misprint.? I toasted them, but only used 1/4 c. which was plenty for our tastes. Seems like I dirtied more dishes (measuring cups,spoons, pan etc.) than neccesary,too. I will try to re-use things,next time. Next time, I will use some of the juiced lemons ZEST also, a little white wine, some low-sodium boullion , AND LESS OIL. It was very oily and I don't think it was necesary to use that much. I cut the chicken breasts into strips instead of leaving them whole. It was much FASTER cooking that way and the marinade flavor was almost all through the chicken better. With changes, this might be a 5 star!

I thought this dish was very delicious...I've made several lemon chicken recipes before, but never one with orange marmalade and red pepper, which really made everything tastier.  I used less olive oil than called for (probably just 2 tablespoons), and skipped the butter altogher.  Serve with steamed broccoli and brown or wild rice for a delicious, balanced meal!

Incredible flavor! Skipped the corn starch and butter because it's unnecessary. Also used half of the oil and didn't miss it. Doubled the marmalade. One word of caution: when adding the chicken to the skillet at the end, be sure to turn the temp down to medium or medium low and cover to avoid burning and to let the flavor simmer into the meat. YUM!

I loved this recipe. My variation was to cut the chicken into strips and serve it over jasmine rice and green onion as the garnish. Simply delicious.

VERY good! I didn't have marmalade so I used orange juice. I will definitely make this again.

This is quite possibly the most enjoyable way I have ever eaten chicken. This recipe is SO GOOD! And it's not difficult!  I could NOT stop raving about it with each bite.  I followed the recipe to a T, but I like the low fat suggestions given in one of the other reviews...I am definitely going to be making this dish a regular part of my recipe repertoire...lemony, spicy, tangy - the best flavors really come together in this meal. We had it with couscous on the side which paired very well.

Overall, I liked this recipe.  If I made it again, I would pound the chicken breasts flat first.  I might also try leaving out some of the ingredients.  One thing I liked about this recipe is that the ingredients are usually one that you have on hand.

This recipe was great!  My husband even said this could be served in a five star restaurant.  I even ate the leftovers for breakfast this morning.  It makes a lovely presentation.  We have three lemon trees so you can be sure this dish will be served often.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Full-bodied and flavorful. I love lemon but I found this a little overpowering; next time I'd cut the lemon a bit. To make this healthier, cut the oil to 2 T. - one in the marinade, and one for the searing, and cut the butter entirely. You can cut the almonds in half by toasting them - the increased flavor from the roasting will make up for the missing quantity.

Absolutely wonderful!  My mom used to make this recipe (which she got from the Chicago Tribune) and I loved it back then.  I change absolutely nothing except that sometimes, depending on how big the chicken breasts are, I might only add 4.  The red pepper flakes add a nice little kick to it.  And a tip, the sauce tastes even better the second day, even cold.

The only thing I changed was to use only 4 T. olive oil in the sauce, and toast the almonds in the oven with no oil.  Excellent dish!

This was a great recipe with lots of flavor. I used thighs instead of breasts (because that's what I had already thawed out) and doubled the amount of marmalade for a little sweeter flavor. Worked great. My husband LOVED it. I will have to try this again soon!

This was incredible!! The sauce was so good I could've eaten it without the chicken. I used boneless  chicken breasts instead and just kept them covered while I made the sauce.  At first the sauce didn't seem to be getting thicker so I just added another tsp of cornstarch and mixed it with the sauce. Very tasty and easy :)

We loved this recipe, I used ground mustard instead of dijon and also changed the orange marmalade for agave nectar.

I made this for about 30 people. I didn't follow the recipe exact, but I used the basic concept by combining ingredients and baking the chicken. This was faster and it turned out delicious. Everyone loved it!

Very good! I only had time to marinate the chicken for about 10 minutes, but because the sauce was so flavorful, it turned out great. I substituted chicken broth for all the olive oil in the marinade and used the pre-sliced, flavored almonds that I usually use on salads.

This is a very delicious way to prepare chicken. I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the oil way back, added white wine to the marinade and allowed the chicken to marinade for more than the hour suggested. For the almonds, I just sprinkled a little bit of chopped almonds on top of the chicken then baked the chicken in a 350 degree oven until cooked. I skipped adding orange marmalade because I didn't have any. Chicken turned out very juicy and tender. Will definitely make again.

This was good, but not amazing enough to warrant all the work, at least not for regular meals. By the way, you can replace cornstarch with xantham gum (lower in carbs, higher in fiber) but don't stir it into water. Just add it directly to the sauce very slowly, stiring it in immediately. Thickens just as well and is healthier.

WOW! Delicious! If I could rate this higher than five stars, I would. My family prefers dark meat to light, so I substituted thighs for the breasts. As the sauce cooked, I scraped the bottom of the pan to add all that browned chicken goodness into the mix. Since some reviewers questioned the amount of almonds, I added a bit at a time. In the end, I dumped in the full amount and didn't regret it. Served over a wild rice/brown rice blend, garnished with a lemon slice and sprig of parsley, this dinner looked elegant, and was absolutely scrumptious! Just enough red pepper zing to please those that enjoy spicy dishes (like my husband and son), but not enough to turn off someone with a more wimpy palate (me).

We've made this recipe a number of times and never have bad results. The chicken comes out so flavorful, and the sauce created is wonderful. Even though it looks like a lot of effort, the ingredients come together easily & taste like you slaved for hours!

This was not worth the effort in my opinion.  The sauce wasn't anything to write home about and the almonds weren't very exciting either.  The chicken itself tasted pretty good, but the rest was average. The only difference between what I did and the recipe was that I had to use a horseradish brown mustard because it is what I had and I left off the lemon slices because I didn't feeling like buying a whole lemon for a couple slices.

I left out all the oil and butter turned this into a stir fry. I added snow peas and water chestnuts to this as well as some diced onions.  I did need more constarch and next time it could use more red pepper IMHO

This was excellent!  Great flavor, and a really nice balance of tangy lemon to the dijon mustard.  Did have to add another tsp of cornstarch to thicken it more, but I think that was just my preference.

I had one hour to get this prepared for a party of 8. This dish is quite tasty & would have given it 5 stars had it been not quite so messy to prepare.  Grease splatters & I don't get along.

My family and I loved this dish. I wish I had made more sauce though, it had a great taste. It was like others said messy with the frying, I have spots of oil everywhere on my oven. DEFINITELY reduce the almonds, I used half a cup and I still thought that was a lil much. I didn't have red flakes so I just added paprika. **Mistake I made: The recipe didn't call for any salt so I immediately assumed it needed it, so my "salt shaker loving self" added salt. Big mistake, you could taste the salt, it would have been just fine w/out it.

Fabulous, easy recipe...very hard to goof up.  Kids love the sweet/tart taste and adults think you slaved all day.  Added more to the marinade to make more of the sauce.  Excellent!!

I had been wanting to try this recipe for so long and finally got around to it last night. The family enjoyed it, however, there was so much mess and it took so long to prepare. I feel like that part should be rated a 1 or 2. Left out the cornstarch and just allowed the sauce to reduce.  Toasted my slivered almonds in the microwave for one minute and cut the breasts into smaller pieces. Next time, I think I would just cut them up to begin with. Served with brown rice and a creamy California Chardonnay (Meridian) that matched great.

I would have preferred boneless thighs, which would have produced a moister dish.  One cup of sliced almonds were a bit much.  I'd cut the amount in half next time.  The resultant sauce is delicious, especially served over rice.

Great recipe. I made a couple changes, I reduced the olive oil and the chicken broth. Since I was only cooking for myself I didn't need quite as much sauce. I also skipped the cornstarch, the sauce was thick enough for my liking without it. 

When it comes to toasting nuts I never use oil. I toasted silvered almonds dry on a nonstick pan, this method has always worked great for me. 

I also made some minor tweaks to method; after browning the chicken I used the chicken broth to deglaze the pan then added the marinade instead of the other way around which worked really well. I cooked that down for a few minutes then added kumquat marmalade instead of orange since that's what I had in the pantry. Next time I'll use a little less, it was a tad sweeter than I expected. My final change was adding the toasted almonds in with the parsley and red pepper flakes so they would flavor the sauce. 

This will definitely be added to my rotation, a unique chicken dish using things already in my pantry!

A very delightful and flavourful dish! I was surprised at how tasty this turned out! I halved the recipe using 8 chicken tenderloins instead, used tapioca starch and omitted the butter (didn't need it). great recipe. will be making this often.

The chicken breasts got dried out, even after simmering in the sauce on low for only 10 minutes.  That, plus the fact that I had to double the sauce ingredients to get enough to make it worthwhile, is what prompts me to give this a mediocre rating.

Excellent tasting sauce.  I followed some of the other suggestions and doubled the sauce, used no stick spray instead of all of the oil, and pounded the breasts thin.  Awesome!

Thought this was a tasty and different recipe compared to my family's usual fare, which is pretty spicy. The lemony sauce complements green beans and asparagus, too.

This was totally different than I expected. It had a great citrus flavor  combined with a spice. It reminded me of something that I would get at PF Changs restaurant. I served it with  steamed rice and my family loved it.

Okay, will try again.  Chicken was dry, but not the fault of the recipe.  To our tastes, it was too lemony and had too many almonds.  Next time I will use less lemon juice and more orange marmelade to make the sauce a little sweeter.  I think 1/2 cup of almonds would have been plenty.  The sauce spatters EVERYWHERE and I had to keep it covered and turned down to medium.

I used this recipe as a jumping off point and estimated the ingredient amounts and it still came out great - didn't have chicken broth, beef seemed to work just fine. I used peach jam like another reader, nixed the parsley, went with honey mustard and used an entire giant fresh lemon. It tasted great over couscous. I will play with this one again. :)

This recipe was very good. I didn't think it was hard at all. I also did not add almonds because my hubby dosen't like them and I used dijon dressing instead of the mustard. I cut down on the oil and added 4 cloves of garlic.My hubby loved the dish.

My husband loved this dish.  I used Peach Jam instead of Orange Marmalade (just a personal preference) and used less oil as other suggested, and it turned out fabulous.  It goes great with rice! (The prep is a little time consuming, but I think it's totally worth it.)

This recipe was not as sweet as I expected.  The mustard overpowered the lemon and marmalade.  Still, my family enjoyed it.  I only enjoyed it after I put soy sauce in it and ate it over fried rice.  Would probably not make again due to difficulty of recipe and only so so flavor.

I thought this was fabulous. My husband thought it was very good but didn't like it as much as me. I dry roasted the almonds to cut back on the oil content. Also didn't marinate the chicken, just grilled it and made the sauce. Yum!

We had mixed opinions in my family.  Those who love nuts enjoyed it, those (the younger children) who did not like nuts weren't thrilled with it.  I really liked it.  When making the sauce, I thought it was an unappetizing color so I added about 1/4 cup of cream.  It didn't seem to change the taste.  Just the appearence.  Next time I would add a little more cornstarch, mine was a bit thin.

This had a really nice combination of flavours, I didn't use the chili flakes because I don't like spicy foods.  It was tangy, I think I'll add a little more garlic next time.

I thought I had lemon juice when I started this recipe, but it turned out I didn't, so I used orange juice instead.  I put in a little lemon extract, some lemon zest and some white wine and it was fantastic.

I think it's the first time I've made my husband drool.

This was great!  The only thing I may change is the amount of oil used in it.  I would decrease it by about 2 tablespoons.  The family loved it.  Also, if you are not a nut lover, I would cut the amount of almonds used in the recipe.

This was excellent!  It cooked up easy in my electric skillet (trying to beat the heat of summer!) and my kids enjoyed it.  I could have used a few less almonds, but that's just personal prefrence.  I will be making this again.

Excellent dish.  My family loved the
great lemony flavor.  Even my 4 year
old son enjoyed it.  I served it over
white rice and didn't have anything 
left over!!

I totally loved this recipient. fort time I made as Is, a little high on the fat. changes I worked for second recipe:1 lowered the fat  by using 1/2  amount of EVOO in the marinade. did not add butter in final phase. made a stir fry with this recipe using broccoli, onion red pepper, and dried cranberries. It all works well with the sauce. and just top with rice for a full meal. with fat lowered it is really a healthy meal.

Pumped up the red pepper a bit and used a bit of good cab to tone down the sweet a bit. Big hit with the family.

it took much longer than expected. the flavor was pretty good. there was plenty of lemon taste, though overpowered by red pepper flakes. I liked the marmalade. The marinade was great. there were way too many dishes, and I might bake the chicken next time while the sauce (that takes forever to thicken) cooks.

This is a long-standing family favorite.  I use apricot preserves instead of marmalade, and make the sauce a little thicker so it will stick to pasta. I also toast the almonds in my toaster oven with no oil, they come out less greasy.

WOW!!!! Now I am a traditional Italian who normally sticks to Italian food and sauces but I gotta tell ya, this was awesome!!! I said "what the heck, let me follow this to the "T", and it came out great. Great recipe. I didn't change a thing. Who woulda thought I would like almonds in my dinner. I loved the mustard taste and the spicey red pepper zing this had. I will be sharing this one. Thanks!!

I lost count of how many times my husband raved "This is really, really good!" I used about half the oil and butter as suggested by others. I also didn't have any parsley or marmalade on hand, but some homemade spiced peach jam seemed like a delicious substitution. Then end result was lemonier/tangier than I had expected, possibly because I used faux chicken breasts which really absorbs the marinade. Either way, we both thought it was delicious. I definitely plan to make this again!

Fixed this tonight for just me (LOVE the Allrecipes feature to change number of servings).  I really enjoyed this dish, the chicken was just right!  I didn't realize I forgot the mustard until I sat down to type this review, but the flavor was still great.  I used blanched slivered almonds, and they had a nice crunch to them.  I too cut back on the oil and butter by about half.  When marinating the chicken, I dumped all those ingreds into the foodsaver bag in which my single portion chicken breast had been frozen, squooshed it around, tossed back in fridge for an hour.  Assembled other ingredients, did a load of laundry, came back and cooked my meal.  I should have flattened that chicken breast some...instead, I added a touch of water to the sauce, cut the breast in half then butterfly'd each half, covered and let it cook just a moment or two longer, took off cover and reduced to just the right thickness of sauce.  added my very toasted almonds and fresh parsely,and butter, and...heaven on a plate.  Very little mess (just mind your heat settings).  Next time I make this, I'm sure it will be even better.  Will make this for the picky boyfriend, that's for sure...  Bon Apetite! (PS..After I took the chicken out of the bag, I had to add about 1/8 cup water or so to the bag and slosh it around, poured through sieve before adding to the pan to boil).  I'll double my sauce for next time...its really tasty with green beans on the served on the side.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and I don't know if I did something wrong but my family and I did not like this dish. I was really disappointed because it smelled heavenly while cooking. Maybe because I was expecting a sweet taste to the chicken, this was not sweet at all. I will not be making again. (sorry)

I would say this recipe was just ok.  I marinated the chicken overnight but followed all the other steps.  It was a little oily and it took quite awhile to make everything.  Too many steps for me for just an ok dish.

Was a little overwhelmed at first when seeing all of the ingredients and reading the reviews of how messy this was and time consuming, but I did not find it bad at all (not THAT messy or terribly time consuming).  I didn't change a thing.  Funny, I found it more enjoyable a couple of hours after I made it, rather than immediately after making it....kind of like the flavors had time to pull together.  I really give it 4 and 1/2 stars, but that's not an option.

Okay on flavor but was way too labor intensive for the flavor return.  I am no saucier and this sauce took forever stirring, hi heat, lo heat, hi heat, strain, etc...

I made this recipe for my Mom, a very accomplished cook! Liked the balance of the sweet and spicy flavors without being overwhelming. Definitely a recipe that I will make again.

This is really good.  I only gave it a four because of the time it took, it was a little messy with frying the chicken too but the end result was good my husband loved it. I added more lemon slices while the chicken was in the sauce...don't keep it on the burner too long the sauce gets really thick and it will stick to the pan.
Made it again and still love it very good

Maybe something went wrong.  I don't know.  I followed the recipe exactly and I feel that the dish was extremely bland.  It was really disappointing considering the house smelled so good while it was cooking.  Maybe a longer marinating time would have helped.

We just finished having this for dinner, and they chicken was wonderful!  I have to admit that it required more effort than I usually want to spend on a weeknight, but that was my fault for only reading the ingredients and not the cooking directions.  It just sounded so good that I didn't care at the time!  I will definitly make this again, but on a day when I have more time!  Thanks for sharing.

We loved this, but when I first saw that list of ingredients I almost panicked. It seemed like a lot. If it was or if it wasn't, I don't know. All I know is that it was WONDERFUL!

My husband and I loved it, but the crushed red pepper was a bit overpowering - I will omit it next time.

I tried this recipe last night and my husband and I loved it.  The only thing I would change is reducing the almonds to half a cup and cutting the oil in half.  I would probably increase the amount of red pepper flakes.  I served it with brown rice and the sauce went very nicely with the rice.  Definitely a repeat.

i ommitted the parsely since i forgot i didnt have it in my pantry.  i used margarine instead of butter, fresh lemon juice, and 2 tablespoons real dijon mustard with seeds and 1 tablespoon spicy brown mustard since thats all i had left.  The results were excellent, but it could have used a bit more orange marmelade.  very rich and very good presentation.

Love it always. Takes longer to boil down and don't  just triple the liquid, it is more than you need.  I prefer thighs.

This recipe could be tasty enough, but so many corrections need to be made that it wouldn’t remain the same dish.  Far far too much oil in this dish!  Completely unnecessary.  A whole cup of sliced almonds is an absurd amount, a few tablespoons would easily be enough.   For us, 2 cups of chicken broth pretty well ruined the flavor.  It was way too thin, and destroyed the wonderful Dijon / lemon flavor.

Thought that the amount of steps didn't produce anything special. The mustard was stronger in the marinade than the lemon.

This was very tasty and full of flavor! I thought maybe it would have plenty of sauce to put over noodles or rice but it didn't. Maybe just double it next time. Thanks for sharing.

Great taste and easy to make.  I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic and dried parsley and it turned out great anyway.

This is by far the best chicken recipe I've tried from All Recipes. As with the other reviewers, I added more lemon to the marinade as well as a touch more dijon along with a dash of salt and omitted roasting the almonds in fat (there's no need).  I used chicken tenders because I made this last minute on a weeknight and only had time to marinate it for 30 minutes which was plenty of time to incorporate the flavors.  I finished it with a squeeze of lemon after the heat was turned off to give it additional punch and it turned out so moist and tangy!

Tasty, but not lemony enough for us. Next time I'll use more lemon juice and lemon zest.
