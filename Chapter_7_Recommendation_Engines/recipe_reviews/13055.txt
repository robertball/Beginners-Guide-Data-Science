This is really good.  A little fresh finely chopped jalapeno or habenero pepper is a great addition and simmered with the other ingredients.  Also at the end a pinch of coriander and a dollop of sour cream as a garnish.  Vegetarians use your favorite tvp meat substitute for the ground beef I used Worthingtons Gran Burger 1 cup soaked in one cup warm water for 15 minutes in place of the ground beef.  It turned out really yummy.

EXCELLENT! I only used 1 lb beef, didn't drain the tomatoes, used northen beans, and added an additional cup of water. Excellent!! We loved it! It was still very thick but hey! That's a good stew! Loved the mild southwest flair and was filling and delicious. A dollop of sour cream and a little shredded cheddar cheese and viola! Its definately a recipe that I will make again! Thanks so much for this LaDonna!

This stew was good and easy, but note it serves more than 4 people - which may explain the nutritional information (72 g of fat per serving).

Very easy to prepare!  Use a slow cooker to let flavors abound!  I added a little cajun seasoning and a pinch of cayenne pepper!  Great when topped with the cheese and a spoonful of sour cream!

Loved this recipe! Made a few changes. I used 1 lb. of ground beef instead of 2 and added a can of black beans. I also used a whole jar of salsa instead of 1 cup (by accident). It turned out great! Will make this again and again!!!!

I have made this twice so far with a little twist each time.  I followed some other suggestions and cut down slightly on the amount of meat.  I used  2 cans Ro-tel instead of the tomatoes and salsa, taco seasoning in place of the cumin, and minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  The second time I made it, I completely omitted the potatoes and served it spooned over corn bread and topped with shredded cheese and a spoonful of sour cream.  My husband and parents all agree that this is a very good recipe.

WOW! This was excellent and very easy to prepare. After reading the suggestions of others I used 1 1/2 lb. hamburger, 2 t. minced garlic instead of the powder and added 1 can of Rotel tomatoes,1 can Great Northern beans and an extra 1/2 can of water. I will be making this soup again and again! Thanks so much for sharing with us!

This is a simple and flavorful stew.  My husband and I are totally in love with it!  The smell of it cooking all day is just divine.  So yummy!  Can't say enough good things about it.

This stew was so good.  I added more liquid to it though.  The family loved it.  It's a keeper as far as my family is concerned.

This recipe was really just ok.  I think it would be a good base to begin with but it's  little on the bland side.  Next time I'll try adding in some other veggies/ingredients.

I followed the directions to this recipe with the exception of using black beans.  This was a delicious stew.  The flavors worked well together especially after simmering in the crock pot all day.  I served this with the Absolute Mexican Cornbread from this website.  My husband LOVED it.

I improvised a little with this recipe, but it was wonderful. I left out potatos ( had none) but used extra corn, although I didn't have can corned, I used 4 ears of fresh corn instead. I love the flavor, I used a combination of black, white, and red peppers liberally as the medium salsa didn't make it spicy enough for my taste. I also added an extra cup of water and made it a soup, and topping it with cheddar made it creamy it was awesome! Next time I will definetly use potatos and follow the recipe exactly ( although I will still probably go a lil crazy with the pepper :)  ) So glad I found this recipe, oh and by the way, it freezes well too just thaw slowly not in a pot and the beans hold their shape :) Tanks LaDonna!

Really simple and tasty.  I used my crockpot and let it simmer away.  Next time I may add another can of different beans and fresh cilantro.  Even the little ones liked this one!

I added 1 can of Rotel, 1 can of white northern beans, a package of El Paso taco seasoning and substituted 1 clove of garlic for the garlic powder to this recipe in the crockpot and it turned out AMAZING!  This is definately a KEEPER! I also served with a spoonful of sour cream on top of the cheddar cheese.  Very tasty!!

I use half the beef, 2x's the beans (today I had black and kidney), double the corn (I use frozen) and don't use the potato. Always a hit and always even better the next day.

This was a hearty stew.  I used Bison meat and it tasted great.  I also put everything in a crock pot and let it simmer all day.  Quick and easy ... great recipe for those cold and chilly days!

5 stars for super simple, 4 stars for taste.  Very good.  I added an extra can of tomatoes, bc I love tomatoes.  I like green onions to garnish, my son likes crushed tortilla chips.  I highly suggest stirring in the sour cream.  Really adds flavor.  Didn't think spicy enough.  Next time I'll use hot salsa, or tomatoes with green chilies instead.  I added ground red pepper.  Overall, I love it and will make it again.  Simply, satisfiying and uses things you actually have in the house!

I have this same recipe just a little different. I add 1lb. of ground beef  1 1/2 c of onion and 1/2 c of celery and chop together in food processor. We add 1 can of rotel 2 can of pinto beans (drained) 1 can of corn 1 can of jalapeno black eyed peas with flavore slab bacon (it adds some spice and really good) 1 tsp of cumin 1/2 tsp garli powder and i add 1/2 a pakage of chili seasoning. This is a favorite in my family we eat at least 4 time a month and its really good left overs if you add water and heat it up and add the cheese and crakers.

We just finished having this for supper tonight.  Everyone really liked it.  I will definately make this again, although I did make a few changes.  Used 1.5 lbs of ground beef, 28oz can of tomatoes, 1 cup of frozen corn, cut back on the water to 1 cup, 2 cloves of garlic instead of the garlic powder, pinch of red pepper flakes, and about 3tsp of taco seasoning, although I think it should have only been 2.  I found it a little spicey but my kids both thought it was excellent.  I would also add 2 more potatoes because I love potatoes in stew.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Was really good the first day, but tasted pretty bad as leftovers the next day. Next time I'll use two cans diced tomatoes and hot instead of medium salsa.

I thought this was tasty.  I microwaved some at work for lunch & 3 people asked me what smelled so good.  Then in my lunch room, a stranger asked me what I was eating, that it smelled delicious.

I love this. I have made it 5 times but with some changes. I brown the meat and then put all of the ingredients except the broth in the slow cooker because it makes its own broth. I also add Adobo seasoning to taste instead of salt and garlic powder and a can of white hominy (pozole) instead of the corn.  I add some crushed red pepper because we like it really spicy. Then I cook it on low for 6 hours or high for 3-4 hours.  Good comfort food.

Delicious! I used 1lb ground beef, 2 cups salsa, only one cup of water, added a15 oz can of black beans and left out the potatoes. You really can't go wrong with variations of this zesty stew!

This recipe was a great starting point for some delicious stew.  We did not add the jarred salsa, instead I used roasted hatch green chilies (about 2 ounces by weight) and then gave it a little bit of smoky heat by adding a heavy 1/4 teaspoon of ground chipotle chili.  It was flavorful and our meat was very tender.

Not a bad soup at all! The cheese really sets it off. It wasnt the most amazing thing in the world but for the ingredients and effort it is def something ill make again.  I used the crock pot and let it simmer for a few hours. I only used 1 lb of ground beef and used two cans of beans. I used chicken broth instead of water to give it more flavor because I had no salsa on hand.  All in all this was a very good and extremely easy and hearty meal.  Put it in homemade bread bowls and it was great.

This looks really good, I haven't made it;I'm looking for a specific recipe. Does anybody have a pinto bean soup that has hamburger and elbow macaroni pasta in it?   

I've had it before, but can't find a recipe for it. I'm sure it is pretty intuitive but some ideas ahead of time would be appreciated.

It was fine - but certainly not worthy of the same ratings as other 5-star soups/stews on this site.  Disappointing, really.

This will feed my boyfriend and I for days. It has lots of flavor and is very hearty. Great recipe. We added a can of Rotel instead of plain diced tomatoes and added one chopped Hot Italian sausage instead of the second pound of ground beef. Thanks!

This was so good!  I doubled the recipe and the only I changed was using half beef and half turkey.  I put it in the crock pot early and it we ate off of it for two days.

This stew is fantastic. I have so many people asking for the recipe and they rave about how delish this dish is! I used Sargento's shredded taco cheese to add a kick. So good!

Tried this tonight and everyone loved it.  I changed it a bit, because we like spicier food.  I used a whole jar of Sam's Black bean and corn salsa, taco seasoning, rotel tomatoes, green chilies and lime, and added also 1 tbs lime juice and 1 tsp oregano.  I used a liberal dose of red pepper sauce as well.  I also tripled the amount of garlic (we REALLY like garlic).  We didn't like the cheese on top, it made the soup gooey and stringy.  All in all, I'll definately make it again.

This is a great fast dish. I took the advice of others and added a pack of taco seasoning, I also added some additional salsa and used red kidney beans instead (didn't have any other). Everyone loved it. Will definetly make this again.

Mmmm. I'm not a great cook-but I do like to try new things,this was easy to make. I did read reviews before I started and was able to use lots of the tips! I used the Ro-tel tomatoes(2 cans,10 oz.) and found that the taco seasoning gave it a heartier look and great taste, I didn't have garlic powder so substituted 2tsp minced garlic. I will soooo make this again! and again and again...(Children are 7,11 and 13 and they all had seconds)

I made few changes. Gound turkey in place of the beef, used rotel for picante sauce, and instead of cumin I put in a package of taco seasoning and package of ranch dressing mix.

Really loved this stew. I served it for a group and it was gone in 20 minutes! I served it with Cliantro and sour cream on the side and I added a couple jalapenos to the pot. Thanks for sharing such an easy and delicious recipie :)

This was delicious.  We added a can of Rotel and some chopped cilantro.  It's definitely going into our "make again" file.
