I first had this at a friends house and couldn't get enough of it!  It has become a staple in my rotation. Easy to prepare, tasty, a when served with a hearty bread, very filling.
I now make it with fat free evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream and it's still wonderful.

This is a great soup.  This is definitely a fall soup but don't let that stop you from having it year-round.

I made a few subs on the recipe (apple sauce, vegetable broth) but it turned out pretty good.  Tasted like it wanted a bit of something, however, so I'll have to experiment to decide what.
