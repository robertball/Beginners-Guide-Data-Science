This yields a lot of batter, so I opted to make some muffins in addition to a loaf.  For those not knowing how to achieve a cooked butternut squash, just cut in half lengthwise, brush the insides with olive oil and place the flesh side down on a foil lined cookie sheet.  Bake at 400 degrees for 30-45 min depending on the size until they are fork tender.  Then just scoop out the meat into a bowl and use a potato masher or hand mixer to puree. The texture is just right whether you make quick bread loaves or muffins. Not too dry or crumbly when you bite in.  The ratio of spices was perfect in my opinion. I ended up icing some which hubs enjoyed.  A nice alternative to canned pumpkin.

Even my kids loved these!  I replaced the shortening with 1/3 c. applesauce and 1/3 c. canola oil.  This recipe made 24 nice muffins so I did the first dozen without nuts and the second with 1/3 c. chopped walnuts.  They took 30 minutes in the oven at the same temperature.  Yum!

This is a perfect use of butternut squash from the garden.  I used twice the amount of cinnamon but half the amount of ground cloves because I thought the cloves would be too aggressive for our personal tastes.  It came out perfectly.  The flavor and texture are wonderful.

I only changed one (very mild) thing. I used dried cranberries instead of raisins because I find raisins to be... Yucky ;)      Also - highly recommend making FRENCH TOAST with this bread in the morning. It was the best idea my husband ever had.

Great recipe -- easy to make, and quite delicious! I substituted 2/3 cup shortening for 1 cup butter, and added twice as much cinnamon. It came out perfect.

Thanks!  This is one of the best quick bread recipes I've found on here.  The only change I made was to use splenda instead of sugar.  It rose well and cooked evenly on the inside and the outside.

Iused butter instead of shortening, and I replaced 1 cup of sugar with 3/4 cup of raw honey, adding about 1/4 tsp. of baking soda to complement that.  I used 1/3-1/2 as much cloves, as that's what I had, and added a couple of dashes of nutmeg.  Next time I'll probably spice it up more, as the flavor was quite mild, but still it's really yummy.  I don't doubt it would have been just as good without any changes.  Maybe it was just luck, but this bread came out as well as any quick bread I've ever made:  really moist, but totally cooked through even in the center and not too tough or crusty on the edges -- not too easy a feat for me!

A very nice recipe!  I like the fact that you get one loaf for now and one for the freezer to enjoy later.  Next time I will double the raisins and nuts as I felt they were a little skimpy in this recipe.

I used chopped pecans and omitted the raisins when I made the recipe.  It was a very creative way to use butternut squash.  Since it made two loaves, I kept one and gave one away.

Perfect consistency. I used 1/4 cup of butter instead of shortening for a single loaf. Another great recipe from allrecipes.com.

I think this is a very good base for the recipe.. but cannot give it 5 stars as I would make changes.  
First:  for information, I made 6 mini loaf pans, with about 1 1/2 cups batter in each, 350 degrees for 35 minutes ( convection) and they came out well. 

I do not have shortening so followed some of the other reviewers and used 1/3 cup applesauce and 1/3 cup canola oil. Doubled the cinnamon. Otherwise I followed the directions as written.  

I think the extra cinnamon is needed, as these were mild even with the change. I might even add some nutmeg next time.  But I also think they were a bit too sweet, so I would try 2 cups of sugar next time.  And also I will probably add some nuts, perhaps pecans. 

Also, I had 4 small squash, and they were just over 2 cups pureed... so perhaps 2 large ones?

I followed the recipe exactly with exception of leaving out cloves and adding a tsp. of ground Nutmeg.  It was moist and tender with a great taste and pleasing "spicy" smell.

First time making this and made it with a "twist", an experiment if you will. Earlier in the week I had made a Butternut Squash Bisque that included cooked squash, onions, celery, carrots, vegetable broth, half and half, garlic, and brown sugar and then pureed it all. I so had much left over I decided to see what this bread would taste like adding my Bisque, following the recipe for the bread (I cut the recipe in half, did not add the water and cut the cloves down) I did add the nuts and raisins. I had to add 20 mins. cooking time, I guess because of the Bisque. It was WONDERFUL and YUMMY! Who knew this would taste so good! Great experiment for using leftover Bisque and hubbie can't get enough of it!

Disappointed in this recipe's overpowering clove flavour, especially given the quantity.  Now I have a lot of clove-cake. Cloves pretty much annihilated any hint of butternut squash.   1 hour was too long with dark crust on bottom.  Cut cloves and possibly add nutmeg, cut sugar and 45-50 min. would be better - maybe.

Delicious!  I did decrease the sugar & water slightly.  (Adding water to bread seemed odd.)  This was really yummy!  It tastes even better the second day which rarely happens with bread!

This is so good.  I did cut the cloves in half because I couldn't imagine a full tsp of cloves in anything.  It is still very clove-y.  Thus, the 4 stars instead of 5.

My husband is a diabetic. I often have to make changes to recipes to replace sugar with Xylitol or monk fruit blend. In this recipe I made 3 minor changes. I used Xylitol in place of sugar and added 1/2 cup smashed bananas. If you are like me, you might want to decrease the Xylitol by 1/2 of a cup. This is because the banana adds a natural sweetness and so does the butternut squash. I also added MORE cinnamon! We LOVE cinnamon in my house and cinnamon brings forward a better spice taste. I added an additional 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Since my husband doesn't care for raisins and really shouldn't eat too m

First time I've used this squash in this manner. I usually microwave squash, but discovered an easy tip. Prick all over (like you do a potato) to keep it from exploding, line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, bake at 350 F for 1 hour or until done. Then slit it in half lengthwise, toss the seeds, take out the squash flesh. Much easier than trying to handle it raw. Easy recipe, very good, thanks for sharing!

Used butter not shortening and increased cinnamon and added pumpkin pie spice instead of cloves as they are not liked in my fam. Made 2 beautiful full loaves and 1 small .  Texture is fine, not gummy or coarse, very pleasant taste with nothing overwhelming. Nice change from banana bread.  I did include walnuts and cranberries which I liked even better than plain.  Will definitely make again!  Thank you for this excellent recipe.

Smells delicious!   Made 2 large loaves and 2 small loaves.  All 4 rose to the top of the pan!  
Used ideas from others comments.  I added 1 cup of quick oatmeal in place of 1 c flour.  No raisins in the cupboard, used craisins.  Used 1 C brown sugar, 1 C white sugar,and 1/2 C real maple syrup.  No cloves in the cupboard, used some nutmeg.

I made a half-recipe and it made one loaf  in a 9-1/4 x 5 1/4 loaf pan.  The only change I made was I substituted butter for shortening and omitted raisins, since no one in my family likes raisins.  I made it ahead and froze it for breakfast for Thanksgiving guests.  After defrosting, It was moist and delicious.  I may up some of the spices next time as they are subtle, but definitely there if you take the time to savor.

I made no changes other then making 1/2 the recipe. I did not add the optional mix ins. It came out delicious and I will make it again. I think next time I will make extra and freeze some because its so good. Note that this is "bread" in the same way banana bread is "bread." Its sweet and basically cake.

I used golden raisins and pecans as I don't like walnuts. It turned out wonderful.  One loaf almost gone within a few hours so made two more today. Next time I'm going to try it with dried cherries or cranberries.

I made this exactly from the recipe for a party and everyone loved it!  It turned out really moist and was a great way to use up some extra butternut squash from Thanksgiving.

easy to make, turned out great, I used a 9x13 pan, baking time was the same. only thing I would change is omit the clove or cut the amount of it in half! I ate a small piece 10 minutes and can still taste the clove in my mouth! but than again I am not a big fan of cloves, I should of gone with my gut when adding it. I felt like it was alot.

Changes I made: I switched one cup of the all-purpose flour for 1 cup of whole wheat flour, used one-third cup shortening and 1/3 cup canola oil, I added a peeled shredded Apple, 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, only one half teaspoon cloves, added one half teaspoon allspice, reduced sugar to 2 1/4  Cups, reduced salt to three-quarters of a teaspoon. Yes I made a lot of changes - most based on previous comments here and on another pumpkin bread on this site.

I made this because I had cooked a huge butternut squash from our CSA and had a bunch of it leftover.  I didn't have quite 2 full cups of it, so I threw in a chunk of baked sweet potato.   The only other thing I did differently was to add 1/2 tsp of allspice and 1/2 cup of applesauce (the squash was really dry...).  It was awesome!!  Smelled so good right out of the oven, it was torture to wait for it to cool enough to cut!!  Great recipe, will definitely make this again!

I thought the picture looked a little dry so I changed the recipe with some tricks from 30 years of making pumpkin bread. First I read an article about putting the Squash whole in the oven washed and pricked all over with a fork. Then during baking you use a knife to see if the meat is soft. Then take it out and cool so you can handle it. I did 4 at a time and found it was easier. After its cool just cut in half and clean out the seeds and peel or slice the skin off, cut the inside up and it mashed easily. I got 18 cups worth and freezer some. Now I doubled this recipe because this family loves this stuff. But my changes were that I did half brown sugar half white and to keep it most (since I have tons of apples anyway right now) I cored, peeled and shredded enough apples to make a cup per batch. So I had 2 cups of juicy red delicious apples that I added. I also make my own spice mix in a shaker jar with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and a smidgen of ginger. This I use for all my fall baking and applesauce. Well it got wonderful and I need to get a pic before its gone.

I baked squash in a little water (cut side down after removing seeds) to soften it and then used it on the recipe.  I made muffins, baking them at 350 for 30 min.  These are amazing. I did sprinkle the tops with brown sugar and cinnamon before baking.

I had butternut squash from the garden (that we didn't even plant!) Decided to adapt this recipe for my 2-year-old grandson who can't have gluten, eggs or nuts and eats very little sugar. He LOVES the little loaves of fruit/veggie bread I make. This was my first attempt at eggless baking . . . I used my large food processor. Subbed 1 c. organic can sugar + 1/4 c. honey + 1/4 c. pure maple syrup for sweetness, used flax seed meal + water for eggs, half amount of apple juice for water, 1/3 c unsweetened applesauce + 1 T. butter + 1/3 c. less 1 T. coconut oil (melted) for oil, Bob's Red Mill GF flour (only had 3 cups) for regular flour, pie spice for cloves and doubled cinnamon.

I will make this every chance I get. It was lovely. I halved the cloves as many suggested. It was good but I think next time I will take the chance and put it all in. Thank you BoltonLane for a GREAT recipe.

I did use dates versus raisins and pecans versus walnuts.  Reminds me more of zucchini bread than pumpkin.  Very good.

Love the flavor. I cooked the butternut squash in a little water for 8 min in the pressure cooker. This cut the preparation time down.
