HELPFUL TIPS NOT MENTIONED: I've been on a brownie rampage for the past month,and have made 10 recipes! THIS is the only one that consistency comes out the same!!!!  What's best about it is, ...there aren't 100 reviews changing how to do it b/c it's good as is!  What's not mentioned is, the exact same recipe (taste, chewy, big) is on here, but in cookie form!!! How wonderful is that esp. if you love this recipe like my family and husbands soldiers we send this to do?!  You can find it under "Best Big, Fat, Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookie" ...the title is exactly how they always turn out.  I love this in brownie AND cookie form, so try both!!!  Also, I prefer the chocolate chips to be mixed IN instead of on top, but it's all about preference!  It would be overkill to add more than recommended though.  When I double the recipe, I still only put a heaping 2/3 C of cc, and it's MORE than enough.  TWICE I have won best chocolate chip cookie on our military base due to this recipe.

Marvelous, absolutely fantastic! I doubled the recipe (the only thing I changed) and used a 13x9 pan allowing a bit longer cooking time.  Others have said these are "too sweet".  Most blonde brownies I tried were disappointing as they were not sweet enough. My preferences in dessert run on the "rich" side".  If you like rich desserts as I do, make as is for an 8x8 pan or double the recipe for a 13x9. Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe!

Excellent.  I have been looking for a good recipe for "blondies" for a long time!  Like many reviewers, I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 inch pan.  I also left out the nuts at mixed the chocolate chips right into the batter- would definitely recommend doing this!  BUT, do NOT store in the refrigerator!!  They were so great at first but got ruined when I put them in the refrigerator.  They got really hard, like little bricks! Oh well, I'll just have to make them again!  I'm sure no one will complain about that...

These brownies won me a Blue ribbon in the State fair culinary department and a grand champion from my family. I will definitely be trying this recipe again. The chocolate chips were very good with the flakey brownie and the brownie itself was moist in the middle and chewy throughout!!!

As far as I'm concerned, just about everything is wrong with these bars.  Too sweet.  Too gushy. Too brown sugary. Just a soft, sloppy, sweet glob of sugar butter. I'm afraid these made their way into the trash, because just as there's too many good books out there to waste your time reading a bad one, there's just too many good sweet treats out there to waste your time eating one that's not.

This recipe is just like the one I made years ago and I could never find it again. It came out perfectly. Nice and chewy, not too cakey, not too sweet. I doubled the recipes and I did cut down on the baking powder some. It seemed like a lot to me. I think I used about 3/4 of the recommended amount maybe a little bit less. I also used brownulated light brown sugar. Ya know, the one that pours ;). Oh, yeah, I cooked them in a 13x9 glass pan and did spray the pan lightly with cooking spray I also cooked them for slightly longer than the suggested time. My oven is brand new so I know the temperature is correct. They needed an extra 10 minutes or so. They came out excellent. Perfect.

Double this recipe and bake in a 9x13. These are to die for...so, you'll need twice as many. I love to mix butterscotch and chocolate chips. Yum!

These were really good. I omitted the walnuts. I also subsituted the chocolate chips for M&M's. I stirred them into the batter which made a neat chocolate-y center, and a two tone contrast wich was pretty. I submited a photo. I baked it on 325 for 25 minutes. The texture was exactly as it should be, just like a fugdy brownie without being underdone. Yummy. Next time I might try the swirled white and chocolate chips, because the M&M's weren't sweet enough for my taste.

My first blondies- loved them!!!  Easy to make, disappeared in no time.  They were gooey and chewy.  Husband says 5 1/2 stars.  The changes I made:  I used only  1/4 tsp baking powder, just a pinch of salt.  Used a whole stick of butter-(might as well use it up)- actually forgot (oops) the vanilla- used 1/2 cup choc chips and mixed them in instead of just sprinkling them on top.  My pan was 8x8- took a little over 30 minutes.  I just kept testing with a toothpick after 20 minutes in 5 minute increments.  They are about gone!  Yummy!

I doubled the recipe as suggested, except for the baking soda. The brownies are chewy and sweet. I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate, and could barely wait for them to cool off before eating one. 
Be careful, they're addictive!

These are awesome. I've made many times using a different combination of baking chips and nuts, sometimes leaving out the nuts all together. I don't even use a mixer with these bars, just mix it all by hand in one bowl. I combine the dry ingredients first, then add the brown sugar, melted butter combined with vanilla, and beaten egg, then I mix with wooden spoon. Using a mixer will beat more air into batter, making for a more cakey brownie, and these are meant to be chewey and "fudgy," not cake-like. Do not overbake these brownies. They will continue to bake after you take them out of the oven. I bake for 23 minutes in my over and take them out just as the top turns goldern brown. I've made these with almonds and white chocolate chips, semi-sweet chips and toffee bits, and milk chocolate chips and pecans. These are just so easy, and everyone likes them.

mmmm, so yummy!  Didn't take me long to make and my parents have been munching away since they came out of the oven.  Dad keeps trying to convince me they're not that great (with one piece in each hand) so I'd leave them all at home.  Warning: Don't taste the batter, there won't be any left to bake.  My first blondie attempt is a success!  =)  I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan, used raisins on one half because my mom doesn't like chocolate chips.  Batter will rise around twice the original height.  Hopefully they're still as good tomorrow!  If there's any left.

I thought these were pretty good and my wife really enjoyed them but I think 1 tablespoon of vanilla is two much.  I would cut that back by half next time.

I made these for a party...here it is a day later and I am still thinking about them! I doubled the recipe and cooked them in a 13 X 9 pan, sprayed with pam, and cooked for 40 min. Instead of spreading the chips on the top, I mixed in 1/2 nestle toll house dark chips and 1/2 ghiradelli milk chocolate chips and 1 cup walnuts. The next time I need to contribute to a party I will DEFINITELY make these again...and probably will have a little french vanilla ice cream to go with them! Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!

Wow, this was disastrous!  I doubled the ingredients and baked in a 9x13 dish as suggested by others, but it just would not cook.  Even after 50 minutes in the oven about 90% of the pan was still dough!  Unfortunately I trusted all the glowing reviews and made this for the first time for a dinner party.  I prepared the batter and put in in the dish ahead of time and popped it in the oven as dinner was winding down so it would still be warm when served.  After leaving it in the oven for almost an hour I had to give up and just serve ice cream.  Really embarrassing!  From what I was able to taste of the 3/4" that was cooked around the edge, the flavor seemed good though.

Yum! These remind me of butterscotch brownies I used to make as a kid - chewy, buttery and delicious!  I added a touch more vanilla and only about 1/2 c chocolate chips based on personal taste.  Also, instead of mixing the wet and dry ingredients separately I melted the butter in a medium mixing bowl, added the brown sugar, vanilla and egg and then just dumped in the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt - voila, a one-bowl brownie recipe!  I like not having to do as many dishes so I can spend more time enjoying these yummy blondies. :)

Doubled the batch for a bake sale- turned out absolutely awesome.  I left out the soda and replaced with baking powder because I hate the taste of baking soda in anything.  I also mixed the chips and nuts into the batter as someone suggested and they were the best brownies I have ever made- hands down.

Delicious blonde brownies.  I doubled the recipe, used a 13 x 9" pan, and baked them 10 minutes longer for a perfectly chewy brownie. Instead of chocolate chips, I mixed an 11 oz. bag of Kraft caramel bits into the batter, topped with chopped pecans and finally drizzled caramel sauce over the top after they had cooled.  They were a hit!  A couple of tips--I line my pan with parchment, making it a breeze to lift the cooled brownies right out of the pan and cut into squares, and I also give the pan a light bang on the counter right out of the oven to make sure they settle down into a chewy-er brownie.

I made two batches. The first batch I threw out. I doubled all the ingredients, per other reviewers' suggestions, but didn't change anything otherwise. I baked it for 20 minutes, but it came out WAY TOO DRY and cakelike. Not the gooey and chewy texture I was expecting! Too much baking powder! Since I was running out of the ingredients, I made several changes for the second batch. DRY INGREDIENTS: 2 cups flour, 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1/8 tsp. baking soda, 1/2 tsp. salt. WET INGREDIENTS: 2/3 cup butter, 1 cup brown sugar (unpacked), 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/8 cup honey, 1 egg, 2 tbsp. greek yogurt, 1 tsp. vanilla extract. After combining the dry and wet ingredients, I folded in 1/3 cup chocolate chips and 1/3 cup butterscotch chips into the batter. Then on top, I sprinkled 1/3 cup chocolate chips and 1/3 cup butterscotch chips. After baking 20 minutes, it came out a lot better -- not dry at all! I'm hoping my co-workers will like them!  UPDATE: My co-workers loved them! I had baked them in the morning, and they were still warm when I took them to work. Someone said that they were melting in her mouth! Only one piece was left when I went back to check on them. Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good. I made a double batch of them, omitting the nuts (because I didn't have any) and topping with the chocolate chips.

I tested one, to see how they turned out. Then - I ate another one, because they were so yummy. The edges were chewy, just like I like them.

Great recipe.

OH MY! This is SO good! I followed the recipe except for doubling it.. and when I went to add the sugar I didn't have enough brown- so I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown.  It tastes just like the "Big Soft Chewy" cookie recipe- just in bar form! So much less time then making the individual cookies. I ended up cooking the double batch for about 32 minutes... even then it was a little undercooked but we like it that way :) Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

These tasted great, but I suspect I had a problem with the ingredients or time in the oven. The final result was much gooier than I had hoped. Still, they were eaten within a few hours.

Delicious!My husband loves white chocolate, so I subbed white chips for the chocolate chips. I then served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and a drizzle of hot caramel sauce. I think the regular chocolate chips would have made a better contrast to the vanilla and caramel. I'll try it that way next time. I agree that this is very much like a giant cookie.I cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 cup.(I can't even imagine how sweet it would have been otherwise!)Thanks for a wonderful, restaurant quality dessert.

So delicious!  I was out to lunch with a friend at a little organic sandwich shop and they had blonde brownies, I bought one and remembered how much I adored the chocolate chip cookie brownie cross!  I immediately set out to find a great recipe so I could make them at home.  I stumbled across this one.  Like many others, I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13.  I made these for a corporate potluck and they were a hit!  The recipe is easy to follow and it is pretty hard to screw it up.  I omitted nuts (just in case of any allergies) and I mixed the chocolate chips in.  The only thing I would say, is I may cut the vanilla in half next time, it is a pretty strong flavor in this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!  I will be making these again and again!

These were perfect! They really tasted like chocolate chip cookies but in a brownie form. One of the other reviewers mentions it's almost like the "big fat best chewy chocolate chip cookie" recipe, which is my go to ccc recipe, so the only thing I added was an extra egg yolk, I did everything else as stated. I will probably make these again before the cookies only because I can never quite get my cookies to come out good and these were perfect. Thanks for the perfect sweet tooth recipe Sue!

Excellent!  Nice and chewy, very dense and not too sweet.  I used one bowl and did step 2 and 3 first and then step 1.  I omitted the nuts and I mixed the chocolate chips in the batter but next time I will cut back on them, too much chocolate.  Baked it in an 8x8 pan and it was perfect, sprayed the pan with Baking Pam first.

Yum! You can make this a "one bowl" recipe! I mixed wet ingredients in step 3 and 4 in a bowl first. I think added dry ingredients straight to the same bowl (no need to sift flour). I doubled the recipe (all but the vanilla) and baked them in a 13x9 glass pan for 30 minutes. Also, I incorporated the chocolate chips into the mix (rather then sprinkling on top)

These really turned out well. I added my choc chips to the batter as others said and did not add more on top. I also doubled so I used a 9x13 pan but baked only for about 22 mins. Going to freeze half of them.
Will make these again!!

I followed the recipe exactly - except I used 1 t vanilla because 1 T seemed way too much.  I also am not sure if the baking soda is necessary here.  I did not like the consistency of these Blondies at all and will use another recipe next time.

This is my favorite bar cookie.  If you enjoy chocolate chip cookies, but don't have the time to make them, then give this recipe a try.  They are moist, chewy, and absoultely heavenly.  I used egg substitute because that's all I had.  I also mixed the chocolate chips into the batter and doubled the recipe to fit a 13x9 pan.  I'll probably reduce the amount of butter next time.  My family ate the entire pan in a day!

OMG these were just wonderful! I followed other suggestions and cut the vanilla in half and omitted the baking soda. I doubled the recipe for a 13x9 pan and baked 25-30 min. Absolutely delicious! PS - I also omitted the chocolate chips - true Blondies do not have any chocolate in them, hence the name. :o)

Very tasty blondies. Like other reviewers have said, you can easily cut back on the chocolate chips.

Note: If you're making this in a 13x9" pan, you'll want to TRIPLE (not double) the recipe.

Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic!  I won't even mention how many times I've made this, it's shameful.  The only thing I've changed was the sugar amount.  It taste no different with 3/4 c of white or brown sugar.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Rich - yes! Chewy - oh yeah! These were easy to make, easy to customize and DELISH! I mixed about half of the chips in with the batter and sprinkled the rest on top, very good that way. I used mostly semi-sweet chocolate chunks and a good handful of white chocolate chips. A total of 1 cup of chips.

I followed this recipe to a "T". Texture was very cake-like; not like a brownie at all. Also WAY too salty and under the salt they just taste like a mouthful of brown sugar. Sorry, but this recipe is a Blonde Brownie FAIL.

these brownies were very quick and easy, and would be great for kids, except that they turned out absolutely horribly. it could be that i messed up the recipe, but i dont think i did. They were EXTREMELY salty, and the most prominant taste other than salt was brown sugar. perhaps the recipe would be good if you substituted some white sugar, and used less salt.

This was the best brownie that I've ever made.  It was delicious!  It was like a thick, chewy homemade chocolate chip cookie--only better.  Like one of the other viewers, I used a 13 x 9 pan and doubled the recipe.  It turned out great.

Good recipe -- I doubled it and used a 9 x 13 pan, they turned out fine.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and didn't use the full 2 tbs. vanilla, it seemed like too much, so I only used 1 tsp. for the doubled recipe.  They turned out moist and delicious.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Use a smaller pan for a taller brownie.  3/4 cup of sugar is just enough and reduce the chocolate to half and mix all the chocolate in-no topping.  Thanks for your formula.

Very good Blondie recipe!! 4 stars since the ingredient list doesnt exactly match the instructions.  Otherwise this is a great dessert bar!  I quadrupled this and rather than chocolate chipped used chopped rolo candies on top.  Next I think ill try chopped snickers or peanut butter chips!  This one is a keeper.

These were okay, however I won't make them again. They are very sweet and very rich but since they are neither a brownie nor a cookie they leave you wanting something more. Edible, but definitely not worth it.

Made this recipe oct 1,2010. I had to cook them about 10 mins. more, so the chocolate chips could melt more. Well they were really good, very light and chocolatly.

Wow, these really came out great. I followed another reviewers advice and doubled the recipe and used a 9 X 13 pyrex pan. As a result, the cooking time was longer - I'd say check them at 30 minutes.  I followed the recipe exactly (except for the doubling) except in place of the walnuts I used a mixture of almonds and hazelnuts (just personal preference). I would not recommend omitting the nuts - they really work in this recipe.  I also mixed the chocolate chips into the batter instead of adding to the top.  These bake up so nicely, with that great flaky top that I love on brownies. The flavour is great and the texture is dense, moist and chewy - not cakey at all.  I'll absolutely make these again!

not too bad but waaaaaay to much vanilla - i doubled this recipe and 2 tblsp of vanilla extract is too much for anything - i knew it didn't look right but followed the recipe - all you can taste is the vanilla - should be 2 tsp not 2 tblsp

Simply divine!  I doubled the recipe, stirred 1 cup choc. chips into the batter, then sprinkled M&Ms on top.  They are the perfect texture - cripsy outside and soft inside!

I always know what the outcome of the recipe is going to be by the batter (yes, I know RAW eggs, its a risk I'm willing to take).  Anyway, this batter was SO good, I highly anticipated the final product!  After cooling down a bit out of the over, these were completely gobbled up.  This recipe is definitly a keeper!

Really good recipe.  Mixed the walnuts and chocolate chips into the batter - probably used more of both than called for, but very good.  Used a 8x8 greased pan and baked for 30 minutes and they came out perfect.

Um, so While all the ingredients were in the same bowl and all mixed, it was reaaaally thick, and the consistency of cookie dough. I triple checked the recipe, and I added all the ingredients. So I carry on and spread it in a 9x9 inch pan and it was impossible to get it all the way throughout the pan, the dough was probably less than a centimeter thick. I put it in the oven for less than the time because my oven cooks way faster, and checked it a bit early. And by then it was already really dry and flavorless. I did everything right and they turned out dry. Definetly not my type of brownie....

TOO MUCH VANILLA!  Looking at the other Blondie recipes they used 1 TEASPOON NOT TABLESPOON.  Perhaps it was an error in the posting.

Great brownie. It did remind me a bit like a chocolate chip cookie with a taste of caramel from all the brown sugar. Mine didn't turn out to look like that pic (the pic looks more like a fluffy cake)... mine was more dense and a little crispy like a cookie. I have never had a Blonde Brownie before so I can't compare this to anything. It did turn out how I expected it would, and I will make this often. Thanks for the recipe! :P

Yummy!!!!  I love these Blondies.  They are easy and delicious.  I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 pan.  I baked them for the full 25 minutes and they turned out perfect.

Only 4 stars because I didn't add the chocolate chips or walnuts.  I put a thin layer of the batter in the bottom of a 9x9 pan, then put oreo cookies (my husband's request) down and covered them with the remaining batter.  Came out awesome!!

Great recipe!! I changed it a little. First off I also doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 13 x 9 dish for 30 minutes. I reduced the amount of brown sugar by 1/4 cup  and added an egg. That is to say for a double recipe I used 3 eggs and 1/4 cup less brown sugar. I also sprinkled the chocolate chips on top BUT not as many as suggested in the recipe. The result was a soft blondie that was not too sweet and not sticky and mushy soft but it was a soft cake like consistency -PERFECT!!

Loved this recipe.  As other viewers recommended, doubled the recipe, mixed chocolate chips into batter and stored in ziploc bags.  Do not put in refrigerator, they become a little hard.

Loved them! Everyone said theirs were "soupy" mine were at first but just like the Ghirardelli brownies (from a box) they come out soupy but cool to chewy perfection. Don't plan on eating them right out of the oven unless you glop them over ice cream (yum!)

Definitely making these again. I did sub choco chips for Valentine's M&Ms to make it festive.

Woaw. I made those two weeks ago but it was a complete failure. I thought, since most reviews were so good, that I made something wrong. The top never seemed to bake so I let those a bit too long. Also I ran out of Baking powder and used extra baking soda. Also I forgot to turn on the oven so the battery had to sit a bit (bad bad bad thing...) It turned out good but they were so overcooked they were like hard cookies.
This time I used the baking powder and even if it was still way undercooked, I took them out (I was ready to put them back in if I saw they didn't "set" properly). Well, they turned out perfect :) A bit too sweet for me and I probably will cut the salt next time but the texture was absolutely perfect (and that was what I was looking for) a bit crispy on the edge and chewy and not completely cooked on the inside.
A few tips though: Since you use Baking powder, you need to put the battery in the pan and bake them right away. Don't do that in advance. If you don't like your dessert too sweet, cut a bit on sugar.
Oh and I didn't have nuts so I didn't use them. Thanks a lot for this recipe.

I made these last night following the recipe and they were just WAY too sweet.  The flour to sugar ratio should be at least 2:1.  They stuck to the pan and were just a gooey mess. The top and edges were done but the center and bottom of my 9x9 pan were absolutely runny after 30 minutes of baking. If you like sweets that will not send you into sugar shock I would pass on these.

YUMMY!! these are so good and moist. I doubled the batch and used 1/2 chocalate chips and 1/2 butterscotch. The other review that said that more chips are not needed was correct. these are so rich that more chips would be an over kill....Be sure to have milk available!!

I actually tried the recipe and had to make another batch of the ingredients to fill bottom of pan before I could put them in the oven. In other words, double the ingredients. They did not come out as I expected. Dry on the top and edges and the middle wasn't fully cooked. Didn't really like the taste either. I thought it was just me, but my 4 year old (who eats everything) only took one bite and left the rest on the table. I think I'll have to try another recipe.

Very simple, no mixers needed, done by hand from start to finish. I was rushing while making this and mistakenly put in the choc chips along with the nuts when the recipe said to sprinkle the choc. chips on top, didn't matter. However, I used only 1/2 cup of choc chips and it was still too much chocolate in each bite, would increase the nuts and cut back on the chocolate. The 9" pan makes blondies tht are not very high, so next time I would use nothing smaller than an 8" pan.

All I can say is that this is deadly!  I am pretty sure that my husband and I will eat the entire pan tonight!  I am not too crazy about chocolate brownies, but these are absolutely fantastic!  I did not use the chocolate chips, but I really don't think they are needed

YUM! I double the recipe and use 1/2 cup oil instead of margarine. I put in a 9 x13 pan. I once forgot to add salt and they tasted more cookie-ish. Overall yum and I LOVE THESE because if you use oil YOU DON'T NEED A MIXER!!

Easy, chewy brownies.  I swirled about 1/4 cup creamy peanut butter in the batter and served them with vanilla ice cream.  They were a hit.

DE-LIC-IOUS! As many people suggested I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan and mixed the chips into the batter. Baked longer- maybe 30 minutes? Will definately make again.... soon!

I like the cookie version better, but these are great when I don't want to spend as much time cooking.  I've also tried using butterscotch chips, my boys liked it that way better.

These are my new favorite dessert!!!!! Super easy and sooooo delish!!! I doubled the recipe and made them in a 13x9 pan lined with parchment paper. The first time I made them I tried to cut them shortly after they came out of the oven but they were almost raw it seemed. After they cooled they were perfect! Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. So make these ahead of time and give them a chance to cool completely. I didn't use the nuts b/c I don't like them in desserts. I used 1/2 butterscotch chips and 1/2 chocolate chips folded in vs on top. Everyone has LOVED them.

This was the first time I made blondies. It tasted like chocolate chip cookies in a cake-y form. I doubled the recipe except the vanilla. I thought 2 tablespoons would be to much, kept it at 1 full tablespoon. I used a full stick of butter. I agree with another reviewer, the directions for this recipe were bad. It didn't specify melted butter or softened butter and the cup of flour to be sifted before or after measuring. I did melt the butter and sifted the flour after measuring 2 cups. I would test this with the spring back method rather than a toothpick. I used a toothpick and it came out sticky even when it was done. I over baked it cause the toothpick never came out clean. When I touch it, it was def done. It came out extremely dry for me, baked it to long.

These were good, but we didn't think they were amazing.  Next time I will either try another recipe; if I use this one I will use less vanilla....the vanilla was too prominent.  Like many others, I mixed the chocolate chips into the dough and sprinkled some on top.

very tasty, but difficult to cut into bars, as they crumbled very easily. Perhaps the instructed cooking time is a little too long??

Delicious!  I used 2 tsps of vanilla instead of the whole tablespoon.  Very tasty!  It didn't seem like there was much batter, but it turned out to be the perfect size treat for me and my son.  I would double the recipe though, if baking for a crowd.

I actually had to make this twice to get it right. I thought it was weird when there was NO mention of greasing a pan. So lesson learned....these are like cookies, need about 10 mins to cool them PROMPTLY remove otherwise they WILL NOT come out of the pan. Otherwise it was great.

Made these for a party, doubled the basic recipe, added butterscotch chips and red & green m&m's.  They were gone in no time.  This is a sure winner and could be done with endless combinations of add-ins.  This one is a keeper!

I didn't alter this recipe except to reduce the salt to just a dash. I doubled the recipe and used an 8x12 inch cake pan and thought it made the perfect thickness, I believe a 9x13 inch pan would make these blondies too thin. I baked for 38 minutes. The consistency was perfect for me, they were moist and very chewy like a brownie should be, not cakey at all. They had a lovely textured crust on the top and bottom to encase the gooey middle. Basically they just taste like chocolate chip cookie bars (which is delicious in it's own right) but to make true blondies they should be made with butterscotch chips instead of chocolate.

I made this exactly to the recipe with the exception to the nuts.  It is sooo good!  I put the chocolate chips on top as the recipe said.  I read others reviews that the chips were on the inside, but I was afraid it would turn out a brownie.

Fabulous recipe exactly as written! My only change the first time I made these was purely personal preference - I mixed the choc chips into the batter.  Baked them for 25 mins and they were awesome! Made them a week later with a big handful of toffee bits, semi-sweet and milk choc chips and baked for 28 mins and they were insanely delicious.  My husband is a die hard basic chocolate chip cookie or plain chocolate brownie guy but he loved these! This recipe is amazing!

I have never made blonde brownies before and we ate 1/2 pan in one night. The only thing I did different was that I added 1/8 tsp of cinnamon to the flour mixture and used 1/4 c. chocolate chips and 1/4 c. butterscotch chips for the topping. Very moist and delicious!

You might as well double it from the get-go. These are so seriously the BEST! Not just a choco chip cookie recipe in bar form. Nope. So flippin yummy! Chewy and satisfying with a wonderful flavor. The melted butter and 100% brown sugar make this recipe rock!! My husband is addicted and he doesn't even care about cookies.  I'm sad and sorry (not to mention chubbier) to say that we polished off a double batch over the weekend! I baked them to give away as thank you gifts. Yikes. I'm a terrible person. Please make these, you won't be disappointed.

I followed the directions to a "T". They were bland and I did not like the texture. The middle was gooey and the edges were hard. I don't recommend these bars at all.

Yet another stellar recipe to add to the collection. Woohoo! I followed everyone's advice and doubled the recipe, then baked it in a 9"x13" pan. I also used 3/4 tsp baking powder in total and that was certainly more than enough.

Added some mini marshmallows to make "rocky road" blondies for the kids. The only thing I questioned was why there was baking powder and soda if there was no acid to activate the soda. So I subbed buttermilk for the milk. Great after school treat.

My husband ate the whole batch in 2 days! I used peanuts because my hubby doesn't like walnuts. I also didn't melt the butter. I just creamed it with the brown sugar and it turned out just fine! My only complaint is they fell flat in the middle and didn't hold together very well. They were yummy though, so I will be making these again!

Very good.  Cooked for about 25 min and still a little gooey in middle, but I think they will firm up when they cool.  Yummy...just like mom used to make.

PERFECT!  No need to change anything.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan.  They are the 1st blonde/tollhouse brownies I've had that are not hard and dry.  AWESOME!

Fantastic!  I left out the walnuts as I did not have them on hand.  These did not last the night in my house!

These are GREAT and very pretty with smarties (M&M's) too! My family loved them. I made a double batch in a 9x13 pan, replacing the chocolate chips with smarties (mixing half of them into the batter and sprinkling the other half on top, pressing in lightly). I also used margarine instead of butter, omitted the nuts and used half the vanilla. Tip: If using a dark non-stick pan, decrease the oven temp to 325. Yummy!!

I bake mine in an 8x8 inch pan and they come out great!  Only thing is they tend to "mound up" on the sides and be thinner in the middle so, spread the batter thicker in the center of the pan to help even out when baking.  These are SO GOOD!  I hardly ever make chocolate chip cookies anymore because we like these better!

Great! I left out the walnuts and ended up putting some sliced almonds on top along with white chocolate chips instead of the regular chocolate ones.

Not sure what I could have done wrong. I have reviewed the ingredients over and over again and I know I put the right measurements. They looked great when they came out of the oven but the whole center was uncooked. I put them back in until the edges, top and bottom were OVERDONE and yet the middle was STILL doughy! I will not be makimg this again.

Delicious sweet treat. This was very rich. This was almost like a giant pan cookie instead of a "brownie". I used light brown sugar and only sifted my flour the first time as I used a triple sifter and didn't want to lose any ingredients in the layers of mesh putting it through again. I did not use the nuts. I couldn't keep the guys out of these once they had the first bite. Thanks, these are great!

These tasted great. My husband loved them so much he wanted another batch made after we finished the first. I followed the recipe exactly, except for a few changes. I left out the nuts since I didn't have any on hand and I sprinkled the chocolate chips throughout the batter, as well as on top. I used milk chocoate chips instead of semi-sweet, and they turned out fine - not too sweet, like I feared. I also doubled the recipe, which made it fit perfectly in a 9x13 dish. The only reason I don't give this recipe 5 stars is because they were pretty gooey the first day. They still tasted yummy, but they were much more manageable on the second day. I think if I was serving these to other people, I'd actually bake them the night before.

These are our new favorite baked treat!   I double the recipe, bake in 9x13 for about 30 minutes.  I have tried reducing the amount of baking powder as others recommended, but I think the texture is better with the amount called for in the recipe (just my humble opinion).  The whole pan magically disapears in about a day (thanks to several teenagers)!

YUM! I really enjoyed this recipe - chewy and delicious.  I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate and reduced the baking powder by half because of other reviewers suggestions.  You can't buy blonde brownie mix anymore - but who cares - this whipped up in no time!  I will definately make these again.

Very, very good!  I decreased the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and made these even easier by not sifting.  I mixed all the dry ingredients together, then I added the melted butter, egg, and vanilla.  Finally the nuts and chips. I also greased the bottom of the pan.  We will definitely have these again.

This recipe turned out well. I did not have a 9x9 pan, so I used an 8x8 pan at 325 degrees for 25-30 minutes instead. I also mixed the chocolate chips in the batter which I think gave it more flavor...good and easy to make!

This was quite a treat.  I put far too many chocolate chips on the top, and it was still great (surprise, surprise!)  I would recommend cooking a little longer on a lower temp.

Great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Baked for 30 minutes and still looked undercooked inside so did another 7 minutes.  When it cooled it was very hard. Next time, I'll stop cooking even if it doesn't look quite done inside.

This recipe is very good. Following other reviewers suggestion about the sugar I reduced it by 1/4 of a cup and used only 3/4 cup of sugar. I think I can still go down to 1/2 a cup and it will still be good. I like low sugar content on sweets so definitely will give it a try. I like the chewy texture. The only thing I had to change was the nuts. I did not have walnuts so I used pecan pieces instead. It came out very good.
EDIT: cover them with plastic film and let them cool down till the next day...they will be even BETTER in flavor!

Wow! These are really great blondies!! I have to say, I doubled the batch (and ate them mostly myself) and made it in a round pan, and it came out great. I prefer the chocolate chips on the inside instead of on top, but that's a matter of preference. I think 22 minutes would be a better baking time, even if you didn't double the batch (I've made this more than once- I have tried it with a single batch too) I have found that the bottom can be a bit underdone with just 20 minutes. Double thumbs up for this!!

Really good! I doubled it and baked it in a 9x13 pan. I had to cover the pan in foil for the 2nd half of cooking because it was getting quite brown. These came out great with very little work.

This is the first time I have baked and eaten blondies but this will be my new standby dessert recipe. I thought the recipe was strange with so much vanilla but it turned out great, and so different than the regular bars and brownies people bring to potlucks and bake sales. I doubled the recipe, used butterscotch chips, and baked for 35 minutes. Perfect!

Made it according to the recipe. While I am a huge fan of cookies and brownies, cakes, blondies, and all things sweet, I found these way too sweet. I will cut back on the brown sugar by 1/4th the next time I make these. I've never had to do that with any other recipe I've made, because sugar and I are best friends! Other than that it was pretty good, crisp edges, gooey inside. I think i took it out of the oven a bit too early at twenty minutes, it could have used another three minutes. Still, I liked the texture.

We found these pretty good-when fresh and still a bit warm out of the oven (with real vanilla ice cream), but my (adult) children did not care for them the next day and none wanted to take any home-which is rare. I think they were just easier to accept warm and mushy in a bowl with the ice cream. It was an ok quick dessert I guess, but probably not a do-over for us. We have had much better.

5 stars! Even my daughter who wanted me to make brownies or chocolate chip cookies instead of "blondies" said, "How did I never know about these?" The only change I made was to top the blondies with 1/3 cup chocolate chips and 1/3 cup butterscotch chips.  These are worth every calorie!   JanPan

This was great as-is. I used an 8x8 pan and I wouldn't recommend using the 9x9 unless you want a flat cookie. I wanted more of a brownie and it was still a thinner brownie even in an 8x8.  It has a great taste though.  You don't taste any baking powder or baking soda like you do sometimes in cookies. It's going into the cookie rotation here. It passed the cookie monster's test (my husband).

Very yummy.  I made this recipe tonight and baked it in a 8x8 pan instead of the 9x9.  I also put 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 of butterscotch chips on top just before baking.  They were absolutely delish!!

I've made this twice.  It always turns out good, but it turns out more like a 9x13 chocolate chip cookie; not gooey-soft brownie like.  The recipe was followed exactly with the same results both times.  It's good, so I can't complain; it just wasn't blonde brownies.

I've made this many times and I have found that I like the chocolate chips mixed in the best.  Otherwise perfect.  1/2 cup was plenty for us and when I double the recipe, 3/4 c was perfect.

I have tried this recipe quite a few times and each time they seem to turn out better and better. I added about a couple of tablespoons of mini semi chocolate chips on top. It was like eating a chewy toffee bar with chocolate. My hubby and I just loved these!

These are amazing!  I love blonde brownies and this is the best recipe for them that I have found.  Made them as stated except that I mixed my chocolate chips into the batter.  I bet these would be great warmed up with a scoop of ice cream on top.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! Great, quick treat for a group. The only changes I made were to mix in the chocolate chips, and I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan because in our house, a 9x9 pan just isn't enough! My new go-to recipe for blondies!

Three words for all making this recipe: DOUBLE. THE. RECIPE. It makes too little in its original form, but man did it turn out delicious once I baked it in a 8x11 pan. But, even more importantly, carefully scan a recipe before following it blindly. I knew that there was way too much vanilla extract so i halved it. Also, I never measure my salt exactly, a pinch is fine. Last but not least, use common sense my lovelies and you'll have tasty brownies for sure. (:

these were good, they taste just like an underdone chocolate chip cookie right out from the oven, just be sure to fold chocolate chips with 1 or 2 tablespoons of flour or they'll sink and also have patience and eat them when they completely cool because they taste too buttery when hot,but though they are good they can't beat chocolate brownies of course

These are so delicious and so easy!  A good go-to dessert recipe because you can make them quickly with ingredients that you most likely already have. I make them without nuts because I'm not fan.

these are very good. Giving 4 stars because if I went and cooked it like it said it would have burnt. I also think an 8 x 8 pan would be better than 9x9. to little of batter for that 9x9 pan,but I made it work and just cooked it for 15 minutes ..  perfect.

Definitely a winner! You know it's worth a try if you read the reviews and for once they're NOT all full of "this was good, I only changed ... [3 or 4 items]" Nope, the only variations you see are techniques like stirring in the chips, doubling the recipe(do it!), and trying different nuts or chocolate. Fantastic for last-minute company, or an impromptu picnic: done in under an hour, uses only ingredients I have on hand, and super yummy.

These are really good.  I made mine gluten free, using a GF flour blend and adding a teaspoon of xantham gum.  I also used mini chocolate chips instead of the regular sized ones.  Will definitely make again.

These were great. I used a glass container and cooked for 25 minutes...it could have used another few minutes as the middle wasn't all the way done. I also added COCONUT flakes and mixed the chocolate chips up. These were good and I ate too many!

mmm...where do i begin? I guess my personal twist. I was on the search to make blondie brownies & use up my almond slices & was craving white chocolate...;) SO.. keep the "base" the same, add 1/2 tsp. almond extract & I swapped walnuts for ALMONDS SLIVERS(which I crushed) & put about 1/2 to 1 C. white choc chips IN the batter. I baked this in a glass pan..It's hard to tell when It's done & well I just got lucky & am still lost on how to tel??..sry, I also made ANOTHER batch, & baked in mini muffin pan to make "brownie bites" BEWARE THEY COOK SUPER FAST THIS WAY! now... my review! Heavenly! I am in love with these, the bars were chewy & delish...so addictive with white chocolate & almond extract, I got SOME RAVES on these like over & over about how delicious they are!And the minis- were a little crunchier but they are both so good, I can't decide what way I like best?! AHMAZING! I gave it 4 * though since this is prettymuch 50% a totally dif. recipe in a way. YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS! AMAZING!

First I must say that I have never given a recipe review but this was so good I decided to do one.  I did double the recipe as other's suggested but for me it only fits an 8x8 pan even when doubled.  I listened to others about the sweetness of a double batch so I left the vanilla at 1TBS and the brown sugar at 1 1/2 C. Also I added a full cup of butter and of course mixed in the chocolate chips.  Needless to say this was absolutely FAB! My sisters practically fought over how big their pieces were and who should have the   last slice, of course I took it! LOL!  Great recipe and thank you to everyone for your tips and tricks to make this the best!

My family LOVES this recipe: it's hot, gooey, and tasty. We had to bake ours for thirty minutes, because at twenty minutes the blondies were still "soup".

Yum! I feel like I always make brownies so I decided to give these a try. I doubled the recipe and used mini M&Ms, otherwise followed exactly as is. For a second, I questioned the quantity of vanilla... but it's amazing, just do it!

Mixed the chocolate chips in instead of putting them on top- made exactly as stated otherwise.  Delicous!  Exactly what I was looking for- something brownie-meets-chocolate chip cookie!

Delicious.  Mixed 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips with batter and after spreading in an 8x8, sprinkled an addition 1/3 cup over top. Yummy. Me, hubby and kids ate it all up.

I followed the recipe exactly (except I just realized I misread the vanilla and only used 1 tsp). Super easy to make and delicious! Everyone loved them. I've baked a ton of things found on allrecipes and this is def one of my new favors for the simplicity and easy and yummy result. Tastes like a thick, chewy chocolate chip cookie. 1/2 cup of chips was more than enough. Thanks for the recipe!

While these tasted good, they are NOT Blondies. It's a big cookie. I blame myself for not looking at the picture closer. I wanted something that was more inline with a BROWNIE, except not chocolate. NOT a COOKIE. Very disapointed by this recipe and am surprised by how many people have given it 5 stars. It's not that good by any stretch. They should change the name to chocolate chip cookie since it's not a blondie at all.

...delicious!  I followed the recipe almost exactly as written -- except decreased the amount of brown sugar  (using 3/4c loosely-packed instead of 1c).  Result:  it a chocolate chip cookie blondie!  I'm glad I omitted some sugar as it was still a bit sweet for me.  I did add about 3T of water to thin the batter down a bit.  Next time around, I plan to decrease the sugar amount further.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

OMG ~ delicious! I doubled the recipe, stirred all of the chocolate chips into the batter, and ditched the walnuts.  My husband BEGS me to make these when his sweet tooth strikes!  And believe it or not - these are better at room temperature than warm out of the oven!

Oh wow. These are amazing! I wasn't as careful with the flour sifting as I could have been, folded in the chocolate chips instead of sprinkling and baked it in a 8x8 because that's what I had. They took a few minutes longer that way, but were worth the wait. I am eating a warm one right now, and I don't know if they will make it til morning.

Made it exactly as stated except doubled. My kids thought they'd died and gone to heaven. I tried putting the chips in the batter, but they sank to the bottom and stuck to the pan. If you put them on top, the batter sort of "grows" up around them. They don't just sit on the top. Thanks for submitting!

These brownies were good. . I made the recipe as is except w/o nuts ( I don't like any kind of nuts) I only made a half-batch in a loaf pan. Took about 30 minutes to finish. Maybe next time I will pour half of the batter in, sprinkle half of the chocolate chips, then repeat as really only about a handful of chips can fit on the surface of the entire thing.

Deliciously gooey. I left out the nuts due to personal preference and just purely out of habit added the chocolate chips into the batter. They took about 30 minutes to cook for me. Thanks for a lovely treat Sue.

I am eating one out of the pan now and burning my tongue!  All I can taste is vanilla and chocolate chips.  Next time I will cut the vanilla in half.  I knew one TABELSPOON sounded like a lot, so I checked and double checked the recipe.  No other reviews commented on the vanilla, so I figured I would add it here.  Other than that, they are yummy and gooey!

Very yummy! I made exactly as directed and they tasted wonderful! Very moist, very easy, very delicious! I did spray the pan w/ Pam cooking spray, even though it didn't say to do so. Next time I will double the recipe so that it makes a 9x13 pan full, b/c now I don't have any left for my husband after taking them to work!Thank you!

Doubled the recipe and should have cooked longer. Taste was great. As others mentioned, not overly sweet. I treated this like a chocolate chip cookie and used different mix-ins. Don't consider that really altering. Used vanilla chips, craisins and fresh blueberries.

Very good bars.  Next time I may reduce salt to a 1/4 t. per personal preference.  Great use of leftover chocolate chips.

These were good.  Easy to make.  My family liked them.  I did press them onto a cookie sheet and then baked them.  I like a thinner bar/cookie.  I baked them 20 min, but when I make them again I would take them out a bit sooner as they got a little crispy.

Wonderful!  Made exactly as recipe states but used half chocolate chips and half butterscotch chips.  These were good out of the oven, but to die for after sitting overnight.

My friends and family love this recipe!  I also make them with white chocolate chips and chopped macadamia nuts.....so good!  I took the advice of another reviewer and undercooked them a little and they reminded me of a mrs. fields cookie.

AMAZING RECIPE!!!!! They actually taste like chocolate chip cookies but even better! I followed the recipe just added less salt and did not add the walnuts, I also added the chocolate chips to the battter and sprinkled some on top too. They came out wonderful!!

Absolutely Fantastic!!!! This was my first blondie and I think this is a new favorite. Baked for 22 minutes and they turned out perfect. Make sure to let them cool COMPLETELY before cutting, otherwise they fall apart. I made a double batch and took them to a Super Bowl Party and they were hit! Other than doubling the recipe and baking in a 13x9 pan, the only change i made was the chocolate. Using as much as the recipe calls for would be way too much. I suggest you just sprinkle however many you like for your own preference. Warning: they take forever to cool, so if you're planning to take them somewhere, make them early with enough time to cool for 3-4 hours.
UPDATE: made them exactly as the recipe said (but with less chocolate chips) for my high school tennis team's state match and they went CRAZY over them! i now owe about 12 people blondies for their birthdays!

I couldn't wait for these brownies to cool, so cut them warm. They are awesome! I doubled the recipe to make a 9 x 13. I used 1 cup choc chips and it was plenty for us. Next time I'll reduce the brown sugar to 1 1/2 cups for a double batch as it was a tad too sweet for us. I'll also bake the full 35 minutes as they were a tad doughy in the center. It may have b/c I cut them while warm. These brownies taste like thick fudgy choc chip cookies. I decided to make this recipe over a Martha Stewart recipe b/c Martha's recipe called for 2 1/4 sticks of butter. Way too much for me! I did use stick margarine and it was still awesome. I'll look no further for a blonde brownie! My 21 yr old son LOVED them and he is really picky. I can't wait to try this recipe with butterscotch and peanut butter chips! Thank you so much for posting. I still can't believe how good this recipe is using only 2/3 c butter/ margarine (double batch)! Bakers, you must try this recipe!
P.S. I used 2 teaspoons Mexican pure vanilla and it was pretty strong. Next time I'll back it to 1 1/2 teaspoons. Also, I didn't use a mixer: mixed everything by hand. They turned out chewy, not cakey.

Good, but I doubled the recipe and cooked about 35 minutes. Also, there was a little too much baking powder so it was a lot fluffier than in the picture. To make a more dense blondie, I suggest 1/4 t. baking powder instead 1/2 t. and 1/4 t. baking soda instead of 1/8 t.

Loved these so much!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, just cut down on the brown sugar and vanilla just a tad. I also added 1/4 cup toffee bits to the top as well as the choc chips.  The edges were crispy and yummy.  Will definitely make these again for a treat.

I don't know what I expected when I made these brownies. I guess I was expecting more of a chocolate chip cookie flavor but with a brownie texture. That is not what happened though. I do really enjoy the texture. I think the main problem is the vanilla. I should have listened to my instincts, which screamed "this is way too much vanilla." However, I really didn't want to change the recipe. You can't give a fair review if you do that, plus with so many awesome ratings I figured I shouldn't change it. I was wrong. The vanilla is so overpowering I almost feel like these should be called vanilla brownies! A tablespoon of vanilla extract is far too much. A quarter of that would do just fine. I'll consider trying this again but with far less vanilla.

I followed the recipe, EXCEPT used crushed Butterfinger bars instead of chocolate chips.  These were heaven - ooey, gooey, goodness.  Make sure you don't overbake, and then let sit until completely cooled.  Mine came out of the pan perfectly with the edges just a little crunchier and chewier than the rich buttery center.  Perfect!

Made these last night and they were gone within 15 minutes of coming out of the oven (including 5 minutes of cooling time)! I added some chopped walnuts with the chocolate chips for a little extra crunch, absolutely delicious & gooey!

Definitely need to double the recipe.  My first batch barely made a 1/4 sheet pan.  Otherwise, very good.

This was just OK tasting. Not my personal favorite. Kind of bland and boring chocolate chip cake.

Very good recipe and easy too. Good texture, slightly chewy. I used half chocolate chips & half white chocolate chips for the top. Hubby & toddler approved in my house!

I love this recipe! I did a bunch of holiday baking with a friend and we agreed that this was the best recipe we used. We added a few butterscotch chips just for fun and it was a tasty touch.

Yum! I made these over at my in-laws and they were delicious. Sadly, I had to omit the nuts (due to allergy) so I added some whole dried cherries instead. I could see where the nuts would add some great texture, but the cherries were amazing, too! The dried cherries prevented it from being too much of a globby sweet mass. I also used dark chocolate chips instead of semisweet, but I don't think the type of chocolate matters much. Just don't use milk chocolate, it would be too bland. I will definitely make these again :D

I altered these just to replace the chocolate chips with Butterscotch chips for someone who LOVES Butterscotch Blondies - these are SO GOOD! I loved them, she loved them - I got compliments from many people who tried them at work!

I've made these blondies at least 5 times in the last 2 weeks, due to requests from my coworkers. Very delicious, but beware because they are very sweet! When I make mine I replace the chocolate chips with white chocolate or butterscotch chips, and I mix them in rather than sprinkling on top. Will make again!

I was nervous about these ingredient proportions from the beginning, and should have trusted my instincts. We actually had to toss out most of the pan after trying the brownies, because they were overly sweet and way too rich to eat. Disappointing and felt like a waste of ingredients.

Yummy! Seems more like a choc chip cookie bar but very good. Here's what I did...doubled the recipe & used glass 13x9 pan, reduced to 325deg. for 30 min. I took the advice of a few reviews & make these changes. 3/4 tsp powder; half the vanilla (its sweet enough); mixed in 1c choc chips & 1/3c white chips into the flour. And I used UNsalted butter. Dont forget my changes are for a double recipe. Enjoy!

I have to admit that I'm a a sucker for a good blondie dessert & I REALLY wanted to love this one. But if I'm going to be totally honest, it was just OK for me. I felt like it was lacking in flavor (missing something) and fell short in comparison to previous blondies that I've had. I even went back to the recipe to make sure that I didn't forget an ingridient or miss a step in the directions. And, unfortunately I didn't. I'm sadly disappointed w/ this one.

These were not the Blondies I grew up with. They were chewy and a little too sweet--the vanilla was also overpowering. I remember Blondies as more cake-like...these were literally cookies in bar form (as other reviewers have pointed out). My family enjoyed them but they didn't ease my craving for traditional Blondies: thicker, lighter bars. I'm deleting this recipe and will be on the hunt for another one :)

I left out the chocolate chips (I guess I'm a Blondie purist) and I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9 x 13 x 2 inch dish. I kid you not, these were gone by morning. Dangerously Yummy!

I would definitely call this dessert restaurant-quality, served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. I did cut back on the sugar by about 2 tablespoons, we like our "sweets" a little less sweet! Omitted walnuts, used smart balance 50/50 butter and increased chocolate chips to 1 cup.

They had a distinct, and not unpleasant flavor, however I found they had a bit of a tinny/metallic aftertaste. It was better not to think of these as brownies, and more like coffee slice.

YUM YUM YUM!!! Thank you for the recipe!!! I altered it a little. I suggest doubling the recipe too!!! Also using 1/2 t of baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 3/4 c of chopped pecans or walnuts, and 1/2 c of chocolate chips (white, milk or dark will work well). All these quantities are the doubled amounts. I mixed the chocolate chips in too. Thanks again!!!

These were moist, chewy, sweet, yummy goodness! I also doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan. I stirred in about 1/2 c of the chocolate chips and sprinkled almost a 1/2 c on top and left the nuts out completely. Soooo good!

I 'm sorry but I did not care for this.  This was my first time making blondies as a surprise for my husband.  I was encouraged by all the good reviews and the reviews did not have a million changes to the recipe.  But these are just bad.  They were too sweet (and I am a sweet junkie) they were too gooy in the middle, and too much vanilla which made them taste like alcahol.  I am giving them 3 stars because my husband will eat them but he eats almost anything. I will not be making these again.

These were delicious! I used a mixture of white and chocolate chips, and substituted pecans for the walnuts. I had to use an 8"x8" pan so I increased the baking time to about 40 minutes. Goes great with a cup of extra bold coffee.

I doubled this recipe and it took forever to bake.  I thought it would still be good but it is way too sweet for my taste.  All I can taste is the brown sugar.  I may try it again but won't double it this time.  I'm hoping I made a mistake the first time because I was so looking forward to this after reading the reviews.

I followed the directions to a tee and mine came out extremely dry.  We ended up throwing the entire batch away.  The flavor was good but too dry.  Not sure what I did wrong???  I am going to make them again today and cut back on the baking powder.  Hopefully they will be moist and chewy.    ****UPDATE**** I made them again this afternoon and here are the changes I made...I omitted the baking soda, added 1 TBS. vanilla and 2 TBS. of heavy cream to mixture.  I also was sure NOT to overmix the flour mixture!!! OVERMIXING WILL CAUSE DRY BROWNIES!! I mixed white chocolate chips and butterscotch chips into the batter and sprinkled brown sugar over the top.  They came out moist and chewy!  EXCELLENT!

Excellent!!  These are now a staple at my house because they are so easy to put together and everyone loves them.  I also doubled and baked in a 9x13 pan, allowing about 25 minutes in the oven.  Also left out the nuts and mixed the chocolate chips right in.  Also good with milk chocolate chips.  Yum!

I made a double batch for the 9X13 pan.. it was so good!! Loved it. My mom used to make "Blondies," as we call them, but this recipe surpassed hers--I'll be letting her know to try them out!! Absolutely LOVED the chewiness..

In a word... delicious!  I'm trying to change my cooking style (to be more healthy) so I made some alterations...  I doubled the recipe like many suggested. Then  I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and one cup of white flour, used 1 cup of unpacked brown sugar rather than 2 cups of packed brown sugar, and used 1/3 cup of greek yogurt and 1/3 cup of butter rather than 2/3 cup of butter.  I also reduced the amount of baking powder and omitted the walnuts.    Just cutting the brown sugar in half (and not packing it) saved 92 calories per brownie (if you say a double batch makes 12 servings).  Using greek yogurt for 1/3 cup of butter saves you another 38.  Omitting the walnuts chops off another 64 calories per blondie...  The grand total saved?  194!  So, if the nutritional facts to the right of the recipe are accurate, as I made them, there were 218 calories per brownie.    I made these for company today and they were a big success!  No one would ever be able to tell that I made all those changes... My husband finished all that were left just a few minutes ago!

When I say this recipe is good. I MEAN IT. Seriously, I had to make another batch right away because everyone ate them all up and were begging for more. This recipe easily doubles as well. I suggest putting a tad bit extra vanilla. Other than that, it's perfect.

Oh God! This was so good and so easy! I was out of chocolate chips so added Hershey kisses I had on hand on top about 5 minutes before taking it out of the oven. Delish! I reduced the sugar by half, loosely packed and it was sweet enough....My teeth hurt just imagining what a whole cup of sugar will do.

YUMMYYYYYY!  Rich and chewy and YUM YUM YUM YUM.  I put chocolate chips on half of the blondies and left the other half plain.  My boyfriend likes chocolate chips in almost everything, but the reason I usually make blondies is to escape the typical chocolate dessert =)

These are really good and to me they are easier than making cookies! I use light margarine at room temp. If you melt the margarine or butter it helps to let the batter sit in the fridge for a little while before baking. Also remember a glass pan will cook these much quicker than a metal one. I also add extra chocolate chips on top after the batter is spread in the pan because for some reason my chips sink to the bottom every time.

I made a batch for our Super Bowl party and my family finished them all before our guests arrived! I have made 4 batches since yesterday, and they are all gone. Best Blonde Brownie recipe I have found, period. They are moist, chewy, delicious and EASY. My kids even made the last batch with very little supervision from me. My DH said that he prefers these to regular brownies. I am sold and will use ONLY this recipe from now on!

yummy yummy. This is a great bar, and was so quick to make. I included most of the chocolate chips in the bar, and sprinkled heath bar chips on top. Great with vanilla ice cream.

We thought these were ok - VERY sweet though.  I realized at the last minute that I didn't have any walnuts, so I left them out - apart from that, I followed the recipe exactly.  In the end, we just found that they were chocolate chip cookies in the form of a bar instead of a cookie.

I admit that my expectations with this recipe were quite high; one of my favorite indulgences is a thick, fudgey blondie from my local Great Harvest Bread Co.  Lots of nuts, white and dark chocolate chunks, a combination of sugars that melt in your mouth just like homemade fudge... mmm!  This recipe DOES NOT make that blondie.  It's okay, but it tasted more like a bar cookie than anything.  If I wanted bar cookies, I would have used the recipe on the back of the chocolate chip bag, right?  These "blonde brownies" just did not have the consistency that I crave.  I made the recipe as written except I added a little less vanilla than called for (I use an extra strong vanilla extract from Penzey's, which is super concentrated, so I usually scale back my vanilla), and I did not have walnuts, so I mixed in half a cup of semi-sweet mini chocolate chips into the batter and then sprinkled about 1/4 of a cup over the top as instructed.  I also baked them in an 8x8 since I don't own a 9x9; it made no difference in the baking time.  The taste was all right, nice and sweet, perfectly cooked, but it was too cake-like for me.  Again, it's not a bad recipe by any means, and I'm sure it will make a lot of people happy.  I for one, however, will just have to continue the search for the perfect blondie.

EXCELLENT & HIGHLY ADDICTIVE.  YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO DOUBLE THE RECIPE.  WHEN I FINISHED MIXING IT, I WAS WONDERING IF I HAD MESSED UP THE AMOUNTS OF THE INGREDIENTS.  I HADN'T, THE RECIPE JUST DOESN'T MAKE ENOUGH.  GREAT FOOL PROOF BLONDIE!

My new favorite chocolate chip cookie recipe!!  These are awesome.  I double the recipe and bake in a 13x9 inch pan for 28 minutes until it's a nice golden brown on top.  They turn out thick and chewy & delicious, and they disappear every time I make them.  I undercooked them once on accident, and they still tasted good, but were very gooey.

Really chewy and tasty as a blondie should be! Only change I will make next time is to throw a few chips into the batter as well as putting a few on top.

I guess I'm in the minority... But these blondies were just wayyyyyyyy too sweet for me and my family. The whole pan is just sitting on the kitchen table. That never happens in my house. I may try again with less brown sugar... But man, these made my teeth hurt!

These are super simple and take no time to make. My kids like them better than brownies. So did my church. Have made them twice this week.

These were fabulous!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I mixed 1/3 cup of the chocolate chips into the batter and sprinkled the other 1/3 cup on top.  I used dark brown sugar for a deeper flavor and used a 9" round tin, since I couldn't find a square one.  Only problem with this recipe is, it's hard to stop eating them!

Awesome brownies. Great caramel flavor and chewy texture. We are gluten free and this recipe was great made w/a GF baking mixture.
Great for kids and adults. We plan to bake this often!

These are great!  I used half whole wheat pastry flour and omitted the cholate chips.  Instead, I frosted them with Burnt Butter Frosting (halved) from this site.  (I had accidentaly burnt some butter while making Light Wheat Rolls... this was a good use for it!)  Both the blondies and the frosting have a wonderful carmely flavor, and the blondies have a great texture.

Unbelievable!  These are the best I have ever tried!  We made this for a superbowl party, and EVERY just loved them!  There was nothing left!  Thank you.

We also baked it WITH chocolate chips in the batter, and no nuts.  Sprinkled some on top.

Great recipe.  Very thick and chewy (not cake-like).  Add coconut, butterscotch chips, toffee pieces, etc to mix it up a bit.

These were very good!  I made them because my I am not a huge fan of chocolate and I love white chocolate flavored things.  I followed the recipe exactly and my family loved it.  They did suggest that next time I mix chocolate chips into the batter instead of just putting them on top.  I liked it as is, and would also like it with the chocolate chips mixed in.  Either way, it was excellent!

I would like to try the other users suggestion to double the recipe and make it in a 9x13 pan.  One batch just wasn't enough since they were SO good!!!

This recipe is sooooo good and easy.  It makes really thin brownies, I would consider doubling it and putting it in the same sized baking dish - as it is, I really had to stretch the batter or it wouldn't cover the bottom of the dish.  I used Reynold's Release aluminum foil and it came out sooo easily.  I took someone else's suggestion and used half chocolate chips and half butterscotch chips and only needed 20 minutes - I'd rather it come out underdone than overdone, but in this case it was perfect.

These brownies are fantastic! I was a little worried when I saw the picture because I thought they would be too fluffy...instead they were perfect consistancy, nice and chewy. I left out the chips and nuts and also cut down the baking powder.

I baked these brownies for a cookie exchange and they were a hit. Everyone wanted the recipe and I've made it over and over again by requests! Although it's a brownie it turns to look like a thick chocolate chip cookie.

These were very good!  I doubled the recipe and they were gone in less than 10 minutes (I live with two boys).  They tasted more like a mix between cookies and brownies though.  Still very yummy though!

These were the first blondies that I've baked and will probably be the only recipe I will ever need!  They were so delicious-moist and chewy.  I omitted the nuts and added peanut butter chips. I definately recommend this recipe if you want more of a brownie/cookie texture, not fluffy and cakey.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I agree with some of the previous posters in that there is too much baking powder/soda.  I could actually taste it in the final product and it had a bitter aftertaste.  I think had the baking powder/soda been reduced they would have been really good.  The texture was like a very dense brownie (I sifted the flour before measuring as instructed).  I did like the texture.  To cover up the baking soda aftertaste I made some chocolate frosting.  Then everyone liked them.

Don't know what all the fuss is about baking powder.  This recipe worked fantastically.  I used white chocolate chopped and mixed in the mixture last.  Everyone asked me for the recipe, except those who missed out and asked me to make it again.

I have finally found a great blondie recipe! Just made 'em - my younger brother eats them up like gummi bears! I mixed my choco chips inside instead of sprinkling them atop the batter, reduced the vanilla to 1 tbsp., use 1/4 tsp. of baking soda, used swans down cake flour and used one egg when making a dozen. This is a great blondie brownie...crisp golden texture on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside. MMmm...MMmm!!!

WOW!  I work at a bakery and I am always looking for easy cookies and bars.  These DID come out more like a moist chewy cookie, but they have been selling like CRAZY.  Honestly, I was originally looking for something with more of a brownie/cakey texture... but these came out so yummy in their own right:)  Perfect... soft inside and crispier outside. yum.

These brownies were delicious; soft & chewy!!  I took the advice of others and doubled the recipe,  which I highly recommend.  These were so easy to prepare.  The only changes I made were omitted the nuts and didn't double the amount of chocolate chips.  I'm definitely going to be making these again soon!

I was really surprised at the amount of batter there was when I was done mixing the ingredients...there just didn't seem to be enough!  But I figured the brownies would rise so I baked it in the 9x9 pan as suggested...well, the brownies didn't rise.  They were very tasty but seemed more like a chocolate chip cookie cake than a pan of brownies!  My biggest complaint is that they stuck to the pan.  I used a pampered chef nonstick pan, which usually works well.  So I don't really know what the problem was...I followed the recipe as it said...so maybe it was just me?  But the taste was great, no compaints there!

I have always wanted a good Blonde Brownies recipe, and now I have found one, 
as it is very good, I added a little more nuts to it, as my family loves nuts in cookies.
But it was very good and very easy.

I made these, not knowing what to expect.  They were quite tasty.  Sort of like a thick Tollhouse cookie, but with the chips on the top instead.  I would like to try these with no chips, or butterscotch!  Yum!

Very quick, easy and addictive.  My only quibble is that is should be cooked at a lower temp for a little bit longer to prevent the tough edge / raw middle problem.  Otherwise, awsome treat!

Made this without chocolate chips, but substituted white chips and butterscotch chips.  


I doubled the recipe and baked for 40 minutes.  These turned out excellent, chewy and gooey, just the way I like them!  Yes, they are SWEET  and rich.. perfect with coffee or milk.  
Let them cool completely before cutting.
**I lined the pan with aluminum foil, then greased with shortening...the bars came out perfectly and clean up was 
super easy.

These were very good and I didn't even use chocolate chips! My husband thought they were a little greasy. To all those that said they are too sweet-DESSERTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SWEET!!!! If you don't like sweet things then don't make them!

If I see a recipe reviewed poorly by Naples, I usually stay away from it but I'm glad I didn't this time ;)  I just made a double batch using a 9x13 glass pan and it took only 25 minutes to cook.  Rather than use nuts (allergic to walnuts) I added extra chocolate chips.  I used M&Ms, chocolate chunks, and mini morsels and I mixed them right into the batter before baking.  I didn't even wait for them to cool before cutting them and removing them to a cooling rack so I could pack them up and ship them off to both of my sons who are currently attending MSU - GO SPARTANS!  I snuck one to try and holy cow, UBER DELISH!

After searching through many recipes I came across this one.  With so many great reviews, I just had to try this one. So glad I did! I've never been really big on deserts like this and was only gonna make these for my fiancé, but after sampling my work, we finished it all and I had to make more. I ended up making another double batch. I omitted the nuts bc my fiancé didn't want them in there. And I put in butterscotch chips (bc we love butterscotch and always have some in the house) instead of chocolate chips. I put some chips in the batter of the 1st batch and it turned out awesome. Then I put some on top of the 2nd batch and pushed them in slightly so I could spell out I ?? U! They were not only awesome, but my fiancé was extra sweet to me the rest of the night

Great recipe - I made the recipe exactly as written.  They were delicious...reminded me of a chocolate chip cookie in bar form.

Absolutely fan-freakin-tasktick blondies!   Great recipe... added 1/4 tsp almond extract, as I ran short on vanilla.  added a nice flavor, fwiw.   Thanks Ms Bush!

Great recipe! I didn't use near as much of the chocolate as called for (I actually used m&ms instead of chocolate chips), it just seemed like too much. Also, since I live in Italy right now (and a lot of the ingredients aren't available so I have to substitute) they didn't seem to ever cook on the inside, even though I left them in much longer than called for, but I don't think the original recipe is to blame (I think it was the brown sugar substitute). I still recommend it though! They were delicious either way.

This was a great recipe!  The only thing we changed was we added a little more vanilla. 1 and 1/2tablespoons should be good. Added the walnuts and it gives it a nice crunch. Added a lot of chocolate chips on the top. Would be good with m&ms as well. I look forward to making this again.

These turned out very good using a gluten free flour blend.  I have been trying to duplicate many recipes to gluten free.  Not an easy task.  These however did turn out just like the other commenters stated.  Doubled exactly for 9x 13 pan with exception of flour blend adding an additional 1/3 cup.  I also reduced amount of salt to half.  These are going in the Recipe Box.

When i finished with the batter it came out more like cookie dough. The chocolate got my pan so moldy. But it tasted ok! I had the idea of putting cinnimon on them before i put them in the oven! Delicous

Yum!  I followed advice - doubled the recipe and baked in 9x13.  I also only used a heaping cup of chocolate chips and felt it was enough. Kids loved them - though they said most kids would like them even better without the walnuts as kids generally don't like nuts in cookies. ;-)

Perhaps I have bad luck with blonde brownies, but I followed this recipe exactly and came out with a gooey, un-cooked brownie (I even cooked it 30 minutes). It tasted fine, but I guess I prefer something that turns out cooked.

The batter was so dry I ended up adding a 1/4 cup of milk to make it spreadable. The brownies managed to be sweet (NOT in a good way) AND bland all at the same time.  The top was almost overdone and the rest seemed undercooked. Tips if you still want to make this? Add 1/4 cup of milk. Use half the amount of brown sugar. Don't bother using vanilla, it doesn't need it. And maybe lower the heat to 325 and cook for 30 minutes.

I don't think I would call these blondies.  These are chocolate chip cookie bars.  I liked them but they weren't what I wanted.  They make a small pan and are best fresh from the oven.  If I wanted chocolate chip cookie bars, I would rather make the old Toll House recipe, I like those better.

Love this recipe. Have made it 2 times. Once without any add-ins and once with chocolate chips. Delish both ways. Can't decide which one is better. I didn't leave them in the oven for 45 minutes though. My oven runs hot so I took them out at about the 35 minute mark. They came out rich and chewy.

Oh..my..goodness. I will never bake a cookie again. This is so much easier to make and exactly the density I love.  The perfect compromise between a cookie and brownie.  I followed the recipe exactly (except mixing the chips in with the batter) and baked in a 8x8 and it turned out fine.

Not a favorite so probably wouldn't make again. Doubled recipe and had to cook longer (abt 30 minutes). Used only 1/2 cup chocolate chips and stirred them into batter per other recommendations.

While in the process of making these, my boyfriend insisted he would not be having any (he saw how much sugar and butter went into them). Later, he ate half the tray. These are quite good, and very moist. I couldn't tell you how well they hold up over time, because I made them yesterday and they are gone already! I mixed half the chocolate chips into the batter, and put the other half on top. I think they could have benefited from a little something extra, like almond extract or maple flavor, but other than that are very good.

Made this recipe based on all the positive reviews, but I have to go with the minority on this one.  Not very good.  Followed recipe exactly.  Mine cooked up alright, except the middle which was definitely undercooked.  Taste was bland.  Definitely not a brownie - more of a cookie.  Overall, disappointed.

Delicious!  This is a very fast and easy recipe that tastes delicious.  How fast?  I just found this recipe an hour ago and have now baked them and let them cool just long enough to sample one.  I suppose I better save some for my kids for after school! ;)

Doubled the recipe - only changes were to cut back butter and sugar - 1 stick (1/2 cup) butter and 1.5 cups brown sugar.  I mixed only 1 cup of chocolate chips in (our preference) to the batter.

I really enjoyed baking and eating these blondies! Absolutely superb! This was my first time to ever bake blondies and it turned out great! Don't even bother testing with a toothpick cuz it will never come out clean and you'll just end up with dry bricks! DON'T bake longer than 25 min! I doubled it for a 13x9. My husband is just raving about them! Will make again for Christmas get togethers! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Epic Brownies!!!! 
So I wanted to make brownies because I was craving them but realized I had no cocoa powder. I came upon this recipe by searching for the blonde version of brownies and this one looked the yummiest plus I had the ingredients. I wanted to make sure I had plenty so I doubled the recipe and it went really well. Soon as I tasted one of these tasty treats...I felt myself melt they were that good! These brownies are just as delicious and chewy yet soft with that thick fudge like feel as their chocolate counterparts. My boyfriend and our kids couldn't get enough of them. This recipe is one of my new favorite brownie recipes and I will be making them in the future.

I never thought I liked blondies until somebody brought them to a meeting I was in recently - they were still warm and a-mazing.
I went on a hunt to find a great recipe and I hit the jackpot with this one.  I was a little worried when I put it in the pan - it didn't spread out to all sides at first.  With some work, I spread it out, but it seemed quite thin.  Maybe that is normal, or maybe I somehow messed up the measurements, because I saw no other comments about that.  
Regardless, they turned out fantastic and they did fill the pan.
The only change I made was to mix the chocolate chips in so it was more like a cookie bar.  Next time, I may try to double the recipe but keep in the same size pan.
Thanks for the recipe!

I thought these were pretty good following the recipe, but I made changes the second time around. There is too much vanilla in this recipe, so I cut it in half and only used 1/2 tbsp. I used 1/4 cup white chocolate chips instead of chocolate chips and I used 1/4 cup coconut. I used pecans instead of walnuts. With these adjustments, they were outstanding!!! My husband and parents had both versions & preferred my remake.

If you love chewy chocolate chip cookies, this recipe is for you.  I make it all in one bowl though...first melt the butter, then stir in the brown sugar, followed by the vanilla and egg.  Then mix in the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt.  Finish by stirring in the nuts and chocolate chips (we like ours stirred in, not on top).  This consistently comes out perfectly, and we love them!

I accidentally only put in 1 tsp of vanilla and thought it was sweet enough, along with the brown sugar and butter, it was "melt in your mouth to die for!"  Thinking it might have been too sweet with the 1 T of vanilla?  Oh well, regardless of my error these turned out great and are fantastic and easy brownies to make!

Easy and delicious. Melted the butter in the microwave and only covered half the dish with the chocolate chips.  Both sides equally scrumptious.  Will make this often, I'm sure.

O.M.Gosh...These are the BEST blondies ever, hands down.  So simple yet so tastey.  I've made a single recipe & i've doubled it with no problems (just cooked it a bit longer.)  I may NEVER make chocolate chip cookies ever again.  The only thing i've done different than the recipe is i only add enough chocolate chips to just barely cover the top.  To be honest, i don't even think these blondies need them!  YUM!!!

Perfect chewy blondies! My husband wanted a crowd pleaser for his last day of work when he retired. This is the recipe he wanted me to make. I tripled it and made a half-sheet pan. Came out perfect. The person who said they were too guey must have cooked them just a bit less than they should have. I can tell they're done when there are sections on top that have popped up and become firm and a little shiny. For the triple recipe in a bigger pan I baked only about 5 minutes longer than recommended in recipe.

I love this recipe!  I love it because it's so easy!  I love the fact that you use melted butter and not softened because that way these can be whipped up in a jiffy with no planning.  I will definitely make these again!

This was AH-MAZING! My boyfried loves blonde brownie's from a certain restaurant so after a hard day at his job, I decided to bake him these (along with the Buttermilk Syrup recipe found on this site). I didn't tell him I made them; I let him think I stopped at the restaurant. When he ate it, he commented that they made an improvement to the dessert but he didn't know what. He said it was delicious....the best he's ever had! That's when I spilled the beans and said I made it from scratch!! 

I followed the reciped exactly, except for doubling it and using a 13x9 glass pan. It was soft and chewy on the inside and visually appealing ontop! I topped it with French vanilla ice cream and some freshly made buttermilk syrup...a total winner in the house!!!

You will NOT be disappointed by this recipe!!

So delicious!  I was at Ruby Tuesdays and you know how it goes...love their blondie's, but no room!  Anyway, followed the recipe, just doubled it and still put it in a 9X9.  However, forgot a big rule of baking-lower the heat and put it longer.  Center was still too gooey, but still good!  I'll definitely make it again!

WOW these were awesome, definitely a keeper!!!! I doubled the recipe, and added peanut butter chips instead! To DIE FOR!!!! If you like peanut butter, then you will like that! The PB chips, when they cook, they melt into the brownies, so you get that awesome PB taste!!! Something to look forward to when I'm bored!!!!!!

Fantastic recipe right here! I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet, though. Aside from that I stuck with the recipe. I baked for about 20-22 minutes but would have checked from 15-18 minutes instead for a mushier brownie texture.

I'm pretty sure I'm having altitude issues with my baking. This was so runny it wasn't edible, and I made it twice just to be sure I didn't do something wrong. However, I let it sit in the pan almost all day out of disgust and much to my surprise it firmed up and tasted out of this world good!! I will add more flour next time and see if that helps. With so many good reviews it has to be a problem with something other than the recipe.

These came out OK. They were kind of hard and a little dry for my liking. I usually like a softer brownie. Perhaps I overcooked them at 27 minutes for a double batch. And As another reviewer said, they became very hard in the fridge.

I doubled as most reviewers suggested and put in a 9x13 pan. I would suggest putting it in a little bigger pan. They were very good, but I think they would have been better a little thinner as they are pretty sweet.

This was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, except  I added a little more vanilla (my preference). All in all, out of all the blondies I've made, this is by far the best.

I will have to retry this recipe, they stuck to the pan, it was just not thick enough for the recommended pan and a bit too sweet for me. I am a baker by trade but, we all have our bad days, so I will re-post after the next batch. They did taste just like choco chip cookies...yummy but sweet!

Very yummy, and quick to thow together. I used apple sauce and just a tablespoon of olive oil instead of butter, used half cup agave and 1/4 cup Splenda brown sugar, used egg beaters and istead od chocolate, I tried butterscotch chips. Perfect dessert, especially with a scoop of ice cream!

These brownies were delicious! They were perfectly chewy! Because I didn't have chocolate chips, i decided to experiment.  Instead, once they were patially cooked I put a small bit of apple butter on the top. Once they were fully baked, the apple butter had swirled in and had resulted a perfect cinnamin brownie creation!

Perfect dessert if you don't like chocolate overload.  I like normal chocolate brownies, but I get sick to my stomach if there's too much chocolate.  This is perfect, and you can change what type of chips to use on top.  I thought Heath bar bits would be wonderful on top too.  I'll try that next time.  Great dessert, try it!

These were good, but really turned out to be a cookie cake - yummy, just not quite what I was expecting.  I didn't have nuts, so I added just shy of a cup of mini chocolate chips instead. I only used 1 tsp of vanilla as many other reviews did.  I usually like a lot of vanilla and will use 2 tsp in many of my cookie and cake recipes, but I can't imagine adding a full tablespoon, since this makes such as small batch.  Mine stuck to the pan, even with buttering first, so despite being tasty I'm not sure I'd make them again.

This is a nice, chewy, toll-house flavored bar.  I don’t usually use a lot of salt so, for me, the salt was a little aggressive and next time would reduce the amount by half the next time.

These were the exact texture I was looking for when I went in search of a recipe today. The flavor was almost perfect but I actually thought it fell a little flat and needs a bit more salt. Then I think they will be perfect.

I choose this recipe since it seemed to have the most positive reviews. Wow was I disappointed! Hubby liked them but he had never had blond brownies before. I made them exactly as the recipe called except only 1/2cup chocolate chips which were enough. If these had been in cookie form they probably would have rated better in my opinion.

OMG were these amazingly good. Just the way I love blondies; soft, chewy and gooey, if you don't overbake.  I baked in a glass 8x8 dish for 20 min and they came out perfect.  Am glad I only put chocolate chips on half the dough because unless you eat while still warm and gooey, the chocolate hardens and, for me, ruins the great brown sugary taste of this.  So for me, they're perfect without the chocolate.  Just a PERFECT blondie!  I could bake these every other day!

really excellent - my husband's coworkers devoured them. I used pecans instead of walnuts and mixed my chips in. I would recommend a light spray of the pan, as my sides wanted to stick. Next time I will double and bake in a 9x13.

I loved this recipe! It came out perfect, moist and chewy. Even the next day!
My family and friends loved it too! It didnt come out super sweet either.
Instead of adding nuts and 2 cups of chocolate, I added 1/2 cup of toffee, 1/2 cup white chocolate chips, and 1/2 cup butterscotch chips. I've been asked to make 3 dozens for a Christmas party already :) I totally recommend it.

Very delicious! I liked these more than the chocolate chip cookies I made last week. I would suggest doubling the recipe though to fit into the pan. I struggled covering all of the pan and the blondies ended up a little harder in texture and not as thick than I would have liked. 
Overall very yummy just double the recipe!

I think there must be a typo in the recipe - 1 tablespoon of Vanilla is WAY too much.  If it wasn't for that, they would have been good.  They are easy, so I will try it again using a much smaller amount of vanilla.

These were way too sweet, so next time I will definitely cut back on the sugar, maybe down to 1/2 cup or 2/3 cup.  And I like sweets too!

YUM YUM YUM.  Only changes I made was that I mixed the chocolate chips in with the rest rather than sprinkling on top.  I also cooked them in an 8x8 pan.  Took about ten minutes longer to bake but turned out great.  A helpful hint is to let them completely cool before cutting and serving as if not they don't hold together.  Great recipe.  Thank you

OMG this is the best dessert EVER.  Just tried this recipe for the first time tonight.  Only difference is I mixed the chips in instead of put them on top.  Highly recommended.

I wanted to bake a quick and easy dessert for my family on a recent weeknight, but didn't have any white sugar. I came across this recipe & decided to give it a try since it was rated so highly & had such outstanding reviews. My family & I absolutely loved them! The recipe listed only makes an 8x8 pan though, so next time I will be doubling it. I will also use slightly less chocolate chips, as I felt there were a few too many in this recipe, though that is just my own personal taste. I liked the recipe so much that I have made a few customized versions as well. I replaced the choc chips with white chocolate morsels & substituted macadamia nuts for the walnuts. Took the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Blondies to a recent function & everybody went crazy over them. For my daughters class, I made another custom version & replaced the choc chips with M&M's & skipped the nuts. This also was very good & colorful. Next, I will be trying a Reese cup version. I highly recommend this recipe.

OMG -- delicious! Reminded me of a TollHouse cookie pie, but this time, I made it myself. Looking forward to trying variations on this as far as toppings go (maybe other kinds of chips) and bringing it to holiday parties. I know if there's any left over, it's something that I'm sure would freeze well too. My favorite part is that the ingredients are basic and they're all ones I keep on hand. Thanks Sue!!!

This was pretty good, though my own modifications to it (a layer of coconut and more milk chocolate chips) was probably over the top.  I'm looking forward to trying it straight up next time!

These are soooooooo good and easy!! Instead of a 9x9 I used a 8x8 which was perfect.  I think the 9x9 would have made them to thin.  I mixed some chocolate chips in and added the rest on top.  Amazing!  Would make a really good brownie sundae too. Enjoy!

I liked this recipe.  I used self-rising flour instead of adding the baking powder. soda, and salt.  I also decided to do something a little different.  Instead of using walnuts I used cashew butter.  It made it really chewy which was very nice.

The only thing I would add is to make sure you spray your baking dish before baking.  Other than that it was really really good!

I didn't have chocoalte chips, which is why I was looking for a blondie recipe in the first place. So, I made this  with walnuts and it was really good. I have made it several more times and even doubled the recipe and it has come out consistant even when doubled. This is a keeper!

These were ok it was my friend's fault though, she  subsituted almond extract instead of vanilla, because we were out. Lesson learned: almond extract is WAAAYYYYYYY stronger in flavor that vanilla extract! The entire tray tasted like almond extract! They were still good besides that fact though. I bet they would be delicious if she had know better.

Perfect, no need to change the recipe in any way EXCEPT I agree that mixing the chocolate chips [instead of spreading them on top] is the way to go.

Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly (except for the walnuts, but that is more preference), and they came out chewy, sweet, and wonderful. For anyone who's making them, they did take closer to 30 minutes to bake, but they were worth the wait!

MASSIVE HIT!
Finished in less than an hour by 6 people.
Wouldn't change a thing.
Baked in an 8x8 glass dish and took out after 23 mins but put back in for another 5 mins.

These brownies are AWESOME!  The only thing I changed was using M&Ms on top instead of chocolate chips, which works great too.  They were a huge hit and I will definitely make this recipe again!

YUMMY!  I made this as a Father's Day treat and needless to say it was DEVOURED by my 3 boys, my hubby (and I may have stolen a couple of pieces)!!  I left out the walnuts as we prefer them without and decided to mix the choc chips right into the batter instead of just placing them on the top.  My husband said these are definitely deserving of a 6...these are right up his alley!

Kept the recipe exactly the same, except I mixed the chips IN to the batter, and doubled it to make a 13x9" pan. Very tasty. I don't know if it's the BEST I've ever tasted, but it's close. And extra points for being so simple. I love recipes that don't require my mixer!

I have not made these yet, BUT i have a similar recipe except they are peanut butter brownies.  I'm not all that satisfied with them!  So i think i might try this one, but add some peanut butter.  After all the rave reviews i bet this will be fantastic!

Pretty Good! We didnt sift flour and came out just fine. They only make a small amount though....9X9, if you want a bunch double the recipe. Tasted kinda like a chocolate chip cookie, very basic and good. Stayed soft as well!

Great Blondes! I mixed the chocolate chips directly into the batter and baked them for the extra 10 minutes as suggested in previous reviews and they came out soft and fully cooked. Also, this is definitely a rich sweet blonde (most recipes call for half the brown sugar) and I love it for that very reason!

Followed the recipe sans the walnuts. Also mixed in 1/2 c choco chips into batter instead of sprinkling them onto the top. Coated an 8x8 pan with cooking spray to prevent the brownie from sticking onto the pan. It was super easy to make, but wow was it ever so sweet! In terms of texture, it was definitely a cross between a brownie and a cake...but more cake. Next time I'll scale back on the brown sugar and the baking powder, and see how that fares.

These taste great but they're not a blondie to me as much as a big chocolate chip cookie.  I mixed these up in 5 minutes and didn't add the extra chocolate chips on top since 2/3 cup was enough for me.  I had to bake them a little longer and I greased the pan and they still stuck to the pan but they were really good.  Next time I have a chocolate chip cookie craving and don't want to make cookies I will make these for ease of preparation.

OMG these were wonderful!! I did try it with white chocolate chips instead of regular, and they were FANTASTIC. Definitely a keeper! (And try the white chocolate chips as a variation- you can really taste the blondie part without the chocolate overpowering it!

These were just "okay" for me. I didn't add the chocolate chips (trying to go for a purist blondie) but ended up with something lacking punch. Maybe the chocolate chips will do it, but I have a feeling not.

Super duper yummy! Surprisingly, though, I prefer mine without any chocolate chips at all, as I feel they somewhat overpower the taste of the actual blondie.

In the future, if I were going to add the chocolate chips in, I'd drop the blondie dough by spoonfuls onto a cookie sheet and bake them that way, instead --- I think they'd be an even bigger hit presented as an extra moist chocolate chip cookie, as opposed to simply a pan of blondies!

These were fine, but nothing special.  There was so much brown sugar that even after mixing it very well and baking it, I could still taste the graininess of the brown sugar.  And I love brown sugar!  But it just seemed that there was an ingredient missing or something off about this recipe.

These are amazing! The texture is perfect. I did as others suggested and doubled the recipe, using the 9X13 pan. I also left out the nuts and substituted butterscotch chips, mixing them into the batter. I am going to call these Butterscotch Blondies. Good thing I am taking them to work tomorrow, or I would eat ALL OF THEM!

These were a BIG hit with everyone that ate them! The only things I did outside the recipe: I double it, didn't add the walnuts (none on hand) and mixed in the chocolate chips. I also sprayed the pan (13x9 for double recipe) even though it didn't say one way or the other. These have been added to the make over and over category. Thanks. =)

These were so-so.  I was expecting them to be superb but they tasted like standard chocolate chip bars.  I made them without the walnuts and maybe that is why they tasted plain, like they were missing something even with all that chocolate.  I think they could have used a tad bit more salt or baking soda to cut the blandness.

These are pretty amazing - I baked them up one night I was craving something sweet. I took out the nuts because I didn't have any on hand, and added about 3/4 cup chocolate chips and about 1/3 cup white chocolate chips into the batter. The batter itself was super thick, and I thought I'd missed some liquid ingredient, but I read it over sever times, and it was right. Something else I noticed is that these brownies don't do a huge amount of rising in the oven- that's probably why they are so dense and rich. I also had to use about a 1/4 cup of white sugar with the brown, as I ran out of brown most of the way through - they still taste wonderful.

This is a nice change from regular brownies. In fact I may like them more. I omitted the salt and the walnuts, and actually added the chocolate chips to the batter.  I added more chocolate chips than what is called for since we like our desserts chocolately!! Very good!

YUM! these turned on perfect! I subsituted the chopped walnuts with slivered almonds, and that turned out great!  My family always fought for the corner brownies, so as a joke I got The Perfect Brownie Pan, 20 mins. was perfect for baking-I used the exact recipe.  To add to it I top it with slivered almonds as when adding the chocolate chips. It was a nice touch. I promise you will enjoy this recipe!

So I followed these exactly and they were so good. It tastes like the chocolate chip paradise pie at Chili's. I made them for my parents tonight also and had it warm with ice cream. So good.

Delicious!!!! I baked them for exactly 20 minutes and they were perfect. I didn't change anything, except I did not add nuts becase of an allergy, but i think red and green mnm's would be cute!!

These are pretty darn good - very similar to my go-to recipe.  These brownies are very quick to simply stir together with a spoon and taste even better the next day - chewy, moist and addictive.  Overall, I think I prefer my recipe which has two eggs, a full stick of butter, and I usually use white whole wheat flour.  When using that flour, I try to resist cutting them for at least 12 hours to give the flour time to soften and meld into deliciousness.

These are the best brownies I have ever eaten. Only thing different we did is use white chocolate chips instead of the semi sweat and mixed them in instead of topping (to give it a more applebee's blondie feel...) Baked them during the day and after dinner popped one in the microwave to heat it up a little. Put a scoop of vanilla ice cream and topped with a simple maple walnut sauce. Needless to say I went back for another round. Will keep this recipe in my arsenal for sure.

These brownies are incredible. A few years ago I had these type of brownies at a school function and have been searching for a recipe that I liked. i have tried a bunch and they just werent right.This recipe is what I have been searching for. I have only had the recipe for a week and have made them twice for my family, once for a bakesale and for my brownie troop.

These were awesome. My husband ate almost the whole pan! I doubled the recipe so that I could use a 9x13 glass pan. I incorporated the choc chips in the batter, and topped half the pan with walnuts. I also did not double the baking powder and baking soda. The only thing I will change next time, would be not to buy the cheap chocolate chips! GREAT RECIPE THIS IS A KEEPER!

very good! I left out the walnuts because of personal preference.  I also mixed the ch chips in instead of just on top, but I think they would be great either way!

Very good!  Followed the recipe to a T.  The only difference was I use an 9x9 pan and let them cook about 3 minutes longer since they didnt seem done.  We put a scoop of ice cream on top and it was perfect!

SO GOOD and simple, too!  I followed the recipe closely with the exceptions of using pecans instead of walnuts and mixing the chocolate chips into the batter.  I had to bake mine for 30 minutes. They cut and lifted out of the pan easily (I did spray my pan first).  The blondies are good by themselves or with hot caramel sauce drizzled on top.  This recipe goes right into my favorites-- thanks!

this was so good and easy.  i did not bother to sift the flour as i was in a hurry.  perhaps it would have risen more?  i made it in a 9" pie pan and served wedges of the blondie with the caramel macchiato ice cream recipe from this site.  perfect combination and rave reviews from my guests!

This was great, but it is not a brownie texture, it was just like a moist chocolate chip cookie. I would use this recipe to make cookies...so still on the hunt for a real blonde brownie recipe. Also, you need to double the recipe, otherwise it is quite small...but perfect for 2 people :)

This tastes great but the consistency and turnout wasn't the best.  The bars were really flat and while they looked and felt done on the outside, once they cooled and I cut into them they were undercooked on the inside.  Now this isn't huge problem, as I'd much prefer underdone and gooey then overdone and hard, but I think next time I make these I will do some experimenting with the baking time, as well as possibly adding in some marshmallows.  Overall, great taste though! P.S. I only used 1 tsp vanilla.  1 tbsp seemed like way too much!

Yum, yum, yum!!! This recipe is splendid! I did what a lot of other reviewers did, doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 inch baking dish. I'm not a chocolate fan so I used butterscotch morsels and I did not have walnuts so I omitted those too. I can't wait until christmas time, this recipe will be part of my gift baskets! Thanks for sharing!

Very moist and easy to make.  Love the use of melted butter since I always forget to bring butter to room temp.  I doubled the recipe and used 3/4 cup each of dark and brown sugar.  Then added a 12 oz bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and about a cup of chopped nuts.  They were still sweet enough.  For my own taste I'd probably reduce to 2/3 cup eacb of dark and light sugar if doubling but I almost always reduce the amount of sugar in cookie and bar recipes.  Will definitely make these bars again.

Good recipe. I cut it in half to make a small desert and I think the pan I used was too small. It started crusting and getting dark on the outside while the middle was still SUPER gooey. So we just ate the outside. Well the following morning when I got up, the middle was the BEST breakfast ever!! Very good left over’s.

These are melt in your mouth delicious.  I doubled the recipe and baked in 9x13.  Otherwise I followed the recipe (except for the sifting - I never sift).  They are amazing and very easy.

This was the perfect treat for my husband and I. It was on the rich side, but that's what we were looking for.  I loved the chewiness of the crust and the soft (and a little bit gooey) center. I mixed half of the chocolate chips into the batter, and sprinkled the other half on top.

Made this recipe today and they are outstanding!  I doubled it and baked in a 9 x 13 pan for about 28 minutes and they're perfect.  This one's a keeper!

Not sure what I was expecting? found them to be a little bland but my Garden Club group loved them and asked me to make them again. Will try again just too make sure I didn't screw up.

Excellent!  Buttery and chewy...just what I was looking for in a blondie. I doubled the vanilla(which I do in all recipes I use it in), nixed the nuts as my family does not like them. In follow up batches I added a little almond extract and dried cherries. My husband requested chocolate chips as an addition...very, very good.  This recipe is very accomodating to the addition of personal preferences...

I had been looking for a blondie recipe for a long time.   This one is perfect!  It has a chewy texture and is studded with choc chips.  ( I mix them in and sprinkle the nuts on top-then the nuts get a bit toasted).  Thanks!

These were really good but for some reason mine were way undercooked even though I baked them on the same temp. and time the recipe stated. Mine needed to go an extra 10 mins. I would make these again but next time I'll make sure to cook them longer. There is also a recipe on here for almost this exact same thing but using a yellow cake mix... those are easier than this one and taste just as good.

Delicious. :] I made a couple changes. I doubled the recipe except for the salt and baking powder and left out the walnuts. I also substituted almond extract for the vanilla - I used 1.5 tablespoons of almond extract, but the flavor was a bit strong and next time I'd go down to one.

Wow - these are addicting!  I was looking for a recipe to use up the 3/4C of chocolate chips that I had left from another recipe.  (Now I'm going to have to buy more chips... )  I used margarine instead of butter to make these bars more chewy than crunchy, and I only used 1 tsp of vanilla, rather than the 1 tbsp shown in the recipe.  They are wonderful!

Love this one!  I doubled this and used a 9 x 13 pan, and it came out great!  Nice, chewy consistency.  I left the chocolate and nuts out because of allergies, (yes,  chocolate allergy), and was so happy to find that it was fabulous!  It may be a little bland for some, but heaven to someone that has been craving a brownie-type dessert, without the chocolate.  Hooray!

Very easy to make, in fact no need to drag out the mixer.  I used chopped cashews in lieu of walnuts, and used about 1/3 cup of whole wheat, because in sweet baked goods you can do this without ruining the flavor. Perfect moistness, with a little firmness.

Doubled recipe and put in 9x13" pan.  Used 1 cup choco chips and 2/3 cup peanutbutter chips, 1/2 mixed into batter and 1/2 on top, no nuts.  Too sweet and crunchy (w/out overbaking).  And probably too much vanilla.  Otherwise, very easy.  Will look for better recipe.

Waaaaaaaaaay too sweet!! Sugar should be toned down to maybe little more than half the amount. As the recipe stands, the blondies won't even solidify at all in the center. I tried baking an extra ten minutes too, but it just stays goopy. I have a feeling the author didn't measure the flour properly by the scoop and leveling off with a knife method.

These really were delicious. I doubled the recipe and baked in 9x13 pan. I also put the chips IN the batter and not on top.

This is a great recipe and I have been looking for a chewy, rich blondie recipe for a while. One tip...if you double the recipe, the baking time is closer to 30-35 minutes to get it done (but still plenty gooey). I doubled the recipe and put chocolate chips on one half and butterscotch ships on the other half. Excellent!!

Another rave review here...  These are really delicious.  As suggested, I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did. They're nice and sweet with just a hint of saltiness to compliment the chocolate.  I used slightly less chocolate chips (1 cup for the doubled recipe), and omitted the nuts.  I also wasn't sure if I should grease the pan, but used some non-stick cooking spray just to be safe.  They're great served warm with ice cream, but I think I like them even better on their own.  Delicious!

LOVE THIS!!!  These are a new favorite at my house.  I've made them three times in the last week, and had rave reviews every time.  I mix the chocolate chips in like several others who have reviewed it, and bake them in a 9x13 pan.  A small square pan doesn't last long in a family of 6.  These are super quick and easy, and delicious.  I also sub butter flavored shortening for the butter, which makes them a little fluffier.  FABULOUS!!

I was very disappointed in these blondies. I've never made blondies before and all the reviews on this one sounded so great. I followed the recipe exactly (minus salt) but used an 8x8 pan. They took almost an hour to bake. I did like how chewy they were. They weren't sweet enough though. My husband liked them. If I do make them again, I will add regular sugar to help sweeten them up. I forgot to cover them up last night and tried a piece this morning and they were still chewy, so that's a plus!

definitely double the recipe for a party -- they go fast.  using wheat flour mixed with regular unbleached flour seemed to thicken up the batter to a better consistency

GREAT! This recipe is wonderful as is. If you mix in the choc chips, they become harder to cut (if you can't wait until they cool). I sprinkle them on top.

This recipe seems very promising.  I used Green & Black chocolate bars, a mix of 1 dark and 2 35%.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, upped the salt a tad.  It smells like heaven!!!  It's for a charity bakesale this afternoon.  I will try to resist. :-)  Back with details on the taste.

This recipe was great the first time out for me. Even though I didn't melt the butter (will know better next time--trying to cream cold butter with sugar? Never again) they came out fabulous! I doubled the recipe, used at 9x13 pan, skipped the chocolate chips (wanted a real "vanilla brownie" taste) and baked them for 35 minutes. I'll be using this one again.

Used heath chips instead of chocolate chips and mixed them in with the batter instead of the top.  A little rich for my taste, but still good.

As other reviewers state, this is definitely a bar cookie as opposed to a blonde brownie.  However, knowing this, it's a great, EASY recipe.  I omitted the nuts and doubled the recipe, using oil (1/2 cup) instead of butter.  Prep took hardly any time at all, and I baked in a 9x13 pan for 35 min.  They're fantastic! (P.S. I think the overly salty taste described by other reviewers may come from salted butter.  I cut the salt in half at first, then ended up adding more.)  Thanks for a quick treat!

I did not sift the flour, and I used butter that was room temperature rather than melting. I continually checked after 20 minutes, and kept thinking they were going to burn, as the outside was already so crispy, but the inside was still gooey. So I left them in, and they never did burn... the insides stay gooey even after cooled but its ok! crispy outside, gooey inside, its a good combo. I left the chocolate chips on top rather than mixing them in, and this leaves a nice effect for presentation.

These are fabulous.  Next time, I'll half the salt because the saltiness is the first thing that registers on my mind, kind of like eating a chocolate covered pretzel.  I melted the butter in a pot on low, stirred in the sugar, and set it aside to cool before adding the egg.  I added the dry ingredients right in the pot so I only had one thing to wash. Baked in an 8x8 for 30 minutes.  Use a toothpick to test them.  A knife will make them sink. Don't mess with the baking soda and the baking powder; you can't taste them at all.  They bake up high and then sink a bit at the end.  Super chewy texture!

I'm giving these three stars because I've made them about 5 times and they always disappoint me.  They don't have a whole lot of flavor (just taste like sugar) and they aren't very fluffy.  My husband loves the chewy texture but I think they should be fluffier.  They just never seem as good as I hope.  Kind-of a let down and I wish I could find a better recipe for Blondies.

After seeing all the wonderful looking pictures of this recipe I SO BADLY wanted mine to come out that good. Sadly they didn't even come close. I doubled the recipe and used splenda brown sugar. Those are the only 2 changes I made. After 15 minutes the brownies looked done, I took them out and they were stiff, crumbly, and just not that good. I am at a higher altitude, so I'm guessing that was part of the problem. Still disappointing.

Great brownies, they ended up a touch dry but that may have been me overcooking them a few minutes.  Make sure you mix the brown sugar mix into the eggs slowly.  If my little sister hadn't been with me i would have had some sugary scrambled eggs.

These were fantastic....coming from a true bake-a-holic. The hubby and son raved about them.  This recipe is a total keeper. I would suggest using greased parchment paper for ease with removal from pan. Go easy on chocolate chips, 1 cup is way way too much, will try using 3/4 cup and maybe back to 1/2 cup if necessary after that.

These blondes are amazing! I was trying to find a recipe like the one that a 2nd grade teacher made. These were just as good if not better! I put added chocolate chips in the inside and omitted the walnuts. They turned out wonderful.

I followed the recipe exactly but did not combine them in the order of the recipe and they seemed more like a cake than a chewy brownie, must have done something wrong, I am going to give it another shot tonight but I added a cup of chunky peanut butter to the batter and I didn't have brown suger so I used a trick I learned years ago (***tip - 1 cup granulated sugar and tbsp molassess for light brown sugar or 3 for dark brown)and used my homeamde brown sugar.  Lets see if they turn out.  Good basis for a recipe though, I think it was the way I combined the ingrediants. I did it the way it said this time :)

This recipe didn't turn out for me at all, but I only had dark brown super on hand and that could have been the culprit! Also this recipe called for 1/2 teaspoon of salt when others called for an 1/8........I did double the recipe as I have some in my family who won't eat nuts, which I love nuts, so I have to make them with and without........My best guess is don't use dark brown sugar!

This was so easy to make and gave such yummy returns!  My kids all loved it and enjoyed creating their ideas of what they would add to the batter to create their own signature "Blonde Brownie".    We've made it several times now and each time without fail they came out perfectly- no matter what each child chose to add when it was their turn to create a signature rendition.  Every Pan was met with anticipation that was not left wanting.   Don't forget a tall glass of ice cold milk!   We'll make it again and again and again!  NOTE: The batch is small and goes fast - you might want to double it and use a regular size rectangle cake pan.

Really good, but not as moist as I would have liked.  I doubled the recipe so next time I'll bake less time.  That should do it.

Not impressed, not turned off. It's ok. But if I'm going to go through the trouble of baking something from scratch - it is better off a true brownie.

These turned out really well.  I did double the recipe and put it in a 9 x 13 pan and increased the cooking time by about 5-10 minutes.  I also added some extra chocolate chips and mixed them all into the batter.  Pretty easy and will definitely make again.  I've also made these with white chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chocolate and they're great too!

oh.my.goodness.I don't usually have the time to rate a recipe, but I have to say, that this recipe is perfection. I have made it both with and without the nuts. Without is by far my favorite. Oooey, Gooey, Yummy, goodness. I used chocolate chip chunks, about 3/4 cup, and mixed them into the dough. 8x8 square pan fits perfectly for this recipe. 25 minutes, and it is exactly perfect. Thank you so much!

Very good recipe for company.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 16 x 11 cookie sheet.  Used 1 1/4 cups chocolate chips and baked for 20 min.  Excellent served warm with vanilla ice cream.

These are one of the richest desserts I've ever made.  I baked them in a round cake pan and served them as wedges.  I always throw in extra chocolate chips, not necessary with this recipe!

Loved it, took them to a pot luck and they plate was licked clean.  It was the first time making them and was not sure what to look for when done baking.  The middle still seemed gooy after 20 minutes so I cooked longer and realized it should look gooy but it was still done.

Okay, I like my sweets but this was just average at best.  I was worried because the batter was 'gooey' almost and then in the pan it was a pretty thin layer (I used an 8x8 and the original was to be 9x9).  I baked it 25 minutes and the outside was done but the center was just barely set enough to take out.  It looked great, but taste-wise it was just not what I was expecting; the only good thing about it was the chocolate chips- the 'brownie' itself was more like a 2 star.  It was chewy (in a caramel way) which I didn't enjoy either.    I was really disappointed since I read so many rave reviews but unfortunately I have to agree with the 3-star and under reviewers, and I rarely give a bad review.  Sorry.  ***Sidenote: I made with half brown sugar and half granulated sugar and I thought it was much better.  Because of that it was a combination of this original recipe and a chocolate chip bar cookie.  (a 4 star with the change).  It is obvious using all brown sugar is why I did not care for it before.

Very delicious and easy to make. I too doubled the recipe. The differences I made was I added 1 3/4 cups packed brown sugar instead of the 2 cups, I added milk chocolate chips along with the semisweet chips. As other reviewers suggested I added the chips & nuts into the mixture, I prefer it that way. Next time I plan to add some coconut. A perfect Blondie recipe, a keeper for me, will make again!

These are wonderful.  This is the same recipe I have used for years, but on the vanilla, my recipe calls for 1 tsp, not 1 Tbsp. I also mix the chips in rather than sprinkling on top.

Great recipe.  I followed advice of other reviewers and mixed chips into the batter in order to have them distributed throughout the blondie.    I was out of walnuts and used pecans which worked well. I found the salt a bit noticable. I have a second batch in the oven (since the first went so quickly) I reduced salt to 75% of original amt.

I made this recipe as posted except I baked in an 8 x 8 glass pan for 30 minutes.  It was chewy and moist; however the vanilla was overpowering and I like vanilla!  I think recipe should read one TEASPOON vanilla. Also, I would cut salt back to 1/4 teaspoon.  Otherwise, a very good blondie.  I will make again with the changes I indicated.  It would be good with other chips, coconut, &/or nuts added to the chips topping when baking.

These are the absolute best blonde brownies I have ever made!! I almost doubled the recipe and pressed the mixture into a 10 x 15 sponge cake pan. They came out incredibly chewy. Here's how: 2 c. flour, 1/2 tsp. baking powder, 1/8 tsp. baking soda, 2/3 c. butter/margarine ( I used Smart Balance), 1 & 3/4 c. packed brown sugar, 1/4 c. Egg Beaters, 1 & 1/2 Tbsp. vanilla. I omitted the chocolate chips. I usually like to add nuts to my brownies, but didn't this one time. Baked for about 20 minutes. Watch, as the dough can quickly brown. I'm sticking with this recipe from now on!!

I made this the other day for a football party and everyone loved them!! I had to substitute the walnuts for almonds, but they turned our fabulous anyway.  I also doubled the recipe and cooked for approx. 10-15 minutes more to set the center.  Great recipe!!!

This recipe was good, but I ran into a couple issues: One, there was WAY too much vanilla extract.  I tasted the batter before I cooked it, and already it was very alcoholic tasting from the extract and tasted that way even after baking.  I'm not a fan of a very strong alcohol taste in my brownies.  Second, they took forever to bake.  My oven is not even two years old, so I know it's not the oven. The recipe calls for a bake time of 20-25 minutes; 45 minutes later, the brownies were still runny on the inside. I had to keep them in about an hour.

Other than that, it was a decent recipe.  Just watch your vanilla!  Definitely taste the batter before adding the entire amount called for.

Delicious! I just tried one, 30 minutes out of the oven, and it was great! However, when finishing the batter, I added the chocolate chips and it looked like way too many, so I only used 1/2 cup. I also did not use walnuts (kids don't like them). Next time I'll make sure I use at least the recommended 2/3 cups maybe a few more. This recipe was not too sweet or too rich, and I could see how some might want this as a cookie recipe.

When doubled and cooked in a 13 X 9 inch pan (needed an additional 5-7 min), this makes a wonderfully thick and chewy bar. Has a very thin crisp shell on top, almost meringue-like. I don't add anywhere need the requested chocolate chips. When I double the recipe, I don't add more than 3/4 cup choc chips. The first time I made these I used 1 cup and in the top first 2 inches of bar there were lots of places where chocolate chips only touched each other -- no bar. Pretty sweet as it is (same amount of sugar as flour), the requested amount of chocolate is over the top sweet.

Although this is an easy and very few ingredient recipe, it cannot compare to my Congo Bar recipe. Might have been my mistake but I used self-rising flour (minus the baking powder/soda and salt) and it came out cake-like rather than chewy and gooey. Does it make a difference using self-rising flour? The edges were done in about 15 mins, however the center was still somewhat raw. I let it cook for another 5-7 mins only to have a dry, cake-like texture. I am willing to try this again with all-purpose flour with hopes that I won't be disappointed, AGAIN.

This was awesome.  Everyone thought they were cookie bars, but whatever!  Next time I will let them cool off at least an hour before I take them anywhere. Living and learning still apparently. :)

Finally, a recipe I can rely on!

I'm a pretty good baker, for a guy.  I know enough anyway.  I can pretty much bake everything, except cookies.

For the last month or so, I've been stuck on making chocolate chip cookies.  

I've tried the "famous" Toll House recipe to no avail.  They were either over-done, raw in the center, or came out flat and crispy.  

I've even tried to cut the recipe in half since I live alone and couldn't possibly eat a 13x9 pan to myself (I always prefer the pan cookie to round ones).  I failed every single time, even though my oven had been calibrated using an oven thermometer.

I was pretty much convinced that I would never be able to make cookies, and would be stuck buying ready-made cookies.

Not anymore.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and baked them in an 8x8 aluminum baking dish and they were perfect.

I realize this is a Blondie recipe, but if you omit the nuts and use chocolate chips it doubles perfectly as a cookie base, too.

I was pretty skeptical about using baking powder with such a small amount of baking soda, but it really will make the a difference if you take the time to measure out 1/8 teaspoon.


I added the wet ingredients into the sifted dry ingredients all at once, mixing just until everything was combined to avoid over mixing so that the final product wouldn't be tough from developing too much of the gluten.

Didn't chill the batter either before baking.  This recipe is great.

I had a craving for something sweet and decided to give this recipe a try. I'm glad that I did it hit the spot. I didn't change anything and it came out moist and perfect. I usually make a big pan of blonde brownies, but this was a perfect size for us. Thanks for the post!

These turned out so good.  Like another user, I mixed the chocolate chips right in with the batter.  I used the swirl chips in my first batch.  Next time, I will try using all white morsels.  Very rich and great right out of the oven!!

oh geez these things will be the death of me! i can't stop eating them. I followed the recipe exactly and the since I had so much left over halloween candy, I sprinkled some m&ms, chopped up kitkats and snicker bars at the top along with the chocolate chips. Oh, and I also used cashews instead of walnuts. The only change i will make next time is that I'll mix in chocolate chips into the dough before baking for an even chocolatier experience. DELISH!

This is better than my mom's recipe! I doubled it for 13x9 pan at 325 in my convection oven for 28 minutes. I used less salt and wished I hadn't...it needs more, so I'd go with the suggested salt amount next time.

The perfect Blondie recipe as is.  Played with the recipe this time and left out the walnuts and substituted flaked coconut and used orange extract instead of vanilla.  Doubled the recipe and mixed in the chocolate chips as usual...Delicious.  I brought them to work and they were gone in a flash.

Really nice recipe! So easy and simple. Seems like the best recipes are the most simple and uncomplicated. My blondies came out kind of thin so I think next time I'll double the recipe. I also might throw in half butterscotch chips, half chocolate because I really wanted that butterscotch-y flavor and this recipe came out more like chocolate chip bar cookies. Still delicious and I'll surely keep this one in my recipe box! Thanks for sharing!

Yum! These are sooo good! I only slightly changed the recipe by adding choc. chips to the batter and then sprinkling a few on top. Because of the kids, I only added nuts to the top of the grown-up half. I used 2 egg whites but kept everything else as instructed in the recipe. Then I lightly sprayed the baking dish with Pam. Once baked I let it cool for about 23 mins, it was still warm but not unmanagable to cut. After having made it there's nothing else that I would change for next time. Some reviewers complained about the vanilla, butter and baking soda, but it was a perfect combo for me. I will be making these again for sure!

These are amazing - chewy and dense - a hybrid between a chocolate chip cookie and a brownie. Super rich. I added 1/2 the chips in the batter and half on top.

These were very good!  I did make a few changes.  I doubled and used and 9x13 pan. I used margarine and 1 1/2 C brown sugar and 1/2 C white sugar, mini chips and only about 3/4 C.  This is a keeper!

Excellent recipe as written!  
Try mixing in any kind of candy chip (chocolate or butterscotch or white chocolate or vanilla or mint or M&M's or anything else you can think of!)
Also, try drizzling caramel on top before (or after) baking.

I doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 pan.  This made an awesome "cookie cake" for my husband who prefers cookie bar type desserts over regular cake.  This may be his new birthday tradition.  Everyone loved them.  Beware - they're very rich!

I'm not a huge fan of "blondies" but this recipe was really, really good. The only thing I changed was substituting miniature M&M's for the chocolate chips (we didn't have any).  Definitely a keeper.  Oh -- it's important to use butter; the buttery taste is this recipe's strong point.

YUMMM!!!! I didn't add walnuts because my husband doesn't like them.. they were still delicious! I mixed about half a cup of chocolate chips in the batter and then put a cup on top. I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 dish for about 28 minutes! Do yourself a favor and make these!

This was a great recipe!  I doubled everything except for the baking powder and the salt.  I also used a whole bag of chocolate chips mixing most in the batter then sprinkling the rest on the top. I've already had to make another batch the next day for my mom and sister!

Quite tasty, and super easy to make.  The brown sugar really keeps them chewy and adds a really nice flavor.

Seriously good.  Was looking for a blonde brownie recipe to rival my mother in law's.  This is it!  Came out perfect at 25 minutes.  My only change was to mix in chips, but otherwise didn't change the recipe at all.  I will say even better the next day--if you don't let them cool, they are too gooey.  I like more of hardened brownie.  YUM!

This was great. Cooked up quickly and easily!  Instead of the nuts, I put 1/2 cup of chocolate chips (semi-sweet) into the batter.  Then on top instead of sprinkling with chocolate chips I used Skor bits.  Really yummy and very sweet.  Four of us devoured the tray.  I made the quantities as per the recipe and it was the perfect amount for over-indulging 4 people...could have been sufficient for six (as the recipe stated).

I also ran out of brown sugar. I only had 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar so I topped it up to 1 cup with white sugar and I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of molasses. This worked out fine as a substition.

These were yummy! I didn't really know what to expect for a flavor, because I've never had blondies before, but they're really good. I wanted to make brownies for our superbowl party, but one of our guests is allergic to chocolate so this was a really great alternative! I followed other reviewers suggestions and only used a teaspoon of vanilla and use a scant 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder. I also OMITTED THE CHOCOLATE CHIPS and used pecans instead of walnuts. YUM! Highly recommended.

These are really good! I baked in a 8x8 pan for around 25 minutes, and they were definitely done. I added butterscotch chips along with the chocolate chips in the batter. Next time, will leave out the butterscotch chips and use less vanilla. Thanks!

These are fantastic!!! I made them for my office for the ones that are not fond of all chocolate and they loved these. They were very moist, even the day after. A few people microwaved them and quoted them as "out of this world." I also doubled it in a 9 x 13, but kept everything else exactly the same.

I made these for the people I work with to celebrate National Blonde Brownie Day (January 22).  They were a huge hit.  I made a double recipe without nuts and I also used both butterscotch & chocolate chips.  I didn't use all of the vanilla and I thought they tasted perfect.  I'll be bringing the recipe to share tomorrow.  Thanks!

This is a really awesome recipe...easy and delicious!  I also doubled the recipe (didn't double vanilla and salt as recommended) and baked in my Emile Henry 9x13 - I also added a few tablespoons of extra flour since it looked like it might turn out a little too gooey for me.  I also added a couple handfuls of choc chips into the batter after it cooled down - then topped with another couple handfuls before putting in the oven.  Very good!

I've been looking for a recipe like this for ages!  Nice and crisp on the top and soft underneath. I cut back the vanilla to 1 t. and omitted the walnuts and they were great!  I like that it only makes a small amount - perfect for our family of 3!  Thanks for sharing!

They are good.  Wait for them to cool down if you don't want them to gooey.  I cut mine 15 mins. after they got out of the oven and the chocolate smeared all over. Only complaint is that they are quite buttery.

Very good recipe! I made a different one from the internet previously and they were too flour tasting for me...these were delicious although next time I would double the recipe like others. Also I would let totally cool before removing from the pan~ I greased my glass pan with crisco and they still stuck a little and crumbled whern trying to take out. Best served heated up with vanilla bean ice cream on top and caramel smuckers topping!

These are buttery, chewy and rich, and SO good with the chocolate chips.  I think you could add anything to this recipe (peanut butter chips, butterscotch, coconut?) and it would be awesome.

Easy and fabulous, great brown sugar taste. 

Sprayed pan with PAM and think this helped a lot. Didn't cut baking soda as many suggested and think they are fine as-is. Mixed choc. chips in instead of putting on top.

I doubled the recipe and used "mini M&M baking bits".. mixing 1/2 in and and sprinkling some on top.  I baked it for 30 min. in a 9 x 13 baking stone pan and even though they were a little hard to get out of the pan, they came out delicious.  They are a lttle harder than a traditional brownie... but I think most of the  "blondies" I have eaten are.

Baked for 25 minutes, but blondies were not done.  Very goopy inside with very done appearance outside.  OK taste, but just too soggy in the middle.

wow, so chewy & delicious! i made these blondies as directed except for doubling the recipe & baking them in a 10"x15" pyrex dish (at 325 degrees for 35 minutes because of the glass bakeware). i truly enjoyed the method which uses a pot, that gave me a chance to break out the wooden spoon! thanks sue, your recipe's been tucked away in my recipe box for 2 years. i didn't know what i was missing!

This is a great recipe!  Very quick and simple to make. I used an 8x8 inch baking dish and as someone suggested, baked it at 325 deg for about 35 min. This was my first time making blondies and it sure won't be my last. YUM!

This was out of this world. I tripled the recipe and decreased the baking powder by half. I also mixed peanut butter chips and chocolate chips and mixed them into the batter...mmmm...I can't say enough. For anyone who says they were crumbly or more like a cookie, I suspect they over cooked them. Just like regular brownies you have to pay special attention to the appearance of the blondie and not the time, all ovens cook differently. When cooked properly they have a soft, cakey but dense texture. Perfection.

I left out the walnuts and decreased the amount of sugar by a bit (I think I used 3/4 cup). They are so easy, quick and delicious!!! Definitely a keeper, they are almost better than regular brownies!

Yummy and easy! I don't really like butter, so I used 1/3 cup of margarine instead, and they still turned out really well!

This recipe was very easy to follow.  I did cut down on the baking powder like someone else had suggested and they turned out perfectly.  I have never made blondies before, but these were easy and AWESOME!!!  (my hubby loved them and so did my kids)

These are pretty good, be sure not to overbake them or else they will come out dry.  I like to underbake mine just a tiny bit, that way they stay "chewy" even after they sit for a few days.

Nice change from cookies and brownies, sort of a mix between the 2.  Followed the recipe minus the nuts, turned out great.  Cooked them in a 9x13.  Next time I'll double the recipe and cook in the same size 9x13 pan so they will be a little thicker.

I was hoping this would be a fluffy blonde brownie. Instead it was more like a giant sweet cookie.

These little things were amazing! I have made them twice now and they have been a huge hit...each time! I could easily make these once a week...just for myself  :) but alone...just smelling them when they are cooking....would be the give away and there would be no way of hiding them. I think next time I make them...I will take the suggestion of another viewer and add some of the chips to the batter. Thank you once again for another winner!!!

Super tasty! Just the thing I needed for my sweet tooth. Easy & quick to make. I only cooked for 20 mins., so they were a little soft, but still wonderful & caramelesque!

These were DELICIOUS. They tasted better the next day, too. I used 1 TEASPOON of VANILLA because it seemed like the recipe has too much vanilla and they came out great. GOOD JOB.

Okay, so it's not the easiest blondie recipe you'll find -- but it just melts in your mouth. That's not hard for any recipe with a fat/sugar content this high. Still - like the ad says: "If you're gonna have a cookie -- have a cookie." The extra effort is worth it. The extra time? Welllll, when it comes to blondies, I work at a reduced rate...

The only changes I made were to use w/w flour instead of white and mix  in raisins instead of chocolate chips. I'm fairly certain this is the same recipe I grew up with.  Very Yummy! Only made a single batch because I was afraid I'd eat the entire thing.

Used 1 cup of chips since I ran out of nuts. Wish now I had waited. Also had a hunch about the sweetness level; used 3/4 of a cup of brown sugar. Next time, I'll back it down to 2/3 cup. Still very, very sweet. EASY recipe to make, though. With slight adjustments due to sweetness level, I'll make this over and over. Thanks for the easy method! **Added 1/3 cup of oatmeal and that tempered the sweetness level a bit. Still too sweet - will keep trying since it's so easy to make.

This was my first attempt at making Blondies, I've only ever had them at restaurants. These were delicious! The only change I made was less than the suggested amount of chocolate chips, and I used mini morsels instead of the traditional size. I doubled the recipe, and used 9x9 pans instead of 8x8. These were gobbled up quick at a party we hosted for my brokerage. Will definitely be making these again!

I mixed the chocolate chips into the batter. I actually would have liked them to be a little sweeter. I may have baked them slightly longer than I should have, because I like my bar cookies & brownies to be ever so slightly underdone. But I took them to work and got a lot of compliments!

This is the same as mine. Yes, it's great. I usually double the recipe because one is never enough. I got this from my Mother over 50 years ago. Sometimes Mother and I would double the chocolate chips - love chocolate. And yes, I've been asked for the recipe many times.
Glad to know this one is here in case I lose mine.

This is a wonderful recipe!!  i used it exactly as written by the OP.  It was fantastic.  I just made the second batch as the first was used for friends.  I plan to use it again and again.  I can't wait to put dried cranberries in it but wanted to respect the OP first.

I made this yummy recipe for a family get together. I doubled it as suggested and mixed the chocolate chips into the batter. Later that week I made them for my Son’s workplace. They loved them as well. Great recipe!

I totally judge my baked goods by how the batter is.  This batter was meh.  And I kept checking to see if I had all of the ingredients because it seemed too sugary.  Gritty... Lacking in something.  I put it on the oven, read the reviews, found someone else thought the same thing.  So I pulled them out and started mixing in flour (yep, in the baking dish) until the consistency and pre cooked taste was more to my liking.  In the end, we have a winner.  I prob doubled the flour.  And I also used dairy free butter so my allergy baby could enjoy.  Flavor is on point.  Thanks for the super easy recipe.

Mixed the chocolate chips in the batter, rather than sprinkling on top. Doubled the recipe and baked for 25 min in 9x13 Pyrex pan. They came out perfect.

Excellent blondies that were moist and chewy. Not too sweet and not gooey. I made a lot of substitutions because I didn't have all the ingredients, but they still turned out great! Subbed in an 8x8 pan, pancake syrup for vanilla, wheat flour for all purpose flour, no chocolate chips or walnuts, and baked for 30 minutes.

Didn't change a thing other than omitting walnuts (allergies) and I tripled the recipe because I needed 48 bars for an event (I used 11 x 17" pan).  They turned out perfect!  I will use this recipe from now on, and will probably even use as a cookie cake for birthdays.

These were pretty good. I liked how soft and chewy they were even the next day. However, I found them to be a little flavorless. Mostly just very sweet. The only real flavor was the chocolate chips. I would have liked the actual blondie part to have more of a flavor than just sweet. I enjoyed eating them but probably won’t make them again.

I doubled the recipe, used 1/3C chocolate and 1/3C white chocolate chips, and cut back on the vanilla to 1tsp per recipe. Since I doubled the recipe I used 2tsp vanilla. We really liked these, but they turned out a little bit dry (possibly due to over baking). Next time I make them I definitely won’t bake longer than 25min and will update the rating if they turn out less dry.

I doubled the recipe, used a 13x9 pan. I spread 2/3 of the batter and covered that with shredded almond bark. Then I used an ice cream scoop to dollup remaining batter on top and spread a little. I then took caramel filled chocolate candies and spaced them out on top.

These are awesome. I've made many times using a different combination of baking chips and nuts, sometimes leaving out the nuts all together. I don't even use a mixer with these bars, just mix it all by hand in one bowl. I combine the dry ingredients first, then add the brown sugar, melted butter combined with vanilla, and beaten egg, then I mix with wooden spoon. Using a mixer will beat more air into batter, making for a more cakey brownie, and these are meant to be chewey and "fudgy," not cake-like. Do not overbake these brownies. They will continue to bake after you take them out of the oven. I bake for 23 minutes in my over and take them out just as the top turns goldern brown. I've made these with almonds and white chocolate chips, semi-sweet chips and toffee bits, and milk chocolate chips and pecans. These are just so easy, and everyone likes them.

Vanilla flavor is overwhelming. Is there an error in the recipe and the vanilla should be a teaspoon and not a Tablespoon?  I love blondies but this was not good at all. These didn’t rise and while the knife came out clean, they seemed to be undercooked.

I thought these were good, not outstanding, but good. It’s basically just a big cookie, not a brownie. I doubled the recipe, but wish I would not have doubled the salt as it was a bit too much. Otherwise the flavor is good, not too sweet. It does bake up nicely and rises, but the edges were too crisp for my liking and the batter was hard to work with. I’m not sure if I’ll make again, maybe just as a large cookie cake or something instead of blonde brownies. My husband really liked them and so did the kiddo, but it was just a meh for me.

Great recipe! Only change I did was to mix some chocolate chips in the batter and then topped the batter with some....which is not really a change.  WHAT A TREAT!  My only wish is if we had some ice cream in the house to dollop on top... not needed at all but oh it would put this over the top!  Please ignore any of the naysayers ...if you are craving something decadent.

I loved the texture of these, but something was missing. The taste was like a chocolate chip cookie.... that someone forgot to add the chocolate chips too. The sugary sweetness over powered the chocolate chips in it. I would not make this again.

Doubled the recipe and added about 1 cup of chocolate chips mixed into the batter.  This recipe is a winner!

I doubled the recipe and used a 13x9 pan which I sprayed and lined with parchment paper for very easy removal. I omitted the walnuts and used a combination of milk, dark and butterscotch chips. I mixed the majority of the chips into the batter and reserved 1/4 cup which I sprinkled on the top. I baked for ~28 min, but I think I could have taken them out a few min earlier. I chopped off the edges because they were a little hard (no waste....I'm taking care of that!)  I plan to place a few in a cellophane bags tied with a ribbons for the bake table at a Kielbasa Fest at my church.  Thanks Sue -- very good and versatile recipe!

Mmmmm. Double the recipe in a 9x13 pan. With or without nuts it's great. No need to double the vanilla. Easier than cookies when you're craving chocolate chip!

I'm wondering if 1 TBSP of vanilla is correct.  Many other recipes for blonde brownies use 1 teaspoon, so I decreased this to 1 teaspoon.  Anyone out there in recipe land know if 1 TBSP is too much?  I love the flavor of vanilla flavoring, but that just seems like too much.

Wonderful! Tip : to avoid overly crunchy blondies pull out of oven when they are slightly firm to the touch whilst the brownie may not look fully done just like a cookie it will set.

Went straight by the receipt and won't be doing that again. Definitely need to double the recipe unless you like 1/2" thin brownies. But it leaves a wierd after taste, almost bitter. For sure nothing like the ones I've made before.

I have made this twice, doubling the recipe both times, and baking it in a 13x9 pan.  I allow a little extra cooking time, but not much.  I took the pan of bars to two different parties.  I came home with an empty pan the first time.  Emptied quite quickly!  The second time, the party hosts said, oh, just leave the rest with us!  It is definitely a favorite!  Btw, at the second party, I put this out on the counter but we were eating appetizers at the moment, so I didn’t cut them.  The gentleman I was chatting with kept eyeing them and all of a sudden he interrupted our conversation and said, “I can’t take it any longer.  Could you please cut me a piece? “. Lol

I will definitely make these again. I’ll probably add more walnuts and a few less chocolate chips, but very good. I made it in an 8x8 pan. I will say it was a bit hard to get baked through the middle enough without getting the edges too dark, though. You definitely have to watch it close. The first time I went to take it out, the middle was still completely raw dough, but the edges were already getting dark. So once the middle was done enough, the edges were a little too dark and crispy for my taste.

My grandma used to make these when I was a kid. Went searching for a similar recipe. These are close and delicious. I made exactly as the recipe stats. Like others I would probably double and use a 9x13.

I have made this several times and it is perfect. I usually mix 1/2 white and 1/2 chocolate chips. I've also doubled the recipe as others have done. My go-to for bar cookies.

I really like this recipe, but because I'm the kind of baker that experiments, I did made a few adjustments:
I used less sugar, about 2/3 to 3/4 packed, but that is just a matter of taste.
I used a 8 by 8 brownie pan. Worked fine, with same time measurements.
I use different nuts, once with pecans, second time with almonds.
I use different kinds of chips. My ideal would be butterscotch and semi-sweet chocolate chips, but on hand I had toffee bits, cinnamon chips, and milk chocolate chips.
I think if you like to experiment, this is an easy enough recipe to  work with.

Easy, straightforward recipe to make. I did double the recipe and as my family doesn’t care for nuts in baked goods, I omitted those. The only thing I will do differently the next time is to watch how I adjust the baking time.  Most reviewrs who doubled the recipe increased the cooking time by 10 minutes so that’s what I did. They did not burn but they cooked a little longer than I prefer changing the texture of the brownie. Next time I make this recipe I will set the timer for the minimum cooking time and add cooking time if needed.  Very pleased with the recipe.

I've made this recipe twice with the chocolate chips and nuts,(although I love both,) omitted because I truly wanted a blonde brownie.  1st recommendation is to add 1/2-1 t. more vanilla. They still lacked sweetness and flavor. Second batch I added added 1/4 sugar, and used 1/2 c. lt. brown sugar and 1/2c. dk. brown sugar, packed of course. This added a little more chewiness and flavor. These were wonderful!

I have made these twice and everyone loved them.  Simple to make.  They were moist and chewy.  I sprinkled with a little chocolate and butterscotch chips.  I didn't want too many chips, and I also used pecans instead of walnuts.

I made these vegan by using coconut oil and apple sauce instead of egg. I made without any mix ins but will add salted caramel next time.

It was dry and cake like. If you want a cake with chocolate chips this is it but if you're looking for a brownie, it's not chewy or moist like one at all. They were OK warm but once cooled the texture and taste wasn't amazing. Disappointed.

Yummy! Perfect every time -- I always double it and bake in a 9x13 pan and it's still never enough!! Especially good with crushed Butterfingers and chocolate chips.

Chewy, soft, but keeps itself together. Really rich. REALLY good. I'm just a sucker for brown sugar. I used milk chocolate chips and mixed some into the batter before pouring the rest on top.

My daughter and I made these for a new neighbor.   They were so good we half-considered keeping them for ourselves!  Used mini chocolate chips and sprinkled probably less than the amount in the recipe.  Since the brownies are pretty sweet, we preferred having fewer chocolate chips.  Will be making these again, and for ourselves!

Sooo goood! I've made it many times. Sometimes I will substitute 1 tbsp oil, 2 tbsp water and 2 tsp baking powder instead of egg and it still works. Cut it when its warm or it won't be separated. Also use tin foil. My family loved it.

Made these exactly as written. Taste was ok, a bit too sweet and too salty at the same time. Used an 8x8 pan and the ended up being less than a half inch thick. Leavening agents were all new, so I'm not sure what the issue was. Even with how thin they were, the center never did get fully baked while the edges were overdone.

Good. But took away one star because it tasted more like chocolate chip cookies than a blondie.

Why I didn't give this recipe 5 stars.... I made exactly as directed and the 2 main problems I have with this is that the brownies are very THIN, and the chocolate chips did not rest on top of the brownies like shown in pictures. Next time I am doubling the recipe and dusting the chocolate chips with flour to keep them from sinking.

Amazing! The only change that I made was that I omitted the walnuts. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a T. They seem closer to a blondie than a brownie imo, which I love. They are chewy & delicious! This is a good base recipe to have some fun with & tweak in the future.

I followed the recipe exactly. The overall taste was very good, however, I would compare consistency of my results more to a cookie than a brownie.   I think the 9 x 9 inch pan is a bit large for the recipe and caused the brownies to be drier and crispier than I would expect from a brownie recipe.  I used a full cup of chocolate chips, which were ghirardelli brand.  This is not the recipe for you if you want a moist chewy brownie.  You'd have to reduce the flour, maybe add an egg and double the recipe to get there.

I made this recipe and they turned out great. It was my first time making blonde brownies and I'm glad I didnt have to look for another recipe. The only thing I changed was I left out the chocolate chips because I didnt have any.

These were awesome.  I did make just a few adjustments based on my preference:)  Doubled recipe.  Decreased sugar to 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar.  Added 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg.  Put 3/4 cups cinnamon chips in with dry ingredients before combining with wet and sprinkled another 1/4 cup on top.  Baked at 325 degrees in 9x13 inch metal cake pan for 30 mins.  Came out perfect.  Cut into squares.  I made these for a picnic.

No changes needed  - Soft, delicious chocolate chip blondie that was extremely easy. Next time I will use it to make a frosted cookie cake for a child's birthday because it would be perfect for this. I did use 2/3 cup of chocolate chips and mixed them in to the batter before spreading in the pan. This was plenty, I would not recommend 1 full cup. Highly recommend!

Was really good. Had to bake 30 minutes to get top golden brown, inside was gooey and really good. I used Heath bar crunch chips instead of chocalote and served warm with ice cream. Was excellent.

it is amazingly delicious and not squishy at all..the only problem was the recipe called for to much sugar but that's easily adjustable..I recommend a half cup instead of a cup...and once you refrigerate it it becomes hard so just pop it in the microwave for a couple of seconds

I made these as cupcakes for a BDay I put half batter in lined muffin pans the put a miniature Reese's cup in batter cover each with other half of batter. We're very good I did double the recipe it made 13 cupcakes baked at 350 until lightly brown let set in liners until cool. Note they were super sweet??

My eight-year old made these all by herself (except putting in the oven), and they were amazing! Everyone that had one of these thought they were the best blondies they had ever had. She doubled the recipe and kept the ratios. Very pleased with how easy and fast these were. We will definitely make these again.

Served it for dessert for the family. It was loved by all. A chocolate chip cookie in brownie form. I followed the directions omitting the nuts as the teens don't like nuts in desserts.

After reading reviews I was skeptical about choosing this recipe.So glad I tried this! It is amazing!  I lost my original recipe of over 40 years. Now that I found this one I will stop looking for the  old one as this one is the best! Always made it in a 9 x 13 so I doubled all ingredients and added in chocolate chips at the end  of the mixing just to combine.
The batter is very stiff so you will need to push/pat it with a spoon to cover the pan evenly. I baked at 330 degrees not 350 checking it in 25 min with a knife to see if it came out almost clean. If it didn't I checked again in 8 min. The sides will be raised and the center slightly lower. Don't over bake so when knife is clean except for end tip having a trace of batter remove and put pan on rack to cool.
The edges are slightly crunchy giving way to a nice chew. The middle is softer and slightly chewy.  The perfect blondie!

First time making blondies and this recipe was amazing. I didn't have a 9x9 pan so I added half to the recipe and baked it in a 9x13. The only real "change" to the recipe was that I put in two eggs instead of the one and a half because you can't really have one and a half eggs.

The batter was very easy to work with; I will say that this batter is quite cookie-like in that you have to spoon the batter into your pan and spread it out evenly instead of pouring it out. I also suggest folding in the chocolate chips (and nuts if that's your thing) at the end instead of putting them on top. Just a personal preference though.

All in all they turned out delicious: Very much like a giant bar cookie with that brownie chewy-ness. I will definitely be making these again.

These were great as is.  I liked that they were crisp on top but soft in the middle.  These were a hit at our casual dinner.  I baked them 21 minutes in my oven at 350 and they were just right.

Personally, I didn't care for the flavor of these. It is a recipe very heavy on brown sugar and too much vanilla. That is really the prominent  taste in these, and it's not for me. I was expecting more of a chocolate chip cookie flavor. They are chewy and the consistency is good, though. I would possibly make this recipe again, with half white sugar. I'm not sure if they would then lose the chewy texture?

This is my first review so here goes...
These looked delicious however; you can't eat a photo...LOL.  Seriously tho...I've made these twice. After reading the reviews; I followed the directions the first time with the exceptions of:
1.  Reducing the amount of brown sugar to 1/2c  
2. Using 2/3 cup of 60% cacao Ghiradelli chocolate chips stirred in as directed AND sprinkling 1/2 cup of Guittard Green Mint Chips on top of the batter before baking.  (It just seemed a good mix...unless you don'tlike mint)

The result:
Using 1/2 cup of the Dark Brown Sugar was just right. Still sweet just not over-powering.
The 60% cacao chips were a yummy substitute.
The mint chips stayed on top and the mix of  chip flavors was just right. 

The above comments came from our Bible Study 
(Community Group).

The second time:
1. Used only the 1/2 cup of Dark Brown Suger as before.
2. Added extra vanilla: 1-1/2 tsp instead of 1 tsp
AND also 1 tsp of Almond Extract.
3. Added extra 60% chips: Used 1 cup instead of 2/3 cup and this time FOLDED the 1/2 cup of mint chips into the batter.

The result:
Our Community Group REALLY  loved them! I made a DOUBLE batch and baked them in a 9x13x2 glass pan at recommended temp until wooden toothpick inserted into the center came out clean...(I think about 45 min...it was a double batch) Do a visual check at 30 min and a toothpick check at 40 min.  There were 12-15 squares and 7 people in attendance; I took home 4 pieces. Some of the pieces were taken home for a "la

I doubled the recipe and put it in a large cake pan. I also mixed the chocolate chips into the batter, nut only 1/2 cup!

 I LOVE crunchy edges my husband and brother in law prefer the inner cuts (in both seep dips pizza and brownies)

For crunchy edges bake for 30 mins checking on it every 5 mins starting at 30 mins. 

I'm so serious! If you love crunchy edges over bake and tad bit keep an eye on it as to not to burn it. 

I'm having a problem not eating all these right now.

I doubled the recipe but did only put 3/4 tsp of baking powder like another review had mentioned.  I didn't have semi sweet chips but did have milk chocolate ones.  However, the reason why I doubled the recipe was so that I could take some to work.  Now I think I'm going to have to make more because my family won't stay out of them

I made these once, I folded in the chocolate chips and did not include the walnuts. They were easy to make and we thought they turned out great, especially fresh out of the oven. I frozen the leftovers and they were great too.

This is my new easy go-to blondie recipe. The brown sugar with melted butter gives a wonderful caramelly taste. Almost as good as browned butter. Remember if you are baking in a glass pan, to bake them 25 degrees cooler, so 325. I made them in a parchment lined 8x8 so they were a little thicker so mine were around 27 minutes. I also used salted butter as that's what I had and omitted the salt. I love that I don't even have to break out my kitchen aid mixer for this.

Delicious! I used 3/4 cup brown sugar & halved the salt. I also reduced the baking powder following other reviews. I baked 10 min more in an 8x8 pan. This is awesome. 1/2 cup chocolate chips is plenty for me. I plan to make this again the same way.

04-22-16 ~ Needed a quick dessert for school. This fit the bill. The flavor is good, but the next time, I would incorporate the chocolate chips in to the batter, rather than putting on the top. Everyone at school enjoyed them.

Yum!  Definitely make sure to sift the flour twice as I think it makes a difference in the thickness of the blondie. I double the recipe and use 2 8x8 pans because my family likes the edges best.  My kids favorite treat! Note: I used dark brown sugar and although the kids loved it, it was WAY too sweet. Next time, use light brown.

Finally I have the perfect blondie recipe! Too many blondie recipes turn out glorified chocolate chip cookies. This are dense, rich with a crisp exterior and gooey interior. I've made this recipe 3 times so far: once as written, once with white chocolate chips and macademia nuts, and for a really rich blondie, butterscotch chips with pecans. The last one reminds me of a pecan pie. The only changes I've made to the process is that i don't sift the flour before measuring it (I measure out a cup of flour and add it and the other dry ingredients into the sifter) and I mix the chips and nuts into the batter at the end.

LOVE this recipe!  And so do many friends.  Have made it multiple times - I always double it and bake it in a 9x13 pan so I can leave some at home and take some with us.  When I do that, I use 1/2 cup milk chocolate chips and 1/2 cup white chocolate chips.  Yum!  About to make a batch tonight to share at a baseball tournament this weekend!  Thanks for a fantastic recipe Sue Bush!

HI sue my mother has always made these blond brownies! We love them! My kids especially my oldest son love them they are the favorite desert other than choc chip cookies!  Glad to see I'm not the only one who has a sweet tooth! By the way they are not blondies! Those as people think call blondies are exactly chocolate chip cookies put in a pan! Way different! Thanks for posting the recipe and keep up good work!

I would definitely make these again! I followed the suggestion to double the recipe and cooked it for 25 minutes in a 13x9 pan and they were perfect! Otherwise cooked it exactly as the recipe was listed

I have never made blonde brownies. This was the first time and I followed the recipe exactly (well almost). I had no walnuts or chocolate chips so I improvised and placed 16 Rolos into the batter once it was spread into the pan, before baking. I used a dark pan, not glass, and they were baked perfectly at 20 minutes. These brownies are amazing!! Great recipe! Thank you! I may try this with Reese's Pieces next time :)

These turned out exactly as promised: chewy and delicious with a perfect balance of sweet.

 I'm not an experienced baker so I followed the recipe exactly as written. I forgot to add the vanilla and I was upset with myself for that, but, my friend assured me that it wasn't noticeable. 

I'm making this again tomorrow except I'm doubling the recipe. I highly recommend this recipe.

Yum! Very good! I doubled the recipe, which took a lot longer to cook than I anticipated. The only thing I did different was to throw in a cup of Heath brickle that I needed to use up. They were very rich and gooey inside.

Followed recipe exactly but DOUBLED the ingredients and baked in 13x9 for about 35 minutes. These came out PERFECT and THICK, just the way we like our brownies! Sent these with my college sons to Bible study and the students loved them! Will be making more of these for our family this week.

So obviously this recipe doesn't need to be changed at all. The only thing I did different was to double it! Mine came out perfectly at 20 minutes. My husband who doesn't even like sweets couldn't stop eating these! I will be making these regularly for the kids (husband included).

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but they did not turn out well. They tasted like they needed more sugar. The texture was ok, I baked for 20 minute and the middle was not done but the edges were very brown.

It's a great recipe. I used salted butter, because it is what I had and the recipe didn't specify to use unsalted. I also added in the salt. The brownies came out good, but too salty. I should have skipped the salt, or at least halved it.

I recommend doubling the recipe! I made the gluten-free with 1.5 cups brown rice flour and .5 cup of gluten-free all purpose, 1/2 tsp. xanthan + 1/2 tsp baking powder (instead of 1 tsp baking powder). I followed the recipe for the rest.

Yum! Just what I was looking for. I made them exactly by the recipe, except I left out the nuts and stirred in the chocolate chips. Delicious! Oh, the toothpick still didn't come out clean at 25 minutes or more, but they were done. I think I'd try them after 20 minutes next time, but I'd definitely pull them out at 25.

I used 2 teaspoons vanilla for a double batch, very good.  It IS a sweet brownie.  I added 1/2 cup M&M's and 1/2 cup butterscotch chips which I mixed into the batter.  I feel a semi-sweet choc. chip would have been better.  I did not add nuts but I can see a salted nut really balancing the sweet well.  
Thank you for the recipe!

I made this exactly as directed and they just wouldn't cook in the middle.  I ended up having to cut off all the outside edges after about 35 - 40 minutes and cook the inside portion for another 15 - 20 minutes.  The taste was ok, but I wouldn't recommend this recipe as they just didn't cook through.

These are the best blonde brownies I have made since I  lost my old recipe in my many moves!  I have a new oven that is not convection so I baked them a couple of minutes longer.   Perfect!

Followed recipe except I added 1/2 cup peanut butter and only used baking soda. I also cooked it for 30 minutes. They were moist, sweet, and all around great! They were gone in a day between 3 people!

I used macadamia nuts and white chocolate chips instead of the walnuts and chocolate chips.  Yummy!

Delicious.  Just made them today and couldn't get enough of them.  Only suggestion is to push the chocolate chips into the batter or mixing them in at the end.  Will definitely make this again and double the recipe in a larger rectangular pan.

Great. I was looking for an old bhg or bc recipe I lost, found this 1. Made per directions, exceptions of 1 stick butter & 1 teas vanilla. Also no addition of nuts/chips per choice. Single recipe fit perfectly in 9" round cake pan. Baked 20 minutes. I was skeptical at the appearance that looked like a cookie, Yet surprised with the taste / texture of a "blonde brownie".  *I did stir/mix by hand with a spoon, because I recall older brownie recipes specifically stating to do that rather than using electric mixer*

This recipe is really, really good if you are looking for a blondie that has the same constancy as a fudgy brownie. If you like your blondie/brownies more cake like, keep looking this isn't the recipe for you.

I have a lot of friends/family with nut and chocolate allergies, so this is a huge favorite at gatherings (minus the nuts and chocolate chips, obviously). Very rich AND makes a great base for cookies too!! Add some Wilton Jumbo Confetti, roll into one inch balls and bake for 15-20m (check frequently because ovens are different) and you have funfetti cookies. Just be aware these suckers spreeeaaaddd when baked like this, so keep a good distance between them.

Good, but a bit too much chocolate chips. Next time I won't put in the called for amount and instead of scattering the chips on top I'll mix them into the batter.

I doubled the recipe except for the baking soda and baking powder and turned out great! I've tried to make blondies forever and this recipe is just delicious. A little too sweet for some people but everyone loved it when they tried it!! Definitely will make it again. SUPER RECOMMENDED

Very tasty Blondie  recipe. My husband was craving something  sweet, so I made these and they were gone within the day. I did add a spoonful of creamy peanut butter (my preference) and loved the creamy texture they added.
I also made another batch with cranberries, blueberries, a 1/2 cup of oatmeal and walnuts. This also turned out spectacular. Totally  different  concept, but same base recipe. Thanks for sharing!

These just came out of the oven. 

The taste... it's like heaven in my mouth!

I didn't put the nuts in only because I wanted to be able to make it so that my kids can take to school (nut-free), otherwise, I followed the instructions. 

I baked them in a muffin pan so I could have individual blondies (I also didn't have a 9x9 pan lol).  Baked for about 25 mins.

It needs just one change: 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1 cup brown sugar! 

Rest was exact same, and I broiled the blondies for a minute after baking for 20 minutes. They developed a wonderful brown crust and were out of this world!

I made this with my 4 year old. I doubled the recipe as suggested. I don't like chocolate so I only put the chips on half and I used pecans instead of walnuts since I don't keep walnuts on hand. . I baked them in a brownie pan because I like the crunchy sides :). These are wonderful!!!! As someone suggested, don't try the batter because it was hard to put in the pans.This will be a favorite I go to often. Thanks for a great blonde brownie recipe!

This is the best recipe I am not able to eat dairy at this time and I can make these dairy free. They taste like The inside of a candy bar. I also roughly cut in a jar of marshmallow fluff. Salted nuts taste awesome too

I really liked it. Husband gives it 4 stars. I ended up having to substitute dark for light brown sugar, but It was amazing. Doubling the recipe is wise. I do think less salt would be better. Overall, I'm just sad we had no ice cream to eat with it!!

Excellent Blondie recipe! I doubled the recipe and left out the nuts. Absolutely wonderful with only chocolate chips! my only disappointment was that they came out darker than I anticipated.... and I don't think I burned them... Most people at work didn't recognize them as Blondies because of this.

These were good! I used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate (my fiance's not a big chocolate fan), but left everything else the same. They were tasty, and super easy! Great texture, chewy without being too dense or too cake. They did seem a little bit bland. I'm going to see if I can add a little bit to it to punch up the flavor a little more.

Followed the recipe as printed.  Everyone enjoyed them.  Easy to prepare. I baked for the 20 minutes, could have gone closer to the 25 minutes in my oven. My granddaughter will be making these next time.

Amaaaaaaazing! Way better than regular chocolate brownies. I used milk chocolate chips and it turned out fine but would advise using semi-sweet.

Delicious! The only thing I altered in this recipe is that I cut the sugar in half and they still came out beautifully! This is the first recipe of blondies that I have actually liked, and my family and boyfriend devoured them. I have already made 2 batches in less than 24-hours! Definitely a keeper.

Soooo good!! It was like the best chocolate chip cookie you've ever eaten had a baby with the best brownie you've ever eaten. Don't pass on this recipe. Really. It's amazing.

LOVED this, made them with GF flour, and 80% apple sauce instead of the oil. Used full amount of baking powder(as it was GF) Mixed in White chips,and Put some on top (teenager,cannot resist such things) 

and they turned out FANTASTIC! 

Very moist and fluffy, with full blonde flavor. Double batch was made,as per suggestions(with additional cooking time) 
brought them as a camping snack, they didnt last the hour! 

Will DEFINITELY be making these again!

This turned out to be VERY DRY.  I followed the recipe verbatim and it was a thin, dry dessert.  I will modify the timing next time and not do the complete 20 minutes.

Made these with a girl I was babysitting..OMG good and so easy! Don't have a sifter so instead whisked the dry ingredients together before adding them. They didn't turn out chewy for me, but more soft cookie like but that's probably the pan I used (9 in. heart shaped). Definitely will make these over and over.

I don't know why I never made these before. But this is the first recipe I used and I have trouble keeping a pan around for more than 18 hours. Double batches from here on out.

This is a great recipe one best blond brown recipe I have. Sometimes I add colored M&M's during holidays instead of chocolate chips for gifts. At Christmas add red and green M&M's , Valentines Day add pink and red M&M's and for Easter I put pastels M&M's and I always double the recipe for my family. If I want to be extra festive I cut this with shape cookie cuts when I gifting them.

It tasted amazing, but one serving is tiny tiny. There wasn't even enough to fill a small Tupperware container. So probably triple the recipe

I've been looking for a chewy cookie bar and this didn't disappoint! I loved the texture and didn't change a thing except I didn't add nuts because I wanted it to be nut-free. It was a very easy recipe, too. My daughters gobbled them up. I only wish I doubled the recipe and made more because a 9x9 pan doesn't make very much.

Yum!!!! Followed directions nearly exactly (omitting only the walnuts). I had to cook a bit longer, but I doubled the recipe, so it was to be expected. This is a fantastic recipe, exactly what I was craving. Put a bit of vanilla ice cream on top, delicious!

I made these as cookies.  Was too lazy to double sift the flour and used 2/3c sugar since I find most dessert recipes too sweet.  Baked for 15 minutes on ungreased sheet - made 20 medium sized cookies.  They were PERFECT! Soft, chewy texture, great balance of sweet/nutty/chocolate, super quick and easy to make with ingredients always on hand.  These will be my go to cookies when we have friends drop in or just need a homemade treat ourselves.  So grateful for such an excellent recipe!

Not a fan of the mixture, or how much one batch makes. Should be more specific on whether to make a double batch. All in all, it taste great.

Great recipe. I changed the nuts to macadamia nuts and used white chocolate chips in lieu of regular chips and they were a hit with family that prefer no chocolate.

This recipe is the BEST.  I sometimes use white chocolate chips, and I always double the recipe. I have made this recipe about 15 times, and I have never had to throw away a bit, people are always fighting over the last one.

It worked out fine in the end, and it was very delicious. Everybody loved it so.  I will be using the recipe again and try to vary with nuts and chocolate.
After reading other reviews I'd halved the sugar amount and it was still very sweet, but I think the amount of choc chips was too high. I had Hershey's dark chocolate chips so I was surprised about the sweetness of it all.

The only substitution I made is white chocolate chunks instead of semisweet chocolate chips- I wanted it to be absolutely blond. Good, but not as good for me as brownies.

I guess everyone is looking for something different in a blondie, but from my perspective this one is just about perfect. It's not too salty, not too sweet, not too gooey! This is a great recipe that will become a go-to for family, potluck, and for any other occasion that I need a simple crowd pleasing dessert. Just make it once the way it is written, then decide for yourselves!!!!

Turned out great.  Followed recipe exactly but had to use an 8x8 pan because that's what I had handy.  I also mixed a few of the chocolate chips in the batter.  Wonderful1!

First time eating and making blonde brownies.  I was expecting them to taste more like butterscotch.  But as another reviewer said, they're VERY similar tasting to a chocolate chip cookie.  I would NOT, however, use this recipe for that purpose, as someone else suggested.  To be honest, these are WAY too sweet, even for me.  The chocolate chips are a nice touch but wind up being overkill in the sugar dept.  I doubled the recipe but kept the amount of the chocolate chips the same, and even that was too much.  I'm not sure what suggestions to make to improve this recipe so that it's not too sweet.  Maybe using dark/unsweetened chocolate chips or another kind of chocolate with a more subtle flavour perhaps or omitting them altogether.  Overall, pretty good. Texture and appearance are ok.   I'm not sure I'd go as far as to serve them to guests though.

Really delish! My oven is sort of unpredictable, so the top came out a dark brown. Just in case it's not my oven, I'd recommend covering the pan with tin foil. Other than that, these blondies are the bomb! Exactly what I was looking for.

I was excited to try this recipe as I really like chewy cookies, and I think anything made with brown sugar is a keeper.  My husband, son, daughter-in-law, and my three youngest grandkids (3-9) were here to try them.  Only one granddaughter didn't like them at all -- didn't say why, just didn't want to eat it after one bite.  Everyone else ate one or more.  I wasn't disappointed in their chewiness at all; I really liked the texture; however, tastewise, we all found them just a bit bland.  They will all be eaten, but I didn't hear any requests for me to make them again.  That is what I use as my personal "unofficial rating."  Pro, they were easy and fast to make and have ready to serve.  Thanks for sharing.  I seem to be in the minority as you seem to have made a lot of folks very happy with this recipe.

These were super easy, I also doubled the recipe. I omitted the chocolate chips added cinnamon baked until just past gooey. Served vanilla ice cream with warm Carmel sauce and walnuts. You could use praline pecans for a decadent desert. I will add this to my other Blondies recipes, you can't go wrong and if your baker you will usually have all the ingredients on hand.

These weer really good! followed the recipe to a t (unusual for me) and got a rich, decadent blondie. I think I was looking for something a little less buttery though, since I prefer my sweets slightly less greasy. I will continue looking for a new recipe. Great for someone who likes super-buttery baked goods though!

I make this ALL the time now. My entire family loves it. I blend the choc chips right through the batter. Makes a more even taste each bite. AND I decided to add some oats to it. Oh, makes them even better. Gives them more of a texture and I love oats anyway. This is the best blondie recipe!

Absolutely delicious.  Easy to make.  My only criticism is that one batch does not make enough servings for my greedy family :)

These disappeared quickly! I left out the walnuts and substituted oil for the melted butter. These two changes aside, I made the recipe as written and I was quite happy with how it came out.

These are a lot like the Brown Sugar Chews I made as a teenager for harvest crews.  I cut the brown sugar by 1/4 C. (I doubled the batch).  I also just used 1 T. of vanilla, even though doubling would have called for 2 T.  WAY to much.  Wasteful.  Stirred the chocolate chips into the batter.  Didn't have nuts (hey, it's the middle of the night and I live on a farm).  These were chewy and delicious.  We liked them very much.  Thank you for your recipe.

I love cookies...and I've never made Blonde Brownies before...and I've only eaten a blonde brownie once in my life.  I was slightly disappointed with this recipe.  I followed it exactly, and thought the taste and texture were lacking.  The texture wasn't like a cookie (of course) so I was a little put off by that...and the taste didn't...pop?  I don't know how to describe it.  It felt like it was missing something.  Unfortunately I'm no helping in offering what that "something" is.  If I make these again, I'll probably try a different recipe.  They're good, not great.  And not what I was expecting or craving!  =)

My mouth watered when I saw this recipe.  It didn't disappoint.  I am happy to report that my "blondie" craving is fully satisfied!   I have made this recipe several times.  It has always come out fantastic.  I do have a convection feature on my oven and use it for this recipe.  My family and friends are so happy when they walk in my house and smell these blondies cooking.  I have a batch in the in the oven as I type this....brownies anyone?

I loved this recipe. Easy, fast, fun to make with kids.  Had to substitute an 8x8 pan, but just lowered the baking temp. to 325 and baked for 40 min.  Great and tasty! Would have been tasty even without the chocolate pieces on top!

I did not care for this recipe. I believe the proportions are off. Like one other reviewer wrote, it turns into a glob of sugar & butter.

I had been looking for a blonde recipe for a Christmas gift for my co-workers. I made these yesterday night and cut one piece into tiny pieces so that my family can give me my grade. My husband came first for his piece,(he had a whole piece) by the time my boys ran to the counter my husband was finished with his and piece looking for a another. My boys(17&14) loved them; My co-workers almost didn't receive their gifts. This is an easy and delicious recipe to do with kids.

Excellent recipe. I wouldn't change a thing! Other than melting 2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips and mixing it with a can of sweetened condensed milk, pouring this mixture on top of 2/3 of the blondie batter and then adding the remaining batter on top. Run a knife through the batter to make swirls and pop it into the oven. You just made THE best fudge blondies EVER!

As written, I am not sure how tasty it would be.  I made the following changes: 1 teaspoon of vanilla, 2/3-1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips.  I also mixed the walnuts and chocolate chips together with the flour/salt/baking powder/baking soda mixture before i added the liquid ingredients.  I originally baked it for 20 minutes but it was still quite "soggy".  I put it back in the oven and cooked it for about 5-8 minutes.  I kept check the blondies to make sure they were not overcooked.  It's best served warm with a dollup of vanilla ice cream.

I made this as written and mixed the choc chips in the batter and then preceded to way overcook it!  Totally forgot about it, and they are still wonderful (for overcooked brownies that is) hoping to make them again this afternoon :)

I made the recipe just as it's written. The only needed change was the cook time. I almost had to double the cook time. Eventually, they were done and very tasty. They are very cookie like but in a bar form. That was cool with me. They were crisp and a little chewy just like a cookie. I put the chocolate chips over the top and I noticed that they were easier to cut without disturbing the chips once the whole thing had cooled off a little bit. I don't expect these to last very long at my house, but just to keep them from getting too hard, I'm keeping mine in a tupperware container on the kitchen cabinet. I think the fridge might turn them hard as rocks!

I've made these a few times now and my family loves them.  I leave out the walnuts because I don't usually have them in the house, and I've used both light and dark brown sugar.  So easy and so yummy!

Made these for my boyfriend, they turned out great. I used semi sweet chocolate chunks and mixed them into the batter rather than sprinkling them on top. Don't let these sit in the oven too long, I'd say 25 minutes TOPS is all they need. I lined the bottom of the pan with greased parchment paper, then use the paper to lift them out and set them on the countertop to stop the baking asap as they cooled. Easy and man-approved ;-)

I agree that this batter came out like cookie dough.  I did not want to make a big cookie so I added some heavy cream that I had on hand and from the reviews, cut down on the brown sugar by 1/4 cup.  I baked it in my 7x5 Pyrex glassware.  Instead of chocolate chips and walnuts, I threw in some old chopped Butterfingers.  I did only bake it at 325 (since it was glass) and baked it for about 30-35 minutes.  It rose really nicely and was not thin or cookie-like.  Excellent blondie!

These are always a hit! I mix the chips in with the nuts rather than placing on top. I usually double the recipe and bake in a larger pan. Using parchment paper in the pan works great.

These were absolutely amazing!  My mom asked me to make a sweet treat for the kids at a family gathering and I think more adults ate these than kids!  My mom (who is typically NOT a fan of sweets at all) probably ate the most out of anyone, she loved them.  The strong brown sugar taste definitely makes this brownie perfect.  Instead of chocolate chips, I used M&Ms and they came out great.

Made exactly as written and it was nothing special. Not bad - not great. The texture and flavor was pretty much identical to chocolate chip bar cookies. I won't make this again.

I don't know where I went wrong but I doubled the recipe like others suggested and used a 9x13 pan.    I just find that there is no flavor at all.  They are really bland!   Booooo!   And yes, I did use all the ingredients!

Made this last night to bring to a friend's dinner and it was a huge hit!  I left the chocolate chips on top as a kind of a frosting and everyone liked it that way. Next time, I'd fold them into the batter, only because it would be less messy to cut. I also greased the pan with a little butter to make it easier to lift out the squares, which worked perfectly!  This is a chocolate chip cookie bar that's chewy but not cloyingly sweet --- a keeper!

Everyone at work loved them.  I thought there were just toooo many chocolate chips.  I greased the pan with Pam cooking spray first, omitted the nuts, and doubled the recipe (did not double the amount of baking powder or baking soda) to fit perfectly into a 9X13 Pyrex dish and extened the cooking time to 30 mins.  Very wonderful, but I'll need to tweak these for my taste.

I don't usually bother to rate recipes but this was by far the BEST brownies I've ever had. Glad I doubled the recipe. I'm fighting so hard with myself not to eat half the pan right now!

Love this recipe! I added a tablespoon of cinnamon to kick up the spice and it definitely did the trick. Excellent blondies!

I have made these twice and they are amazing.  The first time we put white chocolate chips on tops and it was incredible.  The only problem was that the brownies were very, very gooey, even after I baked them 5 extra minutes; I like my brownies a little on the raw side so I didn't mind, but if you like a cakier brownie these may not be for you.  Extremely fudgey and delicious!

these turned out horrible. they took 15 minutes longer then said. The outsides were burnt. the chips fell thru and were stuck to the bottom of the pan. they also there extremely thin. just not good at all. I dont know what happened. I followed the recipe to a T. this happens every-time i make blondies...no matter the recipe. it must be my fault. lol

so this was my first attempt and WOW!  i LOVED them!  I used an 8X8 glass pan, lightly sprayed with cooking spray.  After 25 minutes, it was still pretty undercooked.  I stopped keeping track but i think it ended up with about 40 - 45 minutes of cooking time.  anyways, Delicious!  a definite keeper :)

My first attempt at these didn't turn out quite right. They were super raw on the inside and crispy on the outside. But try try again! I think the recipe is written incorrectly. It should actually be written as 1 cup of flour, sifted. The difference being the flour is sifted after measuring a cup out not before. After doing that these came out perfect!

The first time I made this, for whatever reason, there wasn't enough batter. I don't think I let the butter and sugar cook long enough because when I went to pour into the pan, there just wasn't enough to spread across the pan! But I just made it a second time and it was successful and soo ooey and gooey and delicious. It's just like eating a fluffy chocolate chip cookie. Mmmm

My teen son asked if his friends could come over, and I needed a quick treat for them. I had the ingredients for this on hand so decided to try this. WOW - they were so good! The kids loved them! I doubled the recipe and baked them in a 9x13 pan. I only baked them a bit longer than directed, and they were done perfectly. Oh, I added some chocolate chips to the batter, probably 1/2 cup in addition to the chips sprinkled on top. I will make these again and again!~

A winner! I replaced a little of the AP flour with some organic whole wheat flour and used pecans instead of walnuts because we prefer those.  I used mini chocolate chips and mixed them into the batter rather than sprinkling on top.  I sent these with my husband today for a church work day and I'm sure I'll receive good reports! :)

These are great.  I used pecans instead of walnuts (because walnuts mess up my mouth) and mixed in extra chocolate chips to the dough.  Served warm with vanilla ice-cream. Everyone raved.

Best blonde brownies EVER!  I made these for Thanksgiving, and they were gone in an instant...even before we ate dinner.  I left out the chocolate chips because when I was a kid, we had a deli in town that served plain blonde brownies.  The lady who owned the deli passed away, and her recipe went with her.  =(  I've been searching for a recipe like hers for YEARS...THIS IS IT!!  Thank you so much, Sue, for posting.

Excellent blondie!  I've made this 3x now and the key is to melt the butter and to be true to the cook time.  The second time I made this I neglected to melt the butter and cooked a bit long and the texture was off. Basically follow the directions!   I always mix in the chocolate chips...and add a few extra.

These came out pretty dry for me. I followed the recipe, the only change was doubling the batch and baking in a 9x13 pan, and turned down the temp in my oven because it bakes hot. Next time I will double and still use the 9x9 pan to make them thicker, and leave out the baking soda to make them less cakey.

Very good- subbed pumpkin puree for the butter, used a bit of wheat flour, half white sugar, and pumpkin pie spice, white chocolate chips. Cakey with the puree instead of butter.

Loved these. I doubled the recipe for a 13x9 pan, but only used 1 1/2 c. of brown sugar. With the chocolate chips (I just mixed them into the batter),  it's still plenty sweet enough. I only had 1 TBS. of vanilla left, so I didn't double that and don't think I will in the future. I used a white/whole wheat flour instead of the AP flour. Will definitely make again.

This is a great recipe.  The texture is terrific, it is easy, and the baking time is very accurate.  As others did, I doubled the recipe, used a  9 X 13 pan, and cut them into small pieces, as they are quite rich.   I also mixed the chips in with the batter, and they were perfect.

I do believe there is an error in the recipe.  1 tablespoon of vanilla is too much.  There was a definite bitter aftertaste due to this.  I think there should be no more than 1 - 1 1/2 tsps, and will do that the next time.

I was looking for an old blonde recipe I used to use, but was unable to find it, so I tried this.  It turned out to be a yummy dessert but it's not what I consider blondies.  These tasted just like chocolate chip cookies to me.

Even though I was a little concerned about baking what seemed like a small amount of dough in a 9x9 pan [felt like there were spots withouth any dough as I tried to spread to the edges] they baked beautifully and tasted wonderful!  I used 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and mixed them into the batter before baking.

Saved this recipe about a week ago and have made it 3 times already! Everyone loves them! Mixed half peanut butter chips and half chocolate chips and just mixed them right in to the batter instead of on top. YUM!

these are PERFECT!  perfect texture, not too dense.  not too cakey.  AMAZING!  only thing I changed was the amount of salt.  I had salted butter on hand so I reduced the salt to half of what the recipe called for.    the other thing I thought was odd is a lot of people said it was more of a "cookie" rather than a bar.  I didn't get that at all.  mine turned out exactly how a blondie should turn out.

These were okay, but not exceptional.  Nobody raved over them. I too found them to  be like a choc. chip bar.  I probably won't make this exact recipe again.

These are the best "brownie" type cookie I've ever tasted!  I ran out of vanilla so I used molasses instead which was delicious.  I've made them twice in one week.  The first batch was eaten right out of the pan by the kids.

Just made these again.....with vanilla.  They taste just like "butterscotch squares" candy by Sees.

These are my perfect-proportion blondies: amazing flavor and perfect texture. I stir the chocolate chips through and use a deeper, smaller pan, which calls for a slightly longer baking time.

Amazing!  I followed the recipe with one exception:  I used white chocolate chips rather than semisweet chocolate because I really needed to use the bag up.  I HIGHLY recommend eating this when warm. I'll be making this often, as I know it would be just as great with dark chocolate chips or even butterscotch ones.  Thanks for the recipe...I'm gonna go have another piece!

Oh my gosh these are delicious! And easy to make! I will have to try them again because I did overcook them a bit and I measured the chips by eye and didn't put enough. I haven't quite mastered the art of baking and multitasking. It will be a pleasure to try them again though!

These tasted pretty much like a chocolate chip cookie but easier and less time consuming. I made these with about 1/2 cup each of white and bittersweet chocolate chips and I just mixed them into the batter rather than putting them on top. I also omitted the nuts and baked it in a 8x8" pan. Turned out great!

Full marks for this recipe.   The first time I made these, I didn't bake them long enough. But I gave the jumbled mess a quick zap in the microwave, and they were wonderful. The second time, I left the pan in the oven until the edges of the brownies were quite dark, and it turned out perfectly.  This is less work than making cookies, and I like these far better than a chocolate brownie.

These were the best blonde brownies I have ever tasted and they were soooo easy to make! I did leave the nuts out and only baked for 19 mins. Thanks for sharing I will definitely make these again!

Very good.  We have a houseful of guests, and I guess I should've made more since the brownies are almost all gone, and our guests were gone most of the day!  These are so easy to make, and are soft and chewy.  I split the choc chips between the batter and the top of them.  Thanks for the recipe!

I wanted to love them but I didn't!  They dried out quickly and they seem bland to me.  Maybe I'm too much of a chocoholic to enjoy a blondie!  :)

These were yummy! Tastes like chocolate chip cookies but less sweet. I didn't have nuts so I didn't use any. I added butterscotch and semi sweet chips but next time I'll use just semi sweet and more of them.

These were quite good.  They are VERY rich and sweet. I made half with chocolate chips and half without (my husband's not a huge chocolate fan) and both tasted good. I prefer things a tad bit more on the "done" side, so next time I will add a few minutes to the baking time, as these were very chewy and soft.  These are great with vanilla ice cream, since they taste very cookie-like. Overall, yummy!

These are really good - if a bit sweet.  My kids prefer them to cookies and they are less time consuming, so it's win-win!

I renamed these for my family because the dish seemed to encompass my husband's two favorite desserts: brownies and chocolate chip cookies.  Our name for this dreamy dish is = chocolate chip cookie dough brownies.  I doubled just like other reviewers.  It worked out well except for a mistake made on my part.  I accidentally doubled the amount of salt.  Yeah, we all tasted it but it doesn't stop us from tasting beyond that to just how wonderful these brownies truly taste.

I gave this a four because while it was good, for me, it was too much like cake.  The next time i make this, i plan on leaving out the baking powder and soda all together to see if i can get a chewy brownie.

I made these for my boyfriend's niece and nephew when we took care of them for the day. They loved them. I left out the walnuts because I wasn't sure about their allergies, but I would add them in next time. They had a nice soft consistency, and weren't too sweet.

I omitted the walnuts and used chocolate chunks instead of chips. Turned out great.  They are really moist and rich - maybe a little too sweet/rich for some, but I thought they were perfect.

Before making this recipe, I didn't like blondies - but now I LOVE them! They are rich and moist, with a great flavor.   I used butterscoth chips in the batter instead of chocolate chips on top, and I chopped my walnuts up extra fine.  Seriously, people who don't even love desserts will devour these - a must try!

Only one word can describe this recipe, PERFECTION! Only thing I changes was that I did not add the walnuts because my little one does not like them. Also I combined white and semisweet chocolate chips for the topping. Absolutely wonderful, thanks for this recipe!

Yummy! I used self-rising flour so left out the baking powder, etc. I added chocolate chips and shaved almonds. They were so good I made another batch and took them as a gift to a friend.

Loved these!  I doubled the recipe and mixed in a lg bag of M&M's instead of choc chips.  They looked really pretty and tasted even better than they looked!!  :)

I thought these blondies were alright, but not the best I have ever had. A little bland, even tho I added butterscotch chips. They reminded me of less flavorful chocolate chip cookies.

This is one of my go to dessert recipes for days when I don't have time to run to the store for ingredients as I usually have most of these on hand.  If you think it is too sweet, use salted butter.  Then you get a delicious salty sweet flavor which I love.  I find that others really like the saltier version.  I like them with chocolate chips and butterscotch chips combined.  My husband prefers just chocolate chips.  You could stir in  any of your favorite cookie toppings though to change them up.

These were GREAT! I doubled and baked in a 9X13 inch pan and i halved the vanilla. I made the "big fat chewy chocolate chip cookie before and it was waayyyy too much vanilla for my liking!! These were perfect with the vanilla halved!

WARNING--Do not make these unless you are committed to share them at a function.  They are so addicting.  I DOUBLED the recipe and baked in a 9 X 13 metal greased pan for about 30 minutes.  I did NOT sift the dry ingredients and I used only 3/4 teaspoon of baking powder because I live above 5,000 ft. altitude. I only used 2 tsp. of vanilla extract.  2 Tabl. would have been too much. Do NOT omit the salt.  It balances out the 2 cups of brown sugar.  One time I made chocolate chip cookies and accidentally left out the salt and they just tasted funny.  I mixed 1/2 cup of the chocolate chips into the batter and sprinkled 1/2 cup on top of the batter once in the pan. These have a butterscotch-like taste because of the butter and brown sugar. Make sure that you bake these long enough to get a toasty-brown color on the edges and light brown in the middle.  Some of the photos look like they were underbaked.  Think chocolate chip cookie when deciding if they look done.  Took these to a football party and brought home an empty plate, which is a good thing, because I won't be tempted to eat them for breakfast.  YES, they're that good.

The only alteration I made was to omit the salt, and they came out looking (and tasting) perfect. I stuck them in the fridge after cooling and cutting, and I think I'll do that with all brownies from now on. My only complaint is that the vanilla taste is a little too strong; perhaps I'll divide it in half next time.

My crew enjoyed these blondies.  Can't say I absolutely loved them, mainly because nothing can compare to real brownies, but I'd make them again for a nice change of pace.

I doubled the recipe, and used butterscotch chips instead of chocolate, mixing them into the batter instead of scattering them on top.  I baked them in a 13 x 9 pan, extending the baking time by about 6 minutes.  Great recipe!

Very nice simple brownies, nice alterative to chocolate brownies. The only change to this recipe I made was adding some of the chocolate chips into the mix as well as sprinkling on top. Very easy to make.

Absolutely amazing!! So yummy and very easy to make.  Little bit too much chocolate for my like, would half it.  I also made them in muffin tins (filled about half full as they expand) and that made them extra chewy!  They take less time to cook as well and don't have to cut them after :)

I thought these blonde brownies were just okay. To me they seemed a little dry and bland.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used white chocolate chips. I prefer a more chewy/cakey consistency and this definitely wasn't it.  I like the Blonde Brownies III recipe by Rosina better.

These are indeed very sweet, but I have a huge sweet tooth. I doubled the recipe with the exception of the salt.  I used chopped pecans and also added toffee bits.  I omitted the chocolate chips. Baked for 28 minutes and they came out perfect, nice and chewy but not gooey. Huge hit at my house.

I followed other peoples suggestions and doubled this recipe - except the baking powder (I only used 3/4 tsp) & I skipped the nuts all together. I lined the bottom of my 9 x 13 pan with parchment paper for easy removal & baked it at 350 for 28 minutes. Very tasty.

These are just delicious. I made the recipe as directed, but used peanut butter/milk chocolate swirled chips and just sprinkled them on top.  They had a great flavor- almost like caramel. Next time I will definitely double the recipe- they were gone too quickly!

I was out of eggs when i decided to make these so I substituted with 1/4 cup of soy milk. Also, I didnt have a 9x9 baking pan so i used an eight by eight. These took alot longer to cook and still were not fully cooked after I took them out. The center sank in. The taste was a bit too salty for my preference so I'll decrease the salt by a pinch next time and I have a feeling if I use an egg and bake it in the right size dish they will turn out perfectly. No knock to the recipe it was my fault that I didnt have the right stuff. I'll be trying this one again! Also, I didnt have choco chips so i left that part out completly : (

So easy they can be thrown together in no time!  I put them in a muffin pan and made 12 blondie cupcakes.  Not the prettiest outcome (the centers sunk in slightly), but they are very tasty.  Followed the recipe, except used milk chocolate chunks.  I'll use this recipe again.

So chewy and delicious.  I used toffee chocolate pieces in place of the walnuts and choco chips.  Thanks heaps for the recipe!

I didn't have any walnuts so I used trail mix -the raisins. Yes, I picked them all out.  Good stuff.

I made this recipe the first time 3 weeks ago and since have made it at least 9 times, they're now my husbands and my favorite! I used margarine instead on butter with no problems and I didn't add all the chocolate chips, i used a little more than 1/2 cup. These come out with a crunchy top but chewy insides. This is now my brownie recipe of choice.

I would give this a 5 star, because we did eat the whole thing in one night ... but ... I do think it needs a little more flour.  ALso, you may want to DOUBLE the recip, because there aren't many to go around!  I'll be making them again tonight.

I just made these according to the recipe, and think that they are too sweet and rather greasy.  Perhaps too much butter and not enough flour.  Don't think I'll make them again.  :(

Very good and chewy! I made them twice, once with just chocolate chips and the second time with 1/2 the chocolate chips stirred into the batter and then the other half M&M's sprinkled on top. They were FANTASTIC.

Very good with a couple of changes of my own. Used 1/2 cup macadamia nuts and 4 oz chopped white chocolate, both mixed into the batter (omitted the chocolate chips). I think I overcooked mine a little b/c the outer edges are hard, but that's my fault, not the recipe's. Will definitely make again.

WONDERFUL!! I was a little skeptical at first because of the minimal number of ingredients. I figured it'd be about the same as any other recipe... wrong! These are GREAT! Everyone loved them - will DEFINITELY make again!!

First time making, but the 2nd time tasting a blonde brownie, and these did not disappoint. The only changes I made where I used bread flour in place of all purpose to make a chewier brownie. Oh it was so worth it, I was out of chocolate chips so I sprinkled cinnamon chips on top. They were delish, I think I will skip the chocolate chips all together. I only baked them for 20 minutes since I like my brownies more fudge-like. Would be perfect topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzled with caramel. A keeper recipe for sure.

These were FANTASTIC! Great brownie consistency, taste great hot and after being in the fridge. I used chopped pecans, instead of walnuts, and no chocolate. Brought them to my office and they were gone in literally 4 minutes.

Yum Yum Yum! More like a cookie than anything. I would have doubled the recipe had I known how little volume it made. I only had a pinch of walnuts left so maybe thats where my volume was missing not sure. Very tasty though!

I finally did this recipe correctly. One small step caused it to always fall - sifting the flour. It made a world of difference between the last batch and this one. This is by far the best I've made. Great with homemade vanilla ice cream.

Great recipe, very simple.  The only change I made (and I do this often) is I subbed two tbsp of unsweetened applesauce for two of the tbsp of butter.  These turned out great!

i didnt have chocolate chips so i substituted a chopped up toblerone bar. it came out delicious nonetheless. next time i will use less walnuts (came out a little too crunchy for my liking) but other than that a very simple and easy recipe that i delicious! i will definitely be using it again, i think this recipe would also make great cookies.

I was looking for a blondie recipe, and this one had the best reviews.  So, I tried it, plain -- no nuts or chocolate chips.  Doubled the recipe (the batter was heavenly!), baked in a 9x13 for 26 mins.  Looked done, so I took it out -- only to find it fallen after 10 mins.  So, it's back in the oven, covered so it doesn't dry out.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it works.  I have high hopes for this recipe, and I'll definitely keep it handy.

As suggested I doubled the recipe. GREAT idea. Everyone loved them. One tip add more than 1 cup of chips. I made it again and doubled the chips by 2.5 and it made a differance.

Very good.  The NEXT time I make these, I will use less vanilla.  A tablespoon is just too much for me.

I doubled the recipe and used wheat flour....they were excellent.  I did cook them for a little less time than the recipe called for and they came out better than the first time when I didn't double the recipe and cooked them for the time the recipe called for.

Left out the nuts, doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan and mixed the choc chips in (instead of putting on top).  Brought to a party and they were the first dessert to disappear!

Perfect blonde brownie!  There's no need to change anything, except I had to substitute pecans for the walnuts, as I'm allergic.  Easy, too.  A definite keeper.

I'm at ~5000ft in Denver so I need to cut down on the oil, add a little more flour,etc.  I haven't optimized the high altitude version yet - but I'm sure once I do these will be excellent! Not the author's fault for the recipe not working perfectly at altitude.  :)

Really nice chewy texture, and not too sweet. I doubled the recipe and baked for 30 mins. (microwave/oven) I used a 70% cocoa, which really gave it a rich chocolate lovers taste.

This is great base recipe. I used a tad more salt and a bit less vanilla. Also used 3/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup white. Baked at 325 for 25 min. Came out like a "cookie bar".Very tasty.

this is amazing! i have to admit though, my first try, i used brown sugar and somehow it just didn't cut it. this time, i used red sugar (i don't know if it's the same as the brown sugar though) and i just love the results (it tastes different, i tell ye)! it's soft and chewy! and amazingly... mmm~

I followed the recipe exactly but baked them in a 8x8 pan and omited the nuts. They turned out ok and had a light almost butterscotch type taste. I was expecting them to be a little less cake like then they turned out but all in all they were ok.

I followed everything in the recipe except I mixed in the chocolate chips and used and 8x8 pan. I cooked them about 27 minutes to make up for the pan size. Straight out of the oven these turned out really well and were baked perfectly (kinda worried about how they will be later b/c of what others are saying). Anyway, the only reason that I am giving these 3 stars is because they do not taste like brownies at all. They have the same consistency, flavor, everything of chocolate chip cookies except they are in bar form. If that's what you like, make this recipe. If you want brownies make something else.

I followed this recipe exactly and it did not come out gooey or at all brownie-like.  It was much more like a bar cookie and got hard like a cookie by the next day.  It tasted good, but was not what I expected.

The texture of these brownies were perfect and everything I look for in a brownie - soft, chewy, and moist in the center with just the right amount of crisp at the edge.  But this is the best the recipe gets as it lacks flavor. I don't know how some reviewers said this was too rich or too sweet because it was not sweet enough for me.  Maybe since I replaced egg beaters eggs for shelled egg and omitted the chocolate chips, the flavor failed.

I have to agree with the earlier reviewers.  This recipe is great and I didn't have to go scouting for tips on making it good.  Follow as is!

I've never had a blondie before and they tasted like I thought they would. Very yummy!!! I didn't melt the butter before mixing with sugar and I used salted butter and omitted the salt. I used a round cake pan. The only thing that was off was the baking time, it took 45 min for mine to bake nice, the edges raised up alot and it browned quite a bit but that could just be the pan I used. Still though they came out just like a blondie should and they will not last very long. Thanks for sharing!

I made these without the chocolate chips... and even without the chocolate chips they were entirely way too sweet. I think it is a good Blonde recipe but next time I will cut the sugar WAYYYY down. Very chewy though...but too sweet much for me.

Pretty Tasty. But it was more of a cookie bar than a brownie in texture.

My boyfriend and his family absolutely LOVED these! I doubled the recipe, and I used butter flavored Crisco instead of butter and used a whole cup of it. It came out too greasy for my taste, so next time I plan on using just what is called for. This is the best recipe of all the ones I've tried!

Super easy and delicious. I add a handful of marshmallows which add a nice sweetness and chewiness. I also use jumbo semi-sweet chocolate chips. A great dessert when you don't have a lot of time. Also, it can be made with ingredients that are usually in the pantry already.

DELICIOUS!  Just made for a rainy day activity.  These are wonderful!  I made these as per the recipe, except did not use nuts and instead STIRRED in 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips and 1/4 cup milk chocolate chips.  They are so ooey inside with a perfect golden crispy top.  These sliced beautifully.  I will make these again and again.

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars b/c of the amount of prep work.  Since I'm an extreme novice in the kitchen, all the flour sifting (twice!), egg beating, butter melting added time and extra bowls!  The result was good though - except a tad heavy on the vanilla.  I made this twice, the first time in an 8x8 glass pan and the second time I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 glass dish (I also cut the vanilla in half the second time).  Both times created a thick blondie so you have to watch your cooking time.  Baking is a little tough b/c you want the middle done but the top and outside edges not burned.  Use a toothpick in the middle and let it almost totally cool before cutting - otherwise the middle falls apart.

this is the best dessert! i've made it about 15 times since i found it a couple years ago, for all kinds of parties and dinners. it's always been a real crowd-pleaser. i just put baking m&m's instead of chocolate chips though.

These were fantastic!!!! I loved these. They were chewy and rich. Though, I think a better name would be chocolate chip cookies. But for those of you with convection ovens, i put them in for 14 minutes and they were perfect

This was my first time making blonde brownies and we had to alter it a bit due to not having choc chips in the house. I added about 1/2 c. peanut butter chips & 1/2 c. butterscotch chips and then I sprinkled the top with what I had left of some toffee bits (about 1/2 c.). I baked them in a 9 x 9 pan for about 25 mins and they were AMAZING!!! The peanut butter & butterscotch chips tasted great blended together & the toffee chips gave them a nice chewy topping. I will definately make these again!

This tasted just like a chocolate chip cookie. No complaints I love cookies! I made this just like it said but I left out the nuts because we had company coming over and wasn't sure if they liked nuts.However I did have one problem...When I took it out of the oven the middle fell. Im not sure why, it tasted great esp. with vanilla ice cream.

Growing up, my grandmother used to bake us blonde brownies every time she visited. As a result, only a "blondie" is, to me, a true brownie. I thought this recipe tasted ok, but it certainly lacked the rich flavor of a truly decadent blonde in my opinion. I may try it again, but I'm not sure where to start on the recipe. It needs work. Certainly not "bad", though.

I loved the texture of these... nice and ooey gooey, but I do think they were a bit on the rich side! (Although didn't keep me from eating way too many)!  Like them, just if you're not into very sweet and rich blondies, this isn't the right recipe for you.

These tasted great, however mine didn't rise at all. I followed all the directions as written, and baking for 22 minutes the edges were almost crispy and the center had the consistency of soft chocolate chip cookies. Not surprising, as another member mentioned, the same recipe is used on this site for cookies. I'll try another recipe next time and see if I have better luck with the brownies not staying mushy.

these were very tasty but had a bit of a cakey/cookie texture rather than a dense chewy brownie.  i mixed in the choco chips and that helped... i think i'll try again and mix in that same amount of butterscotch chips in addition to the choco.  i realize that will make them very rich, but isn't that what a brownie is supposed to be?!  it will also add some more chewy texture.

Delicious! Only thing I omitted was the walnuts.  I also mixed the choc chips in. These were gone within a matter of minutes! Great recipe.

It tasted good but I found it to be a little dry and the brownie fell apart. Not at all like the pictures. I followed the recipe exactly so....

These were very good, but I thought there was too much vanilla, I will reduce it next time.  I mixed in the chocolate chips instead of sprinkling on top. I think next time I will do that again, but sprinkle some on top as well.  I LOVED the consistency of these, they were nice & chewy.

These were awesome!!!  My entire family loved them and the pan was almost gone in the first night.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of mixing in the chocolate chips and baking in an 8x8 greased pan.  I cooked them for 23 minutes and they were perfect.  The few we had left were not hard the following day either as previous reviews suggested. Will definitely be making again soon!  Edited to add: I've made these several times now.  I double the recipe (except keep the vanilla and salt the same and use about 3/4c chips) and bake in a 9x13 for 25min.

First time I heard of these and first attempt at making them.  Turned out more cakelike than brownie like but was good anyway.  My family voted to make again and have with vanilla ice cream.  I stirred in the chocolate chips and sprinkled a handful on top, which was perfect.  Did not harden like some reviews stated, I stored the leftovers in an airtight container and they were great the next day as well.

These are sooo good! I literally pulled them out of the oven within the last hour!  I have already eaten two and would probably eat more if it wasn't so late into the night!  I have never made blondies before, but have had them at restaurants and these are just as good, if not better! Thank you so much for this recipe!  I took others' advice and doubled the recipe minus the baking powder to make a full 9x13 pan.

Sooo good! I have never even heard of these, but it was a quick and easy recipe, so I gave it a try. I substituted chopped pecans because my husband prefers those. Other than that I followed the recipe. My whole family loved these, and I plan to make them often!!

Delicious recipe.  These were very rich but we loved the sweetness for the brown sugar and vanilla.  I did double to recipe for a 9x13 pan which made it take quite a bit longer to cook.  Be sure to check it closely before you take it out of oven because they are quite dense.  The first time I made them I took them out to quick and they werent quite done.  Thanks for the recipe!

good with strong coffee.  co-workers liked them - altho they didn't empty the pan like they normally do.  I was disappointed that the leftovers hardened quickly, even when not refrigerated (as per previous comments).  I thought they were too sweet, but I'm also not a major sweets eater either.

Fantastic recipe! I doubled the recipe, like most reviewers said. I used up two sticks of butter in the process (might as well use it up). I substitute thawed frozen blueberries for the chocolate chips, then made sundaes by topping blondie squares with vanilla ice cream and drizzled it with blueberry syrup (which you can find in the breakfast aisle with the pancake syrup). They were a hit! Will definitely make again!

I made these for my  husband and his friend and they both liked them very much!  I mixed 1/3 c. of the chocolate chips into the batter and sprinkled 1/3 c. on top.  (I left out the nuts due to allergies.)  Very easy to put together and very good!

Wow! I'm pleasantly surprised!  I tried these on a whim for my husband's bday, and they were great.  The only modification I made was to sub milk chips for semi-sweet.  It was all I had, and they turned out fabulous.  I baked these in an 8x8x2.  Perfection.

FANTASTIC!! I almost always bake chocolate-themed desserts, but I tried this and now it's one of the best desserts I've ever made!!  Very moist and soft, and the chocolate is a nice complement to the bar overall. Will most DEFINITELY be making these again.

1.  I doubled the recipe
2.  I used 1.5 cups brown, .5 white sugar
3.  Used a little milk choco chips with the semi sweet.  
4.  Used chopped Pecans

Everything else as is.

Excellent recipe, cooked 25 mins at 350 and it seriously is perfection

*edit Tried the recipe today using 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar and it came out even better. I love this recipe its so quick and easy, especially if you are craving chocolate.

These were very easy. I used room temp butter (1/2 cup) and an 8X8X2 pan, cooked 25 minutes. They were nicely thick, and still soft and chewy after 24 hours. My husband was skeptical since he loves my regular brownies, but he's a skeptic no more!! These are a wonderful change from traditional brownies. I think a full stick of butter is a must!

These are pretty good.  I used bitter sweet chocolate chips, otherwise I made exactly as the recipes was written.

These are yummy and gooey and oh-so good!  I have searched for a blondie recipe that is chewey instead of cakey and this is the best I have found.  I do not use the chocolate chips, as they are fantastic just on their own.

My whole family loved these.  I scaled the recipe to 12 servings to fit my 11 X 7 pan.  Found this recipe when I wanted a quick baked dessert but did not have chocolate for brownies.  Substituted chopped peanuts for the walnuts, and peanut butter chips for the chocolate chips.  Also drizzled dark chocolate Hershey's syrup over the top and swirled it with a knife before baking.  I did have to bake it for 45 minutes - probably due to the larger pan I used.

What a hit. Made this into a sheet cake (looked just like a cookie bar cake)and it was a hit for my nephew's 9th birthday. Just added the chips into the mix instead of on top. Perfect, chewy, soft, moist....yummy! I will make again

These Blondies were so good! The brownies were moist and had great flavor. I did take the advice of other reviewers and doubled the recipe so I could make it in a 9 X 13 pan. I baked it for 28 minutes and all I can say is they came out perfect. Thanks!!

Nice change of pace from the traditional brownie. These have the perfect chewy texture and were great mixed in ice cream sundaes at our Labor Day bbq.

Perfect blondie recipes. Very moist and chewy. The only change i made was instead of milk chocolate chips and walnuts, i added white chocolate chips and macadamia nuts. I mixed them both in with the flour mixture so they wouldn't sink to the bottom. You won't be disappointed with this recipe!

After reading previous reviews I was expecting much more of a WOW when tasted.  Sorry to say this seemed just average, and I have to agree w/ other reviews that said it lacked flavor.  I added this to my recipe box, but will now be deleting.

i have made these many times and they always turn out perfect. i like them best with mini choc. chips mixed in (mix in with the flour so they dont sink to the bottom) i also leave out the nuts. then i add a small handfull of mini choc. chips to the top before baking.

My kids love these as a non-chocolatey dessert. A good alternative to brownies, and they're still very rich since there's so much brown sugar in them.

So these came out of the oven about twenty minutes ago and already the pan is missing one or two rows since the last time I was in the kitchen. I took the advice of many reviewers and doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13. (Probably a good thing or they'd already be gone :) )This recipe is delicious...Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe! Everyone loves them! I did quite calling them blond brownies, though. By adding the chocolate chips, everyone thinks they are bar cookies. Either way - blond brownies or chocolate chip bar cookies - they are amazing!

Awesome recipes! Per previous reviews, I too doubled the recipe and put it into a 9x13 dish and I am glad I did! More for us! Because my husband cannot have chocolate, I used butterscotch chips. The brownie came out perfect and smelled wonderful! Will definitely be making again

These were ok but I was expecting so much more.  They seemed way undercooked so I ended up leaving them in longer.  Good but not great after the longer baking time.

Used Spectrum shortening (palm oil) + 1 tbsp. hot water and chopped up Baker's semi-sweet chocolate instead of the chips. These were gooey and rich, but delicious.

Excellent flavor, chewy texture, and overall great blonde brownie.  This is a tasty treat that any cookie and brownie lover will enjoy.  I would definitely make this again though next time I would double the recipe to fit into the pan that I put it in.  5 stars!

Fantastic!  I used cinnamon chips instead of chocolate and mixed them right in the batter.  I didn't use nuts either.  The bones of the recipe are awesome!  The house smelled fantastic while these bars were baking!
Update...I made these again using cinnamon chip again.  Amazing!  This time I sprinkled a little cinnamon into the flour mixture.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan for 35 minutes.  AMAZING!

I made this recipe with my mother: we thought that it looked worthy of Easter Desert: and let me just say: it was definetley worthy. This was the best brownie recipe I have ever eaten ! I kept everything the same, but I left out the walnuts for personal preferences.

I thought these would really satisfy my sweet tooth but they weren't what I was expecting.  They tasted like undercooked chocolate chip cookies. Perhaps it needed a longer baking time or maybe I missed an ingredient (I doubt it).   I'll probably try again.

This is the 2nd time I've made these and think I figured out the trick, once you add the eggs (I doubled the recipe) you need to incorporate well so they turn out fluffy. The first time around I simply mixed them quickly and they came out very flat. Now I love them!! Thank you!!

There were very good, nice and chewy.  I halved the salt as some suggested, and baked in an 8x8 pan.  I may try using all baking powder next time (instead of soda), as they did not rise very much - but they were definitely a hit!  yum!

I thought they were pretty bland, and I had even increased the chocolate chips and added walnuts as well.  Not as good as I was hoping, though they stayed very moist when I kept them in the pan, covered with saran wrap.

These were really too sweet for my taste and that's pretty hard to do.  I used mostly semi-sweet chips w/ a handful of butterscotch chips and it may have been the butterscotch that was too much for me.  My husband ate them up, but of course he wouldn't let any sweets go to waste :)

I am pregnant and total craved blondies and whipped these up in a flash...baked in a glass pie dish & sprinkled with peanut butter/chocolate swirl chips.  So chewy and blondie perfection.  Love these and now I have a staple to whip up the next craving!!

This was quick and easy.  Had all the ingredients on hand.  I mixed in a handful of peanut butter chips, and topped it with a handful of chocolate chips.  I did follow some previous reviews and cut the salt and vanilla down a tad.  This is a definite keeper!

A little salty... Maybe if you used unsalted butter the amount would be right, but otherwise I'd probably knock it back to 1/4 tsp.

These were great!  I made them last night and everyone had to go back for seconds.  I didn't have any walnuts, so they were nut free (although I think the nuts would have made them even better).  I only used 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla (thats all I had).  I also cooked them in an 8 by 8 pan greased pan (the instructions didn't indicate whether or not to spray the pan).  I highly recommend these. I can't wait to make them again.

My hubby and I really liked this. Changes I made were that I doubled the recipe and baked in a glass 9x13 pan, sprayed with nonstick spray. I didn't use nuts. I used semisweet and butterscotch chips. This is really good and will make again. You can really taste the vanilla so if you aren't a big vanilla fan I would cut back. Thanks!

These were good, but they were way underdone even after cooking longer than directed. Unless I messed up something, I plan on adding more flour if I make these again.

Ohhh my gosh. I doubled the recipe and put in a 9x13 pan, put the chips in the batter, no nuts. I live in a house of 4 and the pan was half gone by morning (i made these at 11 PM), and didn't live to see 24 hours. AWESOME.

Yum - these were a smashing hit! I doubled for a 9x13 and they were still very thin, you may want to triple for that size pan. I also mixed the chips into the batter. What a great bar!

Just made these today and they were dense, chewy, and yummy!  I think the secret to keeping them chewy is to not over mix them.  Also I had to bake them longer then the recipe called for.  They baked for about 30-35 minutes at 350.  Don't take them out of the oven until a toothpick comes clean when you put it in the middle.

Mine came out more cakelike than chewy, but very tasty just the same!  I used white chocolate chips just for something different.  I think the recipe says to put the chips on top because they sink to the bottom if you stir them in.  Mine did!

Good chewy texture.  I did substitute oil for half of the butter, which I think helped bring the moisture level up in the blondies, which is how I like them.  Next time I'd use less vanilla (too overpowering as is for me) and fewer chocolate chips (the chocolate taste was to predominant for me).

this is a great recipe.  i stirred the chips into the mixture instead of putting them on top and doubled the recipe as others suggested.  they were delicious - a bit hard, but i think i overbaked.

I have to admit I almost chose another recipe but I'm so glad I didnt! These are great!  I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan. There didnt seem like there would be enough batter but it spread just fine. I sprinkled about a cup of semi-sweet chips on top, and next time I'll try and mix some into the batter also.  Definitely a keeper!

This is an excellent recipe.  The blonde part is buttery and brown sugar flavored.  It has a great chewy texture. All the flavors combined for a wonderful taste. Just one small piece with coffee was super satisfying and delicious.  I'll try it without the chocolate chips and a little more walnuts to see if it makes a great brown sugar nut bar.

This was so delicious and super easy to make! If these were brownies- I would say they were fudgey- but since there blondies I guess I would say they were rich and chewy. Very buttery and good!! Thanks for posting the recipe!

I read all of the reviews before baking and decided to cut down a bit on the powder to ensure more chewie/less cakey.
It worked great for me.

This recipe yields a wonderfully chewy, buttery brownie. I omitted the nuts and just put a few peanutbutter chips on the top before baking. This batch went fast-next time I'll definitely double the recipe.

Fantastic recipe. I did put in 1/2 the baking powder it calls for based on other reviews, and I omitted the nuts and chocolate chips due to diet constrictions and it was still absolutely wonderful.

These were sooo good. I used pecans instead of walnuts in one half of the batter, and only choc.chips in the other half, for those who do not like nuts. Mixed some of the chips inside, and some on top. after they cooled I drizzled some melted chocolate on top. Everyone loooved them, which is rare in my family!Thanks for sharing the recipe;)

I made these yesterday afternoon and it was fast and easy. They disappeared in less than an hour amazing! I made it in a small round glass pie pan, used only brown sugar. First it seemed a bit un- brownish to me, since it was more of a dough, not too liquid. I just distributed evenly on the pan and the result was great! It did have a brownie texture.

Ehh, this recipe was okay. The flavoring was okay but nothing to spectacular. I used peanut butter M&Ms on top instead and didnt use nuts since I am not a big fan of nuts with baked goods.

Very good brownies.  I left out the walnuts as my kids don't like them, and mixed the chocolate into the mix instead of sprinkling on top.  Also put 100's and 1000's sprinkles on 1/2 before baking, the kids love them.  Really easy to make too.

I followed the advice of others referencing the baking powder. Otherwise I followed the recipie, but it didnt turn out your typical brownie batter and more like cookie dough. Tasted okay, but Im not sure why it was more of a cookie form than brownies.

Mine came out only moderately acceptable... They never really puffed up as I expected; the chocolate chips just sat on top, never got absorbed.  They were also pretty crumbly when I tried to take them out of the pan.  Good flavor, though a bit disappointing overall.

These were delicious!  This was my first time making brownies from scratch AND the first time I tasted blondie brownies!  I'm glad I took the chance to try these out because everyone loved them!  The only downside was that my mom said that she could taste the baking powder, so I'll probably put a little less next time.  They were kinda hard when they cooled, but my mom thinks it has to do with the excess amount of the baking powder.  Thank you for the great recipe!  I will definitely make this again some time soon!

These were not bad but they were a bit more cakey than I like. If I made them again I would mix the chocolate chips with the batter instead of putting them on top. Also, I think they would be more flavorful using dark brown sugar. I sprinkled powdered sugar on top before serving.

I really wanted to like these. I only had about 2/3 cup brown sugar and made up the rest with white sugar. I don't think I cooked them long enough either. I mixed the choc. chips into the batter but they all sunk into the middle and melted making an interesting chocolate filling. Not what I had in mind. I thought it needed a bit more flour for body.  I may try again with the chips on top.

I used white chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and used oats in place of the walnuts because we don't like them.  I had to reduce heat a bit and bake a little longer because I used and 8x8 pan.  They are delicious and I'll make again.  Thanks!

These are just about the best thing I've ever tasted. The whole family begs me to make these. I mix 2/3 cup of mini chocolate chips in the batter and add another 1/3 cup of mini cinnamon chips..no chips on top. I also use Princess cake & cookie flavoring instead of vanilla. I grind pecans very fine and use them instead of walnuts. No pieces of nuts, but a yummy nutty taste thru the whole pan. These things are to die for! One of these days, I'm going to try them as drop cookies and see how they turn out. Sue, my whole crew thanks you for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and only the edges of the brownies cooked!  The middle was completely raw.  The only difference is that I used an 8x8 baking dish instead of a 9x9.  Could that have caused the problem?

This recipe is the same as my grandmother made when I was a child. I used a cast iron skillet to melt and combine the sugar as granny did. Also mixed white chocolate with butterscotch chips and mixed half in the batter. If you don't have nuts, wait until you do! They make the difference. simply awesome!

This was a super yummy recipie!  I needed to find something for my low stocked kitchen and I was surprised on what I got!  It bakes through perfectly and is chewy and not too sweet.  I added more chocolate chips in the batter and on top to make up for no nuts and it turned out perfect!  It lasts about one day and they are gone!  Thank you!

These brownies were so delicious. I doubled the recipe, only used a teaspoon of vanilla as others suggested, and baked them in a 9x12 foil pan. I should have made two pans, I will next time. Thanks for this wonderful, easy, delicious crowd pleaser!

This recipe is great...I used mini chocolate chips on top and they were super...its only my husband and I in our house and they were gobbled up in a day. I have e-mailed the recipe to my Mom and I am making them again today to serve to my Sister and her Husband arriving from out of town. Thanks for this recipe  :)
