This was so quick to prepare and was a great dish. I didn't have any cajun seasoning on hand so I made Traci's Adobo Seasoning from this site and it worked amazing on the chicken. I also forgot to add the oil but didn't seem to hurt. Cleanup was a breeze.

This dish is INCREDIBLE. It's so worth the 2 hour baking time. The chicken is incredibly tender to the point where even a butter knife is pointless to have and the onions are caramelized to absolute perfection. We chose to serve it with french cut green beans and Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice Original Recipe. An absolutely flawless dinner and definitely one of my new favorites!

This recipe rates 5 stars because it lead me to the modifications that made it a 5 star rating for my family. I omitted the onion salt and cream of mushroom and added dry onion soup mix and cream of chicken soup. Other than those changes I baked it for the 2 hours and the chicken was fork tender and the potatoes were soft and yummy. I will definitely be making this again...Delicious:)

I did change a lot of things about this recipe - it was just a jumping off point really! I at least doubled the recipe with 4 lbs of chicken - I never cook small quantities. Still that was just two 9x13 pans worth. I liked the other reviewer's idea about using Cream of Onion soup but I couldn't find any - so I used Cream of Potato (2 cans) mixed with 1 packet of onion soup mix. I omitted the quartered onion and used red potatoes. I'm not sure if something about the original ingredients requires a bunch of cook time but I could never have left my version in the oven for 2 hours!! It was pretty much done after 45 minutes (on 375) but I let it sit in there for about 10 additional minutes in case the piece of chicken and potato I tested were flukes. Anyway it was pretty good probably not a weekly staple or anything but not too difficult for my skill level! Hopefully someday I will find the CoO soup!

i'd like to give it 3.5 stars but we cant. this was good but the cajun mixed with the cream of mushroom soup just didnt taste right to me. and it was a little too reminiscent of baked gravy pork chops wich are only good in moderation or when you're really in the mood for them wich for me isnt too often. also this didnt take anywhere near 2 hours to cook.

I have made this as directed - using that "Traci's Adobo Seasoning" instead of Cajun as suggested by another chef. It was DELISH! Today I am trying it differently. I lined my 7 quart slow cooker with foil sprayed it with cooking spray used SIX peeled taters and added a couple drumsticks that I rolled in the flour and slid under the broiler for a few minutes on each side. I just wanted to make more portions and my hubby loves drumsticks. I lined the lid with foil and am cooking on low. I always broil drumsticks for a bit before slow cooking. I find that it helps to keep them from just falling apart.

My husband loved this so much he posted about it on facebook....Very minor changes. I used chicken quarters cream of chicken soup and chili powder instead of Cajun. Also sprinkled a pack of onion soup mix over the top.

This recipe was kind of bland. The chicken had no taste but the potatoes were yummy. I'm going to try this again but i'm gonna make some changes next time.

This was very good we cubed the potatoes but next time I would cut them even a little smaller or bake for a little longer as the potatoes were just barely done at the 2 hour mark. I also added a can of cream of chicken along with the cream of mushroom to make sure there was plenty of sauce otherwise I think it may have been little dry.

I made this for dinner tonight with some variations. I added frozen mixed vegetables to the onion and potatoes (which I sliced like scalloped potatoes) layer and I used a cup of chicken broth instead of water. I forgot to add the oil but not so sure it would've mattered. I didn't cover it with tin foil because I realized all to late that we were out and I cooked it uncovered for one hour at 350 degrees. Also I didn't put any Cajun or chili powder on top because I knew my family would not like that. Instead I sprinkled pepper and garlic powder on top with some butter pats. Overall I think it came out great! Would be a great dish to have on a cold night. Nice and hearty and good comfort food. I would have given it 5 stars but some of the potato slices were still crunchy. The tin foil might've helped but also think it could've used a touch more liquids.

I used frozen hash browns instead of potatoes. I would reduce the liquid because it came out a little soupy. I also added a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies. Very delicious!

This is a great dish to leave in the oven while at church. It needs some jazzing up so I plan to bell pepper to it next time. My daughter suggested broccoli would be a good addition.

Everyone at dinner tonight loved this recipe. I did substitute the Cream of Mushroom for Cream of Chicken and added a packet of Onion Soup Mix. Leave the salt out of the flour to cut back on a little of the saltiness. It was so tender and my chicken breasts were still slightly frozen and they cooked perfectly in 1 hour and 45 minutes. Potatoes were yummy and tender.

I made this in an instant pot pressure cooker. I used the exact ingredients and added one cup of celery. I cooked it for 40 min. Absolutely perfect. The sauce even thickened. It was a huge hit and I will definitely make it again.

This is my all time favorite recipe on Allrecipes. I have made this dish 5 times already and am going to keep making it. My family LOVES this dish. I have never had chicken come out so tender and juicy and the potatoes and onions were perfectly cooked every time. I would not change one thing on this dish.

I made it to recipe. I found it a bit bland and added more salt. But then I also got terrible heartburn which is unusual for me. I would maybe choose a different spice group than cajun and also I would replace the oil with butter. Really though you can't go wrong with baking chicken in any kind of cream soup with a wide mix of veggies too.

Awesome recipe! Easy to make and really tasty. I used chicken broth instead of water and mixed some black pepper in with the cream of mushroom mixture. I substituted the black pepper with the Cajun seasoning to the flour mixture. Lastly I used chicken breast tenders instead of full chicken breasts.

This is a great recipe with a few modifications. I added carrots and stalks of celery. Instead of Cajun seasoning I used southwest chipotle. Baked it for 2 hours at 325 covered in foil then 45 minutes at 300 uncovered. A big hit that will be made again and again.

This is a yummy dinner my whole family loves it. I did make some changes because I didn't have exact ingredients. I omitted the onions and used southwest chipotle seasoning instead of cajun. I submitted a picture and the seasoning is obvious; ). I also agree with other posts on cooking time I use the suggested 350 degrees but haven't cooked it longer then 1hr 45min and it has always been thoroughly cooked.

Didn't have cajun seasoning. Seasoned the chicken breasts I used with garlic powder and adobo and the chicken was still bland. Will probably make again but would definitely need to do something to season/taste up the chicken.

This was a very good and hearty meal my kids loved it and went into a food coma after dinner lol. I did modify the recipe slightly by substituting cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom soup because of what the kids prefer. It does take quite a long time to cook (2 hours) so you have to plan ahead.

This was very good. I used cream of chicken soup and paprika instead of cream of mushroom and Cajun seasoning. I also used gluten free flour instead of wheat flour. My husband loved it!
