I kind of cut the recipe in half. I was hoping that it would look 'greener' --- but with the RO TEL type tomatoes (I used a store brand diced tomatoes with jalapenos) it was more of a greenish yellow blah color. I didn't have any cream cheese but don't think that would have made any difference. I used fresh garlic (1 clove) and no salt (plenty in the canned tomatoes and I was serving with salted chips). The flavor was nice. After a taste test I decided to toss some fresh cilantro in. I think next time I'll add a jalapeno (without seeds/membrane) to kick it up a bit (or a few slices of jarred jalapenos) and/or cream cheese with jalapenos.

My family and I really enjoyed this dip. It's like a smooth guacamole. I did cut the salt and sour cream in half. Thank you for submitting it.
