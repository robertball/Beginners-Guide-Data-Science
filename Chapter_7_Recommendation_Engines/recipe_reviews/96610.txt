This nog will knock you on your butt!  It's almost like a liquor milkshake.  I had a hard time finding a bowl big enough to accomodate this large yield, I will reduce the recipe next time and likely 1/2 the liquor as well.  Easy to make, thick creamy texture.  Very good.

WOW! Finally found my lost Mississippi Eggnog recipe, here it is..Thanks. The only difference is instead of granulated sugar it uses powdered sugar so it mixes much easier..Once you try this recipe you will never use another.

I've always made Eggnog for Thanksgiving and Christmas and it's been an annual hit.  But, I never recorded the recipe and, over the years, drifted too far away from the base recipe to where it became average. So, this year I searched for a recipe that would bring me back and THIS IS IT!  Betty's Eggnog is as good, if not better, than mine ever was.  Absolutely fantastic!...if you think liquor is what defines a good Eggnog...which I do.  I used her recipe, but was a little more selective with the liquor: 1 bottle of American Honey, 1/2 bottle of Meyers dark rum, and VSOP brandy.  I also added an extra pint of heavy cream and a quart of half and half.  PERFECT!  Thank you Betty for bringing me back home to the perfect eggnog!  Good for breakfast, lunch, dinner and all thirsty periods in between...

Holy cow! This is SO good!I just finished making it and it is chilling now, but I had to sample. I wasn't sure what to do about folding in the eggwhites. They didn't really fully incorporate into the mixture, so I left it to chill with marble size bits of eggwhite still floating on the top.

This recipe is the bomb! I have been making several from this site over the past couple of weeks and they've all been good but this one...WOW! Drink responsibly with this. It will knock you out if you don't. I scaled this recipe down as a trial batch but I do believe this will be the winning recipe I'll make for my dad when he comes to visit on Christmas. Excellent eggnog and 5 stars all the way!

I've made this a few times and it's always a winner, but this time I misread the instructions and added the cream, half and half, and brandy to the egg whites instead of the yoke mixture. It turns out I like it this way better. The whole mixture was very smooth and creamy.

This is a great traditional eggnog recipe.  My mother used to make it every Christmas and I was searching for a recipe that used bourbon, rum and brandy like she did.  This is the eggnog I remember!
