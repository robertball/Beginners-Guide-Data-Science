I am the recipe submitter- for those of you that have been curious about the story that I'm referring to, it is out of an old Sesame Street alphabet book that was mine when I was a child.  The recipe was my own creation, but the story was the inspiration.  :). Hope this helps.

Light and lemony! A delicate, sweet little cookie that's perfect for any little princess to enjoy at tea parties along with her "imaginary" friends. These are so easy to make and while they aren't crisp but are more spongy and cake-like cookies they are none the less delicious. I did a lemon glaze on some, rolled a few in turbinado sugar before baking, and dusted others with powdered sugar just to change it up a bit. Overall, very good little cookies.

Knowing my preference for a crisp cookie i left out 1 egg.  I got a crisp thin cookie with a great lemon flavor.  Thanks.

Really tasty! A little spongy and soft for my intent (shipping half way across the globe) but darn tasty for home. I made a simple syrup of Lemon Juice and white sugar, dipped a fork in it, and pressed each dough ball down with the dipped fork, and it made a nice little crunchy pattern on top. I then drizzled the syrup on the cookies fresh out of the oven. YUMMY!

These are fantastic lemon cookies!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I was a little nervous after reading the reviews that I would end up with spongey or cakey cookies, but they were perfect...light and slightly chewy. I definitely recommend drizzling the cookies with the glaze that the recipe poster suggests in the first review.

I didn't have any lemon to zest on hand, so I substituted with a tbsp of lemon peel and about 1/2 tsp of lemon extract. I don't know how it compares to the original recipe, but it was really super.  Great, soft, spongy cookies - fit for a princess, indeed!

I usually don't rate recipes-- most of the ones I try already have tons of glowing reviews and I figure there's no need really.  But I came looking for a lemon cookie recipe, found these, and tried them.. even though there weren't all that many reviews.  I am so glad I did!  They were perfect.  I have to disagree with anyone who thought they were a little too spongey, a little too lemony, sweet, whatever.  I wouldn't have changed one single thing and my entire family (including my 70-year-old mom and my 2-year-old daughter) kept coming back for more.  Yay!  I bet this recipe sky rockets in popularity in the coming months.

Definitely light, fluffy and delicious - but I was hoping for a stronger lemony taste. I can barely taste it after baking.

This cookie is wonderful!  They were as much a delight to make as they were to eat.  I love lemon, so for the glaze I mixed 2 cups of powdered sugar with the zest AND juice of one lemon (approximately 1/4 cup of juice).  It came out a little runny but after glazing I set them out on trays for a few hours and the glaze hardened nicely.  Its a pretty tart glaze though, so I only dabbed a little bit on each one.

THese cookies are so cute!!! the glaze is amazing; it's a must have! THe cookies were good, but they were very lemony to me. My little girl (2.5 yrs.) absolutly loved these. She kept sneeking in the kitchen and grabbing handfuls of them off the counter. She loved them...

I used 1/2 c butter, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, i always do that in cookies so it won't crack. other than that, these are perfect..!! I'm sure these cookies will find their way to top 20 recipes in this site. Great, fluffy, not too sweet, lemony taste. hubby raved about them (he's a lemon lover)...enjoy them :)

These were pretty good. I was expecting a more shortbread-like cookie after looking through the pictures, so I was surprised at how cakey these came out. I had the hardest time ever rolling the dough into balls. I even refrigerated it overnight, but I had to heavily flour my hands and counter before I could roll them. This was frustrating to me, so I ended up only rolling about two dozen balls before I gave up and pressed the rest of the dough into my 7" x 11" baking pan to make a bar type cookie. Now, I wish I had rolled it all into balls, because the cookies came out pretty cute, after I drizzled them with a lemon-powdered sugar glaze and sprinkled them with yellow sugar. Not sure if I'd make these again, as they were quite a pain to roll out. They are pretty good, though, so we shall see. Thanks for sharing!

Wow, this is an excellent recipe for lemon cookies!  I followed the recipe exactly and decided to follow the suggestion of rolling the ball of uncooked dough in sugar.  After baking and tasting the cookie, I then decided to follow the other suggestion of making a glaze with fresh lemon juice and drizzling it over the cooled cookies.  Bingo!  Thats the winning combo!  The sugar gives it a slightly crackly texture, and the glaze gives it that additional zing of lemon.  This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent! One of the best cookies I've made in a long time. I used egg replacer powder and they baked up absolutely beautifully. I really wanted a noticeable lemon flavor so I added 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract and doubled them lemon zest. I rolled them in sugar before baking which gave them a wonderful crisp outside. I will make again and again! Highly recommended. Thanks!

It's important you make them as small as you can, and possibly leave out the egg, otherwise they turn out too spongey. The flavors are nice.

Good enough as is, better with the lemon juice glaze suggested by the submitter.  Still, even tho' I reduced the eggs called for by half for a crisper cookie as another reviewer did, I still found these too soft for my liking.  In addition, even tho' I doubled the amount of lemon zest called for, I can't say these had a bold lemon flavor.   In fact, I have to say that these actually had kind of a doughy, or floury taste. On the plus side, they turned out perfectly round and cute.

Delicious with the icing over the  top, but must be eaten within 24 hours of coming out of the oven or they're stale.

Yummy!  These have a very delicate flavour and are not too sweet.  They are very spongey which I wasn't expecting but isn't a bad thing.  These would be great with tea!

These were very easy and very good.  For my taste, I would increase the lemon flavor with more zest.  They also would benefit from a lemon glaze on top.

These were so good that my fiance had no issues eating these cookies with such a girly name ;)  I love lemon, so these little gorgeous cookies were such a treat.  I agree with the reviews saying that you really need the lemon icing for that extra kick of lemon because the cookies on their own are a bit plain... but add the icing and WHOA!

I am a terrible baker, but I make these cookies exactly like the recipe, and they are better than any cookie I've bought from a bakery.  They key is fresh lemon juice (not  bottled) and the zest.  Also use fresh lemon juice in the glaze.  I sprinkeled confectioners sugar on half of them and that was delicious too.  Thanks for raising my baking self-esteem amd for the awesome and easy recipe.

Made them, loved them!!!  I was looking for a delicate little cookie to give my daughters teacher as a back to school gift and these were perfect.   Used 1/2c butter and 1/2c oil. Didn't measure the juice just used two small lemons and the zest of course. Used a teaspoon to measure and didn't make them any bigger than that. This recipe yielded me about 80 little cookies. Great lemon flavor.  Rolled them in white sugar and they were devoured!

These are absolutely divine. I followed the recipe exactly as written. They are light and fluffy, and contrary to other reviews, I found them to have a delightful lemon flavor.  I made them for an outdoor wedding reception. The only problem was making sure my family did not eat them all before the event.

The first couple of times I made these they turned out tasty slightly too doughy/floury to me, so I tend to add a little extra sugar. The glaze I use is a 1:4 ratio of lemon juice and confectioners sugar which gives it a nice tart zing especially when combined with a little lemon zest. This quickly became a favorite recipe of mine since I grew up obsessed with lemon cookies which i had been unable to find in stores since childhood. I took another reviewers advice and used a fork to press the tops down a little which added a really nice crisp. I always end up craving these cookies!

Good texture but very Bland tasting. Did not have the great lemon flavor that I was looking for. Would not make again. If I did, I would add a lot more lemon.

SO GOOD! I made the recipe as written. People who ate them said they were better than delicious. The lemon flavor is so nice, and they're wonderfully soft. I rolled some in white sugar, some in turbinado sugar, and left some plain. They were all good! I love these cookies!

These didn't disappoint! I made them pretty small, so I got twice the number indicated in the recipe. 95 little, bite sized cookies! I used fresh lemons and lots of zest and they are just lemony enough. My family and I love lemon, so I really wanted to make sure the flavor came through. They are soft and cakey, not chewy as some have said. I made the glaze for over top as indicated in the description, but also added zest to the glaze. Try them out!

Not bad, but it tastes more sweet than lemony to me.  I think it's probably due to my rolling htem in sugar, but they were just too sticky not to.  Pretty, though, if you can keep them from spreading in wierd directions, which is what mine did.  Easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family, in general, loves lemon-esque cookies. But this cookie takes the cake! (Pun intended) My oldest daughter requested cookies and no cake for her high school graduation party and this was one of 10 different types of cookies we had on hand (not an estimate, actual number) cookies we had. These cookies were gone first. Except for the stash I later found out my daughter left unserved so she could snack on them for the next week! She imposed a 6 cookie/per day limit on herself and was still sad to see the last one go! These cookies are easy to make, delicious & obviously keep well! Try them

These cookies definitely need the lemon glaze on top. The texture is nice, but if you are looking for a strong lemon flavor you probably need to add more lemon zest (I added the zest of 4 lemons in the cookie and one in the glaze!). Sitting overnight really helped bring out the lemon flavor. I found the dough was much less sticky and the cookies held their shape better if the dough chilled at least an hour.

These cookies are delicate, yummy little morsels! They took 10 minutes to bake in my oven. I also made a glaze to drizzle with 1 cup of powdered sugar, lemon juice, and a little vanilla. Scrumptious! This fresh lemon cookie recipe is a keeper! Thank You for sharing MrsParkerII!

I made these cookies in honor of our dear Marianne's Birthday in January. They are a very easy "shortbread" type cookie or butter cookie with a hint of lemon. I did like them very much, but was expecting a real HIT of lemon flavor and it just wasn't that lemon-y. That's the ONLY reason I gave this recipe 4 Stars instead of 5. Next time, I think I'll use more lemon juice and zest. And, I also think I'll ice them with a lemon glaze next time too. They are worthy of making again.

These are delicious MRSPARKERII!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us!  These are now my new favorite cookies, and everyone else absolutely loves them!  I was wondering what the story is that goes along with these cookies.  I know that would make these even more special to the kids.  Thanks so much again!

These are fantastic! I used a cookie scoop after chilling and chilled the dough in between each batch-- both of which really helped with the "sticky-ness." I also followed the reviews for the glaze. These glazed cookies are sooo good!

Very tasty. I have also made this recipe subbing in grapefruit zest and grapefruit juice for the lemon and it is equally delicious. For a bit of fun, I make this (and many other cookies) on my waffle iron instead of baking.

I don't think anyone in my household has ever agreed so wholeheartedly on a dessert.  These cookies are just perfect -- they bake up soft and they STAY soft.  I brushed them with a glaze made of powdered sugar, fresh lemon juice, and vanilla.   They're still perfectly fresh after being in the fridge for 3 days.  I will definitely make these over and over again.

I absolutely love this recipe. I used limes instead of lemons and they had a wonderfully sharp citrus taste. The cookies were soft and cake-y, even days after they were baked. The glaze really makes the cookie. I used slightly more lime so that it wouldn't have such a delicate flavor. Overall, I'll definitely be making these again.

I didn't have lemon zest so I grated the skin of an orange. I also did the lemon and sugar syrup and dipped fork into then flattened cookie dough a bit with it before cooking and then drizzled after out of oven while on cookie sheet cooling. Yes, this was yummy. Thank you submitter and reviewer for the great recipe.

These are awesome little cookies, but they definitely take about 15 minutes to bake if you use a tablespoon to measure the dough. And they are SO good with a lemon glaze!!!

Yum! A light lemon flavor, just enough to make it interesting.  I used all wheat flour, xylitol, and replaced half the butter with a butter replacement and it was still great, though I am unable to comment on the texture of the original recipe as a result. I did not top them with anything, they work well plain. I will be making these again.

Such an interesting cookie! The dough was so light and fluffy. They were a tad "egg-y" for me, which isn't so much my favourite, but they were nice. I made the glaze, which was a great addition. Definitely a princess cookie :)

What a great cookie! Subtle lemon flavor and a great texture. My family loved them. I am guessing that these will be requested again. No changes necessary.

These have a really nice lemon flavor! They remind me of the old Girl Scout cookies (not sure if GS still sell that kind?) as far as flavor goes with a hint of shortbread cookie flavor. The texture is mix between a muffin and cornbread- It's good though. I like soft cookies. I wasn't sure how they'd be when people said "spongy," that sounded a little gross to me, but they're not funky. I can tell I will be craving these again soon. Thanks!

These are the best cookies ever! I made them for my wedding day and they were so amazing! Everyone raved about them. I used fresh lemons for the juice. They are delicious with and without the glaze. My husband and I didn't get enough of them so I'm making us some! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Made these again. Now our friends are hooked! Absolutely devine! I’m taking these to a quilting retreat Friday. I will be sure to bring the recipe!

I have used this recipe multiple times and every time it's amazing! I have tried different combinations of coatings/drizzles/toppings and the one I like the best is to roll the cookies in sugar before baking and then coat with the lemon juice/confectioner's sugar glaze while they're cooling. It's a definitely worth the extra time and effort. I've had friends and family call these "crack cookies" when made as just cookies and my personal favorite: "danger pops"  when I use this recipe for cookie pops (because they're dangerously delicious!).

I didn't have baking soda but did have baking powder, so I went with that and hoped for the best. I'm sure real cooks are shaking their heads but they actually turned out pretty darn good, just a bit on the doughy side. I also halved the salt per other reviewers and glad I did. I frosted them with Carol's Lemon Icing, on AllRecipes. Once they completely cooled, the doughiness firmed up more and they were little bursts of lemony heaven. Can't stop popping em'!

Great cookie. Turned out perfect. I cut the recipe in half. I didn't have any lemons on hand so used a bottle of lemon juice. I upped the juice a little just to be sure i had enough lemon flavor. Even though I bumped up the lemon a bit the lemon flavor was very light - almost imperceptible. Still very good. Also,I would recommend rolling them in sugar. It gives a nice sparkle to them and makes them a bit crispy. I used vanilla sugar I had handy for the coating.

the lemon flavor is very subtle, it's nice with a little more lemon juice/zest. i also tried out using only 1/2 cup butter and they were even better.

They came out nice and fluffy, more like mini-cakes than cookies.  
Made it almost exactly as the recipe described, except  I didn't have a lemon, so I just did without the lemon zest (oh and I used margarine instead of butter since I was out of butter).  
One small error in the recipe - don't preheat the oven as the first step since the dough has to chill for 30 minutes before baking.

These are SO yummy. Left the dough in fridge for twice as long.  Only issue I had was that they spread out too much so I ended up making tiny little balls and and they were perfect. Made a lemon glaze with powdered sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla. They  are for a baby shower tomorrow and I think the ladies will love them!

I made several types of cookies, this was the favorite by far. Instead of lemon, I used orange zest and juice. I also made an orange glaze. Because there wasn't too much colour, I added coloured sugar sprinkles.

These were not sweet and did not taste like lemon. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added extra lemon juice. They stuck to the cookie sheet even though I greased it.

I just made these tonight.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out perfect and delicious.  I did roll them in sugar and I also drizzled them with lemon glaze.  I colored the glaze green for a Christmas theme.  Perfect taste, perfect cookie, my family loves them!!!

This dough was ridiculous to work with. Not enough time in the fridge and it is too sticky.. too much time in the fridge and it's too crumbly. For me, the end result is just an OK cookie. Not lemony enough and that's after adding extra zest. Hopefully the lemon drizzle will add a little more flavor to it.

This recipe is great! Super simple, and quite delicious.  I followed other suggestions, and doubled the amount of lemon zest.  I made some plain, but I also tried rolling them in sugar beforehand, and on others I used powdered sugar.  The rolled in sugar beforehand is definitely a winner.  I didn't get to try the glaze, as I ran out of lemon, but both my husband and I think that the crispy of the sugar coated topped with the glaze sounds like it would be amazing!

Absolutely FABULOUS cookies. My girlfriend came over and had a 'tea party' with the kids and they needed some cookies! Well, I wanted something that would satisfy them but that wouldn't cause me a lot of hassle, so I found these and they LOVED THEM. A quick and easy recipe that became a classic for our household. I now make them every time my girlfriend visits!

This recipe was perfect! I needed a light, tangy, and sweet dessert to stress-bake, and I am so glad I found this. The lemon juice and zest were the perfect amount. I didn't have butter, so I used canola oil instead and baked it until the edges were golden. Otherwise, it was perfect! Would definitely bake this again (hopefully under calmer conditions).

Made exactly as written and can you say yum,  I rolled some in sugar and some with the lemon glaze the submitter suggested.  My child who doesn't like lemon, loved and I mean loved the ones rolled in sugar, my other daughter and I prefer the one with the glaze.  1 recipe, lots of happy people.  So good with tea, a quick snack or on the go.  Great recipe.

These are delicious.  We didn't have the stuff to make the glaze the fist time and just had them plain-they were still so good that all 4 batches were gone.  We have a very big family, but still!  Everyone requested them again soon after an that time we made the glaze then sprinkled powdered sugar over very lightly....gone again that same night!   They also taste good with orange zest if you don't have a lemon, it actually makes for a stronger citrus flavor since some said the flavor was too light.

Updated 4/25/2016 - I've made these quite a few times, but not in a while. I just picked a bunch of lemons and was having a cookie craving so went back to this recipe. This time I zested 2 lemons and only used 1 egg. I do think they turned out a little less spongy. Still a favorite since so easy and tasty. 
Original review: Really nice and light with mild lemon flavor. I made the confectioner sugar and lemon icing, but I liked them better without it. I really liked this cookie!

These cookies are great! I used lime juice because I did not have lemons. And I did not use the zest, for time's sake... So I used some lemon extract, too! :) They were great!

These are sooo good. I made mine bigger (I have princes, not princesses) and baked them about 9-10 minutes. Like others said, they are much better with the glaze so be sure to top them off with a generous drizzle.

This recipe was really good. Lemon flavor was perfect! However I missed the part about putting the lemon glaze on top, so they're a little plain, but still really good!

Nice texture but definitely needs the icing to make it taste stronger.  The cookies themselves are quite bland.

Stellar recipe! I stayed true to the measurements and it turned out great! Make sure to leave ample space between the cookies on your tray, they expand quite a bit. I also rolled mine in sugar, and it helped to keep them from spreading too thin :)

These are lovely lemony cookies!  I was running low on ingredients so I only made half a batch using one full lemon worth of zest and juice - wonderful taste!  Also, I don't have a blender at the moment so I just made them like I would any other cookie, popped them in the fridge for a few minutes to harden the batter and it worked perfectly.  These were easy to prepare and the recipe is very forgiving.  I will definitely make them again!

Wonderful cookie!  I liked how light and fluffy the ingredients get when whipped as directed in this recipe.  I refrigerated overnight due to my schedule. Rolled into balls easily.  Came out beautiful.  I opted to make a simple glaze with powdered sugar and lemon juice.  Served at an event and they were very well received.  I didn't think it was possible to like a cookie so much that didn't have chocolate!  My new favorite cookie!

These were very delicious.  I did make a couple of changes (sorry to those who don't like that!)----I added twice the amount of zest to the cookie plus used more in the glaze along with lemon extract.  I also cut the amount of egg in half.  The results are that the cookies are just a little flatter/crispier and more lemony.  This could turn out to be my favorite lemon cookie!  Thanks!

These were good. Only gave it 4 stars since they weren't too lemony. My kids liked them but thought they were sugar cookies.

Really wonderful soft cake like cookies. I rolled them in powdered sugar instead of white sugar and they were excellent! So light, fluffy and lemony. I will save this recipe and make it a
gain and again!

I am in lemon cookie heaven. These are delicious!

I've made these many times now and my best tips for the best results are these:


1. Don't get lazy with measurements or method or ingredients. Can't substitute bakers sugar or powdered for the granulated, and even at a mile high you don't need to reduce sugar/increase flour etc. Cream your sugar and butter properly and chill the dough.


2. Use a level teaspoon (yes, just a teaspoon) to scoop out each cookie. The smaller cookies come out looking just beautiful, not flat, not spread out, not over or under baked. They only need 7 minutes and I can fit 15 to a pan (9 x 13) or 20 to a standard baking sheet without them spreading into each other. They end up about 2 inches in diameter, so bite size. 


3. Don't bother drizzling with glaze until the cookies are 100% absolutely cooled, and make sure the glaze is pretty thick, thicker than you'd think. That results in glaze that sits on top of the cookie rather than absorbing into it. My most recent attempt I used about a cup of powdered sugar to about 1/4 cup of juice.


4. Speaking of juice... Zest the lemon before you juice it... One large lemon gives you about the right amount of juice for the cookie recipe, so buy 2 lemons if you want to also make a glaze.


These cookies always receive high praise from friends, family, teachers, coworkers. My kids ask for them all the time. :)

Yummo! I used orange juice/zest because I didn't have lemon and these were amazing. My daughter calls them Annabelle cookies instead of Princess cookies. Thank you for sharing!

Wonderful! The lemony taste is perfect for spring, although I can see where past reviewers were coming from when saying they were too soft. Nonetheless, they came out great, and the glaze added an extra flavor. All I had was self-rising flour, so I just halved the amount of baking soda and salt to accommodate.

I made exactly as is but I did add 10 drops of lemon extract instead of zest, didn't have lemons.  I also used about 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1-3/4 cup regular flour. It wasn't sticky at all, and formed balls very well.  I did refrigerate it overnight, but I could have rolled them into balls right away.  Delicious flavor, and soft at 10 mins.

Nice lemony flavor, not too strong or too sweet. Even my roommate who doesn't like anything lemon liked these. I put powdered sugar on top which added a nice something. They aren't too exciting and I wasn't too impressed, but they were still very yummy. :)

These were pretty good, but a little too cakey for my tastes. I think perhaps taking care not to overbeat the eggs might be the trick. I also highly recommend NOT using the lemon glaze. It has a fake flavor. With powdered sugar they taste good; however, I would recommend finding either a different glaze for the top or maybe trying the glaze with regular sugar. Overall, good cookie!

I have been on a baking spree and was looking for something different that I would like rather than my boyfriends favorite peanut butter or sugar... I am so happy I came upon this recipe... PHENOMENAL!!! I didn't change a thing but I did use the icing as the submitter recommended... it gives a nice little tartness to the cookie! I will be making these for years to come!

Definitely takes longer than 8 minutes to get them to a solid consistency. But if you use two smaller meyer lemons {zest and juice} the flavor will definitely be there. Scooped them a little bit bigger and flattened them just a bit on the sheet. Baked for roughly 13 minutes or until they felt set. Yummy :D

Third try!  Thanks for your great recipe.  A wonderful use for an abundance of Meyer lemons from my trees.  Test batch done with glaze was delightful and made 75 one and a half inch cookies.  Friends and neighbors received fresh lemons and princess cookies rolled in decorative sugar for Christmas.  I ended up baking them for 10 minutes.  Our ripe lemons were about the size of an orange, so the amount of zest was probably double that of a store-bought lemon and the lemon taste was great!

I made these for an office meeting and I thought they were ok. They were all eaten, but I would change some things. I did make these without the glaze. I would add more lemon zest or add some lemon extract to really amp up the lemon flavor, and I would also either figure out a way to make these less cakey or just let them sit for a day or 2. These were initially very cakey the first day, but the next day they had become more dense and I thought they were much better then. Overall not a bad cookie, fairly simple to make, but I do think it could be improved a little.

They turned out so great! I love baked goods that have strong lemon flavor. These have a more subtle lemon flavor but I loved them, they were just right. Nice texture/ soft inside, great for dunking in a cup of hot tea. I didn’t have enough lemons to make an icing drizzle but it would’ve been a nice touch, going to do that next time on some of them.

These were really good! I baked them a little longer after the 2nd batch because I like them a touch crispy.  They were delicious soft or a little crispy. Like many others commented, I added a lemon glaze because I thought they needed a little more lemon flavor and they were delicious!

These were great - but definitely use a lemon glaze with additional lemon zest and juice.

So light and delicious!  I also tried them using only one egg and I loved the consistency.  I drizzled a glaze on top of the cooled cookies made with fresh lemon juice,  zest and icing sugar.   Delightful!

They didn’t even last 15 minutes at work. I sandwiched them with a strawberry buttercream icing. My new favorite thing to make!

It’s a tasty cookie, but you can’t really taste the lemon unless you apply the lemon icing.  I’d also use one less egg because I like my cookies crispier.  It’s a really easy cookie to make.  I had to cook them about 12 minutes though to get them cooked to my liking, otherwise they tasted a little raw. I will make these again.  I’m going to try some lemon essential oil next time and see if that bumps up the lemon flavor in the cookie.

These cookies were really good. They had a subtle lemony flavor. The cookies had a cakey texture. I didn't use the glaze. I followed the recipe exactly. I think I'll try the glaze next time.

A nice sugar cookie with a lemony flavor. I made some changes suggested by others: only one egg, lemon extract instead of vanilla. For a glaze, I filled a one cup measure  with I/4 cup lemon juice and filled the rest of the cup with confectioner's sugar. Maybe my oven is off but I had to bake for 15-17 minutes at 350 degrees..

The cookies taste really good. The only thing I did differently was to chill the dough overnight added more flour as it was very sticky and was not able to roll it properly. Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

Although this recipe is good, it was not lemony enough.  Some people didn't even now they were lemon.  I tasted the dough while I was making them and I thought they were very lemony, but once out of the oven, not so much.  I'd make this again and add more lemon juice and I'd even make it again and change the flavoring because the cookies themselves are good.

Excellent recipe! Chewy but with some crisp to it. I topped mine with lemon royal icing and powdered sugar. the lemon is subtle and I would prefer a stronger lemon flavor so I'll double the lemon extract and juice

Made these exactly as per the recipe.  Added a lemon juice, zest and icing sugar glaze.  Made the glaze quite thin so it partially soaks into the cookie.  Friends, coworkers and family went crazy for them!  I’ve also made these with limes and also with oranges - all of them are fantastic!  I love the lime flavour best!  This is a total keeper!

Overall these cookies are light and tasty. I have to agree with one reviewer that the lemon flavor was a bit too subtle. I think the next time I make them I will try adding more lemon zest. I did make the lemon glaze to drizzle on my cookies. I will probably add lemon zest to that too next time.

I added the juice of a lemon, along with two tablespoons of lemon extract and a third of a cup of lemon juice for a very lemony flavor. I absolutely loved the cookie's flavor, but I didn't like how cakey and spongy it turned out to be. It was also quite crumbly for me, I'm unsure of what I did to cause this.

I made no changes, except to leave out one egg as a reviewer suggested. I couldn't make it the day I mixed the dough - so put it in the fridge. Baked a couple of days later after thawing it for 30 minutes. They are just perfect! I flattened them a bit so they'd be more crispy and that was great - after 8 minutes the edges were brown and crispy, the centre just crunchy enough. Will definitely be making again.

Loved these light chewy cookies.  Yes they may have seemed a bit cakier than most but I loved the lightness it added, maybe too much because I kept eating them.  I will say adding the lemon glaze (I just used lemon juice and sugar AFTER I took them out of the oven) made a nice lemon bite, but not too heavy for me. Next time I would definitely make more and be a bit more generous.  But if you are someone who is affected by too much lemon these are just right!

Sooo yummy!   Very delicate cookies.   After drizzling the cookies with the lemon glaze, I also dusted the cookies with powdered sugar.

I loved this recipe. I will definitely make  it again. I made one slight change I used the zest of three lemons instead of just one. If it's supposed to have a lemony flavor I like it really lemony. But otherwise the recipe is awesome and a keeper.

I had a few problems with this cookie. It came out to soft and too delicate. It has little to no lemon taste. I have a lemon tree and used them expecting a cookie with a zing. No such luck.

I  didn't change a thing and they were perfect.  I Made them for a cookie swap in our 55 & older community and they were a big hit. Love the lemony taste and i used confectionary sugar and lemon juice for the glaze as suggested.

Took to long to bake. When it finally finished baking they were hard, almost like shortbread. When they finished baking they lost a lot of their lemon flavor.

Very good cookie. Definitely will be using the again. However, others have said it, it needs a boost in the lemon department. Its a very, very subtle lemon flavor. I kicked it up a notch by doing a lemon zest glaze. The lemon glaze goes well with the sweet, light lemon cookie.

Made this 8/08/16 and I wanted to DIE because of how good these were. Best lemon cookie I ever had. A huge hit at work too. There was absolutely none left out of the whole 50 batch. It was so good, I even made it again for myself the next week. Unfortunately we used real lemon juice (squeezed from the lemon) and it changed the taste drastically. Next time I'll follow it to a tee again, and be in heavenly bliss.

I made this recipe exactly as written. (There's something you don't see very often on this site, eh?). The cookies were light and buttery with a hint of lemon. I used the leftover lemon juice and about 1 cup of icing sugar to make a thin glaze as shown in the photo and that made them more lemony. I'm saving this as an easy, tasty recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly - but to finish I both rolled in sugar before baking and followed up with the lemon icing drizzle.  Fantastic cookies.  Exactly what I was hoping for.

Very nice cookie.  I drizzled the top with a mixture of lemon juice and sugar after baking them for a little more lemony zip.

This recipe is perfect and makes a delightful cookie! Definitely let it chill long enough so you can roll out the dough balls with less mess. Have made this several times for my husband and he loves them! Friends have also asked for the recipe when I took it a barbecue.

I baked these today and they were such a huge hit!  My baking time was closer to 12 minutes but that could be my old oven ;)
All I know is that they are delicious!
First time I've juiced and zested a lemon and it actually worked... there's no stopping me now!
Can't wait to try this recipe with lime zest & juice

That was easy to make, and even easier to eat!  Everyone whom I shared it with, enjoyed the lightness, not too sweet, fresh lemon cookie.  It got a bit hot in the kitchen the last time I made it, and firmed it up a bit by placing in the fridge to chill up.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

THESE ARE AMAZING!!!! I made them with slightly more lemon juice (about a teaspoon) and they came out wonderful. Due to me being lazy, I used a scoop (1 1/2 tbs) to shape the cookies and I had to cook them for 13 minutes instead of 8. They still turned out awesome.  :)

I have made these cookies many times and absolutely love them! They are perfect for any event and everyone loves them.  One tip to make forming them easier is to put the dough in a frosting bag and squeeze it out.  For frosting I generally use lemon juice and powdered sugar and mix until it has a thinner consistency, drizzle it over top and voila. Great Recipe!

so yummy. next time, I'm going to add in coconut flakes to it. i changed the receipe slightly. i took another reviewers suggestion and only used 1 egg and that was the key to making this cookie have that cookie texture. also i cut back on the sugar about a quarter cup and it was just right for my family and i. not too sweet.

After reading the other comments, I made several changes to this recipe: I used only one egg, and I doubled the lemon juice.  Also, I upped the oven temp to 365 since I wanted a crisper cookie - and I rolled the pre-baked cookies in coarse sugar.  Love them!  This recipe is going into my permanent file.  The added juice means chilling the dough longer makes it easier to handle.

lovely. I was looking for a change from chocolate or oat meal. And they did not disappoint. light soft and almost refreshing. I substituted about 1/4 cup of flour for cornmeal to make them crisp and added 1/2 teaspoon of lemon oil. dusted some in poppy seeds they were good. defiantly will make again.

Really great texture cookie. Soft and melts in your mouth. It wasn't nearly lemon-y enough for my taste, but I'll try making a glaze next time.

I have made these 7 times and every time they come out so delicious. I like putting a glaze on the cookies made with powdered sugar and lemon juice. I had all the ingredients for these cookies already at home, so if you want to bake choose this recipie. My family loves these!!

I would give these 4.5 stars. I made these for my moms birthday. I died some of the batter blue and made little 40's on some of the cookies. They have a fine taste, nothing amazing. Unlike other reviews, these are not at all cakes, just a moist, chewy cookie. Thx for the great recipe!

I followed the directions exactly and when I baked the first batch at 350 for 8 minutes, they were not cooked. I raised the temp to 375 and cooked for 13 minutes and they still were not done.

We loved it my 4 & 2 yr. Old liked it with no icing.  They were not sweet , but when rolling them up the dough is sticky.  I made a lemon glaze with powder sugar, lemon juice & zest also with vanilla & milk.  Spread it on top of cookies to give it a more zesty taste.

I substituted the lemon juice with 2 TBSP of Orange Liqueur and didn't add any zest. Absolutely delicious. I also didn't wait 30 minutes to chill the dough. These babies turned out amazing. However I also added some icing to the cookies: confectioner sugar with orange liqueur....man oh man!!

These cookies were delicious! The lemon flavor was noticeable but not overpowering. However, the dough was really sticky even after chilling, and I did have to add extra flour so the texture of the finished cookies was more cakey. I didn't bother with the glaze because I didn't have enough lemon juice, so I just dusted them with powdered sugar when they were done. Overall very tasty.

Very good.  I didn't have any lemon zest, so I substituted 1/4 teaspoon of lemon extract.  The cookies were soft, moist and very lemony (in a good way - the flavor, not the sour). I would make these again.

Yummy little treats! The lemon flavor is subtle, but adds just enough flavor to give these cookies a bit of zing. The only substitution I made was to use Splenda instead of sugar. They turned out great and didn't last long!

Lovely cookie. The first time I baked these cookies, I followed the recipe exactly and came out with more of a sugar cookie than a lemon cookie, which was a bit disappointing. My second go, I added just about 3 more tbs and was very pleased with the outcome --it was still light and butter, but had a little more tanginess. Served with powdered sugar. Delightful!

Great cookies! I had a little problem with the glaze though. I wasn't sure whether to add it before or after baking. And I think I chose the wrong option, which was before baking. Because when I drizzled some over the top, it just kind of pooled under the dough and made it stick to the pan while it baked. But even then, the texture and taste were lovely. Thanks for the recipe.

The cookies turned out looking good but tasted just okay.  The longer they sat the more lemony the flavor became (I thought).

These little cookies tasted great! :) and the glaze to go on top is tart and sweet all at once giving the cookie an even better taste! I added a little extra lemon juice to the cookie batter after seeing a couple reviews and it tasted great! :)
