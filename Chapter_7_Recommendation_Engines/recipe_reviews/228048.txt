Let me make this perfectly clear....I Don't like goat cheese, too earthy.  I don't like strawberries, too many little seeds to get caught in my teeth.  I don't like Balsamic vinegar, too strong, and you want me to reduce it as well....PLEASE.  I DO like this recipe, exactly as posted....go figure.

I changed this a little, although I'm sure it would still deserve 5 stars, as written.  This made an extremely good dessert, for my Sunday dinner.  I used a frozen pound cake (thawed) instead of oiled bread, and only broiled it on one side, for one minute.  However, I followed all the rest of the recipe.  Everyone at the dinner loved it, even one person who HATES balsamic vinegar!!!

Tastes fan-freakin'-tastic.  The saucy cut-up fruit does not travel well.  Wait til it's the last possible moment to mix it up.

Good.  I had some trouble reducing the vinegar, it turned hard fast.  But the flavors came together well in the end.

This is outstanding!!!  I am afraid of our grill, so I toasted the bread in the oven, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  It got rave reviews, even by the kids.  Definitely one of my new favorites.

These are amazing!! We took the advice of another and used basil instead of thyme. My kids 12 & 7 ask for these daily and even the picky hubs likes them too. Thanks for the great recipe!

I enjoyed this but thought the thyme was a little overpowering for my taste.  I am going to make again using basil.  The flavor is really great with the tanginess and the sweet from the vinegar, cheese, and strawberry.

I had some goat cheese that I wanted to use, so I tried this recipe.  It might have been better on bread, but I mounded the goat cheese on a serving plate, then drizzled the strawberry mix over the cheese, and served it with crackers.  I liked the flavors, but my guests were ho-hum about this presentation.

It was good. A bit fancier than I  usually cook. I added 1 tbs sugar to bal. vinegar while reducing. Then chopped  strawberries and added 1 1/2 tbs of sugar stirred in 4 lg fresh basil leaves pinched up tiny pieces  and let sit while reduction cooled.  Basil instead of thyme.

Very good & easy appetizer. Made as directed but could have used less balsamic. This would be delicious with peaches or cherries. Loved the fresh flavor.

I followed the recipe with the exception of using a day old rustic baguette, which makes nice, tiny crostini, which I toasted in the oven. Added two tablespoons of milk to smooth out the goat cheese. When I spooned the rich, balsamic infused strawberries over each crostini, I added a single blueberry- hence creating a gorgeous red, white and blue appetizer! It was the hit of our July 4th party!

I made it exactly as described, and it was really quite delicious! It was a nice change of pace for a dessert compared to cakes, pies, and the like. My husband really liked it!

Two things: reducing the vinegar didn't actually make it any thicker, so I don't bother heating it anymore. Also, I think this would be improved b adding a tsp of sugar or honey to the balsamic if you have out of season strawberries that aren't all that sweet.

After going strawberry picking with my kids and coming home with an abundance of strawberries I came across this recipe. Since saving it to my recipe box I've made this 5-6 times already exactly as described. I served this to my husband on date night and he raved about it. I also served this at a dinner party and guest were asking for more. Delicious!!! Will be making this over & over again. Thank you chef John:)

I made this dish for a finger food party.  Everyone liked it.  I took a short cut since I was making a lot of dishes.  Instead of boiling down the balsamic vinegar I purchased "Balsamic Glaze".  It is a bit expensive but a huge time saver.  Also, instead of mixing the vinegar in with the strawberries I just drizzled it on top which made for a nice presentation.  I am not a huge fan of thyme which is probably why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Next time I'll try the basil which others have recommended.

This was a hit at our work party! I took others suggestions and used basil instead of thyme and it was a great accent to the bright and tart yet sweet strawberries.  I will definitely make this again.

I made this for a party and it was a hit. Both kids & adults could not keep there hands out of it. It is the perfect combination of flavors. We thought we would be bringing some home, but actually had to broil more bread. I added a little sugar to the recipe because my strawberries were not as sweet as I would have liked. I can't wait to make this with fresh picked strawberries as soon as they are in season!

Absolutely Excellent!  I brought this to a holiday party last night, and it was a HIT.  One of the guests reluctantly tried it unsure of strawberries on a bruschetta, and she raved about the simplicity of ingredients, and complexity of flavors, additionally, very appreciative of such a delightful vegaterian option!  "surprisingly delightfully delicious!"  I made a couple of minor tweaks - I used cranberry baguette brushed with olive oil toasted under the broiler (both sides), and substituted basil instead of thyme.  This dish is minimal effort, huge payoff!

I used a blueberry infused balsamic vinegar for the reduction.  Also added blueberries to the strawberry/basil mixture!

Great mix of flavors for an unexpected combination. Used spreadable goat cheese and dried thyme. Fresh might add more flavor but it was still excellent.

I made this tonight but used grilled chicken instead of bread. I was very pleased with the recipe. The acidity of the strawberries really balances against the creaminess of the goat cheese. I will make it again!

This got rave reviews from my scrutinizing taste testers. I didn't have fresh thyme, so used dried.  I think it would have been nicer with the fresh herb.  I burnt some of the bread- you have to watch it carefully.

Delicious! I used French bread rounds as I wanted it to be more of a bite sized appetizer and next time I might use more goat cheese as I really liked the sweet, sour, salty combination.

This is really good. It's delicate and fresh. I cheated and used store-bought balsamic glaze. This is a wonderful addition to your brunch table.

So easy! Tips:
- Remember to watch the balsamic vinegar; the first time, it did not reduce enough and the second time, it reduced too quickly and burned. Taste before mixing with strawberries.
- Use another spreadable cheese with the goat cheese; goat cheese itself was too rich so I paired with an artichoke spreadable cheese
- leave cheese and strawberries out at room temperature 1/2 - 1 hr before serving
- goat cheese is often mixed with herbs so no need to have thyme

Both adults and kids love this. We make this as one of our appetizers when we have friends over. It's always a hit. I didn't have any fresh thyme on hand last time I made it but it didn't loose any flavor. It was still just as good.

I have made this several times. It is always a favorite with everyone. When reducing the BV, be patient and watchful - you really need to get the sweetness to come out, I'm not a fan of Thyme so I left it out.  Chef John!

Very good as written and my family liked it. The mistake I think I made was to use a very soft-and strange-goat cheese. I'm sure it would be better with a thicker brand. I'm going to make this again trying blueberries and try substituting cream cheese for the goat cheese.

Great and easy appetizer.  I use basil instead of thyme though.  I also used a good quality balsamic and didn't reduce it.  Still worked well and made the recipe even easier.

I have fix this several times now just as Chef John prepares it.  The only thing I do differently is to take a fork and "gently" (not mash) press the berries into the toast, then slice the toast into thirds for easier handling and less cleanup for your carpets. This has become an "asked" for appetizer.  I love serving these with a cold glass of Prosecco.
