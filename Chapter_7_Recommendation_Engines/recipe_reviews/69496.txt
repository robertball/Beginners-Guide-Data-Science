Very good! This recipe peaked my interest as my dad attended the same high school.  The cake lives up to its reputation--very moist after letting it set overnight.  I used brown sugar instead of white in the crumb topping because of personal preference, and would suggest doubling the topping recipe if you like a lot of crumbs; it doesn't make a whole lot.  Overall a very nice coffee cake and easy to make with ingredients everyone has on hand!

I accidentally added twice as much butter as I was supposed to, and didn't realize it until the next day.  I was wondering why the cake was so moist!  It was fabulous.  Next time, I might not add so much butter -- maybe just a little extra for good measure.  I also doubled the crumb topping, since my husband and I like it.  Great recipe!

This is a wonderful coffee cake recipe, very moist! I already had a favorite coffee cake recipe, but I couldn't resist trying this because of the history of it. I am glad that I did. It is quick and easy and uses basic ingredients that most of us already have in our cupboards and refrigerator. I reduced the oven temperature to 350 (375 seems too hot for such a small cake) and baked for the recommended time of 25 minutes. I added a sprinkle of cinnamon to the batter. I also topped the cake with a glaze made from powder sugar, almond extract, and a little bit of milk. No need to cool the cake before topping with glaze since there is  no butter in it. This has earned a page in my favorite recipes collection!  Thank you for sharing such a special recipe and the history of it.

I went to Ben Lippen for 4 years and had this coffee cake every Thursday! (if memory serves me right!) Love it and love Mrs. Hathaway!!! We always ate it in a bowl with milk poured over it! My kids to this day eat their coffeecake that way too!

I love this recipe!  I found it on this site at least 4 years ago and it has become a family favorite!  It is a simple classic and very "forgiving".  I have 5 children home during the day and they gobble this up when I make it.  It is a good "standby" esp when you are in a "pinch": short on time or short on ingredients.  This has just a few simple ingredients that most of us always have on hand.  It does make quite a "small" coffee cake so I usually double it or at least 1 1/2 times the recipe. By "forgiving" I mean you can be pretty creative with this recipe and still come out with a simple delicious breakfast or snack cake.  I have substituted oat flour, or ground flax meal for part of the flour.  I have added a dab of sour cream to make it more rich.  I have added sugar cinnamon to the batter.  I have added nuts.  I get creative w/ whatever I happen to have on hand.  We almost always double the topping too.  I think you could add a little apple sauce or pumpkin puree to this recipe for variation.  It is just a great BASIC coffee cake and I love the history behind it.  I know nothing about the Ben Lippen school but when I make this recipe I always get curious to know more about it.  We had this coffee cake for breakfast this morning.  Just delicious!

Outstanding!  The other review talk about it being a bit bland, but that works for my kids.  I did double the topping and used brown sugar just because it's a family favorite . . . just like this recipe will be.  Thank you very much for posting a coffee cake that I have all the ingredients IN THE CUPBOARD!

The cake had good flavor, but the topping was "lackluster". Doubling the topping is recommended and use brown sugar instead of white. Also, I drizzled some almond flavored icing over the top and since I had fresh sliced strawberries, added those too!

Yummy and mild.  Kids loved it.  I used brown sugar for the topping instead of white and reduced the amount of butter to 1 T. to make it less gloppy.

This caught my eye as I live in Columbia and have many friends who graduated from Ben Lippen. The coffee cake itself is indeed moist and delicious, however it is not something I would INSIST you try at some time in your life, it didn't change my life or anything but never-the-less, if you are looking for a good coffee cake recipe, look no further!

Followed the recipe exactly, except I added a few tablespoons of brown sugar to the topping so it would cover the cake a bit better.  Very delish... it ended up being the best coffee cake I've ever had.

I was one of those thousands who enjoyed this as a sophomore at the Asheville campus. We'd take a big slice of this cake, set it in a cereal bowl and pour in some milk. Great way to start the day.

I was looking for a simple coffee cake recipe, and found this one.  It is easy, but I think adding a little more vanilla extract in the wet mixture would be better.  For the crumb topping, I added some pecans.  This really helped with the flavor.  You can pretty much add anything to this recipe.  I will make this again, only with improvements.

This is the most moist and delicious coffee cake I have ever tasted. I made the recipe as written with the exception of subbing 1 3/4 c of spelt flour for the all purpose stated. I also doubled the topping. Delicious!

I found this on the site because I attended Ben Lippen, and I served this while I worked in the kitchen as a student.  We all looked forward to Thursdays because of this recipe.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find it, and it took me right back to high school!  It is a very moist cake with a wonderfully crumbly topping.  I don't like things too cloyingly sweet, and this fits the bill perfectly for me.  I did like Cheyenne's suggestion for brown sugar, and the second time I made it, I added 5 Tbsp brown sugar and 2 additional Tbsp butter.  My daughter, the sugar fiend, fell in love, and it's now a favorite at our house- just not every Thursday.

This cake is just ok.  I made it as is. As far as flavor goes the title says it all "school coffee cake."  I recommend this only for its simplicity and bare cupboard ingredients. Definitely make your own version of this with different toppings. I wish mine had butterscotch chips and pecans, or almonds and dried cranberries. Lastly, the cake came out fine without greasing the pan.

This was just OK. If I would have read the other reviews I would have changed the topping to brown sugar and doubled it.  This was more cake-like than coffee cake texture.

It's a good cake, but I did take the advice of other reviewers by adding cinnamon and doubling the vanilla in the batter.  I also like brown sugar instead of white for added flavor.  A singe batch of topping would be too light for us, but doubling made too much, maybe just 1.5 next time.  It was very tasty and I will make it again.

This was just okay ... given all the coffee cake recipes I have made or have yet to try, I wouldn't do this one again. I used brown sugar for the topping. There just isn't anything in this to elevate it above two stars. The ingredients are similar to a sour cream coffee cake without the sour cream, so perhaps that's why I found it a bit on the dry side.
