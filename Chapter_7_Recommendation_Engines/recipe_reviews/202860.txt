I followed the recipe exact, only using garlic powder and sea salt instead of garlic salt and seasoning salt. This baked up kind of mushy and didn't stay together well. My oldest and I liked this okay, my husband and youngest did not. I don't think I'll make this again but I appreciate the chance to try this one.

Used Ritz instead of saltines and substituted the chicken for an extra half pound of turkey. This was so good that I almost exploded. In a really good way.

I made this for the first time tonight for dinner. My husband will eat anything I cook but tonight before I even had taken a bite of the meatloaf he said "this is the best meatloaf I have ever eaten!" After I got a bite, I had to agree! It was great and I will use this recipe from now on! Thank you so much!

Absolutely the best meatloaf I've EVER had! The bbq sauce and the sausage go together so well! The only thing I didn't add was the liquid smoke...I do not like the flavor of that stuff. I may have added a few more cracker crumbs than it called for...but the texture was just perfect. A++ will make again!!!!

My picky, picky kids LOVE this!!  I make a double recipe so I can freeze one.  It reheats and tastes just as good.  I add some bell pepper to it because I can hide it from my kids!  THEY LOVE THIS!!  I think I would give it more than five stars if I could!

This was the best tasting meatloaf Ithink I have ever made.  I used Ritz crackers as someone had done before.  I also used 1 lb of turkey sausage and 1 lb of ground chicken and almost doubled everything else.

Very, very tasty.  I liked the sweet, smoky taste instead of the typical ketchup based meatloaf.  B/c I don't eat pork, I substituted the pork sausage & bacon for italian turkey sausage & turkey bacon.  Also added diced sauted onion & celery.

Great flavor! Used Ritz instead of saltines, omitted the liquid smoke and used a loaf pan. The combination of sausage and bbq sauce was really tasty.It was not mushy at all.

This is REALLY good!  The only change I make is to skip the ground chicken.  The recipe is wonderful as is!

I followed this recipe except I only used 1/2 teaspoon of prepared mustard and I substituted the 1/2 pork sausage, for 12 ounces of turkey sausage.  This meatloaf has so much flavor, that I will be definitely making this again and may try using muffin tins as one other reviewer did.

I made this from what I had on hand, Sub'd Ritz for saltines, Sub'd Basil for parsley, sub'd A-1 for liquid smoke, and sub'd 1 packet onion soup for Onion powder and dried onion.  I also used 16 oz of chicken and 12 oz of Hot Breakfast Sausage

This was so good! Looking for an alternative to beef and this was a great substitute.

Oh. Yum.  Just made this tonight.  I almost made the mistake of skipping the glaze, due to laziness.  It was SO delicious.  Won't be making another turkey meatloaf besides this one.  Great with mashed taters and mixed veggies.

My husband loved it and called it a keeper.  My kids and I thought it was a little too rich and did not eat so much.  I will make it again but next time I will cut down on the salt...I also thought the glaze was way too sweet, so I might omit the sugar.  It's a nice change to the regular menu but I would definitely serve it with some bland side dishes.

OUTSTANDING!! So outstanding that my husband said he could eat it once a week. We both despise meatloaf but I decided to try this because it wasn't ground beef. I followed this recipe exactly. We'll be making this again and again.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had.  I did not have ground turkey, so I used 1 lb. chicken and 1/2 lb. sausage.  I used Panko bread crumbs in place of Saltines and increased the amount to about 1/2 cup.  I did not have liquid smoke and intended to throw in some Worcestershire sauce instead but forgot about it completely.  In place of garlic salt, I used 1/2 tsp. each of garlic powder and  salt.  I also doubled the sauce portion.  Everyone at the table talked about how great it was through the entire meal.  Tonight I will make it for the second time using my mini loaf pan.

fabulous!  My husband says he hates turkey, but served it and he said it was the best meatloaf he had ever tasted.  I modified the recipe.  Iused 1 lb. turkey and 1 lb. pork sausage.  I didn't have crackers, so I just used bread crumbs.

Fantastic!  Great twist on plain old meatloaf.  I made it exactly as written except for the liquid smoke since I couldn't find mine in the cabinet. So delicious, I've made it twice in the last two weeks!

I used a little less barbecue sauce and a bit of ketchup because we really like it.  Also, I only ground turkey. It was very good. I plan on making it again. 
Thanks!

Since I made some changes, I can't give this a five.  First off, I only had ground chicken so that is all I used.  Instead of minced onion and onion powder, I chopped up some fresh onion and I used dijon mustard.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and the results were very tasty indeed - both my husband and I loved it and it made great meatloaf sandwiches.   Will make this again.  Thanks.

The recipe was a little salty. If I made this again I would use fresh onions and good old salt and pepper.
