Great recipe, but decrease the butter AND use a strong-tasting honey. Got lots of positive comments and requests for the recipe. 

Start with: Good-tasting carrots. (usually large organic...baby carrots ok, too, just more casual.); Alfalfa or buckwheat honey (you'll never go back to clover or wildflower honey); Michigan cherries, craisins and cranberries are all good. Prefer no sugar or other chemicals added. (Carrots are sweet enough; just want the cherry taste.)

This recipe is for about a pound of carrots. I cut the large carrots into 2" slices then sliced them into quarters. If the carrot is really big, into six slices. They end up like mouth-size carrot sticks. Two pounds can be prepared in 10 minutes.

The less butter the better. (we hardly ever use it) The recipe "as is" feels like I'm eating butter. So at least half it. The stronger-tasting honey is more for flavor than sweetener. We LOVE this!

Normally I don't like carrots, in any form, and my husband only likes them raw. Not cooked. So we very rarely have carrots in the house, because he is the only one who eats them. 
That is changing with this recipe. I am eating these as I write this--I might have to make a second batch for him when he gets home. Thanks for a great recipe!!  I made it like written, came out great. I forgot, I subbed cranberries as I did not have cherries.

I haven't been eating my veggies lately.  Tried this recipe, very good.  Used craisins and didn't have honey so used brown sugar.  Yum.  Also, I don't like cooked veggies so much so I just melted the butter and sugar, added the craisins.  I let that cook into a sauce and just tossed the baby carrots in the sauce.  Not sickening sweet at all, nice compliment to the carrots.  Definitely will make again!

I tried this recipe before Christmas to see if I wanted to serve it with Christmas dinner. The carrots and flavor were delicious, but the dried cherries I bought turned out to be stale with a strange flavor. Ruined the dish. What a disappointment. No reflection on the recipe. Unfortunately good dried cherries are hard to find in small southern towns. The prepackaged ones have too much artificial junk in them and are too sweet. I bought enough to make this dish for Christmas and, sadly, had to throw them away. I hope to find some great cherries and try again. Anyone have any suggestions on how to be sure dried cherries are not too old? Thanks.

I love carrots, but I thought this would be a nice change from the ordinary. I used Craisins instead of dried cherries, but I still found this dish too sweet. I think next time I'll cut back on the amount of honey. Though I agree, for the carrot haters, I think this dish would appeal to them.

This turned out fine, and it was certainly a breeze to make.  The combination of carrots, honey and cherries was a winner.  Next time I'll be adding a little more honey and coarsely chopping the cherries so that every bite is packed with flavors.

I'm always looking for a simple side dish that is also full flavored. This dish met all the criteria since it was both quick and tasty. I will make this over and over.

I like carrots, but this was altogether too sweet for me.  Ah, well.  I may try to make it again without the honey.

I'm not typically a fan of cooked carrots but I wanted to find a side dish that I might enjoy and could attempt to get my 4 year old picky eater to taste. This was great. I loved it and my picky girl at them up!   I did however modify the recipe a bit. We're not fans of dried cherries and they're very expensive. But we love craisins and my daughter eats them often so I used those instead. Perfect substitute.

I read all the reviews on this recipe.  It looked like a good idea, but I needed to stretch it for approx 30 people.  I substituted baby carrots for the sliced carrots and because I couldn't get the lid off the honey, I dissolved brown sugar in the butter.  It turned out delicious, none the less.  I am making this for a community get-together, so I wanted to impress a few people........... I think this will do it.

Really good!  I used frozen cherries (less sugar and cheaper than dried.)  I sliced the frozen cherries into 2 or 4 pieces and added them just like the recipe says.  I would make it again.

SO easy and really good.  We like carrots and did not think it was too sweet.  Only change I made was to use cranberries instead of cherries because it's what I had on hand.

We love carrots and used a nice local honey along with organic carrots, but this combo didn't work for us.  The honey/butter sauce on the carrots was tasty but the cherries did not go with it for us.  The sauce itself (cherries, honey, butter) was good by itself on spicy baked chicken.  Very easy to prepare though.

Excellent modified! Like another reviewer, I did't have honey on hand so I used brown sugar. These were delicious. I would have never thought to combine these ingredients and my whole family ate them FIRST! It's a keeper.

This was a pleasant surprise - I'd never bought dried cherries, but they turned out to be readily available at my grocery store. I was a little skeptical of this dish, picturing carrots with Bing or Maraschino cherries, but that wasn't the case at all. The dried cherries of course turned out to look a lot like raisins, and the combination with the carrots was very nice. The honey/butter sauce just made it even better. I made this exactly as written, but should note that melting the butter over medium heat quickly started to brown the butter, so I immediately turned the heat down. For a fairly simple side dish, this has a fancy look, and rich taste. Definitely worth making again!

A nice combination of flavors.  I just used baby carrots, opening the bag and pouring them right in the pot to steam.  Easy and elegant.

I tried this recipe tonight for a gathering of about 20 people.  I quadrupled the recipe; used thawed frozen carrots and canned sweet dark cherries.  It got rave reviews.  Personally, if I could eat nuts (allergic), adding pecan halves would've been perfect.  Next time, I might put some on the side for others to enjoy.  Let's face it. . .put butter and honey on almost anything and it's yummy, right?
Great recipe.  Will make again!
