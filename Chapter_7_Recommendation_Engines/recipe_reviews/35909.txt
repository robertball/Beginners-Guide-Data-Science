This recipe is good stuff. But I want to warn those unfamiliar with curry- make sure you're using a decent curry powder, or your porkchops will be sub-par. I made this twice with  different curry powders, and the difference was night and day. The "national brand" of curry powder you'll find in a regular grocery store made this taste like celery seed and did NOT compliment the other flavors. It's worth the extra legwork and money to find a good, authentic curry. When I used "real" curry powder, this recipe was stellar! Had trouble finding a dish to go with it, though, would like to hear others' meal ideas.

Loved this recipe! I used apricot preserves instead of nectar, olive oil and a bit a tumeric. So good! It was so fast, and I had all the ingredients!

This dish was very easy to make.  The pork was very tender and tasted as though alot more time and effort went into making it.

The recipe calls for 1 CUP of oil which seems VERY odd... I only used about 1T so that I could saute the pork first.

Thank you for the recipe!

Deliciously tangy, and ridiculously easy recipe. I might double the sauce next time so I have more to drizzle on top of some jasmine rice. I would also try this delicious sauce on top of lightly breaded pan-fried chicken breasts. A lovely dish. Thank you!  I just remade it using apricot nectar as directed (I must have just used apricot preserves last time), and I must say I liked it MUCH better with the preserves instead. The nectar flattened the flavor out. Nevertheless, I did double the sauce so I had enough, which I drizzled over jasmine rice boiled in apple juice instead of water, with a crushed cashew garnish.

This reminds me of a dish my mom used to make with cornish hens.  Her recipe included cooked bacon and sauteed onions, which gives the sauce much more flavor.  When I made this, I also included onions and bacon and doubled the apricot sauce.  I dipped the pork chops into seasoned flour prior to browning, then, per the recipe, cooked them in the apricot sauce.  I served them with parslied rice and spooned the extra sauce over it.  Yum!

Not bad. I used a tablespoon of Patak hot curry paste from a jar and real garlic. Very oddly named recipe, considering pork is rarely eaten in India (and never with off-the-shelf curry or garlic powder).

Made this last night because I had pork chops on hand and wanted to make something to compliment the Indian rice dish I was making.  Very tasty, sweet and easy! This was a nice fragrant sauce and would go well with chicken too.

I marinated in the sauce and still had little flavor for me. I did use a good curry powder, just was bland tasting outside of the little bit of heat from the curry. I agree the sauce was good tasting, just didn't seem to make it's way into the chops. Thanks anyway for the recipe.

This was so easy and good.  I served this with Basmati rice and used apricot preserves instead.  I have made it again and doubled the sausce to have enough to put on the rice.

These come out delicious, though I've always used mango nectar instead of apricot, as I can't find it anywhere.  The only issue with the recipe as written... too little sauce.  Absolutely need to double the sauce recipe.

There has to be someway to make it better - the sauce on it's own was delicious but it was lost on the pork.  Pork tasted like pork - would marinating help?  I really wanted to taste the sauce without eating a spoonful seperately!!!

This wasn't a big hit with us. I didn't like the apricot/curry combination, and Husband was unenthusiastic. Thanks anyway.

This was very tasty.  I also added a table spoon of Pataks curry paste and used Mango juice instead of apricot nectar because I couldn't find any at the shops.  Used real garlic.  Next time I think I will try it with Pork loin instead of chops.   But, again a very nice flavour.  Thank you Gabrielle

So after reading most of the reviews, I did my own thing as well. First I made little slits in the pork chops then peppered them and browned them in Olive oil and onions. Couldn’t find apricot nectar so I used preserves and thinned it with some chicken broth and cooking sherry. Mmmmm

My husband I both liked this recipe - served it with brown rice and vegetables. I added chopped onions at the beginning of the simmer and green pepper (red pepper would be just as good or better) 3 minutes before the end. Next time I make it,I'll add a bit more nectar and maybe some preserves as well and a lot more curry. Maybe then It'll be a 5 star - I'll let you know.

I have now made this dish a few times now.  It is simple AND delicious.  My oldest kiddo (17) has made the dish as well.  I have experimented with both apricot nectar & apricot preserves, and we have found that we like it best with a 1/2 & 1/2 mix of the two.  The nectar alone seemed to be not as flavorful, but the preserves made it too sweet.  So, we did a combo & it was just right. :)  Sometimes we double the sauce recipe and put it over rice, its so delish!

Sliced the pork chops into thin strips. Poured sauce over the pork and stir fried over high heat then lowered heat until sauce thickened,  Served with fried rice.  Delicious.

3.19.16   Read the reviews and knew that I needed to double the sauce (glad I did because it was delicious).  I used what I had on hand and that was mango nectar and added some mango chutney to the sauce.  Absolutely delicious and absolutely EASY to make.  Served with basmati rice with peas and Honey Dijon Brussels Sprouts (recipe on this site).

Couldn't find the apricot nectar, so pureed a can of apricots in heavy syrup.  Added extra curry powder accordingly.  Made alot of sauce, so we had plenty to "dip".

Nice and quick.  The chops were very juicy.  Substituted preserves for the nectar and mixed in some OJ to thin them out.

I made this recipe last night and it was delicious.  In order to cut the sugar (we are on diets)I used apricot halves that were slightly sweetened with Splenda, and it was very good!!!  My hubby loved it.  Enough said!!!

This was just ok.  The sauce smelled delicious, but the flavor in the pork was just ok.  I wonder if Chicken would work better.
