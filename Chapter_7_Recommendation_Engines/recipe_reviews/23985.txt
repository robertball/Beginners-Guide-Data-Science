First off, this is a wonderful dish but implying that it's Lasagna is misleading.  I wish it was called something else so some people wouldn't be disappointed when making it!!!
**************************************

Important Note: Instead of adding another jar of sauce like some of the other readers suggested, I just added 1/2 jar of water to the sauce and then simmered it for 20 minutes.

The reason that this recipe probably didn't have enough sauce when it finished baking was more than likely due to the fact that raviolis soak up water while they're cooking.  The addition of the extra water gives the raviolis the water to plump up, instead of using the water from the sauce.  This keeps the consistancy of the sauce like it should be, instead of drying out.  Another bonus is that you don't have to use an extra jar of sauce, which only  increases the expense of this dish unnecessarily.

This dish came out GREAT.. hope this tip helps :)

This was pretty good.  The kids loved it and it's hard to make something they all like.

HOWEVER, don't be a dork like me and 'thaw' the ravioli.  Boil them in water if they are frozen or put them in the recipe still frozen.  Unfortunately, I 'thawed' them in the refridgerator and they stuck together in a clump.  I boiled the clump and it all worked out okay in the end but I think the results would have been somewhat better if I had just boiled them while still frozen before adding them to the recipe.  I should have known better (hanging head in shame).

Ok so I have to admit that I saw the Lazy part of this recipe and had to try it.  It was great.  I took another reviewers advice and used italian sausage instead of beef and it was great.  Found a new way to make lasagna without having to take up an entire evening. Thanks for the help.

Super easy and very tasty. My family loved this lasagne and the house smelled terrific. I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef, 2 jars of spaghetti sauce, more mozzarella and a larger baking dish. This is quick to assemble and tastes like you slaved in the kitchen. I served this with garlic toast and a salad.

Easy to make and tasty, although my wacky oven burned it a little, so for those of you who have a quick oven, I suggest you cover while baking and check after a half hour.

Great idea - I had a bag of frozen ravioli in the freezer and was looking for a quick meal! I used a can of low fat alfredo sauce instead of the spaghetti sauce because my husband likes it more.

This was pretty good! However I did add some  Sweet Italian sausage, fennel seeds, dried parsley and dried basil and a little sugar to the sauce to give it more favor. (I also simmer my sauce for 15 mins) It turned out great. I well definitely make it again.

This was a huge hit! I forgot to get more cheese raviolis the day I made it so I used chicken & mozzarella raviolis on the bottom layer and cheese ones on the top. I thought it might be kinda weird but it was delicious. Another reviewer said to add water for the raviolis to soak up... don't! It was kinda soupy, but still very good.

The house is smelling up nicely as this dish has another 20mins to go, with the lid off.  I chopped up several (more than 5) cloves of garlic and added to the sauce, also adding a small amount of water to the sauce.  Maybe a cup total.  I used a 42 ounce jar of simple sauce and added fresh basil mushrooms and italian seasoning to it, and simmered it on the stove for a bit.    I am not sure why people give this recipe a poor review when the already written reviews are stating to add more water.    This is a great recipe idea... no layering of sauce, noodles, ricotta, sauce, noodles, ricotta - because the raviolis already contain enough ricotta.  However, if you have the time, you can sprinkle a handful of mozz, or what have you, between layers.   I recommend par-boiling the raviolis before preparing the dish.    30mins later: Fantastic!  This was a really yummy meal - easy to make and a bit hit with everyone.  A 13x9 will feed at least 8-10 people, especially if you include garlic bread and salad!  We (2 of us) barely put a dent in it.  It will be great for leftovers and lunches for my man.    Thanks for sharing!

This is good. I think adding some water or broth is a good idea. I also used ground sausage for this and added some italian seasoning. I used half the amount of ravioli's and put it in an 8x8 pan and it worked great. I also topped it off with some parmeasan cheese. I will surely make this again.

Super quick and delicious recipe!  I did boil the ravioli first for approximately 5 minutes then layered it in a baking dish with mozzarella cheese,  browned ground beef, onions, garlic and spaghetti sauce.  I baked it for about 20 minutes, then put more mozzarella cheese on top and continued baking until cheese melted.  I just love these 'lazy' recipes!

Perfect dinner for a busy night what you want to make something that looks like you put more effort in cooking than you actually have time for! I substituted Boca Crumbles for the ground beef and you would never know! Also added 3 cloves of garlic.  YUM!! Easy, delicious vegetarian meal.

Very good and very easy. I did mine in an 8 x 8 pan. Used 1lb HOT sausage, 1 onion, 4 cloves garlic, 1 jar sauce (plus 1/2 jar water), 18 ravioli and 2 cups mozzerella cheese and a few shakes of italian seasoning. I simmered the sauce 20 minutes before I made the lasagna. Baked at 375 for about 35 minutes. It filled the 8 x 8 to the very top and boiled over a bit in the oven. Put a cookie sheet underneath to catch the spill.  Will make again for sure. Maybe next time try adding some veggies to it.

I used beef ravioli and a vegetarian sauce. I did not have enough sauce so it was quite dry. I will not make it again.

Easy and Cheesy!!  I made this one night when I was in a hurry to get a dinner on that the kids wouldn't complain about and it was a hit.  I added to cans of sauce and was happy with the results.

My husband loves this recipe and trust me, he's picky!  I used breakfast sausage instead of hamburger which gave it a different flavor but it now a staple in our household.  I've made it several times already!

How easy was this?  I love that the ravioli does not need to be cooked. This will be a regular for me.  Next time I will try to sneak in some veg.

This was a smashing success! What an easy, quicker alternative to lasagna.  I highly recommend this recipe to lasagna lovers who are a little lazy (lol). I took the advice from the other reviewers- I used 2 sauces of pasta sauce.  This definitely needed that amount of sauce- plus you'll get more robust flavor that way.  My hubby is a vegetarian, so in lieu of ground beef, I used vegetarian sausage patties. Yummy!!

I saw a spot on the Today show with the lady who wrote the biggest looser cook books. She called her version Ravio-sagne. Tonight I left out the meat because it is Lent and I also left out the onion because I am lazy.  I went the healthy route & used Whole Wheat Ravioli and Ragu Light layered with Mozz Cheese. It could not be easier! I will make this again and again because it was that delicious!

Easy and good!  My daughter liked it better than regular lasagna!  I did add 8oz mushrooms, 2 cloves of garlic, and a little parsley.  I only had 1lb of ground beef and 1 package of frozen ravioli - so that was all I used and it turned out great.  One tip - I checked it after about 45 min and it was starting to burn a little.  So depending on your oven you may not want to cook for a full hour : )

This is a easy recipe that tastes great and takes no time to prepare! I added veggies to make it more flavorable but it would have been great with out it too.

I made a version of this recipe... I did one layer of cheese lasagna over sauce at bottom, then parmesean, more sauce to cover,then 2 10 oz frozen spinach (thawed & drained), then layer of Beef ravioli (did not use the loose ground beef), parmesean, sauce, then one more layer of cheese ravioli, parmesean, sauce, and finally mozarella on top.  Cooked for 45 minutes covered with foil, then 15 more minutes uncovered.  My family LOVED it!

This was an alright meal - I can't say it's something I'd do often or in place of my regular lasagna recipe, but it was something different to do with cheese ravioli.

This was much better than I expected it to be, and so simple using the frozen ravioli.  I did a layer of spinach ravioli, then mini cheese in the middle layer, then another of spinach.  Used sausage instead of beef.  Was out of mozz at the time and the last of my cottage cheese had gone bad (I always add that to my lasagna)so I just used extra parm throughout.  Will have to make this for my brother-in-law to try (he's Italian) and see what he thinks, frozen ravioli-sauce from a jar, oh no!

I would not describe this as lasanga, but more a noodle casserole. It needs ricotta or something more too it. I don't think I will make it again, it wasen't that great.

Delicious and fast to make. I halved the recipe, except for the sauce, and used turkey sausage. Baked for 25 minutes uncovered. Perfect!

I was surprised at how much this tasted like lasagna from scratch! I did double the spaghetti sauce -- used the large jar of traditional Prego, to  which I added a tsp of sugar and 2 tsp of Italian seasoning.  I may even add 8 oz of  tomato sauce next time, to make it a little saucier. I did add grated parmesan to the mozzarella layers, and garnished with fresh chopped parsley after baking. It made the whole house smell like a pizzeria. Excellent recipe, good shortcut tip without sacrificing taste.

For super lazy lasagna use beef ravioli instead of cooking beef to add. For richness add a layer of ricotta cheese mixed with garlic and other herbs.  It turns out so.darned.good !  A keeper and will use for future pot luck dish.

I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef, and used half Mozz and half Parm (personal preference).  Texture is fine, timing is fine, would lend itself well to personal tweaks.  However, I just don't much see the point of making this instead of real lasagna.  I mean, I could have just made the sauce and poured it over cooked ravioli and got the same thing.

I love this recipe. It's so quick and easy and you can make 2 and freeze one to reheat later. Just take it out of the freezer to thaw in the morning. Also, I had spinach to get a little more color and veggies in the meal.

I followed this recipe pretty closely.  I did 1 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. Italian sausage and I also added Italian seasoning to my meat mixture for flavor.  Followed other reviews and used about a jar and a half of sauce with another 1/4 cup water to rinse the jar and to avoid the "dryness" others experienced.  I liked the how easy it was to layer and not have to boil the ravioli!  Yum!  I divided this between 2 smaller quart casserole dishes, one for now, one for later!

I made this for my family based on a recipe by the National Cattlemans Association, it was basically the same recipe, except it says to add 1 1/2 cups of water to the sauce.  This may explain others dry ravioli.  I honestly can't comment on the flavor, as I don't eat cheese, so my family's opinion has to suffice.  They all loved it, including two friends who were visiting, all had 2nd helpings.  I did rinse the ravioli just in case, for moisture and thawing.   I substituted minced garlic for the onion.  As others mentioned, this is really not a Lasagna, rather a Baked Ravioli, but the family loved it nonetheless.  I will make it again.

Wow!  So easy and so tasty!!  I assembled mine the night before (while the ravioli were still frozen!) and it took a total of about 5 minutes.  We made a meatless version and doubled the sauce as suggested by other reviewers.  Turned out perfect!  My boyfriend requested that this become a "staple" among our meals.  Thanks for this simple, delicious recipe... I'll be passing it on to all my friends!

I have a hard time rating this recipe 1 star.  I've been trying recipes on this site for some 6 years and this is the first recipe I rate as "Terrible".

I followed the instructions to a T - I guess I should have read the review first.  There was not sufficient liquid and it turned out to be a dried-out waste of good ingredients.  Very disappointing!

Definatley NOT lasagna.  This was fairly easy to prepare, but not really very good.  I added 1 1/2 cups beef stock to the sauce to help with the moisture, but it was still VERY dry.  I couldn't even tell there was mozz cheese in the dish when prepared.

This was unusual for lasagna, and with all the cheese of course it was delicious!  However for me, I think I'll stick with my classic recipe.

Three cheers for being "lazy!"  Super easy dish when your either pressed for time or just to tired to cook. I too used Italian sausage instead of hamburger, threw in a chopped green bell pepper, and added a pinch of brown sugar to take the edge off of the spaghetti sauce (believe it or not - it also helps reduce heartburn!)  Very good! Served with garlic toast and you got a good meal! Thanks Missy!

Pretty good!  I didn’t thaw the ravioli and it baked just fine.  Next time I’ll add some cottage cheese in middle for a little extra moisture. Otherwise it was easy and very tasty.

This was really as easy as they claimed!

Our changes - light sautéing of the onions, with a teaspoon of minced garlic; substituted ground turkey, and seasoned with a little salt, freshly ground peppercorn and crushed red pepper; We planned to add spinach, but ultimately sautéed the spinach with a little olive oil and garlic and plated the lasagna on the spinach.

The next time, we will definitely add the spinach (and maybe other vegetables!) to the layers

I just made this last week for an co-worker going-away party. Everyone LOVED it. I used cheese ravioli, fresh spinach, fresh mushrooms, mexican shredded cheese, shredded carrots, chopped onions, black pepper, ground rosemary and garlic powder.  I've given the recipe to 3 people. I also made myself a batch to freeze up for ready-made meals for work. So simple and delicious.

Loved the simplicity, and my family ate enjoyed it, even my one year old.  I threw in a chopped zucchini too.

The only thing I changed based on all the reviews was instead of two jars of sauce I used one sauce and one diced tomatoes with the liquid.  It was easy and very very good.  I think switching it up with sausage sometime or meat ravioli would also be good.

This is a fairly quick and easy to make dish. However, it is not lasagna.  More or less it's a ravioli pasta with a tomato sauce. Reguardless it deserves 4 stars because it's easy and very yummy!

I've been making this recipe for a while now.  My husband and I kind of threw this recipe together one night and have used it every now and then since, when I saw it here I had to rate it.  This is an excellent quick evening dinner.  We don't thaw the raviolis, and we definitely don't use 3 pounds of it either.  Just enough to fill up a 9x13 dish and typically 1/2 a jar of sauce or so is enough.  Maybe it's the quality of the ravioli you buy that will make the recipe dry or not, but we've never had a problem.

This is good for a quick meal but I guess the quality of the frozen ravioli will make or break the dish.  Definitely a mid week after work quick dinner.

What a great shortcut!  I used Sausage instead of hamburger, and didn't thaw the ravioli's we had (missed that when reading).  I used 2 jars of sauce, otherwise it would've been too dry (for us).  The family LOVED this!

Easy and fantastic is all I can say!  This is a regular at our house.  Taste like lasagna without all the work, and I usually make two and freeze the second one for later.

This is one of my all time fav busy night meals! It is too easy to make and although I don't think it tastes exactly like a lasagna it does taste great. Since I went back to work I'm really relying on these type of recipes
more and more. Thanx!

We really enjoyed this. I used the bigger ravioli so I only used half the ravioli suggested. Use 2 jars spaghetti sauce.

I must say that this dish didn't taste much like lasagna to me. Don't get me wrong it tasted very good, and was somewhat easy to make.  I will say that my two kids LOVED IT.  So I think next time I make it, I will make a smaller amount, because it is a large dish for just 4 people, and its very filling.
