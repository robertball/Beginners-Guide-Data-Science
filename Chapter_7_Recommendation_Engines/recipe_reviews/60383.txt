These are all flavors I like and this did not disappoint me.  I did make a few changes, tho.  I used cream cheese with chives and onions (in the tub) and omitted the fresh chives.  I also used anchovy paste, instead of the fillets (just squirted some in until it looked like enough).  The dip had great flavor, and is definitely one I will continue to make.

Great recipe!  It completely disappeared and everyone asked for the recipe.  Note, I used the cream cheese with chives, and the anchovy paste as someone suggested; however, I think half-a-tube of the paste was a bit too much.  Next time I'll try  maybe 1/4 of a tube.

This is so good! I followed suggestion of previous user and used the cream cheese,chive and onion spread and anchovy paste, used 1/2 the tube.
Then spread it on fresh foccacia. It was a hit! Might be good using blue cheese as well
Thanks for sharing

Sorry, but I don't quite get the rave reviews. I wanted to enjoy this because I love feta and I love anchovies. But this just didn't do it for me.

This dip is delicious! I found it to have a lot of flavor -- lots of garlic and lots of feta (the anchovy adds richness but doesn't at all add a "fishy" flavor, if you're hesitant abou that). I made it a couple of hours before a party and found it to be very firm when I uncovered it at the party (I should have known better -- the cream cheese and feta naturally get firm in the fridge). Next time I'll make sure to take it out of the fridge at least 30 min prior to serving to allow the flavors to develop fully and make spreading easier.

This is really good! I used anchovy paste as suggested by some of the other reviews. Also added extra hot sauce and black pepper for some zip. This was very thick, so I thinned it out with some half and half.Great with pita chips.

I doubled the anchovies, and used half butter and half Smart Balance. Really yummy on crackers, toast and celery sticks. Thanks, Darlene!

This didn't go over as well as I'd hoped and it was my fault.  I KNOW better than to use fresh garlic in an uncooked dish, but I did it anyway in this one.  Fresh garlic should be used in dishes that will be cooked.  Fresh garlic varies so much; you never know if it will be too sharp or spicy or even "old" tasting.  The only way to ensure a nice garlic taste without fail in an uncooked dish is to use garlic paste which I will do the next time I make this.  Everyone who ate this complained of the strong garlic-ness and I agree.  The cloves I used were STRONG.  Also, I used anchovy paste as suggested by others and that worked out very well.  I will make this again, but I definitely will use garlic paste in the next batch.

This is GREAT! And we ate it on absolutely everything we could get our hands on.  I made it as the recipe states except that i used an entire tin of anchovies(7 total) which just made it richer tasting and not fishy in the least bit.  Absolutely delicious.

You must -- I repeat must -- love garlic.  If you do, you will love this dip.  We all loved it!  I made no changes except to use a little more anchovies than called for because I didn't know what else I was going to do with the 2 or 3 extra - and I figured it wouldn't hurt.
Then I tried a little experiment the next night - I took a few dollops put in a pan on low, added some half and half -- and then tossed in some cooked pasta and made myself a little side dish -- yum.

Wow was this good!  I only changed it slightly to reduce the fat content. I reduced the butter by 2 tbs and used low fat cream cheese and fat free feta.   Even my picky 18 y/o daughter loved it.  Of course I didn't tell her there were anchovies it. It is very garlicky though.  I am fine with that but some my not be.

I've been meaning to try this recipe for awhile now.  Finally got the opportunity this weekend when we had some friends over.  I made it exactly as written and really enjoyed it.  I must admit, however, that it did taste a bit fishy... which I personally liked.  DH didn't much care for it, though.  I'll definately make again and half the achovies, but only if he's going to be partaking :)  Great recipe.  Thanks :)

I made this according to the recipe and it just tasted like whipped cream cheese.  Adding some more hot sauce, lemon zest and lemon juice and sprinking it with hot paprika made it taste a bit better, but not worth doing again

OMG!  This is to die for.  I made it exactly as you said. The chives were freshly cut from my garden.  I went a bit heavy on the chives and the hot sauce (I use  Louisiana Crystal).  The only thing *seriously* wrong with this recipe is that I wanted to eat too much of it. :)  I can't wait for my husband to come home and try it.

You can easily make this pate healthier! I substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream and oil from the anchovies plus a couple of tablespoons of olive oil for 4 tablespoons of the butter. Next time I will leave out the butter entirely. Since we like strong flavors, I also doubled the anchovies and garlic and added the feta last, leaving some texture. Next time I will add chopped shrimp and parsley. Nice base recipe!

This came together very easily in just a few minutes.  After reading the reviews about the thick consistency, I elected to use my entire 2 oz can of anchovies, including the liquid to smooth it out a bit.   I added about 5 shakes of Tobasco and a touch more sour cream.  I like the consistency and flavor, but the butteriness is throwing me off, a bit.  I'm looking forward to my colleagues' response to it this evening.  THANKS for the recipe!

I think this dip was good but "to die for" is an overstatement.  Definitely use pastes (garlic & anchovy) as well as the lemon.  It's a nice change from sour cream and onion dip, goes well with veggies.  I'd be more curious to try this as a pasta sauce as RiverChef suggested.
