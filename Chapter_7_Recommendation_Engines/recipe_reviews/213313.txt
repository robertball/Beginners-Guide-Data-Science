Will definitely make this again!!!  Had to replace the Fiesta Nacho Cheese Soup with Cheddar Cheese soup since my grocery store doesn't carry the first.  Very easy and smells fantastic cooking.  I put it on low for 6 hours and warm for 2 which helped the chicken absorb the flavors a bit better.  Try adding some red pepper flakes, onion flakes, and some tabasco to give it a little more kick.

I make this soup, however I added a can of Rotel, a pack of taco seasoning, some red pepper, milk, and chicken broth from the breast I boiled. It came out great.

This Recipe has a good flavor, But it does come out a little bit on the thick side, but as the * says in the recipe to add more milk to thin down, and then it is great! i also have added a little bit of white pepper to this to give it more flavor.

Loved it and so did the group of friends and family I cooked it for. It was very easy to make and delicious for a chilly damp day. I did add an extra can of milk.

This soup was NOT GOOD.  It was more like a chip dip.  This soup turns out like a cheese dip!

The main problem with this recipe is that is has no "kick" despite being a tortilla soup.  I expected a thick soup that would remind me more of queso, but was disappointed when even my tablespoon of chili powder didn't help spice up this recipe.  I also added a half can of diced tomatoes.  I wouldn't make this again and plan on trying to salvage it by making it into a broccoli and cauliflower soup.

Delicious! I love this recipe. I didn't have the green chilis so I added a small jar of Pace thick and chunky. Also added a bag of frozen corn.  I will make this over and over....

Perfect for a cold day.  Added frozen corn and a can of black beans.   Adding sour cream to each bowl made it even better.

My husband requests this recipe all the time!  It's really, really good.  I just always add a little extra milk, a can of pinto beans, and a few green onions for flavor.
