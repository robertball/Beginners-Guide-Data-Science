YUMMY!! Thanks for a great recipe! I did have to sub the cottage cheese for sourcream and I left out the parm! But other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out great! I was able to get 6 fully stuffed rolls out of this. Which was fine, because I did lose a few noodles while cooking. My hubs really enjoyed these. I'll def be making again! I served with refried beans. I agree with the submitter....take the time to roll these up and everyone will be impressed!! I also used spaghetti noodles (broke down to toothpick size) to hold them together instead of the toothpick :)

why don't you use precooked cannelloni pasta? It's much easier to use and the result is the same.

I think everyone that says its to hard to roll up noodles its just plain laziness. because everyone that has eaten this recipe definitly appreciates the time and the presentation of the rollups instead of flat boring lasagna. Its not difficult it just takes a little time.

I used ground turkey for this recipe (I always sub ground turkey for ground beef).  I seasoned my ground turkey with onion & garlic powder and oregano, then  I added the taco mixture when it was done browning.  I used low sodium taco seasoning, as this recipe seems awefully high in sodium. I couldn't bring myself to throw a glop of the salsa con queso on top of the already dry looking lasagna noodles, so I diluted the queso with some milk, covering the entire noodle.  I ended up using only about half the jar.  In retrospect, I think heating the queso may have done the trick also. I will be making this again, but I will try adding fresh cilantro to the meat mixture next time and maybe some sliced green onions on top to garnish.  I served it with sour cream on top and salad. Very good!

Everyone loved this, I thought the hamburger could use a little more flavor; next time will have to adjust that a bit. Super easy; I did top with green enchilada sauce the 2nd time I made it, that was really good too.

Delicious - we loved this! takes some time to make but now and then I can't only make quick meals :) I had to use up some sour cream so I took advise from another review and used that in place of the cottage cheese (DH hates cottage cheese although he may not have detected it if I had used it) I made 12 roll-ups and carefully divided the mixture over them, they weren't too skimpy. I didn't change anything else - the quantity of salsa & salsa con queso were just right and I'll definitely make this again. I served with brown basmati cooked in beef broth - yum!

It was too difficult to roll up the lasagna. I just gave up and made a regular flat lasagna, but that still turned out well. I also used corn lasagna noodles, which worked fine.

Love.it!  My husband and my kids loved it!  That never happens!  I did make a couple of changes.  
#1.  I used a can of rotel instead of salsa
#2.  I used a jar of TOSTITOSÂ® Monterey Jack Queso instead of the yellow dip for the topping.

It was delicious and simple to make.  Thanks!

Our family loves this recipe! We have made it several times, with even our picky girls coming back for more! We have typically made it as directed, but tonight tried something a little different, and it turned out fabulous! We only used 1/2 lb ground beef, and replaced the other half with: around a cup of corn (frozen) and a cup of green pepper (chopped/frozen). We cooked it then added it in after the taco seasoning to the ground beef. It gave the dinner an extra vegetable, and a little added variety! 
Overall, this is a wonderful dinner, we make it about 1-2 times a month! Thank you for the recipe!

These were terrific!  We made them with sour cream and will definately be making them again.  For a big dinner we will make two pans one with chicken and the other with beef.  We will also put a side of refried beans with them.  Thanks again for sharing.

This was sooo delicious and flavorful! It's tasted like enchiladas wrapped up in a lasagna noodle; different, but worth trying!

A fun and unique recipe. I followed the directions exactly and it turned out great. I topped with sour cream. The left overs are just as good! My co-workers kept raving about how good the leftovers looked! Thanks for the recipe

Easy and simple recipe to spice up the same old same old. 
Everyone loved it, and many asked for the recipe after eating it ;) 

My only gripe for the recipe (and the reason for the 3 stars) is the massive sodium overload. Processed salsa is almost always very high in sodium, and when you combine that with the processed taco mix packets you have quite a large load of sodium mixed together. 
Use low sodium options.

REALLY GOOD!! While family loved it, which is pretty rare with our kids. We didnât do roll ups because I accidentally bought oven ready lasagna noodles. Just did it lasagna style with 2 layers of noodles. Very good dish!

I did everything accordingly 'cept the mexican blend cheese. Instead I used a pinch of sharp chedder and a couple handfuls of asadero and queso cotija cheeses. It was kind of dry looking when I took it out of the oven...not the lasagna but the cheese. Still good though! Just not picture perfect. This was fun to make. Def will make again! Next time I will dbl up the meat and use different cheese so it will be just as pretty as the rest of the pictures here!

Delicious variation!  The only changes I made involved seasoning.  Instead of the taco seasoning I used 2 tsp. oregano, 1 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp. chili powder.  I chopped some fresh cilantro and sprinkled it on top with the shredded cheese. My husband loved it, and I will definitely be making this again!
