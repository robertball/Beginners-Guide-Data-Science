SO GOOD!!!  I layered it... 9x13 baking dish A way to take it to a potluck....=D  Crispy t tots on bottom meat next a thin layer of refried beans next  shredded cheese (it will melt if all is hot or you could pop it in the oven at this point)  Have your salad bar toppings ready spoon out meat layers & then top with tomatoes, shred lettuce, shredded cheese, olives,onions... whatever you love  Next salsa or ranch or your fav dressing I top that with fresh cilantro. Everyone will want this recipe...

I made this for dinner yesterday and I made, what I thought, was too much to eat. But both my wife and I gobbled the whole thing up.  I didn't have minature tater tots so I used the regular sized one.  I think it would have been even better with the smaller ones. I also added some red onion and tomatoes.  I added ranch dressing on mine but my wife thought the sour cream was perfect for her.   This was  a good healthy dinner.

This was pretty good.  I would recommend making the beef as recommended on your taco-seasoning packet.  I would also recommend using the tator tot crowns.  I couldn't find minis either, and used regular which were a little too big for the toppings to stay on.  Plus, the crowns are flat, so more stuff can stick to it.  My hubby loved it and so did both kids.    I'll happily be making this again and I'll be cooking up some crispy crown tator tots!

Who would've thought tater tots for a taco salad?  But it works!  The thing that my hubby and I noticed off the bat is it isn't salty like it is when you use tortilla chips.  I used Ore-Ida crowns (flat tots) which worked out nicely.  I also used a lot of salsa instead of taco sauce and poured it over the top along with the sour cream. The salsa gave it the tomato chunks that would normally be in a taco salad.

My family really liked this twist on the traditional taco salad (a staple meal in our home).  Lighthouse has started making a salad dressing called jalapeno ranch. It is delicious--not too spicy. My 4 and 2 year old daughters like to dip veggies in it. We used this on the top of the taco tot salad and it was so yummy! I would suggest trying that too. We will use this recipe again.  Thanks.

I could not find miniature tater tots so I used Crispy Crowns. Because my boys are big eaters, I used a whole pound of meat. I made my own taco seasoning as well. Two cups of tater tots were more than enough, according to my husband for four people. We'll, two small boys and him, anyway. They topped their Crispy Crowns with the meat, shredded cheese, diced tomatoes, shredded lettuce, homemade salsa (instead of taco sauce), and a little reduced fat sour cream. It was a hit. Even the littlest went to town!

Loved it!  Everybody loved it, especially the kids!  It is important to get the tots super crispy and the more toppings the better!  Definitely will be making this again!

Absolutely delicious! The combination of potatoes with taco fixings is surprisingly tasty. I couldn't get over how much better this was than traditional nachos. We now make this at least once a week. Husband adds refried beans to his. I add taco sauce to mine. We tell all our friends and family to try this recipe!

For what it was, this was pretty good.  It was simple to make - great for a night where you gotta get dinner on the table, but don't have much time (or energy).  I did add onions in with the beef when it was cooking, and did not add the olives to the top. I, instead, used diced green onions.

You can't go wrong with this one.  I did add a layer of refried beans between the meat and cheese plus chopped tomatoes and onions on top.    I didn't have sour cream, but used ranch dressing as others suggested and a bit more salsa (in place of the taco sauce). I can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow (since it was only me, I couldn't finish it all)!  Thanks for posting this interesting switch from the typical taco salad, Eleanor.

This dish is so easy to make, and it tastes great! Like many others, I couldn't find the mini tater tots, so I used to crowns instead. I tossed them, to coat, in olive oil, and baked them according to the package directions, until they were nice and crispy. Also, based on previous reviews, I browned my ground beef (I used a pound for leftovers) and one packet of taco seasoning. I served the meat over the tater tots with lettuce, black olives, fresh tomato, cheddar cheese, sour cream, and Johnny's Jamaica Me Sweet, Hot, and Crazy sauce. It was a hit with the hubs and with me!

My husband really liked this dish, to his surprise.  I didn't enjoy it quite as much, but I like its versatility.  I think it would be a good meal for a large group of people who could pick and choose their toppings.  (Even the pickiest children would probably eat the tater tots!)  I would like to try adding beans next time.

I really didn't enjoy the tater tots in this as much as thought I would. Sorry, the texture was not as good as tortilla chips. And I think I would prefer some tomatoes or salsa instead of just taco sauce.

There is so much you can do with this recipe. Make it exactly as written for a great, yummy dinner. Or tweak it to suit your tastes. I used homemade taco seasoning (recipe on this site) and loved the results.

Good but I wasn't wow'd. I think that I will stick to using doritos instead of potatoes for a little crunch and spice.

this salad was good for something different.  we used ground turkey instead of beef but otherwise stayed true to the recipe.  i'm not sure still how much i like tater tots in my salad, but it was a nice change, just not sure how often we'll use it.  thanks!

We liked this.  Daughter has braces and isn't allowed to eat taco shells or chips, so the tots were a nice alternative.   Easy to put together and great for a quick meal that is filling and great tasting.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was okay, definitely nothing to brag home about.  I would much rather just make a salad with the traditional tortilla chips.  I really think if I didn't have chips but did have tater tots I still would just make up a salad without anything rather than use the tater tots again.  The tots didn't add anything to the recipe except grease.

I really liked this salad.  However, since tator tots can be heavy it was hard to eat the whole portion.  I especially liked how the taco seasoning and sauce coated the crispy tator tots.  I also used crowns as other reviewers had mentioned.

It was alright, but honestly, if I'm going to go through all the work to make the taco fixins' I'm going to just make taco salad shells or put it over tortilla chips for nachos.

My daughter picked this recipe and we put all the toppings called for here with the addition of chopped tomatoes, sliced green onions and  guacamole, just like we do for taco. My teenage sons LOVED it. My youngest called it supreme tots. :-)

This dish was ok, but not really what I expected.  Maybe it's just my family though because others seemed to really love it.

This was okay. It felt soggy to most of us and the texture of this dish was not appealing. I did chop onions, lettuce, tomatoes, olives, and jalapenos for toppings but we just were not impressed. Cool idea but it didn't work for my family.

This is a fantastic idea!  I just used what I had handy, substituting some heated Mexican-spiced black beans for the meat and taco seasoning (I did add some salt and pepper), and it was really satisfying and delicious!  Thanks for the inspiration, Eleanor!  From a fellow South Dakotan.

This is easy & good.  Also good with crushed fritoes in place of the potatoes. I make the full pound of meat & whole pkg. of taco mix. Then we eat half of it at a time, makes 2 meals for the 2 of us.  I add diced tomatoes to the lettuce.  You can also use salsa for the taco sauce.  Easy supper!!!

I found this recipe, because I had some leftover tater tots (1day old), and didn't want to waste them.  I broiled the tater tots to get them recrispy.  I had some leftover refried beans and a hambuger patty.  I heated up the beans and  hambuger patty together (crumbled the patty).  This was an awesome salad!!!!Definately make this again!!!I used three leftovers to make this salad.

This was very good.  My husband loved it!  The only thing I did different is make the meat as though I was making tacos.  I used a whole pound of ground meat and mixed it with water and and an entire packet of taco seasoning as the packet says to do when you are making tacos.

This was outstanding!  For the sake of convenience, I took the advice of some of the other comments and layered it all in a 9x13 pan, then baked it for a bit.  It's a new family favorite!

This was perfect for that evening I had little time and limited ingredients. Super simple and one I will make again. The tots were a nice change to your ordinary taco salad.

Pretty good stuff. I didn't have everything on hand so I had to change it around some. I added chili beans to the meat and didnt use olives or lettuce, only because I didn't have it. Yum Yum.

Yummmmy! Enough like the basic tacos that I knew my family would enjoy it, but just enough different to make it fun. I know that we all ate more of the lettuce and veggies than we would if we had just had tacos. 

Thanks for the great spin on an old favorite.

Unfortunately, we found this somewhat bland.  I think that it would be much better if the tator tots were seasoned.  We used ground chicken instead of beef, added onions to the meat, and a layer of refried beans on top of the tator tots.  I would've added tomatoes too if I had them.

UPDATE: I added guacamole, salt & pepper to the leftovers and left out the sour cream and lettuce and it was much better!

This was a nice twist to a taco salad.  I do prefer corn chips over the tater tots, though.  But I would make this again just to switch things up a bit or to work with ingredients on hand.  The four people I served this to all liked it and went back for seconds.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Eleanor!

Wow I was surprised how much we all really liked this!! DH was pleasantly surprised as well - he thought the idea of this recipe didn't sound so great but he really enjoyed this.  I doubled the recipe but not the taco seasoning - that was a perfect amount of seasoning.  We didn't have taco sauce so we used salsa.  And we used the flatter 'crowns' instead of mini potatoe puffs, they worked out great with this.  I used sour cream on mine but DH & SS used ranch dressing - so I can only speak of the sour cream but that was so perfect with this in my opinion anyway. We'll have this regularly!!

SO GOOD!! It seems odd at first, but it is awesome! Definitely use mini hash browns and cook the hamburger according to the taco seasoning packet directions. I added more lettuce to make it more of a "salad" and added a little salsa and ranch. Will DEFINITELY make this again!!

I love potatoes. 
This recipe was delicious!!
All materials were a good combination. :))
I’m Japanese and live in Japan, so the taco sauce is less commonly available around here.Moreover, I couldn’t find Tater Tots anywhere.So first of all, I looked for a taco sauce recipe on the net, and tried it.
Next, I used hash browns of Japanese manufacturers which were similar and cylindrical shape and small size in place of Tater Tots.
Here is a taco sauce recipe used.
1/2 -1can crushed tomatoes, a bit of ketchup, a bit of grated garlic, 1/4 grated onion, 1 tablespoon sake , 2 tablespoons vinegar and jalapeno sauce and salt to taste.:Put all of Ingredients in the pot, and let simmer for 10  minutes. And then Cool it.
This taco sauce that I made was likely quite different from store-bought brand one, so I'll try find out another recipe.
Anyway, this recipe is the best of my favorite one ever!!

Before I make any recipe I look through the most helpful reviews.  This was good but I did make modifications based on other reviewer's suggestions and my own taste.  I diced some yellow onion and browned it with my ground beef.  Then I drained the meat, put it back in the skillet, added the taco seasoning (and cooked it as I normally do by adding a little water and additional seasoning (a tad of seasoning salt, dried cilantro, and onion powder)).  I let that simmer for about 20 minutes.  In the meantime, I cut up lettuce, tomato, green onion (because we like green onion on our tacos), and black olives.  Once I was done with that I put my tater tot crowns (as others suggested) in my preheated oven.  Once they were done I immediately layered the tater tots in the bottom of the bowl, then meat, shredded chese (mixed blend), black olives, lettuce, tomato, green onion, sour cream and salsa.  The potatoes, meat and vegetables were a good combination.  My husband REALLY liked this as he is a meat and potatoes kind of guy.  Again, I thought this was good but didn't feel it was anything to write home about.  I would make this again but may try using shredded frozen potatoes or hashbrowns, layering and baking everything in the oven.

This was an awesome alternative to tortilla chips! I have made it with Thousand Island dressing and also with Green Goddess dressing!!! The green goddess dressing is my favorite!!!! My kids LOVED the tater tots! (I also used regular sized tots.)

This was very good and I loved the flavor but I still personally prefer the crunchiness of the tortilla chips.

Good recipe, forgot I didn't have tots so I used hash browns I had on hand.  Would definitely be better with tots.  My picky eater daughter loved it so we will most definitely make this again.

This was so good.  We really enjoyed it.  I think next time I will add just a little water to the meat mixture so it's not so dry, and add a few chopped tomatoes on top.

Easy and addictive. I like to cook the tater tots and meat (I use vegetarian burger crumbles) and then just set the toppings out in a buffet. It tastes wonderful and surprisingly refreshing.

This just did not taste good to me, for some reason. I didn't even finish my plate. I think I might try it again, but make it into more of a bake than a salad by baking the cooked tater tots, browned beef, and cheese together and then topping with the fixings.

Since I have been working in the evening, it has been up to Dad to feed the kids - so I've been on the lookout for easy recipes that they all will love.  This one fits the bill!! The kids like all of the ingredients and the adults were able to add extras like jalapenos, salsa and olives. This recipe will definitely go into Dad's cookbook for future meals!

I must admit that I almost did not print this recipe. It just seemed 'odd'. It may be quite odd, but wow this is a fun and delicious recipe. I doubled it and also added tomatoes, so we could actually say we ate a veggie. A couple of us used Ranch dressing instead of sour cream and yes, yes, yes, that was awesome. This is a keeper!

Yum!!! Made this for dinner tonight. Fridays are reserved for casual meals at our house. Either my fiance and I eat out, order pizza in or cook a no-fuss meal like this. And what a super addition to my Friday  rotation! My fiance has had a hankering for tacos lately, but I am not a fan of "tacos in a box" (i.e. store bought taco kits). This dish allowed me to please both of our palates. :) In order to use up what I had on hand (I wasn't about to go to the grocery store in the pouring rain!), I made a few substitutions / modifications. First, I used onion flavored tater tots (but in retrospect, I see why crowns would work better...). Second, I substituted taco flavored cheese for plain cheddar. Third, I added a small chopped onion to my beef (browned together, drained, then followed the instructions on my taco seasoning packet). Finally, I added a 10 oz. can of (well-drained) Rotel HOT diced tomatoes & habaneros to my cooked beef. I omitted the taco sauce and sour cream and instead topped my fiance's bowl with a bit of salsa I wanted to clear out of the fridge, mine with a drizzle of Ranch dressing and both with chopped green onion. I think next time (there WILL be a next time!), I'll do as Acc Chef recommended and layer everything in a casserole dish, bake and top with a variety of garnishes. Thanks for sharing your neat idea, Eleanor. The tots were certainly my favorite part lol! :-)

The whole family loved this!  I won't say it's the healthiest thing we've eaten, but very tasty and easy to do.  I skpped the taco sauce and just put a dollop of sour cream on top. Yum!  This one will be appearing regularly on our dinner table.

This was surprisingly good! I was hoping to find the mini tots but didn't, so I used the regular sized extra crunchy tots.  After putting the ground beef, cheese, onions, and olives on top of the baked tots, I put it back in the oven long enough to thoroughly melt the cheese.  I the nadded the sour cream, lettuce, and taco sauce.. the crunch of the tots to me made it seem extra delicious.

all it needed was some sour cream to top it off.  I did not have bacon, so I used bought bacon bits, and like the other readers, i just boiled potatoes while I was sauteing in the beginning.  Excellent.  Even added a little chicken. Mmmm good.

At first I thought tater tots were a strange addition to taco salad but it really works.  And my BF likes it because it's more substantial.

Excellent meal!  I wasn't sure about the whole "tator tot" idea with taco meat.  I did buy the mini-tots and cook them a little longer so they were crispy. It was great!  We added some guacamole, salsa, black olives, etc. to add some additional flavor.  Even the kids liked it!

So easy to prepare, this recipe’s a keeper. The tater tots provide a perfect base for the taco toppings, with the flavors complimenting each other. I used ground elk instead of beef, which was a first for me to cook with. The hunters in the family insist I try it. The meat was cooked following the directions on the taco seasoning packet, and it came out delicious.

This was yummy.  A great alternative to the deep fried tortilla.

This meal is so much fun.  My fiance couldn't figure out what I was doing till I set everything out on the counter and said ok, put the tots down first, then the meat, then go to town! We LOVED it! I took some advice from a review and bought the Litehouse Jalapeno Ranch dressing and mixed it 1/2 w sr cream it was DELICIOUS! Also had hot sauce on hand and added a little garlic powder to the meat. So good, will defenitely make this often. Used big tater tots as didn't have little ones, still great! Highly recommend trying!

This is one of my favorite recipes since I started making it about 6 months ago. I just use regular tots and serve it in large bowls. My kids love it too!

Since it's so economical, I used ground turkey instead of beef, a little extra seasoning with salt, pepper, ground cumin, and cayenne during the browning process and you'll never know the difference.  Delicious alternative when the family wants tacos.

We had this for dinner tonight and loved it!  We added refried beans and layered it all in a bowl!  Yummy!
