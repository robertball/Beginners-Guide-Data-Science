Quick, healthy, certainly easy, and delicious--and perfect for low carbers if you forego eating this without rice! I added rice wine to the broth/soy sauce mixture and fresh minced garlic to the vegetables. Stir fried all in sesame oil.  I did use a sirloin steak--one "No Name" was perfect for just myself, sliced thinly and across the grain while still semi-frozen. I used mushrooms, broccoli, red bell pepper, onion, baby bok choy and bean sprouts. This cooking method is so versatile, however, that any number of meats and/or vegetables would be equally as tasty.  Next time I might add some oyster sauce or hoisin sauce, although it is simply fine and fresh tasting as is.

This recipe was fairly quick and easy and uses lots of fresh veggies, but does need a bit more flavour.  I used fresh broc, red peppers and carrots along with fresh minced garlic.  I did add some red pepper flakes to the low sodium soy/broth and cornstarch mixture and then served over basmati rice.

The whole family LOVED this with no changes, even the uncle. All ages from 2 to 35 and everywhere inbetween. We will make this again for sure. Very good taste, very quick to whip up.

Anything that the whole family will eat, and there not be any leftovers is 5 star in my house.  This was very good.  For veggies we used yellow squash, zucchini, carrots, and red bell pepper.  In addition to the garlic powder we added two cloves of chopped garlic close to the end of cooking.  Hubby later admitted that he did add a little bit of red pepper flakes.  We will definitely make this again.

Good, quick dinner. Tastes NOTHING like chinese food, but it worked. I cheated and tweaked just a bit. I had a huge bag of frozen Stir Fry Veggies from Costco. Used 1/2 the bag. Used 1/3 of a stick of butter and began cooking the veggies. Pretty much followed the recipe after that. Used other reviewers suggestions of adding a T. of Chili Flakes and a T. of jarred, crushed garlic. This was a good quick dinner. Would make it again. It is not even American-ized Chinese Food.

Not bad. Cooked the veggies a little first then added the beef (we like our beef medium rare) Added a little more soy sauce, used real garlic and a lot of onion. I used green pepper, celery and carrots for veggies.

This recipe was absolutely great! It was quick and easy. I normally purchase stir fry sauce already in the bottle from the grocery store, but this recipe had ingredients to make the sauce. It tasted great and I didn't make any changes to the recipe at all!

This was very tasty and I wouldn't do a thing different with it. I did make up my own beef broth but other than that I followed it to a tee.

Great recipe!  I took the advice from some of the other reviews and added red pepper flakes and it added a little kick that rounded out the flavors perfectly!

Very good. I used 3 cups of frozen California style vegetables (broccoli,, carrots, cauliflower and zucchini) also added some ginger and used crushed garlic instead of garlic powder. Love my garlic!

I marinated the beef in soy sauce and teriyaki sauce with 1 minced clove of garlic.  The beef was very flavorful.  Hit with the whole family.

This was my first time making stir fry and I thought it turned out pretty good.  Like others, I added crushed red peppers since we like things spicy.  I also use Wok Oil, which I think added a nice flavor.

My husband liked this recipe but thought it was missing something.  I added some red pepper flacks and used a 16 oz. bag of frozen stir fry veggies.  It's definitely a quick dish to put together which is always very nice!

Yum yum!  Followed the recipe other than substituting minced garlic for the garlic powder, both the hubby and I loved it!  I have lots of leftover veggies, so we're having this recipe again tomorrow but with chicken and chicken broth rather than beef.  Lookng forward to more yummy!

It was what I was looking for.  Some recipes require either some ingredients I don't have or taste too salty for my palate.  This was just right.  I added it to fried rice but used brocolli for the stir fry.  If you are looking for a more authentic flavor, keep looking.  The reviewers that say this is an americanized flavor are correct.  I made recipe as it called for--using higher quality beef stew meat & used beef bullion with water since I didn't have a can of beef broth.  Our house enjoyed this recipe, thank you!!

We enjoyed this a lot.  I did add crushed red pepper flakes and garlic as suggested by other reviewers.  Even with these additions, I felt like some flavor was missing.  Next time I think I will marinate the beef overnight.

It was OK, but not a traditional chinese stir fry taste. Tastes more like beef gravy...even with all the soy sauce.

The appearance of the dish is quite appealing on the table but the taste was pretty mediocre.  Needs to be kicked up a bit with some seasonings.  Tasted too much like beef broth.

Loved it!  I realized once I started cooking that I didn't have any soy sauce so I substituted it with Worcestershire sauce not sure of what to expect but it turned out delicious.  I also seasoned my meat prior to cooking for more flavor.  I will definitely be making this quick and tasty dish again.

Fast, easy and tasty.  We use it when cuts of meat are on sale because we always have everything on hand to whip it up.  I really appreciate any recipe that is this fast and filling, sometimes when I get home from work this type of meal is the only kind I have the energy to prepare..  Thanks for sharing.

Really good!  I only used one tbsp of Soy because my GF doesnt love it but that was the only change.  The random veggies I used were zucchini, mushrooms, red pepper, and white onion.  Perfect!

Another family favorite! Added garlic with the meat is the only change I made. Excellent!

I loved this. It was super easy and gave me the taste and consistency I was looking for. I used green and red bell peppers for the veggies and a NY strip instead of sirloin (what I had on hand). The only thing I did different from the recipe was added crushed red pepper after I had dished the kiddie's out. Definitely a keeper!

very tasty dish. i tweaked it a bit by adding red onions, mushrooms, and a couple cloves of finely chopped fresh garlic. i forgot to add the garlic powder when i added the veggies, but the fresh garlic worked out just fine. i also used venison instead of beef but either would be awesome in this dish. thumbs up on this one!!!

This was very good.  We used pork shoulder instead of beef.  I did add a bit of wasabi horseradish as I was cooking the meat to add a bit of flavor and heat.

This is a great, easy to make stir fry.  Very similar to the Green Pepper Steak mix.

I've made several different Beef Stir-fry dishes and this one was definately a hit with my family.  We've made this about five times now and it's still a favorite.  Very versitile dish that can be made to suite your own taste.  We love it as is.  I have noticed that using Campbell's condensed Beef Broth does give it a richer flavor than using my own beef broth.

This was quick and easy...a little bland, as stated by others.  If I make it again, I will probably add a little ginger, more garlic, possibly a little more soy sauce.  I don't know...it was missing something crucial...I'm just unsure what exactly it is!

One of the fastest recipes to put together. This is going to be a family favorite. No need to spend hours cooking when it can be ready in less than an hour.

My family and I enjoyed this recipe very much. The only thing I did different was to use fresh garlic as I was out of garlic powder. This was absolutely delicious!

Next time I will try without the cornstarch.  It made the sauce to 'starchy' for my taste.

Great. With a little tweeting you can create the worlds best. I use left over sirlion tip roast which is already sliced thin. Stir fry whatever vegi you have around, add your favorate sauce, turn off the burners, stir and your in for a treat.

Really easy basic recipe that takes just a few minutes to make. Just what I was looking for since this was my first stir fry. I used broccoli and squash as my veggies. Will definitely make this again but will likely spice it up a bit with some ginger or red pepper flakes.
