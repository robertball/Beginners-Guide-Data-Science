I have made this cake for years, but in mine I use 1 tsp. cloves.  Also this recipe orginally called for two 4 oz. jars of baby food plums, but I am not able to find them any longer, so I now use 1 cup of canned plums peeled and mashed or pur√©ed.

Yes, it is very moist, however, way too sweet.  The next time I make it, I will only use 1/2-1 cup of sugar and increase the flour.  I was glad I did not use the glaze because that would have made it even sweeter.

I remember a baby food plum cake from the past and thought I had found the recipe. Wrong!!  Something is off in this recipe.  Took one bite, tried it on my wife, tried another bite then threw it away.  Sorry!!

This is one of my favorite cakes. My mom used to make this cake when I was a little girl. For it being a spice cake it is out of this world and super duper easy to make

This is always a favorite at our house during the holidays.  Its ok if you don't have any red food coloring, the cake will just be pink instead of deep red.

This recipe seems weird but the baby food makes this cake really moist and fragrant.  I cut it up and froze some pieces to eat later throughout the month....it seems to freeze well.  I made frosting out of confectioners sugar, butter, vanilla and a few tablespoons of chopped canned plums or baby food.
