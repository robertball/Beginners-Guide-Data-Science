This was very good!  I added 1/2 cup orange juice and 1/2 tsp. orange extract.  If there was a fresh orange I would have grated some orange rind into the mixture.  Cheated and cooked it on the top of the stove for about 20-30 minutes on a low heat stirring often.

Very nice little recipe. I decided to make it on the stove top right before my turkey was done cooking, hence I had no room for it in the oven. I used around 7 oz of Triple sec and it turned out quite nice and it only took around 20-30 minutes to get it to the desired consistency. 
My husband really liked it and wants me to make it again for Christmas.

Very good.  I did not have orange juice so I used the juice of one orange and some zest.  I divided the sugar for 1/2 cup brown sugar and 3/4 white sugar.  Also didnot have Grand Marnier but used Orange Triple Sec liqueur.  Baked in oven for 1 -1/2 hours at 275 in a taller cast iron pan.  Other recipes mentioned boiling over but with the lower temp, higher sided pan, I did not have any issues.  At the end, I used a potato masher to create thickness.  We used the cranberry sauce to mix with BBQ sauce over left over Turkey.  It was very awesome!

I love Grand Marnier so I was tickled to find this recipe. I made it a week ago and pulled it out to "taste" before the big day and I was disappointed to not taste that rich Grand Marnier flavor. Maybe I will try this with more G.M. next time

I do not even like cranberry sauce but my husband insisted he had to have it.  This is by far the BEST cranberry sauce I have ever had.  Had some leftover and made cranberry oat bars.  Recipe is perfect as is.

I made it just as directed and it was perfect. I used Grand Marnier and it added a zip that everyone loved. This recipe will become a Thanksgiving tradition.

So easy and delicious!!  After making this just one time, I vow to NEVER EVER buy canned cranberry 'jelly' again!!
It tasted so good, that my daughter and I wanted to eat it by itself like it was a pudding.  Thank you for the awesome recipe!!
