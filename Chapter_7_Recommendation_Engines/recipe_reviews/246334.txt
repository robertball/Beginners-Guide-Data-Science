Ground turkey is not normally one of my favorite meats, but what really worked with this for me was all the spices. The meat was full of flavor. I chose to use white balsamic vinegar rather than the dark because I prefer it. I began making this and then realized I didn't have any tomato paste, so I used some tomato sauce with basil, garlic, and oregano in it and thickened it with just a little flour. Also, I was apprehensive but added the tablespoon of salt to the zucchini. But I could not add any more salt to the meat as it cooked. I'm glad I didn't. It was seasoned just fine. One thing I love about this recipe is that the pan it cooks in goes from stove top to oven. Not a lot of dirty dishes to clean up.

My family loves  zoodles and this is a fantastic recipe! I made a few adjustments that I think made it even yummier and perhaps a bit more nutritious.  I sautéed one chopped onion and one chopped green pepper in olive oil and minced garlic before adding the turkey for browning.  I significantly reduced the onion powder and  garlic powder and omitted the garlic salt altogether. I didn't add more oil or garlic when I added the diced tomatoes and tomato paste. The sauce was looking a little dry for my taste, probably because of the added onion and pepper, so I added a second can of diced tomatoes.  After simmering the meat mixture with the tomatoes, tomato paste and spices for  7-10 minutes, I added a cup or so of chopped mushrooms.  When the mushrooms were tender, I removed the pot from the heat and stirred in a couple of large handfuls of a bagged spinach/kale mix I had on hand.  Once the leaves wilted a bit it was time to add the zoodles and proceed as the recipe directed.  Because I used a dutch oven rather than a skillet, I put everything in a lasagna pan before adding the cottage cheese and mozzarella, but I'll definitely try this as a "one dish" meal in the future. I haven't had such an enthusiastic response to a new recipe in a while; this is a healthy meal that will be repeated many times at our house!

Was delicious!!! Made a few minor tweaks. I only used 2 medium zucchini and that was plenty. I try to cut out as much salt as possible, so I didn't do the sprinkling with a tablespoon of salt, just patted the zucchini dry after spiralizing. Omitted the garlic salt, I thought the garlic powder and minced garlic was enough. I don't have an oven proof skillet, so I used a regular skillet and transferred it into a 13 x 9 baking pan lined with foil when it was time for baking. This recipe will definitely be going in the cookbook!

This is a great low cal meal and it's really tasty.  I felt like I had eaten a big plate of pasta, but there are hardly and carbs (just the cheese).  My husband loved it too.  I reduced the amount of balsamic vinegar and used ground turkey breast (to reduce the fat).  I also substituted the marinara sauce with San Marzano peeled tomatoes (they always make a more favorable sauce.)  I will definitely make this again.

I added fresh parsley and basil. Also added chopped red pepper and mushrooms. I did not salt and drain my zoodles.. I just added them with the meat and sauce and veggies. Baked as directed and put under the broiler for 2 minutes. It reminds you of lasagne. Delicious!!!!!!!tmj.

This was pretty easy and my husband and teen girls loved it.  It was even better the next day.  The salting and patting of the noodles is time consuming, may try skipping the salting next time.  As for saltiness, it was plenty salty, but none of us felt it was too salty.  Great way to get more veggies in, and hubby needs to watch blood sugar, so I’ll definitely make it again.

Turned out great, but next time I'll cut out the Tbsp of salt on the zoodles & dry them in paper towels instead.

Excellent!  One tip- if you are in a hurry, skip the part that makes the sauce and use jar marinara sauce- it turned out great!

I was surprised at how much the zucchini shrunk up after the salting process. That really kept them from getting mushy. Everyone loved this dish and I will definitely make it again.  The only change that I made was omitting the red pepper flakes.

I used low fat ground pork, it was what I had. Everything else as written in this recipe. I imagine it is great with the turkey or ground beef as well. This is delicious! A keeper and rated going in my cookbook binder!

Sorry, way too salty.  I should have listened to the other reviewers and reduced the salt by half or more and season to taste.  I ended up adding another can of diced tomatoes and tons of sugar to even out the saltiness, it didn’t work.  I am using this as a sauce on top of regular noodles and I still find it too salty.

Thought the flavor in this was really good (although my son age 13 wasn't a big fan).  I used 2 packages of 10 oz zoodles and I don't think that was enough. Next time I will have to buy more or actually spiralize them myself.  I was nervous only using diced tomatoes and not adding any tomato sauce but it turned out good.  I decided to use beef instead of the turkey and only 1 Tbs. of balsamic vinegar for our taste.  Added a little diced onion while cooking the beef.  I will make this again and my son can eat PB&J!

It was fabulous! Whole family loved it! Even heated up well for leftovers. After letting it sit with salt on it in the colander, I used a towel to squeeze out as much liquid as possible before putting it in the pan.

Made sure to use no salt added stuff when I could and added more cheese. This was my first foray into zoodles, and it turned out delicious. Will definitely make again.

I used our ground venison mix instead of ground turkey.  Taste was fine for me, but my husband didn't agree.  Maybe I didn't cook it long enough before the oven stage, or the zucchini released more liquid than expected, but it was more watery than I'd like.  He's not a zucchini fan, so his opinion isn't a big factor for this one, bu I probably won't make this again.

The whole family really enjoyed this  and have collectively decided that it is something to be made again.  I felt it was a little heavy on the balsamic vinegar and will probably scale that back a little next time.  I would also add onion with the turkey mixture.

I followed the recipe and found the garlic overpowered all the other herbs/spices. My dad agreed this was rather bland..
