Tasty!  My review is based on the published recipe (not some drastically altered variation.)  The only substitution I made was because I couldn't find sherry vinegar in either of two grocery stores.  Per Internet recommendations I used rice wine vinegar as a substitute.  This was my only deviation from the recipe.

It was delicious.  Cool, refreshing, and mellow compared to its tomato based siblings. It was even tastier on day 2. Maybe my cukes were extra juicy, but I thought adding 1.5 cups of water was a little much.   I suggest adding that "to taste".  1 cup would have been sufficient.  Straining the soup produced a more refined texture, but is unnecessisarily fussy and just makes more dishes.  Don't bother.  Creme fraiche is a little spendy.   Plain yogurt would probably be great.

I made this using the suggested ingredients. It's very tasty. I don't have a blender so had to use what I have (a mini chopper) which made it quite fussy since I had to blend many batches. There was also a lot of "stuff" when I strained the gazpacho - probably because of not having a good blender.

Next time I'll probably leave the bread out or cut way back on it. And will probably not strain it. Definitely worth making again.

very hot today.  This was delicious and refreshing.  Like everyone, I will tweak to personal taste, but there's no point in reviewing my own take on it.  Just noting for those who wondered, the bread is pureed and then strained as a thickener (and add some subtle flavor) to the soup.  Even though it may seem like there is no point since you strain it out, bread as a thickener is a great traditional method that adds a richer, more velvety mouth to the dish.  I suspect it might be a little watery without it (but I've been wrong before :)

The flavor was great. I used Greek yougurt lacking the creme. I'm not sure what purpose the bread serves only to get strained out... Will make again and try without the bread next time.

Loved this Gazpacho. I added a few other ingredients: yellow and orange peppers, yellow cherry tomatoes. I also changed some of the ingredients: used Salvadoran cream instead, yellow onion, and red wine vinegar instead. I omitted the bread completely because we eat gluten-free and didn't add grapes.  It was delicious.

Tried it to see. Probably a fine recipe but not something we like to eat.

Loved this. I would reduce vinegar by at least 1/2 t. Our guests went nuts over it. I didn't strain either, as others have said, but also didn't have any lumps in the soup.

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except for the cr√®me fraiche (didn' have any)and used lemon juice instead of vinegar (no real reason). I like my gazpacho with croutons so I had to leave out the bread, it would be too fattening otherwise! It still came out nice and creamy because when I passed it through the sieve I really went all the way till I got all the goodness out and was left with only 1 tbs of fibre in the sieve. This was such a nice change from the red gazpacho which I make so often. Thanks Chef John!
