MOZ, YOU WERE RIGHT ON THE MONEY WITH YOUR 5-STAR SELF RATING!  MY FAMILY LOVED THIS AND I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.  MY TWEAKS:  I USED A KENTUCKY SMALL BATCH WHISKEY, BUFFALO TRACE ( MY HUSBAND'S  FAVE).  I INCREASED THE WHISKEY TO 3 OZ B/C MY RAISINS WERE VERY DRIED OUT AND NEEDED THE EXTRA MOISTURE.  I USED DARK BROWN SUGAR B/C THAT'S ALL I HAD.  I COOKED THE STEAKS FOR 4 MINUTES ON EACH SIDE FOR MEDIUM RARE, AND DEGLAZED THE PAN WITH SOME CHARDONNAY WINE TO MAKE IT EASIER TO POUR OVER THE STEAK.  I SERVED IT WITH SAUTEED MUSHROOMS AND THE RAISINS TO RAVE REVIEWS!

Excellent Flavor! I used a beef loin tip steak and it turned out great. I doubled the marinade, then reduced it once the steaks were done. Added the raisins to the marinade reduction, served over top the steaks and mixed remaining into brown rice. The reduced sauce mixed and tasted great with the rice. Would like to try with chicken and port also. Will definitely make again.

For me, this needed something other than whiskey to flavor it... seemed bland even though I sprinkled salt & pepper on the steaks while they cooked.

I made one little substitution... I am not a big "cooked raisin" fan so I traded onions for the raisins!
Love the whisky taste and the sweet, caramel-y smell and taste!
