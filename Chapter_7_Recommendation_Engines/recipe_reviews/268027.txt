I made the first set of wings (my Instant Pot only fit about six wings on the trivet) to the letter for the recipe. They came out great except that I had a hard time getting the sauce to stick to the wings. I found the best way to do this was cook them as instructed in the Instant Pot, then coat them in the sauce, broil them for five minutes, coat them again, and broil them for three minutes. This gives the wings a saucier flavor and allows for easy dipping as they are no longer "wet." All in all, these turned out great and were a big hit!

I made this for a party and everyone RAVED about them. I used chicken thighs instead of wings and they were unbelievable!

Excellent recipe. My picky grandkids loved it and wanted more. Will double recipe next time. This is also great as a carry in. One change made as kiddos loathe anything hot and spicy. Stuck with Ranch Dressing all around. Love the idea and technique of finishing under the broiler.

Tried this recipe out in my Breville pressure cooker because I LOVE chicken wings. Results were just “meh”. Way too tender (fall-off-the-bone) for my tastes. In addition, the sauce was just so so, not as robust as I like. Deep fried is my favorite method, but not as healthy. Recently tried in an air fryer with quite satisfying results, will probably stick with that.

I made these and had a couple want to fall off the bone taking them out of the Instapot.  It did take a little longer under the broiler than five minutes for me.  They turned out very well and I will make them again.

Loved it! Added a little garlic powder to wings before cooking. They were easy and yummy!

Very tender.   I needed to broil them 7 minutes a side to get them crispy.   Definitely plan to make them again!
