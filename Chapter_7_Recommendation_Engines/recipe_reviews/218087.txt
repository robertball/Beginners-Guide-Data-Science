I followed the recipe exactly, but cooked it in the oven and it was very tasty and moist. It came together easy and looked so pretty! Fresh herbs are the key! Thanks so much for sharing as this is definitely a keeper!

When reading the recipe, I thought wow, this should be really good!  But I made a couple of modifications that proved to be the undoing of this meal.  My thought was if I seared the pork chops directly on the grill first, before placing the other ingredients on top, they’d take on a nice grilled exterior and a smokier flavor.   After searing the chops I transferred them to a foil tray.  I layered on the tomatoes, basil, garlic and mozzarella and then put the pan back on the grill.    However, by doing this, the flavors didn’t get a chance to marry. This likely wouldn’t have been the case had I followed the directions as written.  As a result, my version was a disappointing two stars, whereas had I followed directions it would likely have been rated the four stars I originally expected it to be.

This recipe is titled correctly.  It is AMAZING!  It is easy to prepare and it is delicious.  I used shredded   mozzarella because that is the type I had on hand.  I prepared 10 pork chops. and served at a brunch, along with fresh fruit, fluffy scrambled eggs, homemade hash browns and toast.  I did not explain to our guests what the dish was named other than it was a pork chop.  It took less than 3 minutes for someone to say, "This is delicious - it tastes just like pizza. WOW"  These chops could be served at any meal or for any occasion.  I have added it to my future holiday menu for the Thanksgiving/Christmas holidays.  Thank you so much for sharing. A definite keeper for me!

Prepared for the Recipe Group this week. We really enjoyed these tender and juicy chops! Followed the recipe, only adding a little Grill Mates seasoning along with the salt and pepper. Hubby threw the chops on a screaming hot grill for just a minute to sear them before putting them in the pan and proceeding with the recipe. We love that you can taste each of  fresh flavors from the tomatoes, basil, oregano and mozarella. Taste like Pizza....but also tastes like summer! This will be be a staple during grilling season. Thanks for sharing, CNM!

This method makes a juicy and tender pork chop. The chops pretty much 'steam' in their own juices and those of the tomatoes. The flavor of the fresh herbs comes through nicely and the dish is reminiscent of pizza. I used provolone because that's what I had on hand. Be sure to season the chops liberally with salt and pepper! I served this with fettuccine in pesto sauce and a green salad. I made this for Recipe Group and it was a big hit with my family, thanks for sharing this!

Outstanding! We absolutely LOVED these! I made 3 thick boneless chops &  also 1 blsl chicken breast using this recipe/method but only leaving on the grill 20 min. Both were equally incredible! Our only complaint is....no leftovers:(

I cooked these in the oven, not on the grill. I also increased the garlic a bit and I also seared the pork chops in a hot skillet before proceeding with the rest of the ingredients. I think these would be even better with a homemade marinara sauce, to maybe make them more "pizza" like. This would make a good hot sandwich filling, too, like on ciabatta bread or a good french bread. As is, we liked these. I served them with herbed pasta and a tossed green salad. I'll make this again.

I'm not a huge fan of cooking pork chops as I've made some pretty bad ones in the past.  It's hard for me to get good flavor and not overdoing them.  But this recipe was so easy and the pork turned out perfect.  I didn't think that it tasted too pizza-y.  It was more like a beautiful explosion of fresh flavor.  It's definitely a keeper.

FANTASTIC!  I loved how easy this was to make.  Put it on the grill and forget about it.  25 minutes was perfect for my grill.  The combination of oregano and basil with the tomato and mozzarella really reminded me of pizza!  I loved being able to use my home grown herbs.  I only wish my Ramapo tomatoes were ready.  (Next time)  My only changes were to use shredded mozzarella and put the herbs on before the tomato.  You have a winner in my book, Andy!!!   Thanks for sharing!

We LOVED, LOVED, LOVED these! My grill is currently out of comission, lol, so I seasoned the chops w/ salt, pepper, garlic powder and dried oregano (had no fresh) and quickly seared them in a pan, put them onto a cookie sheet and baked them @350 degrees for about 15 minutes. I took them out and topped them with the basil, tomatoes and cheese (I used shredded mozzarella & completely forgot to use the olive oil), and put them back in for another 10 minutes or so...they were PERFECT! The flavors are so fresh and go extremely well together. Hubby said I could make these for him anytime, and that is a major compliment coming from him, lol! Thanks, Andy, for sharing such a wonderfully delicious recipe that I will be making over and over again~YUM! :)

I am the recipe submitter and I just wanted to clarify since there are so many reviews say they dont taste like pizza. These were named by my then 5 yr old daughter that is the only reason they are named "pizza pork chops".  I would also like to thank everyone who has tried them for the great reviews. I'm glad you liked them. For those of you who will try them in the future. I hope you like them and will come back and leave a great review. Thanks Again!

I just grilled these for breakfast and they are great! I used charcoal and hickory chunks and just grilled them directly on the grill, thanks for a great new way to do pork chops!

Excellent. We really liked these... great fresh flavors. I loved how easy it was to cook... just stuck it on the grill and lounged on the deck for 20 minutes. I did put the herbs under the tomato because I'm a rebel like that. ;) Thanks!

This recipe is absolutely delicious! Even my husband who doesn't care for pork chops ate several of them. Very juicy. I did this on the stove top and the whole thing took 25 minutes including prep time. I heated a fry pan coated with Pam cooking spray on med. high heat. I browned the chops on one side and then turned them. I skipped the olive oil and topped with the rest of the ingredients including the cheese. I covered the pan and turned down the heat for 10 minutes. The cheese was melted and the chops were cooked through. Very moist and the dish is beautiful.  It made my whole house smell heavenly! Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will be using it for years to come!

My family raved! I usually don't but I added a bit. I added a teaspoon of pizza sause to each chop, sliced olives onuons and mushrooms (sauteed). Treat this one as if it's a pizza and it will be amazing. I never penalize recipes because I added. Everone is different and likes different things. The basic recipe is what is meant to be enjoyed. If you add the sauce don't skimp on the tomato as it adds a touch of summery freshness. This was easy peasy.  Absoloutely DELISH! TX

I added a little steak seasoning and only had a bit of basil so perhaps the 'pizza' aspect was lost, but it was still very tasty. We did this indoors using a grill pan and pot lid for a similar effect. Served it with a basil & Parmesan orzo (recipe from AR).

Easy and delicious...as you can see from my photo, I made sandwiches out of them on whole wheat buns. I did use dried Mexican oregano, cus that's really the only kind we like... but, the basil was fresh from the garden. Thanks CNM!

Made this last night for supper.  I've want to make these since I found the recipe!  I was cooking for just myself & wanted something with great flavor, quick & easy.  I used a boneless skinless chicken breast because I didn't have a pork chop, fresh basil and fresh "Hot n Spicy" oregano, and fresh garlic.  I wanted a meal all in one packet so I made my foil packet with sliced zucchini & onion plus 1/3 of the herbs under the chicken,  the chicken, seasoned with salt & pepper, then 1/3 more herbs, the tomato (used 3 thick slices).  Drizzled the whole thing with a little dry white wine & EVOO.  Discovered my grill was out of gas so I baked it in the oven @ 350 degrees for 30 minutes, opened the packet & added a little parmesan & a big handfull of shredded mozzarella cheese.  Back into the oven (with the packet open) for 5 or 6 minutes.  Served with garlic toast & a tossed salad.  It was one terrific meal!  I can't wait for my family to get hojme so I can make it for them, too -  I know they will enjoy it as much as I did!

We enjoyed these pork chops!  We did sear these on the grill first and then proceeded with the recipe.  I used a shredded mozzarella/provolone blend and I didn't recover the pan after adding the cheese, as the residual heat was enough to melt the cheese.  Fresh basil and oregano, and garden tomatoes are key to this recipe.  Thanks CNM!

Made for Recipe Group. Hubby liked them really well. They had a good flavor. I used dried herbs, but think the flavor would be more 'pizza like' with fresh. I was out at the time, but will try them again. Thanks!

Yum!  It does remind me of pizza.  The pork chops came out juicy and flavorful.  I followed the recipe as written except I baked them in the oven instead of on the grill.  I used fresh mozzarella and fresh basil and oregano.  We will be making this again.  Next time to match our pizza preferences I might top it with some sliced red onion and crushed red pepper.

Great! It was like an explosion of fresh flavors! My husband doesn't like pork chops and loved this! I do not own a grill so I baked this in a covered dish for 30 minutes at 350*F. I put the cheese on and baked for 3 minutes more, uncovered. So easy!

These pork chops were fantastic. I omittted the garlic and seared the pork chops for 2 minutes first. Great way to use summer tomatoes. GREAT RECIPE.

These pork chops were excellent!!  My grill died and I didn't have fresh herbs. . .so here is what I needed to do that was different.  I sliced the tomatoes (Romas in 1/4" slices lengthwise) and let them sit in the marinade of 1 T dried basil, 1 t dried oregano, 1 t minced garlic, and 2 T olive oil while I broiled the pork chops until they were 165 internal temp. I then put the marinated tomatoes on the pork chops (2 slices per pork chop), split the remaining marinade between all of the chops, and topped them with a slice of mozzarella.  They went back to the broiler until the cheese was melted and bubbly.  I'm sorry for tweaking the recipe with just the dried herbs and broiling. . .grilling and fresh would be more than I could imagine!  :o)  Can't wait to try them again and thank you for your amazing recipe!!

We made these on the charcoal grill, first put some searing on each side, then put them in a pan and topped with garden fresh herbs and the cheese and tomatoes. Then cooked on indirect heat until they reached 160 degrees. Very good and different from our regular pork chop recipes. Oh and we didn't cover, DH refused to loose his charcoal taste. They were still nice and moist.

These were very good. I don't have an outdoor grill, so I just modified it for the oven. Had a great flavor. Hubby doesn't like pork chops very much, but he thought these were pretty good. I think it would be great for chicken too. Thanks for sharing!

The man just said he would have this easily once a week.  I have never heard anything like that ever come out of his mouth!  The name 'pizza pork chops' really ruined it for him but luckily the taste renewed him.  The flavor is so nice. I can see where the pizza comes from but really it just tastes super fresh - fresh thick cut tomato covered in fresh herbs, flavored with fresh garlic and covered in cheese.  Thinner cut pork chops were done quicker (14 minutes) but I had trimmed out the bone and wish I had trimmed all the fat off because it's harder to see afterwards, but I was worried about needing the fat to lend to the moisture but it was fine. The hubby commented that they didn't look done, but really it doesn't look 'grilled' for grilled pork chops.  They were definitely done and yummy in my tummy.  Promise!

I thought these pork chops were good....but not AMAZING! I also didn't think they tasted like pizza. I would say they tasted like an Italian pork chop, but not pizza. Maybe I expected more because of the title saying AMAZING, but I was alittle let down. They were tasty, but I expected more. These will not be in my regular dinner roation.

These are great pork chops!! Didn't change a thing.  Not sure it tasted like pizza, but the flavors were fantastic.  Made them for lunch today at the shop for the guys.  They loved them.  Had fresh corn on the cob and garlic bread.  A great recipe!

This is one of the few times I made a pork chop that wasn't try and semi-tasteless.  Great stuff!  I used the oven instead of a grill but got the same result.  Yums.

Made this for Recipe Group:  4, June '11  What a fantastic way to grill dinner.  Put it in a foil pan and forget about it for the next 25 minutes.  CNM we loved these pork chops.  I used bone-in as that is what I had on hand and they came out great.  Huge hit with my family - sorry we didn't have leftovers.  Definitely will be in the summer grilling rotation.  Thanks for sharing.

These were very good! I didn't have fresh basil and oregano, but sprinkled lightly with dried and it was great!  Very tender.  Tomatoes fresh from the garden made it very tasty.  I will make again.

These are really good.  I thought this recipe would be great to use up some pepperoni and tomato sauce and went full speed ahead . . .until I really read it and realized it didn't call for tomato sauce and pepperoni.  At all.  Oops.  At that point, however, it was already cooking.  I will have to try this again as written, but I really have to say that I liked my additions but I think this would be absolutely delicious as is.  I love the combo of herbs, tomato, and cheese, and on top of pork chops it was delicious.  I didn't grill but baked at 350 for approximately 30-40 minutes.  I think the pepperoni topping protected the chops from drying out.  Thanks for the recipe!

No body jumped up and said "this tastes like pizza". They did rave about the flavor though. I made this last night for supper. It was so good that I tried it again today, only I used chicken breasts, again another big hit. Wife said that this is her new favorite way to have chicken. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

My family wasn't in love with this recipe, which surprised me as we love all of the ingredients in it. I can't put my finger on what the issue was, it just had no WOW factor.

Not bad! My husband LOVED these and said they were the best thing I've made in a while (WOW!)!!! While my hubs liked these a tad more than I did, I really enjoyed the pizza-like flavor (think margherita pizza...) and how moist, juicy and full of flavor our pork chops were! Having said this, I have one suggestion to make this even better. It is imperative that you sear your chops FIRST. This adds a nice grilled char and much needed color to an otherwise boring, grayish (bleh) pork chop. :) NOTE: My hubs has a thermometer he uses when grilling and it registered 145 degrees Fahrenheit in HALF the amount of time suggested. My advice is to watch your chops carefully so that they don't overcook! Rotini pasta with pesto and focaccia bread rounded out our simple summer meal. Thanks for sharing your recipe, CNM! I'll be making these often this summer! :-)

It's "Amazing" that a recipe so simple is so fabulous!  My entire family loves these chops.  The fresh tomato slice on top with the herbs and cheese makes these chops so scrumptous.  I live in a house with people who don't appreciate a fresh tomato.  I have to sneak them in on them.  Well there's never a complaint when they are sliced and placed on top of these chops. Also, a plus is the easy clean up with using the foil.   Forever greatful CNM catering for such an easy and delicious meal!

These are AWESOME!!!
I've made pork chops following this recipe, and also with variations to the recipe. Changing the cheese, changing the spices, adding finely diced peppers, etc...it is all just SO GOOD!!! :)
Thanks for a recipe that is in regular rotation at our house!

Delicious!  I made a few changes - used 4 pork chops and dried oregano instead of fresh.  I also topped the chops with some cooked onion.  I  browned them in a pan before putting in the oven as a previous reviewer mentioned.  I will definitely be making these again!

These were good, quick and easy for a weeknight meal. I can't find decent tomatoes around here...wish I'd had a more flavorful one, but the oregano and basil from my herb garden were great. I cooked them in the oven because I was too lazy to go out to the grill, but we'll have these again.

The entire dish came out a watery, soggy mess.  And the basil and oregano really weren't a good complement to the pork.

We used fresh herbs and tomatoes from our garden. Cooked in oven with thin chops due to the  100+ degrees outside. Great in a sandwich the next day. Can't wait to try on the grill.

Recipe Group selection of 6/4/11.  I've never be a fan of boneless pork chops because I found them lacking in flavor.  I had a few in the freezer that I needed to use, but not looking forward to them.  This recipe solves that problem easily.  Thanks for a simple, flavorful way to use them.

We loved these! We used fresh basil and dried oregano. We also used partly skimmed mozzarella, and shredded it, instead of mozzarella slices. We also did ours in the oven.

Sadly, we really disliked these. I spent a good amount of money on 4 beautiful pork chops and wanted a fantastic preparation. This recipe had rave reviews and sounded delicious. This was nothing like I imagined. The chops were moist but the delicate flavor of the pork was completely overpowered. I could have used chicken breasts and the flavor would have been  the same and I would have saved 3$ a pound. The tomato slices needed s&p and the skins became unpleasant tough stringy loops. The freshness of the herbs was lost after 25 minutes of steaming. The method for adding the cheese seemed to be an afterthought. The cheese tasted as if it was not a part of the dish. It was barely warm and badly melted. I may try this idea again with marinated chicken breast, garlic and onion cooked in the olive oil, seasoned, peeled tomatos, a little anchovy paste, cheese and dried herbs added right away and fresh herbs added at the end. I think I would cook this uncovered as well to get some of that great grill flavor. Sorry, but we were very disappointed.

I seasoned my pork medallions with steak seasoning; I didn't have a fresh tomato, so I used a can of "garlic & olive oil" diced tomatoes and covered the pork before baking in 350 oven. Afterwards, I covered with shredded mozzarella and garnished with fresh basil. We loved this and will make it again. I will adjust cooking time, as my pork was slightly dry. Easy and quick - can be made for company and will be sure to impress. I served with my own version of oven grilled vegetables. Thanks for the great recipe!

I rated this recipe 4 stars because I was disappointed with the flavor.  I think the title is deceiving and I expected something more.  The only change I did was to cook in the oven for 35 mins. then add cheese and cook until cheese melted.  If I were to make this dish again, I may try adding some pizza sauce on the chops in place of the oil.

I think the receipe is great.....however, the use of  quality Pork, fresh garden tomatoes, and Buffalo Mozzarella make this a real winner.  I have learned from 50 years of cooking that the using the best quality of  ingredients make the BIGGEST difference in the taste of any receipe.
This is a great website and I love trying new recipes and reading the reviews!

Lovely.  Did it in the oven though and had to use dried instead of fresh oregano. Am tempted to try it with sundried tomatoes/paste next time.

These pork chops tasted GREAT! Nothing like pizza, but they were delicious. My kids didn't like them because of the fresh tomatoes, so next time I may try pizza sauce or tomato sauce, but for myself I would definitely make it just like the recipe instructs. I used fresh mozzarella too!

Because so far I am the only person who did not rave about this recipe, I feel I must certainly have done something wrong when making this.  I followed the instructions as written, but my pork turned out drier than expected and the overall taste was somewhat bland.  I may try this again to see if I get different results, perhaps using a sweeter kind of tomato and/or using a different cheese.

It was pretty delicious. I always pre-season my meats after purchase and freeze, so much better  flavor. The fresh herbs totally make this do NOT use dried. Made with a grill pan indoors came out moist. I did add some parm also and turned on the broiler to melt a little better.

This makes for a good chop that's unique and flavorful.  I seared my chops on the grill prior to cooking in the pan, uncovered.  I used dried herbs out of necessity.  I made one chop without tomato for my granddaughter, leading me to realize that the tomato is an important part of the recipe!  The chop without tomato was not nearly as moist or flavorful.  Thanks for sharing this recipe with us, CNM CATERING!

Wow doesn't even begin to cover this one.  I was rained out on the grill, but baked them in the oven at 375, loosly covered in foil, until done, then added the cheese and put them back in the over for just a couple of minutes.

The flavor on these was, as the name says, amazing.  I probably added a little more basil, oregano and garlic than was called for, I just eyeballed it when I added it, but I also had more pork chops than were called for.  The tomates and fresh basil really made the taste jump out!

Used chicken instead of Pork - this was the first time EVER that my kids came back for more chicken! So, yes, this really is amazing and will be a regular! I did spread a little pizza sauce over the chicken, before topping with the recipe ingredients, just to keep the chicken moist and I cooked it in the oven, rather than the grill....used thin breasts and it was cooked as quick as a stone baked pizza.

Made this for my family of many generations.  It was a huge hit.  I followed the directions exactly but used my in house grill for the suggested amount of time.  Oh my... mmm mmm good! Was a little concerned about how the cheese would melt, but it was perfect.  This will definitely go into my dinner meal rotation.  Thank you so much for sharing!!!!

Don't put tomatoes and herbs on until chops are mostly cooked- makes the grilling a lot easier.

Sounds good but why use a grill when cooking in a pan? I’d cook on the grill, add the tomato towards the end and the mozzarella just before taking them off.

Though not having made this exact recipe, I have made one very similar. Where I did a quick sear on the chops, after seasoning. Then topped with pepperoni, mushrooms, black olives and their other ingredients. And yes, they do taste like pizza :{)))

I made a few changes by adding some Herb & Garlic spices and season salt instead of regular salt, it was good but not fantastic and definitely did not taste like pizza. I was going to add some tomato paste on top of each one but decided to follow the recipe instead, if I make it again I will add it. Also did this in a pan on the stove top and it came out very juicy.

Quite good and really easy! I over-cooked them the first time but they were perfect the second time around! I also added a lot more spices the second time as I found the recipe a little bland but overall, still a great recipe!

I followed it and agree that it was incredibly easy for how fantastic they turn out. I served on top of tandoori bread, which I brushed with olive oil and through on the grill. My wife was raving.

Made this tonight. Everyone said it suprisingly tasted like pizza. Even I was a bit  suprised. I used plum tomatoes & put 2 slices on each chop, that way you got a bite of it every time. Can't wait until I make it  again.

This was a very flavorful recipe and the chops were super juicy and tender, but I think I prefer the breaded "comfort food" style of pork chops better. My father-in-law said the meat flavor was covered up too much and my mother-in-law said it would taste better with chicken. I do agree that with chicken this recipe would probably be incredible, and I intend to try it that way in the future, but I probably won't do pork chops this way again. 
It's snowy outside, so I threw the disposable aluminum pan in the oven. I guess you could probably just do a regular pan, but I wanted to make sure I did the recipe as close to original as possible. For those of you at high altitude (I'm at 6000ft), it took 45 minutes at 375 in the oven.

This seems pretty kiddy at first glance, but it's a surprisingly fresh and delicious meal. Use a nice, thick, boneless pork chop, thick slices of tomato, and don't skimp on the garlic or basil. Mmmm..

Really good. I used canned tomatoes and dried spices and cooked in the oven and it came out great. Probably even better with fresh ingredients.  Will def make again!

Great recipe. Super flavorful! I made this in wintertime and used canned diced tomatoes, but still the fresh chopped garlic, oregano (AND thyme). After baking in a slow oven for 40 minutes, I drained the extra liquid from the dish into a saucepan and added hot water to cook up some pasta tossed with the same romano, parmesan, and mozzarella cheese that I topped the tomatoes with. A perfect Italian dinner, full of fresh flavors and mix of tastes. Wish I could give it more stars! Definite keeper in my cookbook!

Meh. Chops were dry; cheese was oddly tasteless and therefore not worth all the calories.

I grilled it quickly before i put in in the tray to make grill marks. I would make it again but i would use less basil. I would also try it with sundried tomatoes instead of fresh.

I made this with pork chops and also chicken breast because my daughter only eats poultry. Honestly I thought the chicken was better. I had a lot of the fresh spices but still felt that the finished product should have had more as it wasn't as flavorful as some other reviewers claimed. Everyine gave it a thumbs up and it has been requested to be made again.

Ok, I  made a minor change.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of pork chops but they turned out Excellent!!  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  OMG what wonderful tasting chicken!  The only other change would be is to grate the garlic - I used minced garlic and the "chunks" of garlic were a bit overpowering.  After I pulled the pan off the grill I thickened the drippings and used it as a sauce on the side.  I will keep this recipe and next time try it with pork.  Once again, don't hate because I reviewed this but used a different meat, consider it an other option to add to your grilling.

Don't let the name fool you!! These are great! When I saw the recipe the name did not appeal to me, but when I read ingredients  I thought would give it a try.  Have to assume that daughter enjoys white cheese pizza with fresh herbs ( hence the name ) , which is not my first thought when I think pizza.  Very flavourful and the fresh herbs and tomatoes make this a quick and easily prepared summer dinner! Will be making again for sure. Do try!

I  Did make this with a few personal changes, poured a little tomato sauce seasoned with oregano, basil, and pepper on the pork chops then complete the receipt  and cooked it in the oven.  Everyone said it was amazingly delicious and better than pizza

It was pretty good. Nice change for the plain grilled chops I was going to make. Good way to use some of our home grown tomatoes. Used 2 tomato slices on each chop, and added a little parmesan. Will probably make again.

These were ok...I would not make again if just going by the recipe. I found them to be bland.
