Man, this drink is "Da Bomb".  So sweet, so delicious.  Like Lovestohost, I also make this as a drink instead of a shot.  One 8.4 oz. can of sugarfree red bull to 1 oz. shot of Jagermeister over lots of ice.  Great on a hot summer night!

One of my favorite drinks.  I use Sugar Free Red Bull and drink as a drink, not a very large "shooter".

Always a LETHAL combination - but these are much better when made with only 1/3 of a can of Red Bull...  Not only do they go down easier that way, but it doesn't mask the Jager as much.  But then again, some people might prefer it this way ;);)

These are best ice cold. I use my shot glass mold and let the Jager sit for a couple seconds before pounding.

My absolute favorite drink out there. First had one back in 2003 and have stayed faithful to them ever since, lol. I'll ask for this every time over anything else!

This is my overall favorite drink. However, I have found if you use CULT energy drink instead of Red Bull you don't get the tart taste, and you save a little money!

My husband & friends think this is the "bomb"!!!!  They take a juice glass filled half way with Red Bull & then drop a shot glass filled with Jager in the Red Bull.  Then they drink this down in one shot!!!!
