Delicious!  I made this for my husband and his parents for his birthday picnic.  It worked perfectly, tasted great and wasn't that difficult to make.  I did not cook the prosciutto, because we love the flavor it already has.  Might as well use (much cheaper) bacon if you're going to fry it up.  It was great with the prosciutto as is. In the future, I'd up the grapes, and decrease the peas a little as there were a bunch left over at the end.  Thanks for a keeper!

This was very good...  we cut back on the peas, put in mostly for color.  Next time i will substitute broccoli..  Good flavors but need more dressing, maybe a 1/3 more..will make again with those changes....  good base recipe!

I thought the salad was very bland and the herbs added at the end gave it a bitter taste.  It made a lot of salad and I ended tossing most of it out after a party where it didn't go over well.

Wonderful unique flavor. I left out the prosciutto and it still was great.

While I did not mind this, it was not a hit with everyone else.  Maybe they just aren't pasta salad people.  Loved the grapes.

I liked the light, lemony flavor of this pasta salad very much.  I used a combination of dried cranberries and cherries.  I also used cubed ham instead of the proscuitto.

Exactly what I was looking for - very good!I used this garlic seasoning blend because raw garlic seems to become stronger and stronger.  I would only mark it down a bit because I can't figure out how to get it creamier. It seems to absorb more and more as it sits and is slightly sticky. (if anyone has a tip, I'd love to know!) The lemon seems strong, at first, but really tones down later.Thanks!

Super easy to make & delicious! I didn't have Prosciutto so I added shredded chicken instead. Still so good!

First, the amount of pasta is way too much for the amount of dressing.  Using 1 lb. (16 oz.) pasta would be better.  For all the exotic ingredients, this was a very bland salad.  Next time, I will use regular bacon, more of all the other ingredients, and omit the very expensive fresh thyme and oregano, since they end up adding very little to the taste. I took it to a party for the first try-out, where it was not a hit.

This was good. A lot going on but it worked well. I omitted the onions because I thought they would overpower everything else. Good dish.
