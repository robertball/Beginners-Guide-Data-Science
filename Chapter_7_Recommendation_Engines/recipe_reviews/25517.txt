Hello! I am the author of this recipe and I want you to know that Allrecipes tweeked my original recipe. I suggest using fresh crab or crab from the seafood counter (8-10 oz). No imitation ever (YUCK) and canned only in a pinch. My recipe also did not call for 1 1/2 cups of parmesan I suggest 1 skimmpy cup,  also add the herbs and spices you like to make it your own. Also this will never feed 40 people, this recipe was meant for 7-10 people. No this is not low fat, but what good thing ever is? Enjoy, and have a Happy New Year.

I took the advice of others and tweaked this recipe to my liking and received many many compliments on this dish at my monthly Supper Club. First of all I added 3 (6 ounce) cans of crab meat, 1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, NO MAYO, 1 ½ cups of grated Asiago & Parmesan cheese mix, 1 cup sour cream, 2 teaspoons of crushed garlic, and ¼ cup of diced green onion. Directions for prep and cook are the same although I served in a bread bowl which was a very festive touch. Happy Cooking :>)

Ok, I have decided that the people who gave this recipe a bad review was because they did not bother to read the ratings before making this dish.  Pay attention all...do NOT add the entire 1 1/2 cups of regular parmesan cheese, you must use the Italian Blend shredded cheese with the Asiago in it.  Then add pepper to this recipe as well.  I use more garlic and the imitation crab meat, plus 2 cans of crab meat, and I do add lump crab meat. If I am going to eat something this fattening, then it better be darn good!  So, read the reviews from others and take warning regarding their add-ins.  They are speaking with experience.

I believe the only reason I get invited to parties anymore is because I always bring this dish as an appetizer. I do tweak it a little but though. I use 4oz of imitation and 8-10oz. of real crab, 1cup parm and asiago shredded blend, 1cup lowfat sour cream, 1/3 cup lowfat mayo, 1/2cup green onions, 1/2tbl. of old bay, 1 package of lowfat cream cheese, and 6 cloves of garlic. I served it with toasted baguette. I swear by this recipe and it has made me crab dip queen of the neighborhood.

After a couple tweaks, this was a five star recipe! I used 16 oz. of claw crab meat, 1/2 cup mayo, 1 cup grated parmesan cheese, and I added 1 1/2 t. Old Bay Seasoning. I fridged it overnight and baked it at 350 for exactly one hour after sprinking Old Bay on the top. It was great! I will make it again and again.

I had to try this recipe when I read Noel’s own review. I felt sorry that Allrecipes had edited the submission to the extent that there was such confusion. Allrecipes, I love you guys, but occasionally you do get carried away. As for the serving issue I guess this is in the eye of the beholder. This may make enough to generously dip about 40 tortilla chips and one chip might be considered one serving. I agree with Noel though. I want to know how many people will politely get a few dipped chips to fill the hollow spot with their beers during Superbowl halftime. As for the recipe I only had one can of real crab. I was also confused by the widely varying reviews about the out of whack ingredient ratios. Not needing to make a lot, I used half the mayo and half the sour cream and about ½ cup of grated Parmesan. I halved the garlic ‘cause hubby likes it mild. I sprinkled it with a little paprika for color before baking. We ate this on Ritz crackers (oh, sorry, Allrecipes will probably edit me to be politically correct—I meant buttery round crackers). It was a yummy cheese spread but it didn’t exude much crabbiness. A couple of more cans of crabmeat wouldn’t have hurt. Thanks Noel. I’ll make this again but I had to jot down my own notes so I could duplicate it.

Great recipe, Noel! My friend and I went to a new restaurant, they served this as an appetizer. After tasting it, I knew the first thing I had to do was get on this site to find the recipe. This is an exact taste-alike from that expensive restaurant, and its quick and easy! You made two people very happy! Thanks for sharing!

This was just okay to me, and that's after doctoring it like crazy. I doubled the crab and halved the dairy ingredients (not the parmesan cheese, but I wish I had). I also added 1/2 of a chopped onion, salt, fresh black pepper, parsley, 1 cup grated monterey jack cheese, and about 1 tbsp. Old Bay seasoning. Some white wine would have added a lot of flavor, and I'll add some next time. I'm only giving it three stars because I basically had to change the whole recipe.

I have made this several times over the last couple of years and it's always great. I no longer use mayo in the recipe and it still tastes great. I also use 2 cans of crab & add hot sauce to taste.  Yum!

Really good dip and very easy!  Here are the things I did a bit differently . . . 1.  Used about 6-8 oz of imitation crab meat (I know, I know, fresh is better but for a large party, it will definitely do). 2. Combined 8 oz 1/3 less fat cream cheese, 1/2 c Lite Miracle Whip, 3/4-1 c grated Parmesan/Romano cheese, and 1 cup lite sour cream.  3. Added 3 sliced green onions (green parts only) - a little more than 1/4 cup.  4. Added in 1 tsp worchestershire sauce, 1 tsp of old bay seasoning, and at least 1/4 tsp of pepper (eye-balled it).  I'm a little convinced it is probably just fine without the worchestershire sauce/old bay so I wouldn't run out to buy them if you're short on funding.  5.  Finely diced two LARGE cloves of garlic instead of crushing them.  My cloves probably equaled four smaller ones.  6.  Baked in a 8X8 square pyrex dish and served with slices of Italian bread!

Great Dip!  I served it to two of my most finicky girlfriends today and they loved it.  As most other reviewers I modified the recipe a bit.  I used: 2 cans of crab meat; low fat sour cream; low fat spreadable cream cheese; 1 cup grated parmesan; 4 cloves garlic.  I also added several dashes of worcestershire sauce and a dash of Louisiana style hot sauce. I omitted the mayo based on the suggestion of other reviewers.   I mixed the ingredients the night before and baked for one hour before serving. I served it with small rounds of garlic toast, which I made myself.  I was surprisingly pleased with the can crab but will try fresh next time to see if there is a significant difference.  I may also add shrimp.    This is a keeper that I will serve often.

I made this, and by following the directions I gave it a 4 star.  The flavour was great but it was runny.  

The next time, I doubled the crab and cut the mayo to 1/2 cup, which helped thicken it up and then it was a 5 star.

Excellent appetizer.  This one is a keeper.

Try adding a few drops of hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce, some pepper and some chopped green onions to make it a bit zippier.

I made this dip for a big party we had. I used 10 oz of crab that was in the refrigerator section of my grocery store. And about 1 cup of Parmesan/Romano cheese.  Those were the only changes I made to the recipe.  My guests ate every morsel of this dip and a few requested the recipe. I will be making this one over and over again!

This is a great dip, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the lack of a key ingredient Ole Bay, and 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of it according to your taste and then it is perfect! other than that great recipe! thank you!

Really a very tasty recipe - if I could have given it 4.5, I would have.  I followed the suggestions of others and I cut the mayo and sour cream down by half.  I only added 1 cup of parmesean cheese and sprinkled some on top before baking along with some paprika (it made a really pretty golden crust!)  Other additions:  I added one tsp of lemon juice (it is always good with seafood), about a tsp of salt, and just a dash of cayenne for kick.  IT WAS SO GOOD!  One thing I might do in the future would be to use some fresh lump crab meat instead of the canned.

This is a fantastic recipe. I did use an Italian shredded cheese blend (mozzerella, provolone, asiago & parmesan) and added 2 tablespoons Old Bay spice. My family found it "too crabby with 6 oz fresh AND 6 oz canned but I didn't mind it that way. Making it for Christmas eve and trying only 6 oz this time. BEST DIP I'VE EVER EATEN (and I do love to eat).

The mixture overall is fine.  However, the mayo's got to go.  Or at least be significantly reduced.  I think next time I'll use only a 4th  of a cup.  1 cup is entirely too much.  (And I'm a mayo lover.)  Also, my husband and I couldn't even taste the crab.  Next time I'm going to use 2 cans of crab.

Amazing dip! I did change a few things though - i used 16 oz of crabmeat and decreased both the mayo and sour cream to half a cup. I also used 1 1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan (def use freshly grated here!), added a few dashes of old bay and my guests could not get enough of it! I too served this in a bread bowl, excellent! Some reviewers stated they could not really taste the crab - I made mine the day before and left it overnight to blend the flavors - very crabby!

This is my first time making this and I think it’s good for those who are big Parmesan fans. I reduced it to a cup but still felt the taste was a little overpowering. If I make this one again, I’ll omit the mayo and use double the cream cheese, triple the crab meat, and reduce the parm to 1/2 c.  I also added a LOT of old bay seasoning and a little Italian seasoning, 1/4 c. of shredded mozzarella and 1/4 c. of shredded cheddar.

This was delicious an a big hit at our party.  I took advice of others and used a parm/asiago/romano blend of cheese.  Will definitely make this again!

Very good "base" recipe for crab dip. Definately follow other reviews, & don't use canned crab. I added about 1 tbl. of old bay seasoning, & a few dashes of hot sauce. Fresh shredded cheese is a must! I think this recipe would be a bit dull w/ out these additions. Placing the dip in a small crock-pot on warm setting is a good idea too. Very good w/ the blue tortilla chips.

I love crab and hoped this dip would be more "crabby" than it is but I give 4 stars because it is a great dip made just as the recipe is written...to make mine more "crabby" I added an extra can of crab meat (real thing no imitation) and also changed the sour cream and mayo both to the light versions...and in a pinch had to use garlic powder rather than fresh cloves but still turned out yummy!

Really good dip!  I did use 2 cans crab, 1 tsp. Old Bay and mixed some Parmesan w/Panko for a topping. Took to a party & was the first dish finished.  Thanks!

Wow, this was SO bland.  Needs double the crab.   This rating is for the 'as written' version.  Instead of throwing it out, I mixed in 1.5 tbsp Old Bay.  Made it better, but something was still off.  Will keep the search on for a better tasting crab dip.

I have been making this dip for a few years now.  I always use low fat mayo, cream cheese, and sour cream, so my rating is based on that.  I also serve it with blue chips.  This has been a huge hit at every get together & I'm asked to bring it always which is fine because it's also easy to make.  I can't rave enough about how delish this dish is!

This was good, but I think it would have been better with less mayo, cream cheese, and sour cream.  I used crab legs and claws, 1 scant cup parm/asiago blend and was left wondering what it would taste like without adding any mayo.  Might try that next time, but this wasn't cheap.

Delicious, however I did change some things, I didn't use mayonnaise, but I did add grated sharp cheddar cheese and a drop or two of hot sauce.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  I will make it again, however, I will probably not put in the mayo and put in a little bit less sour cream based on the fact that it comes out a little runny for my liking, only because its not very nice for presentation.  Also, I added a can of artichoke hearts, a small bag of baby shrimp, a few dashes of old bay seasoning and a few drops of lemon juice.  I added these other ingredients based on what other people's reviews read.  I think the crab/shrimp/artichoke combo is perfect.  Oh, and I also used 2 cans of "REAL" crab meat.  I dont see how one can would have been enough.  I wonder how the dip would taste with just claw meat in it?

Very tasty--I got rave reviews at a holiday function.  I added some Old Bay seasoning and lemon juice to give it a little kick.  Plus I used fresh crabmeat (no other option when you live on the Gulf Coast!).

This recipe was very good with a few minor adjustments. I only used a 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese and more crab the second time I made this and make sure not to use cheap mayo. I did that once and it separated and ruined the dish.

Made it for a team party and was a little nervous being a new recipe and all, but it definitely did wow everyone. I did tweak the recipe as others reviews suggested. I love the taste of seafood, I added 3 cans of crabmeat and 1 can of small shrimp, cut the mayo in half, added 1 cup each of fresh grated parmesan cheese and asiago cheese. I believe I added more garlic too, but then again I love garlic too. I love this recipe, nice change from the popular artichoke or spinach dip!

TKA (totally kicks a**)!  Awesome recipe.  However i guess i am one of those wierdos that actually likes imitatioin crab, that is what I used in this recipe...its awesome.  I used the 16 oz packages of imitation crab, cut it up with a pizza slicer.  I added everything else as requested...except a scant more sour cream, (just wanted to empty my container).  This tastes like a local restaurant favorite of mine.  EXCELLENT!!!

Good, but this could be really great with some changes.  I used low-fat cream cheese and sour cream, and a slight bit of mayo to cut down the fat and richness.  I strongly recommend buying fresh crab, or imitation crab is great also. Canned crab will not give you that nice crab flavor or texture.  Fresh parmesan cheese is also a must.  I usually buy a wedge and grate it myself.
It only takes a few minutes and the final result will be worth it.

Delicious!  This was a GREAT recipe.  The only thing I altered in this recipe is that I used some fresh imitation crab (as one of my guests is allergic to shell fish).  It was a HUGE hit at my dinner party.  I used Just 2 Good mayo and light cream cheese and sour cream and it was still very rich in flavor.  You couldn't tell that I had skimped on some fat grams!  I used my veggie chopper to chop the crab and saved some major time.

Outstanding!!  Thank you for an outstanding recipe!!! I tweaked as recommended by Noelle and used fresh crab meat.  I also used Parmigiano Reggiano, which made a big difference.  I also added a dusting of the parm cheese to the top of the dip and found it formed a lovely golden brown crust that folks seemed to wrestle for:)  I added two teaspoons of red pepper flakes and a teaspoon of fresh ground black pepper for some spice.  I chose to substitute fresh toasted French Bread slices for the tortilla chips (slice French baguette, toast in 350 degree oven for the last 8-10 minutes that the dip is cooking).  This one is a crowd pleaser!!

I made this for a mid day potluck at work, so I used a small (sauce type) slow cooker instead of baking in the oven.  I didn't get that nice crunchy layer on the top, but everyone asked me to send them the link to the recipe because they loved it.  I only used 1 cup parmesan per previous reviewers and author, and also used canned crab, sorry, i'm sure the real stuff is better but it was delicious nonetheless.

I've made this crab dip twice now. It's so creamy and so yummy. Everyone at our party loved it tonight. I did add just a little bit of Jalepeno sauce to it to give it a little bite. Mmmmm! Thanks for the recipe Noelle!!

EXCELLENT! I will make this again and again! A few suggestions: do not use canned crab meat - get the good stuff from the seafood section. Also, make sure you use shredded parm cheese - not that stuff in a can. It will make a big difference.

Okay I used 2 cans of crabmeat, 6oz of cream cheese, 1/4 cup of mayonnaise and 1/2 cup of sour cream.  The cheese was reduced to 1 cup Parmesan and agiago mix. Sprinkled a little panko flake on top.  Pretty good, next time I will use lump crabmeat.  Only three stars because of the needed modifications.

This was a hit for my guests!  I used 8 ounces of crab meat and a pound of crawfish tails and it was awesome!  I also used shredded Italian blend cheese instead of just Parmesan.  I mixed it up and warmed it up in the microwave, then transferred it to a small crock pot for the party.  Delish!

Love this recipe. I make it as is with two exceptions: I use some garlic powder instead of garlic cloves, and I use less cheese than called for. Other than that, everything is the same. It's absolutely delicious. We make it every year for an appetizer on  Christmas day.

FATHER'S DAY DINNER HIT! My husband loves the crab dip at a seafood restaurant we eat at.  So for Father's day I wanted to find  something similiar.  He loved it, my parents loved it, my brother loved it.  I didn't change a thing.

Finally got to make this.  I had it saved in my box for a long time.  My husband and I decided that this would be good with some spinach sauted with garlic before adding to the crab mixture.

I loved this recipe!  I found that the crab dip was very bland with canned crab so i ran out and bought two large king crab legs.  I shredded them and added them to the dip.  It did the trick! Turned out great!

I used Canned crab - as fresh where I live is a huge expense. Made everything as the recipe states (except i completely forgot the garlic! oops - no dramas though - my brother who looooves garlic more than any other ingredient whinged when i said i forgot it - but it didnt stop him sitting there eating half of it!!!). I served it in a bread bowl with the inside bits of bread to dip in and a few sticks of celery and carrot. Even the bread bowl was gone by the end of the night! EVERYONE at the party raved! Thanks!

I followed the instructions provided by the recipe submitter to use 8-10 oz crab meat and a scant cup of freshly grated parmesan.  I also used low fat cream cheese, mayo, and sour cream which I almost always use without incident.  And I added a couple teaspoons of Old Bay.  I found this dip to be too rich of the cream cheese, mayo, and sour cream and not flavorful enough of the crab or anything else.  I did use canned claw meat and I agree that fresh lump would have made it better, but not significantly.  If I made this again I'd add at least 4 more oz of crab and more Old Bay and other spices.  But there are too many other crab dip recipes out there that I'd make before I went out of my way to figure out what's wrong with this one.  Sorry :-(

This was a big hit. I did take the advice of other reviews and half the mayo, added an extra can of crab, old bay seasoning, and salt/pepper to taste. Think next time I will add another cheese, like asiago or Gorgonzola. I guess you can use you imagination with this as a base recipe. I would suggest cutting up a baguette and toasting the pieces to serve the dip on. Chips were nice too but not as tasty as the toasted bread.

Wow! 
Changes: Doubled Crab, Added a can of chopped artichokes, used fat free sour cream - cream cheese and mayo.  This helped curb the calories because we (me and my husband) DID eat the entire thing (by ourselves)!

This was perfect just the way the recipe was originally!  It was so yummy!  I made it Christmas Day for my family and they loved it.  I used light mayonaise because that's all I had on hand and it turned out great.  I served it with tortilla chips but also made some baked pita chips by cutting Pita bread into triangles and separating them and placing on a baking sheet and baking at 350 degrees for about 5 minutes.  The pita chips were really good with this dip too!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I reduced mayo to 1/3 cup and used green onions as suggested by reviewers. I added a cup of chopped shrimp and a dash of worsterchire to the recipe and let it sit in the fridge for most of the day and that really brought out the seafood flavor. Cooked it and served with crackers, chips and veggies.
Everyone loved this dip on Christmas day and I loved the compliments!

I used 2 cans of lump crab meat and only a tablespoon or two of the mayo, kept the rest the same, and it turned out SO yummy! Perfect appetizer for a chilly evening with friends. They ate it all and barely had any appetite left for dinner! Also, there was no clean up because I stirred the ingredients together right in the baking dish. This is a quick, easy recipe I'll make again and again.

Very good ~ made it for Christmas day appetizer.  Did make several changes based on other reviews ... decreased mayo to 1/2 c, used mixed cheese (parm & asiago), decreased garlic to 2 cloves, added red pepper flakes for a bit of a zing, and used a bit more crab (10oz premium can). Leftovers tasted even better the next day (both cold & warmed).  Kept it simple & served with tortilla chips ~ nice mix of salty & creamy.  Definitely will make again.

Actually I made a lot of changes to this original recipe so it is a bit different from this.  I used 16 oz of imitation crabmeat, only 1/2 cup of mayonaise as many of the reviews recommended that. Everything else was according to recipe.  It seemed a bit bland after mixing everything so I added a little bit of worchestershire, lemon juice from a fresh lemon and red pepper. This definetly gave it more flavor.  Took this to a party and everyone LOVED it! It still tasted good when it was cold.   I would definetly make this again.  I served it with water crackers and tortilla chips.

I love this...definitely for the seafood lover and is very rich.  Used fresh crab claw meat..not the backfin and make sure you keep the leftovers if you have any.  I think it's even better the next day warmed up.  Is also good on toasted bread squares.  Awesome appetizer..this one is going in the recipe box and I'm really picky about what goes in there!

I tried this recipe and threw it a slight curveball using aged Gouda and jalapeños.  Crowd favorite and couldn't get them from hovering around this dish.  Thank you for the base ingredients allowing me to use my own influence.

I brought this dip to a party and it was gone very quickly!! I love how I can mix all the ingredients in the baking dish I used.  I added a little extra crab, parmesan cheese and garlic. I am making it again this weekend.

My Family LOVED this...  My next door neighbor gave us a whole bunch of Dungeness crab on Dec 23,  We ate about 3 of them right then.  What to do with the rest??  found the recipe and cracked the rest of the crab.  I ended up with a 10 inch pie pan heaped with crab.  I followed the recipe but not to a tee because I had a lot of crab.  It was awesome.  Highly recommended!  I think fresh crab is the key, though.  I am going to make a Razor clam recipe out of this next.  Thanks Noelle!!

Remember to double the crab meat and use less cheese.  I added salt, pepper, cajun, cayenne and lots more garlic.  Very good.  Keep in mind to make again for parties.

Great dip, very easy to throw together at a moments notice.   I used one 8oz cream cheese, about 2/3 cup mayo and sour cream, I used dry minced garlic, 3/4 cup grated parm and 3/4 cup packaged shredded parm., 2 cans of crabmeat, then took a bunch of green onions and threw it in for color and sprinkled papika for color on top of dish.  Found it only took about 25-30 minutes for it to get hot and bubbly, served with assorted crackers.  Everone loved it.  If anyone has tips on how to prevent the yucky grease from the cheese from spoiling the look of a great appetizer once everyone starts digging into it and it pools on the bottom of the serving dish I would love to hear them!  Plan on making again next month for a birthday party.

This wasn't a bad dish, but it seemed like it was missing something. I prepared the dish with the recipe provided (I didn't use anybody's requested additions), and it was tasty but bland. Next time, I might try toasting bread crumbs on the top layer.

So delicious!! I recommend putting 2 cans of crab, though, because just 1 and there's not enough crab taste...it just tastes like a cheese dip, but still DELICIOUS!!!

Very good dip... the only thing you'll want to do is soak up some of the oil on top after it bakes..

This dip is warm and wonderful on bagel chips or sturdy tortilla chips.  It was very popular with our tasters.  Lots of requests for this recipe.

Very surprised how bland this turned out.   Definitley needs more crab, as you could not taste it over the 3 cups of sour cream, cream cheese, and mayo.  Not sure if I will make again.

Great recipe to start with but I wish I had read the reviews before making. I definitely would've swapped out the Parm for an Italian blend. Next time! Also, it was a little looser than I would've liked so I'll probably cut back on the mayo and sour cream. I did think to add pepper before baking it. I think everything tastes better with a little bit of pepper. My brother loved it though and he does not eat crab dip.

wonderful! I had leftover Red Lobster (lobster tail and some shrimp) so what I did was cut up all the seafood meat and use it instead of crab. Added 1 cup of monterey jack/mozzarella mix also for some "real" cheese in there. Added a 6.5oz jar of chopped artichoke hearts, drained. Eliminated the mayo. I basically mixed 3 different crab dip recipes together to make a DELICIOUS dip! Highly recommended, especially for feeding a crowd!

This dish was absolutely delicious! Not for those who dislike seafood. I increased the crab amount and added seasoning to achieve the perfect flavor. Several people tasted it before I baked it and liked it better cold. Very rich, you can only handle a few bits.

I ended up throwing this dip away because the crab overpowered the dip.  It was much to fishy tasting for me and my guests.  I am rating it as 5 because if I had used immitation crab or crab legs from the Seafood Dept of the store, this would have been awesome.  I blame the awful taste on my choice of lump crabmeat that I bought.  I did use 1/2 cup mayo, fresh ground pepper, a few drops of hot sauce, a sprinkle of Old Bay and a splash of Worcestershire Sauce. I will be making this again for the holiday season.

This is a great recipe.   I have used this base recipe for hot dips for years & the only thing that I add is 1 tsp hot pepper (Louisiana) sauce (this really makes this dip & it doesn't make it hot - only adds a distinct flavor) and some fresh cracked black pepper.  This dip can also be made with chopped artichoke hearts (wonderful) or with bite size  shrimp.  Yum!

Fantastic!  I did tweak the recipe a bit after reading the other reviews.  I doubled the crab and used a little less than one cup each of parmesan (as the recipe's author suggested) and mayo (I ran out).  I used canned crab and it was perfect.  I took it to Christmas and everyone loved it - even the kids.  My boyfriend (who normally does not care for crab) asked why I never make this for dinner!  Thanks for this recipe.

This is a good base, but like others I had to doctor it up a bit.  I cut the sour cream and mayo in half.  I used shredded parmesan and the Italian blend.  I also seasoned with Old Bay seasoning and Boarshead Jalapeno sauce.  Added real crab and shrimp.  I served with blue corn chips.  It was still a bit too runny so next time I may add even less sour cream and mayo.  Also will serve with pitas.
My husband devoured it.  Thanks for the recipe.

Because of the reviews I reduced the amount of mayo to half (we aren't big mayo fans anyway).  I also added artichoke hearts per the advice of another reviewer.  This was delicious.  Did not turn out greasy like some of the other reviewers had said.  Thanks for the post.

This was fabulous. I read the reviews and made a few changes. Used 2 six ounce cans of lump crab, used 1/2 cup of Hellman's mayo and added green onion, 1/4 tsp cayenne, splash of worcestershire and about a teaspoon of Old Bay. Oustanding and will be added to our yearly holiday menu!

Per other reviews, I used 1/2 the mayo but also added artichoke hearts.  What a waste of a lot of good ingredients!  The dip was bland and much too goopy.  Some Essence did give it some kick after it was cooked, but to be really good, the kick needed to be added before cooking.  Because I already have a couple very good dip recipes, I didn't feel the need to keep this one on file.

It was pretty good.  My party guests enjoyed it with chicken flavored crackers and tortilla chips.  It was a quite oily on top just coming out of the oven, but I blame the amount of mayonnaise for that.  The dominant flavors in this dip were by far the garlic and parmesan - could hardly tell the crab meat was present.
I'll probably try this recipe again in the future, so I'll make sure to use 4 smaller-sized cloves of garlic (or just cut back) because the garlic compliments it, but not in overpowering amounts.
I'll definitely cut back on the mayo and double or possibly triple the amount of crab meat.

I used approx.12 oz. immitation crab, 1/2 the mayo and used shredded parmesan cheese rather than the dry kind in the container. I mixed about 1/2 tsp. of old bay seasoning in the mixture and sprinkled some on top for a nice color.

This was very good and very easy! I did change it just a little like some suggested and only used half the amount of mayo. My family suggested next time I add more crabmeat and cut down on the cream cheese.Overall this was very very good. Thanks for sharing.

My crab-loving friends and family had mixed reviews. I used fresh crab and I personally liked it ("4-star worthy") however, others thought it only to be okay...they said it was too rich. Because I couldn't eat it all myself, I either find another group of friends to serve this to or I just don't make it again. Thanks just the same Noel.

I took this to a football party yesterday and it was a hit!  I used imitation crab meat and added a bit of garlic powder for a little extra kick.  It was easy to keep warm in a small crock pot.  Very good!

This recipe was awesome!  I doubled it for a family gathering and had enough left over to enjoy the next couple of days.  Takes a little work, but well worth it.  Would also be very good on pita triangles.

The reviews imply that modifications are necessary, which is why I give the recipe a 4. I used Nicole Scott Lambert's review as my main guide and it was great. Tasted like delicious crab dip at a restaurant.

I made this for work and I'm going to serve it today. I'm really nervous about it. I didn't read the author's comment. I hope it turns out. I did use the full 1 1/2 cups of parmesan and I used a drained 6oz can of lump crab meat. 

I will give it a 4 star rating for now because tasting it was really great. But I might end up changing it if it isn't a hit. Wish me luck.

Update: So it was a hit!! I can't believe I forgot to post an update a year ago ;)

I would try this again but use jumbo lump crab.  The crab I used was too small and got lost amongst all the ingredients.  I would also cut back on cheese and mayo

i loved It and my family loved it. Very successful.  They dove in and ate most of it.  I used the most expensive white chunk canned crab meat.  Next time I'm trying the cheaper pink crab.

I enjoyed this recipe and received no complaints for others who tried it. I did use canned crab meat not fresh. I also used reduced fat cream cheese, sour cream and mayo. This is a keeper for me.

Very tasty dip. I brought this to a dinner party and it was a hit. Pretty rich though. Light cream cheese, sour cream and mayo would probably work just as well. The fresh grated parmigiano knocks this out of the park.

This was good, however, I did make some suggested modifications. I used 10 oz. of lump crab meat..and did not use the mayo. Also added three dashes of worchestershire sauce and about a tablespoon of snipped chives. I also used 1/2 parm. and 1/2 aziago cheese grated. Our company thought it to be terrific!

Outstanding!  Followed a few suggestions and used 18oz crabmeat and no mayo. It really doesn't need the mayo.  Used blend of Asiago and Parmesan cheese. Fantastic and easy to make.

very tasty, but I had to tweak it quite a it by adding a significant amount of spices - garlic, red pepper, no-salt McCormicks, but it was quite tasty when done!  Word of warning to others: I doubled the recipe and it didn't cook well in the center - make sure you put it in a wide, flat dish for more even cooking, espcially when doubling.

Please use fresh crab meat. In a pinch even fake crab better than canned. Will make again as the recipe has potential but will tweak to my liking.

I made this as an appetizer for the Super Bowl. It didn't have a whole lot of flavor. I used about 16 oz of crab meat which proved to be too much, but that was my error. I only had about 1/3 cup mayo, so that was all I used. I tasted the dip before I put it in the oven and it was bland so I added some black pepper and red pepper. It still needed something more though.

We made this dip for New Years Eve.  It was a hit.  Very easy to do and it had a great taste.  I think I will add more crab next time.  Also, I have a crab stuffed chicken breast recipe that calls for chopped water chestnuts - - so I put a 1/2 can chopped into this recipe.  That was a nice added texture and received a lot of positive comments.

not as good as crab dips I've had before, not a party killer and it went, but I didn't love it. Maybe a different cheese would have been less sharp.

Everyone loved this! I used two cans of lump crab meant, 1 cup of sour cream, 1 1/2 cups of Italin mix cheese, Garlic powder because that's all I had, 8 ounces of low fat cream cheese, and I sprinkled Season All on top. I served it in a rye marbled bread bowl. I make it for Christmas Dinner. The presentation was very nice.

I love this recipe and it's always been a hit at parties. I actually increased the crab to 2 cans instead of just 1. Just comes out a bit meatier. I serve with flavored wheat thins. 
And its great that it only dirties a spoon and the dish you're cooking it in!

Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this over Thanksgiving, and it was a huge hit.  I also tweaked the recipe due to lack of time (didn't really measure everything out), and unlike the author suggests, I did use imitation crab.  I thought it still tasted great, and so did my family.  I used probably close to 1 1/2 cups imitation crab, maybe even 2, that I cut into smaller chunks.  I had to use the powdered parmesan, and used what we had left which ended up being close to 2 cups also.  The rest was the same, except for maybe using a little more than 1 cup of mayo.  My mom suggested a little less parmesan, because her practiced taste buds thought it was a little too salty, but everyone else had no complaints.  We heated it up in the microwave for 3 days afterwards and everyone loved it.  Would've been best with garlic Ritz, but was wonderful with regular Ritz and Triscuits too!  Hope you all love it.  I even took a picture and posted it as well.

This was awesome.  I loved it and so did everyone else. I served it with Panetini Italian Toast and it was so good. I have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time.  My husband and I ate at restaurant that has a Warm Crab Dip that we love and this is so close to it.  I will definitely be making this again and again!  Thanks!

After reading all the reviews I took suggestions from other reviewwes. I added more crab, mixed the parmesaean and asiago cheese and threw in artichokes. Everytime I make it everyone raves about it.

Its the I dont need a main course recipe. Served it many times and everybody loved it. Real crabe or fake doesn't make that much of a difference. Don't be affraid to add your favorite spices.

This is so yummy!  Like other reviewers, I halved the mayo and sour cream.  I didn't have any crab, so I used shredded chicken instead and it worked out great!  I added some Serrano pepper for some kick , a little paprika for some color, and some italian seasoning.  I halved the whole recipes, which was plenty for four people.  Can't wait to make it again!

I absolutely love this recipe!  I've made this recipe on many occasions and everytime I find myself passing out the recipe.  It's always a hit!  This dip is incredible simple to prepare.  I usually serve this dip in a store-bought fresh pumpernickel loaf hollowed out in the center..perfect for the dip!  Also, for variety I serve the dip with tostito scoops!

This is really delicious and rich. As others did I added old bay and a dash of worcestershire.(a must) The mayo seemed too much so I cut it in half. I think you can play around with the indgredients to your taste.Great recipe!!

Like many of you I reduced the mayo- to 1/3 cup, and I added an extra 1/2 can of crabmeat. One review I read said this recipe needed a kick. Here's what I added:
1/2 a package of guacamole mix (the powdered kind). My sister and her husband loved it and I did too.

This dip is alright...it just needs "something" to kick it up a bit. I added more crab and sprinkled in a bit of Old Bay Seasoning to help with the blandness a bit. I'll keep working with this one, because it's a good base recipe, just not what I was hoping for.

I cut the recipe in half, I used fresh crab & I added extra, I added quite a bit of Old Bay & a little onion powder & I added a couple of extra cloves of garlic. We loved this...thanks! UPDATE---I had a little of the dip leftover so the next night, I spread the cold leftovers in raw endive leaves...very enjoyable that way too!

I'm only going to give this one 4 stars because I changed it up a bit. I took other reviewers suggestions and added 2 cans lump crab, only 1/2 cup of mayo, and shredded Italian blend with asiago cheese. It was delicious with the blue corn chips. Even my picky toddler at some!

DELICIOUS!!!  I did tweak it just a little bit.  Based on other reviews, I decreased the mayo to 1/2 cup, I also only used 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I added 1 cup of Italian blend (with asiago cheese) shredded cheese.  I
used two 6 oz cans of crabmeat and could have used at least 2 add'l cans, so to avoid it being soupy I did not use all of the mix prior to adding the crabmeat.  I also added some shrimp.  This was devoured FAST!

SO GOOD!! I took this to a BUNCO party and then was bombarded by requests for the recipe. I had to email it out to everyone.  I used the new crab meat in the new fresh pouch (found near the tuna). It is a little pricier than immitation but added the REAL crab flavor you miss when you use immitation.  Make sure to use shredded parmesan rather than grated. Again, pricier, but adds so much to this wonderful appetizer.

This dip is great...but make sure you read all the reviews and follow advice.  Note to anyone with celiac disease/a gluten intolerance: Every imitation crab meat i've come across has gluten in it!  Be careful - use only the real stuff.

I changed the recipe the way most people suggested: 16 oz immitation crabmeat, 1/2 c reduced fat mayo & 8oz sour cream.  I also added 1 small chopped onion & some dashes of Tobasco.  Next time I will add more Tobasco & a dash of salt.
Everyone at the party said it was great & had several helpings so it was good as is, but I'd still like to tweak it more.

AWESOME! I put the garlic cloves and a few green onions on the food processor with the cream cheese. Everything chopped up and the cream cheese became light and fluffy. I also sprinkled in a little old bay for extra flavor and used 2 cans of crab. My house smells amazing, and my guests are content.

Beware this is an extremely greasy dip-I would not make it again and would be embarrassed to bring it to any gathering.  It tastes nothing like crab (and I doubled the amount of crab) and I would not recommend it to anyone.

Yummy, this was great. I made it for my class and it was all gone in a matter of minutes. I also followed other's suggestions for using two cans of crabmeat, and only 1/2 cup of mayonnaise. Also, the only sour cream I had in my fridge was the fat free kind, but it worked wonderfully. This is a great dip for a party or family event, just beware that you may want to make an extra bowl, because this dip disappears in a matter of moments!

We really liked this dip and so did the rest of the family.  We took the advice of others only adding a 1/2 cup mayo instead of 1 cup.  We also put in 12 ounces of imitation crabmeat (instead of 6 ounces canned crab).  The dip turned out great, and we actually had to fight a few people off so we could save it for the following day.  After tasting it the next day, the garlic was stronger tasting but still tasted very good.

I listened to other reviewers and used half the mayo and two cans of crab.  This is a great starter recipe.  Everyone at the party seemed to like it, although I think it was lacking something.  I will definitely make this again, but I will add something to it.  Considering one or more of the following:  horseradish, green onions and red peppers, lemon zest (have used in previous crab dip recipes), crushed red pepper or tobasco, or even just another type of cheese (in addition to the parmesan).  Also, I used all "light" products instead of full fat - and had no problems.

Excellent!  This gets so many compliments every time I make it.  I do use much more crab (a 16 oz can of lump crabmeat instead of 6 oz), but keep all other ingredients the same.  I believe Hellman's mayo is a must. If there is any leftover, try it cold, it's fantastic.

This was just okay.  This was just way too rich for us.  I do not think I would make again.  The mayo was overwhelming and you could not really taste the crab.

An excellent recipe.  It is sinfully rich, even substituting light mayo and neufechtel cheese (which worked just fine!).  And it was equally as good leftover, cold on crackers.  You could easily substitute for the crab to make a dip of your choice.  A definite keeper - thanks, Noel!

This was a very rich recipe and tasted great when first out of the oven.  I added about a cup of shredded mozzarela to the top because I ended up cutting the parm cheese in half.  Next time I am going to add some southwestern seasonings or something, it needed something like that.  There are a few restaurants in my area that serve an appetizer crab dip similar to this with the blue tortilla chips but they are a little spicy and I like that about them.  Will use this as the base recipe though...very good.

I made this dip to bring to a dinner party.  On the way there we had to stop short, and the dip flipped over in the car!  So unfortunately it did not look too attractive by time we got there.  It still tasted good though.  I did think all the mayo and cheese was a little overpowering, (and I love cheese).  Next time I would use fresh crab meat instead of canned and would cut back on the mayo.

This dip is awesome! It is so easy to make and it tastes great. I've served it a few times, and everyone likes it. The recipe suggests eating it with tortilla chips, but I don't know about that. I always have it with crackers. I tried it with lowfat versions of the ingredients and it was just as good.

OMG!  This is one of the best recipes I've ever tasted!  It was really easy to throw together and tasted divine.  I used fresh dungeness crab and really good quality parmesan cheese.  We served it over bread and fortunately I had enough leftover to eat for lunch the next day.

I have made this recipe twice and it is always a hit! I use real lump crab from my local grocery rather than imitation krab. I have received nothing but compliments about the great balance of the garlic and parmesan. I am a little dash of Old Bay seasoning to give it a little bit of a kick. This recipe is one I always come back to.

Huge hit!!!! I’m a Marylander, so I added Old Bay & worcheshire sauce, and a little black pepper and it really set off the flavor. I also used the grated parmesan with Asiago. I topped it with an extra sprinkle of cheese and some bread crumbs. The bowl looked like it had been licked clean!!

I subbed no fat Greek yogurt for the sour cream, used reduced fat cream cheese and fat free mayo. It was delicious and went over very well at a wine tasting event at my church.

This was okay but I think it required more than 45 minutes cook time. I used the canned crab meat, and felt maybe 2 cans would have made it more “crabby” and less cream cheesy.

This was a hit at my party. I took the suggestions of others and did half Asiago and half Parmesan cheese. I omitted the Mayo. This was easy and a big hit. Thanks for the recipe!!

As written, the recipe seems off on proportions.  The author did say she uses 8-10 oz. of crab, which makes more sense, but I still used almost a whole 16 oz. can of crab and reduced the mayo and sour cream by half.  A little salt, pepper and Sriracha sauce helped spice up what would have been a pretty bland dip.  I should have done the Parm/Asiago blend as other reviewers suggested but I already had regular Parmesan.

This was fantastic - the recipe was wonderful but we ran out of Parmesan, so we added other shredded cheese from the fridge and then added some Cajun hot sauce too (we had made crab cheesecake the same day) - gave a nice zing to the dip.

It is a great recipe. I added a dash of Worcestershire and a dab of Tabasco and a little lemon juice and lastly a little old bay seasoning and it was great. Oh yeah I used Asiago cheese, Romano cheese and Parmesan cheese. I also baked some sliced French bread with basil and olive oil and it was delicious. I used to go to restaurants to experience this but now I can have it home anytime. And yes use Lump Crab meat never imitation

I used a little more crab, added cajun seasoning, and left the mayo out the second time around. It turned out great. The original recipe  didn't have enough flavor.

My company enjoyed this appetizer.  I served it with crusty bread.  This appetizer  could have been better if it wasn't so garlicky.  Next time I will only add two cloves of garlic.

Great recipe, thanks Noelle. I used some king crab legs I had in the freezer I needed to use up. I did cut the mayo down to a 3rd cup, and the grated cheese to 1 cup using half Asiago and half parmesan cheese as other reviews suggested. I will definitely be making this recipe again!!

I made this recently for a party and it was a big hit!  I'm not much of a garlic fan, so I did decrease the amount just a bit.  perfect appetizer with good crackers, or party rye bread.

I made this recipe Memorial Day weekend. It was a huge hit with everyone. I added shredded pepper jack cheese along with the Parmesan cheese and Tapatio hot sauce. Delicious!  You can never add too much cheese.

I  only made 1/2 the recipe as it seemed too much for 12 people and it still was allot.  Didn't add any salt but I found it too salty, did not add all the parmesan either, could hardly taste the crab and the crab was real

This recipe was really good! I used chopped garlic instead of crushed cloves and I used 1 tsp because I added about a tsp of old bay seasoning and I didn't want to over do it on the garlic. I also added about 1/2 cup of onion, 1 tbs of horseradish, 1 tsp of hot sauce and 1 tsp of worsterchire sauce. (We like a little extra kick). I served w organic corn chips. Everyone loved it!

made this last night.  we entertain a lot, and the rule in my home is everyone must b honest about my dishes. b/c i don't want to make mediocre food. EVER!!!! So...... we all agreed that next time i will double the crab, and make sure it is lump crab meat. i followed this recipe to a T, and it really tasted like really rich parmesan dip. I'm certain that when i make these changes next time this dish will be  5 stars!!!!

Made this for game day & everyone loved it.  Read a LOT of reviews and decided to make the following revisions:  added a tsp of worcestershire, a sprinkle of Old Bay, salt & pepper and cut back on the parmesan to 1 cup but added a half cup of mozzarella.  Used fresh crab claw meat from the fish counter at my grocery store.  Also sprinkled a little more mozzarella on top before baking.  Served with both Stacy's parmesan, garlic & herb pita chips as well as garlic toast.

Very good when I made. Made few adjustments using this recipe as base. I used tub of herb and garlic cream cheese, and taking the tips from others to use something other than parmesean,I used tex mex shredded cheese,  bout 3/4 of the bag. I also added a little diced green onion. Used two cans of crab meat. Was absolutely delicious and made lots of dip. Everyone loved it.

This was the big hit at bridal shower.  I had an entire tableful of foods, and this was the one they fought over.  I used a six ounce can of lump crab meat and I split the Parmesan...half grated in a can and half shaved because I had some of the nice shaved parm that I wanted to use up.  I will definitely make this again...and often!

Delicious!  This recipe makes enough dip to fill a casserole dish.  Too much for what we needed.  So, I only cooked 1/2 the mixture and put the rest in the refrigerator.  The next day I make a small crock of dip with the leftover uncooked mix from the frig.  Perfect!  Then, the following day I made another small crock.  It was a real treat to have fresh, warm crab dip whenever we wanted.  I love this recipe.

This recipe needs some adjustment but otherwise is a real winner. I made this last month following some of the suggestions and now every family party I'm asked to make it. If you want to make the full recipe I suggest at least double the crab and using real crab not from a can. I also halved the mayo and sour cream. I kept the cheese amount the same but used a mix of asiago, romano and parmesan. Because of the changes I gave it a four but when you do make adjustments it is really a great appetizer.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  I used several of the suggestions in the reviews such as two cans of crabmeat, Multiple-Italian cheese, Old Bay, no mayo and dashes of Worcester and hot sauce.  I want to make this for a Christmas party and would like to bring it in a small crockpot. I'm thinking I'll bake it then put it in the crockpot set on warm.  Just wondering if others have done this to keep it warm at a party.

I served this for a big group of women today and they all LOVED it!  I used canned crab meat because that was what I had and it was excellent.  I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 though because parts of it were still runny after the 45 minutes - maybe it should have had longer.  I'll try that next time, but it was in a time pinch today!  Will DEFINATELY make it again!!!

Good, a bit salty though.  Extra garlic 1/2 the mayo & sour cream, added some old bay & some franks red hot.. could use more crab as well.

This was a great addition to our "game day" menu. I, after reading several reviews, decided to stick to original recipe, other than using fresh crab meat. I served this alongside homemade pita chips (also from the site) and it was just what I was looking for! 5 stars!

Both times I've made this dip for parties everyone raves about it and wants the recipe.  I added fresh chopped rosemary (2-3 Tbs) and it complemented the dish perfectly.

I'd give this one 10 stars if I could - excellent, delicious, a huge hit with everyone in my picky-eaters anonymous group! I added a dash of Slap Yo Mama seasoning because I didn't have Old Bay. Soooo goood!!!

Easy and delicious!  It is very rich so you really do not need to have several other appetizers before your meal unless you are just offering finger foods.  Do NOT use imitation crab, that is just sacreligious, buy the real deal...it's worth it!

Great recipe! I made this yesterday for my dinner guests and they all loved it.  I did make a few changes like suggested.  I added less parmesan cheese (3/4 to 1 cup) and added a lot more crabmeat and some minced onion.  Before popping it in the oven, I sprinkled some more parmesan on top.

I made this as it was written except I used imitation crab (only change I made) I served the dip with warm bagettes.  What a great recipe.  I will be serving this at my next family get-together because it is a keeper!  Thank you for sharing.

I love my canned crab meat, but I used (GASP) imitation crab, I'm not a fan of imitation crab, but DANG was it good. I also added baby shrimp, and fresh ground pepper, and followed everything to a T. We are eating this NOW at work, and everyone is drooling over it! YUM

This is sinful and worth it!  I modified the published recipe by using fresh crab, a TON of garlic, and I added some Old Bay Seasoning.  The dish brought lots of compliments on Christmas Eve!

Fabulous! Followed Noel Turk's directions and created a generous amount of a versatile dip. Divided the finished product into two, adding shredded colby-jack to one. Served up Noel's perfect crabby dip alongside a cheesier version for those who prefer a milder crab flavor. Will definitely rely on this recipe when that crab dip craving comes 'round again!

This smelled and tasted delicious, but was a little on the greasy side.  I used imitation chunk crab meat because it was on sale.  Maybe it would have turned out a little better if I had used the canned crab meat.  This tasted good enough to warrant another try.  I will probably cut the recipe in half next time because this was way too much for four people.

I've always been a big fan of spinach artichoke dip, but this mouth watering dip has become my new favorite! It was very easy to make and tastes wonderful on bread or chips. Thank you Noel!

This was such a hit at my party. Even the kids loved it-- including the picky ones! I used 1/2 cup mayo as suggested by many of the reviewers. I also used real crab meat (claw meat is cheaper and just as good!). Ever since I made it, I've been getting requests to make this over and over again. This is definitely a keeper!

This dip was excellent.  The first time I made it, I served it at a party and everyone raved about it.  I cut the mayo to 1/2 cup as many of the tips suggested and will continue to do so.  I will definitely make this again!

This was an absolutely delicious recipe.  I added more crab meat and I used 1/2 Parmesan and 1/2 Asiago cheese.  I have made it twice in the last 2 weeks.

Excellent dip!  Very rich.  I used 2 6 oz. cans of crabmeat and I could have used (and will from now on) used 2 more--it didn't seem very crabby.  But it was very good!

I did not rate this the first time I made this recipe. Honestly, I would have given it 3 stars but my guests loved it! I made it a second time at their request I and added chopped-up canned jalepenos and it was AWESOME! The jalepenos gave it the kick it needed. I will make this again & again!

I made this recipe for a recital today. The bowl was licked clean! I used low-fat cream cheese and mayo, but full-fat sour cream. I also used freshly grated romano and about 1/2 lb of crabmeat (in a baggie, not a can). Yum, yum, yum. You can't miss with this! (But watch that waistline if you're going to have it a lot!)

I made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving Day.  I don't know why but it came out a little runny...like there was too much moisture from the crab (even though I drained it really well).

Wonderful!  I adjusted the servings to 60 and it made a perfect sized addition to our party!  I added only 1/2 cup of mayo, a full 16 oz of crab and 5 garlic cloves though.  Everyone loved it!

I started to take the advice of others about not adding so much mayo and sour cream but I used a pound of crabmeat so the extra mayo and sour cream worked perfectly. I took this to a dinner date and everyone loved it! I topped it with extra parmesean and that got a little hard when it turned cold.

This was very good.  I did change it a bit I only used 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo, and 1 cup romano cheese.  It was wonderful and creammy.

I was going to give this 3 stars, but since my boyfriend liked it better, I'll give it four. Plus, I wasn't exactly fair, since I did as other reviewers suggested and used 2 cans of crab meat and less mayo. For some reason it just tasted way too rich for me. (Maybe too much of a good thing? ie. cream cheese, mayonnaise, AND sour cream) Maybe I didn't like it because every bite came with the guilt of how unhealthy it is. Anyway, it's not exactly what I was looking for in a crab dip recipe.

This was a very good dip! I felt a little guilty about all the rich ingredients so I used 2 cans of crab meat and only 1/4 cup of mayo. I also cut the parmesan cheese to one cup. It was still delicious! Will make this again for sure.

I served this to someone who doesn't even care for seafood and they loved it!  I did follow the advice of some of the other reviews and cut back on the mayo by 1/2 a cup, but also added a little cayenne for some spice.  Great recipe for an appetizer!

I work in a small family bar and made this dip one night for my customers. I served it with crackers since I have no clue what a blue corn chip is and it was just amazing the way everyone's eyes lit up when they tried it. Every one loved it. I would reccomend this recipe to anyone who likes crab dip. It's really easy and really good.

This is always a big hit at a party or gathering. I made it again just last night for a dinner party. I cut the recipe in half... still perfect! YUM! Thanks for sharing!
