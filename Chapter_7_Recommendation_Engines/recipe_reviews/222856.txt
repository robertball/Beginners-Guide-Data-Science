This is a 10 star method for cooking corn - absolutely no silk - not a single thread!  The corn is cooked to perfection.  FANTASTIC!

Actually, 4 minutes per ear (for 2 just double the time) is perfect and there is no need to flip. I have used this method for years and it works nicely.

Wasn't completely sold on this idea of cleaning and shucking corn even though I had viewed the video.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnBF6bv4Oe4&feature=share. The method does work. After I cut the end off the wide end of the corn, I held on to the silk end and shook a couple of times, and the corn slid right out of the husk, leaving behind one silk on one of the ears of corn.  For two ears of corn, I cooked in the microwave for 8 minutes on High.  I added butter and sea salt. Delicious - perfect for two people!

Perfect every time!  I find it's easier to cut the bottom off BEFORE microwaving ... then just grab the top and let the cob slide out.

This is my favorite way for sweet summer corn on the cob, unless is is so fresh I eat it raw off the cob.

I serve mine w/fresh white bread, I like the Nature's Own Butter Top bread.  You can use what ever, soft rolls work nicely too, main thing is the bread is fresh and soft.  We spread the butter on a slice of the bread and once the corn is clean we wrap the bread around the hot corn and softly coat the corn w/the butter from the bread.  While we let the corn cool for a minute or so we eat the bread w/the melted butter on it.  It is some kinda good!  The fresh bread is slightly heated from the corn and it has the salt  on it...fabulous!  My favorite is to use Jane's Crazy Salt.

My Mom sent me a YouTube video of an older man making corn like this and I decided to try it and it works just like this recipe says.  The only down side is that you do have to cut off one of the ends, which I like to use as my handle but at least I don't have to peel them anymore!

Have been cookin the corn this way for many years. Full proof method. Recommend cooking each ear of corn for 4 mins so 3 ears would take  12 mins. No need to turn but I wouldn't cook more that 4 ears of corn at one time.

This will be my new go-to way to cook corn on the cob. Perfection. I love that there is no mess from the husks. I cooked 2 ears at once and cooked for 5 minutes. I opened one ear and thought that it needed another minute so I popped the other one back in and it was perfect. I think the length of time will depend on the number of ears you microwave at one time and the wattage of your microwave. Mine is a 950 watter.

It seems that most everyone is over-cooking the corn. One ear of corn will be done after 2 minutes on high in the microwave. Add 1 minute for each additional ear. I have used this method and cooking times for several years and the corn comes out perfect everytime. Also, there is no need to turn the corn. I have no reason to do corn any other way.

I love this!!! No more hauling out the giant pot to boil corn, no soaking the ears for the grill. Throw it in the microwave for a few minutes, chop it, squeeze it, butter and salt and dig in! Sweet, juicy, no silks...a perfect summer treat. Thanks for the instruction and recipe.

Another skeptic, converted!  I cooked 4 ears for 12 minutes and it worked just like the recipe and all the previous reviewers said it would.  So cool!!  Thanks for sharing this fabulous way to cook and clean corn on the cob!

Wow!!  All that work before doing corn without the husks is now a waste of time!!  
Tonight my husband and I decided to try it.  He was skeptical and I am always up for a game changer.  So, we took the two corn husks and put them in the microwave on 8 minutes, turning them once in the process.  Did the rest by the book and had a few silks on the corn, but that was no problem to easily lift them off of the corn.  Oh my goodness the corn was soooo tender and crisp.  Absolutely phenomenal.  So much better than the old method which makes the corn rather squishy.   Thank you for sharing this idea!!!

The method works excellent! I used the video Shearone showed me. It takes 8 minutes, according to the video, and that worked well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnBF6bv4Oe4&feature=share

I love, love, love fresh corn.  I boiled 5 ears for the family yesterday. They were wonderful. I had one ear left today and tried this microwave method.  The silks came out cleanly, but 4 minutes overcooked and dried out the kernels.  I don't know if it was the strength of the microwave, the size of the corn, or the missing seasoning; but I'm going back to shuck and boil.

This method is the gold standard! After removing the ear of corn, you can safely season and butter it and slide it back into the husk. Pop on the grill to keep warm until serving. The video I watched recommended  nuking just two ears at a time for 8 mins. total time.

Followed the cooking directions here and decided it needed one more minute in my microwave. Second time around I cooked it 2 1/2 minutes per side. It was perfect. No silk, easy clean up and no heat added to the kitchen. Since different microwaves are different powers, you may need to experiment slightly to find the perfect time for yours; but this is my new go-to way to cook corn on the cob.

I've been cooking corn this way for at least two years. I like my corn tender, so I never microwave it longer than two minutes per ear. It is so easy to clean!

This really works!  I first discovered it on YouTube a few years ago.  Check this out ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzYtMeIFH8o.  Don't give your ears of corn time to cool or it'll be harder for the ears to "drop" out of the silks and shucks.  I never cook fresh corn any other way now.

This is an awesome technique! Not only was it absolutely delicious--crispy tender and juicy--but it was so easy I was dumbstruck.  There was a side benefit for me:  I usually wind up with corn stuck all in my teeth.  Not so this time.  The whole kernels slipped right off the cob into my mouth each time I took a bite.  My corn cob looked as if a giant vacuum cleaner had sucked those kernels right off the cob.  Not a scrap of corn was left on that cob.  My husband won't eat corn on the cob because of what remains stuck in his teeth.  Bet he'll eat it now.  Thanks so much for sharing this method.

This works!  It really works...I have finally even convinced my Mom to try making corn this way....and she had to admit...It works.  Makes delicious corn..fast and easy were her words.  4 mins on high is all I needed per cob and I did not flip it.  Be careful the corn is hot....grab the butter and enjoy!

Where has this been all my life? 4 ears of corn cooked perfectly in 12 minutes in my 1100w microwave. I laid them side by side on the turntable, cooked for 6 minutes, then swapped inner and outer ears for the remaining 6 minutes. The next night we had 3 ears left, cooked them for 12 minutes also, and once again achieved perfection.  What a great way to free up space on the grill!

This changed my world! I never learned how to shuck a cob like this. On my very first try, I shucked a cob in less than 10 seconds, with nary a silk left behind. Now, I can't wait to use the fresh, seasonal corn for recipes, whereas, in the past I dreaded the prep. Thanks CCARR48!!

This is the only way I ever cook my corn on the cob now. I put an ear in one of my insulated cloth tortilla warmers, nuke it for the maximum 3 min. that the tortilla warmer can be in the microwave for, and then put another tortilla warmer in with another ear. The first ear stays nice and hot while the second one cooks and I can eat them consecutively, with both hot and without having to wait for the second one to cook.

Thank you CCARR48 for the tip on cutting the bottom of the cob off and squeezing the corn out, minus the silk. I've been using two potholders to grab and peel and then to remove the silk. This sounds much easier and better and I'm definitely going to try it. 

This method never fails to give me crisp and tasty corn that is not waterlogged at all. It's much easier and faster than boiling it, and less messy. I'll never go back to boiling it again. I even got my brother to start cooking it this way. You just get much better corn this way, providing that you have two crucial things to begin with: decent corn, and that you don't overcook it.

I have steamed my corn in the nuker for 35 years. I did not get the slicing the end off to work but using oven mitts to shuck it works great too. My 1st microwave back then was big enough to cook a turkey, so I could cook more than 4 at a time but most of these nukers now will do only 4 at time. When you have 5 acres of corn for your back yard you learn to do it the easy way. It is the best tasting corn.

Where has this recipe been all my adult life. I just had to try this method, to see if it really worked. I can say that it does and I will not cook corn any other way from this day forward. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I'm doing my happy-dance now.

I was a little bit leery about this. In the microwave? and all the husks and strands come right off? Nah, not possible.... Guess what? IT IS POSSIBLE!!!!! I was floored!!! Love it!!!! Tho i will say. It's good for two ears. If you're having a cook-out? Up to you. But this does work.

Works like a charm, just remember the corn will be very hot when you grab it to shuck.

OMG! THANK YOU!! What a time saver! I had my doubts (especially since I thought my microwave would take longer to cook the corn, but it did not)! I am a VERY happy girl, and the kids are happy too since we didn't have to skip the corn that I forgot to make until just about everything else was done. Whew... so glad I found you.

This was amazing!  No turning necessary!  I found that if you let the ear sit a few minutes before squeezing, it's 100% foolproof.  Thanks for the post!

This worked wonderfully!!! I had two small ears of corn and I did about a total of 5-6 minutes.  It was cooked perfectly and it was shucked so simply!

This is my favorite way to fix corn on the cob. I've done this for years in the microwave, but the shucking part is new. Works great! Not one silk left on the ear of corn!

This is by far the best way to cook corn on the cob, I've been using this method for about 3 years now and will never cook it any other way, so easy and clean, never any silk to pick out of the corn.

I am a believer!   It was so easy to make this and worked like a charm.  The corn was perfectly cooked crisp tender and slid out of the husk without any silks.  I cooked four ears for 6 minutes on one side - flipped and cooked an additional 6 minutes. So easy!

Great! I was more than a bit skeptical about the ease of this method but it is absolutely spot on. Great taste, cooked to perfection, and no silk. After I mentioned this to a friend, she told me that she has microwaved corn this way for many years.

My father and I had a lot of fun fixing the corn this way. I did turn the corn after two minutes, but I agree that may not be necessary. My husband pointed out that the corn was over cooked. I cooked one ear for only 3 minutes and 30 seconds and it came out much better. I suggest that cooking time should be adjusted to the specific microwave. You can't beat the prep time (none) and clean up.

It's the only way to cook corn on the cob.   Having to shuck and desilk is so tiresome - can't imagine why anyone would want to do that when this method is so much more efficient.  I love to sprinkle fresh lime juice on the corn after it's cooked instead of butter.

I'll admit, I was skeptical but my corn came out perfectly and not one strand of silk on it!  Delicious!

Saw this at 9:00 AM and had to try. Unbelievable  how easy  and clean the husk and silks came  off!! The 11 year old  who shucked 7 ears of corn last night was thrilled! What a time saver.

This has been the only way I cook corn on the cob for years.  I don't turn the corn over (just cook for 4 minutes) and often cook 2 ears for 8 minutes.  It always turns out great.  I love this way to cook corn;  way easy and delicious.

The easiest way to cook corn! And you don't have to shuck it first. The silks come right off! I microwaved 2 corn on the cobs at the same time for 5 minutes and its was enough time.

Easy to make, and no pot to clean.   Had to work to get the husk off, but it took all the little corn silk  strands off.  Prefer this method to boiling.

Used this recipe tonight.  A fun find - corn was perfectly done. Topped it with some chili powder, salt and butter and so enjoyed it.  I love fresh corn but really don't like husking it.  This will be my go to recipe from now on!

I found that four minutes was too much too Elle.  I backed down to three to three and a half, and it isdone perfectly.  Instead of going back to shucking, I'll continue to just not cook as long...duh.  The method works.  There are no, or very, very few silk.

I tried the suggestion of cutting off the stem end before cooking, which was really helpful- doing it after the corn is cooked is tough b/c it's so hot! I tried one ear for 4 min w/o turning, then cooked the other 3 for 9!minutes (1000 watt microwave) & let them sit for about 1 minute before squeezing them out of the husks. Perfection!

Fast and nutritious!  If your corn is very fresh it slides cleanly out of the husk. If it's older, you have to squeeze and tug a bit. It's the only way I'll cook fresh corn from now on.

I read the reviews, otherwise I probably wouldn't have tried this because it sounds to easy to be true. But it is true. The corn came right out and was cooked perfectly. It made me wonder why I haven't been doing this the whole time.

Since my corn was already half-shucked, I wrapped the ears in paper towels to prevent drying out.  Otherwise, I just followed the recipe as written, and was very pleased at the results:  Easy to peel clean, and corn tasty and done just right.  It was so nice to not have to drag out the big pot and wait for the water to boil and then have a battle with the corn silk.  Great idea - thanks for sharing.

The easiest and quickest corn recipe ever - but above all the tastiest ! We'll never boil our corn again. As others I cut off the bottom of the ear BEFORE putting in the microwave for an easier way.

Don't cook for 4 minutes! One min., then flip over. One more minute cooked.  This method work great!  Perfectly cooked corn and no mess. Being from Indiana, I am pretty anal about corn and have learned plenty.  Back in the day, we always tried to find white Silver Queen & boiled it for 8 minutes in sugared water. Because of the way hybrid corn has changed, you only need to cook it for a few minutes now &, alas, what was perfection in Silver Queen has been bred away.  And if you ever see Olathe corn for sale, GRAB IT!  It's raised in Colorado and is THE best.

Good method. When I use it I remove the outer layer of husk (just any dirty parts, not the whole husk) and wrap the corn in a damp, very lightly damped, paper towel. 2 to 2 minutes and 15 seconds per side, depending on the size of the corn.

True-not a single thread of silk! Our corn came out a little chewy instead of crunchy(I know some people prefer it that way-we like crunch) but I was making 4 ears at a time & added the extra 2 min, as suggested by the submitter. Next time, I'll try just 1 ear and see how it comes out.

I've been using this method for years.  I never turn it, and only cook for 2 minutes per ear.  Corn will still have a little crunch, which is how my family likes it.

Easy, convenient and absolutely delicious.  Why would you go through all the trouble of boiling water, shucking the corn and having water soaked corn when you can simply do this!

Been doing this for years,  I like how the corn comes out and leaves all the silk behind.  I also use this method when I grill corn.  No need to remove the silk before grilling.

This isn't the best tasting corn, but the quickness and simplicity more than make up for that! It still comes out tender and tasty with butter and seasonings added. This is my favorite corn on the cob recipe!!

Oh so simple and perfect for the single cook only wanting to have one ear of corn! I followed the directions - cook for two minutes, flip and cook two more minutes. Once it was done and out of the husk, I put a dab of butter on a piece of bread and rubbed it on the cob. No mess, no fuss, good eatin' (including a nice buttery slice of bread)! It came out almost perfect. My new favorite way of quickly cooking corn on the cob.

Excellent.  Cook 2 min turn then 1 min. then squeeze it out of the husk and silks.  No butter added only grinder fresh lemon pepper.

My future in-laws showed this method of cooking and shucking corn to me and the hubs-to-be, and it blew our minds.  Came out perfectly steamed even without turning during microwaving and no silks whatsoever.  We were in awe... easiest method of cooking corn-on-the-cob ever invented.

My husband and I were also skeptical regarding the success of this method.  I am glad to see how wrong we were!  This produced perfectly cooked corn, with no pot to clean afterwards.  We will definitely be using this method from now on.

WOW-WOW-WOW!  I love this! I don't know my microwave's wattage, but 6 minutes for 2 ears of corn was perfect.  Couldn't believe how easily the ears slipped out of the husks!  Thank you so much for this recipe!

This worked GREAT!  My hubby doesn't like corn and I love it, but I usually buy frozen because it's a pain to boil just 1 ear.  From now on I will be making it this way because it's so darned easy, and I'll use the frozen when corn is not in season.
