This is a low carb version of Mexican rice. It is very easy to throw together and very tasty, especially if you use homemade salsa. Thank you for the recipe.

I think next time Iâ€™ll try to improvise my own salsa, as mine tasted distinctly like Tostitos. I like the grated cauliflower idea, since we get a ton from our CSA and I can only make so much stir fry and curry dishes...

I used a food processor to rice the cauliflower. Added no salt or pepper. The salsa and green onions were perfect! Thanks for the great EASY recipe.

Easy to make. I did use a food processor which made it very easy! The salsa and green onions gave the cauliflower a nice distinct but not overwhelming flavor. The texture of the cauliflower was very good.

I'm not doing carbs or most dairy at the moment, so this was a welcome find. I have made it once with curry and once with garlic seasoning, next time might try cumin or coriander, as we love spices! served with the Lemon Butter Chicken recipe from this site, so good. cook it longer and it's more like a mashed squash consistency, or less for chewy/crunchy. def in the rotation , thanks!
