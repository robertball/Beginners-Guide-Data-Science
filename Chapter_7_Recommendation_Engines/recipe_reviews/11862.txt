The first time I made this was for my in-laws on Christmas a few years ago- it was a big hit! I have tweaked it a bit:  I add parmesan and mozzarella in with the cottage cheese mixture.  I also add minced garlic and some dried spinach dip seasoning (from Tastefully Simple) and it really adds some zing.  I'm not a huge fan of poultry seasoning, so I cut that down just a bit, and since no one in my family likes mushrooms, I use some other variety of cream soup- typically cream of celery- and it turns out great.  I also use italian seasoned bread crumbs and I add parmesan cheese to those as well- I figure one can never have too much cheese!  When you remove from the oven, let it rest a few minutes so the inside sets up a bit more- you'll avoid losing the inside when you cut it.

I found the taste rather mediocre. The cheese mixture was tasty (although I felt it needed more olives).

This recipe is absolutely delicious.  I especially love the flavor of the stuffed green olives.  Top rating!
It takes a few steps to put together but worth it. Recipe gets added to my "favorite Recipes."

Loved this recipe.  Goes to the top of my list.  I didn't have cottage cheese so used ricotta.  It takes a
little time but could do some of the preparation the night before.  This is definitely being served to
company.

Tasted okay, my parents loved it.  If I make this again, I will add a 3rd layer of noodles as used in Italian-style lasagna (and this recipe is just as much work!).  I would also add sliced mushrooms or more olives and cut back on half the breadcrumbs.

I loved this!  I added some garlic salt to the top of the breadcrumbs.  Make sure you chop the ingredients bite size.  Don't get lazy, it won't turn out as good.

This was suprisingly good.  Wasn't sure about the olives, but I had em, so I used em.  I used all the ingredients listed, didn't substitute or add anything different.  But I think I might try this next time with crab meat.  I am a seafood freak and I think the sauce will compliment the crab well.  Thanks for a different twist to lasagna!

I am not sure what went wrong with this recipe, because all alone, I really like all the ingredients this called for.  What a disappointment.  I am giving 2 stars (though would be 1 star for taste alone)for the creativness of the recipe, even though the flavor was just REALLY off to me.   Thanks for a different recipe, but this is something that will never get made again.

This was yummy!  I mixed the chicken in with the cheese blend to make it easier.  I also fried the bell pepper and onions first.  I chopped up the olives and added more of them as well.  I also used ricotta instead of the cottage cheese (not a cottage cheese lover).  This was a heart attack on wheels but what a way to go!  Very yummy.

I agree with some of the others on this one:  It was missing something. Bland, not very exciting at all. It rated a low "well I guess it's okay" rating with my family. I gave it only 2 stars for lack of creativity and overall flavor.

Did not hold up to cutting even after letting it sit, however that's not a major deal for us!  Something different- I almost thought the olives gave it kind of an 'enchilada' flavor- definately a keeper in our house!

We thought the sauce needed some extra seasoning - garlic, italian seasoning, and black pepper worked well. Also reduced the mayo to 1/4 cup (don't really think it needs it). We did agree that a layer of more substantial veggies might be really nice - thin layer of zucchini, mushroom & spinach, etc. It's super rich, but very tasty. A nice fresh green salad would help cut the richness.

very tasty but a little dry.  would recommend adding more liquids--maybe some Alfredo sauce?  that's what I put on the leftovers when I warmed them up and it was much better.

I made this, along with a manicotti, tonight for a house party and the manicotti was barely touched. I shredded the chicken rather than cubing it and I think next time I will add more olives and cut the breadcrumbs in half. Overall, turned out MUCH better than I expected and it will be a regular in our house now.
