After reading the other comments about dryness, I rolled the asparagus and cheese in the chicken.  Then spread a thin layer of fat free mayo over the chicken and rolled it in panko crumbs.  It stayed moist and looked beautiful.

Great!  I fixed the "dried out" problem by wrapping two strips of bacon around the outside of each rolled up chicken breast.  My three and four year-olds and my husband all loved it!

This is very good. As another mentioned is was very dry. So I used cream of chicken soup  pour over chicken roll. And to spice it up I used 1 tsp garlic, rubbed into each piece of chicken along with salt & pepper.

I used 6 very large skinlees boneless breasts of chicken.  Did not get them as thin as I would have liked but they worked out fine.  I adjusted the amount of the ingredients to accomodate my portions.  I used miracle whip, infused with fresh smashed garlic, dried basil, oregano, rosemary and a bit of sea salt.  Rubbed the mayo mixture on both sides of chicken placed the aspargus inside chicken, then shredded mozzarella, rolled and placed toothpicks through chicken and asparagus as mine were quite large.  Then rolled each piece in Panko bread crumbs and placed in (pam sprayed) glass baking dish.  Placed in oven for 45 minutes (covered after 25 minutes).  As they were baking in oven, I sauteed fresh portabella mushrooms in olive oil, a bit of butter and sherry.  Poured the mixture over the top of chicken breasts and baked for another 10 minutes uncovered.  I believe my chicken breasts took longer due to the size of the breasts and my aspargus as well.  DELISH!!!!  VERY VERY GOOD!!!  I very rarely follow a recipe to the T, just because that is how I am.  (I love to cook) and I give this recipe 5* just for giving me another great recipe and NEW idea!  THANKS!  Everyone from 8 years old to 54 years old LOVED this recipe.  Also, I served with long grain wild rice.

Great Dish, asparagus was perfectly done, to keep the chicken moist I covered it with tin foil for about 10-15 min as soon as I took it out of the oven. I will definately make this recipe again.

Here's a nifty little trick to combat the "dryness" problem most reviewers have experienced. I make a similar dish called Chicken Rollatini which uses hot ham copicolla and provolone cheese rolled up in the chicken breast. While baking, I marinate a can of drained mushrooms in cooking sherry and about 5 minutes before I take the chicken out, I pour this over the chicken. Delich!!!

I noticed a number of reviewers mention that this dish turned out a bit dry. I used fresh Mozzarella and added a drizzle of olive oil to the inside and out. Turned out moist and delicious.

Super simple to make and very tasty. My chicken was not dry, but my asparagus was still pretty crunchy. I think I'll steam it for a few minutes next time. Mine took a little longer to cook - about 7 extra minutes.

This is a good recipe as long as you do something to make up for the dryness of the chicken. I read the other reviews and decided to spread pesto on the inside and outside of the chicken. I pounded out the chicken and then brushed pesto on it before rolling and then brushed pesto on the outside before sprinkling on the breadcrumbs. I went a little too easy on the cheese on the inside and would probably add more next time since most of it tends to melt out the sides (which makes for great crispy cheesy goodness if you use a spatula).

I prepared mine a bit different.  I not only added salt and pepper, but some garlic powder as well for extra flavor (a must on my meat!), and a little drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, which I massaged into the meat.  Once rolled with the asparagus and cheese inside, I dipped it in beaten eggs and then rolled it in the breadcrumbs and placed them in a Pyrex dish that I sprayed with Pam.  Covered with foil and baked for 45 mins. in 300 degree oven.  Removed foil and continued baking it for another 15-20 mins.  Moist, tender and oh so flavorful.  It was absolutely fantastic!

Try adding a slice of proscuitto ham on the inside of the chicken, then add the asparagus and cheese.

This was fabulous.  I played off Terri Newby's suggestion and used mayo to combat the dryness that so often plagues chicken breasts.  Actually put a coat on both sides of the chicken.  It held the (panko) breadcrumbs on really well and seemed to also hold the stuffing in.  Had very little cheese seeping out.  Cooked them 30 minutes and they were perfectly done, juicy and delicious.  They were also very pretty.  Made a great presentation.  My family agrees.  This is definitely a keeper recipe for us.  Thanks, Madenish!!

This recipe was very good. I breaded the chicken, then layed a slice of ham down and layered with asparagus and mozzerella cheese before rolling up. Baked at 375 for 35 min (I usually have to add to most cooking times, my oven runs cool) then sprinkled top with a little more cheese and put back in the oven 5 more minutes until melted. My family loved it, would definitely make again.

After reading reviews on this recipe and learning for some it came out dry I made this dish but brined the breasts for one hour after pounding thin. They turned out very moist and delicious. I strongly suggest this to anyone trying this  recipe.

This is definitely a tasty dish, but a little on the dry side:)  However, a variated version would be to saute' a minced garlic clove.  Then, add tomato sauce, Italian seasonings, salt and pepper.  Pour the sauce over the top of the breaded chicken... cover it for 25 - 30 minutes.  Sprinkle some Mozerella over the top, then returned it to the oven for an additional 5 minutes.

Very yummy! I took the suggestion of another reviewer and covered the dish with foil for the last 10-12 minutes of cooking. Chicken was moist and very tasty. I did use garlic salt for extra flavor. Hubby & I both enjoyed this; we'll make it again!

This was alright.  I used Panko breadcrumbs instead of regular breadcrumbs and I highly recommend it.  Maybe I didn't pound out the meat enough but for whatever reason it didn't cook all the way for me and it's stuffed so you can't cut it and I had undercooked chicken when I went to eat :(  So cooker beware of the cooking time unless you pound out the chicken super thin!!  Personally, I could've used more cheese.  Maybe sprinkle some cheese on it right as it comes out of the oven or something.  It was good, but nothing that couldn't have been done separately (not stuffed) to get the same result in terms of taste.

This is a wonderful recipe, I did alter it a bit.  On the outside of the chicken, I put a light coating of mayonnaise then sprinkled it quite generously with Parmesan cheese.  Baked chicken on parchment paper.  It turned out juicy and very moist.

This was rather tasty. I left off the bread crumbs and used cheddar instead of mozzarella and it was still very good. Will probably make again.

Excellent! I used swiss instead of mozzarella, that is what I already had in the fridge. I also added some fresh minced garlic in the middle of each chicken breast. I used only 1 Tbsp of bread crumbs to cut some calories, and flavor was still delicious!!! Moist and flavorful! Even without the minor changes I made, this recipe is a 5 star, as written!

Tried for first time tonight and it was delish! Very easy and the only things I recommend is using string to tie together and buying plump chicken breasts and butterfly them leaving one side attached. That lessens the need to pound to death the breasts and the string keeps them from coming apart when you handle them and put in and our of the oven. Did with roasted potatoes, carrots, onions and garlic with an EVOO rub and just salt and pepper.  Put in oven about 45 minutes before adding breasts.  My wife just loved it. Fast and easy and would be good to entertain with....less time in kitchen and more time with guests.

I have a similar recipe to this and dryness is not an issue.  It's pretty much the same except that I make a sauce of 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 3 tablespoons dijon mustard, about a tablespoon lemon juice, 2 teaspoons dried tarragon and a teaspoon of black pepper.  The recipe I have says to spread the sauce over the outside of the rolled up chicken before rolling in bread crumbs (I use panko) but I spread the sauce on both sides of the chicken - so that it's inside and outside of the roll up.  It very yummy and could easily be snazzy enough to serve to company.

Loved it!  Butterflied two large chicken breasts... marinated for 30 mins in olive oil, garlic pepper, and salt... when ready, coated in mayo and (homemade) italian bread crumbs... arranged extra asparagus (drizzled in olive oil, salt, pepper) around chicken in dish... baked for 25 mins and let rest under aluminum foil for another 10 mins.  Next time, may top with zest and sprinkle of lemon.  Served w/ rice.

I haven't tried this recipe yet but I'm giving it a 5, anticipating that it will live up to it & rating the recipe is the only way to make a comment.  Many of the reviews indicate the chicken breasts become dry.  I'm suggesting that you "brine" the chicken breasts first.  The water/salt bath does help keep the meat moist.  Brining uses more salt than the recipe calls for (I don't measure it), so you might want to leave the salt out of the recipe.  I use this method when I cook chicken breasts.  I'll rate the recipe again, after I've tried it.

AWESOME! Instead of shredded cheese, I sliced a string cheese stick down the middle (lengthwise) and rolled one half up with the asparagus in each chicken breast. At the 20 minute mark of baking, I pulled the chicken out and poured a tablespoon of butter over it. After the final 5 minutes, I removed the pan from the oven and covered it with aluminum foil for about 5 minutes while I finished off the pasta I served as a side. With hollandaise sauce (I made "Blender Hollandaise" on this site) this is absolutely divine! Thank you!

Really easy to make!  They looked "fancy" without a lot of work.  Flavor was good.  I had never pounded out chicken before and was surprised at how easy it was.  I did cook a little longer than recommended (an extra 15 minutes) and they turned out great.  I also took one other reviewers suggestion and put a thin coating of mayo on the outside of the chicken.  It was great for keeping the bread crumbs on and helped keep in the moisture.

Very good.  I had to cook longer because the chicken was still pink at the stated cooking time, but other than that, it was very good!

I followed the recipe.  The only change was covering it with foil the first 10 minutes so the chicken wouldn't dry out too much.  I thought it was okay.  My husband seemed to like it much more than I did, thus I gave it 4 stars.

This was very tasty.  I used freshed mozzarella and did not use bread crumbs.  For seasoning, I used Mrs. Dash salt-free herb and garlic seasoning.  Took 10 minutes longer than the recipe calls for.  I covered with tin foil for the last 10 minutes of baking.  I did not have a problem with dried out chicken.

Very good. We just added a little chicken broth to the bottom of the pan and covered for about 20 min. then cooked uncovered another 15. We didn't have italian seasoned crumbs so we added garlic salt, italian seasoning and a little pepper to regular crumbs and it was very flavorful!

You could skip the bread comes and instead combine 1/4 c. light mayo and 1/8 c.  parmesan cheese. Spread evenly over the top side of the chicken breast.  Last 3-4 minutes set oven to broil and DELISH. (rating based on recipe as is with no modifications.)

This is super easy yet looks so difficult!  I took the advice of others and wrapped the chicken with turkey bacon and also put aluminum foil over it for 10 min after removing it from the oven.  It was the perfect Valentine's Day dinner!

I really love asparagus and this is just great.  I didn't use the bread crumbs for personal pref, went with garlic salt and oregano for seasoning with lemon juice sprinkled over.  I have to wonder though, as I used split chicken breasts I prepped my self, if keeping the skin wouldn't help with the moisture problem.  Will try it that way next time.

As it stands it is a bit dry and needs more flavor, but the idea is wonderful because we love asparagus.   Makes a difference if you wrap the chicken (each breast) in bacon.   A great favor boost and the chicken is not dry.   Thanks for a great idea

I have been making this recipe almost once a week since I have found it. I'm really just learning to cook and I was so excited because my boyfriend loves it! I use sea salt and garlic seasoning along with pepper to add some flavor. I also use cream of chicken soup as other reviewers suggested and I've even used cream of mushroom. I've added mushrooms and basil to the filling if I have them. As others have suggested I use more cheese than the recipe calls for as well as Panko bread crumbs. Aside from pounding out the chicken, it's easy and delicious!

I read through the reviews.  I soaked chicken in apple juice after pounding chicken.  The dinner is in the oven.  I also wrapped with 2 slices of bacon per chicken roll.  I sprayed a piece of tin foil with cooking oil to assist with chicken when pounding, this really worked great.  More to follow.  I baked at 375 as instructed but baked for 1 hour 20 minutes.  I then removed from oven and added mushrooms and asparagus around the chicken.  I then sprinkled mozarella cheese on top of everything.  I put back in oven baked another 15 minutes and then put on broil for 3 minutes.  EVERYONE ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS AND this recipe will definitely be a KEEPER.

Quite good.  Tends to be a little too bland, but it has lovely textures.  The fresh asparagus stayed crisp even after the 40 minutes it took for the breast meat to be cooked through.  'Thinking it will be better with more cheese than the 1/4 cup called for and possibly a little something creamy spread over the asparagus before cooking.  'Even a good quality Ranch dressing might work.

These were good, but were a bit on the dry side. After going over everyone elses comments I added the cream of chicken soup over the top, and that made them great.

I did marinate the chx in an Italian dressing.  Precooked the asparagus.  Did the cheese a mix of mozzarella and feta, added chopped green onions and a dash of oregano.  After I rolled them, dusted in chopped walnuts.  sigh. Quite good if my Mom and I say so ourselves.

I had this chicken dish, sold at Costco Canada last night.  It was outstanding! This one didn't have breadcrumbs on it, just Montreal chicken spices, and so I put it into a fry pan with a drop of Olive Oil and a Tablespoon of butter and browned it on all sides.  Then, I covered it with a glass lid, set the timer for 20 minutes and it was so juicy and moist.  I thought "hey I can make this" and here is the recipe today.  I believe that mozzarella melts quickly, but feta would be a better choice.

This was so good! I ended up adding 2 teaspoons low-fat ricotta cheese, Parmesan cheese, and the mozzarella before adding the asparagus. I think the ricotta saved it from being dry like other people were commenting about. I only used a tablespoon of the other cheese too since I didn't have enough and it still came out good.

I rolled the chicken in an egg wash before coating it with the breadcrumbs too. I also sprayed the side that was facing up with oil, baked it for 15 minutes, then turned it around and did it for another 10 minutes.

Very delicious!

This is a terrific recipe, but I put a bit of a spin on it myself.  To cut down on the dryness, after pounding the chicken flat, pour massage extra virgin olive oil on both sides of each breast.  I added an Italian spin to the dish by adding garlic powder, oregano, and Italian seasoning to each side of the breasts.  When baked, I poured a marinara sauce over the top of each breast.  Also, with about 5-6 minutes left to bake, I placed a decent handful of mozzarella on the top of each breast and an additional asparagus spear for presentation.  It was terrific and a big hit with my wife and my parents!

This recipe is awesome. I did make a couple of changes. I poured olive oil in a dish and added garlic power and fresh grated garlic. I brushed this on the inside and outside of the chicken breast before I stuffed them. I also diced the asparagus. I added parsley over the cheese. I omitted the bread crumbs and added cheese to the top in the last 10 min. of cooking.  I stuffed them pretty good and had to use toothpicks to hold together. I served it with rice and extra asparagus! We loved it! I will make again! Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

My family loves this recipe! I used sliced provolone instead of Mozzarella and it was fantastic.

This was absolutely delicious!! I added a little bit of garlic salt. Next time i want to try to put some minced garlic in with the cheese. Also want to try wrapping bacon around it too. But it was great and so simple to make!

Great recipe!  I took advice from another reviewer to put olive oil on the chicken to prevent drying out (not sure it was necessary but I thought it couldn't hurt).  I'm an infrequent cook so the prep time was much longer than 20 minutes for me (though I was making 6 chicken breasts, not 2).  This dish was fantastic and made a great presentation.  Will definitely make it again!

I made this for my picky daughter tonight and she ate every last bit. Since I only had plain bread crumbs, I just sprinkles a bit of italian seasoning and garlic powder over the top and it was outrageously wonderful!! We will definitely make this again!

Very Good base recipe.  I did not have mozzarella handy so I substituted pepper jack cheese.  I also used plain bread crumbs with some ground mustard/salt/pepper mixed in.  Turned out very good and moist.

This was amazing! I marinated the asparagus in a red wine vinegarette to add a little more flavor and used plain bread crumbs, it was so delicious! I decided to use the cream of chicken as well, just to make sure that the chicken wasn't dry, great suggestion!! I loved this recipe and will be using it again in the near future!!

we liked but didnt love them..were bland. I think the previous posters were right that they need a bit of garlic added...or onion, or mustard or something. The mozzarella and aparagus didn't do much to jazzup the bland chicken. It's a good base to start with though....but not a 5 "as is".

Excellent recipe! Only suggestion I have is to beat the chicken thin. That way, when you roll up the asparagus and cheese inside, the chicken is able to cook evenly. Very good! (Equally good without the breadcrumbs)

Huge hit in my house, made it exactly how it was directed and had no issues with moistness or taste, I did add garlic,paprika, Italian flavored panko crumbs and parm cheese though! Lol so maybe not exactly as directed... but still it was good! Oh! And I had to bake it for longer than 25 mins it was more about 45 or so

So many ways to add ones own twist like adding fresh finely sliced garlic to the cheese. I used mushrooms in some and asparagus in others (spinch works too) parmesan cheese to my mozzarella as well as a little milk (or broth) to the pan and cover with aluminum  foil  to avoid driness. Uncover about 5 minutes  before chicken is complete and cook and additional 5 minutes after chicken is done to "brown" the crumbs. I served with a side of mashed potatoes and all of my kids and husband loved it

I love this recipe,but not a 5 star it can be a little dry so i take a can of cream of broccoli soup with some broccoli and put it in a bowl and mix it up and then put it in the middle of the chicken. Cuz i do not like asparagus. So so good and not dry at all you can use all types of cream soups i hope u like it!!!

I never cared for asparagus if it wasn"t canned, but this recipe cooks the asparagus just right, and the simple flavors are divine! One of my new favorite recipes.

I loved this recipe. I made a few minor changes, like not pounding the chicken so thin to avoid it drying out. Because our chicken was thicker, it took about 7 minutes longer to cook all the way through. I added garlic pepper to taste, and I doubled the amount of asparagus as well. It's in our recipe box and we will be sure to make it again and again!

Great tasting and great looking!  Hubby, daughter and mother-in-law all enjoyed this. Added garlic powder to the chicken, and since we had leftover prosciutto I wrapped a piece around each stuffed breast then baked.    Another keeper!

Quick and EASY! I added some garlic, just because i love garlic on everything. I also coated with some cream of chicken before sprinkling with the bread crumbs. Next time I'll make sure to pound the meat thinner since it was still a little pink after the cooking time.

I like this recipe, just cooked it tonight. But, I will forewarn others that if you're doubling the recipe (cooking 4 breasts), you need to double the time in the oven. It took around 50 minutes for the chicken to be fully cooked with no pink in the center. Also, I put more than the 1/4 cup of cheese in each breast and couldn't taste it at all in the final product. I did add the cream of chicken soup on top to account for the dryness others have mentioned and it pretty much dominated the flavor. In the future, I'll come up with another tasty way to moisten the chicken without stealing the asparagus/cheese flavors that I love.

I also read the reviews and found them very helpful! After pounding the chicken, I put a thin layer of mayo on both sides, like a review suggested, and then added the salt, pepper, and some garlic. I loved this dish and so did my boyfriend! VERY tasty :o)

Avoid the dryness by not pounding the chicken.  Just stuff chicken as is, cover with foil, and bake at 350 for about 40 minutes or until done, check after 30 minutes. Can pop under broiler for a minute if you like the top a little browned.  Also, blanche the asparagus first so it's not so hard.

Very yummy...although I changed things up a bit using ingredients I had on hand. Used boneless skinless chicken thighs, frozen asparagus spears, and string cheese stix's. To be honest it may have worked out better. I didn't have the dryness issue many reviewer talked about and my cheese stayed in the chicken. My family loved it, will definatly make again.

Ok so I tweaked this a little and my husband loved it- said this is a "do again."  First I briefly steamed the asparagus.  I have Rosemary infused olive oil which I rubbed on inside of chicken which I seasoned with garlic salt and pepper.  I also spread son of the olive oil around the outside after I rolled up the chicken and then pressed the Italian seasoned bread crumbs all over.  I covered the dish with foil for the first 20 minutes and then uncovered fir the last 10 minutes.  I broiled for a minute or so to crisp the crumbs.  It was wonderful.

I wrapped the chicken in bacon strips also, and I cooked it with small cut red potatoes on the same pan. Ended up cooking at 375 degrees for about 35 minutes to make sure potatoes were tender enough. Everything came out great. I also drizzled canola oil on the pan to make sure everything stayed moist.

Yummy dish!!! I did use the recommendation of wrapping 2 pieces of bacon around each piece and fresh mozzarella cheese. I also added garlic powder and sprinkled parmasean cheese in with the bread crumbs. About 15-20 minutes before the chicken was done, I also added fresh mozzarella on top because we all love extra cheese in my house. The chicken was moist and delicious. My family loved it!

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, and onion soup mix instead of Italian bread crumbs. Maybe next time I'll use both. One word, "AWESOME!!!". If it taste this good on dark meat? I can't imagine, how great it will make white meat(chicken) taste.

This was a huge hit at our house.  I used turkey, instead of chicken, that was marinated it in a little italian dressing.  I also spread a small amount of kale pesto (amazing local farmers market item) on the turkey before adding the asparagus and cheese.  Meat was moist and flavorful, loved it!

Took longer than 25 minutes to cook.  (Maybe my chicken breasts were too big and not pounded thinly enough).  Did put bacon around it and it was delicious.

Added the herb flavored mayo (basil, rosemary, oregano, and sea salt) about 1/4 teaspoon each, to the inside of the chicken and rolled up with asparagus inside.  Wrapped one piece of bacon around the chicken roll and baked until done, covering with aluminum foil the last 20 minutes.

I loved this. Simple ingredients. Easy to make. I did make some slight changes: I seasoned the chicken with Goya adobo seasoning and mashed some garlic to smear over the chicken. Gave it great flavor. I also made my own breadcrumbs using 3 slices of wholewheat bread. I seasoned the crumbs with a bit of salt, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and Parmesan cheese. I also covered the baking dish with aluminum foil and added a generous amount of olive oil to the pan. It did not turn out dry at all. It was very juicy and flavorful. I didn't give it 5 stars because I tweaked the original recipe.

This was not only good, but easy to make as well!  The only tweaking I did was add some medium Swiss cheese with the mozzarella (I love Swiss and asparagus), melted and put a little butter on the bread crumbs as it baked, and before baking I roasted the asparagus in the oven for about 7 minutes at 450.  Everything else was per the recipe.  We ALL loved it. Will definitely make this again.  We've also thought of a few variations for it, but this original was very, very good. Thanks for sharing!

These were great! Will def make again. I had some leftover asparagus so just sautéed it in a pan with some butter and put mozzarella over the top once done. This is a keeper for sure.

Alittle too plain for my liking. But not bad at all! Definetley has potential and is a good base for someone learning to cook like myself. The good part is you don't really need much. I had mine with the salad which balanced how bland the chicken tasted.

This was a very tasty and quick to make dinner.  I read reviews and brushed my rolls with sour cream, then rolled in Italian bread crumbs.  The chicken was not at all dry and the rolls plated up nicely. I was surprised how quickly dinner was on the table, so no problem for a weeknight dish. My asparagus spears were very young and thin, and i could have used more than called for in the recipe. I will correct next time. My husband was very impressed and after only two bites was showering compliments. A definite keeper, and a great option if you are having guests.

This is great and really easy to make. I chopped up some garlic, seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and adobo then marinated the chicken in olive oil and the garlic. It was not dry at all. I also used pepper jack cheese instead of mozz. One of my new favorites!

I made this tonight for dinner and it was a hit.  I did have a small issue in that I didn't get the breasts thin enough and so it took longer to cook and then the asparagus was overcooked and the mozza cheese oozed out but that was purely my error.  Everyone loved it and said it should be a staple in my recipe box.  Yeah!

this recipe is Ahhhhmazing!  I tweaked it, adding lawrys season all and garlic powder to the chicken inside and out, and sauteed the asparagus in oil, minced garlic, onions and soy sauce, then rolled them in the chicken  and that's it!.I didn't want to just boil the asparagus. Oh and wrapped these bad boys in Bacon.  Then served it with white rice and the left over asparagus.  MUST TRY THIS RECIPE!

I tweaked the recipe but to say the least everyone enjoyed it. I added butter inside of the chicken to prevent drying out and also a thin slice of butter between each chicken breast in the pan instead of greasing the pan. And I also wrapped each chicken breast in bacon and then topping them with bread crumbs.

My rating is based on the changes I made, so it's not a true "rating" of the listed recipe.... I coated the pounded breast with mayo as others suggested and then with pesto.  On top of that I placed red onion and red pepper since I didn't have asparagus and wasn't running to store again.  Then on top on my mixture I placed swiss cheese.  Rolled it up and held it together with cooking twine wrapped around it just to hold it in place.  After this I rolled it in a beaten egg to help the Panko bread crumbs stick to it and then rolled it in the Panko crumbs placed it in the greased baking dish to bake.  I didn't pound the breast thin enough to bake only 25 minutes so it took probably twice as long and I turned the oven down to 350 degrees half way through baking as another reviewer suggested.  This turned out great for us but granted I changed basically everything, sorry I just went with what I had and took a few suggestions in from others.  Don't be afraid to alter a recipe to your liking.

Awesome.  When I read about the dryness, I brushed a little olive oil on it and it was just fine.  Asparagus was just right, not soggy but a little firm.  I couldn't quite keep the cheese & asparagus together so I inserted toothpicks to hold it together.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I made this last night because I had everything on hand, and I was very pleasantly surprised at how well it turned out.  I wrapped two slices of bacon around each roll, and compiled for 25 minutes as the recipe directed, then I turned on the broiler and left them in for 5 minutes longer.  After resting for 5 minutes, my husband and I thought this was delicious!

Thanks Madenish!

This was very good. I covered both sides with salt, pepper, and garlic powder then with  panko crumbs. Then, I browned all sides in a frying pan with some Olive oil. It needs more than just salt and peeper or it would've been plain so I'm glad I added some garlic powder. I covered it with foil and baked in the oven about 45 minutes and took the foil off the last ten minutes. Once it was cooked I covered with the chicken with cream of mushroom soup. I'll add more cheese next time but  overall this was a good recipe.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly which is why I am only giving it four stars. It was amazing the way I made it! Instead of beating the chicken into thin pieces I bought thin sliced chicken. I also coated both side of the chicken in greek seasoning instead of salt and pepper. Based on other reviewers comments I spread Dukes mayonaise on one side of the chicken and covered the mayonnaise in panko crumbs before adding the asparagus and mozzarella. I also probably used a little more than 1/4 cup of the mozzarella cheese. I'm not 100% sure on that since I rarely measure my ingrediants. The asparagus was cooked through and delicious, but a little cruchier than my husband and I usually like it so I will probably try rolling the asparagus in olive oil and greek seasoning and grilling it litghtly before rolling it in the chicken next time. The presentation of this meal is beautiful and I cannot wait to make it for company. It was quick and delicious to make and I know it will be a staple in the future.

I keep seeing that the chicken was dry. You will never have dry chicken again if you marinate it in buttermilk overnight! Just rinse it off, pat it dry and cook as you normally would.

Tried it last night.  The family liked it.  But a few things I will do different next time.  The asparagus was still crunchy...almost too crunchy, I guess I'll cook it a little more next time.  I may not have flattened the chicken enough.  And the asparagus spears were quite large.  Perhaps those two things combined resulted in the crunchy asparagus.  I did sprinkle some garlic powder on the chicken and added a can of cream of chicken soup per the recommendation of another reviewer.  The chicken was not dry at all.  It was actually quite tasty.

made this for Mother's Day yesterday as my sister and Mom are both eating very low-carb.  It was super easy and delicious! i don't particularly like how pasty white the chicken looked, so we broiled it a bit to get a bit of brown on top.  Also, i added some seasonings (this recipe doesn't really call for any other than S&P, so that's kinda weird, i sprinkled some all-purpose seasoning in the middle prior to the rolling-up.)  It came out juicy and everyone loved it!

It was easy, except for all of the pounding.  I think next time I will butterfly the chicken instead.  Everyone loved it.  Served with lemon potatoes, leftovers were just as popular as the first time around!

My fiancé loved it. I brushed the chicken with olive oil before adding bread crumbs and let it sit covered in foil after coming out if the oven for 10-15 minutes as suggested. The chicken was moist not dry. It took the dish about double the suggested back time on the temperature of 375 degrees. In the future I might increase the temp. A bit.

We pounded the breasts and then soaked in brine for 45 minutes (as we always do for chicken). Kept them very juicy. Then eliminate the salt you'd add later. Also went with low-fat four Mexican shredded cheese for fewer calories and more flavor. Added some garlic. This will become a regular meal in our kitchen.

Delicious.  Seasoned chicken with black pepper and granulated garlic.  As suggested,I put a thin layer of mayo on chicken rolls then topped with panko bread crumbs.  Broiled a bit to make the crumbs brown.

This was so good!  I made exactly as recipe is read, but as per another reviewer, I poured a can of cream of chicken soup over it and then a little more cheese on top and baked 30 mins.  It was not dry at all and tasted really good.  Definitely will make again!

This was amazing!!!!!!!!!!! I didn't use any bread crumbs or salt. I used a little pepper, mrs dash, and sprayed a little no cal butter on it all. (Which made it only 290 calories!) I had 2 bundles of asparagus, so I put it under the chicken wraps.

I make this with monterey jack cheese.  Love the nuttiness of the asparagus.  I also don't use bread crumbs...just sprinkle with some seasoning (I like essence of emeril)
I also pre-make these & freeze.  Pop one out of the freezer & straight into the oven for lunch.

I think this was delicious and very easy to make, I made this last night just one serving which feeds two as the recipe calls for.  I shared with my daughter then I made another serving last night to give her one to take home and I brought one to work today and my co workers loved it and plan on making their own.  I followed the directions exactly.  Really good making more tonight. Sorry one change I couldn't find the Italian bread crumbs so I had plain ones at home and I had some Italian seasoning that stay refrigerated so I mixed the two and it was so good.

After reading reviews about dryness, I marinated the chicken in an herb and garlic marinate over night. While the chicken was baking I added 1/4 cup of chicken broth to the bottom of the baking dish. This was simiply DELICIOUS! Will try again :)

After reading other reviews, I decided to use cut 3 slices per piece of chicken from a brick of mozzarella instead of shredding it. Then I placed another piece of mozzarella on top and wrapped the whole piece of chicken in a piece of turkey bacon.  Sprinkled with bread crumbs.  It was delicious!

A very yummy recipe, especially if you like asparagus.  I personally am not a huge fan of asparagus, but in a dish like this I eat it.  My husband absolutely loves it.  The only tip I will give in regards to preparation is that it is messy.  Handling the chicken breasts and wrapping them around the asparagus and cheese... if you don't like really messy hands, wear gloves.  But either way it's worth it.

I also used thin chicken breasts so I didn't have to pound them out. I used less cheese in the middle and less bread crumbs but I added additional cheese the last 5 minutes or so when baking it. I also added garlic powder for more flavor. It was good though, my boyfriend and I ate the entire thing :)

A quick and easy stuffed chicken recipe.  I felt the recipe calls for too many bread crumbs.  I would suggest cutting the bread crumbs in half and you will probably still have too much.

HUGE hit with my family - my daughter's response, "You WILL make this again soon".  I agree with other reviewers - add mayo to both sides of the chicken to keep moist.

So simple and delicious....I added Granulated Garlic as well as salt (just a pinch) and pepper. I had Garlic Mashed with Chicken Gravy as well as using the rest of the Asparagus and cheese roasted together as a side. Everyone absolutely raved.

I like to cut corners when able..... so rather than pound chicken breasts, I used already thin chicken breast cutlets, sprinkled chopped garlic on each, then thinly sliced fresh mozzerella & as I rolled, put a thin asparagus spear, thus usually using maybe 4 or so.  Placing seam side down, I squirted mayo on each spread w/butter knife  & sprinkled panko crumbs on them. I also had snapped the lower parts of the asparagus off, & tossed them in the foil lined pan & tossed evoo on them.  Cooked a bit less than 25 minutes.  Bon Appitite

I made this for my wife one Sunday night, and she loved it. Even my 20-month-old daughter, who turns her nose up at meat, ate this chicken. I used fresh mozzarella and all wrapped in some turkey bacon. It was wonderful. Thanks for the easy/simple and delicious recipe.

What a great dinner!  I didn't use bread crumbs as I wanted to eliminate the crabs.  Instead, I used a garlic, herb spice on the top of the chicken breasts.  The dryness problem can be avoided if you make sure you get a thickness of 1/4 inch, and you watch your baking time.  You could also add some cheese on the top the last two minutes of baking.  I accompanied this with the Spagehtti Squash found on this site also.  It was so easy to fix this dinner, between the two recipes I was eating dinner within an hour!

Followed the recipe as written although I followed other reviewers suggestion and mixed some mayo and herbs together and spread it on both sides of the chicken.  Such an easy and tasty meal.  Next time I may use pepper jack cheese to try and add a bit more spice to it...

This recipe was very easy to make.  I used 1 large chicken breast and cut it horizontal in half to serve 2 in my household.  I didn't have italian bread crums, just plain, so I added italian seasoning to my plain panko bread crumbs and it turned out great.  The asparagus was  not cooked as much as I like, so I think I'll cook it some first next time.  I served it with chicken low sodium rice-a-roni and added some asparagus the last 15 minutes of cooking and it also turned out great and paired perfectly with the chicken.  I defiantly will make this again.

Instead of mozeralla I put the vege flavored cream cheese and also sprinkled parmesan cheese on top of the bread crumbs.

Super easy and good! I twiked the recipe a little by mixing mayo and fresh mashed garlic (2 gloves) together and covering the chicken with the mix! Delicious! Since I didn’t have any Asparagus, I decided to use fresh spinach! It was a huge hit for dinner! Will be doing this recipe again!

Great dish! As with the other reviews, a mayo coating kept it moist. I also added a slice of cheese for on top, because we love cheese.

After reading reviews, I made two with mayo (spread on top before crumbs) and two with olive oil (brushed inside & outside of chicken). I covered with aluminum foil after ten minutes and cooked for 15 more. Both ways turned out delicious and moist. Maybe the mayo had just a little more flavor, but it depends on what you want in your diet. We loved them!

Based on other suggestions, I covered the chicken with condensed cream of chicken soup to keep it moist and also create some sauce for the side dishes.  It was easy and turned out great!

Definitely an impressive dish, as pretty as it is delicious! For the 2 of us, i just smoothed on a little  Miracle Whip and Italian seasoned panko. The chicken was moist with a golden topping. Will make for next dinner guests!

This dish cries out for pesto.  Add pesto to the asparagus-mozzarella inside and drizzle pesto on the outside prior to adding the seasoned breadcrumbs for a moist and  tasty dish.

This recipe was fantastic and easy to prepare. I did make some changes to spice it up. like others I added garlic and red peppers with asparagus and to ensure not to dry out the chicken try adding cream of asparagus soup on top after cooking for 20 min. cover dish with foil after adding soup and bake for another 10 min. you wont be disappointed.

Gets points for being easy, but it's pretty dry, even with some prosciutto. Maybe if you used a sauce,  otherwise just didn't do it for me.

Added a layer of baby spinach before the asparagus and cheese. That was a nice touch. The second time I grated some pepper jack 1/2. & 1/2 with the mozzarella, adding a different flavor. It’s really good either way.

Wow! Super yummy! 
Instead of using a couple of tablespoons of mayonnaise as suggested in the video, I cut back on the pepper I added to the chicken breast and mixed some lemon pepper with about a cup of mayonnaise to cover the top of the chicken breasts. Then I sprinkled them with the breadcrumbs and baked them covered for about 25 minutes and uncovered for another 10 minutes. So moist and juicy! My husband requested that I make this again sometime very soon.

I’m not a fan of bread crumbs so I omitted them altogether. Rather than pound the chicken, I cut a pocket and stuffed it. Since the breasts were thick, I baked them for an hour. Will definitely make again!

Great recipe!  I've made this several times, its a go -to when I'm having company and I don't know what to serve.  It's so easy.  Sometimes I wrap bacon around the rolled up chicken breast - that is always a great hit.  Have also made it with spinach instead of asparagus.

I took Terri Newby’s advice and spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on the chicken breast and then sprinkled Panko crumbs on top. I also used cheddar cheese, as that’s what I had. Of course, my prediction of a cheesy melted delicious mess underneath, came true, but it was still delicious!

I tested this during the week in anticipation of making it for company this weekend. I made two changes: I spread Boursin cheese over the chicken breast instead of using Mozarella to give it more flavor, and I spread mayonnaise over the top of the rolled breasts to seal in moisture. I am hoping to score a big hit this weekend with our guests!

This was easy and a hit with my husband and toddler!  I carefully sliced the chicken breasts instead of pounding, dipped in egg and then covered with breadcrumbs.  Once in the dish, I sprinkled with pepper and season salt.  I served with rice pilaf and corn.  No dryness problem.  This will definitely go into our rotation.  Thank you!

The only change I made was I had my husband make it while I read him the recipe and drank a Manhattan. So it was excellent all around. I highly recommend it.

Super simple to make. Some reviewers mentioned dryness so rather than change the ingredients, I parcooked the asparagus first for about 3 minutes in the microwave then reduced the cooking time of the chicken once assembled to 18-20 minutes. I also greased my cooking pan with olive oil then drizzled a little over the chicken breasts.  The breasts I used were smaller so juices ran clear at 18 and I had four asparagus spears per breast. I'll be making this again, thanks!

I think this was a great tasting dish for as few ingredients that it had. My husband was able to tolerate it very well with his tummy troubles. I will definitely make this again. The only comment my husband had was that the asparagus was too tough in the middle of the chicken. Maybe very thin spears would be best.

Since I was making this recipe for the first time while on vacation in a rental condo without mozzarella or mayonnaise, I substituted Comte (aged French cheese) and an egg.  I had really large chicken breasts, so actually rolled 8 spears of asparagus inside each flattened breast.  I think I will make it with a similarly aged strong cheese in the future and not bother with mozzarella because we liked the cheese’s stronger flavor coming thru.

We’re low carb in our household so I omitted the bread crumbs and sprinkled rosemary, basil and oregano on top instead. Added a dollop of salsa right before serving. Yum!

I doubled the asparagus.  Brush butter on chicken rolls before baking.  Used fried sliced mushrooms instead of bread crumbs. Put mushrooms on after baking, sprinkle on shredded cheese, put back in oven for a few minutes to melt cheese, done.  Very good very easy.  Great for dinner guests.

This looked impressive and tasted great! The best part...it required very little effort. My favorite type of recipe! I added a pat of butter on top of each chicken breast after the bread crumbs! This will definitely be a staple in my go to meals!

I also followed the mayo trick and my chicken breasts came out moist and so flavorful. I loved that the bread crumbs on top  roasted because it gave the breast a crunch. I have made this dish a couple times now.

This dish was delicious and not a hard dish to make. I would have given it a 5 star but  getting the chicken to be pounded  to the size as breasts vary and the amount of the ingredients  to place inside was challenging.

I rubbed my asparagus in olive oil and sprinkled salt on it before rolling it in the chicken. At the advice of another reviewer, I spread mayo on top of the chicken after rolling to prevent dryness. Topped with garlic herb bread crumbs. Very easy and Very yummy! Will add to the dinner rotation!

I've made this enough to experiment; this time I used Eden cheese mixed with Asiago.  This was great but good grief it was so much better as a left over; the Asparagus had time to blend with the cheeses.  My wife was impressed that there was no 
Asparagus fragrance later:)

Great recipe! If you have a crock pot that bakes, I highly recommend it. With the reviews saying it came out dry, I cooked it in my slow cooker with some water to help it stay moist! :) will definitely make it again! Thank you!

I thought this was a very good dish. I coated the outside in mayonnaise before adding the breadcrumbs. I also added some parmesan cheese on the outside. I baked it at 400 for 25-30 minutes and it was nice and juicy.

My chicken didn’t dry out at all even after reheating 2 days later. I marinated my chicken instead of following their seasoning instructions.

The only change I made was I mixed my seasonings (salt, pepper, and garlic salt) with some mayo and spread it on both side of the chicken to make it moist. Me and my 8 year old loved it.

Tasty and easy to make.  The second time I  used a little more asparagus and cheese a a little less bread crumbs and thought it was better.

I thought it was delicious. My wife is the real cook in the family, so when she raved about it, I knew it was a keeper & will definently make it again. We substituted "French's crispy fried onions" for the bread crumbs. Crush up & lay a bed of them in the pan under the chicken & sprinkle more on top. The added flavor puts it over the top.

When I watched the video, I realized the reason was so dry and tasteless was because brushing it with mayonaise is omitted from the printed recipe.  Very bland, doubt I will make again.

I will definitely make this again.  I did place a thin coating of mayonnaise on both sides of the chicken breast to maintain moisture of the meat and I blanched my asparagus before stuffing the chicken breast to ensure that it was done sufficiently  (I prefer tender crisp, but others in my family do not). Flavor and presentation were great!

Took the advice of a number of people and coated the outside with a generous coating of mayo and I also added grated Parmesan cheese to the Italian bread crumbs for added flavor and a crisper topping. Great recipe, will make this time and time again.

This was a very quick and delicious meal I made for the wife and I.  Since we just ate Asparagus last night, I subbed it out with spinach.   Also put Miracle Whip on chicken, then coated with the bread crumbs.  Moist and delish!!

Use the mayo trick to keep moist, AND melt some butter with garlic powder, then drizzle it over the breasts when they are done!!!

I used sliced mozzarella just because it was on sale and not as messy to use. I added a little garlic powder on top for some more flavor. Turned out perfectly!

Great recipe always turns out great. I personally use regular mayo on top to maintain the moistness I know it’s probably bad for me but it’s delicious.

Delicious as written,  (definitely add some Hellmans and panko to keep it moist) my only other recommendation is to try smoked mozzarella - it adds a really nice flavour.

We had no problem with dryness. Our chicken came from Sam's club which has the breasts so thick we call the "buzzard Breasts"....cut the fat off, slice a pocket in the breast for the asparagus, salt & pepper to taste (we use Everglades Seasoning as it has a dash of garlic with it); after placing the asparagus in the breasts, we stuff with an AMISH CHEESE (COLBY JACK is out favorite) and it melts wonderfully. These are amazing, even as left overs, still  flavorful & moist.

I made this recipe just as written, with the recommendation of the mayo in it. It was DELISH!!! And so easy, so cheap to make, but plates up so eloquently.   I think next time I will sub for goat cheese and Panko just to change things up, but you cant go wrong with making this just as directed.  I can’t wait to make this again. YUM

This was really good. Mine was juicy, not dry, but it may be a because I used chicken thighs instead of breasts. Brushed them with mayo with some Chipotle pepper in there, and rolled in gluten-free bread crumbs. Otherwise, did exactly as written. I did have to cook for about 40 minutes, but once I covered it with foil, it cooked a lot faster. Next time I'll cover to begin, then uncover to crisp up for the last 10 minutes or so. I then put sautéed mushrooms and shallots on top, and served with rice, as suggested. I'll make this again, for sure!

I rubbed the outside with a little of mayo before the crumbs and it turned out great!! All the kids loved it and I have some picky eaters who have sensory issues and it was a hit with everyone, not dry at all! The kids asked to add it to the rotation. Thanks!

Very quick and easy meal, I would suggest steaming the asparagus ahead of time, they are very crunchy/raw if you only cook them in the chicken

The recipe skips the step where you spread mayonnaise over the breasts before sprinkling  with bread crumbs...kind of a crucial step to prevent dryness...as shown on video.

As other reviews suggested, I added cream of chicken soup on top to try to avoid dryness. Also, I had to cook for a longer time than suggested - could be because the pieces of chicken I got were pretty large. Overall very good!!

I rubbed mayo over the chicken breasts before dipping in the bread crumbs.  It retained the moisture in chicken.  Delicious!

Great recipe! I followed others' advice and coated my rolls with a light coat of mayo to prevent drying. I crushed up garlic Parmesan croutons to use as bread crumbs which added some extra flavor, plus I sprinkled a little garlic powder over the top before baking. Mine took about 45 min. to cook, maybe I didn't pound the chicken thin enough. Will definitely make this again!

I have made this dish a few times now and its great every time. Adding mayo really helps with the drying out issues and help the panko stick. they didnt have asparagus at my local store today so I am going to try spinach and mushrooms for filling tonight.

This was an amazing dinner, and so easy to make. Everyone ate it all up. I took the suggestions to add garlic powder to the raw chicken and I did use some mayonnaise before adding the cracker crumbs. I did need to bake it an additional 10 min or so because I crammed them all into a dish together. Make sure there is space between each one to ensure even cooking.

very good! easy week night dinner! I didn't bread the chicken because I forgot to buy bread crumbs. so after I pounded them thinner I coated them in olive oil and for seasoning I did salt, pepper, paprika, chicken granules, garlic and onion powder. I also did a couple slices of ham lunch meat and sliced provolone with the asparagus inside. browned in skillet first and baked covered at 375 for about 30 minutes.

Delicious! Little olive is after wrapping the chicken to keep it moist along with the aluminum foil covering 10 mins after taking it out the oven. Intend on making this again.

Excellent chicken recipe.  Used some olive oil mayo like other reviews suggested to keep the chicken moist and used gluten free panko bread crumbs. Will definitely make this again.

I read the reviews and took someone's advice and drizzled pesto on top of it before baking it. That was a smart move. I think without some sort of extra seasoning, it might be bland. Experiment! Pesto is a solid winner.

This was terrific, but I did make a lot of changes. Wow, so good!!! I mixed mayonnaise and three cloves of garlic with salt, pepper, Provence herb blend, garlic & herb seasoning blend, and table blend. (I ended up having to make this twice to have enough for the entire package of tenderloins.) I spread this on the inside of the pounded chicken, added a slice of herbed goat cheese and five asparagus. I rolled each tightly, then coated the outside with more of the mayonnaise mixture. I added to a pyrex dish coated in grapeseed oil. I drizzled balsamic vinegar lightly over them and baked as directed using convection instead. The last few minutes, I sprinkled mozzarella cheese over them and baked just until melted. They were done early and were scrumptious. We eat low carb, but for guests I would serve with a crusty loaf of bread and a softened butter or olive oil/herb mixture and a light salad with a balsamic dressing. This was like a fancy restaurant. Superb.

I marinated the chicken in a kind of homemade creamy Italian dressing overnight. (I added some mayo and extra garlic to Italian dressing). I also added fresh spinach and roasted red peppers with the asparagus.  The marinade held the light layer of Italian bread crumbs well. I have made this dish 3 times now and like to change a bit each time. Delicious recipe!!

Four stars only because I truly dislike rolling food in chicken. I do it because it usually ends up tasting good and this time was no exception. The Asparagus in the chicken was wonderful. I really enjoyed this dish, as did my family, including the kids! Will definitely make this again. Didn't change a thing. (Although I did use toothpicks to help hold the chicken together once rolled. The asparagus stalks were huge.)

Absolutely delicious! This has quickly become a favorite and it's pretty healthy too! I serve it with Smashed Cauliflower (recipe from JAMVS).
Although, I usually have to cook it longer than 25 minutes.

dish was good! I can see how many people have commented that it was dry. I didn't have shredded mozzarella but my small mozzarella cubes (from the ball shape) worked just as well. We didn't notice much asparagus flavor, maybe increase the amount next time?

As a reader suggested I sauteed mushrooms and added to the dish about 15 minutes into baking, I did cover and continue baking almost another 25 min. until chicken was finished. I started with huge chicken breasts, there was no way I could get them to 1/4 inch; overall a success and worth repeating. next time i'll try and remember the breadcrumbs :(

Very Good.   Will definitely make this again. I took others advise to prevent dryness and brushed some mayo on the inside and outside before rolling. I also took someones advise about the marinated mushrooms. When I make it again I will forget the mushrooms. Thanks

I followed the one review and used mayo with the breadcrumbs. I was a bit concerned that the chicken wouldn't stay in its roll when it came out of the oven, but it stayed together nice and tight. My girlfriend (at the time) is a cook and into nutrition management.  She said I did well.

It was relatively easy to prepare and delicious.  I did add a dash of garlic powder to the salt and pepper sprinkled on the chicken before wrapping the it around the asparagus.  Will definitely make it again!!

i add a slice of prosciutto to each roll up. Then I make a package of knorr Bearnaise sauce to drizzle over each one before serving. the result is truly incredible. 5 star restaurant quality, very easy and reasonably priced to make. thanks for the great recipe.

I made this as the recipe called for a couple times and really enjoyed it, but I did agree that it tended to be a bit dry.  I then tried it with fresh mozzarella and the natural moisture fixed the issue!

loved it. I added spinach to mine as well.  next time I plan on adding mayo or some sort of dressing to keep the chicken moist.  Also plan on broiling for a minute to brown and crisp the bread crumbs or will use Panko Bread Crumbs.

Turned out very well a kinda' miracle in its self since I'm no cook...Made for Mothers Day...15 people...All the husbands did the cooking/serving....Didn't want to add the mayo for dryness issue, thought it might change the overall taste......coated with a little virgin olive oil before going in to the oven, also added slivers of jalapeno in a few to get taste test approval, also added dill ...used "convection bake" setting...big hit with all, especially the 5 mom's we were honoring.

I would definitely make this again. I  moistened the inside of the chicken  with olive oil before filling it with the asparagus  and mozzarella cheese.  I coated the chicken with a balsamic glaze before sprinkling with salt and pepper and rolling it in bread crumbs. Lots of flavour and moist.

This a variation on one of my favorite "single guy" recipes.  This is Good.

Some comments:
1. I don't have a meat hammer (tenderizer) so I often use a rolling pin as a hammer. Recently, I found that my granite pestle did an excellent job.
2. I find that parchment paper works better for me than plastic.
3. I put a large pat of butter on top of the rolls before baking. Seems to help with dryness. But, I really like the pesto idea someone mentioned.

Finally, the version I started with used feta cheese instead of mozzarella, and basil (lots and lots) instead of asparagus. And, as a single guy, you don't really need to do two.

Followed instructions but added minced mushrooms and put a layer of mayo on top before adding bread crumbs. My rolls were pretty large and took 40 minutes to cook.  Very good,  family enjoyed it,  not dry at all.

This is amazing! I looked at the reviews and am I happy I did. So put cream of chicken on them (both sides) before the bread crumbs. Lined a glass pan with tin foil then cooked for 20 mins then for another 10 minutes put foil on top (I like my chicken very cooked) they were so so so easy and so delicious

I've never in my life made this kind of meal. Honestly my husband tells everyone I can't cook and believe me I was only good at spaghetti. Now, I have been learning how to look up recipes and make them within a short amount of time. I'm So Excited to Say I OVE THIs RECIPE! 
However, instead of 25min to cook, I cook mine for 30min and then check the internal temp and cook another 30min. I also lay whatever cheese I may want to try that day on the chicken and then lay out my asparagus (roughly 6 or 7) across the cheese and chicken and then roll it. kind of  like a tortilla. :-)
Gives more asparagus and cheese to eat. 
Oh yeah, I add a little Italian season to the top as well. 
Thank you so much for this recipe!

Made these recently and they turned out great. To avoid drying out I used foil over the pan for the first half. I also tossed the asparagus in some olive oil with some Parmesan and garlic powder before inserting in the chicken and this provides a little more flavor to the chicken.

Made this recipe several times.  First time with chicken breast.  Then tried it with chicken thigh, because that's my husbands favorite part.  The second time using thighs, I reduced the amount of mayo and cut the asparagus shorter.  Saved the asparagus pieces for soup.

Omg so good! I did tweek it. Instead of asparagus....i made some with brocolli and some with spinach. I added garlic powder on one side and did the cream of chicken soup on top to help with dryness. amazing.

I roll the chicken in either fat free mayo or just spray with some pam. It has never been dry for me. I make it with tomato and thinly sliced garlic as well, and sometimes do broccoli instead of asparagus

This was a really good dish. I got already thinned chicken breast to avoid pounding them really thin. I also, like many reviewers suggested, spread some mayo on top of the chicken wraps when they were in the baking dish. I then sprinkled the Italian seasoned bread crumbs over the chicken, baked it for 30 minutes, and these were great. I loved how moist the chicken was and the asparagus and cheese gave it a nice texture. I served these with instant garlic mashed potatoes and it was a nice, easy, quick summer meal.

I made it last night for my family, I substituted parmesan cheese for the mozzarella.  It turned out beautifully.  My family stated it was good enough for a restaurant (yeah, it was probably a love inspired compliment, but still tasted great).

This is really yummy!  My non-asparagus eating hubby said it was good, as he wolfed it down. I added a bit more cheese and also put some grated cheese on top. The flavor of the asparagus melds really well with the cheese and the chicken.  I seasoned the chicken well with salt and pepper before assembling.  I always flatten chicken breasts using an 8" diameter iron skillet on a NON-wood cutting board.  I whack it with the flat bottom of the skillet until the chicken is the right thickness.  I had no problem with dryness.   I will be using this recipe again!

I made this last night, my husband and I enjoyed the dish, but I'm giving the dish 4 stars since I tweaked the recipe quite a bit.  I always read the reviews and most of the time use the original recipe as a starting point.  I am on a restricted saturated fat diet and this is how I prepared the dish and I hope this is helpful to all.
I roasted my asparagus in the oven with olive oil, salt and pepper at 400 for 6 minutes, let them cool while I prepared the chicken, which I took Panko bread crumbs added dried parsley flakes and I use a garlic and roasted red pepper seasoning from McCormick.  I then used Olive Oil mayo and some Go Veggie parmesan cheese and made a paste.  I then seasoned my chicken w/salt and pepper and placed a slice of Go Veggie Swiss cheese on the cutlet, then the asparagus and rolled, then taking a spatula spread the mayo mixture and then roll into the panko bread crumbs and place in a greased baking pan. I cooked the chicken for 20 minutes, turning after 10 minutes.  They did come a little dry due to the fat free cheese, next time I will use a metal or foil pan (I used glass) and deglaze the pan w/some broth and white wine to create a sauce.  The flavor and concept of this dish is terrific.  I served w/sautéed mushrooms and a seasoned faro. I will definitely be making this again.

Instead of coating in bread crumbs I wrap each asparagus/chicken roll with a piece of bacon.  No need to grease the bottom of the pan either...simply delicious!  I also serve over a bed of risotto.

The recipe was great and to keep the chicken from drying out I did smear a little mayonnaise before I breaded the chicken.  For the future I might add pesto on the inside.  I might also find a different type of cheese to use as Mozzarella doesn't have much flavor

This was a huge hit!!  I changed a few things based on other reviews...first I saved time/calories by buying thin sliced chicken breasts instead of pounding out regular ones.  I also steamed the asparagus a little (not fully) before putting it in the chicken.  The last thing I changed was I smeared a little bit of light mayo on the rolled up breasts and then sprinkled with whole wheat panko. It came out super juicy and delicious!!!  Will definitely be making again!

Since I'm familiar with cooking snitzels from chiken breast , I have  used the same method to flatten the chicken which is use the top of a glass bottle (like a wine bottle) to flatten the meat. I added mustard, Texmex shredded cheese, but not as much as directed and I BBQed the rolls on a non sticky cooking sheet . The cheese staid in and melted to perfection, the cooking time  was cut in half because chkn was very thin and I served this with buttered mushrooms &garlic and a sprinkle of crisp onions. Was very good but gave a 4 stars because my version turned out better ;).

I really liked this recipe. It was super easy. I did not have any dryness issues. The chicken and asparagus were both perfectly done. My 2.5 year old son cleaned his plate and asked for more. I will be making this dish again.

Cook at 350 for 45 minutes, chicken is perfect.  Lower temp keeps it from drying out.

This recipe is a keeper...but did have problem with the asparagus getting cooked.  Next time I will partially cook the asparagus before assembling the rolls.  Also mixed 1/2 cup mayo with the mozzarella, spread on the chicken, added the asparagus and then make the rolls.  The overall taste was fantastic!!  Thanks for the post!!

I read the reviews and decided to combat the dryness I would soak the chicken in buttermilk.  I made 5 breasts so cooked them a little longer with no dryness.  There was alot of residual liquid in the bottom of the casserole dish and I wish I had surrounded the breasts with more asparagus, as I believe it would have cooked perfectly.  A delicious and easy recipe!--Linda

I have an asparagus bed and wanted to try something different with it. I used the other reviewers suggestions. And used some mayonnaise to coat the chicken and used pan I bread crumbs.

It turned out really good!  I wish I would have added more spices (italian) to the chicken though.  I will be sure to next time.

Amazing! Bought thin sliced chicken so didn't need to pound flat. Found out I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs after all, but we each picked a seasoning to add with the bread crumbs & we all loved our own creation.

This recipe was very good and easy to make! For added flavor, I marinated the pounded chicken breasts in Italian salad dressing for a few hours.
