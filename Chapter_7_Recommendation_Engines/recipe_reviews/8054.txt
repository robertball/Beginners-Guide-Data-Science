This works great!  Try it this way:  - Draw a 9 inch square on a piece of paper, label top left corner "A".  Top right corner is "B",  bottom left corner is "C",  bottom right corner is "D".  From "A", measure DOWN 5 inches, make a mark.  Again from "A", measure ACROSS 5 1/2 inches, make a mark.  Now draw a gently curved line between the two marks, curving TOWARD "A".   Now, from "D", measure UP 6 inches, make a mark. Again from "D", measure ACROSS 6 inches, make a mark. Now draw a curved line--curving TOWARD "D"--between those two marks.  You should see a "football" (fish body) shape in the middle of the paper.  The larger leftover piece at bottom right is the fishtail, the smaller leftover piece at top left will be top and bottom fins--just cut it in approximate half to make two fins.  Cute and simple, thank you, Robin!
