This is a great recipe.  I originally found this on the www.nestle.com.ph site awhile back.  If making it for home instead of entertaining, i divide the ingredients into 4 smaller tupperware containers.  This recipe yeilds around 12 actual servings, not 24.  Cut the mangos thinly and place evenly on top of the ladyfingers, which will yeild a more presentable and layered look.

This is one of my very favorite desserts - it's wonderful!  It's definitely not 24 servings, probably more like 12 small servings.
