We liked this! I didn't follow the recipe fully, I just saut√©ed some onion and added the chicken and put some green chiles, enchilada sauce, and cheap beer in and let it cook 20 minutes.

I've been looking for a good shredded chicken taco recipe for sometime.   This is the one.   It tastes rich even though it is relatively quick to make.    Three things boost the richness.  1.the ancho chili.... I started with a whole dried chili, seeded it, and ground in my spice grinder    2. Choice of beer.   I used an IPA.  I'm thinking a stout would be interesting too.   3. Once everything is in the pot, Cook it down!   Yes it is kind of watery...as some have mentioned.... however if you simmer it at a slight boil with the cover off; stirring occasionally,  the excess liquid goes away,  the meat gets more tender,  and the flavors are amplified...in about 1/2 hour.   I used my favorite green enchilada sauce.... Red enchilada sauce would compete with the ancho and the beer and make a confused flavor I think.

I used a rotisserie chicken and it came out delicious. A tasty filling for flour tortillas or crispy shells. Next time, I will make sure to cook rice with it, as it would make a great taco bowl!

Easy and tasty. Made it in crock pot with three large breasts. Would use 4 next time. Had extra "juice". i used Trader Joe's enchilada sauce. It was done on high for 4 hours. Thanks for a good, different version of chicken taco meat!

The flavor of this is wonderful but I always  want to make for another day so mine had a lot of liquid so I'm going to add rice to sop it up

This was very good. I accidentally put a bit too much beer in and it was a little runny but the taste was delicious. I will be making this again.
