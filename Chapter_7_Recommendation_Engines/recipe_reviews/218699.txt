I used Bob's Red Mill Cracked Wheat Hot Cereal and the exact amount of flour requested. Instead of butter I used fat free sour cream. I let the dough initially rise in a warm place for 30 minutes (instead of 10 minutes), and then an additional 45 minutes once in the loaf pan. The dough rose beautifully! The rosemary was a wonderful addition, I absolutely LOVED this bread and will definitely make it again!

Instead of using the cracked wheat,I used Bob's Red Mill 10 grain hot cereal.I really can't rate this according to the orginal recipe because I tried to make this more like a 10 grain bread.I had to use more flour than called for .I found that this was very dense and heavy.When I mixed this according to the recipe flour amounts, the mixture was very sticky.therefore I had to add more flour to be able to work with it.Mabe because I used the grains instead of the cracked wheat.If anyone  tries out this recipe as I did,mabe you can experiment a little more than I did.I was afraid to keep adding more flour.I will try this recipe again using the cracked wheat to see if it makes a difference in the texture.Aside from not getting much rise,it had a wonderful taste.

Like Donna, I had to add a lot more flour to get an elastic dough with this recipe. I added about 1/4C extra whole wheat flour and another 1/4C unbleached AP flour (estimated). I didn't get a lot of rise with the bread on the initial rest and I was a bit worried that the dough was too dry due to my additions. It rose beautifully in a cool oven (my kitchen is very drafty) and baked to a beautiful golden brown. My only real problem is that it honestly doesn't taste like anything at all. Maybe I forgot the salt? :(

This is a really tasty bread. I use a bread machine on the dough setting and for the final rise I put it the pan.  I have made 3x.  The first time it didn't rise very much and seemed WAY too wet.  I used 1.5 c of WW Flour the second time and reduced the water to 1 1/3 cups. IT WAS PERFECT...the second loaf was the same. Go forth and bake!

Tasty bread.. very hearty. I ran out of butter, so had to sub canola oil at the last minute. Came out fine. Rose nicely. I had never used rapid rise yeast before. It worked great. This was a nice compliment to some chili
