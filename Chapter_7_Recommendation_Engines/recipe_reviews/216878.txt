I used halibut instead of salmon. Worked very well. This is the closest recipe I've found that replicates the dishes we regularly ate in Russia.

Added a few ingredients to the serving sauce that made a huge difference: lemon juice, capers, caper liquid, and mustard.

This was very good and fairly easy to make. My 6 year old even liked it! I made it as individual packets and they were very filling.
