Yummy.. my only change was to use a spicy salt. I love butternut squash, but I like it best with a little heat to offset the sweet

Delicious! I wanted this as a main and it did t disappoint! I didn’t have most of the ingredients it had bought a squash more than a week ago that I wanted to cook. No eggs, pine nuts, Parmesan, ginger, or garlic. Just basil, oatmeal, fish sauce, salt pepper, and spelt flour. I followed someone’s suggestion for times sake and just cut the squash into pieces and microwaved till mushy (20 minutes). My family was happy and I made enough rice to serve as a side dish. #lekker

This was quick and tasty.  I couldn't be bothered to roast the squash, so I microwaved it in a glass dish with a little water--only took 10 min.  I did sqeeze it out a bit, so it wasn't too watery.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it turned out great.
