Delicious! Substituted mixed veggies, and used leftover turkey. My whole family loved it. Thanks Tim! Just what I needed!

I really wanted to like this recipe, but it was just ok. I added 2 extra cloves of garlic, I used brown instead of white rice, I used mixed veggies instead of peas, I used less thyme and more salt and pepper and I was a bit heavy handed with the cheese. For me, the flavor was just not there. I do think that it would make a good base for a Broccoli Chicken Casserole.
