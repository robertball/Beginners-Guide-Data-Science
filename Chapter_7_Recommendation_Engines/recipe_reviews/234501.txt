I think I really prefer pasta with a sauce.  I used hot turkey Italian sausage and added about 1/2 white wine to the mushrooms as they simmered, and allowed the liquid to evaporate before moving on to the next step.  This needed some garlic, too, in my opinion.  It would have been very bland without the hot sausage.

Recipe Group Selection:  05, October 2013 ~ This was just ok for us.  Even adding the pasta water to the mix, it was kinda dry.  I sautéed poblano peppers in place of the mushrooms as we don't care for them.  We liked all the ingredients but just felt it was missing moisture.  Not sorry that I tried it, but was hoping for a little more flavor.

We just loved this recipe.  This recipe is a fast recipe to prepare on a busy night. I had done a couple of tweeks to this recipe.  I added onions and sub corn for peas.   For the cooking I also did a few changes.  In the Oil I sauted the onions and mushrooms for about 3 minutes then added the sausage meat.   Cooked until the meat was cooked through then added the corn.  When pasta was ready completed the recipe as written.   Will be doing this again.

Really loved this recipe...can't wait to eat the leftovers.  My wife added onion, garlic, and a can of diced tomatoes as well as some of  the pasta water.   Might qualify for one of our "go to" recipes in a pinch going forward.

I used turkey sausage and added about 1 cup of sliced onions and 1 cup mix of red and yellow peppers.  Those I sliced thinly and cut in half.  Before I started the mushrooms, I added about 1/2 tsp of Tumeric to the oil, then the mushrooms, salt and pepper to them.  After about 2 minutes I added the onions and peppers and gently mixed.  About 2 minutes I added the peas and after that I went back to recipe.  It is a big hit and will make again!

Made this for Recipe Group...We liked this, but I thought it was lacking in the flavor/'sauce' department. Maybe a little crushed pepper flakes to spice it up, and a splash or 2 of chicken broth to moisten it. I did like how simple it was to prepare and all of the ingredients used. I will play around w/ this more to suit our tastes. Thanks for sharing. :)
