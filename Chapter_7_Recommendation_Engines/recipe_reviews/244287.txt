Wow, I was hesitant to make this. It seemed like too many ingredients for my usual boring oatmeal but it was delicious! I didn't have bananas so I used blueberries. No strawberry jelly so I used a bit of grape (strawberry would have been better). I also added a bit of local honey. Great way to start the day with a healthy, easy recipe! Thank you for sharing it.

Wow this came out alot better than I thought it would. I thought it would come but out mushy and soupy but it didn't. My CORRECTIONS for this recipe; 1/4 cup raisins instead of 1/2 banana, 3/4 cup water instead of 1 cup, and 1.5 tbsp of blueberry jam.

I omitted the peanut butter. Maybe it was the greek yogurt I used but it wasn't my favorite. I will try different yogurt next time.

I made this for breakfast and thought that it tasted pretty good. I used Blackberry jelly instead of the strawberry because I had it on hand. Lots of protein in this meal.
