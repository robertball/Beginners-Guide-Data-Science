This is such a good pie! We found Saskatoons on a walk stopped and picked a full bag of them and went straight home and put them into this pie. Wouldn't change a thing.

I did not use the pastry just the pie filling part of this recipe. My family loved it. My husband said it was the best Saskatoon berry pie he had ever had.

Mmm Saskatoon pie!!! Increased the amount of water and berries slightly as we like a juicy pie! Everyone always raves!

Well I'd say this is a winner. We have a serviceberry tree and I was happy to learn that the berries are edible. We don't love crusts in my house so I made this with just the bottom crust using "No Roll Pie Crust I." Ifollowed the pie filling instructions closely. Easy. I would give it a 4 and thought it could maybe use some spice... cinnamon? nutmeg? My husband states it is his favorite berry pie he has ever had so I'll give it a 5. Went out today to pick the rest of the berries and will be making this pie again. Thanks shortcutie!
