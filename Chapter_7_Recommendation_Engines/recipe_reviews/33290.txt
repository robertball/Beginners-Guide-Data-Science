Finally a lowfat, sugarfree muffin that tastes like a muffin should! I made these twice this week. Using the 1/2cup wholewheat flour makes them nicer. Also I cut the sugar sub to 1/2cup using part slenda and part brown sugar twin. The last batch I added 2teaspoons of real sugar too. I find this makes the texture and taste better without affecting a diabetic at all. Instead of 2 egg whites, I used 1 whole egg. This still makes each muffin less than 1 gram of fat. Thanks for this recipe.

Hello? This recipe has the word "NUT" in the title, but there are no nuts whatsoever mentioned in the recipe. That's easily remedied, though - I threw in 1/3 cup chopped, toasted pecans and stuck one on the top of each muffin. They rose up beautifully, and tasted very good, but stuck to the paper liners terribly. I think the Splenda is the cause of this - when using another muffin recipe from the Splenda web site, the directions included spraying the paper liners with cooking oil spray. The papers come off the muffins perfectly. I will try this trick the next time I use this recipe.

I added 1/8 cup ground flax seed for fiber and moisture.  I could taste the Splenda, but it was not as strong the second day.  I would fix them again, but maybe try adding pumpkin instead of applesauce (0 points), some vanilla flavoring, even some fat free sugar free banana instant pudding.  Glad I tried the recipe.

These were EXCELLENT!! I've never been so pleased with a NO FAT, NO SUGAR recipe!!! I didn't tell the family they were "healthy", and they loved them!!! I added more banana then the recipe called for, only because I had 3 over-ripe bananas... oooohhh... so good!!! It would have probably been better with some wheat flour like the recipe suggests, but we didn't have any... but they were STILL REALLY great!!! Also, used egg beaters (1/2 cup) instead of two egg whites, just for convienance... egg beaters is pretty much just that - egg whites... plus some other stuff! :)

I didn't have Splenda so I used regular brown sugar and I also used the whole egg. I made these as mini-muffins for my son and he loved them. I will make these again.

When I run this recipe through the WW website's recipe-builder program it comes out 2 points per muffin. I tried calculating it for egg whites and Egg Beaters with added bran or no bran it always came up 2 points. And that's with no nuts. Far better than a sugar/butter/egg recipe but I don't know how others came out with 1 point per muffin.

Delicious. I made a few changes-- I used about 2 cups of mashed banana. I also added about 4 tablespoons sugar free vanilla pudding. I added it because the batter seemed dry before pouring it into the tin- the vanilla taste came through in the muffins. The muffins had lots of flavor- so good!

Made these today for my dad who is a diabetic. They were great. He loved them. My husband who is not a fan of artificial sweeteners actually said they were delicious, and asked me to make them for his crew at the firehouse. Moist and full of flavor. I did add about 1/2 c more bananas. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was quick and simple. I think these would be a great project for kids. I just suggest you make sure to spray the muffin tins well or use paper liners and spray them. No butter, no oil = stick like crazy.

These are great for those of us who count "points". I did have a slight problem with the muffin liners in that they stuck to the muffins. However, I found that after they had set a day, they peeled off fine.

They were dry and tasteless. There are better recipes out there that can be adapted to sugar-free, low fat versions. First of all, the applesauce, banana and egg are not enough moisture. Maybe a splash of milk would help. And as other reviewers have pointed out, where are the nuts! I'm sorry, but I don't believe diabetics have to give up flavor to have sugar-free baked goods. Try something else.

These were great!  I also used more banana to make them more moist - 3 full bananas.  I followed someone else's suggestion and added vanilla (great choice!)....finally, I added walnuts. 

Great recipe!

Great recipe, I gave them 5 stars because they are remorse free and they taste great compared to the almost no calories they have
I made my own apple sauce (Sarah's Applesauce) and used splenda instead of regular sugar, I guess that makes the muffins even more dietetic
I also sifted the dry ingredients because it gives more volume to the muffins
If you care a lot about your figure like I do, try them!!!!

With a couple of minor changes, this recipe came out delicious! I used bread flour in place of all-purpose (which I often do when recipes call for a mix with whole wheat flour), added another 1/4 c of applesauce, 2 tbsp brewers yeast, 2 tbsp milled flax seeds, and 1 tsp or so nutmeg. I also used one whole egg instead of the egg whites.  They were moist, fluffy and had a very satisfying flavor.

Great muffins! Made these for a friend who has to follow a cardiac diet. The only changes I made were adding a little vanilla and using all whole wheat flour. Yum! Friend loved them and so did all the nurses!

This recipe's title is a misnomer because there are no nuts in this??  I followed the recipe to the letter but did put a pecan on the top of each muffin.  The texture is somewhere between light and dense and just a little bit chewy.  Used two bananas, and they turned out plenty moist.  Next time, I think I'll cut back the Splenda a bit, maybe try 1/2 cup.  Honestly, I won't say that these are my favorite banana muffins, but I'm watching what I eat these days, and this is about as good as it gets nutritionally for a banana muffin.  For anybody doing the Weight Watchers Plus Program, this converts to 2 points (and that's EXCELLENT).  Enjoyed and will be making again.  Thanks Bridget.

These are a good low-cal option to get through those muffin cravings. However, while good, they are not "oh my gosh, amazing". I will make these again b/c of the good taste w/ lowcalories. My husband (picky eater) ate them and could not tell they were made with splenda :). I added extra applesauce to mine. I will make again.

Hmm, it's lacking in nuts, but it's easy enough to add ½ cup walnuts or pecans or whatever. :) I didn't have any whole wheat flour, so I used all AP. I also used 1/3 cup granulated sugar instead of Splenda, a whole egg instead of two whites, and I omitted the cinnamon (allergies in the house) and replaced it with two good shakes of nutmeg. I needed more like 1/3 cup of applesauce as the batter was too dry, but they were fabulous when done! I got 12 medium-sized muffins and 12 mini-muffins, which our three-year old loves. Very good, moist, and I was able to use up three very-overripe bananas (which is why I used so much less sugar). Thanks for sharing, Bridget! I'm on a low-fat diet right now and these muffins hit the spot!

I make these for my dad who is newly diagnosed as diabetic.  He loves them!  I make them for him when ever I visit and we freeze some so he can just take out 1 or 2 as he wants them without having to worry about "reading a label"

I used all white flour, cut back to 1/2 c. Splenda, used 3 bananas, and used Mott's Country Berry Applesauce. I did add a splash of milk because it was way too dry. I swirled a teaspoon of Smucker's low-sugar strawberry preserves into the top of each. Did not use liners, sprayed pan with Pam. These came out super moist and dense. They could definitely use some nuts for crunch but other than that they are really yummy! I recommend sprinkling the top with something-nuts, jam, choco chips because splenda doesn't brown and the muffins look unappealing. Plus, it gives it a little extra flavor!

Good for being healthy, a little chewy, and has a slight aftertaste of Splenda..which I don't really care for.

We enjoyed this with a few changes... first we used 3/4 cup of each whole wheat flour and all purpose flour, I added 1/2 cup of ground flax and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  I changed the sugar to 3/4 cup brown sugar and used 1 egg instead of 2 egg whites.  I would change the name to healthier...next time I will substitute honey for some of the sugar and maybe cut back on the sugar a bit.

These are really good and moist. I might experiment next time with adding a little more banana or a touch of brown sugar splenda; but I have to say, as is, it's a very good recipe.

Yum!  These are great!  I did add 2 tablespoons of miniature chocolate chips to the tops of the muffins which would add about 10 calories per muffin.  I love chocolate chip muffins but they are always so high in calorie, so it was great to find a muffin with such a low amount of calories that I can indulge my chocolate cravings!

These were the lightest muffins I have ever made, and I have made many.  I omitted the apple sauce and added one egg instead of two egg whites since I had none available.  They were absolutely delicious and very healthy. Definitely a five star keeper.

I used pumpkin in place of the bananas because it's in season right now, and these turned out great!  Very moist, not too sweet-- this is a great recipe for healthy muffins!

I am diabetic and always watch what I eat and these were SO delicious!  I added more bannannas and a 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of 1/4 cup because I LOVE moist bananna bread.  I also made it in a small cake pan instead of as muffins, it still turned out wonderful!  GREAT recipe!

awesome muffins! I made some changes to it based on some comments. I used 4 large bananas to add extra flavor and moisture, and about 3 or 4 teaspoons of vanilla. for convenience, I used Stevia instead of Splenda. I chopped up pecans to put in the muffins and put a whole pecan on top of each muffin. they were super moist and tasty! Everyone loved them!

I found the muffins to be a bit bland, despite having added 1 tsp vanilla, which the recipe dopes not call for. Next time, I will add 1/4 teaspoon or 1/2 teaspoon salt. I also found the muffins a bit tough. I don;t know if it was because of the whole wheat flour or because my 'wet' ingredients were not overly wet and I had to mix quite a bit to moisten the ingredients. The batter was much firmer than the batter in my other muffin recipes. Not sure what to do about that. Maybe add a touch of milk?  I will make the recipe again and tweak it a bit to see if they come out better next time.

What a great muffin! I used 1/3 cup white sugar because I had no splenda. I copied the ingredients down wrong and used only 1 cup flour (half reg. half wheat) and they turned out great! I used 3 bananas and added vanilla. Wonderfully moist!

Instead of Splenda (it gives me a headache) I used brown sugar as someone suggested before.  I also used more bananas (4 small very ripe ones) and added 1/2 cup of ground flax seed for fiber. And last but not least I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips for my daughter's benefit.  If there are chocolate chips in it she will eat it.

These are great if you're dieting, but if you want the real thing this isn't the recipe. I'm trying to lose a couple pounds and these diet friendly muffins hit the spot. They tasted good and satisfied my need for something sweet without the guilt. I did add 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and a 1/2 a cup of chopped walnuts. They're very good!

For "guilt-free" muffins these are great! For those expecting rich Starbucks banana nut muffins, keep dreaming... But these are very tasty fat-free muffins. I added chopped walnuts to the final mix, and they turned out delicious! Perfect with my morning coffee.

This is one of the best muffin recipes I have tried.  I used all wheat flour, added approx. 1/2 cup 1% milk, Splenda Brown Sugar instead of regular Splenda (reduce to 1/2 of white Splenda) also added 1 C Wheat Bran for more fiber.  Even with all these additions, they raised beautifically and are very moist.  they fit perfectly in Weight Watchers as they are 1 point each.

Wow! I never thought I'd find a low fat, low sugar, low calorie muffin recipe that tastes this great! It is just awesome! I added a few tablespoons of walnuts for some crunch and will try a few tablespoons of chocolate chips next time.

I love this recipe.  I use it over and over.  It reminds me of cupcakes my grandmother used to make.  I have made some changes.  Instead of 1 tsp. cinnamon I use 1/4 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice, and 1/4 tsp cloves to bring it closer to the flavor of my grandmother's cupcakes, and I increase to 1/2 cup applesauce for more moistness.

I just made these lastnight.  Huge hit!  Loved them.  Noticed that the nuts were omitted from the recipe.   I doubled the recipe as listed and added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  I filled greased muffin tins and filled them almost full - they rose perfectly for nice, big muffins.  This is my first attempt at baking with Splenda - pleasantly surprised.  This will definitely stay in my baking repetoire!  Mmmmmm mmmmmmm good.  :)

I made this with tips from other reviewers using 1/2 c applesauce, 1 tsp vanilla,  1/2 c vanilla pudding, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 4 large bananas, and I used all wheat flour only.   Baked beautifully in 15 mns. Delicious!

I did use all purpose flour for the whole thing because i did not have wheat and they came out amazing.I also used unsweetened applesauce, and added 1/2 cup crushed walnuts because they love nuts in their muffins  next time I will try the pecans. These were really moist and great flavor.

I was shocked, as I don't care for spenda, and a no fat, no sugar muffin seems too good to be true.  I used a reviewers advice and used 1 whole egg (as I'm cutting out sugar, not fat).  Husband loved these as well, so winner all around!  Next time I will add some nuts though!

These are great! I’m not diabetic, just wanted to find a healthy recipe for banana muffins and this one worked out well! The only issue I ran into was that after I had mixed all the ingredients together according to recipe, the batter was a bit dry and thick for a muffin batter. To combat this, I added an extra banana and a few tablespoons of vegetable oil and that did the trick. The muffins cooked perfectly right at 15 minutes and are delicious!

I just made this, some with walnuts and some without, since my husband is allergic to walnuts. He really likes them. I did use Splenda for 1/2 of the sugar and then applesauce for the other 1/2 amount. Although it did not brown, they turned out really great. I don't know why they did not brown but maybe it was the applesauce.

I used this recipe to make a sugar-free banana bread for my husband, who is a diabetic. I tried many recipes, and this one is by far the best. Not too sweet, with nice texture. Baked it for 50 min at 350 F.

These muffins are AMAZING!!! The only change I made was adding some crushed pineapple (rinsed) to the mix. They are so moist! It's hard to believe they are so good for you. This will definitely become a regular in my house! Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

My mom is a diabetic and cannot stand sugar free anything. She absolutely loved these muffins. As did the rest of our family.  I used a few of the other suggestions and used all regular flour, whole eggs ( which took care of the dryness in the batter) and I added vanilla extract & chopped pecans.

Really like these, especially low carb and calories. I substituted 3/4 cup white flour and 3/4 cup fine whole wheat flour and used yellow raisins, no nuts. Delicious!

I used all whole wheat flour and add 1/2 teaspoon or so of lemon extract and walnuts.  The lemon gave them a little zip.

I love this recipe! Nice and fluffy and moist! I substitute some Stevia packets for the Sucralose/Splenda recommendation and add a little more flour.  It always turns out great! 

Sometimes I mix it up by adding mashed mango to the applesauce, or by mixing in nuts, berries, or coconut flakes.  I've made the recipe as muffins and as a banana nut bread and both are great! 

Finally a healthy muffin recipe that doesn't taste like dried cardboard!

Excellent.  These muffins are delicious.  I used cinnamon Applesauce in both the muffins and topping.  The topping recipe came from Lighter Banana Crumb Muffins submitted by aradi.  To the batter I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and 3/4 tsp. cinnamon as suggested by another reviewer.  Don't add too much batter to the muffin tin or the topping will overflow.

This was a great recipe. I used oat flour as that was all I had. Will try it again with a gluten free flour. I had made my own organic applesauce and knew that it was very sweet so I cut the sweetener to 1/4 cup.

I made these for my papa who is diabetic, and he loved them. He shared with his diabetic neighbor, and she requested I make them for her as well. I used pureed apple instead of apple sauce to save from the added sugars. They love them! I also make them in mini size so they are smaller portions, and they don't feel guilty when they reach for 2.. or 3. ;)

I didn't have all of the recommended ingredients like the wheat flour so I'm giving the exact recipe the benefit of the doubt with the 4-star rating. Some of the changes I made the second time around included using 3 bananas (making about a cup and a half mashed), about 3/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce, a generous splash of skim milk, and about 1 1/5 tablespoons of honey. Also used the full eggs and tossed in about 3/4 cup of chopped walnuts. They came out great, though, and I think are still satisfactorily "low-fat".

Not sure how anyone can find fault with this recipe. I didn't have whole wheat flour, so I used regular all-purpose flour and 2 cups of bananas.  I also added 2 tablespoons of light brown sugar, walnuts, and dried cranberries.  These muffins are AWESOME!  Eating one as I type and will definitely make again.

Really good!  After reading most of the reviews I decided to add an extra banana and also a tablespoon of sugar free instant vanilla pudding.  I also used 1/4 cup of regular brown sugar in place of 1/4 cup of the sugar substitute.  They turned out very moist and flavorful, but not too sweet.  That is a good thing and I will definitely make these again.  Thanks for sharing!

I've, too, made this with three bananas, and added a tablespoon of splenda brown sugar mix and 1/4 cup of chocolate chips - making it just low-sugar and low-fat. It was a hit and a few hours later we just have 6 muffins left. I suggest adding 1 tsp of salt. Great recipe and very easy to make!

I substituted the whole wheat flour for soy flour, and half of the all-purpose with stoneground kamut flour, added extra apple sauce and banana and it turned out pretty good! I think my substitutions (and omitted cinnamon cause i was out of it) affected the taste (4/5 if I hadn't substituted), and next time I'll add more spices and sweetner. Great recipe if you want something that's actually healthy for u...

Theses were great! My husband and I loved them, especially for a healthful muffin.  Instead of 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour, I used 3/4 cup of each.  Also, I use whole-wheat pastry flour when baking. . . it turns out much better than whole-wheat flour.  I will be making these often!

I followed the recipe exactly, and they turned out great! For a moment I thought I could detect a slight Splenda aftertaste, but then I decided if it was there, it was so minute that it didn't matter. Great recipe!

Only had white flour, increased banana to 1-1/4 cups, 1/2 cup chunky applesauce.  Entire family liked the taste.  Paper liners hard to remove, even after waiting a day.  Will use sprayed tins next time. Good enough I'm making another batch for a friend!

These muffins are amazing!  I made them without telling my husband what was in them.  One bite and I knew he was very happy with the results - only then did I tell him.  He said he was going to get the butter before he took a bite (he normally slathers on a thick layer on my banana bread - maybe that's not a good thing!) but he said these didn't need them.  They were very moist.  The only changes I made were to increase the applesause to 1/2 cup since I was a little short on the banana, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon & 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg and before baking, I sprinkled a little Splenda Brown Sugar on top of the muffins.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Not the best banana bread I've ever had, but it is the best one-point banana bread I've ever had.  I agree with adding the vanilla and I used egg substitute instead of just egg whites. I will definately make this again.

I made the 4 mini loaves. They were delicious! They were very moist. I was not sure what flax meal was, so I used ground up flax seeds. I also substituted the equal sugar blend that I had on hand.

These were okay.  I am normally all for low-sugar, fat-free things, but I was a little bit disappointed with these.  I used fat-free yogurt instead of applesauce per another reviewer's suggestions and also added 1 tsp. of vanilla.  The first muffin I had was still warm and was pretty good, but after they cooled they took on a somewhat strange consistency.  Still somewhat tasty and definitely edible, but just an overall disappointment for huge banana bread lovers like myself!  Sometimes the end result is worth the small amount of fat/calories.  Thanks for a great alternative, though!

These were much better than I was expecting!  Very moist and have great banana flavor - I made as is except I added a teaspoon of vanilla for flavor and I'm glad I did.  I also used Splenda sugar blend instead of 100% Splenda and sprikled some chopped walnuts on top before baking.  Yum!

This recipe is fantastic.  My 2 year old (who won't eat anything!) even loves them.  For a little added extra I added 1/4 cup chopped walnuts.  My son isn't a diabetic but I wanted to keep away from the more sugary muffins, even so I  added a little white chocolate chip just for interest and he loved that even more.  The mango-peach applesauce is a great suggestion.  Thanks for this recipe.

The muffins turned out well but I guessed at to what I was to do with the eggs before adding them.  Must have guessed correctly that they were to be beaten before adding to dry ingred.
What quantity of nuts?  I substitued raisins.
