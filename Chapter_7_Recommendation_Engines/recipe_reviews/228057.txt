I didn't do the final part with the milk or use bouillon cubes. Still tasty!

I added more garlic than the recipe called for and did not add the milk because I used an additional 1/4c of butter.  However, it was delicious!

First time I ever made greens and wow! What a delicious recipe! If you’ve never made collard greens before I recommend going to YouTube for a demo of proper preparation.

Excellent dish. Added some crushed red pepper to the mix and it helped add a little spice.

I found this recipe a few months ago and my husband LOVES them!  I make them about 2-3 times per month.  We even have friends that show up just to have greens!!!!
