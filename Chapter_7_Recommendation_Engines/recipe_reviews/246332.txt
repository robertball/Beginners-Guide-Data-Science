Excellent! I scaled the spices for a 2-1/2 lb. roast and added 1 tsp. coriander per a friend's recommendation. The seasonings were spot on! I have an electric pressure cooker, The Instant Pot and I seared the meat in the pot prior to setting on high pressure for 45 minutes. Perfection! The meat was very tender and shredded easily. I decided to place the shredded meat in a frying pan with some hot lard to crisp it up just a bit before adding to flour tortillas with a few toppings. Loved the flavor and ease of this recipe! And loved how quick the pressure cooker was at tenderizing the meat. I will definitely make this again!

Can I give this 10 stars instead??? This was my 1st ever attempt at carnitas, but I have always wanted to try them. It was just my husband & I to eat them so I quartered a 5 lb Boston butt and adjusted the spices. I did add ground coriander as others suggested. And I used Mexican oregano (just because I had it on hand). I upped the orange juice to a cup (was afraid it wouldn't be enough liquid), I didn't think about the juices fromy the roast. I put it in my Instant Pot for 40 minutes with a NPR. WONDERFUL!! I served it shredded on a corn tortillas with diced onion & cilantro. JUST LIKE A MEXICAN FOOD TRUCK!!!

Holy Cow!  This was great and so easy!  This was my first meal made with my Instant Pot.  I have to admit I was scared of the thing, but I had this big pork roast sitting on the counter and the guys were coming home in an hour so I surged ahead.  Instead of cubing the meat I just sliced it up into 2 inch slabs, rubbed on the spices, jammed them in the pot, poured over the rest of the ingredients, followed the IP directions (I set it for 55 minutes).  The meat shredded itself.  So tasty - even better than doing in the slow cooker.  So impressed - I will be making this recipe again and again!  Thanks!

My review keeps getting entered before I'm finished. This was EXCELLENT. First time making carnitas and first time using my instant pot. I marinated the pork cubes in the orange juice and spices overnight in the fridge in a gallon ziploc bag. I put the pork in the pot, 1 cup of lime juice on top because I needed more liquid and that's what I had- plus I knew the flavor a would work well- then I added the onion and garlic on top and set my pot for 45 minutes. Mine does not have high or low pressure settings. It also doesn't have a NPR setting so I just closed the steam vent before starting and waited for the float valve to sink down. (Took about 20 minutes.) The pork was ridiculously moist and flavorful. I made a spicy radish cilantro salsa to go on top and some paleo tortillas (made with plantains and tapioca starch)  I make a lot of different recipes from apps, cooking sites and cookbooks, and a lot of them are really good, but this is one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten. Thank you for this recipe.

This was fantastic!   The pork was fall apart tender and the most moist pork shoulder I have ever had.  I made the spice blend as is with the addition of 1-1/2 tsp. of ground coriander and only 1 tbsp. of salt.  I let the spice rub sit on the pork for about 15 minutes, set the pressure cooker to brown and seared the pork in batches to get a nice crust.  I then added all the pork into the pressure cooker with the onions, garlic and orange juice.  I set the pressure cooker for 40 minutes and was glad I did because the pork was perfectly cooked at 40 minutes.   I served the carnitas with homemade pico de gallo, shredded lettuce, sour cream, & a squeeze of lime.   I will definitely be making this again in the future!  Thanks for the recipe!

Amazing ! Had a 3 lb roast so pulled back on the spices a little bit (but not half).  Cooked for 45 in Instant Pot -- the best carnitas I've ever had.   Tip: Fry up your shredded meat in a pan after cooking - gives you crispy bits and tender bits in every bite.

The spices were great but got lost in the juices created during pressure cooking. A cup of orange juice is to much liquid. I have a instant pot which allowed me to sauté the meet prior to pressure cooking. I set the timer for 1 hour on the manual setting and allowed to to naturally release pressure. I would recommend draining the liquid adding additional seasoning then  sautéing the meet for added flavor.

Gulp...used my pressure cooker. (Why am I so nervous about that thing?). Excellent recipe. Added coriander per other reviews and a bit of chipotle pepper, more garlic. . Tender. Juicy and very flavorful.

I used a bone-in pork shoulder, trimmed the fat, removed the bone, and cut into large cubes. I doubled the recipe and wish I wouldn't have doubled the salt. It was almost too much.  Luckily the rice and beans helped negate some of the saltiness. 
The first night, we made burritos. We had so much left over that we made burrito bowls for freezer meals/lunch. 
I made this in my Instant Pot. I used the manual setting for 40 minutes with 10 minutes NPR. It was absolutely fall-apart tender and delicious. I will definitely make it again and again.

Very good, I made it just like the recipe instructed but i also placed the shredded pork on a greased baking pan and broiled it on low for about 10 minutes.

This was delicious, my whole family loved it! I made it exactly like the recipe says and served with some cilantro lime rice. The only thing I'd change for next time, is maybe shredding it a little less. Carnitas are supposed to use a little bit chunkier meat, rather then shredded.

Was our first time trying Carnitas and it was the best carnitas any one in our family had ever had. Excellent recipe. Definitely going into my favorites list. I made it as is, I'm not one of those who has to change up everything I see and say "oh it would be better this way or this way or that way." I just made it as is, and it was fantastic. Thank you for the recipe.

My husband and I enjoy plenty of flavor, I added extra cumin, chili powder, and garlic. I also used a citrus ipa beer instead of orange juice. It turned out great! We hosted a dinner and everyone enjoyed!

I normally don’t give reviews but I have to on this.  We used a slightly smaller pork roast (~4 lbs) but followed the rest of ingredients to a “t”.  Outstanding recipe!  You have to try it!

Flavorful, tender and juicy. A perfect recipe for my Instant Pot. This will go into my regular rotation. For added flavor and texture crisp up the carnitas in a pan. I did cut way back on the salt and used garlic salt.

Loved this! I scaled this down for a 3 lb. butt roast and added 1 tsp. a ground coriander. I made this in my InstantPot, browning the meat a bit using the saute function before sealing and pressure cooking for 50 minutes. There was quite a bit of liquid in the pot when the pressure came down, which I ended up draining off before shredding. The flavors were delicious! I loved how the spices were subtle enough to know that they are there, but not so powerful that it took away from the pork itself. We ate this on corn tortillas and topped them with diced onion, tomatoes, cilantro, queso fresco and salsa verde. Yum!

Wonderful Flavour!!!!
I cut back the salt to one & half teaspoons  for a 3lb. Roast. It was the perfect amount. 
This recipe is quick and easy to make, I use my pressure cooker on top of the stove and it turned out perfectly.
I serve them this the  traditional way they do in Mexico with chopped white onion to put on top & pieces of lime to squeeze over the onion. Salsa on the side as well.  We used the smallest size tortilla.
My adult family loved this recipe !
I also served these with Mexican Bean Salad  post on this site by Karen Castle. It was hit as well
I will make this again, and again!!!!

Ridiculous how wonderful this was. I seared the pork cubes first in the Instant Pot before setting it on pressure. I actually messed up at first, forgetting to add the OJ and onions/garlic until 30 minutes after it started pressure cooking. Manually released the pressure, threw it in and resumed pressure cooking for another 20 minutes. It was still delicious and tender (hardly had to shred the pork, it just crumbled on its own).

So good, easy to make and tweak. We made extra and left overs are just as good.

Recommend browning in a fry pan for that extra crisp.

This is my new go-to potluck dish.  Took it for a basketball team dinner and the boys loved it!  I agree about the coriander during cooking.  I also garnished with fresh cilantro.  Then I stuck it in a really hot oven for 10 minutes to add crispy bits.

I made this last night and it was so perfect! The only addition I made was adding a green pepper and I used a little less salt just because we don't like a lot of salt flavor. These were the best wraps I have ever made and the best success in my pressure cooker so far. We just added some sour cream, freshly grated cheese, and my how grown/canned salsa to the tortilla wraps and had rice and beans as sides and it was an outstanding meal!

Made it with just 2 pounds of pork shoulder, but kept the 1 cup OJ for the pressure to build up enough and maybe 2/3 of the spices. Set it to 30 min of pressure, and came out great.  There's a lot of liquid left over, but I will use it as a base for soup.

I have never made carnitas before and was quite worried. I was pleasantly surprised to say. The pork came out so tender and juicy. So succulent. I followed other users' comments and added a tsp of coriander. Was not disappointed.

While the pork turned out very tender, there was absolutely no flavor at all to this and I followed the recipe exactly as written. I’ll have to zhoozh it up somehow as to not waste a good piece of meat.

DELISH!!  Made as recipe states with addition of about 1 tsp whole coriander seed in the mix.  Cooked in Instant Pot on High Pressure for 55mins.  Crisped up on stove top, served with warmed corn tortillas, cilantro, cheese, and sour cream.  PERFECT!!

This was soooooooo good and super easy to do in the instant pot. I would never have made this without owning one of those things. I made copycat chipotle burrito bowls with it and street tacos. SOOOOO GOOD

made half recipe, using country style pork ribs,  added some coriander as others did. The spice mix is heavenly. Browned the meat and added all the rest. Next time I will cook a little less but I will definitely make again. Was delicious! Thank you

I've been wanting to try to make pork Carnitas for a while. Even went out and bought a pressure cooker so I could make it. I tried this recipe and it came out absolutely wonderful. The only thing is, I didn't have any chili powder so I substituted Cayanne powder, which gave it a little bit of a space. But, still very good. I'm sure if I had chili powder it would've tasted exactly as I expected. Looking forward to trying this recipe again.

What a wonderful and yummy change of pace for pork.  I sliced a pork loin for this recipe and served it with oven fried potatoes and salad.  It was great.   I did add the cumin.

I followed the recipe only scaled to 3lbs of pork and added poblano, jalapeno and hot banana peppers.  I used a large old fashioned pressure cooker and was afraid i didn't have enough liquid so I shortened cooking time to 30 mins and it was perfect.  Really enjoyed it and next time I will use 6 lbs of pork because the leftovers will be great.  Saved the liquid to make gravy next day.  Thanks for a tasty treat.

This was delicious. We used dried minced onions instead of fresh b/c that's all we had.  I also added dried cilantro, per another reviewer's suggestion.  I've never had street tacos, so I can' t compare, but these were definitely a unique and wonderful taste.  I will definitely make these again.

This was soo delicious.  Everyone in the family loved it, kids included.  The changes I made: added 1 tsp coriander, 1.5 cups OJ, and didn't have an onion so added the ends of 4 green onions that I had, and threw in 2 Anaheim peppers whole that I had.  I have an instant pot and set it on high pressure for 60 minutes, with 15 minutes of natural release.  Pair it with a homemade salsa, cilantro, crema, rice and beans and tortillas.  Soo good that I am making it again later this week for company.  Thank you for this super easy and delicious dinner that I didn't have to slave away in the kitchen for.  Absolutely love it!

Added a little extra orange juice as I was concerned about the amount of fluid with a pressure cooker ( don't use often).  It was fine.  Probably was fine as written.  Tasted great. Made tacos tonight the leftovers will be BBQ sandwiches tomorrow. I will keep this recipe.  This made me really appreciate my pressure cooker: carnitas in an hour-woot!

The pork was fork tender and so flavorful. I  halved the recipe as I had a roast that was just under 3 lbs. The seasonings were perfect. The only changes I made were that I juiced two navel oranges and added the juice and three of the halves to the pot as well as using fresh oregano instead of dried, as that was what I had on hand. I made it in the Instant Pot, cooking for 60 minutes on high pressure, allowing it to release naturally for 12 mins. and then quick releasing. Even my picky kiddos gobbled it down.

Cut an almost four pound butt into 1-3 inch pieces keeping all the lovely fat on; cooked only 45 minutes  under pressure with only spices and a squirt of lime juice. After 15 minutes of depressurization I added diced onion and simmered out the remaining water for 20 minutes leaving a wonderfully rich and flavorful pork that shredded easily by mere stirring. No need to crisp in the oven.
The seasonings are subtle - hold back on the salt. The pastured pork flavor and mouthfeel are sublime. I served it in tortillas with some pickled red onion, roasted diced poblano, and crumbled feta.

i had a 3 lb pork butt so I halved all the seasonings except chile and the orange juice. The 1/2 t chile seems really light anyway. I used a gallon ziplock to "rub the pork with the seasonings" and oiled in the same bag after that. I browned my pork chunks before adding the juice and cooking. I added 3/4 t coriander per other reviews. Like others I broiled it afterwards for a bit leaving the juices in the pressure cooker. Good and very easy. I also only cooked 45 minutes since it was a smaller roast.

This is so good! I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of transferring the meat onto a sheet pan after shredding and broiling for a few minutes to get some crunch.

It was my first time cooking pork butt. The meat turned out incredibly TENDER! I really liked the seasoning + a tsp of coriander. I did not add orange juice as I like to cook healthily and avoid unnecessary sugars. Instead of orange juice, I added a cup of water (which ended up a lot because the meat produced a lot of juices). I also sautéed the meat and onion before pressurizing it to bring out the flavors. The meat tastes absolutely delicious! My husband liked it a lot as well.

All I changed was using concentrated lemon and lime, since I forgot to pickup orange juice from the grocery store. This is awesome and I’ll be making it again.

I made this recipe exactly like it is written by the author. The pork was very tender and tasty. The pork goes well in burrito tortillas, in taco shells, on tostadas, etc.

Didn't make any changes, I am going to try to pan fry the results of this and see if I can get it crispy, the flavor is good, though next time I might add a little more spice (maybe some red pepper).  Overall, quite tasty!

IF MAKING IN A TRADITIONAL PRESSURE COOKER, BE SURE TO ADD QUITE A BIT OF WATER OR IT WILL BURN. It burned twice on me. Despite a slightly burnt taste,it was good. If it hadn’t burned, I probably could have rated the recipe as 5 stars.

Would have given 5 stars but it is WAY WAY too much salt.  Really only need a teaspoon or two for this amount of meat.  I used less orange juice so the liquid wouldn't overwhelm the meat, but otherwise the flavors were great.  Serve with tortillas, seasoned black beans, rice and homemade pico for a great meal.

I will make this one again! It was a hit at our NYE party this year. I did change the orange juice for chicken broth, and I also seared the pieces of pork in the instant pot first. After searing I added enough broth to whisk the bits off the pan, added the meat, then onions and garlic, then remainder of the broth. I turn it all a bit then cooked as prescribed. It was very good!

We loved it for both Lumpia meat and Enchilada Meat.  I feel that we could have left the liquid in the Instant Pot and used it for a 2nd batch, as the smell of the orange juice was great.

I’ve belonged to Allrecipes for years and never written a review, but I feel I must with this one- it was absolutely amazing. I followed the recipe exactly, but did shorten the time to 50 minutes with a 15 minute natural release. Also- the one thing I feel is a must- line a baking sheet with foil, spray with nonstick cooking spray, then shred your pork on the baking sheet (removing any icky fatty pieces). Sprinkle about 1/4 cup of cooking juices on top. Broil on high in your oven for about five minutes. Turn or stir around, then broil a few minutes more. Gives the pork those nice crispy edges.

I had a 3lb pork shoulder so I used half the recommended amount of spices and orange juice. I cooked for an hour and that’s it. It is juicy, flavorful and shredded super easy. This is only my second time using my instantpot and I am so happy with this.

This was AWESOME!! I made this just like the recipe. I did use a bone in pork  butt roast. I trimmed the meat off the bone as close as possible, and added the bone to the instant pot  The sauce came out wonderful.

This recipe is amazing for creating carnitas in an instant pot in just an hour and change... if you make one small change!!  I was pretty disappointed when I opened the pot and discovered the chunks of pork were so soft and wet... but I put them on a baking sheet with a drizzle of pork fat, put it in the oven under the broiler for a few minutes on each side and got the most tasty, crispy, mouth watering, carnitas!! They are to die for!!  No added seasonings needed, just use pork lard (like real carnitas) and broil them until crispy.  My husband is in love with me all over again.  Lol!

I have an instant pot and I seared the meat and onions first.  Also following someone’s recommendation I only put half cup of oj . I used smoked paprika and part Mexican oregano with oregano since I had it on hand. And I drained the liquid but saved the juice to moisten the carnitas after broiling it and putting it back on warm. Served on soft white corn tortillas that I warmed, wrapped in foil and stored on top of the carnitas in my instant pot to keep warm and soft.  Had onions, cilantro, lime juice (mixed),  chopped jalapeños, and salsa verde on the side...used pork shoulder with fat trimmed.

I followed the recipe, however I doubled the seasonings amounts for more flavor. I felt 1 cup of orange juice was too much liquid, will use less next time. After cooking the meat in a pressure cooker for an hour, I fried it until crispy in a cast-iron skillet and added a tad more spices. Delicious! Freezes well and a easy meal to cook before camping.

This is a great method and recipe, but there should have been one more step added! Carnitas are crisped up after cooking, so you get two different textures, moist and crispy! So after cooking take drained and shredded meat and place under broiler for about two minutes then baste with pots juices. Do this several times till meat crisps up. There is such a difference when you do this, try it.

This is now a go to in our home!! The only extra step I take is to throw in in a pan under the broiler until a crispy crust forms. About 5-7 minutes.

I actually cooked mine in the slow cooker for 8 hours. I used all the ingredients in the recipe though and my whole house smelled amazing when I got home. After shredding (which only took some stirring with a spoon because it was so tender) I fried the meat with some olive oil. I also have a gas stove top and toasted my tortilla shells by putting them directly over the flame for about 10 seconds per side. I then topped my tacos with salsa verde, fresh pineapple, red onion, and cilantro and it was great! My husband said it tasted like something our favorite taco place would have. Will definitely make again!

I've made this several times + find it needs a little less cooking time in my Instant Pot than written. It's perfect every time!

I don’t think it’s necessary to cook for 60 mts.  I did a 4 lb butt for 35 mts plus 15 minute NPR.  Very tender.  For anyone complaining about too much liquid, you must add liquid for cooking and then the meat releases its juices.  Once cooked, use tongs to remove the meat from the liquid (and separate from fat) and as others have said, crisp and brown in the oven on low broil or a high heat.   Delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

I cut the recipe in half for a 3 lb pork shoulder. I would add a little more salt, but threw in more garlic! It was sooo tender after I used it in the IP for 30 min with natural release. So quick and delicious!

My family loved this recipe! I used bacon grease instead of the olive oil, added a couple chopped jalapenos, and broiled the shredded pork a few minutes to caramelize.

Made it and it’s phenomenal. Might I suggest once it’s done, turn the broiler on the oven and put it in. It’ll crisp up the pork and give it a little crunch. You’ll enjoy it trust me

I have made this recipe....and shared it MANY times.  I just add salt to the level I think is good, as 1.5 T seems like a lot.  Tonight I used Lime juice in place of orange because of a food allergy....I didnt think they could be better....but they were!!  GREAT RECIPE!!

Turned out well, I didn't cook it in a pressure cooker but in a crockpot so I ended up shredding the meat after it cooked overnight  so it was a bit different.  Everyone really liked it though.  I looked up online about different types of toppings and found one that was really well-received which was chopped red onion soaked in lime juice with a little salt and sugar.  Also had caramelized onions mixed with peppers, queso fresco,  guacamole, a tomatillo salsa, and served rice and beans on the side (although some people put  the beans in the tacos as well).

I made this with a 6lb pork shoulder in my Instant Pot and it was absolutely perfect! Just enough spice for most people. I actually like my foods extremely spicy so when I added it to my tortillas I also added some homemade habañero salsa along with a small dollop of sour cream. Excellent!

I couldn't believe how delicious this was.  I hadn't made pork in my pressure cooker before this one so I was skeptical, but it turned out moist, tender and very flavorful.  I think I upped a couple of the seasonings because I like a little bit stronger cumin flavor and such, but that was my personal taste.  This is a great recipe that I've already shared with others and will be using again in the future.    A couple days after I made this and ate it with slaw on corn tortillas, I made the leftover pork into carnitas tortilla soup.  Also DELISH!!

This was a hit with the entire family. We did a 3 lb. roast in the InstaPot for 40 minutes. Delicious! We will be making it again. For toppings, we had sour cream, queso fresco, cilantro, limes, and salsa. Everybody was happy.

Added the coriander, lessened the salt to two teaspoons. The rest as in the recipe. Delicious! Spice was spot on! Tender, juicy, easy, This has been added to my favorites and will be used both for just family dinners and for parties!

After cooking, it was watery, so I added some sundried tomatoes and set cooker to stew for 20 minutes with top part way off. That reduced the liquid and made the pork much more flavorful.

OK, y'all. This is a great recipe, but I have some tips to make it even better without changing  the basic flavor and ease of it, which is great.  I cut up  the  raw Boston butt into chunks. In removing the excess fat, I saved some of the larger chunks/small slabs of this fat. I seasoned the meat chunks as per the recipe directions;  IF YOU HAVE A PRESSURE COOKER OR INSTANT POT., just put the meat in after seasoning (no browning). Set the instant pot to cook 35 mins, HI setting). Meanwhile, put the fat pieces in a large iron skillet on the stove set to low and let those pieces of fat slowly render off their fat, getting much smaller and crispy.  After an hour or so with intermittent turning , take them off and season them with taco seasoning (but u could use anything), after draining pressing out residual fat on paper towels. Nice appetizer. Once the carnitas meat was done, I put it into the same iron skillet I'd used to create these crispy treats, turned up the heat, and crisped it up. Easy  and delicious!

Perfect as is! I sauteed the meat for a few minutes first in the Instant Pot before pressure cooking on high for 45 minutes and letting it vent naturally. I've never had such tender meat! These were amazing and so easy!

Outstanding. I didn’t have a true Boston Butt, but did have 5 lbs of Country Style Ibs, often cut from the butt..... amazed how tender and flavorful the meat was.... will be part of the regular rotation.

I’ve made this recipe at least 5 times in the last 2 months for gatherings. Everyone loves the meat!  I make a “burrito bar” with black beans, red onion and cilantro and rice. I also make pico de gallo, lettuce and all sorts of toppings. Easy to make and always a crowd pleaser!

Heavenly! My pork shoulder was 4.5 lb. I added a tsp of coriander powder. I put cinnamon barks instead of ground cinnamon. I was worried that there won’t be enough broth but I was wrong. When it’s done, there was a lot of juice coming out of the pork.

These were amazing, the pork came out tender and delicious.  I will use less OJ next time as they were a little soupy, but I used an Instant Pot and was able to sauce some of the extra juice out.  Will definitely make again!

Excellent flavor and so easy to shred. A little too juicy but easy to strain off the excess if using in tortilla.

This recipe is so simple and amazing. I have made so many mediocre pork recipes in the crock pot/pressure cooker and this one blew them all out of the water. I did but the recipe in half because there are only two people in my household, but it worked out perfectly. This is perfect to use in tacos, burritos or burrito bowls. Even my husband can’t stop raving about it.

This is my favorite carnitas recipe,made it 3 times now, and have fine-tuned it to our preferences. The salt can be decreased to 1 Tbsp as it is a bit salty for us. Otherwise the spices and seasonings are perfect, but if you like it more intense, increase by using 1.5 times the written amounts. I don’t own an instant pot, so I use my pressure canner. Today I used 50 min. For 8 lbs. of pork butt, then let it sit for 20 min. The pork literally fell apart, and was so delicious! If you’re happier with fork-pulling the pork apart, decrease the cook time to 40 min.

This recipe rocks!  Made this in a stove top pressure cooker.  So much better than using a slow cooker. The only adjustment I made was to add a tsp of ground coriander.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Just made this for dinner tonight. I only had a 3 lb roast, so I cut the time to half. It was very good and there’s enough  for another dinner tomorrow night   This is the first recipe I used for the instant pot and I’m loving it

Super super super EASY RECIPE! My husband literally stopped speaking and then said how great it was. He kept saying how great it was and I was floating on cloud 9 lol. I will try adding the coriander powder next time to see how much of a difference it makes. Wonderful recipe!

I followed the recipe pretty much.
It came out great. What I should've done was shred it  and soaking in the liquid more, just prior to serving.

Delicious and versatile! My family devoured this in the form of tacos the first night, quesadillas the next night, and then I added our favorite BBQ sauce to polish it off the last night. So tender!!! I broiled it on low for 6-8 minutes after shredding, to give a desirable texture and pull a little moisture out since it's so juicy. Other comments are correct: Trust the 1 c. orange juice quantity--it's enough.

Made this last night and got rave reviews from the family.  Served with lettuce, tomato, cheese, salsa, guacamole salsa, and some sour cream on flour tortillas.

We will be having this again.  Thanks for sharing, I am looking for different meals to make in my new pressure cooker and this one was perfect.

AMAZING!  I think I may add just a bit more cumin and chile pepper next time, but there will most definitely be a next time! So tasty and smelled delicious. Couldn't wait to get into it! Served in flour tortillas with fresh Pico de Gallo, shredded lettuce, a bit of mexican sheese and a dollop of sour cream. Leftovers were as good as first day if not better. Wish I had more now!!!

Made this for my husband and my son. They ate all of it. There was no talking at the table. I think next time ill use just a little less orange juice. It had a lot of liquid in it. This was so easy to make.

This is a great recipe.  Remember to use 1 cup liquid in a 6Qt pressure cooker, HOWEVER, use a minimum of 1 3/4 to 2 cups liquid in your 8Qt. size pressure cooker, as per manufacturer's instructions. This allows for proper build-up of pressure inside while in use.

Awesome recipe. The only thing I added was the coriander. My roast was just under 4 lbs so I browned it first and cooked it for 40 minutes. It was perfect. Flavor outstanding. I served it with fresh Pico de Gallo, Spanish rice, retried beans. I had avocado slices, cilantro, jalapeño peppers, lime slices and pepper jack cheese for toppings. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make again.

Very good.  I'm not a big fan of pork roast, but I this recipe works for me.  I use to can and freeze pork roast .  It's great to have on hand for when you don't feel like cooking to make enchiladas or burritos etc.

This meal was good, but way too salty for my palate. In the future I would cut the salt to half and at least double the other spices except the oregano.

I make this recipe often. I love the balance of flavors with this spice blend. I add more garlic, though.

So yummy! I had a 9lb pork butt and followed instructions for rub. I did not have oregano so used basil. I was on the fence about time, not sure if I should do 45min or 60 min.  I went with 50 min and did 15 natural release. I did cut the butt into chunks, was recommended on other sites. It was perfect! The fat from pork creates a lot of liquid so no worries there. Oh, and the tip about broiling the carnitas was on point! Nice crispiness! Being Latina I may double the seasonings next time round and let it sit in refrigerator for a day to marinate!! So easy and yummy! thanks Jennifer

Used 4 lbs of pork roast, kept the onions, broth, OJ, and spices the same (except cut the salt more than half). Cooked with InstaPot (R) 40 min.  Portioned out 2 servings and pan seared it without the liquid.  Saved the rest. Served with homemade Mexican rice, pinto beans and salsa cruda. So good!

I have made this recipe many times! The meat is so tender and delicious. So much flavor. I use a 8-10 lb bone in butt roast. I only put in the the instant pot for about 45 minutes. I usually double the seasonings.

I halved the recipe and it worked well.  Easy, quick, but not as authentic tasting as I'd hoped but my proportions might have been off as it did seem to have more liquid than I expected.  I did put it on a cookie sheet under the broiler to crisp up and it was fantastic! I'll make again though I might increase the seasoning/decrease the liquid.

This was great!  Tried a few pressure cooker carnitas, but so far this has been the best.  It's simple and we love it.  I was generous with the spice amounts and I make a green Jalapeno salsa to accompany these tacos but the pork comes out amazing!

So delicious! I made it following the recipe exactly and it was so good! Even my finickiest eater ate six street tacos with carnitas even when there were other proteins available like shredded chicken, picadillo, and fish. A big hit. I'll make this again and again, and I might also try it as my next potluck contribution!

This was delicious!  My family loved it.  I made cilantro/lime rice with it to add the option to put it over rice or on tortillas.  My family went back for thirds!  

I didn't have orange juice so substituted apple juice.  I also reduced the salt based on some comments on here.  Definitely will make again!!

The most simple yet tasty carnitas recipe I have found for the Instant Pot. I used orange juice and about half a Shock Top for my liquid, cooked for 50 minutes. Browned on a cast iron just before serving. Perfection.

I made this last night and it turned out incredible! I had a 2.77 lb pork butt so I scaled down the seasonings to about 2/3  of what the recipe calls for. I used my instant pot and cooked it on high pressure for 45 minutes and let it naturally release pressure for 15 minutes. The meat practically shredded on it's own. Today I had some leftovers for lunch and it was just as good as it was last night. This recipe is a winner!! I would give it 10 stars if I could.!!

I have made this multiple times; in fact, it was first pressure cooker recipe. My husband loves the Mexican food trucks in LA and he said this was by far the best (and we're in PA)!  I used warmed corn tortillas. He eats it as is, but I lobe the addition of mashing avocado and spreading it on the tortilla after warmed.
This recipe truly needs no alterations; I simply love avocado. I also added some lime juice when adding the OJ. I will.sometimes use a little shredded Mexican cheese mix, but again - my preference only. 
DO NOT HESITATE TO TRY THIS! I knew nothing about how to make carnitas. This is the first and last recipe I will make for this dish. Thanks again !!

Cut the ingredients back by half and did this with a couple big chicken breasts with the "instant pot" (because that was what I had) with time cut in half too. Shredded  for a taco salad.  Was awesome !!  Will try with pork next time, thanks.

I followed the recipe fairly closely. I combined the ingredients the night before and marinated the pork in them. 

I added coriander, like so many others recommended, but do not think it made an appreciable difference. I added one squeezed orange (on top of the cup of OJ) because I worried that there was not enough juice to keep the meat from drying out. That fear was unfounded because there was a lot of juice at the end of the cooking cycle.

I cooked it for 40 minutes and that was more than enough time to cook 3.5 lbs of pork loin. 

Verdict: I know I have a winner when my picky wife goes back for seconds, eats it for breakfast (she will eat almost anything at breakfast time) and eats it again at dinner. It is a great recipe. When I told her how much OJ was in the recipe she was amazed, because it does not come out with an orangey flavor. 

Uses: tacos is an obvious, best choice. But a close second is nachos. Re-heat the leftover meat, place some guacamole and pico de gallo over the pork and serve with tortilla chips. This keeps the chips crisp and you will have a perfect nacho meal.

This turned out perfect! The pork was juicy, tender and full of flavor. The only thing I did differently was add  1 1/2 tsp. of coriander like the other reviewers mentioned. I served the meat on street taco sized flour tortillas with my chopped pineapple, pickled jalapeño and jicama salsa and queso fresco cheese. My family raved about this and it is going to be my got to for carnitas from now on! Awesome recipe, THANK YOU!

Love the combination of spices here. I only used a 4 lb roast so it was even spicier. I did Not use the orange juice rather I used Lime juice...it was perfect! I served it with flour tortillas, sour cream, picante and a mix of cheddar and jack cheese.  Next time I will try adding some garlic to the spices and maybe then it will get 5 stars.

Great basic recipe.     I tweaked it a bit  . . . used cilantro in the main pot.   Poured the spices in a bag and shook up about 2lbs of meat at a time giving them a nice coating - then pouring in oil and shaking again.    Bought some  of the ingredients at the local Vallartas Market - great pickings for  Latin food!

I have used this recipe a couple of times and have a fresh batch cooking at the time of this post. I pretty much make it per the recipe. I don't know if I've seen a 6 # boston butt. Most tend to be closer to 8-10#s. But I normally cook 12-15 #s. I double the cook time to around 2 hours. I haven't found much help on cook times for larger amounts when using a pressure cooker but I know 1 hour doesn't get it done. This is a great meal for a large group. I will continue to use with corrections for time.

Wow, wow, wow. Super yummy. First time making a slow cooked pulled pork. Sooo happy. I did add some lime juice at the beginning while cooking.  I just can’t have a dry crock pot. Call me crazy. Anyway it’s a keeper for sure.

Added 1 Poblano Pepper and 1 jalapeño pepper.  Meat ended up being about 3 lbs after trimming. Meat was cut into roughly 2 x 4” cubes.  Reduced pressure cooking time to 25 minutes for traditional pressure cooker.  Meat shred beautifully.  Served with Lime Rice STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS RECIPE!

Excellent result from my Instant Pot!  First time making carnitas in my Instant pot that I have had for a couple months now.  I used the other half of this 6 lb. pork butt roast in the crock pot.  This was even better!  The meat was moist and just fell apart on its own.  Barely needed a fork to shred.  I also used 1 tsp coriander as some suggested in the reviews and cooked for 45 min on Pressure Cook, but otherwise followed the recipe.  We loved it.  I did crisp some meat up for burritos under the broiler on a foil lined cookie sheet with a little of the juice drizzled over first  Made some nice crispy edges.

Only adjustment I made was 16 oz of orange juice rather than 8 oz.  Excellent flavor and super easy.  I have a Cuisinart pressure cooker - 60 mins with natural release was perfect!  Thank you for posting this recipe!

Only change I made was to add coriander as another reviewer had suggested.  Outstanding!  My family is wanting it again, so I'll be making it again this week.  We made tacos/burritos with it  and added tomatoes, cheese, sour cream, homemade guacamole, salsa, and black olives.  I was going to have mine as a salad, but used GF wraps instead...a bit messy, but still fantastic.

Amazing! I do not have a pressure cooker so I used my crock pot. These are so delicious that my husband already went out and bought another pork butt for round two. Juicy, flavorful, tender meat and no messy cleanup. Thank you for sharing this outstanding recipe with us!!

Great recipe.... I chose this recipe because I didn't have a lime or lime juice. It came out great. I used a pork blade cut that I deboned and diced up. Also added a tsp of coriander as KGora recommended. I was skeptical of the amount of OJ,  what flavor I would get for not using a lime since most  recipes I find for carnitas had lime. If I were to do this again, I would add juice from 1 lime with the OJ for a bit more acidity/ zing. I used a Fagor traditional pressure cooker for about 60 mins

Second time making this. Followed recipe exactly! Only exception is I use a trimmed bone-in pork shoulder (I throw the trimmed bone in to get all the meat off of it). Everyone loves the result.

Found this recipe in the Sep/Oct issue of All Recipes Magazine. I halved the recipe and added a squeeze of lime juice to the pot before cooking. Easily the best recipe for carnitas of all I've tried since first learning about the dish in Sonia Sotomayor's memoir, My Beloved World. Definitely a keeper recipe that will go into regular rotation in our home.

Fantastic and easy. Have made it twice. Both times I doubled the seasonings except I didn't double the salt. Also added 2t coriander to the doubled spices. Didn't change anything else. The flavor is amazing and the meat super tender. Used the leftover juice (after chilling and removing the fat) as the base for my pressure cooker split pea soup. Thanks for this incredible recipe!

This recipe is so good. I ended up with less than six pounds after removing fat from the roast so decreased slightly the dry ingredients. My son and I call this a winner.

I made this for a small crowd and it was super well accepted. We actually ran out before everyone got some because everyone wanted seconds. I did not have orange juice so I just squeezed a big orange. It was great!

The balance of spices was perfect. I browned it in my black iron skillet first. Since my husband is a sauce guy I poured the juices from the pressure cooker into the black skillet and thickened it with corn starch. He loved it!

This was delicious! I added coriander as suggested by another user (1 tsp for a 2# pork loin). I couldn't find "butt" so I did pork loin roast. I had to adjust the seasoning but *don't* adjust the liquid. I also used a whole small onion. 
My husband thought it was delicious. 
Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Delicious!!! Definitely this recipe goes on my personal Hall of Fame.  I was a little bit skeptical about this recipe because  I know in Mexico they fried in lard the meat for a long time so I thought the texture and flavor of the dish could be compromised...but I was so wrong!!! And I'm glad of it, LOL!!!  All my family loved it and is healthier than the  traditional carnitas. I added a bay leaf and marjoram to the rub. We ate them with corn tortillas, cilantro, onion, lime, salsa verde and avocado.

Fantastic!!!  I made as instructed in my Instant Pot.  45 min on high, natural depressurize (15 min).  I took it to a party and everyone asked for the recipe.  Some  of my friends even purchased an Instant Pot after tasting.  So easy and so yummy!!

I've made several different carnitas recipes and for the most part, they're all pretty good.  I, too, have an Instant Pot and needed to make carnitas quickly for a baby shower.  I doubled the recipe because I had a 11 pound shoulder roast.  Basically, I had to do everything in two batches because I simply did not have a bowl large enough for all of the carnitas at once.  (The same was true for the cilantro-lime rice that I also made.)  I divided the meat chunks and the seasonings into two batches and worked/cooked them separately.  I cooked each batch for 30 minutes in the Instant Pot.  After all of the meat was cooked, I combined them (with some of the juices) into one large covered bowl.  The meat was tender and delicious.  Though it was extremely tender, it still held its shape in the chunks unless you smashed it.  Perfect!  Per some of the reviews, I did add a teaspoon of ground coriander.  I also put about half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon.  One other minor addition was a couple of chopped up Anaheim peppers.  The flavor was great!  I don't care for foods that are too salty, she next time I make it, I'll probably reduce the salt by one-third.  Everyone else was okay with the salt level.

Awesome! This is the first time I've ever made or even eaten a carnita. Shame on me. I have wasted 47 years of opportunity. These are delicious. I used a regular pressure cooker and needed to add extra liquid half-way through. My pork was super lean though. Thank you for the recipe.

I made this in my Instant pot.  i halved the recipe and added a little extra orange juice.  I cooked it in 35 mins and let it depressurize naturally and it was perfect.  great for kids too!

My mother-in-law and I were trying to find a good recipe of carnitas for my sister in law's wedding dinner . We loved it! This recipe was super easy and yummy! I also added about a tsp of coriander and about 1/2 to 1 cup of water with about a 2 tsp. of chicken bullion.

This was delicious!  I made a similar recipe before, cooked it in a dutch oven, and didn't trim off too much fat.  Did it this time in the Instant Pot, and there ended up being a lot of fat.  No problem, I simply drained off a little, and it was absolutely delicious.  This is going in my Best of recipe collection.  Nice job!

I made a 3lb pork shoulder and did not scale back the seasonings. We don't eat much sugar, so I subbed the OJ with lemon juice and a teaspoon of stevia. I swapped a shallot for the onion, and I added a cap full of liquid smoke. We wrapped them with romaine leaves. It was amazing! My kids fought over the seconds. We will definitely make this again.

I combined this recipe with another one and added lime juice and lemon juice to the braising liquid.  Also, after the meat was done I shredded it and spread it out on a foil lined cookie sheet with about 1/2 cup of the braising liquid and roasted it for about 10 mins in a 400- degree oven.  Makes the pork get nice and crispy on the outside!

After cooking for 25 minutes, I cooled the pressure cooker down immediately and added red and green pepper strips. I cooked it for another couple minutes with the pressure before immediately cooling it down again. It was tender and shredded easily. I served it with warmed flour tortillas, green onions and jalapeños (for those who wanted a little more spice). To me the spiciness was perfect. My husband and guests loved it! My husband definitely wants me to save this recipe!
