Very nice recipe, I added garlic and omited the nutmeg(just a personal preference)
The heavy cream can be substituted with half& half. Lots of variety with choice of cheese, go for it and thanks for a nice side dish!

I found this recipe with "ingredient search" since I have 1 cup ricotta...after reading reviews, I added sauteed onion and garlic to the ricotta, and fresh Italian parsley and oregano.  Thanks for the original recipe; I wouldn't have thought of gratin potatoes to "use up" my ricotta.

I made this recipe with onions, garlic, and cheddar cheese and thought it was pretty good. I had an oops moment and added the ricotta to the cream and it came out not very cheesy. I think I would make this again, but just make a cheese sauce with the same ingredients instead of just throwing it together in layers. Overall not bad.

Oh, and when I was a kid, my mom added ham to au gratin potatoes, which is delicious!

Nice light version of the usual gratin. It is a little bland, next time I will add some spice.

I should have read the other review and added garlic. . .or something.  The texture was nice, but there was no flavor to these--very bland.  Needs something to kick it up.

I wanted to like this so badly.  It was very time consuming to make and the ingredients were rather pricey.  I was also trying to overlook how unhealthy they are, but when we tasted them, it was not worth it at all.  The ricotta was just wierd in there and there was not much flavor (and I even threw in extra seasoning based on other reviews). We did eat them with dinner but threw the rest away.  Usually when I try a new recipe that I am very excited about and it does't turn out like I want, I 'tweak' it until it works.  Not this one.

Very dry, with dotted ricotta mix staying in blobs.  This recipe needs a cheese sauce poured over it.

I usually don't like Potatoes Gratin, but I loved the flavor of these with the Gruyere Cheese!  Definitely don't sub any other cheese.  I added lots of spices in with the ricotta (1 T each of salt, parsley, oregano, and a little pepper) & it was very good.  The potatoes were perfectly cooked.  I wish I would have mixed the egg in with the Ricotta b/c when I mixed it with the cream & poured it on top, the eggs sort-of rested on the top & looked weird.  Also, I did not peel my potatoes.  Excellent new side dish to add to my recipes!  thank you!

The texture of these potatoes was absolutely perfect. However, because I didn't have gruyere cheese, and tried to sub-in other types, it turned out a little bland. My boyfriend thought they were fantastic, though next time I'll use stronger flavored cheese.   Also, I reduced the amount of Parsley the recipe called for and it still seemed overwhelming.
