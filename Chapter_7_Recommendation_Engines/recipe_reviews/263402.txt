This was a lot of work and not very good. I used freshly squeezed orange juice and fresh ginger. I made the breading according to instructions and it was bland. The dipping sauce was just okay.

We liked it very much however I would reduce the amount of sauce. I could not find the Shaoxing wine so I used dry sherry. I also could not find the shichimi togarashi  (Japanese 7 spice) so I used Chinese 5 spice. And sadly I forgot the garlic. So I am looking forward to trying this again and using garlic.
