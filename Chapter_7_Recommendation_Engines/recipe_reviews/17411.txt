YUM!! Here's what I did differently: I layered it with crust, cream cheese filling, pie filling, and crust crumbles, no top cream layer. I also reduced the milk to 3 tbsp. and folded a tub of Cool Whip into the cream cheese layer. It kept its shape wonderfully and was so creamy and wonderful... When I make this again, I have to be sure to take it to some kind of function for others to share, or I'll eat the whole thing.

this cheesecake is really easy to make...no bake. my dad loved it. the only recommendation i would make is that i used regular butter with the graham cracker crumbs and it made parts of the cheesecake salty. use unsalted butter or sweet cream butter. also, it's very time consuming crushing all the graham crackers. i didn't know they sold it in stores already crushed, but the next time i make cheesecake, i'm gonna have to get the already made crumbs. saves time. a final recommendation on the filling. on any fruit filling, there's a brand called lucky leaf that makes them really good. not too sweet and not too syrupy. very very good. enjoy!

This is excellant! Easy to make. Very popular, people go back for seconds! I took this to a group where it was running up against a peach cobbler. The blueberry squares were gone at the end of the meeting while the cobbler had only 2 or 3 pieces taken.

This recipe was excellent, easy to make and delicious!  I did follow someone's recommendation and added a little more butter to the graham crackers, and instead of blueberry pie filling I used raspberry and it was SO yummy.  Doesn't take long to prepare and is great if you're running short on time and would like to whip up something quickly.

I made these for the Superbowl (yay New England!) and it turned out great.  I didn't use the whipped cream layer, and I doubled the cream cheese layer to make up for it.  Turned out great, very easy to prepare!  Definitely keeping this recipe in my collection.

i'm not a cheesecake fan but i really enjoyed this recipe- mixed in some fresh blueberries as well and used cinnamon graham crackers for the crust to give it some more flavor... i did do one other thing differently: i folded the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture so made two layers of the same kind of spread- it tasted excellent- will make again but next time i'll be using 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese instead and maybe even light whipping cream- this tasted almost too heavy.

Very delicious...the kids love it ! To make it more presentable & easy to cut..I added some gelatine mixture in the cream cheese, chill it for a while then spread with blueberry filling mixed with a little gelatine and continue to chill it until ready to serve.  Top every serving with the desired amount of whipped cream.

This was absolutely delicious. I made it for a pot luck lunch at work and everybody loved it. You have to put gelatin in the blueberry sauce and the cream cheese mixture or else it doesn't keep it's shape. I would also suggest more butter in the graham crust (or molasses).

I love this recipe! I made this for the first time for a super bowl party and doubled the batch. When I was adding the powdered sugar to the cream cheese, I did add an extra tablespoon. I also mixed fresh blueberries with the pie filling. Everyone LOved It!!!!! This is really an easy and quick recipe that tastes wonderful.

This was delicious and very easy to make. Next time I will double the cream cheese mixture. I gave this recipe to a friend and she also thought that doubling the cream cheese mixture would be better. Would also be great to try different fruits also. It's a keeper.

This recipe was very good.  At first I thought it wasn't going to turn out so good, but after chilling it, the dessert turned out quite nicely.  It also has good presentation.

This was very simple to make and taste's amazing... I made a shortbread crust with mine, as I don't like the graham cracker crust.    If you want to use a shortbread crust the recipe is below  1 cup butter 1/2 cup confectioners sugar 2 cups flour 1/4 tsp baking powder  cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.  Stir together flour and baking powder.. Blend into butter mixture. Pat into 9 x 13 pan.  Bake at 350 for 12-15 min

This was yummy & a hit with our friends! I used frozen bluberries that I simmered w/ some sugar & corn starch instead of pie filling, so probably it was not as blueberry-y as the original recipe. I took the advice of others & did a 1 1/2 batch of the cream cheese, which was definitely a good idea. Future ideas might be to spray the pan before putting down the crust (or add more butter to crumbs as others mentioned), as I had a little trouble getting it out & it fell apart, also could use cool whip instead of whipping the cream yourself to save time & also possibly hold the shape better. I will definitely make again!

Very good!  I didn't have any graham cracker crumbs, so I used crushed vanilla wafers.  Also, mine came out more like a pudding dessert, so I couldn't really cut them into squares.  But it was still delicious.

Great recipe!  I found it very pleasing and was just right on the sweetness. Simple to make, always a plus! I just added white sugar to the cream cheese instead of the powdered sugar. Thanks! This will be in my family for years to come.

Deelish -- I have made this recipe four times in one month.  My family and friends love it, especially the kids.  I doubled the cream cheese layer. When in a hurry, I use an 8 ounce container of whipped cream instead of making my own.  It's great and you can use any fruit pie filling you want to satisfy anyone's taste buds.

This was very tasty, and good on a hot day. My mom and I made this for her boyfriend's birthday and he loved it. We didnt have whipping cream but we did have frozen whipped cream, this dessert still came out amazing. Anyone who loves blueberries will love this recipe, it is a keeper- It will be gone in no time.

The cream cheese layer was bitter; I added more sugar, and it was still just ok. There's also a better recipe for the whipped cream: 1 cup heavy whipping cream, 1 T Confectioners sugar, and 1 t vanilla.

This is delicious and everyone thinks it must have taken a long time to make, when really it takes no time at all! I used the pre-made graham cracker crust and was wonderful. Doesn't really come out in squares but it tastes so good, who cares!?

I served this at a Creative Memories workshop and all the women loved it.  Several of them asked for the receipe and will be serving it at a neighborhood pot luck.  Definitely a keeper in my receipe book.

All the yumminess of cheesecake, but light enough to be able to go back for more!  I make this recipe every summer with my own fresh blueberry filling instead canned.  I usually buy a prepared graham cracker crust. Today I am trying the recipe with Nilla Wafer cookies and adding some strawberries with the blueberries.

This recipe was just okay. Needs some work. My crust didn't hold well cutting into squares, not one clean portion and flopped. I felt it needed to a few teaspoons of sugar added to the graham cracker crust and baked at 350 degrees for 9-11 minutes, then cooled. As is...it didn't work. The cream cheese layer was slightly off on the taste, needed to be sweetened a little more, so I added an additional 1-2 TBSPs of confectioner's sugar to balance it out. The blueberry pie filling was homemade from here and the whipped topping layer was just fine. Bake the graham cracker crust because if you don't, you're not going to get nice cut squares, as I had to put mine in parfait style bowls to make it easier for presentation for my family and guest on the 2nd batch.

While this recipe tastes okay, I find the title to be a bit deceiving.  As others have noted, I too, found it impossible to cut this into squares.  Even after chilling for over eight hours, it was still somewhat the consistency of pudding.  As a side note and for my own personal preferences, I would have preferred more blueberries and less cream cheese/whipped cream.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, BIRDIEF!

I loved this recipe.  It would taste good with any fruit pie filling.  To make it even easier, forget the cracker crumbs, and instead line the baking dish with whole graham crackers.  The graham crackers will soften up while it's chilling in the refrigerator.  This also lowers the fat and calories, as you don't use any butter!

Reading these reviews, I'm not sure what I did wrong. It tasted okay, but had to be scooped out of the pan. No way I could serve it at a function.  Will have to look for another recipe.

I sincerely hope you do not think this is a new recipe.  I'm 56 years of age and I remember my mother making this when I was a child.  I have the recipe in my box.  She got it from an old cookbook she use to use. It is an excellent recipe, but an old one.

This recipe is very good, but I think it needs more cream cheese. You could hardly even taste the cream cheese.

I made this last night for my family and everyonoe loved it. I 1.5 the recipe and made it in a 12 x 15 dish. I used 2 cans of blueberry pie filling and about a cup of frozen blueberries sprinkled on the pie filling. This gave it a little more of a fresh fruit taste. 
Will definitely make again!

I did not care for this at all.  The middle cream cheese layer was actually bitter tasting.  Sorry, I would not try this again.

Nice summertime treat - light and fruity with good taste and texture. My only criticism is that it does not hold its shape very well, so cutting into pieces doesn't really work. You end up with a scoopful on each plate rather than a square piece.

nice easy recipe, a little hard to serve (scoops out for the most part and doesnt cut into squares for serving).  Kids really love it, but I thought it was rather unimpressive.
