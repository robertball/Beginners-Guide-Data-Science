awesome!! i used fresh garlic, scallions, 1 eggplant, 2 juicy ripe tomatoes, prilla briton leaves (my boyfriend and my favorite find of the year - beautiful purple and green basil-like leaves used in korean recipies that act like sushi wraps) and two green peppers from our garden and the farm he works at all picked in the last 30 hours.  i sprinkled sea salt while cooking and cinamon when served with jasmine rice.  its was one of the most satisfying surprises in a long time.  thanks for the recipie.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe and have it several times a month with couscous and grilled courgettes. It is a simple dish to prepare, looks very pretty (as someone else said) and is absolutely delicious. I have stuck with the original recipe but always make much more then we need as its wonderful the next day for lunch. Thank you for this great dish!

Very good dish.  I didn't bother with the roasting of the skin, but just peeled it and did everything in the skillet.  I served it over basmati rice and it was filling and tasty!

I have no idea why anyone would give this less than five stars!  It was absolutely to die for -definitely worth the prep time.

I did change this recipe so was between 3 and 4 stars.... It was well received at my dinner party, but I did use fresh garlic (2 cloves), roasted peepers as well as eggplant and cut both up into smaller pieces once they were roasted.  I also put some grated cheese on top when I put it back in the oven which I think made it even better. Having just been to turkey we were craving the food from there and were quite happy with this.  Thanks Mrs Forrow!

This was a very surprising dish.  I thought it was going to be plain, but the cinnamon really added to the flavor.  I changed the recipe a bit and cooked tofu with the onions and garlic in the beginning.  I also salted the eggplant and let it drain in a strainer about an hour before I cooked it.  That helped with the bitterness.  I can't wait to make it again!

Surprisingly tasty, given how simple the ingredients were.  Love this because I had all the ingredients in the pantry except the eggplant.  Very easy and satisfying with couscous, will definitely make again.

I had time to kill, so I caramelized the onions first. I also used extra garlic and coriander instead of cinnamon. Came out great!

I would have liked this better if I used a tomato sauce instead of the diced tomatoes.  Personal preference.  This was just ok.  I sprinkled some parm. on top before the last baking.  If I do make this again, I'll make the change with the tomatoes, and perhaps salting and draing the eggplants first before baking.

We were disappointed by this recipe. The unusual spices made me expect unusual flavors, but it was on the bland side. Could be the cook, certainly, but we weren't impressed enough to try again.

Perhaps I did something wrong? Maybe too much cinnamon? In any case, it tasted fine before the cinnamon, then, although it looked great, it was extremely (and I do mean extremely!) bitter. I might try making it again, but I think I'd add garam masala & leave out the cinnamon.

This was just okay. It was a pain gutting the eggplant. And the cooked eggplant did not have that nice sweet flavour that roasting gives it. I will try again, but will cook the eggplants longer and slower next time. Oh...and I used about 15 oz fresh tomatoes...mmm...fresh tomatoes...

Amazing recipe! I didn't have any tomatoes, so I tripled the amount of tomato paste and threw in some mushrooms and red peppers to make it a little more stuffed. After scooping out the eggplant halves and baking them twice, the "1 cm" of actual eggplant "meat" had completely dissolved. It burnt a bit around the edges, but  it was nonetheless delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

This was great.  I added more garlic and onions to it.  Didn't have diced tomatoes on hand so I used a can of stewed tomatoes that I chopped up and also added a pinch of allspice and cinnamon to the mixture.  Will definitely make again.  However I think I will chop up the entire eggplant rather than using the baked shell.  Easier to make and my husband wasn't crazy about the shell.

It's really good but make sure to cube your eggplant into small pieces so that it doesn't take forever to cook like mine!

Great receipe. I was hesitant to try it just because the combination of ingredients seemed odd to me. I was not expecting it to be tasty at all. Much to my delight, it was wonderful. 

I did not salt the eggplant as others did. I didn't find it bitter at all.

Good, could use more flavor, not sure what is missing. My can of diced tomatoes had basil, oregano and garlic in it. I didn't add 1 TBL of tomato paste. Next time I will try the suggestions of red peper flakes, nutmeg and serve with couscous.

Great recipe.  I did some of the suggestions...pinch of nutmeg, red pepper flakes to taste.  Will peel off the skin and cook without it in the future...just to save time.

Gosh, this was yummy and no odd ingredients to buy!  I had everything in the house except the eggplant.  I did salt and drain the eggplant for a couple of hours before cooking.  I also used a basil/garlic diced tomatoes for more levels of flavor. Served with BBQ goat/lamb mixture and the lemon potatoes from this site.  Plan to make again soon.  Why not? Yummy and healthy.

This was delicious! The only downside is that it takes so long to cook for just 2 servings.
