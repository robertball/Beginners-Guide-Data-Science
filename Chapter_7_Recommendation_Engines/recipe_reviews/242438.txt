I didn't grill this recipe but instead baked it. my entire family loved it! I left it in the oven at 405Â° until it was extra crispy and caramelized. very delicious.

The chicken did not get done in the times of the recipe and I had to return to the grill. Needless to say, my family was not happy waiting at the table. They did not complain about the seasonings, so I guess those were OK.

The chicken was delicious, great flavor. My family loved it..  The only problem I had was the drippings on the aluminum foil began to burn, maybe I didn't have enough holes in the foil.  Had to remove foil an cook directly on grill.

It was very moist and delicious!  Do not leave out the step of brushing on the reserve while cooking!

Delicious with no changes! Obviously the longer you marinate the better. Also obviously, the bottle of dressing you choose is important. I used a balsamic one :)
