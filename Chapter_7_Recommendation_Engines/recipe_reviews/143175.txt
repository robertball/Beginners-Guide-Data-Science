edited: This is a nice, easy dish to prepare. The chops were incredibly moist & tender & the sauce was pleasant. Browning the chops in butter was an excellent way to boost flavor, but to ensure they were well-done, I put the oven higher to 350 so they could finish there while the sauce was prepared; they were perfect. I omitted the brandy. The mushroom & apple flavors were weak. Overall, the sauce was less flavored than I had expected, the mushrooms & apple flavors were obscured.  A calvados instead of any old brandy might help boost the apple flavor. I also used unsalted butter, & a generous pinch of kosher salt helped boost the flavor. Some fresh parsley would probably be a good addition. I made this again, curdling problem not repeated. It still needs a strong boost of apple flavor, though. I increased the cider and reduced it to about a quarter. I made up the difference in the liquid by adding more cider; I reduced it again to about half per the original recipe. I didn't want to use something heavy & risk diluting the apple flavor, so I warmed some whole milk in the microwave instead of cream (about 1/8 cup, maybe a little more, but under 1/4 cup) & whisked it in slowly. Next time, I'll try adding some calvados & see what that gets me.

This was good. The mix of the cider, brandy, and pork was different and offered a unique taste. I added rosemary and basil to add a more full-bodied flavor. I also added 1/2 cup of applesauce to increase the apple flavor. My family liked it and I do believe we will make this again.

This recipe is a keeper!  This ranks as one of the Top 3 'on line' recipes;  I have tried many and reviewed none.  The sauce is absolutely the best--a rich, deep, unique taste.  YUMMY!!!  Like others, I added one bunch of chopped green onions and placed chops on top of sauce, covered with foil, and kept in oven for 40 minutes at 300 degrees.

I didn't have a granny smith apple, so I just used what I had on hand.  I also didn't have apple cider, so I subbed in apple cider vinegar.  This really cut the sweetness down and made it deliciously tangy.  These were so good that my 4 and 5 year old kids ASKED FOR SECONDS.  My kids almost never agree on a dish, and seconds are an extremely rare request!  Definitely will make again.

I don't think I will make this again. It was very sweet and super strong in the apple flavor. I think the addition of garlic might have improved the flavor some. Maybe a smoky whiskey instead to counter the sweet apple. Also; temper your cream. Adding it straight scalds it and makes it appear separated.

This may become my new signature dish.  Very good.......unique flavours.  Didn't have brandy so improvised and used Whiskey.  I cannot really explain the combination of flavours ----- smokey, creamy, mushroomy and fruity all together.

This was fantastic!!!  We felt it was restaurant worthy on the presentation.  The kids were really impressed too.  House smelled fantastic!  Served it with Hasselback Potatoes from this sight and fresh green beans.  Will definitely make again!

Delish!! I was too cheap to buy brandy (in WA we have insane alcohol taxes)but had peach Schnapp's in the freezer and used that. It was sweet but very good!! I can see how the brandy would give it a deeper richness to the gravy but the Schnapp's worked pretty good, too. I especially liked the pyro effect!! I'd never put a flame to anything I'd cooked, so this was a ton of fun!! The chops were tender, as well. This is a def winner in my kitchen and will be made again and again.

very good recipe! the apple flavor was a good spin off from the ordinary chops and gravy flavor. i used apple juice instead of brandy, which reaaallllyyyy brought the apple flavor out a tad bit too much. but still, very very good recipe

I followed the recipe to the letter and loved it!  The only change I made was to use thick cut bone in chops.  I increased the temp and finished the chops in the oven.  Will be making this again!

Thumbs up from the whole family!  I didn't have brandy so took another's advice and used schnapps that I had on hand.  Mine was butterscotch.  I also doubled the cider vinegar and cream, my guys like extra sauce.  They also don't go for mushrooms so I used three apples and they gobbled it up!

I jazz the sauce up, added about 2 Oz flour to the mushroom sauce and add 1/2 cup more of half and half with 1/4 cup of brandy, put slice apple of the meat and poured the mushroom sauce over the meat, baked  a 325 oven for 45 mins covered with foil.
