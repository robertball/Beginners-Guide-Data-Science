This was too strong for my liking. If I make it again I will halve the banana liqueur and maybe toss in half a frozen banana with the ice cream.

I made this with homemade frozen vanilla yogurt instead of ice cream. Very interesting cocktail. I thought the banana liqueur overpowered everything else I'd like to try this again but cut the amount in half.
