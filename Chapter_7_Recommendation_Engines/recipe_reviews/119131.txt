Great Snack food. I substituted worchestire sauce for liquid smoke and it worked out fine.

The first time I made these I did cut back on the liquid smoke.  They were good.  The second time I put the full amount of liquid smoke (hickory) and slightly more cayenne pepper.  Big difference.  They were great.  We do like things a little more spicy though.  What a hit these are!

These are very good. I was looking for something a little more spicy though and these were on the sweeter side. I think to get a little more kick next time I'll reduce the sugar and/or increase spices. Thanks for the recipe!

Thanks for this recipe! I used 1 1/2 cups of peanuts and 1 1/2 cups of a mixed nut blend for some variety and they are so yummy and hard to put down. I liked how easy this was, and while I didn't have the liquid smoke on hand like other reviewers, a bottle was only $2 and well worth it for the great flavor. Next time I might even add a bit more spices, but I like things with a kick.

Mmmm Mmmm. I must admit tho, that I only used 1 tblsp of liquid smoke and that was perfect for me. I don't like anything super sweet so I mixed 2 tblsp light brn sugar & 3 tblsp white. I had raw unsalted peanuts (exactly 3 cups) so I added 1 tsp of salt to the sugar/spice mix & 1/4 tsp to the egg white mix. Instead of cumin I used a Carribean jerk seasoning blend that I like. Due to having smallish peanuts I kept checking every 15 mins while in oven but the 1 hour was spot on. Do yourself a favor, use parchment paper while baking or a silcone baking sheet - these little gems leave a sticky mess behind. Also...work fast once removed from oven as the melted sugars set up rather quickly. Mine were somwhat clumped together but once totally cooled I put in a zipbag and they separated nicely pressing or tapping around little. Who cares though, so good I'd eat a cluster at at time, LOL. Nice recipe you could do different spices to change up from time to time. I love this...next time I'm getting a big honking bag of salted peanuts and make a few different styles. Yay!

These are seriously addicting. I didn't have any liquid smoke, so other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and all I can say is that I will definitely make them again!
