Good, very lightly sweet cookies that are great with a cup of tea. My yield was more like 8-1/2 dozen, though, so be prepared for a lot of rolling and cutting - and sharing!

I wasn't too crazy about these, but I think it was mainly because of the caraway seeds. Don't like the taste of them AT ALL.

I had never heard of these, but after reading about them, I think this is probably a good recipe for them.  I replaced the shortening with butter because I never keep shortening on hand, and I found other recipes for this with butter.  Very easy to make.  The caraway seeds are a bit odd in a cookie and I wonder if they could be ground up first so you aren't left with so many seeds in your teeth. :-P  The cookie baked up nicely and has a nice flavor.

I've since made these a few times after originally finding it and it's becoming a family favorite.
