A little bit of mushroom heaven....Seriously, if you try to feed 6 with this it will be "little". They will then slap you for teasing them with a tiny bit of heaven. I served the whole amt to 2 for a hearty serving.  I stuck to the veggie amts but also added about 6 button mushrooms.  Didn't measure so much as eyeballed. Only thing I really changed was the beef broth and used maybe 4 t tomato paste.  I used reduced sodium broth and ended up with about a cup and a half reduced down to almost nothing before adding cream. Added enoki with the broth and didn't brown, chopped before cooking.  Served over  shirataki noodles instead of pasta, added them before cream to soak and flavor.  Topped with Reggiano, garlic cheese bread on the side. Fabulous!

I guess I didn't get it...  I made this per the recipe except for the enoki mushrooms.  At the end I added a lot more cream than the 3 1/2 T called for in the recipe.  Don't get me wrong, I really loved the dish, but I didn't get the tiny quantities.  If my math is correct, this recipe has just less than 3 T liquid ingredients per serving which doesn't even begin to cover a serving of pasta (IMHO).  I don't know if that's a mistake or that's the intention and I don't get it.  But, the bottom line is that this is absolutely delicious and I will make it again, but with maybe four times the liquid and two or three times the vegetables!!

This recipe was delicious.  I did not simmer for the entire 35 minutes and it was a mistake - it was a bit runny.  I will definitely make this again and simmer for longer.  Also, I agree w/the comment above - I made this for two and we finished the entire thing!

Absolutely divine! But, there's no chance this recipe yields 6 servings. This recipe, as written is enough to serve three adults, or two with generous portions.

Thank you jodyratti!! :)

I did as other reviewerâ€™s suggested, and double the vegetables. Are used vegetable broth and put in more vegetable broth than it called for, too. I ground in some Italian herbs and I also added a little smoked paprika. I plan to make pasta to go with it, but I had 3 teaspoons of it and had to force myself to stop eating it all before I cooked the pasta. It is incredibly tasty!

I always modify recipes according to my taste and ingredients on hand. I used apple juice instead of wine, omitted the cream, and used white beech mushrooms  served over spinach angel hair pasta. The result is a company-worthy vegetarian meal. However, it will only serve one or two people, so that must be a typo. My picture shows the amount made by this recipe. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe is out of this world! I served it as a side; it wasn't until later that I saw it was to be served atop pasta. I used what I had on hand, so I used only one type of mushroom, substituted yellow squash for the celery, and didn't add the cream. I served it with grilled  Italian sausage and cucumber spears. Not heavy at all; perfect on a summer evening, though I will use this recipe year round!

This combo has a perfect savory taste for mushroom-fans. The recipe itself could use some edits, but the combo is worth the trials.
The newb chef that I am, I made this recipe thinking it was the whole dish. Luckily pasta takes under 8 minutes to boil and I had some on-hand. Would definitely add a step to this recipe for throwing pasta on the stove in the last 10 minutes.

I added chicken, thinking this was a light veggie dish, but on top of pasta, this sauce is very filling. Enoki mushrooms were not available at the market so I ended up getting shiitake for additional flavor. Turned out fine but also had the same issue of not really being a 'sauce'. I did not need more than 25 minutes to reduce the broth but even added an extra 1/4 cup broth. The cream and touch of nutmeg really round out the flavor to this Bolognese.
I will definitely be using this base for future recipes and may play around with more veggies.

Delicious! I was looking for a meatless sauce that tasted something like a classic Bolognese, and this definitely did it for me. I didn't have enoki mushrooms so I increased the amount of portobellos. I also had to substitute ketchup for tomato paste and fat free half and half for heavy cream. I don't think it made a difference in the taste. I don't think this makes enough for 6 servings. Three seems more likely. All in all this is a delicious and easy meatless sauce.

Loved it! I ended up making a vegan (paleo?) version- I used coconut milk instead of cream, and we ate this on top of spaghetti squash. It was SO good. I used a mix of portobella and little baby-bella mushrooms chopped into pieces- I couldn't find enoki at the store. At others' recommendation, I added some garlic and doubled the recipe (over just one spaghetti squash) and served it with a salad and some bread on the side. It made about 4 portions.

Outstanding dish! So simple and quick as well. As others noted I increased the veggies and the sauce. I also added some thin cut steak meat to the sauce as my hubby likes his meat. Anyways, it was great and there was enough leftover for lunch.
