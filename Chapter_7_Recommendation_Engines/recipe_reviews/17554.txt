This was really delicious. The chipotles are a must, even though they are listed as optional in the recipe. My family likes spicy food, so I used medium salsa. You might want to use mild salsa, as it did turn out pretty hot. I added 4 chopped canned chipotles and they provided just enough smoky flavor. I served it with plain rice, which was turned into spanish rice by the meatballs' sauce. I'll definitely make this again.

I went the easy route and bought pre-cooked meatballs, so all I needed to do was prepare the sauce and let them simmer in a slow cooker 1-2 hours to absorb the flavor.  I wanted spicy, but not too spicy.  I used mild salsa, and let the "heat" come from the chipotles, which have a more unique flavor than the salsa.  I used two chipotles, and that was perfect.  Be sure and add an extra cup of water, as the sauce is a bit too thick otherwise.  I served them plain, as cocktail meatballs, along with a Mexican food spread.  Wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!
