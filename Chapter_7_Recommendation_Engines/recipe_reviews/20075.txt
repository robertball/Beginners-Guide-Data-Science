For a great southern taste - grate very cold butter into the dry mixture and gently blend together.  (This keeps the flour light and makes biscuits stay flaky) No need to knead, just carefully press to about 3/4" and cut, simply add enough flour to remove stickiness and definitely use butter instead of shortening.  I have never had such a good biscuit!

This recipe fails to note the two most important things to remember when making biscuits:  (1) ALWAYS use COLD butter/margarine/shortening; that makes for a flaky biscuit. And (2)NEVER NEVER NEVER twist the cutter when you're cutting out the biscuits.  Twisting prevents them from rising.

EXCELLENT recipe!First time I ever made biscuits that weren't as heavy as rocks. My husband grew up on home made biscuits and thought they were as good as any he had ever eaten.  Made 2 batches, one with milk and one with buttermilk, both turned out pretty much the same, we just prefer them made with buttermilk.
Also, I make 4 batches at a time as they freeze really well.  Just be sure to roll them in flour and lay on a tray flat in the freezer.  When they have frozen I put them in a zipperer bags and store in freezer.

Had these biscuits tonight with friends. I made 2 batches and the first one didn't rise hardly at all and suspected my baking powder was the problem so I added an extra heaping teaspoon of fresh baking powder in the 2nd batch that I already had assembled and waiting for the milk. The 2nd batch rose a lot more than the first so I feel that the next time when I use the full tablespoon of fresh BP the biscuits will rise even better. I wonder if this could be the main problem with other reviewers that didn't have good lift in their biscuits. My BP was in what I thought was a very tightly closed container and didn't even think it wouldn't work. Live and learn! UPDATE 12/25. Made 3 double batches this morning. I made them per the recipe and found that 3/4" thick on the bread board made a nicer looking biscuit than patting out to 1/2". My dough was quite moist and used a spatula to get it on to the WELL floured board. Put a bit of flour on my hands and a bit on the top of the dough and just patted it out about half way to what I wanted and then flipped it over onto more flour and patted to thickness I liked. Used a 3 1/2" cutter and got about 11 nice biscuits. Don't twist the cutter when you press it down. I did once just to see if it did make a difference, and yes it did, it sealed the edge and didn't let the biscuit rise hardly at all. Also clean the cutter in between batches. The hardening dough will "crimp" the edge like twisting the cutter. All in all a great, simple recipe!

My mom has been trying for years to teach me to make biscuits, I can never remember the recipe.  This was very similar to hers and worked great.  Just be careful not to over mix your dough.

biscuits turned out good. I adjusted the recipe a little.  I used sourmilk, added 1 tbs sugar.  Also I rolled dough to about 1in thick and let stand 10min then brushed with butter.  This is the best recipe i have tried so far.  Will make again.

Got a craving for biscuits 30 minutes ago.  Found this recipe.  Here I sit now, in pools of melty butter.  YUM!  I did use lard instead of shortening.  Barely handled the dough at all.  IMPORTANT FOR NEW BISCUIT BAKERS:  when using a glass or cookie cutter DON'T TWIST IT for any reason.  This in effect "seals" the edges of the dough and will prevent from baking up sky high and delectable.  I did make mine huge - recipe yielded 5 - and I couldn't be happier.  Best biscuits I have ever made.  Thank you!!!

This is my "go to" biscuit recipe. They always turn out. I've gotten creative with the recipe. When I make them I make a double batch, 1/3 I cook as normal biscuits, 1/3 I roll into little balls and roll into butter, cinnamon, and sugar and stack 3 balls to one hole of a muffin tin for sweet monkey bread, and the other 1/3 I roll into little balls and dip in butter, garlic, parmesan, and herbs and place three to a muffin tin hole for monkey bread. They are great as a side to pasta, soup, breakfast, or with jelly. I've also replaced the milk with yogurt and they turn out even more moist. Love them!

To those who are coming out with dense biscuits that don't rise, you are kneading them too much. Mix the milk in just barely enough to moisten the whole mixture and only knead a few times. Your biscuits will come out light and fluffy every time.

Did not rise at all... don't think it was my ingredients, I'd used them for something else earlier that came out fine.  I told my kids these were "bread cookies" and some of them were eaten, but...I didn't care for this recipe.

FINALLY a biscuit recipe that actually turns out.  This is the fourth biscuit recipe I have tried from this site and this was the first one that turned out flakey and soft on the inside and crisp on the outside.  I used butter and grated it with a cheese grater like someone suggested.  Then I turned it out onto the counter, flattened it slightly, and cut it into pieces with a knife rather than making perfect circles.  So easy and will definitely be my regular biscuit recipe!

These turned out perfect and I am not a great cook! 
I kneeded them a bit too, about 8-10 times.

This was my first attempt at making biscuits and they came out perfectly. All I had was skim milk and heavy whipping cream so I used half of each to make up my 3/4c milk. I also went ahead and greased my sheet with margarine and melted some margarine to brush over the biscuits. They came out amazing.

Finally! after 25 years of marriage, I was successful in making biscuits. I've tried many times over the years with hard bricks usually my end result.  I did substitute cold grated butter for the shortening as others suggested. I wished I hadn't added the salt as my butter was salted. I picked up the wrong flour and got self-rising instead of all purpose so I don't know what difference it makes. I do know the biscuits came out very soft and buttery. It would be difficult to slice in half and put a sausage patty in there. I will try the all purpose next time to see what difference it makes. The biscuits tastes very good and have a homemade flavor to them. I didn't roll mine out but scooped up a ball and gently patted it out. Definately will be trying this some more.

These are the flakiest biscuits I have ever made.  I used a stick of cold butter and shredded it in like Julie W suggested and it is delicious!  To make these brown better on top, I run my fingers under the tap and lightly pat a little water on them right before I put them in the oven.  I also make these in double batches to freeze.  Take out what you need and bake right away, increase baking time or thaw on the counter or over night in the fridge.  I "square" cut these out with a pastry blade and the recipe makes 12- 2"x2"x1/2" biscuits.

I love this recipe!! It is very simple and fast and turns out great! Crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. I wanted to make them a little healthier, so I did 1/2 white, 1/2 wheat flour. It turned out great. I Think sifting the flour helped a lot. I sifted it a little bit more than one time too, because I've heard that sifting wheat flour helps it come out fluffier. Thanks for a great recipe we will use time and time again!

This recipe is the closest to my Mom's baking powder biscuits I have ever tried to make. I have never been able to get the dough to rise enough or be flaky enough like my Mom's until this recipe. 
The only change or addition I would like to add is that the biscuits should be placed so close together before baking that the dough is " kissing" the next biscuit. This helps to keep moistness in.
Also, if you need to warm them up and want them to be like they had just come out of the oven: place the biscuits loosely in a paperbag, fold the top down and roll it up tightly. Run the water faucet briefly over the bag of biscuits . The outside should look wet, but not saturated. Heat bag of biscuits in the oven on 300 f for about 20 minutes but check the biscuit's warmth every 10-5 minutes.

This is pretty much the same recipe I've used for 30 years except I simplified it by using self-rising flour instead of the flour, baking powder, and salt. Key to success is how "moist" the dough is after you add the liquid to the flour/shortening. You learn over time not too dry and not too wet, but a little too wet is better. Dry dough requires too much handling & makes tough biscuits. Gently "folding" the liquid & dry together till combined works well for me. Sometimes the dough is so moist I use a floured egg turner to gently scoop it over during kneading it. Also, liked grated cold butter as suggested instead of less healthy shortening. Even tried "I can't believe it's not butter". Turned out great!

Pretty awesome!
I followed some suggestions from others and my biscuits came out oh so yummy.
Instead of shortening, I used real butter. I also added some more baking powder.
My dad's side of the family is from the south. I was taught how to make biscuits, but I couldn't remember the recipe, so this was very helpful.
They don't actually 'measure' but eye things. Instead of milk, use butter milk. Also, don't roll the dough out at all. You form each biscuit using your own hands. Granny used her hands while mixing in the butter. I remember sitting at the table and watching her do that.
Form rough balls and gently flatten out the top. Put some oil (canola, veggie) in a spoon and pour a little over the top of each. I remember aunt Brenda using the bottom of the spoon to spread the oil over the top.
The cooking time and temp. were perfect! What a great recipe. Thanks! It was so very helpful, as well as comments from others.

I had a huge craving for biscuits this morning, and I don't make them myself, so I tried this recipe. They tasted like bisquick biscuits.....
UPDATE: I now know how to make true homemade bisctuits, and this is pretty close... so to anyone out there trying this you should definetly use buttermilk instead of regular, just use self-rising flour, and use half shortening and half butter.

I LOVE this recipe. It's very basic so I tweaked it just a little bit. I use real butter because nothing is better than that which I shredded in a food processor. I add maybe 1/4 cup of sugar just for a small taste of sweetness, and 2 tablespoons of vinegar. It's rises so lovely...my husband and kids devour them before they've completely cooled.

I loved the flavor but, for some reason it didn't raise :(  I did 100% according to recipe but it looks like a cookie... Does anyone have an idea or could possibly help me?

Very easy to follow.  As others mentioned do not overwork the dough so that the biscuits will rise.  I highly recommend.

My boyfriend was craving biscuits so I whipped these together.  They definitely did the trick.  The dough seemed dry and crumbly but they puffed up nicely.

This is a wonderful recipe. I've tried several biscuit recipe's but they always turned out dry. This is moist and yummy. I did'nt add as much shortening but substituted a little butter. Like 3/4C shortening and 1/4C butter. They turned out great! I will def make again.

I just put the biscuits on the cooling rack, just after I carefully ate one and MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM, that's a good biscuit!  Easy as pie too!  These were the first biscuits I've ever made, but surely won't be my last. I didn't change a thing but did melt some butter over the tasty jewels shortly after removing them from the oven.  Bring on the sausage gravy!

This recipe has given me nothing but trouble. First: If you make these, I would recommend rolling the biscuits out MUCH thicker than the recipe recommends. I rolled mine out to a half inch thick, and I just removed the first batch from the oven and they're still... a half inch thick. My baking powder is brand-new so I'm not sure what the trouble was. Second, they're completely flavorles, even though I added salt and sugar and brushed the tops with melted butter. Third, they're extremely dry and the texture was odd.. very crumbly in the mouth. I was making these for a church function, and now I'm headed out to buy frozen biscuits. Very sad. Sigh.

Very disappointed. My husband is a biscuit lover and I thought this would be something easy for him to make. Simple ingredients and sounded "foul proof".  I had him follow the recipe to a "T".  I even had the sifter and pastry cutter for him to use.  We were careful not to over handle. The biscuits did not rise and did not brown on top. My husband didn't enjoy the taste "very floury...something missing"  I did try a bite and they we gummy and "very floury".

This is a good basic biscuit recipe, and my husband loves it. I use canola oil, and it turns out well enough for me. Sometimes I use 1/2 whole wheat flour as well. If I want them a bit fluffier, I add more milk and less oil. Good basic recipe.

Really delicious. I have made these several times and they come out slightly crispy on the outside, but are fluffy and dense on the inside. I also substituted some of the all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour and they came out great.

I won't give this 5 stars because I did make a couple changes. First I used buttermilk. Second, because I was actually making garlic knots I added a little garlic. Then used the dough instead of store bought biscuit dough for garlic knots. With minimal kneading this dough bakes up as light as a feather and very subtly in flavor. Tomorrow morning I will be making biscuits and gravy with this recipe, still using buttermilk instead of butter and butter instead of shortening. I can't wait to taste them.

I love this recipe. It is so easy to make and my family loved it. I didn't have any shortening or butter so I used margerine (Parkey brand) instead and it came out perfect. I did use one of the reviews that said not to twist the cutter. They fluffed up perfectly and are light and airy.These was the simplist recipe ever. I am so glad that I tried it. I recommend this recipe to all.

Use cold butter, don't overmix after adding the milk.  Stir until it just comes together, do not kneed the dough!  Just turn out onto a lightly floured surface and pat it out even then cut with a biscuit cutter.  Perfect biscuits.

These are the very best!!!!  Instead of shortening I used extra butter.  I also mixed the milk with half sour cream.  My family (husband and five kids) all said this was the best biscuits they've ever had, and I've tried alot of recipes on this site.
Thank you Natalie!!!

It's almost right, but not quite. I don't want to be the one the rate this as great according to my own changes, so I give it 2 stars for the "almost". my changes: butter NOT shortening, 2 Tbs of sugar (or splenda), 1 Tsp of salt (it's a must for flavor) and you have to learn the amount of kneading required. Too little and it's too crumbly, Too much and it's dense. I also form them freehand instead of messing with a cutter.

LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!! I tried with buttermilk (1cup milk+1tbls white vinegar) and accidentally tossed in the whole cup instead of 3/4 and still good! My second time making from scratch and must say less is more when it comes to handling. Lumpy n all start pressing softly soon as all is moistened. Def going into my recipe box =-)

This recipe was terrific! I doubled the recipe so I could freeze some for another day, Im so glad I did! I used butter instead of shortening, but otherwise followed the directions exactly. Next time I will use the shortening and upade my review, but im sure it will be just as tasty and flakey as these were. Thanks so much for sharing!

What a simple yet delicious recipe for a basic biscuit! Halved the recipe and added some freshly grated cheese for flavor. Served with soft salted butter to make them extra rich and tasty. Will make again!

This is the first time I have ever made homemade biscuits and this was a hit in our house this morning! I did make the first batch with shortening the second batch I made with self rising flour and cold butter. Both were great but ill be using the butter and self rising from now on.

Good basic recipe.  I change out the milk for buttermilk and add 1-2 TBS sugar.  Also change out the shortening for either lard or butter.

made this twice, both times came out like white hockey pucks. I followed directions but used cold butter not shortening. Both times very dry and dense. My only thought is I am over working the dough. GIVE ME YEAST!

These were pretty good.  There just seemed to be something missing.  They rose nice can high. Oddly enough we liked them better once cold.  I would definitely make them again.

This was a good, very basic, recipe for biscuits.  I found, however, that I had to add quite a bit more flour to the dough.  I also chose to make the dough and shape the biscuits the night before, then place them in the refrigerator overnight for baking first thing in the morning. This tasted great with some white cream gravy for breakfast!

I am giving this a 3 instead of a 1 because I did make a change. The only change I made was to use butter instead of shortening, as I don't keep shortening on hand. These did not bake up light & fluffy.  They seemed too dense.  I would not make these again, even with shortening.

It had the classic taste of biscuits... i really like the taste. Instead of baking powder, i added a lesser amount of baking soda instead with honey (to make the baking soda activate). It did not grow alot, though. Delicious, VERY easy and well worth it.

I've made breads in my bread machine then proofed on stove then bake but never made bread or biscuit dough from scratch. This recipe was so easy to follow. I wound recommend this recipe to any beginner baker.  I go to this recipe site for everything. I've tried alot of recipe from here. I find them all very easy to follow, they turn out  every time & they taste great.

Wish I had read all reviews first. I  committed the sin of twisting my cutter. This may be why they didn’t rise. However, I just hand formed the scraps making thicker and they were not so flat. They did taste good with lots of butter on top

I am the first to admit if it can be burned, I will probably burn it. For years, the thought of making homemade biscuits scared me; too much could go wrong, the butter or shortening won't be cold enough, I might work the dough too long, etc. I finally decided to give this very basic recipe a try and it turned out wonderfully! I used a stick of margarine instead of a half cup of shortening. Just to be on the safe side, I placed the butter, flour mixture and cup of (almond) milk in the freezer for about 30 minutes beforehand but this was just me trying too hard not to fail, perhaps. My Ninja dough mixer attachment blended the margarine into the flour mixture perfectly and very fast. The dough was easy to roll out (make sure to have a floured surface with extra flour on hand for when the dough begins to stick). I just grabbed a 12 oz. plastic tumbler cup, dipped the rim into flour and used it to cut out biscuits, being careful not to twist the cup as I read this can have an effect on how the biscuits rise. The size of my biscuits were of a very decent size, about what you would get at a fast food restaurant with egg and the such on them. I made 8 biscuits from my batch of dough, they baked for 10 minutes and turned out perfectly. I was so happy with my accomplishment that I began texting out pics of my amazing ( not burnt!) creation. My only complaint about these biscuits is that they do not have a strong flavor. I am used to the buttermilk flavor of restaurant or store bought b

Amazing biscuits! I made them exactly as in the recipe, except used half lard - half butter. Wow! They taste really similar to KFC or bisquick. That's a good thing! I can only imagine how amazing they will be with cheddar and some Italian seasoning. Thanks for the recipe.

Followed the recipe but I used butter and buttermilk instead of shortening and milk.  This was my second time making it. First time I used baking soda and buttermilk and they were dense as rocks lol. But tasty. I'm sure it was just the baking soda. So made a trip to the store and tried with baking powder and they came out so light and fluffy and soooo good. My husband is a southern boy and makes amazing biscuits and he definitely was impressed. Going to make these every chance I get.

These were okay, I didn't really care for then.  They were kind of dry and crummy.  They took well over 10 minutes to cook, more like 15-20 minutes.  They were a little hard.  And I made sure I did everything right, so I'm very disapointed

Almost perfect..super fluffy biscuits.. only difference I didn't have any shortening instead I tried lard and it gave a slight different flavor... mine were darker colored..I used wheat flour/unbleached flour mix TOO.. that pray was fine but next time I'll have shortening! Oh.. they'll be delicious! And SO SIMPLE

Used margarine instead of shortening (bc we had none) and they turned out DELICIOUS. We only got about 5 biscuits out of the original recipe, but we may have just cut them large. Def using this again.

Great recipe! I replaced about a third of the shortening with butter. My husband doesn't care for bread products that much (personally, I think that's crazy!), so when he devoured these, I was very pleasantly surprised. He loved the flakiness of the biscuit and was amazed that I could bake biscuits from scratch like that. I said, "Honey, southern women know instinctively how to make biscuits."  He's from the east coast...no wonder he hasn't had a good biscuit!!

Very good recipe.  I used buttermilk instead of regular milk and butter instead of shortening. I used a 1 inch biscuit cutter for a bunch of biscuits. My boyfriend loved them and they were so cute!  Make sure you place the biscuits so they are touching on the sides and they will rise higher.  I will make these again.

Nothing special here.  Made just as directed - yes I did use cold shortening - but still found they didn't rise well.  They were ok warm, but as soon as they started to cool they hardened up quite a bit.

make these all the time and to change flavor or purpose for the biscuits...ie   sweet roll or such or just plain,,.,.,do use buttermilk or sour milk  knead just a few times....add 1 to 2 tblsp sugar and some raisins if wanting a sweet one but cheese and jalapeno pepper can be used for dinner buns   so many uses and so easy.

Was in the mood for biscuits this morning but couldn't find my baking soda so I used this recipe. I think they should have turned out better but they didn't rise. They were still nice and flaky because I know how to make biscuits so I'm stumped on what went wrong....

This makes a great flaky biscuit, but doesn't have a whole lot of flavor. I think I would recommend more salt. I would also recommend turning the heat down a smidgeon so that you can role the biscuits a little thicker. Finally, there is an after tastes of baking powder that I would have preferred not to taste.

This was an OUTSTANDING recipe!!! I used butter flavored shortening & about 1 cup of milk - my husband loves biscuits & sausage gravy & he said that this recipe was the best biscuits for that!!! I think it would be great with sausage or jelly!

Thank you so very much for this recipe!

I really like this recipe. It's easy and makes great biscuits. I've never made biscuits this fast. They are so tasty by themselves. I did have the problem with them not rising but I rolled the dough a little flat and I think my baking powder just needs to be fresher. Other than that great recipe. Liked it so much I gave it to my 14 year old daughter. She's an aspiring cook.

Great recipe!! I used butter instead of shortening and grated the cold butter as suggested by Julie W. into the dry ingredients. I mixed the dough just enough to get everything incorporated and patted it flat and cut out the biscuits using a circular cookie cutter. 
The recipe was easy, full proof, flaky and amazing!!! I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to make a quick, tasty homemade biscuit.

My daughter asked me to give her this recipe when she's "older."  :-)  These were pretty easy to make, with good results.  I added a few minutes to the baking time, but maybe it's because my biscuits were a bigger.  

Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious and simple to make.  Woke up early Saturday morning with a serious craving for homemade biscuits.  These were simple and ready to eat within 30 minutes.  Yum. BTW, I used my ninja mixer, dough setting.

I used butter instead of shortening, but was out of milk so I had to used powdered and think I over did the water. I will try these again with actual milk. As of now they don't stand out as anything better than okay.

Awesome recipe! Used 1/4c butter and 1/4c shortening. I put the butter in the freezer for about 10 minutes to keep it cold. Then used my Ninja to "cut" the cold butter and shortening into the dry mixture. I followed the recipe the rest of the way. They turned out  perfectly. Soft, flaky and delicious. This was my first time making biscuits and I  ROCKED IT!

This recipe is very good. I always add some cheese to it to make it cheese biscuits.  I also put cheese on top so it melts in the oven. :)

These are great! I wanted a simple biscuit to go with my chili and these worked perfect! I did make a couple changes, used butter instead of shortening and used garlic salt instead of regular salt and was perfect with chili. (would not use garlic for biscuits and gravy) but would be good with italian meals but next time I will double the salt when using the garlic not quite strong enough for me, just a hint of flavor the way they are. Thanks for sharing!

I hate to be the girl to review a recipe when I've changed a thing or two, but I have to.  Instead of using shorting I grated a stick of cold butter in.  This was my first time making biscuits from scratch.  So yummy!!!  I used one of my kids sippy cups as a biscuit cutter.  It worked great and made good biscuits about the size as the ones from a can I used to buy from the dough boy.  Super easy, yummy, quick, and I had all ingredients on hand.  I'll never buy canned dough again!

This recipe turned out awesome! This was the first time I had made biscuits from scratch and I was very pleased. I did add a tsp of organic sugar as someone else suggested and it gave them a great flavor. I will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These were so yummy!! I substituted margarine in place of shortening.  Maybe next time I'll try butter!!  I brushed the tops with melted butter before putting them in the oven....they turned out moist and flaky!  Kids loved them!  Definitely will make again!  Thank you!!

These were edible, which is better than any I've ever made. I followed the directions EXACTLY, and they were still very flat. I measured to exactly 1/2" for half of them, and the other half I made 1". The 1" ones were significantly better, but still not as good as biscuits from a can.

These biscuits turned out a little more dense than I would like but it's possible it's from something I did.  Either way, though, the taste was good and they were very easy to make.

These were great! I tried making them a little healthier and I think I'll attempt again to make them even more healthy. I made them half whole wheat and used butter instead of shortening.

It was a great recipe for basic use. It is light and fluffy. It doesn't turn into a ball of dough in the mouth. It is also easy to add spices to to costumize it.

I liked these a lot.  My only problem with them is that they didn't really rise at all.  Maybe my baking powder was a little old.  I'll definitely make these again, though, because the flavor was awesome, and they were really flaky and tender!

Just now tried these out! They were delicious!  I was dubious at first b/c the dough was quite crumbly, more so than I'm use to.  But as a rule I don't handle biscuit dough too much b/c it makes flat hard biscuits.  I used butter flavored shortening and older baking powder (I was snowed in and used what I had).  I shaped the crumbly dough into a mound and then rolled out to just a bit over 1/2 inch, and only folded the dough when I ran out of room to cut biscuits (so I wouldn't over handle the dough).  They rose well and tasted great and they were awesomely flaky!  Yay biscuits!

These are simple and AWESOME!  I would have included a picture but my family ate them all up, six of us.  I made two batches.  Mini's first and then the regular size biscuit, both turned out wonderful.  The only thing I changed was that I used butter instead of the shortening.  These rise up so nicely too.  My standard recipe for biscuits now.

this recipe is great, but to make it AMAZING use cake flour (i use ww flour, so cake ww flour just makes them less dense- am sure white all purpose would work well too) and equal parts of butter (in place of shortening) and sour cream (in place of milk). it is an old betty crocker recipe, and yummy!

Great recipe,  I was too lazy to go to the store just for biscuits.  My 10 year old daughter loved helping, especially the butterfly shaped cookie cutter we used.  I played with the dough a little much and rolled them a little thin, but everyone loved them anyway.

Wow, these turned out very well for a first attempt.  They were a little heavy, but I think that overall they were very good, they reminded me of the biscuits my grandma made when I was little.  I will definitely try these again - practice makes perfect.  Thanks to all of the bakers and cooks who so willingly share their wonderful recipes!

Perfect! I was making Chicken Pot Pie for dinner, and my husband and daughter requested that I top it with biscuits. I used this recipe, and it was great!  I was lazy and didn't roll it out, just patted it flat with my fingers and cut out small cirlces of dough. Delicious!! They raised perfectly, and tasted great! Thanks for this keeper recipe!!

These are a great beginner recipe. I added half a packet of ranch dressing powder and the biscuits had a nice mild ranch flavor. My husband really enjoyed them.

these biscuits were delicious and very easy to make!  i added a little bit of cream in the milk and i think that it gave the biscuits a nice texture.  they didn't look all that pretty, since i think that my mix was a little crumbly, but they tasted great!

Great recipe. I had it a little too sticky but added the flour when kneading and it turned out really nice.  The whole family said "YEAH"  Doubled and we ate with butter and with the Army SOS.  Thanks Nat!

These were very good. My husband was craving biscuits with gravy and these were very satisfying. I think I overcooked them a bit because they were rather crunchy (but still good!) when they came out. However they softened up by the next day and were perfect topped with strawberries and cream!

Since I live in a cold and dry climate I have to use a little more milk. And yes I would definitely recommend making them again! Easy compared to other things I would make, and fast extremely fast! My mother used to bake them occasionally. I had some nostalgia on the first bite actually. Cut them in half lengthwise and then put some butter spread in the center! Yum!

Pretty tasty, although I may have overcooked them by a few minutes. Despite overcooking, they stayed moist and soft on the inside. **My biggest complaint is the shortening stayed clumpy even after cooking- to remedy I would strongly advise to heat the milk or soften/ melt the shortening.** I'm also wondering if using butter might enhance the flavor.   P.S. this is the basic recipe for tortillas, just swap out the milk for water.

I used butter instead of shortening added a 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar, 1 tsp of granulated onion powder and a tablespoon of parsley.  Then prepared the same as the recipe.  It was delicious.

Great! I use a cup of butter instead. I've made this recipe several times and they're always a hit! I'm going to try to make a batch and refrigerate it for the next morning so I can give my teachers a good breakfast! When you're rolling the dough, make sure you don't knead it too, too much. This will cause them to be denser and more puck-like than fluffy and pillowy.  Enjoy!

I replaced the shortening with the same amount of butter, and they turned out perfect! Fluffy, not too sweet. I used a fork to work in the butter and made sure to stop while the dough was still chunky instead of working it until smooth- that's the secret to fluffy biscuits.

12/29/19.  I’ll have to try again.  Very little rise, and I can’t tell if I like the texture.  After reading other reviews maybe I need fresh baking powder, cold shortening, and maybe it was the style of cutter I used?  We’ll see.  I do like the idea of making a boat load and freezing them.

Dough was very sticky so it took much more flour than suggested to knead it before I could cut out the biscuits without them being so sticky. Noticed other reviewers said not to twist or turn the cutter or the biscuits would be dense. Followed that advice but biscuits turned out dense and flat anyway. Will not be making again.

Thanks for all the hints everyone, it's been years since I made biscuits from scratch and these turned out fabulous! I grated frozen butter as several folks suggested.

Nice simple biscuit.  I brushed a little milk on the top before baking and they came out so golden and crunchy on the outside but fluffy on the inside.

I'm a Southern girl, so biscuits are a known institution! We have tried A LOT of biscuit recipes, searching for that perfect one. This is our go-to, the one we come back to over and over. It is the perfect biscuit - flavorful, flaky and well-risen. We do make a couple of adjustments: we use a stick of chilled butter (that we then grate with our grater) in place of shortening and adjust the salt to 1t instead of 1/2t. Just a personal preference but the biscuit recipe is great as is too!

Everyone loved them. Thank you... will definitely make them again.

followed recipe perfectly as it is the first time I've tried this particular recipe. it didn't rise 1 little bit! it was chewy....but tasted great! My family....bless them, ate them! Now I'm 65 yr. old retired housewife and I have baked most of my life, I have experience and common sense! I'm starting my xmas baking so my ingredients are fresh. I'm not leaving a rating because I don't want this person to lose points because of something I did. would love suggestions....just tried to post and apparently I need to rate it gave it a 5

I love these! So quick and easy. I've made them so many times I've just about committed the recipe to memory. I use organic shortening and it works beautifully as long as you don't over handle the dough.

Sooo good! Like others I used butter instead of shortening, grating it in. I also needed a bit more milk (1 cup). I patted it into a rectangle, sprinkled flour on top and folded the rectangle over, and repeated this 4 times before cutting out the biscuits. 

This recipe gave me the best result I've ever had with bp biscuits - thanks so much!

I have used this recipe more times than I can count and it is always amazing. I never roll the dough out I have always used it as drop biscuit and it works amazing. I have even used it for dumplings in soup and fantastic results every time.

Yummy biscuits every time.  I have struggled to make biscuits all my life, probably because my mom's were so fabulous.  But with the suggestions here, grating the butter into the flour, I am mastering these babies.  This recipe is terrific.  I am only giving 4 stars because I think they have a bit too much butter in them.  I do not use shortening.  About 5 tbs is better for me.  Now I'm going to eat the ones that are cooling beside me.

The only change I made was adding about 1/4 cup of sugar.  This was a quick and easy recipe.

They came out just the way I wanted. Taste great,  fluffy and flakey. I don't need to look any further. PS. part of the secret is cold shortening.

We've made several batches of this recipe over the last day for Chicken a la King and biscuits with sausage gravy. It's a nice biscuit, exactly as expected. Easy to make.

I used butter instead of shortening and it worked so well. My husband complimented me on these (he's a really good cook, I am not so much). The only complaint I have is that the amount of milk made the dough too moist. I had to add more flour to make the dough workable. I will still give the recipe 5 stars because it was so good.

I gave this recipe only three stars because there were a few instructions that were left out and I did almost everything wrong.  In spite of that it came out ok.  After reading reviews I discovered it was ok to use butter but should have used it very cold.  I had warmed it up slightly so it would mix well.  I chose not to roll to 1/2" but  hand shaped to about 3/4 inch.  The point is not NOT overwork the dough to keep tender.  I also didn't use all the liquid suggested and had to cook them about five minutes longer than directed to get a good golden color.   They would have been a gloppy mess with 3/4 c. milk.  In spite of all that, they rose, tasted good and were tender enough.  They would have been more flaky if I had not softened the butter.

I finally made a delicious biscuit! I brushed mine with butter before baking. I made 6 giant ones - it took about 20 minutes or more, but they came out great. They are so delicate. I keep my shortening refrigerated so I used a giant grater and used my scale to measure out 3.6 ounces. (I googled how much a half cup of shortening weighs - glad I didn’t go with my first instinct of weighing out 4 ounces which is normally a half cup.)

8.10.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/20075/basic-biscuits/ ...  No milk so went with 1c plain yogurt mixed with 1/2c water.  Yeah, I'm daring.  ;D  My usual recipe is best at 425 so I baked these at 425 for 13 mins.  'Woulda been better at 450.  'Just when I think I know something ... nope.

Made a tweaked version of this recipe,  in place  of the shorting, I cut in 1/2c cold salted butter cut into small  pieces and using my hands I bleaded it together until the dough was holding together and there wasn't any flour in the bottom of the bowl.  From there I kneaded the dough on a lightly floured surface and then it went back into the bowl and covered with saran wrap and allowed to rest for approximately 15 minutes,  then I began rolling it out to my preferred thickness,  and using a standard drinking glass, I cut out the biscuits, (repeating with the remaining dough until dough is used up),  once the biscuits are in the pan brush with an egg wash,now comes the difference  instead of baking in a traditional oven I used my power air fryer and round metal cake pans for 12-14 min, if using more than one cake pan you'll have to switch the pans at the halfway point to allow even cooking. 
(They were the best biscuits I have ever made, they were fluffy, flaky, soft, this is based on my husbands response .)

Loved the recipe turned out amazing. The only change I made was taking half the dough and mixing pre shredded cheddar cheese from Costco into it. These turned out great as well and were good just plain. Overall the biscuits were amazing, they crumbled and had a great taste to the point where I just scarfed them down plain. Definitely going to make them again. Hope this helps!

I used King Arthur's measure for measure gluten free flour to make it for my mom, I also used almond milk, they turned out fine, they just didn't rise like picture. I might continue playing with it to make it suitable to our needs, but otherwise, perfect recipe!

I've made these many times, and for a vegan friend I've substituted the milk in the recipe with water once (adding 1/2 tsp baking soda if removing the milk) and, most recently, orange juice, and they were delicious.

I used this recipe as a quick “oh no I’m out of Bisquick” moment. I of course had expired shortening in my pantry (7days old) so I substituted for 1/2c of butter instead. I always use a tad less salt than is ever required. The first thing my son said after biting into his was “these taste like saltines” ... but he was okay with that and said they were good. They worked fine for my sausage gravy but I think I’ll let them rest a little longer before baking them next time.  And maybe brush some butter on top for a little added flavor. Good basic biscuit recipe overall.

Used this recipe very last minutes for biscuits and gravy! 
I cut my cold butter into tiny squares. Stuck the butter in the freezer on a plate, as well as my kitchen aid mixing bowl. Prepared the dry ingredients. Pulled the items out of the freezer. I used the wisk attachment to cut the butter into the flour mix. Cover the mixer with a towel. Some larger chunks still remained. Add milk until just barely combined and turned it out on to my work surface. Used a glass to roll it out and to cut my biscuits. Worked wonderfully!!!!!

I changed it up and put half shortening and the other half cold butter cubes. Then I added buttermilk instead of milk. They came out really fluffy and good w/sausage gravy, eggs, and grits.

Great recipe for beginners like me, only change I made was using buttered flavored Crisco and baked in muffin tins since I didn't have a biscuit cutter. Also brushed with actual melted butter. I didn't nit at all, just used a spatula to combine ingredients. My shortening was not cold at all and they were still fluffy, flaky and delicious!!

I absolutely love this recipe. It's my go-to biscuit recipe and is insanely easy and flakey. I've made it with coconut oil sometimes and it gives it a great nutty flavor, too.

Should be thicker.  Found them to be tasty but a bit dense.  1/2" thickness is too thin.

I followed the recipe swapping grated butter for shortening and buttermilk for milk. I also added 1 teaspoon of sugar to add to the flavor. I didn't over work the dough and brushed the tops with melted butter before baking and after they came out; they turned out perfect. My husband says these are some of the best he's had for making chicken, sausage  or ham biscuits. That's saying something since I have been making biscuits for him for 35 years and he loved them. These are now my go to recipe when I plan on a sandwich biscuit.

Instead of 1/2 cup shortening,  use 1 cup of cold butter (2 sticks) 
Use 3/4 cup of buttermilk instead of white milk.
Do not twist the cutter. Twisting the cutter prevents them from rising.

If you add 1/2 cup of grated cheddar, you'll be lucky to get one for yourself before they all disappear.

This was great! My son has a dairy allergy so I substituted coconut milk for the regular milk and well, I like butter, so I substituted vegan butter sticks for the shortening. My wife told me I had to save this recipe cuz it is great!

Very very very bland. If you read the reviews most people have altered the recipe using butter. The reason is- they’re flavorless.  I made he first batch and tossed them. Having limited ingredients I made a second one and used melted butter instead of milk and doubled the salt.They were ok this way.   Why do people drastically change a recipe and rate it 4/5 stars? You’re supposed to rate the recipe AS IS.

I added a dollop of butter to the shortening called for & brushed the tops with melted butter before putting them in the oven.  My Pampered Chef Baking Stone did a great job for flakey, evenly browned biscuits. Step aside, Martha! LOL

Next time I think we will use Self-Rising flour instead and see what that does. They taste really good but they barely got much higher than essentially being biscuit sized crackers. I though maybe my flour was old but No, it's still good and all the other ingredients were fresh too. I'll just have to play with the recipe.

Perfect recipe for basic biscuits. I made them in a cast iron skillet in the oven. They did take about 13 to 14 minutes vs. 10 to cook but turned out awesome. Very light and fluffy, lightly browned on top.  I didn't have a problem with them rising but most of the time I don't get a huge rise on my biscuits anyway. They turned out just right.

These turned out pretty good!  Very basic, that's for sure.  I actually halved the recipe, since it's just my husband and me.  I also added a splash of vinegar to the milk, kinda like turning it into buttermilk.  The biscuits were a bit on the crumbly side, maybe I needed to knead the dough?  They didn't rise terribly high, either.  Maybe halving the recipe isn't a good idea. Biscuits definitely aren't my forte, but these were pretty good.

If you always use a soft wheat flour like White Lily or King Arthur you will have pillow soft biscuits every time. That's what us southern girls use and your friends WILL be jealous they can't make delicious biscuits that come out light and fluffy like yours.  Hard wheat is grown everywhere in the US except the south and that's the true secret to making the lightest and fluffiest biscuits on earth.

Good tasting biscuits! I baked it for about 5 minutes longer since the top of the biscuit wasn't really the color I liked. The biscuits didn't rise as much as I would've liked either so I'll add more baking powder next time.

This was an awesome, easy recipe that I could spontaneously make with ingredients that were already in my home. I was trying to figure out where I could use a pound of Jimmy Dean maple sausage that had been sitting in the fridge for a few days and decided on biscuits and gravy. The biscuits turned out flaky, light and well cooked. I did put them in for 8 minutes though just to be on the safe side.

My first time making biscuits and they turned out perfectly! I substituted shredded butter for shortening like some commenters recommended, and the biscuits had the best fluffy texture for eating with good ol' honey and butter. My British roommate is finally convinced biscuits > scones.

The biscuit took a lot longer to bake then ten minutes and they were not as sweet as I had hoped. However, saying that they were still perfect to go with some jam and as a side.

Followed recipe using the stick shortening flavored with butter flavoring. Turned out great! Family loved it! Also brushed with butter right before putting in oven. : ) 
Also didn’t sift flour. : )

I made it 2x so far the first time following the recipe to the T. The second time  I used 1/4 C shortening and 1/4C butter, and substituted buttermilk for the whole milk.  And let me tell  you the were absolutely delicious!

So easy a caveman can do it.

Use a cube of butter instead of shortening.

Pretty good  easy to follow biscuit recipe.  Instead of shortening, I added cold shredded butter. The biscuits came out soft and flakey. I'll definitely make these again.  Thanks!

Easy to follow and they turned out great, a nice golden brown on top as well as on the bottom. I think they taste better than some other homemade biscuits that I have made.

I always read the reviews but didn’t this time.   Biscuits didn’t rise but after reading reviews I think I know what to fix next time!  Overall they were tasty and easy.  I think the biggest problem was my inexperience at baking so I look forward to making them again with more baking powder, less handling and being careful not to twist my cutter.

Was low on ingredients so I needed something simple and easy. Turned out wonderful! Second time I made it I made a double batch and made cinnamon rolls out of half. Only thing I did different the second time around was double the salt because I felt it needed a bit more for my taste.

This may be a very old-fashioned recipe.  When I cut the shortening into the flour I found I needed and extra 1Tbs. of shortening.  My mother used to insist I sift the flour BEFORE I measure (which I didn't do).  When you sift the flour you add volume making 2 cups more like 2 1/2 cups.  Sift your flour first! Delicious, but thin. I will try 3/4" as someone else suggested next time.

Despite forgetting to add salt, this recipe is very good. I look for texture first as flavor can be fixed more or less easily adding or reducing salt. I replaced the shortening for cold unsalted butter. I must say that they were very fluffy and moist inside. Now, good biscuits are more about the process than anything else IMO. I agree with many others in that there are key things to consider when making biscuits. My key things to keep in mind are the following: Do use VERY cold butter. Do NOT manipulate (knead) the dough too much. The heat of the hands will melt the butter and kneading modifies the gluten leading to the undesired hard biscuit. I prefer to pat the dough into a rectangle and fold it into two creating 3 layers. Then, pat it again into a rectangle 1/2"-3/4" thick. Repeat two more times and no more. When using the remnant, pat it again into a rectangle and don't do the folding step. Just cut the biscuits. Arrange them with edges sticking together and if you wish brush with milk or butter before baking. Keep an eye on them until you obtain your desired golden color. These important considerations should give you a biscuit that is fluffy on the inside with a nice golden crust. If you bake them straight out of the freezer (they freeze well) then bake them up to an average time of 15 minutes or less. EDIT: Made this recipe again with a substitution of leavening agent. I used 4tsp of baking powder and 1/2tsp of cream of tartar. Used same procedure and the result was ex

Very versatile! I was out of some ingredients and it didn't hurt the flavor ! Changes listed: 
1st batch - 1 TBS dry milk, 3/4 C water, spectrum organic shortening. Came out too salty. 
2nd batch - 1 TBS dry milk, 3/4 C water 1/2 C semi soft butter, 1/4 tsp salt. Came out great ! 
3rd batch - 1 TBS dry milk, 3/4 C water, 1/2C spectrum organic shortening 1/4 tsp salt. Came out great.

These make a great fluffy biscuit and they are very easy to make. Instead of shortening I used butter.  I did not have a pastry blender and the fork did not work very well so I just used my hands! Thanks for this great biscuit recipe!

The biscuits turned out wonderful. They were buttery,  flavorful, and had layers. Although, the recipe does fail to note many tips. You should make it like you do pastries: freeze the butter, let your dough rest in the freezer for 45min, and layer your dough. Also, best if you double baking powder, along with a little extra salt for extra flavor. Definitely would recommend.

Man these are good biscuits, I used tips from several commenters to make them better:

1. Butter instead of  shortening (Same measure) The tip  about grating the frozen butter works great also, it's bit messy on the grating hand but....whatever. The butter gets uniformly blended with the flour

2. FRESH Baking powder, they were great with my old baking powder, but fresh?  WOW.

3. Add 1/4 cup white granulated sugar to the recipe.  When I 
 first read that tip, it sounded like too much so every time I made them I slowly worked up to 1/4 cup.  Perfect.

4. Twist vs Press: I use a flowered glass as a biscuit cutter, don't twist press straight down.  I tried both ways (by accident) Truly makes a difference.

5. Dough Thickness:  I make the dough roughly 1" think, I only get 6 biscuits but they look perfect

6. Milk:  I normally use 2% milk, this last time I used half 2% milk and half "Half & Half".  Didn't notice any difference, not worth the expense.

7. This is my own observation - Don't bake them too low in the oven, in my case the bottom browns much sooner than the top and is too crusty. In my electric oven I put them on a foil lined cookie sheet on the  third shelf setting or about 10" from the heating element.

Thanks again to lenihan5 for posting this recipe.

These biscuits turned out great, even though I realized halfway through I didn't have any shortening. I used butter and they are still flaky and delicious. Perfect for butter and honey with our dinner. 

Not many recipes I find on the internet make it into my recipe box, but this one did. Simple ingredients, easy to whip together quickly, and yummy taste.

Love this recipe! I substituted butter for the shortening and put the butter in the freezer for a bit before mixing it in. This is an easy, no fuss, minimal ingredient recipe that is delicious. I recommend it for bakers at any level.

This didn't really work out for me.  I used butter instead of shortening and skim milk instead of regular but the mix seemed really dry.  I cut my butter in like normal, milk was really cold, and baking powder was fresh I'm not sure what went wrong.  The mix was really dry and then the biscuits didn't really rise.  I halved the recipe since I was just cooking for 1, it made about 6 small biscuits, but like I said not very good.  Wouldn't make this again.

these were amazing!! Just a few adjustments though. First , I used butter instead of shortening. Also, A little more flour because dough was kind of sticky. One thing though is that these only  make about 8 biscuits not 10 servings.

This was my very first time making biscuits.  They turned out tasty and the only change I will make next time is rolling them out a little thicker and only leaving them in the oven 8 instead of 10 minutes.  A beginners mistake, but will definitely try again.

Use a stick of (frozen) butter in place of the shortening for flaky buttery biscuits. I used my food processor to mix the dry ingredients and the butter, then transferred to a bowl to add the milk. Mix only until it comes together for nice fluffy biscuits and don't twist the cutter.

If you're having trouble getting your biscuits to rise try using an extra teaspoon of baking powder.  It doesn't affect the flavor and it works. The first time I made these they were pretty flat. Tonight was second time making them and they turned out so nice my husband told me they were better than his mom's.

As a newbie to baking, it would have been helpful if the recipe described how to "cut in" the butter.  I tried a combination of actually cutting through with two knives, and then used a fork when the first method proved to take much longer than expected.  I made what I now know is a HUGE mistake and accidentally used whole wheat all purpose flour.  I was making these for tomorrow's eggs benedict.  They do not look anything like the pictures so I will redo the recipe in the morning with regular all purpose.  Thankfully, I halved the recipe since there are only 4 of us and since this was my first attempt.

Great basic recipe! Don't overwork the dough, and don't twist when you cut out the biscuits. Flaky and delicious.

Easy biscuits! Good for breakfast !! They are not as good as 7-up biscuits are but they are what you need for biscuits and gravey  for sure ! !!! These are easy and simple.  Wish the recipe said to use cold butter so they can be flaky! Also don’t twist when cutting out dough will prevent rising !!

I've been trying for literally decades to make good biscuits and these are the ones. I was out of milk, so I used 1/4 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of water in lieu of the 3/4 cup of milk. I kneeded the dough and I also used a larger glass (than normally) to cut 9 large biscuits. They were light, fluffy beautiful- I barely had time to snap a pic of the last two.

For me this recipe made 14 biscuits and I only baked them 11mins. I used butter instead of shortening. I used a glass just under 2.5 in round to cut out. I also sifted the dry ingredients. We measured presisely 1/2in thick when rolling out. It helps for them to be that thickness if you like thick biscuits and these puffed up nicely . Great quick and fun recipe to make with my special needs 11yo!

I used self-rising flour, added cider vinegar to the milk, & used margarine instead of shortening. They didn't rise as much as I had hoped so the next batch I will add some baking powder. I will definitely make this again!

These were SO easy to make (fun too) and taste amazing with a healthy dollop of butter on top! Followed the recipe to a T, but one thing to add! When you're cutting them into circles, DON'T TWIST THE CUTTER! This will seal the edges and make it so your biscuits don't rise! Also: cook for exactly ten minutes or more: no less! These are SO yummy, and my family loved them. Great recipe!

Not sure what I did wrong, but oh was it wrong.  Made these for the first time for a birthday dinner, my first mistake.  And as nice as the birthday boy was about it, they were inedible.  Looked great, tasted like way too much baking soda.  Threw most in the trash.

I didn't think I could make biscuits from scratch, but these came out great.  Very easy.  I didn't have a biscuit cutter, so I cut the top off a soda can and punched a hole in the bottom.  I have to remember not to overwork the dough, or the biscuits don't rise as much.

They came out very light and fluffy, I used 1/2 cup of cold butter instead of the shortening. Maybe next time I will use a little bit less salt, they were a little bit on the salty side. Other than that they came out very good.

Must try! I made mine as cheesy garlic biscuits and it turned out great. Things I did different, I added garlic powder to the dry ingredients, I grated cold butter into it and added shredded cheese. I also did not roll or cut them out, more of a drop biscuit. I made a butter, garlic powder and parsly topping to brush over them before sticking in the oven. Golden brown out side moist flavorful inside and I've already eaten 4 of the 6! Quick easy yummy

The flavor was good, but these are some sadly flat biscuits. I've made scones with more volume and less raising agent.
Also, add a touch of sugar so they brown before they burn

I substitute a half of the shortening with cold grated butter for a better, lighter flavor, added the milk,  then gently rolled it out to less than half an inch. I cut perfect little circles with a small glass, and baked for 12 minutes. They rose almost 3 time so in size! They taste great, but I wish I had added just a little more butter.

I used dry buttermilk  (mixed with 3/4 cup water) and 1/2 tsp. of sugar. Topped with butter last 3 minutes. Wonderful and so worth it. Next time I will add grated sharp cheddar in the mix.

I used butter. Not bad tasting, and nice and flaky. But did not rise and looked like round "biscuit cookies". So, ok recipe but not one if you want small, round, thick breakfast biscuits.

I made the recipe as pretty much as directed, using butter instead of shortening.  Adding the full 3/4 cup of milk makes a very wet dough - couldn't use biscuit cutters, so I used my trusty pizza cutter and made squares.  I had to use a lot of extra flour on my board and on top of the biscuits to be able to cut them and transport them to the baking pan.  That said, the biscuits themselves were quite good - higher and fluffier than anything I'd made before.  They had a pleasant taste, but not the complex flavor of butter milk biscuits.  Will make these again.

I made these biscuits and I followed the directions, but I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of shortening, however, they did not rise the way the picture showed they would, and they tasted like salt and flour.  What could I have done wrong?

Delicious and easy. As others have said, be gentle in cutting them--don't twist--and keep the dough a little thicker than recommended. Mine was about 3/4".

These were really good and super easy. I used butter instead if shortening. I'll definitely make these again.

I loved the fact that it was soooo easy to make!  We make our own sausage gravy for over biscuits, however I found us completely out of the biscuits we usually use (store bought). So I went straight to Allrecipes for a recipe.  This was everything I was looking for....only I should have made a double batch.  These sure made our 4th of July breakfast special as we had made it all from scratch.  I will be making these again!

This is  a very good biscuit recipe that I will use again. I think it would be good to let the biscuit dough sit for a while after the biscuit shapes are cut  so that they can rise more before baking.

I usually make drop biscuits off allrecipes because they're quick, easy, & I was always intimidated by biscuits. These were my first attempt and wow, they turned out amazing! 
Great flavor and texture. I mixed them as little as possible so they wouldn't toughen up and then folded them a couple times so they'd have some layers. At 450 I had to cook them for 13 mins til they were brown on top but these are great and my new go to for biscuits and gravy!

Turned out beautifully. The pre biscuit information was the best and the reason I tried biscuits after so many years. The folding instead of traditional kneading made the layers.

They were delicious! Just a little bit too salty for my taste, so I will reduce this a little bit next time. I also used cold butter - cut in little cubes - instead of shortening. They came out just perfect: crunchy on the outside and super soft on the inside. Will be making these again and again!

I normally don't rate when I don't use exact ingredients but these were great regardless. 
 I substituted 1/2 cup (stick) of butter when I couldn't locate the shortening  and the Biscuits came out great!
 They rose very well and took exactly 10 minutes in the oven.

This is really a 4.5 star recipe. The biscuits I made were fantastic. The only actual change I made was the addition of 1 tbsp sugar (or even 1 tsp.)

 What knocks the rating down for me are some missing details. They are both fairly basic baking tricks but if, like me, you don't bake often you may have either not encountered them or forgotten them. Fortunately I read a number of other Comments. 

#1 use cold shortening. Since it's stored at room temperature I cut mine into 1/2 inch or so pats then throw it in the freezer for about 10 minutes. or you could store it in the fridge. A big part of the shortening's role in this recipe is to evaporate away leaving a flaky, crumbly biscuit. It gets warmer as you work it. If it becomes too líquid it will be absorbed too much into the flour resulting in flatter denser biscuits. Starting with cold shortening gives you a bit of a safety cushion. This is also why you use a pastry mixer or a fork instead of a hand or stand mixer.

#2 don't twist the cutter when you cut the biscuit. Twisting the cutter ends up sealing the sides of the biscuit. Again you want the moisture from the shortening to evaporate away. Sealing the sides leaves no where for the moisture to escape to. The resulting moisture leaves the biscuit denser and much less crumbly. I squish the last bits of my dough into round biscuit shapes and sure enough these ones don't rise well. 

A quick google search will turn up a number of videos. Watching someone make the same basic

4-4-2017  ~There are thin biscuits (roll dough to 1/2” thick) and there are thick, tall biscuits (roll dough to 1” thick).  The taste of these (thin) biscuits was there for sure (I could have eaten the whole darn batch), but with this recipe I’ve confirmed I like thick biscuits better, if for no other reasons than for eye appeal and the ability to slice or break these apart into nice thick halves.  (In other words, there’s no way you’d make a sausage, egg and biscuit breakfast sandwich out of these!) Bottom line?  If you want to try these basic biscuits my suggestion would be to roll out your dough to 1” thickness.

As is usually the case with comments on Allrecipes, we change something in this - but for good reason.  Our daughter is allergic to cows milk. So we use soy milk for this recipe for a dairy free biscuit.  They turn out great!

Definitely do not twist the cutter or they won't rise.  Push down and then pull back up.  If the biscuit sticks in the cutter, flick it onto the pan or gently push it out.  Then flour the cutter and use again.

The biscuits are simple but tasty.  Not a butter bomb or too heavy.  They have a light butteryish taste though there are no butter ingredients, and a slight saltiness.

Our family loves these and they're so easy to make!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made several different biscuit recipes and this one is by far the easiest and the results are delicious! I used cold butter and a little extra baking powder. Delish!

Threw them to the birds. WAY too much shortening I hope they don't kill the poor things because they were nasty. I have been making bread and biscuits for 40 years this was the worst recipe I ever tried.  Two cups flour does not need 1/2 cup shortening what was I thinking.

I've made this recipe twice. The first time came out really bad but I think I handled the dough to much and used room temp shortening. The second time came out way better and I made sure not to handle it much and I also substituted the shortening for cold grated butter. They came out perfect!

Will make again! Very easy to make, and got rave reviews from my mom and dad. First time making biscuits, and these came out great! Could use a little flavoring, and it is a bit dry, but nothing a little honey can't fix!

Tender inside with a little crunchiness on the outside. I halved this and got six biscuits. I used 1/4 cup of frozen butter that I grated into the flour mixture.  I'm thinking I would like a little sugar added to this, as well. Nice recipe!

It turned out really well! I took the advice of the reviews below and used 1/2 cup of grated cold butter instead of shortening. I also used bread flour instead of all-purpose, which worked out well! The biscuits that risen better are the ones I kneaded more as I was trying to get more of the dough fit into the cutter. Yielded perfectly 10 biscuits.

Easy peasy. Followed the advice of another reviewer and used grated frozen butter in placed of the shortening.  I did this by: first sifting all the dry ingredients together, then lighting mixing the milk in by hand with a plastic spatula, then I used a fine grater and grated in the butter stopping as my arm got tired and blending it in by hand gently until lightly combined.  Being careful to not to over mix.  You really just need to lightly combine all ingredients.  Rolled out the dough on the counter with some extra flour and DID NOT work it cut the biscuits without twisting the cutter (another review tip to help rise).  They turned out light and fluffy.  Perfect for biscuits and gravy or just with some jelly.  This will be my new go to recipe!! Thank you!

Classic baking powder biscuit recipe.  It can be made using shortening, with or without butter flavoring; margarine or butter, depending on your own taste.  Using buttermilk makes them perfect!  Biscuits are best if you don't overwork the dough!  Don't try too hard and you can produce biscuits as light and delicious as the ones that your Grandmother made!

These are really good, simple basic biscuits. I use butter instead of shortening....and don't roll them out, just drop from a teaspoon.....makes about 17 biscuits. Great for sausage gravy and biscuits!

Perfect quick biscuit recipe. I used Crisco butter flavor for the shortening and they turned out great. Instead of rolling I just patted the dough out and sliced into 12 squares then molded them when I placed them on the cookie sheet to bake.

These taste awesome but they didn't rise well.  They're more like little flatbreads.  I am unsure if it's the recipe or my baking powder... Will try again.

This is my Go-To recipe for biscuits.  Super easy and very good.  My picky husband likes these also...I have tried so many recipes for biscuits and so glad to finally find one that is awesome...can't say enough about this recipe!  I already knew to use very cold butter and not twist the cutter.  The only change I make is to use a wide mouth canning jar lid as a cutter.  Makes a nice large biscuit!  I also put down waxed paper , lightly floured, before rolling them out.  Makes clean up so easy, just wrap up the paper and toss it away...

The biscuits were light and crumbly; baked up beautifully.  I used buttermilk to give additional flavor,  unsalted butter as my shortening, and brushed them with butter (unsalted) before baking.  However some of the reviewers were right about the flavor, a bit bland.  I made them again using 1 tsp. rather than 1/2 tsp. salt: I used salted butter for shortening, and brushed with melted salted butter.  Much, much more flavor.

Great recipe! Biscuits were light and fluffy, and rose just right. I used kosher salt, and next time I will use regular table salt because I don't think the kosher salt dispersed enough, and mine weren't salty enough.

I will have to make these again, so I can better rate them. I was in a hurry and didn't check the amount of baking power that was called for. I only used one tsp, instead of one Tablespoon. I couldn't understand why they didn't raise like they should have! They still tasted pretty good! I will try them again!

These tasted wonderful! Crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. Made these to go with some homemade chicken soup and they were a hit. I was rushed for time and I don't think all my ingredients were exact measurements but these turned out wonderful.

They were easy to make. They just seemed to lack something. They cook up just a bit, and work well with gravy.

They were just ok. Made with butter because I just don't like cooking with shortening. Very buttery and flaky but flavor didn't go very far. Husband said the bottom was like a cracker. It was just missing something. Will not make again.

I make this with butter flavored shortening, then baste with salted butter after they've baked. The best biscuits I've ever tasted. Adding this to the family recipe box.

Followed the recipe but something clearly went wrong.  The taste was bland and the  texture was powdery.  Maybe my baking soda was stale?

Great staple recipe to have in a pinch. I read through the reviews and took the advice of grating cold butter (great hack!)
I didn't have baking powder on hand so I replaced it with baking soda and apple cider vinegar. I, also added some sage and rosemary for a little spice. 
They turned out wonderful for a first time/last minute breakfast addition. Next time I plan to roll the dough a little thicker, the biscuits fluffed up beautifully but are on the thinner side. In addition to that, next time I'll bake for 8 minutes, check and reassess as they turned a little crispy with the full 10 minutes. Overall, easy things to tweak and I'm happy with the end result and even moreso is my partner. Sunday Mornings

This is a great base for any type of biscuits you may want to make. I use this recipe all the time! 20 mins tops and you have fresh biscuits ready to eat. I prefer to use butter when I make this recipe but it turns out just as good with the shortening. I often add different ingredients to this recipe to make it different depending on what we are eating it with. Our favourite would have to be 1 cup sharp cheddar cheese and a couple diced jalapeño peppers. Also very good with 1 cup raisins added, or  3/4 cup sharp cheddar cheese and 1/4 cooked ham, or roasted garlic to your liking. Honestly this is such a good recipe you can almost add a cup of any mix of your choice. I will keep making this recipe for years to come. I already know it by heart that's how much I make it! I would and do recommend this recipe to everyone.

To be fair, I did use the exact recipe. I used butter as suggested by some other reviewers and buttermilk because I had some that I wanted to use up. These were delicious, but  did not rise much at all. I will definitely try this again because it could have been my baking powder or my technique.

Pretty good, though I made some changes - grated a stick of frozen butter, added a wee amount of sugar, and used a cask iron skillet to bake, as well as I rolled it manually in my hands -  old school style.  They were pretty good and my daughter nearly ate them all....I'll be saving this recipe.

I was Iooking for a recipe similar to one I lost that was from a bag of flour years ago. This seemed to match it and was very easy to make. Just remember not to overwork the dough when you are ready to roll it out. They came out great.

I did use grated butter as suggested. I rolled my dough too thin & probably mixed it too much. But they still tasted great. And the next day, warming up in the microwave they tasted like I just pulled them out the oven. My hubby loved them. I will definitely make again.

I made these and only altered slightly. I have found that if you mix the flour, baking powder, salt, and use room-temp butter instead of shorting and work it into the dough until you get a grainy meal and THEN stick the butter-incorporated flour mix into the fridge for 1 hour before you add the milk the biscuits come out perfectly and have a nice subtle buttery flavor. I have even used this and I rolled it out in two 9 inch disks for a "Breakfast Pie" recipe and as long as you prebake the crust with pie weights at the same temp but half the time of the biscuit recipe you have a super delicious and homemade biscuit crust for any occasion.

Great recipe! Easy and quick. I used it for monkey bread to avoid using the Pillsbury refrigerated biscuit dough. I followed the Pillsbury monkey bread recipe but upped the temp to 435 degrees (recipe called for 350). Baked for about 30 minutes.

These turned out great, texture-wise. It was my first time making biscuits, so I'm glad I followed the tip not to twist when I cut the biscuits. I didn't have a  rolling pin or a cutter, but patting it out with my hands and using a floured glass rim worked just fine. My only problem with this recipe is that the biscuits were rather flavorless. I think next time, I will make using butter, or at least butter-flavored shortening.

These came out great. My 1st time making homemade biscuits so I checked the reviews for tips. I followed the recipe but I used butter flavored shortening instead. I also followed the tips on making sure the milk and shortening was really cold. And to not twist biscuit cutter (I used a cup). I made them just to practice but we all sat around last night and ate biscuits & jelly!

Delicious! I used frozen, grated butter and made buttermilk from heavy cream and vinegar because I didn't have any on hand. Who knew you could make delicious biscuits without shortening? Yum!

Took advantage of some of the previous reviews.  Used grated cold butter.  Also used dried buttermilk mix, stirred into flour, then used water as liquid.  I was very careful not to twist cutter.  Biscuits turned out very light and flaky.  Good for old fashioned strawberry shortcake.  This is my go to biscuit recipe.

quick and easy biscuits.  I didn't have time to cut the cold butter in, so I just softened it in the microwave (not melted, softened). Came out great.

Great basic recipe, used organic spelt, which is heavier flour so used two tablespoons of baking powder, also spelt is dryer, so used 1 and 1/8 cup of raw milk,  1/2 cup Amish roll butter.  Great taste and rose nicely. So easy to make! Broke cold butter up in flour with fingers. Just mix milk in with spoon.

This recipe was so easy which is nice because I don't want to have to mix a million things and the biscuits were really good. I used butter instead of shortening. :) Would recommend.

I added 2 TSP of sugar, grated butter in and brushed butter on top. I did find it a little dry so i used an extra TBSP of milk and it was perfect.  I cut the dough with a cup rubbed in butter. I didn't have time to roll so I just patted it out to about 1/2 inche and then cut straight down with a cup. They turned out perfect.  I made these to eat with sausage gravy and it was excellect! I did 3 stars because I felt the original recipe wouldnt have produced this biscuit.

I am the world's worst biscuit maker - until now.  These turned out perfect.  Light, flaky and fine-textured instead of my usual hockey pucks.  My husband noticed immediately without being prompted.  Thanks for the recipe and the tips.

I followed other reviewers suggestions and used cold butter instead of shortening. Also for fun I used a flower cookie cutter instead of round and my daughter loved them! Will definitely make these again!!

I have made these a couple of times, one of those I used margarine because I realized I was out of shortening after I was started. They are a solid no fail basic recipe. I add a cup of shredded cheddar cheese and a half cup of diced ham to make our favourite flavour but you can also add whatever else you have on hand to make other flavours (raisins, brown sugar, cinnamon) or (onion flakes, savory, garlic powder) etc ***NOTE - had a craving for pizza but had run out of yeast, so I used this for a pizza dough. Impressive results.

Very simple and easy to make. Better than Alton Browns recipe. Family loved it. I rated it a 4 because, as my children say, I'm hard to please. But I really liked this recipe.

Great biscuit! I typically use buttermilk or soured milk (1/2 lemon & milk mixture ... juice 1/2 lemon into your measuring cup, fill with milk until at 3/4 C. and let sit). Also, I shred the butter using a cheese grater .... and use fold/roll method 4-5 times for a super flaky biscuit.

Great, reliable recipe. I generally make it with margarine (and less salt to compensate) as well as whole wheat flour. Adding 1/4 cup extra milk easily transforms these rolled biscuits into equally good drop biscuits!

These came out soooo good! I won't be making Pillsbury biscuits anytime soon. The only things I will tweak next time will be to use buttermilk for a more rich flavor and a little vinegar for a flaky crust. I recommend this recipe.

Just made it tonight. Turned out great and better than buttermilk biscuits I have made in the past. This is a keeper.
I used butter, cut it into little pieces, froze it, then added to the flower. Nice buttery taste.

I have made these biscuit numerous times and always a hit. In an effort to make these like my grandma's homemade biscuits (mmm...memories!) I substitute buttermilk. Of course I never have buttermilk just on hand so quick substitute options are: two table spoons of apple cider vinegar mixed with the milk and allowed to sit or drinkable Kefir.

Really awesome!  I had to add a little extra milk, fyi. And followed another  member's tip about grating the butter- i found it easier than cutting with a pastry cutter.  :)

These tasted pretty good, but did not rise at all.  I made another recipe today which had added baking powder, and used the folding 4-5 times technique and they rose significantly. and had nice layers.  These had good flavor though so 3 stars for that, otherwise they were flat.

Only my 2nd time making biscuits and these turned out SO good!! I swapped the shortening for cold butter and it turned out great. I also didn't bother rolling them, I just hand shaped them and tried to make them all the same size. Can't wait to make more!! Delicious!!

GREAT BEGINNERS BISCUIT
I cooked them on a lower setting of 350 for about 30 minutes so the would finish around the time my sausage and gravy was done instead of 450 for 10 minutes. I also glazed them with butter half way through as well as when they were finished. Overall as long as the rest of your food is seasoned the biscuits are functional. By themselves they are bland and flavorless. not sure what needs to be added to improve the taste by themselves but something was missing.

These came out perfect. Extremely easy to make and very little mess. I did add time to the baking, about 4 min.

I made these biscuits to accompany a beef stew and they were delicious. The kitchen intimidates me, so I wanted to start with a very basic biscuit and this recipe was it. I read a few of the reviews prior to making the recipe and they provided me with some great hints: make sure your shortening is cold, do not twist your cutter (as it seals the edges and they won't rise as nicely), and...smother them in butter while they are hot. These simple biscuits were a hit with my entire family.

I had not made home made biscuits in years.  I searched this site (love this site) and decided on this particular recipe.  I cut ingredients in half (to test) and I am so pleased!!

Used butter instead of shortening.  Didn't have a cookie cutter or biscuit cutter so I used a pint beer glass and it worked perfectly!

I remember when my grandmother and great aunts would make homemade biscuits for just about every meal.  I've made them a few times but haven't found "the recipe" and I can't remember how my grandmother did and, of course, it isn't written down.  I really loved this recipe as did my teenaged daughter and a friend.  I did follow the suggestion by Julie of grating cold butter (I didn't have shortening) and it was super simple and worked great!  Thanks!!!!  My daughter is excited about having biscuits more often.

Updated:  This morning my daughter begged me to make another batch of biscuits.  I hadn't even had my first cup of coffee but they are fairly quick and easy.  I also followed the suggestion of making them touch together so that they rise a little higher, making them prettier.  Excellent recipe!

Chose these for my attempt at an 'American Breakfast' for the boys.  Had some lovely beef jelly gravy, and we get farm-made herb beef sausages. With plain scrambled eggs from the hens, and a hot green chilli or two this was superb. Will definitely be doing again! X

Good, light and flaky biscuits, when made per recipe. The dough is not near as sticky as some other biscuit recipes can be, therefore it can be easily kneaded and worked by hand and with minimal additional flour. Without rolling and cutting biscuits, they tend to flake a bit more on their kneading folds. The real highlight of this recipe though: it makes amazing dumplings for chicken and dumplings.

I am not a fan of these biscuits.  If you're a person who likes restaurant-style biscuits then these are for you.  I personally prefer pillsbury flaky-style biscuits.  I used chilled butter and they did not turn out flaky at all, they were crumbly and dry.

Made exactly as this recipe states, They did not rise, more like a thick cookie. I'll try the buttermilk biscuits next.
 I will not use this recipe again.

I used a stick of margerine instead of shortening because it is best for the shortening/butter/ margerine to be very cold.  I tested the "Don't twist the cutter" theory and that was, indeed, the only biscuit that didn't rise as much as the others.  They did turn out really good. Soft, flakey, and simple.

I have never made roll out biscuits before just bisquick drop kind or the canned stuff. That was until I found this recipe!!! OMG these are amazing!!! Since I've found this recipe I've tried others but none compare to this one! The only thing I do differently is I use butter instead of shortening. I can never go back to drop or canned biscuits ever again. My family loves these!!

The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I had to change a couple things with this recipe in order for it to turn out really well.  The first time I made these, they tasted very good but did not rise well.  Second time I just changed the shortening to cold butter, like other posters suggested, and grated it into the recipe.  I also made sure that I used a fresher can of baking powder and they turned out perfect this time!  My whole family loved these.

These are quick to make.  I only had bread flour  and Almond milk but used them anyway and the biscuits turned out flakey and delicious!!  My husband told me to keep this recipe, all the biscuits were gone along with the Chili.

Great recipe! I usually substitute 1/2 stick of  cold unsalted butter for 1/2 of the shortening in the recipe and pulse in the food processor rather than using a pastry blender. They consistently come out very light, fluffy, and flavorful.

Perfect basic biscuit recipe.  End result is a nicely risen tasty biscuit!  Had to make biscuits quickly for breakfast and picked this recipe because of the title. (I wasn't in the mood to pull out my recipe collection to find my recipe)   I'm so glad I did.  I'm pretty sure I can remember this without  having to look it up again.  These were great with my sausage gravy.  :)

Great basic biscuit recipe. I used butter instead of shortening and buttermilk instead of milk. If you don’t have buttermilk, simply add 1 tablespoon of vinegar to 1 cup milk and let sit for 5 minutes; Buttermilk in a pinch. I also just throw the dry ingredients into my food processor and pulse to mix then add the butter and pulse some more. Last, add the milk and you guessed it, pulsed until the dough forms. Drop it out onto a floured surface and pat down to 3/4” thick and cut your biscuits out. Don’t over bake!! Set your timer for 8 minutes and check them, I like the biscuits to be just barely baked and 8 minutes was perfect for that.

Biscuits should be simple, but mine never have been.  Then I found this recipe.  I don't know if it was the sifting or the explanation of the procedure,  but I have made this recipe twice and it was perfect and delicious both times.  I did cut back on the salt a bit.  Also the shortening and milk amounts are suggestions.  Just make the dry ingredients look like crumbs and follow the description of how the dough should look when adding milk and it'll come out perfect.

Made this with butter instead of shortening. I put about 3/4 butter, not 1/2. Biscuit was yummy, not too crumbly or dry. Very very easy to make, will make again!

Quick and easy recipe. I split the dough in half and bake some plain to have with jam and the other half I mixed in brown sugar and cinnamon to taste. Great start to my Sunday!!

Followed Julie Russell Whritenour's modifications. Butter instead of shortening (I didn't have any). Didn't knead either. They were the BEST biscuits I have EVER had and I am not a big fan of biscuits to begin with. Thanks to you both!!!

This is my go to biscuit recipe. I make these every time I need biscuits in a hurry. I use butter instead of shortening which works just as good if not better. Very good soft biscuits.

I had to go buy a bigger mixing bowl on account of my carb addicted family requiring me to quadruple the recipe so every one could get enough. Only thing I change is I make them thicker and at the end coat them in melted butter so the tops brown.

This was the first time I have ever made biscuits that tasted truly homemade AND delicious! I used cold butter instead of shortening and rolled a bit thicker than recipe directs. Soft and fluffy on the inside, flaky on the outside. Mmmmmmm!

Great biscuit recipe!  I made this to go with sausage gravy and the biscuits turned out WONDERFUL!  I baked them for right at 8 minutes; I think 1- would have made them a bit hard and dry.  They have a crispy top and bottom and a soft inside with a gentle saltiness.  Perfect flavor for this meal.

This is an excellent recipe! Since most shortening contains soy (which I can't have), I substituted a stick of butter, plus a tablespoon of coconut oil. I accidentally put in a teaspoon of salt instead of half, but they tasted great! The biscuits turned out light and fluffy, and my family loved them! This is a "keeper recipe!"

I used self rising flour instead and it turned out delicious. Especially with butter and honey. I even made them with two cloves of garlic and 1 teaspoon of basil and 1 teaspoon of Rosemary and they tasted fabulous. I recommend self rising flour instead.

I have been trying for a long time to get good biscuits. I have found success with this recipe. They rose really high. I did have to add a little more milk then called for. Served them with sausage gravy. The wife was surprised that the biscuits came out so well. This will be my go to biscuit recipe from now on. Thanks lenihan5.

My first time ever making biscuits, I used this recipe and they came out pretty good. I did substitute butter in place of the shortening, and they were still really flaky. I followed what another person suggested and used cold shredded butter, and barely kneaded the dough.I didn't give it 5 stars BC the biscuits were a tad bit dry.... But I would def make them again maybe with some country gravy!!!! Yum

Tried this tonight for the first time.  They came out perfect!!!  I was so excited, I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have shortening so I used butter instead.  Not only did they rise perfectly, but they were delicious!  No more biscuits out of a can for my family!!!

These are fantastic biscuits! I would however roll the dough a little thicker as they do not rise much.

I was looking for a SIMPLE and QUICK last minute recipe and this was it. The whole family loved them. They were flaky on the outside and moist on the inside. They made perfect hand held breakfast sandwiches.

These turned out pretty good. I cut them into stars, brushed an egg white on the tops and sprinkled crushed rosemary.

This was my first time making biscuits and they turned out great!  I read the comments and grated in cold butter instead of shortening. Stirred in the milk and rolled them out. No kneeding necessary.  They turned out fluffy, soft and moist. Definitely will be using this recipe again! So easy! Doubled the recipe and had to use a cookie cutter to cut them. Ended up with 18 medium sized biscuits.

Wow, one of the simplest and best recipes I've tried so far. I used the ideas of others and used butter, pressed by hand into a rectangle 3/4 inches thick, then "tri-folded" (layered over itself three separate times as I've seen in other recipes, and cut 8 biscuits, let rise 30min, and they turned out amazing! Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

The best biscuits I've had..hands down! I'd never made biscuits unless out of a can or box. This recipe looked simple enough and was easy to follow. I did take a suggestion to grate frozen butter instead of using shortening though. I hardly kneaded, and I did not twist when I used the cutter. I can't see myself using a can or box anymore. Thanks!

Great biscuit recipe! Simple and good flavor. I agree with several other reviewers that replacing the shortening with butter gives this an even better taste. Hint: make sure your baking powder isn't too old.

I only had almond flour and whole wheat flour on hand, so that's what I used (1 cup each). I was afraid they might be too dense, but they were very fluffy and delicious! Great accompaniment to my soup!

Made these tonight by excluding the shortening and using butter instead and they turned out PERFECT! These are light, fluffy biscuits and not at all heavy. They are super easy to make. This was actually my first time making biscuits and couldn't be happier with them. I made a white gravy to put over them and the whole family loved it! These were a big hit tonight. Definitely making again.

Delicious and beautiful!  I doubled the recipe and let it sit in the fridge until the main course was finished. (20 minutes) I also used a hamburger press and they look like cinnamon rolls! The kids loved them. I posted    a pic of the results.  :) Made 5 giant rolls.

Wow I just made homemade biscuits!  And they're delicious!  I subbed butter for the shortening.  I did not have a designated biscuit cutter or round cookie cutter so I cut my dough with an upside down drinking glass.  Turned out perfect!  Don't make the mistake of rolling them too thin...they just don't look right.  The second time rolling out my dough I was a little more conscious of the thickness and consequently those biscuits look more like...biscuits.

OMG!  I had never made a biscuit from scratch in my life and this was too easy.  The biscuits came out down home Southern restaurant fluffy, beautiful, golden brown and tasty.  The key is to grate the butter, don't over knead and trust the process.  I did drizzle a teaspoon of raw natural honey in my batter to temper the salt with just a hint of sweet.

Great recipe. I used mine to top a stew/casserole. I just added a minute or 2 to the bake time and topped them with salt and pepper. They were not gummy on the bottom like the canned ones can be, better than dumplings. My batch made 16, I just re-Kneed the dough cuttings.

This recipe is so simple and makes the perfect biscuit. I use the exact recipe and once the milk goes in I mix it all together and turn it out onto a floured surface. Sometimes I knead, sometimes not. I pat it down to about 1/2 an inch and use a juice glass to cut them...sometimes turning, sometimes not. Never have I made a bad batch. From start to finish it is done in 20 mins and always right on time for dinner.

I have tried this recipe and they didn't turn out at all. The dough was extremely sticky and I had to keep adding flour in order to be able to get them off the floured surface and onto the baking sheet. The didn't rise hardly at all. I am going to try it again and try to figure out what I did wrong. I used butter instead of shortening but another review said butter was substituted for the shortening and they turned out great. Any suggestions?

Never have made any other biscuit than this and is foolproof if you have good baking powder.

I tried this recipe because I didn't have any refrigerated biscuits and we really wanted biscuits and gravy for breakfast. I'm not sure what I did wrong but they were very, very bland and did not rise. My husband said that they looked more like sugar cookies. Next rime I may try with butter instead of shortening and add a little sugar like some of the other reviews had. They were easy to make though.

I loved how these biscuits came out!  I used to make biscuits and tried from what I remember in the past.  I never could get them right!  These came out so nice and flaky, just like I used to remember!  Next time I will do what previous reviews stated and use cold butter and freeze them for future baking!  Yumm! Yumm!

Followed the advice of the reviewer who used butter instead of shortening. These were tasty, but they did not rise well.  Will keep searching for the perfect biscuit recipe.

First time I made these. Didn't have quite enough milk so I added buttermilk to make the 3/4 cup. They rose nicely and were airy for lack of a better word! I used butter instead of shortening as another reviewer suggested. I will never buy store bought again. Loved it! Thank you for such an easy and great recipe!

These were pretty good. I had to use butter to substitute the shortening the first time. I'm hoping they will be even better when I use the shortening!

The dough has a wonderful consistency but my biscuits didn't rise hardly at all as well (as other reviewers have stated). The biscuit is not light and fluffy and its lacking in flavor. I give it 5 stars for the dough and only 3 stars for everything else.

These always turn out perfectly and my neighbor told me they are even better than her grandmothers - but I'm not supposed to tell anyone...

I should mention that I use salted butter instead of shortening.  Once the dough is flattened out, I flour, fold and flatten - repeat twice more.  This will give the biscuits the layers that make them light and wonderful.  I used to think of this as over handling and thought it would make the biscuits hard, but not so.

oh - and one more thing.  I don't use a biscuit cutter.  I use a sharp knife to cut each one out.  This keeps the edges of the dough from smooshing down and preventing them from rising.

These are good but not as great as I hoped.  I felt like there is too much shortening; leaving an oily residue after eating.  I made the recipe as directed; no modifications, no substitutions, nothing.  That being said, I am not a biscuit-pro and these actually looked like biscuits :)  Worth a try.

These are amazing biscuits! I also used very cold butter instead of shortening and I added a little extra butter, approximately another 1/4 of a stick. They always turn out perfectly and I've even made they dough in food processor following all the steps and they turn out just as great!

I used "refined lard" instead of shortening and self-rising flour instead of AP flour + powder + salt... OMG SOOOOOOOOO good. we made biscuits-with-fresh-berries and stew-dumplings. Both were fantastic.

Fabulous and easy to throw together with just a few ingredients. Didn't have a round cookie cutter so I used the mouth of a glass instead, works fine. Loved these both in savoury dishes with sausage, and in sweet with a little jam spread on them. Can't go wrong following these instructions!

If you've had trouble with biscuits in the past...look no further. This basic recipe is a no brainer and just as easy and quick as any I've ever done. All of the substitutions will work...particularly the swap out of shortening with butter and too...sour or buttermilk. Some tricks besides folding the dough to layer it, is don't over-handle the dough, and using a sharp cutter that won't crush the dough as you're cutting the biscuit. It allows the dough to expand while 
baking...giving that flaky end result.

This was my first time making biscuits EVER!!! I wanted a delicious and easy biscuit recipe to make for my husband because he adores Mcdonalds biscuits and I want him to love mine as much if not more!!! This was a hit!! As soon as they came out the oven, my husband and daughter devoured them!! I made this to the recipe exact, and they came out PERFECT!! The best by far, now I'm wondering what else I can add to them and different variations?

These are by far the best biscuits I've attempted so far.  Like others I had some trouble with mine rising, but I think that has to do with personal error rather than anything in the recipe. Biscuits can be so finicky.  Even though mine failed to rise much, they still tasted great. I can see these being delicious with sausage gravy or even with some butter and jam for breakfast.  I'll definitely be trying these again. Hopefully I can get them to rise a bit more!

Perfect recipe!  I used butter instead of shortening, and it worked out great!  I also added Italian spices which brought out an amazing flavor!  Going to be using this recipe again!

Worked perfectly to the word and the measures mentioned. I used this as a training ground for my eager to learn daughter and we were both delighted.

Thank you very much.

I was expecting something fluffier. These really didn't rise much at all. They were flaky and tasted ok, but just wasn't what I was expecting. I followed the recipe as listed.

I added an extra 1/4 c of milk and used salted butter instead of shortening and sea salt instead of regular salt. When using sea salt, use half the amount. :) This is the best biscuit recipe I have come across ever! thanks!

The taste of these biscuits were yummy but mine did not rise like I thought they would. I was disappointed when they didn't look like the picture. I was careful to not overwork the dough and they were still pretty flat.

Great biscuits. I haven't had much luck making biscuits until I found this recipe. I took the advice from one reviewer and used butter instead of shortening. I grated the cold butter and added it to the dry mixture a little at a time, mixing as I went along. Flaky and delicious.

This recipe is just what it says...Basic Biscuits. These biscuits are very easy to make. However if you're new to biscuit/bread making, I suggest watching one of the videos on this site on how to work the dough. I think I'll stick to my buttermilk biscuits, because they're softer and more flavorful.  White Lily flour makes the lightest, softest biscuits.  I don't know if that brand is available nationally or only here in the South, but it makes the lightest biscuits hands down.

I have made these several times, there is too much of a salty, dry, flour taste and not much flavor at all. On the plus side, mine looked beautiful, they did rise some, and were very flaky and soft . I'm planning on trying the same recipe with buttermilk and/or using butter instead of shortening. I'm not giving up yet!

I just made half of this recipe and finished eating. My biscuits came out flat, probably due to old baking powder. Also I used light butter instead of shortening and I used 1% milk. But they were not hard as bricks, so I ate some anyway. They were tasty and great with a little southern gravy.

Made these to go with homemade beef stew and they turned out beautifully. I didn't have a 1/2" band for my rolling pin so I used the 3/8" and they rose with no problem. Next time I'm going to make a double batch so we have extras for breakfast in the AM:)

These are very similar to the recipe my mom made growing up as a kid. This is the first time I have ever attempted homemade biscuits without them turning out like rocks! Will definitely use the recipe again...biscuits came out very soft and tender. I made sure not to over handle the dough.

I made these in my food processor!  Throw the dry ingredients into the processor with very cold butter and pulse 2-3 times.  Slowly add milk and pulse...voila!  So easy my kiddos can make this.  Very nice biscuits, thanks!

Very moist on the inside and flaky on the outside.
For those of you who don't want to go through the trouble of having to roll out the dough, cookie cut it, and repeat, I simply got a traditional icecream scooper, scooped the dough with it and dropped it into a greased cupcake pan. They rose much better when I did it this way And wasn't a big mess (:

I've used this recipe several times before, and they always turn out great! This morning I made them, but had to make a couple substitutions. I only had self-rising flour, so I left out the baking powder. I didn't have milk, but instead used 3/4 cup water mixed with about 2 tsps non fat dairy creamer. They are simple and quick to make, and delicious!

Nice simple recipe and they turned out great!  I just started making homemade biscuts so I don't have a rolling pin, so I just scooped out spoonfuls of dough and plopped them on the baking sheet.  I have also added garlic and shredded cheddar to the mix.  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!

I tried these thinking they would be easy and taste great, after seeing the high rating. I'm not sure if it's my taste buds or what, but I didn't like them. They tasted way too strong of baking powder (and I even leveled it off so it was the exact amount). I used butter flavored shortening and a tsp. of margarine in place of the regular shortening, but even if it changed the taste, it wouldn't have made that much of a difference.   I had a gut instinct to add some lemon juice and sugar as a buttermilk substitute that I briefly saw on another recipe, but never use buttermilk & short on time so decided against it. I think that may have been exactly what this needed to make it taste great, but that's just a guess. I will try it in the buttermilk substitute in the future, but unfortunately will not try it with this recipe again.  I made these along with a homemade chocolate syrup recipe that I have been bragging on for a long time to my husband - the chocolate syrup turned out great, but was just not enjoyable because the overpowering baking powder taste in the biscuits.  Very disappointed. :(

it was okay. i used butter flavored shortening. I thought they were kinda bland, maybe a little heavy but that could be my fault. The dough was easy to work with. Its more a 3 1/2 rating for me. I did use a small cookie cutter and got over 12 biscuits. The biscuits that sat for about 10 minutes before going in the over rose a bit better then the first batch.

Great recipe!  I followed the advice of Julie W. and used butter rather than shortening.  My 4 year old daughter helped and we had a lot of fun making this easy recipe.  They turned out perfectly and my family really enjoyed them.  I grew up on homemade biscuits and gravy and this one is definitely a keeper!

This was my first time making biscuits and found this super easy. I didn't have shortening, but my mom told me to use frozen butter and a cheese grater. Well grating frozen butter is not that easy so I just chopped it up into pieces as small as I could then mixed it in with the dry ingredients. I also needed a splash or so more milk then was called for, but that was to be expected. Then instead of rolling out the dough, I just scooped out spoonfulls and put them into muffin pans to bake. Everyone loved them. In the muffin pans it help make the outside crisp and the inside was so light and fluffy. Thanks mom for the frozen butter tip.

These turned out very good and were easy enough for a first time biscuit maker.  I used unsalted butter instead of shortening and cut out my biscuits with the lid from a mason jar.  They were quite a hit with the boys!

I used this fora biscuit and gravy birthday brreakfast for my hubby. This was an awesome recipe! I used to make homemade biscuits all the time, then I stopped for a few years and lost my recipe after not using it. Not sure how close this was to the original, but  I promise not to lose this one. I did take one reviewers recommendation and cut in some cold butter. Other than that, I made no changes.

These are great.  Even if they are basic, they're yummy.  Easy, quick and delicious.  Add 2 tsp. sugar to combat the bitterness of the baking powder, if desired.  But they're perfect either way.

These were a super simple recipe and makes a great substitute for my normal biscuit recipe when I'm out of self-rising flour.  Didn't make any substitutions but I think it's easily adaptable if you wanted to do addins like cheese, spring onions, or ham.  A little heavy if you wanted to go sweet with it though, IMO.

These might be basic, but they taste great!  To simplify, I just rolled out the dough and cut into squares with a pizza slicer.  They were ready in 15 minutes.

I use these when I don't want my usual drop biscuits.  They come out well almost every time

Very easy recipe. Even for me... who couldn't bake from a box mix where all you need to do is add water and eggs.
