Very easy to make and tasty too! I added chopped spinach to these and they came out nice. Only used 1/4 cup of yogurt and they were not dry at all.

Due to what was at hand I had to make a few changes, didn't have dried onion so used spring onion (salad onions) and discovered my yogurt had turned so used single cream instead. Also as I don't like dill so I used parsley. But these were minor changes in this recipe. It was really nice. Made mini size patties (about 18 in total) and was a nice lunch for 4 with a side salad. Even the kids ate them all up.

They were delicious, the only reason I did not give  a 5 star was, I found them a bit sweet for my taste. I believe it was the ketchup. Next, time I will leave it out and maybe add some dry mustard. Overall, this was a simple and quick recipe to make. I had most of the ingredients in my pantry!
