Why use low-fat on this dish? Use what tastes good and enjoy a smaller portion. I have made this dish for years (called it "stacked Enchiladas")using beef or pulled pork, green enchilada sauce or red but I never compromised flavor for low-fat.

I like this lighter version of a Mexican lasagna, people that would like it full fat should not be harsh on the cook that gave this recipe, just make it your way, really liked the dish, thank-you to the cook, I'm proud of you for sticking to your style.

This is a great recipe that can easily be doubled or more to make a tasty dish to take to a potluck. Depending on the enchilada sauce and the seasonings, this can have a nice amount of "heat" which is tempered by the sour cream. I spread the beans on the tortillas before placing them in the pan. Once I had all the bean-covered tortillas in place, I scooped sour cream on top and spread around with a spatula. Did all the rest of the layering from there. Easy peasy.

This tasted really good for a low fat recipe. I had a little trouble spreading the beans maybe next time i will spread it on each tortilla before layering. I also added green onions on top before serving.

I was trying to use up all the groceries I actually had in the house before going to the store and came across this recipe when I plugged refried beans into the ingredient search. I used ground chuck, made my own taco seasoning and enchilada sauce, and combined mozzarella and cheddar cheese instead of using the Mexican blend. I also used only 9 corn tortillas. To make things easier, I spread the refried beans onto the tortillas as I laid them in the pan. This turned out quite good. No one would ever believe I was toward the end of my groceries!

Fabulous! a great recipe however you like it, w/full fat ingredients as the recipes contributor noted can be swapped in per your preference. I find myself making it with some lower fat ingredients, and some full... but thats the way we like it. I don't race around focused on being "fit" 24-7 and I don't completely ignore the fact that healthy eating and living translates into a longer life.  That said,  for those in either extremist camp.. enjoy what you want but don't make me suffer your lifestyle preaching.  I have my own and LOVE it! and I love this recipe. for a slight change try flour tortillas, and if you use the larger ones, they're easily cut and arranged to fit whatever pan/dish you use.  I've even tried in a bundt pan! that was fun! Thanks for posting the recipe Katherine!

This was very tasty, however, I am glad I didn't open the second can of sauce. As it was very saucy with just one 12oz can of enchilada sauce. I actually baked it an extra 15 minutes until I had bubbles in the middle and the cheese was browned around the edges. Will make again.

Thanks everyone for trying this recipe! After a few years of making it myself and reading your wonderful reviews I wanted to add a couple of things.
First, I use yellow corn tortillas which bring that fat and calorie count down even lower. I see so many people who've been happy with flour and whole wheat so it's certainly not a necessity, though. 
Also, over the years I've stopped spreading the beans and sour cream. Instead I use a pastry bag to pipe them. If you don't have a pastry bag, use a plastic Ziploc bag with a corner cut off. (You'll probably want to warm the beans slightly so they'll be easier to pipe.)
I'm so proud of this recipe and how it's brought joy to people I've never even met. Thank you all, so much!

I make this WITHOUT the beans and WITH stewed chicken or ground beef simply because I hate ground turkey; if I were to use that, I'd use a mixture of 1/2 turkey and 1/2 ground beef.  I've also made it "my way" with cream of chicken or cream of mushroom soup instead of the enchilada sauce (during the days when such ingredients weren't readily available), and if you run the soup through a blender with yet another can of chilis, it will make a good green enchilada sauce.

This is so tasty. We used no bake lasagna noodles because we don't like corn tortillas which worked out ok (they didn't totally rehydrate even though we made a good effort to cover every piece with sauce.  We only had 1 can of enchilada sauce but that was plenty.  The hubby branded this 'instant classic'.  Oh, and it only made us 3 servings, not 6 :(.  Also spread the refried beans with an offset spatula onto the lasagna noodles.

It was great especially for those of us who like to eat healthier. I dont understand why someone who doesnt want to be healthy would come to a lighter recipe and then criticize it? Anyhow, its exactly what I was looking for to add to my diet and lower fat regimen ty!

you can use flour tortillas if you would rather and use a layer of mozarella cheese in the middle.   can substitute salsa for the chiles.

I wanted to use up some leftover turkey so I shredded it and heated up with a can of rotel, garlic,cumin, chile powder, and creole seasoning instead of the ground turkey and taco seasoning. Came out great! Probably went heavier on the cheese than original recipe but came out great! Oh, I also added finely chopped raw onion in my layers.

I tried this weekend and loved it - even had seconds - something I rarely do.  I did not add the chiles (have an allergy) but the flavor combo was great.  Used a tip of spreading the refried beans like peanut butter and it helped.  The textures are difficult to spread without a spatula (I finally figured that out), it smelled great and tasted even better.  Made this at a sick friends home and I will make in individual casseroles so I can enjoy it often as I live alone

Used AR recipes for the taco seasoning, refried beans, and the enchilada sauce.  I did bake this longer than recipe indicated, about 35 minutes to get the topping browned (and hot inside). Turned out pretty well.

My family loved this! I used a mixture of cream cheese and sour cream and mixed it into the meat with cheese to make it creamy since we dont like refried beans.  Made my own enchilada sauce - it was delish!

My husband and I thought it was great. I used ground turkey BREAST because I don't like the flavor of just ground turkey. After cooking the turkey breast I used my chopper to make it into smaller chunks. I followed others suggestion to spread the refried beans on the tortillas BEFORE putting them in the pan. And I only used one can of sauce. Thanks for the recipe. YUMMY

I have made this twice now and have thoroughly enjoyed it each time!  It would be really hard to mess it up.  Do be sure to spread beans on tortillas before placing in dish and THEN do the sour cream - it's just easier.  I doubled the green chiles, which resulted in EXCELLENT flavor.

I thought this tasted great and my whole family loved it. I used meatless chopped "meat" for a vegetarian version and added chopped jalapeño peppers to the "meat".  I would have rated it five stars except for two things...did not need the second can of enchilada sauce at all and it required almost double the amount of time to bake than stated. Other than that it was great and I will be making this again.

I have made this for years, and hubby requests it often. I do not use the sour cream in the casserole, though. I add cream cheese to the meat and seasoning and melt it all together. I also put some sliced black olives over each layer, including the top. The green chiles are a must, though! They add so much flavor!

Just a note on how to layer the tortillas easier:  Whenever I am putting round tortillas into a rectangle pan, I cut them in half and put the flat cut sides to the outside of the pan, this way they fit perfectly!!  (personally use flour tortillas as I don't care for corn ones either)  And if you are using no boil noodles, you can put them in a bowl and cover with boiling water just to soften them a bit.  Just bring 2 cups water to a boil in microwave or tea kettle.  I saw this also works for regular lasagna noodles, don't have to buy the expensive no boil.

Very good and great the following day. I used whole wheat tortillas and guacamole rather than sour cream. I also used a third less cheese. Will make again.

Made this twice now, with trader joes enchilada sauce (1 container only) and their taco seasoning and black jalapeño beans which are super easy to spread.  and I also added chopped jalapeño to the meat for some extra heat. Cooked it a 15 mins longer and it is spicy and delicious! One of my favorite ground turkey recipes. Healthy option!

So tasty!!  It was nice to eat this and know that it was made with a slightly lighter ingredients, 'cause you would definitely miss it if you didn't know. I made this mild so that everyone could enjoy... My husband suffers from heartburn when there's too much heat.
Everyone loved it!  I work and don't come home until 5/5:30 some days, so it was nice to be able to assemble this dish the day before and just stick it in the oven when I came home at the end of a very busy day!

This was really good. I failed to get the refried beans so I sauteed an onion with the turkey. If you have high blood pressure, there's a salt-free recipe for taco seasoning and enchilada sauce on this website. I fried an egg and put on top of a serving for breakfast. My husband LOVED it.

this was easy to prepare and great for a casual dinner. I added fresh chopped cliantro on the top to finish it off. A definite make-again!

I read through the ingredients several times and realized that this was missing taco veggies. I added red and orange bell pepper and a small yellow onion as a layer to give it more flavor variety. Also, I used green chile enchilada sauce. With my extra ingredients I enjoyed this quite a bit but if I had made it as it said to I feel like it would have been boring.

This was excellent.  My 7x11 pyrex was filled to the brim . . . so I didn't end up using all of the 2nd can of enchilada sauce and only a little cheese on the top layer.  I used a pizza wheel to cut the corn tortillas in half so I could arrange them to fit a bit better than keeping them round.  I think I actually used 13 tortillas in total.

Tried using chicken instead of ground beef, worked well. But very spicy to my taste but hubby loved it. I will try again and play with ingredients next time. Maybe eliminate taco seasoning??

One word - Yummy! I may never make "traditional" enchiladas again as this was so much easier to put together and has all the same flavors as my favorite recipe with the exception of black olives which is a must add in my estimation.  Took some tips from other reviewers and spread both the beans and sour cream on the shells before stacking.  Also like others I did not go the low fat route with this one simply because I used what I had on hand. Thanks for a great recipe!

Like other reviewers I used what I had on hand with fantastic results! Black beans instead of refried and added a dollop of sour cream to the top instead of in the layers since my husband isn't a fan. He also prefers spicy and I like milder flavors so I added hot pico to the top of his! Will be making this again! Thanks for posting it!

Absolutely delicious!!! I did not use nonfat/low-fat cheese or sour cream. I just don’t approve of any of those titled foods (personal choice) nonetheless this was easy to make, full of flavor, and very satisfying! I made a family size  tomato & cucumber-cilantro salad. Everything was a hit and this is definitely going into my meal lineup!

I have made this twice now.  It is fabulous.  The proportions for things in the recipe are a bit off, so you have to tweak amounts, with some things, by a lot.  But this is delicious!  And I left out the green chilis because this was plenty hot for our taste buds.  Really good recipe.

Screwed up and got green enchilada sauce so my rating reflects my own inability to shop for the correct ingredients. I do think in the future I will look for ways to make it spicier.

Good meal, used chicken instead of turkey. Used tortillas, nachos, and Doritos  because I didn't have all the cheeses needed. Baked for 40 minutes at 375 to get everything nice and hot together and added the top layer of cheese in the last 3 minutes of baking so it wouldn't get crispy!

Easy and has a great flavor!  I swapped out the sour cream for plain Greek yogurt and did not use low-fat ingredients. I just had a smaller portion, as noted in another post.?

I’m not a huge fan of the stiffness of the corn tortillas. Next time I’ll use flour tortillas. Also, ground turkey doesn’t crumble as well as ground beef, so the turkey ended up being pretty chunky in the lasagna.

I followed the recipe except I used regular cheddar I grated myself on top.  I think if you cut most of the fat by adding lean chicken or turkey and chopped vegetables:  mushrooms onions peppers zucchini, you can sprinkle a small amount of real cheese on top of the enchilada sauce and not feel guilty

Made this tonight and it was amazing.  Two picky eater kids gobbled it up.

Whoa. So good. Made exactly as directed, except with regular Mexican blend as, shucks, I couldn't find the low fat blend. It makes a lot!

Made with full fat ingredients (although i didn't have green chiles and substituted rotel).  Also, I made mine with more layers.

This was very good and easy to prepare. A keeper I did use low sodium taco seasoning.
