This recipe was really good. I found out that instead of chicken broth you can take the flavor packet and add it to a half cup of water its just as good like that but other that that it was VERY good.

As a college student this is the perfect fast, tasty, low budget meal. To simplify it even more I just use stir-fry frozen veggies, add an egg and omit chicken.

I just made this and it is super tasty.  I did change a few things.  As others suggested, I used the flavour packet for the broth, and cut out the tomato.  When I fried up my chicken, I used a little soy and teriyaki sauce, and also sweet and sour to give the meat a little more flavour.  Very economical and delicious.  The best Ramen recipe I have tried to date!

I adjusted to what I had on hand.  I tripled the recipe as I had 6 people to feed.  I also used 6 packages of ramen, not 3 (as you would for doubling).  Omitted the pepper and onion and used a frozen broccoli/cauliflower mixture.  Used homemade chicken stock and more garlic, plus fresh ginger.  Omitted the tomato.  All but one LOVED it and went back for 2nds/3rds.  Thanks for a great start up recipe!

This was a quick and easy weaknight meal. Very tasty. As another reveiwer suggested, I used the flavour packet with 1/2 cup water instead of the chicken broth and I also added a little cajun seasoning to the chicken. I topped it off with a little parmesan cheese.

I love this packet free recipe! Since the average 3 oz. of ramen with the flavor packet is over 1800 mg. of sodium (out of 2400 mg. suggested daily intake,) 590 mg. is fantastic and very tasty! I do prefer it without the tomato though.

This was very good. I changed it up a little to accomodate items I had on hand & for extra servings. I also added the Thai Peanut Butter Sauce to it & it was fabulous. Very nice healthy meal-even my 4yr old picky eater LOVED it. Thanks for the great recipe.

I normally don't add this many things in my ramen. But I liked this recipe. I added green beans, shrimp, garlic, stir fry sauce. I stayed away from that death packet. This was a filling meal. You can pretty much use what ingredients you like. Just add your own touches and spices and spin. Nice quick cheap meal.

Believe it or not, I had never had Ramen Noodles before.  It was a few days before payday, though, and I didn't have much in the house to eat and not a lot of $$ to go and get a lot, either.  LOL  I bought a 6 pk. of Ramen Noodles for $1 specifically to try this recipe, as I had everything but the noodles.  My DH and I thought it was wonderful!  I loved the minimal prep time and, if you use the pre-cooked chicken strips, it takes a lot of the work out of the prep.  A very light, delicious meal!  Thanks for the recipe, and I will definitely be making this one again!

Another no fail way to jazz up those economical Ramen noodles. I followed the recipe to the letter, but eyeballed the seasoning and soy sauce. Also, instead of chicken broth, I just added the packet of seasonings from the ramen package to a cup of hot water for convenience sake. Great quick meal, thanks!

Having this for dinner tonight. I've made it before and love that it is so versatile with whatever meat and veggies you have on hand. Tonight I am using a frozen stir fry blend plus onion, garlic, bell pepper, and peas. I always put a touch of Teriyaki Sauce in as well as the Soy Sauce. Gives it a bit of punch. Thanks for the recipe.

Very quick and easy meal, we really liked it but I had to add more onion and garlic also more soy sauce. Love that you can use whatever vegetables you prefer. I added carrots and brocoli. The ramen noodles were so good in this. Will make this again, Thanks for sharing.

This is a good recipe as a base. I had to tweak this recipe for more flavor. Increased the amount of onion to 1 cup onion wedges, replaced the bell pepper with 2 cups broccoli florets, replaced the broth with 1/2 cup water and the seasoning pkt from the oriental flavor ramen pkg, replaced 1 tsp of soy sauce with 1 tsp oyster sauce. Added 1 cup fresh bean spouts and 1/2 cup bamboo shoots.

Very quick and easy to prepare.  I added celery and carrots, which was very good, and used the seasoning packet from the raman.  I'm not sure if the tomatoes really work with it or not, but they add an interesting flavor.

Definitely gong to make again. We made the following changes for a spiced up version: 

*Chunk chicken up into small pieces and sautee with frozen mixed veggies with olive oil, seasoning mix and garlic
*Add soy sauce- sautee; add chicken broth (made with 1/2c water and 1/2 a packet of ramen seasoning)
*Drain noodles, sautee in mixture; add splash of red wine vinegar

This is the seasoning mix we used:

*2 crushed red peppers (keep seeds)
*1/2 teaspoon of: black pepper, garlic salt, cajun seasoning
* 1teaspoon of: ground ginger, dried onion bits

Made for a spicy, authentic stir-fry (we did leave out the peppers, tomatoes, and fresh onions)

This was great for a cheap weeknight meal! I did sub the flavor packet for chicken broth, and I used a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies for convenience. My 18 month old and husband both ate it, so that definitely means we'll be having this again.

ADD HOISIN SAUCE !!If you add nothing else to this recipe add this ! This makes it awesome ! Just a few spoon fulls and it gives you the flavor alot of people are saying the needs ! If you dont know what it is its an Asian Sauce found near where you would find tacos and salsa in the market . I also added chopped carrots and celery and 1 can of mild chili peppers . I added the hoisin sauce last ( tasting it after adding each thing ) and that is the real kicker !! Oh I also added cajun when making the chicken like another reviewer said .

Great idea to use Ramen Noodles. We used marinated chicken and made our own sauce (since my chicken was teriyaki flavored, a teriyaki sauce). Like I did when I was in college, I just put the ramen in a 2 cup measuring cup full of water and microwaved it for 3 minutes - stirring once -  to cook the noodles - then drained -  turned out perfect. Thanks for the idea, Ramen was a nice change from rice.

Needed more flavor, and I must have done something wrong, the noodles never crisped up they turned to mush, was not a big hit with us.
