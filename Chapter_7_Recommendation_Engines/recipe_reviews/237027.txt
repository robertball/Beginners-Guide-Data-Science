This recipe was really great! My husband and I followed it to the letter and this is what we will do differently next time. We had way too much filling for the 4 pie shells, so we will cut back to two potatoes and maybe up the peas to a cup. We will also cut back just a little on the cayenne. Another way to describe how to fold is put the filling in the middle and bring the three corners to the top and pinch down the sides to seal them. If the dough isn't "sealing" well, add a little water to the edges of the triangle before you start the folding process.
Update: We've also stopped peeling the potatoes. It saves time and we don't notice it at all.

I used egg roll wrappers instead of pie crust to keep the calories down, and brushed them with oil. Very good!

I made these to go with the sweet potato-carrot soup from this site, and they were great. I used a mix of regular and sweet potato, and used scant dashes of the cayenne and cardamom after reading the reviews, and added a little garam masala. I also used egg roll wrappers, cut into triangles, both for the heathier aspect and the ease of portioning. They came out very well. I'll definitely keep these in my repertoire. Thanks for sharing.

First time making these - and they were awesome.  As comparison had a take-out fried samosa at the same time and actually preferred this baked piecrust version.  I followed the recipe to a T - very easy to follow directions and went together quickly.  I used 4 medium-small potatoes and had about half of the filling leftover.  Lessons learned were that would use half whole seed and half ground coriander - the abundance of seeds bothered some but the taste was very good.  These were relatively mild so would add another 1/2 teas of cayenne.  The filling had perfect heat but once wrapped they were mild.  I also learned to put tbl spoon of filling on the 8 pieces of crust then wash hands and pinch together into 3-cornered hat shapes - because any filling on hands stains the crust.  I used water as the sealant and did not use an egg wash (to accommodate allergy) and they browned up fine - in 18 minutes.  Great recipe and will make them again.

Excellent flavor.  Takes a little while and creativity to make (putting them together) but totally worth it.  Brought them to a New Years Indian themed meal and they were a hit with all ages!

This recipes is great. I used sweet potatoes instead of regular potatoes and they were delicious. Great recipe and easy. Just takes time to assemble the samosas.

I made these for a potluck, they were eaten very quickly, including by children.  My Indian husband would have preferred more spice so if I make them for just us I'll likely add more spices.  Easy, though!  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this to go with chicken tandoori, Indian carrot rice, mango chutney and pistachio rose ice cream.  I have to say this was very tasty and a big hit! My family asked for seconds.

Wonderful, full of flavor recipe for samosas. My guests even said it was better than the restaurants, and after making these and going back to the Indian restaurant, I have to agree! I do advise wearing gloves while stuffing the dough, otherwise your nails may turn yellow from the spice.(mine did). These work great frozen and then popped in the oven too. The egg wash is essential to have a "fried feel" to them.

I made this tonight and used 4 russets plus 1 sweet potato. The seasoning is really flavorful. When you first saute onions and its seasoning, don't be surprised if the 1 tsp of salt taste too salty, but when you add cooked Potatoes, it mellows out and it's very ultra-yummy . Instead of pie crust, I used LUMPIA (a type of wrapper for Filipino egg rolls) wrapper.  I did fry like an eggroll and the shell was lightly crispy, thinish and samosa filling was still moist.  You can freeze the samosa eggroll and fry up for a quick snack (with chutney, tamarind sauce, raita or even by itself) or even for Indian theme night ! :)

Bad recipe. Tomatoes don't belong in Samosas. Pie crust was too heavy also.
Waste of product and time.

Loved this recipe; flavourful, spicy and easy to make.  I also had some filling left over which turned out well because I dolloped leftover filling onto slices of cucumber for my guests who are gluten intolerant.

I've made this three times and I absolutely love it. The only thing I added was 1 Tbs. of plain yogurt to the potatoes to make the filling smoother.

I did change the filling , and used puff pastry instead of pie dough.  I used 2 fresh cayenne peppers from my garden. The spice blend is AMAZING!  This recipe is going into my favorite file.  Just a final note: I blanched broccoli, and used ground beef.  I added onions, garlic and spices, then added broccoli and then the beef let it all cook and marry together, then filled my pastry. Followed baking directions.  And as I said...AMAZING!

For a first time trying this recipe I would say I totally succeeded!!! I added a little more cumin and curry just cause I love those spices, I added more salt. Got some left over stuffing but personally it doesn’t matter to me cause I can make some more tomorrow for the party I’m hosting!!! Love love love .

The filling mixture is wonderful.  I for some reason ended up with a lot of extra filling.  It was hard for me to get the dough wrapping right.  I think it just takes some practice.  The filling would be great all by itself as a side dish.

I loved making this and I loved the delicious mix of spices, minus the coriander seeds, which are too overpowering in my opinion. The recipe can easily be customized to be toddler-friendly by modifying the cayenne pepper and coriander seeds. I will try other veggies in there too, like sweet potatoes, carrots, or spinach.

Smells great and tastes excellent.  Kids liked the mid filling and flaky crust. After baking, brush with garlic butter. Yum!

Soooo yummy!  It was a tad too hot for our preference so will halve the cayenne pepper next time.
