I love  the contrast of sweet and salty in this recipe.  The peanut butter makes it nice and creamy.  My husband said that it tasted like a payday candy bar.  This is definitely a keeper at my house.  I am a lifetime weight watcher and this recipe is definitely worth the calories!

This pie is delicious. I think next time I'll make it, I'll increase SALTED peanuts to 1 1/2 cup. Don't put unsalted peanut in the pie, for the contrast between the sweetness of sugar and corn syrups, and salt of the peanuts is very surprising... in a positive way!

This was good, but the nuts did not rise to the top as in the picture and so they became soft if the pie filling. It had a nice flavor. I would try again, but sprinkle the nuts on top instead of folding them in the filling.

Very very delicious.  Everyone was very nervous to try it, but I insisted it tasted like PayDay candy bars (like a previous comment had mentioned).  I used 1 cup of peanuts in the pie, but before baking, I sprinkled about 1/4 c on top and pressed them in a little so that there would be some peanuts visible on top.  I will definitely make this again some time.

Wow!  Turned out perfectly!  I only had unsalted nuts on hand, but threw 1/4+ tsp. salt in to compensate.  It's great!

This is a delicious pie. My husband compared the taste to that of a Payday(tm) candybar.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year.  Followed the directions exactly and it was perfect!  My husband can't eat pecans but loves peanuts and this has the same consistency of a pecan pie! Wonderful taste!  Will definitely make again!

Favorite! We crush the peanuts some before adding and use crunchy peanut butter instead so we enjoy the peanuts without all the extra chewing. (Dentures)

This was really an answer to my peanut butter craving.  I made it exactly as per recipe.  It is very rich, but very pleasing.  Thanks for a great recipe!
