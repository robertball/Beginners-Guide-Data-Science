Just off the stove, piping hot, this dish was fantastic.  I left out the jalepeno to tone down the heat and my family really liked it as a side dish.

Good but next time I would use less corn. It wasn't very liquidy.

This is yummy- it really wasn't that hot which was fine for me.  If you want it HOT- drop a whole jalapeno in the food processor and fold it into the salsa. It did have a delicious sweetness and freshness.  This is tasting especially good over green chile tamales and over super spicy nachos.  VERY YUMMY.

Not bad, but recipe uses too much corn and not enough tomatillos.

Also, "four ears" is not a helpful measurement, especially if you're using canned produce as a handy substitute. Cups would be better.

This was a great salsa. I used tomatillaos from a neighbor who had too many. All of my friends raved about it. Easy to make and delicious.
