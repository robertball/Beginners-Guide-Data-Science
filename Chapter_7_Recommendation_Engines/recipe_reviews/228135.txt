The flavor was fabulous, I can't understand why my Flounder always comes out mushy though. I have tried this 2ce the second time I added 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 1/4 tsp dill weed. even more flavorful! My husband is not a fish eater but he enjoys this!

Tweaked this yummy fish after reading comments.  I broiled it instead baking it.  I brushed melted butter and lemon juice on the flounder prior to broiling the flounder.  Broiled till half way of cooking time (ex 6 minutes total time).  SO at 3 minutes I put the Parmesan mixture on a returned to broiler!  Delightfully delicious and firm!

A great recipe for kids who may not like strong tasting fish. I followed other reviewers advice and patted the fish dry (frozen and thawed IQF flounder) and then brushed with lemon juice. Then under the broiler for 3 minutes. I mixed the parm, mayo and some italian style bread crumbs together and added the mix to the broiled fish and returned to the oven for another 3-4 min under the broiler, watching to make sure it didn't burn. Delicious! Even my non-fish eater son ate it without complaint. Thanks for a recipe I can use on other fish filets!

This is a super easy recipe and tasty as well.  After reading the comments about being mushy I decided to broil the fish and not bake it. Flounder is so thin, it is easy to overcook. I prepared the topping as per recipe but used a few finely chopped leek pieces instead of green onions.  I ommitted the butter as I was using lower fat mayo and adding butter seemed counterproductive! I broiled until I could see it getting a bit flaky.  Midway through, I used a knife to respread the mayo mix so it would not burn.  Turned out perfect and not mushy! M.A.

I made this for dinner last night and it was a big hit with my entire family - including my very picky 10 year old step-son!  I did change a few things based on reviews and personal preference.  For instance I omitted the lemon juice as I am not a fan of lemon flavor on my food.  Rather than green onion, I just sprinkled some parsley flakes into the topping mixture.  I also sprinkled a bit of garlic powder on the fillets and broiled for about 3-5 minutes then added the topping and broiled for an additional 3-5 minutes.  Definite addition to the dinner menu rotation in our house!

Very yummy, easy recipe. My husband said it was the best fish he had ever had, including fine restaurants. As other reviews did, I broiled my fish. I broiled for 5 minutes on middle rack, removed and put on the mayo mixture, and returned to middle rack until brown and bubbly (another 4-5 min). The texture was perfect. I did add some herb de Provence and felt it added a wonderful flavor. 

Thank you Lola for sharing this great recipe. I will be making this one again!

4 stars for being easy and fairly quick on a busy weeknight. I only used 3 T butter, but could easily nix it altogether next time and sub out another T of mayo. I used a LOT more lemon juice than called for since I love the citrusy zing it imparts on fish. To the mayo/cheese mixture, I sprinkled in some onion & garlic powders, paprika, some dried parsley and dried chopped onion since I didn't have green. I also liberally sprinkled the same spice mixture over the fish  and used sea salt to taste. I didn't want to bother with lining and/or cleaning a baking dish, so I just sprayed Pam in a foil 9x13" pan. DH really liked it; so did I, but it's not the healthiest dinner ever, so it'll be reserved for a "once in a while" meal. Thanks!

This was so, so delicious.  Best flounder recipe ever.  And, as other reviewers indicated it was a bit mushy so the 2nd making I did what other reviewers said to dry the dish up again, but, you know what?  We loved it just a bit mushy.  Again, tastiest flounder recipe I've ever used.  I've made this 3 times in 2 weeks ... we're both trying to lose some holiday pounds ... that's how much we love it!

Very tasty! I followed a few suggestions from other reviewers. I didn't salt the fish, but instead brushed it with melted butter and lemon juice. I used my leftover butter and lemon juice in the topping mix, to which I also added bread crumbs. As for cooking, I broiled the fish alone for 3 minutes, added the topping, and broiled another 3 minutes. Came out mushy, but not dry and quite delicious! My husband was licking the plate when he was done. We'll adjust the cooking time next time to see if that helps keep the fish from becoming mushy.

Update: I cooked this again, except I put it in altogether under a high broiler for 5 minutes, 3 minutes on the top rack and 2 minutes on the lower one. The parmesan made a lovely bubbly crust, and the fish cooked completely without becoming mushy. Delicious.

At last!  A recipe where arrowtooth flounder doesn't turn mushy!  I'd read in several places to marinate the fish in lemon juice before cooking to firm it up, so I marinated it for 30 minutes before cooking.  I'm not sure if it was that or the quick cooking that did the trick.  After marinating, I brushed the fillets with melted butter and used the rest of the melted butter to oil my foil pan.  I very lightly sprinkled the fish with salt and garlic powder, then piled the mayonnaise mixture on top.  I used the leftover lemon juice from the marinade and chopped onion greens from my garden.  I also used Romano cheese cuz that's what I had on hand and it packs a little more flavor than parmesan.  Like so many others, I broiled it on the bottom rack of my countertop oven for 3 minutes, then moved it up to the middle rack, right under the heating element, for another 3 minutes until it was browned and bubbling on top.  If anything it was very slightly underdone, which didn't bother me at all being a sushi lover.  It was absolutely delicious!  And not mushy!!!  I'm making this again today and will definitely make it again and again.  Thanks!

Loved it!  I used Olive oil cooking spray, sea salt instead of regular salt, & onion chives from my garden instead of green onions & it turned out quite tasty.  My mother has a similar recipe using cod, but I am more of a fan of Flounder.  We will definitely be making this again!

So I cheated with this recipe! lol. This was my first time baking with flounder and I was unsure if I and my boyfriend would like it. So I followed the heating instructions, but, I coated the flounder well on both sides with Parkay squeeze butter, then I used McCormick Lemon Herb perfect pinch seasoning, a little Garlic powder, and a littler Adoba All Purpose Seasoning. It tastes great!

I seasoned the fillets with pepper instead of salt. I didn't have green onions on hand either. I did, however, add dried mustard to the cheese, butter, lemon juice and mayo mixture. My family LOVED it!!! This will be used again! Perfect and easy, easy, easy!!

This has been, by far, my favorite flounder recipe. I've found that I have to leave it in the broiler a little longer to get that coloration just perfect, but that's no problem. I haven't changed a thing about this recipe, nor would I, and have made it several times. I'm making it again this evening and I can't wait.

fantastic - i had to make some changes. 2 lbs was too much for my small family. I used 1 lb and i also changed from baking to broil as others had suggested. i added a sprinkle of bread crumbs and paprika for color. and i am in love. i was thinking of trying this on chicken and even pork (the other white meat) thanks for these ideas. i am new to cooking on a more regular basis (in a relationship now and have to cook for just myself) this is becoming fun.

I used feta instead of the parmesan.  This was so wonderful!  I was worried the flounder would tast too "fishy" but it came out delicious.  I broiled for 5 minutes and then put the cheese/mayo mixture on top and broiled for another 3 minutes.  This will be added to the recipe box under "wonderful dishes" Thanks for the recipe.

Super easy and quick to make.  Boys (12 yr. olds) loved it, hubby said "not so much". I followed the "broil for 3 minutes, add topping, broil 3 more" and it worked great. Nice golden brown on top, lots of flavor in the topping. I think he didn't like the fishyness of the flounder. Will try with Swai next time!!  But will do this recipe again.

I really liked this recipe! It was easy, quick and very good.  I added some sun dried tomatoes, capers and a little black pepper but the sauce is great on its own.

Followed step by step, only difference was broiling instead of baking. I broiled filets 4 minutes, removed from oven and spread cheese/mayo/ butter mixture—returned to broiler for 4 more minutes. The last 2 minutes, I moved the pan to lowest rack to avoid burning. It was good, I may or may not repeat.

Very good recipe! My hubby loved this recipe. I did add capers and dill weed as another reviewer suggested, but I suggest omitting all salt if capers are used as they more than make up for it. Definitely will try this again. Served with garlic boiled potatoes and Waldorf salad.

I think I could eat this every night! I used the individually frozen flounder, thawed and pat dry. Didn't have green onions so used parsley and only used a tad of lemon juice. Broiled for 3 minutes, added the sauce and broiled for about 7 more minutes. So easy and so delish!

I made it adding 1 tsp prepared chopped garlic and 1 tsp fresh chopped dill. I also followed a suggestion using ONLY the broiler. After 1/2 cooking time, about 4 minutes, I covered the fish with the sauce. It was delicious!

Well I didn’t have lemon in hand so I diluted my lemon extract...it was still yummy!  And I didn’t have flounder so I used tilapia...I just cooked it about 10 minutes longer.   I used the fine grated Parmesan that I had-should’ve probably used less of it and the butter next time. Used extra sauce to steamed broccoli...
Thank you for the recipe!!!

This was delicious! I took others’ advice and put them under the broiler for about 3 min per side after I squeezed the juice of 1 lemon over them. I then topped with just mayonnaise and Parmesan and broiled til bubbly. I didn’t see the need for adding the butter. I also seasoned them with garlic, salt and pepper before broiling. My husband said I finally made a flavorful oven fish.

WOW!  I grew up on flounder, it being the most likely catch off Long Island. We don't see it much in Minnesota, so I jumped on it when I saw some at a local smoked fish store.  Followed this very simple recipe and IT WAS TO DIE FOR!

I broiled instead of baking (placing the rack midway the oven).  Drizzled with the lemon juice after salting.  Broiled 3 minutes. Took out, and spread the mayo mixture onto the fillets. Broiled another 3-4 minutes.  It was DELICIOUS!
*I used this exact technique with salmon since then, and was yummy!

I loved it. Used fresh lemon. Added some lemon pepper and used onion powder vs green onions. Combined with some fresh green beans, mixed salad and ice tea.

Great recipe. I made this along with the Curried Cashew & Grape Salad.  What a wonderful group of varied, but complimentary flavors.  I only added at little  cayenne to the sauce for the flounder.

What an easy, great tasting recipe! I try to make a fish dish  1-2 x a week. Was really pleased how it came out. Didn’t have scallions in the house at the time of prep so diced up 1/4 of an onion. Looking forward to making it again.

This dish was quite delicious. I didn't have parmesan cheese so I used a cheddar blend. I'll be making this one often.

At last! A fish dish my family liked and enjoyed eating!  We thought it rated 5 stars. The fish is tasty and moist.  This goes well with lemon rice pilaf. The pilaf recipe  is found on this websitd.

Other then cutting the recipe in half since there is only two of us, I followed the recipe.  I used sole fillets and it was very good.   You could still taste the sole through all the ingredients which I liked.  Will make again.

Very good with little or no changes-was not mushy.  Only added a little dill (for color) and garlic powder.  It's a hit!  We did like adding lemon juice at the table too!

Great flavor! I made it as directed, but my frozen fish had retained too much water. After cooking via broiler, I set aside the fish and poured all the pan drippings (most of the toppings) into a small pan and boiled it down. Spooned it back over the fish, and had a wonderful dinner.

Very good quick weeknight dish. There's only two of us so I tried to downsize the recipe. Also reading the reviews, I broiled mine but not close to the heat, lower broiler shelf if you have gas oven. The sauce was a little thin so broiling helps it evaporate better and leaves fish flaky. I can see if you bake it how it would be mushy  as some reviews claim. If the fish baked in that sauce it would almost be like boiling it and would be mushy. Over all the other half liked it and it did have nice flavor to it.  They drown, all their seafood in tarter sauce,  I had it on the table and they didn't even use it on this. That speaks wonders in itself about the flavor.  I will be making again. Thanks for the quick and easy weeknight meal.

I made it using some of the other reviewers suggestion to broil the fish prior to adding the cheese mixture. I put salt on the fish and then sprinkled one tablespoon on the fish and placed in the broiler for a few minutes. Then spread the cheese sauce on top and broiled for a few more minutes until light brown. I used minced onions and onion powder instead of the onions listed in the recipe. It was very tasty and I paired it with linguini and Alfredo sauce.

Easy and tasty.  Used frozen flounder from Samsclub and thawed.  Also followed the other suggestions and broiled vs baking.  Was not mushy but was a bit to fishy.  Would try again with fresh fillets or maybe a milder type of fish.

I didn't have 2 pounds of flounder, so I used what I had. Mine didn't brown under the broiler like the picture. My hubby and I thought there was too much lemon. Probably won't make this again.

DELICIOUS!!!!! I followed the advice of another review and I broiled for 6 minutes before adding sauce and I didn’t season with salt. Then I broiled for the remaining nine minutes after adding sauce. Delicious.

This is easy to make. Bit salty and will eliminate salting fish next time. However, my daughter,  who generally turns her nose up to fish, had several pieces.

I didn't have all of the ingredients that were called for so I read the reviews for suggestions.  I didn't have lemon juice so I used lime juice, I didn't have green onion so I used fried onions, I added dill ( I like dill on fish) and I took away the butter.

I used frozen flounder that was unthawed (rinsed/pat dry).
I preheated the oven then turned it to broil (didn't wont mushy fish).  I used 6 pieces of frozen bag flounder.  I cooked 3 first just to experiment.

The first three I followed the instructions with the substituted items.  I didn't use any butter because I was using mayo.  I seasoned with salt, brush with the mixture then cooked on broil for 6 minutes ( got idea from other reviews).  It turned out ok, but was a little mushy.

The next set of fish (3), I didn't salt, I brushed with the remainder of the mixture and let it broil for 4 minutes. I placed French's fried onions on top for the last 2 minutes.  Bingo, the fish wasn't mushy at all and very tasty.

I will go to the market to buy the missing ingredients and make it again .  I will update the review in a couple of days to let you know how that turned out.

My family loved it! I didn't have a lot of parmesan cheese left so I added Shredded cheddar and Colby Jack.  I also topped the fish with italian breadcrumbs before adding the topping and then I added a little more seasoning as well-a little dill, lemon pepper and garlic.

Seriously good.  I tweaked it a bit, as follows. 

buttered the baking dish, generously (not spray)
used lime instead of lemon (personal reference)
skipped the melted butter in the topping mix not at all necessary with all the mayo)
added about a tsp of garlic powder to the topping mix
sprinkled Old Bay on top of the fillets, just before putting them in the oven (I live on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and it's just what we do)
PERFECTION. Can't wait to make it again.

I didn't have green onions so I used just minced onions.  It was very tasty the combo of cheese, mayo and butter made for a great tasting topper.  I will make it again but with the green onions and maybe it will be a 5 star then.

I bought local flounder at a farmers market and didn't know what to do with it that would also be within my eating plan from my nutritionist (no flour!). This was easy and very yummy. I did add fresh black pepper and a sprinkle of garlic powder to the filets and then sprinkled a bit of paprika on top.

Very good recipe.  After reading other reviews about mushy fish I made the following changes:  In the bottom half of an oven broiler pan I baked a layer of hashbrowns with 2 TBS butter at 400 degrees for 10 minutes.  I then laid 10 small fillets, roughly 2 lbs, on top of the hashbrowns and broiled on high for 5 minutes.  I added 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp dill, and 6 leftover diced shrimp to the parm mayo mix and spread on the fish then broiled for 5 more minutes.  The fish firms up well and any extra liquid goes on the hash browns, sooooo good.

The texture was a little to soft but the flavor was great, fresh garlic and dill weed were added which improve the flavor. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I made this using thawed filets that were pretty thin.  I did as another reviewer suggested and brushed filets with a butter/lemon mix and broiled for five minutes before adding the sauce.  Then broiled an additional five minutes.  The fish was perfectly cooked--not dry or mushy.  The only other thing I changed was leaving out the green onion and sprinkling the topping with Paul Prudhomme's Seafood Magic seasoning instead.  Very good fish!  I will be making this again!

I made this with cod the other week and served it with Chef John's rice pilaf. It paired perfectly.  We all loved this recipe, in fact it's on the menu tonight. The ONLY change I am making is a little less lemon juice. Husband liked it, but it was a bit much for daughter & myself. 
I did "throw together" the sauce (approx. measurements) to eat on leftover rice...It made a good lunch.

From reading previous posts, broiled for 5 then coated then broiled another 5 or so to get it brown.  It was SOOO good and SO easy!  I just used a little bit of regular onion since I didnt have green ones.  Whole family loved, even the picky ones.  I was happy to broil instead of fry the fish, but wish this was a little healthier... probably why it tasted so good!!  Will def make again!

I've never made or eaten flounder before, and,  seeing it on sale at my local Green Market today, out of curiosity I bought some. Found this recipe and made it tonight. 
It didn't disappoint.
The only change I made was to use lime juice instead of lemon since it was what I had on hand.
This is a lovely recipe. Fast and easy and very flavorful...what more could you want?
Thank you for posting, Lola!

I made it per the recipe but reduced by half the quantity made. I was a bit apprehensive since it was the first time cooking Flounder. No worries! It was an excellent recipe. Thank you for posting this one.

I have been making this recipe for a year now. It is my 'go to' fish recipe. The only change i make is to substitute dill weed for the green onios. We love it-  even hubby, who isn't much of a fish lover.

First words out of the 3 year olds mouth? Mommy! This fish is YUM! I read a lot of the reviews first then tweaked the recipe a bit using some of everything. Firstly I thawed then dried extremely well to keep from getting mushy.  Then seasoned one side only with lemon pepper. For the coating I used  1/2  melted butter and  1/2 olive oil, 1/2 & 1/2 Italian bread crumbs & parm/Romano blend and added a little dried mustard, garlic powder and old bay. I baked on a sprayed foil-lined pan for 8 min. then broiled about 3. Can't wait for hubby to get home to try and also to try out leftovers in a wrap tomorrow for lunch! Oh!!! I can hardly wait for that too!!

This recipe ROCKS!  Not only is it super easy and quick but it's one of the best-tasting fish recipes I've ever tried.  My husband's comment after dinner?  "You can make this ANY time you want!"  Thank you so much for this recipe.  It would be good with just about any kind of mild white fish and takes about 20 minutes total to prepare and cook.  Good job!!

This recipe is very good. I usually make Panko Flounder. This time I had no Panko so I quickly pulled up this recipe and reluctantly tried it. We both really liked it and will make it again.

I loved it. My kids were very skeptical, they ate all of it and said they would eat again.  I followed the recipe exactly.  With my oven, I had to broil it a little longer than 5 minutes.

We loved this recipe. Quick, easy, simple, and delicious. I didn't add the salt because the mayo we use has its own saltiness. Made this twice already, just couldn't have enough of it.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and I was pleasantly surprised.  It was a bit too lemony for me, but the flavor was still good. My fish was not mushy at all because I made sure it was dry.  I will definitely make this again with a little less lemon.

We normally don't buy flounder.  I unthawed the flounder, rinsed it, patted it dry, put it in a cake pan lined with aluminum foil and spray.  I sprinkled sea salt and a little bit of the lemon juice over the fish, but did not add it with the mayonnaise.  I was only cooking 4 fillets, and only had about 1/3 cup of Parmesan left, so I added about 2 tbsp butter, and about 2 tbsp mayonnaise.  Mine did not turn out mushy.

Excellent! Everyone was disappointed that there wasn't more, even me; and I don't usually care for fish. I followed the advice of another reviewer and used crumbs (corn flakes 'cause that's what was on hand) and did a quick broil at the end to crisp it us a bit. The only other change I'd make is to decrease the liquid somehow, because it was very mushy from all the liquid.

I only used one tablespoon of mayo, added capers and a clove (or two) of garlic, and did not totally "liquify" the butter so that it was more of a lose paste to spread onto the fish and then I broiled it. Daughter who HATES fish actually ate it too!

We love this recipe!  It's a snap to make but tastes rich and flavorful.  I used olive oil mayonnaise instead of regular and it worked fine.  This is a good one for people who don't really like fish, it will surprise them.

Living alone it is hard to cook for oneself without cooking to much, so I tried small amounts of everything, and omitted the butter.  One serving flounder, very litely salted on both sides, 2 drops of lemon on each side.  1 tblsp. mayonaise, 1 tblsp. fresh shredded Parmesan, @ 1 tsp. chopped green onion, a couple more drops lemon.  I like lemon flavor, but a little goes along way with me.  This mixture was spread over the flounder and broiled until flakey and lightly brown.  My first try at flounder and it really does have a good flavor. I should add that I cooked mine in a metal pie pan sprayed with Olive Oil.

Easy, quick, and my grudging-fish eating family devoured it and asked for seconds. I was generous with the Parmesan, added a bit of garlic powder and dill, and did as others suggested, broiling for  3-4 min, then adding topping and broiling for 3-4 min. more. Also sprinkled naked fillets with lemon juice instead of adding it to the mix.

I prepared by the recipe except I omitted onion, added about 1/4c panko crumbs and I broiled instead of baked.

It wasn't mushy.  It was greasy and didn't have much flavor.  

I could probably tweak it and get better results, but as written, it was just ok.

I added a little dill and garlic powder like many reviews suggested.  Capers would be good with this as well.  I didn't measure everything exactly, and I didn't weigh the flounder.  I had four filets.  This was absolutely delicious.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Easy dinner!

Let me start this by saying - I am not a seafood eater. However this is amazing. It's light and one of the easiest recipes I've ever used.

I used a little less than a pound of flounder (enough for two people) but followed the rest of the recipe exactly and it was the tastiest thing I've had in ages. This might convert me to a seafood eater after all.

I also broiled this and put the topping on 2x between checking to make sure it didn't burn! I thought it would just taste like breaded fish but it was better. Definitely quick and easy clean up if foil is used.

Quick, simple and very flavorful.  This will certainly be a go to recipe for baked fish.  In addition to coating the uncooked fish with lemon juice, I sprinkled the fillets with a garlic, onion and salt seasoning.  I also added about 1/3 c. of chopped sun dried tomatoes as well as adding more of the green onions (about 3) to the mix.  I did not add any additional butter but used generous tablespoons when adding the mayo.  Next time I will cut down of the amount of parmesan cheese, as in my opinion, it made it a bit too salty.  All in all the fish was wonderful and my husband and I ate every last bite.  I look forward to making it again and again!

Easy meal . But didn't like the flounder this way. Tried it w tilapia and turned out much better. Fish stayed firm. But the flounder mushy.

My first time trying this recipe, didn't really do anything different, aside from using red onion and broiling 3 minutes each side- no baking. Most excellent! Definitely a keeper!

We really loved this dish. It was so simple and flavorful!  I did add sliced fresh garlic, dill seasoning, and substituted goat cheese for the parmesan.  Also I thin sliced a roma tomato and spread it over the tops of the fish.  Thanks so much for this recipe! We will make it again for sure!

Wonderful flavor. Super easy and quick. Took the advice of others and broiled not baked. Fish turned out firm and flaky. For those of you who like capers, placing a few on top of each filet is a delicious addition. Family rated this a keeper.

The flounder was so incredibly moist. Very delicious and I had to substitute sweet onion for the green onion because I didn't have any on hand. Best part is it is gluten free, as well.

This was really great. However I did edit it a little. I tried it twice so far and the first time it was soggy. So I baked it for the 10 minutes like it said then drained the water off of the cookie sheet then put that in the broiler for 3 minutes, pulled it out and put the "sauce" on and put in back in for another 3 minutes in the broiler. Came out firmer and moist. I omitted the lemon juice the second time around for the entire recipe, including the sauce. I also substituted a few pinches of parsley instead of the green onions. So good that my two year old gobbled it up!

Very good tasting but cook time seemed considerably off. I baked 10 and broiled 5 as directed but fish was so mushy I baked for another 20 mins and even then it was still mushy. Not sure what I'm missing or doing wrong there but it still tasted very good.

Great recipe!  For the Vegans out there, this is what I did:

Substitute Veganaise for the Mayo and Nutritional Yeast for the Parmesan.  I did use butter because I'm not that strict of a Vegan. You could use grapeseed or olive oil instead It turned out great! And so easy.

Was sceptical due to the mayo ingredient (sounded too greasy - but the lemon juice saw to that) We liked it alot and will do it again. Did follow other comments and broiled rather than baked.

Excellent! I accidentally made my a little salty and used shredded mozz cheese (didn't have parm) and used minced red onions (didn't have green onions)...delicious! Will probably just sprinkle one side of fish w/salt and will definitely make again and again!

I loved the topping for the top of the fish. But my Flounder went sloppy soft, not good.And the Flounder was dry, I think I'll try 
another type of fish.

Wonderful flavor - I ate 2 pieces!  I do suggest listening to the first step: rinse and then pat dry.  If not, then the founder could be a little mushy.  I did not pat dry and it was mushy, but still delicious!  Keeping recipe to make again.

This was a fantastic and easy recipe to follow.  The picky eaters in my household absolutely loved it.  Thank you Lola!!!!!!!  I am a very boring cook without much talent or knowledge of what flavors go with what, but I am using this again, and I will recommend it to anyone.

Flavor was awesome!  I didn't add the green onion and I just eyeballed everything else.  The fish was mushy.  I had it a couple of days so maybe it was old? Previously frozen? Help!

This came out very gritty when I made it. I used the Parmesan in the green can. Maybe it would have been better if I had used fresh Parmesan.

This was wonderful! My family, including four young, picky children, absolutely gobbled it up. This is one I will certainly be making frequently!
