Do you use bottled lemon juice, or real lemons?  Can't imagine how many lemons I'll need! ??

This was a great way to use up some cucumber.  It's not overly sweet, though still has the thick feel lemonade always has.  Will definitely make again.

Very refreshing.  Loved the basil/cucumber combination.  Had this at a caf√© and was hoping there was a recipe on this site for it.  Thank you for sharing.
