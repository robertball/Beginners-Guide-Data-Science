I cut this down to one serving and altered just a few ingredients to use what I had on hand.  I don't believe the changes altered the outcome of the recipe.  I used one Russet baking potato which I microwaved.  I only had some leftover french onion dip (a mixture of sour cream and onion soup mix) which I used in place of the sour cream.  I layered half the potato which was cut in hunks into the bottom of a small Pyrex baking dish, spread on some dip, covered with a little of both types of cheeses, sprinkled with chopped cooked bacon and sprinkled with salt and pepper.  Then repeated those layers.  I baked at the recommended temperature and time.  Chopped green onion went on top after baking.  This was very good and a different way to eat a baked potato and the toppings that I would normally eat with it.  Thanks!

I made this for a family brunch and it went over great!  I left out the bacon to make it vegetarian and boiled my potatoes (I don't have a microwave.)  I actually boiled the potatoes the day before and put this together in the morning and popped it in the oven.  I added a dash of garlic powder and this was gone!  Easy recipe that's a crowd pleaser!

This was really really tasty, but it was difficult to cook the potatoes in the microwave, maybe should have used whole baking potatoes instead of quartered baby reds? Next time ; )

This recipe was easy to make and it was pretty tasty.  If I make it again I will add more spices as I found it a bit bland for my taste.

This to me was just okay and I will probably not make it again.  I was having a large group of people for dinner and bought enough ingredients to make two pans of these potatoes.  As I started putting the dishes together I found that 1 1/2 pounds of potatoes per pan was no where near enough.  I used 3 pounds of potatoes and the quantities of the other ingredients for just one dish.  The amount of bacon, sour cream and cheese for 3 pounds of potatoes was plenty and would seem that these amounts would be way too much for just 1 1/2 pounds.  I fed 15 people and still had some leftover.
