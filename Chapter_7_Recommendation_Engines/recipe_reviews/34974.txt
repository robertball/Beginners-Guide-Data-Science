This stuff is amazing...I've tried it several times with chicken, beef and shrimp.  It was good with all of them even though I had been hesitant about the shrimp.  I have also substituted yogourt for the cream and it was still quite good.

This is worth the time and effort that goes into making it.  Very complex flavor and not as spicy hot as it may sound.  Yum!

Yummy!  Very different flavor and very good.  I did not try either of the sauces and it was wonderful by itself.  Highly recommended!

We LOVED this recipe.  I would give it TEN stars if I could.  I think we'll make it again for a barbecue this weekend.  We made naan on the grill and ate it with the chicken with some chutney and some raita - SO GOOD!  The recipe for the naan is on this site too.  We loved the marinade so much we used a little of it for dip!

Not so wonderful as everyone else seems to think.  Marinating 24h added nothing, I think I could have cooked the chicken and used the marinate as a dip.  It's a traditional dish that uses heavy cream and not yogurt?  Without the cream/yogurt, the marinate is just green chutney.

I wanted to add to the instructions, to de-seed the peppers (I used jalape√±o and Serrano)using gloves.  My fingers are still burning 24 hours after making the marinade. This was my first foray into kebabs and it was quite easy to make and very tasty, but the peppers left me in lots of pain...lesson learned!

These are just as tender and tasty as other reviewers have noted.  For a little more spice I used habanero peppers instead of jalapenos.  I cooked them wrapped in foil for 25-30 minutes at 350, then put them under the broiler for 3-4 minutes.

Nice, unique taste.  My guests loved it, but since I prefer spicey food that makes me sweat - I myself found it a little bland.

This had a very good flavour.  It had a lot of zing from the jalepenos but not too much heat.  I changed the 1/2 cup cream to 1/4 cup cream and 1/4 cup yogurt.
