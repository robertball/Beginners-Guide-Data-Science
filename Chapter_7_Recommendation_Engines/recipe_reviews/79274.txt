I've made this a couple of times with the following changes - 1C Greek Yogurt, 1/2C Cilantro & 1/4C Mint. Instead of Red Pepper flakes, I've used Cayenne, but more recently tried a Jalapeno pepper (seeded) and that was the recipe I'll forever use. Everything goes into the blender. SO GOOD ON EVERYTHING!!!

I love regular Tzatziki and I guess I should have read the recipe before making it to see that there was no yogurt.  It was ok but tasted more like guacamole than tzatziki.  Next time I will go with my regular tzatziki recipe and add some avocado into it.

Great twist on guacamole!  We served it with toasted whole wheat pitas and Greek Penne and Chicken (also from this site.)  Superb!

I don't know what tzatziki sauce is supposed to taste like, but this recipe made an excellent salad dressing!  I just threw everything together and blended it.  Delicious!

Don't omit the sour cream. Use lime juice instead of lemon. Up the amount of garlic. Keep an eye on it while it's refridgerating (mine started to discolor surprisingly quickly). I agree, this is a great dip, but can also be used to complement Mexican and Middle Eastern dishes. Thanks!

Yum Yum Yum!  I was delightfully impressed by this, made a nice sauce for my falafel sandwich! The flavor was just right, I added a little dill weed at the end, only for personal preference! Thanks for sharing!

This was excellent!  Only change was to use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream - I think I would have liked it even better with sour cream, or maybe a combination of the two.  I love guacamole, but this is a great change of pace!  I used it on veggie burgers,  but I can think of hundreds of ways to use this.  Thanks for sharing!

I was all set out to make a regular tzatziki sauce, but realized I had an avocado that needed to be used today before going bad. I did an ingredient search and found this recipe. I used Greek Yogurt since I had no sour cream, and it taste great. I sort of eyeballed the ingredients. My avocado wasn't very big and so the flavor isn't overwhelming. I'm eating as veggie dip right now. Pretzels are pretty good with it also.

very tasty, I didn't have the cucumber so I made it without.  Was thicker than would have been with the cucumber, but still good!

Delicious!!! I found myself enjoying this with pretzels...?  Great with hummus too.  I used some dried mint instead of fresh, and I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  Will make again.

I used ground red pepper instead of the red pepper flakes to distribute the flavor better.  I omitted fresh mint because I didn't have any and omitted the cucumber because that sounded a little different.  I use the recipe every time I serve lamb, gyros, etc. and it is always loved.  5 star!

We used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream, so maybe that's why this had such a weird tang to it.  Will go with the sour cream next time.  The mint and cilantro flavors are wonderful.

Unique recipes like this are difficult to rate because it’s not the recipe’s fault if you don’t like it.  I love tzatziki sauce and I love guacamole, but this wasn’t anything like I imagined.   I imagined tasting avocado and cilantro, but that wasn’t the case.  The mint really takes over and isn’t what I would even expect in a tzatziki sauce.  As far as the avocado, the only thing it did was give it a beautiful green color.

This recipe is really yummy. I used it in my falafel pita sandwiches and it was a big hit. I made the recipe as written with no modifications. My husband loved it and he is hard to please.

Delicious! Made with homemade falafel salad and it was so yummy. I thought it might taste more like guacamole, but it is definitely tzatziki.

If I could give this 10 stars I would.  This was absolutely to die for.  I did use the sour cream, which I think really puts it over the top. The only thing I changed was to add much less red pepper because I don't like things too spicy. I served it with Baked Falafel and homemade pita bread, but I think it would be just as good as a regular sandwich spread.  This is a must try if you like avocados.

This was great-thanks! I didn't have mint or cilantro though, so I used some dill. It still came out great. I also used yogurt instead of sour cream. The avocado and yogurt make a great combo!

I do not care for traditional Tzatsiki made with yogurt.  We frequent a small Greek spot here in Omaha and I love their Tzatziki so I figured it was sour cream and NOT yogurt... and now I can make it myself with this recipe!  It's insanely delicious!!  Mmmmmmmm!

Love the addition of the avocado! Actually added avocado to a traditional Tzatziki recipe & it worked also. Adds a wonderfully smooth texture to the dip.

Omg this is good stuff!  Instead of sour cream I used plain Greek yogurt which worked great and lowered the calories.  We dipped grilled chicken in this but it would be great on and with so many things.  Keeper for sure!

A nice change for tzatziki sauce.  I did use Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream as that is what I had on hand.  As written, it is a very nice dip that could also be used as a salad dressing.  I was just looking for a little more flavor, so I added a jalapeño to the mix.  That is what my taste buds were looking for.  This has a nice creamy texture and would also work well in a wrap.  I made this for work and my co-workers enjoyed it.

I didn't have any cucumber so I was looking for an alternative tzatziki.  This was so tasty!  We ate it with chicken gyros, and it was perfect.

Cool and refreshing and makes a good salsa for dipping tortilla chips. I used chocolate mint from garden and limes instead of lemons. I seeded the cucumber but added pulp and seeds for mashing with avocado. Sour cream or yogurt is a must for using it to dip. I wouldn't change a thing about ingredients.

WOW!! I love avocado so I thought this was so good. I'm vegan so I substituted vegan mayo for the sour cream. I'm sure it would taste awesome with the sour cream as well. I was just going to use it as a dressing for my falafel salad, but I think I'm going to be using this for every salad!!

I had some cukes and an avocado that were on the way out, so I searched and came across this recipe. I'm not crazy about Tzatziki sauce, but I do like guacamole. I did like the creamy texture of this. I used a chopped, seeded jalapeno pepper. I couldn't taste much spiciness so I also added a little cayenne. I did use the sour cream, which I recommend and replaced the lemon juice with lime juice. I also used jarred garlic and later added more garlic and onion powder. Salt and pepper are needed here, too. It's been in the fridge for a few hours, and I just tried some with tortilla chips. Very good! This would go great with Indian food or as a veggie dip, as the submitter states, or Mexican food, too. NOTE: I just had this on the side with a homemade fish taco wrap, but I can see using this as the spread INSIDE of the wrap, as well.

This was a bit hit and I wish I doulbed the recipe!  The only real change I made was to omit the cucumbers so keep a nice smooth texture.

Made this last night for dinner and can't wait for lunch time to eat the leftovers.  Used plain coconut yogurt in place of the sour cream and is delicious. I'm on a dairy, grain and sugar free diet and this recipe allowed me to eat something so tasty!  Thank You!

I am a huge fan of this recipe though I did adjust as a few others did.  First, I did not use any garlic, cilantro or mint.  Second, I only used 1 cup of Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream.  Lastly, I don't seed the cucumber because I enjoy the texture.  I am on a pretty caloric strict diet so this became my meal for lunch.  1 cup of Greek yogurt, small Hass avocado, juice of one lemon, one peeled cucumber and the seasonings turned out to be about 400 calories for the whole dish.  Perfect!  I LOVE this and can eat it with almost anything, or like a salad.  The lemon serves the dual purpose of preventing browning and adding a great tart/bright flavor.  This is probably my all time favorite recipe on this site.  I hate cilantro and don't use much mint but frankly, this recipe doesn't need it.  Delicious, satisfying and diet friendly.
