I've prepared a similar appetizer that involved making a small cut down the back of a large or jumbo peeled shrimp and inserting a slice of mild jalapeno pepper before wrapping with bacon.  I've found that by winding 1/3 of a bacon slice, starting at one end and finishing at the other end to achieve a single thickness, the bacon has a better chance of cooking adequately and evenly.  To cook, I heat the oven temp on the broil setting, add the wrapped shrimp, cook for 2 minutes, turn the shrimp over and broil for another 2 minutes, then turn the oven off and allow the shrimp to finish cooking as the temp gradually decreases.  By the time the shrimp begins to turn pink, the bacon will be cooked.

These are fantastic~  I wish I would have made more.  A guest at our superbowl party ate two and he is allergic to shrimp, but he said they are soooo good.  I used pre-cooked bacon and it was perfect when I baked it for 10 minutes. Will be making these again for other get togethers.

I don't know if it was the bacon, or "Johnny's Grub Rub," also from this site, or both, but this was just spectacular.  We partially cooked the bacon in the microwave to make sure it was cooked through without overcooking the shrimp. We also found that since the shrimp we used were the 21-25 count that they needed to be in the oven just nine minutes, so watch the cooking time carefully.  I served this with Green Rice III and it was a match made in heaven.  Words are inadequate to describe how delicious and beautiful this was.

I love shrimp, and I loved this recipie!
I added McCormick's Montreal Steak seasoning and the shrimp tasted great, everybody liked them. I bought giant shrimps and its better than the restaurant because I can eat as much shrimp as I want for less money.

Thanks Jan

These were as good as any I have ever gotten in a restaurant! I did make a couple of alterations however. I did not use BBQ seasoning but instead marinated the shrimp for a few hours in a little hickory brown sugar BBQ sauce, just enough to coat the shrimp (figured it wouldn't be any messier than the seasoning when wrapping w/ bacon). I cut the bacon into thirds & also added tiny little slivers of jalapenos. I then sprinkled them w/ steak seasoning & allowed them to rest as the recipe states.

Just some tips for anyone who hasn't made this yet...don't use thick cut bacon! LOL! I cooked the bacon in the microwave for 2 minutes before wrapping the shrimp and it just never got crisp. Next time I'm going to try again with thin cut bacon :) This is a RICH food and even though it didn't come out the way I expected, it was still very delicious.

I have a similar recipe where I dip the wrapped shrimp in a chipotle BBQ sauce and place them on the grill...simply awesome! And for added zip, I added a strip of jalepeno pepper along the back of the shrimp before wrapping it. This last touch had everyone raving.

This dish is fabulous! I served with dirty rice and cornbread and my husband could not stop raving! I used the precooked bacon you can buy in a box at the grocery store and everything turned out just right. Thanks Jan!

I thought this was pretty good, but I think next time I'd turn the shrimp over once while cooking.  One side of the bacon didn't seem to get as cooked as the other.  That's the only change I'd make, though.  Otherwise the taste was really good.

These are excellent!! I recommend marinating the bacon in barbeque sauce overnight before making. The shrimp was tender and the bacon nice and crisp. I will definitely make these again many many more times!!

This was really good and really simple to make. Before adding the bacon, I cooked it some and also added a bit of season salt and pepper - then followed the recipe as it is listed. Yum Yum...Have fun cooking!

only reason I gave this four stars is because I had to use sweet baby rays bbq sauce rather than BBQ seasoning!  I also stuffed in some blue cheese before rolling on the bacon.  I went for a full slice on each large shrimp and I dont think I would change that...more the enjoy!! So..pre cook the bacon a bit for sure...clean the shrimp, brush with bbq sauce, stuff some blue cheese in the back, wrap with full piece of bacon and toothpick it!  I brushed a tiny bit more of the sauce on top- in oven at 450...about 5 minutes tops!  DELISH!  I really wish I hade more! Yummmmmyyyy.

I made this tonight for my brother & sister inlaw, on a raining even when we couldn't get out with the baby. It was great! I did change something a bit with the bacon. Instead of the ragular bacon, I used a maple bacon it added a sweet succulent flavor to the BBQ Seasoned shrimp (Seasoning by Chef Paul). It was a bit time consuming, because I had to cook the bacon a bit first. I do recommend it for others to try everywhere. : )

I served these as an appetizer and they were quite good!  I used high quality apple smoked bacon precooked a bit in the microwave.  A baking sheet lined with foil was all I needed since precooking the bacon made a rack unnecessary since there was little grease.  About eight minutes was all my 21-25 count shrimp needed in the oven.  Seasoning and wrapping the shrimp the night before I served them worked perfectly.

OK, I've been making this for the past 20 years.  But do this instead if you can:  remove the shell on the tail, (people like to eat the entire shrimp, they hold it with the tooth pick.) Put the shrimp wrapped in bacon in a deep bowl of your favorite BBQ sauce for a couple of hours, letting it set in the fridge. Put a sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil on the grill, set at medium high heat and then place the shrimp lathered in sauce on the foil.  Turning them occasionally, it should take about 15 or 20 minutes to cook.  Remove and chow down.  I guarantee they will be the hit of any gathering you take these to.

This was excellent! I had a request for shrimp tonight and this turned out to be a pleasant surprise! A big Mahalo to Naples34102 for mentioning the barbeque seasoning which she used for this shrimp recipe. I used a 26/30 count shrimp, that I cleaned, deveined and cut down the middle of the back. I partially cooked the bacon, then cut each slice into 1/3's using toothpick's to secure the bacon to the shrimp. I sprinkled just a little of, "Johnny's Grub Rub," from this website, onto the bacon and set it aside a while. I placed the shrimp onto a baking sheet that I sprayed with Pam. After the first 2 minutes, I turned the shrimp over to the other side to bake, then waited another 2-3 minutes until I saw the shrimp had turned the pink/orange color indicating it was cooked. I took them out from the oven since I did not want the shrimp to turn tough and rubbery. This was so delicious and flavorful. The shrimp is seasoned just right and the shrimp is cooked perfectly. What more could I ask from this dish?! Not difficult to prepare with nice results. It was a real hit with everyone and it was the very first thing that disappeared on everyone's plate! This was a real nice change from the normal shrimp dishes that we eat in this house. I served this dish with "Green Rice III," and "Carrots in Dill Butter," all from this website. Mahalo!

I once had something similar and I've made it a few times. You butterfly your shrimp stuff it with cream cheese wrap it in bacon and deep fry it. You use your favorite bbq sauce for dipping and it is great!!!!

Easy and SO tasty! I used turkey bacon instead of pork, worked just fine for me. The second time I made this, I mixed up some barbecue sauce, worcestershire sauce, and old bay seasoning to coat the shrimp with, then I wrapped the bacon around 'em. Even more delicious!

These were liked by my husband and daughter. I precooked the bacon so it would be done without overcooking the shrimp. Served sweet Thai chili sauce on the side for dipping. Thanks!

This was excellent! I had a request for shrimp tonight and this turned out to be a pleasant surprise! A big Mahalo to Naples34102 for mentioning the barbeque seasoning which she used for this shrimp recipe. I used a 26/30 count shrimp, that I cleaned, deveined and cut down the middle of the back. I partially cooked the bacon, then cut each slice into 1/3's using toothpick's to secure the bacon to the shrimp. I sprinkled just a little of, "Johnny's Grub Rub," from this website, onto the bacon and set it aside a while. I placed the shrimp onto a baking sheet that I sprayed with Pam. After the first 2 minutes, I turned the shrimp over to the other side to bake, then waited another 2-3 minutes until I saw the shrimp had turned the pink/orange color indicating it was cooked. I took them out from the oven since I did not want the shrimp to turn tough and rubbery. This was so delicious and flavorful. The shrimp is seasoned just right and the shrimp is cooked perfectly. What more could I ask from this dish?! Not difficult to prepare with nice results. It was a real hit with everyone and it was the very first thing that disappeared on everyone's plate!

These are great! I use regular thin cut bacon, pre cooked some, because I grilled them on a grill pan. For the seasoning I used Bacon Salt with some brown sugar mixed in. DELISH!!!

I used pre-cleaned and precooked shrimp so I baked the bacon in the oven for about 8 minutes, wrapped the shrimp then but back in the oven for about 6 more minutes to heat up the shrimp and avoid over cooking the shrimp. I used pepper bacon.  Made these for Christmas Eve with extended family everyone loved them.  Will keep making these.

I pre-cooked the bacon for a few minutes in the microwave, then instead of wrapping each one I just intertwined the bacon/shrimp along the pre-soaked bamboo skewers. Used the Johnny's Grub Rub from this site as suggested by others, then grilled them outdoors. Shrimp & bacon (anything with bacon) how can you go wrong? But I'm still looking for the perfect seasoning!

We followed the recipe EXACTLY and neither myself or my bacon-loving fiance could eat more than one. I think these might actually be worthwhile if grilled, but if not, they were wayyyyy too fatty because unlike normal cooking of bacon, the bacon just gets soggy instead of crisping up.

Fantastic and really, really easy.  I grilled mine in a grill basket instead of baking.  The grill gave them a great grilled, smoky flavor that brought out the flavor of the shrimp.  Make sure to turn them so they don't become charred on one side.

I would definitely precook the bacon a little bit and watch th time.  My med/large (41 ct) prawns were done in 9-10 minutes.

Otherwise  absolutely incredible!!!

Good recipe.  I made half as the recipe stated, and I added a glaze of half maple syrup/half Sweet Baby Ray's barbecus sauce to the others.  The original ones were really good, but the ones with the glaze were fantastic!

OMG!!!  These were absolutely delicious.  I followed other cooks tips and nuked the bacon a little before wrapping.  They turned out perfect.  You could make yourself sick with these.  Oh, by the way...just use a broiler pan instead of messing with the foil stuff!

I made this in my rotisserie instead of oven. I put it on skewers and cooked it - turned out nicely because they rotate and cook evenly. I think next time I will brush with barbeque sauce while cooking. It was a little too spicy for me with the dry barbeque seasoning.

This is delicious and idea to cook the bacon a bit beforehand helps keep the shrimp moist and the bacon doesn't char as it's cooking.  I added a chunk of fresh pineapple to the wrap and yummy!  Salty, sweet and yummy!  Thanks for this great,  simple, and delish recipe!  :)

I started these last night and finished them this morning.  I got the shrimp peeled, deveined, and used Kraft Thick and Spicy Brown Sugar Barbecue Sauce to cover it overnight.  I used the same to cover the maple flavored bacon.

Since I used 16-20ct Jumbo Shrimp I let them cook for 10 minutes, and they were fine.  I did not precook the bacon, but I like mine soft.

This was entered in my school's cooking contest and won 2nd place.  I get 1/2 a day off!!!!!  AND there were no leftovers.

Fantastique! I bought two pounds of shrimp, and I cut my [one pounds' worth of] bacon slices into thirds instead of halves. Had a little shrimp leftover (made a quick scampi out of them & threw in the fridge for later). I did not use toothpicks, the bacon ends overlapped perfectly so I put that side down on the rack. Used my broiling pan, worked perfectly. I was looking for a slam-dunk appetizer, this was definitely a hit!!

I haven't tried this yet, but over 20 years ago I lived outside of D.C. and there was a restaurant that we frequented that did this same thing BUT STUFFED THE SHRIMP WITH CHEESE!!!!!  They were awesome!  Just thought I would pass that option on!

Very, very good, for something so simple. Three ingredients; how easy is that? The labor does take a little time, but the flavor to labor ratio is high, so the time spent is so worth it. I imagine that this recipe offers a lot of flexibility for modifications down the road. Oh, one other thing (and this falls under common sense, but it took me half way through to realize it) ... when placing the toothpicks in the shrimp, they should go in sideways, not top to bottom, so that they lay flat in the oven.

I make thse often and they are great.  For a little extra kick I add a slice of Jalapeno pepper,a water chestnut for the crunch, and a small piece of pineapple to cool the palate after the pepper.  I cook mine on the grill.

I precooked the bacon just enough where it was slightly browned yes soft enough to still wrap. This way it was cooked evenly on both sides and not gross. I skewered it and threw it on the grill, using barbeque sauce....delicious!!I've also tried this using apricot jelly mixed with a little ketchup. This was delicious to. You can get crafty with this.

The bacon wasn't crispy, but the shrimp were definitely done. I used jumbo shrimp and half a slice each of bacon. I would probably cut down to 1/3 a slice of bacon so it wraps just once around. I even tried broiling them to crisp them up more which worked a little bit. The flavor is good though. I will definitely make these again and play with the recipe a bit.

these cooked up fine (I did precook bacon slightly), but just wasn’t enough flavor.  I made them again and basted with bbq sauce which improved it.

Really easy to make and super great to take to parties! I would recommend not using thick cut bacon.. its hard to wrap around the shrimp and needs to cook longer.  I also tweaked it a little bit by butterflying the shrimp and adding a sliver of jalapeno to each.. super awesome, super easy, super yummy :)

This was very good! Very easy to make. :) Great idea! I didn't have bbq seasoning on hand so marinated the shrimp & bacon in bbq sauce. My hubby really liked it but thought there was actually too much bbq sauce that you couldn't taste the shrimp. So maybe next time I'll try the seasoning.

These are really, really good.  Do partially cook your bacon first, so the shrimp don't overcook.  Try serving these with some good quality honey mustard dressing.  Puts it right over the top!

Great recipe! But use your own fave BBq sauce cause I like mine sweet and tangy so I made up my own by mixing two different kinds of BBq sauce and lemon juice and maple syrup. IMPORTANT TIP: Dump the shrimp in the sauce before wrapping in bacon. It keeps the BBq taste of the shrimp separate from the bacon so when it’s done tastes like heaven when bitten together because both are on equal ground instead of the feeling like you missed something. Its heaven and I swear on this. DO SO!

Very simple & tasty. Definately precook the bacon. Not until crispy, just slightly. I used huge prawns, that required 1 whole bacon slice per prawn. I think you could mix it up with a seasoning of choice. Also note, this is rich & should not be the main part of your dinner. It's a great appetizer or would be perfect with steak. Thanks.

Great recipe, I used BBQ sauce and added a strip of gouda to the wrap.  I used smaller shrimp, but cut the bacon into 1/3 slice and it worked out fine, cooking everything evenly. My husband said it was delicious!!

This is a quick and excellent recipe.  I've wrapped onion or jalepeno in with the shrimp.  Best on the grill!

Overall excellent. Kids didn't like too much, but they aren't the biggest shellfish fans.
The grownups loved 'em, and I wish I had made more. I halved the recipe cause we had oysters too. Wish I'd just made the shrimp!

This recipe was sooo good. My husband and I ate a whole batch on our own. I used 2 different kinds of A1 Dry Rubs and thick, farm fresh bacon. 450 degrees for 10 minutes cooked the bacon and shrimp perfectly. I can't wait to go to make this again. Great, easy appetizer!

This was amazing.  I took the recommendation of one of the reviewers below (MDGATOR81), and marinated the Bacon Wrapped shrimp in Sweet Baby Ray's (or whatever you like) for a couple hours in the fridge.  then I put them in the basket on my counter top Rotisserie BBQ grill and spun them into something ridiculous.  They were so good!  I would highly recommend this recipe and if you have a rotisserie device use it!

Good but you have to pre-cook the bacon.  I used extra large wild caught shrimp.  Only 13, but boy these were good and filling.  Soaked them in BBQ sauce with extra smoke sauce added.  Broiled them for 3 minutes on a side and then (like some one else said) left them in the oven for another 5 minutes until they were pink.  Yeah baby!

Great recipe. However, I have discovered some substitutions. I did microwave the bacon as many suggested.  The first time I made it I ran out of BBQ seasoning about halfway through my shrimp, so I substituted mesquite and liked it better than the BBQ seasoning. I prefer the smokey mesquite flavor over the sweetness of the BBQ seasoning. Also, I decided that I did not want bacon on all of the shrimp so I dipped some in the bacon grease and rolled them  in the seasoning.  They were equally tastey. I served the shrimp to a group of friends last wek and they all raved over them.  This recipe is a keeper!  I encourage you to try it with the mesquite seasoning.

As suggested by others, I slightly pre-cooked the bacon even with the raw shrimp.  Half a slice was sufficient for the size shrimp I used. I wasn't heavy with the BBQ seasoning, just average. The cooking time in the recipe was perfect.  Excellent dish, great flavor.  Will definitely make again.

These are soooo good and easy to make.  I have made them the last 2 years for our family's Christmas get together.  Once finished, I put them in a crock pot set on low to keep them warm.  It is always the first thing gone.  I've already been 'told' that I am bringing them again this year!

YU-UM!  I precooked my bacon a little first because I've been down that road before (lol).  Then, I wrapped each with a half a piece of bacon, skewered, and grilled.  Instead of BBQ seasoning, I brushed with a sweet BBQ sauce right at the end of grilling.  (I actually took Sweet Baby Ray's original sauce and added honey and brown sugar to it until it was the sweetness that I wanted!).  These were utterly delicious!

I altered this recipe and used blackening seasoning instead of BBQ and sprinkled with parmesan cheese. I also pre-cooked the bacon for 2 minutes in the microwave...delicious!

This is great as an appetizer or a main course.  I would suggest being carful as to how much barbeque seasoning you use as the bacon already has plenty of salt.  I also used a sweet teriyaki sauce for dipping (excellent)

So impressive!  They looked beautiful, and smelled even better!  I used large shrimp (26 - 30 per lb.).  I seasoned with Wildtree Herbs' Memphis Barbeque Rub (dry seasoning blend) directly on the shrimps, then wrapped with partially cooked strips of bacon & secured with toothpicks.  I served them with a warm bowl of Nana's Barbeque Sauce (from this site) for dipping.  Great super bowl fare!  I can't wait to make them again!

These were okay.  We used Old Bay seasoning and some Cajun Seasoning.  We didn't precook the bacon, so it wasn't done and the shrimp were starting to get a little rubbery when we took them out.

Good recipe, but be sure to pre-cook bacon as it cooks so long the shrimp get rubbery. Adding a sauce such as the one that goes with bacon wrapped water chestnuts might really add to this recipe.

Ok this was really nice but i made a few changes. I bought the prawns ( shrimp) green peeled and eveined them than i wiped them down and sprinkled them with season all and some with garlic butter. next i wrapped bacon around the using tooth pick to sercure them and i placed the on MY BBQ ( the griddle section) they took about 1 - 2 minutes each side. than i laid them on a bed of fried rice. ( didnt need the sauce there was so much flavour from what i did.) we had left overs ( they are very filling ) so took them to my inlaws and they didnt last a minute there, next time i have guest i will be impressing them with this easier yet fancy way of serving prawns ( shrimp) THANK YOU SO MUCH! P.S they turn out better than the balck stump ones and much cheaper. 25 prawns cost me $12.00 Austrailian.

We added this recipe to our "Gourmet Menu" and it received rave review from the group.  Using large shrimp is a must.  Cooking the bacon just a bit before wrapping it around the shrimp help.  The key is to have the bacon done, but not overcook the shrimp!

These shrimp are really to die for. They are awesome. Thank you Jan, you rule! I had shrimp like this as an appetizer at a local restaurant, but making them myself was so much more fun and economical too. I actually liked these better. P.S. If you put the rack to soak in hot soapy water while you eat, it will wipe clean with a sponge by the time your ready to wash up.

I sometimes egg and bread the shrimp and wrap them in bacon and put my favorite bbq sauce on towards the end.. full of flavor! Either way bread or not the bbq sauce makes it.

this is the best recipe to take to a pitch-in or party. these suckers never stood a chance!! they were the first dish gone at the pitch-in i brought them to. everyone who had them was raving, and everyone who missed out was sulking. i let the bacon-wrapped shrimp sit in the fridge overnight with the dry rub. so flavorful and decadent!!

I used frozen peeled and cleaned shrimp, medium sized, but I broiled the shrimp. It crisped the bacon without making the shrimp rubbery. Broiling was done visually, flipping the shrimp when the bacon looked sizzling and partially brown. It's turned out very well for me twice now.

Simple yet elegant side dish. I basted with BBQ sauce and flavor was amazing. Pre-cooked bacon slightly because I prefer crisp bacon. Cooking time was spot on.

I love these... I make these to impress on the grill. I precook the bacon put several bacon wrapped shrimp on each long pre-soaked bamboo skewers (and I have had no trouble keeping them wrapped up in the fridge for a couple hours at this stage- so you can make them ahead ) and when ready, grill them until the shrimp are nearly done, then wipe on some BBQ sause just before I take them off the grill.   That little char from the grill take them to a whole new level.

I cooked the bacon a bit first since they would take longer to cook than the shrimp.  I had trouble though keeping the bacon on the shrimp even with a couple toothpicks.  They would fall apart when I tried to turn the shrimps over.  I end up getting frustrated and cooking everything in a pan.  My husband said they were still good but I was disappointed because I was going for "presentation"!  I think I could master it with a few tries but my first time wasn't so good.

This was fantastic and simple! I let my shrimp sit in the the fridge in hickory honey bbq sauce for an hour. I had thick sliced hickory smoked bacon that I microwaved on a plate, covered with a paper towel for 5 minutes. Once the bacon cooled, I wrapped the shrimp, added the toothpicks, and put it back into the sauce and added more sauce and let sit in the fridge another 30 minutes. Once ready, I baked it for 6 minutes on each side and sprinkled (dry) bbq seasoning on it. Great recipe and easy to add to or switch around. Thanks!

I loved them.  I did them a little different though.  I season the shrimp with a little bit of emeril's seasoning, wrap them with bacon and brush smoked barbeque sauce on both sides and  baked them.  They go fast at parties.  Make a lot!

Like others did, I cooked the bacon in the microwave first, and I used sweet baby rays.  This was AWSOME.  Have made this several times and will continue to make it.

these are really good, easy to make. I took the tails off, precooked the bacon a little and dipped the shrimp in BBQ sauce. Will be making these again.

I've heard of this recipe but never made it before. Great success. Marinated shrimp in BBQ sauce abt an hour. Did what others suggested & slightly pre-cooked bacon in microwave. The rack is a good idea, as is the foil. All worked really well. Served on a bed of brown rice with a side of cole slaw. COULD use BBQ sauce or something else (Ranch?) for dipping but we thought it was fine without anything extra. Thanks for a great & EASY idea!

Not the best recipe I've gotten off the site, but granted I didn't have the exact BBQ ingredient.  It was good though.  Colossal Shrimp from Trader Joes worked perfect, but don't use thick bacon - it won't stay wrapped.

Great recipe.  Being a Texan, spicy are us.  Halve several large jalapenos, clean seeds out (unless you like super spicy), place a shrimp in a jalapeno halve and wrap bacon around that.  Really good appetizer.

it's a great recipe and easy too, but for me, i just didn't like the bacon on the shrimp. i will agree that it did make the moistest grilled shrimp i've ever cooked! i just had to unwrap mine before i could eat it. but, otherwise, great shrimp!!! i will make again even with the bacon and will just unwrap mine. you can't beat the moistest of these grilled shrimp!

yum yum yum.  Really enjoyed this recipe.  I did not use any seasoning.  I prefered the taste of the bacon and shrimp alone.  I pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave for three minutes before wrapping the shrimp.  I also used pre-cooked shrimp.  Made sure shrimp was completely wrapped with bacon so that it would not dry out.  My husband is looking forward to serving these at his next poker night.  Great recipe.

I must say, there was not a single piece of this left at half time of the Super Bowl game!  Everyone loved these and asked if I had more.  Instead of adding bbq seasoning, I slightly precooked the bacon, coated both sides with Kraft Original bbq sauce, wrapped bacon around each individual shrimp and secured it w/ a toothpick.  They were juicy and flavorful.  I will definitely be serving these again!

The only shrimp I had was more medium in size, so I cut the bacon in half and fried it a little before wrapping the shrimp.  So tasty and so easy  Yummy!!

Oh my gosh!  This is incredible!  I misread the recipe and used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce on the shrimp.  I had a bag of colossal (6" across!) butterflied shrimp that I thawed and shelled.  Then, I added the shrimp and some of the BBQ sauce to the bag that the shrimp came in, closed it, and let it marinate overnight.  Before cooking, I wrapped the shrimp in thick-sliced bacon, then cooked following the suggestions of another reviewer:  I broiled them on each side (after lining the drip pan with foil) until the bacon was crispy.  Then, turned off the oven, shut the door, and let it sit in the warm oven for another 5 minutes.  Everything was perfectly cooked and the flavor was incredible.  Everyone kept saying the shrimp tasted like lobster, which we all love.  I will definitely make this recipe again, with the Baby Ray BBQ sauce as a marinade. If the shrimp are smaller, I'll use regular-sliced bacon, rather than thick-sliced.  Thank you, for the wonderful recipe, and to the reviewer for the suggestion about broiling, then letting the shrimp finish in the warm oven.  And, thank Heaven for the happy accident that led me to using BBQ sauce, rather than BBQ seasoning.  On a scale of 1 - 10, this rates at the very top!

This one was a winner, all of the flavors came together nicely.  We used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce on them.  Cooked for 12 minutes & then broiled for about 2 min to crisp up the bacon.

My husband absolutely loved this dish and wants me to make again really soon. Even though I used colossal shrimp, I still cooked the bacon in the microwave for 2 mins then wrapped the shrimp. 

Thanks Jan!

Awesome recipe.  I used a BBQ rub that was a little too salty so next time I will use a sweet BBQ sauce instead of the rub.  Even though they were salty they were still delicious.  I took others advice and put them under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp up the bacon.  I also turned them over during this process.

I use turkey bacon and they're awesome!  I precook the bacon for 1 minute and wrap 1/2 slice per shrimp.  I then place on a large broiler pan, baste heavily with barbecue sauce, and broil till extra crispy.

I subbed cajun seasoning, which was much saltier than bbq seasoning, so that made it a little salty for my taste.  Definitely need to pre-cook the bacon about halfway.  Get creative - any seasoning without too much salt would probably be great.

This was a big hit.  I didn't have dry bbq seasoning, so I used Emrils' essence.  I precooked the bacon some, and used the medium shrimp. It's a little time consuming wrapping, but well worth the effort.  Thanks for the post Jan!

This is a really tasty dish, and a treat if you are on a low-carb diet.  I didn't have barbeque seasoning so I substituted a little seasoned salt, and a sprinkle of Old Bay.  It turned out great.

I made this pretty much per the recipe, but if I followed the recipe exactly, it just wouldn't be me. I started with plump fresh wild caught 16/20 prawns. Size matters. I don't mind peeling them, but I always get the ones that are de-veined because de-veining is time consuming and I have other things I'd rather be doing than removing the poop shoot out of shrimp. After peeling, I sprinkled them with McCormick's Mojito-Lime seasoning and a light sprinkle of jalapeno powder, then wrapped them in thin sliced bacon. I then let them rest in the freezer for about an hour so they would be firm and cold, but not frozen. Then I put them in a 145 degree smoker, which was loaded with alder and apple. I smoked them with fairly heavy smoke for a little less than an hour, at which time I coated them in a thin layer of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce  and transferred them to a 400 degree grill using oak and maple as fuel. I cooked them using indirect heat for about 30 minutes - moving them around every 10 minutes so they would all cook consistently. People that say "If you're looking, you're not cooking" are wrong. If you're not looking, you're not cooking consistently. Every grill/smoker has hot spots, so you have to rotate your food to cook evenly, especially shrimp. Just add a little time to your cook - it's worth the results... When the shrimp was just passed opaque and the bacon was semi-crispy, I pulled them off and served them hot. These got a unanimous five star rating from my four dinne

I made this for a Superbowl party and everyone LOVED them I'm only giving 4 stars since  I did change the recipe though.  Here is my method...  I used frozen shrimp (peel on), pre-cooked bacon (the kind in the box) and Masters Hand Fire & Brimstone Hot BBQ sauce and also their dry seasoning.  I defrosted shrimp under cold running water, peeled them and then patted dry with paper towels.  Seasoned both sides with BBQ dry seasoning.  Wrapped each shrimp with 1/2 slice of bacon, securing with a toothpick.  Then dunked/dredged each one in the BBQ sauce and placed on a broiler pan.  I baked them at 450 for 10 min then dumped them in a pre-heated serving bowl.  Everyone raved about them!   Using the pre-cooked bacon eliminates the chance of the bacon being under-cooked and the shrimp being drowned in grease.  It's also much faster than having to pre-cook raw bacon before wrapping the shrimp.

This was a waste of shrimp and bacon. The BBQ seasoning ruined the dish for me.

I did not follow the recipe to the letter...  For the barbecuing seasoning I used Penzey's 3000  barbecue spice blend.  I put about 1 T on top of 13 (20-25) shrimp.  I cut the butterfly deeper and stuck a sliver of jalapeno and then added a sliver of pepper jack cheese and wrapped with bacon.  I only had thick bacon, so I nuked that for about 2.5 minutes to get it soft and pliable and used only 1/2 a piece of bacon for each shrimp.  I then closed up my package with a toothpick.  I broiled the shrimp for about 8 minutes.  Armando, my other half, stated that this was a 9.5 out of 10 meal!! We served this with vegetable rice, tossed salad and some warm bread!  Yummy!!!

I misread this & used bbq sauce instead of seasoning.  It was good.  I only used a small amount of bacon on each shrimp (1/5 strip) & am glad that I didn't use more as it would've been overpowering if I did more.  I also used Schwan's fully cooked bacon for it.  I cooked half the shrimp this way & half with just the bbq sauce.

I think we go to the same restaurant. I changed mine a little and added shaved deli honey ham. I put the ham (approx middle of the palm size) then wrapped the bacon around each one. I also used lg prawns and put them on the George Forman grill. I heated the bbq sauce in skillet and put the cooked shrimp wrap in the bbq sauce/glaze. My family LOVED it.

Very good...
These are easy to make and quite delicious.  The only thing is, I didn't have a rack for the pan. Midway through cooking, I drained most of the fat from the bottom of the pan with a spoon and added a bit more bbq sauce.  Loved it!

This was great recipe.  It was easy and so tasty.  I made the mistake of under-seasoning with the bbq rub.  It was still good but next time I will really season better.  Wonderful recipe I will be making it again soon!

I make this as well but I do not like soggy bacon so I use the precooked bacon from the package cut in 1/2.  Then it turns out crispy when the shrimp are done.  Sometimes I add a dab of Sweet Baby Rays for fun!

So simple but SO good.  I precook the bacon slightly, used 1/3 piece of bacon per shrimp and lots of bbq sauce.  This is definitely a keeper.

Easy...Easy...Easy!! I wrapped my shrimp in the bacon, stuck toothpicks through them, dipped them in the BBQ sauce and served them as appetizers. I also whipped these up in the middle of cooking dinner they were that easy.

If I could give this six stars, I would.  My mother and I underestimated just how much shrimp is in two pounds, and so we had a few stragglers.  I love bacon.  I love shrimp.  I had the utmost confidence in this recipe and I was not proven wrong.  My mom and I have decided that we are not going to tell ANYONE about this!

Absolutely wonderful.  Needed a quick meal and tried this to my families delight.  I did follow other reviewers suggestion to use 1/3 pc of bacon to wrap around the shrimp and put the oven on broil and then turned off after a few minutes.  Great to make ahead and use as an appetizer hot out of the oven.  Definitely a keeper

These are good and simple to make.  I did cook my bacon in the micro for a little bit then wrapped the shrimp.  I didn't give this 5 stars because, although they are good, I still used BBQ sauce to dip them in.

These were terrific!!! The only thing I did differently was substitute BBQ seasoning with original BBQ sauce.  I brushed both sides of the bacon and then wrapped the shrimp.  They turned out excellent.  I was sparing with the BBQ though because I didn't want to over power the other flavors but i think next time I'll use a little more.  These were very yummy though.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This bacon wrapped barbecue shrimp is tasty so good.Great combination and I did'nt even have any regular bacon.All I had was some turkey bacon so I decided to use that.And it was so awesome.Great flavors too.So if you love shrimp and bacon like I do great combination.And what a great and quick tasty appetizer as well.

I used the Montreal Low Sodium Steak Seasoning.  Followed the instructions for a 450 degree oven, but after 10 minutes I switched to broil for an additional 15 minutes using jumbo (16-20 per pound) shrimp.  Both my husband and I loved them and I will definately make again.  I would even serve this to company as either a dinner or an hors d'oeuvre.

Somewhere I got the recipe to do this same thing only adding a large fresh Basil leaf on the shrimp before wrapping the bacon.  It is sooooo tasty!!

We make a similar version by wrapping the shrimp with 1/3 slice Peppered Bacon, lining several up on skewers, and drizzling Kraft Zesty Italian salad dressing over them. We then cook them on the grill until the bacon is done. Yum! We eat these as appetizers when we grill or smoke other meats outdoors. This version is very good, too! Never thought about using BBQ seasoning.

I have made this for years but I throw them on the grill instead.  I use jumbo shrimp and slit them down the back and fill with jalapeno cheese.  Just make sure you pre cook the bacon first.

Elegantly simple with limitless possibilities, and very tasty. Works well under the broiler, too. Precook the bacon to avoid overcooking the shrimp.

Very tasty.  I forgot to let shrimp sit for the 15 minutes in barbecue - this was an important step so don't forget!  And also, precook the bacon so it's almost done if you like crispy bacon.

This was fantastic.  I did as another reviewer said and used BBQ sauce and let it sit all day before cooking.  I did pre cook my bacon in the oven at the 450 for about 5-10 just until the edges were starting to bubble up then let it cool and wrapped them.  I then used the remaining bbq sauce and put it in the shrimp.  I used a broiler pan and cook for the 10 min and they were perfect.  Well be making this again very soon.

I give it the 5 stars but I really read all the changes others had.  I really liked the cream cheese in a jalapeno with the shrimp and bacon.  AWESOME!  try that on for size!

The family loved it!!  I did pre-cook the bacon as others suggested - mainly because I was using leftover shrimp that was already cooked.  I didn't have any b-b-q sauce on hand so I used a free sample that I had of KC Masterpiece dry b-b-q rub.  It was great!!!  My 9 year old could NOT get enough!  Yum!!

I made these for our Christmas Eve party and they were fantastic!  I did pre-cook the bacon for a few minutes first.  I also brushed them with barbeque sauce instead of the seasoning.  They were a huge hit!

I tried this recipe and loved it! I don't eat pork, but it works just as well with turkey bacon. Also, this recipe allows you to do variations on the barbecue sauce from sweet to spicy. Wonderful recipe.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was great!  The barbeque seasoning gave it a wonderful taste.  Pre-cooking the bacon a little in the microwave helped keep the shrimp from becoming overcooked.  My husband is picky and hard to cook for and even he liked it so it's definately in my recipe box!!!

Very delicious and easy to make. I had never used BBQ seasoning before and it is quite good.(now i just have to figure out how to use the gallon of it that i have left)Lol. I cheated and used the precooked bacon. I was afraid the bacon may burn but it was perfect. A little burnt on the ends but it's good that way.

Wow, I wish I'd made more of these!!  They went so fast that I only got a couple and now I want more!! I cooked the bacon in the microwave for 2 minutes first.  Sprinkled with Old Bay Seasoning, then brushed with a little Sweet Baby Ray's.  Absolutly delicious!

Wonderful recipe! You do need to precook your bacon a little in the microwave so it gets done when your shrimp does.  I also skewer mine, cook on the grill and brush with a honey mustard, and serve more honey mustard on the side for dipping.  Devine! This is my very favorite way to eat shrimp.

Go one step further with this and add a dollop of cream cheese and a slice of Jalepano pepper before wrapping the bacon, then secure it all with toothpicks and broil or bake.  It is fabulous

This was good, but a bit bland. I guess I was hoping for more barbeque flavor because of the title. I used regular sized cocktail shrimp (cooked and flash-frozen), and turkey bacon. I pre-cooked the bacon as recommended, and thawed the cocktail shrimp, then wrapped two shrimps in one piece of bacon. It only needed to bake in the oven for 5 minutes. I would like to try this with a marinade or barbeque sauce and see if that helps the flavor. However, they still tasted good.

These are wonderful.  I think my husband would eat them every night if he could.  I wrapped my shrimp with a piece of slightly cooked bacon and skewered them and then grilled them while basting with bbq sauce.  They turned out great.  I think my husband loves me a tad more just because of these!!  :)

This was a good new twist on shrimp!  I used medium shrimp, with 1/3 strip of bacon.  I used mccormack steak seasoning and a drop on bbq sauce on top.  i had to cook them on 350, so they took longer, but they were just fine.  The crowd enjoyed them.  Definately worth the effort and a great side dish to steak or meal itself!

How can you not like shrimp no matter how they're cooked? I decided to grill them on the gas grill so I precooked the bacon for about 2.5 minutes in the microwave (1/2 strip of bacon, I used 16-20ct large shrimp) and wrapped them in bacon. I seasoned them with Old Bay seasoning (not usually a big fan of Old Bay but they turned out great) and then skewered about 5 per stick and seasoned them well with Old Bay. Then dabbed them with bbq sauce and grilled them for about 10-13 minutes on the gas grill. I dabbed them again after flipping the skewers and again when they came off. I served them over rice pilaf and it was very tasty. I think next time I'll pre-cook the bacon even more as we like our bacon crispy.

I fried the bacon first so then it'll be extra crispy when you finish the recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I used McCormick grill seasoning (pepper, garlic, salt, etc.) and then every 5 minutes I basted the shrimp with barbecue sauce for some extra flavor. These were such an enormous hit - thank you for sharing!

I liked the recipe, but my husband could live without it.  It was definately too much work for the lack of excitement it received.  I microwaved bacon for a couple of minutes first.  I am gald I did.

This is sooooo tasty.  I did precook the bacon for about 1 minute as other reviews recommended.  I used the barbecue                
spice, but after the schrimp were done I            
 brush them with a 
barbecue sauce. Great flavor!

This recipe was very easy and delicious.  I dipped the bacon wrapped shrimp in regular bar-b-q sauce instead of the shake on type and they were great.  I did leave them in the oven (after 10 mins. of cooking) under the broiler for just a couple minutes to get the bacon crispier.  I will make them again and again.

I had a get together last night and made several Allrecipe recipes.  I needed a protein appetizer and found this at the last second.  I only made it because it looked quick.  It happened to be the crowd favorite!  I used peeled and deveined medium large frozen shrimp that I thawed and wrapped with nitrite free bacon.  I secured the bacon with a toothpick that I pierced through the tail to the head to give the shrimp their curve.  I then generously sprinkled Allrecipe's Tennessee Rubdown on one side and let sit for about 10 minutes.  The rest of the recipe I followed closely. Very easy and very quick!

very good shrimp ...used shrimp that was a little frozen ....lightly used montreal seasoning and after it was wrapped, used Paula Dean's house seasoning on the bacon. Cooking it on the rack is the most important as nothing is sitting in the bacon grease.

I was expecting much more.  Although, I must admitt I brushed each baconed shrimp with BBQ sauce, not seasoning.  I guess that really made a difference.  Okay, still very good, but it didn't blow me away.  If I try them again I guess I'll have to find some BBQ seasoning so I can be blown away like everyone else.

These are time consuming, but worth the effort. The only change I made was to brush them with Open Pit Barbecue Sauce before baking. The spice alone didn't seem like enough flavor all by itself. I will certainly make these again and again! Thanks for a terrific recipe!

I served this with petite steaks and veggies.  They had the perfect zip to hold their own against the steak. Delicious!  In my daughters words, inbetween her MMMMMs, "There's nothing like meat wrapped meat with a side of meat."

Great tasting. I baked it when I made this and I found the bacon didn’t cook fully in the 15 mins. I would probably broil next time to get crisper bacon. Over all great for a low-carb diet.

Very good & easy to make :)  I used medium shrimp & pre-cooked the bacon so mine didn't come out rubbery as some of the other reviewers said.  This recipe was a nice change from what I usually cook for dinner.  Thanks!

very good with thick cut, hickory smoked bacon.  I skipped the BBQ seasoning on my second try and used a "south-seas" fish seasoning.  My BBQ rub is way to spicy for these shrimp.

Took a while - bit messy, but delicious -- served
over a bed of yellow rice - fresh salad - wonderful.  Not for "everyday" because it takes
too long to prepare == cooks quickly and is worth
the time.

It was fantastic, like others have said much better than a restaurant.  I used thick cut bacon so I put it on the tray and popped it in the oven for about 7 minutes, let it cool then wrapped the shrimp.  Next time I will put a paper towel down to catch the bbq rub (I used Killer Hogs bbq rub) then throw the paper towel away, the rub burned on the tin foil.

My family loves it! It is time consuming  though, so be prepared for at least 45 min. of prep time.  I didn't have bbq seasoning,  so I brushed some bbq sauce on them and they were delicious!

We weren't thrilled with the outcome of this recipe. I used a barbecue seasoning from this site and pre-cooked the bacon in the microwave. The bacon flavour was too strong and it overwhelmed the shrimp. I love shrimp, but I couldn't taste it. It provided a texture more than a flavour, which was disappointing. I liked the idea of the recipe, but I probably won't make it again.

I made these for New Year's Eve.  Everyone loved them.  I used pre-cooked bacon, so easy to wrap and cooking time works better with shrimp.  And no greasy mess to deal with.

I did not care for these at all, but my husband enjoyed them.  We tried 2 types of barbecue seasoning as well, one spicy and one regular, he liked both.  I don't plan on making them again due to the time to prepare vs taste.

I have made this dish several times.  It was delicious.  I found the key is to wrap the shrimp while it is still mostly frozen.  If you don't, either the shrimp will be too well done or the bacon will be mostly raw.  Using the jumbo shrimp that comes frozen in a bag worked for me.  I tried cooking the bacon first but that did not work.  I used barbecue seasoning and another time I used barbecue sauce.  I prefer the sauce, but don't skimp on the sauce.  Makes a great dinner.

Recipe was so simple and so awesome! I used reviewer recommendation to place a thinly sliced strip of jalapeño ion the back of the shrimp before I wrapped it in bacon.  I also used KC Masterpiece BBQ Seasoning (found in the spice aisle). Lastly. I followed recommendation to use 16 per pound count shrimp and used a full strip of center cut bacon. Will definitely make again!

I've made this twice now and will continue to make it anytime I have fresh shrimp!  The bacon is wonderful wrapped with the shrimp and makes each taste absolutely succulent.  Took the advice of another reviewer and sprinkled with Montreal Steak Seasoning.  No need to go any further--this is great!

I loved these. I will definitely be making this again. I used bbq sauce instead of seasoning and marinated the shrimp in it first. I also precooked the bacon just little because my shrimp weren't really large. I used turkey bacon instead of regular, just a personal preference. These turned out absolutely delicious.

I used turkey bacon and since I'm not a fan of BBQ sauce I brushed them with a maple syrup / dijon mustard glaze.  Wowza!

Amazing little fellows! Not a huge shrimp eater, but the bacon sure does make for a great little appetizer! I used the stubbs bbq rub, it was ok, but i recommend the McCormick Montreal Steak seasoning!

Delicious, but I would also have precooked the bacon first.

Did it a lil differently- instead of oven, I put it on the George Foreman grill and it turned out pretty good.  Only I recommend not using thick sliced bacon, because the cooking time is off and my shrimp did become rubbery.  Plus the bacon flavor is too overwhelming with the shrimp.  If I had used regular thin sliced bacon I'm sure it would have turned out great.
