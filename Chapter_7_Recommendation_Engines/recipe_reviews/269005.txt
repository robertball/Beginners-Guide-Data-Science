This recipe was very enjoyable- the second day.  I'm currently eating it for lunch and it's much better than it was for dinner last night.  Last night I was not impressed at all, but today the flavors seem to have developed.  If I were to make this again I'd forgo the brown rice- it took longer to cook than called for in the recipe  and I don't think that the texture works well in this one.  Also, I think the recipe assumed that I was using a narrower link of chorizo than is offered at my grocery store and I ended up with rather large pieces, I wish I had diced it instead of slicing as called for.
