This smoothie is great when the calendar says it's autumn but the outside temperature denies it.  You can have your cool Fall in a glass! I used apple pie spice instead of cinnamon. Thank you for the recipe.

Good and very easy to make.  I used frozen pineapple, 1% milk as that is what I had on hand, I could not get the whole apple in the blender nor did I use a full cup of milk.  I used one of those one person sized blenders . :)  
Still good and would make again!

DELICIOUS! I made this recipe as it is with one little change: used pumpkin spice, because I was out of cinnamon! Used organic Gala apple (7.5oz big) and it turned out sweet and yummy..... like an apple pie! Thank you for this recipe! :)

My mouth visited heaven, this was delicious & surprisingly curbs the hunger for a while between meals. I bet a whole grain breakfast muffin pairs perfect! Will try next time! Thanks for sharing. :)

I mostly just the apple and cinnamon flavors stood out.
