Great pancake recipe! I didn't change a thing! There's nothing better on a Sunday morning than the smell of a home cooked breakfast and freshly brewed coffee.  Be sure to use REAL buttermilk and don't over stir the batter.  You'll get some really nice and fluffy pankcakes - perfect with real maple syrup or sliced strawberries and whipped cream!

No complaints here. Also, no changes. I didn't let the batter rest in the fridge, I just left it on the counter for a bit. I'm sure that's for the lemon juice to react with the baking powder/soda and to make it fluffier, which is exactly what happened. Good pancake recipe. NOTE: You might want to stick with buttermilk instead of soured milk with this recipe. Sure, soured milk works okay but your pancakes will be flatter. Or, that was my experiance the second time I made them.

Very simple and delicious recipe.  I also just let my batter rest for a few minutes (20mins) before hand to speed up this resting process I let my buttermilk and egg reach room temp before using.  The addition of the lemon juice is pure genius!  The lemon juice (citric acid) causes an exothermic reaction with the Baking Soda (sodium bicarbonate)....results...Bubbles! This makes for lots of fluffy airy pancakes...This is why I love baking...it's like being in chemistry class but with edible results:-)

This is very good.  I will make pancakes with a resting time from now on.  I did add frozen blueberries just because I do like them so.  Thanks Drew!

Until this recipe I never found a pancake that I fell in love with.  Many were good but not OMG good.  But this one....is OMG good!  I used French Vanilla extract instead but that is the only change.  My mom who doesn't eat much only wanted one, but got up to eat three more.  I like to make them in bulk freeze them individually and take out what I need during the week.  I throw them in the toaster to heat them up, but my hubby is happy with them in the microwave.

Ye gods these were good!  I don't like huge puffy pancakes, so I deliberately thinned them out abit, but for us they were perfect!  I had to adjust for what I had on hand and ended up a) halfing recipe, b) I couldn't stand putting in all that oil so I only used about 1T of oil and used half and half for difference, c) used fresh lemon juice (2 good squeezes for a half), let sit for 20", then thinned out batter with about a dollop of milk.  Ended up with 7 nice size pancakes - perfect for husband & I.  Wonderful!

I'm not much of a pancake eater, but my husband wanted some for his birthday breakfast.  These were wonderful!  Even though I replaced 3/4 of a cup of the all purpose flour with whole wheat pastry flour and cut back the sugar by about a tablespoon, these still came out light and fluffy.  I also added some blueberries to each pancake before flipping them.  I was very impressed with this recipe.  Thanks so much!

Yummy!  My new fav.  I had to substitute with skim milk and lemon juice in place of buttermilk.  (Mine had a scary green fungus growing on it!)  Let the milk sit with lemon juice for five minutes to sour.  Cut back the canola oil a little and cut back the sugar by about a tablespoon.  Mixed it up in Kitchenaid.  My son is a pancake conosiuer...he loved these.  Served with pancake staples of bacon and syrup.  I'm so keeping this one.  Used cooking spray instead of butter and canola oil instead of vegetable.  Put in the fridge for 30 minutes.

These pancakes are GOOD! The lemon taste is subtle but makes all the difference. I didn't have time to let the batter sit but they were still fabulous. Try it with sour cream if you want something really incredible.

These are excellent. I have been looking for a good pancake for a long time and nothing was exeptional..these however are. It just goes to show you more reviews doesnt mean better.  These are a hidden secret. They are crisp on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside.   I didn't have buttermilk so I put 3 tbls vinegar in and let it sit for 5 minutes, also all I had was whole milk for our little one so I used that.  I didn't refrigerate the time specified, just until the griddle was ready.  I finally found the best pancake, others must try.

delicious!  Next time I may increase the lemon juice a little as I'm a tried and true lemon lover and couldn't get enough of that hint of lemon in these pancakes.

Yum! A great-tasting, fluffy pancake! A SIGNIFICANT note though: Don't leave the lumps--my fault for not SIFTING my flour, I guess, but we ended up with some clumps of flour. Gross! While we were eating, my boyfriend asked what was different about this recipe... as I listed the ingredients, I realized I forgot the sugar! Delicious without it! :)

This is the same recipe I use except I've never added the vanilla and lemon juice - I'm excited to try that next time and see if the family notices.  BTW - you don't have to refrigerate the batter, it is better but if you can't wait they still come out delicious.  My biggest challenge with chilling the batter is I can't keep my kids out of the fridge because they keep going in to eat the batter (it is quite tasty!).  Also, cook all the batter and just put any uneaten pancakes in a sandwich size ziplocks and heat the next day for 20-30 sec in your microwave (2 pancakes for ziplock).

It would be hard to find a better pancake recipe than this one! Since I rarely have buttermilk in the house, I just add 1 tablespoon of either lemon juice or distilled, white vinegar to each cup of milk to sour the milk and mimic buttermilk. Let it sit for five or ten minutes, then proceed with recipe. You can't really tell the difference once it's in the pancake! I also don't always let my pancake batter rest before baking, and I've not really noticed a big difference. These are so tasty, I often don't use either butter or syrup on them, I just enjoy them hot off the griddle, as is!

These pancakes are delicious! They are very light. I followed the recipe exactly, except I didnt put the batter in the fridge beforehand. It made about 14 medium sized pancakes-enough for about 4 adults. I will definitely make these from now on!

I have been on a quest to find a great homemade pancake recipe that doesn't need syrup to flavor it, and this is the one! All three of my boys and my niece loved these pacakes, which is a rarity in my kitchen. I omited the oil and went with applesauce instead and used egg whites.

I had some extra buttermilk after making fried chicken so I thouhgt I'd try this recipe.  What a waste of time!  The pancakes were gummy, tetured more like crepes than pancakes.  The whole batch had to be thrown out, not a good thing with 4 hungry kids waiting for breakfast.

I so wanted my family to love these, and unfortunately, I used a new griddle on my stove that apparently I had a hard time with the heat. The pancakes looked beautiful but were under cooked in the middle. Sooooo....for the ones that were cooked they liked the flavor, but for the rest, a gooey mess. I will try again since this is a great way to use up extra buttermilk and the batter looked and smelled amazing. So I will go in the middle on my rating because of my error. Thanks for the recipe!

AWESOME! I've never had that famous pancake house's pancakes, so I can't really compare these to those, but they were definately delicious and something I know I will be making over and over! Made these exactly as written and would not change a thing. Thanks for sharing. :)

WOW, these are good!  My daughter loved them, after turning her nose up at Cooks Illustrated's "Best Buttermilk Pancakes" (they are so right about so many things ... but not this).  These My-Hops are soooo good even without any butter or syrup (as I like to eat mine sometimes).  Fluffy and light ... easy and really delicious. The only thing I need to remember is to leave time to refrigerate the batter for 30-60 minutes =)  I love that you only need one egg and that all of the other ingredients are ones I almost always have on hand.  Thrilled to have finally found our go-to pancake recipe after trying many recipes and supposedly awesome (and expensive) mixes, including the one used at Disney Resorts.  

This recipe is simply wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!

Fluffy and perfect!  This is the perfect pancake recipe.  I have tried many over the years but they always came out flawed in some way -- too flat, too bready, too thick, too something.  I followed the recipe exactly and these came out with the perfect brown lacy edges, fluffy insides, and slightly sweet flavor that I love.  The one tip I will add is that these cakes do have to be watched carefully for burning a bit more than other recipes I have used.  They seem to cross over into burned territory in a flash.  But that's a small price to pay for perfect pancakes, I say.

Pretty good pancakes.  I prefer a fluffier pancake like my mom used to make.  I'm not big on buttermilk pancakes.  My husband said they are very close to the famous pancake chain.

They were good. We didn't really let it sit a whole half-hour, either, because we were short on time. I'd make those again. as far as being like (I) Hop, there is another recipe that's texture is closer, and I don't think my kids were quite as fond of this as they were the other one because of the texture, but I think it's the vanilla and sugar that make it taste more like theirs. The other ones taste a little more "rubbery" to me, so it's a matter of preference.

Husband never said a word... just Hummed the whole time he was eating!!  This is a definite keeper, :o)   Wondering if you can keep the batter overnight, was a bit much for just two.   If not, will just have to adjust recipe down a bit.

Excellent! Instead of Buttermilk I added 1T. lemon juice to skim milk and let it set 5 minutes to sour. My wife is not big on pancakes but she loved these.

Perfect pancakes, every time! If you don't have buttermilk, don't worry. You just add 4 1/2 teaspoons white vinegar to the milk, and let it sit for about 10 min and you've got instant, fresh buttermilk. I've made it twice like this so far, and it's by far the best tasting homemade pancake recipe I have ever had .. simply delicious! Awesome recipe!

I have already tried this recipe last week.  It is very good.  It recalled my memory at I-HOP when I studied in the states.  Since it is very diffucult to get buttermilk in my country.  I have yogurt in hand so I replace the buttermilk with Yogurt + full fat milk.  1 Pack of yogurt and top up the milk until it reach 1 1/4 cups.  It turns out very good.  I let the batter stand for one hour.  (I prepare the batter then go back to bed and cook it when I wake up..)  Thanks for the good recipe.

This recipe was okay, maybe I just need to try it again. The famous pancake chain also adds their omelet mixture to the batter to make them fluffy. I have tried that, and I like it that way better. Try it!!

This recipe was awesome! I made them for my daughter's friends after a sleepover and they all loved them.  They were so fluffy and sweet.  I used 2% milk but increased the lemon juice because I didn't have buttermilk and they still turned out really good.

These were really delicious and easy to make. I didn't have buttermilk so used the old vinegar and milk trick. They were a bit thin but the flavor was great.

My family of 5 absolutely loved these pancakes. My 3 sons informed me that we no longer have to go to Ihop for pancakes because we can make them at home now.  The batter was not runny at all and the pancakes turned out nice and fluffy.  They did not stick to the pan while cooking either.  I let the batter sit in the refrigerator for the 30 mins and then I got the pan nice and hot, sprayed a little non-stick cooking spray on it (always had better luck with using the spray for pancakes and crepes-I use just a little) and started cooking them on the lowest stove top burner setting.  (I just turn it up at first to get the pan hot).  My kids are in middle school but I've always given them recipes to keep - they each have a binder that says MOM'S RECIPES, that way if anything were to happen they would always have our family's favorite recipes on hand.  This one is definitely going in their binders!

Good pancakes but I will need to triple this recipe to adequately feed my family!  Used plain milk as I live in China and do not have access to buttermilk and they were just fine.

I have made this recipe a few times now and about to make it again tomorrow for the breakfast for the familly. It has turned out everytime but it takes a little time to master the heat just right for the pefect pancake. You don't get a better pancake @ home.

I followed the recipe exactly. The texture of these pancakes was wonderful and the flavor was almost perfect. The only change I would make is to increase the salt or decrease the sugar, as they were just a little too sweet.

Great recipe! I didn't change a thing in the ingredients.  My batter sat for 2 hours only because our power went off and I couldn't cook the pancakes.  They were just fine.  My husband liked these too.  I'm eating a cold leftover right now with my coffee. Thank you for such a good recipe!

The taste was fantastic but they stuck terribly to my nonstick griddle.  I tried thinning with more buttermilk and that helped a little.  They tasted great, but I would not make them again.

Great method.  I discovered too late that I was nearly out of all purpose flour so I used what I had - 1/4 c. all- purpose flour, 1/2 c. bread flour, and 1/2 c.  whole wheat flour.  I did everything else was exactly the same as in the recipe.   My family and I loved them.  Seeing that our whole wheat pancakes  out this light and fluffy, I figure it's got the be the method, not so much the type of flour used so I'm saving this recipe to try again exactly as written when I have all-purpose flour in my pantry but will definitely make them again substituting 1/2 the flour with whole wheat.

Good for sure.  I would scale back on the sugar just a little bit for our taste.  The batter was extremely thick but I just went with it and was fine.  It made 4 large pancakes and they were definitely fluffy.

Excellent recipe! Almost taste exactly like IHOP’s pancakes. Do not skip putting it in the fridge this is a vital step and totally changes the recipe if you don’t do it. I just tried without and it taste completely different.

I'm not going to lie to you, but this recipe is the best on the internet right now. I challenge you to find a recipe that works better than this. No I am serious. I don't know if I can unequivocally say that these taste JUST like Original House of Pancakes/IHOP pancakes but they are dern close texture-wise and a little bit taste-wise as well. literally the ONLY things I did differently was doubling the recipe and then using 1% buttermilk (my stomach can't take the whole), and then I just use half the amount of vegetable oil and used melted butter for the other half. Everything else was to the T. My wife loved it. My kids loved it. And I loved it . My sister even loves it the day she came over. Thank yall!!! This is my go-to recipe

Our favorite pancakes. Only change I've ever made when making these (and I've made them a ton of times) is a sprinkle of cinnamon (probably about a 1/2 tsp). And once my husband convinced me to sprinkle crumbled bacon into them. The fluffiest, tastiest pancakes I've ever made.

These are my first yummy and beautiful pancakes ever! Before my pancakes were so thick that they got burned but uncooked inside. This recipe yields perfect pancakes for me. Thank you so much :) (Note: I didn't have buttermilk, so I mixed the regular milk with juice of 1 lemon, and let it stand for 15 minutes)

This recipe is so extremely good.  The pancakes are not dry and remind me of restraunt style pancakes.  My whole family loves these pancakes.  I am glad that I finally have a pancake recipe that is worth the effort and is a crowd pleaser!

Best pancake recipe I have ever tried. I triple the recipe, place a small piece of parchment paper between each one place groups of 6 in a ziplock bag after they have cooled and put in the freezer for quick yummy breakfasts. I just put them in the toaster oven to warm up but I suppose the microwave would work too.

I found these pancakes to be bland. The first time I made them I made the recipe as written. The second time, I added some malt (which is what I always add to my pancakes). Still bland. I ended up sprinkling them wih cinnamon sugar just to add flavor. Not a terrible recipe, just "ok".

These are a True Winner! I have tried a few pancake recipes on this site but each one was always missing 'something'. This recipe makes the most flavorful and fluffy pancakes outside of a I-HOP! These pancakes have become an often request breakfast staple. Now I have to start stockpiling flour ;-)

These are the best pancakes that I have ever made. We have been using this recipe for about 5 months now, ever since I found it on here. I think that the folks who had a bad experience may have had issues with their ingredients. There is nothing crepe-like with these, they are not gummy. If you follow the recipe, they are insanely delicious!

This is the best pancake recipe I have made to date and the only one I will use now!  And I've been searching for a very long time!  It DOES taste like I-Hop's pancakes.  After making it a few times, I think the secret has to be the lemon juice (I have never used that in pancakes) and resting the batter.  Excellent, thank you!!!

I love these pancakes.  The first time I made them I forgot to put the sugar in and they tasked fine.  My wife and daughter who do not eat pancakes loved them.  
Question.  Can I make the batter and let it sit in the refrigerator for a day or two before I make the pancakes?  Thank you so much

I followed the recipe to the letter, but did not have the results that so many of you have had.  The batter was too runny.  I had to add another 3/4 cup flour.  They had too much of a baking soda flavor.  Thumbs down.  Didn't taste anything like IHOP pancakes.

When I first made this recipe it didnt go over very well with my family or me, so i experimented with it changing key ingredients. After about 3 or 4 tries i FINALLY found the right mix. Changes include:  buttermilk to 1 and 1/2 cups, i used olive oil instead of veggie oil (mainly because i didn't have veggie) and cut it 1/2 teaspoon,i added 1/2 cup UNMELTED margerine, flour to 1 and 1/3 cups, baking soda to 1 and 1/4.  Well thats all the changes i made for a better recipe in my opinion.

Made this today, it was fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I substituted sour cream and a tsp of lemon juice with milk for the butter milk, it was a success.  Thank you for posting this, I love pancakes and this was the best I've tried!

Wonderful recipe for pancakes,light & fluffy and totally yummy. I did add a small amount of flour after I took the batter out of the refrigerator as the batter was a wee bit thin, no big thing. I doubled the recipe and fed 3 hungry LDS Missionaries tonight and they devoured them.  Absolutely a keeper recipe!

This is the BEST Buttermilk pancake recipe I've ever tasted!  It is unbelievably easy to make too!  I have been known to double the recipe just so I can freeze half of them and have a easy pancake breakfast during the week.

This is my family's favorite pancake recipe! And I have tried many different recipes in past. The only two changes I made was use 1/4 cup of butter in place of the vegetable oil in the batter. And I only let batter rest for about 5 minutes or so. They turned out perfect, just fluffy enough. Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! so tender and sweet, these were fantastic. Didn't even need the syrup. Some were complaining that they were a raw gooey mess but I think they must have poured them too thick. The batter doesn't spread much when you pour it so I kind of had to push the batter around too keep them from being too thick but they turned out perfect. I cooked them in my electric fry pan set at 375. I think you could also add a couple of TBLS milk with the buttermilk and thin them out that way too.

Out of this world pancakes!  I made according to directions and they were eaten up.  We served with Smuckers red raspberry syrup and a dallop of cream.  Made my kids morning.    One batch of these fed perfectly our family of 6-with no leftovers.

Loved it.  Did use lemon juice instead of buttermilk, as I didn't have any on hand.  Came out great, reminds of Perkin's pancakes, but as their pancake contains hydrogenated oil and this doesn't, this was a much better alternative.

Made pancakes exactly as written and they turned out very tasty.  Will probably be the recipe I use from now on.  My only problem was cooking them in a teflon electric skillet.  It had a raised center and the batter ran down off the center so they were not formed as pretty as they should have been but they tasted great.  Next time I'll do them in a heavy skillet on the stove.  Using a 1/3 measuring cup I got 7 medium size cakes and a small one.  Enough for a quick dinner for hubby and me.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE! I have tried it several times the only thing I have changed is the amount of vanilla (added a little more) and added nuts and berries. Folks this is as easy as a homemade pancake recipe gets. I find the more lumpy the batter is the fluffier they turn out. So don't mix too much. Also, even though are fluffy they are sooo filling so the recipe only yielding 8 or 9 is plenty.

Have made a recipe identical to this with the exception of the lemon juice for years now.  Easy to make and always a hit for breakfast when we have family at our house. Sometimes substitute almond extract for vanilla to give a nuttier aroma.  Have also added min-choc chips or blueberries.

This was so much better than any pancake you can get in a restaurant!  Crisp on the outside with great cakey texture instead.  I did clean it up a bit by using rapadura instead of white sugar and substituted white whole wheat flour for the all-purpose.  You do have to cook on a lower heat to make sure the middle gets done.  I cooked on med-low.  This is a keeper!

Great pancakes.  Husband loved them and asked what is it that is different.  I believe it is both the vanilla and the lemon juice.
I followed the recipe exactly.  I did burn the first one.  Found that a bit less heat and longer cooking time works best.  A bit different than cooking regular pancakes.

Now this is what pancakes should taste like!  Followed the recipe exactly with the first few cakes then thinned the batter just a bit with some additional buttermilk just for personal preference of a thinner cake.  My new go to recipe for pancakes!

I have made these today, New Year's Day 2013, and followed the recipe to a T. I was pleased at all that the cakes were stuck to the pan (of course I added the butter, and when they still stuck I added oil). I believe the sugar makes them stick like glue. I make homemade (french crepes) so I know what I am doing. I tried adding a little oil after turning the cakes over but then the uncooked batter drips and the rest of the cake is too greasy when removed to the plate. Otherwise they don't taste bad. If somebody would make them with a just a smidgeon of sugar and rate it we would all appreciate that.

Doubled the recipe and it made a ton.  My kids will be eating pancakes for the next few days, which will make them happy because they loved these.  I did not let it sit before using and used 1/4 cup applesauce instead of 1/2 cup oil (doubled).  I did not try these, but my husband and kids said they were really good.

These are hands down the very best pancakes I’ve ever had and not to mention the easiest I’ve ever made! I love IHOP but these are better than their’s! I also made a buttermilk sauce I found here to go with them and I will say it was a perfect pairing with these beautiful pancakes!

Family loved the pancakes! They are sweet, and did not need syrup. I made a double batch so there were leftovers to snack on throughout the day.

Thank you to the reviewer who suggested dropping blueberries onto the batter on the skillet. I always mixed them in before, and it's very difficult to get them evenly distributed, and they cooked strangely. 

The recipe was quite good, and although I pulled the buttermilk and egg out of the fridge for a few minutes, there was no waiting time for me today because my partner and I were already hungry. Ok, I let the batter sit a few minutes, and bubbles started to develop immediately. They still turned out much better than using another recipe and powdered buttermilk. Fresh buttermilk does seem to taste better and leaves a thicker consistency than water and powder.

Really the trickiest part of pancakes (besides resisting the urge to smooth out all those lumps in the batter) seems to be getting the right temperature on the pan to cook without blackening. I don't have a griddle so I'm using a stainless steel pan on a flat top glass electric range. 

Happy cooking, everyone!

Sooo good.  I've tried four or five other pancake recipes because we eat them regularly and this is the best.  Actually, I'm going to delete the other pancake recipes I have saved.  I didn't have buttermilk so I added two tablespoons of lemon juice instead of one.

I have been searching for a flavorful, tender and fluffy pancake recipe and all have fallen short....until this one! I followed the recipe to an almost "t" as I failed to read the directions and didn't put the lemon juice into the egg and never chilled it for 30 minutes. They still came out fantastic! Loved the very subtle hint of lemon. Thank you for such a fantastic her easy recipe!

When you are craving diner style pancakes these are it!  The recipe makes a ton and I'm not talking silver dollar size...I'm talking hubcap size!  Great flavor.  Do it on an electric griddle for a more authentic flavor and look also.

Very tasty and light.  I didn't have any buttermilk so added a teaspoon of lemon juice to a cup of milk and it worked well.  Didn't have time to leave in the refrigerator for 30-60 minutes and they were still delicious.  Nice to know you can make these modifications and still work.

The pancakes are on the sweet side but very yummy and the lemon juice puts them over the top. 

Didn't have buttermilk on hand so I used 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon and filled it in a measuring cup. I then added enough milk to have a total of 1 1/4 cups of "buttermilk". 

I chilled the batter for 1 hour and baked 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake. I ended up with 11 pancakes.

Very easy and delicious.  I prepared the batter the night before so I wouldn't need to let it rest in the morning.  It became rather thick, but I just thinned it a bit with more milk.  Oh, and I added cinnamon - because I love it!  Froze the leftovers and toasted them the next day, yum.  Recipe works very well for us two.

Fabulous!!!  As a general rule I don’t have the best luck with pancakes but today is my son’s birthday and he requested them for breakfast.  I hadn’t planned ahead so I used the milk and lemon juice trick for the buttermilk.  I whisked together the dry ingredients and wet ingredients (and sugar) and then mixed wet into dry until just combined.  Since I was in a rush I didn’t notice until it was too late, it being a school day, that this recipe requires chilling so I just forged ahead and cooked them immediately.  PERFECTION.  I couldn’t be more pleased with these pancakes, and I’m so happy that I finally have a recipe that works for me!

This is the BEST pancake recipe I have ever used.  I think they may be better than the restaurant they copied.....  I only wanted to eat one and ended up eating three...  if you follow it exactly.. use real buttermilk and real lemon you will get a great result.   Wonder if you could add a little veg oil and used it for waffles?

Quick and easy with plenty of flavor.  Didn't have buttermilk, so I doubled the amount of lemon juice. Didn't let it rest more than 5 minutes while the grill heated, and they were perfect. I scaled the recipe down to three servings and it made six medium sized pancakes, a perfect breakfast for two hungry people.

I expected these pancakes to be thicker and fluffier, but they were tasty. I would recommend you don't overmix and use a little less buttermilk. Made bout 20 plus

I made this recipe two times and shared it with my sister as well.  I had to make my own buttermilk because it is not something that I normally have in my refrigerator and the second time I had to use lime juice instead of lemon juice and it still tasted awesome.  I made homemade strawberry syrup that went well with these pancakes.

I need to try this recipe again to see if I like it any better the next time. I thought that the texture of the pancakes was perfect, but they were kind of bland. I might add more vanilla next time, and I might put more than a dash of salt in them. They were easy to make, but I just felt like they were too bland.

they taste good but mine came out flat because I used "sour" almond milk (almond milk + apple cider vinegar) which I guess didn't make my batter rise .

Awesome! These were excellent pancakes. I didn't have any buttermilk in the refrigerator, so I substituted milk + distilled vinegar which worked fine. I also added a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon, and added a touch of almond extract. They. Were. Amazing.

Add an extra 1/4 c of flour so 1 1/2c to get really fluffy pancakes. This has been a winner with all so far!

Light, fluffy, and delicious! I had to get my fill while cooking them because they disappeared off the plate every time I turned around-my boyfriend kept devouring them when my back was turned! A big hit!

I found this recipe one day that one of my sons was wanting to go to the famous pancake house (i don't really like that place) so i told him that i will make him the same pancakes at home and we could have a movie and pancake time. 
I have to say that this is a great recipe, the flavour is great and my sons were really pleased with it, they are fluffy and not flat at all! if the batter is runny you are doing something wrong, it has to be a little bit thick, medium low heat works for me, you have to make sure that the pancake is fully cooked in the middle.
Since that day, this is the only recipe that i use to make pancakes. Thank you for sharing!!!

My family loves these!  I will say to make sure to use the buttermilk.  The soured milk  substitute worked...  OK....  but it's MUCH better with the buttermilk.

This has become our favorite pancake recipe. We make it according to directions. For Father's Day, we added flour coated blueberries and a extra 1/2 tsp baking soda to the mix. DH called them really good.

I use this recipe often, except I use bacon grease in place of the vegetable oil to give it a better and more "breakfasty" flavor. This pancake also makes pretty fluffy pancakes, so I usually add a little extra milk to thin them out a little.

My husband thought this was one of the best pancake recipes we’ve tried.  I thought some others were better, not that I didn’t think they were good.    What can I say?  If we were all alike, it would be a boring world.

My family has trouble with wheat, so I used spelt flour. I did't think it was possible to have fluffy pancakes without white flour, but these are light and fluffy! The kids said they were the best ever!

I've been making these pancakes for around 2 years now and every time I do, they disappear! I add packets of vanilla flavored sugar, extra vanilla, and if I have it, butter flavored bakery emulsion. I don't like the taste of pancake batter at all but this batter was amazing! It was difficult for me to Let is sit for  a half hour! This is without a doubt the BEST pancake recipe I've ever used! I always make at least a 2-3x of the recipe so we have some some leftovers but even making that much there are rarely any left over. Absolutely delicious.

Best pancakes ever!  I have retired my old recipe in favor of this one.  It is perfect as written; however, I used butter instead of oil because I work in a butter processing plant and would never use oil for cooking!  Thank you for the recipe!

I just tried it tonight.  Aroma gets a 5.  Taste gets a 4.  "Cookability" gets a 3 or maybe a 2.  I had a heck of a time turning the pancakes over.  I didn't think my spatula technique was that bad until tonight.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added blueberries.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I'm going to thin them out a little and only cook three or maybe only two at a time to give me more room on the griddle.  The taste, by the way, was pretty good but not up to the raves from other reviews.

Very good.
I keep powered milk and instant buttermilk at all times.  It keeps for a very long time so I have it for any recipe.
Thanks

Now if you really want a special treat.  Pick your favorite canned pie filling and use that as the topping on these.  Add whipped cream and just enjoy~!

I enjoyed the flavor and the height of these pancakes, and will make them again, adding blueberries and other seasonal fruit. This is a good beginner's recipe, but I only gave the recipe 4 stars, since I have some other recipes that produced a better tasting and more compact pancake. Those recipes are more involved, and this recipe is easy and foolproof to make. I served the pancakes with a good quality maple syrup and melted butter. Gosh, they were good!

Perfect pancakes! Boxed mixes are convenient, but from scratch tastes so much better. Only change was to double it to make sure there was enough for all my pancake hounds! Thanks for sharing.

This receipe is very good and easy to fix a good substitute when camping or traveling is to use powdered milk instead to make the receipe use just a little over a 1/3 of a cup and water to compenstate the receipe and much easier less messy.

This is a great recipe. Followed it exactly. Except let the batter sit for just about 30 mins. Used milk and increased the lemon as suggested. Lovely light, fluffy pancakes !

Absolutely delicious!  All of the recipes I've tried heretofore have generated a pancake that was too dry, too dense, or too eggy.  This recipe delivers the perfect pancake.  It will make you institute a family pancake day-of-the-week. I froze a few from the batch and they heated well in the microwave the next day.

These were disappointingly OK. But that may be because I used powdered buttermilk. I will try them again with rgular buttermilk, following everything else to the letter.  Thank you.

Followed directions to a "T" and the pancakes came out flat, a bit fluffier than crepes but not nearly risen as much as pancakes.  Taste was superb.  I'll try this again next week, will think carefully about each step, be sure I have it right.

Great recipe, followed it exactly and they turned out great! Was full after eating two. I think they are the closest you can get to IHOP without actually going and I love IHOP. If this recipe doesn't work for you, it is an operator defect.

I made this as stated the first time, but the second time I used white wheat flour, and also buttermilk solids to the dry ingredients, then water as stated on package. Still awesome flavor and texture, not too heavy with the white wheat flour. Every grandchild today said "Grammy these are the best!"

We like these very much, but they were too lumpy.  I should have stirred them up a bit more.  I'll try them again.  They were really limp compared to pancakes made with a box mix.

These cooked up light and fluffy, but feel like there's too much oil.  Little bit of a greasy taste.

My family and I love this recipe as written. Though I do mix in chocolate chips or blueberries as requested. I have been thinking about trying frozen strawberry pieces with strawberry syrup sometime in the future as well. We make this at least once a week. I love how cheap this is to make too.

Best pancakes I ever made! Followed recipe as is and they turned out great! (Ok, I admit I added a dash of cinnamon as my personnal touch but I kept everything else the same.)

We have tried a new pancake recipe almost every weekend for over a year, and these are hands down the best ones yet. I think our search for the perfect pancake recipe is finally over! I forgot to add sugar until the end, so I had to stir the batter a little extra, then only let them sit for about 25min, and they were still fluffy and melt-in-your mouth amazing. No syrup needed. Enjoy!

Followed the recipie as written and they were wonderful. I added some cooking spray to my griddle and had no problem with them "sticking." Made 11 nicely sized pancakes. Next time I will double the recipie.

I followed the recipe exactly, and the pancakes were simply fabulous. They were so fluffy and "melt in your mouth" good. I am sure I ate more than I should have!

Delicious, and fluffy although I let the batter rest only 15 min.  Definitely a keeper.
