We loved these! I used sopressata (an italian salami) instead of smoked beef & I nuked it for a minute to render some of the fat out. I seasoned my chicken w/ Paula Deen's house seasoning (garlic powder, salt & pepper) after pounding & I added a tsp of hubby's hot sauce (roasted peppers, onions & garlic) to the apricot mixture, reserving some of the apricot sauce to dip with. Due to the pasty color of the chicken, I broiled it for a  couple of minutes after it was done, to add some visual appeal. I put a smear of apricot sauce on the plate (take a big spoonful, dump it at one end of the plate & then slide the spoon across the plate...creating a "smear") & sliced the roll-ups in half to reveal the beautiful pinwheel center.   Garnished w/a  sprig of fresh thyme. It looked great & tasted even better...thanks for the recipe!

OMG! This was wonderful!  I use the sauce mixture for other things as well. Chicken quarters, pork chops, boston butt roast, etc. My husband watched me make the sauce, and he was like, what in the world are you mixing? I told him not to knock it until he tried it. He raved about it and told me I had to make it again!  So if you are unsure, try it! You won't be sorry!  I used the sauce as gravy for our rice. Kids went nuts over it!!

I made this recipe for Easter Lunch, and my whole family absolutely LOVED it. I used a lot more of the marinade and had a gravy. I also added a bit of garlic to the marinade. It was a winner!!!Will definitely make it again.

These were really good.  I would make them again.  Used dried beef and havarti cheese.  Couldn't find smoked beef or even corned beef.  Not really fancy enough for company unless the chicken is trimmed well, but a great variety meal for the family.

This gets major points as it saved me at dinner time - I had all the ingredients and the kids gobbled it up. I used smoked turkey instead of beef, 4 slices per chicken breast. Next time, and there WILL be a next time, I may use less ketchup than called for, maybe substitute BBQ sauce...simply a preference. I don't like apricot jam or ketchup and I liked this meal! :)

Great recipe! Two changes that I think it made a huge change to the flavor. I added barbacue sauce instead of ketchup. I also added smoked gouda cheese to the roll up. It was a huge hit at my dinner club. One other thing I made this as an appetizer and I think the size was a little to large for an appetizer. If you do use this as an appetizer make sure you cute the chicken cutlet into fourths.

I wasn't too sure about this since there weren't any reviews and ratings. However, I was so tired of the same ol' same ol' I decided to give it a try. I was so surprised how GOOD this turned out. The mixture (ketchup, jam, mayo) worked very well together, leaving it a sweet taste. I did season the chicken with S&P and garlic powder before rolling it up with beef. I think next time, I'm going to roll it up with a slice of Provolone cheese. MMM that sounds good. The entire family thought it was a hit. I scored tonight!

YUM! I don't like apricots or mayonnaise, but I loved this! I improvised with what I had available and used prosciutto instead of beef. I also rolled up some goat cheese inside for a creamy texture. I used bigger pieces of chicken so 2 rolls were enough for a meal. My husband asked for it again the next night!

This was...interesting. Not bad, everyone ate it, but it was a little weird. I don't think I'll make it again. I'd also recommend BBQ sauce instead of ketchup.
