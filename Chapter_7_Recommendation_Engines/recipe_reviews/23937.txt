Delicious!  However, the second time I made them,
I prepared the mixture the night before so the flavors could develop, and it was twice as good.
This will be one of my favorites in the future.
Thank you, Doreen.

This recipes is wonderful, served it as an appetizer for New Years Eve.  I thought it was a little bland.  I added 2-3 tablespoons of balsalmic vinegar to the tomato basil mixture.  Then after the bread was toasted and the tomato mixture was on the bread, I sprinkled shredded provolone cheese on top and put it back in the oven until the cheese was slightly melted.  This disapeared as soon as we got it out of the oven.

This made a beautiful presentation! Basil and tomatoes fresh from my father's garden, along with the toasted bread. There was a little left over, and the next day it smelled and tasted even more wonderful than it did the night before! The basil was a little wilted the next day, though, so next time I'll mix everything together but the basil the night before, and then cut and add the basil just before serving.

I took the advise of a previous reviewer and made this the night before let the flavors blend.  I did not add the basil until about an hour before I wasa going to serve this.  I also let the chopped tomato sit in a strainer for quite a while to drain well.  Our guests raved about this bruschetta!  Thanks  Doreen

This was delicious, but we all adore bruschetta anyway! I didn't use the specified amount of oil for the tomato mixture, I just drizzled and tossed until combined...maybe only 1-2 tablespoons...and it was plenty. I did away with the step of warming the oil and garlic. I have always made my bruschetta by just brushing the slices with olive oil and then rubbing a crushed garlic clove across the top. I put the toasts on a platter and let everyone spoon the tomato topping on top so the bread wouldn't get soggy. Someone at the table (not me!)  had about 8 slices!

Great recipe!  I have picky tomato eaters so I used only 4 romas.  The garlic, shallot and basil was more pronounced this way.   I cut down on some of fat by doing bread differently.  I cut a  garlic clove in half and rubbed it on the both sided of bread then toasted on my G. Foreman grill.  I added shredded parmesan to top for a garnish. It was a big hit with my family! Will definately make again!

I made this to take to a dinner and it was a bit hit.  Everyone kept complimenting me on it.  I actually made it the night before and so it could rest for a while.  This will be my go-to bruschetta recipe.  Thanks!

Delicious!! I chose this because I thought I had everything. I did not have any shallots, so I subbed onion in it's place. I added a little extra lemon juice and a pinch of sugar.  I halved this recipe but just now as I am reviewing this I realized I kept the garlic oil ( for brushing on the bread) the same. This was such an exceptional and easy recipe. I didn't find this lacking in anything, just be sure to add enough salt, pepper and lemon juice to your own taste.

This is an excellent recipe!! I only made one change and replaced the fresh garlic for 2 tsp. of garlic powder in the tomato mixture for those not too keen on heavy garlic. I too, made the tomato mixture the night before. I didnt have that "basil-blackening" problem probably because of the lemon juice in your recipe. I did not toast the bread slices before hand. I laid bread on baking sheets, topped with the tomato topping, sprinkled with a dash of parmesian cheese and heated in the oven for 6 minutes at 375ÂºF. I doubled the recipe as I was serving for 15 people. Should have quadrupled it!!  absolutely delicious and EASY EASY EASY!  yummmi   ty Doreen :)

This is one of my favorite recipes from this site!  I usually will put it on top of garlic bread and top the tomato mixture with a little bit of parmesean cheese.  Then I put it under the broiler for a minute just to melt the cheese.  This is AMAZING!

Wonderful recipe!  I love fresh tomatoes and garlic and this offers both.  Great with Fresh Mozzerella melted on french bread then topped with bruschetta.

I have made this recipe many times since I first tried it in 2005 and it is fabulous each time. Our family likes ours garlicky so we do add a little more garlic but other than that we changed nothing. Thanks Doreen for the great recipe that everyone asks for and I won't share!

Wonderful! I did add 1/2cup of freshly grated parmesan and I thought it really improved the flavour! I also agree that they are more flavourful if you do the mix at least a couple of hours ahead. I also brushed the bread slice with the oil before toasting them It still makes them crunchy but less dry.

Unless you're cooking for 350 people, you really MUST make the garlic-infused olive oil!  It adds something really special to this already tasty dish.  (I sampled some without the olive oil and it just wasn't the same.)  I also let mine sit overnight in the fridge and did not have a problem with the basil turning colors.  As suggested by another reviewer, that's probably due to the lemon juice.  I only rated this a four because I was expecting something a touch more outstanding.  Don't get me wrong, it's REALLY "good" -- I was just expecting "great."  I'll add more next shallots next time and see if it helps.

Very well received by everyone who tasted them. However, 12 romas made enough for likely three baguettes, so there is an entire container leftover of the filling.

I have made something similar many times. Like a previous poster letting it sit at least over night will enhance the flavors.  I like to cut baggetts into thin slices, brush with olive oil, broil them, and rub raw garlic on them after coming out of the oven.  Then you can use them as "chips" to dip into the glorious concoction.  

p.s.-i add black olives to mine either minced or sliced is fine

Very nice. I sweated my shallots in a little olive oil because I don't care for the texture of them raw, but made the rest as directed (though I did reduce the recipe to 1/3). Thanks!

This recipe is outstanding.  I have used it in catering for weddings.  People rave and want the recipe all the time.  If made the day before, you may need to drain the bruschetta mixture a little before serving.  Also when serving 350 people it's okay to find some garlicky cracker type thing.  I've found a sturdy garlic bagel chip works great.  Then all you have to do is make the bruschetta mixture.  It has enough flavor to serve with untoasted baguette also.

Divine and so easy to prepare.  I prefer to saute my garlic and shallots to mellow the harshness you can get from garlic.  I prepared the topping the night before to let the flavors meld.  Added the basil right topping because it can turn black and bitter.  Garnished the slices with Parmesan cheese and slipped under the broiler for a few minutes.

My culinairy impaired friend made this to bring to our End-of-season BBQ and everyone loved it! 
We saved the left overs and had it the day after with some bread and capers in it to make a panzanella type salad. Yum!

I love shallots, so this was the perfect recipe for me to use!  I had some leftover sun dried tomatoes, so I added then in as well.

I made this recipe for the first time last year, and ever since then it has been requested at every house party or holiday celebration.  I add chopped sundried tomatoes as well for a little extra sweetness.  The shallots are a nice change from a lot of garlic and onions.  Always a hit!!!

I used a food chopper to chop the tomatoes, shallots and fresh basil. I think it made the chopping process go a little quicker!

This recipe is so tasty, you almost don't even need the bread!

Very good! I made a small technical change, in that I sauteed off the shallots until golden, then added the minced garlic for a minute. This eliminated the harsh taste of both when raw, and let them play a more mellow, though still important, role in the final product. The fresh basil makes this recipe. I also add 2 drops of pure vanilla extract, which serves to make the flavors even cleaner and brighter in their orchestration. In place of salt, I use vegetable base, which adds yet another boost of flavor. Don't get me wrong - the recipe is good as is, but can use just a whisker of improvement to bring it stellar heights.

I was the belle of the cocktail hour with this dish! The Romas were looking a little anemic that day, so I used 2 containers of grape tomatoes, 2 small shallots, and about half a head of garlic. Chopped and combined everything but the basil in the morning, tossed the basil in about 6 hours later, and it was awesome!

I thought this was fresh-tasting, but really really boring.  I added quite a bit more basil and some balsamic vinegar.  Probably will look for a new recipe.

I made this bruschetta as an appetizer for my husband's birthday dinner.  It was a HUGE hit with our guests, very delicious.  I didn't have any shallots on hand so I used the white part of green onions.  I also sprinkled a bit of freshly grated parmesan cheese on top - SO YUMMY!

I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used (1) 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with jalapeno and (1) 10 oz can of diced tomato with green chili. I also didn't have fresh basil so I used about 1/6 cup of dried basil and then added about 1/2 cup of fresh chopped green onion to give it texture and color. I had a fresh shallot and fresh garlic and I think this would not have worked had I not had the fresh shallot and garlic. I toasted sourdough bread in the oven. My entire family devoured this.

Light and fresh tasting, this is an excellent use of the tomatoes from the garden.  I made it the day before to allow the flavors to meld, and added the basil just before serving to keep it from turning dark and unappetizing.  The recipe is good, but it was missing a little something, which I rectified by lightly drizzling balsamic vinegar.

I don't even like tomatoes but I have made this several times and it is always a hit, although, I half the recipe and load it with garlic.

I used the recipe just as written. "Except" I used 10 times the amount of Basil because I love it so much. But I have to admit this is the very first time I have ever used shallots in a recipe that wasn't cooked first! It was a real eye-opener and I'm going to use shallots again...and again. This is a great recipe and my neighbor totally loved it as well. I appreciate the suggestion of using a hearty bread for this and because I had some ciabatta rolls, I toasted them up on both sides so that they could stand up to all the liquid in the bruschetta and it was just delightful. Thanks again for a great recipe!

I added fresh mozzarella and more garlic than recipe called for.  Everyone loved it.  Even without my changes, it would have been delicious.

Got great reviews on this.  I used the baby San Marzano tomatoes and, while it was a lot of chopping, it was a great tomato flavor.

Excellent!  first time using shallots- wow are they strong!   I had excellent bruschette in Italy and am trying to match it, this is close!  But definitely would make this one again

This is an excellent recipe. The flavors only get better the next day. I made this as written except I chop up mozzarella and add that to the mixture as well. I have made this twice In Three days and I will make it again soon.

I used regular tomatoes from my garden rather than Roma. Just drained the extra juice twice. First taste after making the recipe the night before was bland, So, I added  white vinegar, salt and more basil. But, the toasted bread with the garlic olive oil and Roma cheese made it a five star. Lots of "that's delicious" from my friends.

I made this to take to a friend's house for an appetizer. The tomatoes and basil were fresh picked from our garden. One of the guests was the head chef at a Hawaiian resort and her liked it. Another guest liked it so much she drained the juices from her plate right into her mouth and then went for more!

We enjoyed this recipe very much.  I added extra garlic and salt to mix and served with shaved parmesan on top.  Tastes great with balsamic too!
