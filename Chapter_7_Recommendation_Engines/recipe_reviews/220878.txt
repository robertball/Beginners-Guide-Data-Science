I made one substitution--I used chopped peanuts in place of the sunflower seeds only because that was what I had on hand. The chocolate chips I used were mini and the peanut butter I used was Extra Crunchy Jif. I followed the directions exact, they were simple and right on point. These turned out great, my family loved these. I think these would be just as good if I omitted the brown sugar. I'm going to try another batch in a couple days and see if my family likes them as much as them without the extra sugar, then update my review.

These bars don't hold together when they are cut - can anyone suggest what might have gone wrong?

Easy to make and taste great. Pressed them into the pan to  help them hold together better. Possibly cut back a 1/2 cup of cereal next time to help them hold better!

This recipe is awesome! I cut back on a few things to make room for other stuff and they turned out great. For example, I substituted some of the rice cereal with oats and Shreddies, some sunflower seeds for poppy and sesame seeds, and raisins for craisins. I pressed the mixture into the pan quite a bit and they stuck together perfectly. The whole family loves them and I will be making a second batch today. Thanks for sharing!

I made 2 small changes: I used dried cranberries instead of the raisins and I used multi grain Cheerios for the cereal. These bars are wonderful. They are easy to make and are great for lunch boxes. Thank you for sharing the recipe :)

WOW! My family LOVED these bars. I made with chopped almonds as opposed to sunflower seeds. Truthfully, you can put anything in these bars and they are just delicious. This recipe is a keeper!

You saved my sanity!  My four year old grand-daughter was driving me insane -- we found this recipe and made it.  Easy to make, and tasted great.  Thank you!

Really yummy. Next time I am going to press chocolate chips on the top for extra chocolate, substitute cranberries instead of raisins, and add almonds to the mix. Thanks for the recipe!!!
