Thank you for the recipe.. I didn't have club soda so I used Sierra Mist and added a splash of triple sec.. It was DELICIOUS!

We love these, especially on warm summer nights.  We use 7up instead of club soda, and have also tried this with red wine and rose wine. Big fans!

Perfect for a warm night. I added ice cubes with raspberries and blackberries in them for a dinner party. Everyone loved it!

Good!  I added a bit of peach schnapps, as suggested, and think that makes it work a tad better.  I used a white zinfandel for the wine, which I really like.  Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect recipe. I always recommend a white wine that isn't too dry or oaky (I avoid chardonnays for this reason), so I recommend using a pinot grigio or a sauvignon blanc, based on your preference. Garnish with a lime wheel, throw in a splash of triple sec if you're adventurous, and enjoy the summer!

If you have no soda, use cranberry juice with white wine - very refreshing!

I LOVE THIS! Foolproof, easy, and you can customize to your personal taste. I also thought the peach schnaps does nicely. I used a shot of schnapps. Again, you can adjust it to personal taste.  I bet cranberry huice would be good, or some raspberry ginger ale, or strawberry pop. I love that we can play around with the flavors.

Good basic recipe.  I bought a box of Pinot Grigio and was able to keep the punch bowl full all night!  I mixed it with lemon San Pellegrino and raspberry ginger ale. Everyone asked me oh how did you make this!? Very easy to maintain throughout the night.

Easy, simple and delicious.  Just perfect for when you have some leftover wine that may have gone a bit flat.  You can substitute Sprite or sweeter 7UP for the club soda.  A slice of lime or lemon is a great accompaniment.
