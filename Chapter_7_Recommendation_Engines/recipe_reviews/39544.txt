This soup is absolutely delicious! Although, I must admit I made several changes - mostly based on previous reviews!  I've made this several times and always double the recipe. I saute lots of chopped garlic in olive oil and then add the chopped onions (2 large) and saute until tender. I add chopped tomatoes (with skin and seeds) and bring to a boil. I then add the chicken stock and cook for about 20 minutes.  I cool slightly and add fresh chopped basil (about 3 TBSP). I puree with a submergible blender (you can use a regular blender) and then add the roux as described in the recipe. I only add a half tsp sugar. In addition to the salt I add pepper to taste. I add 2 TBSP balsamic vinegar and about an 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. I add 1 cup heavy cream. I've only made this soup with home grown tomatoes. Now that the season is over I'm going to try it with store bought or even canned tomatoes. This soup is very sophisticated and I think would be great for a dinner party.  It was so good my Hubby wouldn't let me share it!!  I'm already looking forward to next years tomato crop - I'll never have too many now!!

This recipe turned out excellent; the soup tasted so fresh and healthy.  A few notes about this recipe.  First, the recipe says "1 slice onion"; I treated this as though it said "1 sliced onion", and it worked out perfectly (I am sure this is what was intented).  Also, as someone else noted, this recipe as it stands does not make enough soup.  I doubled the recipe and it made enough for 5 people to have one medium sized bowl of soup each.  At least double this recipe, if not triple it.  Also, by substituting vegetable stock for chicken broth, this recipe is vegetarian-friendly.
In addition, I made the following alterations:  added 1 bay leaf, 1 tsp crushed garlic, 1 tsp cayenne pepper, 1/2 cup milk, 1 Tbsp oregano, 1 tsp thyme, pepper to taste.
Delicious!

I always get a kick out of the reviews that change a recipe so much that it is no longer anything near the original! Look, the whole point of this recipe is that it is uncomplicated. There are plenty of really good fancy-sassy tomato soup recipes to try, if that's what you want. But this soup sticks to a great principle: simple recipes are often the best. And the result is what tomato soup should taste like. Few additives and fresh, ripe tomatoes. Real tomato flavor. Don't change a thing and you will be rewarded.

This soup was the best.  I didn't have cloves around the house, but it still turned out wonderfully, I added some garlic instead.  Also, Rather than discarding all of the tomatoes after they'd cooked, I pureed them for a few seconds in the blender, and added them to the rue.  It was fabulous.  Thanks!!!

Very Very Good.  This is by far MUCH better than canned tomato soup.  I’ve been making it for two summers now.  I peel the tomatoes first because I do not have a food meal.  I used to seed them too, but I found that a lot of the seeds come out while chopping them and any seeds left usually disappear in the blender.  I put the entire pot of soup in my blender (be careful! Once I burnt myself) and blend it to make it very smooth.  I take out the onion first.  I use one whole onion cut in half.  It adds a good flavor to the soup.  Some of us put a little milk in our individual servings.  We all enjoy the soup very much!  (TIP: Dunk tomatoes in boiling water for 30 sec to make the skin come right off.  I’ve also have held them under hot tap water until the skin came off easily.  Chopping them while they are still a little warm causes even more seeds to be left on the cutting board and not in your soup.)

This was a delicious soup Charlotte.  I did not have any fresh tomatoes on hand, so I used 2 (28 oz) cans of San Marzano Italian Peeled Tomatoes by "Cento".  They are one of the BEST brands of canned tomatoes and the next best thing to fresh!  I did use the liquid from one can, but drained the other and mashed the tomatoes by hand.  I sauteed 1 chopped onion and 2 cloves of garlic in a little oil and butter until soft and threw in 1 bay leaf and the cloves for a few seconds before adding the tomatoes and broth.  I sprinkled in a little thyme and oregano after adding the tomatoes and skipped the roux.  I stirred in 4 Tbls of butter to give the soup a heartier taste and instead of a food mill, I used my hand mixer to blend it all together.  At the end I stirred in 1/2 cup of whipping cream and about 15 fresh minced basil leaves.  Just a quick tip...always add basil at the end of your cooking time.  You never want to "cook" fresh basil very long because it will loose it's flavor.  Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was wonderful.  Best tomato soup I've ever had.  I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic, an extra bay leaf, and whole peppercorns (green, black, white, and red) along with the cloves.  I also used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian.  Top each bowlful with a handful of garlic croutons, and enjoy.

Every Saturday I get blemished tomatoes free from our local farmer's market and use them to make this soup.  Everyone loves it.  I can't imagine leaving out the cloves -- I think that's what makes it!  I use an electric stick blender to make it smooth and top it with a sprinkling of fresh grated Romano Cheese.

Great flavor. I used garlic cloves. I'll try to experiment with cloves in the future as well and see which I like better. I don't have a food mill and tried to blend it all in my blender. I was short on time, and put it in hot. I've learned to NEVER do that again, it just exploded out of the blender, creating a huge mess. Served it anyways, but everyone was limited to 1 small bowl because I lost some of the soup in the explosion.  A bit chunky, but good flavor. Will give myself more time to cool it off and blend the soup in the future.

Delicious.  I doubled the whole cloves and added some heavy cream.  I also quadrupled the recipe to have enough to save several servings in the freezer.  This soup reheats well and tastes amazing.  It has become a family favorite.
UPDATE:  I keep seeing reviews claiming this is made with cloves of garlic, not whole cloves.  I've now made it three ways.  With whole cloves, with garlic cloves, and with both.  I strongly believe this recipe is meant to be made with whole cloves.  (The little brown spikey ones.)  Adding some garlic isn't a bad way to go, and we are garlic lovers.  However, be cautious as it could easily overpower the delicacy of the tomato.  Using just the whole cloves gives it a tweak of sweet tang.  I can't describe it any better.  It is just wonderful!  Adding both gives it a more Italian flavor.  Just adding garlic and not the whole cloves is ok, but not as tasty.  It's almost as though something is missing, but is still flavorful.

My family really liked this recipe.  The cloves gave it a really distinct taste.  I was a little nervous about how they would make it taste but it was wonderful. I added about 1/8 tsp of white pepper and 1 clove of garlic to the tomato/onion/broth mixture to give it a little more flavor.  My husband added some meatballs that I had made earlier in the week for spaghetti and meatballs and he said that they were wonderful in the soup.

Try the Greykitty customized version of this recipe.  I used whole tomatos, no peeling of the skin necessary, and the seeds.  use 1 whole onion for the recipe. Double it.  And I was just short of 8 cups of tomatos and had a can of stewed on hand and used them.  Use fresh basil, not dried.  I do not have a food mill so blended after cooled and was delicious without the extra work or waste of peeling and de-seeding.  Also this recipe does not say to add basil so you have to use some common sense and add some if you use this recipe as is.  The customized version was delicious and will make it over and over. canned tomatoes will work too.  Loved it!

My husband went back for a third serving...definitely a hit!

I did follow the tips from the review listed below...

This soup is absolutely delicious! Although, I must admit I made several changes - mostly based on previous reviews! I've made this several times and always double the recipe. I saute lots of chopped garlic in olive oil and then add the chopped onions (2 large) and saute until tender. I add chopped tomatoes (with skin and seeds) and bring to a boil.

It was so good my Hubby wouldn't let me share it!! I'm already looking forward to next years tomato crop - I'll never have too many now!!

I had lots of tomatos from the garden and thought I'd make this for my husband and kids since I dont like tomato soup.  I sat down and tried it and oh my word it is a good comforting soup.  I followed the recipe to the T and I love it!

I'm giving this recipe a 5 star rating as it sounds great.  I'm quite surprised by reading many other reviews by modifying the recipe but did come across one review where it basically said there was and is no need to change it up and this recipe has a purpose of having it the way it is.  I will make this recipe tomorrow morning and will rate it once tasted.  Thanks for this recipe Charlotte!  UPDATE:  GOOD SUNDAY MORNING...I JUST FINISHED MAKING THIS RECIPE AND FOLLOWED IT EXACTLY.  THE AROMA REMINDED ME OF CAMPBELLS TOMATO SOUP.  WHEN ALL WAS DONE, I HAD TO TASTE IT AND "WOW"!!!  VERY GOOD.  IF I COULD, I WOULD NOW GIVE THIS RECIPE A 10 STAR RATING.  I WILL MAKE THIS RECIPE AGAIN AND AGAIN...I HAVE A GARDEN FULL OF TOMATOES SO NOW I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE EXTRA AND WILL FREEZE THE SOUP FOR THE WINTER MONTHS TO COME.  THANKS AGAIN CHARLOTTE!!!

A good basic recipe for tomato soup, but needs tweaking. The soup turned out with too heavy a butter flavor and too salty. Also, note that 6 servings mean 6 very small cups. 

Suggestions:
1) use more tomatoes and less chicken broth
2) make roux with olive oil instead of butter
3) add low fat milk instead of cream for a healthier alternative

WOW! I don't think I have ever bothered to input a review yet but i just had to with this recipe. I made a few small changes based on what others had to say - I added 3 cloves of garlic and 3 bay leaves. Other than that I followed the directions perfectly and I just couldn't get enough of it. I will never make canned tomato soup again!!

Great soup,  and I'm not a big fan of tomato soup.  I tried this recipe because my husband loves tomato soup.  

I used 2 28 oz. cans of diced tomatos,  a small can of tomato paste, and used a sweet Vidalia onion for my onion.  Didn't have whole cloves,  but used a few pinches of powdered cloves.  Followed the recipe as written.  It came out as a rich, thick tomato bisque.  Chopped fresh basil mixed in at the end and used on top as a garnish as well made it extra delicious.  Husband asked me to not buy canned soup anymore,  and I agree!

I finally got around to making this soup.
Unfortunatly I didn't plant tomatoes this year and (as I knew I would) am now kicking myself. I picked up some really ripe tomatoes from the grocery store quick sale shelf for $1.49. I had enough tomatoes to increase the recipe to 9 servings. Well the soup was eaten for dinner and what was left was polished off as a before bed snack. My 13 yr. old son was the culprit. I am so happy when he can dig into something healthy. This soup tasted like Campbells Tomato Soup, only better because it was fresher and cleaner tasting. I think the cloves are very important in this recipe. If I hadn't known about them I don't think I would have guessed. But they are an important flavour element. I recommend including them. For a simple, no fuss meal I served this soup with a mixture of grilled cheese sandwiches and hot dogs. For sure I will be on the lookout for some more lovely tomatoes, on sale or not. Thanks so much for sharing.

very tasty! I sauteed the onion and garlic in olive oil and cooked the tomatoes in it before adding the broth. I also added 2 cloves (spice) because indian tomato soups call for cloves and i like the taste of it. By accident I didn't 'gently' boil! So I had to add half a cup of water when I blended the soup (I don't have a food mill). Maybe I boiled too much away because the soup was perfect consistency - not too thick or thin. I added some oregano, paprika and cumin and let it simmer for a couple of minutes. Delish! I ate it with sour cream. I will definitely make this again. 
p.s. remove the clove (spice) before blending, sometimes it doesn't blend well and you're left with pieces in the soup.

I pulled 4 good sized tomatoes from the garden, and one nicely ripened red pepper for this recipe (an afterthought). I roasted and peeled the pepper and just tossed it in to simmer with everything. After 20 minutes, I used the immersion blender but found the consistency a bit off yet, so I passed it through a wire strainer. Charlotte, this was an awesome bowl of soup! For you.....5+ stars. Thank you for this. UPDATE: I tried this with chopped garlic. I'm glad I did...a nice touch.

Great soup! I'm concerned about the confusion over the "cloves." Although I'm sure garlic is good, actual cloves are what made it so special to me, worth buying if you don't have any.

This is wonderful recipe everyone loves it including my tomato hating daughter. I served it for Thanksgiving dinner for 14 people and they thought it was great. I prepared the soup the day before then heated it up just before dinner. Then I mixed together sour cream with a good serving of parmesan cheese. A good dollop of this mixture was dropped into the center of each bowl of hot soup. Glorious!

I have been making this recipe for a couple of year.
This is my basic tomato soup whenever I have tomatoes in my garden, freezer, or from friends.
It's great with any kind of sandwiches. I sometimes add 1/2 cup of sourcream to get cream of tomato soup.  Also when making a chili, I use this recipe instead of canned tomatoes.

Fantastic and filling soup.  I used an immersion blender instead of the food mill and it worked great.  I also only had ground cloves instead of whole, so I did about a small sprinkle per whole clove in the recipe.  So yummy.

This is very good.  I used one whole onion, chopped, 4 cloves garlic, minced, and sauteed them in olive oil before adding the tomatoes.  I did not peel the tomatoes, but I did remove as much of the seeds as I could.  I also added basil.  Since I do not have a food mill, I pureed the soup in the blender before adding to the roux.  Delicious.

very thick, and fresh tasting soup. definitly double the recipe, which is enough for 5 decent-sized bowls. I added 2 tbsp's chopped fresh basil (add it right at the end) and a sprinkle of Gruyere cheese ontop. also added a pinch of cayenne to the pot.

Great recipe!! The only thing is- DON’T USE CLOVES. I have a feeling the author meant garlic cloves. I used cloves the first time I made it, and it was good, but that’s all you could taste. And I even used less than recommended. Trust me, cloves and tomato soup do not go well together. If you do decide to follow the recipe and add them, tread lightly… Otherwise, it’s great if you use GARLIC CLOVES.

Excellent Recipe in that the basic foundation is there and can stand on its own. I however like most who reviewed this soup added my own little twists. I doubled the recipe, used fresh very ripe tomatoes from our garden, fresh basil 1/4 cup chopped fine,dried basil 1t (post food mill) fresh garlic 4 cloves, garlic powder 1t (post food mill) cracked black peppercorn to taste, and 1 cup of half & half, i only added 1t of the sugar, doubled the salt (kosher), I used ground clove 1/4 t, if you use ground be careful you can over do it.
My wife and I enjoyed this soup and it was awesome to use up some of the bumper crop of fresh tomatoes from our garden. we will be making this soup again and putting some away for the colder months!  Thanks Charlotte!

Awesome soup!!! My family loved it!! I followed some of the suggestions in the reviews. I replaced the cloves with garlic and basil and I did not remove the skin. I pureed the soup once it cooled down. Will make this again for sure! Thanks for the recipe!

I used my VitaMix blender to toss my whole tomatoes in it before I cooked this. The seeds & skin disappear and you dont have to worry about handling hot tomatoes.

This was delicious!  I did add some garlic and fresh basil and cayene pepper and I used a large sweet onion.  Since I don't own a food mill, I just used an emulsion mixer.  The consistancy was great at this point, but I went ahead and made the roux.  I won't do that step again only because I don't think it made any difference in the soup.  When I served it I added a swirl of sour cream and a couple of fresh basil leaves on top.  I'll be making this again and again.

Never made fresh tomato soup before. This really outdoes Campbell's & everyone else out there. I'm not even a tomato soup fan at all. Now I am! I added one carrot, sliced. And I do not have a food  mill, so I pureed and then strained the soup. All worked out just fine!

Supremely good recipe. Followed it to a tee (with the exception of a tiny addition of basil). Put it all through the blender as I didn't have one of those food mill contraptions. Best tomato soup ever.

WOW!!!!! So easy!!!This is one of the best tomato soups I have made from scratch. I did however find it easier removing the skin first a big help. I used a fine strainer and pushed thru until no more liquid dripped and that worked well no food mill needed. I would very much sugest doubling this recipe.

Very good, very easy to make. I used ground gloves as it was all I had on hand, used about 1/3 teaspoon, might cut back next time. Also added a teaspoon of basil and a bay leaf, on the recommendations of many reviewers and it was delicious!

I work for a lovely elderly gentleman who grows his own tomatoes in his backyard garden and every summer we wonder what to do with all of them! After finding this recipe we now have another delicious way to use them. I made an extra batch and froze it in serving-sized containers and it worked out beautifully. So much better than canned and a fun project to work on together. My grand-daughter enjoyed making it with me too! Very easy and very flavorful! I just blanched the tomatoes in boiling water to remove the skins, chopped them, put them in a saucepan, liquid, seeds and all (but I didn't add any chicken broth) with 1/2 a small chopped fresh onion, some basil and oregano, brought it to a boil over medium heat and let it cook for 20 minutes. I don't have a food mill so I put it in the blender for a few seconds then easily pressed it thru a sieve using the back of the ladle I put it in the blender with, made the thickener as directed, added some dry milk powder, the salt, and sugar, and it came out wonderful! In the bowl I topped it with some grated Parmesan and a pat of butter...delicious!

This soup was really good! The only thing, though, was that it had a really big clovey taste. Next time, I will cut down on the cloves.

Wow, this is fantastic!  I didn't have any cloves on hand, so instead I added some garlic and celery to it, and it just turned out beautifully.  Very bright orange!  I was surprised at the color, but it's lovely.  It was more work than I thought it would be, but it was certainly worth it.  I would suggest making a double batch of this, because after you strain it, there's not a whole lot left.  Also, if you're looking for a thicker soup, you should double the amount of roux you put in.  It's just not enough to make it thick.  Still very good.

I really loved the taste of this soup, although I did not add the cloves, and I added milk to it at the end to make it more creamy.  Also, it says it's scaled to 6 srvgs, but it only like 3 bowls.  So definitely double or even triple it!!

5+ OMG this was so good. Now one change only because I did not think I had cloves, so added 3 star anise, found the cloves and added them. It was the best recipe. Thanks for sharing. I will be using this recipe alot.

This is the perfect soup for an abundance of home grown tomatoes!  I made a couple of changes to give it a little kick.  First I sauteed the onion (I assumed they meant one onion, sliced, so that's what I did) with a clove of minced garlic and some olive oil.  I added the cloves in the last minute of the saute.  I then added the tomato and chicken broth and cooked as directed.  I don't have  a food mill so I pulsed the mixture in the blender then put through the strainer.  I finished as directed but added a few dashes of cayenne pepper...and then a few more!  And as mentioned by another reviewer, this recipe is best doubled.  Easy, light and wonderful!

I will never buy canned soup again! I didn't care for the cloves either and will omit next time. I also used vegetable broth to make vegetarian friendly.

Unbelievable! We sat down to dinner.My husband tried one spoonfull of the soup, took the phone and called his parents to say : "We are having the best tomato soup, its the one you can find in top-level restaurants only!" Used the tomatoes from my garden, the leftovers from the chicken broth I made a couple of days before that. Didnt have any cloves OR garlic, so put a little bit of garlic powder  and I am sure it could be even better with the real garlic. Used a blender, since we dont have a food mill. Dont think a food mill would do that great of a job though. Blender makes it very fine. Thank you for the recipe!!

I bought a food mill just so I could make this recipie, and it was worth it!  The consistency is so smooth and the garden tomatoes were so sweet that I did not need to add sugar.

The only change I made in this recipe was to reduce the amount of sugar.  For health's sake I only used one half teaspoon. I did not have a food mill, so I used a strainer.  It worked very well.  It had a great taste, but I had a few lumps when I added the mixture to the roux.  I'm sure I could have smoothed it out in the blender.  It is a good recipe and tastes similar to bought soup without the excessive amount of sodium.  I never would have thought to use cloves, but that was just what it needed.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will make it again.

Friends, after many years of dealing with puréeing soups, I finally figured it out: purée first, THEN cook. For those of us who use food processors with a plastic bowl, this will save time and ease your mind if you worry about hot food and plastic.

I added a clove of garlic and sauteed it with the onion. I left out the cloves. Added 6 fresh basil leaves, chopped, right before blending. Added a tiny but of cream at the end - maybe 1 tbsp and seasoned with salt and pepper. Turned out AMAZING! And I'm a definite food snob!

I made this recipe exactly as it states, with only one slice of onion, and I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth.  It is THE best tomato soup, my husband and I have ever had!!  No way does it make 6 servings, however, unless they are only 1 cup servings.  More like 3 or 4 at most.  I added nothing else and it was EXCELLENT!

Delicious!  Like others I used it as a base.  I used all of the listed ingredients but substituted a rounded tsp of ground cloves for the whole cloves.  Also, I seeded my tomatoes and left skins on.  Then I chopped them, the onion and two garlic cloves in a food processor.  Cooked as stated then cooled and pureed in blender as I did not want to throw anything away.  The only additional ingredient I added was fresh dill.  I added the entire sleeve (outside of sleeve reads .66 oz/18 grams).  I like the taste of fresh dill and got the idea from another recipe posted on this website.

This tomato soup is outstanding.  You'll never want to eat the canned stuff again.  I peeled and seeded (doesn't take as much time as it sounds) tomatoes so didn't need a strainer or mill.  If you have an abundance of summer tomatoes, do yourself a favor and make this soup!

I made this soup several times during tomato season; it is fabulous!! I also assumed that 'a sliced onion' was what was meant. Once when making this soup, I had grilled red and green peppers as leftovers, and right before pureeing the soup, I added them to the mix. This added yet another layer of flavor. Also found that fresh marjoram works well in the soup and with the cloves. Added a couple of minced garlic cloves, too. THANKS for this great recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have never had fresh tomato soup before (always canned) and this was delicious.  I added fresh basil to the tomato mixture while it was simmering.  I did not have a food mill, so I pureed the tomato mixture in a blender and then put the mixture through a regular sieve to remove the seeds.  Then I added the tomato mixture to the flour and butter.  At the end I added a little fat-free half & half.  It turned out wonderfully.

I generally make soups in large quantities to freeze for future meals. For this one, I used tomatoes from our garden that I had frozen. I used about 18 lbs. of tomatoes, cored, peeled and diced them. Depending on type of tomatoes used, the skins can cause bitterness. I added about 8 cups of homemade chicken stock that had been reduced and 6 cups of water. I added 2 large onions sliced, 16 cloves, about 1/4 cup of chopped garlic, 2 tbsp. sea salt, 4 tbsp. sugar (sugar cuts the acidity of the tomatoes), and 4 tbsp. of Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar. I didn't have fresh basil on hand, so I added about 3 tbsp. of dried after the mixture started boiling. I let the mixture boil gently for about 45 minutes to completely soften the onions and garlic. Then used an immersion blender to blend everything. I had 2 cups of heavy cream that would soon go bad. So I mixed it in after the blending. I mixed the roux in a separate pot using garbanzo bean flour and all-purpose estimating about 6 times the recipe, and followed the recipe instructions. The resulting soup was wonderful. This is a recipe that would be difficult to mess up if only using the ingredient quantities as a guideline. I seldom accurately measure anything, except in bread baking, and go primarily on appearance and taste. This is a good basic recipe. If you are a new cook, the recipe as-is is great. If you are experienced, the measurements are not so important as the look and taste. Rice can be added for tomato rice soup.

I quite liked this, although I did change it. Added less cloves. Also added garlic powder and celery salt. Didn't use the flour/butter. Used an immersion blender. Added a couple of tablespoons of cream cheese at the very end.

Good flavour and cinsistency.

Not sure I'll ever use canned soup again. If you don't like the skins in your soup, blanch the tomatoes in boiling water for about 30 seconds, until the skins crack, then drain in a colander and rinse in cool tap water. The skins will slip off easily. Used an immersion blender instead of a food mill, and it worked well. Delicious with a grilled gruyere and cheddar sandwich and carrot/celery sticks.

I really don't like tomato soup.  I was craving it one day while pregnant and tried this.  I am hooked!  It is soo good and so different.  It was really yummy.  I didn't even use the food mill or anything.  I just ate it a little bit chunky and it was fine!

This is really wonderful. The cloves make the recipe. Without the cloves, it's just a good tomato soup, nothing out of the ordinary. With the cloves, it's a unique treat. I used two 28 oz cans of whole tomatoes, and just put a submersible hand-blender right into the pot. It worked great. I made this twice, and the 2nd time, I did not even make the 'roux'. The consistency is lovely without it, just thick enough. And it's healthier without the butter, so now I can make this often and feel great about it. You can throw in a half-cup of cream of half-and-half, but I did not find this to make a big difference. One word of advice: do 'not' add basil to this soup. While most tomato soup is better with basil, it doesn't work here because of the cloves. Cloves and basil just do not go together. Trust me... I tried. :-)

I'm glad I doubled this recipe, I think as written it would have been 6 pretty small servings.  Doubling it we have 6-8 servings.  Other then that the only change I made was using veggie base rather then chicken and I reduced the sugar and salt some.  What a great soup.

This was a really good soup. However, at the end of the day (or the recipe actually) it just needed something more. So I added some heavy cream, about 1/4 cup, and it turned into tomato bisque. It was perfect at that point. Great flavor and beautifully creamy taste. My soup was not totally smooth as I did not have a food miller to use. I used a food processor instead and it worked well. Actually, I think that gave it some texture and it was a better soup for it. Will make again.

I think this is a good base to start a soup...but it seems pretty much everyone has added/removed stuff to make it better which is why I'm only giving 3 stars as is.  Next time I will omit the cloves or maybe only add 1, the flavor of them is WAY too overwhelming!  I wish I would have read the reviews to find that a lot of people didn't add them or only put in 1.  Unless you LOVE the flavor of cloves, I would add sparingly.  I added 2 garlic cloves and will add more next time.  I also added half and half to make it a creamier soup.  I added a little bit of basil too because I was trying to get rid of the clove flavor.  After the first step, I put it in the food processor and then strained it through a strainer.  Put the stuff in the strainer back through the food processor again and then strained that which left a nice smooth soup, no lumps, chunks, seeds or anything like that.  I will definitely try this again with more left over summer tomatoes and some adjustments!  :)  

Back to change my rating to a 2...the more I thought about it, the cloves just ruined this soup.  I made the tomato basil soup recipe from this site and that's  a winner.

This soup was really good. It was my first time making tomato soup with tomatoes from my garden.  I didn't have cloves so I left that out. I also didn't have a food mill, so after the boiling I put it through a blender and then strained it, discarded the seeds etc. and continued with the rest of the recipe. It turned out great.

Who knew tomato soup could be so good?  I had some very ripe tomatoes that had to be used and this was the perfect solution.  If you are using this as a main course it will likely only feed two.  I added a chili pepper, bay leaf, and garlic to the simmering blend and used a 1/2 teaspoon of ground chives instead of whole chives.  I also blended everything into the soup (sans the bay leaf.) I added the salt but it was a bit too much; I will use less next time and I added a turn of Basalmic vinegar before serving.  What a surprising treat this turned out to be.

WOW!  I love this soup!!  It has to be one of the best recipes I have tried on this site in a long time.  Trying to use up a bunch of soft tomatoes and this was the way to go.  I used 1 can of Fat free/no salt added chicken broth and a nice extra thick slice of white onion in addition to about 4-6 cloves of garlic (does anyone else wonder if the recipe author means whole cloves as in the spice??  I can't imagine putting a sweet spice such as cloves in this soup, so I used cloves of garlic).  No food mill here, so I used my immersion blender right in the soup pot then ran the soup thru a sieve to remove the solids.  The roux made an amazing difference in texture - the soup thickened right up and took on that beautiful orange-red color and fantastic silky creaminess that you get with a cream soup - but no cream here!  I didn't even add the salt or sugar as I liked the tangy fresh tomato taste in the soup.  I will absolutely make this again and tell all my friends too!

Oh, sweet Lord.  This is my first time making homeade tomato soup(gazpacho is my fav.).This recipe is sooooooo perfect.  The flavoring is subtle and delish.  I however do not have a food mill, so I put it in my blender then poured it through a strainer.  My DH (very skeptical and loving his canned tomato soup) flipped over this.  I can't wait for my garden to start producing.
Has anyone tried to freeze this yet?  If so I would like to know how it did.  Thankyou, thankyou, thankyou for posting this recipe.

DELICIOUS!!!!! I used a blender stick to smash up the tomatoes, onions, etc., and then put it through a strainer before adding it back to the roux. I would serve this as a first course for a nice dinner party without hesitation. It is very, very rich!!!!

Absolutely yummy!  I did make this today (Nov.28) but I used farm fresh tomatoes.  And I sauteed a whole onion (didn't understand the "1 slice onion" part) with 4 cloves of garlic in some butter and olive oil while I chopped the tomatoes.  I used ground clover, but only a few dashes.  And I put it through a blender.  DELICIOUS!!  My hubby had thirds!!  Will make OFTEN.

I didn’t use any cloves (because I didn’t have any). Before adding everything into the pot, I put about 2 tbsp of olive oil and 3 cloves of garlic sliced. I waited until the garlic was fried up and browned on both sides before adding the onion. I chopped up the onion instead of using the rings. When the onion was beginning to get tender, I added the tomatoes. I sautéed the tomatoes with the onions and the garlic for a little bit before adding the chicken broth. If it makes any difference to you, I used College Inn low sodium chicken stock. Then I lowered the heat and let it simmer for about half an hour to forty minutes until the tomatoes got good and mushy.

I drained the soup into a large mixing bowl with a strainer. Then I took all the tomato stuff and pureed it in a food processor and returned it to the soup.

With the flour, it’s easier to put it in a bowl with a ladle of soup to melt it that way and get rid of all the lumps before introducing it into the empty stockpot.

I didn’t use any sugar, but I used a little blessed salt and pepper.

It came out great! My guests raved for more! And a good way to use up a lot of tomatoes.

This was good.  I omitted the cloves and added a touch of half-and-half for some creaminess.  It was delicous.

Great Recipe. It's so easy! You definitely need to double the recipe if you want to feed more than 3 people. I used 1/2 teaspoon ground clove and 1 garlic clove minced. I also used a food mill and I had no problems. I will definitely use this over and over again. Forget buying store bought Tomato Soup!!

Simply the best!  I used Roma tomatoes and it was so tasty that there wasn't any left to share it with anyone!   If you're going to leave the tomatoes in, it's best to blanch and peel them first.

I think this could have been a good soup but the cloves completely overpower it. I used less than the recipe called for and it is still all I could taste. I added more liquid and several other things to try to cut down the taste of the cloves but to no avail. I doubled the recipe as per other reviews and now I have a huge pot of inedible soup. Complete waste of time and ingredients.

The recipe left me with some creative license.  It says "1 slice onion".  I went ahead and added 1 whole sliced onion, but next time will add a little less (maybe just one thick slice).  The recipe said "4 whole cloves".  I see that some of the reviewers added cloves of garlic, but I just added 4 of the spice cloves (they look like little nails).  Didn 't care for the taste of the cloves, so next time I will add 1 clove of garlic, instead.  Our family does not use butter, so I made the roux with olive oil.  My husband drank the soup cold out of the refrigerator; said it tasted like V-8.  I ate mine hot off the stove, with crumbled saltines.  Will definitely make this again.

tried this with my fresh tomatoes from the garden.  Family did not especially like it as the whole cloves gave it a very different flavor than any other tomato soup we ever had.  I love clove, but not in tomato soup.

Just made this and it is definitely more tasty than the canned tomato soup.  I dislike cloves so I added 2 cloves of spanish garlic and that seemed to give it the right flavor, along with the red onion I used.  It was thinner than we like but perhaps that is because I didn't run it through the food mill so I made a little bit extra rue to thicken it up a bit more.  Will make again when the heirloom tomatoes hit the farmers market.   Good solid base recipe that is easy to modify to your family's taste. Update:  just took some from the freezer for lunch and it was better the second time around. Freezes very well, much better than other tomato soups I've made.Edit:  I made this today and did use the food mill.  It still came out a bit thin for our tastes.  Instead of making a bit more rue, I added a splash of cream (no more than 2 tablespoons) for a slightly richer taste and I forgot the sugar (and certainly didn't miss it).  What a wonderful, easy to follow recipe!

Charlotte, your soup is wonderful.  I made it today and my only changes were to carmelize the onions and add 1 t of garlic (from the tube) that I had on hand.  This will be my go to recipe for summer tomato soup from now on.

This was my first time making tomato soup from anything but a can, and it turned out great! and it was not complicated at all.
I did not have a food processer or food mill or anything like it, so I just used a regular sive/ strainer with really tiny holes. I doubled the recipe and added one whole red onion cut in half and in addition to the cloves I added 1 - 2 cloves of garlic (depending on how you like garlic) I followed the directions in the recipe on what to do and when.  Also when making the roux mixture I added a cup of milk to the roux heated until thickened a little and added it into the tomato liquid after straining the tomatos (and I did not peel or seed the tomatos and I had no problem) I did not have any basil but I did add oregano and it tasted fantastic! and not to mention my 1 1/2 year old son and 3 year old daughter finished the bowl of soup I gave them. This recipe is a keeper. As I said we doubled the recipe and two adults and two little ones almost finished it off.

I added my own spin, I don't have a food mill so I blanched and peeled the tomatoes first.  I did add about 1 1/2 tablespoons of tomato paste when adding the tomato mixture into the roux.  I cut down the amount of clove because of other reviewers, added oregano.  Next time I am going to quadruple the batch and freeze some, we had no leftovers with just 2 adults and 2 small children.

This was very good and hit the spot.  I was lazy and used canned tomatoes.  I also added fresh basil and celery.  I pureed about 3/4 of the mixture so there were some chunks in there.

I didn't have any fresh tomatoes on hand so I used some canned Italian style tomatoes. I added a bit of milk to the roux as well. I really love this!  Great tasting, simple and wonderful for a cold winter's evening!! No more condensed stuff for me!

This was perfefctly fantastic!  I did leave the cloves out and I used onion powder instead of fresh onion (1 TBSP).  I pureed the tomato mixture in my blender and then screened the mixture through a mesh sieve to remove the remaining seeds and skins.  The soup was seasoned perfectly with the advised amount of salt and sugar.  YUMMY!  Thanks for posting such a fantastic recipie!

The best tomato soup I've ever made. I changed it up a little. I cooked the tomatoes, onion, cloves, and used vegetable broth instead of chicken. Then when that was done I put it in my vitamix. Then poured it straight into the roux. It was awesome!!

This soup was really good and tasted so fresh! My kids even loved it ;0) Only thing, the cloves were a little overpowering for my taste, but dont get me wrong, in no way did it ruin the soup. May try 1 clove next time instead of 4.

Loved this recipe.  I used a homemade vegetable stock (recipe from allrecipes)  instead of the chicken broth to make this vegetarian.  This was the first time I made this soup and I used the 2 teaspoons of sugar and it tasted too sweet.  Next time I will use 1/2-1 tsp.  I would recommend doubling the recipe.

This soup is fabulous.  The only change I made was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken broth (to make it vegetarian) and added some cream at the end.  Unbelievably good and freezes great!

It only took me 7 years after I put this in my recipe box to make this soup!  It was tasty - even though I didn't read the recipe thoroughly enough and used 4 GARLIC cloves instead of cloves.  It was still tasty... just with a definitely garlic undertone!

Delicious!  I added a pinch of ground cloves since I did not have whole.  I also added one clove of garlic.  Used a blender and strained the tomato mixture before adding it to the roux.

I'd say I was disappointed with this. It was thinner than I'd expected and though I added some onion and garlic, just not that flavorful. (All I tasted were the onion and garlic and I did not use that much.)

I made this soup to aid my summer cold and this turned out to be a beautiful, light soup. I followed the recipe except that I added 8 pepper corns and a bay leaf (i put it in a tea ball so i could easily get it out), added 2 cloves of garlic, used half the sugar and used a dash of crushed cloves since i did not have whole. for the broth i used 'organic better than  bullion'. It was easy, healthy and good for the belly!

Okay I totally cheated. I used canned tomatoes in this "garden fresh" recipe. I liked the recipe and had canned tomatoes so I decided to try it. I put 2 cans of chopped tomatoes and 1/2 an onion. I didn't have whole cloves so I used ground cloves, unfortunately I put too much in. That was the only thing I would do differently, it turned out great! My family loved it! Thanks!

Excellent, but as mentioned, portions are off.  You would definately want to double this for six servings.  I played with the recipe a bit.  Added three chopped cloves of garlic with onion.  Also had no whole cloves so put in a dash or two of powdered.  Added thyme and some black pepper as well.  Skipped the sugar.  I used a food processor at beginning and end of recipe.  I did not discard anything.  Also added a sprinkle of parmesan on top when served.

i had to change the recipe because of lack of some ingredients. i doulbed the recipe used half chicken and half beef stock. used ground cloves and minced garlic. i did pull the materd and onions out of the stock and pulsed em for a somewhat chunky soup. just eye-balled the rest of the spices and added to taste. a keeper! i'll remember the chix stock for this. bay scallops would rock in this!

I made 4 double batches already this summer with my bounty of garden fresh tomatoes. Cored tomatoes and stuck everything in the vita mix. Froze most so I can enjoy this in the Fall and Winter. I substituted vegetarian bouillion. I used garlic cloves instead of actual cloves. (I smelled the cloves in the store and I didn't like them.) I learned after my first batch to not to double the salt, keep it at 1 tsp when doubling. I also wisk some sour cream in before eating for added creaminess and fat which make it taste really good.

If I could give this ten stars I would! I LOVED this recipe.  I have always been a huge fan of tomato soup and thought that it was about time I tried making one myself.  I found this one through the recommendation of a friend and couldn't help but eat more than one bowl the night I made it.  Absolutely delicious and I will be making it again and again!

This recipe will change your opinion of canned tomato soup forever!! We grew a garden and I had so many tomatoes and I was looking for something to do with them other than canning them.  I made this soup to serve with sandwiches and it was a big hit!  I don't have a food mill so I just strained it with my finer-holed colander and it was fine.  I will make this again next fall when the tomatoes are coming in faster than I can use them!

We thought this was ok. Changed it up a little as suggested by others and VIVIBO: I doubled the recipe, use a pinch of ground cloves, used 3 large cans whole toms,  sauteed chopped garlic in olive oil add the chopped onions (1 large) and saute until tender. Pureed with a submersible blender (instead of a food mill) and then added the roux as described in the recipe. Added  2 tbl sugar and 1 cup milk.

This soup was wonderful! What a great way to use all of these tomatoes from my garden. I added some fresh basil and oregano from the garden as well. Topped with cheddar cheese, this soup was so good I had to go back for seconds. I read the recipe wrong and put in 4 cloves of garlic instead of just cloves. It was awesome that way. I agree that it doesn't make much soup and you should double the recipe. The second time I made this I added a touch of cream and it made it even better!

This was OK. The recipe didn't state if the 1 slice of onion was thick or thin and I wasn't sure if you put all of the cloves and onion through the food mill, too. So I did and the soup had a strange taste.

Easy recipe. I did not add the cloves and instead put in basil. It ends up very thick, so I used more chicken broth to thin it out. Very good recipe.

Super Yummy! I made this a few nights ago and both my son and I had several bowls. My husband did not care for it so that was fine with me as I took the rest for lunch the next day. I  did change a few things and like some of the other reviewers....I added garlic...basil and red pepper flakes and also...some additional sugar. I left the soup as is and did not make the roux at the end as it was already thick enough for our liking and it was....perfect! I will definitely be making this one again.

Yes! I loved it. This is the first time I have tried to make homemade tomato soup. I had brought a large package of tomatoes from Easy Way and did not want them to go to waste. I always love Allrecipes.com, they have the best recipes. I found this one and made it. It is so tasty, I will never buy can tomato soup again....I am so domestic now......

Yum! I don't think I'll use canned Tomato Soup any more. I made just as it states. It's so easy and makes a great meal along with grilled cheese sandwiches. I did not have food mill, I used my blender worked good, just let it cool first before putting in the blender or you will end up in a mess! I'm surprised how many review a recipe , but change the first time. A true review is when you do just as it calls for the first time around. I might like to spice this up a bit  next time, but not sure what to add any suggestions?

Great! I made it...added about a 1/4 cup white wine after sautéing the onions in 2 tbs of olive oil. After cooking for about 20 I blended the entire soup (removed the cloves- I would actually not put these in next time at all). Followed the rest exactly.

I added carrots for sweetness instead of sugar. And when I made the roux I added a little cream. I also put mine through a food processor before the food mill. I think this is a great recipe  especially as a base recipe. I look forward to adding an herb bouquet next time.

Used a whole sweet sliced onion along with homemade chicken stock and fresh tomatoes from the garden. I REMOVED THE CLOVES before processing with my immersion blender. No need to strain. Be sure to slowly brown (and stir constantly) the (I used sweet butter) butter-flour mix over low heat - took about 5 minutes for mine to be the correct color. Perfect tomato soup.

Excellent, simple recipe. My family loved it! 

I did take other reviewers suggestions to double the recipe, added a little cream at the end and lots of fresh basil and thyme before giving it a final blend with the immersion blender. The cloves gave it a deeper and more complex flavor, as opposed to a straight tomato flavor. I also used fresh tomatoes from my garden.

Excellent results and very simple. Wow~!

This soup was delicious; however, I have one huge complaint.  Using the directions given, this did not make 6 servings.  Rather, it made exactly one bowl of soup.  I should've known that 2 cups of broth was an unusually small amount, but it was my first time making homemade soup.

So so so good!  I followed the other reviewers advice and this was excellent.  This was my first year growing tomatoes in the back yard so I was very excited to make this!

I loved this recipe and if you have a really BIG garden like we do, its a real life saver. Plus, I hate, hate, HATE tomato soup recipes that call for canned tomatoes. 

Great job Charlotte!!!!

This is the BEST recipe for tomato soup on this site, hands down.   I omitted the cloves because I'm allergic to them and used olive oil instead of butter and it turned out just fine.    I skipped the step of straining the mixture in my first batch, which was a mistake.  Even though I have a VitaMix, I ended up with several pine-needle like pieces of tomato skin in the soup.   Straining the blended mixture before adding to the roux is a must.

I took another posters advice, and ran this through a blender instead of a food mill. 

I also added a small amount of balsamic vinegar and milk. 

I didn't have fresh basil. I added some dried basil. And also some extra onion.

It turned out great!!! 
I didn't add any sugar...

This is a very good recipe! Unfortunately, I tweeked the recipe a bit- sorry!!!
I made (& froze) 30 servings (16 small rectangle Glad containers). I added 2 cans of Northern beans (blended) for fiber/protein, 8 cloves of garlic, dash of balsamic vinegar, half a pint of heavy cream, 22 cups of diced roma tomatoes from my garden, thyme, rosemary & basil -whew! Anyway- this was a very good recipe! Dare I say I can't wait for the cold weather to come so I can try this soup!!  Use this recipe and you won't be let down!

I make homemade soups all the time... but Tomato is one that I have never made..... I made this one and enjoyed it.... Although I did change one thing about it because I never had any chicken, vegetable or beef broth on had..... so I used ceasars drink instead... I don't know if I'll bother wirh another broth since tasting it this way.... I drizzled a cirlcle of cream, made my own garlic bread... toasted it for croutons and I topped it with some shredded cheese... Being on  my own it made two large soupbowl sized portions...  I did change the liquid but the other change for my taste is I will try less cloves next time.... Thank you Charlotte for such an easy but most flavorful recipe....  Oh yeah, fresh basil put in at the end is the perfect finish to this soup....

Great recipe!  I canned several quarts using this recipe. I did not add the cloves instead I used a large clove of garlic as advised by another reviewer.  This is a keeper!

I made this with beef instead of chicken stock (per pantry), and forgot to put in the salt and sugar at the end.  Also used ground clove rather than whole.  It was delicious!  I will DEFINITELY make it again, as its a great use for the tomatoes that are one step too soft for sandwich slices.

Very good recipe. Like almost everybody else we added our own thing ( a small amount of grated lemon peel at the end). The aroma and the extra layer of flavor was fantastic. Will do this again.

This recipe makes brilliant soup! I listened to other reviews and added garlic, 1tsp cayene pepper and thyme and 1 tbsp oregano as well as a dash of milk. Also, I used canned tomatoes and it worked beautifully! My husband said it was the best soup he had ever had and he doesnt even like tomatoes! thank you!

I am not a tomato soup fan but I had an abundance of tomatoes grow this year and needed to use them quickly. I followed another reviewer with adding sauted onion and garlic (which I love) and adding some basil near the end of the cooking process prior to the puree. In the end I made this reciepe twice now and actually went to the farmers market to buy more tomatoes! I used as many tomatoes as I could get in the pot. It was delicious! Tomatoe soup has made my list!

yay! I used this to get rid of a combination of cherry tomatos, and slicer tomatos and it was excellent! I skipped the flour butter thickener and used a pinch of instant potatoes instead. Used the immersion blender to get everything smooth. :)

Better Than Cambell's! I did however add some crushed garlic cloves and a little brown sugar (to lower the acidity) - just my own tatste. I have made this several times and its always a crowd pleaser. Note if you don't have a food mill you can work it through a sive.

This was great! I did triple the recipe and skinned the tomatoes beforehand. I sauted the onion and a few cloves of garlic first. I also added basil and chives (chives because I didn't have enough onions) from the garden. Added a few dashes of cayenne pepper as suggested. Cut down the sugar to about 1.5 T, even with the recipe trippled. The color of my soup was more orange than red as I had many different varities of tomatoes and specked with green. It was a delicious! Especially with a little parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. This was my first time making my own tomato soup and this recipe was a great base! Thanks!

Awesome recipe. I tripled the recipe (had lots of garden tomatoes) Sauteed the onions, then sauteed 3 cloves of garlic with onion. Added bay leaves to tomatoes and homemade broth.  I used a hand blender and used a 2 strainers to get the pulp out of the soup. Added two pinches of ground thyme to roux. Added about 4 TBSP more of flour. I only enhanced the flavors of this recipe.  Great base for me to mess with...Husband liked it.  Older kids liked it.  Thank you! thank you!  Reminded me of soup served to me at a delicatessen in town...comforting, filling, healthy slow food...mmm.  Serve with crusty or fresh baked buttered bread!

Excellent recipe.  I will say that I had to change a few things (lacking fresh tomatoes), I used a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes in lieu of 4 cups of fresh tomatoes.  They are pretty much the same amount.    For the seasonings I added celery salt, salt, sugar, small amount of basil, ground cloves, and ground nutmeg.  It was all prepared just as the recipe said, roux and all.  Grilled cheese always goes well with tomato soup--a little trick I like to throw in is to use more than one kind of cheese, and also throw in some dried thyme for some extra flavor.  All things combined, dinner tonight left me in an extremely good mood :)

very good!  I didn't have an onion, so I used onion powder.  I also added fresh basil.  I blanched, peeled, and seeded the tomatoes before cooking, then put it all through the blender at the end because I didn't have a food mill.  A bit labor intensive, but worth it!

I just finish eating a great big bowl of this and just LOVED it. I miss read the ingredient and used garlic cloves instead of whole gloves but this was not a bad thing. I started with boiling the tomatoes a few seconds to remove the skin which helped eliminate straining at the end. When the soup was ready I added rice and milk to it to make it more filling and it was just so wonderful. I will be making this again and again. I will also be using this tomato soup recipe when I make my chili which usually calls for 2-3 cans tomato soup. Mmmmm yummy!!!!

This soup was delicious!  I did follow a user's review and did the following: I doubled the recipe otherwise it makes very little and I like leftovers! Sauteed 4 garlic cloves in olive oil, added a large chopped onion, then added 6 cups of garden fresh tomatoes, must be sweet and ripe, I think I will add some fresh chopped basil next time, when it finished cooking I added 1 cup of cream and heated it through the soup, I didn't use a food mil to puree it, instead I used and immersion blender.  It was great!

I had a lot of tomatoes from the garden that my husband wanted me to freeze, however we still have the tomatoes from last summer, so I had other plans for them.  Since I had 6 kids hungry kids here, I decided to make grilled cheese, which most refuse to eat unless there is a bowl of tomato soup along side.  Only 1 kid didn't like it.  Will make again, too bad for the one that didn't like it.

This recipe produces a decent tomato soup.  I added some basil to the boiling tomatoes.  The finished product was still not silky enough so I blended it in a blender.  It took on the texture of silk.  So amazing.  As far as tomato soups go, I would give this a 4.  It comes out pumpkin-orange in color, though.  Not the vibrant red you see in the photograph.

This was terrific!  The only changes I made were to omit the cloves and added 1/4 tsp. of cayenne pepper. Thanks for the recipe!

This is great soup! Suspicious at first looking at the recipe because the ingredients seem too few, but it turns out such delicious one. definitely comforting. Only, I cut butter to 1TS.

Delicious!  I used a jar of home-canned tomatoes instead of fresh, omitted the cloves & added garlic.  I usually like to try recipes before I make extra, in this case like another reviewer, I wish I had doubled or tripled the recipe.  We enjoyed it with a little chopped fresh basil and parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.

Just got done with dinner, and this soup was great.. I was never tomato soup (can) person, and never really had it homemade. Love it..
I did take a reviewers advise and added saute'd garlic and onion. In the end it did seem a little light on flavor so I added some balsamic vinegar and a touch of cayenne pepper, made it just pop in flavor.
Thinking Ill take the leftovers and add some veggies and maybe some tiny pasta for a bit of variety. 
I also did double the recipe.
Great use of fresh tomatoes. will certainly keep this recipe around!!!!

thanks

This is spectacular! I also didn't have cloves on hand so I added in a few sprinkles of ground clove and used 4 cloves slit in half. I can't believe the flavor! It is September and homemade soup will now be a staple! No more store bought soup for us! YUMMMM

Thought I'd share my take on this, the best tomato soup on the planet.  I do the tomatoes first, and run through the food mill.  Then I add sauteed onions, like 1/2 onion for 8 tomatoes, and garlic and lots of chopped mushrooms.  Instead of cloves I use thyme because we have it.  Simmer for a time and chop it up with an in-the-pot blender.  Cream is optional and 1/2 stick butter is good, too.  In tomato season we always have this, 1/2 gallon at a time - my wife just sucks it down like candy.

This tomato soup is awesome! I added two large cloves of garlic and some black pepper and it was great! I had to substitute the chicken broth with beef broth because I was out and it turned out fine. Thanks for the great recipe!!

This recipe was the best I found for tomato soup.  We have an extensive herb garden, so I added basil, Lovage (adds a celery flavor), oregano, chives, and parsley.  I also added chopped garlic.  I don't have a food mill, so I used a food processor and then through a strainer.  I have made this recipe several times and will continue to use it!

Absolutely the best, better than any soup in a can!  I have been making this recipe for several years.  We are always bombarded with tomatoes, so I can it so we can eat it year-round.  The whole cloves give the soup just the right flavor.  (The cloves in the recipe refer to the spice, not garlic cloves).  Why would you put garlic in tomato soup?
Thanks for a great recipe.

I think I created a lot more work for myself just because I don't have a food mill.  I blanched (peeled) and seeded the tomatoes before starting. I followed others' recommendations and sauteed garlic with onions before adding the tomatoes and homemade chicken broth (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chicken-Broth-in-a-Slow-Cooker/Detail.aspx).  After using my submersible blender, I tasted it.  It seemed like it needed something, so I took more reviewers' suggestions and added oregano, thyme and garlic powder.  A lot of work and not as spectacular as I had hoped, but still good.  I probably won't make this again.  Thanks anyways =)

I was craving tomato soup and found this to be a great starting point.  I used canned whole tomatoes with basil instead of fresh tomatoes because the tomatoes at the store weren't looking too great.  I also misread the directions and added 4 cloves or garlic instead of whole cloves.  It was a good mistake in my opinion.  I ended up taking two out before I food processed it so it wouldn't be too strong.  I also added a dash of ground cloves, oregano, and basil.  After food processing it I added 3/4 cup of half and half.  It was delicious and will definitely be a staple in our house.

A good, basic tomato soup recipe that I closely resembles my mom's. I assumed the cloves to be cloves of garlic, and 4 cloves (while more than i would usually add) were not too overpowering. I skip the roux and thicken the soup with a dash of cream instead. I also add a small splash of balsamic vinegar for added sweetness, some dried oregano at the beginning and top with fresh parsley before serving.

Very good. Made adjustments. Prepared the roux in a seperate pot and added 3/4 cup of milk to it. Then slowly added some of the tomato mixture to the roux, then combined everything into one pot and cooked. It was very creamy. Also, did not use strainer, too fussy for me. I thought it was very good with all the tomato bits in the soup. Have tried the soup in its original recipe and that was very good as well. Thanks

This is a delicious, easily made soup.It was surprising to learn how many people do not know what a food mill is. I use one, but sometimes just put the soup through the blender, strain it or not, depending upon how lazy and/or "seedy" I feel that day. I'm such a purist that I always follow the recipe the fist time - if you add this, substitute that you're  not making that recipe.

I would have liked to give this 5 stars, but there were 2 problems.  One is that I don't have a food mill (I had to look-up what one was!) Would that have removed most of the seeds? Secondly, there was not much, "umph" to it.  I added a bay leaf, white pepper, garlic and a dash or two of cayenne in the boil/simmer step. Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  The recipe did call for "season to taste," so if I could, I would give it 4 1/2 stars. I might have to look into purchasing a food mill.  Do others find this useful?

I did not have a food mill, so I put mine in the blender--it worked!  Then strained it for a smoother texture.  Excellent soup!

I'm not a big fan of straight tomatoes, so this soup was just too much tomato for me. Very easy, though, and I can see why others would like it.

Very fresh taste.  My husband loved it.  I did use half an onion instead of only one onion slice and substituted whole allspice for the whole cloves because that's what I had on hand.  Easy to make; I'll definitely make again.  A good way to use up extra garden tomatoes that would otherwise go to waste.

I made this two times in the past week.  The first time I didn't have a food mill, so I took advise from another review and peeled the tomatoes first then used a blender after they boiled.  I didn't change any ingredient other than I put a bay leaf in while it boiled.  This was WONDERFUL cooked this way.  The second time I made it, I tripled the recipe and went with other's advise to add spices and I also bought a food mill.  I liked the first batch better.  More consistancy in the soup without the food mill and I think better flavor without all the extra spices.  Very nice recipe that I will continue to use!  Thank you!

This is a fabulous base recipe!  I added several crushed garlic cloves, fresh basil and dried oregano for extra flavor, and I also pureed all of the solids in the blender and added them back to the soup (didn't want to waste all those good tomatoes!)  I tripled the recipe and ended up with about 14 one-cup servings.  DELICIOUS! I will definitely make this one over and over!

Without changing any ingredients this is the BEST recipe for tomato soup I've ever had.  It's quick, fresh tasting, and the cloves give it a hint of je ne sais quoi.  A definite keeper!

Absolutely out of this world!!  This is fantastic tomato soup.  I grow tons of tomatoes in my garden every summer and when I can them, I use my sauce instead of the fresh and it turns out just as good and quicker!!

Oh.  So that's what tomato soup is supposed to taste like.  Delicious!!!!  I stuck to the stated ingredients, but assembled them differently.  I roasted fresh tomatoes (from my garden) cut in quarters with thick onion slices, whole garlic cloves, olive oil, and salt-n-pepper at 425 degrees for 30 minutes.  After that cooled a little, I ran it through the food processor (I kept it a titch chunky).  I made the roux (added the chicken broth to the roux), then poured the pureed tomato mixture into the roux.  Simmered it a little while, and geez louise... it was fabulous.  Served it with grown-up grilled cheese (two cheeses of choice on sliced pugliese bread cooked to perfection in butter), and it was party on.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

I just made this for my family and let me tell you........it is SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!! I wanted to give it a fair trial, so I followed the recipe to the letter with 2 exceptions: I added the salt and sugar in small batches, testing after each addition. For our tastea, it only needed half the salt and sugar the recipe called for. I used salted butter (all I had) to make the roux, which could account for it. I also added a little black pepper at the end because that's how my kids like it! I can honestly say that I have no intention of EVER buying canned tomato soup again!!!

P.S. The cloves set it off beautifully!!

Fantastic! Doubling the recipe is a must:)...I may triple it next time just to have plenty of leftovers! Everyone has their own tastes and you can keep the recipe as is or you can switch a bit to flavors you know you like best...and that's what I did. I didn't change much, but I did sauté minced garlic in a bit of olive oil to start. I used green onions instead of onions (just not a fan!). I pureed the soup in a blender (though only a little at a time so as not to cause a mess!). And I cut down on the sugar, and added pepper, basil and oregano for my own taste. It's a fantastic soup!

I have made this 3 times now. I always follow the basic recipe but I never make the roux to thicken it as I have been freezing this for this winter. A little cream and butter when reheating is a delicious addition to this fresh tasting soup. This is now, my go to recipe to use up our summer bounty of heirloom tomatoes.

So good. I followed the instructions, except added 3 cloves of fresh garlic and some pepper. Otherwise, just stayed with the original recipe. This was so tasty. I didn't have a mill or imersion blender so I put it in a food processor. Will definately make it again. This recipe made 5 bowls.

This was DELICIOUS and incredibly easy!  
I did add sautéed garlic and fresh basil (to suit my taste) and used an emersion blender in lieu of a food mill (I don't own one).  My husband already can't wait for me to make it again!

Delicious just as it is on a chilly early fall day! Followed the recipe, except for putting through a food mill. I don't really like totally 'smooth' soups, so I just used my submersible blender in the tomato mixture before adding to the roux and that gave it a nice, slightly chunky texture which I prefer. I can't imagine not using the cloves either, as another reviewer stated - gave it a wonderful, earthy taste that shouldn't be missed.

Made this recipe to a tee.  Soup is not my specialty as a matter of fact i am horrible at it.  But i had fresh grown tomatoes from my garden and was looking for anything to use them up.  It was so easy and it was the first soup recipe that came out perfectly.  So delicious. I loved it so much that i made a second batch for my sister.  Made grilled cheese to dunk and it was perfect

No doubt someone will think this is a stupid question but here it is.  I made this recipe, it was great.  I used garlic (which I minced).  However I went back to read reviews out of curiosity and thought it looked like some of you used baking cloves as opposed to garlic cloves?  Maybe I've been in the kitchen too long? LOL

I have tons of tomatoes from my garden and needed a way to use them up. I was browsing for tomato recipes while drunk last night and accidentally wrote down 2 cups of tomatoes instead of 4. I just realized that now, after having made the recipe and coming back to review it.

Anyway, despite me only putting in 2 cups of tomatoes, it is seriously good and really simple. I look forward to making this again, but with the correct proportions next time.

It was ok....but way too over powering with the cloves....And I only used 2. Had to add more tomatoes and a bit of cream to make it edible.

I left out the roux and added a potato for thickness (am trying to cut down on dairy and wheat) and left out the sugar as it didn't need it, and it was delicious! I made it for my boo and then froze the rest and gave some to my mother who loved it too.

Very tasty. We didn't have any chicken stock so I used beef instead and we were right out of onions so I fried up some apples to give them that sour/sweet flavour you get from onions. As I went to fetch the tomatoes a squall of hungry cats elbowed me out of the way and I was forced to use what was left in the fridge - some old garlic, a handful of oyster mushrooms and some limberger cheese. 
Plunged into darkness as the result of a severe thunderstorm I order our lodger to mash all of the remaining ingredients with his bare feet and then cooked it all up in an old tin can over several candles.
We ate it by candlelight and accompanied ourselves on the marimba.
Highly reccomended!

I had a lot of tomatoes from the garden this year, and this was a great way to use them up.I peeled them first, and used twice as much garlic, sauteed garlic and onion in a couple tablespoons of olive oil.I had fresh basil and oregano, so I added about 2 T total. I added about 2 T of tarragon vinegar and 1/4 t cayenne pepper, also put the cloves in a tea ball so they would be easier to retrieve. Used an immersion blender and left the mixture chunky, like a bisque. I topped the bowls with grated Parmesan and a drizzle more olive oil. With grilled cheese, the ultimate yummy lunch!

Delicious. For my second batch I left out the cloves and sauteed the onions with garilic, basil and thyme.  I strained this batch through a strainer to get the tomato skins out.  Yummy.

This is a fantastic tomato soup recipe.  I made it according to the recipe and my husband said it was the best tomato soup he has ever had.  I loved it, too!  It is special enough to serve to guests for lunch.  I will probably make gallons of it from my garden tomatoes to freeze for winter.  I'm always happy to find another recipe to use up the seemingly endless supply of tomatoes from my garden that we will actually end up eating!  Thank you for a great recipe!

This is my very first review!  I made this soup this evening using 5 bags of frozen tomatoes!  No cloves so I used garlic.  I didn't measure anything.  Toasted some of my fresh sourdough bread and dropped it in the bowl with a dollop of sour cream.  My goodness!  I will definitely make this soup over and over again.  (I just used my mixer to blend tomatoes and onions-a little messy, but it worked.  I did not strain-I left all the pieces in the pot.  Delicious recipe!

I love this recipe...the taste is sooo good, the time to make is awesome and the amount is perfect.
I have added other spices but always go back to the basic recipe. The last time I made it I used some
Turkey broth from Thanksgiving ... it was delish!  Everyone I have served this Fab soup to have loved it!
Thanks Charlotte.

This soup is amazing!  I have made it twice and have tried to follow the directions closely.  I do not have a food mill.  I strain the cooked tomato mixture using a chinois, squeezing out as much liquid as possible.  I then discard what is left.  I do not believe that this mixture was meant to be pureed.

Excellent Basic Recipe!!! I tweaked it a bit, however, after reading many reviews.  I did saute one small chopped onion along with 3-4 garlic cloves before adding 5 cups of tomatoes that I had previously blanched for 30 seconds in hot water and immediately bathed them in ice in order to skin them, and then de-seeded/de-membraned the tomatoes.  After I added 3-4 cups of broth, I boiled for 20 then cooled, added 2 tablespoons of basil ribbons and blended till smooth.  I used 4 tablespoons each of butter and flour for the roux, used less salt, more pepper, and after the roux was made I added about 1/2 a pint of heavy cream to it.  Then I added the tomatoes, and a pinch or 2 of clove powder.  My man said that was the BEST tomato soup he had ever had in his life.  He told me about 10 times!!! Serve with sourdough grilled cheese and salad....  Heaven!

I have gotten great reviews on this recipe from my co-workers, friends, and family.  I cook with a lot of garlic usually so I didn't add any as suggested by some reviewers.  I think it's great as is.

It tasted very good.  Other than the typo in the recipe (slice rather than sliced onion) this was great.  It is easy and using the stick blender rather than the food mill made it even easier.  Don't rely on the servings number unless you consider 1/2 cup to be a serving.

Very good.  Doubled the recipe.  Added 1/2 cup milk, as I like a creamier soup, plus a little balsamic vinegar and dried basil at the end, as suggested by other reviewers.  I think I may cut back on the salt just a bit next time.

Best tomato soup recipe I've found so far and we love it.  Didn't have enough tomatoes to make 4 cups so used one can of diced tomatoes to make up the difference.  This has become my go-to recipe for tomato soup.

I was in Niagara region and bought some freshly picked Tomatoes and made this soup last night. It was a winner with the entire family.  Easy to make, I added 2 oz of gin which gave it a nice flavour but not overwhelming.  Will give it a try again soon.

This is quite delicious. If you don't care for cloves (I thought it was a yummy, surprising twist and loved it!), then simply leave it out and add basil and a bit of freshly ground black pepper instead. Super delicious this way too!
I did change things up a bit when making the soup. I sauteed the onions and garlic in a bit of olive oil before adding the rest of the ingredients. It really helps to bring out their flavors and adds a deeper taste dimension to this soup.

This is a great soup, I spiced up with fresh basil and a couple of fresh cayene peppers plus I used cherry tomatos and roma tomatoes since I have so many in my vegetable and herb garden.
thanks Charlotte.

We grow our own roma tomatoes and I have used this recipe for several years.  It is very good.  My family doesn't like cloves so I just skip them.  Have made it from canned tomatoes and it is good but not as good as out of our garden.  We triple the amount and eat plenty.

This is a great base recipe. I always double or triple it, omit the cloves, and add seasonings to my taste (thyme, basil, garlic, cayenne, bay leaf..). I like to let the soup cool a bit and add cream. Excellent with grilled cheese!

Wonderful recipe!  I fixed it exactly as the recipe read and DH said it was better than Campbell's which is a huge compliment coming from my picky eater.  I am a fan of cayenne pepper and sprinkled some in my own  bowl when serving.  This recipe is a keeper and I will make it again and again.

We love this recipe!  Used it for the first time last year.  My wife is the picky eater in our family and she loved it!  This year, I twice made 4X the recipe and froze it for use throughout the year.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and added some hot sauce.   If you don't try this, you are missing out!

Pretty good soup. It's a great way for me to use my garden tomatoes. I used a blender and then held a colander over the pan as I pour it back into the pan. It didn't get every thing out, but most of it. It was fine with a little bit of texture.

This is an amazing recipe! It is very forgiving if I don't have all ingredients on hand and still is always delicious. I like to serve it with grilled cheese sandwiches.

This was so good. I wasn't sure about putting cloves in tomato soup but it turned out delicious. I added a little more sugar to cut out the bitterness and it was perfect!

This soup is SO YUMMY!  Very easy to make and much better than the canned stuff.

I added in a heaping tablespoon of tomato paste right after the roux.

Awesome! Increased this for 18 servings. Used can of crushed tomatoes (6lb 6oz) and can of chicken broth (3lb, 1.5 oz), 2 onions, 8 cloves garlic, 2 Tbs sugar, 2 Tbs balsalmic vinegar, 1 Tbs salt, 1 Tbs oregano. 1/4 cup and 2 Tbs butter adn same amount of flour. Ran it through the food mill and my toddlers gobbled it. We'll see how everyone else likes it tomorrow.

Used 4 14.5 oz cans of diced, italian seasoned tomatoes, rather than fresh, and blended everything smooth, but followed the rest of this recipe exactly.  It turned out absolutely fantastic!  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!!  Perfect cold weather soup.  Thank you for sharing this!

Delicious! I'm a "starting out" cook and this was easy enough for me to handle... I'm a vegetarian, so I used veggie broth instead of chicken and it worked out just fine. I also added some garlic with the onion at the beginning and threw in some basil at the end. I didn't add the sugar but I'm sure it would have been great with that included. Threw a grilled cheese sandwich into my George Foreman grill, and BAM, a delicious Sunday afternoon meal :)

This was the best tomato soup ever but it MUST be made with fresh garden tomatoes.  A couple of changes I made was that I added no sugar and I sprinkled some fresh chopped parsley on top.

Very easy and tasty!  I used a handheld submersion blender to make it nice and smooth.  I opted to add some Italian seasoning for a little more flavor, and I used gluten free flour and dairy free margarine.  Now hubby can enjoy it too!

Good soup, it was my first time making tomato soup, even though I have wanted to for years. The recipe was very easy especially since I had tomatoes that needed to be used quickly. I even mixed different types of tomatoes so they will not go bad. This is a quick simple recipe I will not hesitate to make last minute.

This was pretty good. I did add some basil and a little milk in the end. Ran it through a blender as I do not have a food mill. I think I'll still look for another recipe. Not exactly what I was looking for , but good.

I just made this soup, and it was absolutely delicious. I generally followed the recipe as written, but I chopped the onion and garlic and used vegetable stock instead. I also added some half & half at the end, but I don't think that was necessary. I didn't feel the need to add any additional spices, as I really enjoyed the flavor of the tomato and garlic. Would definitely make again.

OMG, this is SO good!  I love tomato soup and using home grown tomatoes in this is awesome.  So easy too.  It's a great way to use up a bunch of tomatoes from the garden.

Delicious ! Followed some of the suggestions i.e. skipped food mill & used immersion blender, also threw in some extra spices.

I couldn't figure out why this tasted so strange... then I remembered I had used cloves with it.  Do not put cloves in if you make this soup.  I wasted 4 huge, perfect tomatoes on this soup.  I may try to make it again, withOUT the cloves and I think I will remove the skin from the tomatoes as well.

Other than adding a half a cup of milk at the end, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully. I don't own a food mill, so I seeded the tomatoes before I chopped them up and ran everything through a food processor instead.

Great recipe.  Easy to make.  I assumed that the 4 whole cloves meant garlic and it was just right.  I also added a bay leaf and some other seasonings.  I will definitely make this again and probably triple the recipe so we can have left overs!!

We just now finished this soup and it was excellent!  I did have to make a few changes due to what I had available and personal preferences.  I used dehydrated onion flake instead of fresh onion (2 TBSP),  and added 2 TSP dehydrated minced garlic as well as 1 - 2 TSP Balsamic Vinegar just to kick up the flavor a bit.  If everyone likes spicy food, then I add 2 TSP red pepper flake, but if not, then I just add a dash of Chipotle Tabasco and a dash of Frank's Red Hot to taste per bowl.  I add everything to the blender after cooking and puree for 2 minutes before proceeding with the directions for the roux.  To die for!!!

This has become a staple at my house. I always double the recipe – it’s just not enough for us for a couple of meals. If your tomatoes are not perfect red or it’s off season, I suggest adding a few tablespoons of tomato paste to add the color.    The soup is great as is, but I have experimented adding other things I had on hand e.g. chopped celery root, celery stalk etc … I never run this thru the food mill. I just take a hand blender and blend the whole thing in the pot  (take out the cloves before). Why get rid of all the fiber? – it’s good for you.  The soup is very good and quick to make – highly recommend it!

Awesome!  But, I made adjustments for my situation: having a bountiful tomato garden this year and too many canned tomatoes!  I used 1 Quart canned tomatoes instead of the fresh.  And, I also cooked 1 cup rice seperately and added to the soup at the end....yummy!  Thanks for posting your lovely recipe.

I've made this recipe so many times now that I could probably make it form memory. Two things, I don't like cloves, so I always substitute rosemary. One review said to be stingy with the salt, and I agree. I also don't use a foodmill, since I had never even heard of one before this recipe. My father-in-law grew a lot of tomatoes this year, so when I can a bunch of this soup, I'll be sure to come back and review how successful that was.

I'm really sorry but I didn't like this at all, I don't know if it was something that I did or didn't do but it didn't taste good at all, or at least not what I expected.  I will use this to make goolish or something but not to just eat as soup.  I was very disappointed.

This is a family favorite but I keep on forgetting to rate it.  I've made this countless times.  The recipe is perfect as is, especially when we get fresh tomatoes from our garden.  I've recently started adding things to it by adding a handful of tiny pasta shells/bows and/or veggies like corn, green beans chopped, etc.  So good!! Thank you so much for this recipe Charlotte.

I don't like tomato soup, but this changed my mind. My husband (who doesn't like canned soup) enjoyed it. My sons love a good ole can of tomato soup and they have me 2 thumb up on this one. The only thing I did diffrent was to add a little garlic and when I made my rue I added some milk. I will make again and again.

Wow - this was great! I like to make the recipe as-is, but I usually have to make do with what I have, and since I like using up perishables, there are some modifications to my recipe. For tomatoes I used 2 Cento brand Peeled Whole Italian (28oz, like another reviewer's version). I sauteed the onion with garlic and some celery in olive oil (aromatics ftw) first. I also added some sour cream at the end. The cloves I was suspicious about, but it turned out to be a good addition - maybe better as a bouquet in the pot with some other herbs since I don't have a food mill. I blended only half of the soup to give it a more chunky texture, which we like.

Delicious soup and very simple to make.  I used the recipe as it is written, except using a food processor to pulverize the tomato mixture..  Be sure to remove the whole cloves before putting the tomatoes in the food processor.  I did not do this and spent several minutes dipping out the particles of cloves.

This was so easy and so much much better than any canned tomato soup I have ever had.  We don't buy the canned stuff anymore.

I probably should not post a rating to this since I had a cold when I ate it so my taste buds may have been a little off. I was looking for an easy, tasty, low fat soup that I had all ingriedients for on hand. This looked very easy and it was very easy. I pureed 3/4 of the mix to make the soup a bit thicker and I also added some basil and lite sour cream since I was out of cream. This soup was good, but I do prefer a tomato base (tomato juice) rather than broth.

My daughter & best friend LOVE tomato soup & was asked to make this again plan. I parboiled & removed the skins, I had nice meaty tomato so I did not worry about seeds. I used 7 tomatoes, fresh garlic onion, sugar, basil, cracked pepper with a pinch of white pepper, I also made the rue.
Add a dollup of sour cream & delish! 
I'd like to play around with this some more ;)

Living in China, it is impossible to find the old stand-by canned tomato soup.  When the cold weather hit, I was wanting my tomato soup... so it was allrecipes.com to the rescue!  Mmm! Mmm! GOOD!!  This was delicious!  Only problem... it was gone too quickly!  Will definitely double or triple the recipe next time!  Thanks!!!

This soup is wonderful, but I made a couple changes. I substituted 4 garlic cloves for the four whole cloves. I added red pepper flakes and italian seasoning.

This soup was wonderful!  Very light and delicious. I am curious about the onion.  Is it one onion sliced or one slice of onion?  That could be why some thought it was "bland".  I chose one sweet onion sliced and one clove of garlic minced. It was really super!

Thick creamy and delicious! I didn't have any whole cloves so just put in a few spoonfuls of ground cloves. With the reviewers help this turned out so nice and spicy. I loved the garlic, cayenne ,and balsamic vinegar added also. Thanks for the solution to use up all these fresh tomatoes. I plan to freeze up batches of this .I hope it freezes ok. Absolutely love this soup! Thanks Charlotte!

Yum!  A great, easy way to use up excess tomatoes.  I unfortunately don't have a food mill, so I peeled and seeded them first, then ran the soup through the blender prior to thickening.  Used an extra 1/4 tsp of salt due to sodium free chicken broth and added one tbsp. of tomato paste for some extra oomph.  This is good, inexpensive, and good for you.  The only negative is that it spoils you for the canned kind!

This soup is very tasty. I had enough fresh tomatoes that I tripled the recipe so that I could can some. I also added the garlic cloves (per other reviews) and blended the ingredients in a blender to make it creamier.

This soup is amazing!! Thank you for the recipe.  I grew up loving Campbell's because I don't like chunks of tomatoes in any of my food.  I made this soup for my husband and we had grilled cheese sandwiches with it - perfect!

I took other reviewers' suggestions and doubled the recipe so that I had enough after straining the soup (I used 10 tomatoes).  I ended up with 4-5 large bowls - perfect.

I used vegetable broth instead of chicken. I skipped the cloves and added 4 cloves of garlic instead.  I used probably 1/3 of a large white onion, as well. I added fresh basil at the end - delicious!

My tip for blending/straining (for those w/ out a food mill):
Cook tomatoes, onions, and broth in a large pot as directed.  Use a stick blender to make smooth.  In another pot, start your roux (I doubled it and added dried basil and black pepper to it).  Pour the blended soup through a sieve into the pot w/ the roux.  I let it simmer about 20-30 minutes on low (as I prepared the sandwiches).

My husband thought it was a little too acidic - but I'm sure I could have added more sugar to remedy that.  I thought it tasted perfect.
Thanks again!

This soup by far was the best I have ever tasted. My husband was blown away by it's flavor.  He said, "the delicate flavors were the best he had ever experienced".  This is from a man who has eaten at many top restaurants around the world.  Well, got to go make another batch!!!

Thank you for the posting.  I made one batch with the garden tomatoes and I was amazed it was so good.  Then I made a double batch with my cherry tomatoes, again it turned out great, so then I used my yellow pear tomatoes. Wow fantastic.  And hear I was asking people to take my tomatoes cause I had so many. I will can the soup, and enjoy all year.  Thank you for the great posting.

Excellent. I have made it as is and tried other reviews suggestions with basil and garlic. We love it either way. This a great recipe to use up all of our garden tomatoes. I am freezing many containers full and hope to enjoy all winter long.

Perfect recipe for those with too many tomatos and no interest in pasta sauce. I added the basil and garlic as suggested and omitted the cloves. I don't have a food mill so I just used a large strainer and spatchula.

The soup was great, I did change a few things. I rosted the garlic with a chopped red pepper in the oven for 30 minutes before adding them to the soup I also added a cup of milk, 1/8 teaspoon peprika and an 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper. I also used the blender to make it smooth before adding it to the roux. This is a great way to use all my garden tomatoes and my boyfriend even had seconds and he's really fussy.

Much better than the stuff from the can!! I liked the nice redness to it, and the flavours blended well. Delicious served with the simple grilled cheese sandwich. For those more adventurous, and since we're garlic lovers here, try doubling the amount of garlic, or even putting a bit of chicken bouillion in there too :)

I just made this and it was wonderful  -- and so easy!  I used a bunch of romas and 4 vine-ripes that on-hand.  I didn't use cloves, instead I used 1 1/2 tsp of crushed garlic.  Also used half an onion cut into slices.  I don't have a food mill, so blended everything in my blender along with about 6 large fresh basil leaves.  I also eliminated the sugar, but added a couple pinches of kosher salt at the end.  I wish I'd made a double-batch.  It didn't make as much as I thought it would.  Next time I'm going to add some cilantro when I blend.  A keeper!

Great soup - easy to increase the amount, too.  I used fresh tomatoes from my garden to make a double batch.  I also used my blender instead of a food mill - even ground up the cloves!  I'm amking this again today, with a little less clove and a little less butter.

One of the reasons that this is the best website is because of the honest reviews. Because of all of the positive reviews, I chose to stick closely to the original recipe. I was going to nix the sugar and the cloves, but as one reviewer said, the cloves made the soup. I adjusted the sugar amount as another reviewer mentioned and I used ground cloves since I didn't have whole. My husband had brought home a bucket of extremely ripe tomatoes that had to be used immediately. So I made this soup (first time I've ever made any soup of this kind). This soup was perfect for every type of tastebud. My biggest surprise was when my youngest son "loved" the soup.  I had stirred a little catsup in his bowl and he devoured this nutritious soup.  Thanks for all of the helpful tips and a delicious soup.

This was great!  So many people had made changes to the recipe that I decided to make it as written and was very pleased.  I was worried about the cloves but they gave the recipe depth.  This is old fashioned tomato soup! Great with grilled cheese!

My husband likes Progresso Hearty Tomato soup, but hates the regular Campbell's so I decided to try to make something similar at home. This recipe was a great starting point, but I did add some dried Italian seasoning, a little minced garlic, a touch of crushed red pepper and some cumin during the simmering phase. Also, I fell asleep so the simmering phase lasted way more than 20 minutes, but there was no harm done.
I ran the entire double batch of the soup through the blender, but then it looked a lot like the Campbells, so I added a large can of diced tomatoes for texture. Next time I will reserve some of the chunky tomatoes to add back to the blended soup.
Our grocer bags up several pounds of the riper/bruised tomatoes and sells them for $.50 per bag to get rid of them quickly, and these were the ideal tomatoes for this soup. I used about 10 - 12 cups of chopped tomatoes (which cost me $1) and doubled the rest of the ingredients. I froze half.
I have to say, my husband was thrilled by this soup. This soup, along with a green salad, made for a satisfying and healthy dinner.

This soup was sooo good!  I made a pot yesterday, it was a rainy day, and ate a bowl every couple of hours, I couldn't stay out of it!  Today it is gone so I'm gonna make another batch with some tomatos out of my garden.  I too was confused over the "slice of onion" and added a whole sliced onion, it was really yummy with tiny onion bits, and since I didn't have any cloves I omited that, might be even better with?  Then at the end I added black pepper to my taste and a cup of heavy cream stirred in for "cream of tomato."  This was like I remember tomato soup from when I was a kid, except fresher.  I did make a few changes, but I always do that, this would be good as is or with a personalised touch.  Thanks for this fresh, yummy and very easy recipe.

I followed some of the suggestions to gussy up this soup with garlic and herbs, as well as to assume that onion slice meant a sliced onion.  Overall it was good tomato soup, zesty.  But I wouldn't call it great.

I can't wait until summer every year to make this recipe. It's so good. I would disagree, though, that it makes 6 servings...more like 4 small servings, so if you're cooking for a crowd, you might want to double the recipe. I never would have thought to add cloves to tomato soup, but it gives it just the right flavor. If you don't have a food mill, I've put it in a blender then through a strainer, and that worked fine.

This is delicious.  I, too, added garlic and basil with good results.  Rave family reviews!
One caveat - I don't think I'm particularly slow, but it took me longer than the stated 5 minute prep time.

Delicious recipe! I made a big batch and froze the soup for many delicious meals this coming winter. I used Roma tomatoes from my garden for the soup. Enjoy!

Never again could I eat canned tomato soup after this! It was great. I omitted the onion because of an allergy and it was still fantastic. I also  quadrupled the recipe and canned it. I was looking for some interesting ways to use up an overabundance of garden tomatoes and this was perfect. Will definetly make again!

This was delicious and good way to use up tomatoes from my garden. My Husband loved it -by far  this is better than can tomato soup!! I think mine was more like a bisque. I follow everyone added hints to this recipe and added  3  garlic cloves minced,1/2 t.each of cayenne pepper& oregano..a bay leaf(removed at end of cooking),1 t.each thyme& basil. I used a blender to purred the mixture after cooking it  and  put it  thru a food mill. I cooked it longer,so a  thicker soup in end result & I added about 1/2 cup  non fat creamer --perfect! Will make again for sure even if I use canned tomatoes. thanks for posting this  recipe!

Move over Campbells!!  I had tried a different tomato soup recipe before and felt it was lacking.  This soup is creamy and just rich enough.  I did puree the tomato mixture before adding it to the creamy roux.  Very easy to make overall & I look forward to making it again the next time I have a bunch of tomatoes from my garden.

Yummy! I basically made it for my husband, the tomato soup fiend.  I don't even LIKE tomato soup, but this was very tasty!  I would definitely make it again either for adult company, or to freeze in smaller portions for lunches for myself.  The 2 year old wouldn't touch it, but she's not much on trying new things.  The 5 year old ate it and said it was "okay, but I like the stuff in the can better."  Thanks for the recipe, Charlotte!

I made this recipe exactly as written TWICE because I thought I had screwed it up some how the first time. I’m a huge tomato soup lover and I found this recipe way too acidic. I’m shocked people can eat this “as is”. It’ll put hair on your chest!  To save this recipe, I added baking soda to neutralize it and a bit more sugar. Do this until it tastes palatable. There is also a lack of the typical spices you would use in a tomato soup recipe. I added garlic, basil, and for some zing I added a little bit of dried roasted red pepper flakes. I had to add an extra cup of stock and even used about 1/2 cup of half and half cream (pre warmed). I also added some pepper as well. Even though I rescued this recipe so my family could eat it, it still wasn’t as good as it could have been. I’ve never used cloves in a tomato soup recipe and as much as I love cloves, I think this ruined the flavour. I won’t be making this one again sorry. :(

It was excellent! I made it as written, and added a little basil when I immersion blended it.  (No food mill).  The only problem was that it didn't make very much.  I used a little more than 4 cups chopped fresh on the vine tomatoes, and there was barely enough soup for two reasonable bowls.  Next time I at least double the recipe..

Made it Vegetarian! Substituted the 4 cups of chicken broth with 6 cups of vege broth. Also add more tomatoes than recipe calls for. Fabulous! Addicted. It doesn't make a lot so recommend doubling! Enjoy!

To die for! I don't think I can ever eat store the bought sodium nightmare they call "soup" again.  

Doubled the recipe, used 4t bouilloun paste and 3.5 cups water. 

Don't have a food mill, so used my stick blender and then strained. This gives great texture with some seeds, but not enough to be annoying.  Next time I will remember to pull the cloves out first.

Made this last night and doubled it.Only used 1 teaspoon of sugar and only 1 clove.It was delicious and no left overs :)

Made this a second time and added diced carrots and celery and bok choy and used fresh,chopped tomatoes. I didn't add milk and I didn't blend it,we like it a little chunky .Fabulous again!

Love this recipe!  I use this recipe in mid to late summer when my garden Roma tomatoes start piling up.  I do not own a food mill, so I use a food processor to chop/puree the tomatoes and onions prior to boiling, and pull out the whole cloves after boiling.  Simple and tasty!

Edit: Too many ripe tomatoes this summer led to me making a 6x batch of this soup for freezing.  Using a large stock pot, and the food processor method described above.  I had to use a second stock pot to make the roux. I then added a small amount of the tomatoes mixture, as described in the recipe, to eliminate lumps, and then added about half the tomatoes mixture to the roux pot, then transferred all back to the original, larger stock pot. Worked perfect, and then I used homemade bags and vacuum pump on a Food Saver to bag quarts for freezing. It will be a nice addition to have homemade soup from fresh tomatoes all winter!

I made this recipe, but turned it into an almost completely different soup. First of all, I doubled the requirements. I did all the first steps, but strained the mixture into another pot. I then scooped some of the bits of onion and tomato into the new pot to make it slightly chunky, and I added chopped potatoes, carrots and celery. Along with basil. I completely ditched making the paste. It made a GREAT, healthy, low fat tomato broth, especially with the cloves. I also added one small chopped garlic and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Great even in August as I'm writing this, but I can't wait to make it again in the fall.       Over all pretty easy and delicious recipe. Lots of chopping, and goes great with a roasted chicken and buttered wheat bread.

I make EXACTLY as directed (except to double the recipe) and we all just love it. Simplicity in preparing and taste is what makes this recipe. You do not need to read through all the reviews and make all kinds of changes, then you might as well find a different recipe.

I made this soup exactly as directed, yummy, although not as good as the tomatoe soup we had in Rome, very close though.  Easy to make as well.  Sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese on it after serving with some crusty warm bread, grubbin!

Cloves?  Really?  Yup!  This was a very quick and simple recipe.  I made it as-written.  I may slightly prefer another tomato soup recipe from this site but this one rocks for its simplicity.  Great with canned plum tomatoes.

The simplicity of this recipe is beautiful and it tasted amazing. I trusted the few people that said not to change a thing in the previous reviews and they were absolutely right. This with salad and garlic bread on the side made an awesome meal.  It's a keeper.

I'd never made tomato soup before, but other recipes seemed more complicated, or called for ingredients I didn't readily have on hand. I found this one and have made this soup a number of times already, and it is just as quick, simple, and delicious each time! Added basil as a variation and it was fabulous. Thanks so much!

This was delish! Even my kids loved it...or maybe it was the grilled cheese sandwiches that they dipped in it. I know folks say not to change the recipe then rate it, but here I am.  I followed VIVIBO's advice on many things. Based on what I had on hand, I used two 28 oz cans of chopped tomatoes, one large sliced yellow onion, four cloves of garlic, two cups of broth, 1 tsp of sugar, dried basil (I know that's sacrilege, but it was POURING outside!), a dash or two of cayenne, salt and pepper, a dash of balsamic vinegar, approximately a cup of 1/2 n 1/2. I did not make a roux (didn't want to dirty another pan) but made a flour/water slurry instead. I like the idea of the roux, browning the butter and flour always adds a nice depth of flavor, but I was on a time crunch and didn't miss it. Just had the leftovers for lunch today and it was even better the second day. I liked the creaminess the 1/2 n 1/2 added, but could probably leave it out if freezing or watching calories. This is a keeper! Thanks!

We loved it. I added the garlic and onions and balsamic vinegar recommended by another cook who reviewed this recipe. Turned out great. I pealed and chopped my tomatoes. I used a hand blender to puree the soup. I will make It again.

This soup was basically on the right track. However, not exactly what I was looking for. I'd probably leave out the cloves next time. I noticed a lot of people changed the recipe considerably to get it to their liking.

I've used this soup recipe for a couple of years, and we love it. But I do tweak it. I think the key to any top-notch soup is a hearty, homemade chicken broth. I always have some in the freezer, and I have a review for it on this site. I won't make soup without it. I mixed the soup ingredients in my Vita Mix blender even before cooking it. Added basil and crushed red peppers. Careful with the cloves -- I didn't have whole, so used powdered and it doesn't take much to overwhelm the soup. Use a tiny pinch. We add a bit of half and half.  Now I use 2 T. of balsamic, as someone else suggested. Good to the last drop.

This is my second time making this recipe.  My family and I absolutely loved it!  The second time around I doubled the recipe.   I added half of a jalapeño to my bowl to spice it up just a bit.  It's definitely a keeper.

Excellent soup.  Added basil and oregano as suggested by others (fresh as I had these herbs in my garden). Sauted the garlic and onions then tomatoes from my garden. Yum soup!

Oh, my goodness! This was sooo good, and so easy! My husband said this is the best taro soup he's ever had! Don't have a food mill, so I put the tomato-onion stock through a mesh strainer. Added some chopped basil and a little half-and-half at the end. Superb!

Loved it - reviews are terrific with additions to customize soup.  I sauteed carrots, garlic and onions first, added tomatoes and stock.  When all was softened, I ran through blender - no seeds or skins left! Made roux as directed and added heavy cream.  1t. sugar, 1t. cloves, 1T balsamic vinegar.  Served with crumpled bacon on top.  So much fun to play with - basic recipe is great for freezing, when thawing pay around with different additives.  Think I'll add dollop of sour cream, when serving from frozen stash.  Thanks to all reviewers for ideas and for Charlotte's terrific basic soup (and for sharing, everyone!).  If you think you've added too much of any spice, just add more tomatoes.  Great fun to taste and add whatever's missing.  Some day I'm going to read every single one of these reviews!

I LOVED this soup, it was simple to prepare and the fresh tomato flavor was delicious. I had made it previously with the cloves but did not add them this time and thought it much better without that addition. The pure tomato flavor really shines through! I used an immersion blender and it was such a blessing avoiding the mess of transferring  to a standard blender. I added a topping of crème fraiche (yogurt or sour cream would work as well) and some fresh chopped basil. YUM!

We doubled the recipe and made a few changes.  The soup was wonderful!  We didn't add sugar, added fresh basil, and added 8 cloves of garlic.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I substituted veg broth for the chicken broth, but otherwise made it exactly as described.  I'm preparing it a second time now and am not making any additional modifications.  This round I'm actually multiplying the recipe by seven to use up garden tomatoes and to have soup in the freezer for the winter.  My only critique is the portion size as described.  A single batch would only make about 2-3 entree servings in my house.  But what a great, inexpensive, delicious recipe that also makes the house smell great while it is cooking!

Made this last night for dinner. Made some changes as suggested by previous reviewers. I sauteed some garlic in olive oil first, then added the onions and tomatoes. I also added some basil and instead of cream, I added Mocha Mix. (Hubby can't have a lot of dairy, so non-dairy creamer works great as a substitution)We both thought this was fantastic! I brought the leftovers to work today for lunch! :)

Delicious soup!  The fresh tomato taste is wonderful.  I love that there are only a few ingredients, preserves the garden fresh taste of the tomatoes.  I don't have a food mill.  I used my stick blender, but it did not blend the tomato skins very well.  So next time I will peel the tomatoes first.  Thank you Charlotte for sharing this great recipe!

I followed this fairly closely. I used ground cloves, and I thought that was perfect, never would have thought of it myself. The soup was good, but I like creamier tomato soup with basil and garlic better. WARNING: if you blend the soup as shown in the video, you are getting a totally different soup than the original recipe makes. Running it through a food mill takes out all the skins, seeds, and most of the onion, so you just get the tomato juice and pulp with onion flavor. So... BLENDER: thicker with all the solids mixed in and stronger onion taste, FOOD MILL: thinner with just the tomato flavor. Another option many have suggested is to blend and then strain through a sieve, but I think you would still be getting too much onion that way. The food mill is definitely my top choice for this soup.

Love it. Best way of using tomatoes from your garden.
I simplified the steps. I first cook the onion and garlic in a little bit of olive oil until the onion is well cooked. Then I put in the same pot the butter and the flour and after half of a minute I add the broth and I like to put some broth and some milk to make it more creamy. 
Thanks for this recipe!!!

YUM!!! The only thing that I don't like is that it doesn't make a lot :/ I did make some changes like the other people- I added garlic, no cloves, added basil & black pepper. I also didn't do the butter and flour, and I mixed it in a blender after the 20 mins boiling (let it sit a little before pouring it in there). I'll definitely be making this again :)

Yum!! I used fresh Roma and vine-ripened tomatoes and used garlic instead if cloves. After the 20 minutes of boiling the tomatoes, I threw it all in the blender, added to the roux, and then added a half cup of half and half, chopped fresh basil and a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper. It was awesome!

This was the first soup I ever made and I am really happy with how it turned out.  This recipe is simple and straightforward.  The only thing I had a little trouble with was the roux - I think I just need some practice with it and maybe need to work on my proportions.  It got a little lumpy until I added the tomato mix to it, but it all turned out ok!  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was good, however, I think I prefer tomato soup recipes that use tomato juice instead of chicken broth as a base. This just didn't have the rich tomato flavor that I'm looking for.

Fresh, light, and tasty. I would say that this makes closer to 4 servings than 6. (4 bowls or 6 cups of soup, maybe). I did what one reviewer suggested which was to puree the whole thing in a blender after it boils for 20 minutes, before going to the roux step. I also added parsley, basil, and thyme. I might try this again with some garlic. It was a tasty soup, and perfect with a grilled cheese sandwich (I had a smoked cheddar grilled cheese), but I think it was missing something, so maybe I'll add garlic next time.

I am a mother of three teens, and a wife. I have a very picky 12 year old, and he can't get enough of this soup. He asks me to make it often! I often get recipes from here to change things up a bit from the usual weekday meals. This tomato soup is absolutely phenomenal as is!!! Honestly, the ONLY thing I took out was the clove because I can't have them. I would suggest that everyone follows the recipe as is! I have to adjust the recipe to 24 servings. (I know that's a lot, but I have a husband that loves to eat, and three teens). And, it is wiped out within 20 minutes! I love this recipe, and highly recommend it! It is a very sophisticated soup, and is worthy of dinner parties. I give it two very high thumbs up!

Oh heavenly!  I never new cloves could be used to this effect.  Certainly do not skip them.  Created more waste than I expected, since I put it through a pretty fine mesh sieve, but it was totally worth it.  Served with whole milk to cream-ify the soup and cheesy quinoa for a side.

My husband and I really like this soup.  I've made it several times when I had too many tomatoes from the garden, and followed the recipe as exactly as I could, using 4 cloves (not garlic) and 1 slice of onion.  I don't have a food mill so I whirl it in the blender,(be careful if it's still hot!) then strain it. There's very little residue other than seeds, so I don't see any reason to peel or de-seed the tomatoes, which some reviewers have mentioned.  The only change I've ever made to the ingredients was to use brown rice flour for the roux when I made it for gluten-free guests. We couldn't tell the difference.

This is a very simple, very nutritious and very good recipe.  I simplify it by blending the tomatoes and onion in the Vitamix first then add it to the pot with the broth and cloves.  I don't use salt or sugar and it comes out great.  You can also reduce the amount of broth if you like it thicker.  Thanks for sharing

Great tasting tomato soup!  I didn't change a thing in the original ingredients outlined for the recipe.  But before I began cooking the tomatoes, I washed them and put them into my VitaMix to puree them.  Then I put the tomato puree into the stockpot and went from there.  I used ground cloves (I didn't have whole clove).  My husband loved this soup -- especially with a grilled cheese sandwich!  I will definitely make this soup again!

This is a fabulous soup that is surprisingly easy to make, I knew I would want more, as usually do with soups, so I doubled the recipe and used 1 whole red onion,a carton of chicken broth, as well as 8 large cloves of garlic. I grow tomatoes and had some red and yellow varieties available off the vine and used both and it was just wonderful!

Awesome and easy.  I didn't use cloves, I sautéed 4 cloves of chopped garlic in the stock pot before adding the rest of the ingredients.  added fresh basil at the end.

This was an excellent recipe for simple, easy-to-make tomato soup. Like most people I doubled it and it worked fine.  I added a few bay leaves, dash of thyme, a few fresh basil leaves, a few garlic cloves for some more flavour but even without these spices this still would have gotten 5 stars from me, they weren't necessary. I also substituted the butter for EVOO to make it a little healthier.  Will definitely keep making and as I like to put parmesan cheese in my tomato soup I will probably omit all the spices.

I would give it 3 but my husband loved it and would give it a 10 if it was possible.  Next time I make it, because he WILL want it again, I will use 3 cloves instead of 4 and more than just the one slice of onion.  I did add basil to it but only one fresh leaf.  We used fresh tomatoes from our garden which always makes things better.

UPDATE:  I've since made it and have completely omitted the cloves and replaced them with garlic cloves.  Then added basil, oregano and pepper in addition to the salt and 1/2 tsp. sugar.  It paired up wonderfully with the pesto grilled cheese!

I kept it at 4 stars since it's not really the same recipe anymore.

I had never made tomato soup EVER but now I am a complete convert.  This recipe was simple yet absolutely delicious.  I ended up making a huge quadruple batch and took it to work for lunch for 2 weeks.  Don't just make one batch as you WILL want more!

Tasty! I did add 1/8th cayenne pepper as it boiled and kept the chunks, chopping them further. Almost a TB was added for oregano. And some cilantro as a finishing touch!

My son suggested we have grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup one night for dinner.  I immediately searched here and am glad I did.  This recipe is very simple and it's very likely you will have all of the ingredients on hand already.  

Ok, I'll admit it, I too made a few changes.  First off, I'm not a clove fan so they had to go.  Instead I used about 1 1/2 teaspoons of granulated garlic and a pinch or so of basil.  I started by sauteeing the garlic and onion together then added a the basil, chicken broth and tomatoes and followed the recipe from there.  The finished product is great.  I'm not sure if I'll ever eat tomato soup from a can again.  This also gives me another idea for what to do with the leftover tomatoes I'm going to have from my garden this year!

This was great! Seems like this will be a pretty forgiving recipe. I had about a cup of diced up red and green peppers with some onion left over so I tossed that in. Ran it all through the blender because I don't have a food mill. Didn't really notice the seeds and I left the skin on the tomatos(are you kidding! NOT peeling tomatos!) blender took care of it just fine. Added some black pepper and a little grated cheese to the bowl beore serving. Really yummy! Hubby said I should have made more. I bet I could even sneak in a carrot and the kids wouldn't notice! Thank you Charlotte!

I made this recipe without the cloves and added some powdered garlic instead. I'm lucky enough to own an immersion blender, so the soup was velvety smooth. I never cared for tomato soup when I was younger, but I'm definitely rethinking it now.

I have made this recipe twice with tomatoes I froze from my garden earlier this fall. It was delicious both times. I do not have a food mill, so I run at that point, I run it through a food processor and then strain. This is a delicious treat.

Wasn't horrible but I just did not like the flavor.  Needed something but not sure what.  I don't know if I like cloves but I used garlic instead like many of the reviewers so that may have been the problem.  Although I LOVE garlic??

So good!  I used frozen tomatoes from our summer garden.  I also added some whole milk.  I had some leftover brown rice, so I put that in it as well.  It was reminiscent of the canned variety but soooo much better.  My family ravd about it.  We served it with some butter crackers.

I made this for the first time with tomatoes from this year. I had froze and canned about 100 pounds this year. Made this in a huge pot for a large group of friends, everyone loved it. This is simple and easy will never purchase canned soup again.

This soup is soooo good. My family loved it.  The second time I made it I added some fresh basil and they couldn't get enough of it. Now they are always asking me to make if again. Love it!

Made this for my husband and he loved it! The cloves smell great when it's cooking (I used ground clove). I prefer to remove the tomato seeds, and used a food processor instead of a food mill.

Added to addition to the basic recipe 1 clove garlic, a bay leaf, 1/8 t of cayenne pepper, 1 t oregano, 1/2 t of thyme, and 1 cup of milk.  I also reduced sugar to 1 t. These were suggestions from another reviewers.  I could not have been more pleased with the results. Very good recipe.

I've been making this soup since a year ago this summer.  I can't tell you how many people I've passed it on to.  Did try it with my immersion blender, but liked the results using a Foley food mill better.  It's also a wonderful base for minestrone or anything else you might add to it.

As is, I would give this recipe a 4 star.  It's a good basic recipe the way it is.  I have made it 3 times in as many weeks because it is soooo good, with the adjustments.  With changes it's an easy 5.  First, I double it, then I add: 1-2 T. Balsamic vinegar, a dash of red pepper flakes, 1/2 cup of half and half, and about 20 chopped fresh basil leaves.  I have made it with all garden fresh tomatoes, and when I was low on those I subbed a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes for half the tomato amount and both ways it comes out delicious.  So tasty and comforting!  My entire family, including both my picky kids, love this soup.

Tried it with yellow tomatoes and it was a hit. It reminded me of golden tomato soup at grand lux cafe in Chicago. I did use some fresh basil from my yard as a garnish. Five stars*****

Turned out so good! I did a few things different though.I sauteed my onion first in olive oil, I did one whole entire small onion. Then added minced fresh garlic and several dashes of dried basil. Then added one can chicken broth and the tomatoes. Simmered at least 10 min. Then pureed in a regular blender and then did the rest of the recipe as stated. It was a bit chunky with some seeds and skin, but I enjoyed it that way. I will def make this again. I have a ton of tomatoes from my garden.

Awesome soup, however the cloves overpowered it a bit.  To mask the cloves, I added dried basil, dried oregano, and freshly ground coarse black pepper to taste.  A great way to use up garden tomatoes!  I will definitely make this soup again as it was getting good, and easy to make; a great way to use up those garden tomatoes!  Note: You can freeze whole, washed tomatoes for soup-sauce making later if you do not know how to can tomatoes.  The thawed out tomatoes taste like the real thing, especially the little cherry tomatoes!

Excellent recipe.  I did not have whole cloves and was hesitant to use ground, so omitted the spice all together and used garlic to augment the tomato, as well as fresh basil at the end.  Very tasty.

I never had a happier grilled cheese!  Like others I doubled the recipe since I had so many tomatoes.  I also sauted garlic and onions before adding the tomatoes.  I also did add some oregano and balsamic as suggested.  I didnt have a food mill, so I used my blender, worked nicely.  In my garden, I only had cherry tomatoes that grew, but they worked lovely.  No need to chop!  Just pitched them in the pot halved.

Good soup and easy to make. I added crushed garlic while cooking and a little oregano and thyme as some of the other reviewers suggested. In addition, I added a cup of 2% milk and a dash of cream. Enjoyable with slices of a crusty baguette! Next time, due to my own taste preferences, I would leave out the cloves.

I grow LOTS of tomatoes, and I use this recipe exclusively - it freezes very well!  Skinning the tomatoes makes running the soup though the food mill quicker and easier (less pulp left over) but not necessary.  A great, simple, and easy recipe

great base recipe as written.  I did add some milk to the roux to make it more of a cream of tomato soup, and will add more next time to make it even creamier.  Also sauteed the onions and garlic to soften them and added some balsamic vinegar as one other suggested. Tasty way to use up garden tomatoes! Served it with grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches. Thanks for the recipe!

This soup turned out great. I had a Ton of fresh Roma tomatoes that I needed to use, enough for a double batch. I added garlic and ginger and a bay leaf. I pureed with hand held blender. I also used veggie broth instead of chicken broth. I accidentally forgot to add the salt and sugar at the end. Overall it was really good.

Just made this and it is so good. I don't have a food mill, so I pureed everything but the cloves in my blender in 2 batches. I didn't need the sugar because my tomatoes were sweeter, but will keep in mind for the next time I make this.

Made this soup and loved it. Used shallots instead of onion for milder flavor. Would reduce cloves to 3 perhaps as it was strong, this could be a function of how mild or strong your tomatoes are. Will make again thank you.

Great soup.  Used a combination of roma and jet star tomatoes from my garden.  Cored and seeded tomatoes, drained any remaining juice.  Did not add salt, the bouillon had enough salt. Did not need sugar to my taste. Removed cloves before processing through a Foley food mill.  A double recipe made 2 1/2 quarts.  Added approx. 1 tablespoon of milk to each bowl served.

Yum!  I'm the only fan in my home, but probably because my husband is on a trend to discount veggies, and his sons are inclined to follow suit right now.......  Did add a touch of cream, but milk would do as well.  But didn't like this without dairy or dairy substitute - however, I don't like any tomato soup without dairy........

Really delicious, and also healthy! I tried substituting chicken broth for vegetable broth the second time I made it (cause I was having a vegetarian friend over) but it just wasn't the same so definitely stick with chicken broth.

I doubled the recipe and that may be the nature of my problem because there was TOO MUCH clove.   I didn't care for this one much.  IF I were to make it again I would only use half the recommended amount even without doubling it.

The taste turned out to be surprisingly great esp with such simple recipe. In addition, I added 1 stalk of parsley and few dashes of coarse pepper and it tastes fantastic!

This is a very good recipe. I've made it all season with our fresh tomatoes and it's so tasty. It's easy to vary the spices to your taste. I wouldn't leave out the cloves, though -- it's a wonderful touch. I've added a bay leaf, a little white wine, and substituted masa for the flour in the roux. Last batch of tomatoes weren't quite ripe, so I added a little tomato paste, and that really made it rich. Thanks again!

My family really loved this soup.  My 7 year old, who doesn't like tomatoes, ate it up and asked for more.  I made it exactly as he recipe says.  Way better than the canned stuff!

This is a nice tomato soup.  I tend not to be able to eat a ton of it, just frm the sharpness of flavor, but I still enjoyed my small portion.  I used half fresh tomatoes and half canned tomatoes, and it worked fine.  Bf wasn't fond of the thickness; I guess I was a tad too enthusiastic about the roux; next time I'll go a little easier on it.  It was pretty good with grilled cheese sandwiches, and I must say I like the cloves in it, alhtough I wasn't sure while making it.  Thanks for the recipe!

I am not a huge fan of tomato soup but I loved this.  Also, it is great if you have a ton of garden tomatoes to use up.  I will definitely keep making this.

Delicious. A few changes I added fresh basil and a little bit of cream to the soup and did not add any cloves simply because I did not have any on hand

I goofed this recipe and it was still delicious! I didn't read it all the way through and just through everything into the pot, and let it boil for ~20 minutes. It was too late to fix it, so I just took out the cloves and the onion pieces manually afterwards. It tasted great!

This was pretty good.  Made as written except added one clove of garlic.  I think the reason my soup wasn't as flavorful was because my tomatoes weren't great.  Next time I might used canned.

Loved this fresh, easy, flavorful soup.  Make it once, as the recipe reads (that's ONE ONION, SLICED by the way) then have at it with the tweaking, so many ways to adjust this.  Although I did add garlic the first time.  Doesn't make much, really, only 3 meal-sized servings, so either double or make it again.  Not much fat, chock full of vitamin C, beautiful color and delicious - hard to miss.

this is a great basic recipe and i just tweaked it a little bit. I added 1/2 cup half and half (heavy cream is good too) to the roux to make it creamier. I added a tsp of dry basil and oregano also to make it tasty since I didn't have onions available. I can't wait to make more!

Epic win. It tastes nothing like the can...so fresh, so good. I give it 4 stars just because I sort of like that can soup with the grilled cheese. But this one is the sort to eat with anything, or just by itself!

Great recipe.  We made a few changes that turned out well: 1.  We don't have a food mill so we just diced the tomatoes extra small and kept them in - still tasted great and added texture. 2.  Added lots of fresh basil!

Based on other reviews I also made some changes.    I used 2 cloves of garlic, seeded the ROMA tomatoes and used worchestershire sauce for a little zing.  I ran it all thru the blender until smooth.  It was thick enough, so no roux.   I am diabetic, so I used  1T of Agave as a sweetener and 1/4 C of tomato sauce to smooth out the acid.   I did add 1/2 & 1/2 just prior to serving for creaminess, and floated a piece of garlic herb bread on top.   It was delicious.

Yum! I followed the directions exactly, but I did add a few things due to personal preference: a couple cloves of garlic, 1/2 c of heavy cream, 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, and a tablespoon of dried basil.   I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing.

Most tomato soup recipes I have tried are acidic tasting but not this one, it's awesome!   When I had fresh tomatoes out of my garden I made several batches and froze them.

I used the recipe for techniques.....I already had homemade canned tomatoes from the garden so all I had to do was open the (5) quart jars and heat them to a boil along with the (2cups)chicken broth....I sauteed a medium onion and a poblano pepper in lots of margarine (1/2c)....I pureed that and then put it back in the pan to add the flour to make the roux.....I added about 3 tbls (a little at a time) of hot tomato/broth mix to the pan of roux and wisked.....I then put that into the big pot of tomato/broth mix (while wisking)....Pureed it one more time to make sure all the pieces were gone.....Tasted and added 2 tbl sugar....May add a can of cheddar cheese soup...haven't decided yet...will wait for more opinions on how this basic tomato soup tastes!  Thanks for posting it!

We loved this recipe! My husband said he likes it better than canned tomato soup:) I didn't have whole cloves so I sprinkled ground cloves in it and I think I put too much in it. Thanks Charlotte

I think next time I would skin the tomatoes, use a little ground clove instead of whole and use a blender instead of a foodmill.  There were a few too many seeds in my soup. Another option would be to use less seedy Romas but I used what came from my garden.  I made a double recipe and for 3 of us there was little left.

I don't have a food mill so I just put everything in a blender after cooking and added some fresh diced tomatoes to make it chunkier and some fresh basil a few min. before it was done. Also I omitted the cloves because I just don't like them. Everyone LOVED it! Great way to use up fresh tomatoes from the garden!

This is so good, very yummy for a cool fall day!  Now I would have given it 5 stars but I did do a bit of the tweeking that was given in one of the reviews.  Thanks UJOHNC00!  Your advice was great without being way too complicated and time consuming, just the way I like it!

Very good, I didn't bother with a foodmill, I just put it all in the blender.  Also added carrot instead of the sugar, and one potato to thicken so I could skip the ruox step.  (I'm very lazy).

What a great way to use the many, many fresh tomatoes that I have in fall! I did make some changes: I used whatever spices I grabbed from the garden, and half the salt.  I didn't feel like washing appliances, so I just put it through a sieve (as a last step too, so I didn't worry about lumps). I also used it as a base for a minestrone soup. Excellent!!

This is a very good tomato soup. I am used to milk in my tomato soup, so next time I will add some milk or cream to take the bite out of it. It was still very tasty- but it is a very strong tomato flavor. The cloves are subtle yet really add some nice depth of flavors to it, but I might try adding some garlic or italian seasoning next time as well. This is a great basic soup to start out with, and alter to your personal taste as you go.

This soup is awesome!  My entire family loved it!  I only did a couple of things different.  I added 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic, some italian seasoning, and 1 cup of milk after mixing it with the roux.  I prefer cream of tomato soup.  This is why I added milk.  It was delicious!    Also, I doubled the recipe for my family of 5 and it was perfect.  There wouldn't have been enough if I hadn't.   I do not have a food mill so I just poured it into my blender and mixed it that way.  I left peel, seeds, and all in it, and it was great!  Definitely a must try recipe!

This was okay, but I was disappointed. Especially after doubling the recipe and using all of the tomatoes I had left from our garden. I've always been a huge fan of the tomato soup from La Madeleine and was probably looking for something more like that. I did add cream to each serving after tasting the initial product and that helped, but it still didn't give me the amazing soup I was hoping for.

Made it with fresh tomatos from the garden. It was very good, but we don't have a 'food mill' so I used a strainer and it was pretty cumbersome. The taste is very good, but will add some peppericinos and basil to spice it up a bit. I think I may add some fresh cheese, too. But the basic recipe tastes great.

Turned out too thin and cooked more roux with 1T butter and 1T flour. Tasty, but too chickeny and not very tomatoey. Would add more tomatoes, fresh herbs. I added garlic.

I made it as stated except I didn't thicken it, it was thick enough.  But, quite honestly, it was just as if it had come out of the well known red & white can, so it's just not something I'd bother making again. Uninteresting, and for the leftovers I'll have to add some excitement to it.

Absolutely wonderful!  My boyfriend and I loved this soup.  I added a 1/2 cup milk and sauteed celery, onions and fresh whole tomatoes and added them just before serving.  A dollop of sour cream completes this great soup.  Plan on making a batch to see if it freezes well.

I did use some of the suggested changes such as blending the tomato/onion mixture and adding some milk & spices. But, overall we just weren't impressed. DH couldn't seem to get past the fact that the soup was orange instead of red.lol It was too much work for an unimpressive soup. Sorry, I really wanted to love this recipe.

Very good basic recipe, definitely a lot of options for spicing it up a bit.  Instead of putting the food through a food mill we placed the majority of the ingredients in the food processor and left it a bit chunky.  Very delightful and refreshing! Thank you!

I don't have a food mill, so I peeled and seeded my tomatoes beforehand and used a stick blender to puree them.  I don't think one slice of onion is enough, so I wondered if the recipe meant one sliceD onion.

we really liked the freshness of this soup. i made it with hydroponic tomatoes and had i some fresh garden ones i think it would have even been better. i agree with a reviewer who said that the cloves stated must mean cloves of garlic, not 4 cloves.

This was a very fresh tasting tomato soup.  I used romas as that is what I had on hand.  I boiled them for a few minutes so as to remove the skin before using them in the soup, and then followed the recipe after that.  I also didn't have cloves, so substituted garlic (which we love) I served w/ a dollop of sour cream and shredded cheese topping and a parmesan topped crostini for a dipper side.   Will definitely make again perhaps adding a touch of cream to make it a little thicker.

I used this as a base and tweaked it to our own taste.  Also, my fresh tomatoes had been peeled and previously frozen so I just used an immersion blender to make this into a smooth soup.  I used powdered cloves so I wouldn't need to pick out the whole ones but I will omit them next time - I thought they gave the soup a weird taste.

I made this today and it disappeared quickly in my house ! I didn't have cloves so I used garlic instead. My family loved it but I think it needed to be a bit thicker. I felt it was a bit runny. Will try this again.

I made this soup tonight and it was truly delicious. I actually followed "Vivibo's" comments, adding garlic, balsamic vinegar, etc. I doubled the original recipe and thought it would serve 6 generously. The only thing I would do differently next time is peel the tomatoes before cooking. I don't like the little bits of skin left after pureeing in the blender.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic!  The only changes I made were to double the recipe and add 2 cloves of garlic.  I could tell right away that one batch just wasn't going to be enough. It freezes really well ahead of time!  Love love love it!

Very tasty soup.  I doubled the recipe (except for the cloves) to have enough for my family of five.  There were one to two servings leftover.  I felt it needed a little extra zing and my husband agreed.  I added a little balsamic vinegar near the end of cooking and also put a tiny dallop of homemade pesto in the center of each serving.  This was so much better than canned tomato soup.

So sorry I didn't double the recipe the first time making it.  I followed the directions almost exactly, except that I used yellow cherry tomatoes from my garden and added a bit more onion.  I might note I also used home made chicken broth.  This recipe is very easy, not much time involved, and absolutely delicious!  I've moved on to a very large batch using romas.

Forget about Campbells Tomato Soup.  This will be a staple in our house from now on.  I followed other viewer's suggestions and added a little milk at the end.  It so good and creamy and will be the only tomato soup I'll eat.

This was pretty good but seemed to lack a depth of flavor, though I can see where someone would like something more "fresh" and simple tasting like this soup. I like the clove flavor, but didn’t have any whole cloves so added the slightest of pinches of ground clove at the end, which worked. I added a touch too much sugar, but that didn’t ruin it. Next time, I think I might try sautéing the onions in a little butter before adding the tomatoes. This is a good starting point recipe that will allow lots of variations, as noted by other reviewers.

The recipe as written was OK, however I made again with some alterations other reviewers listed and it was much better.

Very good but I think some changes are needed. Leave out the cloves, the flavor is so strong it almost overpowers the soup. I don't have a food mill so I just used my hand held blender. That made it rich and creamy. I topped with some croutons and parmesan cheese, very good, will make again without the cloves. Also, do not add the salt called for, taste it first and add to your liking!!

This is the best recipes for those of us who need to use up fresh tomatoes and don't want to use anything canned. Although it is fresh, it is very quick to make.  I don't have a food mill, so I just pour it through a sieve. If you have small tomatoes you can just throw them in without chopping them. The cloves give it a cozy flavor, I would only leave them out if someone in your family really doesn't like them, (and some people really don't!)

I just finished making this and it is so good.  I will make it again when I have an abundance of fresh tomatoes.  Thanks for sharing. I didn't have any cloves so I used a pinch of All Spice, and a pinch of dried chili flakes.  I like a little heat.  Very good!

This soup was really delicious - I needed to use up tomatoes we had grown in our garden & the soup was a big hit! It was so easy my kids helped me make it & asked for seconds. The only change I made was to add a clove of garlic & cut down the whole cloves to 1. Thanks Charlotte

Wow, I am very impressed with this soup! I have never made a tomato soup before, but this was absolutely great! I didn't have cloves on hand, so I just used some garlic! Thank you for this recipe, I will definately make this again! :)

Delicious!  After reading that so many left out the cloves, I decided to try them.  I didn't have any whole cloves, so I added two dashes of ground cloves instead.  I am so glad I tried it!  The cloves add a subtle savory flavor without overpowering the tomato.  I used 1 quart of home-canned tomato juice/sauce and veggie broth instead of chicken.  I didn't think it needed any sugar at all and just a sprinkling of sea salt.  Yummy!  I'll definitely be making this again.  As much as I like the cloves, the recipe is quite adaptable to season to your taste.  Enjoy!

Terrific recipe! I omitted the cloves because I thought it was an odd ingredient for tomato soup. Instead I added fresh and dried basil. I also used vegetable stock because I don't eat meat. Having made this several times, I've realised it's important to choose really ripe and flavourful tomatoes - the first time I made this, I splurged on Holland vine tomatoes but the tomato flavour turned out too subtle. Maybe those vine tomatoes are better for salads? I'm not sure. Anyway, the 2nd time I used cheap local tomatoes and it was absolutely perfect, just bursting with tomatoey goodness. This recipe makes only about 1/3 the yield it says. Keeps well in the fridge for several days. Thanks for this terrific recipe!

This soup is FABULOUS!!  I have never enjoyed tomato soup so much and everyone I have given some to raves about it.  I have eaten it plain and also thrown in Italian sausage, zucchini, green beans, etc.  It has also made me very popular because everyone is giving me all the tomatoes from their garden that they don't know what to do with.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

Nice way to use the bounty of summer tomatoes.  Doubling the recipe is a must!  For some added flavor make sure to toss in fresh basil leaves before simmering.  Nice recipe that I will make again.

Great tomato soup!  A good roux is the key to making this soup very creamy and smooth.  It's a great way to use up extra tomatoes from the garden.

This is the very best tomato soup!  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have whole cloves so I threw in two pinches of ground cloves.  Everyone loved it.  My only complaint is that the recipe only made enough for four servings.  Maybe I let it simmer too long.  Will definitely make again; this time, a double batch!  Thank you.

We loved this - I used fresh tomatoes from the garden and a little basil from the garden.  I used the spiced cloves (my husband found slightly overpowering but he still raved about it) so I will use less next time.  I used a teaspoon of crushed garlic and a blender instead of a food mill.

Wasn't bad. But, thought it was too salty and to much butter flavor for me.  Would recomend start with half of recomended salt and butter and adjust to taste.  Also, for me it needed some milk.  Would recomend substituting maybe 1/5 of broth with milk.  I also added a little more sugar.  As far as the Garlic cloves or cloves (the spice)conraversy, I think for this soup it definitely requires cloves (the spice) for a traditional tomato soup taste.

I can't imagine this soup with actual clove cloves.  I used four cloves of garlic and that was awesome.  It's a salty soup, so beware when it comes to adding salt.  I don't think I will next time.  Of course, it depends on the sweetness of your tomatoes.

Wow!  Great recipe for tomato soup lovers...  The "4 cloves" definitely refer to 4 GARLIC cloves.  I love how easy this is to do & the results are amazing.  I boiled the tomatoes for a second so I could peel them - did this the night before - although, since everything is going in the blender anyway it probably made little difference.  I also added 4-5 fresh basil leaves, and served the soup with a garlic/thyme cornbread crouton.  Heaven!

Terrific recipe!  Recipe is great as is, but here is my spin on it.  I add fresh green onions from my garden with the onion asked for to the simmer (I omit the cloves only because I don't stock them in my pantry).  On occasion after soup is ready to eat, I add small diced, cooked potatoes & carrots and warm through.  

Since I found this recipe 3 years ago, I look forward to making it with the fresh tomatoes from my garden every year!  My DH doesn't like tomato soup from a can but this one he loves!

This was quick and so yummy!  I did not have cloves nor a food mill so this is what I did instead...I added in some Italian seasonings in lieu of the cloves.  When it came time to use the food mill, I pureed everything in my blender.  Based on other reviews, I added some cream (half and half).  I would defintely make this again - even for guests!

I just made this soup for lunch and it was wonderful!  I too used my vita mix - tossed in the tomatoes, two slices of onion and two cups of boiling water in which I added 2 1/2 Tsp of chicken soup base.  Blended this for one minute.  Melted the butter in a soup kettle and then added the flour to make the roux, then gradually added the tomato mixture.  Add the salt and sugar as called for, then served it up with garlic croutons.  This is a real keeper!

Great soup.  very fresh and full of flavor.  be careful when adding in the flour..., may clump.
Also to change it up a bit you can cook with small size pasta.., and food fill all the contents!  great for kids too!!!

After buying a 5# bag of tomatoes at the farmer's market, I knew I was going to be making some soup (2.5 times this recipe).  This recipe is a Vvery good starting point.  I didn't exactly prefer the clove flavor, but it is definately a fun touch.  I don't have a food mill, so I peeled, seeded the tomatoes before putting them in with onion over heat.  I also added half a bulb of garlic.  I didn't have butter, so I used veggie oil.  Next time, I will definately  go buy the butter.  I puree'd the toms, onion, garlic in the blender and did not push through a sieve.  I prefer a slight chunkiness to my soup.  Everyone has been doctoring the soup in their own ways... I like a bit of chili powder, cumin, and tabasco, Sister likes a spoon of pesto, DH likes cheese... all taste great.  Like another reviewer mentioned... I wish there was a 4.5 star rating.  With such a HUGE batch of soup, I am freezing at least half of it.  It should be fine since I have made tomato sauces that actually turn out a bit better once they're frozen.

I had to review this recipe since I love it so much!  This is the ultimate comfort food.  I added an extra cup of tomatoes and some cream because I like a thicker tomato soup, but you can't beat the taste!!

Yummy! Very easy to make, and the flavors are rich (the tomatoes) yet subtle (the cloves).... I don't have a food mill, so I peeled the tomatoes before cooking, and later used a food processor. The second time I had the soup, I added some cooked rice, which went very well. Thanks for a great recipe!

I've tried making a few tomato soups before and never had too much luck so I was a bit hesitant about the cloves. I don't have a food mill either- hadnt even heard of one. I figured it was just needed to get rid of the seeds so I sliced the seeds out first and later used a food processer in its place. Amazing taste but not quite enough. I had t change the recipe into metric and thought maybe it was a conversion error. After reading a few other reviews though I think I would double the amount next time.

Awesome soup, easy to make. Will be making more!!

Awesome soup with one warning: There is no way that the original recipe makes enough soup for six people. That is a disappointment when you're making it for all your university buddies.... It barely made enough for four of us. Anyways, awesome recipe! I didn't have any cloves, so I added about 4 cloves of garlic, a dash or two of dried basil and a bit of fresh thyme and sage and pureed it all together. It was great! :D

This soup was good, but not quite what I had in mind.  The chicken broth gave the tomatoes less intensity and the soup was thinner than I thought it would be.  I liked the cloves.

Excellent soup!  I served it with grilled cheese sandwiches and a little mozzerella cheese to top.  I also boiled the tomatoes and broth with the lid off to cook off some of the water and added a littld garlic while browning the flour for the Roux. It turned out wonderfully!

Very good.  I gave 4 stars because it wasn't quite what I was looking for, but it was very good.  I left out the sugar, only used a pinch of ground cloves, added bay leaves, garlic and cajun seasoning to spice it up a bit.  I threw it all in the blender and then added it to the roux.  I found that mine made only 3-4 servings instead of 6 and like others said, the prep time is more like  20 minutes.

Tasty and easy - the quality and flavour of the tomatoes used will have a profound impact on the taste of the soup (I would never make this in winter). I used heirloom tomatoes from my garden.  I also used one whole medium onion (instead of a slice), a 1/2 rib of celery, and a healthy pinch of ground cloves (since I didn't have whole ones).  I agree with a previous reviewer - there's no way the prep time can be 5 minutes, unless you're opening cans of tomatoes. Plan on 15-20 minutes of prep time with fresh ingredients.

This recipe is easy and it makes some great soup!
Also, a great way to enjoy tomatos from your garden in the winter by freezing some of this soup and heating it up after shoveling the driveway.

this recipe makes a delicious, fresh tasting soup. i used ripe marietta tomatoes (from ohio) & a 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves because i didn't have the whole ones. this soup was simply wonderful the same day it was made however i must say it had definitely lost some pizzaz when reheated 2 days later. thank you charlotte.

I peeled the tomatoes as well as added garlic, oregano, basil, and a bay leaf.  To save time I simply blended with hand blender.  I also cut the flour and added one cup of milk.  This recipe is fabulous.

I changed the recipe slightly, by adding lots of herbs, as I found it a little bland without herbs. I used both fresh and tinned tomatoes, and I only used a hand blender, so it wasn't very smooth, which I found I liked better. I would also recommend peeling the tomatoes first.

I realy enjoy making this soup, it is so quick and simple!

I should have used tomatoes that were better, I used hot house vine ripen tomatoes. This recipe was good but not great.  I skipped the roux altogether but added a cup of whole milk, garlic, pepper, bay leaf, fresh chopped basil and some oregano.  Also I peeled the tomatoes and cored them before boiling them in the pot.  I removed the bay leaf and cloves before blending it all up nice and smooth using a hand blender.  My husband thought it was delicous I think it would probably taste better the next day once all the spices had a chance to infuse it.

This was very good.  I used fresh parsley, fresh basil, garlic, bay leaf, thyme and milk.  It was delicious.  Will definately make again but try without the butter and flour to make it a little less fattening.  This recipe would make a great addition to the "gourmet chicken sandwich" recipe...

We really liked this recipe.  The taste was wonderful and what a good way to use up some of those tomatoes in the garden.  I always make my own soups and this will be a recipe that I keep and use again.  I give a thumbs up to this one!

I tripled the recipe, which still gave us enough for one dinner for four and a small amount left over.  I would reduce butter, sugar & salt next time.

I made this exactly as stated (only I doubled it like others recommended, might as well if you doing all the work).  It was good but seemed to lack just a touch of flavor so I ended up adding in a couple of teaspoons of some jarred basil pesto.  It definitely took it up a notch.  I will be making this again.

Very good but I did add some garlic, 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1 tsp thyme and 1 Tbsp oregano.  Not nearly enough for 6 servings so I suggest you double it.

I tripled the batch because of the previous comments that the original recipe doesn't make very much soup, and I wanted this to feed my family for two meals. The soup was too thin and not flavorful enough for my tastes (though this would probably be different if I had access to homegrown tomatoes), so I added 8-10 fresh basil leaves, 2 teaspoons of minced garlic, a teaspoon of black pepper, and an extra teaspoon each of salt and sugar. Even after letting it cook down for half an hour longer than the recipe called for, the soup was still a little thin and didn't have enough tomato flavor, so I added a can of tomato paste. I zapped the whole batch with my submersible blender and was pleased with the results.

SOOOO good. Followed VIVIBOs suggestions. Made it with 2 bags frozen garden  tomatoes and garlic chicken broth, with a huge statement salad for my daughter's 18th birthday lunch.  Fed 9 adults no leftovers!

I was surprised at how tasty and simple this recipe was. I had about 8 tomatoes on hand and thought this was a great way to use them. I tweaked it very little. Caramelized the onions in olive oil and garlic before adding tomatoes and chicken stock. Also added a tablespoons of balsamic. Everything else was the same. At the end, I added some red chili flakes. Will definitely keep this recipe on hand for a quick tomato soup!

Made without changes. I gave four stars because I thought the whole cloves where slightly overpowering. I would do 2 next time. Also double it. Served with grilled cheese, garnished with basil. Great recipe.

Great starter recipe. I followed the recipe with a few alterations. I omitted butter. I used a large can of organic crushed tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes. I omitted the chicken broth and flour altogether. I like my tomato soup thick. The cloves really make a difference; I didn’t think it would. I was so wrong. I added oregano, basil, onion powder, sugar, minced garlic, black pepper, and pink Himalayan salt. I let it simmer on low for 20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and marry. It is delicious. I served it with grilled cheese.

I added garlic. Didn’t have any whole cloves but did add a bay leaf. The addition or some heavy cream helped reduce the acidity of the fresh tomatoes. Hubby said best tomato soup he ever had  so a repeat with next years tomatoes

Enjoyed the fresh flavor. Used home grown tomatoes, we had a lot. I sautéed the onions and I guess garlic cloves were meant, by cloves. Then proceeded with the recipe. Added a little more salt towards the end, and pepper. A tablespoon of balsamic vinegar also. I think finishing it with a little basil at the last minute would have brought out more flavor. Hubs was a more of a fan of it than me, but it was good!

I have to go between what me and my boyfriend thought. I gave this a 3 tops, and him well he ate it all. I'd go maybe 3.5. I was asked if I could repeat it which I can but I won't. If I make this again I would definitely skin the tomatoes first, and go from there. I couldn't eat it and basically told everyone not to. He added some more pepper and lots of crackers to it. My advice be heavy with the salt and pepper. My only way I thought to salvage it was in a soup.
Update: Took the time to skin the tomatoes and take the seeds out. Same result but much prettier in color. If my honey doesn’t eat it I may toss it into spaghetti or goulash. Can’t bring myself to try this again. To time consuming with no good results. I wanted to love this. Thank you for sharing.

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for!  I served it for lunch to guests alongside toasted cheese sandwiches on sourdough bread. Delicious!!  As recommended by others, I doubled the recipe. It was enough to serve 5. Half the sugar was enough for me,  and a generous pinch of cayenne made this tomato soup perfect!

This  soup is worthy of making.  This soup will make an excellent base.  The addition of cloves really makes it stand out.  I added approximately six roasted red peppers.  I now 
had Roasted Red Pepper and Garden Fresh Tomato Soup.  It was delish.  Get creative with it and make your own recipe.

Came out pretty close to how Campbell’s tasted! But I did a couple things differently. After I strained the soup, I puréed the tomato chunks with heavy cream in a blender and added it to the strained soup.

This recipe is great! The only thing that would make it a bit better is to peel the tomatoes before you do anything else, and i recommend that you double or triple the recipe because there is only enough for 2 people as is

Very good!  Used the end of the season tomatoes as I had way too many.  The only changes I made was swapping chicken for vegetable broth and adding juice from 1/2 lemon.  I added some dried basil and oregano too.  Soooo good!

A neighbor dropped off some tomatoes so I thought "tomato soup" as I had never made any before.
I followed this recipe except for the addition of a couple splashes of half and half to the roux and a small amount of fresh basil when I blended it.   Next time I think I will reduce the cloves by 25%.  I can understand the appeal of cloves but I think I would like it to be a little more subtle.
Having tested the recipe, I feel safe in doubling it next time and maybe trying some other suggestions.

Absolutely delicious!!!  It was easy to make. I didn't have whole cloves on hand, so used about 1/8th teaspoon of ground cloves.  It came out great. I'm going to make more to freeze so I'll have the fresh taste of tomatoes all winter long! Thanks for the great recipe!

Made mostly as is with the exception of using an immersion blender to blend rather than putting ingredients through a food mill—could not bear to waste any of this goodness—and, I added 1/2 c of heavy cream at the end.   It is so delicious that I made a second double batch after making the first!   It is going into the freezer for additional meals in the coming weeks.

I made this last year and followed the recipe, just added a little cream and it was so good.
This time I listened to reviews and followed some of them and the soup is not even close to the original. I won't make that mistake again. Less is more.

It's so delicious! First time making tomato soup and it's so easy and simple. I used an immersion blender and a metal pasta strainer to strain  out the skin. Try to use vine tomatoes they give off the best flavor profile. I also used organic tomato paste to thicken it up a little bit. It's really good and served with grilled cheese it's amazing.  I will probably make it again this week. Recommend highly. Everything together took me about 20 minutes.

This is the BEST tomato soup I have ever had! I used tomatoes from our garden, a mixture of varieties, and I added a splash (1/4 c?) of half and half at then end to make it a little creamy. I don't have a food mill, so I just pushed it through a strainer with a wooden spoon in batches. There wasn't that much soup, so it really wasn't difficult. Now I can't wait for next summer's tomato harvest!

Perfect! Never made tomato soup before and this was simple. And had a wonderful flavor. My husband is not a tomato soup lover and he liked this one! I we had several bowls then used it for chili. It gave the chili a better flavor. Will use this recipe forever !!!

This is such a great version of a hearty tomato soup. I think it's always going to be as good as the tomatoes you use, so end of summer is just a perfect time to make this soup. I love the smell of the cloves as it cooks, it adds a really fun element (although I may only use 2-3 next time instead of 4). It's only been finished for about 10 minutes, so when I try it again in a few hours, I am sure the flavors will really take shape. I followed the recipe exactly but added 1 garlic clove and a little white pepper. It's really fresh!

We loved this! I was amazed how easy it was to make and how yummy it was. My 4 year old grand-daughter asked for seconds.  I read all the suggestions but eventually went with the recipe as posted and wouldn't change a thing!  I did run mine through a juicer.

Have made this several times and each time I have enjoyed it. The first time I went with the recipe as laid out, pretty good. The next few times I have adjusted the garlic amount and added pico de gallo chile powder to the soup. The last time I added fresh pieces of corn tortillas to the soup and sprinkled it with Cotija Cheese. Yum.

Made it just like in the video which is just slightly different from the printed recipe. Using the immersion blender rather than a food mill easier and neater. Wouldn’t change anything. The rue thickens the soup so no need to add milk.

So easy, so fresh, so delish! I keep the cloves out and add garlic when I make this and occasionally I'll add a touch of cream but its not necessary.  I love taking my garden tomatoes and putting soup up for the winter.  Nothing better!

The garden is in full tomato production mode...not complaining. The soup was great, added a dash of 1/2 and 1/2 when it was finished. Cloves are a different but interesting taste. I will be making this soup again, I want to try basil next time instead of the cloves.

Will definitely make again.  I substituted ground cloves for whole cloves and used too much, will limit to 1 tsp next time.  I will also blanch and peel my tomatoes next time for increased smoothness. I seasoned with salt, ground peppercorns and garlic powder (did not add the sugar)and it was very good!

Used canned whole tomatoes and added milk and sugar. Did not use roux. Topped with a dollop of Boursin cheese. It was excellent.

I was a bit confused about the cloves, thinking surely they meant cloves of garlic, so I left them out. But later, reading the reviews, I realized they REALLY meant cloves, so I sprinkled about 1/8 tsp on the top and cooked for 10 minutes. YES, the cloves really make the soup!

I added 4 cloves of garlic and a palmful of fresh basil leaves. I added the basil during the puree portion.  Like many others, I interpreted the "slice" of onion to mean 1 onion sliced. I actually used 2 small onions. The soup is fantastic!

Didn't have a food mill so used submersible blender and then poured thru fine mesh sieve. Very good! Might try adding basil next time. MUST DOUBLE recipe. I cut the recipe down just a little  and really ended up with 1 good sized bowl.

This was fantastic and so delicious. I had a little trouble with the gloves, since I didn't have a strainer or a sieve. So I've used a paper towel and smashed one clove with the bottom of my olive oil. It worked. I did my best to get all of the clove pieces removed. I only pureed my tomato mixture twice without needing to remove the pulp. I did have a bit of burnt flour mixture at the bottom of my pan. But it came out all right. I've added croutons to top it off. I would love to make it again with fresh tomatoes instead of canned diced tomatoes.

I have made this twice now. The first time, I used Roma tomatoes and made it just as the recipe stated; both of us loved it!

The second time, I used regular tomatoes, and left out the butter and flour. The flavor wasn't as robust, but I liked it better because it was "cleaner".

I do not strain anything at all, but rather puree it. To get the skins off before cooking, I scorch them on the stove, for easy peeling. 

Overall, excellent recipe.

I actually created an Allrecipes account to create a review for this soup. I’m vegetarian. But I cook meat for my son. This soup was amazing. What I omitted from directions was the mill and a few other things. But this recipe speaks simple, fresh, add as you wish, busy person needing a healthy, tiny soup I plopped chopped fresh tomatoes (organic on the vine type)  into a pot, chopped onion of what I had (sweet), couple cloves of garlic, water and vegetarian *healthy* bullion paste. I simmered with 1 bay leaf. No salt, no pepper.

Don't follow the recipe from the dec/jan 2019 magazine knockoff! They say you can substitute 2 cans diced tomatoes. Though technically you can, it's a total waste of time and misses the point of using up all those garden tomatoes! I could not detect the clove flavor, and the portion is too tiny, so 4 stars, but I will definitely try this again this summer with fresh garden tomatoes., and I will definitely double the recipe.

Love this recipe, super simple and delcious. So much better than canned soup. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken to make it vegetarian, peeled the tomatoes first and put in 2 cloves of garlic because I didn’t have 4. Will be making this again.

Couldn't be better.
I used a quart of our canned garden tomatoes.  Didn't change anything.

I'm glad I didn't skip the roux because it really makes a difference.

I used an immersion blender.

This was so easy I'll never used canned tomato soup again.

I followed the recipe fairly closely, using a bunch of fresh tomatoes I bought at Costco out of season. The two main deviations were 1) I sautéed the onions in the pot before adding the other ingredients, because that's how I always make soup, and 2) I used a couple of cloves of garlic instead of cloves of cloves :). Oh, and I didn't add any sugar because I don't like sugar in savory dishes, and it didn't need it anyway. Next time maybe I'll try real cloves just to see how it goes. In any case it was excellent.

I had a big 5 pound can of tomatoes I needed to use, so made this soup. It turned out well and was a good use of all those tomatoes. I added about 6 cups homemade vegetable broth and the seasonings listed. It needed something chewy, so I put in shredded cheddar and leftover spaghetti pasta cut small. Nice on a winter’s day.

I made the soup exactly as stated in the directions. It was amazing! I wouldn’t change a thing. I get a lot of compliments when I serve this to friends and family. A must have in your recipe box!

Great recipe. We have been making this in big batches from our garden. I double the roux because we like it a little thicker. We have been canning this and are all stocked up for the winter! “So Good!!!”

I used my canned Roma Tomatoes from my summer garden and added my fresh Basil that I grew.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  Was really good.  Glad I took the time to can my tomatoes with basil.

This turned out awesome! We added a smidge of curry powder just for a kick, but it tasted great without it as well. I did remove the cloves before blitzing it tho ??

THIS TOMATO SOUP WAS #SOGOOD! Reminds me of #childhood days at my grandmothers house in winter, of course the times that she wasn't beating my #! I didn't have any #tomatoes laying around the kitchen so I substituted it with #eggplant! Turned out great!

Great recipe and actually can be done with different added flavors(my husband asked for pieces of bacon). Also from my taste there was not enough tomatoes so I added, besides canned, 5 more pealed Roma tomatoes and lots of basil

It turned out good following the recipe, I added a couple of touches for my personal taste including a bit of cayenne pepper and oregano for seasoning, 2-3 chopped garlic cloves, and a dash of milk just to make it creamier

My husband and I liked it! I was out of flour, but substituted with what I had... Coconut flour. It was probably not the same texture as the recipe, but we still liked it.

Ah-May-ZING!! I used 4 cans of crushed tomatoes, added balsamic vinegar to the roux and added 1 cup of heavy cream. So yummy and the family loved it with grilled cheese or some garlic bread.

Made this yesterday and the soup was wonderful, fresh, and filling.  I followed the recipe exactly and agree that it made less servings than stated but we used it as a whole meal. I ordered a food mill last night...it will be so much easier not only for this recipe but also for making tomato pasta sauce.  Update:  I now make up multiple batches of this soup and it freezes wonderfully .  Yummy!

This soup is really good.  I didn’t add cloves or sugar just salt and pepper and a small red chile pepper. I really don’t like a lot of onion so used minced onion. I wish I had tripled the recipe though as it didn’t make enough   Super easy and delicious

Delicious. I sautéed a few cloves of chopped garlic in olive oil before adding the tomatoes, onion, and cloves. 

I also used whole wheat flour for roux.

Very delicious.

Eh. Made it this afternoon for dinner tonight. It's VERY BITTER! I was planning on skipping most of the sugar like I normally do, but ended up adding twice as much to take away some of the sour taste. Also spent 25 minutes picking out all the chunks of whole clove. Used a standing blender and it did not crush up the cloves like I thought it would. My kids will never eat tomato soup ever again if they get a bite with a clove in it. Yuck! Hopefully everyone likes it tonight... Although I honestly doubt I'll be making this again.

Wonderful flavor, and freezes well.  I omitted the cloves, and added chopped garlic cloves.  Also, added cream cheese when I added the tomato mixture into the roux. Lots of ways to add different flavors to get a different taste.  This is now my basic recipe.

This recipe was nice. Like most people I made adjustments. I used garlic and added herbs and spices. I also didn’t add flour because the soup was thick enough. I used a whole onion and the onion really added a delicious flavour.

Love this simple yet tasty recipe. Great way to get ride of all the not so good looking tomatoes at the end of the garden season. Can’t go wrong and it is so much better then store bought.

Started with a bit of oil and minced garlic. Added 3 tbs fresh basil in tomatoes. Made it with golden cherry tomatoes and although it wasn't 'red' it is absolutely delicious. Used a less salt and no sugar since they are sweet to begin with.

No need to change a thing. This is a great recipe as is (although it should read "one sliced onion."). I would never have thought to use whole cloves, but they gave just the perfect taste to the soup. After you've tried this recipe as written, go ahead and mess with it, but at least give this simple, yummy recipe a real try.

Yum. I loved this recipe. I had plenty of fresh ingredients from my garden. The soup was fantastic. I admit, I followed the other suggestions to add in a bit of balsamic vinegar and fresh basil at the end, and this became my all-time favorite tomato soup.

This soup is so delicious and so easy! We had a ton of tomatoes from our garden that we needed to use up. I don’t own a good mill so I used my immersion blender as another person suggested. It was still slightly chunky, but in a good way! I added the 2 teaspoons of sugar but next time will just do 1 teaspoon. Overall, an amazing recipe - thank you for sharing it with us!

Loved the ease of making this delicious soup.  I added a cup of Marsala wine, a good amount of cayenne spice, topped it with reggiano cheese flakes.   I halved the sugar and salt.  Next time I will make it with half the flour for the roux.

I started out making salsa, but my tomatoes were way too liquidy and needed to find another use.  This recipe caught my eye.  I followed it ALMOST exactly (skipped the salt and sugar), and it is fanTAStic!!!!  The butter and flower added in really added some nice flavour.  Next time I will probably throw in some garlic though, and possibly some cayenne pepper for a little kick.  Excellent recipe.  Nice to find a recipe using fresh tomatoes....

pretty delish. made it just like recipe said. thinking i may roast the tomatoes next time i make this soup.  i roast them simply by after chopping them, put on a cookie sheet and drizzle with olive oil, salt & pepper, then bake at 350 for 20 min. then add to recipe and continue as directed. i like the richness that roasting adds to the tomato soup.  it was good as is as well.

I loved this! Mostly because it is easy! I never knew what to so with all our fresh garden tomatoes and then I saw this recipe. I use vegetarian stock and also cut the fresh herbs in the garden to use. I dry out the rosemary and use that just because I like the taste of rosemary. Other than that no other changes.

I added a handful of fresh basil, about 2 T. The idea was taken from the basil in one of the pictures. I didn't make the roux because I wanted the soup thinner to be able to dip sandwiches in. 
Yummy!!

We added green vegetables to give it more substance and it was great.  Not owning a food mill we also left the tomato skins/pieces and that worked out too.

Made this as a half recipe using 4 medium sized tomatoes fresh off the vine.  Pealed,  de-seeded then diced and reserved the juice.  This got me a generous 2 cups.  Used an immersion blender to liquefy, but forgot to take out the cloves.  I guess a food mill would keep them back?  Tasty flavor and we enjoyed it with grilled cheese sourdough sandwiches, but overpowered by the cloves (my bad).  Made it a second time without the cloves.  Will make again and freeze.  Got a lot of tomatoes ripening on my one plant.

I added about 1/4 cup milk to make it a little creamier and a pinch of basil.  Did not use whole cloves, just a shake of ground cloves. My husband really like it!

This is a great recipe! An easy way to use up those extra tomatoes from the garden. I first made the recipe as instructed, but in later batches I added 1 bay leaf and some fresh basil and removed the cloves (not a big fan of cloves) All were great and easy to prepare. I’ll try canning some next.

pretty well followed the recipe but used a lg. can of diced tomatoes rather than fresh tomatoes.  i  added some dried basil and simmered it all for a good 30 mins.  used immersion blender which worked very well.  made the roux , added some tom. mixture to it and then added it to the pot.    i like a creamy tomato soup so i added 1/2 c. 2% milk and 1/2 c. whipping cream.   i will make this recipe again.

Easy, excellent and amenable to various improvisations, e.g., sprinkle in some basil, minced garlic, pepper, parsley or other spice into the stew as it cooks. I'll definitely make it again and try different versions of my own.

Loved it with some crackers. I roasted half the tomatos with a red bell pepper, otherwise followed the recipe. I added maybe 3/4 tablespoon of sugar and almost no salt. Used my nutribullet for 1.5 seconds to blend it. Nice texture. Very yummy and beautiful color.

Great base recipe...you can take it many different ways if you don’t like this one.  I’ve added cream, curry, smoked paprika, peppers, garlic, and pretty much anything to make many different versions .  I do like the recipe as is also.  But when I want to experiment I make the base and then to het the flavor I want.  Can make a great Indian flavor soup with this recipe.

This is a great recipe to use nature’s bounty right now. It was so flavorful with our tasty fresh garden tomatoes. I used a little fresh garlic sautéed when the onions were almost done instead of the cloves since I was out. Of cloves. The soup was delicious hot the first night and the next night I tried it cold and thought it was super for a hot night so we enjoyed it just as much cold. Hubby agreed it’s a keeper recipe.

Super easy and delicious recipe! I doubled the recipe (to freeze some) didn't have any onions on  hand so I used onion soup mix with 4 cups of water in lieu of onion and chicken stock. Turned out delicious! 
We are not a sophisticated audience, so I just cored and sliced the tomatoes and hit them with a stick blender after cooking. It could use a fine sieve for critics. 
I also didn't have any whole cloves, so I used 1/2 tsp ground in lieu of 8 whole cloves.
Next time I will experiment this recipe with tomatillos.

Fantastic! I did a whole onion, add garlic, basil, and Italian seasoning.
I also used my immersion blender and didn't strain or remove anything. 
Came out fantastic.

I love cooking with such fresh ingredients. I added fresh chopped basil, dehydrated oregano and black pepper. I also used honey instead of sugar, and poured in a couple splashes of 2% milk at the end. The milk added a little bit of creaminess that was missing and the honey added a natural sweetness. My husband likes his food a little on the spicier side, so he added a little bit of red pepper flakes to his own bowl. I garnished with some grated asiago and parmesan Italian cheeses and a little cheddar, and French's fried onions :)  It's also tasty to add a couple spoons of orzo pasta. Bon appetit!

I doubled the recipe. Added whole allspice instead of cloves. Also added one teaspoon of cayenne pepper, one teaspoon thyme, minced garlic, milk to taste. Blended tomato mix in the blender and then strained it through a strainer. Serve luke warm. Yum!!

Turned out great! We needed something to make with our abundance of fresh tomatoes and wanted a simple, straightforward recipe and this was it. We were a little nervous about the cloves but were pleasantly surprised by the added flavor. No need to modify at all.

Delicious!!!  I veganized the recipe, buttery spread for butter, non chicken vegan chicken flavor bullion instead of chicken stock and I added fresh basil (because I had it) and extra garlic because I always do to recipes. I also had a little vegan half and half so I added a little of that. I didn’t need as much sugar so I didn’t add it.  I liquified the cooked vegetable mix in my bullet-worked great. What  a neat low cal comfort food.  No one else in my house likes tomato soup so.... more for me.  Of course husband hasn’t tried it yet. Thank you!!!

At first I read the comments. I followed the recipe, but also I made some changes. I added a little olive oil and two cloves of garlic and cooked on high for 20 mints, then when was  time I prepared butter with the flour (gluten free),  I also added 1 cup of Plant base Half & Half  non dairy and follow the process. when serve I added basil cut very tiny on the top! It Was so good.

I made it exactly as per the recipe, but halved the ingredients to make 1 serve.  As I do not have a food mill, I crushed the ingredients with a potato masher and then strained it through a large, fine, stainless steel strainer.  This worked perfectly and created a smooth silky soup with no tomato skins, seeds, onion or cloves.  I was tempted to add garlic and basil, as I was concerned that the soup would be bland,  but I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the fresh taste of the tomatoes and onion and the subtle clove flavour.   A simple but enjoyable soup.

Excellent basic recipe. I subbed 1/4 c. plain yogurt for the milk, omitted the cloves as we’re not fans, and added some leftover sautéed red, orange and yellow peppers that we had. I blended with an immersion blender then put it through a sieve. Served with half a grilled cheese sandwich. Delicious.

Delicious! And so easy. Only changes that I made was cooking in my Instant Pot, and blending with an immersion blender instead of a food mill. And don’t skip the cloves. I wasn’t sure about them, but followed the recipe, and was glad I did. This one is a keeper!

Followed the recipe exactly and my soup was runny and orange - not at all like the pic and not very appetizing looking. The clove is overpowering and if I make this again, I'll use garlic instead.

was making another tomato soup recipe that didn't have enough flavor.  added the spices (both garlic and ground cloves) and came out with a winner!  my original recipe used tomato juice!  works surprisingly well in the winter.
The ground cloves take it to a whole new level - don't leave them out!

I made this just as stated in the recipe. Doubled the recipe and made 1 addition to the recipe of 3 garlic cloves sliced. Added them to the tomatoes, onions, cloves and chicken broth.   This is so simple and so tasty.  I saved it in my favorites and will definitely make it again!    Thank you

I’ve made this a few times and each time I’m surprised at how good it is because the recipe is so simple. I use a large can of canned tomatoes when I don’t have fresh tomatoes. Either way is terrific. I also use half an onion which I sauté in a little olive oil before adding other ingredients. After fishing out the four whole cloves, I purée using an immersion blender. Zowwy!

I've made many receipts from this site and none have been more disappointing than this receipt; gave 1 star because the site won't let me give 0.  I don't think this soup is even edible.  The cloves are way too overpowering!  I made the receipt as stated.

Made the soup and it was very good. Was a little bland so added my own touches to spice it up. But a very quick and easy way to have a homemade meal. What I also found....The base for this recipe ( the tomatoes and chicken broth ) make a great base virtually any kind of soup you can dream up. I boil them per the recipe and pour it into a blender for a smooth soup starter. I've used this on many different dishes and all have turned out fantastic! It's a blank palette that's only limited by your imagination.

Turned out great, added a little fresh garlic for taste and substituted almond flour/coconut flour for the all purpose flour

I’ve always wanted to make my homemade tomato soup. I love it and the best tasting tomato soup was in my school back when I was in Elementary in Miami, Fla. @ Caribbean Elementary. Every other soup was just canned or blah flavor. This soup has the right amount of flavors. All I did different was to add 1 bay leaf and 2 tsps of tomato paste because my tomatoes were a bit tasteless and 1 tsp of tomato flavor bouillon to add color. To the cook of this soup, Thank you for sharing. Loved your simple yet very tasting soup. To serve I added 3 chopped basil leaves and toasted in butter slice of French bread, my husband loved it. I give it 5 stars.

Very good bones on this old recipe. I sort of combined it w/ Zesty Tomato Soup from this site...using additional spices. I had three vine tomato's...put an X in the not stem end and blanched for a couple plus minutes and then peeled the skin. Thing is I re-included the skins in the soup before I stick blended it all to a semi course mush. Do whatever you want w/ this. I could have added Mirapoix ingredients besides the onion. I put dried basil in the mix...a spot of vinegar, a couple Bay Leaves w/ a 1/2 cup chicken broth and a little white wine and let it reduce over medium heat. Took out the 2 bay leaves and 5 cloves from the doubled recipes and blended it. S&P to taste. Next is the grilled cheese sandwich. BTW, recipe calls for cloves, seems weird to me...but they worked fine AND moderating the acidic nature of tomato w/ sugar isn't made healthy by reducing sugar in half. Not to  mention seeds aren't going to hurt you...embrace the seed and skin if you can.

I prepared this soup precisely following the recipe, and it is bloody inedible. The whole idea of cloves in tomato soup can go back where it came from. Why is there no good recipe for tomato soup??!

Great recipe. I almost left out the cloves 'cause I didn't have any but then I remembered the pickling spices I recently bought and I picked out four big clove berries. It really is a crucial ingredient if you like traditional tomato soup. Next up: Grilled Cheeses. :)

I've made this a few times now and it's so easy, and so so delicious. The hardest part of it is removing the cloves afterwards!
I modified the recipe to make it vegan. I use veggie stock, and to thicken I use arrowroot powder instead of making the roux. Don't bother peeling and removing seeds, if you're going to use a blender afterwards. I followed the recipe, but I added; 2 bay leaves 2 cloves of garlic, some cumin seeds and black pepper. I use a stick blender after its cooked. First removing the cloves and bay leaves, then I blend it up nice with no lumps.  once it is almost blended I add a tablespoon of arrowroot powder while operating the immersion blender so there are no lumps. I usually eat the soup with a generous helping of nutritional yeast on top. Goes great with crusty bread or sandwiches. After blending the seeds are minimal at best, I don't usually have any in there and no skins. Technically you can add whatever herbs/spices you fancy. I like cumin so it always goes in there.

First time I made it exactly as given. Very good!
Second time a made to following alterations:
1) used chicken bone broth
2) added 1 Tbs. minced garlic
3) pureed soup instead of using a food mill
4) added water to restore volume to the volume at the start.
This made a very hearty soup.

Omg, this was pretty perfect for our first really cold day of winter! Even my kids who are not tomato eaters at all enjoyed it. Of course I did make grilled cheese sandwiches to dip in the soup, so I guessed that helped! None the the less, they did comment on how good it was and had seconds too! Instead of the food mill I threw everything into the ninja blender and threw very little away after I poured through strainer. Thank you so much for the delicious and simple recipe!

This was yummy, especially with grilled cheese sandwiches! I used canned diced tomatoes, though, so I'm sure it's even better with fresh tomatoes. I didn't add as much sugar as the recipe called for, and it was a bit on the sweet side. I plan to use the leftovers as pasta sauce. Will definitely make again! My husband commented, "This is WAY better than canned tomato soup!"

Quick and easy with no fuss.  I did not change anything in the recipe, though I expect that the 4 cloves meant 4 cloves of garlic and not 4 cloves....I think I am right - the taste is wonderful.  I do not have a food mill either - tried processing it through a sieve.  When it was clear that was not going to work, I just tossed it all in the food processor.   Since I like texture in my soup, this worked just fine.   I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical of the sugar, but it cuts the acidity nicely.  I only used 1 tsp.  This makes perfect amount for a bowl of soup as an appetizer to a meal...I am very pleased with the results of this quick and easy recipe!!

Great soup but even better the next day!! I followed the recipe but I put it through my blender rather than a food mill then pushed through strainer . For seasoning I didn’t have loved so I used 2 dash of ground cloves and 2 dashes  of cardamom  plus some fresh basil . Great flavor and texture the next day

Made it exactly like the recipe.  Nice simple fresh taste.  I never ate tomato soup because I had only had canned, but decided to make it for my husband.  New obsession!  End of the season, so I just bought 20+ pounds of tomatoes and will be freezing it!

Very fast and easy. We do not have a food mill so I used a Vitamix  instead. It turned out fantastic. Will be making this again.  This time I blanched and pealed the tomato's. Next time I think I'll just decore the Vitamix do the rest.

The only difference I did was to make this in a crockpot.  I used my abundant garden tomatoes (mine were bite size) and did not peel or dice. I put then on low for 6 hours and on high the last hour or so with the fresh basil.  I found it not thick as I wanted so after adding the roux I also added some tapioca flour to the soup until it thickened to my liking.  It was yum and eaten up by my 12 yr old as well as us.  Thanks for a great recipie.

Delicious! You don't taste the cloves, but they add just a little something. Toasting the flour in the roux adds something too. I used an immersion blender.  I didn't peel the tomatoes and it was fine. I do recommend  seeding them.  I gave 4 stars because some of my family thought it was too sweet. And everyone really liked it!

Nice base recipe, although I changed up the technique.  I skipped the cloves and roasted my garden tomatoes on broil for about 10 minutes, along with a half red pepper I had on hand. The skins peel right off.  Then I put them in the crock-pot with the broth. I sauteed the onion, along with a sliced carrot and stalk of celery in the butter.  Didn't add garlic, because I didn't want it to taste like spaghetti sauce (although I love garlic in almost anything!) After the veges were completely cooked, I added them back to the soup and used the hand immersion blender to blend everything.  I had fresh basil, so I chopped it up and added it shortly before serving.  We had this with grilled cheese, turned out great.

This was easy to fix and tasted good.  I doubled the recipe and used Cherokee Purple tomato's from my garden.  I used both the medium and fine blades on my food mill.  It was fine on day one and on day three.  If you want a thick soup, this is not your recipe.  It was not real thin; somewhere between thin and thick.  I will fix this again.

This is my favorite soup when I'm blessed with tomatoes from gardening friends. I love the simplicity, lightness, and sweetness of the tomatoes shining through. Thank you!

My mom HATES tomato soup and she ate half the darn pot. Will make for a third time! 

I used a hand blender (cuisinart smart stick) instead of a food mill because it's easier, and just strained out the bits of tomato skin as I added the tomato soup into the roux. I used about 1 cup - 1 & 1/2 cup of onion per 4 cups tomato, and I used red onion (about 1 & 3/4 cup) instead of white the second time making this, making a delicious modification to this soup. I also doubled the portions to feed about 4 people the second time around. Both times I added some dried chili flakes for a little bit of heat to add to the salt and sweet flavours, and it was glorious. 

6/5, great base recipe for you to add your own flair and make delicious tomato soup.

ommited cloves-don't like them but added a pinch of cinnamon and dried basil.  used vegetable broth from scratch like Lydia on PBS does-save veg scraps in freezer-used 1/2 large ziplock quart sized and boiled the scraps for 1/2 hour in 4 cups of water in place of chx broth.  strain .  added splash of milk at end.

This soup turned out really well. I kinda made my version of it though. I used my juicer for the tomatoes and then squeezed the rest of the juice out of the composite using a towel, blended the onions and garlic with a little Tomato juice and added 3 carrots (that i also used the blender for) and some chopped basil. I also left out the butter and flour.

I made the changes suggested by the first reviewer - adding basil, cayenne, balsalmic vinegar, etc. I used my immersion blender, too, so I left the skins on.  It was good, and very easy.

I was looking for an easy fresh tomato soup recipe, this is it! I did tweak it. I diced half  a large onion and two garlic cloves. Boiled some water and poured over four fresh garden tomatoes pulled off skin and chopped. I added two cups of water and two tsp of chicken bouillon. Boiled and simmered twenty minutes. I then took my immersion blender and finished shut off heat. I then melted two tlbs of butter and added flour, browned in sauce pan. I then added two ladles of tomato mixture and mixed back into soup I turned back on stirred in a cup of 2 % milk.
 Oh my so fresh, easy and delicious. Love it!

Made it just like the recipe - only I didn't have chicken broth - so I reconstituted a chicken bouillon cube in 2 cups boiling water.  If you do that - taste before you salt from the recipe and adjust as desired.   This was absolutely delicious!  I highly recommend this recipe!

This is a good, simple recipe, and I pretty much stuck to it, only I did add a little garlic, sautéing with the onion before adding the chicken broth to boil. I used my blender, as I do not have a food mill. I was skeptical about the cloves, but the flavor was mild and pleasant. I would make this again.

My 12 year old and I made this yesterday.  It was an easy to follow recipe and the results are wonderful.  We used vegetable stock in place of the chicken, added minced fresh basil to the top and one clove of garlic in with the tomatoes and onions.

The soup is fresh and summery!   It's great with crunchy bread or a grilled Swiss cheese sandwich.  We blended all the vegetables using a whole onion, not just a slice like some read the recipe as saying.  After making the roux, the tomato, broth, onion mixture was added along with the whole cloves.  After boiling and turning down to simmer to cook and meld the flavors, the cloves were removed as well as an added bay leaf.

This is a great soup, only suggestion I would make it try placing your tomatoes on the grill and brown the skins a bit, adds some depth to the soup.  Once you have had tomato soup this way you will  always want to make it fresh

I had a request from my 13 year old charge  for homemade tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches for dinner. Since it's been cold and rainy, all 3 of the children and mom agreed this would be perfect for dinner.  Everyone loved the soup, (including dad who had no say in the dinner choice) although the next time I'll double the recipe to have some for lunch!

Wonderful , hearty soup! I made slight changes based on other reviews, roasted the tomatoes (all I had were canned, chopped tomatoes) for about an hour, sautéed the onions w garlic. Once the veggies and chicken broth simmered (10 minutes),  I added a dollop of heavy cream to my serving. Absolutely fantastic and a hit with the whole family!!  FYI - I love  reading all the review before I make a dish, such great ideas!! Thanks again!

Loved this recipe. I didn't have cloves, and added coriander instead. I also didn't add fresh tomatos, I used Italian style canned tomatoes and uses the juices as well. I forgot to add sugar but it didn't need it.  I used my blendtec blender which didn't leave any chunks.  The consistency was perfect and I will definitely be making it again, especially because it was so quick and easy! I have seen other reviews that uses more ingredients but I honestly think this recipe is perfect as is.

I made this recipe and I'm not sure why, but it just tastes funky. I don't know if it's bad funky or good funky, but it does not taste like tomato soup. Now when I cook, I'm not a natural, I have to follow the recipe exactly as listed. That's what I did, and when the recipe says "whole cloves" I read that literally and added "whole cloves." Not sure if the recipe's author meant "garlic cloves"? ..and thus my funky flavored-tomato(ish)soup. Either way, I'll look for a different tomato soup recipe.

I used my blender stick for the first time! So easy. Instead of a rue, I made a thickening with 1/2 c. evaporated milk and the flour.

This was good tomato soup.  I questioned the use of cloves so didn't use them (this time).  Might try in the future.  Great way to use tomatoes from garden at the end of the season.  I added 4 garlic cloves, minced, and omitted the cloves.  I used an immersion blender at the end to make the soup more pureed..  Will definitely make again.

This recipe is by the far the best tomato soup I have ever had.  The clove makes all the difference in the world!  Even after it is refrigerated days after the taste continues to blend the flavor more and more. I have been looking and trying dozens and dozens of tomato recipes and this is the one to keep in the family! Everyone has loved it and my kids even ask for it....now that says enough in itself!  I have even posted it on my FB for other family and friends to try!

This soup was just what we needed in  cold and rainy fall day.  I don't have a food mill, so I put in in the blender to get the right consistency, and that worked really well.  I used gluten free flour mix for the roux and topped it off with some GF garlic croutons, grated parm and served it with grilled cheese sandwiches.  Perfect meal!  Thanks for the recipe!

So tasty!  I did add some crushed garlic, as some of the review suggested. I made a double + batch as I had a flat of fresh salsa tomatoes from my garden to use up.  I used the food processor to really break down everything after the initial cooking.  Only disappointing part was how much wasted pulp there is at the end of screening it.  I'll make it again, but not til next fall when the tomatoes are ready.

one yellow onion minced (used a knife, but next time I'll try a box grater), cooked down to a golden brown in bacon grease (couple of thick slices, eaten while waiting for the rest of the soup to come together); a pinch (or two) of ground cloves; heirloom tomatoes from my plants. herbs: basil, thyme, parsley, oregano. salt and crushed red pepper. No Sugar. No flour. I waited till the tomatoes and herbs were cooked down and added a pat of butter. You can blend at this point but it was pretty good chunky. I will use the soup for a base for minestrone and lasagna soup.

TERRIBLE. Soup cannot decide whether to be soup  stock with a hint  of tomato, or a hint of chicken broth. Just a pot of watery nothing.

Followed recipe as is, and other times incorporated several of the suggestions. Find I like the simplicity of the original recipe and simply using immersion blender makes it creamy enough I can forego cream and not miss it. Chopped fresh basil on each bowl served with grilled cheese sandwich is a forever hit. Oh, and definitely double the recipe if you can.

Delicious! I had to pick all my tomatoes because it's October and getting cold fast in Colorado. And this recipe was perfect. I doubled it and the only thing I added was 2 cloves of garlic. Thanks, Charlotte. Update -made this again today and added 1 tsp. dried basil. Very yummy!

Just finished making this soup with a mix of random  tomatoes from the garden.  I didn't have an onion handy so just used the dry  ones from the pantry  and tossed in some garlic.   It's such a simple recipe and so good!!    My Dad is on his second helping already before I even finish this review.    Looks like I'm going to have to pick more tomatoes :)   Delicious

Really easy recipe that yielded a creamy, tasty treat. I've never really cared for tomato soup but I didn't want the end of summer garden tomatos go to waste. Simple is usually the best and this is a keeper...Thanks

We used 2 bullion cubes with water instead of the broth. Too salty, so next time we will halve the salt. But we still ate it all! I dipped toast and sprinkled Parmesan on it. So so good!

This is a fantastic simple tomato soup. I add two cloves of garlic, too and I use just a pinch of ground clove as I do not have whole.

I'm a beginner and made this because I had too many tomatoes that were starting to rot. The first time I cooked this, I didn't have any onions or garlic so I subbed in ginger and it turned out not bad. I got really confused the second time I cooked this as I sauteed onions and garlic (as VIVIBO suggested), and added less ginger than before and the result tasted the same as without onion and garlic???? It still tasted great, but I guess I just wasted both the onion and garlic  >.>

DELICIOUS.  My 11 year old son loved it and so did I.  I didn't have a food mill so I used a cuisinart hand held blender and then strained it through a wire strainer. Perfectly smooth.  The cloves make the soup special.  My next door neighbor's tomatoes were put to a very good use!

Wish I had seen this at the beginning of tomato season - very good soup and I like it because there is no cream in it.  I did add garlic and bay leave. Cloves are a must!

I made this soup for the first time, as written, but doubled. The flavor was very good, though not as intense as I was expecting. Maybe that also depends on the tomato variety you are using. I think next time I will puree the soup with the skins and seeds and see if that adds a little more texture, as I found the soup lacking a little body. I would also increase the flour/butter amounts to make more thickener. I love it though and will make it again.

I don't have  a food mill so I peeled and de- seeded my tomatoes and chopped onion first, then used the blender to puree the mix... I also used ground cloves instead of whole.. It tasted delicious! So glad I found this recipe.. Thanks!

This was a good base, but I made several changes. I threw together  2lbs of cherry tomatoes, 1 chopped carrot, 2 chopped celery stalks, 1 chopped onion, 2.5 cups chicken broth, 3Tbsp fresh basil, 2Tbsp butter, 2tsp sugar, 3 garlic cloves into a blender and pureed. Cooked stove top for about 15 minutes before I added 1/4cup milk with 1tsp cornstarch to thicken it.  Also added 1 cup of shredded parmesan. I realize this is a significant departure from the original recipe, but these changes made it healthier with more vegetables, and the cheese really steps it up. I'll do it this way from now on. It was easy, quick, I was able to use whatever I had on hand, and yielded a delicious, filling soup. Served with grilled cheese on multigrain bread.

Made it using fresh tomatoes and a chopped whole onion. After I finished the first part, I let it cool in the fridge overnight and then used a mixer on it while I cooked the roux in a small saucepan. Added some tomato mixture to the roux then put the roux mixture back into the pot and heated it and simmered a few minutes. My husband sprinkled shredded cheddar cheese on it and loved the result. Next time I will saute' or mic the onions first to soften them more, although that's probably not important if a blender is used instead of a mixer. We loved the fresh tomato taste, and I look forward to trying some of the other comment ideas with canned tomatoes after the season ends.

I made this recipe with the ingredients exactly as they are listed. The only thing I changed is the process, which I think is much easier.  I cooked the tomatoes, onions, broth and cloves in my stockpot. Then I just used an immersion blender which worked great. In a small saucepan I melted the butter and flour and just added that into the stockpot. I used the immersion blender again to incorporated the flour and butter. Less mess and a little simpler.  Tastes like a simple tomato soup.

Very easy to make. A little too much cloves for my taste but definitely good. I did not put it through a sieve. Instead I put it in my Vitamix. Next time I will remove the cloves before blending.

This is so delicious. I did not use the cloves but added dried basil to it in the end. My 12 year old son loves it so much, he even asks for it for breakfast. I also cut up mozzarella into little pieces so it gets gooey in the soup. The basil and cheese make this a family favorite. Thanks so much for the recipe!

I doubled the recipe - added 2 cloves of garlic and used 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, did not add the sugar.  Used the hand mixer and strained it.  It had a creamy consistency  without the cream.  Not  bad.

Not usually a fan of tomato soup, this was outstanding in flavor!  I did add a bay leaf, thyme and oregano.  I used my blender and peeled the tomatoes ahead of time.  I am going to make more and freeze it for the winter!  Thank you for sharing!

Delicious recipe for all those end-of-summer tomatoes. Very quick and easy. I added some bottled Mrs. Dash Italian seasonings as well as ground clove (didn't have whole cloves).  I also added some Parmesan cheese and floated chiffonade of fresh basil on top when serving.

Here are some changes I made: 
Strain everything through a colander (onion, garlic, tomatoes) after boiling for 20 mins and cooling. Don't discard!

Take all that leftover good stuff and blend it. A Ninja blender works really well. Also add basil and a little extra onion and garlic.

I followed the recipe and boiled everything together, but seeing as I don't have an immersion blender or food mill, I strained the juice, made my roux, blended what was left and threw everything together!

I made this today with some fresh Roma tomatoes.  I added a splash of whole milk and about 2 Tbsp of extra butter to make it a little richer.  The sugar was not required. Everything else was the same.

Instead of straining etc. I simply used an imersion blender right in the pot.  The texture was not quite as smooth, but I loved it and would do the same in the future.

I doubled the recipe for three adults and two kids and there were hardly any leftovers.  Would definatley make it again!

This is a vey nice soup. I did peal my tomatoes before cooking them. I used 1/4 teaspoon cloves because I did not have whole cloves. After tomato and broth cooked for 20 minutes, I but it in my Ninja blender. Worked wonderful. When the soup was finished,  I added croutons and a little cream to decorate the soup.

I thought this was a great basic recipe. The flavors were fantastic (cloves were a good addition)-- the roux helped thicken the soup and also added a nutty flavor. I did add some tomato paste as the soup seemed to need even a little more thickening after adding the roux. Next time? I'll think I'll add some cream. And slice of onion? No. I added an entire onion and a couple of cloves of garlic. Also, I don't have a food mill. I blanched the tomatoes, discarded the skins, didn't worry about seeds. Put it all in my Ninja. Worked well. All in all, fine basic recipe -- just use your cooking senses as you put it together. A little of this, a little of that -- that's what creative cooking is about.

went perfectly the first time; in the soup I added a good amount of spinach when boiling for extra color and flavor and it tastes amazing ! very simple and tasty. Doubling the recipe is a good idea if your cooking for more than two :)

This really tastes like a bowl of hot ketchup as it's originally written. You should really consider leaving out the cloves and substituting garlic.  The cloves just really overwhelm all the other flavors.

I loved this recipie! I used canned crused tomatoes and the soup turned out alright. I didn't add any extra salt or sugar since the chicken broth made it salty enough.

The best tomato soup I've ever had.  Canned a bunch last year to send with twins going off to college - and getting ready to make more!

This soup tasted a lot like canned tomato soup, but just bumped up a notch. I like tomato soup, but it's just a little boring to me, both in flavor and texture. The cloves add a richness to the recipe, but not a whole lot of complexity. When I heat the leftovers, I will probably add something to make it a little more interesting. Perhaps a little spinach, or maybe diced fresh tomatoes, or a touch of feta cheese perhaps.
Bottom line: if you really adore canned soup, this is going to be awesome for you. If canned soup is something you enjoy when you don't have time or energy to make something better, then this might be a little bit of a disappointment. Still, I think it should be a universally pleasing and accepted soup, at least for Americans.

Tripled the recipe and added 1/2 cup of milk to the roux and it was a big hit with grilled cheese sandwiches.  Definitely a do-over.

I threw in an entire jalapeno for some spice. I also remove the cloves before processing because I find it's just too much of that particular flavor. Plus they don't process well for me.

I loved the flavors. 

Alterations:
Added 2 cloves of  garlic after lightly frying in 1 tbsp of olive oil. 

+ points: 
Extremely simple to make and I loved the flavor.

- points:
It definitely doesn't take just 35 minutes to make. The prep time is listed as 5 minutes and it takes me more than 5 min to chop 8 medium sized tomatoes. Also the 20 min cook time doesn't account for waiting for it to start boiling, blending, and adding the flour and butter.

Simple recipe with good results. I have an abundance of canned heirloom garden tomatoes. I had good luck substituting a quart of these. Almost as good as garden fresh. I did leave out the cloves as my husband is allergic to them.

I made with half fresh tomatoes and half canned roasted tomatoes drained.  Doubled the recipe, sautéed 4 chopped garlic cloves and 1 large onion chopped in olive oil.  Added the broth with all the tomatoes then gradually added the roux.  I also peeled the tomatoes before hand and then used a immersion blender.  SO GOOD!!!! 
PS not as much sugar as called for…..just a personal preference and  cayenne pepper for a little spice

Simple and basic.  
Cooked onion in olive oil and added  some garlic, too.  Then followed the recipe.
Added fresh basil chiffonade at the end of cooking time - all tomato soup should have basil :)

I made a batch and a half of this recipe because I only had 6 cups of tomatoes, instead of 8 to double.  I don't have a mill so just did batches of the entire thing in the blender.  Added 2/3 cup of half & half to cool down the batches.  Also added about a tbls garlic to the tomato mix.  At the very end added pepper cayenne and chopped basil. I will make this soup again but would do a cup of heavy cream in place of 1/2 & 1/2 and add more pepper.  The cloves were a nice touch.

I use this recipe as my base for making it in a slow cooker.  I double the ingredients and let it cook all day, and then blend with an immersion blender.  Make the roux last and blend it in too.  First time around I tried to follow the ingredients to the letter, now I'm experimenting with adding garlic.  The spice cloves are what make this soup so good.

Do not bother with peeling tomatoes or food mill.  Use a hand held mixer to blend.  Perfect for fresh tomatoes.

Love this recipe because it uses fresh tomatoes, no cans.  For the broth I even just boiled some chicken and used the broth from that...still turned out great! My husband and two year old both love when I make it.

This was a wonderful recipe. After reading the other reviews, I did tweak it a little. I used 1 whole white onion. I also sauteed 5 cloves of garlic in olive oil, added the onions until tender, and then the tomatoes until the mixture boiled about 5 minutes. Since it was already thick enough, I only used 1 tablespoon of flour, and added about 1/4 a cup of skim milk at the end. I also used fresh basil and crushed red pepper. It was a fantastic and healthy recipe that I will make again!

I suggested Grill Cheese sandwiches and tomato soup to my husband for a late snack, went to the pantry and didn't have my usual condensed tomato soup.  So, I searched AllRecipes.com for a substitute recipe for tomato soup.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes, I used diced and whole canned tomatoes, but followed the recipe precisely otherwise.  It was so smooth and creamy.  It was brilliant.  This soup tasted like a fancy French restaurant offering.  I don't think I'll use  canned soup ever again. Thanks so much for the recipe, it's forever changed how I think of tomato soup.

This was a delicious tomato soup recipe and super easy to make.  I used tomatoes from our garden and added a good amount of pepper to give it a little kick, which  hit the spot.  Topped it with some homemade croutons and a little crumbled bacon.

This is delicious but I found it a bit thin so I just used my submersible blender to this also was much easier. I did try to pick out the whole cloves first. I also added a bit of garlic. I have made this several times and frozen it. I usually make at least a double batch.

Great, healthy soup that is low calorie, low carb, low fat. Not as rich as the cream of tomato recipes, but still flavorful.  Added 2 cloves minced garlic so as not to overpower, and chopped fresh basil with some for garnish on top.  Left nutritious peels on and did not seed as when cooked and blended, all was blended. Used regular blender and left a little lumpy for texture.  Did not use hand blender as it did not seem it would blend the peels and seeds sufficiently.  Used 5 beefsteak tomatoes and 2 small chopped onions and recipe made about 5-6 cups.  Serve w homemade croutons and/or grilled cheese!

I made this last night and all I did differently was add basil and salt to taste, otherwise it was perfect! Putting the tomato/onion mix in a blender seemed to make the soup nice and creamy. Will definitely make this soup again!

Yep, would make it again.  Had no cloves, so made it without cloves... whoo boy did I look for them; but, alas no cloves; sure was curious about them. :-)
Also had to make it from diced tomatoes, gotta try fresh and see the difference, sure was good either way, adjusted recipe according to 3 cans 14.4c tomatoes.. more to eat; oh, and used chicken paste stock and used 1/2 and 1/2  2c + 1c milk instead of water from chicken stock if I'd had it.  Gotta tell you, this soup was delicious; and I think it's one of those recipes that's hard to get wrong. XD

I followed Vivibo's suggestion.  Didn't have fresh tomatoes, so used my sundried cherry tomatoes from this summer. Only used one clove, but next time will try two.  Excellent recipe!

I went with this recipe because I had very few ingredients and wanted some tomato soup and this really wowed me! I was surprised that such an easy and simple recipe could deliver such great flavour.  I fried the onions and added garlic. First time I made this I also roasted a pepper and added that while omitting the cloves.  Second time I made this I included the cloves and added a little cream. A great recipe that really lets you add whatever you feel like and have on hand! Five stars.

This soup is now on simmer on the stove. I picked fresh tomatoes out of the garden last night as the weather is changing. I do not own a food mill, but my immersion blender did the trick very well. The aroma is amazing, the tongue test was soothing. The only change I made was a few drops of olive oil along with the butter for the roux. I can hardly wait to dip a crusty bread into the divine dish. Thank you for a great, simple recipe.

Great flavors! I blanched the tomato in boiling water first to get the skin off, then I would use 6-8 cloves next time and also add garlic, pepper and other spices. Maybe some cream and definitely some cheese for the top.

Great taste, great way to use all those end-of-the season tomatoes. I didn't have whole cloves, so I just substituted a little grounded clove. Topped it with a little shredded cheese, and it was perfect. This is definitely a "make-again" recipe.

I am gluten free and paleo. I used 1/4 c coconut milk and organic non GMO corn starch mixed for the thickener. I used garlic flavored olive oil  to saute the fresh garlic I added 10 cloves and some chili pepper flakes. I used red onions because that was all I had. I shiffenaded some basil and tossed in at the end. For the sweetener I used 1 TBS of organic cane sugar I will try with Stevi next time but sometimes stevia leaves an aftertaste. I also added some cayenne after I tasted it. I peeled and seeded my tomatoes by coreing them and placing them in boiling water for 3 minutes and then an ice bath. IT WAS AMAZING with all the alterations !

For my first attempt at making homemade tomato soup this recipe was quite simple. I will omit the cayenne pepper next time, it was a tad too spicy for our taste. The texture and thickness of the soup was excellent and it was very delicious.

I made this recipe and followed VIVIBO's tips.  All of her tips were spot on.  I only changed the following: I did not double the recipe but I added one cucumber.  Delicious recipe.  Could not stop eating.  I used 5 fresh small farmers market tomatoes.  Just enough for me to have 2.5 bowls....yum :)

I really enjoyed this, even though I wasn't able to get rid of all the tomato seeds!  I think the clove adds something special.  Also put in a little chopped carrot.  Perfect for those over-ripe tomatoes at the end of the summer.

Followed the reciepe exactly (but omitted cloves as none in the hours). EXCELLENT.
I had a hungry  3 year old to feed and anything more gourmet than this doesn't get eaten. 
Thanks for the simple and easy to do receipe..

I quadrupled the recipe to serve 7 people and have lots left to freeze (Oh, I hope it freezes well!).  So easy to multiply the recipe and it was absolutely delicious.  I didn't blanch my tomatoes to remove the skins nor did I strain out the seeds.  I used a larger sized onion and lots of garlic.  Didn't use cloves.  Everyone loved it - even the kids.  The kids added milk to theirs to cool it down and make it creamy.

I thought I followed the recipe closely, but it wasn't that great.  I heated up some milk and poured it slowly into the hot soup and it tasted lots better to me.  Probably won't be making it again, I think I have another recipe somewhere.

I doubled the recipe as I had a lot of tomatoes to use.  I did not double the amount of sugar though. I did as another reviewer suggested and tasted after each addition of salt and sugar and found I only needed 2 tsp.  I also used margarine and soy flour because that's what I had on hand.  

I thought "cloves" meant garlic so I added the equivalent of garlic powder with a little olive oil and the onions to the stockpot to cook them a little bit before adding the tomatoes and broth.  Then realizing it was supposed to be cloves, I added a few dashes of ground cloves once all other ingredients were in the pot.  

After cooking as directed, I transferred the whole contents to a large mixing bowl.  I used my immersion blender since I don't have a food mill.  Now I really want a food mill because I felt like I found every seed or small piece of skin when I sampled the soup.  I have a flour sifter and I ran the soup through it, using a ladle to extract the liquid ( it was quicker than cranking it through).  

One of my least favorite things to do is make a roux but it's necessary to the consistency and probably the flavor as well.  

The flavor of the soup is very good.  No need to add anything else unless you want a spicier version.  It was easy to make as written but I made it a little more difficult using the sifter.  I was very happy with the finished product and would make it the exact same way I made it this time and still use the garlic (well maybe use fresh garlic and cloves

This was really good. I too don't have a mill, but I let it cool then put it in my blender & let it rip! Added back into the pot, followed the rest of the instructions. it was delicious. Next time I will double or triple and freeze for winter. Never use canned again.

I used the original recipe. I doubled the amount needed since I had a lot of tomatoes. I did use a colander with a bowl under net and empty the tomatoes in a strainer and squish out the juice. I set out two bowls with the juices aside. I add them in after I did the roux. It helped a lot.  I seasoned to taste afterwards. I set it to simmer for a few hours on the stove top so flavors can develop more. Great recipe. Key secret is to look at the produce reduction sale. I got 6 bags full of tomatoes at $1 a piece. Great way to budget and get ready for fall season. I stayed true to the recipe and will let you know when I adjust to different ingredients to it.  So try the original and then try it differently to your taste. Got to give an honest answer to the original before changing.

I sauteed the onion with some chopped garlic in olive oil, then added the chicken broth and tomatoes. I left out the cloves because I'm not a fan. Everyone enjoyed this, though one kid was not a fan of the texture. Next time I'll puree it some more.

This soup has turned out to be very delicious!  We had way too many tomatoes from our garden this season so I decided what we save some of this for the wintertime.  We used our whole cherry tomatoes,  figured the one slice onion met one whole onion and the "cloves", I think it meant garlic.  We doubled the recipe for canning and it turned out fine.  Now all we need is a cold winter day and some grilled cheese sandwiches.

I made a couple of changes, took out the cloves added garlic cloves instead, I roasted and pealed the tomatoes first. Added 4 Cups tomatoes and a shallot instead of onion, salt (pink himalyan sea salt) fresh ground white pepper and the chicken stock or broth bring to boil. Immersion blend, strain seeds out. While straining, start the rough, add tomato to  it gradually. Add sugar(coconut crystals) to sweeten a little. Serve, freeze, can.(with added acid from lemon juice or basalmic, or red wine vinegar) to prevent botulism

I followed the recipe exactly as written. Best tomato soup recipe I've come across in a while. Will definitely make it again and again.

Very easy recipe to make!  The fresh tomatoes from the garden made for such a flavorful soup.  I did double the recipe like other reviewers suggested.

I've been using this website for years and this is my first time leaving a review because it made me feel like  I can cook! We are not big on tomatoes so I usually do not buy too many at a time but when my mother in law gave me a bagful of them I came looking for a recipe and am so glad I found this one! Mine came out pretty thick so next time I will try without the peels but it was delicious regardless!

I used a blender and strainer like many people did.  this was great, but I really feel a little cream at the end would have made this.  I'm going to try again with cream.

I make this a little differently each time. The only time it turned out badly was when I used canned tomatoes, that was awful.  I usually add a pinch of red pepper flakes & less sugar.

I love tomato soup, but I did add ingredients to this recipe. Instead of cloves, I replaced with garlic. Added red pepper, garlic salt, and dried Italian seasoning to my taste. You could also add extra seperately in your bowl. It was so good! Made it about 4 times in the past year, but always make about 6 times this recipe and freeze whatever else I don't eat in ziplock bags. Take it out, thaw it, reheat it, and mmmmm! Update--06/2017--still love this recipe! I've made it 3 times in the last month. My boyfriend keeps wanting me to make it. We love it!

First batch I followed the recipe exactly. Delicious. Next, added some hot peppers we had in the garden.  Delicious. Next, cream for a creamy tomato soup.  Delicious. This is such a fantastic recipe that still adapts to variations and it has all been delicious. Looking forward to this years tomato crop.

Really, really good!!! I was craving grilled cheese and tomato soup, but didn't have any soup in the cupboard. I decided to hit allrecipes to see how hard it was to make from scratch. I didn't have any fresh tomatoes, but I had some canned. I used a 14oz. can of stewed tomatoes and halved the rest of the ingredients. I used about an 1/8th tsp of ground cloves, and used onion powder and a little garlic powder. I had a little leftover buttered popcorn from the night before, so I used that to add a little crunch. It was awesome. I will definitely be making this again.

So basic and easy that anyone can make it. I did tweaked it a bit, though. I hate cloves, so I added crushed fresh garlic instead and used powdered vegetable stock instead as I'm a vegetarian and fried it it with the onions and garlic. Then I added the tomatoes,  hot water and mixed herbs before simmering it for 20 minutes. Liquidized the whole lot, tomato skins and all. Making roux (or white sauce as we in South Africa call it) is one of my pet hates, so I added the butter to the liquidized soup, reheated it and added the flour to half a cup of water, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Just a word of advice : double the recipe. It's just to good and healthy not to indulge in large portions. Also serve with home baked bread. It's almost sacrilegious to desecrate such a lovely fresh, scratch-made soup with mass produced store bought bread.

I made this soup "as is" and it was wonderful.  Note: 1 slice onion is a typo. It should say 1 sliced onion.(which is shown in the video)  I used my Ninja blender to puree it and all the skins and seeds were broken down completely.  I did remove the cloves beforehand because they did not break down as well.  The second time I added about a Tablespoon dried basil after the rue.  This pairs well with grilled cheese.  The third time I added roasted red pepper instead of basil which tasted amazing!

This is my favorite tomato soup recipe. Perfect when you have all those tomatoes coming in and not sure what to do with them. I have tried MANY tomato soups, and THIS one is the BEST! I did make the changes Vivibo suggested.

Used garden tomatoes. Sauteed garlic and onion in olive oil then added the rest. Added 1/2 cup of heavy cream after I strained it. Double recipe next time. Boys loved it.

Hmm.  Did not have fresh tomatoes, so used two 28 oz cans diced tomatoes, and adjusted the servings to 9  (2 cans equaled about 6 cups, drained slightly).  Rest was made as written, although because of the canned tomatoes, did not add additional salt - definitely didn't need it!  Like others, the cloves confused me, but the video indicates cloves the spice, not garlic cloves, so I stuck with that.  (3 whole cloves = 1/4 tsp ground, for those who wondered.). Left the soup a little chunky, which we liked, but hubby and I both thought the clove taste was a little odd, and a little strong.  Will likely try this again, but will probably use garlic and basil instead of cloves.

This was my first time making homeade tomato soup, and it was well worth it! I had so many garden tomatoes left over this year I froze tons of them since I use them rather frequently.   I pulled out several freezer bags of my best beefsteak tomatoes and placed them in a bath a hot water.  The skins came right off.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I do not have a food mill so after cooking all together, I cooled the soup and then pureed it in my food processor until it was the right consistency.  I also added a little bit of heat with a few garden peppers, some garlic, and basil at the end.  It was by far the best tomato soup I have ever eaten. I ate a huge bowl of it before the bread I was making to go with it was even done.  Excellent recipe!

I love this recipe. It is so easy to make. I have a few tomatoes left from the harvest and had to use them up so I thought I would give this a try. I cooked the tomatoes with garlic and onion and after the 20 minutes as directed I used my immersion blender. I put all of that blended concoction into a sieve and worked it until it no longer had any liquid left in it. I only had tiny tomatoes so there were a lot of seeds but if i had large tomatoes I don't think I would even put it through the sieve. I did the rest as directed. The only thing I would question is the 6 servings. We only got 2 large bowls out of this so I'm not sure how you would feed 6 with this amount. Maybe my liquid reduced too much as the tomatoes cooked. I did add some cream I had to get rid of but I don't think you need to add cream or milk. It would be delicious as is.

Delicious and easy to prepare.  No need to use blender or food mill.  I removed skins from tomatoes by dropping into boiling water for only a few minutes.    Skin removes easily.  Once cool, I crush the tomatoes by hand.  Used ground cloves (few pinches), garlic powder and whole onion sliced in 1/2.  Before serving, I removed the onion.  Served with grilled cheese sandwich.  Delicious on a chilly autumn day.

I've never made tomato soup before, but it seemed the perfect accompaniment to grilled cheese sandwiches today. I was in the grocery store, quickly googled  'homemade tomato soup' recipes, looked for the top rated soup on my favorite site, and started shopping for what I needed. I came home, started the soup immediately, and prepped for the sandwiches. I don't have a food mill, so I threw everything in my Vitamix and blended to smithereens.  I doubled the recipe, and made a few modifications, namely two cloves of garlic, a pinch of toasted ground cumin, and a pinch of curry powder. I also added a few dashes of white balsamic reduction, and a splash of half and half cream when served. The soup was divine. 
I'm rating this a five due to ease of preparation, simplicity of execution, and the fact that the soup tasted really good on its own. I also love that it's so basic that it allows for any modification you can think of. I'm already dreaming up what I can do to it next time. A definite keeper. 
The sandwich was inspired by Jamie Oliver's comfort cooking - grilled cheese sandwiches with a 'spicy cheese crown'. To die for!

This was garden fresh goodness and sooo easy to make.  I took some reviewers advice and just used the immersion blender to mix it all together - skins, seeds and all and then add it to the roux.  DELICIOUS!!!

I blanched and seeded the tomatoes before I read the reviews that it is not necessary so next time I will not go thru the work. I sautéed the onion and garlic before adding the rest and did not have whole cloves so used 1/2 tsp ground cloves. I thickened with corn starch and chicken broth after taking the stick blender to the soup then added fresh basil and oregano.  It is good soup. I fear that the variety of tomato matters as I did not find it as rich as I was hoping for.

Change NOTHING about this recipe at all!  It is perfect just as it is! I used all heirloom tomatoes from the garden:  "Cosmonaut Volkov," "Black Sea Man" and "Black From Tula"--all from Ukraine; "Ninevah" from Mosul, Iraq; and "Dutchman" and "Amish Paste" from the US.  These heirlooms made the soup very flavorful and savory.  This recipe is great!

Great way to use those fresh tomatoes. I did skin and seed the tomatoes first. I doubled the tomatoes and added more cloves of garlic. I also  some fresh cream.

I just made this, doubling, with 6# of tomatoes - I didn't use cloves and like another person, I used chopped carrots instead of sugar and I also added 6 cloves of chopped garlic ...it was really good and the roux made it even nicer - freezing it and looking forward to fresh tomato soup in the middle of winter!  I think dill or basil would be a nice addition at the end.    Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Modified recipe to fit with my diet.  Added garlic, fresh oregano and basil, and a few red pepper flakes.  Eliminated butter, flour salt and sugar.  I used Black Krim garden tomatoes.  Thickened with 1 T corn starch.  Used stick blender to blend up seeds and peels.  Nice rustic soup.  Oh, added a small amount of chicken base.  Put the cloves in a tea strainer, as others have.  Ate with garlic french bread.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed the directions to the letter and the "soup" was awful! Not a hint of tomato taste and to be honest, I could not identify exactly what it did taste like. I used fresh tomatoes out of my garden which are delicious and full of flavor and all the other ingredients were fresh.

Delish! I followed VIVBO's suggested changes and I did not use cloves as didn't have any on hand. I served with a dollop of plain 0% yoghurt as it is quite peppery with the cayenne. I did not add any sugar.

VIVIBO has the right idea. Don't waste all the veggie goodness! Just blend it. It was very good as VIVIBO altered it. I stopped at blending in the roux and just stired in the fresh basil at the end!

I get a lot of tomatoes and I hate to waste them! I've made this so many times and I love it. I have made it with the butter and flour but I prefer it without those additions. I use about 1/3 tsp ground clove instead of the whole cloves but otherwise follow the first part of the recipe exactly. Once the tomato/onion/clove /broth mixture is cooled I put it through a blender and store it in the fridge in jars. I love it cold! I know, I'm weird, but it is fantastic!

I tripled this and just blended it in a blender rather than food mill. It was delicious!  I set it out with a variety of toppings: Parmesan cheese , mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, parsley, red pepper flakes, olives, half and half, etc!  My family just loved it! :). I left out the cloves and added garlic, instead!  I was able to use up my abundance of fresh garden tomatoes with this recipe and we will be making it again!

This is a very rich soup, but so good. Using the recipe "list" adds only six tomatoes. I chose six large tomatoes and it really was only enough for 3 people, so use your best judgement in expanding the recipe. I had great results by skinning my tomatoes (core, x bottoms, boil, ice bath, peel), and by using an immersion blender (mine is a $60 KitchenAid 2 speed KHB1231 model, which was perfect). Using a food mill is nice, but it really strips even more of the soup's substance (I milled the soup first, but it yielded pretty thin).  After adding soup in spoonfuls to the roux, I used the immersion blender one last time, which provided a very consistent creaminess. Food for thought... Enjoy!

This soup was amazing. This was the first time I had single handedly made something all by myself, and it was a huge hit. I had no chicken broth though, so I had to use 2 cups of water combined with 2 tablespoons of butter to use as 2 cups of chicken broth substitute. Even then, the soup was great. I do plan on making this dish for many years to come.

This was an amazingly fast easy way to use up garden fresh tomatoes! We modified the recipe just a tad by adding sautéed garlic and two tablespoons of pesto. Tastes great garnished with sour cream too!

Yummy.  I used a Foley food mill which worked great to remove seeds and peels. I used one onion sliced (not one slice) as the video version of this recipe showed.  Thankful to find a good way to use our bumper crop of tomatoes.

I didn't have that many tomatoes, so I used two 28 oz. cans peeled, Italian tomatoes- one drained. I also added about 1/2 cup of heavy cream at the end with the fresh basil and it was very good!  Even my sister who isn't crazy about tomato soup thought it was really tasty! This will be so good this winter on those cold nights when I'm craving a hot bowl of soup!

Absolutely delicious.  Forget the the roux and the whole cloves.  Ground cloves work just fine.  In fact, they really enhances the flavor of the soup.  I used canned San Marzano crushed tomatoes, added a bay leaf, cayenne pepper, nutmeg, herbes de Provence, butter, some cream and chopped basil to finish.  Divine!

I didn't have all of the fresh tomatoes so I used a mix of 2 cans of diced tomatoes and the rest fresh. No cloves so added fresh garlic and a few more slices of onion. It was awesome! Didn't have to double recipe for my family of 4 and we had some left over. Thank you!

I had tomatoes that were pn their way to being used for something else when I had a taste for  soup.  I like that this soup is totally natural, having used fresh tomatoes and organic broth.  Half a recipe was plenty for one person.  How  much easier can it get to prepare a healthy, light and tasty meal ? The next time, I will add croutons, which I love.  Did not pay attention to the photo

Delicious!!! Added garlic, used the juice of the tomatoes and used less chicken stock.  I also added a cup of half and half cream and red pepper flakes.

I made this with frozen greenhouse tomatoes from the summer.  Made as written and doubled it.  It was really good.  Had to have seconds and so did hubby.  I may toy with it in the future because I have a freezer full of tomatoes. Oh I removed the skins, and used an emersion blender.

This soup is delicious !!!
I spiced it up a little with black pepper and also added basil. I like the hint of clove in this tomato soup.

Like most cooks and most of the people posting feed-back, a recipe is a guide. This one is a doozy. Since fresh tomatoes are not available and store-bought are just plain awful (except the Kumato ... very good), I used a 90oz can of San Marzanos with great success! I won't go in to other deviations, I just thought I'd recommend that one in particular.

A very good basic tomato soup.  I have a love-hate relationship with my food mill.  Hate using it; love the results.  It kept all of the seeds and skins out of the soup.  Can't imagine getting the same results with a blender or infusion mixer.  The soup would be better with the addition of garlic and basil.

As written it was fine.  We ate it.  My husband liked it but it can be better.  Now I make tomato soup all the time but it goes like this: 30oz tomato sauce, 
24oz tomato paste, 
32oz broth, 
onion & garlic to taste.  Simple and so, so good.  Add a grilled cheese and dinner is served.

I agreed with one reviewer's tweaking of the recipe. It came out great and will be added to my rotation! Did not actually add the balsamic, but will try next time. Excellent, satisfying and sophisticated.

I used holy trinity instead of just onions, and also added mushrooms and carrots. Whole milk instead of cream, and to cut the acid, instead of sugar, I put a pear in with the vegetables. Worked perfectly !! My additions took it a bit too far to still be called tomato soup, but it is an excellent creamy vegetable bisque !
I love winter. Soup weather is the best weather !!

Good stuff. On its own, it is a little bland, so I added a couple tbsp. of garlic powder and about a tsp of cumin (basically both to taste). To me, the recipe needed very very little tweaking.

I made this soup according to the recipe but I used garlic instead of cloves because I didn't have any at my house.  It was delicious and I loved the simplicity of it.  You can tweak as many on here did but I thought it was great as is.

Very good! So much better than canned and easy! I didn't bother to peel the tomatoes and I added garlic for extra flavour.  I let everything simmer for 20 minutes and then used a hand blender to break it down.  I removed the 4 whole cloves. Then added to the roux.

I tried this recipe yesterday.  If I understand it correctly, it calls for 1 slicED onion, which is what I used.  And cloves--It doesn't say garlic cloves; so I used cloves.  The result is quite an unusual taste.  Not to my, nor to my husband's liking.  Won't try this recipe again.

I used this as a start for a recipe and we loved it. I just used an emulsion blender since I don't have a food mill. I also added garlic when it was boiling and added 3/4 a cup of milk to the butter and flour mixture before adding the tomatoes back in, it made it a bit creamer. My hunny loved it so much I made it for lunch and he requested it for dinner

I thought the flavor of this was just okay and also, mine was seriously "bright orange." To make the recipe quicker, I just put everything in my Vitamix blender on the soup function after sauteing the onions in the butter. Only change I made was using a couple small pinches of allspice in place of the cloves, so it easily blended. I got about 6-7 servings and took quite a bit of tomatoes. I would consider halving the recipe, if making for 1-2 people. I have a lot leftover. No one seemed to love this soup, but at least it used up some tomatoes that were about to expire anyhow.

I had some tomatoes from the garden that were about ready to go when I came across this recipe. Wow. Super easy and it is delicious. This winter when the tomatoes in the grocery store aren't too good I will use canned San Marzano tomatoes.

Loved the recipe.  I did add fresh garlic at the beginning and fresh basil at the end.  served with open faced baguettes topped with cheese. This recipe is easily mulitplied and canned if you have a bunch of tomatoes ready for processing!  My kids asked if I could put some in jelly jars when canning.  They love the soup in their school lunches!

It tasted like fresh tomatoes, which is a good thing, but it was pretty watery. For some reason it has more acidity than other tomato soups which didn't make my tummy very happy. I think it's just a personal preference thing. I won't make it again.

This was really good!  I've never made homemade tomato soup before but having time on my hands and an abundance of tomatoes in the garden, I thought I'd try it. I did add about a cup of heavy cream and about two tablespoons of tomato paste. This is a recipe you can easily tweak to your liking.

Very nice recipe. I plan on doing at least one caner load of this soup. Quadrupled the recipe. Skipped the sugar, added garlic. It was a pre-meal appetizer at a family function, and they practically licked the pot clean.

This soup is wonderful and easy. It's a perfect 'end of summer season taste' with a hint of autumn from the bit of clove. It's just two of us, so I used one big can of San Marzano tomatoes and 2 cups of well-seasoned vegetable stock, blended with cooked sweet onions and garlic and real butter. Seasoned to taste with S&P and dash of ground clove. Delicious! My veggie boyfriend loved this with thick grilled cheese sandwich. Cozy...

Wow! This soup is great. I used tomatoes and onion from the garden in a very very rough chop, a few pinches of ground cloves, and vegetable broth. I also made my roux vegan and gluten free by using gf flour and olive oil. I also do not have a mill so I used an immersion blender and a strainer - worked perfectly. Restaurant quality soup for sure. My only addition was a generous sprinkle of red pepper flakes before blending, but I'd leave that out next time even though I love spicy food - this soup doesn't need it! :)

It had good flavor. I made it really quickly and didn't have a way to smooth it so it was chunky but good.

I doubled the recipe and added basil, oregano and a pinch of cayenne. It was very tasty, but it wasn't quite as good as the tomato basil soups I've had in restaurants. However, I realize this version is much healthier without the added heavy cream and lots of butter. I would make this again as it was a good use of garden tomatoes.

I added the tomatoes whole, used generous helpings of vidalia onions. Used 8 red bell peppers, one can of condensed milk in place of other milk products. Used a hand held in pot processor (not sure the accurate name). I let it simmer and slow cook for about 5 hours. It turned out delicious. My 19 year old daughter has already attacked it 3 times and it is only 11am in the morning.

This recipe was very time consuming for little yield.  I also should have left the clove out completely or halved it b/c it was VERY overwhelming :(  I won't be making this again....

I do not own a food mill, so I used our blender, then put the mixture through a strainer.  Then, I have to admit, I forgot step #2 completely (I know, I know), and it was SUPER yummy!  Oh, I also added pepper.  But, I add pepper to everything.  

So, I deleted the sugar and butter and flour.  Maybe next time I'll actually follow the entire recipe.

I followed the recipe pretty much exactly and was very pleased with the results.  I used Campari tomatoes, and did add a Tbsp of tomato paste.  The key to this recipe is the butter/flour roux. I might double this next time because it added such nice richness and flavor to the recipe!

I have always enjoyed tomato soup as a kid.  I still enjoy it to this day and my son has a real fondness for it as well.  I am moving in the direction of less processed foods and so when I saw this recipe I was indeed hopeful.  This soup did not disappoint.  I had to use canned tomatoes, diced is all I had available.  I sautéed the onion and garlic in a little olive oil, added the tomatoes, chicken stock, and cloves, as directed.  Included a couple bay leaves and brought it all to a boil.  I removed the bay leaves and cloves, Blended the tomato mixture in my vitamix and strained it through my mesh strainer.  I made the roughe (sp) added the tomato liquid, some brown sugar, and a little basil.  I added a little milk to my bowl and ladled in my soup.  My son was very happy and so was I.  I didn't think salt was necessary, plenty of flavor.

My family all enjoyed this.  We made as written, however, I had to used canned tomatoes - I like Hunts whole tomatoes - I used 2 cans per recipe but needed to increase the sugar and salt a bit.  Even with canned it was yummy.  I used a submersion blender and did not bother to use the food mill OR make the roux - just cooked as directed, blended with a hand blender, and put it on the table.  Very good!!

This soup is awesome! I sauteed the onions and garlic for about 10-15 minutes before adding the tomatoes and the broth. I didn't have fresh tomatoes, so I used two cans of whole peeled tomatoes, chopped them, and used the broth from one of the cans. Added cream at the end. I didn't add the cloves.

I made the soup as written and it's delicious. I ordered Fire roasted tomato basil soup at Caraba's that was incredible. Next time I will roast the tomatoes and onions prior to boiling. and add some red pepper flakes when I blend to add a little heat.

I had lots of garden tomatoes this year. I made this a LOT. Not just for grilled cheese, but as a basis for all kinds of recipes. I put a bunch of my tomatoes in the freezer and I'm still making this in December! 
I like to add a little bit of 2% milk to it at the end to give it a little creamy taste when I use it as a straight soup for grilled cheese.

i enjoyed this recipe, though i must admit i found the clove a bit much...i will leave that out next time.  i also added a little bit of half and half because it just wasnt creamy enough...not a lot of half and half, maybe a 1/4 cup (i didnt measure :)  I also added some garlic and basil, because i love to add them to almost everything :)  very good...thank you!

This is a really good, basic, tomato soup!  It also has a slight buttery taste to it which I love.  Last year I happen to come across this recipe, and made several triple batches of this soup.  Just within this week, I made 5 quadruple batches, which I shared some with my daughters, and plan on freezing the rest.  I also made another soup from this recipe, a meatball-rotini vegetable soup.  It was quite delish!   I did make a few slight changes to this recipe though, and if making a single batch, I added 1 more tablespoon of butter and flour, as I thought the soup needed to be a little bit thicker, plus I cut back on the amount of salt, and only added a 1/2 teaspoon.  The recipe states to add 1 slice onion, and I found one 4-oz. onion is the right amount for this soup.  Charlotte, thank you so much for posting this recipe. This recipe is great for those who want to use up the numerous tomatoes they have in their garden.

Very good soup.  Nice tomato flavor and easy to make.  My husband had it as is, I added a little milk to mine.  Great both ways.  No more store bought tomato soup in our house.  We are making our own from now on.

Very good!  I used an immersion blender to mix everything up (not a food mill).  I took out the cloves BEFORE I blended it!  It still had the clove flavor in there which I thought was perfect.  I added a couple tablespoons of half and half and dried basil to taste.  I will make this again!

THIS IS  MOST DEFINITELY THE MOST DELICIOUS TOMATO SOUP I HAVE EVER TASTED. The smooth refreshing taste of the tomatoes come alive with a satisfying flavor that leaves you with a desire for another serving. Simply wonderful soup. Thanks for this recipe. Jim Matheson

Great recipe.  I love the fresh taste of the tomatoes.  Do not expect it to taste like canned tomato soup because it doesn't.  Im so glad to have another recipe to use for my garden tomatoes.

Made this with my abundance of tomatoes. It was great! My dad said it was the best soup he has ever eaten. I did substitute ground cloves since I did not have whole. I looked up substitution ratio online.

This was my first time making tomato soup - I'll never go back to the canned stuff again!  I did what others had suggested and added some cream (actually evaporated milk to save some fat & calories) into the roux.  It was fantastic!

Simple,l but you must use te cloves. That's the star of thus show.

With an abundance of tomatoes from my garden, I made this recipe for the third time today. I always add two cloves of garlic. This time, after straining, I added fresh sweet corn sliced from three micro-waved ears. The corn provided appealng color and texture and made for a heartier, more filling soup.

I had a few ripe tomatoes and cooked them up and put them in the fridge then the next day looked up something to do with them and came upon this recipe.  Since my tomatoes were already cooked, I made the roux and added onion powder to it to make up for not cooking onions with the tomatoes.  Otherwise, I did not change the recipe.  It was fantastic!  My husband not only liked it, it ate the leftover bowl the next day and he NEVER  eats leftovers.  Guess I can't say that anymore.

We tried this last night.  I imagined someone made a typo & left the "d" off sliced onion.  Cloves were an excellent choice for flavor.  I'll be freezing extra plum tomatoes for winter tomatoe soup & grilled cheese.  Thanks for sharing.

This is light and very easy to make. I did not add any salt at all as I felt the broth had enough in it. I also did not add any cloves in it. Instead of onion I used dried chives (what I had on hand) and it still turned out great.

I'll be making a big batch of this and then freezing for those cold rainy or winter nights that soup is just what you want.

This recipe is so Fantastic! The truth is I was missing some of the ingredients, choose not to add ginger as it sounded strange to me and quit franky threw this together in a frazzled hurry using canned crushed tomatos. Boy was it easy and SO delicious! I will be sticking with this recipe anytime I want tomato soup.

Well I used 1 whole onion sliced up-not just one onion slice-don't think I would of liked it that way.  Tried it with Garlic CLOVES and whole CLOVES.  Both good.  Be sure to fish them out  though at the end.  I used submersion blender but the peels wouldn't blend so I will try peeling tomatoes next time! I don't have a food mill. Tasted great!!

This is a great basic recipe for getting the tomatoes out of the garden and into a soup.  I added extra seasonings to suit my family's tastes.  It lends itself well to "seasoning  creativity".  I also added a bit of heavy cream for more richness.

This was really good- I took the suggestion of lightly sauteing the onions and garlic first before adding broth and tomatoes.  I also added 1oz of homemade pesto- it was perfect.

I gave this recipe only 4 stars because I didn't really care for it as written.  I do however think it's a great base recipe.  I took suggestions from others and doubled the recipe, reduced the cloves by 1/2, added garlic, dried basil, cream cheese, and then topped with shredded sharp cheddar.  The pot was empty before dinner was over and the kids were asking for more!

Wow I just made this and it is great!  Didn't have cloves so added some crushed garlic. Sweated onions and garlic in a stick of butter then added the stock and canned tomatoes. Took everyones advice and doubled the recipe. Made the roux and for kicks and giggles threw in the 2nd half stick of butter to melt into the resulting gorgeous pot of soup. Very good flavor. Didn't need salt or the sugar

I used fresh tomatoes from the farmer's market in season (August). It was good. I think I might go down on the cloves next time.  I also did not add the salt, since I used chicken bouillon cubes and those already tend to be very salty.

I used organic tomatoes...and even with them, I felt the soup needed a little more flavor. But, I'm not quite sure what I could've added to give it that extra oompf I was looking for.

Instead of cloves, I used allspice, star anise, oregano, and a bay leaf in a soaking bag.  I've added a little fish sauce, xiaoxing wine to the broth and garlic cloves.    Then blended the mixture and followed the. This has made for a really nice tomato soup!

This is wonderful soup.  I'm growing two extra tomato vines just to keep me in garden fresh tomatoes.  I have tweaked it a little but it is delicious as is.  It is very easy to make and does not heat up the kitchen.

Very good.  This was easy & tasty.  I used canned tomatoes & added a little dried basil.  Also, I don't have a food mill, so picked out three of the cloves and then blended with a hand blender.

This was the first time I've ever had tomato soup because I was always afraid I wouldn't like it. It was really good. Def will make again. I followed the recipe exactly except I ran out of fresh tomatoes. 2 cups were fresh and the other two were canned stewed tomatoes with a bit of flavoring. I used 1 tsp of sugar but it would have been fine with 2. I also used an entire onion because I didn't know if the recipe literally called for one slice of onion, or one onion sliced. Came out great using the whole thing. Lots of flavor. The color wasn't as red as the picture (it was kind of orange btw which didn't matter. Just fyi). Really good!

I live in japan for 2 years and while I'm not a big canned soup person, my wife would always beg me to buy some cans from the import store when we would pass. $2 for a can of soup is a hard pill to swallow. I came across this recipe and with the local farmer nearby having tomatoes nearly year round, I had a great alternative. It's easy to make and was a fantastic way to use cheap tomatoes. This is a great recipe for 2 people, but if you had more you would need to double it. I personally like mine with basil, my wife likes sour cream and a piece of grilled cheese :)

This was the best Tomato Soup I've ever had. I'm not a huge fan of tomatoes either. I actually blended the soup after it was finished simmering in my Magic Bullet and it blended everything sooo well! Not chunky at all. Also, at the end when letting it finish heating, I stirred in a few dollops of leftover mashed potatoes I had in my fridge. Delicious!

I don't eat tomato soup but my husband wanted some today since it is cold outside. Didn't add the amount of sugar or salt that it asks for and when I was done I sprinkled a little parsley on the top and... OMG this was good. I know because I actually ate it!! I know gasp... It was really good. Does not serve 6 though (with my husband around). I had a bowl and my hubby is in the kitchen licking the pot asking for more after his 5 servings of this soup. REALLY really good.

I followed the recipe to a T, including the 4 whole cloves, and used an immersion blender instead of a food mill. It came out sensationally! Much better than any canned soup. My boyfriend didn't like the cloves (next time I think I'll take the cloves out before pureeing), but he added some celery salt and dried basil and loves it. Thanks Charlotte!

Very good! I also took the advice of others. I added canned tomatoes since I didn't have any fresh ones. I also added one can of tomato condensed soup, a cup of water and 1 tsp oragano and basil, in addition of 1/2 tsp of cayanne since I like things spicy. I also pureed the tomatoes, garlic and onions after sauteing the garlic and onions and simmering the tomatoes. After the puree, I added the stock, condensed soup and simmered for another 20 minutes. At the very end I added the sugar and about 1/2 cup of milk. Yummy!

Fabulous! As another member suggested, I used vegetable broth and I added basil. Everyone loved it, even the skeptics.

I doubled the recipe and I tried the soup as the recipe stated up until the thickening process.  It tasted good enough but I decided to add some other ingredients.  I found I wanted a more tomato punch so I added 2 tbsp of tomato paste.  I also added some fresh basil at the end of the cooking time and a clove of garlic to the onion/tomato/broth mixture.  I didn't thicken the soup I left it as it was and it was a very nice fresh soup.  I gave it 4 stars only because I added other things but the soup as written is very good as well.

I used tomatoes fresh from the garden but this soup was too bland.  There just wasn't much flavor.

This was yummy. I followed the directions really closely. I did add some chopped frsh basil and half&half. I will have to modify it a little next time so that it will be to my children's liking. They LOVE the canned tomato soup.

This is delicious. I added one whole chopped onion, a clove of garlic, some basil and parsely and a bay leaf. After it was cooked,we ran it thru the squeezo. I skinned,deseeded and chopped up a large tomato to make this a more rustic type soup. My husband and I loved it!

I didn't like this that much...It is very healthy and delicious, but not any soup I'd be dying to eat. I would say, it's packed with health and flavor, but it just wasn't one of those recipes that I was so excited to eat that I wanted to eat tons of servings of it! Still, it was very nice, but I will point out that it's not as good as the classic tomato soup....

I wouldn't say it's the best but it sure is good! only thing I added was mince garlic,(garlic goes with EVERYTHING) kinda reminded me of tomato gravy which I think I may turn the leftovers into. Good soup to make especially with the 'Darra's Famous Tuna Waldorf salad fixing's on this same site. Give it a try.

This turned out really good, I wasn' in the mood for cooking and had some bread and cheese and wanted to make some grilled cheese formy 4 and 3 year olds. I had some chicken stock that was left from the night before and added some tomato sauce to give it more flavor, and instead of throwing the tomato mixture away i blended everything together it was rich and flavorful!

Great recipe! I'm preparing to make another batch now to use up some of the last tomatoes from my plants. I did think it was a bit too salty, so I'm going to cut back on the salt this time. Otherwise, wonderful!

I used a homemade vegetable stock instead of chicken broth. And before I added the chicken broth I cooked in the roux. That made it more of a condensed soup. I froze it and when I was ready to eat, I added the vegetable stock and it was great! I also added a few shells, garlic, onions, and cilantro. It was great over a little rice for lunch at work.

Very good. I sauteed the onions and some garlic in margarine first before adding the tomatoes and broth. I used homemade veggie broth with condensed chicken broth added in. (I boiled some carrots and potatoes, saved the water, and added the veggies in at the end.) Mother and boyfriend liked it =)

Very good soup. The cloves add a different but nice flavor. I made 4 batches and canned it.  I followed all the ingredients exactly.  I have a food mill, but didn't want to mess with it, so I put it in the blender and through the strainer.  Turned out great!

goodbye canned tomato soups, (not being a fan of them anyway) this soup was so easy, and it tasted liked I had slaved for hours, as I always have an over abundance of tomato in my garden, I picked away, also picking some salsa peppers and bell peppers to experiment with the recipe, just to add a kick. It's a hit! My wife will be pleased!

The taste was absolutely wonderful- but the leaving the seeds and skin in made for some pretty gross crunchy texture. If I would have seeded and skinned the tomatoes, it would have been wonderful. I added leftover rice from Chinese food and it was perfect!

This was good.  I like that it has a very fresh taste to it, but I don't think it's worth making again.  HOWEVER, I must admit that I followed other reviewers advice and added italian spices to it.  That made it taste like a runny spaghetti sauce instead of tomatoe soup.

This was so good and so simple. I did however only put 1/2 onion since they were strong onions and I used chicken broth w/vegs.& herbs instead of the plain chicken broth. But this was fantastic and was a great way to use up some tomato before they go bad.

First time making homemade tomato soup. WOW! It was so easy, and delicious.  I did not have the onion, fresh cloves, but I did have two large ripe tomatoes that made the four cups that it called for, and the other basic ingredients.  I did add to my serving 1 tsp of Pico Pica hot sauce. I will of course try it again with the cloves and onion.  I do not have a mill so in the blender it went and through a strainer.   Goodbye Campbell's.

Best Tomato soup EVER.

I added fresh basil and garlic to step 1 and some pepper at the end.  Other than that this recipe is perfect as is.  I love tomato soup and have tried various recipes and this one is the BEST I've had so far!  Definitely a keeper for our large tomato crops every year!!!

Good Soup!  I used vegetable broth instead and add garlic.  I think the clove is a nice touch.

This was a good vegetable soup. We added frozen "vegetable soup mix" veggies. None of us liked the clove taste though. I would say that unless your family specifically likes cloves, leave them out. We will next time for sure.

Very good.  Had plenty tomatoes in the garden. Made it today for a lunch I went to.  Added a cup of cream and snipped chives, basil and flat-leaf parsley at the end.  Also made crusty bread to go with it.  Both disappeared in no time.

Quick & easy - good taste.  It is not tomato season, so I used my own canned tomatoes pureed in the blender and they worked great...although I'm sure fresh would be fantastic!  Thanks!

Soup was okay... very bland even with added salt. Added some green onions to the mix. When it was done, topped with cheddar cheese and Tabasco and still found it bland.

I had several roma tomatoes that were getting soft in the fridge, so this was the perfect recipe to use them up. It was sooo tasty, and I liked that the recipe does not have heavy cream.  I added basil and black pepper to the tomato mixture instead of cloves.

I did not have a mill so I relied on my blender and strainer to blend my soup up. This did require some time to get the end results but I was okay with that. I also made the soup the night before and let it stand in the fridge over night hopefully absorbing all the flavors of herbs added. I reheated the next day and made the necessary adjustments of salt and sugar. The kids were not impressed with it due to the fresh difference of fresh garden tomatoes over the can of cheap soup. The hubby and I love it however and froze gallons of it in single serving portions. This is a great labour of love and looking forward to it come the cold spell. Thanks for sharing.

A great base. I omitted the cloves and added beef broth instead of chicken. I also added in 3 cubed turkey sausage links, 1 small cubed zuccini, 1 tsp garlic powder, rosemary, thyme, sea salt, and pepper. Oh momma! It was excellent!

Excellent!  Exactly what I was looking for. Being vegan, I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, and used vegan margarine instead of butter.
I peeled the tomatoes before chopping them, and I removed the whole cloves before passing the mixture through the blender.
I'll be making this often!  So delicious.

The best recipe! I tried a few, but this one is my favorite just because it's so easy and uses fresh tomatoes, which tastes much better than using canned ones. For an all-vegetarian version, use vegie broth instead of chicken. The only thing I changed was putting 2 cloves of garlic through a press. For variety and texture, I sometimes chop up a carrot and some celery and throw it all in the blender like I would normally. Tastes great!

Very tasty but a bit strong/acidic.  I ate it with sour cream to tone it down.  Probably wouldn't make again.  It's possible I just don't like tomato soup that much...
I took the cloves to mean the spice...  It seemed to work.  I did not add garlic at all.

This soup was okay. I may have added too many tomatoes, it just didn't have much taste. I added Italian spices and extra garlic to try and spice it up a little. We enjoyed it, but it wasn't the best I've had.

The bad news, then the good news. I did not care for this at all. Perhaps I have been stunted by canned soup. The good news is that this is a very well written recipe that the rest of my family enjoyed. It is very easy to make and everyone else loved it. I will definately make again!

This was a big disappointment..Used my ripe garden tomatoes and good chicken broth, still tasted rather like slightly thickened, clove flavored tomato juice.  Would not make again.

Not bad. I didn't have any cloves, and I'm wondering if that was the thing 'missing' from the recipe (I thought it was just a little bit bland). I doubled the recipe, and used cherry tomatoes from the garden. I pureed the tomato/onion/broth with a hand blender, and found there was A LOT of tomato skin, so I poured it through a colander a couple of times. I was feeling lazy so I thickened the soup with a little corn starch and water. This is a nice recipe, and I will make it again with one or two modifications (particularly to include cloves as the recipe states!).
