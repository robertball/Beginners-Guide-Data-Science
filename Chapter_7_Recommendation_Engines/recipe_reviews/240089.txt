I made this with the almond milk per the recipe, and I also made it with half and half. The spices and pumpkin blended very well into the mixture both ways. I have discovered that I am very picky about my coffee, so my final take on this recipe is to omit the honey and use half and half with the rest of the ingredients. I then add stevia to my cup of coffee along with 2 T. of the pumpkin creamer. Delicious and tastes like fall!

Next time I make it Iâ€™ll have to add more pumpkin and less spice.

Perfection! Could be sipped by itself as a pumpkin-pie-in-a-glass.
