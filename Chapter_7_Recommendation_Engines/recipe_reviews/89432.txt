Easy to make and absolutely delicious. Make double portions as one pudding is not enough for each person only two will satisfy.

I love this recipe! It is simple to make but you will addict to the desert once you tasted it. 1st-Use Screwpine/Pandan leaves while boiling the sago (make a ribbon so it is easy to take it out ) make sure to stir the sago less it will get clumpy and stick to the pan. Take out the leaves once the sago almost done. 2nd I would reduce the water to perhaps 6 cups. 10 cups per 200g sago is just too watery. Although the sago will thicken the water but you will eat more water than sago. I ended skim out the extra water until I get desired sago consistency. 3rd Warm fresh coconut milk salt it to your taste. 4th Fridge the sago over night wrap in plastic wrap. When you are ready to serve make sure the palm sugar syrup is hot. The contrast between hot syrup cold sago and warm coconut milk will make you asked for more!
