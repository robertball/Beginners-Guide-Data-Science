This is delicious and low carb. Thank you, Bob, for a great recipe that goes as a side with practically anything. I've made it several times to go with salmon, scallops and shrimp. Yummy!

Lovely mixture of oils.  I popped in some potatoes and sesame seeds.  Amazing with baked tofu!

Added basil. I used leftovers in a casserole, so did not add balsamic vinegar, otherwise I would have.

I was looking for something quick to make as a side dish and had peppers on hand.  Husband and I really liked.  Simple and flavorful.  Will make again.
