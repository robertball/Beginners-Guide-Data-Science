I've made a lot of chili recipes, and thought this one was pretty nice. I made it exactly as written. It was a little interesting that no onions (or even onion powder) was in it, as most chilis have it - I didn't miss them, though. It was also a bit unusual, and nice, that two kinds of beans were used. I happen to like blazing-hot food, and this was definitely mild-mannered. It might have just been my crock-pot (mine is very large), but I found that the chili didn't get all that hot after cooking for 3 hours on Low. The chili came out nice and thick, and was perhaps a bit too heavy on the tomato flavor. I didn't really mind these last points, but, noting that three kinds of tomatoes were used here, I might have cut back, or even omitted, the tomato paste, for example.
Overall, I liked this - it lasted me for two nights, totaling four big bowlfuls. It might not be the best chili ever, but it's still worth recommending.

My husband and I love this chili.  The only change I made was that I cooked some diced onion in olive oil before I added the ground turkey.  I've made it with hamburger too.  My husband likes it with hamburger and I like it  with turkey.

So easy to make. I definitely make this again.  We actually put it over pasta. I used the fire roasted tomatoes and that added just the right flavor.

This recipe exactly what it says Mild Mannered. I did my chili on the stove top and omitted the tomato paste and added onions. Mom ate it as is and loved it. Hubby and I like heat so we heated ours up after cooking. Next time I will put sweet bell pepper in the mix and serve it over rice.

Very good Chili,  I only made a couple changes.  I added 1/4 pound sweet sausage to the ground turkey in the browning process and added a can of corn with the beans.

I am usually a wimp when it comes to spicy food, so I was surprised that this was mild even for me. I made it as written except l used the stove top rather than the crock pot.  After cooking I decided it was very tomato-y and a little bland, so I added a couple dashes of hot sauce and 1/2 a sauted onion. I thought that improved it.  I gave it 4 stars since it says right in the title that it is mild. If you really don't like spicy food or your kids don't, this may be just what you want. I

I added a sweet onion, yellow pepper and an ear of corn just because I like veggies in my chili. Very little chili powder used, but added smoked paprika. Turned out very good.
