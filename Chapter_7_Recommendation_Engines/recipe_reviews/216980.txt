Made for Recipe Group. I used a crescent roll sheet, rolled it out and cut in half. Perfect fit for an 8x8 pan. Prebaked, added the layers in. Made some homemade 1000 Island and found I didn't have any kraut, so added a little dressing in place of it. Laid the second half of the sheet over the top. I'm not sure what the sealing to the pan part was for? I didn't extend the bottom crust up the sides of the pan either. Taste of a reuben, but I did miss the rye bread. I didn't have any problem with it being soggy, the crescent roll sheet was nice and crunchy. These would be great as an appetizer! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for Recipe Group: Just finished sharing this with Mom. She kept saying how good it is (= I recently had a pastrami Reuben out, so when I couldn't find the corned beef I used pastrami. I used 2 cans of crescent rolls in a larger pan. I also subbed 2 cups of shredded jack cheese because I don't care for Swiss. I used a 16 oz jar of sauerkraut with 2/3 c Thousand Island. My bottom crust sank down the sides of my pan. I pressed my saurkraut, rather than squeezing it, and my bottom crust, where the top and bottom crusts met, was soggy )= Next time I will brush the bottom crust with egg white before pre-baking it. We both enjoyed this, and are looking forward to leftovers (= [I did find the corned beef right after she sliced the pastrami for me - so next time I will make it with corned beef (=] edit: When I got back home, I took my leftover portions and flipped them over in the pan, making sure the soggy portions were exposed and threw it back in the oven for another ~20 minutes to dry it out. Just had some leftovers for dinner at work - yum!

Recipe Group Selection:  01, February 2014 ~ A Reuben is my favorite sandwich, so I knew I had to make this recipe.  Reading Christina's review, I decided to use 2 tubes of crescent rolls, to make the dough easier to spread.  I baked this in a Pampered ChefÂ® 8 1/2 x 11 1/2 stoneware pan and this was a perfect size for 2 tubes crescent rolls. I increased the ingredients to equal a recipe and a half.  After mixing up the dressing and sauerkraut, I added a little extra dressing to make it a little creamier.  I let the recipe rest, as the instructions called for, and this cut and plated beautifully.  The crescent rolls make this sweeter than a traditional Reuben, but it is still a very good recipe, worth making.  I forgot about the egg wash, and added a few caraway seeds to the topping.

It was good. Somethings missing though. We will make it again and play around with some other flavors. Over all it was very tasty...and I don't even like Ruben's very much.

My husband and I loved this recipe. Our kids liked it too, after giving them extra thousand island dressing to dunk it in.

This recipe is a HOMERUN. 
Everyone ate this, including the picky ones. 
Made nearly according to the recipe, except:
1.) Forgot to grease the pan - made zero difference, it slid right out
2.) Used only 1/2 pound of corned beef (like many other reviewers)
3.) Didn't seal crust to edges (made getting it out of pan easier)
4.) Baked until toasty brown, a little longer than the 20 minutes specified.

I have made this a few times and it is always a big hit. I usually buy my corned beef from Costco so one night I have corned beef and cabbage and use my left overs for this recipe the next day. I follow the recipe making sure I get all the juice out of the rinsed sauerkraut and pre cook the bottom crust so it's not soggy. I use havarti cheese or provolone instead of Swiss cheese. I also add a thin layer of zesty horse radish on the sauerkraut.  I think a little zesty horse radish gives it so much flavorful!

After reading all the reviews I only added one thing, some caraway seeds to the sauerkraut after draining it.  And I hand sliced the cheese, I weighed it, so it didn't really cover all the area but it was awesome.  As I layered the thinly sliced corned beef, I squeezed mustard randomly between each layer.  It was to die for.  Will I make this again, for sure.

Delicious....made this for Super Bowl this year instead of a reuben dip. Loved it....I used reduced fat crescent rolls....not that it mattered to much with the meat and swiss! Great pot luck throw together. Thanks!

Man oh man this is good! Made it almost exactly as written except I put a whole 15oz can of kraut in. Maybe a little extra 1000 too. I'm thinking next time I will try the pillsbury ready pie crust and use a pie dish. Maybe less sweet? We'll see.

Update: I used a Pillsbury Ready Made Pie Crust and a 9" pie plate.  Sooooo much easier and I liked the taste better.  Do not grease the pie plate...no need!!  This is a real hit with my family!! Making it for our Dyngus Day celebration!

Omg this was good. I doubled it and made it in a 13 x 9 dish for work St Pattys day pot luck. They loved it. Just added some caraway seeds sprinkled on top for "rye" bread affect. Made it night before and nuked for 5 minutes, maybe that's why it set up nicely . Definitely making it again.

I followed this recipe almost to the letter, except I doubled it and baked it in a 9X13 baking dish. I gave it 4 stars simply because it was warm--not hot-- in the middle, and doughy near the top layer of cheese. Perhaps next time I'll bake it longer and see if that makes a difference.

Loved this recipe and its so easy to make.  I used only 1/2 lb. of corned beef( because I forgot how much to buy).    I also baked it longer than directed,  about 20-25 minutes.  I let it get nice and brown.

We LOVED this!  My husband has an extremely sensitive palate and he can't stop raving about it.  My teenage son is not so particular and he loved it, I think he ate 2/3 of it.  Definitely adding this to rotation.

My husband loved it. I liked it. From a "maker's" point of view, it wasn't very clear to me what to do with the extra sides of the bottom dough. It wouldn't stand up on the sides, (1.5-2" high) so I draped it over the top of the sides best I could. However, only the corners stayed up and the middles sagged. Additionally, when I applied the top layer, trying to press to edges of the baking dish, where the dough had already cooked from the bottom layer, the top layer would not stick. Also, the pic had carroway seeds but the recipe did not. I think the seeds would have definitely made it more Reuben-like.

I did like mixing the sauerkraut and dressing together.

Overall, I liked it and would try again just to see if I could get it right.

made this tonight for dinner. the one thing that I changed was using fresh coleslaw instead of sauerkraut. It gave it a little added crunch even after baking.  it did take about 25 minutes instead of 20. will definitely make again.

This recipe is always a hit at our house. I do use 2 cans of crescents, have the corned beef sliced extra thin at the deli counter and then chop the corned beef. Caraway seeds are a good addition,  but not necessary.

Never any leftovers! I always make 2 13X9 pans, because when the kids are all home from college, we have 4 hungry teens. It is so easy, and after using cooking spray on the dish before layering in the dough, clean up is a snap!

I made this recipe tonight. It was a big hit everyone really enjoyed it. I just did a few things a little different. For one I got a corn beef and cooked it in the crock pot on high for 4hrs. Then I cut it up into thin cubes and browned it in butter. I also made my homemade thousand island dressing from scratch.

New edit: I just can't tell you how much we love this recipe. It's so easy and delicious. I always increase it using my changes listed below. Leftovers reheat great in the microwave. The crescent dough sheets without perforations are the best to use.
This is so good. The easiest way ever to make Reubens without the mess. I increase it for a 9x13 pan using 2 tubes of crescent dough. I use a 10 ounce bag of Buddig corned beef, an 8oz bag of shredded Swiss cheese, half cup of 1000 Island, and a 14 ounce can of sauerkraut. It's delicious, easy and quick!!

Really good if you like Reuben sandwiches! I didn't think it was bad with the crescent rolls instead of the rye as some suggested. Overall it was really good. Kids liked it...even my daughter who isn't a fan of sauerkraut ate it. Not her favorite, but she liked it. Her younger brother loved it!

Very good!  I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 pan.  I did not use the full amount of Thousand Island dressing (my choice) and used the extra for dipping.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon of caraway seeds to top and bottom crusts before baking!

Very good, but it doesn't need 3/4 pound of the corned beef,1/2 pound was plenty.

Don't waste your time making this.  For far less time and a much tastier result just make a real Reuben sandwich.   I use two fry pans, start the meat and sauerkraut cooking in one,  while that cooks butter the rye bread ( I prefer seeded rye) when the kraut and meat are thoroughly heated (about 8 or 10 minutes) drop your bread in the other fry pan butter side down, when it has browned turn them over, add your cheese and dressing, when the cheese has begun to melt add the cooked kraut and meat, presto a real Reuben in less time than it took to make the crescent bake.

8/2019 - made for dinner with soup, followed recipe and it baked up nicely.  Was very good - I think it would be messy to serve as an appetizer at a party.

I had to change the crusts for a super easy and quick gluten free option. I took 2 GF pie crusts (comes 2 in a pkg), pre browned bottom as recipe states. Filled pie 1st with a layer of cheese then corned beef, thin slice onion, thin layer of left over chopped potatoes, more cheese then the sauerkraut mixed with thousand island dressing. I spread a thin layer of mustard on the inside of the top crust which after thawing and warming up a bit became loose enough to invert over the pie and with a bit of loosening around the edges with my fingers it dropped right on top. Use the wash, stab a few times to vent and bake as directed. Note: I let the bottom layer of cheese come up and over the edges so that the top crust stuck to that cheese. I also used whole jar of sauerkraut at least 2 cups to fill pie fuller and because we love it. My husband was over the moon over the flavor and it looked really impressive. I'm sorry I didn't take a picture. I will next time.

I added 4 oz cream cheese to the kraut and dressing. I also rinsed the kraut well since I don't usually like it. Forgot to do the egg white and it still came out good enough my husband asked to put it on my list to make again.

The family loved it! I read through previous comments and saw that others were using the crescent dough sheets. One cut in half was perfect. So easy to make.

When I found this recipe I was so excited. Unfortunately as a reuben lover both me and my husband found the texture and flavor of the crescent rolls to be a little sweet and weird. Its a great concept but we personally loved everything about it BUT the crescent rolls.

I made this for my family and they LOVED it.  After brushing the top with the egg, sprinkle a little caraway seeds on the top.   Delicious.

Made this for Recipe Group...This was simple and good! I could not get the dough to roll out to 12", so I just ended up using a smaller baking dish, which worked fine. I think I would've liked a bit more dressing, but I tend to like a lot of dressing on my Reuben sandwiches. This would be nice for a party b/c once you let it sit for a bit after taking it from the oven, it cuts beautifully. I still prefer my Reubens the traditional way, but this was nice for a change. Thanks for sharing. :)

Great recipe.  I actually used leftover corned beef from a roast along with some kraut I had and it was very tasty.  Husband loved it and the Reuben is one of his favorite sandwiches.  In order to mimic the sandwich more, next time I may try making some croutons out of some rye bread to use as the top rather than the crescent rolls.  The crescent roll topping worked, and was good - but a little sweet for my taste.
