From the "inventor":  The ingredients are key... allrecipes didn't mention my notes (if you want to taste them the way I intended).  Instead of "3/4 cup tomato sauce", use 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon "no salt added" tomato sauce (proportion is critical), Franks Red hot cayenne sauce (nice vinegar/pepper balance), Tone's Chili powder (seems to have proportionally less salt than average). I usually deep fry the wings for 10 minutes.  Baking is lower fat, but 30 minutes is a probably a little too short.  I like spicy food, and with the called for 1 tsp ground cayenne with the other proportions gives a good "bite" IMHO.  Hope you all enjoy... thanks for the nice comments!!!

Excellent!!!!  However, I did change the recipe to: 1 bottle Franks (12 oz), 1 (8 oz) can Hunts No Salt Tomato Sauce, 1/3 cup Unsalted Butter, 4 dashes Cayenne & 1 1/2 Tbsp Chili Powder. Baked in preheated 400 F oven for 45 min - dipped in sauce which I boiled over med. temp for 5 min.; replaced on clean 11 x 17 pan, baked add'l 15 min, Dipped again in remaining sauce, baked for 10 min. Then removed from oven and the meat was sooooo tender!  (Probably should bake on a broiler pan to keep as much fat separated from chicken to make crispier) But loved it - all my guests raved and asked for the recipe!  Hurray for a tasty buffalo wings that you can bake and not have to fry!  Thanks for all the reviews who contributed to the outcome of this recipe!

First time I ever made these.  Did half by baking and the other by grilling.  Baking is totally the way to go.  Used only drumettes.  Baked the wings for 30 minutes at 400 (using the broiler pan to drain the fat) and after 30 minutes basted with the sauce.  The sauce: omitted the tomato sauce and used hot wing sauce (Wing-Time), garlic and butter.  Also added in the cayenne pepper and chili powder (Also added in 1 tblsp Chili Garlic sauce which they serve at Thai restaurants).  Mixed with a wisk.  We like it very spicy, lips are still burning.  Cooked for 5 minutes more, added another layer of sauce, cooked another 5 minutes at 300.  Then used the leftover sauce for dipping (if you dare) and cut up some celery and added ranch dressing.  
Very good!

These are SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good! I could live eating just Buffalo Wings. I added some honey, worchestershire sauce and chili sauce to the mixture to give it a sweet and spicy taste.

I never write reviews but I thought these wings were fantastic!  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, using Franks Red Hot as the submitter suggested. I used all drumettes,and I might add that the sauce was enough to do an entire frozen 4 lb bag of drummettes.  My only regret is that I only did 24 drummettes instead of the whole bag.  We easily could've eaten the whole bag--once thawed and cooked they shrink a lot.  I did follow another person's advice and after the frist 45 min bake, I dipped them in suace and placed in a clean dish for the remaining bake time. I served with celery, ranch dressing and cornbread.  I will be serving these a lot! Thanks!

My husband lives for hot and spicy ... he loves these! I did change it some ... I added more chili powder and cayenne pepper . I made a half of batch the first day ... the sauce didn't seem to coat real thick . I had the remaining sauce in the fridge overnight to make the rest the next day ... after being in the fridge overnight the sauce was MUCH thicker and coated very nicely , so from now on I will mix the sauce a day ahead . Also my husband said they were not " messy " enough for wings so I actually dipped them one more time when I took them out of the oven ... I got a thumbs up on the recipe after that and it has now become the one I will always use for his wings

DELICIOIUS!! This is THE BEST Hot Wing recipe!!!  You've got to try it....easy to put together, better than fried.  Don't add the cayenne unless you want your eyes to water.....it's got plenty of kick without it - too much for kids unless they're used to it.  I still can't believe how great they were - definitely going to make it again this weekend!!  Thanks Walt!!

I thought these were great. I did bake at 400 for 45 minutes, then at 250 for about 10 minutes after adding sauce. To make sure they were crispy I broiled them for the last 5 minutes.

This was excellent.  I cooked the wings 45 minutes at 400 degrees and after dipping in the sauce , put them back for 15 minutes at the same temperature. This made them crispy (but still not as crispy as the ones that are deep fried but we try to watch our fat so we settled for this). I usually buy the baking bags with the seasoning in them specifically for buffalo wings but this was much better and less expensive.  They were very spicy but not unbearably so.

Like to have your house smell like greasy chicken? How about your cloths? And, it really does a number on the inside of your oven! Don't bother, order out.

I bake them (which was an option in this recipe) which is not traditional, but it is lower in fat & tastes just as good, but I only add Frank's hot sauce to them after baking.  No butter necessary, definitely NO tomato sauce & NO additional seasonings.  Mine taste like the wings I eat in my hometown of Buffalo.

These are easy to make. I brought them to a party and everyone kept asking for the recipe. I didn't change anything to the recipe either. That's pretty good for me. This one's a keeper!

This is the 10th(?) I must have made this.  It is better than the restaurants~ seriously!
I make it exactly like what the inventor recommends.  A couple times I was out of tomato sauce, so I used fra diablo spagetti sauce instead.  Not bad, but the inventor's formula tops.  Thanks for recommending Frank's hot sauce which I've read in the bottle; "secret ingredient used in the original Buffalo wings created in Buffalo, NY in 1964"~ great job, thanks again!

UPDATE: To cure the swimming in grease problem, try what I do: first, cook the wings on your broiler pan (or any other setup where the grease can drain off,like a cooling rack over a cookie sheet), then after dipping in the sauce, cook again on a foil-lined cookie sheet to save some messy clean-up. As you can see from the picture, they come out very crisp with absolutely no greasy mess. This was my first time making hot wings. They turned out so great I had to submit a picture! I followed Walt's suggestions from his review, using Frank's Buffalo wing sauce and exact tomato sauce meas. I also added a bit of honey, garlic and onion powder and doubled the chili powder. Next time I will make sure to have cayenne on hand to turn the heat up a little. 2-1/2 lbs of wings were gone in 20 min and there were only 3 of us eating them!

VERY EASY TO MAKE! Loved this recipe mostly because it so simple to prepare. Usually I fry the wings in a fryer which usually means sweating alot and putting up with the oily smell around the kitchen afterwards. The mess to clean after frying is another inconvenience. Following this recipe is not only easy to put together and great tasting, but easy to clean afterwards!

These  were really tasty.  My trick for getting the wings crisp in the oven is to place them on a rack in a baking pan, then brush with melted butter prior to baking.  Also, I turn the heat up to 425.  They come out crispy-skinned & delicious.

I followed someone's recommendation to alter the recipe to: 1 bottle Franks (12 oz), 1 (8 oz) can Hunts No Salt Tomato Sauce (I used 4oz of Tomato Paste instead), 1/3 cup Unsalted Butter, 4 dashes Cayenne & 1 1/2 Tbsp Chili Powder. I added just a bit of water since I used the paste instead of the sauce. I baked in preheated 400 F oven for 40 min - dipped in sauce which I boiled over low. temp while the wings cooked; replaced on clean 11 x 17 pan, baked add'l 10 min, Dipped again in remaining sauce, baked for 10 min.  Sooooo good!

Very good. So I'm in a major health conscious kick (I know...what am I doing eating chicken wings, right?  Can't help it.  Love them too much!).  I made these with 3/4 cup of Frank's Red Hot sauce, 1/2 cup tomato sauce and 1 tsp of cayenne.  No butter.  You know what, I didn't miss the butter at all.  Not one bit and trust me I'm a latherer of the butter on all things (or I used to be).  I cooked the wings for 50 minutes at 400 degrees.  Turned out really nice.  Then I tranferred them to a cookie sheet and slathered on the hot sauce mixture.  Cooked them for another 5 minutes, turned them over, slathered on more sauce, cooked 5 minutes on that side and repeated process one more time. Finally to crisp them up, I turned on the broiler for exactly 7 minutes.  AWESOME!!!  Thanks for the fantastic recipe, Walt.

Sauce was tasty, but the consistency was runny, so it did not coat the wings very well. Will not make again.

These were Delish...I made these for a football party and they were gobbled up...only thing I did different was instead of adding tomato sauce I added my homemade BBQ sauce and doubled the hot pepper sauce. Yummy!

I followed the recipe exactly (used Frank's hot sauce as others suggested ) and the wings turned out incredibly!  I did however bake at 400 degrees for a more crispier finish.  My company said these compared to the wings he ate at an expensive restaurant recently!  The sauce does make enough for about 6 lbs. of wings though!

Have had many version of b. wings, this recipe (using the author's notes for lower salt, authentic flavor) may become my standard. SuperBowl's next weekend; this might be just what my hubby wants to eat while watching the Steelers' big game.
Hello to those in/from Dallas; your town does a great SuperBowl!

Love this recipe.  It is quick, easy, full of flavor and spice.  I used Louisiana Hot Sauce for the red pepper sauce and a little less tomato sauce than called for.  I also added crushed black pepper in addition to the chili powder and cayenne pepper because I love spicy foods.

Entirely baked the wings on broiler pan (at about 375 degrees for around 40 mins) before applying buffalo sauce. Dipped the now crispy wings in sauce and returned to 350 degree oven, and basted on another layer of sauce 7 mins later. They were GREAT!!! Not soggy or greasy at all and still finger licking delicious. I did have to add more cayenne though, I prefer a much spicier buffalo sauce! ;)

These were the best Buffalo wings I ever made! My entire family loved them! I took the advice of "Ladybug" and coated the wings in a mixture of 1/2 cup of  flour and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. This  worked great in keeping the wing sauce nicely coated on the wings. I also took the advice of a reviewer named Jen and used half the butter and added honey (3Tbls.) to the sauce mix. I only used 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper and I'm glad I did because it was just spicy enough without being to over-powering. I didn't have any problems with too much grease in the pan after baking the wings. I baked them on parchment paper for easier clean up. The baking temperature and times were perfect. I served the wings with "Ranch Dipping Sauce" a recipe from this site.  I'll be making my wings like this from now on!

Delicious!! I used closer to 2 Tablespoons of chili powder and baked for 45 minutes before dipping into the sauce.  I recommend baking them with the sauce until they are the consistency that you like.  A little longer than the recipe calls for - at a higher oven temp if you want them more toasty looking.  This was my first attempt to make hot wings.....and I had to make them every week for over a month - my family loves them.  Tastes as good as fried - but much healthier!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!Update 10/08 - If you'd like more of a coating on the wings, toss them in a mixture of flour and garlic powder in a ziploc bag until coated.  Layer in lightly sprayed baking pan and spray lightly with Pam or drizzle with melted butter/margarine.  Bake until browned and then baste or dip into sauce - cook until desired crispness.  This is still the best HW recipe, either way!

First time making my own wings. Read the reviews, followed the recipe... success! They were awesome! Great recipe, Walt. So easy to make. Next time I'll cut the wings apart for easier consumption, but that didn't diminish the flavor or simplicity at all. A new Superbowl staple is born at my house!

I didn't think these were anything special.  The baking made for wings that were not particularly tender or juicy.  The sauce was tasty, but the consistency was runny, so it did not coat the wings very well.  I won't make them again.

Very good.  I used my deep fryer (10 mins cook time) and as noted by the contributor used 1/2 cup tomato sauce and Franks hot sauce.  I added in 1/2 tsp of garlic powder just because.  After deep frying I tossed the wings to coat in a deep bowl.  I have lots of sauce left over for other day(s).

Needed broiling time, rather than setting time under temp. 250 oven.  Wings were absolutely delicious, but were a bit soggy.  After dipping, broil for a couple minutes on each side.

This was good and easy. I followed the recipie exactly. For the hot sauce, I used Franks Hot Sauce. After everything was done,there was sauce left over. I think that it could have been more spicy though; I did not even break a sweat or my mouth and lips never burned (Bahhh!). Next time I'll add one teaspoon of chili paste and a little more cayenne also I might mince some garlic and heat that with the sauce for a bit. Of course, I used blue cheese. Also, I left the chicken wings in the oven for about 45 minutes turning them once (I could have even left them in longer though for extra crispyness). 30 minutes DOES NOT get them crispy.

Wow I am not usually into spicy foods. And was worried that this one was going to be too hot. It was perfect. Just enough kick to make them enjoyable. I am going to be bringing them to my Sister-inlaws Super Bowl Party. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

I will be cooking the wings again for my family. Easy to cook in oven and great texture. The only things I chaged- oil both sides of wings while on cookie sheet, 1-8oz can tomato sauce, just 1tbs. chili powder and no cayenne.  The 8 kids loved the wings and my husband just add more hot sauce.

our family LOVED these - I did them on the grill, cooked the chicken thru.  Mixed all the ingredients on the stovetop and heated it thru and let the flavors mesh.  Took the pan of sauce out, and dipped the chicken not once, not twice, but THREE times cooking for about 5 minutes between each dunking - they were a BIG hit.  Though next time I will just use chicken legs, as the whole fam likes those more than wings.

Good. I liked the convenience of baking. I sprinkled salt, pepper and garlic on them and then baked for 45 min at 400 as suggested by others, dipped them in the sauce, baked for 10 more min, basted again and then broiled them for 5 min at 425. My husband said they were cooked perfect. I didn't care for the tomato sauce in the hot sauce. I will leave it out next time. I make some with buffalo sauce, also some with BBQ (bottled), and some with Teriyaki (also bottled)for my kids who can't take the heat yet. I also bake mine on the broiling pan with a little water in the pan. It makes clean up much easier, dripping don't smoke and burn.

We liked these quite a bit! They are just the right heat! My only alteration was to deep fried my wings because I prefer them to be quite crispy. Amazing recipe, and my new standard.

Very good. I used drumsticks and 3 of my kids loved it.  I thought it was quite good as well.  didn't have the Franks sauce, so I just used what I had.  also used less kick for the kids, I'm sure I'd've liked the full strength recipe even more.

These were the best!  This was my first attempt to make chicken wings.  I did not enjoy cutting the wings apart so next time will use precut wings.  Aside from that it was so easy and so delicious!  I made them for my family for a football game snack and we devoured them.  Will make again and again!

These chicken wings were sooooo good!!  I made them for Superbowl- never made chicken/Buffalo wings before.  They were pretty easy and turned out great!!  They were a big hit!!  I took the advice of previous reviewers and threw the wings into a bag with 1/4 C. flour and a little salt and pepper.  I prefer a little breading on Buffalo wings.  The sauce is really flavorful!  Thanks for sharing!!

I didn't change the recipe at all and it was fantastic. I'm excited to make this for my next get-together with friends. Of course, any time you make chicken with the skin on (as wings have) it's going to be a greasy. However, I love this indulgence that is better than deep fried wings without much difference in taste. Update: I tried further cutting down the grease by putting the wings on an oven-proof "cooling" rack, and put the rack over a pan with sides. That way the grease dripped off as the wings baked. It's the only way I'll bake wings now.

These were delicious! I hate frying so I loved that these were baked. As many others had suggested, I baked mine longer, about 50 minutes, before dipping them into the sauce. I doubled the amount of hot sauce (Frank's) and these were gobbled up at the New Year's Eve party I took them to. Thank you, Walt!

We made a variation of this for Superbowl and it was fantastic. First I hate to fry foods so we baked them.
I marinated them in the ingredients listed minus the butter overnight. I baked them about 50 minutes then dipped them in more hot sauce. They were devoured. Nice flavor and moist.

When I made this sauce it tasted a little too much like tomato sauce, so I added 3 tbsps. of Balsamic Vinegar, and it came out amazing. It was a big hit with everyone!!!

These are a great alternative to deep frying wings. Be sure to read the review from the author, Walt and follow his directions in the review. The recipe makes lots of sauce so I double dipped (coated all of the wings once and then started over and coated again) the wings after cooking at 400 for 45 minutes. Cooked the coated wings for 15 minutes at 400 and then put under the broiler for about 4 minutes to give them a crisper coating. Be very careful if you broil them they will burn quickly so watch them carefully.

We don't have children but I have to let you know that I am making these for the second time.  What a great recipe.  The only thing I can say,  and I'm not complaining is that they were a little too hot the first time, but the flavor is excellent.  Also, I like the idea of baking the wings first then seasoning.  My first time trying "hot" wings.  Sure beats buying wing from the supermarket.  My husband absolutely loved them and he is definitely my best "critic".  I mean that in a very positive way.  Thank you Walt!!!

These wings were AMAZING!  So delicious and easy to make.  I've tried a few buffalo wings recipes from this site and this is the first one I've loved enough to give it a 5 star rating.  The sauce is so tasty and has a good bite.  Not one that you notice right away, but it leaves your lips tingling.  I made a batch for my bf's friends and they devoured them all and requested I make them for his Superbowl party!  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!

First time making chicken wings and I am glad that I finally did it! These were really good. I had a bag of meijer brand frozen chicken wings that I thawed out and patted dry. I did bake them at 400 and they got done really fast. They didn't get as crispy as I would have liked but they were still very good. Just used bottled frank's red hot wing sauce. Great recipe.. Thank you

Very tasty.  Halfway between a buffalo and barbeque.  My wife was a little light on the cayenne but this was a great wing even mild, and would be terrific with some kick. Update Apr.18: Had some sauce leftover and kept it frozen for over a month.Thawed it and followed recipe.My husband found them spicier now then when I had just made then originally.So from now on, I will make the sauce a week in  advance so that all the spiciness blends in and intensifies.

My husband is quite particular about his buffalo wings.  Tried this recipe, and he loved it!  Said, "This is just like I like 'em!"  I did substitute olive oil instead of butter since I had used up my butter in baking.

Wonderful Wings!!  I did many of the suggestions as well.  Cooked for 45 min., used chili sauce instead of tomato sauce, used only 1/4 cup melted butter, oiled both sides lightly before baking, added about 1 tbsp honey as well to the sauce, used Franks pepper sauce and I used a clean cookie sheet for the second baking and broiled for about 5 minutes at the end.  These were very easy to make.

A couple of things. This is my first attempt at homemade wings, other than frozen/reheated, but I am a wing connoisseur. Very good wing overall but needs to be paired with blue cheese or ranch to fully bring out the taste. I prepared precisely according to the recipe and followed the "inventor's" comments. Fried for 10 minutes then baked at 250 for 15. I recommend adding a little more Frank's if not using a dip. Other than that, fabulous!

We loved these!  I added only about 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne because my son doesn't like things too hot, and I used Frank's Red Hot Sauce.  Baked a little longer than called for, and after I'd dipped the wings, I let them bake a bit longer as suggested, then turned on the broiler and let them crisp up a bit, stirring every few minutes.  The sauce thickened up nicely and we absolutely loved the flavor.  I will definitely be making these again!

Definitely a 5 star - hubby loved it and will be making again.  Thanks Walt for this great recipe.  I did change the tomato sauce as you suggested and added a little chili garlic sauce.  Great meal with celery and ranch dressing plus potato salad.

Baking the chicken wings ahead of time, really gives it a yummy flavor. I stopped doing the hassel of cutting the wings myself, (my hands kept cramping), so I buy the precut wings from Costco. Crock potting the wings really helps to bring out that spicy yumminess.

This sauce is GREAT.  We chickened out and didn't put as much Cayenne pepper in as the recipe called for.  Next time I make them I will really spice it up.  These are EXCELLENT!!

A fairly delicious recipe! I followed the recipe pretty much except I baked the wings for 45 minutes instead of 30 and I used Trader Joe's Jalapeno hot sauce (my personal favorite!) instead of Frank's Red Hot. It had good bite and the wings cooked well which was a bit of a surprise (I usually deep-fry my wings). A good way to keep a little fat out, but still making it moist and tender. The sauce was terrific. I never would have thought of mixing spicy tomato sauce with butter and hot sauce. It wasn't exactly what I wanted, but I may try this again. I think, though, I will bread the wings with some flour and spices next time. There's something about the taste of plain wings that are cooked or fried without any spices, marinade or sauce that I don't like. That is the only fault of this recipe. Otherwise, I would have given it 4 stars. If you're not as picky about that as I am than give it a try!

Absolutely awesome! The only things I did differently was putting in 1/2 of a small can of no-salt added tomato sauce, throwing in garlic in the butter when I melted it and spooning extra sauce on the wings after I placed them on the pan. It has a ton of heat so watch out! :-)

First I followed this recipe to make the sauce, but it turned out to be too hot to handle... So I added some honey, and actually the honey made the sauce very tasty without losing its spiciness!

First off, thank you WALTDOUD for a clarification of your recipe.  While good to begin with, it is much improved with the change in the amount of tomato sauce and with the 10 minutes frying.  I had just sworn I would never use this site again because too many 4 1/2 star+ recipes have turned out terrible.  But this is such an exception.  I use Hill Country Chili Powder purchased from the site Spices, Inc (I hate that McCormick's stuff) and left out the cayenne pepper.  Wow were these good.  I'd hate to tell you how many wings they each polished off  - oink.  They are ready to forgive me for for feeding them another recipe from this site.  Don't get me wrong - I have found some really good recipes here but I have had way too many failures.

Oven broiling is definitely the way to go. I used Frank's Buffalo Wing sauce, butter, crushed red pepper and lots of dashed of Tabasco sauce. It was not as spicy as I would have liked. I will make again and follow the recipe exactly and see what happens.

Coating the chicken with a mix of 1/2 cup flour & 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder worked well and is worth doing. The original recipe yielded twice as much sauce as needed. Even with applying only half the sauce, using parchment paper and cooking longer in the last step than called for, the wings were still wet. Note that the wings are even better on the second day!!!!

AT THE TIME THAT I MADE THIS RECIPE WE WERE BOTH SICK. WHILE WE BOTH ENJOY INCREDIBLY SPICY FOOD, THIS RECIPE IS SO HOT THAT IT CAN'T BE EATEN ENJOYABLY.  YES I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAN VARY THE INGREDIENTS, BUT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE MODIFIED THAT MUCH.

A good recipe to go off of!  I followed it exactly the first time (with extra spicy Frank's), and it was delicious!  However, I would like it more spicy.  It seems like it can be easily modified, so I think next time I'll try sautéing some garlic and peppers in the butter.

Very good. I used this recipe as the basis for some chicken strips (I alter most of the recipes to what we have in the kitchen).  I've never used tomato sauce before, and I was a little concerned that the sauce was going to come out, well, tomato-y.  It didn't make it taste that way at all, and it did bulk up the sauce, so we didn't have to use as much hot sauce but somehow the spice was still there, even before I added the following spices: Cavender's Greek Seasoning, black pepper, minced jalapenos, and garlic powder, as well as the butter, hot sauce, chili powder and cayenne that the recipe calls for (sorry, I didn't measure anything).  It turned out very spicy, and all of our guests loved it. We are going camping this weekend, and a friend of mine requested that I make it and bring it. He said "We'll put it on something. We'll just dip chips in it if we have to".

This was excellent!  I didn't find any wings at the store so I used legs instead and they still turned out great!  Because of the size difference, I baked for about 10-15 longer.

Totally Awesome..... I followed the recipe from the inventor recipe... used Frank's hot sauce and only 1/2 cup and 1 tblspn of tomato sauce. Did everything else the same and they were fabulous. We deep fried our wings and then I coated them with sauce and put them in the oven for 2-4 min under the broiler. They were the best!!!!!!!!!!! Will definately make these wings again...  Loved them thanks for the recipe

I made these for a guy that never thinks anything I make is hot.  HE LOVED THESE!  I even saw him downing several glasses of milk afterwards!  These wings were tasty and pretty easy to make.  The longest thing thing was cutting the wings apart.  But you wouldn't need to do that, you can always buy them pre-cut.  However, I saved a $1 a pound cutting them myself!!

I didn't use the wing sauce listed here, as the one I made had simply hot sauce, butter and a mad crazy amount of habernero and jalepeno peppers that I pureed in the blender.  Yes... It was ravagingly hot.  I was looking for a baked wing recipe and this worked quite nicely in that respect.  It's hard to take deep fried wings to someone elses party so the baked wings worked perfectly.  I just brought them in a 9X13 dish with saran wrap over the top and dropped them in their oven when I got there.  Came out perfect.  Will do this again.  Thanx

Excellent Buff chicken wings!  My first time making them, and this was a good recipe.  I cut back the tomato sauce to 1/2 cup.  I used franks original for the red pepper sauce as recommended.  Also, didn't have any cayenne pepper, but they were still great and still had zip.

I like that they are not deep fried.

I made this for a bunch of guys watching football.  They were gone in 10 min.  I fried them for 10 before the first bake.  Let sit in dressing for awhile.  I added honey and reduced the tomato sauce to 1/2 cup.

I made this for a party I was having and they were a BIG HIT!!  My children, ages 7 and 9, couldn't get enough of them.  In fact, they finished them off for dinner!  I used a bottled chicken wing sauce for the "red pepper sauce". I'll definately be making these again.

Not authentic Western New York original recipe,but as a native of the area I can tell you these are excellent. The process made the juiciest wings I've had in a long time. If you want the dry type, this isn't the recipe you want. But if you want great flavor and excellent juiciness, then make these.

I prefer the fried wings as oppose to the baked wings. In my opinion I think the flavor of the pepper sauce clings to the wings better when fried. My family prefers fried also.

Good recipe, but the cooking time was almost double. I may have had too many wings on the cookie sheet. I neven use the Broiler because I didn't like the color. Will try it again.

I followed the "inventor's" comments below and was very happy with these wings.  I will probably add a bit less spice next time as they were a little too hot for some of my friends.  I love that they are baked and have no flour as I am gluten-free.  This was my first attempt at hot wings and I was very happy with how they turned out!

I made these for Superbowl Sunday and my teenage daughter and husband licked their plates clean!!  They are spicy but VERY GOOD... get out the ranch and celery.. In fact they have been begging me to make them just for the heck of it. Thank you for a great recipe

Thought these were good and not too spicy.  For a real BUFFALO wing taste however, you'll need to add FRANKS hot sauce as the wings originated in Buffalo and that is the most important ingredient!

They didn't get crispy at all and the sauce was horrible. Big waste of time and money. My lesson here is if I want chicken wings, go to a restaurant!!!

These turned out well! Spicy, but good. I added a bit of BBQ sauce to the sauce mix, and finished them on the stovetop to sort of caramalize them.

this recipe came out ok. could have been better. i really wanted the flavor to soak through the whole wing. The baking tray was also very full of fat when it was time to take out the wings to coat with the sauce, and i believe that may have affected the taste of the wings too. Next time, i could probably wipe out the tray before putting back the wings on to bake.

I made this for 50 people and about 10 of those people were seriously raving about the wings and asking me for the recipe. It was great because they werent deep fried and everyone still loved them. I added a couple of things but, it was relatively the same. Just fresh garlic in the sauce; the red rooster garlic chili sauce as my hotsauce; and thats about the only difference!

Ok update. These wings are awesome! We have made them many times since my last review and I wanted to make sure people know they are the bomb. We use Hot Mexican-style chili powder and I think it adds a smoky flavor to the wings. These are incredibly easy to make and are so good and what a change from straight buffalo sauce!

WHO would have thought of using tomato sauce on hot wings??? This recipe was excellent. I used a can of tomato sauce instead of 3/4 c. I used some wings that I had overcooked the day before. I heated all ingredients in a big pot and then added the wings. I coated all the wings and then I served them. I did not put the wings in the oven after coating them with the sauce. FYI using a can of tomato sauce tends to make a thicker sauce. My dry overcooked wings were very good after I coated them in this sauce. I did not taste a tomato flavor at all, which was great, because I'm not a tomato fan. I will make this often and use maybe a 1/2 c of tomato sauce with more hot sauce. Oh and I only used 2 tsps of butter. Thank you for this recipe.

I made these for New Year's Eve using the no-salt added tomato sauce. Very easy compared to another recipe I've used.  I thought my wings were a little big, so I had to bake them longer than the recipe said. I also didn't bother to trip the wing tips and had no problems with them burning. The kids loved the spicy bite!  I'm sure we will make them again.

I made these for a party and they walked a perfect line between spicy but not too hot.  Easy to make, don't rush the cooking time, make sure the wings are cooked long enough.  Excellent taste!

These were really good! I omitted the Tomato Sauce because I didn't have any, and used Texas Pete instead of Franks Red Hot because my husband prefers the taste of Texas Pete. These are such a great alternative to the greasy fried wings, are heck of alot less mess and the texture is very close to fried! I will be making these for superbowl! Thanks!

Made these for Superbowl Sunday, and everyone enjoyed them. Doubled the sauce and ended up with too much. They are not hot at all, so if you like your wings hot this is not the recipe for you.

This recipe was great, the wings really were like those i have had at resturants!  I never thought to use tomato sauce in the wing sauce, I thought it would basically water the sauce down, but it did not.  I might add more spice next time though, I like it hot!

Neither me nor my boyfriend cared much for these wings.  They took twice the amount of time to cook and the chili powder gave them a weird flavor.  I will search out a recipe that has the traditional vinegar/red pepper sauce base and not make these again.

I added a little more cayenne to these to kick them up a notch and they were quite the hit!  My 20-something brother had such a messy face and hands from scarfing these down!  Excellent recipe -- just add enough heat for your tastes!

So easy to make and yummy. This recipe is fool proof. The hard part was to make the sides: fries, carrots and celery sticks, and a blue cheese sauce. 30 min for the chicken is not enough. It's more like 1 hr. We'll make this one often.

Love this recipe, I've made it a few times now with great results. My only alterations are that I now use sriracha sauce, and I broil the wings a bit.

I put my own spin on this one by cooking chicken breasts and then shredding it to cook in this sauce to put on sandwiches along with some bleu cheese (or ranch) dressing. The kids LOVED it and so did my coworkers!!

For those who thought there wasn't enough vinegar taste, I have a suggestion, Frank's Hot Sauce just came out with sauce flavored for Buffalo Wings.  If you use this as your red pepper sauce...you will get that vinegar taste you love!  Great recipe!

I did not care for these at all.  They had too much of a buttery taste for me.  My husband ate most of them but agreed that he'd had much better.  Will be looking for a better recipe to use as we are both wing fans.

I wish I could give 4 1/2 stars. it's not quite the 5 star, but wouldn't take much to get there.

First, I cooked the chicken differently than this recipe. Basically, I have a recipe for BBQ chicken that is perfect and I just used the sauce on this recipe for chicken I'd already made.

SAUCE. Not much to improve on. :) Personally, I'm not a fan of buffalo style ANYTHING, but my husband wanted this so I looked until I found what I needed. He likes the "sour" tomato flavoring more than the hot, but  the hot is definitely needed. I used home made tomato sauce so mine was probably a little stronger than what this called for. That being said, it wasn't quite sour enough. lol  I recommend about a quarter to one half a jar of tomato paste added to the sauce as it simmers. (small amount as that stuff is potent. lol) Other than that, I might add a bit more cayenne pepper. and less chili powder (maybe half what it calls for.)

A huge hit. I made this and took to a party and people I didn't even know went out of there way to find me and tell me how great it was. Ive also used this to make buffalo pulled chicken sandwiches and it is amazing!

These were excellent and so easy to do.  I don't like frying and my daughter insisted that she wouldn't eat them unless they were fried (like her step mother does!) but she loved them.  I didn't tell her they were baked and it did not come up since she enjoyed them so much and she is very picky.  I subbed in the Thai chili sauce for the tomato sauce as one reviewer suggested.  Thanks so much for this easy and delicious recipe!!

Great hit at this year's 2018 Super Bowl party.  Though I modified it slightly I used a FULL bottle of Franks Hot Buffalo Sauce as the base then added 8 oz. no salt tomatoe sauce 1 1/2 tablespoons of chili powder and I like mine extra spicy I used 2 1/2 teaspoons of cayenne pepper (they are really spicy but not to the point of no return.) Cooked it all together morning of the event in a medium saucepan over medium heat.  While boiling stirring from time to time for five minutes.  Then placed it in the fridge to let it come together until ready to use.  I had the oven at 400...I placed the wings in for 30 min on a baking sheet then took them out coated with sauce and placed back on baking sheet and turned the oven down to 300 for an additional 20 minutes.  While wings finished cooking cut celery into strips.  Once wings were finished place on platter around bowl of blue cheese with celery and poured remaining sauce all over the wings coating them evenly before serving....Eat and Enjoy!!

I doubled the recipe, followed recipe exactly but added 1/3 cup of honey for sweetness and to help thicken and omitted the cayenne.  I used Tobassco pepper sauce and it was plenty hot. Sauce was a little thin but very tasty.

I've made sauces with butter and hot sauce before. But this one also has chili powder and tomato sauce that adds a different twist.  I did not use the cayenne pepper but did substitute five healthy dashes of Cholula sauce.

I agree that 30 minutes baking is much too short. I baked for 25 minutes, flipped 'em, then baked 20 min. more before broiling.

I  first made this in the oven as described and got very uncrispy wings. Then I put them on a rack (the only way to bake and get wings crispy) with equal parts tabasco and butter as a dipping sauce. All the other ingredients in the sauce are unnecessary, especially tomato sauce. Leftover sauce can be added to all sorts of concoctions,  Can't get simpler than that.
