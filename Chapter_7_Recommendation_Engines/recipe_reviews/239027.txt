Never heard of the Sour apple liquor that was suggested (Probably in a different country) but I used Apple flavoured Sour Puss. and it was amazing.  I added a little more sour apple at the end, after tasting, as I wanted a stronger apple flavour but other than that, I made no changes.  These are coming with me to a 40th birthday party :D  Hope they go over well, but if not I'll just have to make the sacrifice of eating them all myself.

My first pudding shot ever. Wasn't too sure about it, but by the second try, I was quite sure I liked it.

We taste tested a couple using the mini ice cream cones, which can be purchased at Winn-Dixie. They were delicious! If you are serving right away, then, no worries. But, the cones will get soft after a while. They still taste amazing but soft ice cream cones are no bueno. I made a dark chocolate ganache and coated the insides of the cones using a basting brush, then chilled for an hour before filling with the pudding. I also upped the vodka content a little. And, the recipe creator suggested using rice to stabilize the cones, but I decided to buy a squeezable package of icing and placed a small dollop on the bottom of the cone, after coating with the ganache, and placing it on a cookie sheet. It worked out really well! Enjoy!

Delicious, used Smirnoff green apple vodka instead of pucker and green food coloring. Came out great.
