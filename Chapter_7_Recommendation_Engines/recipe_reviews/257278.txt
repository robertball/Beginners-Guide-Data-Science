Delicious pound cake! I cut off all the edges and cubed them, and used the cubes in a berry trifle dish for a dessert auction I participated in tonight. Cubes of this pound cake layered with homemade whipped cream and berries. Built the dessert in a clear plastic trifle dish, and it was gorgeous! Traditionally, pound cake uses a pound of butter, a pound of sugar and a pound of flour...the measurements for these ingredients were off that ratio for this recipe, but I still liked it very much! Thanks for sharing your family recipe!

I followed the recipe making no changes.  I will definitely make it again. A very moist pound cake. I always make a pound cake in a very long loaf pan by Wilton.

This is a very good recipe. One to surely be a family tradition. I did cut the sugar back to 2 1/2 cups vs. 3. Other than that, it’s perfect. Thank you for sharing this now to be our family favorite tradition! Blessings!

II've been looking for  a GOOD pound cake recipe for years. THIS THE BEST POUND CAKE I'VE EVER MADE!!!
Even the dogs are hoping Ill drop some crumbs or even a whole piece...Its not begging it being optimistic and helpful. I only changed one thing and that is I like almond extract instead of vanilla. As I said I have been looking for a Good pound cake recipe and this is it. I know that I can add or change things up as I like because the base for it is perfect. So i would recommend this cake to anyone. 

Yes In less than a week I  made this  extraordinary cake again. This time I tweaked it to my tastes and replace 1 c of flour with coconut flour and used half and half instead of milk . I also added an additional egg yolk. This really is a blue ribbon winner recipe and it will be adopted as a nowden family recipe

But I did a twist, I used sugar instead of flour to coat the pan, and I add the zest of 2 lemon and the juice of 1.
