This is a beautiful, moist,and easy cake.
I found a bag of Nestle's Mini Morsels.  They are smaller than mini chips and stay put and don't sink to the bottom.  Found them at Walmart
I cut the morsels to 6 oz. and cake was loaded.
I can't imagine using the whole 12 oz.
Made 2 of these cakes in a 5 day period.  One for a gift.
Be sure and spray well the bundt pan and cool completely.
Thanks for recipe and ismy new go to cake.

This recipe is awesome, and oh so versatile!!  The first time I made it as written, but have since made it 3 other times changing out flavors and additions, every one of which was a big hit!!  I have used dark chocolate cake with vanilla pudding and mini chocolate chips, yellow cake mix with butterscotch pudding and a pkg of heath bar bits, and white cake with pistachio pudding and chopped white chocolate.  Next I am thinking of trying yellow cake, coconut pudding, mashed bananas for half the flour, and walnuts.  Can't wait!

This recipe has been in our family for years too! The only difference is that we use milk instead of water. It's a super easy cake that everyone raves about. We top it with powdered sugar...it's never failed me....I highly recommend trying this cake. Also, I have used this "formula" for other flavors, as other reviewers have, and it's always good!

A nice dense, moist cake.  I too used the mini Morsals, and only about half the 12 oz. bag.  I finished it with the "easy chocolate bundt cake glaze" recipe. Very Good.

This was an easy and delicious cake to make. I have made it twice but didnâ€™t have the right chocolate either time. The first time I ground up unsweetened chocolate, and the second time I ground up chocolate chip, both kinds in a food processor. It might be a little different from the original recipe, but still came out moist and yummy. I did use whole chocolate chips as well both times.

I made this recipe using all ingredients from Aldi!  This cake is so delicious and have already had numerous request to make it again!  Per another suggestion, I also used the chocolate bundt cake glaze recipe. You can't go wrong with this cake!

This recipe will be my go-to cake for when I want something  chocolate-y but not overwhelmingly so.  I made the cake as directed and it turned out perfectly.  Took it to a faculty potluck and it was a huge hit.  Even our health nut principal who usually doesn't eat sweets had to have a piece and raved about it afterward.  I know I'll be making it often.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I baked this cake as is and everyone loved it! So moist and chocolately. I also tried to make a pistachio version by just replacing the vanilla pudding with pistachio pudding but the chocolate chips overpowered the pistachio but still good. Next time I'm gonna add a tsp of almond extract to see if that helps the pistachio. Great recipe!!

My mother used to make this for my birthday. I have yet to find the recipe in her books. I am so happy to have found this recipe. It was loved by all that ate some and is very easy to make. My mother topped it with some of the shavings mixed with some powdered sugar.
