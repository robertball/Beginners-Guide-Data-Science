I hate to sound like a broken record BUT this marinade is amazing.  I did get to inject my turkey but (do to bad planning) we only got to marinate it for 3 hours (15# bird). It was still awesome. The skin was simply delicious and the meat was tender and juicy with such great flavors. We used Peanut Oil, approx. 325 degrees for right at 45 minutes. I cannot wait to use this again!

I used this marinade for Thanksgiving. I was worried the outter crust would be too spicy for my kids. But the pepper mellows after deep frying. I will be using this on all my deep fried turkeys.

I have used the recipe for five years now and I love it. I fry two turkeys for thanksgiving and two for christmas and everyone loves it. I have other families that come over just to eat the turkey. I highly recommend this recipe. Nothing Compares. Helpful hint when frying this turkey if you turn down the heat a little while cooking this turkey it will not turn it black.

The first time my husband and I deep fried a turkey, we injected a marinade.  It was a pain, and it didn't give the meat an all-over flavor.  Since then, we've used this recipe, and THIS IS THE WAY TO GO!!!!  The marinade has the consistency of wet sand.  I rub it on the skin, under the skin, and in the cavity.  Once fried, all the spices become milder and form a sort of crust that you just slice right through.  The meat is tender, moist, and incredibly flavorful.  Awesome, awesome, awesome recipe!

Like most others, I was VERY skeptical about this marinade/rub. I was doing my first Thanksgiving dinner and was very nervous. I kept debating whether to add as much pepper as it called for. And people thought I was nuts when I told them about the recipe. But.. the night before Turkey Day.. My husband and I mixed it all up.. and smeared it on. So it sat overnight. I didn't get much sleep and there were a few times where I just thought about washing the rub off. But.. I didn't. THANK GOD! because it turned out WONDERFUL. The crust was out of this world. I didn't like ANY of the ingredients we mixed together.. but.. added together and cooked like that. Oh my gosh.. just AWESOME. Although, next time.. I think I'd like to inject some italian dressing INTO the turkey. I highly recommend this marinade/rub. And it will be what I use for now on. Oh yeah, and my first Thanksgiving dinner turned out GREAT! and the turkey was a BIG HIT!

I am so glad I read the reviews! This recipe was GREAT! The turkey does look like it is burnt to a crisp.  My husband was horrified when he saw it. However, after I cut it up and gave him a taste he just smiled.  Even the skin tasted wonderful.  I also rubbed some of the spices under the skin.

As others have mentioned, I was skeptical this recipe would work what with all the pepper etc. I tried it. The marinade was the consistency and look of very wet coffee grounds,but I forged ahead. I fried the turkey 3mins/lb plus 5 mins and when I took the turkey out it was almost completely black! I was sure it was burned beyond use. I was serving 27 guests for Thanksgiving and this was to be one of two turkeys served. I sliced a piece and tried it - it was one of the best turkeys I have ever had. Give this a try, we will be making it again. P.S. I injected my turkey with a 1/2 bottle of italian dressing strained to remove the big bits of seasoning and 1/2 cup of Reisling wine. Wonderful compliment to the delicious skin.

We loved this recipe.  this was our first time to make the turkey for thanksgiving and we have tough critics in my family.  the only thing we did different was we brined the turkey for about 14 hours before marinating it with the rub for about 12 hours.  My uncle (the self proclaimed king of the turkey) had me write the recipe down before the meal was over.

My family has been frying turkeys for years.  We have always used the jar marinade that you inject in the turkey prior to frying.  This year I tried this recipe and it was hands down the best turkey I've ever had.  I only had a 10lb turkey so I had a lot of rub left over which I plan to use on chicken next week.  Our turkey did not turn black.  We kept the oil temp between 340 - 350 and it came out a golden brown.

When I first saw this recipe I thought it sounded pretty strange, but once tried it became a favorite with family and friends as well.  The smell coming from the frier is out of this world.

This is my second year and 3rd time making this recipe exactly as written.  We love it!  I made a second turkey this year with an alternative recipe that included an 8 hour brine and different rub.  This was definitely the favorite.  I think I will quit looking for different recipes.  Just bring the oil to 350 before submerging the turkey. Then just don't let the oil go below 325. It should hover between 325-350 degrees at 3 min. per lb plus 3 minutes.  Turkey will be around 155 degrees when you take it out and will rise to 165 by the end of a 30 min. resting period.  I've tried about 6 deep fried turkeys now so I hope these tips help.  This rub is perfect!!!

Turned out good, even though one part of the instructions confused me - do you mix the spices with 3/4 of the BOTTLE of dressing, or 3/4 of a CUP?  Because I used 3/4 of the bottle and it was a bit sloppy, maybe I was supposed to do 3/4 cup...

I have been coming to allrecipes for numerous years when in need of a recipe or inspiration.  It just occurred to me that I have never left a review!  As I am heading into my fourth or fifth Thanksgiving feast, I thought it appropriate to rate this recipe; the first recipe I ever used from this site.  Despite the quantity of peppers, I trusted all the positive reviews and dove head first into my first deep fried turkey.  I am so glad I did!  I come back to this recipe every time a turkey is in the make now!  I have never even tried another recipe for deep fried turkey as there is no need.  The result is maybe not the prettiest, but the flavor is amazing.  The turkey is juicy with just the right amount of flavor; not spicy at all.  I have yet to have this turkey make it to the day after Thanksgiving as everyone continues to pick it clean.  I'm hoping I have soved that problem this year...I'm making two!  My thanks to the submitter and encouragement to everyone thinking about trying it!

This marinade wasn't bad, but it overpowered the turkey and outright clashed with the accompanying traditional holiday side dishes.  The leftovers made a good, spicy meat for sandwiches, but the overpowering flavor made the meat less than ideal for turkey soup or pot pie.  The mariande just permeated everything, and I LOVE spicy foods--I order the hottest wing possible and then add more hot sauce from the bottle.  Perhaps it was the black pepper that overrode all other flavors. I also think this marinade adds spice to the white meat, but doesn't do much for the dark meat, but I also think that's true of deep-frying turkey in general. As a stand alone turkey recipe, it was tasty, but it doesn't complement any holiday side dishes (stuffing, sweet potatoes, etc.) I will not use this marinade for holiday turkey again; I will stick with brining and roasting my bird.

Followed directions exactly, made creole seasoning from this site....bird came out black and everyone thought I burned it, thanks to pics and previous reviews, I knew it might look burned (NOTE: it does not have a burnt taste, the skin is delicious). I calmly told them that was the way it was supposed to look and once they tasted it, the rave reviews were nonstop. I had my sister make a regular turkey just in case (I needed those juices to make my gravy anyway). That turkey was brined and it was delicious as well. I used an electric fryer from QVC, fried the turkey in peanut oil and I couldn't be happier with my new way to cook a turkey! I made cranberry sauce from a recipe on this site....more rave reviews! This really cuts down on oven usage...my dinner was on time for a change!

I followed the recipe, EXACTLY.....  WAS PERFECT !!  Have tried several recipes. This is my hubby's contribution to our turkey day so hated to suggest to let us try this.  He loved it as well and said it was so much easier to prepare. Juicy and tender INSIDE...but, YES!! Blackened outside.  If I had not read the reviews, I would have been concerned. All the family raved about it.  It is a MUST from now on at our Thanksgiving.

Excellent marinade! We decided to forego the ham this Easter and try a deep-fried turkey instead. I chose this recipe based on the amount of good reviews and the reviews couldn't have been more accurate! The marinade was easy and muy delicioso! We followed the recipe exactly and used it on a 20-pound turkey, which still had tons of flavor even though the original recipe called for a 12-14 pound turkey. The turkey did come out looking like a charred bird, but I expected this from what another reviewer wrote. My oh my, was it good! Everyone loved it! They all want to replace the cooking method we usually use with this one for Thanksgiving. Terrific recipe!
* If you've never deep fried a turkey before, I highly recommend watching some YouTube videos on this cooking method. We felt better prepared in case of an emergency and we were better prepared on how to use the fryer properly.

I worried a bit that someone might have concocted this recipe as a joke, then populated the reviews with hundreds of raves about it in order to prank people's Thanksgivings by ruining their turkeys.  It is a hell of a lot of pepper you're putting on this bird.  The spice rub was painful to taste.    I made it anyway, and man, was it good.  The reviews are correct -- the hotness seems to burn off, leaving only flavor behind.  Totally delicious, and several at the table asked for the recipe.  Even some usually picky kids asked for seconds.

I was apprehensive about this recipe-so much cayenne pepper!  We deep fried a turkey this weekend and it was spectacular!  I served it with slow cooker mashed potatoes and sweet green been bundles.  We enjoyed one of the best meals I have ever made!

What a crowd pleaser.  I have made this turkey for my office (two years now), my inlaws and my extended family and they are all wanting more.  Thanksgiving and Christmas now.  No more dry birds in my house.  it's the best you'll ever eat! Cook for 3.5 minutes per pound, insert bird into 400* oil, keep steady at 325* until done.

It was definitely too spicy and peppery for me. I think this is because we also injected the mixture into the turkey. I would NOT recommend injecting the turkey. It made thick channels of turkey that was so spicy that it was not edible.

AMAZING!!!!  I read this recipe and all the reviews and decided to try it.  It was my first time frying a turkey (2) and I was amazed that I didn't have to inject it.  I marinated them from 8pm to 1pm, and my brother kept watch over the fryer.  I'm glad I read the reviews because I was a little shocked over how dark it was.....But EVERY LAST BIT WAS DELICIOUS ANNNNNND NOT BURNT!  We ate 18lbs of turkey on TG.  The remaining 6 are frozen for soups, sondwiches and tacos.     I did reduce the amount of pepper, but next time I'll be more daring.

I wasn't going to write a review for this recipe because I was afraid I might be flamed afterwards.  However, when 6 people sat at the table and said the Turkey was too spicy, I have to do this.
1/2 cup of pepper is way, way too much for a 10 lbs turkey, maybe good for an ostrich.  
Not only that, you throw in equal amounts of cayenne?  Then why not?  Just dump in some more spice by adding 1 more cup of Creole.
Maybe one of these ingredients with the Italian dressing would be perfect.  Now, I am not new to spice, I am Thai and cook Thai food all the time (read:3-5 times a week).
However this recipe was trying to be spicy for the sake of being spicy.  It wasn't hot, just toooooooo much spice.
This isn't my first deep fried turkey either, and I love the crispy skin.  Yep, no one ate the skin.  The black pepper just smacks you in the face "HELLO!!  I AM HERE!!!"

Maybe my deep fried technique is wrong?  350 for 40 minutes.  Also checked the inside temp to be 180 degrees.  So, I have enough turkey meat left, maybe I can cook 15 servings of Cajun pasta.  I am sure there is enough spice on the turkey meat for that.

Corrective action:  If you are unsure about the spiciness of this rub.  Just use the Italian dressing with the 1 cup of Creole dressing, 2 tablespoons of garlic powder, and inject the turkey with some garlic butter.

I made this thanksgiving 2011 because of all the rave reviews and I regret that more people were not honest about the outcome.  This marinade is very hot to start, and yes, it is spicy when you eat the turkey.  Not a 10 on 1-10 scale hot, but more like a 7. Additionally, the marinade turns VERY SALTY for some reason.  I had 2 hypertensives who couldn't eat their dinner.   We threw all the skin away so we didn't have to taste the hot spices with our leftovers.  On a positive note, it was moist, as all fried turkeys usually are when done correctly.   However, the flavor of this turkey DOES NOT GO WITH TRADITIONAL THANKSGIVING SIDE DISHES.  I will make it again, but not as my go to thanksgiving recipe.  I would use this more for a tailgate or superbowl event with potato salad etc.   I wish others who used it for thanksgiving had been more honest.  Sorry, just not good for thanksgiving, but it was OK....

For those of you who never liked Turkey and only had it because it was tradition, this recipe will change your mind!  Absolutely mouth watering!  Let me say, I am not the best cook.  You can't imagine how proud I was to serve something so tasty at Christmas last year.  EVERYONE loved it and raved about it for weeks.  Getting ready to make this again as I can't wait till Christmas :)  Also, not spicy like you may think...just so flavorful and juicy! Heavenly!  Thank you to the person who provided this recipe....I am your biggest fan!

Wow. This was the best turkey that I have ever eaten. My family raved about it throughout the entire meal. You will not need to inject the turkey with this marinade. I smeared the marinade on the turkey around 8pm on a Saturday and deep fried it around 5pm the next day. The turkey was very flavorful but not spicy. Perfect.

This was the best fried turkey my husband and I have ever had. Everyone told us that the amount of pepper in the recipe would be too much, but they were wrong. Trust the recipe and you will not be disappointed. Children and the elderly loved the flavor as well. Thanks so much!!!

This was the best turkey we have ever fixed.  We fixed a 16.2 lb. turkey and this made plenty of rub.  I may cut the recipe in half for the next one. I also sneezed and coughed while fixing it and while washing the dish I marinaded it in, but it was well worth it.  Be sure to wear gloves while putting it on the turkey.  All that pepper can make your hands burn.  We will use this rub forever more.

Used this recipe last night to fry my first turkey at a tailgate party. It was FABULOUS!  It didn't turn out "black" as others have mentioned.  It was juicy and delicious and the skin had a great spice to it.  Only comment I have is I would probably 1/2 the recipe next time.  A lot of spice was wasted.

This rub makes the skin almost the best thing about the bird! Word to the wise though, dont sample rub prior to cooking as the cayenne is altered in the cooking process to be spicy, not lava-ish, just ask my Mom!LOL

I was skeptical, but tried it because of the other reviews.  This was incredible, juicy, moist, and not spicy!  This is the only way to have turkey, I promise.  I don't think I will ever be able to eat a baked boring turkey again.

I made this marinade last year for our deep fried turkey...It was the best turkey I had ever tasted!!  I followed reader's suggestions to add ALL of the pepper and was glad I did. This marinade did not make the meat spicy whatsoever...just marvelous flavor! Looking so forward to making it in again for my family this year!

Not bad.  Tastes better than it looks.  Not too spicy.  Goes on like coffee grounds, but flows out over the turkey with time.

Trust the 5-star rating!! and even if you're skeptical --  Don't change a thing!!  We've been frying our t-day turkeys for years now -- and we typically make 3-4 turkeys each time, injecting with the various marinades available, as well as experimenting with our own.  Without any injecting whatsoever, this was by far THE MOST FLAVORFUL turkey of them all!!!  If you want a more traditional, straight-up turkey flavor, choose something milder.  If you prefer lots of flavor - go with this!  (and as others have said, turn the heat down a bit to avoid blackening the skin).  Totally awesome.  We'll do at least one of these from now on.

It was awesome.  I will make it again.  I have deep fried turkeys before so I was confident in the procedures I was doing, but it does turn BLACK about 15 minutes into deep frying.  I recommend watching the video so you know you are doing it right because with some of the negative post, those people saying it was spicy probably injected the marinade into the turkey.  It is a marinade for the outside.  Don't inject, otherwise the oil won't burn the spices away.   Mine wasn't spicy at all and I don't like spicy foods.  When preparing the marinade, I can see why people were worriedabout it being spicy, but it will come out perfect.

A couple of people weren't paying attention when I said it was going to come out BLACK.  They thought I murdered the turkey.  We cut into it and it was nice and juicy.  Read up on how long to cook per pound and at what temp, but we did it at 350 degrees (was hovering around 325 degrees for some time as it heated up after putting the turkey in.  3.5 minutes per pound.  18lb bird was just over an hour.  Also I multiplied the mixture by 1.5 since the original amount is for a 12-14lb bird.  Again, look online for proper cooking temperatures, etc.  Some Government sites have standards to follow, make sure you read those.  But, the temp and time perpound was what they told me.

This marinade is awesome!  I always brine my turkey for about 12- 14 hours before I apply the marinade.  Suggestion: You may try placing the turkey in a large turkey sizes oven bag and then have someone hold the bag open while you apply the marinade.  This will help eliminate a mess and will also make for easy placement in your refrigerator.  You are also able to work your marinade on the turkey while in the bag.  When ready to fry throw the bag away for an easy clean up!

OMGoodness!!  This recipe is perfect!  This is only my second time frying a turkey.  The first one did not turn out well.. I decided to try again, using this recipe. Reading the recipe instructions, I couldn't fully believe I could have a moist turkey without injecting it with something.  This turkey is moist through and through.  The day after frying this delicious turkey, I warmed some leftovers (very few) in the microwave.  The meat was still moist and tasty!  I went out and purchased another turkey to fry, using this recipe!  I followed the instructions exactly and I had a turkey that was the best I'd ever had!  My fried turkey search is over!  Thank you, thank you, thank YOU!!

This is a great recipe.  The turkey came out really juicy and definitely not too spicy. The marinade was too thick for the injector so I rubbed it under the skin and in the cavity and it came out great.

Much better than the injector type turkey I had been frying. Yes, it looks like a red turkey smeared with wet coffee grounds.  But it smells wonderful and doesn't taste that hot.  Blackened turkey?!? exclaimed my DH, but he adored the end result.

I went by the exact recipe. I didn't have a deep fryer and my son-in-law offered to fry it at his place and bring it over to our place, which I gladly accepted. (I warned my daughter that it would look burnt when he brings it out of the oil, don't panic). Well she forgot to tell him, and he totally freaked out. lol  They get it to my place, with the foil covering it. (I didn't peak). After we gave thanks,I lifted the foil, my family of about 20 surrounding the feastive table of yummy dishes,including myself, freaked out! OMG, it DOES look burnt, of course I calmed everyone down while cutting into it. So juicy, so tender, so yummy!  They all laughed and couldn't believe how good it really was while seeing how awful it really looked.  Thanks for a great memory. Of course the teenagers had to take a pic and post it on facebook.  The comments were hilarious!  Happy Thanksgiving to all.  Now time for Christmas.

I used this rub for my first deep fried turkey.  I was worried my 12 y/o wouldn't eat it--she hates spicey foods.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was amazing!!  We all loved it, including my 12 y/o.  I can't wait to cook another!  We had no left overs, they picked the carcus clean.

November 2010: I was really nervous while I was rubbing the turkey down with this marinade. I was not only feeding adults but children and I kept worrying that the marinade would be to hot for the kids. I was amazed at how much "heat" the deep frying took out of the pepper and seasoning. My kids raved and the adults were in heaven.
December 2011: We just used this recipe on a different set of friends and children. Exact same response. Everyone loved it. 
The thing I learned this time around: the oil is so expensive, so don't waste it. That meant this time we fried three turkeys and then removed the meat and ended up vacumn sealing it for future dinners.

Like all other reviews this recipe was a hit! First turkey I've ever made for Christmas. No worries about how spicey the rub is precooked because it does mellow out to a great flavor! My fiance loved it and his father said it was better than grandma's turkey! ;) A recipe I will be making time and time again. I did leave the turkey to sit after cooking for about an hour with foil over it just so the juices redistributed and the turkey was not dry at all! Thank you for the recipe!

It was our first time deep frying a turkey and this was a big hit.  Everyone raved about it and said how moist and tasty it was.  We had a 14lb bird and there was plenty of rub.  Will definately use again.

Very good!  Left my oil quite dark and I feel weird about using it again, but it is too expensive to only use on one turkey.  The skin was so delicious.

Wow, is all I can say.  My first fried Turkey for Thanksgiving was an huge success.  Thanks to this marinade.  Initially I was thinking that using 1 cup of any seasoning would be over-kill, in fact  when I got to the Cayenne Pepper, I had a coughing attack due to the large quantity of it that the recipe calls for.  But after the turkey cooked, you could not tast the cayenne pepper at all.  It was very flavorable.

There is really no comparison to this recipe.  I made it the first time on a guys weekend and it was a hit.  Those I've shared it with will not use any other recipe when deep frying a turkey.  I think some of the negative reviews are not doing something right.  You don't inject the seasonings, just half of the strained Italian dressing by itself.  The seasonings mixed with the other half of the dressing (unstrained) is what you rub outside and under the skin where possible.  Incredible flavor, not spicy at all.

Best turkey I have ever had hands down. Everyone loved it and we are still enjoying the left overs. The flavor permeates through the skin all the way down to the bone. I let it marinate for 18 hours and fried it for 55 minutes at 325.  The smell, the juiciness, the flavor, out of this world. Fry turkey fry!

Deep fried my first turkey this Thanksgiving, and it was a hit.  Usually there is turkey left over, but all that was left was the bone.  My family raved over it and said don't change a thing.  My turkey was 17.6 pounds and was nervous the turkey wasn't seasoned enough, as the recipe is for a 14lb turkey.  Strained some of the marindate to inject it into the turkey.  The turkey was definitely cajun and everyone LOVED IT! The peanut oil grease was 350 before the turkey went in and dropped to 300 degrees after the turkey went in and stayed there.  The Turkey came out crispy as expected but not black, but a dark golden brown.  It cooked for exactly 57 minutes . Will definitely do this again.

Excellent!!!! Deep fried (in an indoor electric turkey frier) a 7 lb turkey breast for my boyfriend and I.  Used the entire rub on the turkey breast and it turned out perfect!!!  Took about 55 minutes for it to be done (which was about 10 minutes longer than expected). Will use this recipe only from here on out!

YOU WILL STAND A BETTER CHANCE OF BURNING THE SKIN WITH OIL, THAT IS WHY PEANUT OIL IS BEST, ALSO YOUR TURKEY WILL NOT BE AS GREASY AND FOR SOME REASON IT IS MORE MOIST WITH PEANUT OIL.

My turkey turned out awesome! The turkey was really dark, which got everyone asking if I'd burnt the bird, but all jokes ceased when they tasted it. It was my 1st time frying a turkey but it won't be the last. My family picked the bird clean. For the 1st time ever, there were no turkey leftovers.

Won first place at the turkey fry! Like other reviewers, we were alarmed at the amount of spices, and the turkey was black when we pulled it from the oil, but it was freaking delicious. We brined our turkey using Alton Brown's recipe.

Great recipe. I strained the dressing, so I can inject the dressing in the turkey. I used an 18 lb turkey and deep fryed it for 45 minutes. Then let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving. Moist and delicious turkey. Will not make the traditional oven method again. Thanks for the recipe.

We always deep fry one turkey and grill the other one. Hands down deep fried turkey is the best. In addition to this recipe I injected the turkey with melted butter mixed with creole seasoning and garlic powder. It was great!!!

Delicious and easy.  Marinade rub is extremely spicy and hot when you first put it on or taste test it - but once turkey is fried, all heat is dispated, leaving behind nothing but outstanding flavor.  Heated oil to 325 and fried approx 3 1/2 minutes per pound.

We deep-fry a Turkey every Thanksgiving. For the past couple of years, we have used this recipe. Last year we made 2 turkeys. This one and an injected one. The whole family preferred this turkey and suggested I don't bother with any other unless it is a traditional baked turkey. I am thinking this has become the traditional turkey in our house. I like having the space in my oven and my husband is the one who stands outside in the cold and deep-fries. I mix the marinade a day or two before and apply to thawed turkey. I recommend wearing disposable gloves to rub marinade on turkey. AWESOME! TASTY!

I just tried this recipe for Christmas dinner with the family and they left with the recipe so they can have it again! I tried another injected marinade and it can't hold a candle to this. And for the crispy skin lovers....don't be put of by the "burnt" look, my husband put some of the skin on the serving platter and nothing came back to the kitchen! Great recipe!!

My search for the perfect, easy marinade for deep fried turkey has ended.  Thank you!  I used this marinade for Thanksgiving with my family and everyone loved it, even my mother who thinks that white bread is spicy.  The bird was not spicy, just extremely flavorful.  I will admit that I was pretty nervous in regards to the amount of pepper and the bird coming out black.  It was worth the intial worry and this will be the recipe I continue to use.

We used this for 2008 Thanksgiving turkey.  It was really good.  Do not lick your fingers after rubing on turkey, it's super hot!  But it is not hot when it's on the turkey.

This is a GREAT marinade/rub! I ran out of black pepper (I know....who runs out od black pepper?) so I skipped that, but used everything else the same. I also chose to grill my turkey instead of frying it (because I didn't have turkey fryer) It was fantastic. Like alot of the other reviews have said....My husband has requested that I always make the turkey this way for Thanksgiving!!!

This was our first deep-fried turkey, and it was the best turkey we've ever made!  We were a little worried that it would be too spicy, but it turned out perfectly seasoned.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This makes the best and flavorful crust on the turkey and it may seem like alot of cayenne but it's not.  My daughter who is 7 ate it and my nephews. This will be one to keep for frying turkeys for us.

5 adults just enjoyed a 16+ pound turkey and all agree it's a 5 star hands down!!! It's not a rub, it's a paste, and yes, the turkey comes out black, but YUM YUM YUM YUM YUM!!!! I was certainly nervous about the amount of pepper but I didn't change a thing and it was PERFECT!!!  Next time I may inject it, but it's not necessary...and my mother who has enjoyed 70 Thansigivings requests that this is how we make it for the next, I wonder if we can really wait 7 months before making this awesome turkey again??

Although the other reviews were great, our turkey turned out dry and didn't have much flavor at all. THe rub was very hard to work with and difficult to spread on the turkey. For the amount of spices in the recipe, ours just didn't have the flavor you would expect.

This is our first deep fried turkey experience.  The morning of thanksgiving I got out all the ingredients and then realized I missed the part of marinating and injecting 8 hours or overnight.  We only had three hours and the outside rub was still perfect.  The inside could have been more flavorful, but it was simply because it didn't have enough time. I couldn't stop eating the crust as the flavor was incredible.  Not an overwhelming cajun taste as we had all the traditional thanksgiving side dishes and it complemented it perfectly.  My only note is that the rub recipe made way too much!  I rubbed a very liberal amount on the outside and inside and still had over half of the recipe left (our turkey was 14 lbs).  I wonder though if the rub wouldn't taste great on ribs? Try this!

This recipe was PHENOMENAL!!  This was my first time making the turkey...After reading all if the reviews I followed the recipe. The only thing I did different was inject the turkey with Italian dressing. I used every grain of seasoning inside an outside of the bird, and let marinade overnight in a large food grade bag (18lb turkey).

I used my butterball xl turkey fryer at 325* for roughly 1hr 20 mins. When I pulled it out, it was cooked exactly at 165*. At first taste I thought it was salty, but after carving and serving it BOOM! The flavor was out of this world! It cooked perfectly and did not appear burned.

Everyone loved it, but the ultimate compliment was seeing the turkey platter empty at the end of the night (usually we have a little left over).

I am DEFINITELY using this recipe next year!

Used this three years in a row and everyone loves it.  It's not spicy at all like some reviewers say (not sure what they did wrong).  I hate spicy (even mild salsa) foods and so do my kids but we gobble this up!

This was my first time deep frying a turkey and this was the perfect marinade. I have tried vairious oven recipes from this site over the years but none were such a hit as this. In addition, my family has not been big turkey eaters, there were some that even said don't bother with a turkey this year. Well this was the best turkey we ever had. Definetly not spicey so don't worry about the cayenne pepper. The kids loved it. Not greasy. Will make again and again. Used zatarains creole seasoning. I also injected with 2tspns of kosher salt and 1 stick of unsalted melted butter.

I made mine the night before and then marinated overnight (well, about 12 hrs) - it ended up being too spicy on the outside for me but my husband liked it. I will try this one again but only let it sit for about 6 hours...or reduce the pepper a bit...

We tried this for Thanksgiving yesterday and really loved it! The flavor was fantastic! We also injected a separate marinade and fried the bird.. and the combo of the two made for a world class turkey!! Thanks for sharing your great recipe!  One word of caution:  this rub did end up turning our turkey black in the fryer.. so some of that was inedible. But it still tasted great and the bird was not burnt... just blackened. Just be forewarned!

Amazing turkey!!!  I am so glad I found this recipe.  My family could not stop raving about this turkey.  Like others noted, the rub is more like a coating and it takes some time to get it on the bird.  I had about 1/8 of an inch covering the breast and tops of the legs, and just did the best I could with the other parts, but this worked fine.  We will make this our new family tradition!

There is only one word to describe this recipe - INCREDIFREAKINLICIOUS!!!!  My family is very competitive and you HAVE to come up with something new to keep you in the "game".  So, having said that, when I looked at this recipe, I was really skeptical even though I read all the raving reviews.  Nevertheless I plowed ahead and made the rub.  I rubbed it under and on top of the skin as well as the inner cavity. I felt like I was giving the turkey a massage!!  I also injected the turkey with 1 cup italian dressing, strained and  1/2 cup white riesling wine.  

OMGoodness!!!  This was, HANDS DOWN, THE BEST TURKEY I HAVE EVER MADE!  I also made a beer and butter injected turkey.  21 guests later, both turkeys are picked clean!  

My neices and nephews both said this was the best turkey they have ever eaten.  So, thanks Allrecipes.com because now I'm at the top of my game in the family cooking competition!!!

Simply delicious! I only used half of the portions for the peppers and creole seasoning, let it marinade for 3 days before cooking and my southern husband absolutely loved it, and won't stop raving about the flavor which left my nose runny from the kick it has. Will be a staple in our household when frying turkey.

We just tried this marinade.  It is wonderful.  We fried it at 325 for 45 minutes. It does not need any more time.  As the others have said, the spices marry well and it is not too much. I'll be using this again

I was so nervous to use this for the big T-Day.  The ingredients seem overly spicy and I was sneezing for an hour after using it.  This was a HUGE HIT!  Proclaimed The Best Thanksgiving Ever! from the in-laws.  I injected some Italian dressing with it and man it was good.  Thank you so much!

I haven't made this yet but was wondering how I can ensure I get a golden brown turkey instead of a indigo black turkey? My brine has honey (sugar) in it. If I keep everything in my brine the same (2 quarts veg broth, 1 lb salt, 1 gallon of water) and omit the honey, will that help to prevent the blackening of the bird? This marinade scares me but the rave reviews are too positive NOT to try it.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was so good I've been requested to make the same turkey for Christmas!  Christmas turkey- hahaha.  The turkey was spicy if you got some of the rub, but you could "mix" in as much spice as you wanted bc the rub was on the skin!  A 13lb bird took me 55 mins at 325*.  A+

This was really tasty.  We did two turkeys, the brine in Brown Sugar and Water and this recipe.  It turned out really tasty and the deep frying ensures it's moist!  Ours did end up darkening to a very dark, dark brown, but it didn't taste burnt at all and believe me, we eat the skin!  The marinade made so much that we didn't use it all and there was enough left for a whole other turkey.  I would also recommend gloves for sensitive skin.  Really off the wall, but great recipe!!

Yum!!!  This was my first time frying a turkey and I have to say that it turned out yummy!  The skin was really tasty because of this rub.  Yes it does turn black while frying and the flavors meld really well.  It was not too peppery or spicy at all...just right.

it was great - a few words of caution:  the rub is like wet sand and it is somewhat difficult to apply.  scoop it in your hand and dip in the extra salad dressing - it makes the application easier.  We applied approximately 1/4 inch on the breats and the legs...it was awesome.  It looks somewhat gross before you deep fry, but it will come out awesome..plus it smells crazy good.

WOW! This was great!  It was by far the best marinade I've ever tried.  The only thing I did different was I put the turkeys in large zip-loc bags with the marinade for 3 days.  I was afraid that it would be to spicy but not at all.  It had a wonderful flavor. We have no turkey left after only 1 day! Thanks for the great recipe!

The turkey turned out so juicy!  My whole family loved it!!  However, comparing it to other fried turkeys I have had it wasn't quite as good as using the Creole Butter bought out of the store.  (and that is less work)

OK, This was my first time frying a turkey so I looked all over for advice and recipes. This recipe seemed to be the best. Like all the other reviewers I was a bit taken back by all the pepper but I pushed through it. WOW, this is fantastic. I have VERY picky kids. They will not eat anything spicy, ever. They loved this. All the women came over and said "it is burnt" "why is it so black". I tented it for 15 min., carved it, brought it to the table, the only thing left was 1/2 a breast and one leg, skin and all. Did I mention it was a 20lb turkey for only 10 people.

We made this for Thanksgiving for my entire "traditional is the only was to go" family.  The only reason that this rub received less than 5 stars is because it served more as a coating vs. a rub that seasoned the turkey.  As a coating, it was very tasty - and shockingly NOT peppery (have to be honest, we were terrified at the amount of pepper in this recipe).  We have fried over 10 turkeys and this is probably the best coating.  The only suggestion that I would make is that next time (and there will be a next time with this coating) is that some Italian Dressing should be injected into the turkey.  And the reaction from my tradition-loving family?  They loved it!!

I consider myself pretty gourmet - and was a little skeptical as well when I saw the ingredients. But I was willing to take a chance. Suspend your disbelief - this is an excellent recipe that I highly recommend. I made it for a pre-Thanksgiving gathering of friends who all loved it. Would make again.

I HATED turkey until this recipe which changed my mind forever.  We make this every year and it's to DIE for.  Yes, like others have said, it WILL come out black but no worries, it's not burnt!  Everyone raves about this every time we make it.  This year I think I'm going to try a brine prior to deep frying.

I was very skeptical with trying this recipe since this was my 1st fried turkey. The turkey tasted great! I just didn't like the burnt look of the skin. Is it any way to get around the burnt look? It doesn't look pretty on the table.

This is the only marinade I use when I deep fry turkeys. I love the taste and it is not to hot as you would think it would be. Everyone who has my turkeys rave about how great it tastes. I've been asked for the recipe multiple times. I half the recipe because I always have to much unused.

Awesome recipe! My husband was afraid to try it and actually started regreting doing it after we coated the bird. But we read all the reviews and decided to give it a chance. So glad we did, it turned out delicious and everyone loved it!

Used this recipe last year & we all absolutely loved it, we will never bake a turkey in the oven ever again. This made such an amazing crust on the turkey but yet it wasn't over powering in flavor. All I can say is thanks for sharing this with us :)

We made our first deep fried turkey for Thanksgiving and used this recipe. It was deliciously moist and tender--even when we were finishing up left overs a week later. No dry turkey here! Every bite was juicy and flavorful.

THIS WAS AMAZING!!! We tried our first deep fried turkey this year and wanted a great marinade. This definately surpassed all expectations. I was really scared about all the hot spices in it but it was not spicy at all. I can not eat anything to spicy and I could even eat the skin on this, which I do not do. Out of 9 people, 6 were children and they all loved it. We did marinate it for 24 hours too. So from the words of my 4 year old niece "You are the best cooker, that was the goodess bird" LOL.....Thanks :)

Best tasting turkey EVER!!! We took a chance on this marinade and we are so glad we did!  Do not get scared of all the spices!  It is not spicy after it is fried!!!  It is just the tastiest and juiciest turkey you will ever taste!  My 8 year old son who is the pickiest eater and allergic to everything under the sun... tried a piece of the hot crunchy skin and he was hooked! He ate a full Thanksgiving dinner for the first time ever! I think that says it all! Try it, you will never want to eat turkey any other way. Easy, great recipe!!

I made one of these turkeys last year to compliment the baked turkey my mother made.  I was informed this year I would be frying 2 of these, and we won't bake any.  Don't be scared by the cayenne.  It is not spicy.

wow! followed the recipe, but didn't own a deep frier.  Marinated a 12 lb bird for 48 hrs.  After 48 hrs scraped most of the paste off the bird put about 1/4 cup in the cavity and smeared it around. baked at 425 for 30 mins, then turned the oven to 250 and 20 mins  per lb of turkey The skin was  too hot to eat but the sauce in the pan with the meat dipped in it WOW!!!

Our first attempt at deep frying a turkey and it was AWESOME. Better than we ever expected.  Very good!  Looks like it's burnt but somehow it's not.  But it is very moist.  We ate the whole turkey in a day and plan to make many, many more.

Amazing!  I picked this recipe up in a hurry for my company holiday party.  Most people have had fried trukey but not a "cajun" fried turkey.  This was a hit and looked like pirhanna had attacked it within 20 minutes of carving the first bit off.  Excellent recipe.  I used a 15 pound bird at 350 and everything came out beautiful.

First time frying a turkey; great recipe, family loved it, pepper was NOT overpowering, used Kraft Tuscan house italian and opted for minced garlic and freshly ground pepper (that took a long time).  Can only say this is definetly one of the best fried turkey recipes I've tasted.

Adds very good flavor to the turkey.  Used the Creole Seasoning recipe on this site and reduced the amount of cayenne pepper to 1/4 cup, allowed to marinate overnight.  Wasn't too spicy at all (didn't eat the skin though).  Next time I will use the full 1/2 cup of cayenne pepper and it will probably be even better!

I've always used cayenne powder.  B/c the bird is damp, the powder stays on the skin and is easier to marinate in my opinion.

All I can say is...FABULOUS!!!!
The skin did come out black (and I tried to keep the burner to 350 degrees), but no complaints from anyone at all!!  It was a medium turkey but was gone in a few days.  Thanks!  Hubby and I will ALWAYS keep to this recipe.

This is my thired year using this recipe.  I rub the turkeys 3 days before we fry them, wrap them in heavy plastic bags and pack them in an ice chest and take them with us to our annual sanddune trip.  After a 1 1/2 days I turn them over and repack them in the ice chest.  They are simply delicious.  You can inject them if you want but it isn't necessary.  Everyone raves about the flavor.

This was my first time frying a turkey and i used this marinade and i must say that it was the best tasting turkey i've ever had.  The flavor was not overpowering and even though the skin was black, it was absolutely delicious.

I used this recipe last year and it was absolutely wonderful!  It was my first time frying a turkey, so I was fearfult that the marinade would make the turkey too hot.  Boy was I wrong!  The flavor of the turkey was perfect.  It was so perfect that people have been asking for me to do the turkey again this year and I, therefore, and to come back to find it.  Others have tried to order turkeys from me?  Thanks for a great recipe.

Used it at christmas and it was pretty good.  Everyone loved it but i expected the skin to be crispier and the inside to be more tender.  I even injected with 1/2 bottle of italian dressing but didn't much like that taste.  I did cut down on the pepper some and I won't do that next time, and next time I will inject with beer and let sit for 2 days or so.

Yes, I was nervous about trying this recipe, but trust me it's delicious. Decided to search on-line for a new recipe for Thanksgiving and this one was a WINNER. The flavor is awesome!! In the pass my family complained the turkey is to dry, not this one. Very juicy. Our 10lb turkey was eaten in 1 day. I will pass this recipe on to others.

This is so good there are not words that will describe this rub. I will defiantly use this for all my birds I deep fry. I was a little worried when making it, when it started to make me sneeze and cough. Even washing out the platter that the bird was sitting on made me cough. But this is the most tasty and juice bird that we have ever done. Don’t worry about the spices it really does mellow when you deep fry the bird. I also used a Creole butter injector which gave the inside a little kick too. Loved it. We just couldn't stop eating it.

I tried this recipe for the first time for a big family thanksgiving diner several years ago.  I was very skeptical  and concerned when I started putting all the ingredients together.  Because of all the wonderful reviews, I kept going and followed the recipe.
I am so glad I didn’t turn back.  Although my family had several comments about how black the turkey looked. I had very little turkey left over to bring home.  I’ve been asked to make the turkey ever since.  The only thing I added to my process is, prior to cooking my turkey I put it in a brine for about two days  before marinading it.  Don’t let the peppery seasonings keep you from trying it.  It will not make your turkey  taste  spicy hot. You will have great flavors.

Resulted in an amazing, juicy, tasty bird. At first I wasn't going to follow thru with deep frying this 22.5 lb bird after reading posts online but I'm glad i did! This is our first fried turkey and it blew everyone away. Id be afraid to try another recipe in fear of disappointment compared to how succulent & juicy this turned out. Most posts I've found suggest cooking in oil at 350 degrees at 3 - 3.5 min per pound. We dropped this bad boy in at 350 and could barely get oil  back above 250, continued at that for 1hr 15 minutes and this 22.5 lb. bird was cooked perfect, 160 - 180 throughout. We used a 26 quart fryer I borrowed, made a heck of a mess splattering oil on concrete patio dropping it in as slow as could be.. so i will certainly be investing into a much larger pot. What i don't get is if this big bird was PERFECT (and i mean perfect) at 250 degrees at little over 3 min per pound, i imagine this and any other bird would be over cooked and less juicy at the higher temp for same amount of time.. IDK but I'll be paying even more close attention to temps & times from here out.

This was fantastic. I did not add the cayenne pepper because I  was afraid it would be too spicy. Just the creole seasoning and Italian dressing and pepper   Marinaded overnight 
Flavor thru out was amazing. Moist and flavorful. 
The skin did look burnt like others said but did not taste burned at all. Was delicious 
I will make this again. Might add a little cayenne next time lol

Best turkey I have ever eaten! It was so incredibly juicy with tons of flavor. We have tried this recipe the last 3 years and we finally got it right. I think the secret to this year’s success was giving the oil plenty of time to get to temperature. It always takes longer than we think, so we have to rush to get the turkey in. The oil dropped almost 100 degrees when we put the turkey in but that was okay. The outside had time to sear and hold in all of the juices.  This marinade is delicious. After rubbing it all over the outside of the skin, I also rubbed it between the turkey and the skin, which gave it an amazing flavor since we don’t eat the skin. Some bites had zingers of spiciness so next time I will add a little less of the peppery marinade under the skin, but I won’t change a thing about the recipe. So good!!

This was stellar!!  Followed the recipe as written and allowed the turkey to marinade overnight. Deep frying pretty much killed the oil but the flavor of the bird was totally worth it!

The neat was juicy and flavorful.  Everyone liked the meat.  The skin, while crispy, was quite spicy.  If you are not a fan of spicy food then skip eating the skin. 

One more on quantities:  The recipe as written is way more than is required.  I had an 11 pound Turkey and I had about 2/3 left over.  I applied the seasonings to the skin and to the meat below the as well.

This was my first turkey ever! I like everyone else was scared about it being too spicy but this was amazing!  I put the whole bottle of dressing but that was because my following directions isn’t that good. I did blot the inside in the am after it had marinated all night. The smell was awesome and everyone couldn’t wait to taste. A total hit in my house even if it looked a little burnt

We have made this recipe at least half a dozen times. No one in my household really likes turkey, or at least we didn't think that we did. This recipe made us really enjoy turkey. So much flavor so moist! Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.

I had to find this recipe again for Thanksgiving this year because it was such a hit last year. At first I was worried about the amount of pepper but like another reviewer said, it's different after frying. It even smells great while cooking! Definitely recommend trying it!

We loved this recipe!! This was my first deep fried turkey
! I followed the instructions to the letter, and that was one delicious turkey. My husband kept going in the kitchen stealing pieces. At one point he and my son were missing and I found them sharing a drum stick.
This recipe  will be the only one I ever use for fried turkey.
 
I'm not afraid anymore.

We used this marinade yesterday for our fried turkey, I let it marinate about 12 hours. Even though I read through the reviews and others had said how black it came out I was still worried when ours came out and I was worried it was ruined but once we cut it, we had the most flavorful turkey we've ever had and it wasn't dry or too spicy at all.

Making it for the third Thanksgiving straight! Deleted the cayenne pepper and cut the Creole seasoning in half because my family doesn't like too much spice. Everyone always comes back for seconds!

Followed the instructions (massaged the turkey with the ingredients), put in a bag. and let sit overnight.  Perfect.  Absolutely phenomenal.  Adding a fried turkey to Thanksgiving meal was nerve-racking because you only get one chance to do it right.  With this marinade and the perfect turkey frying time (appr 3-4 mins per lb, plus 3 mins), this will be a hit.   It will look "burnt" but it's going to be moist and juicy on the inside and the skin will be delicious!

This turned out very well the addition of Italian dressing made a good impression, but you might reccomend a good Italian dressing, they vary so much, I put a dash of hot sauce in it it made it more flavorful, and not really hot.

I blackened mine so it has a crunchy outer shell but a juicy succulent center. My family absolutely loves it they haven't stop talking about it. I made turkey drums and a breast so it's really good. A + on the marinade.

Excellent, excellent marinade! Very easy to throw together. The marinade was much thicker than I anticipated. I thought I might inject some of it in the meat, but it was much too thick. Very delicious though. I marinated for about 18 hours and the meat came out PERFECT! Very juicy and tender. I will make this again!

I was in a panic attack after losing my old laptop with this recipe on it.  I finally found this again and Thanksgiving is saved.  Don't change a thing, just make it, rub your bird, and fry that big daddy up.  I fry about 6 turkeys every year between Thanksgiving and Christmas and I use this rub every time.  I love it, people I cook for love it, and I'm always asked to come back and do it again the next time.  Thank you!!!

Looking at this marinade as you are mixing and rubbing your turkey will make you super nervous but it is the absolute best fried turkey marinade I have ever tasted!! We have used it  3 years in a row and everyone raves about it. We also inject our turkeys with a creole butter and it comes out so tasty!

I came from a family that always roasted the Thanksgiving turkey in the oven.  I think this recipe put an end to that!  It does come out looking burnt, however, it is so delicious, even the skin. It was the most tender, juicy turkey we've ever had on the table. I received nothing but praise about it.

Tried it this year for Thanksgiving! A total hit! Not spicy at all! Had a lot of rub left over since I only had a 10 lb turkey. Will try this rub on chicken! Can't wait to do it again!!!!

I have used this marinade for both Thanksgiving and Christmas for a few years now.  It goes great with all the side dishes you normally have for the holidays, something injected turkeys don't always do.  The skin is the best part.  I always let people know ahead of time that the bird will come out dark brown and black due to the marinade.  Once they try a taste they are going back for more.  Leftovers don't last long either.

This is the best tasting turkey I have ever eaten.  I do not like spicy food and thought this turkey would be to spicy for me but after cooking and eating it I found it was perfect.  The turkey was easy to prepare and was good on the first try.  I have a Big Easy turkey fryer that I cook it in which does not require grease.  You can not go wrong with this turkey.  I just prepared it again using turkey parts vs the entire turkey and it was still good.  I am not sure why all reviews did not give this one five stars

Best Turkey hands down.  Had an 18 lb turkey for 7 people and had only enough left over for 1 meal.  It did come out looking burnt and a few people were worried but then everyone wanted a 2nd helping.  2014, Made it again this year and It was all gone before I could get some.

AWESOME Flavor but I will say I was a little scared of the ingredients because most of my family doesn't like heat. I did use 1/4 cup of cayenne pepper instead of 1/2 but there was no spice when it was done. I will do the recipe as pictured next year and I'm thinking about adding a stick of butter to the mix to see how that goes. This was my 7th yr frying a turkey for Thanksgiving and I usually had bought the butter creole marinade at Wal-Mart but they didn't have it in my area this year and they won't have to worry about me buying it anymore. My whole family raved over this turkey. And I was really surprised how the marinade tasted throughout the whole turkey not just the skin. EXCELLENT RECIPE, don't be afraid...

So we just fried out 14.65 lb turkey on Thanksgiving and OMG was it delicious! Thanks to other reviews that warned us of the black burned look to the bird we did not panic when we removed it from the fryer. However to be honest we were still very nervous. Prior the the guests getting there we cut a small piece of the turkey and let me just say it was hard to stop eating it before family arrived! lol 

Anyway we mixed the spices as directed the night prior to frying. We covered the turkey, under some areas of the skin, and inside the cavity. We removed it from the frig to fry at 2:30pm the next afternoon and fried it for 45 minutes at around 325/350 degrees.

When family arrived everyone thought it was burnt and it was no good! haha For the 1st time the honey baked ham was not touched at all and there was a line for the turkey! Amazing!! People kept talking about it all night and we are expected to fry another for Christmas! This is truly going to be a traditional recipe for us from this point on! Highly recommend it! Enjoy!

The flavor was AMAZING.  I took cues from other reviewers and injected mine with riesling wine and strained Italian dressing.   Other reviewers also stated that it would be blackened and look burned, and that is exactly how mine looked as well.  A guest took one look at it and started making comments about how dry it was going to be and how I still have "a lot to learn" (this is my first year being responsible for the important dishes).  Well, he was eating his words while he was eating his turkey because the flavor and moisture levels were all perfect.  I was very skeptical because of the ingredients but decided to trust the reviews.  I'm so glad that I did!  Will definitely do again.  Only took off a star because of the ugly blackened color it cooks out as.

By far the most amazing turkey I have EVER had.  My nerves were jumbled trying this recipe for my first ever Thanksgiving dinner but with so many rave reviews I figured I couldn't go wrong.  The only bad part about this recipe is that I am now assigned with "Turkey Duty" from here on out.

I feel horrible that I didn't rate this last year when I tried it.  DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE DARK/BLACK COLOR, IT IS NOT BURNED - IT IS DELICIOUS.  I made 2 turkeys last year, just in case this one was too spicy…..NOPE. Everyone chose this one over the more traditional turkey. It was absolutely delicious. If you have a fryer, then this should be your 'go to' recipe every year. I promise you, it is unlike any other turkey your friends or family have had, and it will be there favorite.

It is a year later and my family still talks about the black fried turkey from 2012.  They made me promise I will never make another type of turkey again.

This turkey marinade is amazing! I was skeptical that it would be too spicy, but it isn't spicy at all. My 2 year old loved it! When the turkey came out of the frier it looked burn beyond belief, but as soon as you cut it open it was moist and juicy!

Made this for Thanksgiving this year! Everyone raved about it. I wasn't sure if I should remove the excess rub from the outside of the turkey before deepfrying. I didn't and felt it was too overpowering. However, everyone else thought it was great. I think next time, I will wipe off most of the rub from the outside only. The meat was very tasty. I am a bad person and love the skin. But I couldn't eat it this year. But I would definitely make this again!

Today was the second time my brother and I fried a turkey, the first time we used this marinade.  Even after reading all of the reviews we were still nervous that the turkey was burned to the point of it being inedible.  Boy were we wrong!!!   The turkey is out of this world!!!  Christmas turkey look out!!!!!!!

This will be the third Thanksgiving we use this recipe.  We rub the turkey the night before. The turkey is gobbled up in minutes.  Everyone loves the flavor and the juiciness.
