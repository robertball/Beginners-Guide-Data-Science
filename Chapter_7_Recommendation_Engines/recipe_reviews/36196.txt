This was the first time I made this.  I read through the reviews and took advantage of everyones experience. I took a little from each person.  I put the tomatillos and jalapenos in a pot with a little water (approx 1 cup) and steam/boiled them till they were soft.  I also lightly floured the pork before searing in the skillet.  After the pork was seared, I put the meat in a large crock pot.  I put the stemed tomatillos, fresh cilantro leaves and stemed jalapenos in the blender for 1-2 min. I poured the mixture over the meat in the crock pot.  I took the other peppers (yellow and poblano) and roasted them on the gas grill until they were blistered all over.  I placed them in a plastic bag to cool..then under water peeled the skin off of each.  I placed the yellow and pablano peppers in the blender and mixed for 1-2 min, then added this to the crock pot over the meat.  I cooked the onions w/spices as instructed, and once the onions were soft I added 1/2 cup chicken broth to help deglaze the skillet then added this into the crock pot.  I cut the recipe in half (service for 10), but the one IMPORTANT thing was that I added all the ingredients into the crock pot and then added the chicken stock LAST so I could control the thickness of the sauce.  I ended up using approx 3 1/2 cups of chicken broth because the tomatillos and blended chilis made up the rest of the sauce.  It was FANTASTIC....the BEST Verde ever!

The closest chile verde recipe I have found outside a restaurant.  It was watery and a little sharp so I added one teaspoon of sugar to cut the tartness.  Much better - but that's a personal preference.  Would definitely make again!

I loved this recipe.  I am mexican and usually do my own chile verde but wanted to see how others differ.  I seared the pork then removed to sear the onions/garlic/cumin powder.  meanwhile, boiled the tomatillos/jalepenos till tender. then put in blender on hi for bout' 2-3minutes. pour mixture into onion/garlic/cumin and bring to a slight boil then return the seared pork.  Absolutely delicious. DONT FORGET to add small amts of salt and black pepper to all three steps! ENJOY!

This was a new experience for me! I have never even tasted Chile Verde before, let alone make it myself. I don't know what's "authentic" and what's not or how it's supposed to look or taste. After a little research and after reading  some of the reviews, I gave this a shot. First, I roasted the tomatillos, jalapenos and poblanos at 400* for 12 minutes, then pureed them in the food processor.  I dredged the meat in flour, browned it, added the chopped onion, yellow bell peppers and garlic. Deglazed the pan with 1/4 of the amount of chicken broth called for (given so many reviews indicating there was far too much broth in the recipe). I put everything in the slow cooker along with the cumin, and Mexican oregano, salt, pepper and chopped, fresh cilantro to taste.  My plan was to serve this in tortillas with sliced avocado and queso fresco, but this was still just too liquidy for that. Alternatively, the thought of eating what was essentially a stew of pork and tomatillos with a bowl and spoon didn't appeal to me either. So, authentic or not, I added a can of cannellini beans (white kidney beans) for the recipe scaled down to 4 servings and 1-1/4# of meat.  Now I had something!  The beans definitely gave it substance, interest and texture, and appealed to my ingrained "there's got to be beans if it's chili" way of thinking! This was tasty enough, but maybe just too different for me.

I was begging for it when I made this--this is a family treasure at the in-laws and this is not the way they make it. First time I served it to them, I got cool looks and lukewarm comments. I heard later that the left overs where gone by morning and no one would admit to eating all of it. Next time I was Told to bring The Other Verde (as this is now known as) and everyone is quite exultant to see this come through the door (inlaw G'ma took me aside and said "not bad for an Anglo"), so a Big Thank You, Clara!!

Delicious recipe for Chile Verde. The tomatillos do a great job of thicking it up towards the end. I used 6 cups instead of 8 cups of chicken broth -- which was more than enough. I also added some cut-up potato pieces (cubes) towards the end to make the stew a bit more hearty.

This recipe would be good if it had the correct amount of broth, it's suppose to be 4 1/2 cups not 4 1/2 quarts. This is suppose to be thick like a stew or gravy instead it's like soup.

This was excellent.  As previous reviewers mentioned, the chicken stock called for was way too much.  I'll use about half next time.  I also cooked it in the crock pot and the meat was extremely tender.

I've made many batches of chile verde over the last twenty years, each time trying slightly different ingredients (especially the varieties of chiles) and techniques. This version is very similar to how I make it these days, with a couple of important differences. First of all, the amount of broth in this recipe is way too much! The batch I just made today had three pounds of pork shoulder and only 4 cups of chicken broth- not the 9 cups that Clare uses. I used three fresh poblanos and three anaheim chiles and about 1-1/2 pound of tomatillos. I roast them under the broiler, put in a large glass bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let them steam for at least a half hour (roasted chiles and tomatillos add great depth to the sauce). When it's time to peel and seed the chile's, DO NOT rinse them under water as you are doing this! I see this technique used in recipes all the time and it's a big mistake, as rinsing the chiles in water washes much of the roasted chile taste down the drain! Instead, take a paper towel and rub off the skin and wipe off the seeds from the inside of the chiles. I also chop the tomatillos into quarters and bake in a shallow greased baking pan at 400 degrees, stirring occasionally until they're nice and soft and begin to caramelize. I have found that a dutch oven works best for this dish.

I tried this one with only minor modifications. I didnt have quite enough poblanos so substituted other fresh chiles.  I also cut the servings down by half.  One other thing I did was to dredge 1/2 the meat in flour before browning.  This helped the gravy to thicken and avoided the wateriness mentioned by other reviewers.  Next time I will dredge all the meat.  I also added more hot peppers to kick up the spice.  It was super tasty served over brown rice with cheese.  I'll deinitely make this one again.

I combined this and another recipe and the result was SO mind blowingly delicious. It was perfect from the first bite to the last. I did a much smaller recipe (2-4 people) Here is what went down: 1lb tomatillos, 2 jalapenos and 1 poblano, 2/3 tsp salt, 2 pinches sugar. Broil on low the husked tomatillos and de-stemmed and de-seeded (if desired) peppers on a cookie sheet on the top rack of your oven for 10 min, flip and 10 min more. Then blend them (careful, hot!) and add the salt and sugar. Set this aside. Now brown your meat. Then cook 1 med diced onion and 1 diced bell pepper until limp, add 3 cloves minced garlic and cook 2 more minutes. Then throw in 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp cumin, 1 crushed bay leaf, some fresh pepper and salt (pinch each) and 2 tsp *crushed* coriander seeds. Add in 1.5 cups chicken stock, half of a cilantro bunch, snipped up and your tomatillo blend. Simmer 2-3 hours. Or in a hurry, 1.5 hours with some chicken, for example. I served this with a rice/black bean mix (salted, coconut oil, and melted mexican cheese blend on top). WOW!

My husband loves chile verde. We have a
local restaurant that serves his favorite of
all chile verdes. He went absolutely wild
over this recipe. I will be making it many more
times in the future. I do recommend to cut 
down on the chicken broth by at least half.
I added more pickled jalapenos at the end
as we love the heat . This is just too good
to miss.

This was delicious!  The flavor was just right and it was mild enough for my kids to eat.  I give only 4 stars because the recipe calls for far too much broth.  It took much longer for me to make this because I needed to cook it down on high heat, otherwise it would have been soup.  I will definitely make this again but with only half the broth called for.

Really different and delicious!  My husband claimed he didn't like stewed pork, but he kept digging in...The broth makes it rich.  I halved the recipe, pureed the peppers and extra garlic together with the tomatillos, and added cubes of raw potato to the last simmer period because I remember being served the dish that way.  I also saved some chopped cilantro and green onions to sprinkle on raw as a garnish.  Great with plain rice or pinto beans.

This was a great recipe.  I halved it and cooked it on low in the crockpot for 5 hours (After cooking the meat in a pot).  It fit perfectly in my large one.  Yummy!

Delicious.  I started out trying to duplicate the "smothered" sauce from our favorite smothered burrito place.  This isn't it, but it is delicious!  (I think more green chile and less tomatillo would do it.)  A perfect New Mexicoan chile verde.  (Oh how I miss the food in Albuquerque.)  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  My market only had 3 poblanos and I couldn't get my mind around bell peppers, so I ended up using the 3 poblanos plus about 12 Anaheims.  I also used 6 jalapenos, since they were really small.  The main difference, though, was that I roasted everything first.  I roasted the chiles so I could peel them.  (I hate the plastic-y bits of peel that you find in your food after you cook raw peppers and the flavor is SO much better.)  Then I cut the tomatillos in half, put them cut side down on a cookie sheet and baked them until they kind of exploded and collapsed.  They're a richer and deeper flavor if you roast them first.  Also, the cilantro I bought was kind of gross, so I ended up using only about a third of the bunch.  Cubing up the pork shoulder was a huge pain, so I think I'll use a leaner cut in the future - maybe some thin-cut chops?  Easier to cube and way less fat.  I left the whole thing simmering while we went to a party and I think I'll always cook it a long time in the future, so the leaner cut shouldn't end up tough.

Disappointing. But I should have realized that most of the people who gave it 3+ stars made MAJOR revisions to the recipe. As written, it is way to watery. Gives new meaning to "soup".  As a result, I had to add flour to thicken it, and this just dilutes the taste. The result is very bland, and like I said, disappointing. Rather than making a ton of revisions to make this better, I'd look for another recipe. Won't make it again.

I roasted the peppers and tomatillos for about 12-15 minutes at 400 degrees to soften them up.   To "chop" the peppers and jalapenos I threw them in the food processor, but made sure they didn't get blended.  I coated the pork in flour before browning it so the sauce would be a bit thicker in the end.   I threw it all in a crockpot and let it cook on low overnight.  I ended up using maybe 2-3 cups of chicken broth - just enough to give it a little sauce.  It filled up my huge crockpot almost to the top!  I think the amount of chicken broth this recipe calls for would be way too much.  I left out the cilantro, but definitely regretted it.  It was good - just not as flavorful as it could be.  Make sure you use a fatty cut of pork as it is better that way.  And next time I am not going to seed the jalapenos.  It hardly had any heat to it for my taste.  Overall a tasty chile verde recipe!

This recipe could have been so good.  I tasted the puree with everything in it minus the chicken broth and it was delicious.  There was so much chicken broth that the flavor was lost completely.  So, I made it again and halved the recipe.  I used only 3/4 of a cup of chicken broth.  I also upped the tomatillos to 3 1/2 pounds and added only 2 pounds of chicken just because we prefer it to pork.  I shredded the chicken with a fork an hour before turning off the crock pot.  With 3 pounds of chicken, it was more like shredded chicken with tomatillo in it but with only 2 pounds, it was like a real chille. I also found the initial trial of the recipe to be watery.  The trick is to boil the tomatillos whole before pureeing them.  What a HUGE difference that made in the thickness.  With those changes, it came out so well.  My rating is based on the recipe with these changes made to it.

This recipe has a good flavor but no heat or taste of roasted peppers, no kick. I have made Chili Verde for years, and I wanted to try this easier version since mine takes 24 hours before the full flavor takes it's form. For those of you who like the roasted chili flavor, I suggest you at least put them in the oven and roast, let the skin bubble and take out of the oven rest for 5 minutes. Peel the skin off. If not all of the skin comes off it may be under-cooked. Make sure not to over roast though. If you like heat add as much heat as you like. This version is very mild, even with the peppers. Happy eating

This is excellent chile verde.  I agree that you can probably cut down a bit on the chicken broth and add a bit more water.  It's plenty salty.  The addition of potatoes is a great idea.  Grab some warm tortillas and it's a real winner!

I had a picnic roast and cooked it in the slow cooker. I do think it was a little runny and next time I will add the broth last. I only added about 3 cups, but I had fresh tomatillos from the garden which were  very juicy this year.

This is the best chile verde I have ever had. It is perfect with sour cream and a tortilla!! Next time, less broth/water... maybe 1/2 of what it calls for. I wasn't real exact with the recipe, just sauted what it called for and just added as stuff was ready. So delicious!! Hubby said this was better than ANY restaurant!

I have made this twice now. DH loves this dish. I don't measure most of the stuff. Added fewer poblanos and more jalapeno just what ever I had in the refer. One time I made it in the crock pot second time on the stove top. Served over rice or mashed spuds. Topped with cilantro and a squeeze of lime. I am a hero now!  Edit: I also added a large can of green chiles. Can't wait to try the version from the last two posters.

I'm rating this 4 stars b/c you do not need the broth!  I used NO broth at all.  I broiled the peppers, onions, and tomatillos until browned and blended them in the blender with the cilantro, cumin, garlic and salt.  Then I poured it over a pork loin and let it cook on low in the crockpot for 9 hours.  When it was done, it was still very watery so I thickened it.  The flavor was excellent and the pork was falling apart.  I shredded it and used it to stuff tamales.  Unless you want it soupy, there's no need for broth since there's plenty of liquid with the vegetables.

This is a good repipe, but is not spicy enough for my family  and needs adjustments. With these adjusments it was GREAT!
I doubled the garlic, doubled the jalapenos, added an equal number of serranos, added 2 yellow chiles. I did not seed the chiles - this is where the flavor is. The other change was to use only enough chicken broth to cover the meat while simmering (about 1/3 of the called out amount). I used Morton salt lite and Trader Joe's Low sodium chicken broth the keep the sodium content under control. Prepared like this, it was a winner.

Yuuuuum!  This recipe was really delicious.  I used extra jalapenos to make it spicy and pureed them along with the tomatillo and cilantro (and a clove of garlic).  I also took out half of the broth before adding the tomatillo puree, for a thicker consistency.  Thank you for this recipe. It's a keeper.

Very tasty and worh the effort ! After reading others reviews I also steamed the tomatillo's and jalapeno's together until soft before blending in my food processor.I also grilled the Poblano and Bells on my gas grill and let steep in a large bowl covered tightly with plastic wrap to soften peppers enough to make peeling and blending a snap.I lightly floured the pork and in batches browned it to a nice golden brown.Unlike most reviewers I did not cook in a crock pot ...instead I used my 9qt dutch oven.The authentic way ?! Cast Iron cooking always produces better flavor/results in my opinion ! Most importantly I only used 1 QUART of low sodium broth !!!! More than enough. This Chile Verde was a hit with the wife so that says alot :) I let this simmer on low(low as my gas flame could go without blowing out) for 6 hours stirring every 30 minutes ....like I said before ..worth the effort !

This was good. I did find it a bit thin so I created a roux with the liquid and some four and it thickened up nicely. I was expecting this to be spicy, but it wasn't at all. Next time I will probably add more jalapenos.

This is exactly the restaurant style/flavor Chile Verde that I love!  So. Good.  Be aware the 4-1/2 quarts chicken broth I believe should read 4-1/2 CUPS!  I followed "Motherof4bigeaters" (April 8) and "Debra's" review (July 6) and it turned out perfect.  Remember to add salt and pepper to each step as per Motherof4bigeaters suggestion.  I can't believe I finally found the ultimate Chile Verde recipe!  I am a beginner cook and this turned out great for me.  Thank You!

I like the flavors of this chile verde. The consistency of the chile is to watery, I would like for the sauce to be a bit thicker.

I am sure this is not the recipe's fault, but there was something way off for me. My husband and I decided it was actually the flavor of the tomitillos. However, I would be willing to try the recipe with red tomatoes.

This recipe is awesome.  I ate a small bowl before it was finished, but for my own personal taste, I added the juice of 1/2 a lime and a can of drained black beans towards the end of cooking.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was the best homemade chile verde I have had.  I cut down the recipe to feed 4.  The changes I made were: instead of tomatillos, I used a 7 oz. can of Herdez Salsa Verde; I browned the meat with a Tbsp. of Essence (Emeril's); I did not seed the jalapeno; and, finally, I added a 1/2 cup or more of cooked white rice.  It was yummy!

Just sooo delicious! Although it is dinner for tonight, I made it yesterday and had to taste it. I loved it! I did make quite a few changes like down sizing the recipe big time. I used this recipe as my main base and took some other hints from another recipe that I had found. After searching like a mad woman, I finally found tomatillos..fresh. I used 8 of them, husks removed,washed, and cut in half. I roasted these on a foil lined cookie sheet with 5 cloves of garlic and 2 poblano peppers until everything was soft. I put all of this into my food processor and blended with fresh cilantro, and jalepeno peppers. This was the most fresh smelling salsa verde ever. I used 4 huge bone in pork chops, took the meat off the bones and cut into chunks, sauteed with a little flour,salt, and pepper until browned. I also sauteed 1 yellow pepper diced and 1 vidalia onion in evoo. I added all of this into my crockpot with 1c.fat free/low sodium chix broth and let it go. The smell was insane as was the taste. I will be serving this tonight with warm torillas. Thanks!

Geat soup! We're all vegetarians, so we made some seitan (wheat gluten+veggie stock, pre-boiled for an hour) and put it in instead of the pork. It was the perfect consistency.

So good! I had a ton of tomatillos and didn't know what to do with them. This was the perfect solution. There was a lot more broth then I expected so I strained it off and used the left over broth to make a soup. It worked out fine.

Authentic and distinctive, with one major modification, this Chile Verde recipe is a winner!  Only about half of the chicken broth called for in the recipe is needed to make the Chile Verde a perfect consistency.  I followed the lead of naples34102 and roasted the tomatillos, jalapenos, and poblano peppers to intensify the flavors.  It was delicious served over brown rice topped with shredded Mexican cheese and sour cream; leftovers were equally as good served in whole wheat tortillas with avocado, cheese, and thinly shredded cabbage (I like the crunch and added nutrition of cabbage but shredded lettuce would have been good, too).  Four stars because ingredient amounts were off by quite a bit, but five stars for flavor!

This is better than any chile verde I've had in a restaurant.  Absolutely delicious.  I steamed the tomatillos for a couple of minutes and let cool before blending.  I also added the seeds from one of the jalapenos as otherwise, it is a bit bland.  I roasted the chiles, peeled, then blended half of them with the tomatillos and chopped the other half.  This recipe make A LOT but the leftovers freeze well.

I cut this recipe in half (made 10 servings) and made Chili Verde for the first time. For my first attempt it turned out great. I followed the recipe pretty closely. I did however add double the cilantro and garlic. Next time though I will make a couple changes. 1. I will add more pork 2. simmer the pork longer. 3. cut the pork into smaller pieces than the approx. 1 inch cubes I did last time. Enjoy

This was very good. I made a half-recipe, and used another reviewers suggestion to roast the chilies and tomatillos before pureeing them. I cooked it "slow and low" in a regular kettle until the meat was soooooo tender. This also helped to reduce the "soupiness" so the stew was nice and thick Will definitely make again.

This recipe is amazing, and cannot be beat.  It is the real deal.  I also boiled tomatillos with the jalepeno as others mentioned, before throwing into the food processor, and served this over rice.  Amazing flavor!

I grilled a 4-lb pork roast & was looking for something to do with the leftovers, when I saw this.  I roasted the bell & all of the other peppers & the tomatillos & pureed them with the cilantro before adding to the pot.  I also added roasted tomatoes.  It got rave reviews in my house!

Great recipe.  I wanted to make a vegetarian version so I skipped on the pork, added potatoes, white kidney beans and black beans and omitted the stock, then served it with grated cheese and sour cream.  It was very tasty, but even better using the leftovers as a nacho topping!

**********10 STARS!!**********  This is a perfect recipe!  I've made it 5-6 times now and never change a thing ingredient-wise!  I do simmer it for about 6 hours though, so lots of the liquid reduces.  We eat it with corn or flour tortillas!  This is WONDERFUL!  Thanks!!

This recipe turned out great!  It was only after I made it and revisted this site I realized I could "customize" the size to feed less.  Needless to say, it fed us four generously, plus there is a batch for my neighbor, PLUS I have two freezer containers full of sauce for making enchiladas suiza.  I browned the pork; then the onions and garlic; then added 3 cans of broth (could have cut back due to the juice in the tomatillos); added the yellow bell peppers; half (4) of the poblanos; the rest, cilantro, 4 poblanos, jalapenos, and 3 pounds of tomatillos, were pureed in the food processor and I added that - let the pot sit on the stove on simmer (after bringing to a boil) for about 3 or 4 hours (I forget).  The pork was SO tender!  You can't go wrong with this recipe!

Excellent! I scaled for 6 so as I rounded proportions it probably came out different, used 4 cloves of garlic and 3 cups broth, still a little too soupy, thickening w/corn meal would work. Rice helped absorb juice. Needed more heat, but easier to add at table than overdo for other's taste.
Rich pepper flavor!

This recipie was delicious. You would want to reduce the amount of chicken broth though it is very soupy with the amount the recipie calls for.

Very flavorful dish that needs less than two hours cooking time.  As a novice cook, I made this for my anniversary and it really was a special meal, and different.

I quartered the broth as many mentioned in their reviews. I will say that perhaps chile verde doesn't have the same meaning to everyone and surely some prefer it as written. I wanted it to make burritos/tacos so thicker was good. The sauce had really good flavor and the pork took about 2 hours to be fork tender. I did turn down the heat after searing the pork to saute the vegetables and then simmered on low for the rest of the cook time. The recipe didn't indicate to ever turn it down from high heat. The flavor was milder than I expected so I wouldn't be afraid to use the full amount of peppers. Definitely a keeper, but the instructions are a little unclear. I thought about pureeing the peppers with the tomatillos but am glad I didn't. I think it would have removed some of the layering of the flavors. We used this in tacos and breakfast burritos and also as a main with colorado mexican rice. Good all ways. Flavor was a five as I made it but wouldn't have worked for us as written.

I have made this recipe a few times and it is tasty. It is WAY better when you roast the veggies in the oven first... cut veggies in half, put on cookie sheet, brush with olive oil and broil until just starting to char. I have also found it to be a little on the runny side, so I use a little less broth, simmer it longer, or add a little cornstarch or flour to thicken it up.

I substituted the pork with one whole chicken ( I used cut up bone-in). I fried the onions in oil till they softened and added the chopped garlic. I then added chicken and all spices and stir fried. I grilled all the peppers, removed their skin and blended along with the tomatillos. I added this mixture to the chicken. Lastly I threw in a can of black beans and cooked on low heat.

This was AWESOME!! I have a lot of people to please when it comes to dinner and so finding a recipe that is a crowd pleaser isn't always easy. This one was the best. One of the people that partook in this was my father-in-law who said it was the best he's ever had! One change I made was I added roasted anaheim peppers. So yummy!!!

Used all ingredients as listed with the exception of using chicken broth instead of vegetable, & only needed about three 14.5 oz. cans, even though I had this simmering & thickening for 3 hours 3 cans was plenty. I also roasted the chiles & par-boiled the tomatillos as suggested by others. This was very good but still not quite the way I like it, though everyone seemed to enjoy. Next time I'll blend the chiles (maybe the cilantro too) with the tomatillos, add bit more garlic & cumin (& perhaps a little chile powder?) & a pinch of sugar to cut the tang of the tomatillos...sounding better already!

This is a great recipe! I  do use beef instead of pork but that is just a personal preference. I leave this simmering for a few hours to get the flavors really going.

Did not follow the recipe, but turned out well. I did not have a lot of things on hand, but I used Verde sauce instead of fresh tomatillos and chicken thighs vs. pork. Still tastes quite yummy

The flavor was perfect.  Next time I would  not add quite as much chicken broth as it was way to much.  Chile Verde should be thick.  I also floured the meat before I seared it.  It was very good.

This was VERY good.  Not difficult.  I roasted the peppers too long, so they were more blackened (and I didn't peel them) but it was easy to puree them in the FP.  BTW, Poblano peppers were called Pasilla peppers in my Winco.

Wow!  My husband and I both loved this at first bite.  I tried to follow the recipe exactly (I forgot to add the cilantro, but will do it with the leftovers) except for cutting the broth in half, using a green bell pepper, and scaling the recipe down to 4 servings.  The tomatillos thickened the stew up beautifully.  I had previously tried Bianca's Green Chile Pork from this site, in an effort to replace a recipe I'd gotten from Sunset Magazine many years ago, but this recipe will replace it in my recipe book.  It amazes me how a few simple ingredients can combine to such a perfect flavor.  This is exactly the recipe I was looking for and it will become a regular in our meal line-up.  Thanks, Clare, for a great recipe.

I had never tried chili verde before. It doesn't taste as much like a traditional chili con carne as I thought it would, but once I got used to the taste of the tomatillos I really liked it. I cut the recipe in half and cut up some pork chops for the "stew meat". It tastes even better the next day.

I was expecting great things from this recipes given all the reviews.  I was disappointed.  While the pork was tender and yummy, the verde sauce was lacking in flavor and heat.  I may try the recipe again, only next time I will leave some of the seeds from the jalapenos in it and maybe use a different green pepper all together.  One with some heat to it.  I am so glad that I didn't use the amount of chicken broth the recipe calls for.  It would have been so runny if I had.  I think I only used about a cup.

It was good, I read some of the reviews and cut the broth down by half and it was still too watery!  I added some cornstartch to thicken it up, and that helped.  I made it for Christmas and everyone said it was so good, I think that's because they never tasted my mother in laws, I'm just going to have to break down and ask her for her recipe!

Man this stuff was EXCELLENT!!!!  It's honestly on the verge of being the best I've had so far!!  The left overs are even better!!!  The only recommendation I have is use Debra's review.  Follow what she did and you can't go wrong.  She review it on July 6th.  Trust me, her suggestions are perfect!!!

I have always been a Verde fan, and this recipe did not disappoint. Followed recipe with the exception of using some mexican all purpose seasoning. Excellent served with warm flour tortillas and jack cheese.

Very good recipe.  I made it great the first time and had never bought a tomatillo before in my life.  My wife is mexican and even she liked it a lot.  I used a lot less chicken stock (1 quart) and a little less meat, but all the chiles.                  

Okay.  I've made this a bunch of times now and I don't measure anything when I make it anymore.  I like anaheim and jalapeno chiles.  I made this for fun at a rib cook off and had an international chili judge tell me that this is the real deal!  One tip.  You have to fire roast your chiles and your tomatillos.  Adds great flavor.  My family loves this recipe and I've gotten to where I feel like I really know what I'm doing.  Thanks allrecipes.com.  This is the best dish I make now.

I add 12 oz of beer instead of the chicken stock.  This gives the fermented taste this recipe calls for.  The alcohol cooks off.  Serve with warm tortillas, sour cream, guaz, cheese, pico de gallo.  A great finger food.

This recipe was good, but it needed attention. The recipe needed about a third of the Cilantro called for and I really like Cilantro. As another reviewer mentioned, I used way less chicken broth
(just enough to cover the pork).Also, I would suggest not pureeing the cilantro with the tomatillos and just give them a good chop.I pureed them as the recipe say to and the result was less than pleasing

I am sorry but way too soupy and not enough pizzaz. I have another recipe for verde in the crockpot and it has so much more flavor. Not sure why it asked for so much broth???

Very very good! I did as suggested and reduced the broth in half and cooked for 4 hours in my slow-cooker. This recipe has been added to my monthly rotation as my children enjoyed it just as much as the adults.

OMG.  We loved this.  We over-ate because it was so delicious. I modified the recipe a lot ONLY due to personal  preference.  First, we changed to 10 servings since there are only two of us.  Then, we added more jalapenos (6 total), more cumin, and a lot more cilantro. In addition, I ONLY used 4 cups of chicken broth when the recipe called for 9 cups (it calls for 9 cups if you 1/2 the recipe).  FANTASTIC.  Absolutely 100% one of our favorites.  10*'s if I could give it.

I agree with other reviewers.  There's too much broth in the recipe as written.  With modifications, however, this is a definite make-again.  I could only fit about 9 cups of broth in my pot, and I wish I'd only used 6 for four pounds of meat.  The only other thing I changed was the amount of tomatillos -- I couldn't find 3lb of decent ones.  This recipe works with chicken, and though it isn't the traditional Chile Verde that way, it's pretty tasty.  I can also envision making a slightly less rustic sauce by removing the meat as directed, cooking the peppers and tomatillos into the onions, garlic and seasonings, blending with an immersion blender, and THEN adding the meat back, adding broth and simmering awhile.  At any rate, we liked this a lot, and will use our modified version of it over and over.  Thanks, Clare!

This is really good and very similar to what my husband and I had in Mazatlan. I added some pre-cooked cubed potatoes which gives it a nice creamy texture. Warm tortillas and a cold cerveza....yum!

I browned the meat, blended the tomatillos and cilantro, chopped and added the remaining ingredients to the crockpot and cooked overnight.  It was too watery so I removed the meat and blended the mixture for a minute.  Returned the meat to the stove and added half the mixture with flour to thicken.  Put remaining mixture in freezer for future use.  Served with tortillas, Mexican rice and beans.   Yum!!!

Great recipe but way too soupy.  Wish I had read reviews before making, that way I wouldn't have had to spend lots of time draining the excess liquid.

Very good. I made this recipe for 10 people. I only added 4 cups of broth and I added the juice from one lime. I did let this recipe simmer for about 3 hours so the pork was very tender. I only added about 1/4 of the cilantro as we are not big on cilantro.

Very,very good. After simmering all the peppers together with the chicken stock, pork, ect. I removed and pureed the majority of the peppers along with the (canned) tomatillos and cilantro. This puree along with a dash of cayenne pepper added to the pot made a thick satisfying dinner when served over rice with sour cream and a twist of lime. Better than what we are served at our local Mexican food eatery.Thank you Clare.

Even half the liquid is a lot, but when I eat this at restaurants, there is always way more soup than meat (unlike American chili recipes.) Do add some cubed potatoes. It adds bulk and thickens the liquid. I ended up thickening it a little more with 1/2 cup flour (thin with chicken broth before adding). We loved it so much! Served it over rice. Made some Navajo fry bread as a perfect accompaniment. Oh, if you don't have three pounds of tomatillos, you can use some canned green chile enchilada sauce. But then cut back on the liquid. It is mostly tomatillos and water with some chiles. It tastes just like the chile verde we love at a local restaurant! My husband is thrilled! It does make a lot, but we packed some up and shared with friends.

I really liked this recipe.  I made some modifications (I divided the recipe by 1/4 because it was for a small group).  I have made it with pork and with chicken breast cutlets, both to great results.  The main change I have done (because of my personal taste) was to increase the amount of garlic, season the meat in advance, and to puree all the peppers, tomatillos and cilantro together.

I cooked this 6 or so hours on high in the crock pot...added everything at once once after browning the meat, I cooked the onions and added the broth to get the browned bits from the pan then put in crock pot...I made some changes....I wanted 1/2 recipe....used 3 cans chicken broth and halved everything else....had to add a total of 5 pounds of pork as it was still rather soupy and I wanted something for burritos...
This recipe turned out awesome...what a wonderful dish...and great for us midwesterners who are starved for authentic Mexican food!!  Yum!!!

The recipe was slightly bland.  I added the juice of a whole lime and less chicken stock, which made the flavor have more of a tangy flavor.

this is a great recipe.  however I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars due to the directions state to just dice of the peppers and put them in to cook.  there is no way for the peppers to cook down enough in the time this cooks for them to be appealing.  I ended up roasting them with the tomatillos and still had to fish them out after they were diced and put in to cook because they still just weren't cooking down.  I fished them out and blended the majority and put them back in.  from now on I will roast all of the veggies. blend the tomatillo and garlic and then all the other peppers and add them.  It has a really great flavor. Oh and the amount of broth in the recipe is way too much.  I would start out with 1/4 - 1/2 of that then add more if you want to.

Great recipe. I never have exact amounts of precise ingredients, but even when such a lame cook as me, didn't exactly follow this recipe, it came out fantastic. I absolutely love it. Best green chille I've ever had. 
Thanks for a fantastic recipe.

I made this & followed the directions as is. The end result was similar to green pozole minus the hominy.  It wasn't what I was expecting but it tasted delicious.  I ended up giving in & added hominy. Way too much broth for stew. I also roasted the peppers, then removed the skin before blending.  I making it again but I plan on using only 2 cups of broth.

So good.  Boiling the tomatillo and chiles is a great idea.  Was so good my 15 year old son who only likes cheeseburgers loves it!  (Dredging the pork in flour is also a plus!)

I made another batch of Chile Verde using this recipe, however I made a few important changes which resulted in an almost perfect dish.  First I precooked all of the chiles and the bell pepper in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes and then chopped and seeded them.  Second I reduced the amount of chicken broth to two fourteen oz cans.  I also added one additional pound to the meat which really added to the overall  flavor.  I also used a cup of shredded potatoes to thicken the sauce.  I simmered the whole batch three hours. The end result was very good but more suited to a bowl than a plate.  If I were to use this recipe to make burritos I would only used one can of broth.

This was unbelievably good - definitely spicy! Made it again and not nearly as spicy, all you have to do is leave out the seeds of the peppers. Next time, I will leave one set of seeds in to give it a bit more. Used about 3 pounds of pork, could use a little less next time. 3 cans of broth and let it cook down for a while so maybe only 2 cans next time. I always roast the peppers and tomatillos, really adds some good flavor.

This is a very good chile verde recipe! We like our food hot so I don't seed the jalapenos. I made use of the roasting the tomatillos tip and it was great! I've tried it in both the crock pot and as the recipe called. Both are good, but the crock pot really brings the flavors together since it cooks so much longer.

Let me preface this by saying I've never had Chili Verde before.  My friend came over with a couple of pounds of Tomatillos and I looked for a recipe to use them :o)  As I said before I don't know what it's supposed to taste like but this was pretty great *sluurrp*!  I cut my pork butt into steaks, rubbed them with liquid smoke, granulated garlic, onion powder, course salt and white pepper.  Then I barbequed them on the grill until medium and cubed them when cooled.  While I was grilling the steaks I also roasted my Poblano and Bell peppers.  After they were all nicely roasted I put them into a bag to sweat.  I then removed the seeds and skin and chopped them.  I also blanched the Tomatillos and Jalapeños for a couple of minutes then (and this is where I made my Verde rookie mistake) I blended them, without seeding the Jalapeños!  Certainly yielded a hotter finished product.  I reserved the blanching water and used it to make my chicken stock (which I only made 12 cups of).  Even with reducing the amount of stock it was still a little runny for me so in the last 10 minutes of cooking I removed 2 cups of liquid from the chili to which I whisked in 2 TBS of flour, then whisked it back into the Chili Verde.  Perfect consistency in my opinion (but then again what do I know :o)  ).  I'm taking some to my Mexican friend, see if he likes it.

This is great. Just a little side note, be careful after cutting up all of the pepper not to touch your face or eyes...they are not really hot enough to burn your mouth, but hot enough to burn your skin.

Awesome Recipe.  I made it with beef instead of pork, reduced for 8 servings and it came out wonderfully.  Only needed 5 cups of broth instead of the 7 the reduced recipe called for.

I've made this recipe several times and as far as I'm concerned it's the best version of chile verde I've ever tried.  In the winter, I've used frozen peppers and canned tomatilloes and the recipe is just as good as when I can use fresh ingredients.  If you're looking for a great tasting, authentic, chile verde recipe, look no further, this is the one!

This is the first time I've tried making Chile Verde with pork.  The meat was tender and delicious but I missed the savory flavor of beef - it was as though "something" was missing.  I intend to go half beef and half pork next time I make this...and yes, I will definitely make this again.  The combination of peppers and chil1es were outstanding.  I also added several freshly roasted, peeled and diced green chilies which turned out very well.

This is my all-time favorite thing to eat in the world.  I do it in the crock pot so I don't have to keep an eye on it as closely.  I just brown the meat, then cook the onions and garlic and put it in the crock pot with only 2 cans of broth.  The recipe calls for way too much.  Then I throw all the peppers in the food processor and throw them in the crock pot along with the spices (I add 1 tbsp chili powder).  After the pork is tender I add the tomatillos and cilantro and give it another couple of hours.  I also add about 1 tsp of garlic salt if it needs it.

This was fantastic!  The flavors were wonderful and the meat was very tender.  I did cook it a little longer on the 2nd simmer just to get all the peppers nice and soft.  Thank you!

I did not like this very well.  I used only half the cilantro called for and it was overwhelming, plus it made the color a weird bright green.  I may make it again, without the cilantro, or just as a garnish.

like others, I change a recipe to suit my taste, so can't really rate "the recipe" as published..  however, with the few changes I made - this was probably the best green chile I've ever cooked (and I've made a lot over the years).  I really didn't like the idea of the yellow bell pepper.. omitted it completely.  I chose to use a little potato as filler, and had a problem finding fresh jalapenos at my market this week, so just used sorranos and poblanos.  I like it hot, so I also added like 1T pepper flakes.  LOVE the idea of processing the tomatillos before cooking, never did it that way before - but will always do it that way now!  :)  excellent ideas in this recipe - thanx for sharing!

This is pretty good. I only bought one poblano pepper, didn't see that I needed two after I changed the recipe to six. 20 was way too large! I had to sub a green pepper. Don't know how much it affected the flavor. As far as seasoning, I felt it was missing something. I ran out of fresh cilantro and used a bit of corriander (since it comes from the same plant-just stronger flavor and a bit tangier), I also added a 1/2 tblspn of lime juice. I think next time I make it I will buy 2 pablanos and see what the difference is. I also added more hot peppers, soranos, and more jalepenos.

I would give this recipe a 5, but because I had to change it because of items I had on hand I won't.  I did not have but 3 pounds of pork meat so I added 3 pounds of  cubed flank beef steak to the pork.  I blistered the Poblano chile peppers and peeled the outer skin.  I also added Hatch long green chili's - about 3 chopped.  I added a can of beer in place of 12 ounces of some of the chicken broth.  I also added cubed potatoes.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  I did cook it slow for at least 10 hours.  It is wonderful.  Thanks Clare for a wonderful recipe.

This is one of my favorite items at a local Mexican restaurant, so I though I'd try to make it. This was waaay better! My husband gave it 5 stars, too.  I cut the servings back to 8 and added a little flour to thicken it up.  This one's  a keeper for sure!

A great recipe, I've made this three times now with consistent results.  Make sure you keep the dish simmering slightly above medium heat the entire time to get the sauce the right consistency and cook off the chicken broth.

This was good.  The pork turned out very tender.  I reduced the amount of liquid and it still turned out a little too saucy, but quite tasty.

This was so delicious.  After reading the reviews I only added half the liquid, and I still thought I had too much.  I also didn't have time to chop all the peppers, so I just blended them all with the hand blender and then put everything in the crockpot on low all day.  The meat was so tender and my kitchen smelled awesome.  Great recipe!

I love this dish! It turns out perfectly every time. I just made this recipe yesterday, vegetarian, for a special diet I am on at the moment. It is still great. I reduced the oil to two tablespoons (there isn't a need for much with out the pork)to saute the onion and garlic and used organic vegtable broth. It would be a good recipe for those divided (veg. and carnies) households-you could cook the pork separately and serve sauce over top.

To make chile verde the authentic way, you  need to first roast the chiles, then skin them and seed them. To do this, put the peppers on a sheet under the broiler and turn them every few minutes until the skin is evenly blistered. Then put them in a plastic bag and tie the top until they cool off. The moisture in the bag helps the skin come off. You can then take them out and rub off the skin. It works best under a running tap. 
Alternatively, if you are lucky enough to live near a mexican grocery you can just buy a big bag of freshly roasted chiles.

Absolutely delicious!  However, I don't think the amount of chicken broth is correct -- way too much liquid.  Next time, I will cut down on the liquid.

Good stuff!  I didn't need such a monstrous amount, so I cut it all in half and it tasted great.  I also wanted the pork to melt on tongue tip, so I let it cook and simmer for three more hours--though some of that was by cause of a speachlessly late boyfriend.  All-in-all this is a good recipe for the first time attempt at this dish, and can be manipulated according to individual tastes.  I look forward to making enchiladas out of the reduction tomorrow.

This is awesome! I have made it several times now and it is always a little different but just as good.  Hopefully you don't make the mistake I did and not look at serving size.  It serves 20!!! Great for a Mexican dinner party.

This is really good.  I scaled the recipe in half, and instead of using the 9 cups of broth called for I used about 6.  I also let it simmer for a very long time, probably 8 hours or so.  The longer it cooked the thicker it got, and the meat just melted in your mouth.  I couldnt get poblano chilis the day I went to the store, and I substituted pasilla chilis.  I made burritos out of it.  I am giving it a 4, because my husband wasnt crazy about it, but he isnt a huge fan of Mexican food.

excellent - agree with everyone else, need to 1/2 the broth but otherwise - yum.  The sauce alone would be good as a stand alone.

Very good.  We enjoyed it for a couple of days.  I did find that the pork took longer to cook than recipe stated. I also used a little leftover chicken.  It is pretty thin too.  I used the rice the next day in the soup instead of pouring over.

This is delicious! Made recipe for 6 servings. Only changes were: roasted the peppers and tomatillos before pureeing, floured all the meat before browning. Then I messed up a little and added the puree with the chicken broth (also only used about 2 cups of broth). I covered the pot and put in a 300° oven for 1 1/2  hours but it came out so delicious. Meat was fall apart tender. Served with some cheese sprinkled over and a dollop of sour cream. Would be good over rice (but we're doing low carb, so that was out for us!) Will definitely make again!

Excellent!  Browned pork loin chunks and removed.  Carmelized onion and then added the chopped peppers and seasonings.  Through meat back in with stock.  Added the pureed tomatillos and cilantro and simmered the whole pot for 1 hr.  No deviation from the ingredients.   Server with avocado, sour cream, and a twist of fresh lime.  We will make regularly.

I've never before had this dish before but decided to try it because it was low carb and i was excited to try a chili that wasn't based on beef.  this was incredible!  i loved the spicy kick and the tenderness of the pork.  it was so delicious that even though i was satisfied after one serving,  i had seconds and ate to the point of discomfort lol the aroma as it was cooking was to die. thank you so much for this wonderful recipe

Love this and it's the first time I made it

As someone else pointed out, 4.5 cups of broth not quarts works great

I could also see this making a great green sauce to pour over enchiladas.  

I couldnt find tomatillos, so I just bought some preblended pouch from meijer and it turned out great, yeah it had some seasoning in it, but not too much

FIRST ~ AMAZING!  I read reviews for this & took them to heart.  I changed up the process but kept the ingredients mostly the same. SECOND~ I did not need 6 lb of meat for my family of 3 so I halved the recipe.  It still made a ton! THIRD~I took the advice & dredged my pork in some seasoned (S&P) flour, browned & proceeded on what it said to do with the onions & seasonings.  FOURTH~ IMPORTANT!  This recipe calls for WAY too much chicken broth.  I think they meant CUPS not quarts.  So I only used 2 cups of broth instead..  Then simmered for only about 10-15 min. FIFTH~ something about raw peppers added to this didn't feel right & others said to roast them. Brilliant! So I put my pablano & yellow peppers under the broiler for about 5 minutes on each side until the skin was blackened. When I removed them from the oven I then put them in a paper bag to rest & cool. I then decided to also roast my tomatillos & jalapeno peppers for approximately 5 minutes total. I didn't let them blacken but let them get a little browned. I then removed the stems (I left the seeds for a spicy verde) from the jalapenos & added them to the blender with the tomatillos & cilantro. Whirled those up & then I skinned, stemmed & seeded the other peppers & added those to the tomatillo mixture. Poured that into the skillet with the meat & since the peppers & tomatillos were no longer raw, I just let it simmer for 15 minutes. Like I said... AMAZING!

The ingredients are great but I chose to blend the sauce together after removing the pork. I then added the pork back and let it reduce for a few hours until the pork fell apart and the sauce was thick like in the restaurant. We enjoyed this recipe sooo much and have added it to the weekly rotation.

Perfection.  I tried a handful of recipes in preparation of our chili cook-off at work and this is exactly what I was going for. The only change I made is I went a little lighter on the cumin because I don't like how it can take over a dish. Oh, and definitely use 4.5 cups and not 4.5 quarts of chicken broth.

I've made this recipe many times and I like it as a guide.  Try adding all the ingredients to a slow cooker and DO NOT use any chicken stock/broth, the tomatillos and peppers provide all the moisture you need; let simmer until meat is tender (~3 hrs).
I also prefer using Anaheim peppers instead of Poblano (10-12 Anaheim and 2 Poblano).
 
The 4 jalapenos is a good measure.
Live well.

I've made this several times. Each time everyone Loves it. I put it together in a crock pot and let cook for a few hours. I seared the pork a little at a time sprinkled in creole seasoning and minced garlic. I also broiled the tomatillos before blending w cilantro.  The onions( I only use one)  and jalapeños I sauteed in a little oil, cumin, pepper and garlic salt before adding. I also simmered the rest of the peppers/Chilis in half a bottle of corona w more cumin, pepper and salt before adding.  Yum yum yum !!!

Even with having taquerias on every corner here, I still cook a lot of Mexican dishes. This recipe is fantastic, I've made it probably a dozen times already. I don't understand why people are dredging the meat in flour, it's completely unnecessary imo. The only issue I have is, I only put enough liquid to cover the meat (it must be a typo because chile verde is not a soup). Thanks for the recipe, my whole family loves it!

This recipe was awesome, making it for the second time this week. Think the author picked the wrong units for the broth, assumed they meant cups not quarts.

It's a little labor intensive with all the chopping and make sure you wear gloves or something.  My fingers burned for 2 days after, but I really didn't mind because it was SO good.  I swapped 1 qt beef broth with chicken to add richness and also used extra green tomatoes I had in the garden.

I'm loving this recipe. I made a few changes. I added two Anaheim peppers and subtracted two other peppers. I used 3 lbs pork and 3lbs chicken breast. I used only 50 ounces of broth. This recipe is great!

I wasn't feeding a large crowd so, lowered the amount of the ingredients. I only used 2lbs of pork browned in bacon fat, 2cups of broth, i made and used the tomatillo salsa recipe from this site and charred two very large Roma tomatoes instead of the can of tomatoes. I charred all the peppers then peeled them.
I sauteed two small diced onions with 8 minced garlic cloves. I pureed everything and threw it in the slow cooker. WoW!!!! Best ever!!!
It still made a lot so, I took half the sauce and froze it for enchiladas next week. The other half, I left all the meat and added 3 (sliced) potatoes and a bag of sweet frozen corn. Thee BEST chile verde stew ever!! It was A LOT of work but the flavor was out of this world!!

I have never made green chile, but this seemed like a good place to start.  I cut the recipe in half. I use green chile as a dip and to smother burritos, so I started with pork for stew and cut it into even smaller pieces.  While I seared the pork, I roasted all the peppers in the oven for about 20 minutes until they were charred and blistered.  I took them out and put them in a plastic zipper bag to steam and then skinned and seeded them.  I used a food processor on all the peppers. I cooked the onion and garlic as directed.  I boiled the tomatillos in about an inch for water for 10 minutes before I pureed them.  I put everything in a crock pot.  Initially the recipe was a bit tart.  I added the 1/2 teaspoon of sugar as recommended in Crystal's review and the tartness disappeared.  I then added 1/2 teaspoon ground coriander and 1/2 teaspoon oregano.  I left out the fresh cilantro as not everyone is as fond of it as I am.  I did not use any chicken broth.  Instead I used one heaping teaspoon of chicken soup base and added it to the crock pot.  This kept the mixture from getting too thin.  I took my first run at green chile to a potluck and everyone was quite impressed.  This recipe is flavorful without being too spicy. I will definitely be making this again!

So good!  I have family from New Mexico,  everytime my uncle would visit he would bring fresh chillies from there and make me a huge pot that I could freeze. Sadly he has passed and I haven't had his chilly  varde in a bout ten years. This is pretty close to his. I'm having a chilly wreath sent to me soon then I'll try again. But this was excellent.  NewMexico chillies bring a little more heat

Fabulous recipe!!!  Roasted the peppers and added flour to pork prior to searing (not entirely sure this was necessary though).  Added about four cups of broth after halving the recipe and added a little sugar. Final product?  Superb!!!!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  Have saved it to my recipe box as I am sure to make it again!!!!!

This was the first time we've tried to prepare this dish at home - and this recipe is AMAZING!  Pork is so tender and full of flavor.  Not too spicy.  Better than most restaurants in our town.  We paired it with homemade flour tortillas and refried beans.  Delicious!

Much better than another Chile Verde recipe I've tried - tastes just like my favorite Mexican Taqueria. I did mod it a little ;-)...I added lemon juice when searing the pork, substituted red for the yellow bell pepper, 12 New Mexico Hatch chiles instead of 8 poblanos, no jalipenos, at least one less quart checken stock, 5 sliced carrots, and added one large diced potato. The tomatillos and cilantro at the end pull it all together

Very good! I cut the tomatillos in half and out them cut side down and roasted them under the broiler to soften them and give a roasted flavor. YUMM!! I also substituted an Anaheim pepper for one of the jalapeños. Warned corn tortillas for dipping and made some Mexican rice and VOILA!! amazing dinner for the whole family :)

This is a work intensive recipe. and the comment about the broth amount is absolutely correct. If anything I'd use 4 cups.
I let this simmer then scooped off the main amount of pepper and puree'd them and put them back - then the texture was right! but the flavor was PERFECT!

this makes a huge batch, but it does freeze well.  I cut the recipe in half and add cooked rice to it, I also serve it with fresh cooked tortillas (the kind in the refrigerator section at the store).  it's a favorite with all the extended family.

This was my first atempt at chile verde and it turned out great. Even better than expected. I cut the recipe in half and I only used 4 cups of stock and it was the perfect amount. I also slow roasted a pork roast with a spicy mexican rub on it and then shredded it instead of cubing it. My husband and son both complained when they saw all the green peppers and tomatillos on the counter but, there were no coplaints at the dinner table.

We love this, I use Anahaim when I can't find Poblano and about 1/2 a serrano for a spicier verde.  I also increase the tomitillo's to a 1 - 1 1/2 lbs and reserve some to top each dish.  Also I too, reduce the liquid and add as needed.

This was great!  Roasted and peeled all the peppers except the jalapenos.  Added cubed potatoes.  Will definately make again.  Thanks!   Modified review 6/1/2009 -I have made this quite a few times now and we LOVE it! If you don't like the green, then you don't like verde!

As I started adding the stock, it was clearly going to be too much so I only added about 1 1/2 quarts instead instead of 4 1/2 - it was still a bit too much.  Tasted great and very easy to make.  I can't get tomatillos where I live so I just used tomatoes instead and it was fine.

This was a really good recipe, it smelt like an authentic mexican resteraunt in our house.  It could have used some more spice though, a little bland for our taste, I will have to try and throw some green tabsco like a another reviewer suggested, but very good flavor

This was very good!  Although I don't understand where everyone else had too much sauce; mine didn't have enough!  Maybe because I scaled the recipe down to serve 4.  Next time I'll do different.  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

Very Good!  I am not sure I used the right peppers(poblano chile peppers), because I couldn't find them.  But I went to a Mexican market and asked a (non-speaking english) produce person, and he pointed me to the ones I used...nonetheless...it still came out really good!  I didn't use all the chicken broth it asked for and it still was PLENTY!  

Husband LOVES Chili Verde and he really enjoyed this recipe!  We served it in flour tortillas (strained the broth of course), it's a keeper!!!

Very good recipe.  My husband loves going to Mexican resturants and having this and I needed to find a way to make it at home.  I add more jalapenos for spice and cut back on the chicken stock because it seemed to soupy at first.

This has a very authentic taste and flavor.  I cut out over half of the broth as people suggested, but there still was SO much sauce, which is great if you want a lot of sauce with it.  I browned the meat and sauted the onion then put everything in the crock pot on high for two hours and low for three hours.  I rated this recipe a three because I wasn't very impressed, it was okay, but I won't make it again.  My suggestion to someone making it would be not to brown the meat first.  Then put it in the crock pot.  This will allow the meat to break apart and shred.

This was the bomb.  I did make some changes:  Used 3 lbs of country style ribs, trimmed and cut up.  Used 2 cans of low sodium fat free chicken broth, and this was plenty.  Cooked the tomatillos until soft before putting into the blender.  Added a few diced potatoes and cooked during last 20 minutes.  From start to finish, this dish took 3 hours.  The pork was extremely tender.  We served this over rice, and with tortillas and guacomole on the side.  What a winner!!!   Great job, Clare

I made a quarter of this recipe and there was plenty for a dinner for two (along with the wonderful Crunchy Lettuce Salad) plus lunch for two.  Took the suggestion of another reviewer and had warmed flour tortillas.  My husband stuffed and ate his burrito style.  There was not too much liquid.  I simmered this covered and uncovered for several hours and it reduced nicely.  This is really an outstanding recipe and I will make this over and over.  Delicious!

Excellent.  I made 1/2 a recipe, and it was great.  Even better as leftovers - I completely agree that the longer it cooks, the better it gets.  Next time I'm going to make at least a whole recipe, perhaps even double, for the freezer.
I took a previous reviewer's suggestion and added some cornmeal to thicken the chili.  Worked well.
I'll be making this whenever tomatillo's are available at my market.
