We Loved this recipe!  After reading the other reviews and making this for myself, I've come to this conclusion...When "blanching" your veggies, cook them until the are the tenderness YOU like.  I cooked mine quite a bit longer than the recipe called for.  When making the sauce, I did NOT add the pepper, at all.  I figured that is something that could be added at the table to an individuals liking.  If serving to guests, be prepared to share the recipe!  This one's a keeper!

I have always hated brussels sprouts since i was a kid because they were so bitter. things change as you grow up.  So I figured I'd try it again. holy cow! This recipe was awesome. Triple the recipe, you'll eat most of them before they are served. they come out super yummy. and don't worry, you can't use too much butter. :)

We severed this dish on Christmas Eve. I listened to an earlier reviewer and cooked the veggies closer to doneness I wanted them to be in the end and it turned out wonderful. (Also cooked them a day ahead) The sauce really compliments the brussel sprouts. I didn't think it did much for the carrots, but the addition of carrots did look pretty. I'll make this again, omitting the carrots.

A nice change of pace for a side dish. I couldn't get the liquid to reduce enough, though, so it was still watery. I did add a tablespoon of cornstarch, as someone else suggested. Also, I steamed the veggies while the glaze reduced, then added it all together to the pan for a few minutes to coat the veggies with the glaze. Yum!

This looked lovely in the dish on our Thanksgiving table, but it was disappointing.  The glaze was thin and scanty, and the vegetable were not nearly cooked enough, according to the recipe times, especially the brussels sprouts. With some changes, this could be a pretty good recipe.

Awesome, just too much pepper, and I like spicy stuff!  Use pepper to taste, not just a measurement, really--it killed the recipe the first time I made it.  I also steam the brussel sprouts and carrots instead of blanching them, worked perfectly!  Otherwise, the sauce is perfect and yummy!

Very good recipe to try to spruce up, a not so fond vegetable of mine, brussel sprouts!  Even tho my husband didnt care for them still, I did like this recipe on them and it made them more edible for me.  I just had to add extra sauce over the ones that I ate!  lol  Thanks for the great recipe!

delicious recipe! too rich for me, with all the butter and sugar, so i cut the proportions in half. the cooking time was just perfect, though. the brussel sprouts were tender without being mushy. yum!

This is the best brussel sprouts recipe ever! It has become a staple for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners, not to mention, that special dinner treat for my husband every so often.  The only thing I tweak, is I add the brussel sprouts and carrots to the brown sugar glaze at the same time.  I cook it all together about 8 minutes.  It lends itself to the perfect blend of taste for both veggies.  Definitely a keeper!

I finally tried this recipe today.  My husband and I both love it.  It was delicious.  I scaled down the recipe for the two of us and had no leftovers.   We finally finished a vegetable at dinner.  Thanks for sharing.

Absolutley Amazing!!! This side dish is a dish on its own!! My Husband is a lot like a kid in the sense that he will eat Veggies, but grumbles all the way. This time- he had not only 2nds, but 3rds!! It is a PERFECT combination of sweet and salty. I made this side dish with Honey-Mustard Chicken on a bed of pasta, but it was the Veggies that stole the show.   I followed the other suggestions and I didn't add pepper. And I also  blanched the veggies a little longer than suggested. And I didn't use a box of Chicken broth. I used a liquid based buillon  to boiling water. I added a little more for more flavor and it was PERFECT. The sweet and Salty of the sauce, along with the slight bitter of the Brussel sprouts and the fantastic taste of the carrotts... I can't even express how good this was!!!   If you have kids that don't like Veggies....This is the dish to make them change thier minds!!!

The glaze was good. I however resorted to frozen brussels because my store did not have any fresh. I don't know if it was because of the moisture in the frozen product or because I boiled them... but, the brussels were water logged and did not pick up the sauce at all. Next time I will buy fresh and steam them to avoid the water problems.

This was alright, the glaze was good, but not what I expected.  I thought that the glaze would be a bit thicker.  Maybe I'll tinker around with it next time.  We love those sprouts & carrots!  Thanks for the idea Christine!

I thought this was an awesome side dish!  It made eating brussel sprouts a joy.  It is not a thick sauce, kind of a sugary, thin, peppery sauce.  I would make this for any company dinner not just holidays.  Makes very good leftovers as well.

I don't eat brussel sprouts...but my fiance does! He liked this dish quite a bit. I liked the carrots a lot! I also added green beans. The brown sugar really makes it yummy. Next time I will boil the sprouts a bit longer, as they were not tender enough so I microwaved them for 1 minute then boiled them again in the sauce. Perfectly done!

This is a really nice twist on two great vegetables.  The second time I mad it my glaze was more like a sauce.  I'll have to play with it to see what I did wrong.  Leftovers are wonderful.

I cooked the vegetables a little longer than the recipe called for.  The dish wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be.  All-in-all, it was a great compliment to Cornish hens.

The fresh carrots and Brussels sprouts make a colorful combination. This is a nice addition to the holiday meal. The fresh vegetables complement the heavier traditional foods such as potatoes and stuffing.

I love carrots and brussel sprouts, but they were both a little undercooked if cooked according to the times given.  Not tasty enough for my kids or husband.

Much better than I expected.  In the past i boiled brussel sprouts, added a little butter and salt and that was it. I had the chicken stock, the carrots, and  brown sugar on hand so gave it a shot. Very good. Will try it again.

The brussel sprouts were my favorite part. I'm still getting used to carotts, so that wasn't something I enjoyed. This is the best recipe for making brussel sprouts!

A nice alternative for Brussels Sprouts. I think how long you blanch the veggies is all a matter of opinion, and the glaze can turn out more sauce like than glazy (though I think it complemented the carrots better than the Brussels sprouts- contrary to a previous reviewer). I added green peppers like another reviewer suggested and they provided a nice little pop of texture and flavor.  I put pepper on half afterwards and really didn't notice much of  a difference.

The glaze overpowered the natural goodness of the brussel sprouts and carrots.  The chicken broth's flavor was most of what could be tasted and the sugar didn't add very much to the flavor.  I don't think I will use this recipe again.

husband AND kids give this a thumbs up.  I used a little less vinegar than recipe called for and since we live at high altitude, I cooked all just a bit longer.  Thanks, again even the kids liked it.

ok, but a lot of butter, for a sauce that really wasn't that great.  You could probably make the same thing with half the butter adn get the same results

I have to give this just 3 stars because I didn't care for it, but my husband liked it. He wasn't overly excited about this new dish as he is with some others that I put in front of him. I will say he is always willing to try the new stuff & lets me know yes or no. I really didn't enjoy making this so he probably won't get it again. Sorry Honey, I just gotta enjoy cookin' it. I made it just as written, but only made half the recipe.

I thought the glaze on this really went well with the carrots. My husband doesn't like cooked carrots, and he thought they were nice. I couldn't tell that it did much for the sprouts, though.  I think next time I make this I will just make it with carrots, and will do the sprouts separately.

Being a Vegetarian, I used vegetarian broth and 1/2 tsp of Lemon Pepper based on other reviews of too much pepper.  I cooked my fresh carrots, then added my frozen broccoli with it till tender.  I transferred to a pan where I added the broth mixture.  This cut my cooking time greatly.  Very good dish!  Will make again.  I enjoyed the tint of sweet.

Really liked this combination. Didn't have any trouble getting the glaze to reduce. Cooked veggies crisp tender and blanched ahead of time. Reduced the pepper by 1/2 and it was enough. Glazed the reheated veggies all together and put in oven uncovered at 350 degreese for 45 minutes while I prepared the rest of my dinner.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner because I love Burssels Sprouts and because I wanted a colourful dish to make the dinner look nice.  I took the advise of several others and cooked the veggies a bit more than recommended.  I also added some cornstarch (mixed with a little water) to the sauce to thicken it a bit.  I would add more next time, as the sauce is still fairly "watery".  Overall it was very colourful, extremely tasty and even the kids came back for seconds.  It was even better as leftovers - I froze the leftovers and then we ate them a couple of weeks later after we were done being tired of turkey leftovers :)  Overall a terrific recipe that I will make again and again.

excellent. It really added variety to the same old boring veggies i eat everyday. I boiled the brussel sprouts and baby carrots, until they were at a texture I would enjoy eating them at. Also, I used hardly any pepper, just a pinch.
