I've never made this version, but have been making one like it for years.  The cranberry and cherry together are wonderful.  I do not use raisins.  I use cinnamon for the spice, tapioca for the flour, and a squirt of lemon juice.  I just make regular pie crust, lattice or otherwise.  This pie is wonderful and always a big hit.

I make this every year for the holidays, it looks and tastes impressive but doesn't require a lot of effort.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. The tartness of the cranberries counteracted the sweetness of the cherries, it was great. I omitted the ginger and the raisins, and I threw in a splash of orange juice, with a small bit of zest....excellent.

This pie turned out great!  The combination of cherries and cranberries was perfect for Thanksgiving.  The lattice on the first one I made didn't get done as well as I would have liked because I was anxious and kept opening the oven.  The second time I was more patient and the pie was beautiful.
