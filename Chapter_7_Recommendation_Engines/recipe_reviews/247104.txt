A couple of small changes, to suit my taste preferences, and this was lovely. As the daily gourmet suggested onion was added (half a Spanish onion lightly fried to soften before adding the tomato), some more fresh herbs - basil, which always goes well with tomato, coriander (cilantro) leaves for gentle spiciness - and omitted the salt ( there is more than enough in the stock cube).
I will have no hesitation in making this again and I may try it with hot paprika!

This recipe worked for my grass fed pork steak. Was absolutely delicious. Iâ€™m a gardener so lots of fresh spices made this. Will use this recipe again.

I made this except that I had bone in pork blade steaks so no flattening needed. 
I used a can of diced tomatoes since I didn't have fresh tomatoes.  It turned out nicely. I will use white rice next time. I used a seasoned yellow rice.

I think this would benefit by the addition of sliced onions. Very good and simple recipe, but needs a little more seasoning.
