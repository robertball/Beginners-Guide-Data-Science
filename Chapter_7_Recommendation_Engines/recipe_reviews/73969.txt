Excellent! Prepared as directed and served over brown rice. The rice really adds to the flavor and texture. Could easily substitute soy crumbles for the seitan. I was concerned about the vegetable combination, but it was delightful. My husband and children agree. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe.

It's ok. I added 2 cloves of garlic and 1/2 tsp of dried dill for added flavor. To be honest, that didn't help much. It was terribly bland. I decided to put it over quinoa instead of rice. I don't think it made too much of a difference. If I make this again I will rethink the ingredients to make it more enjoyable.

This was pretty good, but not great.  There's not much to it.  Good for a light meal though, but not when you want flavor.  I didn't use the seitan since I couldn't find any, but used kidney beans instead.

I followed the directions and found that this dish  came out not so much like a stew- but more like a soup. I even added some cornstarch to try and thicken it up but was not very suceesful.

This recipe is easy, tasty, and healthy.  I recommend adding at least two cloves of minced fresh garlic in order to give the soup a little more flavor.
