I knew that the spice amounts would be too much for me (personal preference), so I literally cut them in half, and those flavors still were prominent.  Cinnamon, allspice, and ginger are very strong spices, so I'd recommend that you start out modestly and then add more if necessary because once they're in there, you can't take them out.   I didn't use any frozen fruit, so I did add ice, I like my smoothies thick.   This is one of those "outside-the-box" smoothies, and I like the fact that it's not loaded with additional sweeteners, the fruit takes care of that.

Whoa, this is a little strange. It was kind of more like carrot cake batter than carrot cake. The spices even turn it that dark batter color. I really liked though how healthy it is with the cinnamon, ginger, carrots, and fruit. I only had frozen fruit, so I had to use an additional 1/2 cup non dairy milk. I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk.

I added the full amounts for the spices, but it was too much for me.  I recommend doing at least half the spices.  I also substituted milk instead of  soy milk.  Overall, this was a good recipe.
