The cake came out very elegant and was delicious.I used 3/4 cup oil instead of butter. The texture and taste is very close to fruit cake. The only difficulty was to prevent ourselves from eating before the cake was mature. I plan to make one more today. Thanks for a great recipe.

Absolutely amazing.  Delicious!

I cut back the cooking time to 1 3/4 hours, though.

This is an insanely good cake. Very easy to make and it really does get better after a few days. It is also good chilled. Keep an eye on the baking time.

Even though I haven't tasted this cake yet (I am saving it for Christmas Day) it was easy to make and smells so good! I used multi-coloured glace cherries and added finely chopped almonds and pistachios. My guests will be impressed for sure!

Nice and simple but might lack flavor, I don't know, I haven't made it, I just read the recipe.

I wasn't sure what to expect and after it baked and cooled, I wrapped it all well and tossed it into the freezer for about a week before using/serving.  It was dense like a real fruit cake and had nice simple flavor.
