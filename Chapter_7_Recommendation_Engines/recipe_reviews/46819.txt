The bok choy turn too soft if cook on the same time with broccoli. What I did, I steam the broccoli for a moment then add to the chicken the same time with bok choy only for several minutes. It works well for me.All veggie still crispy.

This is a good recipe, but you have to keep in mind that each soya sauce and oyster sauce has their own taste, so the result of the recipe will differ according to which brand you've used. I usually use broth (or add a bit of bouillon in the water), add 1 tbs soy sauce and 1 tbs oyster sauce into it, and sprinkle a bit of pepper.
I also use 1 tbs hoisin sauce and 1/4 tsp five spice powder in the chicken marinade. Sometimes I replace the chicken with pork or beef, and add 1 tbs chinese rice wine or dry sherry into the marinade. For quicker vegetable cooking, put a lid on your skillet/wok after you've added the water mixture, set the fire on high. In less than 5 minutes the veggies will be soft but still crunchy.

The first time I made this, it wasn't horrible, it's just the second time around it was so much better. This recipe is excellent, after you alter slightly.  On it's own, the pepper can be a little dominant as far as taste and bok choy doesn't seem necessary.  My suggestion is, use more soy and oyster sauce, cut out the pepper and leave the bok choy optional.  After that, it was sensational.  Adding a little more sugar and a chicken bouillon cube to the water doesn't hurt either.

I've been making stir-fry's since I started cooking, and this was by far the best one that's ever come out of my kitchen.  I put it over chow mein noodles.  This is the best!

I'm not sure why, since all the right ingredients seemed to be here, but this was really kind of boring. I would have thought the oyster sauce, soy sauce and garlic all would have contributed great flavor but it all just sort of got lost. Perhaps some sherry, toasted sesame oil and chicken broth would have helped. I did back off the pepper, which seemed excessive,  because as the saying goes, you can always add more but you can't take it away.  I also steered away from the cooking method as directed. Since some of the ingredients require different cooking times I cooked them separately, then combined it all at the end. I added mushrooms and  served this over rice noodles, which was a nice combo, but unfortunately tonight's dinner was rather forgettable.

Awesome! I marinaded the chicken in oyster sauce, soy sauce and garlic paste overnight. I added more during the cooking when I saw it wasn't going to be saucy enough. I didn't need to add any cornstarch as it thickened up quite nicely on its own. Finally, I found that the bok choy needed very very little cooking - I stirred it in, covered the pan for about 3 mins, and it was tender crisp. Perfect! This would be great with carrots, peppers, bean sprouts, mushrooms etc, and I would be interested in making it again with a handful of chopped peanuts or cashews. Very versatile! Thanks, unieng!

Excellent stir fry.  My husband and I loved it.  And the possibilities with this are endless -- next time I might make it spicy with red pepper flakes and add some peanuts.

I loved this, but I've turned it into a stir fry. I added red and green peppers, waterchestnuts, zuccini, squash, and mushrooms. Also with the cornstarch mix, i add a teaspoon of spicy chili sauce, little more oyster sauce, sesame oil and sesame seeds. This is a great touch for flavor.

Great recipe!  I did not have oyster sauce, so I doubled the soy sauce.  Also, I added 1 T. sherry to the marinade.  Instead of water I used chicken broth and I omitted the bok choy.  I had a microwave steamer bag of broccoli - so I added the fully cooked broccoli at the very end (so it didn't get mushy).  Will be making this again!

This was a good recipe.  I also increased the amount of oyster sauce and soy sauce and reduced the pepper (thanks to the other reviewers comments).  I found the cooking time a bit long in this recipe and as a result, the broccoli became too soft.  By reducing the times by about half, the recipe was much fresher and tender rather than soft.

We really like this recipe, and it's a great base for mixing up different meats/shrimp and veggies. We like it with rice and noodles. It's very easy, especially when we buy the fresh, pre-chopped stir-fry mix from our grocery store.  I think frozen veggies would really alter the quality of the dish.    Just a few notes...I make this for 2, and other than cutting back the chicken, I use the same ingredients, and double the sauce...so not sure if it would serve 6 as suggested.  Also, we use sodium reduced products fot the sauce, and still find it salty.  I feel that the sodium is much higher than as noted in the nutritional information.

I didn't really care for the recipe but my husband liked it, and we both thought it had way too much black pepper.  I'll probably try it again, but put about 1/4 of the pepper in it.  Also, more soy sauce at the end helped a lot.

I found this was really tasty and not at all boring. I left out the bok choy because I couldn't find any and added some extra broccoli to make up for it. Instead of adding cornstarch at the end to thicken it, I added some leftover rice I had and let that absorb the extra liquid. Threw some chopped peanuts on for garnish and it turned out to be a great dish.

This tastes just like what you would get at a Chinese buffet.  I think the oyster sauce makes it - it has the "Chinese food" flavor to it that I wouldn't know how else to replicate.  I doubled the sauce and served over white rice.  Very yummy!

I made the recipe exactly as written, but because I used baby bok choy I added it after the broccoli had cooked for a few minutes.  We enjoyed it last night, and the leftovers were even better today :) I'd highly recommend going to an Asian market if you can and buying high quality dark soy sauce and oyster sauce (cheaper too!).  This is a good basic stir fry and would be great with many combos of meat and veggies.

Awesome recipe!  To jazz it up a bit, I add about a tablespoon of chopped ginger to the onion and garlic.  I also add about a tablespoon or hot chili oil to the 3 tablespoons of peanut oil.  It gives the dish extra spice and flavor.  I do as suggested and add more oyster sauce, pepper, and sugar.  I don't like cooking with bok choy so I use cabbage.  I've also added shrimp and tofu to the recipe.  This one is a keeper!  As good as if you ordered it at a restaurant.  Oh, and always use Jasmine rice, it taste the best. :)

I love this recipe as do my kids. It's so easy and delicious. Plus it doesn't have a ton of calories. Which i s great. I use vidalia onions, add extra broccoli and bok choy because my kids fight over who gets the most broccoli florets.

I thought this was pretty good. It kind of reminded me of a mix between chop suey and a stir-fry. I subbed some fresh spinach for the bok choy, but still used the broccoli. I also cut the amount of black pepper in half, as I find it kind of a dominant flavoring. However, after it was done I ended up sprinkling on a litle extra. I also cut the cook time down about 2 minutes when cooking the chicken and then when adding the vegetables. After adding the cornstarch I cooked for about 1 minute and not 5. It was plenty cooked. It's probably not something I would make again, but I didn't think it neccessarily tasted low-calorie which was nice.

I was shocked by how easy this was to make and how delicious it turned out. I used a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies in place of the bok choy and broccoli and added a can of water chestnuts and a handful of cashews. I'm giving the sauce/cooking method 5 stars because I couldn't believe how delicious and intense the flavors were coming from so few ingredients and such easy prep! This is my new weeknight staple, thank you so much!

The instructions were nice and clear.  And I was excited because I had all of the ingredients on hand.  But in the end, it was just kind of bland.  I even added more and different spices.  But it was still bland.  Sorry.  I don't like to give non-stellar reviews.

This was really yummy.  I too added a bit more oyster and soy sauce when I added the veggies, and I made sure to cut the broccoli into small pieces so it wouldn't take as long to cook.  I covered my wok with tin foil also to help the veggies steam and reduced the cooking time on the veggies so they wouldn't get too soft.  Will be making this again!

We liked this a lot!  I doubled the recipe except didn't use any extra oil (which worked fine).  Next time I think I will add some more veggies and add the onions later - they ended up pretty mushy.  The sauce had a great flavor and the meat was really tender!  Will definitely make again.

This dish was simple and delicious! I added mushrooms which I put in with the onions and garlic.  I also added the broccoli a step before the directions wanted.  Next time I will only cook the onions for a couple minutes before moving on -- I thought they were far too done in the end.  Again, DELICIOUS! Thanks!

Good recipe easy to substitute.  I used peppers, mushrooms and bok choy as veggies.  Lots of pepper in the recipe -may have been too spicy for some, but my husband & I loved it.

I love this recipe. I add a little sweet and sour sauce and chopped garlic to the soy sauce and marinate the chicken for at least an hour before cooking. Cook time is too long for the vegetables. Awesome with sticky white rice.

This is a simple, yet delicious recipe.  It's easily customizable to one's taste.  I believe that preparing a recipe according to one's taste is key.  I don't understand some of the lower ratings.  Why make a recipe if you KNOW you don't like oyster sauce?

This recipe was very good, but I had to take a few other reviewers' recommendations.  The first was that the amount of pepper had to be cut to 1/4 tsp; I used chicken soup instead of water and added extra garlic.  This made it enjoyable for the whole family.  Served on a bed of rice it was the perfect, easy weekday meal.

I made this dish for a recent dinner party. While making it, I thought it would be a hit, because it smelled so wonderful.  But it turned out to be quite bland tasting.  Adding more garlic might help some, but I don't think I would bother making it again.  My guests usually ask for the recipe for dishes I make, but I noticed this time that not a single person asked.  It was b-o-r-i-n-g!

My family really likes this recipe a lot, as altered. 

Though I made it with the pepper (agree - way too dominating a flavor), I made it with no pepper and added unsalted peanuts....family loved it this way!

Very dissapointing, with all the wonderful reviews I was looking forward to this recipe.  I did not like the lack of tast, nor did I enjoy the slimmy texture the cornstartch mixture gave this.  I will not make it again, after I tasted it I ordered pizza.

This was a very good recipe and simple to make. My only "complaint" is that it didn't have as much of a sauce as I would have liked-it might not supposed to, I'm not sure. It was still a very good recipe and I will make it again.

Very good! Used more soy and oyster sauce, water and added a cube of bouillon. I only used pepper to sprinkle on my chicken while it was marinating. Simple and yummy without the cost of takeout.

since I am a Vegetarian, I used extra firm tofu in place of the chicken.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really good.  I will definately be making this one again.  I would say that this is a pepper heavy recipe which is great for me since I am a lover of black pepper but if you are not a fan so much you may want to cut back just a tad.

Delicious.  I didn't have oyster sauce, so I just used more soy sauce.  I also reduced the pepper a bit, and added a tad more sugar.  I used baby bok choy. Also, I steamed the broccoli for a few minutes before adding in with the bok choy, and used chicken broth instead of water.

Thank God for this recipe. I am in law school, loan money has dried up, exams are closing in on me, and I had neither the time nor the money to get the takeout I craved tonight. I made this with things I already had in the freezer/pantry. I omitted the bok choy because I didn't have it, and I used onion powder because I'm out of onions. I did everything else the same, and it was really delicious. Quick, easy, tasted just like it came from a restaurant. And I'm no poorer for it.

Amazing and delicious! My bf said it tasted just like restaurant style and I agree.  The only changes I made: double the soy sauce and oyster sauce.  Also if you can get the bok choy, get it - it's a great additional vegetable with a nice crunch.  Will start to add this to the weekly dinner lineup! :)

Very tasty! Was slightly disappointed at how little "juice" was created. Next time I'll try to double up on the marinade. Also think I'll add carrots and baby corn:)
Update....Added baby corn and sweet peas and trippled marinade to bump this up to 5*s

This was really good, and the sauce was great. I would have preferred more broccoli and greens, but otherwise, the taste was great and I'd definitely make it again. The only problem was that it didn't taste as good after reheating it the next day in the microwave, but it's still healthier than take-out and easy.

Meh.  I followed the recipe exactly but marinated the chicken overnight.  It wasn't flavorful at all.   Kind of a disappointment.  Maybe put ginger and garlic in the marinade?

I'm a HUGE fan of 'chicken w. broccoli' from the "Chinese Food Place" and I like it so much I had to figure out how to make it at home & save myself some money.  
So, my review is for "Chinese Chicken & Broccoli" , based off this recipie.  I don't like much beyond Chicken, Broccoli, Sauce and Rice with this meal - so that's what I made.
I used a medium sized onion, 1/2 thawed bag of frozen broc. florets, garlic from the glass bottle in the fridge.  I was indiscriminate with the soy sauce in the marinade (at least 1 cup), and added it all to the pan when cooking.  I also used a little more water (just b/c the heat was up too high when I was cooking & the sauce was boiling away).  
I added the water, pepper, corn starch & sugar all at the same time, and only 1 minute before adding the bag of frozen broccoli.  I didn not cook for 10 minutes (running out of sauce), so I just cooked it until the broc was warm & the chicken was done.
This recipie is VERY easy, allows a lot of room for doing what you want (esp. as far as the sauce, timing & use of fresh food goes). and it tastes VERY GOOD.
I will DEFINATELY make again (prob 1x a week).
BUT be warned, if you're one who likes the sauce, you will need to make more because this recipe doesnt make a lot of the sauce.

Aweeeeeesome!  I can finally use up all that bok choy!  I used 4 1/2 boneless chicken breasts, 2 shallots, 1 garlic, 2 small red peppers (substituted for the broccoli), 3 bunches of bok choy, and some California-style vegetables.  I also used hoisin sauce instead of oyster.  Fantastic!

I thought it was OK, but it didn't pass the picky boyfriend test.  He thought it was too "gooey".  Maybe next time, I would try the recipe with less liquid and no corn starch...like true stir fry.

My first try at using a recipe from allrecipes.com. Unieng you are awesome!  My husband and I loved the dish. We may cut back on the pepper a bit, but otherwise, fabulous. Thanks!

Absolutely delicious!  I can't believe it tastes so good and is healthy too!  I didn't change anything in the recipe and it came out perfect.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I have cooked this several times already now. I cook the chicken first, but when it is halfway cooked, I add gussies (baby corn). Let it cook for a while and before it is fully cooked, I add the sauce and I double it so we have more to go over rice, letting it cook for a few minutes. And since it takes a while to get thick, I add the water and cornstarch first before throwing in the vegetables. Then I let the vegetables steam on top for a few minutes and then mix everything, letting it cook for a few minutes more. Two things: I used baby broccoli (broccolini) as it is easier to cook with the bok choy and this dish is best cooked with a lid so that the sauce doesn't evaporate and the vegetables can steam properly. 

It's a GREAT dish, my kids love this and they don't usually like chinese food.

Delicious.  I added 16 oz of extra firm tofu cubes to the chicken and doubled the sauce.  Added some chopped red peppers for color.  Beautiful and definitely a keeper!

Amazing, and simple. I added a little hoisin sauce (1/2 Tbs), and it added a nice sweetness instead of sugar. I also found it is a lot of chicken, so i knocked it down to 10oz, and increased the broccoli. I used to love getting chicken and broccoli from the Chinese restaurant, but there were times I had no clue if I really had chicken on my plate. This recipe allows me to make my favorite dish right at home, and taste so fresh and light paired with brown rice. WONDERFUL!!!

Very delicious. Needs a little more soy sauce, I feel, and perhaps a little less pepper. Otherwise, very very delicious.

Very good start! Added mushrooms, 1T red pepper flakes (which gives it a nice bite) and substitute chicken stock for water.   We will make this again.

I added a little more soy sauce and oyster sauce after reading a few of the reviews.  I still feel like this recipe was missing something.  Maybe the next time I'll use chicken broth instead of water so the sauce tastes better.  The full teaspoon of black pepper was also a little too overpowering for our tastes!

Okay, a little on the mild side as far as flavor. Not sure what the Fish Sauce brought to the recipe. If you are looking for authentic chinese flavor this is not is but still great as a stir-fry type of dish. Probably would be good with a marinade.

Perhaps I did something wrong, but I pretty much think I followed all the steps, but this is not a recipe I will recommend to anyone. It turned out to be too hot for my taste, all I can tasted was the pepper, I also think there was too much of the soy sauce.

Loved this recipe!  Like some others I didn't have oyster sauce on hand so I used extra soy.  I also used fresh green beans in place of the bok choi as that's what I had, the 4 stars are because I added ginger, chili, rice vinegar and more garlic, it seemed a little bland without it.

This was the easiest and best recipe for Chicken and Broccoli I have ever had. I, too, found the bok choy unnecessary, but added mushrooms. I doubled the sauce, but added 2 T. of hoisin sauce, 2T. of rice wine vinegar, and 1T of orange juice concentrate (just b/c I was making OJ for the kids).  Adding these few things took the fishy taste, mentioned by some viewers, away. It was just what I was hungry for and even better the next day. May try it with steak next time, just to see. Definitely a keeper and my all time "go-to" recipe.

Delicious! This recipe was perfect, it tasted BETTER then the chicken and broccoli I get from the restaurants and it was much healthier.  The only change I made is I used low sodium soy sauce instead of the regular sodium kind. Still tasted great, still had a taste of salt and flavor so I didn't loose a thing. Thanks so much for this recipe!

waaaaaaaaaay too much pepper, I will greatly decrease that next time or loes it altogether.  I used a bag of fresh stir fry veggies (already clean & cut) in leu of all veggies in the recipe  Was out of cornstarch so I omitted that part.  This recipe was great!

This is excellent!  It has become a favorite in our house.  I did make changes to the recipe, but only after making the original first!    1) I leave out the bok choy just because it is harder to find in my area, so I double up on the broccoli. 2) I cut the pepper in half.  Even at half there is plenty of pepper to go around.  Add more on your plate if you need it. 3) I prefer a little more sauce, so I use:  2 Tbl oyster sauce, 4 Tbl soy, 1 c water, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 2 tsp sugar.  The cornstarch step is 2 Tbl cornstarch with 2 Tbl water.  I think this is mostly doubling the sauce with exception to the pepper. 4) I use 2 Tbl vegetable oil instead of 3.  I think 2 isn't skimping in the slightest on taste and saves calories. ***Thanks for the great recipe as it had to be great from the start to get to this final recipe for us!***

I followed the directions exactly, aside from adding the broccoli and bok choy at different times (so they wouldn't get mushy). I'm glad I tasted it before serving because it was very boring and had nowhere near the flavor I was hoping for. I ended up adding more soy sauce and some Thai spicy jelly sauce I had on hand to make it more interesting. It's a good base for a stir fry, but not that great.

THis was great!  Was looking for something to please my 9 year old when he asked for Chinese.  Had everything except the bok choy and subbed celery instead.  I loved the peppery taste; that did it for me.  Thanks for sharing this one!

I used pork chops instead of chicken and did not use brocoli.I agree with others, more soy sauce and oyster sauce. Next time I make it I would use pepper flakes to make it spicy and add the bok choy towards the end just for a couple of minutes so they stay crispy. great flavor and very easy

My dad and I made 3x the recipe. We cooked the chicken, and vegetables separately and then threw them together for a few minutes at the end so the flavors stay distinct. We separated the bok choy leaves from the stems and cut up the stem part and cooked that part longer than the leaves. It was excellent.

Made recipe exactly described. Was able to find all the ingredient from my local megamarket. I spread this over jasmine rice, and it was very good. Next time, I will reduce the pepper to half, and double the soy sauce and oyster sauce. I used left over chicken from a roaster, so it was much more economical then using just chicken breasts (and dare I say it added more flavor).

This is such an excellent base for chinese stir fries. After making this recipe for a while, which is absolutely delicious as is, I was able to just make great authentic-tasting chinese dishes freehand. No recipe necessary! It is great. One thing that I recommend is to thinly slice the chicken, WITH the grain, not against. This makes the chicken soooo much more tender! You wouldn't believe what a difference it makes. It is how most chinese restaurants slice their chicken. Also, always make sure your wok is VERY hot!!! So important... Excellent recipe! 5+ Stars!!!

I used cauliflower instead of broccoli becuse thats what I had.  I didn't have the bok choy either.  It was decent, but needed something.  I added garlic powder, onion powder and a dash of ground ginger.  The kids didn't really like it, neither did hubby.  I think I'll play with it and use broccoli next time (my preference).  Thanks!

I loved this recipe but made just a few adjustements to suit my taste.
1. DO NOT ADD Starch at the end
2. Make bok choy optional only if you like it
3. Use 2 chicken breast haves cut into pieces
4. Use 1.5 tbs oyster sauce and 3 tbs soy sauce
5. I accidentally added 1/2 tbs of teriyaki sauce and loved it.
6. Last tip first add chopped onion for about 10 min till start terning golden and only then add minced garlic, otherwise garlic gets over fried and nasty tasting
P.S. when adding black pepper use your personal preference

Taste close to the Chinese restaurant.  Followed reviewer and after adding veggies added an extra tbsp of oyster sauce and 2 tbsp soy sauce but still needed a little more juice.  Other than that family liked it.

This was good with some modifications.  I doubled the marinade since I had a little over a pound of chicken and read some of the other reviews that said that there wasn't enough sauce.  I didn't have bok choy, but substituted mushrooms and savoy cabbage.  After adding all the vegetables I added another tablespoon of oyster sauce and 2 tablespoons of soy sauce.  I also added a little more of the cornstarch mixture.  With these changes we found the dish flavorful and not the least bit bland.

Good Flavor!  I did have to make a few small changes - doubled the cornstarch mixture, doubled the garlic, and added one tsp of crushed ginger.  The ginger did add a lot to the flavor.

Well, my husband and I thought this was pretty mediocre. I would give this 2 stars, but my kids really liked it. So, 3 stars. Not the most flavorful stirfry, but it is kid-friendly. Thanks for sharing.

I thought this was great. I certainly did not hold back on the pepper. It wouldn't hurt to have a little more! :) I followed the recipe precisely and found this one to be very good. Wouldn't change a thing. Be sure to make lots, it will be gone quick. Thanks Unieng. Got anymore?! :)

This is very tasty and easy to make!  Exactly what a busy mom needs! The only change to the ingredients I did was I used light soy sauce, because that is all I have.  I didn't get much of a sauce at the end of the cooking time.  I think this can be fixed by cooking the chicken on high for only 5 minutes in order to sear it, then reducing it to med-high for the rest of the cook time.  I had cooked it on high for the full 10 minutes per the recipe.  I noticed that some reviews stated that there was too much pepper.  I did not reduce the amount of pepper at all, but I had combined the sugar, water and pepper in a bowl first.  A lot of the pepper stuck to the sides of the bowl, so maybe that's why I didn't think there was too much!
This recipe is a definate keeper!  I will make this again and again!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did make a few alterations. I marinated the chicken overnight in the marinade mixture, didn't use any vegetable oil - used chicken stock instead, used stock instead of the 1/2 cup of water, reduced the pepper and used baby bok choy. At the endI tasted the sauce and thought it needed a little zip, so I sprinkled in a little seasoning mix that had red pepper and coriander in it. I actually wanted 5 spice powder, but was out. This tasted wonderful and I'll make it again with my alterations.

This tastes great!  It was a bit overcooked.  I only used broccoli and might add carrots next time.  The soy sauce was a bit overpowering.

This recipe was good, not great.  It's fast and easy, and nutritious and low-fat, so I'll definitely make it again.  I made the following changes: omit the bok-choy and pepper; use 3tbsp oyster sauce if you like this flavor; increase the sugar to 1 1/2 tsp; add peanuts, this really gives it a variety of flavors and some crunch.  Some reviewers have suggested to increase the cooking time.  I cut my broccoli pretty small AND increased the time, and the veggies were very soft.  Adjust cooking time according to size of your broccoli; it should be tender-crisp.  This made a good meal served with rice and (store bought) egg rolls.

I added fresh ginger and water chestnuts.  I omitted the broccoli. Totally yummy per my husband who loves Chinese food.  (I am getting to like Chinese food and this recipe certainly passes.)   The sauce really comes together nicely and that is a big plus!!!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and tripled the soy sauce and oyster sauce, used chicken broth in place of the water, and cut way down on the pepper.  I also added a generous tablespoon of sriracha sauce, so it was nice and spicy.  It was a little salty but still really tasty.  And so easy - I'll make this again!

bf made this and it came out so good.. i was expecting it to be a little saltier.. but our soy was regular soy, not "dark soy" (if it really makes a difference) .. added 1 T of rice cooking wine and 1/4 tsp chinese five spice to the marinade as suggested by SummerRain.. used regular cabbage for bok choy.. ty so much for the recipe

I was wonderful! It took a little time to prepare but in the end was worth it! I served it over jasmine rice. I'm definitely making it again.

Made this tonight and it was fantastic. I didn't have time to read other reviews like I usually do to get an idea of changes, so I was pleased it was wonderful as is. I double the recipe for our family and tripled the marinade, as we like a plenty of sauce. The only other thing I did was to add a bit of red pepper flakes toward the end. We like spicy, but I didn't add much.   It's really perfect as is, thanks!

Loved this!  Great weeknight dinner, very easy and quick.  Added approx. 1 tsp. of red pepper flakes since we like spicy.  No need to use the cornstarch mixture.

Wow! This recipe was great--easy to make. Did not have oyster sauce so used 3 tablespoons soy sauce as another reviewer suggested.  Served over brown rice.  This was just as it Unieng says--delcious,fast, healthy and impressive.  Thanks!

LOVE it!  I doubled everything but the onions, pepper and chicken and broccoli so that it would make more sauce and served on japanese noodles.  This will be a staple in my house.

A nice surprise...really tasted quite authentic for such a jiffy prep time.  Easy to tweak and add new things.  Thanks!  Used someone else's idea of just soy sauce because I had no oyster sauce.

Made this for dinner tonight. My family loved it! The only changes I made were adding an extra tablespoon of oyster sauce and soy sauce to the marinade. The sauce was so good and could work with a variety of vegetables and proteins. I might even make this with tofu one day.

This is very good. Unfortunately, I ran out of soy sauce in the middle--only 1 tablespoon.  I added a can of chinese vegetables with the broccoli.  Served it with an egg roll.  The pepper was a good but surprising addition.

I agree with most of the other reviews in that the sauce(oyster and Soy) and the water needs to be doubled. I also added some crushed red pepper flakes to give it a little "kick".   To keep the vegetables from getting too soft, I added them at the same time I added the cornstarch( in the last 5 min of cooking).

This was very good. I agree that there wasn't enough sauce at the end of cooking and adding more soy sauce made it too salty.  I think you should add an additional half cup of water and add a boullion cube.  The Bok Choy is a keeper in this. loved it!

Definitely good. I added twice the oyster sauce and soy sauce and I'm so glad I did. Pepper was awesome in it - don't be scared of the full teaspoon! I didn't use any bok choy, just a ton of broccoli, which took a little bit longer to cook than the instructions said. In the future, I would cook the chicken for less than 10 minutes. Also, I had to add more than 1/2 cup water with the broccoli, there was just not enough liquid to make a sauce.

Wow, this was great! I didn't have any oyster sauce, so I used fish sauce instead. It was quite salty, however. Next time I will use low sodium soy sauce. I also separated the bok choy stems and leaves, adding the stems in with the broccoli and the leaves at the very end to ensure even cooking. Thanks for this one!

Very good and simple recipe. While marinating, I also added come cooking wine to the chicken to give it additional flavor. I omitted the bok choy and it was just fine! Great, fast dish! I will add carrots and mushrooms next time!

I thought this was just OK. I can see where, as some folks said, it would be a good starter to add other veggies, but it was really rather bland. I even added more oyster and soy sauce as advised. Definitely would up the garlic and perhaps some cayenne or something.  The advice about adding the bok choy at the very end is also true.

Delicious!  Definitely use the oyster sauce and low sodium soy sauce, skip the pepper, and add extra vegies at the end, so as not to overcook.  I happened to have/used:  yellow pepper, green onion, and tofu, which I added with the rest of called for ingredients.  Oh...and increase the amount of sauce--it makes this recipe.  Way easy and quick!

Really good & easy recipe.  I doubled all the marinade/sauce ingredients because we like the sauce.  I didn't have any onions so I added some onion powder in with the garlic while it sauteed.  I didn't have any bok choy and I steamed the broccoli in the microwave before adding it into the mixture.  I was glad i did...once the cornstarch was added, the sauce thickened right away.  We really enjoyed the flavors and it does have some spice to it with the black pepper.  Thanks for a greay recipe!

The ingredients in this recipe are spectacular together. The cook times suggested are not.  Substitute 5-7 minutes for each recipe segment that recommends 10.  A couple other helpful hints:  My sauce was completely reduced by the time I added cornstarch, so I added back about 3/4 c. water (this will vary depending on cook times).  I also added a generous splash of soy sauce and oyster sauce here to bring out these flavors.  Finally, do not add the bok choy until the last minutes of cooking so the leaves maintain some crispness instead of resembling soggy spinach.  The flavor of this recipe couldn't get any better.  Oh, and beware that a whole teaspoon of pepper makes this dish pretty spicy.  Use a half teaspoon if you want to avoid that.

Really good with healthy ingredients!   I didn't have oyster sauce so I used extra soy.  Turned out great because the sugar added to the dish adds enough sweetness.  Will make this again!

This was good, but needed a few modifications.  I made it as stated and then made some changes before serving.  Definately double the soy sauce marinade.  I couldn't find oyster sauce in the store, so I used hoisin sauce. I searched all over and no one around here sells oyster sauce, even the 2 asian markets.  Online it says you can sub. soy sauce for oyster sauce.  I added some ginger, red pepper flakes, and garlic chili sauce to the sauce.  Maybe some fresh ginger next time.  Oh, double the water if you double those first two ingredients, but don't double the sugar or it is too sweet (as my husband said).  I just made it with chicken, onion and broccoli.  Would make again, but with modifications.

I love pepper, but if you don't ease up on the amount because it is very strong.  It had good flavoring!

Really yummy! I'm in a family of 5 so I added a bit more chicken, brocolli and bok choy. I put all the veggies and chicken on a platter, I put white basmati rice in a bowl and I put the sauce in a gravy boat. So you grab a bunch of rice, top it with the stirfry and then pur on some sauce. Yummy! I also got my family to eat it with chop-sticks which was amusing to watch! Overall easy and really good, we all had seconds!

I thought that this recipe was just okay. I loved using the bok choy as I have never used it before and it was quite good. If you do make this, be sure to decrease your pepper as suggested by others-I forgot and it was so overpowering.

I always order chicken w/broccoli at Chinese restaurants. This recipe was as good as most and better than some that I have had. How nice that I can now make my own at home. I used carrots instead of the cabbage and served it over Jasmine rice. The whole family loved it. Thanks.

When you double the sauce (as others have recommended) and marinate the chicken for a few hours, this recipe is awesome! So yummy and pretty healthy too.

I loved it, it actually tasted like Chinese food from a restaurant.  My family loved it too. Good thing I read the reviews because the oyster sauce was hard to find so I ended up using extra soy sauce like others said and it was still great.

Great basic recipe. I couldn't use oyster sauce, because of shellfish allergies, but substituted teriyaki sauce instead. I also added about a tsp of Sriracha chili sauce. Gives it a bit of a kick.

This was very good.  The only problem was when I added the cornstarch mixture at the end.  Then everything started sticking to the wok.  I didn't have oyster sauce, so I used more soy sauce, and I added a few carrots.  I ended up reducing the cooking times for each step so that it wouldn't burn.

this was really good! My boyfriend says this was one of the best home cooked meals he ever had. i added a few red pepper flakes and a little more water. With a dash of duck sauce and a little more soy. I had no oyster sauce. I also added carrots and green pepper. I had it on top of spaghetti. Will make again for sure.  It was gooood!!!

I made this recipe last night for my family.  They said that it was like eating take out from our local chinese take out place.  The only thing I added extra was more soy (I love soy), and some yellow peppers and water chestnuts.

I followed the recipe exactly and although the sauce had a nice consistency, I found it to be lacking in flavour. All I could taste was the pepper. I didn't find it special enough to make again, although I now have oyster sauce to try out some other recipes that need it!

I didn't use cornstarch because I didn't have any.  And I used light soya sauce instead.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it didn't turn out that special.  The chicken was way over cooked which was a waste of expensive breast.  Everything was good except the meat.

A little too peppery. I'll also use half the amount next time I make it. And add some water chestnuts.

Great recipe!  I added 2 TBS of a garlic/roasted tomatoe paste in place of the garlic that the original recipe called for.  Next time, like the others, I will lower the amount of pepper.  My entire family enjoyed the meal for the first time!

I only added some red pepper for color but t thought the dish was rather bland.  Maybe I’d add some fresh ginger and more soy after the veggies are cooked the next time

Delicious and easy.  I might change this a little for a variation. Like add more vegetables or different types of pepper. As is it is Fantastic!

I made the following modifications, and loved it! I like meals flavorful, and thus this worked for me. Used 1.5 white teaspoons sugar, added a splash of red wine vinegar (why not?), used 4 garlic cloves, double the oyster sauce,  added only a small amount of  black pepper (few twists from a grinder), added a little chicken bouillon, a shake of red pepper, and put the broccoli in as the same time as the chicken so it had more time to soften (based on another review). Put over white rice and added sriracha on top. I would say better than takeout...

This recipe was great..it was gone by the time I thought about taking a picture.. The only thing I changed was that I didn't have any bok choy so I just added extra broccoli. . I'm sure it would be even better with the bok choy.. My family loved it... I will definitely be making this again

This is FANTASTIC!!   The flavor reminds me SO much of Moo Goo Gui Pan!  I doubled the sauce (thank goodness) and didn't have the water chestnuts but had some baby corn, so I used that.  Served over zucchini ribbons, yum!!!

I made this tonight ( my own version of it) I used sesame oil instead of veggie oil and added a little dry white wine to the marinade and used a little less cornstarch since it tends to get too goopy. I also doubled the sauce and stir fried the broccoli separate in some sesame  oil then added it to the chicken when it was close to finished. The results were great, my husband has decided we won't need to order take out anymore!

Great dish!  I used Ponzu sauce instead of the oyster and soy sauce because I did not have it on hand.  I also did not used bok choy. Instead I added green onions, a can of water chestnuts and baby corn (canned).  We loved it!

Ehhh.  This was just so-so for us, as written.  I ended up adding quite a bit of extra seasoning to get it up to par with what my family is used to eating.  In fact, so much that I probably won't make this again without totally rewriting the recipe.  We just weren't impressed with this one.

Excellent recipe! Thanks for sharing. The only change I made in this to add more spice to it was slit two green chillies and also added a tsp of the siracha chilly sauce. It was yummy!

Not a bad recipe.  I don't think I used enough cornstarch, as the sauce didn't thicken much.  I didn't have oyster sauce but substituted teriyaki sauce instead.  I'd change the pepper and maybe add other spices, but we all liked it and will probably make it again.

Very good. Made this with store bought Vietnamese rice noodles. Added more oyster sauce and soy sauce to the rice noodles. Next time will take chicken out and cook vegetables and noodles. Then return the chicken at the end so that the chicken will not be overcooked.

Absolutely wonderful recipe.  Very easy.  Will definitely make again.  My husband was also a fan of this, saying it is the best meal I have ever made.

I am going to have my husband review this one.----For years I have been making "chicken szechuan" with basically this same recipe sans the corn starch. Tonight we realised we had no white rice (I like to use jasmine rice when making this) so had to do with brown rice. When she gave me the times on the recipe I knew it would bo be done much quicker so started the cooking at 12 miniutes before the rice was done. this is all the time it takes for this amount of chicken and veggies to be done on high. We tripled the sauce although didn't use the corn starch (the jasmine always soaks it up so nicely for leftovers).

Loved this!  I had fish sauce on hand so I used that instead of oyster sauce and I substitued sliced red bell pepper for the broccoli.  I also added sliced water chestnuts.  This recipe will be very adaptable to whatever ingredients I have in my pantry.

Excellent, only change was reducing the pepper by half per other user's suggestions.

Very good!  My 4 year old loved this!  I think it's a little too peppery.  I would make it with 1/2 tsp of pepper next time.

This recipe came out pretty good. I think the next time I make it I'll add more and different types of vegetables. Also I may substitute the white sugar for brown sugar. I've found that by substituting brown sugar for white sugar in sauces with soy sauce, it gives the sauce a richer flavor. But all-in-all a pretty good, healthy recipe.

I find that it is kind of hard to make good authentic asian-style food because the ingredients are often scarce to find. What I love about this recipe is that the ingredients are quite easy to find and meal in itself is delicious!

I can't believe how much this recipe tasted like authentic chinese take-out! It was so good and easy to make. I cut the broccoli in bigger chunks and used carrots also. Whole family thought it was delicious!
