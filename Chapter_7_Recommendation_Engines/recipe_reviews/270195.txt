Great. Loved it. Made is several times. First time I made it,  I increased everything by 1 1/2. Not necessary. This makes enough for 4 people with leftover. It was a little thicker the next day and just and good. Will keep making this without modifications.

Very bland, the Sweetened milk does not do the job. Next time I will skip the sweetened milk and substitute milk. Also, I will add sugar before cooking, maybe 1/2 to 3/4 cup.

My wife loves this recipe I make it for her at least twice a month.  I omit the raisins. She likes to add fresh blueberries or strawberries to pudding.

My rice turned to mush and the milk separated, but the family thought the flavor and sweetness were perfect. Next time, I'd combine this recipe with one that adds the milk after pressure cooking.

Turned out better than expected. Used coconut milk instead of whole milk. Mixed one egg with condensed milk at the end. I will probably tweek cooking time when I make next time.

This was really good, I topped each serving with half an half.  Not to sweet and made the perfect dessert.  Will make again.
