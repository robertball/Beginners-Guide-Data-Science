These were kid approved and good but not a typical chocolate chip cookie.... more so a tasty almond cookie with chocolate chips. I did run out of almond flour so had to sub in less than a cup of rice flour to make up the difference.

just for the cost of the almond flour i don't think i'd make these again.  they were okay though, a bit cakey but not bad.  also somehow i think they're more filling than regular cookies, i can have only a couple and feel pretty full.  all in all i'm glad i tried this recipe, thanks for sharing it with us.

Just like regular chocolate chip cookies. They're a little grainy and crumbly but still delicious.

Iâ€™ve made these several times from my almond milk cast off. They are fantastic- my friends keep asking me to make them!!
