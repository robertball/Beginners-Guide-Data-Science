This recipe was very easy to make.  It is pretty spicy, but I enjoy it that way.  The snapper was great.  I added about a pound of shrimp and some fresh         s to the recipe, and it worked great.  It was so good it made me want to slap my mama.  Since she lives out of town, I slapped my mother in law instead.

My husband claims this is the best jambalaya I've ever made (and I've made a few). We love seafood, so I added shrimp and calamari. Have tried it with red snapper and tilapia, good with either, but snapper was better. Also put in a little turkey polska kielbasa.

Since I dont know what the heck file powder is I didnt use it but I guess it didnt really need it because it was very tasty. I also used canned tomatoes and chicken broth. It was great, The only other change I made was to place the snapper filets on the top at the end to sort of poach it since I was afraid it would over cook.

Made this last night after searching the site for a red snapper recipe. Using a half recipe with one andouille sausage added with the vegetables, I followed suggestions to add the fish chunks late in the cooking and also included about 8 large thawed shrimp cut into thirds. Had Jambalaya made by a friend years ago, but this was a first try by me  -- and a keeper! Having the leftovers tonight, so it's really good. Thanks!

I made this recipe with high expectations because of it's five star rating.  I was making a surprise birthday dinner for my boyfriend and was really excited to try this (because he makes an excellent jambalaya himself).  I followed the recipe to the tee and by the time the hour simmer had passed, there were no fish bites left.  It had all dissolved into a pasty mess.  Thank goodness I had bought sausage or it would have just been a rice dish.  I was very sad :( and embarrassed to serve it.

This was a hit with my family, I used the snapper as called for and it was great. I didn't have the file spice and instead of mushroom stock used chicken stock that I had on hand, also didn't have brown rice so used Uncle Ben's long grain rice (just needs less time to cook than brown) Even with the changes this was delicious.

I added 1 cup water to the butter/flour mixture after it had formed the paste. I didn't add salt. At the end I also added about 10-15 pre cooked/peeled shrimp. The snapper was a great idea! It really holds up in this dish! A definate keeper. Thanks!

Excellent dish!  Takes some time, but is well worth it.  Super filling, delicious and soul warming.  TIP: pre-soak the brown rice overnight, and then drain before adding.  This makes it much quicker to cook, and easier to manage the amount of liquid in the dish.

This dish is fantastic! The flavors are warm and spicy, especially yummy when you add Tabasco sauce. Whenever I eat it, I feel like I am visiting a Cajun restaurant down South. My mind wanders to thoughts of verandas, mint juleps, and alligator filled swamps. I usually eat 2 or 3 bowls in one sitting.

My husband and I can't claim any louisiana roots, but we love to make cajun food, especially Jambalaya. This one is a great "base" to which you can add all sorts of things. We used jumbo shrimp and finely chopped sausage, with great results. The best thing about this base: the spices. I didn't add the file powder because I couldn't find it my grocery store, and we didn't miss it. The allspice is a really nice twist that works really well!

I did not have all the ingredients handy, so I had to improvise. I used plain ground beef, omitted the green onions, allspice, used one HUGE tomato, white rice, Tony Chacherie's spice blend, and dehydrated onions. It was wonderful!! At first I thought I burned the roux mixture, but it was perfect. Hubby loved this recipe and went back for thirds!! It was even better the next day (well, what was left). In order to keep the spice down for Hubby (heartburn) I put a packet of Taco Bell's FIRE sauce in my bowl (no disrespect to the recipe). Very tasty!! This one's going into rotation. :)

I didn't use snapper or mushroom stock.  I used andouille sausage, shrimp and chicken broth.  But the flavors of the jambalaya and texture of the rice were OUTSTANDING!  File powder is worth finding.  Excellent recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

With a few tweaks this turned out great, but I can't see how it would take an hour to cook the chunks of fish. I added mine (I used cod plus a few shrimp) about 20 mins towards the end of the cook time, and that was perfect. Other changes I made were to omit the file powder and ground cloves (didn't have any) and I used chicken broth instead of mushroom. Finally, I made the rice in the rice cooker then just poured the jambalaya over the top. Very tasty. Thanks!

Sorry Captain, but us Texans like it H-O-T!  Lol!  Although not hot enough for a Gulfcoast gal, it was delicious.  I used blue crab and shrimp instead of snapper and yummmmmmy!  I will most definitely make it again-it was very easy and fast to prepare.  Thanks for sharing!

This is an amazing recipe.  I followed the recipe closely except for the file powder(couldn't find it).  I added the red snapper in the last 30 minutes like others suggested and it came out perfect.  Thanks RKOZEL.

Even though I was the only one in my house who could handle the heat of this, I'm still going to give it five stars.  The heat can be controlled next time I make it if I wish to do so.  This was so good.  I couldn't believe how easy it was to make and how great the results were.  I've never made any kind of cajun food before, so I thought it would be a challenge.  It wasn't at all.  The taste was restaurant quality.  I will definitely make this over and over again!  YUMMY!

My husband can't get enough!  We love this recipe and eat it at least monthly--usually with sausage instead of the snapper.

This was very good.  I made changes based on what I had on hand - didn't have green bell pepper or green onions so I left them out, used Zatarain's creole seasoning in place of file powder, didn't have fish, used kielbasa, used chx broth instead of mushroom broth, white rice instead of brown, and used a  combination of fresh and canned tomatoes.  Served it with cornbread and a salad.  The amount of rice was more than I expected, but great nonetheless and I will definitely make this again.

Great recipe. Thanx! I (like some others) did not know what file powder was so I left it out. Also, I felt the the measurement for pepper and cayenne was too much for my taste so I more than halved what the recipe called for. And I used fish broth instead of mushroom. I, like another reviewer recommended, added the fish only at the end. I used fresh trout instead of snapper. The taste was out of this world! However, I would not recommend using fresh trout only b/c it is too difficult of a fish to fillet.

I am just learning how to cook and also improvise. After promising my fiancé Jambalaya I printed this recipe and went to the store. Too bad it was Sunday and they had closed the fresh fish section. I used the same base minus the file seasoning which I could not find. I added shrimp, imitation crab, flounder and sausage. I also realized that there was a lot more liquid than rice so added the entire bag. It came out delicious and my fiancé went back for seconds and even brought some to work—so either way the base seasoning of this recipe is fantastic with or without the Red Snapper.
