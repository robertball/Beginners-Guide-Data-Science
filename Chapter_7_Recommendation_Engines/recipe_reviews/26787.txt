This recipe provides a great "base" for your salsa but it does need to be modified to fit your tastes and preferences, especially if you like it chunky and not too spicy. But I found it very easy to modify as I went along.  I like a chunky, fresh looking salsa so I added 2 diced vine ripened tomatoes and only put a 14.5 oz. can of whole tomatoes instead of the 28 oz., and drained and reserved the fluid in case I needed it, but found it wasn't necessary (I still used the 10oz can which gave enough liquid).  I only put in one jalepeno pepper since I was making it for a crowd with various tastes, and I found the flavor was still very present.  And I cut down the onion to 1/2 and the garlic to 3 cloves, crushed. Then I added the juice of 1 lime and a small bunch of cilantro.  No blender for me! I just diced everything. Good stuff!

AWESOME!!!  After reading the other reviews, I added the juice of one small lime, one bunch finely chopped cilantro, doubled the canned tomatoes to 52 oz total, added two large fresh tomatoes and ten vine ripened cherry tomatoes, about three tablespoons of chopped green onion, used only 3 cloves garlic and only one jalapeno diced into a near paste.  Total quantity of salsa when I was done was 8 cups. Tortillas with lime were the vehicle of choice for the salsa (although I would eat it by the spoonful iif no one else was around)....so in conclusion it was YUMMY!

This is a really good recipe and much better than store bought salsa.  It is a spicy, but a good degree of spicy.  If you want to turn down the heat, decrease the jalepenos to 2 or seed the jalepenos after they cool down from roasting.  I would not omit the peppers because the roasted taste makes the salsa.  I have tried this recipe with less jalepenos and 'as is' because I was nervous it was going to be too spicy.  I highly recommend 'as is'.

This salsa is excellent - a little on the hot side (lesson learned) but pretty darn close to salsa  I've had in restaurants.  I cut this down to 12 servings and used (2) 14.5 oz. cans of diced tomatoes, one with green chile peppers and one without.  I love roasting the jalepeno pepper (next time I'll use only half of one that's what made it a little too hot).  I added some fresh lime juice,  cilantro, and doubled the amount of cumin.  I love the fact that you can make this as chunky as you like - much better than the jarred stuff.

I must admit, I was a bit skeptical of using canned tomato products in fresh salsa, but decided to give this a try.  Am I glad I did!  It is delicious, easy to make, and tastes just as good as the recipe I have used for yrs. that calls for fresh tomatoes!  I will make this often, probably weekly, being the salsa lovers my family is.  Please try this, it is yummy!!!

This was wonderful!  My boyfriend says "Mmmm mmmm good!"  We used Mexican style Rotel tomatoes with cilantro and lime, and one more jalapeno.  We are just raving at how good it was!

This is a very good salsa, however it is WAY too spicy and I only used three jalapeno peppers and I even took the seeds out.  Also I added cilantro, the juice of two limes, and I used fresh tomatoes, not then canned.  In addition, I  only used three garlic cloves.  Next time I try this, I will only use one jalapeno pepper.  Overall though it is a good recipe.

Wow, what a great base for a salsa.  I have tried several recipes and never gotten what I considered a "good" result.  I changed this a bit.  I added fresh cilantro to the food processor when blending.  Additionally, I omitted the Jalapeno peppers and substituted 2 fresh cayenne peppers from my garden - my wife loved it.

This was okay and makes way too much sauce not salsa.  If you're into hot & spicy, then the flavor of this recipe is for you.  If you like your salsa chunky, then this is not the recipe for you.  Although, this was very simple to make, it was not the hit of my party on Saturday.  Possbily could be the fact that I had 5 other appetizers and people went for the other dishes.  Going to have to play with this one before my next party in August.  Also, I agree with another reviewer and roasting the garlic might be a good idea.

I thought it was real good and my husband said it was the best homemade salsa he has ever had!  He also said it reminded him of the restaurant (Dos Amigos) salsa.  In fact, I am making it again tonight!  I altered the recipe a little bit though, I used 4 garlic cloves, added cilantro, and did not put sugar in it.  It was a bit hot, but I think it all depends on where the jalapenos come from, it does makes a difference if they are in a jar, can, or fresh.  Even the brand name makes a difference.  I think everyone owes this recipe a try!

This Fresh Salsa recipe contains too many canned
items to be considered fresh. I would have substituted fresh veggies and chiles. The use of
sugar is interesting...it counter-balances the
flavor. Use it, but only a half portion. I will
not make it my family's favorite, but in a pinch
it will do.

I used a whole 28 can of diced tomatoes and instead of the diced tomatoes with green chilies, I used one can diced mild green chilies instead. I also upped the cumin to a heaping teaspoon. This was my first time roasting peppers but it really was cake--I really worried over nothing. (For you novices, be cautious when working with the jalapeno peppers. Use nitrile (ex: non-latex) surgical gloves and don't touch anything near your face until the gloves are off and your hands are washed--I learned this the hard way the first time I ever cooked with jalapeno peppers.) Very spicy but that's how I like it. I think the only thing I was missing was a shot of lime juice.

This is an excellent recipe!  The only thing I did different was to drain the whole tomatoes, as we prefer a "thicker" salsa and I only used 2 jalapenos after reading all the reviews.  DH took a double batch with him to work today and it was gone within 2 hours!  Plus I got several requests for the recipe.  Thank you for posting this superb recipe!

This has possibilities, but my first attempt following the recipe exactly was WAY to spicy for us.  This also makes a lot.  Next time, I will make a half batch and use only 1 jalapeno.

This was AWESOME!  I was very skeptical about the canned tomatoes (I usually use fresh tomatoes only for salsa), but it tasted very fresh.  I followed some of the suggestions on the site and added 2cans Rotel and only a small can of whole tomatoes.  I also added 3 fresh tomatoes, lime juice, and pepper.  I used frozen chopped jalepenos from last years garden and didn't roast them.  It was so easy and cheap I don't think I'll ever buy jarred salsa again.  THANKS!!!!

This was great!! The first time I have been satisfied with a salsa I made! I used 2 cans of rotel instead of the whole tomatoes and added a little lime juice. I am also a huge fan of cilantro so I added lots of it! If your not a big fan of garlic, I suggest not using 5 cloves.

This was a good salsa, buy way too hot with 4 jalapenos, even if you take the seeds out.  I had to make another batch without jalapenos and mix the two together.  Then I had so much of it so I used it to make Hot Mexican Spinach Dip from this site, and it worked great.  Quesadillas also taste great with fresh salsa.

I loved this!  Changed a little:  used a 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes with green chilies, 4 fresh roma tomatoes, and 2 tbsp tomato paste.  I also added a bit of cilantro and lime juice.

This had an unusual blend of flavors. I didn't really like the sweetness that much. With all the canned tomoatoes, it also wasn't really "Fresh" as described in the title. I think it would have been better with less sugar, less jalapenos, some cilantro, and fresh tomatoes.

this salsa is a hit. Every where I take it I'm asked for the recipe.  I even use the pickled jalapenos when I just want to throw this together fast and it has great taste.  Also can vary the hotness by using different hotness of rotel.  The best and easiest salsa I've ever made.  Often told that it is better than the salsa you get in authentic mexican resturants!  Note: At the end of the summer I pick all of my jalapenos that I have in the garden and char them in the oven, then just pop them in the freezer and they are ready for the winter.

Too much onion and just was not great. Maybe it was the tomatoes I used. Slim pickings at the market.

I make a different salsa every week during the football season and take to a local pub. I made about a gallon of this last week and it was all gone. I did drain tomatoes and added juice as I needed. Also added more peppers. Easy to make.

This recipe is okay, but not great.  I don't know exactly what is wrong with it, but there is a funny taste to the liquid part, maybe because the tomatoes are canned. 

That said, I think 4 whole jalepenos would only be appropriate for someone who REALLY likes things HOT.  My husband and I do, but I only put in one because I did not have four, and it was definitely a medium salsa with just one.  Also, 5 garlic cloves seems like a lot.  I am the biggest garlic fan going, but remember that this garlic is raw.  I put in three and it was almost overpowering.

I added black beans and corn to mine, and like the flavor they added.

Excellent!  I'd give 5 more stars if I could. I did make one or two changes; reduced garlic to 2 cloves, my onion was fairly small so used all,  added juice of 1 lime because I had ONE lime in a use it or lose it mode and used only 2 jalapeno peppers which I seeded and deveined.  I cannot tolerate cilantro under any circumstances and this is one of the very few recipes I've found for salsa not using it.  TY for not even suggesting it! I pulsed tomatoes but left them in a nearly chunky state.  This is really good, easy to prepare and even my grandkids, 8 to 16, loved it.  Heat was just right for all of us.  Can't go wrong with this one.

Sounds very tasty! A few minor suggestions: 1) Reserve the cilantro until just before serving, then chop on your cutting board and stir in for a brighter flavour, and a less "muddy" appearance; 2) For a more mild flavour, seed the jalapenos before chopping; 3) DRAIN the tomatoes before adding to your mixing bowl, but reserve the juice in case it is too thick for your preferences; 4) wrap the garlic in foil, with a drizzle of good olive oil and roast along with the jalapenos.

The definition of "fresh" is not cooked. Canned tomatoes work so well in salsa. They are picked at the peak of ripeness. DUH Grocery store tomatoes have no taste. To cut the heat take out the seeds and veins. The jalapeno's I have been getting are very mild. I also would add lime and culantro.

Great, spicy salsa.  The only change I made was to use a can of diced tomatoes and then to add in some green chiles separately.  This was great with our tortilla chips as well as on our enchiladas.

Way, way, WAY too much onion. I backed it down to half and it was still way too much. I added another teaspoon of cumin and some cilantro and more salt. I left out the sugar. It was edible, but I will definitely tweak it even more next time!

Hmm…. I was really hoping for a restaurant salsa, but this was not it. This salsa was very very hot, so I would recommend cutting down the peppers, if you like fire sauce however leave the peppers. I just have a sensitive mouth =). The salsa was ok; it might be better as a condiment salsa, and not one to be eaten with chips. The salsa lacked tomato flavor and then when I added some it still was missing something. I would recommend this salsa to someone who will tinker with it adding items to make it better. It is a good start just not quite there yet.

I liked this a lot.  I removed the veins and seeds from the peppers and also added about 1/2 cup of fresh chopped cilantro.

I followed some of the reviews and used 3 jalapenos instead of 4 because I didn't want it to be too spicy. I regret that. Next time I make it I will use what the recipe calls for, 4. Also, next time I'll use less sugar than is called for. I found it to be a little too sweet.

Excellent! This recipe was so delicious. I made it for my family and for my boyfriend and everybody liked it. However, if the jalapenos are in season, watch out! I only had to use three and it was spicy for even my mom (who eats habaneros whole)! Put in two peppers, then add one at a time based on your taste. You can always add them, but you can never take them out.

This is a great base salsa recipe, I've been making this for two years now at least.

I always add cilantro, and lime juice. I add two cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles, and then adjust the # of whole tomatoes I add to get to the desired consistency.  Then I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours so all the flavors can mix.

My husband (and everyone I've made this for) raves about it.  I hardly ever buy the jar stuff anymore, and usually keep cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles on hand to make this.

When I made this I added cilantro, lime juice and cut the sugar a little.  I also reserved the liquid from both cans of tomatoes, then added as needed.  It worked perfectly!! I think the next time I may add one more jalapeno.  We like it hot!!! Thanks so much for this recipe!!

This is a great recipe.  I did add some cilantro though.  I used only two jalapenos and it wasn't enough.  I also used crushed tomatoes in place of the whole tomatoes and i would not suggest it.  As my manager at work said, it tastes more like pizza sauce than salsa!  A problem that would have been remedied by following the ingredients.  I will certainly try this again.

I think the four jalapenos were necessary.  I would however cut down on the garlic.  I left out the whole tomatoes and used a total of three cans of petite diced tomatoes.

This recipe was very good because it was simple and tasted very good.  However, I strongly recommend that you take down the garlic a lot.  5 cloves of raw garlic is way too much.  I love garlic, but 5 cloves is very rough.  However, I totally recommend that you try the recipe. Also, I used 3 jalapenos peppers and got rid of the seeds and it still had a nice amount of heat. Finally, I drained the canned whole tomatoes, and the recipe was definitely not too thick.  Can't wait to tinker with this recipe more to find the perfect salsa. I think roasting the garlic is where I am going to start. EL.

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday and it got great reviews!!! The only difference was that I used 2 jalapeno's instead because my 8 year old son would be eating it as well. Talk about addicting, this salsa was. We used the leftovers for topping our omelets the next morning. Absolutely delicious salsa!!

Finally!  This recipe is definitely a winner... but I prefer chunky salsa, so instead of blending, we diced all of the ingredients and simmered them together over low heat in a saucepan for 20-30 min.  We added 2 tbsp. cilantro, too.  Very good.

This was a huge hit at our house. My husband loves salsa and said this is one of the best ones we have had yet. I will be trying to make one with not so much heat by seeding the jalapeños next time.

I sliced the jalapeno lenthwise and took out the seeds before I roasted them. I though the salsa had too much garlic.  To make up for the garlicy taste I added about 10 ounces of canned black beans. My husband thought it was very good.

Tastes like salsa from a good mexican restaurant! Made 3 batches of this in less than 1 week! I did cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp and added a little fresh lime juice. It is spicy, but not over the top. I will never buy store bought salsa again!

In whoever's recipe's defense, maybe I put too much garlic but I thought I put 5 cloves. THERE IS WAY TOO MUCH GARLIC. Also, I noticed D's Salsa recipe has more reviews and also includes lime and cilantro which I think might be missing from here. Will get salsa from Mexican restaurant in the future.

This is a great recipe.  If you don't like heat you will want to cut down on the jalapeno, but we like things hot.  It becomes a little watery after being frozen but it still maintains a good flavor.

I didn't care for this at all. It tasted more like tomato sauce than salsa. To add flavor, I had to add a can of diced green chilis, more garlic, more cumin and more salt. I really not like this at all. I think if I would have left out the 28 oz can of whole tomatoes, it probably would have been perfect.

This salsa was so good and very easy to make.  I just wish it had a little more heat (I like things hot).  I took out the seeds to the jalapenos and next time I would leave at least 2 with seeds.  It has a sweet and spicy flavor.  I left out the cumin because I did not have any and I didn't miss it.

Well I have been to quite  few Mexican restaurants. I have always been looking for the recipe chip dip that was just like this. I can't believe it,  Thank you. I did add a few things  from my garden like 4 Fresh Jalapenos, and 8 - 10 Culantro leaves (just like Cilantro). I also had to buy a small can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos inside they looked to good to pass up and a large regular can of diced tomatoes,plus the juice from 2 key limes. everything in the blender after the roasting, and bam all done.  Thank you.  Oh it was a bit too spicy hot for the wife so she diluted it with  regular diced tomatoes and enjoyed it  with Tostitos

Overall, this salsa was pretty great.  The best I've made from home.  I did reduce the jalapeno to only 3.  Next time, I will greatly reduce the sugar or leave it out alltogether.  My husband and I both agreed it was way too sweet.

I hate to give this recipe 4 stars, but I come from California where we practically eat salsa for breakfast. I used 2 jalapeno peppers and it wasn't spicy enough for me. I added cilantro and a bit of lime, but it was still missing something. I will keep this recipe and use it as a base but maybe next time I will use habaneros?? Totally munching on this salsa right now!

This salsa recipe is excellent.  My family absolutely loves it! I use a 28 oz. can of petite diced tomatoes and a 4 oz. can of diced jalapenos, along with the other items from the recipe, and it comes out perfect every time.  I also drain most of the juice from the cans, because we like our salsa a little chunkier.  Delicious!

Made as is except only used 3 serrano chilies, added cilantro and decreased sugar to 1tsp. Everything else was the same! Was so easy to do in the food processor.  Whole family loved it. My 16 year old said it was my best salsa yet- he liked it better than my fresh tomato salsa. I doubt I'll ever use fresh tomatoes again!

Wow this is restaurant quality! I used 3 cloves, 1/2 onion, pinch of sugar, Hot Rotel, juice of one lime, and a hand full of cilantro. This is super spicy, but that's exactly how I like my salsa! For those of you who like your mouth to burn, this recipe is for you! But I also used HOT Rotel, which kicked it up a noch.

This is a wonderful Salsa recipe.  Better than mine which uses fresh tomatoes.  I did add the juice of a lime and some fresh cilantro to taste.  I cut back to 2 teaspoons of sugar.  Next time I might use 2-3 jalapeno's instead of 4 for a slightly less spicy taste. Thanks Kaylene!

Very good stuff... I added lime juice, Chopped green onion, & Cilantro. 4 peppers is pretty hot... But I like it hot... Roasting the peppers is a must do... Great flavor. Thank's Kaylene!!!

We love this recipe!  The only changes I made was to use 3/4 can of crushed tomatoes instead of peeled whole tomatoes and added a drained can of tomatoes with onion and garlic.  Will definitley make it again!

This was a great recipe! I did make a few modifications. I took the suggestions of other reviewers and added a large handful of chopped fresh celentro and the juice of half a lime. To fit my families tastes I only used 2 jalapenos, 3 cloves of garlic and half the sugar. Also, I did not put this in the blender. I hand chopped all of the ingredients for a chunky, less watery salsa. Next time I will probably used diced tomatoes instead of the whole ones. None the less, this turned out great.

This was good.  I roasted all four jalapenos with the intention of adding one at a time until it was to my liking.  I ended up only adding two - seeds removed.  I don't like my salsa too hot (I like to pile it on) and this was perfect.  After pouring into a bowl, I added a large handful of chopped cilantro and the juice of half of a lime, which really helped with the freshness factor.

This is fantastic, I had to reduce the amount of Jalapenos down to 2 and cut back the garlic to 2 or 3 cloves. My wife loves it so much she said that she doesn't need chips, she could just drink it from the jar. I do prefer not to process it to a liquid as I like Salsa to be a little chunky.

This is amazing! Don't change a thing. I added the chopped tomatoes at the very end and pulsed it to leave it a bit more chunky. The jalepenos give it a kick without being too hot.

Very good salsa, but I added cilantro, fresh lime juice, fresh tomotoes, and some pepper.  That is what most before me had said.  Mine was VERY spicy though, both times I made it, but was good for us!  Thanks!

It is really hard to find a great salsa recipe.  My daughter made this and although she added a few too many peppers, it was wonderful.  We made it in a blender so it was pretty smooth.  I have finally found a salsa recipe that I will make again.

I love this stuff!  It was a huge hit at a party I recently attended- I made a double batch and it was gone in less than one hour and I had requests for the recipe.  I did make it less spicy by adding a different type of diced canned tomatoes.  I found some that had the green chilis but were mild or I have made it using the "mexican style" diced tomatoes which are also less spicy.  Reducing the jalepenos did not reduce the heat and but did cut back the good roasted flavor so if you don't like it hot- the key is to change out the diced tomatoes for a milder blend.  This is great for winter when fresh tomatoes cannot be had!

I have never made homemade salsa in my life. After reviewing numerous recipes on this site, I decided to give it a try. I did not follow any one recipe. I instead made my own recipe based on reviewing the many different styles on this site. I used 1 30oz can of whole skinned tomatoes, 2 10oz cans of rotell (sic) diced tomatoes and green Chilli peppers, 1 small jalapeño pepper withsseed pod removed, 1 small red pepper with seed pod removed, 1 small yellow onion, 1 small purple onion, 3 full gloves of garlic, 3 small limes, 2 cups of cilantro, 2 tablespoons of salt, and 1 teaspoon of sugar. I chopped the onions, peppers  and the garlic. Mixed in bowl all the ingredients after draining the tomatoes. I then spoon feed the salsa in a chopper until it reached a smooth consistency. My wife loves it and I may have to make it all the time. 
Made about 1 gallon of salsa.

It's been a few years since posting this recipe. I lived in a "produce challenged" area at the time... the reason for using canned tomatoes. Yes, drain them. I agree 5 peppers can be too hot. Glad many find this a great base.

I ALWAYS add at least 1/2 bunch of fresh cilantro or it just isn't homemade salsa!! When I want it chunkier, I use a large can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the whole and only add 1/3 of the can to the blender. Then I add the remainder of the can after blending all the other ingredients. I don't think there is any need bake the jalapenos. And 4 could definitely be a little much depending on your taste and how hot the peppers are.

I absolutely loved the flavor of this salsa! The only problem I ran in to was it was too hot to eat at first. I seeded two of the pepper but left two with seeds. I would not recommend doing that, and I am a lover of hot food. I was able to fix the problem by added more sugar 
(~ 3tbsp) and some vinegar. It didn't make the salsa sweet, but did help with the heat. Also this recipe makes a TON of salsa so be prepared!

This is one of the best recipes I have found. Quick easy and adaptable. I like a lot of the reviewers added cilantro and can take or leave the lime juice. I did add more jalepenos and enjoy it with the roasted peppers, but I boil mine to squeeze more heat out of them. Not as much smoky flavor but a lot more heat. Thanks Kaylene good job.

I think that 5 cloves is to much garlic that's all I could taste but other than that it was fantastic I used habaneros instead of green chilies very yummy just less garlic

Loved this salsa!  I used 3 jalapeno peppers and   1 anaheim pepper.  Only used 4 cloves of garlic, and 3/4 of a large onion.  The rest is exactly like the recipe.  Next time, I'll try roasting the garlic with the peppers.

This salsa is FABULOUS!  I have made it so many times and it is always great and I get tons of compliments.  The one thing I will say is that I would deseed the jalapeno's.  There have been a couple times when I have made this and it was too hot with the seeds. Other than that the recipe is perfect.  Thanks so much for sharing, because now I can make a salsa better than most restaurants!!

The first time I made this salsa, I made it 'as is', with two exception - for the roasted jalapenos, i fire roasted them on the stove (i have a gas stove) and I added a can of corn for color. Everyone loved it! The only thing I didn't like was that it was very soupy and the food processor didn't leave any chunkiness to the salsa that I personally love.  The second time around, I used fresh tomatoes in place of the canned, added lime juice and cilantro (like many of the other reviewers) and hand chopped everything -which can be time consuming)- and I let it sit overnight to let the flavors blend.  Hands down one of the best salsa recipes I've used - and I get asked to make it for parties a lot.

this is one awesome salsa! easy to make too, what's not to like?! :) the only thing that i did different was to not add as much garlic, 2 or 3 was enough. a nice suggestion would be to add a hint of lime juice and maybe some fresh, chopped cilantro. this is definitely one of the best salsas i have ever tasted. thank you!

Hey !!! This recipe is killer!!! I made a double batch cause salsa just doesnt last long around my house. The improvisions I made were that I only used 3 peppers per batch and after smoking them in the oven I cut 3 of them in half and scraped out the seeds and the inside splines. And then I added a bundle of cilantro to the mix and blended. Lol, my son took some to school and some friends and teachers swore up and down the salsa was from a local mexican restruant. Also a bit of info for others..... if you use everything called for and you find it too hot, just add a bit more sugar until it is cooled down enough for you. You can always add another can of tomatoes or a couple extra fresh tomatoes but no too much cause you doen't want it too tomatoy

This is a very good recipe, however if you rather have a milder salsa BEWARE! Only use maybe 2 jalepenos. I probably should have de-seeded the peppers and that would have brought it down a notch, but WOW! It's got a kick which my hubbie loves.

I made this to go along with the Texas Chicken Quesdillas, but due to a power outage, quite a bit of it went to tortilla chips. It was very garlic-y to me, but my family loved it. Next time I won't use all four jalepenos; it was VERY hot, even after adding a can of plain diced tomatoes. It was still so good that my family toughed it out even through the fire! I also substituted garlic powder for cloves, and at the advice of other reviews, added fresh cilantro and lime juice.

Awesome salsa!!!  The only change I made was adding some fresh tomato and cutting the canned tomatoes in half, and I also added a little lime juice.  My husband took the leftovers to work and it was gone within minutes!  Excellent - thank you!!!!!!!!!

Very good salsa, but hot as written!  It's burning my tongue as I type this.  I added 1/2 bunch of cilantro & lime juice and I think that it would have been a lot more bland without it.  Still very good though!

Not a bad salsa recipe, but I have a couple suggestions: 1) add some fresh cilantro. About 1/2 a bunch. 2) After blending everythihng together, add a couple of hand-chopped tomtoes for texture. 3) Add some lime juice: about a teasooon. Otherwise, a nice salsa for chip!

WAY too much garlic! I'm not sure if my bowl will ever stop smelling like garlic. And even though I didn't have it in the blender for long, there weren't any tomato chunks. It was more like a sauce instead of a salsa.

This was a good salsa recipe.  I don't think I want to use a blender in the future, because I like my salsa to have chunks of vegetables in it.  The blender made the salsa very liquidly, almost like taco sauce.  I added some cilantro, and sugar.  The next day, it was actually better.  4 jalapeno peppers made it very, very, hot.  I will only use 2 next time.

This recipe was great! I did use only 2 peppers (plenty hot).  I also added some roasted red peppers, cilantro, lime juice and I drained the liquids from the canned items for a thicker product. I have made it several times and people love it!! This is now a household staple!

Great salsa!  My husband and I both loved it.  It was a bit too hot for me, 
so when I pour myself a bowl I mix in some homemade ranch dressing and it 
tastes incredible!  I couldn't find a 10 oz can of diced tomatos with green chilis 
so I bought a 14 oz can of diced tomatos and a 2 oz can of chopped green 
chilis.  It worked!  Next time, if I want to tone it down, I will only roast 
2 jalapenos instead of 4.

This was a good salsa, but very very hot using 4 jalepenos.  To try to cool it down I added a bunch of cilantro and an extra can or two of tomatoes.  I served it at a party and everyone loved it.

very tasty.  i added more garlic and a tad more cumin.  i think the addition of cilantro would have made it even better.  super fast.  needs a bit of time for the flavors to mix, but otherwise, two thumbs up

This is an okay salsa recipe.  I was looking for the "perfect salsa" recipe, and this one misses the mark.  It's definitely lacking something, and it is more spicy than flavorful.  I probably won't make it again.

Great salsa!  You'll never need to buy salsa again w/ this stuff.  I recommend draining the canned food items before processing if you don't want your salsa to be too runny

I am from the southwest and my family is pretty picky about salsa (a staple at almost all meals), but they love this!  It truly tastes like you used all fresh ingredients.  I didn't roast my peppers; I chopped (fewer) pickled jalapeno slices and added roasted red & green peppers for roasted flavor (in a jar from produce section of store) - it tasted great! Took this to one of my teenage son's functions - they have requested I bring it each time.

i skip the sugar and add lots of fresh cilantro! I've made it so many times, I think I just throw lots of onions, tomatoes and cilantro in the food processor, some jalapenos and a bit of garlic! DELICIOUS!!! I have never been able to eat jar salsa since I got this recipe 2+ years ago!(makes for some bad breath...so eat with the ones you love!!)

This recipe is really great and very easy - I used jalapenos without roasting them and it was still really good.  And, if you add some of this salsa to a mashed up avacado and a splash of lemon juice, it makes great guacamaole!

I searched around for a Salsa recipe on several sites, and decided to try this one.  It came out fantastic, and very easy to make.  
It's a great recipe for guests.

Excellent! We used less jalepenos and garlic from the recommendation of other reviews. We added a green pepper to make up for the loss of the jalepenos. Amazing! :)

It is a 5 star, but I gave it a 4 because you can make this a lot easier.
One can of tomatoes with green chiles, chopped onion, cilantro and squeeze of lime and you are done. It is chunkier and easier.

This was a really nice, spicy salsa. I tend to like my salsa pretty chunky so next time, I think I'll chop some of the veggies myself and mix into it the tomatoes after they're pulsed. Otherwise, excellent salsa.

This recipe was amazing! Very spicy but very good! My husband said it was the best salsa he's ever had. We used the food processor. The blender made it too liquidy last time we made it. We added the juice of half a lime and a handful of cilantro as others suggested. It was great. We will be making it often.

I would give this 3 and a half stars if I could. Talk about spicy! Maybe my jalapenos were crazy hot, but I had to add an additional can of tomatoes to tone down the heat. I also feel like something is missing. Maybe cilantro, lime juice, green pepper... some other element of flavor. It wasn't a total waste though, we just doubled up on the tortilla chips. I do like the fact that I knew exactly what was going into my salsa, meaning there were no preservatives or other funny things.

I have to admit I rarely make things according to the directions. This is an excellent base recipe. That said here are some changes I would make (and have):  Instead of the canned tomatoes I used about 5 mediums tomatoes to broil on the baking sheet with the garlic and about 7 - 9 diced fresh tomatoes after I pureed the broiled yumminess. Then I add 1 -3 T of olive oil (sorry to be so vague, but i know the consistancy I am looking for, Instead of sugar I use honey and I throw it all in a blender. Then I add 10 scallions and use the pulse butten to get I finer consistancy. Once I'm done with this I throw it all in a big bowl where I have placed a couple of dashes of nutmeg, 2 cups finely cut fresh cilantro, 1/4 cup fresh lime juice and the zest of 4 limes. Sometimes I season it with pepper. There it remains for several hours. This is a great make ahead recipe that I wind up canning and giving as party gifts every year. YIPPEEE!!

This is wonderful as a base, but I changed some things.  I added cilantro, lime juice, and cut the onion to 1/2 an onion.  I also added a little more jalopeno and now it is truly 5 stars!  I can stop my search for the perfect salsa recipe now.  Thanks!

This salsa is great. I only used one hot pepper due to having 4 kids that don't do well with spicy. It still had some spice to it. The only changes I made to this was just used one hot pepper out of the garden and fresh tomato's out of the garden. Thanks for such a good recipe I will make this all the time.

I'd never made fresh salsa, but wanted to try it for a Cinco de Mayo party I was hosting.  Not only was I pleasantly surprised with how easy it was, but I - and my friends - loved this salsa!  It's a very nice, smooth, medium-spicy salsa.  You can taste the jalapenos, but it doesn't set your mouth on fire.  However, if you don't like spicy, you will probably not like this recipe as it is written.  As for me, I will definitely be making this again - and again and again!

This recipe is great, we added some lime juice and zest, cilantro, and chopped mango.  This really added a lot of extra flavor and is perfect on chips.  People are always requesting that we make it for them.

This is by far the best recipe ever for Salsa.  My friends from Mexico love it.  I do add a bit of Chipotle Peppers for a smokey taste, but even when I do not have them, it's still the best recipe.  So easy and goes quick!

This is very good!  I reduced the recipe to make about half the servings of the original recipe.  I omitted the canned whole tomatos and used only 2 cans of mild canned tomatos and green chilis, drained. (I can't imagine using the hot rotel AND adding jalapenos!) I added 3 roasted jalapenos with seeds, 1 small onion, 1 large garlic clove, a big handful of cilantro, juice from 1 lime, sugar, salt and just a pinch of cumin and gave it a couple of whirls in the blender and refridgerated overnight.  Yum!  The salsa was still very hot, which I like, but you may want to use only one or 2 jalapenos.  This is my salsa recipe from now on!

Used fresh tomatoes from the garden, and cut the jalepenos in half (we have young kids who don't like it too spicy).  Loved it and will definitely make a again.

Brilliant! I was a bit turned off by the colour and texture of the salsa when it first came out of the blender. After it settled in the fridge for a while, I was more used to it. The secret is definately in roasting the jalapenos. I used an extra one and the spiciness is perfect! I used 3 fresh tomatoes instead of the canned peeled ones as suggested by a reviewer. This is much better than anything I could find at the store!

This was very good.  I took it to a party and everyone loved it.  I only put in 4 garlic cloves and 2 peppers and used 3 real tomatoes instead of the canned peeled tomatoes.  Thanks for the post.

This was great! We used jarred jalapenos and made two different levels of spiciness. My husband prefers chunkier salsa (we used the blender) but the taste was excellent.

This Salsa was good but it tasted like something was missing. I added some extra salt and some cilantro but it still wasn’t quite right. I will try this Salsa again but next time I will definitely use fresh tomatoes.

I have never really followed a recipe for anything.  I had a great time shopping for the ingredients... this salsa is soooooo good!  My husband and I loved it.  I took it to work the following day and all my co-workers raved over it!!!

Even better than what the most well-known mexican restaurants serve!  Just the right amount of everything an addicting chip salsa needs.  You'll get great feedback from a crowd with this one!

I thought this was a good starter recipe but a bit bland. I added 1/2 cup chopped cilantro. I drained the tomatoes as one reviewer recommended. I didn't think the recipe had much flavor so next time I'll add an additional tsp of salt and probably substitute canned tomatoes for fresh roma tomatoes.

I thought that the heat on this recipe was great. Just the right amount of heat from the jalapenos, but the flavor of the whole dish was weak. It tasted far too tomatoey, and this may have been because I used the canned tomatoes the recipe called for. If using the canned tomatoes, I'd suggest draining them (which the recipe did not call for). Other than that, I added cilantro as well, but this still didn't give it enough flavor for my liking.

Our family is VERY picky about mexican food, especially salsa.  We LOVED this salsa and will continue to make.  I added lime juice and cilantro and only used 3 jalepenos that I removed the seeds from.

I made this for a party, and it was a hit.  I used diced fresh plum tomatoes instead of canned diced tomatoes and did not add any salt (we are on a low sodium diet).  I also added a quarter cup of chopped cilantro.  The result was a tasty and hot tortilla topper.  My guests loved it!

Excellent fresh restaurant flavor. I would use only 2 cloves in this recipe, as even 4 was overwhelming. Also a small bunch of cilantro adds that finishing touch. We can't get enough of this stuff!

This was a big hit @ Bunko. I did add lemon and little more cumin and cilantro. But for myself I added 8 jalapenos. Hotter the better. My husband loved it. It was really yummy.. Thanks

I've been trying to re-create a salsa that is served in Mexican restaurants and this is even better!!!  I also made guacamole and put a little of this salsa in it and it was wonderful!!  The only thing that I would add to this recipe is chopped cilantro to give it that authentic taste.  Thanks for the great recipe Kaylene!

I also added some cilantro and lime jucie.  This is an excellent "hot" salsa, but I highly recommend using less jalapeno if you are faint of heart.  I tossed this with some hot pasta and grated cheese and it was excellent; a nice "al fresco" sauce for these summer months.

Best salsa recipe I've ever had (and I'm picky about salsa).  I remove the seeds from the jalapeno to make a milder salsa.  Great for all your salsa needs.  Refrigerate overnight for an even better flavor.  When you have leftovers, it's excellent in eggs the next morning.

This is great salsa!!!  I omitted the cummin and added cilantro & lime juice.  I also cut the peppers to 3 and the garlic to 2.  Everyone in my family loves this!  I am assigned to bring this to every family gathering now! My husband & I recently ate a great Tex-Mex restaurant and the salsa there tasted exactly like mine! DELICIOUS!!!

Maybe too spicy for kids, but GREAT for us! 
From barefooting's husband: I love very spicy foods, so I add an extra 1/2 tsp of cumin and two serrano peppers, and I use the extra hot rotel diced chiles and tomatoes. about 1/2 to 1 full bunch of cilantro also works very well in this salsa.

This is one of those recipes that's easily adaptable for any family.  I did just that.  I've made this recipe (or rather a hybrid of this recipe) more times than I can count.  I'm just now getting around to writing this review.  I've subtracted and added items to this recipe, and now I've got one that's uniquely our family's.  I thank you, Kaylene for such a fabulous recipe that allowed us to find the perfect one for us.

I have made this several times now.  I took it to work and everyone raved, had to bring the recipe in the next day.  The only thing I add is chopped cilantro.  I like that you can adjust the consistency with adding or not using all the juice from the canned tomatoes.  A truly great salsa recipe.

I LOVED this recipe...so did my husband. We eat a LOT of Mexican food and have been looking for a good salsa recipe for years!  I made this a little milder for my son, but it was still very flavorful!  I also added two roma tomatoes and I roasted the peppers, tomatoes and garlic for a little added flavor. I will make this one time and time again!

The roasted veggies really make this salsa good. It also made my home smell wonderful! I added 1 bunch of chopped cilantro and the juice of 1 lime. I also roasted not only the peppers but the tomatoes and the garlic as well. It was very yummy and authentic.

Great EASY Salsa!  Sweet and spicy (watch the sugar amount-any more and it will be too sweet) All it needs is a little cilantro and PERFECT!  Just like in the Tex-Mex restaurants!  Love it and so did the entire family! Suzanne

Best salsa we've ever had.  To save time, I put all ingredients in a blender and I didn't roast the peppers. Just blip the throttle on the blender a few times.  I used a 10oz can of hot RoTel. WOW! (drain the water from RoTel)

This is an EXCELLENT easy to make salsa!  I used 8 jalapeno's and added lots of garlic to mine and everyone just loves it (even my 2 year old)!  Thanks for the terrific recipe! It's a keeper!

I needed to make something quick with ingredients I had on hand... and this fit the bill perfectly. I made a few substitutions:  I didn't roast the jalepenos (in the interest of time) and I used canned tomatoes from my summer garden.  Also, I added a handful of cilantro.  The cilantro darkened the overall color, but the flavor was awesome.  It reminded me of the salsa I get an an authentic Mexican cafe in my neighboorhood.  Very good.

Not sure about the "fresh" part but this was good. I eliminated the sugar and used diced tomatoes with habaneros.

I decided to make salsa because my husband and father love to eat salsa and chips and we have a billion and one jalapeno peppers. They absolutely loved this recipe and demanded that I make more!

This recipe is AMAZING!  I used serrano peppers instead of jalapenos, because I like their flavor and heat level better than jalapeno.  I only used 2 cloves of garlic, because I didn't want it to be to garlicky.  I increased salt to 1 1/2 tsp and decreased cumin to about 1/8 tsp.  I do want to say though, that I'd be willing to bet the recipe was great as is, but I always like to tweak things to my taste, and it was great!

Fabulous salsa!!  I've been making this for about 3 years now and everytime I do my family raves about it. We do like it spicy so I had as many as needed for our taste. Very comparable if not better than restaurant salsa.

This recipe was why I bought a food processor!  I make this all the time - whether for using in veggie chili, or just for some chips.  Here's how I adjusted:

I added a small bunch of cilantro as well as about a teaspoon of lime juice.  I tried using 5 cloves of garlic as noted in the recipe, but that seemed way too garlicky - and I love garlic.  Instead I'd reccommend using no more than 3 cloves, or roasting 5 cloves with the jalapenos.  Thanks for the recipe!

I make this salsa all the time and everyone loves it! I do cut down the sugar to 1tsp and only add 2 jalapenos since I'm making it for a crowd.(It still gives it a nice kick)If I have fresh tomatoes I substitute them for the can of peeled ones. Also I add the juice of 1 lime and some cilantro. Perfect everytime and easily modified to suit your taste.

Really easy and tasty for a few "need now" salsa.  I am taking mine to work tomorrow and I had the ingredients at home, minus a few peppers.  I just added a few cherry peppers marinated in olive oil, and it was nice and spicy. I will definately keep making this recipe because it is easy to substitute ingredients and be salsa ready at any time.

This salsa was much too "tomatoey" for my taste. I ended up adding some lime and oregano to help tone down the tomato taste. I'll keep looking to find an authentic Mexican salsa.

A great base, though a little to hot for my buds.  Even though the tomatoes are canned, the flavor is nothing but fresh.  This came out better than recipes that I have made with fresh tomatoes.  This is probably the best place to start for a salsa recipe. The best thing about salsa is making it your own!

This is the best salsa recipe.  I made the following changes for my family.  Reduced jalapenos to 2, used 1/2 the liquid from the whole peeled tomatoes, added the juice from 1 lime, added 2 tablespoons pureed chipolte peppers in adobo sauce, added 1 cup chopped fresh cilantro.  Perfect.

Always a winner. I like it CHUNKIER - How I mix it makes a big difference. After I roast the jalapenos I seed them & put them in the blender with the whole tomatoes DRAINED (usually San Marzano), sugar, garlic, cumin and salt. When this appears blended I add a coarsly chopped sweet onion and blend slightly. Then I add two cans of DRAINED tomatoes with green chile peppers and stir by hand. Chill for a few hours before serving.

This turned out to be an excellent recipe.  I have found adding some fresh cilantro goes a long way in making it even more authentic.  Since my boys are not real big on having very spicy foods, I usually make half the batch with the jalapenos and the other half without which is an easy way to have hot and mild.

This is excellent.  The best salsa I've ever had.  I would recommend using 1/2 the jalepenos recommended.

After reading all the reviews I was let down by this recipe.  This is a good base recipe but it doesnt have any flavor.  My husband said it tastsed like a hot tomato.  We had to add alot more seasoning to this to get it to taste how we like it.

Caution!  This recipie is spicy!!! I only used 2 jalapenos.  So if you like things hot this is the one.  I added cilantro to add a little color and authentic flavor.  

Thanks for sharing.

This is a terrific recipe! I added a bit of lime juice, tiny bit of cilantro and an extra jalapeno. Gave it a little extra kick. But even without all that, it was delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

We love this recipe!  We only use 1 jalapeno and substitute fresh tomatoes with added tomato sauce for richness, plus a little more sugar.  Restaurant quality!

The roasted jalapenos give this salsa something extra special, though they add quite a bit of heat. I got rave reviews with this recipe, but next time I think I'll start with just 2 jalapenos and add to it if needs be. It's pretty dang spicy. I also added the juice of 1/2 a lime and a couple tablespoons of cilantro, a bit of fresh cracked pepper. Oh so yummy. You've got to try this one and make it your own.

For using canned tomatoes, this is a very tasty salsa.  I followed recipe very close, just added some cilantro for personal choice, and the salsa was all gone over the long weekend.  Will keep this to use when I can't get decent fresh tomatoes.

This is awesome!  I really like HOT salsa and I could only stand to use 3 of the peppers though!  Also, next time I will drain the cans of tomatoes before adding them to the mixture, it was just a little too watery.  I added the juice of one lime, some cilantro and I cut the garlic back to 2 cloves.  This recipe is so good that I'm going to make a huge batch and can it!

Very easy to make and very tasty. Can add or take away the heat by varying the amount roasted peppers. Folks can't get enough of it.

I only used 2 jalapenos, and this salsa was hot enough to scorch your gizzard. (and I lived on the Mexican border so I thought I was used to hot things). Maybe there is a big variation in the size of jalapenos.

This salsa is excellent!  I've made it with both the jalapenos roasted and not, and I prefer them not.  I used a can of the Extra Hot Rotel, in place of the tomatoes and green chili's.  And also used half an onion instead of a whole one.  Can't keep enough it in the fridge!

This salsa is the best although it was really HOT!!!  I added extra tomatoes and onions to lower the spicyness which did help.  I have been searching for the perfect salsa and now I have found it!!!

This was so awesome - really terrific flavor!  4 Jal. peppers makes it VERY hot. I found that using just 2 made it more "medium", but still kept the incredible flavor!

This is a great salsa recipe, but a little spicy for the kids! I made two batches and gave it away as Christmas gifts, everyone loved it!
