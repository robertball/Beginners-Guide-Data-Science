Great recipe. But to make the dill sauce lighter use plain yogurt instead of mayo.

So delicious! We've made it a few times and we love the dill sauce so much that I double the recipe so we have some to dip fresh bread in

had a ton of fresh dill so tried this recipe.  decided to bake it in the oven on parchment paper using skinless salmon.  followed the recipe the only change being adding capers on the top.  unfortunately I overcooked it, I would in the future keep cooking time at about 13 min.  still delicious though!

I made the sauce, and covered a skinless salmon fillet with it, wrapped in foil, and barbecued for about 15 mins. It was so simple, and pretty good. A very easy Monday night recipe!

Nice way to make salmon, and so easy. We didn't use any brown sugar and I'm sure it wasn't missed. We will make this again.

A nice change of pace from the cheese or soy sauce based recipes.  We will have again once in awhile for a change of pace.  The flavor of the topping is strong, so make sure you use a good mustard and fresh dill.

Just made this recipe on the grill.  So quick, easy and yummy!  Placed this recipe right into my recipe box.
I would not change one thing, just adjust the recipe for how large your piece of salmon.

Loved it!  So simple & easy.  Did it on the grill and it actually worked.  The salmon skin was super, super crispy and the rest cooked very nicely.  I had double the amount of fish for the quantity of sauce and it was perfect because I had leftover -- the sauce is fabulous.  Will definitely put this in my fish repertoire!

Followed the recipe & the flavor was fantastic. Had this recipe today. I was afraid of salmon because I didn't know how to cook & flavor it. I cooked directly on the charcoal grill & it took 18 minutes to cook, I will definitely do this again without any changes.

Perfect!  Soooooooooo good! I have been looking for a creamy dill recipe like you get in any good restaurant and this is it.  Even my son, who is a very picky eater loved this recipe. I will be using this over and over again.  Thank you!

Absolutely delicious! I did add a few more punches of brown sugar. Make sure the salmon fillets aren’t too thick. Mine took longer than expected to cook all the way through. I’d definitely make this again!

The recipe was awesome!  My husband is on a cardiac diet, so I made some changes including using avocado oil instead of vegetable oil and using vegan mayonnaise instead of regular mayo.  I also left out the salt and the dish was fabulous!

I had NEVER grilled fresh salmon before. It was very easy to make and my family like it. Had good flavor. I used brown spiced mustard and wanted it to be sweeter so I added more brown sugar. Will be making this again. This recipe is a keeper.

We loved this salmon.   My granddaughter was visiting us and she loved it also.
 I would like to have my daughter try it because she wants to start liking fish.   I didn't  change a thing.     I used Kirklands frozen salmon.   I  am looking forward to having it again.   I used fresh dill because I had it but I think it would be good with dried dill also.

Wonderful sauce for the salmon. We enjoyed the lightness of the flavors, allowing the fish to come through. I did add some capers but otherwise stuck to the recipe! Thank you for sharing!

Pretty great easy recipe. Didn’t want to BBQ. Just put the oven on a low broil- cooked about 8-10min. Came out fantastic. You’ll have to adjust cooking time based on the thickness of your fish.

Really good, mild topping.  I made half per the recipe less the brown sugar and on the other half I added about as much wasabi sauce as mustard, again less the brown sugar.  Both halves were great.  I served it on a bed of lemon butter wild rice.

This is such an easy recipe and with the dill sauce delicious.  My husband just grilled the salmon by itself and we added the dill later.  Easy perfection.  We'll make this again for sure.

I wasn't super impressed with this sauce. It was just bleh. Maybe it was all that mayonnaise? My husband on the other hand LOVED it.

Someone gave me some fresh dill, I had some salmon, so this was the perfect combination.  Really delicious recipe.  I used a little less brown sugar based on other reviewers, and I don't think we missed it.  I doubled the recipe so we'd have extra for "on the side", which we did use.  Had a little leftover.  I guess I'll have to buy some more salmon!

Really easy and tasty. I think the sauce can be over powering ... Spread it on lightly as it is rich.

Grilled tonight with fresh steelhead trout.  Halved recipe. Tried w/o sugar but found the pinch offset the tartness of Dijon. Added more fresh dill from my garden. Absolutely Devine. More dill cut mayo taste. Even basted a little sauce while grilling.  Minor adjustments. Wanted recipe without sour cream. Found it. Perfect with the trout.

Love this dish! I add extra fresh dill because we love it so much and I add a little milk. The leftover sauce goes great with smoked salmon and tomatoes for breakfast.

I made double the recipe with a 1/4 cup each of mayo and sour cream and added to the other ingredients a dash of lemon juice, garlic powder, and the juice from a jar of capers (just a dash). The sauce definitely benefits from the brown sugar just to round out the flavors. Delicious!

Very easy. Skipped the sugar. Seemed a little too much mayo, but very tasty.

Made the sauce with plain yogurt and added a big squeeze of lemon.  Spooned over the grilled salmon after it was cooked.  Yum.

I've tried tons of salmon recipes on the grill and this one was the best. I almost didn't make it because it sounded too easy! My family raved about it with my husband saying this was his favorite grilled salmon ever.

Oh my goodness delicious!! The sauce is amazing and if you like your salmon lightly cooked, moist and full of flavor then this is the perfect recipe for you. I doubled the sauce recipe and the amount of salmon for a family of 4.5. Even my one year old loved it!

Good, but I cut the recipe in half for just the two of us. Made earlier in the day, refrigerated . Served on a tossed salad for our supper.

This was really good! I seasoned the salmon with salt and pepper, used light Miracle Whip instead of mayo to cut the calories and fat, ground mustard (because I didn't have Dijon), and skipped the brown sugar. Grilled it on the George Foreman without the oil (just sprayed some Olive Oil Pam), and squeezed fresh lemon over the finished fish.

This was so simple and yummy! For two people we only needed about half this amount of sauce, but I'll save the rest.
