Although these would be great as posted, I did make a few changes the second time around.  I agree the lemon flavoring wasn't enough, so I added lemon juice to the jelly as well.  I warmed it in the microwave to make it easier to spread as well (a trick I learned from my sister in law!)  This adds more lemon flavoring and it is easier to make! For an extra special touch, I added an easy frosting of powdered sugar mixed with lemon juice.  This adds even more lemon flavor and a sweet note.  Just be careful to wait for it to cool before drizzling the icing on!

This was very simple. Oat crumb bars are one of my most favorite desserts. I made only one change and used a cranberry-apple relish spread that I had on hand, as I had no strawberry. (All I had was apple butter for spread, and I didn't think it would have been AS good.) I did have to cook it longer than the recipe specified, I cooked it for about 22 minutes or until it was firm and the top was browned just a bit. I think I might chill it a bit and do as another reviewer did and make a frosting out of lemon juice and confectioners sugar and drizzle it over the top for more of a lemon flavor. TIP: If you used a cup of peanuts in the crust instead of walnuts and used the raspberry bread, you'd have a darn fine peanut butter and jelly bar.

Nice little bars.  I don't really taste the lemon, which is a bit disappointing, but they are pretty good bars.  I halved the recipe and put in an 8x8 pan.  Instead of blackberry jam, I used leftover Sweet Blackberry and Brandy Sauce I made last weekend.  It worked well as a subsitute.  The bars seemed quite crumbly when I first pulled them out, so after they cooled I placed them in the fridge overnight and then cut them this afternoon.  Cold, they were less crumbly and easy to cut.  Thanks for the recipe!

delicious, I used black berry jam and I cut up some black berry's for this. You definitely have to bake it longer.

My husband isn't supposed to like these recipes and he loved this one! I added a bit more lemon juice but the recipe stood alone. I'll try using different jams next time too.
