This is delicious and so easy.  I recommend using bosc pears and brown sugar.  I did not put the marmalade in because I did not have any.

I cut the butter in half and baked these much longer since I wanted tender pears. Very delicious, and quite healthy for a dessert.

These weren't bad, but were a little firmer than I expected, and not as hot as I thought they'd be.  I served them with icecream, and I wanted them steaming hot so they'd be good with the icecream.
Next time I'll bake them longer than the recommended time in the recipe.

I used Splenda instead of sugar and baked for about 25 minutes in a covered casserole. Wow! It doesn't get any better than that. I think any other addition such as ice cream would be to sweet. Thanks!

Love this recipe. I made this for a quick dessert on Christmas day, as well as tonight.  I love this simplicity of this recipe, as you could tweak your taste buds.  I used Orange marmalade once and tonight, I tried one half with strawberry jam--YUM.  Thanks for the recipe, easy to do and my 4 yr old LOVES these pears.  *UPDATE*  made this recipe three more times, I love this dessert, it's so yummy and healthy too!

Four Plus Stars.  It's not something you could put into rotation, but WOWZA!!! Unexpected good!  Left the "skins" on, cut the butter down, used a bit less sugar and more cinnamon. (Bake time was about an hour) Instead of orange marmalade, I used Strawberry Polaner for half of them, and left the rest plain.  You absolutely must top these with some vanilla ice cream - really upped the experience!

This was an alright recipe but I think it would be helped by slicing the pears thin so that the flavor could get further into the pear. I made the recipe as written and the flavor was good on the surface of the pear halves but lacked down in the part near the skin. It was a good starter recipe though, so thank you!

This was perfect for a last-minute dessert I had to make for dinner, but I think under other circumstances I'd go for something else as it was a little too simple.

Made these for dessert on a couple of occasions, they taste really good with vanilla custard poured over them in shallow bowls to serve.

Wonderful! I used a brown sugar/cinnamon/nutmeg mix and also added a little vanilla over the pears before cooking. Fab!

I LOVE these!!!  Only changes - left off the lemon juice, used apricot jam (that's what I had on hand) and added walnuts on top. Used Anjou pears (perhaps a bit too big for this recipe), so I did need to cook for about 40 minutes. And of course served with vanilla bean ice cream.

This was an excellent dessert, we had it with whipped topping warm out of the oven. My boyfriend loved it. It was super easy and I will make this often.

I too used Bosc pears and cooked for a longer time - about 40 minutes. I chose not to add any sugar or butter. All I really did was cut them in half and core them, and then sprinkled cinnamon and ginger on them. My husband and I found them sweet enough on their own. Really healthy, and my husband says he likes them better than baked apples.

Here's something really easy.  Grease a pan.  Cut the peeled/cored pears into chunks. It doesn't matter how many you use.  Grease all the chunks with some oil.  Use your hands. Use any jam, not jelly, that you like.  Use about 1/4 cup or more.  Using clean hands, massage the pears with your fingers to distribute the jam.   Bake until bubbly or hot.  This is good cold or hot, with topping such as granola or cream or not. You can use just about any fruit. My favorite is plum butter jam with apples.  Have eaten this all my life.

Loved it! Very easy dessert and it tastes kind of like homemade apple cobbler. Some vanilla ice cream do give it a very nice touch. Can't wait to serve this to my husband! :)

Oh my goodness these were good!  And so simple!  I didn't peel, used less butter, and forgot the lemon juice, but they were great!  I wondered about putting cinamon and orange marmalade together, but the combination with the pear is excellent.  We had them warm--baked them while we ate dinner--and served with a bit of *real* vanilla ice cream.  Definitely make extras, put them in the fridge and eat cold the next day--maybe with yogurt and granola for breakfast?  Yum!

I didn't really follow the recipe, but it gave me some good guidelines for making baked pears. I made 3 pears with 6 tsp margarine, 2 Tbs. lemon juice, and 2 Tbs. agave nectar. I used a 9x13 casserole, which spread the sauce out and helped to carmelize it. I also flipped the pears after about 15 minutes. Then I sliced them when they were cooked. Really good topping for pancakes or pumpkin pie.

I did not use the marmalade but followed the recipe otherwise. When serving, I allowed the pears to cool just a little then served with vanilla ice cream in the scooped out part. They were good but not excellent. I liked it because it is like a healthy dessert if I don't add the ice cream.

I baked for 35 minutes, and honestly, they could have used about 10 more.  I suppose it depends on how firm you like them.  I served with hot custard, and they were delicious!

I've been looking for a non desert-desert! This is perfect! I half the butter. I use brown sugar instead of regular and half that. And I use whip cream instead of marmalade. And sprinkle on some more cinnamon on top! The first time I made it, it was to die for but much to sweet. So that's why I did the changes.

This is very good!  I had neither lemon juice nor orange marmalade, but I did have orange juice, which i drizzled over the pears.  I also sprinkled on walnuts prior to the cinnamon/sugar.

This was great quick way to use up ripe pears I had on hand.  The only thing I change was the butter I used 1 teaspoon for the 2 pears and cooked for 30mins. The pears still had a bite but were spoon tender but my pears were very ripe!

I made these as directed in the recipe except that instead of putting them in the oven I stuck them in the microwave for 5 minutes.  They are very good, but next time I will definitely peel them first as the peels are very bitter...maybe because these are homegrown pears.  A nice quick dessert, though.

I will try this again with a couple of changes. First off, I will skin the pears and cut into bite size pieces. Then add salt along with the sugar and cinnamon. If that doesn't help the original recipe, I won't try anymore. Disappointed but willing to try one more time.

We have a pear tree in the back yard (New England) - cooking time for these 'harder' pears took 50+ minutes and they were still pretty crunchy

This one is in my menu rotation- a nice change from the usual vegetable with every meal. Getting my kids to eat veggies is mission impossible- but they gobble up the baked pears.
