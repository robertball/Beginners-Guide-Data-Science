This was fun for me and my four-year-old son to decorate together. He decided we wanted a green house, but I put the food coloring in the base batch. It turned out fine since it just makes it look like grass. I was a little frustrated with the somewhat unclear cutting instructions and wish it would have mentioned evening out the sides after baking them and angling edges so that the roof pieces would fit together better. The icing fills in the gaps pretty well, though. We added powdered sugar at the end which looked nice. This makes me wonder how difficult a gingerbread house would be - this was my first attempt at such a holiday project and it wasn't too time consuming or difficult since it's just rice krispie treats.
