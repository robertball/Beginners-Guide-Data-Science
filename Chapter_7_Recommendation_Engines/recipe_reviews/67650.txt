This recipe was great!  I made a few changes to suit my taste.  Instead of beef bouillon, I used vegetable or chicken stock in the can/box.  I also added a full Tablespoon of Italian seasoning, 3 cloves of fresh sliced garlic, and a cup of leftover spaghetti sauce to give a nice tomato base.  For a nice variation, I also added frozen italian greenbeans and other veggies.  This soup would also be good with beans, rice, meat or pasta added as well.  Good on a cold day!

This soup is great!!!  It was the second time making it and I loved it even more.  I do add a little extra boullion, vegetable juice, a bit more garlic salt, and chickpeas to make it more hearty, but it's wonderful!!!!

Very quick and easy soup to throw together.  I used 2 cans beef broth rather than the boullion.  Also added a couple of cups of cooked shell macaroni and a can of kidney beans to make it a little heartier.  My hubby loved it.

Very Good.  I squeesed some lemon into each serving bowl and it added a wonderful zest.  Will make again.

My grandmother used to make this a similar way.  Basically the same recipe, but she'd use crumbled cooked ground beef.  It was very good.

This soup went over well with my family, not big vegetable fans. The italian seasoning and sprinkle of parmesan make it italian restaurant quality! I'm making it again tonight!

I love veggie soup, and this recipe proved to be so easy, quick and delicious.  My husband, a chef, loved this recipe too!  The only changes I made were I used halved grape tomatoes, added a bit of V-8, and didn't add any salt to the soup.   My son doesn't like celery so he turned his nose up to the soup so for lunch the next day my husband pureed the soup in the blender, put it back in the pot, added a little milk and chopped sausage.  Our son LOVED it, he thought it was a Mexican bean soup :)  This method works for homemade mushroom soup too!

Great soup. I doubled up the yeild and added a diced red pepper and a bunch of spring onions. Personal taste.
I also used vegetable stock cubes instead of the beef boullion as a few members of my family are vegetarian. Delicious!

This is really good. I omitted the cabbage & celery and just used what I had in the fridge (onions, green peppers cauliflower and a frozen mix of carrots, broccoli, etc).  I 'sauteed' the veg in a bit of water so there is no fat in the recipe and this is perfect for my WW points!  I used Club House Spaghetti Seasoning. This will be yummy pureed too for a nice smooth texture soup too.

My "Dragon Tail" soup search is over thanks to this recipe. My son loved it at Medieval Times, and loved this recipe just as much at home. I used 6 cups of beef stock instead of beef cubes and only included the onion, carrots, tomatoes, and celery from the veg. list. After cooking everything else as directed - I strained my son's portion to be only broth as it is in "Dragon Tail" soup and he couldn't be happier. I ate the soup "as is" and was very satisfied with the ease of making the soup and the great flavor.

This is very good-easy to make, tastes great and versatile too.  I didn't have all the ingredience the recipe called for so I to use what was on hand.  I used chicken broth instead of beef bouillon, a 14.5 oz of diced plum tomatoes w/basil, oregano and garlic instead of plain diced tomatoes and fresh green beans instead of zucchini.  Will definitley make again.

I am so addicted to this soup.  We made a couple of changes like using organic beef stock instead of boullion and adding sweet Italian chicken sausage.  We've also tried adding asparagus and fresh green beans.  It's so delicious that I make it once a week for me and my husband.

This is a good starting place for veg soup.  I added a clove of fresh garlic during the saute stage.  I did not use beef broth, just water, and seasoned with salt, pepper, bay, oregano, basil, and a little red pepper.  I also added the onion just halved and fished it out at the end after simmering 2 hours or so.  I omitted cabbage and zuchini as I didn't have these in the house, but would try at another time.  The result was a very tasty soup that would prolly take well to sausage or chicken or other add ins like pasta or potato.  I made a double batch for freezing and I would make this again.

Great recipe, Instead of 6 cups of water. I used 4 cups of chicken broth, 1 cup of water & 1 cup of tomato juice. I also added 1/1 a tsp of thyme. I also let it simmer for about an hour to ensure the vegetables got cooked.

I had high hopes but the Italian Seasoning is too overwhelming.  It's like oregano soup.  Maybe I'll try again with half the spices.

Really tasty soup base. I did add beef to mine, and used chicken broth instead of beef bouillon, but that was a pantry substitute...and we like a little meat in our "vegie" soups.// a year later...tried again, as written by submitter...good even without the meat. It does lend itself to tweaking. Can be served over rice or have some kind of pasta added to it for a more stick-to-your-ribs version. Ah, yes, even pulled ribs in this sea of vegetable goodness, would work.

I made this for our church's mid-week Lenten soup and bread supper on Wednesday evening.  It was very good!  DEFINITELY use the Parmesan cheese.  It makes this soup GREAT (I tasted it without the cheese and decided to add it.  I'm glad I did!)  I also increased the Italian seasoning to about 1 Tbs and used a little extra boullion crystals ( I didn't have cubes on hand) instead of adding salt.  The recipe made a 5-quart pot of soup and I came home with only about 1-1/2 cups left-over.  I pureed the leftovers and liked it even better that way!  It would probably be good pureed, then mix in some cooked macaroni.  Thanks for a great, simple, HEALTHY recipe!

Awesome.  Talk about comfort food on a cold, cold night... this is it. It's the perfect marriage of the beef solution (I use beef stock), tomatoes and
spices that brings the magic to this
recipe.  Following the suggestions of 
previous reviewers I the added some diced
potatoes.  I strongly recommend you add
any vegetable, within reason, you like.
I guarantee the next time I make it, I will add green lima beans.  And I guarantee there will be a next time and
then some.  So go on, experiment.  This
recipe is virtually bulletproof.

WONDERFUL SOUP!  I used a little more of the suggested vegetables and even added a yellow crookneck squash.  To serve the leftovers I added pre-cooked pasta just before serving and it was great too!  Thanks for sharing an easy-tasty soup recipe!

Very easy to prepare. Used frozen, diced onions. I left out the cabbage and garlic salt. Instead used fresh minced garlic and seasoning salt. Added a bit of red wine as well as Italian sausage (browned with the veggies). Topped with shredded parmesan and served with bread out of the oven.

When I got done with the original recipe I was very disappointed. The vegetables were under cooked though I followed directions precisely. As someone else mentioned the Italian seasoning was too strong. I had to do some things to fix it up to my tastes and stew it for an hour so the veggies were supple. 

I think next time I'll use a crock pot and less Italian seasoning.

Made this yesterday for dinner, a very easy, enjoyable recipe for a busy weekday.  I used homemade beef broth, diced the onion and celery, used garlic powder in stead of garlic salt.  We had the leftovers today to which I added some small pasta shells.  Thank you sharing a wonderful soup, Peach822 !!

This is a delicious and easy soup!  Italian seasoning is going to taste different depending on the brand...I used McCormicks and it was a hit at my cookie party. :)

This is delicious. What I do is cook up the veggies til they are very tender, let it cool and then puree. Serve this as a cold summer soup... mmmm

I've been making this for a couple of years, love it!   When I want a heartier soup I add beans and potatoes.   When I want to eat light, I make a large batch with just veggies and eat it all week long.   I sometimes add cajun seasoning to my bowl when I want to mix it up a bit.

Really tasty and flexible. Like to add in some frozen veggies and kidney beans. Pretty quick to make, good for a weekday meal.

This really is an excellent recipe. I use beef base and mix up six cups of broth, simply because it's better quality, but this is a minor adjustment and the recipe really doesn't need anything else.

I couldn't believe how great this diet friendly soup taste.  I added a little parmesan cheese to my bowl.  I think it definetly adds to the flavor.

amazing, restaurant-quality soup!!! I used veg bouillon cubes,just one zucchini, and added a can of garbanzos and 1/2 cup orzo. I had to add 1 c water too, but the flavor is excellent. Save time by using frozen chopped onion, celery, and green pepper.

This was very tastey.  I think everyone makes soup recipes there own, these are the changes I made.  I added pressed garlic for the last 2-3 min of the onion, celery, carrot mixture.  It still needed something at the end, so I added a roasted garlic and red pepper seasoning.  This was great by itself, but when you add the shredded parmesan it takes it over the top!

I guess I expected too much based on the reviews.  I found this recipe extremely bland even though I doubled the seasoning.  Even the parmesan did not help the flavor.  Sorry, I just did not enjoy this soup.

Sadly I didn't have cabbage, but bock choy work just as good.  Came out real yummy.  Don't forget to add some Parm Chesse on top. I also paired it with grilled chesse sandwiches.  Cant beat it.

This was delicious, but I agree- I added a few things to make it a bit more flavorful. I added some pesto, corn, fresh basil and left out the cabbage. I also used fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Really great and easy soup!

Exactly what I wanted for dinner tonight. I sauteed ½ an onion, 2 carrots, no celery, and a can of sliced mushrooms in about a tablespoon of bacon grease. I poured the can of tomatoes, 1 TBS Italian seasoning, 2 tsp beef bouillon and 5 cups water in my 3-quart slow cooker set on low. When the veggies were tender, I added them to the slow cooker with some salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a can of garbanzo beans. I let it cook for around three hours, and then I set the cooker to high and added 1 sliced zucchini and about a cup of broccoli florets. I let it cook for another hour, then added about a cup of seashell pasta. 30 minutes later, it was done! I used the emersion blender to puree a little of it to thicken it somewhat, and it was fabulous with shredded cheddar and a teaspoon of plain yogurt. Thanks for sharing, Peach822!

This is a great basic soup recipe.  Instead of bullion I used two cans vegetable and two cans of beef broth.  I threw in some canned corn, frozen green beans, potatoes, and kidney beans.  I suggest using less of the italian seasoning as it's really powerful (but smells great!).    I added a couple tablespoons of tomato paste as well because I like tomato flavour!

My family loved this recipe! The first time I made it, I added a can of garbanzo beans and 2 potatoes (in the first step when sauteeing the vegetables), used only one zucchini and left out the cabbage. I also increased the seasoning to 1 tbsp of Italian seasoning as other people had suggested. I used canned tomatoes with added basil, oregano, and garlic. I think it really added to the flavor of the soup overall. The second time I used regular tomatoes, but I felt the soup needed more spice in it. I put in cabbage the second time too, and it was very good... I highly reccomend using it! To make it vegetarian, I used 3 cans of vegetable broth and 3 cups of water.

Well,I just fixed this soup today and it's a very good soup. I made some adjustements,nothing major to the soup but I didn't use any cabbage or celery (personal taste) and I used 1 can of beef broth,probaly could have used more...and if I make this again,I would saute the zucchini's also.

This is really good but its not necissarily "quick" it took me at least an hour.  I had to cook the soup longer to soften all the vegetables.

This is an awesome soup. Hubby and I are trying to drop a few pregnancy pounds so we have a bowl of low-cal veggie soup or a big salad before dinner to fill us up. This is our favorite soup recipe. 

I used about 5 fresh chopped vine-ripe tomatoes in place of the canned, pre-julienned fresh carrot, red onion, a mix of chicken broth and V-8 in place of water, a few mushrooms, 2 cloves fresh garlic, a handful of green beans, and half of each a red and green, and hot banana pepper. I also used Chinese cabbage. 

In place of the Italian seasoning I used a few fresh springs of thyme, a handful of fresh chopped basil, and a pinch of dried oregano. I forgot to add cheese but it was still delicious without it!

Sensational soup at 100 cal per serving- this is going in the recipe box for sure!

This was really good for such an easy and quick soup. I followed the recipe exact, but also just added some spagehtti sauce for a lil extra Italiany, tomatoey flavor, and it was really good. I will definetly make this again. Thanks for the easy and delicous recipe.

Made as per the directions except used 4C of low sodium beef broth and 2C water. Overwhelming taste of oregano and cabbage. Good base, but next time I will omit the cabbage and half the Italian seasoning and go from there.

For low salt option- I left out the bouillon cubes, Italian seasoning, and garlic salt. Instead, I used 1 T parsley and 1 T oregano. Very tasty!

I will make this again!  Loved all the vegetables, adding green beans as well and cannellini beans too.  I used one box and one 16 oz can of reduced sodium beef broth instead of the beef bouillon.  The canned tomatoes I used were flavored with basil and oregano too for added flavor.  So good and healthy.

Yummy and filling on a cold night! I made a substitution only because I did not have cabbage. Instead of cabbage, I peeled and diced 3 small potatoes, and added 1/4 cup of uncooked rice toward the end and simmered for 15-20 minutes more. I also added about 1/2 T. of sugar. To go with it, I broiled some sliced ciabatta bread with a little butter and Parmesan cheese.

We found this a great replacement for a canned soup that is no longer available. add rotini pasta for a bit of fun.

Since it's a vegetable soup, I used vegetable broth instead of beef bouillon. I added barley which increased the cooking time but worth it. 2nd Note: I added alphabet pasta, but not cabbage.

Great soup, very easy. Added some cannelloni beans as other had suggested, as well as a cubed acorn squash I had on hand. We will make this again for sure!

Loved it. I used chicken broth instead of beef and added cooked, chopped up sweet Italian chicken sausage and it made the flavor even better. Hubby loved it too,  and he's pretty picky

WOW!! This was tasty. I used chicken broth instead of water and also used salt, pepper and garlic powder in place of the garlic salt. I followed the directions to a "T" and we were all impressed. This would also make a GREAT base for a Minestrone or to add in Italian sausage or meatballs, pasta and even shrimp/ scallops. DEE-licious!!

This was a fast and easy recipe, and it turned out delicious. I added whole wheat pasta (small shells), garlic, white pepper and cayenne to mine, and it was wonderful. On my next attempt I may add kidney beans and potatoes. Great recipe to play around with and make it your own!

I made this for Hubs to grab and reheat in the microwave for a low carb lunch or snack.  I used beef broth instead of bouillon and water.  I also had more cabbage, probably 3 cups, but added it all anyway.  I froze this in individual servings.

YUM.  I had some roasted tomatoes that I used instead of canned.  I did not have beef so used chicken stock.  Very tasty.  Add the crunchy vegetables last and turn off.  Then heat only the amount you are going to eat right away.  Prevents soggy veggies.  Can't wait to make with vegetable stock for vegetarian family members.

Very Very Good!! I didn't have any celery, zucchinis or cabbage, I did add pasta noodles and canned corn. It turned out great. I didn't even have to use any salt, the garlic salt was enough.

This was so good! I didn't exactly have the called-for ingredients, so I used two cans chicken broth instead of bouillon.  I also used tomato pasta sauce in place of tomatoes, and added yellow squash and mushrooms for additional heartiness. Adding lots of the pepper made it enjoyably spicy!

Made this today in a pinch, couldn't add the cabbage because I'm a nursing mom and that upsets the baby, but did everything else according to recipe. I did add a few more tomatoes, and it was amazing!!! Love the flavor of the liquid and the simplicity of the recipe. Thanks for posting!

Just what I was looking for, a quick and tasty soup to make for 100 school kids on a cold winters day!  I added garbanzos and a little bit of shell pastas to give it a minestrone look.  A big hit, there wasn't enough left to feed the kitchen staff!  I'll make much more next time.

I love this soup! Like a previous poster I added a can of rinsed kidney beans, and some cooked shell macaroni to make it heartier. I also added a small can of tomato paste, used beef broth instead of bouillon as I didn't have any on hand, and added some hot sauce because we like spicy. I guess as some say that means it is not the original but it's my variation/2cents. I keep some of this in my freezer now to thaw for quick meals.

Great flavor!  I do suggest using real shredded parmesan on top, as it has much better flavor comparitively speaking.  Next time, I will add cannellini or red beans.

We LOVE this recipe...its easy, healthy, and flavorful. It made its way into our rotation! One thing is that it says to use two bouillon cubes, but be sure to check the bottle and see how much water each cube will flavor. Each of my cubes would only flavor 1 cup of water so the soup turned out very bland...then i realized i needed to add more cubes!

Great soup after some doctoring, but kind of bland as stated. I added 2 cubes of boullion (the big kind that makes 2 cups of broth) and it still was too bland for me, so I added about a cup of chicken broth and that did the trick. I didn't have any cabbage so I added baby spinach, I added a yellow squash, and a can of chickpeas. GREAT SOUP!

Loved it!  What a great base for veggie soup.  I left out the celery, but added some kidney beans, potatoes and a can of tomato sauce.  Soooo good.  I think I'll try some crumbled cooked ground beef next!  That would make a hearty dinner.

I make this one for frozen lunches. The parmesan adds the extra tasty surprise. This soup is easy to make, especially with a mandoline. It reheats perfectly!

This is so simple, and so good!  I add pasta or potatoes to thicken it.

This recipe was great. I'm not a big cook and it was easy to throw together. Plus I don't even like most vegetables but thrown together in this soup was delicious. I did add just a little bit more garlic powder to it and even a dash of chili powder. It was so good.

I added some hot italian sausage because my family required more than just veggies that night -- and it was fabulous!  I'm definitely adding it to my regular recipes!
