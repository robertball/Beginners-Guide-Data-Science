The reviews were good and I decided on a whim to make this. Halfway through I panicked: did all family members review this? How could something this simple be that good? Well when it was done I didn't have to wonder anymore. This IS delicious! It's warm and cool creamy and crispy all at the same time. While I added a dash of garlic powder and a couple of shakes of dried chives to the sauce using less yogurt and mayo than it called for this recipe would be good (if overly saucy) as is. My only suggestion: eat it right away or let the sauce come to room temperature before mixing in with the potatoes. Otherwise the potatoes cool to lukewarm and lose their delicious oven crispiness. It's simple and tasty - try it today!

I was a little skeptical about the yogurt with potatoes since I dislike all yogurt but these are the best potatoes I have ever had!! Highly recommended to make just the way the recipe says. I am a horrible cook and these are soooo easy to make!

absolutely one of the best potatoe dishes i have ever tried. it takes the place of a cold potatoe salad with less work. don't assemble too far ahead as it tends to dry out.

This was easy to prepare I didn t peel the potatoes and it still was great. My hubby never coments but in this case said it was great. I kind of tasted like salt and vinegar chips to me. will do again.

I made these tonight for a family dinner and everybody loved them! I used Yukon Gold potatoes and the only thing I did different was I added a little dehidrated onions with the olive oil and a few dashes of paprika to the sauce. I served it with meatloaf and it complimented it very nicely. Next time I make it I will not make as much of the sauce had quite a bit of it left over so think I only need to make 2/3rds of that.

This was easy to prepare ahead of time by chopping up the potatoes and placing in water in the fridge untill ready to mix in the olive oil. It was great except my guests and I felt it was missing some zing suggestions were to add garlic finely chopped seaseme seeds toasted or poppy seeds also I added onions chopped to this as well. This dish goes very well with bbq'd meats!!

These were a hit at our party! There was extra sauce left. I put some chives in and garlic powder as well.

Made as instructed I don't think these were spectacular. I think the flavour could be improved easily by adding some dried basil oregano garlic powder and thyme. I wasn't too crazy about the mayo yogurt combo but think that perhaps using a ranch & yogurt combo could enhance it. As is the recipe has more than enough salt and w/ the right combo of herbs could be omitted/reduced.

Very good base for a recipe. It seems an odd combination but when paired with a spicier dish especially BBQ it tends to cool it down. I do recommend adding other spices to it but otherwise a great recipe.
