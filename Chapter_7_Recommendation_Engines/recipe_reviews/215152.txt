Rich, creamy, delicious!  I didn't have lavender blooms so I added two drops of FOOD GRADE lavender essential oil to the mix after the heating was finished.  It turned out wonderfully!

It also expands more than other ice cream recipes I have used.  The batch makes about 2 quarts, so I doubled it for my 4 quart freezer.  I ended up having to scoop some out when I found it was raising the lid!  Next time I'll either make a single batch or freeze a double batch in the 6 quart freezer.  I WILL make this one again though!

A wonderful summery ice cream.  I may suggest just a touch less sugar though.  My family loved it (even those who are less adventurous eaters)!  Definitely making this one again.

I followed this recipes directions exactly using our farm fresh raw goats milk in place of both the milk and heavy cream called for in it. I used our duck egg yolks and used the full amount of sugar. This ice cream was absolutely wonderful! It was refreshing. My kids felt it tasted a lot like fruit loops of all things. They loved it.

OMG!!!  This is my first attempt at homemade ice cream and this recipe is out of this world!!!  I did everything as the directions said, but I added 2 tablespoons of honey to the milk/lavender mixture.  It is a very subtle taste of honey, but this ice cream is a prize winner.  I am so thrilled!! I also used 1 1/2 tablespoons of lavender because my lavender was not on the stem anymore.  Takes a little time to make this, but worth it!!!

This was delicious!  As lavender isn't in season at the moment I used 1.5 tablespoons of dried lavender which was very subtle.  I'll use 2 rounded tablespoons next time.

I added more lavender and it was still very faint flavoring.  Excellent.

This is an excellent recipe. I used a teaspoon of dry lavender which I bought in Amazon. I put twice less sugar. The outcome was delicious. We served lavender ice cream in the theme party we hosted - the food and drinks should be from famous movies (remember "It's complicated"?). Our guests were totally overwhelmed and remember this dish till now.

Lavender ice cream sounded horrible to me. But my son brought a container from a specialty store to try. It was so good but then I found out none of the stores carried it anymore. I went online and tried many recipes and this is THE BEST yummy and original flavored ice cream! Note: I'm allergic to lavender and the smell of fresh or essential oil gives me a migraine. Why do you risk a migraine and ignore the tickle in the back of your throat, you ask?  Trust me it's that good! I have my kids mess with the lavender buds (dried--2 TBS) and I do the rest. Then I keep Benedryl handy. lol

Everyone liked it and I did change it a bit, but only because lavender is out of season. I made it exactly as written. To substitute the lavender, I used my own lavender extract (take a half bottle of 100 proof vodka and add chopped up lavender from 100 blossoms; shake and place in window for six weeks, shaking every day; then, pour through a cheesecloth and voila). To make color, I grated one half of one purple potato (in Japan, they make potato ice cream). 
I downgraded this to good because the color of egg yolk was so yellow, that the subtle color of the purple did not come through. Otherwise, I'd make it again, only next time, less eggs.

I used whole milk, maybe 5 stems of lavender (they were puny), & about a 50-50 blend of Splenda & honey in place of the sugar.  It was perfectly creamy, & had just the right amount of sweetness & an inexplicable / mysterious / possibly addicting flavor. Well received by teens & adults. Would be mind-bogglingly delicious in a sugar cone.

Good recipe! The ice cream turned out really smooth and creamy and my garden fresh lavender and mint added the right floral summer taste! In the future, I think I will try cutting down the eggs as this recipe was a bit too egg-y for my preference.
