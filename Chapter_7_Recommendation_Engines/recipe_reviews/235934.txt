This recipe has MAJOR flaws. But seriously, cooking in the microwave for 10-12 minutes on high..no way? It’s a liquid when it goes into the micro, and I had concerns about splattering all over the oven, so I did put a lid on, but left it slightly open. I set the micro for 3 mins, walked into the kitchen before the oven stopped, and saw it climbing up the side of the bowl, so I shut it down. At that point, I had a bowl of spongy, rubbery, and dense/hard pudding. I tried to break it up with a spoon and then a whisk, but finally, in an effort to salvage it, just put it back into the blender which wouldn’t even blend it (that’s how dense it was). I kept adding milk through the lid and it eventually broke down and mixed up. The flavor isn’t horrible, but we all thought it was way too sweet. More importantly, the texture was grainy unlike a creamy pudding. Sorry for the harsh first review, but I can only say that this will NEVER be made again in this house.------UPDATE 2.26.14:  I was just told  that in Canada a Brazilian Pudding is more like a cake, and this had just about reached that consistency when I took it out of the micro at under 3 minutes.  Sure wish there had been a notation about that because unless you really know what the consistency is supposed to be, most of us in the U.S. would expect a creamy pudding.

Excellent recipe!  Brazilian pudding is NOT like pudding as we know it in the US.  It's like a cake!  If you're going to rate it 1 star, at least educate yourself on what you're making.   I do agree that 10-12 was slightly long, but the 2nd time I made it, I cooked it 8-9 mins and it was perfect.  FYI, that photo of the "pudding" in the glass dessert dish is NOT what this is supposed to look like.  This is like my mother-in-law makes, but much easier than her method! Thanks Fernanda!

This is an easy and simple recipe. Keep in mind that this IS NOT pudding like we're used to in the Unites States. This is a Canadian spin on a Brazilian classic. It's more of a cake than pudding. 
It's a cross between a Brownie and a Sponge cake. 
When using a hot chocolate mix, Go for an extra rich version (i.e.  Swiss Miss). 
Also, make sure you have a glass of milk to drink with it.
