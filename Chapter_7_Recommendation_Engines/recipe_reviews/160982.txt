This recipe is AMAZING!!  My husband and I will add it to our regular rotation of dinners.  The one change I made was to reduce the fat by cutting out the butter, not using the bacon drippings to cook the veggies (I just used the olive oil) and not adding the sausage grease to the bean mixture at the end.  The recipe still turned out GREAT.

I am from Baton Rouge originally so Ive had alot of red beans and rice! This is the closest thing to being back in the swamp state. I do like a thicker base so I make a roux but overall this recipe really hits all the flavors. I also serve over white rice and serve either corn bread or french bread to sop up the juices. I find that using a thick cut, smoked bacon works best. Sure you will spend 3$ more for the better quality bacon but I think it's worth it. Check out this users crawfish pasta as well...I have not made it yet but it is similar to my mom's recipe and hers is divine!

Great flavor, but I felt that it had too much liquid, even after simmering for some time, so I drained mine a bit and served over white rice.

AWESOME!!!  I used a TJ's bag of frozen bell peppers because it's cheaper and faster than using fresh, and a regular yellow onion because I didn't have any green.  I also used 1 qt homemade chicken broth and 1 qt water.  At first it looked like too much liquid but it cooked down nicely and thickened up.  Served over rice and with cornbread - YUM!

Excellent recipe- I will use this again- but reduce the pepper flakes by 1/2 and only about a cup of water.

I grew up eating red beans & rice on a regular basis. I've also tried many different recipes and just couldn't find "the one."  This one is it. I made it with the bacon as instructed, but I just don't see the need for it. And, I ended up having to make a roux because I like my beans a little thicker.  And for those reasons (and those reasons only) I had to give 4 out of 5 stars. Truly a great red beans dish! Don't forget the corn bread!!

Spicy and good....made me sweat!  Make sure you taste first before adding salt because the sausage is salty.  For those in my family who prefer a tad less spice, next time I may cut the pepper flakes a bit, but the spiciness does mellow out a lot by the next day for leftovers.  Also, I made a roux with the butter before adding, to thicken sauce a bit, since others commented on the wateriness.  Great over rice and with skillet cornbread.

I made a few changes due to time constraints and what was on hand. I sliced the andouille, browned it in a little olive oil, then added the onions, green bell pepper and garlic. When this was softened, I added canned kidney beans, freshly ground pepper, and some chicken broth (didn't need salt as the broth was pretty salty). Simmered it, covered, for about 30 mins, and served it over rice. This wasn't the most appetizing-looking meal ever, but it was hearty and filling. Thanks!

Richard & Suzanne's Famous Red Bean Sausage Haiku: "Suzanne & Richard, you are heroes in our house, we loved this that much!" Other than reducing the red pepper flakes and using smoked sausage instead of andouille (7-yr old doesn't have quite the taste for heat just yet), oh and changing the servings to make it only a single can of beans, I kept the recipe as written. The bacon grease and bay leaf were really the only seasoning called for, and yet they provided plenty of flavor to this awesome and simple dish. I would've liked the additional spice, but even made a bit more tame, this meal was righteous!

This recipe is good, but doesn't need the fat.  I threw it all into a crockpot (used dried beans) and cooked it all day, so no need for sauteeing the vegetables first.  I decided to use some chicken stock for added flavor.  You can throw in a can of tomatoes too.  This recipe is a good starting point.

Of the red beans and rice recipes on the site, this is our favorite - kids included.  It has the best flavor and consistency.  I omit the bacon, green pepper, and butter simply because I didn't have those ingredients on hand or it seemed unnecessary.  I also typically make the red beans from dried beans.      It's a hearty meal for supper, and it's yummy warmed up and served as a dip with ritz crackers.
