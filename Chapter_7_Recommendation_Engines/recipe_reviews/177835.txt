With a few modifications- this is a good recipe.  First I used lean ground beef, so less fat.  I added chopped onions, green peppers, basil, oregano, and garlic to the beef as it was browning.  Because there was not much fat- I DID NOT DRAIN.  Thus keeping flavor.  I increased the cheddar cheese to a whole cup, and everything came out pretty tasty!

I wanted to make a quick "cheeseburger" macaroni dish but didn't have the ingredients for my own personal recipe. This did in a pinch. I tossed some homemade hamburger seasoning mix over the ground beef while it was browning, I added in a little dijon mustard, and one drained can of petite diced tomatoes. This was inhaled by my boys. GREAT pantry meal for a Mom who's running low on ingredients.

This dish was an okay version of hamburger helper. Its needs a bit more flavor. I added oregano & garlic, but that didn't do the trick. Next time I will add some veggies.

I needed a "hamburger helper" type meal - fast and flavorful on the stovetop.  This fit the bill... even with my on-the-fly modifications due to ingredients.  I used turkey instead of beef, cooked it very brown, and then instead of tomato soup I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles.  I used a splash of Tabasco in place of Worcestershire sauce.  This turned out excellent! Very flavorful and zesty.  Will definitely do it again!  I usually don't change recipes the first time, but this one is flexible enough to do so.  Thanks!

I replaced the Worcestershire sauce with balsamic vinaigrette and white American cheese instead of cheddar. I also added peppers, onions, garlic, and a variety of spices including oregano, parsley, etc. It was delicious.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was excellent. I did make a few modifications, I didn't add onions because of a picky eater and instead used onion powder. I also added garlic powder, used a whole pound of pasta and two cans of soup, and added a generous amount of grated parmesan cheese. My family doesn't like pasta sauces with any sort of "chunks" so this is a great alternative for us. Would definitely make again.

I try not to mess with a recipe too much the first time around, but this one seemed like it would be bland.  So I added garlic and a variety of seasonings.  I was also out of cheddar cheese, so I ended up using velveeta instead.  After it was finished I tasted it.  Completely bland.  I broke down and added some spaghetti sauce.  The recipe is easy and isn't bad, just very bland.  You might as well save yourself the time and just use spaghetti sauce and mozzerella cheese from the beginning.

My family loved this quick and easy meal. Since we always have the ingredients on hand, we can make it on very short notice. I recommend a little more pasta in it.

This recipe was very easy & quick.  I didn't cook it all in the skillet.  I browned my beef, onions, and garlic. Cooked the pasta.  Then threw it into a baking dish & baked it instead for about 10 min.  It tasted pretty good.  I felt like it needed a can of diced tomatoes or something.  It just needed a bit more tomato flavor.

Awesome! Just needed some salt, pepper and garlic powder! I also doubled the soup, water, pasta and Worcestershire sauce... Baked in oven on 375 to melt the cheese...

Good, but as others have posted, it needs a little work.  I added basil and red pepper tonight, but needed something else.  Will keep this around, but will need to play with it some.

This was easy and fast. It tasted like tomato soup with some pasta and hamburger though. I think it could use some doctoring up to taste less like just soup. Not too impressive, but it filled us up and wasn't bad. Just boring. I doubled the Worcestershire trying to enrich the flavor but it didn't really help. I simmered this for twenty min and it helped the flavor some. We would eat this again, but only if the pantry was bare and this is what I was down to. Like I said, not bad but way down the list of choices.

As with other users, I found the original recipe lacking, so I doctored it up (a good recipe to let your own choices/flavor show) and found that chili, garlic, and onion powder was a great combination, with emphasis on the chili.

Quick, easy, and yummy! I never thought I would enjoy tomato soup in pasta, but it was tasty. The only thing I added extra was garlic salt.

I loved this recipe. It was easy and comfort food. I have made this three times. My only modifications were I add more cheese and a little whipping cream or half and half.

This recipe wasn't terrible, but the other reviews were right, it is not very tasty.  I wouldn't even compare it to a Hamburger Helper meal.  I did add some garlic powder to the dish and some Italian Stewed Tomatoes...but it didn't really help much.  It's an okay dish, just not a great one.

My husband made this...he chose it based on the ease of preparation.  It was indeed easy to make, but lacking in oomph.  He reports that the tomato soup is the dominant flavor.  It needed more cheese, and more seasoning.  Will not make it into our dinner rotation.

This was a quick, easy, and cheap recipe. I wanted it to be a "one-pan" recipe, so I added 1 1/2 cups water instead of 1/4 cup, and cooked the pasta right in the skillet (I simmered it for about 15 minutes and added the cheese afterward). I also had about 3/4 cup salsa leftover that I wanted to use, so I added it too. Going on other comments that it was a little bland, I added about 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and 2 tsp. chili powder (maybe more), and it added just enough flavor. Overall, it was a simple, tasty recipe.

It was very easy and you can add different ingredients to make it your own. I added italian seasonings, green peppers and garlic. It turned out pretty good.

It was bland.  I added the extra cheese.  Still wasn't too impressed.  Make sure you leave the noodles a little uncooked, as they go mushy really fast. I would add an extra cup of noodles too.  I found the meat dominated the dish.

As others mentioned, this was a little bland. I added minced garlic in with the onions and hamburger and that helped a little, but when it came to serving time - I just added a bunch of salt and pepper to mine.  My husband and 3 year old son didn't seem to mind the taste at all without adding salt or pepper.  Quick and easy!  We'll probably make it again but add more cheese, possible more tomato soup, and a vegetable or two (corn would be really good with this).  Thank you for the start-up recipe!

I made this for supper tonight and the hungry, picky children loved it!!!  I was able to make this up in 20 minutes.  The only thing I changed was, I used dehydrated onion and garlic (saving time on chopping).  Again this was exactly what I was looking for.  A quick kid friendly meal!  Thanks so much!

It was very bland.  I would not make it again unless I didn't have anything else to make.

I have already made this multiple times.  An easy quick favorite. I add diced tomatoes, garlic powder and increased the cheese.  I use about 12 oz of elbow macaroni because this is such a favorite it goes fast.
