As is they were quick and easy. We made them into "Easter eggs" by molding them into eggs shapes drying them overnight and dipping them into chocolate. Dry them well if you dip them! (but they were good...)

These were so close but a friend said that all she tasted was butter and then that's all I could taste too! So if you like the taste of butter...

The coating was a bit too sugary but overall very good. I drizzled some chocolate on it for an added touch turned out very pretty.

My mother has made a similar recipe to this for years but used 3lbs. 10X sugar 1 stick margarine softened 1 can Eagle Brand milk 17 oz. bag coconut 10 oz. maraschino cherries (chopped drained but save juice if you need to add a little at a time for the right consistency. No OJ in moms recipe. Mix make into tight balls (10X sugar on your hands helps with stickiness) freeze in single layer on baking sheet covered with wax paper. Dip in chocolate using a tooth pick the next day. Soooo good!

My whole family loved these!! I took them to a party and they went fast. If you don't like cherries I wouldn't do it but if you do TRY them...you really will like them. Kind of reminded me of my dad's fruit salad in a candy form.

I have made these for many Christmas' but once I have wrapped the Cocoanut mixture around the cherry I roll the ball in graham cracker crumbs and refrigerate or freeze. Delicious!

I made these for Christmas the first time I met my in-laws. My husband's family ate them up in less time than it took to make them.

I didn't like these at all. It was sticky and just tasted like butter.

not what I was looking for I guess. More or less like eating a ball of butter and icing sugar.

These did end up tasting like butter. I had even changed out the orange juice for rum. Thinking it would make it taste better. No such luck. Now I have a fridge full of butter flavor covered cherries....... Will not do again.
